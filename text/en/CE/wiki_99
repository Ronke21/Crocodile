<text>Ormsby MacKnight (or McKnight) Mitchel (August 28, 1810, or possibly 1809,October 31, 1862) was an American astronomer, polymath, and major general in the American Civil War.

He is known for publishing the first astronomy magazine in the United States. He is also known for ordering the raid that came into prominence as the Great Locomotive Chase during the American Civil War.

==Early life and career==
Mitchel was born in Union County, Kentucky, but grew up in Lebanon, Ohio. He was educated in Lebanon, Ohio and afterward at West Point in 1825, where he was a classmate to Robert E. Lee and Joseph E. Johnston. He graduated in 1829, placing 15th out of 46 graduates. Mitchel stayed at West Point as assistant professor of mathematics for three years. After holding several military positions while studying law, he went to Cincinnati, passed the bar and became an attorney. He also filled the office of Chief Engineer of the Little Miami Railroad, then in process of construction. Subsequently, in 1836, he became assistant professor of mathematics, philosophy, and professor of astronomy at Cincinnati College, and during this incumbency achieved a national renown as an astronomical lecturer and builder of the Cincinnati Observatory. He was instrumental in establishing the college&#x27;s law school, and on his first vacation, surveyed and recommended the route of the planned Little Miami Railroad between Cincinnati and Springfield, Ohio.

Conceiving a desire to possess a fine telescope, he began by striving to awaken interest in the subject of astronomy through a series of lectures. The first was heard by 16 people; but the last was listened to by an enraptured audience of 2,000. Availing himself of the enthusiasm thus generated, he organized the Cincinnati Astronomical Society with 300 members at $25 each, and started for Europe to find his telescope. His search was long, but successful and, returning, he plunged into the struggle to secure a suitable observatory. In the person of the eccentric but immensely capable Nicholas Longworth he found a helpful coadjutor. Upon the land which was donated by Longworth, located on the summit of Mt. Adams. Mitchel began the foundation of his building and John Quincy Adams, then more than 77 years of age, delivered an address at the laying of the cornerstone.

At this period of undertaking, he had collected $3,000, and $6,500 necessary to complete his work. The subscriptions came in slowly and hence he collected them in person. Where money could not be procured, he took provisions that had negotiable value, which he marketed and turned into cash. Many of his subscriptions being in work and materials no collectors would accept them as his assets and he undertook to make them available by buying all the materials, hiring all the men and superintending all the work. The ascent to the place of construction was steep. Therefore, he built a kiln and burned the lime; he purchased a sand pit also and often shoveled its contents into the wagon with his own hands.

He carried on with his classes, however, teaching five hours a day from eight until one. Each Saturday exhausted his funds and on Monday he had to begin collecting again. The construction was completed in March 1845, and he hoisted his telescope into place. At the time, it was the second-largest refracting telescope in the world. There was no salary attached to the office of astronomer in this new observatory and Mitchel supported himself by civil engineering on the route of the Ohio &amp; Mississippi Railroad (Ohio and Mississippi Railway) and by lecturing anywhere and everywhere. In 1853, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.
For a time, Cincinnati lost his inspirational presence. In 1859, Mitchel accepted the position of astronomer of the Dudley Observatory in Albany, New York, a position which he held until 1861, where he continued his pioneering work on the development of telegraphic determination of longitude. Although, he did not wholly relinquish a connection with the one he had built in Cincinnati.

He published, in 1846, the first monthly magazine in the United States devoted specifically to astronomy, the &quot;Sidereal Messenger&quot;, and other works including &quot;The Orbs of Heaven&quot; (1848 and later), and &quot;Popular Astronomy&quot; (1860).

When the American Civil War broke out, Mitchel turned soldier. He happened to be in New York when the news of the Battle of Fort Sumter came and, being asked to speak at a public meeting, gave an address, which along with his previous record, procured for Mitchel a high position in the Army and his second tour as a soldier began.

==Civil War==

During the American Civil War, he entered the Union Army with a commission as brigadier general of volunteers. He first organized the northern Kentucky defenses around Cincinnati. He commanded the Department of the Ohio from September to November 1861. During this time, he conspired with espionage agent James J. Andrews on plans to steal a train in Georgia and disrupt a railroad vital to the Confederate States Army coincident with Mitchel&#x27;s planned attack on Chattanooga, Tennessee. The raid failed, as did Mitchel&#x27;s military operation. Andrews and a number of his men were captured. Andrews himself was among eight men who were tried in Chattanooga. They were hanged in Atlanta by Confederate forces, but were later buried in the National Cemetery at Chattanooga in 1887.

Although a military failure, the story of Andrew&#x27;s Raid became known to American history as the Great Locomotive Chase, and has been retold in publications and film. The pursuit of Andrews&#x27; Raiders formed the basis of the Buster Keaton silent film &quot;The General&quot; and a dramatic 1956 Walt Disney film, &quot;The Great Locomotive Chase&quot;. 
Mitchel led a division in the Army of the Ohio from December 1861 to July 1862, and was placed in charge of the defense of Nashville, Tennessee, with headquarters in the vicinity of Shelbyville, Tennessee. He seized the city of Huntsville, Alabama in April 1862 without a shot being fired, after he led his troops there from Shelbyville in a surprise maneuver. He was promoted to major general for his efforts.

In September 1862, he assumed command of X Corps and the Department of the South at Hilton Head, South Carolina, but died in Beaufort of yellow fever shortly after assuming his post. He is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.

==Legacy==
* A persistently bright region near the Mars south pole that was first observed by Mitchel in 1846 is named in his honor – &#x27;The Mountains of Mitchel&#x27;. It is located near 70°S, 40°E.
* An impact crater on Mars was named in his honor.
* The new town (and later city) of Mitchell, Indiana was named for him after he surveyed it for the owners while working on the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad in the 1850s. (The second &quot;L&quot; was added later).
* The first post-Civil War freedmen&#x27;s town created in the United States (on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina), Mitchelville, was named for him.
* Fort Mitchell, Kentucky — an aberrant spelling — was also named for him.
* A descendant and namesake, Lt. Ormsby M. Mitchel Jr., was awarded the Navy Cross in 1943 for extraordinary heroism in trying to save the crew of his doomed USS &quot;Plymouth&quot; after it had been struck by a torpedo fired by a German U-boat off the Virginia coast.

<text>White Trash Hell is an EP by Everclear, released on March 24, 1997. The disc is largely a collection of demos recorded with drummer Scott Cuthbert in 1994 in preparation for &quot;Sparkle and Fade&quot;, with the exception of the acoustic version of &quot;Fire Maple Song&quot;, which features Greg Eklund on drums. The band turned over the recordings to their UK label, Fire Records, expecting them to be released sometime in 1995. However, the label stalled on releasing the EP, and it remained unissued until 1997.

The disc was available exclusively as a UK import until 2000, when it was issued in the US by label Atomic Pop. However, Atomic Pop went bankrupt within a few months, pushing its version out of print. Fire eventually re-issued the disc (without the band&#x27;s involvement or permission) in 2002 with a slipcover and slightly modified artwork.

The original artwork was designed by Steve Birch, who Art Alexakis met during the Colorfinger days while Steve was in Portland band Sprinkler. Birch later became a touring guitarist for Everclear during the tours in support of &quot;So Much for the Afterglow&quot;.

<text>Malnad (or Malenadu) is a region in the state of Karnataka, India. Malenadu covers the western and eastern slopes of the Western Ghats mountain range and is roughly 100 kilometers in width. It includes the districts of Uttara Kannada, Chikkamagaluru, Udupi, Belagavi, Dakshina Kannada, Hassan, Kodagu, Shivamogga. The region experiences heavy annual rainfall of ; it includes the village of Agumbe, which receives the highest annual rainfall in Karnataka (over 10,000 mm).

This region of the state experiences unique development problems due to settlement patterns, sparse population, topography, dense forest, and numerous rivulets. Villages in the Malnad are scattered throughout remote areas. To encourage development in the area, the l Area Development Board was created to implement necessary projects. The districts covered initially in this region were Shivamogga, Chikkamagaluru, Uttara Kannada, Kodagu, and Hassan. Presently, the Development Board operates in part or all of 13 districts of the state, and comprises 65 Assembly constituencies and 61 taluks:

<doc id="936525" wikidata="Q3236650" url="?curid=936525" title="Tulu Nadu">
<text>Tulu Nadu or Tulunad is a region and a proposed state on the southwestern coast of India. The Tulu people, known as &#x27;Tuluva&#x27; (plural &#x27;Tuluver&#x27;), speakers of Tulu, a Dravidian language, are the preponderant ethnic group of this region. South Canara, an erstwhile district and historical area, encompassing the undivided territory of the contemporary Dakshina Kannada (Kudla), Chikmagalur (Elyamagalnur), Hasan (Paasano) Udupi (Odipu) and some parts of Shimoga districts of Karnataka State and Kasaragod district (Kasrod) and Kannur of Kerala state forms the cultural area of the Tuluver.

Historically, Tulu Nadu lays between the Gangavalli River (Uttara Kannada district) in the north and the Payyanur (Kannur district) in the south. Currently, Tulu Nadu consists of the Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts of Karnataka state and Kasaragod district of Kerala state. This region is not an official administrative entity.

Mangalore, the fourth largest (in terms of area and population) and a major city of Karnataka is the largest city of Tulu Nadu. Udupi and Kasaragod are the other major cities of this region. 

Moreover, the term &quot;Tulunad&quot; is cited as &quot;Tuḷu Nāṭṭu&quot; in the &quot;Akananuru&quot;, which is a classical Tamil poetic work and part of the &quot;Eight Anthologies&quot; (Ettuthokai), a collection of Sangam literature composed around more than 2000 years ago. 

== Etymology ==
According to &quot;Keralolpathi&quot;, the name &quot;Tuluva&quot; comes from that of one of the Cheraman Perumal kings of Kerala, who fixed his residence in the northern portion of his dominions just before its separation from Kerala, and who was called &quot;Tulubhan Perumal&quot;.

== Mythology ==
According to mythology, the district was reclaimed by Parashurama from the sea. In accordance with the 17th-century Malayalam work &quot;Keralolpathi&quot;, the lands of Kerala and Tulu Nadu were recovered from the Arabian Sea by the axe-wielding warrior sage Parashurama, the sixth avatar of Vishnu (hence, Kerala is also called &quot;Parasurama Kshetram&quot; &#x27;The Land of Parasurama&#x27;). Parasurama threw his axe across the sea, and the water receded as far as it reached. According to legend, this new area of land extended from Gokarna to Kanyakumari. The land which rose from sea was filled with salt and unsuitable for habitation; so Parasurama invoked the Snake King Vasuki, who spat holy poison and converted the soil into fertile lush green land. Out of respect, Vasuki and all snakes were appointed as protectors and guardians of the land. P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar theorised, that Senguttuvan may have been inspired by the Parashurama legend, which was brought by early Aryan settlers.

== History ==
=== Ancient period ===
According to the works of Sangam literature (300 BCE – 300 CE), Tulu Nadu was one of the 12 socio-geographical regions included in the ancient Tamilakam. Tulu Nadu must certainly at one time have formed part of ancient Kerala (Chera dynasty), where the western coastal dialect of Middle Tamil was spoken. It must have separated from Tamilakam sometime between 300 CE and 500 CE, when the Kadambas invaded the northern portions of Chera kingdom. No definite historical record relating to Tulu Nadu, other than those were found from Sangam literature, have been found of earlier date than 8th or 9th century CE.

=== Alupa dynasty ===
Ptolemy, the 2nd-century geographer identifies the Tulu Nadu region as &quot;Olokhoira&quot; which is widely believed to be a corruption of the term &quot;Alva Kheda&quot;, &#x27;the land of the Alvas&#x27;.[2] Historically, Tulu Nadu included the two separate lands of Haiva and Tuluva. The longest-ruling and oldest known native dynasty of Tulu Nadu was that of the Alupas ( 5th – 14th century CE). Their kingdom was also known as &quot;Alvakheda&quot;. They initially ruled independently and later were the feudatories of the prominent dynasties. The Kadamba dynasty of Banavasi was the earliest, under which the Alupas flourished. Later the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta, Chalukyas of Badami, Chalukyas of Kalyani, Hoysalas of Dwarasamudra (Halebidu) and Rayas of Vijayanagara were the overlords. The Alupas, however, were independent and their subordination was nominal at best. They ruled until the Vijayanagara Empire took control of Tulu Nadu from 14th to the 17th centuries.

During the rule of Vijayanagara, Tulu Nadu was administered in two parts – &quot;Mangaluru Rajya&quot; and &quot;Barkuru Rajya&quot;. Tulu Nadu was governed by the native feudatories of the Vijayanagara Empire until the 18th century. These feudatories gained power towards the end of the Alupa period. An Old Malayalam inscription (Ramanthali inscriptions), dated to 1075, mentioning king Kunda Alupa, the ruler of Alupa dynasty of Mangalore, can be found at Ezhimala (the former headquarters of Mushika dynasty), near Payyanur, in Kerala State.

Notable among them were the Chowtas of Ullal and Moodabidri (), Ajilas of Venur (c. 1418–1800), the Savanta or Samantha Rajas of Mulki (c. 1411–1700), the Bhairarasa Odeyas of Karkala (c. 1240–1650), the Tolaharas of Suralu (c. 1139–1800), the Bangas of Bangadi (c. 1410–1800), the Rajas of Kumbla (c. 12th century – 1800), and the Rajas of Vitla (c. 1436–1800).

The region became extremely prosperous during the Vijayanagara period with Barkur and Mangalore gaining importance. After the decline of the Vijayanagara Empire, the Keladi Nayakas of Ikkeri controlled much of Tulu Nadu. Over the following many centuries, more ethnic groups migrated to the area. Konkanis from Goa arrived by sea, as Mangalore was a major port that served not only the Portuguese but also the Arabs for maritime trades. Jains were already a prominent group and even today are uniquely preserved in Tulu Nadu. Though small in number, the Jains left behind indelible reminders of their glory with temples (&quot;bastis&quot;) in (Moodabidri) and monolithic statues of Bahubali in Karkala, Venoor and Dharmasthala. In the 16th century, there was a large influx of Catholics to Tulu Nadu from Goa.

Under Portuguese rule, the region was called the &quot;Misao do Sul&quot; (Mission of the South). In the mid to late 18th century, it was conquered by Hyder Ali, the de facto ruler of Mysore. After the British defeated Haidar&#x27;s successor Tipu Sultan in 1799, the region was attached to the Madras Presidency before being reverted to the state of Mysore after independence. Mangalore played a prominent role in Tipu&#x27;s battles with the British. The British gained full control by 1801 (Mysore has since been renamed Karnataka). The British ruled the region with Madras (now Chennai) as its headquarters. Under the British, the region was organised into the districts of North Canara and South Canara respectively.
When the states were reorganised on linguistic basis in 1956, Tulu Nadu (South Canara) which was earlier a part of Madras Presidency and North Canara which was a part of Bombay Presidency became part of the newly formed Mysore state, which was later renamed as Karnataka. Kasargod became part of the newly formed state of Kerala. The Tuluvas began demanding official language status for Tulu and a separate state named Tulu Nadu for themselves. Organisations like the &quot;Tulu Rajya Horata Samiti&quot; have taken up the cause of the Tuluvas and meetings and demonstrations were held at towns like Mangalore and Udupi to voice their demand.

== Demographics ==

South Kanara had a total population of 1,748,991 in 1951, of whom 76.58% were Hindus, 14.31% Muslim and 8.85% Christian. The most widely spoken language was Tulu which was the mother tongue of 40% of the population, followed by Malayalam which formed the mother tongue of 24 percent each of the population. Around 17% of the total population spoke Kannada. Around 13% of the population speaks Konkani as their mother tongue. In 1901, South Kanara had a density of .

The 1908 &quot;Imperial Gazetteer of India&quot; lists South Canara, along with the Thanjavur and Ganjam districts, as the three districts of the Madras Presidency where Brahmins are most numerous.

The majority of the people were Billavas and Bunts. There were more Brahmins (12% of the population) in South Kanara than any other district of the Madras Presidency making South Kanara, along with Tanjore and Ganjam as one of the three districts of the province where Brahmins were most numerous.

The original indigenous people of the region are Tuluvas (Bunts, Billavas, Mogaveeras, Tulu gowda, Kulalas, Devadigas, Bearys, Jogis, and Tulu Brahamins) and Malayalis in the Kasaragod Taluk (Nambudiris, Nairs, Thiyyas, Mappilas etc.). The Brahmins who settled first belonged chiefly to the Sthanika and thus they were called as Tulu Brahmins. Others were Shivalli, Saraswat, Havyaka, Kotaha sub-sections, Mahars, the hill-tribes (&quot;Koragas&quot;).

== Language ==
The most widely spoken Language is Tulu which belongs to the Dravidian family of languages, and whose native speakers are referred to as Tuluva. The number of Tulu speakers was estimated to be about 1.7 million in 2001, although some sources quote as many as 3 million. The other languages spoken in Tulu Nadu include Kundagannada, Arebhashe, Malayalam, Konkani, Koraga and Beary.

The Tulu script, originating from the Grantha script, and bears high similarity to the Malayalam script. It was used by Tuluvas for centuries before it was eventually replaced by the Kannada script. Most Sanskrit works and Tulu classics are present in this script, with a few in other scripts. This script was used by Brahmins.

== Economy ==
Historically, Tulu Nadu was primarily dependent on agriculture and fishing. The main crops grown were rice, Bengal gram, horse gram, vegetables, and fruits. Plantation crops like coconut, areca nut, cocoa, cashew nut, and pepper are also grown. In the early 20th century, the Mangalore tile industry, cashew nut processing, and the banking industry grew substantially. Tulu Nadu is called &quot;the cradle of Indian banking&quot;. Five major banks of India (Syndicate Bank, Canara Bank, Corporation Bank, Vijaya Bank, and Karnataka Bank) have their origins here.

In the early part of the 21st century the area has been transforming itself into a hub of the information technology and medical services industries. There has been large-scale decline in agriculture and related industries due to the non-availability of labour and preference for white-collar jobs. Agricultural land is being converted to commercial and real estate properties, and environmental pollution is increasing drastically due to large-scale deforestation and increase in automobile use. A public sector petroleum refinery (MRPL) was established in the 1990s. Some chemical plants (e.g., fertilizers and pesticides) have been established. This region contributes the second highest revenue to Karnataka state after the city of Bangalore. This region has an international airport at Mangalore which is well connected to the rest of India and middle eastern countries. New Mangalore Port (NMPT) is one of the major port of India located at Panambur, Mangalore.

Tulu Nadu is often considered one of the most prominent educational hub on the western coast of India, as there are hundreds of professional colleges in Tulu Nadu. Mangalore and Manipal are the major cities that accommodate these students. National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK, Surathkal, owned by Central Government) is ranked as one of the best engineering college in Karnataka and is one among the top ten engineering colleges of India. Kasturba Medical College was ranked 9th and 21st among the medical colleges of India in the NIRF 2020 Rankings.

<text>Geoffrey Sax (sometimes credited as Geoff Sax) is a British film and television director, who has worked on a variety of drama productions in both the United Kingdom and the United States.

==Life and career==
He began his directing career in the late 1970s, initially working in comedy, directing episodes of a number of sketch shows such as &quot;Cannon and Ball&quot; and &quot;End of Part One&quot;. He made the move into directing drama in the early 1980s, working on episodes of BBC dramas such as &quot;Bergerac&quot; and &quot;Lovejoy&quot;.

Later in the decade he worked on ITV programmes such as &quot;Spitting Image&quot; and &quot;The New Statesman&quot;. In the early 1990s he worked for a time in America, directing television films and miniseries for various networks there. His most noted production during this time was the BBC / Universal Studios / Fox Network TV movie version of the science-fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, screened in 1996 and starring Paul McGann as the Doctor.

In 1998 Sax returned to the UK. He directed Lynda La Plante&#x27;s adaptation of her own novel &quot;Killer Net&quot; that year, and later gained credits on Paul Abbott&#x27;s acclaimed &quot;Clocking Off&quot;, a Red Production Company series for BBC One.

In 2001 he directed a modern-day adaptation of the story of &quot;Othello&quot;, produced by London Weekend Television for the ITV network and starring Eamonn Walker, Christopher Eccleston and Keeley Hawes. The adaptation was written by Andrew Davies, who Sax worked with again the following year when he directed Davies&#x27; adaptation of Sarah Waters&#x27; novel &quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot; for Sally Head Productions and BBC Two. This was not the only connection between the two productions: Keeley Hawes also co-starred in &quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot; with Rachael Stirling, who had a smaller role in &quot;Othello&quot;.

Sax&#x27;s first theatrically released feature film, &quot;White Noise&quot;, was released in January 2005, entering the US Box Office top ten at No. 2. His second feature, &quot;Stormbreaker&quot; — based on Anthony Horowitz&#x27;s &quot;Alex Rider&quot; novel of the same name — was released in the summer of 2006. He also directed the film &quot;Frankie &amp; Alice&quot; in 2010.

In 2011, Sax directed a television film entitled &quot;Christopher and His Kind&quot;.

He directed the Sky1 television film television film adaptation of the M. C. Beaton novel &quot;Agatha Raisin and the Quiche of Death&quot;.

<text>Yaroslav II Iziaslavich (died 1180) was Prince of Turov (1146), Novgorod (1148–1154), Lutsk (1154–1180) and Grand Prince of Kiev (1174–1175; 1180). He was the son of Iziaslav II of Kiev and Agnes Hohenstaufen and the brother of Mstislav II of Kiev.

==Biography==
After the murder of Andrey Bogolyubsky, Yaroslav&#x27;s relatives managed to maneuver him into the Kievan throne. He contended with a senior relative, Sviatoslav Vsevolodivich, for over two years before Sviatoslav eventually won power for himself and became the uncontested ruler of Kiev.

==Family==
He was married to Richeza, daughter Vladislaus II, King of Bohemia.

<text>The title of Earl of Blessington was created twice in the Peerage of Ireland, in 1745 and 1816. Both creations became extinct, in 1769 and 1829 respectively. The earldom was also spelt as Blesington.

Anne Boyle, sister of the last Viscount Blessington, married William Stewart, 2nd Viscount Mountjoy, and their son William, 3rd Viscount Mountjoy, was created Earl of Blessington, in the Peerage of Ireland, on 7 December 1745. This title became extinct on his death on the 14 August 1769.

The Earldom was recreated on 22 January 1816 for Charles John Gardiner, 2nd Viscount Mountjoy, a descendant of the Stewart Viscounts Mountjoy, although not of the Boyle Viscounts Blessington. Gardiner died on 25 May 1829, without surviving male heir and his titles became extinct.

<text>The Factory was Andy Warhol&#x27;s studio in Manhattan, New York City, which had four locations between 1963 and 1987. The Factory became famed for its parties in the 1960s. It was the hip hangout spot for artists, musicians, celebrities, and Warhol&#x27;s superstars. The original Factory was often referred to as the Silver Factory. In the studio, Warhol&#x27;s workers would make silkscreens and lithographs under his direction.

== History ==
Speaking in 2002, musician John Cale said, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t called the Factory for nothing. It was where the assembly line for the silkscreens happened. While one person was making a silkscreen, somebody else would be filming a screen test. Every day something new.&quot;

Due to the mess his work was causing at home, Warhol wanted to find a studio where he could paint. A friend of his found an old unoccupied firehouse on 159 East 87th Street where Warhol began working in January 1963. No one was eager to go there, so the rent was $150 a month.&lt;ref name=&quot;artnet/755330&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1963–67: 231 East 47th Street ===
A few months later, Warhol was informed that the building would have to be vacated soon, and in November he found another loft on the fifth floor at 231 East 47th Street in Midtown Manhattan, which would become the first Factory. 

In 1963, artist Ray Johnson took Warhol to a &quot;haircutting party&quot; at Billy Name&#x27;s apartment, decorated with tin foil and silver paint, and Warhol asked him to do the same scheme for his recently leased loft. Name covered the whole factory in silver, even the elevator. Warhol&#x27;s years at the Factory were known as the Silver Era. Aside from the prints and paintings, Warhol produced shoes, films, sculptures and commissioned work in various genres to brand and sell items with his name. His first commissions consisted of a single silkscreen portrait for $25,000, with additional canvases in other colors for $5,000 each. He later increased the price of alternative colors to $20,000 each. Warhol used a large portion of his income to finance the Factory.

Billy Name brought in the red couch which became a prominent furnishing at the Factory, finding it on the sidewalk of 47th street during one of his &quot;midnight outings.&quot; The sofa quickly became a favorite place for Factory guests to crash overnight, usually after coming down from speed. It was featured in many photographs and films from the Silver era, including &quot;Blow Job&quot; (1963) and &quot;Couch&quot; (1964). During the move in 1968, the couch was stolen while left unattended on the sidewalk for a short time.

Many Warhol films, including those made at the Factory, were first (or later) shown at the New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre or 55th Street Playhouse.

By the time Warhol had achieved a reputation, he was working day and night on his paintings. Warhol used silkscreens so that he could mass-produce images the way corporations mass-produced consumer goods. To increase production, he attracted a ménage of adult film performers, drag queens, socialites, drug addicts, musicians, and free-thinkers who became known as the Warhol Superstars, to help him. These &quot;art-workers&quot; helped him create his paintings, starred in his films, and created the atmosphere for which the Factory became legendary.

Warhol began looking for a new Factory location in 1967 because the building was scheduled to be demolished. The location is now the entrance to the parking garage of One Dag.

===1968–73: 33 Union Square West===

He then relocated his studio to the sixth floor of the Decker Building at 33 Union Square West near the corner of East 16th Street, near Max&#x27;s Kansas City, a club which Warhol and his entourage frequently visited. The same year Warhol created the business Factory Additions to handle the business of publishing and printmaking.

In June 1968, Warhol was shot by feminist Valerie Solanas at the Factory. The Factory had an open door policy where anyone could enter, but after the shooting, Warhol&#x27;s longtime partner Jed Johnson built a wall around the elevator and put in a Dutch door so that visitors would have be buzzed in. 

In 1969, Warhol co-founded &quot;Interview&quot; magazine and the Factory transformed &quot;from an all-night party to an all-day office, from hell-on-earth to down-to-earth.&quot; 

===1973–84: 860 Broadway===
In 1973, Warhol moved the Factory to 860 Broadway at the north end of Union Square. He filmed his television series &quot;Andy Warhol&#x27;s TV&quot; at the Factory from 1980 to 1983. 

The nightclub &quot;Underground&quot; operated at 860 Broadway from 1980 to 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/1988/11/11/plush-discos&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was owned by Maurice Brahms,&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/1990/01/08/violence-disco&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;disco-disco/maurice&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a former partner of Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager, the original owners of Studio 54, and Jay Levy after Club 54 closed, due to jailing of Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager.&lt;ref name=&quot;disco-disco/other-clubs&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;digital.library.cornell.edu/ss:455518&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;amourdart/kaufman-steve&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The club opened on February 28, 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;papermag/2505957578&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; John Blair got his start there. Baird Jones promoted Thursday, Friday, and Saturday night parties from 1983 to 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/1995/02/12/after-fabulous&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Music videos for &quot;I Want To Know What Love Is&quot; by Foreigner and &quot;Word Up!&quot; by Cameo were filmed at the club. After about a decade, the club was reimagined by BlackBook Magazine columnist Steve Lewis &amp; Co. as &quot;Le Palace de Beauté&quot;, where RuPaul often performed. After the Underground closed, Petco opened, moving in 2022, to 44 Union Square, the former Tammany Hall.&lt;ref name=&quot;therealdeal/petco-hops&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vassifer/860-bway-obrien&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1984–87: 158 Madison Ave (22 East 33rd Street) ===
In 1984, Warhol moved his art studio to 22 East 33rd Street, a conventional office building. His television studio had an entrance at 158 Madison Avenue and the &quot;Interview&quot; magazine office had an entrance at 19 East 32nd Street. Warhol filmed his MTV talk show &quot;Andy Warhol&#x27;s Fifteen Minutes&quot; at the Factory from 1985 until he died in 1987.

==Work==
=== Music ===
The Factory became a meeting place of artists and musicians such as Lou Reed, Bob Dylan, and Mick Jagger, as well as writer Truman Capote. Less frequent visitors included Salvador Dalí and Allen Ginsberg. Warhol collaborated with Reed&#x27;s influential New York rock band the Velvet Underground in 1965, and designed the noted cover for &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico,&quot; the band&#x27;s debut album. It featured a plastic image of a yellow banana, which users could peel off to reveal a flesh-hued version of the banana. Warhol also designed the album cover for the Rolling Stones&#x27; album &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot;.

Warhol included the Velvet Underground in the Exploding Plastic Inevitable, a spectacle that combined art, rock, Warhol films and dancers of all kinds, as well as live S&amp;M enactments and imagery. The Velvet Underground and EPI used the Factory as a place to rehearse and hang out.

&quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot;, Lou Reed&#x27;s best-known song from his solo career, was released on his second, and first commercially successful, solo album, &quot;Transformer&quot; (1972). The song relates to the superstars and life of the Factory. He mentions Holly Woodlawn, Candy Darling, Joe Dallesandro, Jackie Curtis and Joe Campbell (referred to in the song by his Factory nickname Sugar Plum Fairy).

=== Sexual radicals ===
Andy Warhol commented on mainstream America through his art while disregarding its conservative social views. Almost all his work filmed at the Factory featured nudity, graphic sexuality, drug use, same-sex relations and transgender characters in much greater proportion to what was being shown in mainstream cinema. By making the films, Warhol created a sexually lenient environment at the Factory for the &quot;happenings&quot; staged there, which included fake weddings between drag queens, porn film rentals, and vulgar plays. What was called free love took place in the studio, as sexuality in the 1960s was becoming more open and embraced as a high ideal. Warhol used footage of sexual acts between his friends in his work, such as in &quot;Blue Movie&quot;, a 1969 film directed, produced, written and cinematographed by Warhol. The film, starring Viva and Louis Waldon, was the first adult erotic film depicting explicit sex to receive wide theatrical release in the United States.

Holly Woodlawn and Candy Darling were noted transgender women who were part of the Factory group, as was drag queen Jackie Curtis. Andy Warhol frequently used these women and other sexual non-conformists in his films, plays, and events. Because of the constant drug use and the presence of sexually liberal artists and radicals, drugged orgies were a frequent happening at the Factory. Warhol met Ondine at an orgy in 1962:

=== Films ===

Warhol started shooting movies in the Factory around 1963, when he began work on &quot;Kiss&quot;. He screened his films at the Factory for his friends before they were released for public audiences. When traditional theaters refused to screen his more provocative films, Warhol sometimes turned to night-clubs or porn theaters, including the New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre and the 55th Street Playhouse, for their distribution.

<text>Earl of Bantry, of Bantry in the County of Cork, was a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1816 for Richard White, 1st Viscount Bantry, who had helped repelling the French invasion at Bantry Bay in 1797. He had already been created Baron Bantry, of Bantry in the County of Cork, and Viscount Bantry, of Bantry in the County of Cork, in 1800, and was made Viscount Berehaven at the same time he was given the earldom. These titles were also in the Peerage of Ireland. He was the grandson of Richard White, who had made an immense fortune through his work as a lawyer. Lord Bantry was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He sat on the Conservative benches in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer from 1854 to 1868. His younger brother, the third Earl, assumed in 1840 by Royal licence the additional surname of Hedges, which was that of his paternal grandmother. He was an Irish Representative Peer from 1869 to 1884. The titles became extinct on the death of his son, the fourth Earl, in 1891.

The family seat was Bantry House, near Bantry, in County Cork, Ireland. The house is still in the hands of the White family.

<text>Lucien Van Impe (; born 20 October 1946) is a former Belgian cyclist, who competed professionally between 1969 and 1987. He excelled mainly as a climber in multiple-day races such as the Tour de France. He was the winner of the 1976 Tour de France, and six times winner of the mountains classification in the Tour de France.

==Biography==
Van Impe credits the start of his career to Spaniard Federico Bahamontes, a climber nicknamed &quot;the eagle of Toledo&quot; and a former Tour de France winner. In 1968 van Impe was King of the Mountains in the Tour de l&#x27;Avenir. Bahamontes used his influence to get van Impe a contract as a professional. In 1969, Van Impe started his professional career with a 12th place in the 1969 Tour de France.
In 1971, Van Impe won his first mountains classification in the Tour de France. He would repeat that five more times, a record then shared with Bahamontes. When Richard Virenque broke the record with a seventh victory in 2004, Van Impe criticized Virenque for being opportunistic rather than the best climber; he said he had himself refrained from breaking Bahamontes&#x27; record himself out of reverence.

Van Impe&#x27;s Sonolor team fused with Gitane to become Gitane-Campagnolo in 1975. Former French champion Cyrille Guimard, who retired in early 1976, became directeur sportif in 1976. He was considered to be among the pre-race favorites as this edition had eight high mountain stages and it was expected to be a battle between Van Impe, Joop Zoetemelk and defending champion Bernard Thevenet. Thevenet was no match for these two riders from the Low Countries in the 1976 edition, and despite a strong start from debutant Freddy Maertens, the race became a duel between Van Impe and Zoetemelk with the mountains of the 1976 Tour de France deciding who would become champ. Guimard claims it was his order to attack Zoetemelk that won Van Impe the Tour, shouting at Van Impe that he&#x27;d run him off the road with the car if he didn&#x27;t attack. Van Impe has denied this. Despite Zoetemelk winning three high mountain stages Van Impe&#x27;s attack gave him a lead of more than +3:00 on the Dutchman, and he then clinched his victory by finishing more than a minute ahead of Zoetemelk in the final individual time trial.

After 1976, Van Impe changed teams. In the 1977 Tour de France he started favorite but failed to take a lead in the mountains. He waited until the last mountain stage to attack, which finished atop Alpe d&#x27;Huez, and was in the lead late in the stage but forgot to eat, which caused his lead to slip away. He was still in the lead when he was hit by one of the TV cars. Due to his team car being so far behind he had to stand on the side of the road and wait several minutes for a new bike as Bernard Thévenet and Hennie Kuiper rode past; and the 1977 edition would be decided between the two of them as a result.

After three years where he wasn&#x27;t among the GC favorites, Van Impe rode incredibly well in the 1981 Tour de France. He finished on the podium in 2nd place, although he was more than +10:00 behind Bernard Hinault, however he won the mountain classification yet again. All total Van Impe finished in the top 5 of the Tour de France eight times.

He also won the mountain classification in the Giro d&#x27;Italia twice.

Single-day races were not his specialty and it was a surprise that he won the national championship in 1983.

Van Impe started 15 Tours de France and reached the finish in Paris every time. This was a record when he finished his last, but he would be passed for most Tour finishes by Joop Zoetemelk in 1986, and eventually Sylvain Chavanel reached 16 finishes in 2018. He is currently tied for 2nd with Viatcheslav Ekimov who finished his 15th edition in 2006.

From 2007 to 2013, he was sporting director of a cycling team of professional riders, called .

Lucien Van Impe lives in Impe (his family name refers to that town) with his wife Rita, he has two grown up children, a son and a daughter. His house is called Alpe D&#x27;Huez, after the French mountain where he took the yellow jersey (the leader in the Tour de France) in 1976. When he came home that year, the bar where his supporters gathered every day to watch him win the Tour, was painted yellow entirely.

During and after his professional career, Van Impe has never tested positive, refused a doping test or confessed having used doping.

He has been honoured by a tasteful abstract statue on his bike, on a stone plinth on a small roundabout in Belgium at 180 km before the finish of Belgium&#x27;s blue-ribband event, the Tour of Flanders.

Van Impe suffered a cardiac arrest in 2017, but completely recovered from it.

<text>A bus bulb, also called a bus boarder, bus border, bumpout, bus cape, or a kerb outstand is an arrangement by which a sidewalk or pavement is extended outwards for a bus stop; typically the bus bulb replaces roadway that would otherwise be part of a parking lane. With bus bulbs or boarders, a bus can stay in its traffic lane to discharge and pick up passengers, instead of having to pull over to the curb.

The term bus bulb is prevalent in North American usage, whilst bus boarder or bus border is used elsewhere.

A bus bulb or boarder can be considered as a specific form of curb extension, although that term is more normally used to describe a sidewalk extension for the purposes of traffic calming or other traffic management purposes.

== Benefits ==
Benefits include preventing buses from being delayed by having to pull back into traffic, reducing risk of traffic collisions, reducing pedestrian exposure in crosswalks (if provided at the same location), reducing sidewalk congestion, providing space for bus patron amenities including bus shelters, and traffic calming. The protrusion also facilitates easier full length alignment of a bus entrance with a raised kerb stop, especially to allow level boarding in the case of low-floor buses.

Bus bulbs also retain more parking when compared to a bus stop located in a parking lane, as a bus stop so located requires run-in and run-out tapers. Together these tapers may take up as much space as the actual stop, requiring parking to be prohibited over a longer length of road than with a bulb, where cars can park immediately on either side of the bus stop itself.

== Drawbacks ==
The main drawback is for cyclists. The narrowing of the road can create danger for cyclists if the design does not take their needs into account. Where more than one lane exists in one direction, modelling has shown that there is no additional delay overall for following drivers, since the buses have shorter dwell times (there is less time spent pulling back into traffic) and since following vehicles may use the second lane for passing.

== Tram and streetcar bulbs ==
Some tram and streetcar systems use similar bulbs, such as the Brussels tram network, the Hongkong Tramways, the Melbourne tram network and the Toronto streetcar system. 

The latter, which operates mostly on traditional streetcar tracks in mixed traffic with cars, and has frequent request stops similar to bus routes, is introducing bulbs at some high-traffic stops and transfer points that have been recently renovated, notably on Roncesvalles Avenue. The first bulbs (called bumpouts locally) along Roncesvalles Avenue also accommodate cyclists, as the bike lane running parallel to the streetcar tracks would gently rise up from the road level to run on top of the bumpout. When the streetcar is boarding, cyclists have to stop behind the yellow line to allow riders on and off. There are three expected goals for these bulbs:
*Prevent vehicles from parking in front of streetcar stops.
*Increase standing room on the often restricted sidewalks at stop locations in some of the densest regions of the city.
*Improve safety for passengers boarding and alighting at these stops; unmodified stops require passengers to step into traffic to board/alight. The safety concerns are mostly with regard to drivers who are inexperienced at driving among streetcars in mixed traffic.
Streetcar bulbs may also be beneficial at higher-capacity stops along other streetcar routes, and may be rolled out in conjunction with longer streetcars on the route. These bulbs are also featured in the westbound of Johnston Road, as well as southbound Percival Street and westbound Catchick Street in Victoria City, Hong Kong Island, on the Hongkong Tramways.

<text>Acceptable daily intake or ADI is a measure of the amount of a specific substance (originally applied for a food additive, later also for a residue of a veterinary drug or pesticide) in food or drinking water that can be ingested (orally) daily over a lifetime without an appreciable health risk. ADIs are expressed usually in milligrams (of the substance) per kilograms of body weight per day.

== History ==
This concept was first introduced in 1961 by the Council of Europe and later, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), a committee maintained by two United Nations bodies: the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO).

== Concept ==
An ADI value is based on current research, with long-term studies on animals and observations of humans. First, a no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL), the amount of a substance that shows no toxic effects, is determined. Usually the studies are performed with several doses including high doses. In the case of several studies on different effects, the lowest NOAEL is usually taken. Then, the NOAEL (or another point of departure such as a benchmark dose level (BMDL)) is divided by a safety factor, conventionally 100, to account for the differences between test animals and humans (factor of 10) and possible differences in sensitivity between humans (another factor of 10). Safety factors with values other than 100 may be used if information on uncertainty about the value of the point of departure (NOAEL or BMDL) justify it. For instance, if the ADI is based on data from humans the safety factor is usually 10 instead of 100. The ADI is usually given in mg per kg body weight.

The ADI is considered a safe intake level for a healthy adult of normal weight who consumes an average daily amount of the substance in question. Increased safety factors for infants have been discussed, but are not needed, because elimination of chemicals is in fact often more rapid in children and as children generally have higher illness rates than adults, adverse effects caused by food additives can easily be disguised as any number of things children usually experience. It would be far more difficult to argue the case with a healthy adult. The ADI does not take into account allergic reactions that are individual responses rather than dose-dependent phenomena.

The higher the ADI, the larger amounts of a compound are safe for regular ingestion. The concept of tolerable daily intake is often used for unwanted contaminants or other chemicals.

The ADI concept can be understood as a measure to indicate the toxicity from long-term exposure to repeated ingestion of chemical compounds in foods (present and/or added), as opposed to acute toxicity.

The threshold limit value (TLV) of a chemical substance is a level to which it is believed a worker can be exposed day after day for a working lifetime without adverse effects.

<doc id="936560" wikidata="Q2311775" url="?curid=936560" title="DGC Records">
<text>DGC Records (an initialism for the David Geffen Company) was an American record label that operated as a division of Interscope Geffen A&amp;M Records, which is owned by Universal Music Group.

In 1999, after the PolyGram merger into UMG which created the Interscope Geffen A&amp;M unit, DGC was absorbed into Geffen Records, but was later revived in 2007 before being merged into Geffen again in September 2021 following eight years of inactivity.

The most famous group they signed was Nirvana.

==History==
DGC Records (The &#x27;DGC&#x27; portion of the name was then known as the David Geffen Company) was launched in 1990 by David Geffen as a subsidiary label of Geffen Records and was distributed by Warner Bros. Records until 1991, when it was acquired by MCA Music Entertainment Group, a division of MCA Inc. The label was created as a response to the success Geffen had with the harder rock acts on its roster. Though it initially focused on more progressive rock and heavy metal, as the decade progressed it also embraced the emergence of (and become a seminal label of) alternative rock, with influential acts like Nirvana, Sonic Youth, Hole, Weezer and Beck. The label also released early titles by Philadelphia alternative hip hop band the Roots.

In 1994, Nirvana, which became one of DGC&#x27;s most promising sources of revenue following the release of their 1991 album &quot;Nevermind&quot;, would disband. In 1995, David Geffen would leave Geffen Records to help form DreamWorks SKG (later DreamWorks Pictures) with Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg. In 1996, a year after Matsushita Corporation (now Panasonic) sold off 80% of MCA Inc. To Canadian distillery and media conglomerate Seagram, the company name was reincorporated as Universal Studios, Inc. (later doing business as Universal Pictures). Even so, MCA Music Entertainment also rebranded as Universal Music Group. DGC, and its sister labels, Geffen, Interscope Records, DreamWorks Records, MCA Records, Universal Records and Republic Records, would now operate under the new music company name. However, despite the parent company name changing, chances of DGC performing as a label proved less fruitful as its record sales started to see a small 19% decrease in the first quarter of 1997.

On December 10, 1998, Seagram completed its seven-month $10.6 billion plan to acquire PolyGram, merging its music division&#x27;s operations into Universal Music. Following so, on time for New Year&#x27;s Day 1999, UMG combined the operations of Interscope, Geffen and now-inactive sister label A&amp;M Records into Interscope Geffen A&amp;M Records, a newly formed one out of the four label groups under UMG (the other three being the Verve Label Group, Universal Motown Republic Group and the Island Def Jam Music Group). DGC would have been a sister label to newly acquired A&amp;M, Island Records, Def Jam Recordings, Mercury Records and Motown (which had previously been a part of UMG during its preceding MCA era from 1988 to 1991), but later in 1999, the label&#x27;s operations were folded into Geffen Records, as was A&amp;M (which itself would be absorbed into Geffen&#x27;s parenting label, Interscope). The retained acts went on to record for the main Geffen imprint. However, Beck and Sonic Youth would remain recording for DGC until August 2003, during a reorganization at IGA, which finally fulfilled both acts&#x27; involvement with the imprint when they altogether would finally be drafted into Geffen, effectively ending the label name, at the same time as MCA and DreamWorks Records being absorbed into the label as well, expanding Geffen&#x27;s artist roster.

In the years to follow, the DGC title and logo occasionally appeared on reissues of its past catalog items, maintained by UMG&#x27;s catalogue remaster label Universal Music Enterprises.

In 2007, the label was revived as a brand for both Geffen and Interscope Records, inheriting many alternative acts signed to Interscope Geffen A&amp;M (including acts that previously recorded for either Geffen, MCA or DreamWorks Records). Throughout its revival, it released albums by Weezer, Beck, Counting Crows, Papa Roach, AFI and Rise Against. In 2008, DGC, in partnership with MySpace Records, signed Los Angeles-based artist Meiko (through indie label Lucky Ear Music) and alternative indie singer-songwriter Kate Voegele.

In 2009, Blink-182 and Alabama rapper Yelawolf also joined the imprint. Albums releases followed: Blink-182&#x27;s &quot;Neighborhoods&quot; (2011), Yelawolf&#x27;s EP, &quot;Trunk Muzik 0-60&quot; (2010), and his sophomore studio album, &quot;Radioactive&quot; (released in conjunction with Kawan Prather&#x27;s Ghet-O-Vision and Eminem&#x27;s Shady Records on November 21, 2011). All three projects managed to receive critical praise and commercial success.

In December 2010, Luke Wood stepped down as president of the label. After five years under Geffen, Compton rapper The Game resigned with Interscope through DGC. On August 22, 2011, his fourth studio album, &quot;The R.E.D. Album&quot;, was released under the imprint. Despite mixed reception, it debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. After releasing his fifth follow-up, &quot;Jesus Piece&quot;, in December 2012, Game parted ways with DGC and ended his relationship with Interscope. As a result, and without an artist on its own roster, the label went inactive in 2013. However, DGC as an imprint and name managed to hold copyrights for reissues of catalogue releases under UMe for the time being.

On September 27, 2021, following its eight years of hibernation, DGC Records was permanently merged into Geffen Records, once again ending the label&#x27;s operations and name. The remains of DGC&#x27;s artist roster and catalogue releases were to be transferred to Geffen following its merger and later closure. The last of what was the imprint is now under the corporate control of Universal Music&#x27;s Interscope Geffen A&amp;M division.

To date, the best-selling album in the DGC catalog is &quot;Nevermind&quot;, the 1991 album by Nirvana, reaching international sales of 25 million copies worldwide, with ten million copies sold in the United States, and was one of the first albums on the label to be RIAA–certified diamond.

<text>Earl of Charleville was a title that was created twice in the Peerage of Ireland. The first creation came in 1758 when Charles Moore, 2nd Baron Moore, was made Earl of Charleville, in the King&#x27;s County. The title Baron Moore, of Tullamore in the King&#x27;s County, was created in the Peerage of Ireland in 1715 for his father John Moore, who had previously represented King&#x27;s County in the Irish House of Commons. Lord Charleville was childless and the titles became extinct on his death in 1764.

The second creation came in the Peerage of Ireland in 1806 in favour of Charles Bury, 1st Viscount Charleville. He had already been created Baron Tullamore, of Charleville Forest in the King&#x27;s County, in 1797, and Viscount Charleville, of Charleville Forest in the King&#x27;s County, in 1800, also in the Peerage of Ireland. Lord Charleville was the grandson of William Bury and the Honourable Jane Moore, daughter of the first Baron Moore and sister of the first Earl of the first creation. His father John Moore had succeeded to the Charleville estates on the death of his maternal uncle in 1764. In 1801 Lord Charleville was elected an Irish representative peer. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He was a Tory politician and sat as an Irish Representative Peer between 1838 and 1851. The title descended from father to son until the early death of his grandson, the fourth Earl, in 1874. The late Earl was succeeded by his uncle, the fifth Earl. The fifth Earl was childless and on his death in 1875 the titles became extinct.

Lady Emily Alfreda Julia Bury, daughter of the third Earl, married Kenneth Howard, son of the Honourable James Howard. She succeeded to the Charleville estates, Charleville Castle, on the death of her brother the fifth Earl in 1875 and in 1881 she and her husband assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Bury. Their son was the explorer and Conservative politician Charles Howard-Bury.

<text>The Royal Philatelic Collection is the postage stamp collection of the British royal family. It is the most comprehensive collection of items related to the philately of the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth, with many unique pieces. Of major items, only the British Guiana 1c magenta is missing from the collection of British Imperial stamps.

In 2020, the value of the collection was estimated by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; to be £100 million.

== Early history ==
Some members of the royal family are known to have been collecting stamps by 1864, just under twenty-five years after their introduction in 1840. The first serious collector in the family was Prince Alfred, who sold his collection to his older brother Edward, Prince of Wales, who in turn gave it to his son, later George V.

==George V==

George V was one of the notable philatelists of his day. In 1893, as the Duke of York, he was elected honorary vice-president of what became the Royal Philatelic Society of London. On his marriage that year, fellow members of the society gave him an album of nearly 1,500 postage stamps as a wedding present. He expanded the collection with a number of high-priced purchases of rare stamps and covers. His 1904 purchase of the Mauritius two pence blue for £1,450 set a new record for a single stamp. A courtier asked the prince if he had seen &quot;that some damned fool had paid as much as £1,400 for one stamp&quot;. &quot;Yes,&quot; George replied. &quot;I was that damned fool!&quot;

George V had the collection housed in 328 so-called &quot;Red Albums&quot;, each of about 60 pages. Later additions included a set of &quot;Blue Albums&quot; for the reign of George VI and &quot;Green Albums&quot; for those of Elizabeth II.

==Management of the collection==
The collection was kept at Buckingham Palace until it was moved to St James&#x27;s Palace, also in London. In 1952, a catalogue of the collection was published, prepared by Sir John Wilson, and edited by Clarence Winchester. It was available in a deluxe leather-bound edition or a regular cloth-bound edition.

Items from the Royal Philatelic Collection have been regularly shown to the public by the Royal Philatelic Society London or are lent to international philatelic exhibitions.

The Privy Purse and Treasurer&#x27;s Office has overall responsibility for the Collection, as a department of the Royal Household.

== Keepers and curators ==
Since the 1890s, successive monarchs have employed curators to assist with the management of the collection.

John Tilleard was the first person to manage the collection from the 1890s until his death in 1913, with the title of &quot;Philatelist to the King&quot;. Tilleard was followed by Edward Denny Bacon who became &quot;curator&quot; of the collection from 1913 to 1938, when he died just prior to retirement. He started to organize the collection in a comprehensive manner. Bacon was succeeded by John Wilson, then president of Royal Philatelic Society London, with the title of &quot;keeper&quot; and served until 1969. He introduced the coloured albums to keep intact the work of Bacon. He prepared the first loans for exhibitions after World War II.

The last three keepers of the Royal Philatelic Collection have been John Marriott (1969–1995), Charles Wyndham Goodwyn (1995–2002), and Michael Sefi from 1 January 2003 to 2018. 

There has been no official keeper since 2019, when the Collection was moved back to Buckingham Palace. It has been kept secure and largely unattended since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We&#x27;re not an acting family, but my parents have always encouraged me. I&#x27;m sure my dad spreads the word about my programmes to everyone who gets in his cab, which must help the ratings!

<text>Terrorism and mass attacks in Canada includes acts of terrorism, as well as mass shootings, vehicle-ramming attacks, mass stabbings, and other such acts committed in Canada that people may associate with terroristic tactics but have not been classified as terrorism by the Canadian legal system. (For example, the 2018 Toronto shooting was a mass shooting that law enforcement officials did not connect to terrorism.)

The &quot;Criminal Code&quot; of Canada defines terrorist activity to include an &quot;act or omission undertaken, in or outside Canada, for a political, religious or ideological purpose, that is intended to intimidate the public with regard to its security, including its economic security, or to compel a person, government or organization (whether in or outside Canada) to do or refrain from doing any act, and that intentionally causes one of a number of specific forms of serious harm.&quot; As such, some of the terrorist acts listed here are related to external events and nationalities, while others, such as the FLQ crisis in 1970, are related to internal tensions within the country.

Matters relevant to overall counterterrorism in Canada, as well as national security within the federal government, fall under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, who heads Public Safety Canada (PSC). Two other ministers with particularly crucial roles with respect to counter-terrorism are the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and of National Defence.

The Canadian government uses the National Terrorism Threat Level (NTTL) to identify the probability of terrorism occurring in Canada. , Canada&#x27;s current threat level is &quot;Medium,&quot; which means that a &quot;violent act of terrorism could occur;&quot; it has been at this level since October 2014.

==Overview of legal framework and response==
Overall issues of national security fall under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, who heads Public Safety Canada (PSC). While provincial and territorial governments are responsible for general law enforcement and criminal prosecutions, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (part of the PSC portfolio) is given primary responsibility, under the &quot;Security Offences Act&quot; (SOA), for the investigation of offences involving national security.

Canadian federal statutes establish a legal regime that prosecutes terrorists for their activities. The Public Prosecution Service of Canada (PPSC), under the Attorney General of Canada, prosecutes offenses on behalf of the Canadian government, including those involving national security such as terrorist activities. If a person carries out a terrorist attack or instructs someone else to carry out a terrorist attack, they are given a life sentence. Anyone who facilitates a terrorist attack is liable to imprisonment for no more than 10 years.

The &quot;Criminal Code&quot; defines terrorist activity to include an &quot;act or omission undertaken, in or outside Canada, for a political, religious or ideological purpose, that is intended to intimidate the public with regard to its security, including its economic security, or to compel a person, government or organization (whether in or outside Canada) to do or refrain from doing any act, and that intentionally causes one of a number of specific forms of serious harm.&quot;

The &quot;Combating Terrorism Act&quot;, which came into force in July 2013, renewed parts of the Criminal Code by creating four new offences intended to prevent and deter individuals from leaving Canada for particular terrorism-related purposes.

Canada&#x27;s &quot;Anti-Terrorism Act&quot; (ATA) &quot;provides measures for the Government of Canada to create a list of entities that: have knowingly carried out, attempted to carry out, participated in or facilitated a terrorist activity&quot; or &quot;knowingly acted on behalf of, at the direction of or in association with an entity that has knowingly carried out, attempted to carry out, participated in or facilitated a terrorist activity.&quot; The Act specifically provides that &quot;for the Governor in Council to establish by regulation a list on which, on the recommendation of the Minister of Public Safety, any entity may be placed.&quot; The ATA replaced the &quot;Official Secrets Act&quot; with the &quot;Security of Information Act&quot; (SOIA), which focuses on &quot;conduct harmful to, or likely to harm Canada.&quot; It also defined the concept of &quot;harm to Canadian interests&quot; to address a broad range of potential harms, including terrorist activity, interference with critical infrastructure, and the development of weapons of mass destruction in contravention of international law.

Terrorist financing, on the other hand, is addressed through the &quot;Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act&quot;, as well as the &quot;Income Tax Act&quot; and the &quot;Charities Registration (Security Information) Act&quot;. In terms of the cross-border movement of potential threats, assessing the admissibility of those applying for temporary or permanent residence, or refugee status is facilitated under the &quot;Immigration and Refugee Protection Act&quot; (IRPA).

The &quot;Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Act&quot; provides the Minister of Foreign Affairs with responsibility over all matters relating to the conduct of Canada&#x27;s external affairs, including countering international terrorism and responding to terrorist incidents abroad. Moreover, the Government of Canada lists state supporters of terrorism under the &quot;State Immunity Act&quot;, which (like the &quot;JVTA&quot;) revokes certain legal immunities from listed countries, allowing civil suits to be filed against those countries in Canadian courts for loss or damage resulting from its involvement in terrorism anywhere in the world. In 2012, both Syria and Iran were listed.

In terms of emergency response, leadership of the Public Safety Minister is granted by the &quot;Emergency Management Act&quot;.

=== Redress ===
The &quot;Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act&quot; (&quot;JVTA&quot;) allows Canada&#x27;s victims of terrorism to sue perpetrators and those that support them for loss or damage that occurred as a result of an act of terrorism committed in Canada or abroad. Similar to the JVTA, amendments made to the &quot;State Immunity Act&quot;, allow for countries listed by the federal government as state supporters of terrorism to be sued in Canadian courts for loss or damage resulting from its involvement in terrorism anywhere in the world.

On 1 May 2006, the Government of Canada announced the launch of a full public inquiry into the Air India Flight 182 bombing and its investigation. Initiated later in June, the inquiry was to look into the ways in which Canadian law restricted funding terrorist groups, how well witness protection is provided in terrorist cases, if Canada needs to upgrade its airport security, and if issues of co-operation between the RCMP, CSIS, and other law enforcement agencies had been resolved. It was to also provide a forum wherein families of the victims could testify on the impact of the bombing and would not repeat any criminal trials.

From 1 December 2011 to 31 July 2012, families of the passengers and crew who died on Air India Flight 182 on 23 June 1985 have been offered a one-time &quot;ex gratia&quot; payment by Canadian government, as &quot;a demonstration of solicitude and recognition for the administrative disdain families experienced in the years following&quot; the tragedy. Payments have been made to eligible applicants for 275 victims. Moreover, every June 23, some Canadians observe National Day of Remembrance for Victims of Terrorism to honour the victims.

=== Emergency response ===
In terms of emergency response, leadership of the Minister of Public Safety is granted by the &quot;Emergency Management Act&quot;. The chief means through which the Public Safety Minister facilitates their emergency response is through the Government Operations Centre (GOC). The GOC, on behalf of the federal government, supports response coordination across the government and others.

In practice, the immediate response to terrorist incidents in Canada is to be led by local law enforcement and emergency management authorities. This involves the RCMP as being the first police responder in those provinces and territories where it provides local police services. Particular terrorist incidents may involve specific responses from designated agencies; for instance, under the &quot;National Defence Act&quot; or through the Crown Prerogative, the Canadian Armed Forces can be called upon to respond directly to terrorist incidents in Canada. As such, the Minister of National Defence plays a key role in preparation for, and execution of, any deployment of Canadian Forces in response to terrorist activity domestically or abroad.

Immediately following the 2001 September 11 attacks in the United States, the RCMP initiated Project Shock which sought to quickly collect and act on any information or intel related to possible threats posed by Muslims in Canada. Project Thread was a police operation in 2003 that resulted in the arrest of 24 immigrants in the Greater Toronto Area amidst allegations that they formed a threat to national security, and maintained &quot;suspected ties to al-Qaeda.&quot;

== Counter-terrorism in Canada ==
Matters relevant to overall counter-terrorism in Canada, as well as national security within the federal government, fall under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, who heads Public Safety Canada (PSC). Two other ministers with particularly crucial roles with respect to counter-terrorism are the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and of National Defence. Additionally, the National Security Advisor (NSA) is responsible for providing information, advice, and recommendations on security and intelligence to the Prime Minister; co-ordinating the security and intelligence community; and overseeing intelligence assessment.

Claiming that the safety and security of Canadians to be its first priority, the Government of Canada puts significant attention towards its counterterrorism efforts. &quot;&quot;&quot;Building Resilience Against Terrorism&quot; (2013) is Canada&#x27;s first counterterrorism strategy, which aims to counter domestic and international terrorism so to protect Canada, Canadians, and Canadian interests. The strategy &quot;assesses the nature and scale of the threat, and &quot;sets out basic principles and elements that underpin the Government&#x27;s counter-terrorism activities.&quot;

The Canadian government uses the National Terrorism Threat Level (NTTL) to identify the probability of terrorism occurring in Canada. , Canada&#x27;s current threat level is &quot;Medium,&quot; which means that a &quot;violent act of terrorism could occur;&quot; it has been at this level since October 2014. More specifically, this means that &quot;extremist groups and individuals located in Canada and abroad, have both the intent AND capability to carry out an act of terrorism in Canada.&quot;

=== Counter-terrorism organizations and jurisdictions ===
Federal government organizations that have a hand in counterterrorism in Canada include:

* Canadian Security Intelligence Service (part of Public Safety Canada)
** CSIS Global Operations Centre (CGOC)
** Integrated Terrorism Assessment Centre (ITAC)
* Department of National Defence/Canadian Armed Forces
** Canada Command — provides coordination with other federal departments and agencies, as well as domestic and international partners, in responding to national security events.
** Communications Security Establishment
*** Canadian Centre for Cyber Security — a national center for &quot;cyber security readiness and response, exclusive of federal government information technology and information management systems&quot;
** Defence Research and Development Canada
***Centre for Security Science
**Joint Task Force 2 (JTF 2) — a special forces unit of the Canadian Special Operations Forces Command, that exists to &quot;protect the Canadian national interests and combat terrorism and threats to Canadians at home and abroad.&quot;
* Royal Canadian Mounted Police (part of Public Safety Canada) — the primary agency responsible for national security law enforcement across Canada. The RCMP also conducts extraterritorial investigations of terrorist activity when committed against a Canadian citizen or by a Canadian citizen abroad. Among other things, the RCMP also operates:
** Counter-terrorism Information Officer initiative — provides first responders with &quot;terrorism awareness training on key indicators of terrorist activities, techniques and practices in order to help detect threats at the earliest stage possible.&quot;
** Integrated National Security Enforcement Teams (INSETs)
** National Operations Centre — a secure and integrated 24/7 command and control centre for centralized monitoring and coordination during &quot;critical incidents and major events&quot;
*Government Operations Centre (part of Public Safety Canada) — the chief means through which the Minister of Public Safety facilitates their emergency response. On behalf of the federal government, the Centre supports response coordination across the government and others.

In terms of broader counterterrorism intelligence, other federal organizations also collect information in support of their primary responsibilities; this includes:

* Canada Border Services Agency (part of Public Safety Canada)
* Global Affairs Canada
* Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre
* Transport Canada
** Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA)
* Charities Directorate (Canada Revenue Agency)

==== Intelligence assessment ====
The Canadian Security Intelligence Service, part of Public Safety Canada, is Canada&#x27;s primary national intelligence agency. Among other things, CSIS compiles the information they collect themselves with information from other sources to provide Parliament with intelligence assessments on terrorist threats. The National Security Advisor (NSA) is responsible for providing information, advice, and recommendations on security and intelligence to the Prime Minister; co-ordinating the security and intelligence community; and overseeing intelligence assessment.

The Integrated Terrorism Assessment Centre (ITAC) is a cooperative initiative, housed at CSIS, to facilitate intelligence information sharing and analysis within the Canadian intelligence community and to first responders, such as law enforcement. Its assessments integrate intelligence from across departments and agencies as well as from external partners. Similarly, the RCMP&#x27;s Integrated National Security Enforcement Teams (INSETs) bring together federal, provincial, and municipal police and intelligence resources &quot;to collect, share, and analyze information in support of criminal investigations and threat assessments.&quot;

The Communications Security Establishment, administered under the Department of National Defence (DND), is responsible for foreign signals intelligence (SIGINT) and protecting government electronic communication networks.

The Privy Council Office&#x27;s Security and Intelligence Secretariat provides policy support to the NSA, the Prime Minister, and the Clerk of the Privy Council, as well as coordinating committees on security and intelligence issues. The PCO&#x27;s International Assessment Staff (PCO IAS) helps to coordinate &quot;the efforts of the Canadian assessment community and provides PCO and other senior government clients with policy-neutral assessments of foreign developments and trends that may affect Canadian interests.&quot;

==== Terrorist financing ====
Terrorist financing in Canada is addressed through the &quot;Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act&quot; (&quot;PCMLTFA&quot;), as well as the &quot;Income Tax Act&quot; and the &quot;Charities Registration (Security Information) Act&quot;, which are administered by the Department of Finance.

In accordance with the &quot;PCMLTFA&quot;, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre works to prevent and deter terrorist financing. Likewise, the Charities Directorate of the Canada Revenue Agency reviews applications, conducts audits, and collects and analyzes multi-source intelligence in order to detect and address risks to Canada&#x27;s charitable sector. These operations are in accordance with the &quot;Income Tax Act&quot;, the &quot;Charities Registration (Security Information) Act&quot;, and the &quot;PCMLTFA&quot;.

The Finance Department also leads the Canadian effort in related international activities, particularly regarding the work of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

==== Border and transportation security ====
Measures taken in regards to cross-border movement of potential threats are facilitated under the &quot;Immigration and Refugee Protection Act&quot; (&quot;IRPA&quot;), primarily by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) and Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).

The CBSA, which is a part of Public Safety Canada, has an &quot;Immigration Security Screening&quot; program, which can &quot;detect the movement of potential subjects of interest as they apply for temporary or permanent residence, or refugee status,&quot; as per &quot;IRPA.&quot; CBSA also monitors the cross-border flow of currency, and has the authority to seize &quot;unreported currency flows suspected of being the proceeds of crime or related to terrorist financing.&quot;

Under &quot;IRPA&quot;, the Canadian government uses security certificates to detain and deport foreign nationals and all other non-citizens living in Canada. The certificate can be issued towards a permanent resident or any other non-citizen perceived to be a threat to national security, as well as those suspected of violating human rights or of having membership within organized crime.

The security of transportation systems are primarily facilitated by Transport Canada, which is the lead department for responding to transportation security incidents and for transportation-related emergency preparedness. This includes the security of aviation, marine, rail, road, and intermodal transportation security systems. Transport Canada&#x27;s responsibilities are granted through several key federal statutes, such as the &quot;Aeronautics Act&quot;, the &quot;Marine Transportation Security Act&quot;, the &quot;Railway Safety Act&quot;, the &quot;International Bridges and Tunnels Act&quot; and the &quot;Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act&quot;.

Public Safety Canada and Transport Canada jointly oversee the Canadian no-fly list, called the Passenger Protect program, which identifies individuals who may pose a threat to aviation security and &quot;reduces their ability to cause harm or threaten aviation by taking action, such as preventing them from boarding an aircraft.&quot; Additional security is provided through passenger and baggage screening, which is conducted by Transport Canada&#x27;s Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA).

==== International and extraterritorial security ====
The &quot;Combating Terrorism Act&quot;, which came into force in July 2013, was put in place with the intent to prevent and deter individuals from leaving Canada for particular terrorism-related purposes.

The &quot;Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Act&quot; provides the Minister of Foreign Affairs with responsibility over all matters relating to the conduct of Canada&#x27;s external affairs, including countering international terrorism and responding to terrorist incidents abroad. As such, the Foreign Affairs Minister leads Canada&#x27;s response to terrorist or security-related incidents outside of the country. Global Affairs Canada is accordingly responsible for assessing social, economic, security, and political developments that &quot;help define a global threat environment.&quot; Depending on the nature of the incident, the Canadian response can include the provision of consular assistance to Canadians overseas (including expatriates); financial or physical aid; or deployments of experts from Canada&#x27;s national security community.

Extraterritorial investigations of terrorist activity are investigated by the RCMP (part of Public Safety Canada) when committed against a Canadian citizen or by a Canadian citizen abroad.

Various federal organizations, particularly the Canada Centre for Community Engagement and Prevention of Violence (Canada Centre; also part of Public Safety Canada), closely collaborate with partners in the Five Eyes (United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand), the Group of Seven (G7), and the European Union. The Canada Centre also actively participates in multilateral forums such as the United Nations and the Global Counterterrorism Forum (GCTF), as well as collaborating with the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, the Hedayah Center, and the Centre for Research and Evidence on Security Threats (CREST).

The Canadian government also engages in the Global Coalition against Daesh, a partnership of 79 countries that works towards defeating Daesh through such activities as preventing the flow of foreign terrorist fighters across borders and countering the group&#x27;s communications.

==== Biosecurity ====
In terms of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear warfare, the surveillance for diseases and events resulting from the use of CBRNE agents is the responsibility of Public Health Agency of Canada, who is in charge of coordinating a public health response to such a terrorist incident. Monitoring services, hazard assessments, information, and advisories and decontamination strategies are also provided by Health Canada for CBRNE events. PHAC also maintains the National Emergency Stockpile System, which contains medical countermeasures against CBRNE agents and disaster medical supplies for use in mass-casualty incidents.

Moreover, all members of the Canadian Forces are trained in CBRNE defense. The Canadian Joint Incident Response Unit is a unit under the direction of the Canadian Special Operations Forces Command that is tasked with supporting the federal government in preventing, controlling, and mitigating CBRN threats to Canada, Canadians, and Canadian interests.

Health Canada is also mandated to provide services to support the overall security objectives for major international events (such as the 2010 Winter Olympics or G20 summit), specifically in the areas of health and safety of federal government employees, surveillance and response to radiological nuclear threats, and support to first-responders in the event of a CBRNE event or disease outbreak.

=== Designated organizations ===

The government of Canada has banned more than 52 terrorist organizations. These include Al Qaeda, the Armed Islamic Group, Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA), Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), the International Sikh Youth Federation, the Palestine Liberation Front, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah, Kahane Chai, and the Taliban. In 2019, Combat 18 and Blood &amp; Honour were the first neo-Nazi groups in Canada to be banned by the government.

In April 2006, the Canadian government designated the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam as a terrorist group. In December that year, the government expanded the federal ban of Hezbollah from the purely militant wing to all 16 sub-organizations.

== Research on extremism in Canada ==
The Kanishka Project was a  million, five-year initiative of Public Safety Canada that provided funding to research on terrorism-related matters affecting Canada.

Announced by the Government of Canada in June 2011, the Project was named after the Boeing 747-237B (&quot;Emperor Kanishka&quot;) plane that was bombed in the Air India Flight 182 attack of 1985. It funded nearly 70 projects and contributed to hosting various events related to discussing counter-terrorism. As part of the Project, $3.7 million was invested with Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) towards supporting research and related activities that addressed the issues identified by the Kanishka Project.

The Canadian Network for Research on Terrorism, Security and Society (TSAS), located at the University of Waterloo, is an academic research network purposed to form &quot;multidisciplinary research on terrorist radicalization&quot; and &quot;the coordinated interaction of academic researchers with government officials.&quot; It was created in 2012 with funding both the Kanishka Project and a grant from the SSHRC. TSAS&#x27; co-directors are Lorne Dawson and Veronica Kitchen.

== Radicalization in Canada ==
The &quot;Constitution of Canada&quot;, through the &quot;Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, protects the freedom of thought, belief, opinion, and expression of Canadians. As a result, having radical ideals is not considered to be illegal in Canada.

In terms of radicalization to violence, various federal and provincial/territorial government initiatives have been established, particularly under Public Safety Canada on the federal level. Particularly, the Canada Centre for Community Engagement and Prevention of Violence (Canada Centre) leads the Canadian government&#x27;s efforts to &quot;counter radicalization to violence.&quot; It does not manage or advise on individual cases, but rather addresses the issue in terms of broad strategy. The Centre was mandated in 2015; the federal budget the following year allocated $35 million over five years to establish and support the Centre, in addition to $10 million per year on-going. The Canada Centre also leads the Canadian government&#x27;s engagement and cooperation with the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT), established by Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Microsoft in 2017.

On 11 December 2018, the Canada Centre launched the &quot;National Strategy on Countering Radicalization to Violence,&quot; which is meant to &quot;explain[] radicalization to violence and the destructive and harmful behaviours involved,&quot; as well as outlining the federal government&#x27;s &quot;approach and key priorities in countering and preventing radicalization to violence.&quot; Implementation of the National Strategy is supervised by the National Expert Committee on Countering Radicalization to Violence.

The Community Resilience Fund (CRF) is a system, administered by the Canada Centre, for supporting &quot;partnerships in countering radicalization to violence in Canada,&quot; providing funding to organizations towards engagement (e.g., research, cooperation, engaging communities, etc.) with the issue. As of 2019‑2020 onward, the Fund has been promised $7 million available each year for existing and new projects. Through CRF, the Canada Centre has supported the Centre for the Prevention of Radicalization Leading to Violence, located in Montréal, in conducting research on &quot;better understanding risk and protective factors within families of individuals who radicalize to violence and also the role families and communities can play in mitigating radicalization to violence.&quot; Also through the Fund, the Canada Centre has supported &quot;multi-agency intervention programs to build capacity to manage cases of individuals who are radicalizing to violence.&quot;

=== Counter-radicalization programs ===
A number of government departments deliver &quot;social programming that contribute&quot; to supporting approaches &quot;to preventing radicalization to violence&quot;. Such federal departments include:

* Royal Canadian Mounted Police — First Responders Terrorism Awareness Program
* Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada — Settlement Program, and Resettlement Assistance Program
* Defence Research and Development Canada, Centre for Security Science — Canadian Safety and Security Program
* Global Affairs Canada — Anti-Crime Capacity Building Program, and the Counter-Terrorism Capacity Building Program
* Department of Justice Canada — Victims Fund
* Canadian Heritage — Community Support, Multiculturalism, and Anti-Racism Initiatives Program
* Status of Women Canada — Strategy to Prevent and Address Gender-Based Violence

Local government/non-profit initiatives funded by the Community Resilience Fund include:

* Furthering Our Communities by Uniting Services (FOCUS) Toronto — a program led by the Toronto Police Service, City of Toronto, and United Way Toronto and York Region, which is &quot;building capacity to add radicalization to violence to the range of issues&quot; that it addresses.
* Ottawa Multiagency Early Risk Intervention Tables (MERIT) — a collaborative intervention program supported by the Ottawa Police Service, local agencies, and service partners that is &quot;building capacity to address cases of individuals radicalizing to violence,&quot; in addition to its existing capabilities.
* Edmonton Resiliency Project — a &quot;collaborative approach&quot; delivered by the Edmonton Police Service, City of Edmonton, and Organization for the Prevention of Violence &quot;to prevention and intervention that draws on trusted community and organizational relationships to prevent violent extremism.&quot;
* Calgary Re-Direct — a partnership between the City of Calgary, Community and Neighbourhood Services, the Calgary Police Service, and others that &quot;uses a multidisciplinary approach to intervention with youth and young adults who are vulnerable to radicalization to violence.&quot;
* Social Polarizations — a team of mental-health professionals who specialize in interventions to counter radicalization to violence, based in a local Integrated Health and Social Services Centre in Quebec.
* Centre for the Prevention of Radicalization Leading to Violence (CPRLV; often called the Montreal Centre)
* John Howard Society of Ottawa

==List of international threats and attacks==
== List of domestic threats and attacks ==
=== Suspected terrorism ===

* March 5, 2015 — While new anti-terrorism law was under consideration and months before federal election, four Conservative Party Members of Parliament (Denis Lebel, Steven Blaney, Christian Paradis and Maxime Bernier) in Quebec received letters with white powder (Anthrax hoaxes) and message &quot;&quot;Conservateurs, vous serez anéantis&quot;,&quot; which translates to &quot;Conservatives, you will be annihilated&quot; at their constituency offices.

== Terrorism abroad ==
Canadian victims of non-Canada-related extremism abroad include:

* September 11, 2001– 9/11 attacks (USA): United Airlines Flight 175 and American Airlines Flight 11 were purposefully crashed into the World Trade Center in New York City, killing 2,606 people, including Garnet Bailey (53), a Canadian professional ice hockey player and scout who was a member of Stanley Cup and Memorial Cup winning teams.
*August 19, 2003– Canal Hotel bombing (Iraq): A suicide truck bombing in Baghdad supposedly carried out by Jama&#x27;at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad killed 22 people, including two Canadians—Christopher Klein-Beekman (31), a UNICEF representative, and Gillian Clark (47), an aid worker for the Christian Children&#x27;s Fund (CCF).
*September 2013– Westgate shopping mall attack (Nairobi, Kenya): An attack carried out by Al-Shabaab killed 68 people, including two Canadians—a businessman and a Government of Canada official.
*June 13, 2016– Killing of Robert Hall (Philippines): On 21 September 2015, Canadian citizen Robert Hall (66) was kidnapped by Abu Sayyaf militants in the Philippines and beheaded nine months later near Patikul, Sulu.
*January 15, 2006– Killing of Glyn Berry (Afghanistan): A car bomb attack in Afghanistan killed Glyn Berry, the first Canadian diplomat to be killed while on duty in Afghanistan. Two other civilians were killed in the incident and 10 people were wounded, including three Canadian soldiers, MCpl. Paul Franklin, Pte. William Edward Salikin and Cpl. Jeffrey Bailey.

===Extremists with Canadian connections abroad===
The &quot;Combating Terrorism Act&quot;, which came into force in July 2013, was put in place with the intent to prevent and deter individuals from leaving Canada for particular terrorism-related purposes. In 2018, the Canadian government states that there has not been an increase, nor does it expect an increase, in the number of Canadian Extremist Travellers (CETs) who have returned to Canada. The total number of CETs identified by the government includes around 190 individuals who have a nexus to Canada, and near 60 who have returned.

The following are some extremists around the world with Canadian connections.

* Xristos Katsiroubas and Ali Medlej (Algeria) — two high school friends from London, Ontario who went to Morocco in 2011, and then onwards to Mauritania, Niger, and Libya, where they are said to have trained under Algerian terrorist Mokhtar Belmokhtar. Both were killed after taking part in a terrorist attack in the In Amenas hostage crisis in January 2013, which killed 38 hostages at an Algerian gas plant.
* Andre Poulin (Syria) — a man from Timmins, Ontario who subscribed to violent extremist views in 2008. Arriving in Syria in 2012, he is considered to have been killed fighting at the al-Minakh airfield in August 2013.
* Ali Mohamed Dirie (Syria) — a former member of the &quot;Toronto 18&quot; previously imprisoned for plotting terrorist attacks in Ontario. Within a year of his release, Dirie travelled to Syria and joined a terrorist group.
* Damian Clairmont or Mustafa al-Gharib (Syria) — a man from Calgary, Alberta who subscribed to violent extremist views. He is presumed to have been killed in infighting between terrorist groups in Syria.
* Mahad Ali Dhore (Somalia) — a man who crossed into Somalia while visiting Kenya to join an al-Shabaab training camp. He is considered to have been killed while helping conduct an April 2013 terrorist attack in Mogadishu.

<text>Jordan (), officially the Municipality of Jordan (; ), is a municipality and capital of the province of Guimaras, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 39,566 people, making it the third largest settlement in the province.
==History==
The name of the town used to be Nagaba but was changed in 1902 to Jordan. The name &quot;Jordán&quot;, the Spanish name for the Jordan River, was chosen by the residents in honor of John the Baptist, their patron saint. According to local folklore, he saved the inhabitants from slaughter during the Moro raid in the Spanish era.

In 1918, the municipality was formed when it separated from Buenavista, with Valeriano Villanueva as the first appointed &quot;Presidente Municipal&quot;. After elections in 1919, Hugo Chávez became the next mayor, followed by Licerio Segovia (1921-1923), Alberto Gonzaga (1923-1925), Feliz Ronzales (1925-1928), Hilario Nava (1929-1932), again Hugo Chávez (1932-1938), and Leodegario Galarpe (1939-1941).

Nueva Valencia was established as a separate municipality in 1941. In July 1995 San Lorenzo and Sibunag were created, leaving Jordan with only 14 barangays. Before these two towns was created, Jordan was composed of 33 barangays.

==Geography==
Jordan is bounded by the three municipalities of the province, Buenavista to the north, San Lorenzo to the east, and Sibunag to the south.

Jordan is a part of the Metro Iloilo–Guimaras area, centered on Iloilo City.

With a wharf closest to Iloilo City and a central location, Jordan is also the commercial center of the island.

<text>Viscount O&#x27;Neill, of Shane&#x27;s Castle in the County of Antrim, was a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1795 for John O&#x27;Neill, 1st Baron O&#x27;Neill, who had earlier represented Randalstown and County Antrim in the Irish House of Commons. He had already been created Baron O&#x27;Neill, of Shane&#x27;s Castle in the County of Antrim, in 1793, also in the Peerage of Ireland. He died in 1798 and was succeeded by his son, the second Viscount. In 1800 he was created Viscount Raymond and Earl O&#x27;Neill in the Peerage of Ireland. The same year he was elected as one of the original 28 Irish representative peer. The viscountcy of Raymond and earldom became extinct on his death in 1841. The barony and viscountcy of O&#x27;Neill were passed on to his only brother, the third Viscount. These titles became extinct on the latter&#x27;s death in 1855. The late Viscount&#x27;s estates were inherited by his cousin, the Reverend William Chichester, who assumed the surname of O&#x27;Neill in lieu of Chichester the same year. In 1868, the O&#x27;Neill title was revived when he was created Baron O&#x27;Neill. This title is still extant.

The family seat was Shane&#x27;s Castle, County Antrim.

<text>Earl of Bandon was a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1800 for Francis Bernard, 1st Viscount Bandon, son of politician James Bernard. Francis Bernard had already been created Baron Bandon, of Bandon Bridge in the County of Cork, in 1793, Viscount Bandon, of Bandon Bridge in the County of Cork, in 1795, and was made Viscount Bernard at the same time as he was granted the earldom. These titles were also in the Peerage of Ireland. 

The titles descended from father to son until the death of his great-grandson, James, the fourth Earl, in 1924. The late Earl was succeeded by his first cousin twice removed, Percy Bernard, the fifth Earl. The latter was the great-grandson of the Right Reverend Charles Bernard, Bishop of Tuam, younger son of the second Earl. The fifth Earl was an Air Chief Marshal in the Royal Air Force. He had two daughters but no sons and on his death in 1979 the titles became extinct.

Francis Bernard, great-grandfather of the first Earl, was a lawyer and politician while Francis&#x27; younger brother Arthur is the 7th-great-grandfather of Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada. 

The family seat of the Earls of Bandon was Castle Bernard, County Cork, in the Republic of Ireland. Castle Bernard itself was destroyed as a result of an IRA attack in 1921, when the 4th earl was abducted for 10 days, and now stands as a ruin. The family later built a new home on the estate, which remained in the ownership of Lady Jennifer Bernard (1935–2010), the elder daughter of the late 5th and last Earl of Bandon by his first wife, until her death. The Castle Bernard estate is owned by Lady Frances Carter (b. 1943), the younger sister of the late Lady Jennifer Bernard.

==Earls of Bandon (1800)==
*Francis Bernard, 1st Earl of Bandon (1755–1830) (elected an Irish representative peer in 1800)

<text>Earl of Leitrim was a title in the Peerage of Ireland.

==History==

The earldom of Leitrim was created in 1795 for Robert Clements, 1st Viscount Leitrim. He had already been created Baron Leitrim, of Manor Hamilton in the County of Leitrim, in 1783, and Viscount Leitrim in 1793, also in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1800 he was elected as one of the 28 original Irish representative peer. Lord Leitrim was the son of the influential politician and financier Nathaniel Clements. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He was created Baron Clements, of Kilmacrenan in the County of Donegal, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1831, which gave him and his descendants an automatic seat in the House of Lords. His eldest son Robert Clements, Viscount Clements, represented County Leitrim in Parliament. However, he predeceased his father, unmarried. Lord Leitrim was succeeded by his second son, the third Earl. He also sat as Member of Parliament for County Leitrim. A deeply unpopular landlord, Lord Leitirim was instructed to arm himself for protection and to be in the company of a strong bodyguard. Lord Leitrim was killed near Milford in the north of County Donegal in the west of Ulster, along with his clerk and driver, by three men named Neil Shiels, Michael McElwee and Michael Heraghty, not far from his residence near Carrigart, in 1878. All three men where from Ballywhoriskey, McElwee went to America and Shiels was never caught. Heraghty didn&#x27;t dispose of the gun properly which was later found along with other belongings with his daughter&#x27;s name on them, he was tried and went to jail but later freed.

He was unmarried and was succeeded by his nephew, the fourth Earl. He was the son of the Reverend the Hon. Francis Nathanial Clements, fifth and youngest son of the second Earl. Lord Leitrim served in the Royal Navy. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the fifth Earl. He served as Lord-Lieutenant of the City of Londonderry. He was twice married but childless. As Lord Leitrim&#x27;s two younger brothers had both died unmarried before him the titles became extinct on his death in 1952.

The Honourable Charles Clements, third son of the second Earl, was Member of Parliament for County Leitrim. Henry Clements, brother of the first Earl, represented Cavan Borough in the Irish House of Commons. Theophilus Clements, uncle of the first Earl, represented County Cavan in the Irish Parliament. The heir apparent to the earldom used the invented courtesy title Viscount Clements.

===Family residences===

The family seat of the Earls of Leitrim was Lough Rynn House, near Mohill, County Leitrim. Lough Rynn House has recently been restored and currently functions as a luxury hotel and resort, renamed as Lough Rynn Castle. The 4th and 5th Earls of Leitrim, however, used mainly Mulroy House, near Carrigart in the north of County Donegal, as their residence.

Their Dublin city residence was located at 40 Upper Sackville Street. In 1807, the house was sold to Josiah Wedgwood II and in later years became a hotel named the Leitrim House Hotel in honour of the Earl. The family also had a London home in Grosvenor Square.

<doc id="936600" wikidata="Q5326271" url="?curid=936600" title="Earl of Ely">
<text>Earl of Ely is a title that has been created three times in the Peerage of Ireland for members of the Loftus family. This family descended from Nicholas Loftus, 1st Viscount Loftus, who was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Loftus, of Loftus Hall in the County of Wexford, in 1751. In 1756 he was further honoured when he was made Viscount Loftus, of Ely in the County of Wicklow. He was succeeded by his son, Nicholas, the second Viscount. He had previously represented Fethard in the Irish House of Commons. In 1766 he was created Earl of Ely in the Peerage of Ireland. Lord Ely assumed the additional surname of Hume. He was succeeded by his son, Nicholas, the second Earl. He represented both Fethard and Bannow in the Irish Parliament.

The earldom became extinct on his early death in 1769 while he was succeeded in the barony and viscountcy by his uncle, Henry, the fourth Viscount. He represented Bannow and County Wexford in the Irish House of Commons. In 1771 the earldom was revived when he was created Earl of Ely in the Peerage of Ireland. However, all three titles became extinct on his death in 1783. He devised his estates to his nephew Charles Tottenham, who assumed the surname of Loftus in lieu of his patronymic and was created Baron Loftus in 1789, Viscount Loftus in 1789, Earl of Ely in 1794 and Marquess of Ely in 1800. See the latter title for more information on these peerages. 

The title refers to Ely in County Wicklow, not to the English city of Ely, Cambridgeshire; the second syllable is pronounced to rhyme with &quot;lie&quot; rather than &quot;lee&quot; (and so the title is pronounced in the same way as the first name Eli).

<text>Vladimir Vladimirovich Parfenovich (; , ; born 2 December 1958) is a retired Belarusian sprint canoer and politician.

==Sport==
Parfenovich competed for the Soviet Union at the Moscow Olympics and became the first canoer to win all three events he entered: K-1 500 m, K-2 500 m and K-2 1000 m. He also won twelve medals at the ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships, with nine golds (K-1 500 m: 1979, 1981–1983; K-2 500 m: 1979, 1981, 1982; K-2 1000 m: 1981, 1982) and three silvers (K-1 500 m: 1978, K-2 500 m: 1983, K-2 1000 m: 1983).

Parfenovich retired from competitions after learning that the 1984 will be boycotted by the Soviet Union. He then worked as an instructor for the Sport ministry of Belarus and served in the KGB and police forces. In 1995–2007 he headed the Canoe-Kayak Federation of Belarus and was a member of the Belarus Olympic Committee. After that he trained canoers in Russia, and in 2013 became head coach of the Russian team.

==Politics==
In 2000, he entered politics and was elected to the National Assembly of the Republic of Belarus. He joined the parliamentary group Respublika that opposed the government of Alexander Lukashenko. On 3 June 2004, Parfenovich and two other members of parliament, general Valery Fralou and Siarhiej Skrabiec, started a hunger strike, arguing that the chair of the parliament did not give them the chance for debate and did not put to vote their proposed amendments to the election code. They stopped the strike on 21 June, when parliament voted against their proposals.

<text>Kudos is a British film and television production company. It has produced television series for the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Sky, Amazon and Netflix and its productions include &quot;Tin Star, Humans, Broadchurch, The Tunnel&quot;, &quot;Grantchester, Apple Tree Yard, Utopia,&quot; &quot;Spooks&quot; (US: &quot;MI5&quot;), &quot;Hustle&quot; and &quot;Life on Mars/Ashes to Ashes.&quot; In 2007 it was voted Best Independent Production Company by &quot;Broadcast&quot; magazine. Formed in 1992, since 2007 it has been part of the Shine Group. In 2007 it also set up the film unit, Kudos Pictures. In 2011, the Shine Group was 100% acquired by News Corporation and was part of the 50–50 joint-venture Endemol Shine Group in 2015. On 3 July 2020, France-based Banijay bought the studio through former&#x27;s acquisition of Endemol Shine Group.

==History==
The company was formed in 1992. It came to international attention with the BAFTA Award-winning spy drama &quot;Spooks&quot;, which debuted on BBC One on 13 May 2002.

In late 2006, the company was sold to Shine Limited for around £35m. Shine also bought Princess Productions and Dragonfly Film and Television Productions to create the Shine Group, although all four divisions retained their individual identity.

With three British films already in production, and ten in development, in June 2007 the company announced plans to set up a film unit, with &quot;Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day&quot; (2008) expected to be its first release. It planned to mix and match actors, writers and directors between the units, and already had Hollywood deals for film remakes of &quot;Hustle&quot;, &quot;Spooks&quot; and &quot;Tsunami: The Aftermath&quot;.

In 2015, it was included in a 50–50% joint venture between 21st Century Fox and Apollo Global Management&#x27;s Endemol and CORE Media Group, as Endemol Shine Group.

In November 2015, Endemol Shine Group announced that their two labels Shine Pictures and Lovely Day would officially become part of Endemol Shine UK&#x27;s Kudos label by absorbing the two labels together as part of their restructure.

<text>Earl of Desart was a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1793 for Otway Cuffe, 1st Viscount Desart. He had already succeeded his elder brother as third Baron Desart in 1767 and been created Viscount Desart, in the County of Kilkenny, in the Peerage of Ireland in 1781. He was also made Viscount Castlecuffe in the Peerage of Ireland at the same time as he was granted the earldom. He later sat in the House of Lords between 1800 and 1804 as one of the 28 original Irish representative peer. Lord Desart was the younger son of John Cuffe, who represented Thomastown in the Irish House of Commons between 1715 and 1727. In 1733 he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Desart, in the County of Kilkenny.

The first Earl was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He sat as Member of Parliament for Bossiney between 1809 and 1817. On his early death the titles passed to his son, the third Earl. He served as Under-Secretary of State for War and the Colonies between March and December 1852 in the Earl of Derby&#x27;s first administration. His younger son, the fifth Earl (who succeeded his elder brother in 1898, was a prominent lawyer and notably served as Queen&#x27;s Proctor between 1894 and 1909 and as Director of Public Prosecutions between 1894 and 1908. In 1909 he was created Baron Desart, of Desart in the County of Kilkenny, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Lord Desart had no sons and on his death in 1934 all his titles became extinct. His daughter Lady Sybil Cuffe was the mother of the writer Iris Origo through her first husband William Bayard Cutting Jr., an American with Dutch and Huguenot ancestry who was the secretary to the U.S. embassy to the Court of St. James&#x27;s and whose father was a successful American merchant.
The family seat was Desart Court, County Kilkenny, in the Republic of Ireland. The manor house itself was burnt down in the early 1920s as a result of an IRA attack.

<doc id="936620" wikidata="Q7263254" url="?curid=936620" title="Pyramid Lake (Los Angeles County, California)">
<text>Pyramid Lake is a reservoir formed by Pyramid Dam on Piru Creek in the eastern Topatopa Mountains, near Castaic, Southern California. It is a part of the West Branch California Aqueduct, which is a part of the California State Water Project. Its water is fed by the system after being pumped up from the San Joaquin Valley and through the Tehachapi Mountains.

==Background==
This lake was created in 1972, and completed in 1973, as a holding reservoir for the California State Water Project. The lake was named after a pyramid-shaped rock carved out by engineers building U.S. Route 99. Travelers between Los Angeles and Bakersfield christened the landmark “Pyramid Rock,” which still stands just adjacent to the dam.

The earth and rock dam was built by the California Department of Water Resources and was completed in 1973. Pyramid Lake is part of the California Aqueduct, which is part of the California State Water Project. Outflow goes downstream to Castaic Lake, which is the terminus of this West Branch aqueduct line.

Pyramid and Castaic lakes act as the upper and lower reservoirs for the Castaic Power Plant, a 1,495 megawatt pumped storage hydroelectric plant located at Castaic Lake. The plant generates electricity from the water that flows down from Pyramid Lake to Castaic Lake, and can store energy by pumping water in the reverse direction when desired.

Its name comes from the Pyramid Rock, created when a ridge was cut through in 1932 by the Ridge Route Alternate (US 99). Pyramid Rock still exists directly in front of the dam.

In 1843, gold was discovered near what is now Pyramid Lake, in the Santa Feliciana Canyon, just south of what is now Pyramid Dam. The small find failed to trigger a rush to the mountainous countryside. Only Francisco Lopes, owner of Rancho Temescal, a Mexican land grant, and a handful of ranchers attempted to settle the region.

Pyramid Lake is built up along the steep canyon walls surrounding Piru Creek.

The reservoir lies on the border between the Angeles National Forest and the Los Padres National Forest, in the northwestern portion of Los Angeles County. It is to the west of Interstate 5 (I-5) south of Tejon Pass. The former alignment of US 99 is below the waters here, replaced by I-5.
The lake also lies between the Sierra Pelona and the Topatopa Mountains.
Just below the dam, Piru Creek returns to its natural state as it winds down through the Topatopa Mountains to feed into the Lake Piru reservoir and later the Santa Clara River. Water from Pyramid Lake continues through the Angeles Tunnel to Castaic Lake, which is the terminus of the west branch of the aqueduct.

==Recreation==
Pyramid Lake offers boating, fishing, jet skiing, and picnic areas (including 5 unique sites that are accessible only by boat), and courtesy docks. Vista del Lago Visitors Center overlooks the lake. Access is from exiting Interstate 5 at Vista Del Lago Road (Exit 191).

Fishing is allowed from every location at Pyramid Lake. This includes fish such as large mouth bass, small mouth bass, striped bass, blue gill, crappie, and some trout. The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has developed a safe eating advisory for fish caught in Piru Creek based on levels of mercury or PCBs found in local species.

Access to the lake was temporarily closed in June 2024 due to the impacts of the Post Fire.

<doc id="936623" wikidata="Q16147553" url="?curid=936623" title="List of Olympic medallists for New Zealand">
<text>New Zealand Olympic medallists&#x27; success for New Zealand at the Olympics is often considered to be notable due to the relatively small population of the country ( million as of ). Being located in the remote South Pacific, New Zealanders needed to endure long sea voyages to attend the early Olympics. It was not until the VII Olympiad in 1920 that New Zealand sent its first team. Prior to that, three New Zealanders won medals competing for Australasian teams in 1908 and 1912. On only two occasions since 1920 has New Zealand failed to win a medal at the Summer Olympics, in 1948 at London and in 1980 at Moscow, when only four competitors were sent as a result of the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott.

New Zealand has had a much smaller participation in the Winter Olympics, due to the country&#x27;s temperate climate, not generally experiencing the severe winters to lowland levels, common in many countries in the Northern Hemisphere. The first New Zealand team to attend a Winter Olympics was in 1952. The nation has only won medals at three Winter games, in 1992, 2018 and 2022.

The sporting rivalry between New Zealand and bigger neighbour Australia has been evident at many Olympic Games. In 1984, some Australian media outlets poked fun at the New Zealand gold medallists, saying they had been sitting down on the job at the Los Angeles Games, where they were successful in canoeing, equestrian, rowing and sailing. The New Zealand media pointed out that New Zealand had finished 8th on the final medals table, and Australia only 14th. New Zealand has finished higher than Australia on the medals table at the Summer Olympics only in 1976, when Australia failed to win a gold medal, and Los Angeles in 1984.

==Medallists==
At the 1972 Summer Olympics, Bruce Biddle originally finished fourth in the cycling road race. When the original Bronze medallist was subsequently disqualified for drug usage, Biddle should have been placed third. However he was not awarded the Bronze medal as he had not been asked to take a drugs test. Despite the continued efforts of the New Zealand Olympic Committee, the International Olympic Committee refused to overturn its decision.

<doc id="936624" wikidata="Q2959658" url="?curid=936624" title="Charles Lilley">
<text>Sir Charles Lilley (27 August 1827 – 20 August 1897) was a Premier and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Queensland. He had a significant influence on the form and spirit of state education in colonial Queensland which lasted well into the 20th century.

==Early life==

Lilley was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, the son of Thomas Lilley and his wife Jane, &quot;née&quot; Shipley. Lilley was raised by his maternal grandfather and was educated at St Nicholas Parish School. Intending to study law, Lilley became articled to Newcastle solicitor, William Lockey Harle. Lilley was sent to the London office and studied at University College, London for two years. He gave this up, enlisted in the army and, while stationed at Preston, Lancashire, lectured on temperance and industry. This brought him into disfavour with his superior officers. Lilley spent 28 days in cells on a charge of being absence without leave. Friends purchased his honourable discharge. He remained at Preston and worked on the committee that established the Preston Free Library.

Lilley arrived at Sydney on 6 July 1856. Soon afterwards he travelled to Brisbane, joined the Crown Solicitor&#x27;s Office, and finished his law degree. Thereafter, he took up journalism, acquired an interest in the &quot;Moreton Bay Courier&quot; (later the &quot;Brisbane Courier&quot;), and for two years was its editor.

==Politics==
Lilley was prominent in the movement for separation from New South Wales. After Queensland separated, Lilley was elected by a majority of only three votes as the Member for Hamlet of Fortitude Valley to that state&#x27;s first Legislative Assembly. At the time, Lilley had formed the Queensland Liberal Association in an attempt to introduce political parties to the Legislative Assembly. Lilley held the seat of Fortitude Valley to February 1874, and was then returned for the seat of North Brisbane. 

Lilley was called to the bar in 1861. In September 1865 he succeeded John Bramston as Attorney-General in the first Herbert ministry, and held the same position in the Macalister ministry which succeeded it. On 7 August 1866 he was again appointed Attorney-General for a second term before the ministry was defeated in August 1867. On 25 November 1868 Lilley became Premier of Queensland and served concurrently as Attorney-General, and then Colonial Secretary, for part of his premiership. His most important work as Premier was the introduction of free education in January 1870. Queensland was the first of the Australian colonies to adopt this principle.
As a protest against the monopoly of the A.S.N. Company Lilley ordered three vessels to be constructed for the Queensland government at Sydney. One, the ship &quot;SS Governor Blackall&quot;, designed by Norman Selfe, was built and as a result the A.S.N. Company reduced its charges. Lilley, however, had acted without reference to his colleagues and was censured by all but one of his followers. In May 1870 his party was defeated at the polls, the Palmer ministry succeeding Lilley&#x27;s government. He was elected leader of the opposition. In January 1874, Macalister carried a vote of no confidence in the Government, and offered to stand aside so that Lilley could become Premier. He declined office of any kind, but shortly afterwards accepted the position of acting judge of the Supreme Court of Queensland. He became a puisne judge on 4 July 1874; on 24 June 1879, he succeeded Sir James Cockle as Chief Justice, a position he held until 13 March 1893.

Lilley&#x27;s strong interest in education was a significant factor in the establishment of Brisbane Grammar School where the Lilley Gold Medal and the Lilley Silver Medal are named in his honour. The Lilley Centre opened in 2010 is also named after him. In 1891 he was chairman of a commission investigating the establishment of a university in Brisbane. In 1893, Lilley resigned his position as Chief Justice after Sir Thomas McIlwraith questioned publicly some of Lilley&#x27;s financial transactions, and stood unsuccessfully against McIlwraith in the electorate of Brisbane North.

==Later life==
In January 1881 he was elected president of Brisbane&#x27;s Johnsonian Club. He was knighted in May 1881 and after first declining the honor, he reconsidered and accepted the honour later that year.

Lilley had a severe illness in 1896 and died in 1897.

==Legacy==
The Federal electorate of Lilley is named after him.
There is a statue of Sir Charles Lilley at the Speakers&#x27; Corner in King George Square in Brisbane.

==Family==

Lilley married Sarah Jane Jeays in 1858 and was survived by a large family including:

* Edwyn Mitford (1859–1911)
* Charles Bedell (1860–1918)
* Annie Mary (1862 – ?)
* Walter Preston (1863–1916)
* Harold Bedell (1864–1901)
* Arthur Shipley (1866–1948)

Sir Charles Lilley is the Great Great Grandfather of Comedian and TV Producer Chris Lilley (Summer Heights High, Angry Boys). Christopher Daniel Lilley&#x27;s (1974–) father Ian Hugh Arthur Lilley (1939–1997) was the son of Ian Penfold Lilley (1916–1980) and Grandson of Arthur Shipley Lilley. (1866–1948)

<text>In computer networking, port knocking is a method of externally opening ports on a firewall by generating a connection attempt on a set of prespecified closed ports. Once a correct sequence of connection attempts is received, the firewall rules are dynamically modified to allow the host which sent the connection attempts to connect over specific port(s). A variant called single packet authorization (SPA) exists, where only a single &quot;knock&quot; is needed, consisting of an encrypted packet.

The primary purpose of port knocking is to prevent an attacker from scanning a system for potentially exploitable services by doing a port scan, because unless the attacker sends the correct knock sequence, the protected ports will appear closed.

== Overview ==
Port knocking is usually implemented by configuring a daemon to watch the firewall log file for connection attempts to certain points, and then to modify the firewall configuration accordingly. It can also be performed on the kernel level (using a kernel-level packet filter such as iptables) or by a userspace process examining packets at a higher level (using packet capture interfaces such as pcap), allowing the use of already &quot;open&quot; TCP ports to be used within the knock sequence.

The port &quot;knock&quot; itself is similar to a secret handshake and can consist of any number of TCP, UDP or even sometimes ICMP and other protocol packets to numbered ports on the destination machine. The complexity of the knock can be anything from a simple ordered list (e.g. TCP port 1000, TCP port 2000, UDP port 3000) to a complex time-dependent, source-IP-based and other-factor-based encrypted hash.

A portknock daemon on the firewall machine listens for packets on certain ports (either via the firewall log or by packet capture). The client user would carry an extra utility, which could be as simple as netcat or a modified ping program or as complicated as a full hash-generator, and use that before they attempted to connect to the machine in the usual way.

Most portknocks are stateful systems in that if the first part of the &quot;knock&quot; has been received successfully, an incorrect second part would not allow the remote user to continue and, indeed, would give the remote user no clue as to how far through the sequence they failed. Usually the only indication of failure is that, at the end of the knock sequence, the port expected to be open is not opened. No packets are sent to the remote user at any time.

While this technique for securing access to remote network daemons has not been widely adopted by the security community, it has been actively used in many rootkits even before year 2000.

== Benefits ==
Defeating port knocking protection requires large-scale brute force attacks in order to discover even simple sequences. An anonymous brute force attack against a three-knock TCP sequence (e.g. port 1000, 2000, 3000) would require an attacker to test every three port combination in the 1–65535 range and then scan each port between attacks to uncover any changes in port access on the target system. Since port knocking is by definition stateful, the requested port would not open until the correct three-port number sequence had been received in the correct order and without receiving any other intervening packets from the source. The average case scenario requires approximately 141 trillion (655353 / 2) packets to determine a correct three-port number. This technique, in combination with knock attempt-limiting, longer or more complex sequences and cryptographic hashes, makes successful port access attempts extremely difficult.

Once the successful port knock sequence is supplied to open a port, firewall rules generally only open the port to the IP address that supplied the correct knock, adding dynamic functionality to firewall behaviour. Instead of using a preconfigured static IP whitelist on the firewall, an authorised user situated anywhere in the world would be able to open any necessary port without assistance from the server administrator. The system could also be configured to allow the authenticated user to manually close the port once the session is over or to have it close automatically using a timeout mechanism. To establish a new session, the remote user would be required to reauthenticate using the correct sequence.

The stateful behaviour of port knocking allows several users from different source IP addresses to be at varying levels of port knock authentication simultaneously, allowing a legitimate user with the correct knock sequence through the firewall while the firewall itself is in the middle of a port attack from multiple IP addresses (assuming the bandwidth of the firewall is not completely consumed). From any other attacking IP address, the ports on the firewall will still appear to be closed.

Using cryptographic hashes inside the port knock sequence defends against packet sniffing between the source and target machines, preventing discovery of the port knock sequence or using the information to create traffic replay attacks to repeat prior port knock sequences.

Port knocking is used as part of a defense in depth strategy. Even if the attacker were to successfully gain port access, other port security mechanisms are still in place, along with the assigned service authentication mechanisms on the opened ports.

Implementation of the technique is straightforward, using at the bare minimum a shell script on the server and a Windows batch file or command line utility on the client. Overhead on both the server and client in terms of traffic, CPU and memory consumption is minimal. Port knock daemons are not complex to code, with a low audit burden.

A port knock system implemented on password-authenticated services, like SSH, sidesteps the issue of brute force password attacks on logins. In the case of SSH, the SSH daemon is not activated without the correct port knock, and the attack is filtered by the TCP/IP stack rather than using SSH authentication resources. To the attacker, the daemon is inaccessible until the correct port knock is supplied.

== Security considerations ==
Port knocking is a flexible, customisable system add-in. If the administrator chooses to link a knock sequence to an activity such as running a shell script, other changes such as implementing additional firewall rules to open ports for specific IP addresses can easily be incorporated into the script. Simultaneous sessions are easily accommodated.

By using strategies like dynamic length and pool of length, the probability of hacking knock sequences can be reduced to near zero.

In addition to mitigating brute force password attacks and the inevitable growth in logs associated with the process daemon, port knocking also protects against protocol vulnerability exploits. If an exploit were discovered that could compromise a daemon in its default configuration, using port knocking on the listening port reduces the possibility of compromise until the software or process is updated. Authorized users would continue to be served once they provide the correct knock sequence while random access attempts would be ignored.

Port knocking should only be viewed as part of an overall network defense strategy providing protection against random and targeted attacks, not as complete standalone solution.

Network security professionals have largely ignored port knocking as a solution in the past since early implementations relied solely on providing the correct port combinations to achieve access. Modern port knock systems incorporate features such as secure cryptographic hashes, blacklists, whitelists and dynamic attack responses to further increase system capability. Port knocking is an effective means of maximizing server resources on internet facing networks.

Properly implemented port knocking does not lower the overall security of a system. It is an effective measure that provides an additional layer of security with minimal server resource overhead. At worst, systems such as port knocking introduce new security issues through poor implementation or expose ambivalent administration attitudes through situations such as risk compensation.

== Disadvantages ==
Port knocking is totally dependent on the robustness of the port knocking daemon. The failure of the daemon will deny port access to all users and from a usability and security perspective, this is an undesirable single point of failure. Modern port knocking implementations mitigate this issue by providing a process-monitoring daemon that will restart a failed or stalled port knocking daemon process.

Systems that do not use cryptographic hashes are vulnerable to IP address spoofing attacks. These attacks, a form of Denial of service, use port knocking functionality to lock out known IP addresses (e.g. administrator management stations) by sending packets with the spoofed IP address to random ports. Servers using static addressing are especially vulnerable to these types of denials of service as their addresses are well known.

Port knocking can be problematic on networks exhibiting high latency. Port knocking depends on packets arriving in the correct sequence to access its designed functionality. TCP/IP, on the other hand, is designed to function by assembling out of order packets into a coherent message. In these situations, the only solution is for the client to continue resending the correct sequence of packets on a periodic basis until the sequence is acknowledged by the server.

Port knocking cannot be used as the sole authentication mechanism for a server. From a security perspective, simple port knocking relies on security through obscurity; unintended publication of the knock sequence infers compromise of all devices supporting the sequence. Furthermore, unencrypted port knocking is vulnerable to packet sniffing. A network trace of suitable length can detect the correct knock sequence from a single IP address and thus provide a mechanism for unauthorised access to a server and by extension, the attached network. Once compromised, the log files on the device are a source of other valid knock sequences, revealing another point of failure. Solutions such as treating each knock sequence as a one-time password defeat the aim of simplified administration. In practice, port knocking must be combined with other forms of authentication that are not vulnerable to replay or man-in-the-middle attacks for the whole system to be effective.

<text>Joachim Ringelnatz is the pen name of the German author and painter Hans Bötticher
(7 August 1883 in Wurzen, Saxony – 17 November 1934 in Berlin). From 1894 to 1900 he lived with his family in the Gottschedstrasse 40 in Leipzig.

His pen name &quot;Ringelnatz&quot; is usually explained as a dialect expression for an animal, possibly a variant of &quot;Ringelnatter&quot;, German for grass snake or more probably the seahorse for winding (&quot;ringeln&quot;) its tail around objects. The seahorse is called Ringelnass (nass = wet) by mariners, an occupation to which he felt kinship. He was a sailor in his youth and spent the First World War in the Navy on a minesweeper.
In the 1920s and 1930s, he worked as a &quot;Kabarettist&quot;, i.e., a kind of satirical stand-up comedian.
He is best known for his wry poems using word play and sometimes bordering on nonsense poetry. Some of them are similar to Christian Morgenstern&#x27;s, but more satirical in tone and occasionally subversive. His most popular character is the anarchic sailor &quot;Kuddel Daddeldu&quot; with his drunken antics and disdain for authority.

In his final thirteen years Ringelnatz was also a dedicated and prolific visual artist. The bulk of his art went missing during World War II, but over 200 paintings and drawings survived. In the 1920s some of his work was exhibited at the Akademie der Künste along with that of his contemporaries Otto Dix and George Grosz. Ringelnatz illustrated his own novel called &quot;&quot;...liner Roma...&quot; (1923), the title of which is a doubly truncated &quot;Berliner Roman&quot;&quot; (Berlin novel), for &quot;Berlin novels usually have no decent beginning and no proper ending.&quot; (&quot;Berliner Romane haben meist keinen ordentlichen Anfang und kein rechtes Ende.&quot;)

In 1933, he was banned by the Nazi government as a &quot;degenerate artist&quot;.

Ringelnatz&#x27;s widow Leonharda Pieper married Julius Gescher after Ringelnatz&#x27;s death, and their son Norbert managed Ringelnatz&#x27;s legacy and assembled a collection. Norbert donated the collection to the Joachim Ringelnatz Museum in Cuxhaven in 2019.

<text>HarbourLynx was a private company based in Nanaimo, British Columbia that provided passenger-only high speed ferry service between the city centres of Nanaimo and Vancouver.

==Predecessors==
HarbourLynx was the fourth venture to attempt such a ferry service. The first service in 1969, which used a passenger-only hovercraft, failed financially. The second service was similarly a hovercraft in the mid-1980s. The third venture Kvaerner Fjellstrand Shipping (owned by Fjellstrand A.S.), operating as Royal Sealink Express, ran for only 11 months during 1992–1993, using the 296-passenger MV Orca Spirit – the same model of ship used by HarbourLynx.

==Ship refurbishment==
The HarbourLynx catamaran (previously called the &quot;Philippine Kvaerner Fjellstrand Singapore Flying Cat&quot;) was built by Fjellstrand A.S. in 1996. After being laid up in the Philippines for two years, the catamaran was shipped to a Victoria shipyard for refurbishment and upgraded to meet Transport Canada regulations while the engines were refurbished by Detroit Diesel in Kamloops.

==Operation==
After several cancelled sailings due to mechanical issues, the Harbourlynx vessel was pulled from service in February 2006 owing to major engine problems. The company filed for bankruptcy and changed ownership. Plans to revive the service never came to fruition.

==Sale of vessel==
The vessel left Nanaimo&#x27;s harbour on January 1, 2008 bound for Ireland, to serve the passage between Galway and the Aran Islands. She was purchased by Fjellstrand, a Norwegian ship building company, to retrofit the vessel and make her seaworthy again.

<text>The International Appalachian Trail (IAT; , SIA) was originally a hiking trail which ran from Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument, in Maine, through New Brunswick, to the Gaspé Peninsula of Quebec, after which it followed a ferry route to Newfoundland, and then continued to the northern-easternmost point of the Appalachian Mountains at Belle Isle, Newfoundland and Labrador. 
As of July 2020, there are widely geographically dispersed IAT-branded walking trails in Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Ireland, Isle of Man, Wales, England, Spain, Portugal, and Morocco.

==History==
The IAT was proposed in 1994 by Richard Anderson, a Maine fisheries biologist, with plans to traverse the portions of the Appalachian Mountains in Maine, New Brunswick, and Quebec that the Appalachian Trail did not cover. Following route selection, construction of the trail took place through the late 1990s.

The first person to thruhike the IAT, as it then existed, was John Brinda from Washington State, in 1997. He did this as part of a long-distance hike of what is known as the Eastern Continental Trail starting in Key West, Florida ending at Cap Gaspé in Quebec. He was the first person to thruhike the entire Eastern Continental Trail.

The Newfoundland and Labrador extension to the IAT was proposed in 2003 and is still under construction. When completed, it will add an additional 1,200 km of trail. The official opening of the first trail section of the IAT Newfoundland was September 23, 2006.

In 2009, IAT officials met with the British Geological Survey in Scotland to discuss whether to extend the IAT to the Appalachian terrains of Scotland, Ireland, Northern Ireland, and Wales, setting off a series of expansions through Europe and Northern Africa in which existing trails co-branded with the IAT.

==Route==
The IAT/SIA starts in Katahdin Woods &amp; Waters National Monument in the U.S. State of Maine. Thence to Mars Hill, Maine, before following the U.S.-Canada border north to Fort Fairfield, Maine, where it crosses the border into Perth-Andover, New Brunswick. It continues up the Tobique River valley to Mount Carleton before crossing the Miramichi Highlands to the Restigouche River valley in Quebec and along the Chic-Choc Mountains of the Gaspé Peninsula, ending at the peninsula&#x27;s easternmost point, Cap Gaspé in Forillon National Park.

From Cap Gaspé, the IAT skips to a small section in Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and over the Gulf of St. Lawrence to Newfoundland, where the trail picks up again at Channel-Port aux Basques and follows the west coast of the island up the Great Northern Peninsula before terminating at the island&#x27;s northernmost tip, Cape Bauld. From there the IAT skips over the Strait of Belle Isle to the northern terminus of the Appalachian Mountain chain at Belle Isle.

==Extension to Europe and North Africa==
Geological evidence shows that the Appalachian Mountains, certain mountains of Western Europe, and the Anti-Atlas range in North Africa are parts of the ancient Central Pangean Mountains, made when minor supercontinents collided to form the supercontinent Pangaea more than 250 million years ago. With the break-up of Pangaea, sections of the former range remained with the continents as they drifted to their present locations. Inspired by this evidence, the IAT has been extended into Western Europe and North Africa.

In 2010 and 2011, chapters of the International Appalachian Trail were established in Greenland, Scotland (the West Highland Way became the first IAT trail in Europe), Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, England, Ulster-Ireland, Wales, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Spain and Morocco.

==Highlights==

<doc id="936651" wikidata="Q1214768" url="?curid=936651" title="The Mask of Fu Manchu">
<text>The Mask of Fu Manchu is a 1932 American pre-Code film directed by Charles Brabin. Written by Irene Kuhn, Edgar Allan Woolf and John Willard, it was based on the 1932 novel of the same name by Sax Rohmer. The film, featuring Boris Karloff as Fu Manchu and Myrna Loy as his daughter, revolves around Fu Manchu&#x27;s quest for the golden sword and mask of Genghis Khan. Lewis Stone played his nemesis.

The film was made following Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s box office failure of &quot;Freaks&quot; (1932). Karloff, who was fresh off his role in &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1931) for Universal, found the film did not have a completed script and was given his lines during and after his daily preparation in the makeup chair. Following a difficult production, it was a financial success for the studio despite generally negative reviews. On the film&#x27;s theatrical re-release in 1972, the Japanese American Citizens League requested that the film be removed from circulation due to its negative portrayal of Asian people.

==Plot summary==
Sir Denis Nayland Smith of the British Secret Service warns Egyptologist Sir Lionel Barton that he must beat Fu Manchu in the race to find the tomb of Genghis Khan. Fu Manchu intends to use Khan&#x27;s sword and mask to proclaim himself the reincarnation of the legendary conqueror and inflame the peoples of Asia and the Middle East into a war to wipe out the &quot;white race&quot;. Barton is kidnapped soon afterward and taken to Fu Manchu, who tries bribing his captive for the tomb&#x27;s location, even offering his own daughter, Fah Lo See. When that fails, Barton suffers the &quot;torture of the bell&quot; (lying underneath a gigantic, constantly ringing bell) in an unsuccessful attempt to get him to reveal the location of the tomb.

Barton&#x27;s daughter Sheila insists on taking her father&#x27;s place on the expedition, as she knows where the tomb is. She finds the tomb and its treasures with the help of her fiancé Terrence &quot;Terry&quot; Granville and his associates, Dr. Von Berg and McLeod. Smith joins them soon afterward.

McLeod is killed by one of Fu Manchu&#x27;s men during a robbery attempt, after McLeod kills one of Fu Manchu&#x27;s men. An emissary offers to trade Barton for the priceless artifacts. Despite Terry&#x27;s misgivings, Sheila persuades him to take the relics to Fu Manchu without Smith&#x27;s knowledge. However, when Fu Manchu tests the sword he determines that it is a fake (Smith had switched them). Terry is whipped under the supervision of Fah Lo See, who is attracted to him. Meanwhile, Fu Manchu has Barton&#x27;s severed hand delivered to Sheila. When Smith tries to rescue Terry, he is taken captive as well.

Terry is injected with a serum that makes him temporarily obedient to Fu Manchu and released. He tells Sheila and Von Berg that Smith wants them to bring the sword and mask to him. Sheila senses something is wrong, but Von Berg digs up the real relics and they follow Terry into a trap. Captured by Fu Manchu, the party is sentenced to death or enslavement, but not before Sheila manages to bring Terry back to his senses. Sheila is to become a human sacrifice, Smith is to be lowered into a crocodile pit, and Von Berg placed between two sets of metal spikes inching toward each other. Terry is prepared for another dose of the serum, which will make him a permanent slave of Fu Manchu&#x27;s daughter. However, Smith manages to free himself, Terry and Von Berg. Using one of Fu Manchu&#x27;s own weapons—a death ray that shoots an electric current—the men incapacitate the archvillain as he raises the sword to execute Sheila. When Fu Manchu drops the sword, Terry picks it up and hacks him to death. While Terry frees Sheila and carries her away, Smith and Von Berg incinerate Fu Manchu&#x27;s followers using the same weapon. Safely aboard a ship bound for England, Smith tosses the sword over the side so that the world will be safe from any future Fu Manchu.

==Production==
===Background===
After witnessing a man he believed to be the head of a dope-smuggling gang in London&#x27;s Chinatown area, author Sax Rohmer used his memory of the event for his first novel, &quot;The Insidious Dr. Fu Manchu&quot; (1913). The author then wrote several novels featuring the character for the next forty years, with his final novel being &quot;Emperor Fu Manchu&quot; published in 1959. Prior to the release of &quot;The Mask of Fu Manchu&quot; film, the character was adapted to the screen in the British serial &quot;The Mystery of Dr. Fu Manchu&quot; (1923) and later with Warner Oland portraying the character in &quot;The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu&quot; (1929) and &quot;The Return of Dr. Fu Manchu&quot; (1930) for Paramount Pictures.

Rohmer&#x27;s work in 1932 included a serial entitled &quot;The Mask of Fu Manchu&quot; that was published in &quot;Colliers&quot; magazine from May 7 to July 23, 1932. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer contracted out actor Boris Karloff, who had just completed work at the studio for &quot;The Old Dark House&quot;. For the director, MGM chose Charles Vidor in what would be his directorial debut.

As the production start date was approaching, MGM still had no script for the film. Karloff recalled that he requested a script about a week before starting and stated he was met with roars of laughter at the idea of there being a completed script. On August 1, 1932, film producer Hunt — began dictating the storyline and plot elements such as torture scenes that Irene Kuhn, Edgar Allan Woolf, and John Willard would collaborate on over the next two and a half months. Woolf was a contract writer who would contribute to MGM films like &quot;Freaks&quot; (1932) and Willard was the author of the play &quot;The Cat and the Canary&quot;.

===Filming===

Filming of &quot;The Mask of Fu Manchu&quot; began at MGM Studios in Culver City, California, on August 6, 1932. Karloff had to be in his makeup chair for two and a half hours to receive his Fu Manchu makeup from Cecil Holland. Karloff recalled that the makeup was &quot;extremely bad&quot; and that while in the chair he received four sheets of paper that would become the opening shot of the film. After completing makeup, he would receive new papers written in pidgin English, leading Karloff to proclaim that &quot;Some scenes were written in beautiful Oxford English, others were written in - God knows what!&quot; Myrna Loy, who played Fah Lo See, Fu Manchu&#x27;s daughter, described herself as being &quot;tossed&quot; into the film by the studio and that she told one of the producers &quot;I can&#x27;t do this... I&#x27;ve done a lot of terrible things in film, but this girl&#x27;s a sadistic nymphomaniac.&quot; Loy continued, stating that she and Karloff &quot;brought some feeling and humor to those comic book characters. Boris was a fine actor, a professional who never condescended to his often unworthy material.&quot;

In the middle of August, MGM staff began viewing the film rushes of &quot;The Mask of Fu Manchu&quot; and feared they would have another financial failure like &quot;Freaks&quot; on their schedule, and film production was shut down. Director Vidor was fired with most, if not all, of the footage he shot removed from the finished film. He was replaced with Charles Brabin. As production was beginning, MGM had to deal with other issues associated with the death of producer Paul Bern. Stromberg only returned to dictate ideas for &quot;The Mask of Fu Manchu,&quot; on September 9. On September 19, Stromberg dictated &quot;God forgive us for shooting what we have.&quot; Retakes and new scenes extended on for the next month, with filming ending on October 21. The final cost was $327,627.26.

==Release==

&quot;The Mask of Fu Manchu&quot; was shown theatrically as early as November 4, 1932. It had its New York City premiere at the Capitol Theatre on December 2, 1932. The film cost a total of $338,000 and had worldwide rentals of $625,000. It had a profit of $62,000.

MGM would re-release &quot;The Mask of Fu Manchu&quot; in 1972 as a triple feature with &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; (1931) and &quot;Mark of the Vampire&quot; (1935). The same year, MGM received a letter from the Japanese American Citizens League to remove the film from their catalogue, stating that &quot;&quot;Fu Manchu&quot; is an ugly, evil homosexual with five-inch fingernails while his daughter is a sadistic sex fiend.&quot; MGM did not respond to these complaints during this period. &quot;The Mask of Fu Manchu&quot; was not released on home video in the 1980s, with MGM/United Artists stating that their releases of films like &quot;Freaks&quot;, &quot;Mark of the Vampire&quot; and &quot;The Devil-Doll&quot; did such poor business that there was no market prospects for &quot;The Mask of Fu Manchu&quot;. It was released in 1992 with about one minute and five seconds removed, predominantly of Karloff&#x27;s dialogue scenes such as &quot;Yes, this is only the beginning! I will wipe out your whole accursed white race!&quot; and &quot;Would you all have maidens like this for your wives? Then conquer and breed! Kill the white man and take his women!&quot; The later DVD releases of the film have restored these scenes.

The film was announced for release on Blu-ray by the Warner Archive Collection for April 2024.

==Reception==
From contemporary reviews, &quot;The American Magazine&quot; proclaimed the film as &quot;a chilling, thrilling hour of hair-raising entertainment&quot; while Britain&#x27;s &quot;Film Weekly&quot; praised it as a &quot;blood-and-thunder thriller of nightmare dimensions.&quot; Film historian Gregory William Mank stated that most critics were aghast at the film. &quot;Variety&quot; proclaimed that &quot;this time they should have let the doctor rest in peace&quot;, finding Morley miscast, Karloff was still performing as Frankenstein&#x27;s monster, while Myrna Loy was &quot;playing stock&quot;.

In &quot;The BFI Companion to Crime&quot;, the authors described the film as &quot;the most elaborate film featuring the character&quot;, attributing this to the casting of Karloff and Loy, while finding the plot &quot;disjointed, even by penny-dreadful standards. &quot;Mask of Fu Manchu&quot; is not the definitive, nor even the best, &quot;Fu Manchu&quot; film, but it is the most delirious.&quot; Kim Newman writing for &quot;Empire&quot; found Karloff &quot;camply compelling&quot; and that the film&#x27;s plot &quot;gets lost amid a procession of bizarre, perverse incident.&quot;

==Legacy==
Karloff returned to Universal following his work on the film to begin work on &quot;The Mummy&quot; (1932). Karloff reflected on the film later, declaring that &quot;It was shambles, it really was–it was simply ridiculous.&quot;

The character of Fu Manchu would be seen in films in various incarnations. This included radio dramas such as &quot;The Shadow of Fu Manchu&quot;, film serials such as &quot;Drums of Fu Manchu&quot;, a Spanish production &quot;El Otro Fu Manchu&quot;, television with &quot;The Adventures of Dr. Fu Manchu&quot; (1956), and other feature films starring Christopher Lee as Fu Manchu, starting with &quot;The Face of Fu Manchu&quot; (1965).

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:

<doc id="936661" wikidata="Q15212263" url="?curid=936661" title="Bombing of Berlin in World War II">
<text>Berlin, the capital of Germany, was subject to 363 air raids during the Second World War. It was bombed by the RAF Bomber Command between 1940 and 1945, the United States Army Air Forces&#x27; Eighth Air Force between 1943 and 1945, and the French Air Force in 1940 and between 1944 and 1945 as part of the Allied campaign of strategic bombing of Germany. It was also attacked by aircraft of the Red Air Force in 1941 and particularly in 1945, as Soviet forces closed on the city. British bombers dropped 45,517 of bombs, while American aircraft dropped 22,090.3 . As the bombings continued, more and more people fled the city. By May 1945, 1.7million people (40% of the population) had fled.

==Prelude==
When the Second World War began in 1939, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued a request to the major belligerents to confine their air raids to military targets. The French and the British agreed to abide by the request &quot;upon the understanding that these same rules of warfare will be scrupulously observed by all of their opponents&quot;.

Initially the British had a policy of using aerial bombing only against military targets and/or infrastructure such as ports and railways of direct military importance. It was acknowledged that the aerial bombing of Germany would cause civilian casualties, but the British government was initially reluctanct to deliberately bomb civilian property outside combat zones as a military tactic. The policy was abandoned on 15 May 1940, two days after the German air attack on Rotterdam, when the Royal Air Force was given permission to attack targets in the Ruhr, including oil plants and other civilian industrial targets that aided the German war effort, such as blast furnaces that at night were self-illuminating. The first RAF raid on the interior of Germany took place on 19 March 1940 at Hörnum. On the night of 10–11 May 1940 the RAF bombed Dortmund. The &quot;Jules Verne&quot;, a variant of the Farman F.220 of the French Naval Aviation, was the first Allied bomber to raid Berlin. On the night of 7 June 1940, it dropped eight bombs of and eighty of on the German capital.

Between 1939 and 1942, the policy of bombing only targets of direct military significance was gradually abandoned in favour of &quot;area bombing&quot;, the large-scale bombing of German cities to destroy housing and civilian infrastructure. Although killing German civilians was never an explicit policy, it was obvious that area bombing would cause large-scale civilian casualties. With the technology available at the time, the precision bombing of military targets was possible only by daylight. It was difficult even then: day bomber raids by Bomber Command led to unacceptably high casualties and aircraft losses. Night bombing led to far lower losses but was of necessity indiscriminate, because navigation and bomb aiming were more difficult at night.

==1940 to 1943==
Before 1941, Berlin, at from London, was at the extreme range attainable by the British bombers then available to the Allied forces. It could be bombed only at night in summer when the days were longer and skies clearwhich increased the risk to Allied bombers. The first RAF raid on Berlin took place on the night of 25 August 1940; 95 aircraft were dispatched to bomb Tempelhof Airport near the centre of Berlin and Siemensstadt, of which 81 dropped their bombs in and around Berlin, and while the damage was slight, the psychological effect on Hitler was greater. At the start of hostilities, the saying &quot;if a single enemy bomber appears over Berlin, I will be called Meier&quot; made the rounds as attributed to Göring. When air raid sirens in Berlin sounded increasingly frequent after 25 August 1940, they swiftly became known as () in the Berlin vernacular, additionally apt because not only was Göring known for living large with a love for castles and leather uniforms, he was also the leader of the German Hunting Society.

The bombing raids on Berlin prompted Hitler to order the shift of the Luftwaffe&#x27;s target from British airfields and air defenses to British cities. In the following two weeks there were a further five raids of a similar size, all nominally precision raids at specific targets, but with the difficulties of navigating at night the bombs that were dropped were widely dispersed. During 1940 there were more raids on Berlin, all of which did little damage. The raids grew more frequent in 1941, but were ineffective in hitting important targets. The head of the Air Staff of the RAF, Charles Portal, justified these raids by saying that to &quot;get four million people out of bed and into the shelters&quot; was worth the losses involved.

The Soviet Union started a on Berlin on 8 August 1941 that extended into early September. Medium Navy bombers, accompanied from 12 August by Army bombers, conducted ten raids from Saaremaa island to Berlin with 3–12 aircraft in each raid, fifty in total reaching Berlin. Heavy Army bombers, operating from near Leningrad, executed one raid to Berlin on 11 August, with only few machines reaching the target. In total in 1941, Soviet aircraft dropped of bombs on Berlin. Combat and operational losses for the Soviets tallied 17 aircraft destroyed and 70 crewmen killed.

On 7 November 1941, Sir Richard Peirse, head of RAF Bomber Command, launched a large raid on Berlin, sending over 160 bombers to the capital. 21 were shot down or crashed, and again little damage was done due to bad weather. This failure led to the dismissal of Peirse and his replacement (in February 1942) by Arthur Travers Harris, who believed in both the efficacy and necessity of area bombing. Harris said:
At the same time, new bombers with longer ranges were coming into service, particularly the Avro Lancaster, which became available in large numbers during 1942. During most of 1942, however, Bomber Command&#x27;s priority was attacking Germany&#x27;s U-boat ports as part of Britain&#x27;s effort to win the Battle of the Atlantic. During the whole of 1942 there were only nine air alerts in Berlin, none of them serious. Only in 1943 did Harris have both the means and the opportunity to put his belief in area bombing into practice.

==The Battle of Berlin==
The Battle of Berlin was launched by Harris in November 1943, a concerted air campaign against the German capital, although other cities continued to be attacked to prevent the Germans concentrating their defences in Berlin. Harris believed this could be the blow that would break German resistance. &quot;It will cost us between 400 and 500 aircraft,&quot; he said. &quot;It will cost Germany the war.&quot; By this time he could deploy over 800 long-range bombers on any given night, equipped with new and more sophisticated navigational devices such as H2S radar. Between November 1943 and March 1944, Bomber Command made 16 massed attacks on Berlin.

A prelude to the 1943 raids came from De Havilland Mosquitos, which hit the capital on 30 January 1943, the tenth anniversary of the Nazis&#x27; . That same day, both Göring and Goebbels were known to be giving big speeches that were to be broadcast live by radio. At precisely 11am, Mosquitoes of No. 105 Squadron arrived over Berlin exactly on time to disrupt Göring&#x27;s speech. Later that day, No. 139 Squadron repeated the trick for Goebbels. These were great propaganda raids whichmuch as the Doolittle Raid on the Japanese home islands had done for shaking Japanese complacency in April 1942were a severe embarrassment for the German leadership. 20 April 1943 was Hitler&#x27;s 54th birthday. Bomber Command decided that they had to mark the occasion with a raid on Berlin, and it was decided that the Mosquito was the right aircraft for the job. Accordingly, No. 105 Squadron was dispatched to the German capital, successfully reaching the city with the loss of only one aircraft.
The first raid of the battle occurred on 18–19 November 1943. Berlin was the main target, and was attacked by 440 Avro Lancasters aided by four Mosquitos. The city was under cloud and the damage was not severe. The second major raid was on the night of 22–23 November 1943. This was the most effective raid by the RAF on Berlin. The raid caused extensive damage to the residential areas west of the centre, Tiergarten and Charlottenburg, Schöneberg and Spandau. Because of the dry weather conditions, several firestorms ignited. The Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church was destroyed. Several other buildings of note were either damaged or destroyed, including the British, French, Italian and Japanese embassies, Charlottenburg Palace and Berlin Zoo, as were the Ministry of Munitions, the Waffen SS Administrative College, the barracks of the Imperial Guard at Spandau and several arms factories.

On 17 December, extensive damage was done to the Berlin railway system. By this time cumulative effect of the bombing campaign had made more than a quarter of Berlin&#x27;s total living accommodation unusable. There was another major raid on 28–29 January 1944, when Berlin&#x27;s western and southern districts were hit in the most concentrated attack of this period. On 15–16 February, important war industries were hit, including the large Siemensstadt area, with the centre and south-western districts sustaining most of the damage. This was the largest raid by the RAF on Berlin. Raids continued until March 1944.
These raids caused immense devastation and loss of life in Berlin. The 22 November 1943 raid killed 2,000 Berliners and rendered 175,000 homeless. The following night, 1,000 were killed and 100,000 made homeless. During December and January regular raids killed hundreds of people each night and rendered between 20,000 and 80,000 homeless each time. Overall nearly 4,000 were killed, 10,000 injured and 450,000 made homeless.

The 16 raids on Berlin cost Bomber Command more than 500 aircraft, with their crews killed or captured. This was a loss rate of 5.8%, which was above the 5% threshold that was considered the maximum sustainable operational loss rate by the RAF. In December 1943, for example, 11 crews from No. 460 Squadron RAAF alone were lost in operations against Berlin; and in January and February, another 14 crews were killed. Having 25 aircraft destroyed meant that the fighting force of the squadron had to be replaced in three months. At these rates &quot;Bomber Command would have been wiped out before Berlin.&quot; It has been largely acknowledged that the Battle of Berlin was a failure; for the RAF, British official historians have stated that &quot;in an operational sense the Battle of Berlin was more than a failure, it was a defeat&quot;. 

==March 1944 to April 1945==
In 1943, the United States Army and the Standard Oil company built a set of replicas in western Utah of typical German working class housing estates, &quot;German Village&quot;, which would be of key importance in acquiring the know-how and experience necessary to carry out the firebombings on Berlin. It was done with the assistance of Erich Mendelsohn, a Jewish architect of structures in Berlin who fled the Nazis in 1933.

The Big Week (Sunday, 20–Friday, 25 February 1944) heavy bomber offensive began shortly after the Eighth Air Force commander, Maj. Gen. Jimmy Doolittle, had implemented a major change in fighter defense of USAAF strategic bomber formations that had bolstered the confidence of U.S. strategic bombing crews. Until that time, Allied bombers avoided contact with the Luftwaffe; now, the Americans used any method that would force the Luftwaffe into combat. Implementing this policy, the United States looked toward Berlin. Raiding the German capital, the USAAF reasoned, would force the Luftwaffe into battle. Consequently, on 3 March, the USSTAF launched the first of several attacks against Berlin. Fierce battles raged and resulted in heavy losses for both sides; 69 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses were lost on 6 March but the Luftwaffe lost 160 aircraft. The Allies replaced their losses; the Luftwaffe could not.

At the tail end of the Battle of Berlin the RAF made one last large raid on the city on the night of 24–25 March, losing 8.9% of the attacking force, but due to the failure of the Battle of Berlin, and the switch to the tactical bombing of France during the summer months in support of the Allied invasion of France, RAF Bomber Command left Berlin alone for most of 1944. Nevertheless, regular nuisance raids by both the RAF and USAAF continued. In 1945, the Eighth Air Force launched a number of very large daytime raids on Berlin, the last of them being on 18 March (there were bombing raids to Falkensee and Spandau, near Berlin, on 28 March), the 15th Air Force launched its only bombing mission to Berlin on 24 March, and for 36 nights in succession scores of RAF Mosquitos bombed the German capital, ending on the night of 20/21 April 1945 just before the Soviets entered the city.

===The largest American raid on Berlin===
1,500 bombers of the Eighth Air Force, protected by some 1,000 fighters, attacked the Berlin railway system on the morning of 3 February 1945, in the belief that the German Sixth Panzer Army was moving through Berlin by train on its way to the Eastern Front, and would use the Tempelhof railyards for the move. This was one of the few occasions on which the USAAF undertook a mass attack on a city centre. Lt-General James Doolittle, commander of the USAAF Eighth Air Force, objected to this tactic, but he was overruled by the USAAF commander, General Carl Spaatz, who was supported by the Allied commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower. Eisenhower and Spaatz made it clear that the attack on Berlin was of great political importance in that it was designed to assist the Soviet offensive on the Oder east of Berlin, and was essential for Allied unity.
In the raid, led by Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Rosenthal of the 100th Bombardment Group flying in an H2X-equipped pathfinder B-17G Fortress s/n 44-8379 — commanding the entire First Air Division&#x27;s bomber force on this raid, Friedrichstadt (the newspaper district), and Luisenstadt (both divided between the boroughs of Kreuzberg and Mitte, the central area) and some other areas, such as Friedrichshain, were severely damaged. The bombs used in this raid consisted mostly of high explosive ordnance and not incendiary munitions. The area that suffered the greatest damage did not include railway main lines, which were more northern (Stadtbahn) and southern (Ringbahn).

The bombing was so dense that it caused a city fire spreading eastwards, driven by the wind, over the south of Friedrichstadt and the northwest of neighboured Luisenstadt. The fire lasted for four days until it had burnt everything combustible in its range to ashes and after it had reached waterways, large thoroughfares, and parks that the fire could not jump over. Due to the exhaustion of German supplies, the German anti-aircraft defense was under-equipped and weak, so that out of the 1,600 US aircraft committed, only 36 were shot down and their crews taken as war prisoners. Rosenthal was among those shot down, but survived and was rescued by the Soviet armed forces and eventually returned to England.

A number of monuments, such as French Luisenstadt Church, St. James Church, Jerusalem&#x27;s Church, Luisenstadt Church, St. Michael&#x27;s Church, St. Simeon Church, and the Marcher Protestant Consistory (today&#x27;s entrance of Jewish Museum Berlin), as well as government and Nazi Party buildings were also hit, including the Reich Chancellery, the Party Chancellery, the Gestapo headquarters, and the People&#x27;s Court. The Unter den Linden, Wilhelmstrasse and Friedrichstrasse areas were turned into expanses of ruins. Roland Freisler, the infamous head justice of the People&#x27;s Court, was among the dead. The death toll amounted to 2,894, fewer than might have been expected because the raid took place in daytime with relatively few incendiary bombs. The number of wounded amounted to 20,000, and 120,000 were left homeless (&quot;dehoused&quot;).
Another raid on 26 February 1945 left another 80,000 people homeless. Raids continued until April, when the Red Army was outside the city. In the last days of the war the Red Air Force also bombed Berlin, also using Ilyushin Il-2 and similar aircraft for low-level attacks from 28 March onwards. By this time, Berlin&#x27;s civil defences and infrastructure were close to collapse, but civilian morale held. After the capture of Berlin, Soviet General Nikolai Bersarin said, referring to the Red Army&#x27;s artillery and rocket bombardment, that &quot;the Western Allies had dropped 65,000 tons of explosives on the city in the course of more than two years; whereas the Red Army had expended 40,000 tons in merely two weeks&quot;. Later, statisticians calculated that for every inhabitant of Berlin there were nearly of rubble.

Up to the end of March 1945 there had been a total of 314 air raids on Berlin, with 85 of those coming in the last twelve months. Half of all houses were damaged and around a third uninhabitable, as much as of the city was simply rubble. About a third of Berlin&#x27;s area was badly damaged by the war. From the city centre, buildings were completely destroyed or gutted for about 20 blocks in all directions. Among the shelled structures some residents and normal activity quickly resumed in the city post-war. Estimates of the total number of dead in Berlin from air raids range from 20,000 to 50,000; current German studies suggest that a figure in the lower part of this range is more likely. This compares to death tolls of between 25,000 and 35,000 in the single attack on Dresden on 14 February 1945, and the 42,000 killed at Hamburg in a single raid in 1943. Both the Hamburg and Dresden raids combined having a lower casualty total than the 9/10 March 1945 Operation Meetinghouse single firebombing raid on Tokyo, devastating some causing the loss of at least 100,000 lives in the Japanese capital.

==Berlin&#x27;s defences==
The Nazi regime was well aware of the political necessity of protecting the Reich capital against devastation from the air. Even before the war, work had begun on an extensive system of public air raid shelters, but by 1939 only 15% of the planned 2,000 shelters had been built. By 1941, however, the five huge public shelters (, , , and ) were complete, offering shelter to 65,000 people. Other shelters were built under or near government buildings, the best-known being the so-called underground in the backyard of the Reich Chancellery building. In addition, many U-Bahn stations were converted into shelters. The rest of the population had to make do with their own cellars.

In 1943, the Germans decided to evacuate non-essential people from Berlin. By 1944 1.2million people, 790,000 of them women and children, about a quarter of the city&#x27;s population, had been evacuated to rural areas. An effort was made to evacuate all children from Berlin, but this was resisted by parents, and many evacuees soon made their way back to the city (as was also the case in London in 1940–41). The increasing shortage of manpower as the war dragged on meant that female labour was essential to keep Berlin&#x27;s war industries going, so the evacuation of all women with children was not possible. At the end of 1944 the city&#x27;s population began to grow again as refugees fleeing the Red Army&#x27;s advance in the east began to pour into Berlin. Refugees from the east () were officially denied permission to remain in Berlin for longer than two days and were housed in camps near the city before being moved on westwards; it is estimated less than 50,000 managed to remain in Berlin. By January 1945 the population was around 2.9million, although the demands of the German military were such that only 100,000 of these were males aged 18–30. Another 100,000 or so were forced labor, mainly French &quot;foreign workers&quot; () and Russian &quot;eastern workers&quot; (). The key to the Flak area were three huge Flak towers (), which provided enormously tough platforms for both searchlights and 12.8 cm FlaK 40 anti-aircraft guns as well as shelters (&quot;Hochbunker&quot;) for civilians. These towers were at the Berlin Zoo in the Tiergarten, Humboldthain and Friedrichshain. The Flak guns were increasingly manned by the teenagers of the Hitler Youth as older men were drafted to the front. By 1945 the girls of the League of German Girls (BDM) were also operating Flak guns. After 1944 there was little fighter protection from the , and the Flak defences were increasingly overwhelmed by the scale of the attacks.

<text>ABC1 was a television channel owned by the Disney-ABC Television Group division of The Walt Disney Company (50%) and Sky plc (50%), available to the viewers in the United Kingdom and Ireland. ABC1 used the branding of the Disney-owned American network, ABC.

The channel had general entertainment programming with programming from the US parent channel, apart from the weekend morning programming block Playhouse Disney, which was aimed at children and also aired on Disney Channel in the United States of America.

==History==
ABC1 channel initially launched exclusively on the British digital terrestrial television platform Freeview on 27 September 2004 but it only broadcast daily from 6am to 6pm with the expectations to eventually broadcast 24/7 by 2010. The channel was not available on Freeview in Wales as the space on multiplex A was taken by S4C. The channel was ad-free for the first few months to build up viewers. In December 2004, it was expanded on Telewest&#x27;s digital cable service, and on 14 December on the NTL digital cable service.

In March 2005, ABC1 took its first advertisement from Procter and Gamble. Unlike other channels in the UK and Ireland with advertisements generically every 15 minutes, ABC1&#x27;s advertisement breaks were similar to channels in the US, with advertisements being run straight after a show&#x27;s title sequence and before the end credits, with no further advertisement breaks during a show or between shows. Also in 2005, Sky started carrying the channel. In Summer 2006, a Playhouse Disney block was added to the schedule in the morning.

It was announced on 7 September 2007, that ABC1 would close down, due to Disney deciding to concentrate on their other channels and lack of primetime availability on Freeview UK. Despite being scheduled to close down on 1 October 2007, ABC1 stopped broadcasting early on all UK and Irish TV platforms at noon on 26 September 2007 after three years on-air. The channel was removed from the EPGs immediately afterwards.

On 30 October 2007, the channel&#x27;s former Sky EPG slot was replaced with Playhouse Disney +, a 25-minute timeshift service of Playhouse Disney.

<text>Food Fight (also styled as Charley Chuck&#x27;s Food Fight) is an arcade video game developed by General Computer Corporation and released by Atari, Inc. in March 1983. The player guides Charley Chuck, who is trying to eat an ice cream cone before it melts, while avoiding four chefs bent on stopping him. 1,951 arcade cabinets were sold.

&quot;Food Fight&quot; was released for the Atari 7800 console in 1986, and also the same year as a cartridge for Atari 8-bit computers styled for the then new Atari XEGS. A port for the Atari 2600 was canceled.

==Gameplay==

In &quot;Food Fight&quot;, the player controls a boy named Charley Chuck. The object of the game is to eat an ice cream cone located on the opposite side of an open playfield. The ice cream is slowly melting, and it must be consumed before it melts completely. Controls consist of an analog-position joystick and a button.

Standing between Charley and the ice cream are four chefs: Oscar, Angelo, Jacques, and Zorba. They are identified by the shape of their toques: big and round for Oscar, small and rectangular for Angelo, tall and slender for Jacques, and flat and limp for Zorba. The chefs appear from holes in the floor of the level and chase after Charley. The holes serve as respawn points should a chef meet with an accident during the round.

Scattered throughout the screen are piles of food, such as pies, peas, tomatoes, and bananas. Both the player and the chefs can grab food from the piles to throw at each other. The player can grab a piece of food by running over a pile, then throw it by aiming the joystick in a chosen direction and pressing the button. The supplies of most foods are limited, but watermelon is unlimited in supply. Whenever a chef is hit by food thrown by the player or another chef, he is knocked off the screen. The player loses a life if Charley touches a chef, is hit by a chef&#x27;s thrown food, falls into an open hole, or fails to eat the ice cream before it completely melts.

The player scores points for hitting chefs with thrown food and for luring them into open holes. Eating the cone ends the level, and the player scores bonus points for every unused piece of food (except watermelon) left on the screen. The point value of the cone increases until level 50, then remains unchanged for the rest of the game. If Charley is holding a piece of food when he eats the cone, it will carry over to the next level.

Sometimes if the player has at least one close call with a chef and flying food during a level, the game plays back an instant replay of the entire level while music plays.

==Development==
&quot;Food Fight&quot; was developed by General Computer Corporation (GCC), the company that designed the custom chips of the Atari 7800 and produced Midway&#x27;s &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot;. Like &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot;, GCC&#x27;s connection to Atari was born out of accusations of copyright infringement. The company had produced a kit that would speed up Atari&#x27;s &quot;Missile Command&quot; arcade machines, but with General Computer claiming the copyright for the modified game. Fearing for its intellectual property rights, Atari sued GCC for $15 million. The case was settled out of court, with Atari contracting GCC to produce video games for them, including &quot;Food Fight&quot; and &quot;Quantum&quot;.

In an interview Jonathan Hurd said everyone at GCC contributed to the development. The initials of the people who were most heavily involved in creating &quot;Food Fight&quot; are in the high score table.

===Bugs===
According to Hurd, the arcade version contains a serious bug: the game is reset if the cone is eaten at the last possible moment in a level that is chosen for an instant replay.

In rare cases in the Atari 7800 port, Charley can be hit by food or a chef during the instant replay. The game displays &quot;ALMOST MADE IT&quot; and restores the life that was just lost.

==Legacy==
&quot;Food Fight&quot; clones &quot;Foodwar&quot; and &quot;Mudpies&quot; for the TRS-80 Color Computer were released in 1983. &quot;Mudpies&quot; was later published for the Atari ST in 1985.

The arcade version of &quot;Food Fight&quot; was included in the &quot;Game Pack 012&quot; compilation for the Xbox 360 and Windows, through Microsoft&#x27;s now defunct Game Room service.

A modern reimagining of &quot;Food Fight&quot; as a third-person shooter was released for the 2021 Atari VCS as an Early Access game in December 2023.

==World records==
The world record high score for &quot;Food Fight&quot; using the game&#x27;s default settings is 107,778,200 points, set by Justin Emory on July 4, 2021. Under tournament settings, the world record is 1,424,400 points, set by Justin Emory in April 2018.

<text>Joanna Newsom (born January 18, 1982) is an American singer-songwriter and actress.

After recording and self-releasing two EPs in 2002, Newsom signed to the independent label Drag City. Her debut album, &quot;The Milk-Eyed Mender&quot;, was released in 2004 to acclaim and garnered Newsom an underground following. She received wider exposure with &quot;Ys&quot; (2006), which reached number 134 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200&lt;ref name=&quot;Ys / Joanna Newsom&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and was nominated for a 2007 Shortlist Music Prize. She continued releasing albums with &quot;Have One on Me&quot; in 2010 and &quot;Divers&quot; in 2015.

Newsom has been noted by critics for her unique musical style, sometimes characterized as progressive folk, and for her harp instrumentation. She has also appeared as an actress with roles in the television series &quot;Portlandia&quot; and in the 2014 film &quot;Inherent Vice&quot;.

==Early life==
Newsom was born on January 18, 1982 in Grass Valley, California. Her parents, both doctors, were &quot;progressive-minded professionals&quot; who previously lived in the San Francisco Bay Area. Newsom was raised in Nevada City along with her older brother, Peter, and younger sister, Emily. She is the second cousin, twice removed, of Gavin Newsom, Governor of California.

As a child, Newsom was not allowed to watch television or listen to the radio. She describes her parents as &quot;kind of idealists when it came to hoping they could protect us from bad influences, like violent movies, or stupid stuff.&quot; She listened to music from a young age. Her father played the guitar, and her mother was a classically trained pianist who played the hammered dulcimer, the autoharp and conga drums. Newsom attended a Waldorf school where she studied theater and learned to memorize and recite long poems.

At five, Newsom asked her parents if she could learn to play the harp. Her parents eventually agreed to sign her up for harp lessons, but the local harp instructor did not want to take on such a young student and suggested she learn to play the piano first. She did, and later moved on to the harp which she &quot;loved from the first lesson onward.&quot; She first played on smaller Celtic harps until her parents bought her a full-size pedal harp in the seventh grade.

After high school, she studied composition and creative writing at Mills College, where she played keyboards in The Pleased. She dropped out, however, to focus on her music and returned to live with family in Nevada City.

==Career==
===2002–2005: Career beginnings and &quot;The Milk-Eyed Mender&quot;===

In 2002–03, after appearing as a guest musician on Nervous Cop&#x27;s self-titled collaboration album, Newsom recorded two EPs, &quot;Walnut Whales&quot; and &quot;Yarn and Glue&quot;. These homemade recordings were intended to serve as a document of her early work and were not intended for public distribution. At the suggestion of Noah Georgeson, her then-boyfriend and recording engineer of the EP, she burned several copies to sell at her early shows. Newsom&#x27;s friend and bandmate in Golden Shoulders, Adam Kline, gave one of her CDs to Will Oldham at a show in Nevada City. Oldham was impressed with Newsom&#x27;s music and asked her to tour with him. He also gave a copy of the CD to the owner of Drag City, his record label. Drag City signed Newsom and released her debut album &quot;The Milk-Eyed Mender&quot; in 2004.

Shortly thereafter, Newsom toured with Devendra Banhart and Vetiver to promote the album and made an early UK appearance at the Green Man Festival in Wales. The tour was the subject of the 2011 documentary, &quot;The Family Jams&quot;. In December 2004, she performed with Smog and Weird War at Drag City&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Next Life&quot; Christmas party. She also appeared as a guest musician on Vetiver&#x27;s 2004 self-titled album, and the following year, on Vashti Bunyan&#x27;s &quot;Lookaftering&quot; (2005). The track &quot;Sprout and the Bean&quot; was featured in the 2008 horror film &quot;The Strangers&quot;.

&quot;The Milk-Eyed Mender&quot; had sold 200,000 copies as of 2010 and helped her garner an underground following. The album was remarked as a &quot;neo-folk benchmark&quot; by music historian John Morrish in 2007 and was named the 12th best folk album of all time by &quot;NME&quot;.

===2006–2011: &quot;Ys&quot; and &quot;Have One on Me&quot;===

Her second album, &quot;Ys&quot; (), was released in November 2006, also by Drag City. The album features orchestrations and arrangements by Van Dyke Parks, engineering from Steve Albini and mixing by Drag City label-mate Jim O&#x27;Rourke. On a road trip, Bill Callahan recommended she listen to the album &quot;Song Cycle&quot; by Parks, which led to him being chosen to arrange her work on &quot;Ys&quot;. To support &quot;Ys&quot;, Newsom performed the album live in 2008 with the Brooklyn Philharmonic in New York City and with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra in Sydney, Australia. &quot;Ys&quot; garnered Newsom wider exposure, charting at number 134 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album was also nominated for a 2007 Shortlist Music Prize. As of 2010, &quot;Ys&quot; had sold 250,000 copies.

In 2009, she appeared in the music video for the song &quot;Kids&quot; by the group MGMT. Also in 2009, Newsom appeared as a guest harpist on the Moore Brothers&#x27; album &quot;Aptos&quot; and played piano on Golden Shoulders&#x27; &quot;Get Reasonable&quot;. Newsom provided additional vocals for The Lonely Island&#x27;s song &quot;Ras Trent&quot; during this period as well. On March 28, 2009, she performed over two hours of new material at an unannounced concert in Big Sur, California with fellow Nevada City singer-lyricist Mariee Sioux under the pseudonym the Beatles&#x27;s. Those in attendance reported that about one-third of her new material was played primarily on piano, with a backing arrangement of banjo, violin, guitar and drums. On February 11, 2010, &quot;Pitchfork Media&quot; reported that Newsom would be the subject of a tribute book titled &quot;Visions of Joanna Newsom&quot; which was published by Roan Press and features a contribution from author and publisher Dave Eggers.

Newsom&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Have One on Me&quot;, was released on February 23, 2010, in North America. A triple album recorded in Tokyo in 2009, it consists of over two hours of songs. Writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Ann Powers praised the album&#x27;s variety, adding: &quot;Newsom uses the songwriter&#x27;s default mode to explore how traditional love, for women, can be both the beginning and the end of possibility: a way to escape home and be exiled from it; to welcome children or be burdened by fertility; to be entrusted with secrets, or betrayed.&quot; Throughout 2010, she toured Europe and North America to promote the record, supported by a five-piece band, and also appeared as a guest composer on the album &quot;How I Got Over&quot; by the Roots, released in June of that year. She was also selected by Matt Groening to perform at the edition of the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival he curated in May 2010 in Minehead, England. In December 2010, a tribute album of Newsom covers was released as a digital download. Artists involved include M. Ward, Billy Bragg, Francesco Santocono, Guy Buttery and Owen Pallett, with all proceeds going to Oxfam America&#x27;s Pakistan Flood Relief Efforts.

On July 19, 2011, Newsom&#x27;s second single, &quot;What We Have Known,&quot; was released on 12&quot; vinyl. The single was originally the b-side to her first single, &quot;Sprout and the Bean&quot;. In June 2011, she filmed her second music video (for the song &quot;Good Intentions Paving Company&quot;) with directors Karni &amp; Saul. Newsom was selected by Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel to perform at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival that he curated in March 2012 in Minehead, England. In late 2011, Newsom contributed vocals to &quot;The Muppet Show Theme&quot; for &quot;The Muppets&quot; and appeared on the cover of the 10th anniversary issue of &quot;Under the Radar&quot; with Robin Pecknold.

===2012–present: &quot;Divers&quot; and acting===
Newsom began 2012 with television appearances on &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; (on January 21) and &quot;Portlandia&quot; (on February 7).

On June 25, 2012, she performed at the Warfield Theatre in San Francisco with Philip Glass and Tim Fain as part of a benefit for the Henry Miller Memorial Library. She performed a new song at the concert tentatively titled &quot;The Diver&#x27;s Wife&quot;, a love story concerning pearl hunting, which would eventually become the title track from her next album, &quot;Divers&quot;. On October 14, she performed another new song tentatively called &quot;Look and Despair&quot; at the Treasure Island Festival, which was renamed &quot;Sapokanikan&quot; and released as the lead single from &quot;Divers&quot;.

Newsom appeared on a track titled &quot;Kindness be Conceived&quot; on Thao and the Get Down Stay Down&#x27;s album &quot;We the Common&quot;, released in February 2013. In March 2013, Newsom contributed to the song &quot;The Man Who Ran the Town&quot; from the album &quot;Why Do Birds Suddenly Appear&quot; by British skinhead band Hard Skin.

She appeared in and narrated the 2014 film &quot;Inherent Vice&quot;, directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called Newsom&#x27;s narration in the film &quot;gorgeously rendered.&quot; Newsom&#x27;s fourth record, &quot;Divers&quot;, was released on October 23, 2015. The album peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Albums chart and topped her previous best sales week (&quot;Ys&quot;&#x27;s debut).

On December 8, 2015, she performed &quot;Leaving the City&quot; from the album on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;. In mid-July 2018, Newsom had two songs included in the NPR&#x27;s &quot;200 Greatest Songs By 21st Century Women&quot; list, &quot;Sapokanikan&quot; (at number 129), and &quot;Peach Plum Pear&quot; (at number 80).

On March 22, 2023, she performed a surprise set as Fleet Foxes&#x27; opener during their &quot;Spring Recital&quot; show in Los Angeles, performing five new songs tentatively titled &quot;Bombs Are Whistling&quot;, &quot;Marie at the Mill&quot;, &quot;Little Hand&quot;, &quot;The Air Again&quot;, and &quot;No Wonder&quot;. These songs remained in rotation on the setlists of a concert residency Newsom gave at Hollywood Forever Cemetery in May 2024. On May 18, 2024, during concert performances of mainly children&#x27;s song covers, Newsom debuted two further original songs: &quot;Home Economics&quot; and &quot;Rovenshere&quot;.

==Musical style and influences==
Newsom&#x27;s musical style has been labelled as progressive folk, chamber folk, indie folk and baroque pop. Newsom&#x27;s early work was strongly influenced by polyrhythms. After &quot;Ys&quot;, Newsom said she had lost interest in polyrhythms. They &quot;stopped being fascinating to me and started feeling wanky.&quot; The press has sometimes labeled her as one of the most prominent members of the freak folk movement. Newsom, however, claims no ties to any particular music scene. Her song-writing and vocal performance style has incorporated elements of Appalachian music and its shaped-note notation.

Newsom is a soprano, and has expressed disappointment at comments that her singing is &quot;childlike&quot;, preferring to call her performance style &quot;untrainable&quot;. Critics noticed a change in Newsom&#x27;s voice on her album &quot;Have One on Me&quot;, which was the result of her developing vocal cord nodules in 2009, leading to her being unable to speak or sing for two months. The recovery from the nodules and further &quot;vocal modifications&quot; changed her voice.

She has cited Vladimir Nabokov and Ernest Hemingway as influences on her lyrics.

==Personal life==
From 2004 to 2007, Newsom dated fellow musician Bill Callahan. He provided guest vocals on her song &quot;Only Skin&quot; from her second studio album &quot;Ys&quot;.

She met comedian Andy Samberg in 2006 at one of her concerts. They married on September 21, 2013, in Big Sur, California.

In March 2014, Newsom and Samberg purchased the estate Moorcrest in Beachwood Canyon, Los Angeles, which had been owned in the 1920s by the parents of actress Mary Astor, and prior to that was rented by Charlie Chaplin. They also own a home in the West Village of Manhattan, New York.

On August 8, 2017, Samberg&#x27;s representative confirmed that Newsom and Samberg had become parents to their first child, a daughter. In February 2023 The Lonely Island&#x27;s Jorma Taccone reported that the couple had a second child.

<doc id="936701" wikidata="Q958123" url="?curid=936701" title="Fillmore!">
<text>Fillmore! is an American animated television series created by Scott M. Gimple for ABC and, later, Toon Disney. It originally ran for two seasons from 2002 to 2004. A parody of popular police dramas of the 1970s, &quot;Fillmore!&quot; is centered on reformed juvenile delinquent Cornelius Fillmore and his new partner, Ingrid Third, members of the Safety Patrol at X Middle School. The series was aimed at children, but also attracted an older audience with its &#x27;70s references.

It was the last series produced by Walt Disney Television Animation for ABC, before producing shows exclusively with Disney Channel and its sister channels. It maintains a dedicated fanbase and is considered a cult hit. Reruns later aired on Disney Channel, Toon Disney, and Disney XD.

==Premise==
Seventh grader Cornelius Fillmore (voiced by Orlando Brown), a juvenile delinquent with a record, was caught raiding the school&#x27;s new chalk shipment. He was &quot;arrested&quot; and given a choice by the safety patrol officer who caught him: either help him solve another case or spend the rest of middle school in detention. Fillmore decided to help out and he eventually decided to join up with the safety patrol.

The show is based around him and his partner Ingrid Third (voiced by Tara Strong) at X Middle School, which is located in the suburbs of Minneapolis and Saint Paul in Minnesota. The show&#x27;s format parodies that of hard-boiled police dramas. X&#x27;s safety patrol is much more actively involved in student behavior than a typical school&#x27;s safety patrol, and officers often seem to spend more time patrolling than normally attending class, although they can be seen attending at times.

As part of the Safety Patrol at X Middle School, Fillmore and Ingrid solve crimes and mysteries. The series usually presents kid-friendly versions of common crimes, such as stolen scooters, smuggling tartar sauce, holding illegal frog races, and counterfeiting collector cards.

==Characters==
Every character is named after a street in San Francisco, California.

===Main===
* Cornelius C. Fillmore (voiced by Orlando Brown) is a seventh grader at X Middle School and the main protagonist of the series. He is a member of the Safety Patrol. His middle name is never revealed in the series. Fillmore was a juvenile delinquent; his crimes included &quot;chalk boosting&quot;, &quot;milk counterfeiting&quot;, and &quot;back talkery&quot;. Fillmore&#x27;s life changed when Safety Patrol member Wayne Liggit gave him a choice: spend the rest of middle school in detention or help him solve another case. Said choice came after he got busted for boosting a chalk shipment a few months after a world record bowl of custard sabotage attempt when the head of the Home Economics Department, Mr Geary, had called him &quot;a lost cause&quot; in class a few days beforehand which made Fillmore want to prove him right. Fillmore was recruited into the Safety Patrol as a result of his helping out. It is revealed in the episodes &quot;A Forgotten Yesterday&quot; and &quot;Immune to All but Justice&quot; that during his days of being a juvenile delinquent, he was partners-in-crime with Sonny Lombard and Penny Madrid, both of whom are still delinquents. This, along with his own criminal history, brought him into close contact with Student Council Representative Peabody causing them to have history which still continues to this day. It is shown that he&#x27;s an only child, has a pet dog and a pet fish, which died in &quot;Next Stop, Armageddon&quot; causing him to get a replacement. In &quot;The Nineteenth Hole is a Shallow Grave&quot; Fillmore is shown to be skilled at mini golf and always was. So he decided to try for the X Middle School mini golf team during his delinquent days. But because of his discipline problems he was not allowed in. So he challenged the whole team to a match as retribution for not letting him play. There, he beat them so badly and completely for everything that they had, that they never played the game again and neither did he. It is revealed that he kept the golf club that he used in said match with six notches etched into it as a representation of the six lives that he ruined. At the end of the episode, he makes amends and gives back the team his ill-gotten winnings along with the trophy he won as interest. After which he once again challenges the team to a match, only this time just for fun. He is known for going above and beyond the standards of other Safety Patrol officers. He almost never loses a target even if it means destroying school property, which he happens to do a lot, much to the dismay of Jr. Commissioner Vallejo. Before moving to X Middle School, he lived in Cleveland, Ohio.
* Ingrid Third (voiced by Tara Strong) is Fillmore&#x27;s goth best friend and partner on the X Middle School Safety Patrol. Before her arrival at X Middle School, Ingrid was sent to a reform school in Nepal for an incident involving a stinkbomb and a piñata. Ingrid, another former delinquent and a certified genius due to her photographic memory, arrives at X Middle School and partners with Fillmore after he helped her clear her name in &quot;Ingrid Third, Public Enemy #1&quot;. Her father is a professor and she has an older sister named Ariella. Her mother is seen but never mentioned. It is revealed in &quot;The Unseen Reflection&quot; that she played Little League for two years.
* Horatio Vallejo (voiced by Horatio Sanz) is the junior commissioner of the Safety Patrol and Fillmore&#x27;s immediate superior. Vallejo has had some rough experiences in the Safety Patrol as an officer: losing his friend and fellow safety patrol officer Malika to the Red Robins, a distorted girl scout troop after she went undercover and went bad leaving the force, and unintentionally betraying his partner and best friend, Frank Bishop, after he refused to speak out against his expulsion from the force, believing it would threaten his chances of becoming commissioner. Vallejo has issues with drinking too much cocoa, which is a kid-friendly version of issues with excessive caffeine or alcohol. Vallejo is often put at odds against Fillmore, such as when he is forced to take Fillmore off a case even though he does not want to, or Fillmore is close to solving it. He also often refuses Fillmore for his reckless destruction of school property, which usually allows Fillmore to catch the criminal, but makes both him and the safety patrol look bad. The only thing that gets Vallejo more mad is when he sees how much it is going to cost to repair the damages, caused by Fillmore. Vallejo&#x27;s catchphrase is yelling &quot;Fillmore!&quot;, which he does in almost every episode when he hears of something Fillmore broke, like a waxer, or ordering expensive walkie talkies by tricking him into signing his signature. Another running gag is that his first name is either unknown or covered up throughout the series.
* Karen Tehama (voiced by Lauren Tom) is the crime scene investigator on the Safety Patrol who has a keen interest in forensics and can usually be counted on to know the word on the street. Although she appears in almost every episode, she is more of a background character.
* Joseph Anza (voiced by Danny Tamberelli) is the partner of Karen Tehama, known for his bodyguarding training and like Tehama, tends to know the word on the street. Although he appears in almost every episode, he is more of a background character.
* Danny O&#x27;Farrell (voiced by Kyle Sullivan) is the crime scene photographer for the Safety Patrol, though it is often joked that he should not be qualified to be a Safety Patroller by Vallejo. He has a tendency to get on other people&#x27;s nerves and has some deep thoughts, overreacting, and weird ideas. O&#x27;Farrell serves as the comic relief on the show. He is also able to develop film with common household items as seen in &quot;Masterstroke of Malevolence&quot;. His name, red hair and kilt characterize him as Scottish.
* Dawn S. Folsom (voiced by Wendie Malick) is the principal of X Middle School, though she acts like a District Attorney or a mayor figure in crime shows or is similar to M from the James Bond series. In context of the show&#x27;s police drama parody theme, she represents the overstressed, image-conscious mayor archetype, where in every episode she threatens to turn the Safety Patrol office into something else if they are unable to solve the case. Tough on the outside with looks that can stop any student in their tracks, she runs her school with a strong presence – but she does it for pride and honor. She does have a kind heart on the inside and does much for her students and staff, sometimes anonymously. It is stated that she is about 40 years old, as in &quot;Next Stop, Armageddon&quot; it is her birthday, and Vallejo mentions that &quot;this year, it starts with a 4&quot;.
* Vice Principal Raycliff (voiced by Jeff Probst) is the school&#x27;s vice principal and Folsom&#x27;s right-hand man. Though he acts like a secretary or as a vice mayor in crime shows, he never really says much, but can be counted on to gush out school facts, figures and catchy metaphors at the drop of a hat. It is possible that he attended school with Folsom, according to an old school album. It is revealed in &quot;Two Wheels, Full Throttle, No Breaks&quot; that he gets seasick.

===Recurring===
* Mr. Collingwood (voiced by Kyle Gass) is one of the teachers at X Middle School.
* Augie Sansome (voiced by Frankie Muniz in &quot;Test of the Tested&quot;, Kiel Holmes in &quot;This Savior, a Snitch&quot;): In the former, he was suspected by Fillmore and Ingrid of stealing the answer sheets to the S.A.T.T.Y. 9 test, but what he really stole turned out to be packets of tartar sauce. In the latter, he wound up being a witness to a set up on Filmore and is asked to testify at a student council meeting to clear Fillmore&#x27;s name.
* Mrs. Cornwall (voiced by Holland Taylor) is the algebra teacher at X Middle School and a student in 1956. She strongly believes in the school&#x27;s honor code. In &quot;A Cold Day at X&quot; she places the answer key to one of her tests out in the open to prove her belief in the code.
* Librarian Lendrum (voiced by Brian George) is X Middle School&#x27;s librarian.
* Cheri Shotwell (voiced by Debi Derryberry) is the lively, bubbly, blonde-haired cheerleader who also serves as a reporter or interviewer. She also frequently hosts parties and sleepovers.
* Philsky (voiced by Michael Welch) is the school&#x27;s reporter, who usually co-anchors with Cheri.
* Vern Natoma (voiced by Marcus Toji): Editor-in-chief of the school&#x27;s newspaper.
* Professor Third (voiced by Anthony Head): College professor and the father of Ingrid and Ariella.
* Jamie Townsend (voiced by Chris Marquette) is a smart student, who wears glasses.
* Proper Kid (voiced by Shaun Fleming) is a blonde-haired boy dressed like a sea captain, which is appropriate, considering that he is a member of the Paddle Boat Club. He is so called due to his always pointing out what is fit.
* Lab Coat Kid #1 (voiced by Chris Marquette): As his title suggests, he is one of the kids who wear lab coats and often involved in the lab or science class.
* Wade (voiced by Michael Welch) is another blonde X Middle School reporter.
* Wayne Ligget (voiced by Lukas Behnken) is Fillmore&#x27;s original Safety Patrol partner before he eventually moved away and was replaced by Ingrid when she came to X. He is best friends with Fillmore, and before Ingrid became Filmore&#x27;s partner, Filmore refused to have any partners because he was still greatly affected by Wayne&#x27;s departure. He has light brown hair. As such, little is known about him and his background, but he is referenced a few times. However, he and Fillmore would meet up again in &quot;South of Friendship, North of Honor&quot;, when the latter went to Tennessee where the former is based and resides currently to take on a case there. Fillmore helps Wayne take down the schools distorted patrol sheriff and Wayne is subsequently named as his school&#x27;s new safety patrol sheriff.
* Frankie Polk (voiced by Lukas Behnken) is a blonde-haired boy who has an affinity for sketching and painting, and as such, is president of the Art Club.
* Sarah Beel (voiced by Mae Whitman) is one of several students at X Middle School who either bear malice to the school mascot, Lobstee the Lobster, or to anything else associated with lobstering, in Sarah&#x27;s case, being the latter. She was accused of damaging the &quot;Lobsterman at Port&quot; painting at an art museum in &quot;Masterstroke of Malevolence&quot;

==Production==
The theme song for the show was written and performed by filk band Ookla the Mok. It appears on their album &quot;Super Secret&quot;, as the intro to the song &quot;Das Über Tüber, or the Mystery of Mr. P.&quot;

The announcer of the series was voice actor Don LaFontaine, best known for his catchphrase &quot;In a world...&quot;

<text>Minnesota State Highway 1 (MN 1) is a state highway across northern Minnesota, United States, which runs from North Dakota Highway 54 (ND 54) at the North Dakota state line (at the Red River in Oslo) and continues east to its eastern terminus at MN 61 at the unincorporated community of Illgen City in Beaver Bay Township on the North Shore of Lake Superior. At in length, MN 1 is the longest state route in Minnesota.

==Route description==

MN 1 serves as an east–west route between Oslo, Warren, Thief River Falls, Red Lake, Northome, Cook, Tower, Ely, and Beaver Bay Township.

The roadway passes through the following forests:

* Finland State Forest in Lake County
* Superior National Forest in Lake and Saint Louis counties
* Bear Island State Forest in Lake and Saint Louis counties
* Kabetogama State Forest in Saint Louis County
* George Washington State Forest in Itasca County
* Koochiching State Forest in Koochiching County

The route runs concurrently with MN 169 for from Vermilion Lake Township (west of Tower) to Ely.

MN 1 also runs concurrently with MN 89 for on the southwest side of Red Lake. This is the longest concurrency with another state highway within Minnesota.
==History==
Most of MN 1 was authorized in 1933, except for a section between U.S. Highway 75 (US 75) and MN 32 at Thief River Falls, which was part of Minnesota Constitutional Route 33 authorized in 1920.

The route was given the MN 1 designation because it was one of the longest trunk highways, and would allow re-use of the MN 1 markers removed from along US 61 and US 65 in 1934.

When it was marked in 1934, it was only paved from US 75 to MN 32 and from MN 169 to Ely.

As recently as 1963, significant portions of MN 1 were unpaved.

MN 1 still had an unpaved segment in 1996, between US 53 and MN 169 in northern Saint Louis County. At that point it was swapped with paved County Road 22.

<text>Bastiaan Johan Christiaan &quot;Bas Jan&quot; Ader (19 April 1942 – disappeared 1975) was a Dutch conceptual and performance artist, and photographer. His work was in many instances presented as photographs and film of his performances. He made performative installations, including &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Leave Me&quot; (1969).

Ader was lost at sea in 1975, attempting to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the American coast to England sailing in a thirteen-foot sailboat. His deserted vessel was found off the coast of Ireland on 18 April 1976, offering few clues as to his fate.

==Early life and education==
Born on 19 April 1942, Ader grew up in Drieborg, a small village in the Dutch province of Groningen. His parents were both Calvinist ministers. His father was executed in 1944 by the Nazis for his large scale endeavors to help Jewish compatriots to escape the Holocaust.

During adolescence, Ader took art classes at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam, and later in the United States during a study abroad program. Ader graduated from the Otis College of Art and Design in 1965 with a BFA, and from the Claremont Graduate University in 1967. After graduating, he taught at various institutions, including Mt. San Antonio College, Immaculate Heart College, and the University of California, Irvine.

==Works==
Ader created a handful of photographs as well as several short black-and-white films in which he is the sole performer.

One of his most famous works, &quot;I&#x27;m too sad to tell you&quot;, consists of a 3-minute silent black-and-white movie of him crying, several photographs (long hair and short hair versions) and a post card mailed to his friends with the inscription &quot;I&#x27;m too sad to tell you&quot;. Other films include him sitting on a chair on a pitched roof until he falls, one where he is hanging on a branch until his grip gives out and he falls into a stream, and a film in which he rides his bike into a canal.

In 1969–70 he anonymously published the satirical conceptual art magazine &quot;Landslide&quot; with his friend William Leavitt. The magazine featured &quot;interviews&quot; with nonexistent artists, such as &quot;Brian Shitart&quot;, and pranks such as &quot;expandable sculpture&quot; which was five packing peanuts in an envelope. Although satirical of conceptual art, the magazine itself is considered a work of conceptual art.

In 1973 he made the work &#x27;In search of the miraculous (One night in Los Angeles)&#x27;, a series of photographs showing a lonely figure wandering through the night in L.A, searching everywhere with a flashlight. It was the first part of a triptych. The second part would be the record of his Atlantic crossing (see below), the third part a similar night time search somewhere in the Netherlands, again to be recorded in a series of photographs.
He had arranged for a choir to sing sea shanties at a gallery in Los Angeles before his departure from Cape Cod. A similar performance was planned upon his arrival in a museum in Groningen, Netherlands.
Due to his loss at sea, the triptych was never completed. The title &quot;In Search of the Miraculous&quot; was a reference to P.D. Ouspensky&#x27;s mystical book &quot;In Search of the Miraculous&quot;.

==Disappearance==
On 9 July 1975, Ader set off from Cape Cod and the U.S. state of Massachusetts in a modified &quot;Guppy 13&quot; pocket cruiser named &quot;Ocean Wave&quot;, to make his single-handed west–east crossing of the North Atlantic. He estimated that the voyage should take him some two and a half months. His unmanned boat was found on 18 April 1976, nine months after he had set sail, floating nearly vertically in the water, bow down, 200 nautical miles (360 km) due west of Land&#x27;s End, 100 nautical miles SW of Ireland. &quot;Ocean Wave&quot; was found by Spanish fishermen who took her to A Coruña from where she was stolen somewhere between 18 May and 7 June 1976.

How Ader may have met his death is the source of much speculation. Sightings of him and his boat off the American East Coast and the Azores are unconfirmed. Ader was an accomplished sailor, having been one of a two-handed crew, sailing a yacht from Morocco to California in 1962–63. His brother Erik, an experienced ocean sailor, thinks that the fixed point on the boat to which his lifeline was attached was ripped out when he fell overboard in heavy weather. His conclusion is based on interviews with people in Spain who saw his retrieved boat before it was stolen.

==Exhibitions, reception and impact==
In 1961, Ader exhibited his works at three galleries in Washington DC and received a positive review in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. He became a minor sensation, being interviewed by &quot;The Voice of America&quot; and by the press in his native Holland. In 1967, he gained his Master of Fine Arts with his project &quot;Implosion&quot; at Claremont Graduate School.

During his lifetime, Ader had solo exhibitions at the Chouinard Art School, Los Angeles (1970), the Pomona College Museum of Art (1972), and the galleries Art &amp; Project, Amsterdam (1972), Kabinett für Aktuelle Kunst, Bremerhaven, Germany (1972, 1974) and the Claire S. Copley Gallery, blogs.getty.edu; accessed 8 April 2015.

Ader held a two-person exhibition with William Leavitt at the Nova Scotia School of Art and Design (1972), a conceptual hotbed at the time, as well as a number of group exhibitions in Europe and the US with such artists as Leavitt, Ger van Elk, Gilbert &amp; George, Jack Goldstein, Allen Ruppersberg, John Baldessari, and Marcel Broodthaers among others. His work was also included in the important international survey exhibitions &quot;Prospekt &#x27;71: Projektion&quot; at the Kunsthalle Düsseldorf (1971), and &quot;Sonsbeek &#x27;71&quot;, Groningen, Holland. (1971).

Since his disappearance, Ader&#x27;s work has been exhibited in solo exhibitions at institutions worldwide including the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam (1988), the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam (1993, 2006), Kunstverein München, Munich (1994, 2000), Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris (1994), Kunstverein Braunschweig, Germany (2000), Portikus, Frankfurt (2003), and the Museo Tamayo Arte Contemporáneo, Mexico City (2004).

Ader&#x27;s first retrospective in the United States took place in 1999 at the University of California, Irvine, and travelled to two other venues; the Mary Porter Sesnon Art Gallery, University of California, Santa Cruz, and the Sweeney Art Gallery at the University of California, Riverside. It was curated by Brad Spence with a catalogue including contributions by Thomas Crow, Jan Tumlir, and Spence. In 2006, Camden Arts Centre, London held a European retrospective of his works which travelled to the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam and the Kunsthalle, Basel, Switzerland.

More recent solo exhibitions include In Search of the Miraculous: 30 Years Later, at Centro Gallego de Arte Contemporáneo, Santiago de Compostela, Spain (2010), Suspended Between Laughter and Tears, Pitzer Art Galleries, Pitzer College, Claremont CA (2010), which travelled to the Museo de Arte Zapopan, Mexico, and the artist&#x27;s first Italian retrospective Tra Due Mondi, MAMbo, Museo d&#x27;Arte Moderna di Bologna, Bologna, Italy (2013). Metro Pictures, NYC, had a mini-survey of his work during summer 2016, as did Simon Lee Gallery in London.

Erika Yeomans&#x27; conceptual documentary &quot;In Search of Bas Jan&#x27;s Miraculous&quot; (1998, 40 minutes, mixed media) on Ader&#x27;s life and art was featured on &quot;This American Life&quot; in 1996.

&quot;Here Is Always Somewhere Else&quot; is a 2007 documentary film about the life and work of Ader. As seen through the eyes of fellow emigrant filmmaker Rene Daalder, the picture becomes an overview of contemporary art films, featuring work from artists Tacita Dean, Rodney Graham, Marcel Broodthaers, Ger van Elk, Charles Ray, Wim T. Schippers, Chris Burden, Fiona Tan, Pipilotti Rist and many others.

Ader was one of the invited artists of the 2017 57th Venice Biennale.

In 2023, Ader was featured in a major retrospective exhibition at Meliksetian Briggs in Dallas curated by David Quadrini.

US band Bright Eyes included a song named ‘Bas Jan Ader’ on their 2024 album &quot;Five Dice, All Threes.&quot;

<doc id="936719" wikidata="Q3294091" url="?curid=936719" title="Gödel (programming language)">
<text>Gödel is a declarative, general-purpose programming language that adheres to the logic programming paradigm. It is a strongly typed language, the type system being based on many-sorted logic with parametric polymorphism. It is named after logician Kurt Gödel.

==Features==
Gödel has a module system, and it supports arbitrary precision integers, arbitrary precision rationals, and also floating-point numbers. It can solve constraints over finite domains of integers and also linear rational constraints. It supports processing of finite sets. It also has a flexible computation rule and a pruning operator which generalises the commit of the concurrent logic programming languages.

Gödel&#x27;s meta-logical facilities provide support for meta-programs that do analysis, transformation, compilation, verification, and debugging, among other tasks.

==Sample code==

The following Gödel module is a specification of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. It is intended to demonstrate the declarative nature of Gödel, not to be particularly efficient.
The codice_1 predicate says that if codice_2 and codice_3 are not zero, then codice_4 is a common divisor of codice_2 and codice_3 if it lies between codice_7 and the smaller of codice_2 and codice_3 and divides both codice_2 and codice_3 exactly.
The codice_12 predicate says that codice_4 is a greatest common divisor of codice_2 and codice_3 if it is a common divisor of codice_2 and codice_3, and there is no codice_18 that is also a common divisor of codice_2 and codice_3 and is greater than codice_4.

 MODULE GCD.
 IMPORT Integers.
 PREDICATE Gcd : Integer * Integer * Integer.
 Gcd(i,j,d) &lt;- 
 CommonDivisor(i,j,d) &amp;
 ~ SOME [e] (CommonDivisor(i,j,e) &amp; e &gt; d).
 PREDICATE CommonDivisor : Integer * Integer * Integer.
 CommonDivisor(i,j,d) &lt;-
 IF (i = 0 \/ j = 0)
 THEN
 d = Max(Abs(i),Abs(j))
 ELSE
 1 =&lt; d =&lt; Min(Abs(i),Abs(j)) &amp;
 i Mod d = 0 &amp;
 j Mod d = 0.

<text>Golden Hill State Park is a state park located in Niagara County, New York, United States. The park is on the south shore of Lake Ontario in the northeast corner of the Town of Somerset, north of Lower Lake Road. Thirty Mile Point Light is included within the park.

Golden Hill State Park was established in 1962 on the former estate of Robert Newell, a local industrialist; remnants of Newell&#x27;s estate were largely left abandoned after the state purchased it and were not rediscovered until 2017.

The park offers picnic tables with pavilions, a playground and playing fields, recreation programs, a nature trail, hiking and biking, fishing and ice fishing, a boat launch, seasonal small game and waterfowl hunting, a campground with tent and trailer sites, ice skating, cross-country skiing, snowmobiling and disc golf.

In 2005, Golden Hill was named one of Reserve America&#x27;s Top Outdoor locations.

<doc id="936733" wikidata="Q1617778" url="?curid=936733" title="High Level Bridge, River Tyne">
<text>The High Level Bridge is a road and railway bridge spanning the River Tyne between Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead in North East England. It was built by the Hawks family from 5,050tons of iron. George Hawks, Mayor of Gateshead, drove in the last key of the structure on 7 June 1849, and the bridge was officially opened by Queen Victoria later that year.

It was designed by Robert Stephenson to form a rail link towards Scotland for the developing English railway network; a carriageway for road vehicles and pedestrians was incorporated to generate additional revenue. The main structural elements are tied cast-iron arches.

It continues to carry rail traffic, although the King Edward bridge nearby was opened in 1906 to ease congestion. The roadway is also still in use, with a weight restriction. It is a Grade I listed structure.

==First bridge proposals==
In 1835, the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway (N&amp;CR) Act authorised the line to approach Newcastle to a terminus at Redheugh, on the south bank of the River Tyne, close to the end of the present-day New Redheugh Bridge. The Act also authorised a crossing of the Tyne there, giving rail access to the north shore quays. The river was shallow at this point, and the bridge would have been at a low level, only above high water. The line would then have climbed to a terminus at the Spital, near Neville Street and the east end of the present-day Newcastle Central station. The climb was to be at a gradient of 1 in 22 and would have been operated by a stationary steam engine with rope haulage.

Hitherto railways in the region had had a local focus, but now the Great North of England Railway (GNER) obtained authorising Acts to build from Newcastle to York, forming part of a continuous trunk railway network to connect to London; the project was controlled by George Hudson, the so-called &quot;Railway King&quot;. At first the GNER was content to get access to the N&amp;CR Newcastle terminus, by connecting with the N&amp;CR at Redheugh and running over its line across the Tyne and up to the Spital. This had the advantage of avoiding a separate, and expensive, crossing of the river, but would have meant a steep descent to Redheugh as the GNER line approached on high ground from the Team Valley, only to climb once again to the Spital. Moreover, William Brandling had made known his intention to reach Newcastle from his line by running at a high level through Gateshead. On 25 April 1837, the N&amp;CR decided to build to their south side, low-level terminus at Redheugh, but to leave the issue of the Tyne crossing open.

Richard Grainger was a developer in Newcastle, and had acquired lands at Elswick (on the north bank of the Tyne west of the proposed Redheugh crossing). In 1836, he published a pamphlet recommending a crossing of the Tyne there, and the formation of spacious railway terminal accommodation there. Drawing attention to the limited scope for extending eastwards from the Spital, and &quot;in the event of an Edinburgh Railway also terminating in this situation, the interchange of passengers, goods, and cattle would be greatly increased&quot;.

Grainger&#x27;s plan was not adopted, and the Brandling Junction Railway reached Gateshead in 1839. The GNER ran out of money and it was superseded in Hudson&#x27;s railway empire by the Newcastle and Darlington Junction Railway, which opened its line using the Brandling Junction Railway from the south east instead of through the Team Valley. The Brandling Junction line had a terminus in Gateshead at Greenesfield at a high level, and the N&amp;CR line was built climbing on an inclined plane at a gradient of 1 in 23 from Redheugh to reach that. The Newcastle and Darlington Junction Railway opened its line from the south to Pelaw, allowing its trains to reach Gateshead over the Brandling Junction line, in 1844. The tables had been turned, and indeed for a while Greenesfield was the de facto main station for the conurbation of Newcastle and Gateshead.

John and Benjamin Green were a father and son architectural practice active in Newcastle. In 1841 Benjamin Green had proposed a high level bridge for road traffic, substantially on the alignment of the actual High Level Bridge; and sensing the commercial climate he explained how it could be adapted for railway use. He failed to get any financial support, but in 1843 George Hudson was looking for ways to extend his railway network northwards, and the Greens&#x27; scheme fitted with his takeover of the Newcastle and Darlington Junction Railway; the line got its authorising Act on 22 May 1844, and the Act included the road bridge.

==Definite plans==

The Newcastle and North Shields Railway had opened in 1839 from its own terminus at Carliol Square, on the north-east edge of Newcastle. As a purely local concern, the disconnection was not important, but interest gathered in a railway to central Scotland; the &quot;Edinburgh Railway&quot; foreseen by Grainger. A Scottish concern, the North British Railway, had got its Act of Parliament the previous year to build as far south as Berwick (later known as Berwick-upon-Tweed.

Now Hudson was intent on capturing the line to Edinburgh for his empire, and he encouraged the development of railway plans to get there; the route such a line might take continued to generate considerable controversy. There was still ambiguity about Hudson&#x27;s intentions for the bridge—an easier crossing point at Bill Quay, two miles downstream had been considered—and Newcastle Town Council sought undertakings from him. In addition, he promised a footway crossing; this was apparently not a sweetener to the Town Council, but a commercial decision, expected to bring in £250 a week. The footway crossing was later extended to include horse-drawn vehicles.

Finally, the Newcastle and Berwick Railway was authorised by Act of Parliament of 31 July 1845. The line would cross the Greens&#x27; high level bridge, starting from the Gateshead Greenesfield station, and commitments made to the building of a bridge by the Newcastle and Darlington Junction Railway were transferred to the Newcastle and Berwick Railway.

==Design==

The bridge was to be designed by Robert Stephenson; T E Harrison did the detailed design work.

The height of the railway, at about above high water, was determined by the level of the Brandling Junction line in Gateshead. A double-deck configuration was selected because of road levels on the approaches, and to avoid the excess width of foundations which a side-by-side arrangement would require. The deck width was determined by the useful roadway width plus the width of structural members, which gave the railway deck the width for three tracks.

The foundations were to be difficult because of the poor ground conditions in the river, and this ruled out an all-masonry structure, so cast iron or wrought iron was inevitable for the superstructure. A tied arch (or bow-string) design was favoured because the outward thrust imposed by an arch is contained by the tie; no abutments capable of resisting the thrust could be provided here.

Stephenson had used this configuration before; he recorded that, &quot;The earliest railway bridge on the bowstring principle is that over the Regent&#x27;s Canal, near Chalk Farm, on the London and Birmingham Railway&quot;.

The arch would consist of iron ribs. Fawcett says, &quot;The reasons for not using wrought iron was due to some engineers&#x27; distrust of rivetting, the relatively small size of wrought iron plates then available, and the higher cost… On 1 October 1845 when the Newcastle and Berwick Board instructed T E Harrison for their bridges, none of the uses of wrought iron had been developed far enough to be considered as an alternative to cast iron for the High Level Bridge. A tubular bridge might have been considered by Robert Stephenson but the distance between solid and reasonably shallow foundations would have given a span much larger than the Britannia Bridge.&quot;

The depth of rock in the riverbed resulted in a height of from there to the superstructure. Three river piers were permitted by the Tyne Improvement Commissioners, and therefore four river spans of were decided on; there were additional subsidiary spans on the shore.

The cast iron arch ribs are deep at the crown, increasing to at the springing, with flanges; the flanges and webs were three inches thick; in the case of the inner ribs, and two inches for the outer ribs. The rise was , determined by the desired geometry to confine the horizontal thrust within bounds. Each arch was cast in five sections, bolted together.

Stephenson described the tie bars:

The ties consist of flat wrought-iron bars, 7 inches by 1 inch of best scrap iron, with eyes of 3½ inches diameter, bored out of the solid, and pins turned and fitted closely. Each external rib is tied by four of these bars, and each internal rib by eight. The sectional area of each external tie is 28 [square] inches, and of each internal tie 56 [square] inches, giving a total area of 168 square inches. These bars were all tested to 9 tons on the square inch.

The rail deck is supported above the arches by twelve square columns at centres. Suspension rods supported the road deck, and both decks had two layers of diagonally laid three-inch deck timbers on suitable wrought iron cross girders (and rail-bearers in the case of the rail deck).

The main contractors for the ironwork were Hawks, Crawshay, and Sons, who were assisted by John Abbot and Co., of Gateshead Park Works, and Losh Wilson and Bell, of Walker Ironworks, in the production of the castings. The tender was accepted at £112,000. The contract for the bridge piers and land arches and for the Newcastle Viaduct were won by John Rush and Benjamin Lawton of York for £94,000 and £82,500 respectively. The total cost of the contracts at 1999 prices would be over £30million.

==Construction==
The first masonry was laid on 12 January 1847. A temporary timber viaduct on the east side was ready on 20 August 1848.

Timber coffer dams were constructed; they were by with two skins, the space between being filled with puddle clay. James Nasmyth had a novel design of steam pile driver; it had first been used in Devonport Docks in 1845; it could deliver 60 to 70 blows a minute; the cycle time with the hand-operated pile drivers formerly in use was four minutes. The drop weight was 1½tons and its stroke was ; one was purchased from Nasmyth.

The ground gave considerable trouble during construction; Stephenson recorded:

Many difficulties occurred in driving the piles which considerably retarded the progress of the work, and, among others, the peculiar effect of ebb and flow during this operation is worthy of note. At flood-tide, the sand became so hard as almost totally to resist the utmost efforts of driving, while at ebb the sand was quite loose, and allowed of doing so with facility. It was therefore found necessary to abandon the driving on many occasions during high water. The difference between high and low water is 11 feet 6 inches. Another difficulty arose from the quicksands beneath the foundations. Although the piles were driven to the rock bottom, the water forced its way up, baffling the attempts to fill in between them; this, however, was remedied by using a concrete made of broken stone and Roman cement, which was continually thrown in until the bottom was found to be secure.

The arch ribs were erected in section by travelling crane; each arch was temporarily erected at the contractor’s works. The first was placed on 10 July 1848, and the erection of the ironwork was quick.

Already on 29 August 1848, it was possible to pass a special train over the first arch, and over a temporary structure for the rest of the crossing:

The High Level Bridge Over the Tyne: This important junction between the York and Newcastle and the Newcastle and Berwick Railway has been completed, and the event was celebrated on Tuesday last. In the afternoon of that day, a train of [specially invited] passengers passed along the temporary timber viaduct from the station at Gateshead to the station at Newcastle. Mr Hudson and several other Directors of the York, Newcastle, and Berwick line, who had been visiting Sunderland ... proceeded in a special train from that town to Gateshead... Several carriages were then added to the special train, and an open truck placed at each end, in which bands of music were stationed. The shrill sound of the whistle gave the signal for a royal salute, under the booming of which the train passed along the line, the band playing, and the thousands assembled to witness the event, rending the air with joyous acclamation Upon reaching the bridge, the bands struck up the well-known local air of &quot;The Keel Row&quot; which they continued till the train had reached the solid ground on the northern side of the river... The train proceeded to the Newcastle and Berwick station, where the company alighted and walked in procession to the Queen’s Head Inn, where a magnificent entertainment had been provided for the Directors and their friends, by the Mayor of Newcastle.

[From the south abutment of the High Level Bridge] and the river pier on the south side, the cast iron arch and road-way are nearly completed, and the second arch will be in progress in the course of a few weeks. From the middle of the first arch, the line curves to a temporary timber viaduct erected along the west side of the intended bridge. The height of this viaduct is one hundred and twenty feet to the level of the rails; it is built upon piles, which are driven between thirty and forty feet into the bed of the river. Its stability was sufficiently tested on Monday, when Captain Leffan (sic), the Government Inspector of Railways, examined it preparatory to the opening. On that day, two powerful engines weighing upwards of seventy tons, traversed it at different degrees of speed for between two and three hours; the weight would be about one ton to a foot, being four or five times greater than the temporary structure will ever be required to bear, and the result was, in the highest degree, satisfactory.

Among the company in the train were four ladies, who are deserving of honourable mention, from the courage they displayed in accompanying it, namely, Mrs Nichs. Wood, and Miss F. Wood, Mrs I. L. Bell, and her sister, Miss Pattinson of Washington. As the train passed steadily over the bridge the anxiety of the immense multitude seemed intense, and the scene was truly exciting, yet fearful—not only from the lofty eminence occupied by the train but, from the apparent narrowness and nakedness of the platform on which it rolled along. It seemed from its noiselessness, rather an aerial flight, than the rattling sweep of the iron horse.

Ordinary traffic appears to have used the temporary single line structure after this date.

The eastern track was ready for an inspection by Captain Laffan, Inspecting Office for the Board of Trade, when he visited on 11 August 1849; a load test with four tender locomotives and eighteen wagons loaded with ballast, a total weight of 200tons. Laffan approved the bridge:

I believe all the works of the bridge are completed, and that I believe it to be perfectly secure and safe. The Company have as yet only laid one line of rails over this structure, and I beg to recommend that permission be given to open that one line.

The first passenger train crossed the completed structure on the morning of 15 August 1849.

Queen Victoria formally inaugurated the bridge on passing through by train on 28 September 1849.

The Queen at Newcastle: Her Majesty yesterday honoured this ancient borough with her presence. The event was one of universal and all-engrossing interest... The morning, unfortunately, was dull and the weather unsettled, giving forebodings of a wet and uncomfortable day... Notwithstanding, however, the unfavourable weather dense crowds assembled at every spot in this locality, where a view of the royal carriage could be obtained, and many remained for hours exposed to the weather in order that they might retain the places which at an earlier period of the morning they had secured. The bridge was densely lined with people, and the platform was well covered, though not inconveniently crowded. A profusion of banners were displayed on this elegant and substantial structure, and from nearly all the public and many of the private buildings both in Newcastle and Gateshead. The vessels in the river hoisted their flags mast-high on the occasion, and the church bells of the two towns rung many a merry peal in honour of the royal visit... Pursuant to a request issued by the Mayor, most of the shops were closed about 11 o’clock, and the manufacturers were desired by our worthy chief magistrate &quot;not to produce smoke between that hour and one,&quot; with which we believe, they generally complied... At precisely twenty minutes past twelve, the royal carriage appeared in sight, and when it reached the Spital, a splendid locomotive, built by the celebrated house of Stephenson and Co., gaily decorated and bearing on its front &quot;God save the Queen&quot; surmounted by a crown, and a suitable inscription encircling the boiler, was attached to the train. It then slowly proceeded to the centre of the colossal fabric, amidst bursts of loud and rapturous cheering from the assembled thousands, her Majesty repeatedly acknowledging these marked demonstrations of loyalty and affection from her faithful and attached subjects.
The Mayors of Newcastle and Gateshead presented a formal address. The queen travelled in the royal carriage belonging to the London and North Western Railway.

In other carriages were members of her Majesty’s suite and the directors of the York, Newcastle, and Berwick Railway. The engine drawing the royal train was under the direction of Mr T. E. Harrison, the resident engineer, and driven by Mr Thos. Carr... After staying altogether from five to ten minutes, the train was again put in motion, and amidst firing of artillery and rapturous plaudits from the dense throng, proceeded en route to Darlington.

The bridge and its immediate approaches had cost £243,000.

==Road usage==
The road deck was opened in 1850.

The company charged tolls on use of the road crossing; a pedestrian paid a halfpenny, and the crossing was open from 5am until 6pm, although from June 1871 24-hour access was made available.

About 1880, a horse bus service was operated across the bridge; the fare was a halfpenny, the same as the pedestrian toll; the bus operator paid a toll of 4d.

Addyman considers that road vehicle toll income was less than might have been expected (£2,000 in 1853), and attributes this to the success of suburban passenger railway business.

In the twentieth century street passenger tramways built up in Newcastle and Gateshead, and in 1920 agreement was reached to connect the two systems by running across the High Level Bridge. This was implemented in 1923.

On 10 May 1937, the tolls on the road crossing were removed; Newcastle and Gateshead corporations paid the London and North Eastern Railway, now the owner of the bridge, £160,000 in commutation of the tolls.

==Threatened by fire 1866==
On 24 June 1866, there was a serious fire in a corn mill close to the line on the Newcastle shore. The fire grew and became a total conflagration, and the timber decking of the High Level Bridge caught fire. It appeared this might engulf the entire bridge.

Under the superintendence of the engineers, workmen were told off to cut through the carriage and foot roads, that being the only way of preventing the flames from spreading along the bridge. The men worked with goodwill and soon succeeded in cutting several holes through the asphalt and timber. How to play with the water on the underside was a difficulty soon got over. Four or five men, with a courage most commendable, volunteered to be lowered down, through the holes in the pathway, by means of ropes, enabling them to direct the water directly on to the burning woodwork. For a long time their efforts seemed to be without effect; no sooner was the fire put out in one part of the bridge than another beam burst into flames. For several hours streams of water were thrown against the bridge, ultimately with success. In order to put the spreading of the fire beyond doubt, the workmen on the bridge cut through the entire width of the carriage and footway, making a gap at both the Newcastle and Gateshead side... In no way, however, is the safety of the bridge endangered. The railway traffic was suspended from about half-past eight o&#x27;clock in the morning, until two in the afternoon, not from any apprehensions that the upper level was insecure, but on account of the smoke and flames, and also because of the hose which was lying across the rails.

So serious damage to the bridge was averted, and after a thorough inspection the following day, trains were allowed to resume normal running. The cost of the damage to the bridge was estimated at between £2,000 and £3,000.

==Increasing loads==

When Laffan carried out the load test on opening of the bridge, the locomotives of the day weighed typically 20tons; it was said at the time that the load test imposed &quot;a greater weight in all probability than will ever pass along the bridge again&quot;.

Locomotive weights increased considerably in the succeeding years. The cross-girders supporting the track were cast iron and by 1890 they were considered to require strengthening, which was done with steel box girders.

In 1922, trams were to start crossing the bridge, and the cast iron longitudinal members supporting the roadway were replaced with steel beams and a new deck was provided. In 1937 Newcastle City Council took over responsibility for maintenance of the road surface, but a 9-ton weight limit was imposed; this was increased to 10tons in 1967.

Between 1955 and 1959, the timber deck of the rail level was replaced by steel, and ballasted track was substituted for the earlier way beam track structure, adding 150tons of dead load to each span of the bridge.

In 1983 a further analysis of the capacity of the bridge led to the reduction of the weight limit to 7.5tons. By this time rail vehicles of 100tonnes gross laden weight were operating, and one of the three railway tracks was removed to reduce extreme loading on the structure.

==Listed status==
In 1950, the High Level Bridge was classified as a Grade I listed structure by the Department of the Environment.

==A second crossing==
The High Level Bridge was an important node on the railway network, and as branch line passenger services and mineral traffic built up it became a bottleneck. This was exacerbated by the location of the main locomotive depot for Newcastle being at Gateshead; as many train services changed engines at Newcastle this generated a huge number of light engine movements to and from the depot across the bridge.

At the beginning of the twentieth century proposals were brought forward to build a second, rail-only bridge. This became the King Edward VII Bridge, located a few hundred yards to the west of the High Level Bridge. This started carrying traffic on 1 October 1906, having been formally inaugurated by the King on 10 July 1906. Trains from the southern and south-western districts generally crossed the Tyne on the new bridge, which carried four tracks. Through express passenger trains no longer had to reverse in Newcastle station, and where no engine change was required, a significant time saving was possible.

==Restoration==
To carry out work to ensure its long-term future the bridge was closed to road traffic in February 2005. Maintenance included replacement of timber supports beneath the road deck. The bridge re-opened on 2 June 2008 as severe cracks were found in some of its iron girders. In March 2006 the bridge&#x27;s footpath, which was to have been kept open during the restoration project, was closed at the request of Network Rail due to vandalism and the increasing scale of required works.

Extra crash barriers on each side of the roadway were added leaving space for only one lane of traffic. Previously even double-deck buses had operated through the bridge in both directions.

Where the road deck met the land on the northern side of the river was inside the castle precinct, a complex multi-period archaeological site. Archaeological mitigation work, a standing building recording on the approach arches, and an excavation in advance of the piling required to strengthen the arches was carried out by AAG Archaeology.

==Present day==
The road deck was re-opened only in a southbound (towards Gateshead) direction and carries only buses and taxis; the one-way operation is required because of width considerations after protection to the structural members was inserted. Pedestrians and cyclists use the bridge freely. Railway traffic continues in full use of the bridge, although the majority of mainline trains use the King Edward VII bridge for reasons of convenience.

<text>The first USS &quot;Ellen&quot; was a side-wheel steam gunboat in the United States Navy during the American Civil War.

&quot;Ellen&quot; was built at New York City in 1853 as a civilian ferryboat, and purchased by the Navy on 10 October 1861 at New York; outfitted by New York Navy Yard; and commissioned 16 October 1861.

==Service history==
Assigned to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, &quot;Ellen&quot; stood out on 18 October 1861 for Port Royal, South Carolina, arriving 14 November. &quot;Ellen&quot; exchanged fire with the enemy at Tybee Island on 24 December and on the 31st sailed to take part in the successful joint Army-Navy expedition against Port Royal Ferry on the Coosa River. During 26–29 January 1862 she reconnoitered Wilmington River and Wassaw Sound, Georgia, and engaged five ships under Commodore Josiah Tattnall III, CSN, near Savannah, damaging two of the Confederates.

Early in 1862 &quot;Ellen&quot; participated in an extensive combined expedition to take control of the seacoast of Georgia; by the middle of March Union ships from Port Royal had occupied the entire Georgia coast plus Fernandina, St. Augustine, and the St. Johns River in Florida. Discovered up the St. Johns River on 18 March was the famous racing yacht &quot;America&quot;, captured while in Union service, and later sunk by the Confederates to conceal her from invading Union forces. A week of hard work by , , and &quot;Ellen&quot; raised her. On 26 March &quot;Ellen&quot; towed her to Port Royal, arriving 22 April.

On 28 May 1862 &quot;Ellen&quot; was sent up Folly Inlet to search for a floating battery believed mounted on a hulk. She did not find the battery but was able to report that Stono River was in complete possession of the Union forces. She engaged a short battery at Newton&#x27;s Cut, South Carolina, and on 3 June joined to attack a Confederate battery between Folly River and Light House Inlet. On 16 June she took part in an Army-Navy reconnaissance in the direction of Secessionville, South Carolina, target for an unsuccessful attack by the Army the day before. The remainder of her active service was in the Folly and Stono Rivers.

&quot;Ellen&quot; was decommissioned 30 October 1862, and used as a carpenter shop by the fleet at Port Royal until the war&#x27;s end. She was sold 2 September 1865.

<text>Minnesota State Highway 3 (MN 3) is a state highway in Minnesota, which runs from its intersection with MN 21 in Faribault and continues north to its northern terminus at an intersection with MN 5 in downtown Saint Paul. Until the resigning of a previously unsigned highway in 2019, the route&#x27;s northern terminus was an interchange with MN 62 in Inver Grove Heights.

==Route description==
MN 3 serves as a north-south route between Saint Paul, West Saint Paul, Inver Grove Heights, Eagan, Rosemount, Farmington, Northfield, and Faribault. The highway is primarily a two-lane highway with paved shoulders in rural areas, with some multiple-lane sections in urban areas.

Beginning at its southern terminus in Faribault at MN 21, MN 3 heads due east along
20th Street NW for about 1 mile, before turning north along 2nd Avenue NW. MN 3 then roughly follows the Cannon River toward Northfield, with gentle curves through alternating wooded areas and open farmland. After passing through the Northfield area, MN 3 travels a primarily straight route through open fields heading toward Farmington. Between Farmington and Rosemount, MN 3 is mostly straight. This portion of the route passes by housing developments, farm fields, and a gravel and sand mining operation. Two roundabouts (at 190th Street W and 170th Street W) are also encountered here. Beyond Rosemount, MN 3 passes through the cities of Eagan and Inver Grove Heights. Here, the highway becomes more curvy and built-up than previous sections. MN 3 parallels a rail line through Eagan, and travelling through Inver Grove Heights, the road passes through a heavily wooded area with many sharp turns. MN 3 then travels through a valley and continues to a junction with MN 55. It continues northbound, passing through rolling, wooded hills over a mostly straight path to its junctions at I-494 and MN 62. In 2018-19, the Minnesota Department of Transportation quietly changed the designation of unsigned MN 952A to MN 3, effectively extending the route north through West Saint Paul along Robert Street into downtown Saint Paul.

Legally, MN 3 is defined as legislative routes 1, 115, and 334 in the Minnesota Statutes. The route is not marked with those numbers.

The maximum speed limit posted on MN 3 is 60 mph. The open stretches of MN 3 from Faribault to 170th Street W near Rosemount generally have a 60 mph limit, with lower limits in the Northfield and Farmington areas. All other sections are posted at 55 mph or lower, particularly through cities and curvier portions of the highway. Speed studies were conducted on the highway in 2015 on the Northfield to Eagan section, and in 2018 on the Faribault to Northfield section. The studies authorized a new maximum allowed speed limit of 60 mph from Faribault to the south end of Rosemount.

==History==
MN 3 was established in 1963, from the southern portion of former MN 218. This route was originally numbered 65 as part of old U.S. Highway 65 (US 65) from 1927 to 1934. It was built between Faribault and MN 149 in Inver Grove Heights and was paved as early as 1929.

The route was renumbered 218 in 1934 as part of old US 218 from 1934 to 1935, which was eventually redesignated MN 218 from 1935 to 1963. The route was renumbered MN 3 in 1963.

The route was once part of the Jefferson Highway, an automobile highway stretching through the central U.S. until the late 1920s. MN 3 is still part of unmarked Constitutional Route 1.

From the late 1970s to 1994, MN 3 was previously routed on the Lafayette Freeway through South St. Paul / West St. Paul to downtown Saint Paul. Nearby US 52 was routed on a stretch of Robert Street during this period of time. The Lafayette Freeway was completely constructed in 1994, US 52 was then rerouted along that route and MN 3 was shortened to a northern terminus at its junction with MN 62 in Inver Grove Heights. Recently MnDOT has indicated it considers the stretch of Robert Street from downtown St. Paul through West St. Paul to be Highway 3, and has recently signed the road in West St. Paul with Minnesota Highway 3 shields and reflects the roadway as MN-3 on their project web pages.

The section from MN 5 to near Kellogg Boulevard East in St. Paul is scheduled for turnback, as this section of the legislative route is being removed.

<text>Double Teamed is a 2002 American biographical sports drama film released as a Disney Channel Original Movie and based on the life stories of identical twin professional basketball players Heather and Heidi Burge. The film premiered on January 18, 2002.

==Plot==
In 1985, fourteen-year-old identical twins Heather and Heidi Burge are forced by their overly-pushy father to leave their former school and attend a different school to have better chances at college scholarships. Heidi, however, tended to think that she was athletically inferior to Heather, and in an attempt to get out of Heather&#x27;s shadow, she joined in a school play.

Heather and Heidi are both attending the school to play volleyball rather than basketball, but the girls&#x27; basketball coach notices Heather because of her height. She seizes this opportunity to play basketball to help her train for the coming volleyball season. Heather meets Nicky Williams, the star of the Palos Verdes High School Sea Kings. Heidi, in the meantime, learns that her father told the coach that both of the girls would play on the basketball team, despite the fact that Heidi had already committed to performing in a school play.

Heather and Heidi are both furious over the situation - Heather because she didn&#x27;t want Heidi on the team and Heidi because she thought Heather put their father up to it. Heidi wanted to be independent of Heather and pursue her own interests.

When the twins first start playing for the Sea Kings, they leave a bad impression on the team by lying and implying that they are rich like many of their teammates. Heather and Nicky form a serious rivalry and Nicky even tries to run the Burge twins out of school by telling the school about the Burges&#x27; living situation.

They both eventually befriend Nicky when they see that her father is too preoccupied with business to attend her basketball games. At their first tournament in New York, they win second, and Heather wins MVP. However, in another game, Heidi is selected to take the game winning free throws. This makes Heather, the usual star, extremely jealous, so she later plays a late-night one-on-one game with Galen, a senior basketball star who lives in their apartment complex. While playing, Heather falls and severely twists her ankle, which prevents her from playing their next game. During that next game, while she&#x27;s sitting out, Heather sees the need for teamwork rather than the need to be the &quot;superstar&quot; and decides to play again despite being injured. Her effort is rewarded, and with some clever teamwork, Heidi hits the game-winning basket for the Sea Kings.

After the game, their coach approaches the twins and their parents, Mary and Larry Burge, and tells Mr. and Mrs. Burge they should consider putting the girls in summer basketball camps, saying they have a very bright future. Mr. Burge proudly says that his girls are going to play college ball - but the coach says, &quot;Maybe more. There&#x27;s talk of a women&#x27;s pro-league.&quot; Mr. Burge also apologizes for putting so much pressure on Heather and for forcing Heidi to play basketball in the first place. They forgive him. Mr. Burge says that Heidi has plans for a summer at a drama camp, which pleases her and reveals how important it is to be well-rounded.

A flashfoward is then shown, and both Burge twins are playing on professional WNBA teams. Heidi plays for the Los Angeles Sparks and Heather plays for the Sacramento Monarchs. Heather and Heidi talk before the game, and Heather says, &quot;Once second best, always second best.&quot; The game begins with a tip off and they both jump for the ball.

In reality, the twins&#x27; time in the WNBA did not overlap and they never faced each other in a WNBA game. Heidi retired after only playing two seasons in the WNBA in 1998. Heather would play in the WNBA in 1999 only for 13 games. Most of their professional careers had been overseas before the WNBA&#x27;s first season in 1997.

==Reception==
A reviewer for the &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot; gave a mixed review for &quot;Double Teamed&quot;, saying it was &quot;paint-by-the-numbers&quot; but that the &quot;happy, Disney-style ending is a slam-dunk.&quot;

<doc id="936766" wikidata="Q367166" url="?curid=936766" title="Minnesota State Highway 61">
<text>Minnesota State Highway 61 (MN 61) is a highway in northeast Minnesota, which runs from a junction with Interstate 35 (I-35) in Duluth at 26th Avenue East, and continues northeast to its northern terminus at the Canadian border near Grand Portage, connecting to Ontario Highway 61 at the Pigeon River Bridge. The route is a scenic highway, following the North Shore of Lake Superior, and is part of the Lake Superior Circle Tour designation that runs through Minnesota, Ontario, Michigan, and Wisconsin.

This roadway was designated U.S. Highway 61 (US 61) until 1991. US 61 ran from the Canadian border to New Orleans, and is the road to which musician and Duluth native Bob Dylan referred in the album and song &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot;.

The North Shore Scenic Drive is an All-American Road scenic byway that follows Saint Louis County Road 61 / Lake County Road 61 / MN 61, formerly US 61, from the city of Duluth, Minnesota, to the Canadian border near Grand Portage. The route stays close to the rocky North Shore, offering spectacular vistas of the lake to the southeast as it skirts along the foothills of the Sawtooth Range to the northwest.

==Route description==

MN 61 serves as a northeast–southwest route in northeast Minnesota between Duluth, Two Harbors, Silver Bay, Grand Marais, and the Canadian border.

 of MN 61 from Duluth to Two Harbors is a four-lane expressway officially designated the Arthur Rohweder Memorial Highway. There are no markers on the highway showing this designation, but there is a plaque at a wayside.

The roadway is located close to and in many places next to Lake Superior. Sights include forests, wildlife, cliffs, state parks, and a national monument.

Highway 61 passes through the Superior National Forest and the Grand Portage State Forest in Cook County.

The following state parks are located on Highway 61:
* Gooseberry Falls State Park is located northeast of Two Harbors in Lake County.
* Split Rock Lighthouse State Park is located in Lake County between Two Harbors and Silver Bay.
* Tettegouche State Park is located in Lake County at the base of the Baptism River. The park is located immediately northeast of Silver Bay.
* Temperance River State Park is located immediately northeast of Schroeder in Cook County.
* Cascade River State Park is located in Cook County between Lutsen and Grand Marais.
* Judge C. R. Magney State Park is located on the banks of the Brule River. The park is located northeast of Grand Marais in Cook County.
* Grand Portage State Park is located in Cook County on the banks of the Pigeon River. The community of Grand Portage is nearby.

MN 61 starts on the northern end of Duluth and continues northeasterly towards Two Harbors, the first city outside Duluth and the largest city between Duluth and Grand Portage. MN 61 continues as a four-lane expressway through Two Harbors, then becomes two lanes. After Two Harbors, there are no towns for almost , until reaching Beaver Bay, followed by Silver Bay. Afterwards, MN 61 passes a few state parks before reaching Schroeder, followed by Tofte. After Tofte, the road to Lutsen Mountains ski resort, County Road 5, meets with MN 61. The next town is Lutsen, followed by Cascade River State Park. About further along is Grand Marais, the second largest city after Two Harbors, and another along is Grand Portage; between the two is Hovland. MN 61 bypasses Grand Portage to the west. The northern terminus for MN 61 is at the Canadian border, where it becomes Ontario Highway 61 upon entering Canada at the Pigeon River Bridge; the roadway continues to Thunder Bay.

==History==
Minnesota Highway 61 was designated and signed in 1991. The roadway was originally part of US 61 from 1926 to 1991.

After construction of I-35 in the 1960s, US 61 was co-signed with I-35 until 1991. During that year, US 61 was decommissioned from the Canadian border south to its present-day junction with I-35 at the city of Wyoming near Forest Lake. The section of US 61 north of Duluth was redesignated MN 61 that same year.

MN 61 is one of three state marked highways to carry the same number as an existing U.S. Highway within the state; the others are MN 65 and MN 169.

From 1991 to 1997, MN 61 continued southwest on London Road beyond I-35 to 14th Avenue East, where southbound traffic then turned northwest to end at MN 23 which followed a one-way pair of 2nd Street East (eastbound) and 3rd Street East (westbound); northbound MN 61 began following 12th Avenue East south to London Road. Both routes were turned back to end at their respective I-35 junctions in Duluth in 1997.

===Early history===
MN 61, between Duluth and the Canadian border, was commissioned as part of US 61 in 1926, ready for use by 1929, and paved by 1940.

The section of MN 61 from Hovland to the Pigeon River formerly ran inland, bypassing the community of Grand Portage. The new highway alignment and border crossing were constructed in the early 1960s.

The MN 61 expressway between Duluth and Two Harbors was constructed inland in the 1960s. The state then turned over maintenance of the original US 61 between Duluth and Two Harbors to Saint Louis and Lake counties. The two counties then redesignated this section as CR 61 or Scenic 61.

<text>The  () is a traditional Brazilian dessert. The origin of the dessert is that it was created by a confectioner from Rio de Janeiro, Heloísa Nabuco de Oliveira, to promote the presidential candidacy of Eduardo Gomes. It is made of condensed milk, cocoa powder, butter cooked to Soft-ball stage caramel, with chocolate sprinkles covering the outside layer, making the surface non-sticking.

It is a popular confection throughout the country, especially for festive events. are commonly made at home, and also found in bakeries and snack shops. A is generally shaped into small balls covered in chocolate sprinkles and placed in a small cupcake liner. The mixture may also be poured into a small container and eaten with a spoon; this is known as a (literally, &quot;spoon &quot;). can be found now in different countries as a result of Brazilian migration.

In recent years, flavor and coating variations on the traditional chocolate have become popular. This variation of flavors and easy manipulation of the original dessert lead into a trend of different recipes, such as cakes, tarts, ice cream or even bread.

==History==
The origin of the name &quot;brigadeiro&quot; is linked to the presidential campaign of Brigadier Eduardo Gomes, UDN candidate for the Presidency of the Republic in 1945. Heloísa Nabuco de Oliveira, a member of a traditional &quot;carioca&quot; family who supported the brigadier&#x27;s candidacy, created a new confection and named it after the candidate. The &quot;doce do brigadeiro&quot; (lit. brigadier&#x27;s candy) became popular, and the name was eventually shortened to just &quot;brigadeiro&quot;. Women at the time would sell brigadeiro in support of the presidential candidate, as it was the first national election in which women were able to vote.

Despite the support received, Eduardo Gomes was defeated, and the election was won by then General Eurico Gaspar Dutra.

In the state of Rio Grande do Sul, brigadeiros are most commonly known as negrinhos (literally &quot;little black one&quot;). One researcher traced its origins back to the 1920s, when condensed milk by Nestlé started being sold in Brazil.

<doc id="936769" wikidata="Q7082812" url="?curid=936769" title="Ol' Rip the Horned Toad">
<text>Ol&#x27; Rip the Horned Toad (died January 19, 1929) was a Texas horned lizard⁠ (&quot;Phrynosoma cornutum&quot;), commonly referred to as a &quot;horned toad&quot; or &quot;horny toad&quot;, ⁠which supposedly survived a 31-year hibernation as an entombed animal following its exhumation from a cornerstone in Eastland, Texas, on February 18, 1928. The lizard became a national celebrity and appeared in 1920s motion pictures. Its name was a reference to American writer Washington Irving&#x27;s fictional character Rip Van Winkle. The same year, a Texas political delegation led by Senator Earle Mayfield presented the docile lizard to President Calvin Coolidge at the White House for his inspection.

Following the creature&#x27;s fame, horned toads were sold by the thousands as souvenirs at public events, including the 1928 Democratic National Convention. The ensuing mass capture and export of the horned toads resulted in the genus&#x27;s abrupt decline in West Central Texas and prompted an intervention by the Texas Department of Agriculture.

Decades later, the saga of Ol&#x27; Rip inspired &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; scribe Michael Maltese to write a 1955 animated theatrical short entitled &quot;One Froggy Evening&quot;. In the cartoon, a construction worker demolishing an old building finds an 1892 time capsule inside a cornerstone. The capsule contains a living frog which is able to sing Tin Pan Alley songs such as &quot;Hello! Ma Baby&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Just Wild About Harry&quot;.

== History ==
=== Alleged entombment ===

On July 29, 1897, a four-year-old boy named Will Wood caught a horned toad in Eastland County, Texas. His father, Eastland County clerk Ernest E. Wood, decided to test the West Texas tradition that the creatures could survive for many years in hibernation. The horned lizard was placed in a time capsule in a cornerstone of the Eastland courthouse along with memorabilia, including a Bible and a bottle of alcohol. 

Thirty years later, during the Jazz Age, construction workers began to tear down the old courthouse, and town officials scheduled a public event to open the time capsule in mid-February 1928. An ambitious young newspaperman named Boyce House reported on the forthcoming ceremony in his articles for the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot;. House particularly emphasized the mystery of the horned toad which supposedly had been entombed in the capsule since 1897.

As a result of House&#x27;s sensationalist newspaper articles, a crowd of 1,500 spectators gathered in Eastland, Texas, to witness the opening of the time capsule and to learn the fate of the horned toad. Many spectators had traveled more than 25 miles to be present, and hundreds thronged around the makeshift fence that encircled the old courthouse. At exactly four o&#x27;clock on Saturday, February 18, 1928, a live horned lizard was allegedly produced from within the time capsule in front of the excited audience. Newspaperman Boyce House recalled the chaotic scene:

Within days, national newspaper chains reported the discovery of the entombed lizard on their front pages. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported the event on its front page with the declarative headline: &quot;Toad Alive After 31 Years Sealed in Texas Cornerstone&quot;. The &quot;Times&quot; article credulously reported:

Following these newspaper reports, zoologists and other scientists began a public debate over whether a Texas horned toad could survive such an extended period without water, sunlight, or oxygen. Dr. Raymond L. Ditmars, curator of mammals and reptiles at the Bronx Zoo, declared the alleged survival of the entombed lizard in Eastland, Texas, to be &quot;utterly impossible&quot;. In contrast, preeminent naturalist William T. Hornaday, the curator of the New York Zoological Gardens, asserted that &quot;the incident was possible⁠—and gave an instance from his own experience in Ceylon&quot;. Indifferent to this scientific debate, Eastland locals instead ascribed the horned toad&#x27;s &quot;miraculous&quot; survival for thirty-one years to the presence of the Bible in the time capsule.

=== National fame ===

Due to the extensive media coverage, Ol&#x27; Rip became a national celebrity. The docile lizard was transported to Dallas, Texas, for public exhibition by Will Wood, the same individual who purportedly found the specimen as a boy in 1897. After a public outcry by Eastland inhabitants and profit-hungry business people over removing the famous creature from their otherwise nondescript and insignificant town, Wood returned Ol&#x27; Rip to Eastland. Dallas exhibitors promptly sued Wood for for alleged breach of contract.

After this incident, Ol&#x27; Rip went on a national tour, and forty thousand spectators viewed him at the Zoological Gardens in St. Louis, Missouri. Later that same year in New York City, motion pictures were produced with Will Wood introducing Ol&#x27; Rip, and &quot;a bug-catcher was paid each for insects that the frog devoured to please the cameraman&quot;.

The peak of Rip&#x27;s fame occurred in May 1928 when, during his national tour, the lizard was transported to Washington, D.C., where Texas senator Earle Bradford Mayfield presented the specimen to President Calvin Coolidge. A bemused Coolidge purportedly declined to touch the horned toad and merely nudged it with his spectacles. A newspaper article reported the incident:

As a consequence of the creature&#x27;s immense fame, horned toads were sold as souvenirs at the 1928 Democratic National Convention in Houston, Texas, for . The mass capture and export of horned toads for such sales resulted in the genus&#x27; precipitous decline in West Texas. According to Texas journalist Boyce House: &quot;So many [horned toads] were shipped out of West Texas that a Department of Agriculture bulletin foretold damage amounting to thousands of dollars if the [export] shipments did not stop inasmuch as horned frogs preyed on insects that would devour [local] crops.&quot;

=== Death and controversy ===
Soon after his national tour, Ol&#x27; Rip died of pneumonia on January 19, 1929. After Ol&#x27; Rip&#x27;s death, the specimen was kept in a tiny satin-lined casket, provided by the National Casket Company, and displayed in the lobby of the new Eastland courthouse. 

Decades later, in September 1961, Ol&#x27; Rip briefly disappeared from the museum exhibit, and a ransom note demanded for his return. After a city-wide search, the specimen was recovered. A year later, in 1962, John Connally visited the courthouse while running for governor of Texas for a publicity event. An impetuous Connally lifted the embalmed creature by its hind leg which abruptly detached.

In 1972, Rip&#x27;s body was again stolen. Soon after, the City of Eastland claimed they had somehow &quot;found&quot; the stolen specimen and returned the object to exhibition. However, museum visitors noted the &quot;recovered&quot; toad now inexplicably had four feet, while the original specimen only had three feet, presumably due to the earlier 1962 incident with John Connally.

In 1976, an anonymous letter was sent to newspapers claiming the original, three-footed specimen was still in the thief&#x27;s possession, and the City of Eastland had replaced the original specimen with a fake. Angry that &quot;the city of Eastland was building its future around a dried-up horned frog&quot;, the letter-writer offered to pay to anyone who could prove the toad in the courthouse was truly Ol&#x27; Rip.

=== Legacy and influence ===
In 1955, &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; writer Michael Maltese was inspired by the story of Ol&#x27; Rip to write an animated theatrical short entitled &quot;One Froggy Evening&quot;. In the cartoon, a construction worker demolishing a building finds an 1892 time capsule inside a cornerstone. The capsule contains a living frog, retroactively named Michigan J. Frog years later, which is able to sing Tin Pan Alley songs such as &quot;Hello! Ma Baby&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Just Wild About Harry&quot;.

Ol&#x27; Rip&#x27;s story was told in the 2004 documentary short &quot;ToadSpotting: The Legend of Old Rip&quot;.

<text>Guadalupe Peak, also known as Signal Peak, is the highest natural point in Texas, with an elevation of above sea level. It is located in Guadalupe Mountains National Park, and is part of the Guadalupe Mountains range in southeastern New Mexico and West Texas. The mountain is about east of El Paso and about southwest of Carlsbad, New Mexico. The peak rises more than above the arid floor of the Chihuahuan Desert.

==Trail and summit==
The peak can be climbed at any time of the year by a maintained stony trail ( each way) with a elevation gain. The trail is part of the network of hiking trails in the surrounding national park.

A stainless steel pyramid marks the summit. It was erected by American Airlines in 1958 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Butterfield Overland Mail, a stagecoach route that passed south of the mountain. One side of the pyramid has the American Airlines logo. The second side displays a U.S. Postal Service tribute to the Pony Express Riders of the Butterfield Stage. The third side displays a compass with the logo of the Boy Scouts of America.


A hiker was found dead on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2022, as there were wind gusts of more than per hour and wind chills were &quot;well below freezing&quot;.

&quot;At nearly above sea level, Guadalupe Peak is a mountain environment with associated risks not found elsewhere in Texas,&quot; the park said, noting that the hike is a &quot;very strenuous, round trip hike with a elevation gain&quot; to the highest point in the state.

==Climate==
Guadalupe Peak has a subtropical highland climate (Köppen &quot;Cwb&quot;). Interpolated climate data based on surrounding stations is presented below:

<text>The Glasshouse is an international centre for musical education and concerts on the Gateshead bank of Quayside in northern England. Opened in 2004 as Sage Gateshead and occupied by North Music Trust The venue&#x27;s original name honours a patron: the accountancy software company The Sage Group.

== History ==
Planning for the centre began in the early 1990s, when the orchestra of Sage Gateshead, Royal Northern Sinfonia, with encouragement from Northern Arts, began working on plans for a new concert hall. They were soon joined by regional folk music development agency Folkworks, which ensured that the needs of the region&#x27;s traditional music were taken into consideration and represented in Sage Gateshead&#x27;s programme of concerts, alongside Rock, Pop, Dance, Hip Hop, classical, jazz, acoustic, indie, country and world, Practice spaces for professional musicians, students and amateurs were an important part of the provision.

The planning and construction process cost over £70 million, which was raised primarily through National Lottery grants. The contractor was Laing O&#x27;Rourke. The centre has a range of patrons, notably Sage Group which contributed a large sum of money to have the building named after it. Sage plc has helped support the charitable activities of Sage Gateshead since its conception. The venue opened over the weekend 17–19 December 2004.

Sage Gateshead was developed by Foster and Partners following an architectural design competition launched in 1997 and managed by RIBA Competitions. Over 100 architects registered their interest and 12 – a mixture of local, national and international talent – were invited to prepare concept designs. A shortlist of six was then interviewed with Foster and Partners unanimously selected as the winner. The Design has gone on to win a number of awards: the RIBA Inclusive Design Award, Civic Trust Award and The Journal North East Landmark of the Year Award.

As a conference venue, the building hosted the Labour Party&#x27;s Spring conference in February 2005 and the Liberal Democrat Party conference in March 2012. On 18 August 2009, Sage Gateshead was selected to host the 2010 and 2011 National Union of Students annual conference. The 2010 Annual Conference took place 13–15 April 2010. It also hosts accessible learning courses for all ages and its constant interaction with local schools and academies through programmes such as Sing Up and the option of school visits.

In 2022 The Sage Group announced that they were also sponsoring a new development that is being built next to Sage Gateshead which will be called &quot;The Sage&quot;. Sage Gateshead announced that they will be finding a new name for the venue prior to &quot;The Sage&quot; opening in 2024. On 13 September 2023 the venue announced its new name, The Glasshouse International Centre for Music.

== Building ==

The centre occupies a curved glass and stainless steel building designed by Foster and Partners, Buro Happold (structural engineering), Mott MacDonald (engineering consultants) and Arup (acoustics), with views of Newcastle and Gateshead Quaysides, the Tyne Bridge and the Gateshead Millennium Bridge.

The Glasshouse contains three performance spaces; a 1,700-seater, a 450-seater, and a smaller rehearsal and performance hall, the Northern Rock Foundation Hall. The rest of the building was designed around these three spaces to allow for maximum attention to detail in their acoustic properties. Structurally it is three separate buildings, insulated from each other to prevent noise and vibration travelling between them. The gaps between them may be seen as one walks around inside. A special &#x27;spongy&#x27; concrete mix was used in the construction, with a higher-than-usual air capacity to improve the acoustic. These three buildings are enclosed (but not touched) by the now-famous glass and steel shell. Sage One was intended as an acoustically perfect space, modelled on the Musikverein in Vienna. Its ceiling panels may be raised and lowered and curtains drawn across the ribbed wooden side walls, changing the sound profile of the room to suit any type of music. Sage Two is a smaller venue, possibly the world&#x27;s only ten-sided performance space.

The building is open to the public throughout the day.
==Concerts==
The Glasshouse hosts concerts from a wide range of internationally famous artists, and those who have played at the venue include Above and Beyond, Blondie, James Brown, Bonobo, Andy Cutting, De La Soul, Nick Cave, George Clinton, Bill Callahan, Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, Dillinger, Grace Jones, Gretchen Peters, Elbow, Explosions in the Sky, the Fall, Herbie Hancock, Mogwai, Morrissey, Marillion, Mumford &amp; Sons, Pet Shop Boys, Sunn O))), Nancy Sinatra, Snarky Puppy, Sting, Yellowman, Shane Filan of Westlife and others. In February 2015, it was one of the hosts of the second annual BBC Radio 6 Music Festival.

It is also home to Royal Northern Sinfonia, of which &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote there is &quot;no better chamber orchestra in Britain&quot;, and frequently hosts other visiting orchestras from around the world. Until 2020, the music director for Royal Northern Sinfonia was the pianist and conductor Lars Vogt. In late 2014, Royal Northern Sinfonia collaborated with John Grant, performing at Sage Gateshead, and other venues throughout the UK. Recordings from this tour were made available as a limited edition CD and 12&quot; record via Rough Trade Records in 2015.

<text>A cello sonata is piece written sonata form, often with the instrumentation of a cello taking solo role with piano accompaniment. Some of the earliest cello sonatas were composed in the 18th century by Francesco Geminiani and Antonio Vivaldi, and since then other famous cello sonatas have grown to those by Johannes Brahms, Ludwig van Beethoven, Felix Mendelssohn, Fryderyk Chopin, and Richard Strauss among others.

The following list contains cello sonatas with or without accompanying instruments. See the See also list for more comprehensive lists divided up into solo and accompanied works.

<text>A piano sonata is a sonata written for a solo piano. Piano sonatas are usually written in three or four movements, although some piano sonatas have been written with a single movement (Liszt, Scriabin, Medtner, Berg), others with two movements (Haydn, Beethoven), some contain five (Brahms&#x27; Third Piano Sonata, Czerny&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 1, Godowsky&#x27;s Piano Sonata) or even more movements. The first movement is generally composed in sonata form.

== The Baroque keyboard sonata ==
In the Baroque era, the use of the term &quot;sonata&quot; generally referred to either the sonata da chiesa (church sonata) or sonata da camera (chamber sonata), both of which were sonatas for various instruments (usually one or more violins plus basso continuo). The keyboard sonata was relatively neglected by most composers.

The sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti (of which there are over 500) were the hallmark of the Baroque keyboard sonata, though they were, for the most part, unpublished during Scarlatti&#x27;s lifetime. The majority of these sonatas are in one-movement binary form, both sections being in the same tempo and utilizing the same thematic material. These sonatas are prized for both their technical difficulty and their musical and formal ingenuity. The influence of Spanish folk music is evident in Scarlatti&#x27;s sonatas.

Other composers of Baroque keyboard sonatas (which were primarily written in two or three movements) include Marcello, Domenico Alberti, Giustini, Durante and Platti. J.S. Bach&#x27;s popular &quot;Italian Concerto&quot;, despite the name, can also be considered a keyboard sonata.

== Piano sonatas in the Classical era ==
Although various composers in the 17th century had written keyboard pieces which they entitled &quot;Sonata&quot;, it was only in the classical era, when the piano displaced the earlier harpsichord and sonata form rose to prominence as a principle of musical composition, that the term &quot;piano sonata&quot; acquired a definite meaning and a characteristic form.

All the well-known Classical era composers, especially Friedrich Kuhlau, Joseph Haydn, Muzio Clementi, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Ludwig van Beethoven, wrote many piano sonatas. Muzio Clementi wrote more than 110 piano sonatas. He is well known as &quot;The Father of the Pianoforte&quot;. Clementi&#x27;s Opus 2 was the first real piano sonata composed. The much younger Franz Schubert also wrote many. His later sonatas were inspired by the Classical forms of Haydn and Mozart and the expansion of the forms in Beethoven’s sonatas.

The 32 sonatas of Ludwig van Beethoven, including the well-known &quot;Pathétique Sonata&quot;, the &quot;Piano Sonata No. 14&quot;, and the &quot;Piano Sonata No. 23&quot; are often considered the pinnacle of piano sonata composition.

== Piano sonatas in the Romantic era ==
As the Romantic era progressed after Beethoven and Schubert, piano sonatas continued to be composed, but in lesser numbers as the form took on a somewhat academic tinge and competed with shorter genres more compatible with Romantic compositional style. Franz Liszt&#x27;s comprehensive &quot;three-movements-in-one&quot; Sonata in B minor draws on the concept of thematic transformation first introduced by Schubert in his Wanderer Fantasie of 1822. Piano sonatas have been written throughout the 19th and 20th centuries and up to the present day.

<text>About Last Night (stylized as &quot;About Last Night...&quot;) is a 1986 American romantic comedy-drama film directed by Edward Zwick, starring Rob Lowe and Demi Moore as Chicago yuppies Danny Martin and Debbie Sullivan, who enter a committed relationship for the first time. Along with featuring James Belushi as Danny&#x27;s friend and colleague Bernie Litko, the film also marks the screen debuts of Elizabeth Perkins and Catherine Keener. The screenplay by Tim Kazurinsky and Denise DeClue is based on the 1974 David Mamet play &quot;Sexual Perversity in Chicago&quot;. The film was both critically and commercially successful, and was remade with a predominantly Black cast in 2014.

==Plot==
In Chicago, Daniel &quot;Danny&quot; Martin and Bernard &quot;Bernie&quot; Litko, two friends and colleagues in their twenties, discuss their sexual escapades. Later, their recreational softball team, sponsored by local bar Mother&#x27;s, plays against a local advertising agency in Grant Park and wins. Attending this game with her girlfriends is Deborah &quot;Debbie&quot; Sullivan, who works at the advertising company and is having an affair with her boss, Steve Carlson.

Debbie catches Danny&#x27;s eye and they flirt by the beer keg. She and her friends, Joan and Pat, attend the game&#x27;s afterparty at Mother&#x27;s, where Debbie again runs into Danny, with whom Pat flirts and to whom Joan takes an immediate dislike. Danny and Debbie wind up back at his apartment and have sex, after which she hastily leaves.

The next day, Danny calls Debbie at work &quot;about last night&quot;, and asks her out on a second date, which she accepts. Afterwards, they again end up in bed together and spend the following day exploring the city, whereupon Danny reveals to Debbie that his dream is to quit his job at a restaurant supply company and open his own restaurant. They begin dating more seriously and move in together, heavily disappointing Joan and Bernie, who dislike each other as well.

As neither has ever been in a serious relationship before, they attempt to navigate cohabitation without much support from their friends. They experience much throughout their relationship: Danny being contacted by a former lover who is married with children, Debbie&#x27;s boss Steve having difficulty accepting the end of their affair, Joan softening when she begins dating her new boyfriend Gary, a pregnancy scare, and Danny clashing with his boss, who orders him to stop providing supplies to the Swallow, an antiquated diner owned by his client-turned-friend Gus, due to late payments.

Despite having told each other the &quot;L word&quot;, Danny and Debbie&#x27;s relationship becomes strained. It reaches a boiling point at a New Year&#x27;s Eve party at Mother&#x27;s, where Debbie witnesses a drunken Pat making advances towards Danny, and Joan discovers her boyfriend is married and returning to his wife. Joan tearfully asks Debbie to take her home, to which she agrees, despite Danny&#x27;s drunken objections. Upon Debbie&#x27;s return home, Danny expresses his unhappiness and ends their relationship. Debbie immediately moves out of their apartment and back in with Joan.

Danny and Debbie both date other people, but he begins to regret their breakup. Some time later, Danny calls Debbie at work asking for another chance, but she rebuffs him and hangs up on him. When they run into each other at a St. Patrick&#x27;s Day celebration at Mother&#x27;s, Danny tells Debbie he made a mistake and still loves her; she insists she has moved on and their relationship is over.

Hoping to move on with his life, Danny partners with Gus to revitalize the Swallow into an old-school diner, achieving his dream. That summer, at another softball game, Danny and Bernie see Debbie riding her bicycle through the park with Joan, who encourages her to talk to Danny. She approaches him and they both express regret at how their relationship turned out. As Debbie begins to turn away, Danny asks her out again and suggests they go to a great new place, but she suggests with a smile that they just go to &quot;some old joint&quot;, signifying that she is aware of his new restaurant. As she rides away on her bicycle, Bernie convinces Danny to run after her, and the camera pans out to see Danny and Debbie passing through the park.

==Cast==
==Production==
At one point, Bill Murray and Nick Nolte were attached to appear in the film as the lead and supporting role respectively. A &quot;disastrous meeting&quot; between them caused both of them to turn down the film.

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film was a box office success, grossing $38,702,310 domestically. It was the 26th highest-grossing film of 1986 in the United States, and the 10th highest-grossing R-rated film of 1986.

===Critical response===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 65% based on 31 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;&quot;About Last Night&quot; will perturb fans of the original stage play by sanding down its pricklier edges, but an amiable cast and sexual frankness make this a pleasantly grounded romantic comedy.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 70 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;A−&quot; on scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave it 4 out of 4 stars, writing in his review that &quot;&quot;About Last Night . . . &quot; is one of the rarest of recent American movies, because it deals fearlessly with real people, instead of with special effects.&quot; The lead performances were especially praised, with Ebert writing, &quot;Lowe and Moore, members of Hollywood&#x27;s &#x27;Brat Pack,&#x27; are survivors of last summer&#x27;s awful movie about yuppie singles, &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot;. This is the movie &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot; should have been. Last summer&#x27;s movie made them look stupid and shallow. &quot;About Last Night . . . &quot; gives them the best acting opportunities either one has ever had, and they make the most of them.&quot; Sheila Benson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;[t]ender, marvelously well played (by almost everyone) and thoroughly engaging. When it comes to the current sexual skirmishes between men and women, screenwriters Tim Kazurinsky and Denise DeClue [...] know every inch of enemy territory and take no prisoners.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave it a mixed review, calling it &quot;an occasionally bright, knowing look at the same singles scene that&#x27;s been explored no less effectively by a number of other, very similar movies&quot;.

==Soundtrack==
The film&#x27;s soundtrack album was released on EMI America Records. The album includes music by Sheena Easton, Michael Henderson, John Oates, Jermaine Jackson, John Waite, Paul Davis, and Bob Seger.

<text>James Harting Madole (July 7, 1927 – May 6, 1979) was an American neo-Nazi and leader of the National Renaissance Party in the United States. He is now recognized as a pivotal figure in the development of post-war occult-fascism.

==Biography==
In 1945, Madole founded the Animist Party. By 1947, it had dissolved. 

Madole founded the National Renaissance Party in New York City in 1948. The name was inspired by Adolf Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Last Political Testament&quot; before his suicide, which hoped for a &quot;radiant renaissance&quot; for Nazism. 

Madole at the time was &quot;a balding shipping clerk in his mid-forties who lived with his mother, a raving anti-Semite&quot;, according to Martin A. Lee, and Madole &quot;could be seen haranguing some two dozen followers in the Yorkville section of Manhattan, where many German immigrants lived&quot;. The group wore Nazi storm-trooper uniforms and drew hecklers, leading to fistfights. In 1964, Madole and seven other neo-Nazis were convicted of trying to incite a riot at a civil rights demonstration. Each of them, including Madole, were sentenced to one to two years in prison.

Another description of Madole is provided by Peter Levenda: 
&quot;Madole was a relatively congenial human being in polite company. Completely bald, he bore a scar that he claimed was the result of a brick thrown at him by a demonstrator… He possessed a thorough knowledge of the war and was fascinated by stories of the heroism shown by German troops in combat, particularly against the Russian Army. He had a serious junk food habit, downing enormous quantities of ice cream and milk shakes, and grinned (or grimaced?) at inappropriate times…&quot;

==Beliefs==
Madole was influenced by Aryanism and Hinduism. He wrote that the Aryan race was of great antiquity and had been worshipped worldwide by lower races as &quot;White Gods&quot;. Madole also wrote that the Aryans originated in the Garden of Eden located in North America. He also believed that America was the &quot;new Atlantis&quot; and &quot;the cradle of a new God like race&quot;.

A central tenet of Madole&#x27;s ideology was space travel, believing that &quot;the future of Man lies in the stars&quot;. Madole was one of the few to accept Francis P. Yockey&#x27;s argument that Soviet Bolshevism had preserved traditional values more than western liberalism, and that communism was not supported by Judaism. This issue brought him into conflict with his former ally and now rival George Lincoln Rockwell, who used the label &quot;communist&quot; to discredit Madole and his followers.

<doc id="936801" wikidata="Q998303" url="?curid=936801" title="Laser tag">
<text>Laser tag is a recreational shooting sport where participants use infrared-emitting light guns to tag designated targets. Infrared-sensitive signaling devices are commonly worn by each player to register hits and are sometimes integrated within the arena in which the game is played.

Since its birth in 1979, with the release of the Star Trek Electronic Phasers toy manufactured by the South Bend Electronics brand of Milton Bradley, laser tag has evolved into both indoor and outdoor styles of play, and may include simulations of close quarter combat, role play-style adventure games, or competitive sporting events including tactical configurations and precise game goals.

Laser tag is popular with a wide range of ages. Laser tag tournaments are staged for local, regional/state, inter-regional, national, bi-lateral international, and international levels.

==History==
In late 1970s and early 1980s, the United States Army deployed a system using lasers for combat training. This MILES system functioned like laser tag in that beams are &quot;fired&quot; into receivers that score hits.

The first known toy to use infrared light and a corresponding sensor was manufactured and marketed in 1979 as the &quot;Star Trek Electronic Phaser Guns&quot; set to accompany the release of &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;.
In 1982, George Carter III began the process of designing an arena-based system for playing a scored version of the game, a possibility which had initially occurred to him in 1977 while watching the film &quot;Star Wars&quot;. The Grand Opening for the first &quot;&quot; center was in Dallas, Texas on 28 March 1984. Carter was honored by the International Laser Tag Association on 17 November 2005 for his contribution to the laser tag industry. The award is engraved &quot;Presented to George A. Carter III in recognition for being the Inventor and Founder of the laser tag industry&quot;.

In 1986, the first &quot;Photon&quot; toys were sold, nearly simultaneously with the &quot;Lazer Tag&quot; toys from Worlds of Wonder and several other similar infrared and visible light-based toys. &quot;Worlds of Wonder&quot; went out of business around 1988, and &quot;Photon&quot; soon followed in 1989, as the fad of the games wore off. Today there are laser tag arenas all over the world bearing various names and brands, as well as a large variety of consumer equipment for home play and professional grade equipment for outdoor laser tag arenas and businesses.

In March 2009, upon the Winnenden school shooting, the German government announced that it would ban games such as laser tag and paintball, claiming that they trivialize and encourage violence. It later retracted this assertion.

In 2010, a news article appeared claiming that Lee Weinstein developed and opened the first commercial laser tag facility. In June 2011, the ILTA posted the results of a public record request from the City of Houston showing the opening date for Weinstein&#x27;s &quot;Star Laser Force&quot; to have been 16 April 1985.

==Equipment and technology==
Laser tag systems typically use infrared signaling to track firing of the beam. In indoor play, a visible light combined with theatrical fog typically provide the visual effect of firing, while having no actual role in transmitting the fire signal. Despite the name, laser tag equipment does not fire lasers, due to the potential dangers involved. Some laser tag may use additional equipment to simulate control points, respawn boxes, portable med kits, landmines, grenade launchers and hand grenades.

<doc id="936806" wikidata="Q471785" url="?curid=936806" title="Roan antelope">
<text>The roan antelope (Hippotragus equinus) is a large, savanna-dwelling antelope found in Western, Southern, and parts of Central and Eastern Africa. Named for its roan colour (a slightly reddish, sandy-brown), it has a lighter-toned underbelly and a (mostly) white face and snout, but with a black &quot;mask&quot; around the eyes and on the bridge of the snout, being somewhat lighter in females. Additionally, a pair of formidable, recurved horns (made of keratin-covered bone) are present on the heads of both males and females, albeit larger on the males, growing up to 100 cm (39 in) long. Males and females have short, erect, mohawk-like manes running down their back and very light, shaggy neckbeards, both of which are more pronounced in males. Both mane and neckbeard are tinted with darker tips, which run the length of the animal&#x27;s back and belly, ending in a dark-coloured tail. The ears are long, erect, and donkey-like. 

The roan is among the world&#x27;s largest antelopes, after the elands (&quot;Taurotragus&quot; sp.) and the nilgai (&quot;Boselaphus tragocamelus&quot;), measuring from the head to the base of the tail, with a -long tail. Males weigh upwards of and females , with a shoulder height of around .

==Taxonomy and evolution==
The roan antelope shares the genus &quot;Hippotragus&quot; with the extinct bluebuck (&quot;H. leucophaeus&quot;) and the sable antelope (&quot;H. niger&quot;), and is a member of the family Bovidae. It was first described by French naturalist Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1803. The specific epithet &quot;equinus&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;equus&quot; (&quot;horse-like&quot;), referring to the horse-like appearance of this antelope.

In 1996, an analysis of mitochondrial DNA extracted from a mounted specimen of the bluebuck found that it was outside the clade containing the roan and sable antelopes. The study therefore concluded that the bluebuck is a distinct species, and not merely a subspecies of the roan antelope. The cladogram below shows the position of the roan antelope among its relatives, following the 1996 analysis:

In 1974, palaeoanthropologist Richard Klein studied the fossils of &quot;Hippotragus&quot; species in South Africa. Most of these were found to represent the bluebuck and the roan antelope. The roan antelope seems to have appeared in the Nelson Bay Cave region following climatic changes in the Holocene.

===Subspecies===
Six subspecies are recognised:
*&quot;H. e. bakeri&quot; : Occurs in Sudan (East Africa).

==Characteristics==
===Physical description===
The roan antelope is a large antelope with a horse-like build. It is the largest antelope in the genus &quot;Hippotragus&quot;, and one of the largest species of antelopes in the world. Only elands, bongos and large male greater kudus can exceed them in weight on average. The roan antelope stands at the shoulder, and weighs . The head-and-body length is typically between . The dark tail, terminating in a black tuft, measures up to .

Characteristic features include a short, erect mane of grayish brown hair extending from the back of the neck along the midline of the back up to the withers, white patches around the eyes and the mouth on the otherwise black face, and long, narrow ears with long tufts. The horns are ringed and arched backwards, which can reach long in males, slightly shorter in females. The long legs are supported by large hooves. The short, smooth coat is brown to amber. The ventral parts are yellow to white, while the neck and the manes are gray to black.

They are somewhat similar in appearance to the sable antelopes and can be confused where their ranges overlap. Sable antelope males are notably darker, being brownish-black rather than dark brown.
===Habitat and behavior===
Roan antelopes can be found in woodland, grassland, and savannah; mainly in the tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome, which range in tree density from forest with a grassy understory (such as the central Zambezian Miombo woodlands) to grasslands dotted with few trees, where they eat mid-length grasses.

They live in small groups and form harem groups of 5 to 15 animals with one dominant male. Males commonly fight among themselves for dominance of their herd, brandishing their horns while both animals are on their knees.

<doc id="936811" wikidata="Q719083" url="?curid=936811" title="Mark Kozelek">
<text>Mark Edward Kozelek (born January 24, 1967) is an American singer, songwriter, guitarist, record producer and occasional actor. He is the vocalist and primary recording artist of the indie folk act Sun Kil Moon and was a founding member of the indie rock band Red House Painters, with whom he recorded six studio albums from 1988 until 2001.

Upon meeting drummer Anthony Koutsos in Atlanta, Georgia, the pair moved to San Francisco, California and formed Red House Painters alongside guitarist Gorden Mack and bass guitarist Jerry Vessel. Signing with record label 4AD, the band released four studio albums. In 1996, Kozelek recorded the band&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Songs for a Blue Guitar&quot;, mostly alone. The release of the band&#x27;s final studio album, &quot;Old Ramon&quot; (2001), was delayed for three years. In the interim, Kozelek recorded both an album and an EP of AC/DC cover songs.

Reconvening with Koutsos and Vessel, the trio continued performing under the new name of Sun Kil Moon, releasing their debut album, &quot;Ghosts of the Great Highway&quot;, in 2003. Inspired by classical guitar music, Kozelek recorded Sun Kil Moon&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Admiral Fell Promises&quot; (2010), as a solo act and continued to record mostly alone on its follow-up, &quot;Among the Leaves&quot; (2012), and later &quot;Perils from the Sea&quot; and &quot;Mark Kozelek &amp; Desertshore&quot;, both released in 2013. In 2014, Sun Kil Moon&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Benji&quot;, was released to widespread critical acclaim, and increased exposure with its follow-up, 2015&#x27;s &quot;Universal Themes&quot;, featuring lengthy compositions and stream-of-consciousness lyrics.

Across his work in Sun Kil Moon, Red House Painters, and his own solo material, Kozelek has released 31 studio albums, with his most recent being &quot;All the Best, Isaac Hayes&quot; (2020). A number of commentators have described Kozelek as one of the greatest songwriters of his generation.

==Musical career==

=== Early years, Red House Painters, and solo releases ===
Kozelek was born on January 24, 1967 in Massillon, Ohio. In his teenage years, he led a band named God Forbid. Upon relocating to Atlanta, Georgia, he met drummer Anthony Koutsos. After the pair moved once again to San Francisco, California, Red House Painters formed with the addition of guitarist Gorden Mack and bassist Jerry Vessel. From 1992 to 1996, Red House Painters released a series of acclaimed albums, showcasing Kozelek&#x27;s intense, highly autobiographical songs.

However, Kozelek&#x27;s parting with the record label 4AD, followed by a major label merger which left Red House Painters&#x27; 1998 album &quot;Old Ramon&quot; on the shelf, proved highly frustrating and stifled the group&#x27;s momentum.

In 2000, he released the solo EP &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Singer&quot;, which featured three original songs as well as covers of John Denver&#x27;s &quot;Around and Around&quot; and three AC/DC songs (&quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Singer,&quot; &quot;Bad Boy Boogie,&quot; and &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Got a Hold on Me&quot;). Two of the AC/DC cover versions on &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Singer&quot; were radical re-arrangements of the originals which removed the Bon Scott-penned lyrics from their hard rock context and placed them into gentle, acoustic &quot;folk ballad&quot; settings.

Kozelek expanded on this idea in 2001, releasing a full-length album composed solely of AC/DC covers titled &quot;What&#x27;s Next to the Moon&quot;.

=== Sun Kil Moon, solo releases, and guest appearances ===
Sun Kil Moon debuted with &quot;Ghosts of the Great Highway&quot; in 2003, and also features former RHP members Jerry Vessel and Anthony Koutsos as well as new collaborators Geoff Stanfield (formerly of Black Lab) and Tim Mooney of American Music Club. Their follow-up effort appeared in 2005 on Kozelek&#x27;s newly formed label, Caldo Verde Records. Titled &quot;Tiny Cities&quot;, the album is made up entirely of covers of songs by Modest Mouse. Once again, Kozelek&#x27;s cover versions varied greatly from the originals. In a February 2014 interview with Seattle&#x27;s &quot;The Stranger&quot;, Kozelek commented that he&#x27;s &quot;never heard from Modest Mouse&quot; as to what they think of the record.

In 2006, Kozelek was invited by the Toronto indie rock label Paper Bag Records to exclusively contribute to their &quot;See You on the Moon! Songs for Kids of All Ages&quot; compilation with his original song &quot;Leo and Luna&quot;. Then in November 2006, Kozelek released a live album titled &quot;Little Drummer Boy Live&quot;.

Kozelek returned in 2008 with the release of Sun Kil Moon&#x27;s third album &quot;April&quot;. The album features 11 brand new recordings, including guest vocal contributions by Ben Gibbard, Will Oldham and Eric Pollard.

The release of the new album also brought the re-issue of &quot;Nights of Passed Over&quot;, a 256-page, hard-cover book of all the lyrics to Kozelek&#x27;s solo songs, Red House Painters&#x27; songs, and Sun Kil Moon&#x27;s songs. It also features setlists, handwritten lyrics, and a preface by Kozelek himself. The original edition of this book was released in 2002 in Portugal, and featured all the lyrics up to that point, printed in both English and Portuguese. The updated edition spans to his current Sun Kil Moon days, and the book also includes a 12-track bonus CD titled &quot;Nights LP&quot;, featuring live and rare versions of songs dated 1996 to 2007. The edition is sold exclusively on his label&#x27;s website and is limited to 2,500 copies.

On December 9, 2008, Kozelek and Caldo Verde Records issued &quot;The Finally LP&quot;, a CD collection of 10 unreleased tracks, including covers of songs by Stephen Sondheim, Will Oldham, Hüsker Dü, and Low among others, as well as two previously unreleased instrumentals. Two newly recorded live albums, &quot;Find Me, Ruben Olivares: Live in Spain&quot; and &quot;Lost Verses Live&quot;, followed in spring 2009.

On April 23, 2010, the release of Sun Kil Moon&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Admiral Fell Promises&quot;, was announced. The album was released on July 13, 2010.

A documentary film titled &quot;Mark Kozelek: On Tour&quot; was released via Caldo Verde Records on August 16, 2011. The movie was filmed during portions Mark Kozelek&#x27;s European/North American tours of 2010 and early 2011.

Sun Kil Moon&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Among the Leaves&quot;, was released on Caldo Verde Records on May 29, 2012.

Kozelek also contributed as a vocalist and bass player to Desertshore, a group featuring Red House Painters guitarist Phil Carney, classically trained pianist Chris Connolly, and more recently Sun Kil Moon drummer Mike Stevens. His first collaboration with Desertshore came on the group&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Drawing Of Threes&quot; (released November 22, 2011, Caldo Verde Records). Kozelek appeared in 6 out of 10 tracks as a vocalist and bass player. He played a more major role in the third studio album titled &quot;Mark Kozelek &amp; Desertshore&quot; (released August 20, 2013, Caldo Verde Records), where he is featured as vocalist and bassist on all 10 tracks. In the same year, Kozelek released &quot;Perils From the Sea&quot;, a collaboration album with multi-instrumentalist Jimmy LaValle of The Album Leaf, and covers album &quot;Like Rats&quot;.

In 2014, Sun Kil Moon released &quot;Benji&quot; to wide acclaim, garnering a score of 85 from the critical rating aggregate website, Metacritic. &quot;No Ripcord&quot; calls it Kozelek&#x27;s &quot;most intimate work yet&quot; and Kitty Empire of &quot;Observer&quot; added, it &quot;might well be this difficult artist&#x27;s most direct work.&quot; Soundblab rated it the best album of 2014, stating &quot;When I remember 2014 in music, there will be Sun Kil Moon&#x27;s &quot;Benji&quot; and there will be everything else.&quot; Several publications praised Kozelek&#x27;s songwriting skills and highlighted &quot;Benji&quot; as his best work to date.

On September 5, 2014, during a Sun Kil Moon performance at Hopscotch Music Festival in Raleigh, North Carolina, Kozelek called the noisy crowd &quot;fucking hillbillies&quot; and told them to &quot;shut the fuck up&quot; or else he would leave. He traded insults with the crowd before saying that his previous comments were meant as a joke. Allison Hussey of &quot;Indy Week&quot; first reported the incident, and linked to audio of Kozelek berating the audience. On September 9, 2014, Kozelek&#x27;s label Caldo Verde began selling t-shirts with &quot;All You Fuckin&#x27; Hillbillies Shut The Fuck Up&quot; printed on the front. 

On September 14, 2014, Sun Kil Moon performed at the Ottawa Folk Festival in Ottawa, Canada, and their set overlapped with that of American rock band The War on Drugs. Kozelek complained of noise from The War on Drugs&#x27; set bleeding over to his stage and told the audience, &quot;I hate that beer commercial lead-guitar shit&quot;. He introduced his next song as being titled &quot;The War on Drugs Can Suck My Fucking Dick&quot;. On October 6, 2014, Sun Kil Moon released a song about the incident, &quot;War on Drugs: Suck My Cock&quot;. The War on Drugs&#x27; lead singer Adam Granduciel responded by calling Kozelek a &quot;douche&quot;, and Kozelek released a second song about the feud titled &quot;Adam Granofsky Blues&quot;.

Sun Kil Moon&#x27;s sixth album of original material, &quot;Universal Themes&quot;, was released on June 2, 2015. The album again featured drummer Steve Shelley, who previously played drums on &quot;Benji&quot; and then released an album in 2017 &quot;Common as Light and Love Are Red Valleys of Blood&quot;. Kozelek toured Europe, the United States, and South America in support of the album in 2017 and 2018. On May 11, 2018, Kozelek released an eponymously titled double CD album, which &quot;was recorded in San Francisco hotels and studios between May 2017 and January 2018.&quot;

In 2016, Kozelek released a collaborative studio album with Jesu, titled &quot;Jesu/Sun Kil Moon&quot;.

In August 2022, he announced two concerts in Hungary and Slovenia after an almost two-year absence from live performance.

==Acting==
Kozelek has also dabbled in acting. Friend and director Cameron Crowe cast him in his film &quot;Almost Famous&quot; (2000) as Larry Fellows (the bass player in Stillwater) and in &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; (2001) as a clubgoer who mocks Tom Cruise&#x27;s character. In 2005, he appeared in Steve Martin&#x27;s film &quot;Shopgirl&quot;, playing a musician who befriends and mentors Jason Schwartzman&#x27;s character. Kozelek also performed &quot;Lily and Parrots&quot; (a Sun Kil Moon song) live in the film.

Kozelek appears as himself, and contributed to the soundtrack to Paolo Sorrentino&#x27;s 2015 film, &quot;Youth&quot;.

In August 2020, in an article published by &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Kozelek was alleged to have engaged in sexual misconduct with a woman named Sarah Golden, as well as two other unidentified women. On August 17, Kozelek denied the allegations against him and stated that he has retained a law firm to &quot;investigate and pursue as necessary any claims against anyone participating to defame me&quot;.

On March 25, 2021, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; published another article on seven more women who accused Kozelek of sexual misconduct. Several of these women alleged that, in separate incidents, Kozelek brought them back to a hotel room, promising them that the encounter would not be sexual, before later emerging from the bathroom unclothed or in underwear and then masturbating. He then allegedly groped some of these women despite repeated requests to stop, then repeatedly pressured them to have sexual intercourse with him until they either left or had sex with him. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; reported that Kozelek denied the allegations in a letter issued to them by his attorney.

<doc id="936816" wikidata="Q835454" url="?curid=936816" title="Guantanamera">
<text>&quot;&quot; (; ) is a Cuban patriotic song, which uses a poem from the collection &quot;Simple Verses&quot;, by the Cuban poet José Martí, for the lyrics. It is an expression of love for Cuba and of solidarity with the poor people of the world.

The official writing credits have been given to Joseíto Fernández, who first popularized the song on radio as early as 1929 (although it is unclear when the first release as a record occurred). In 1966, a version by American vocal group the Sandpipers, based on an arrangement by the Weavers from their May 1963 Carnegie Hall Reunion concert, became an international hit. The song has notably been covered or interpreted by Celia Cruz, Compay Segundo and Wyclef Jean.

==Music==
The music for the song is sometimes also attributed to Joseíto Fernández, who claimed to have written it at various dates (consensus puts 1929 as its year of origin), and who used it regularly in one of his radio programs. Some claim that the song&#x27;s structure actually came from Herminio &quot;El Diablo&quot; García Wilson, who could be credited as a co-composer. García&#x27;s heirs took the matter to court decades later, but lost the case; the People&#x27;s Supreme Court of Cuba credited Fernández as the sole composer of the music in 1993. Regardless of either claim, Fernández can safely be claimed as being the first to promote the song widely through his radio programs.

==Pete Seeger version==
Shortly after the Weavers&#x27; Carnegie Hall reunion concert recording in May 1963, Pete Seeger included the song on his album &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot;, which was also performed live at Carnegie Hall. Seeger&#x27;s recording is described by Stewart Mason at AllMusic as the &quot;definitive version&quot; of the song.

The version of the song created by Martí and Orbón was used by Seeger as the basis of his reworked version, which he based on a performance of the song by Héctor Angulo. Seeger combined Martí&#x27;s verse with the tune, with the intention that it be used by the peace movement at the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis. He urged that people sing the song as a symbol of unity between the American and Cuban peoples, and called for it to be sung in Spanish to &quot;hasten the day [that] the USA ... is some sort of bilingual country.&quot;

==The Sandpipers version==

The most commercially successful version of &quot;Guantanamera&quot; in the English-speaking world was recorded by the easy listening vocal group the Sandpipers in 1966. Their recording was based on the Weavers&#x27; 1963 Carnegie Hall reunion concert rendition and was arranged by Mort Garson and produced by Tommy LiPuma. In addition to the group&#x27;s vocals, the version includes Robie Lester on background vocals and narration by producer LiPuma. It reached No. 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 7 on the UK Singles Chart.

=== Charts ===
== Celia Cruz version ==
&quot;Guantanamera&quot; is one of the songs most commonly identified with Cuban singer Celia Cruz (1925–2003). It appears on at least 241 different records or compilations of hers, her earliest commercial recording of it being on the Mexican label Tico Records in 1968. She mentions her special memories of singing &quot;Guantanamera&quot; nine times in her posthumous 2004 autobiography.

=== Charts ===
== Wyclef Jean version ==

Wyclef Jean&#x27;s version of the song is not a cover of the original, but an incorporation with additional lyrics/music. The album version of the song featured singing by Jeni Fujita alongside Celia Cruz (who re-recorded her vocals for the song), with an additional rap verse by Lauryn Hill. 

The song was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. The song peaked at number 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Rhythmic Airplay chart, and peaked within the top 40 in several countries, including the United Kingdom. Former United States President Barack Obama listed the song on his 2022 summer playlist.
