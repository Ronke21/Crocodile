<text>Klarälven (&quot;The clear river&quot; in Swedish) is a river flowing through Norway and Sweden. Together with Göta älv, which it is called as the river has passed through the lake Vänern, thus regarded as an entity, Göta älv—Klarälven is the longest river in Scandinavia and in the Nordic countries and its Swedish part the longest river of Sweden. These two rivers also have the largest drainage basin in the same areas, including all the rivers that run into Vänern, of which is located in Sweden and in Norway.
It emanates at the northeast side of Mount Brändstöten and flows through a couple of smaller lakes down to Lake Rogen in Härjedalen, Sweden, and then passes through the Norwegian Hedmark, where it flows through the lake Femunden. There it is known as Femundelva and Trysilelva. The rest of the river, the longest part, flows through Värmland to ultimately discharge in a delta into Vänern at Karlstad.

In its turn, Vänern drains then into Göta älv, reaching the sea at Gothenburg.

The river has historically provided significant economic benefits, providing a suitable transport route for log driving, and currently is internationally recognized as excellent sport fishing waters.

==Geography and geology==

The watershed of Klarälven is commonly referred to as Klarälvdalen (&quot;the Klarälv basin&quot;), where it accumulates much of its water on its journey to Vänern. Other important sources of water are the snowy mountains in the northern areas of the watershed area, providing substantial flows in the spring when the snow melts; annual floods are common.

The straight river course north of Edebäck has been classified by Sten De Geer as a &quot;tectonic valley&quot; as it follows the Protogine Zone—a bedrock weakness zone of Precambrian age. During deglaciation of Scandinavia about 10,000 years before present the glacier ice retreated unevenly with the valley of Klarälven hosting a protruding ice tongue while the surrounding uplands were ice-free. The retreat of the ice left dead ice buried in the glacifluvial sediments of the valley. The river course north of Edebäck formed an ancient fjord after it became free of glacier ice and before the post-glacial rebound definitely raised the valley bottom above the sea. The river course south of Edebäck is possibly a Quaternary deflection caused by the accumulation of glacial deposits.

Since the end of the last ice age, the mouth of Klarälven has moved southward from Forshaga to its current position at Karlstad, and is still moving, albeit for different reasons, as the river carries substantial quantities of sand, cut from the outer edges of its meandering curves, causing the shoreline of Vänern to constantly move southward.

The heavy meandering of Klarälven results in numerous oxbow lakes, formed as a result of a too sharp curve, eventually causing the river to create a new, shorter path. An artificial islet, &quot;Gubbholmen&quot; found in central Karlstad has also been created as a result of the accumulation of of sand transported each day during the spring flood.

Entering the Karlstad region, the river delta splits into two main parts and eight smaller parts. The east part splits into two further main branches after passing Gubbholmen (eventually three branches). The west part splits into five branches.

In the first half of the 20th century the geography and Quaternary geology Klarälven was studied by various Swedish researchers including Alfred Elis Törnebohm, Sten De Geer and Lennart von Post. This last Quaternary geologist died in 1951 leaving his research unfinished, despite this Klarälven was by 1956 the most studied river in Sweden. Åke Sundborg&#x27;s 1956 outstanding PhD thesis and publication on the geomorphology and hydrology of Klarälven is considered a major reference work for river studies in Sweden.

==Economic importance ==
There are some hydroelectric power plants in the river. These are the hydroelectric power plants from south to north.

# Dejefors power plant in Deje, 20 MW
# Munkfors power plant in Munkfors, 33 MW,
# Skymnäsforsen power plant in Skymnäsfors, 17 MW,
# Forshult power plant in Forshult, 20 MW,
# Krakerud power plant in Krakerud, 22 MW,
# Skogaforsen power plant in Skogafors 15 MW,
# Edsforsen power plant in Edsfors 9 MW 
# Höljes power plant in Höljes, 130 MW.

===Fishing===
In recent years, the sport fishing of Klarälven has gained an international recognition for its Atlantic salmon and brown trout fisheries; these two species of fish are sought after by fly fishers. Competition for use of areas rich in the popular species is vigorous, and at high season the price of fishing licenses may be as high as 500 Swedish krona (US$68) per day. Other measures are taken to ensure the survival of the fishery, including strict rules on the minimum sizes and quantities of fish allowed to be taken, as well as the requirement that unwanted fish, such as the northern pike, be killed when caught.

Although the river was a busy log driving route, it has been reported that the fish populations of Klarälven has not suffered from the heavy activity, underwater life benefited from it, especially the grayling population. When the log driving stopped in 1991, it was later reported that the beneficial effects were slowly disappearing as shore vegetation grew denser, providing a less favourable environment for the fish.

As of 1997, an upper secondary school specializing in sport fishing education was established to meet the demands for skilled professionals to guide fishing tourism.

=== Other tourism ===
Klarälven has clean and fresh water, suitable for bathing, although caution must be taken if bathing at a point before the river reaches its delta, as the currents can be treacherous.

Modern day tourist attractions in addition to sport fishing include canoeing, as well as rafting from Branäs to Edebäck.

=== Log driving ===
Log driving has been traced back to the 17th century, although log driving increased to a significant level at the beginning of the 20th century, when the paper industry started to expand. Log driving was accomplished by dumping the harvested logs into the river, there they floated until the separation point at Forshaga. They were then held up by a floating structure resembling a fence until loggers could move out on the logs, identify them and guide them to their designated areas using special hooks. After grouping logs with the same company marks together, the logs would then be towed to their destinations.

As many as 1,500 people were working seasonally, employed by the local log drivers&#x27; society, paid by the paper mills and forest owners. Although a risky job, the personnel were skilled and only one drowning incident was reported in the last 30 years of operation. Out of the 19 &quot;Lusten&quot; boats used to tow the logs to their final destinations, only one remains in working condition today; &quot;Lusten 8&quot;, serving as a tourist attraction.

After the shutdown of the log driving industry in 1991, the remaining equipment was auctioned off, most was sold to the Forshaga Municipality, who used the equipment to found the log driving museum, using the old buildings used for the operations as its main building. Upon the shutdown of the flood driving in Klarälven, the practice of log driving in Sweden had officially come to its end.

<text>Saturniidae, members of which are commonly named the saturniids, is a family of Lepidoptera with an estimated 2,300 described species. The family contains some of the largest species of moths in the world. Notable members include the emperor moths, royal moths, and giant silk moths (or wild silk moths).

Adults are characterized by large, lobed wings, heavy bodies covered in hair-like scales, and reduced mouthparts. They lack a frenulum, but the hindwings overlap the forewings to produce the effect of an unbroken wing surface. Saturniids are sometimes brightly colored and often have translucent eyespots or &quot;windows&quot; on their wings. Sexual dimorphism varies by species, but males can generally be distinguished by their larger, broader antennae.

Most adults have wingspans between , but some tropical species such as the Atlas moth (&quot;Attacus atlas&quot;) may have wingspans up to . Together with certain Noctuidae, Saturniidae contains the largest Lepidoptera and some of the largest extant insects.

== Distribution ==

The majority of saturniid species occur in wooded tropical or subtropical regions, with the greatest diversity in the New World tropics and Mexico, though they are found all over the world. About 12 described species live in Europe, one of which, the emperor moth, occurs in the British Isles, and 68 described species live in North America, 42 of which reside north of Mexico and Southern California.

== Life cycle ==

Some saturniids are strictly univoltine, producing only one generation a year, whereas others are multivoltine, producing more than one brood a year. Spring and summer broods eclose in a matter of weeks; autumn broods enter a state known as diapause and emerge the following spring. How the pupae know when to eclose early or hibernate is not yet fully understood, though research suggests day length during the fifth larval instar plays a major role, as well as cooling temperatures. Longer days may prompt pupae to develop early, while shorter days result in pupal diapause. The number of broods is flexible, and a single female may produce both fast-developing and slow-developing individuals, or they may produce different numbers of broods in different years or parts of the range. In some species, the spring and summer broods look different from each other; for example, the two Saturniinae species &quot;Actias luna&quot; (the luna moth) and &quot;Callosamia securifera&quot; both have certain genes which may or may not be activated depending upon differences in environmental conditions.

=== Eggs ===

Depending on the moth, a single female may lay up to 200 eggs on a chosen host plant. Others are laid singly or in small groups. They are round, slightly flattened, smooth, and translucent or whitish.

=== Larvae ===

Saturniid caterpillars are large (50 to 100 mm in the final instar), stout, and cylindrical. Most have tubercules that are often also spiny or hairy. Many are cryptic in coloration, with countershading or disruptive coloration to reduce detection, but some are more colorful. Some have urticating hairs. A few species have been noted to produce clicking sounds with the larval mandibles when disturbed. Examples: luna moth (&quot;Actias luna&quot;) and Polyphemus moth (&quot;Antheraea polyphemus&quot;). The clicks may serve as aposematic warning signals to a regurgitation defense.

Most are solitary feeders, but some are gregarious. The Hemileucinae are gregarious when young and have stinging hairs, and those of &quot;Lonomia&quot; contain a poison that may kill a human. &quot;Arsenura armida&quot; is another well-known example and is infamous for its large conspicuous masses during the day. Their coloration is not cryptic, instead exhibiting aposematism.

The other caterpillars in this size range are almost universally Sphingidae, which are seldom hairy and tend to have diagonal stripes on their sides. Many Sphingidae caterpillars bear a single curved horn on their hind end. These are actually not dangerous, but large, hairy caterpillars should generally not be touched except by experts.

Most saturniid larvae feed on the foliage of trees and shrubs. A few, particularly Hemileucinae such as &quot;Automeris louisiana&quot;, &quot;A. patagonensis&quot;, and &quot;Hemileuca oliviae&quot;, feed on grasses. They moult at regular intervals, usually four to six times before entering the pupal stage. Prior to pupation, a wandering stage occurs, and the caterpillar may change color, becoming more cryptic just before this stage.

=== Pupae ===
Most larvae spin a silken cocoon in the leaves of a preferred host plant or in leaf litter on the ground, or crevices in rocks and logs. While only moderately close relatives to the silkworm (&quot;Bombyx mori&quot;) among the Lepidoptera, the cocoons of larger saturniids can be gathered and used to make silk fabric. However, larvae of some species – typically Ceratocampinae, like the regal moth (&quot;Citheronia regalis&quot;) and the imperial moth (&quot;Eacles imperialis&quot;), burrow and pupate in a small chamber beneath the soil. This is common in the Ceratocampinae and Hemileucinae. Unlike most silk moths, those that pupate underground do not use much silk in the construction. Once enclosed in the cocoon, the caterpillar sheds the larval skin and becomes a pupa, and the pupa undergoes metamorphosis for about 14 days, at which point it either emerges or goes into diapause. During metamorphosis, the respiratory system will stay intact, the digestive system will dissolve, and reproductive organs will take form.

=== Adults ===
Adult females emerge with a complete set of mature ova and &quot;call&quot; males by emitting pheromones (specific &quot;calling&quot; times vary by species). Males can detect these chemical signals up to a mile away with help from sensitive receptors located on the tips of their feather-like antennae. The males fly several miles in one night to locate a female and mate with her; females generally will not fly until after they have mated.

Since the mouthparts of adult saturniids are vestigial and digestive tracts are absent, adults subsist on stored lipids acquired during the larval stage. As such, adult behavior is devoted almost entirely to reproduction, but the end result (due to lack of feeding) is a lifespan of a week or less once emerged from the pupa.

One specific species in the family Saturniidae with a special mating pattern is &quot;Callosamia promethea&quot; (promethea silkmoth). Females will mate with multiple males and males will mate with multiple females (polygynandry). Females that mate with more than one male will produce 10% more eggs.

== Importance to humans ==

A few species are important defoliator pests, including the orange-striped oakworm moth (&quot;Anisota senatoria&quot;) on oaks, the pandora pinemoth (&quot;Coloradia pandora&quot;) on pines and &quot;Hemileuca oliviae&quot; on range grasses.

Other species are of major commercial importance in tussah and wild silk production. These notably include the Chinese tussah moth (&quot;Antheraea pernyi&quot;), its hybridogenic descendant &quot;Antheraea&quot; × &quot;proylei&quot;, and the ailanthus silkmoth (&quot;Samia cynthia&quot;). Mopane worm (&quot;Gonimbrasia belina&quot;), &quot;Gonimbrasia zambesina&quot;, the cabbage tree emperor moth (&quot;Bunaea alcinoe&quot;), &quot;Gynanisa maia&quot;, &quot;Imbrasia epimethea&quot;, &quot;Imbrasia oyemensis&quot;, &quot;Melanocera menippe&quot;, &quot;Microgone cana&quot;, &quot;Urota sinope&quot; and the pallid emperor moth (&quot;Cirina forda&quot;).

Some species of Saturniidae such as the mopane worm (&quot;Gonimbrasia belina&quot;) are used as a food source.

Most Saturniidae are harmless animals at least as adults, and in many cases at all stages of their lives. Thus, some of the more spectacular species – in particular &quot;Antheraea&quot; – can be raised by children or school classes as educational pets. The soft, silken cocoons make an interesting keepsake for pupils.

Some, including the genus &quot;Automeris&quot;, have urticating spines that sting.

Caterpillars of the genus &quot;Lonomia&quot; produce a deadly toxin injected into the victim when it is touched.

== Systematics and evolution ==
In terms of absolute numbers of species, the Saturniidae are most diverse in the Neotropics. Also, their most ancient subfamilies occur only in the Americas. Only the very &quot;modern&quot; Saturniidae are widely distributed across most parts of the world. Thus, it is quite safe to assume – even in the absence of a comprehensive fossil record – that the first Saturniidae originated in the Neotropical region. Note that at least two of the subfamilies included below are commonly treated as separate families (Oxyteninae and Cercophaninae).

The following list arranges the subfamilies in the presumed phylogenetic sequence, from the most ancient to the most advanced.
* Subfamily Oxyteninae (3 genera, 35 species)
* Subfamily Cercophaninae (4 genera, 10 species)
* Subfamily Arsenurinae (10 genera, 60 species, Neotropics)
* Subfamily Ceratocampinae (27 genera, 170 species, Americas)
* Subfamily Hemileucinae (51 genera, 630 species, Americas)
* Subfamily Agliinae (1 genus, 3 species)
* Subfamily Ludiinae (8 genera, Africa)
* Subfamily Salassinae (1 genus, 12 species, tropics)
* Subfamily Saturniinae (59 genera, 480 species, tropical and temperate regions worldwide)

<text>U.S. Route 199 (US 199) is a U.S. Highway in the states of California and Oregon. The highway was established in 1926 as a spur of US 99, which has since been replaced by Interstate 5 (I-5). US 199 stretches from US 101 near Crescent City, California northeast to I-5 in Grants Pass, Oregon. The highway is the northern portion of the Redwood Highway. In Oregon, US 199 is officially known as Redwood Highway No. 25. The majority of the road in California is the Smith River Scenic Byway, a National Forest Scenic Byway. The first roadway, a plank road, from Crescent City was established in May 1858, and before the US 199 designation was applied to the highway, the roadway was designated Highway 25 (in Oregon) and Route 1 (in California).

==Route description==
US 199 begins at a partial interchange with US 101 northeast of Crescent City; Elk Valley Cross Road (County Route D2) connects the two routes just to the north for full access. The highway quickly enters the Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park, climbs over a ridge, crosses the Smith River, and meets State Route 197 (SR 197), which heads northwest to US 101 via the Smith River. US 199 follows the banks of the river and its Middle Fork as it takes a steady but curvy climb through the Smith River National Recreation Area in the Six Rivers National Forest, passing the settlements of Hiouchi, Gasquet and Patrick Creek Lodge. As it approaches the summit, the Middle Fork Smith River turns east, but US 199 continues northeast, following Griffin Creek to near its source (where there is a rest area), and passing under Hazel View Summit, the border between the Smith River NRA and the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest, in the 1963 Collier Tunnel (elevation about ). (The old curving route over the summit still exists as Oregon Mountain Road.) Upon leaving the tunnel, US 199 descends alongside the small Broken Kettle Creek into the Elk Valley and crosses into Oregon.
US 199 leaves the national forest as it enters Oregon and descends into the Illinois Valley, passing O&#x27;Brien and the west end of OR 46 in Cave Junction. North of Cave Junction, US 199 leaves the Illinois River, which curves west towards the ocean, and follows several small creeks past Selma to Hayes Hill Summit (elevation about ). The highway descends from the summit alongside Slate Creek past Wonder and Wilderville and ends up in the Rogue River Valley, where it enters Grants Pass.

South of downtown Grants Pass, US 199 meets Oregon Route 99 (OR 99) and OR 238 and splits at a partial interchange. The main Redwood Highway turns north with OR 99, passing through downtown and ending at exit 58 on I-5, while the Redwood Spur No. 482, locally known as Grants Pass Parkway, continues straight, bypassing downtown to end at I-5 exit 55. Both of these are signed in both directions as US 199, while signage on US 199 itself at the split only shows &quot;OR 99 north&quot; for the mainline through downtown and &quot;to I-5&quot; for the bypass. On I-5, exit 55 is marked as &quot;US 199&quot;, but exit 58 is &quot;OR 99 &quot;to&quot; US 199&quot;. The Oregon Transportation Commission&#x27;s defined routing of US 199 takes it along the main Redwood Highway through downtown, and the OTC calls the spur to exit 55 &quot;US 199 Spur&quot;, but, consistent with signs on I-5 (but not on the surface), the Oregon Department of Transportation calls the spur US 199 and the downtown route OR 99 only.

The older route through downtown is a one-way pair on Sixth (southbound) and Seventh (northbound) streets, entirely overlapping OR 99 to I-5 exit 58, where OR 99 continues with I-5 to the north. The Caveman Bridge, a concrete through arch bridge built in 1927, carries Sixth Street over the Rogue River, while the parallel Seventh Street Bridge is a utilitarian bridge from 1960. The Grants Pass Parkway (Redwood Spur) also crosses the river on a four-lane bridge built in 1990; before that bypass was completed, the spur began downtown on E (southbound) and F (northbound) streets. Soon after the old and new routes join, the spur ends at a trumpet interchange with I-5 (exit 55).

US 199 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. US 199 is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation.
==History==
By 1854, when it was incorporated, Crescent City had a population of 800 but no road leading inland. The Crescent City and Yreka Plank and Turnpike Company was incorporated at a meeting on June 10, and a survey was completed in October, but work stopped with the Panic of 1855. The corporation was revived in December 1856 as the Crescent City Plank Road and Turnpike Company, began construction of a plank road in 1857, and opened the road in May 1858. This road, shown on USGS topographic maps as Wimer Road, led northeast from Crescent City to the Smith River, where there was a toll booth, and then took a generally northerly route to near the state line, where it turned east, crossing back and forth between the states, to Oregon Mountain. There it turned northeast, following the Illinois River and branches past O&#x27;Brien and Waldo to north of Kerby. The final stretch ran easterly to Jacksonville via Wilderville, along the present US 199, Fish Hatchery Road, and OR 238.
A second road in California was built by Horace Gasquet, who acquired a stand of trees at the present site of Gasquet, California — where the North and Middle Forks of the Smith River converge — in 1857. In 1881, he began to build a corduroy road from what had become Gasquet Flats to the plank road at the state line near Oregon Mountain, shown as Old Gasquet Toll Road on USGS maps. Tolls were charged starting in 1882, and in 1887 the road was completed. Gasquet also built a free road from Gasquet Flats along the Smith River to the mouth of the South Fork, including a suspension bridge across that waterway, and Del Norte County extended it along the Smith River and Mill Creek and over Howland Summit to the Crescent City Plank Road just east of Crescent City.
As part of Oregon&#x27;s initial state highway system, the road from Grants Pass southwest to Wilderville and then along the Crescent City Plank Road to the state line was named the Grants Pass-Crescent City Highway No. 25 in November 1917. At the time, the Grants Pass-Crescent City route, via the Gasquet Toll Road, was a narrow, winding unpaved mountain road with long grades and some remaining plank road in California. California added its portion to the state highway system in 1919, for the state&#x27;s third highway bond issue, as an extension of Legislative Route 1. By 1924, the road was part of the Redwood Highway, which continued south to Sausalito, but was still completely unimproved between Crescent City and Waldo, Oregon. (Oregon changed the Grants Pass-Crescent City Highway name to Redwood Highway in May 1924.) A new highway between Gasquet and Kerby was completed by the two states in September 1926, and in June 1929 the new Hiouchi Bridge over the Smith River was dedicated, bypassing the remainder of the old road over Howland Hill. In 1948, US 199 became part of the Winnemucca to the Sea Highway, organized to promote the route that has largely become Nevada State Route 140 and Oregon Route 140 from I-80 at Winnemucca, Nevada to Crescent City. One major improvement to the highway&#x27;s alignment was made after 1929: the Collier Tunnel replaced the winding route over Hazel View Summit in California on July 20, 1963.

Neither of the early designations — Highway 25 and Route 1 – was marked (signs posted by the California State Automobile Association used the Redwood Highway name), but in 1926 it became U.S. Route 199, a branch of US 99 from Grants Pass to US 101 in Crescent City. Oregon moved the Pacific Highway No. 1 from present OR 99 to I-5, which bypassed Grants Pass, in 1959, and the Redwood Highway No. 25 was extended north through downtown Grants Pass to I-5. A proposed branch on M Street to I-5 east of downtown was also included in Highway 25, but this was moved to the E and F Streets one-way pair in 1961. (I-5 here was built in the early 1960s, but US 99 remained on the old alignment.) On the California side of the state line, US 199 was added to the California Freeway and Expressway System in 1959 and the State Scenic Highway System in 1963; in the 1964 renumbering the Route 1 designation was dropped, making Route 199 the legislative number. Although US 299 and US 399 became state routes in 1964, the shorter US 199, which crossed a state line, remained. US 99 has since become Oregon Route 99 through Grants Pass, and US 199 now ends at I-5. The spur east from downtown Grants Pass to I-5 was built at the same time as I-5, and in 1991 it was moved from E and F Streets to bypass downtown on the new Grants Pass Parkway.

<text>Ageratum () (whiteweed in the US) is a genus of 40 to 60 tropical and warm temperate flowering annuals and perennials from the family Asteraceae, tribe Eupatorieae. Most species are native to Central America and Mexico but four are native to the United States.

They form tussocks or small hills. They grow to a height of . The opposite leaves are cordate or oval, hairy or tomentose. The margins are slightly toothed or serrate. The leaves form compact clusters.

The fluffy flowers are lavender-blue, pink, lilac, or white, and spread in small compound umbels. They give small, dry fruits.

== Cultivation ==
Ageratums are grown for their flowers, especially &quot;A. houstonianum&quot;.

Most common ageratums, &quot;Hawaii&quot; for example, are a short when full grown. Tall ageratum are also available in seed catalogues. They are about in height with blue flowers. There is also a medium-height snowcapped variety, white top on blue flowers. The blues are most popular and common, but colors also include violet, pink and white. Their size and color makes ageratums good candidates for rock gardens, bedding, and containers. They grow well in sun or partial shade, from early summer to first frost. They are quite easy to grow, producing a profusion of fluffy flowers all season long.

== Toxicity ==
Several species of &quot;Ageratum&quot; are toxic, containing pyrrolizidine alkaloids. &quot;Ageratum houstonianum&quot; and &quot;Ageratum conyzoides&quot; cause liver lesions and are tumorigenic.

== Weed risk ==
&quot;Ageratum conyzoides&quot; and &quot;Ageratum houstonianum&quot; are prone to becoming rampant environmental weeds when grown outside of their natural range.

== Species ==
, &quot;Plants of the World online&quot; has 40 accepted species:

<doc id="904722" wikidata="Q1004929" url="?curid=904722" title="Bunad">
<text>Bunad (, plural: &quot;bunader&quot;/&quot;bunadar&quot;) is a Norwegian umbrella term. In a broader sense, the term encompasses household, householding equipment, and livestock as well as both traditional rural clothes (mostly dating to the 18th and 19th centuries) and modern 20th-century folk costumes. In its narrowest sense, the word &quot;bunad&quot; refers only to clothes designed in the early 20th century that are loosely based on traditional costumes.

The bunad movement has its root in 19th-century national romanticism, which included an interest for traditional folk costumes not only in Norway, but also in neighbouring countries such as Denmark and notably Germany. However, in Norway, national romanticist ideas had a more lasting impact, as seen in the use of folk-inspired costumes.

== History ==

The bunad movement has been carried forward by enthusiasts all over the country and new bunad variations are frequently created and proposed for approval. Designers such as Lise Skjåk Bræk have developed entire lines of costumes based on the bunad tradition. In the field of folk costumes it is common to differentiate between &quot;bunad&quot; and &quot;folk costume&quot;, the latter being the local dress in previous times with all its variations and use. Modern interpretations of these costumes have often modified or done away with completely parts of the traditional dresses in order to align them with a more conventional idea of beauty and fashion. For example, few Norwegians still use the headdresses and headpieces that were a part of the traditional costumes, preferring instead to show their hair, in accord with modern, Western fashions. These headdresses, like the one in the photo at the top of this article, were often seen as the most important part of the costume for native practitioners of the customs as the headdress often indicated an individual&#x27;s social or marital status.

There is a continuing debate about the extent to which bunads must conform to the standards, or whether it is acceptable to vary or improvise based on general themes. Some groups (sometimes derisively referred to as the &quot;bunad police&quot;) argue that bunads must be sewn and worn according to strict standards; others advocate a more creative, lenient approach. Traditionally it is correct for women to wear proper bunad shoes and purses, and to avoid wearing sunglasses, earrings, and heavy makeup when dressed in a bunad.

Bunads are nowadays often viewed as a status symbol, ranging in the price of $2,000−10,000, depending on the desired design, material, embroidery, gold, silver and accessories. The price also depends on whether the customer buys from a well-established company like Husfliden, from local sewers or decides to sew or do part of the embroidery themselves. It usually takes up to a year to finish making the bunad, and it has become a tradition for parents to give their children a bunad as a confirmation gift, which they will wear on their confirmation day.


== Traditions ==

In Norway in the postwar era, especially in more recent times, it is common, but by no means mandatory, to wear bunad at various celebrations such as: folk dances, weddings, baptisms, confirmations, Christmas, graduations and especially the May 17 National Day celebrations. In recent years, its use has reached far outside folk dancing, folk music, and particular holidays. Accepted as proper gala attire, it is increasingly common to see people, and especially women, dressed in bunad. The former Norwegian foreign minister, Thorvald Stoltenberg, made history by presenting his accreditation as ambassador to Margrethe II of Denmark dressed in a bunad. Bunads were also conspicuous among those present at the Blessing of the Reign of King Harald and Queen Sonja, demonstrating that the bunad is now considered acceptable as an alternative form of formal wear even on the most solemn public occasions.

There is ongoing debate about the official status of various outfits, and what allowed variations are. Due to ongoing discussions on the status of bunads, it is not possible to state accurately the number of different types of bunads in Norway, but most estimates place the number at around 200. In 1947 an official institution, the National Committee for Bunad-related Questions (&quot;Landsnemnda for Bunadspørsmål&quot;) was organized to act in an advisory capacity on all questions dealing with bunads in Norway. That function is presently assigned to the Norwegian Institute for Costume and Folk Costume (&quot;Norsk institutt for bunad og folkedrakt&quot;), a national institution dealing with documentation and research of folk costumes as a cultural expression. Since 2008, the institution&#x27;s management has operated in cooperation with the Valdres Folkemuseum (&quot;Valdresmusea&quot;) with which it shares facilities in Fagernes. The institute has established an archive of costume registrations, photo, cut patterns and sketches, and writings of traditional material from various districts.

From the late 19th century until quite recently the image which was most commonly used to represent the Norwegian traditional rural dress in general was that of the Hardanger woman&#x27;s bunad, but in more recent times this image is being increasingly superseded by that of the East Telemark woman&#x27;s bunad. As the bunad most often is based upon older designs from specific areas, the particular bunad will get its name from that area. Most people with roots from an area will choose (if not the same) bunads from their own area or their (grand)parents birthplace. People in general will expect that your bunad represents an area that you have a strong connection to. However, there is no specific rule that states your choice, and you are free to pick whatever kind you like. In the meantime, local bunad-sellers might have some difficulties with getting the right bunad if it is not from their area.

== Origins ==

The various bunads have been designed through different means. Some of them are based on old local customs; other models are constructions made in the 20th century, relying (often very loosely) on local and historical material. The interest for bunads dates back to Norwegian romantic nationalism and gained increasing interest with the folk-dance movement at the beginning of the 20th century.

While the contemporary bunad tradition has most of its roots in folk costumes from the 18th and 19th centuries, records documenting the use of folk costumes go as far back as the Middle Ages. Setesdal in Southern Norway, for example, had a folk costume tradition dating back to the 14th century that remained relatively untouched until the middle of the 20th century. Norwegians from Setesdal still wear this time-honored traditional costume as a bunad today. Such long-standing folk costume traditions can be found all over Norway, but not all regions have retained these traditions as well as areas like Setesdal. In Trøndelag in central Norway, for example, the traditional costumes fell by the wayside in favor of modernized versions, but are now starting be revived in the local populations and used as conventional bunad again. The names of these traditional bunads are based on their geographic origin, and traditionally, people choose their bunad based on their own or their ancestors’ origin.

Hulda Garborg (1862–1934) and Klara Semb (1884–1970) are cited as pioneers in bringing bunads into mainstream culture. With Garborg&#x27;s publication of the pamphlet &quot;Norsk Klædebunad&quot; in 1903, the focus moved from the creation of a single national costume to the development of several regional bunads. Although bunads are based on traditions in various areas, these designs are embellished by additions such as embroidery. The overarching sense of bunad design is to preserve the way people dressed for festive occasions in one particular era. This has led local and national councils to impose official constraints on various details in the bunad, including colors, fabric, embroidery, jewellery, cut, and allowable headwear.

== Designs and popularity ==
The designs are typically elaborate, with embroidery, scarves, shawls and hand-made silver or gold jewelry known as &quot;sølje&quot;. There are bunads both for men and women, although women&#x27;s bunads are more diverse and popular. However, according to daily manager Turid Liss Agersborg at Husfliden Oslo, they now produce and sell more men&#x27;s bunads than women&#x27;s for the first time in history. The male customers are often characterized as urban and modern, and range between the ages of 20 and 40 years old.

<text>The Sentinals were a surf rock band from San Luis Obispo, California (1961–1965). The band is notable for a Latino influence in some works, such as &quot;Latin&#x27;ia&quot; (1962). Notable band members included Tommy Nuñes, drummer John Barbata (later of The Turtles and Jefferson Starship) and Lee Michaels (then known as Michael Olsen) on keyboards.

==Background==
Even though a surf group, they added an appealing Latin accent to their music. According to band member John Barbata, as mentioned in Craig Fenton&#x27;s &quot;Take Me to a Circus Tent: The Jefferson Airplane Flight Manual&quot;, the group was actually rhythm and Blues.

==Career==
===1960s===
In the summer of 1962, the group toured the country and opened for bands including The Coasters and The Righteous Brothers. Also that year, through Norman Knowles, the group came across Tony Hilder, whose company Anthony Music would later become involved in legal action with Del-Fi records, slapping the label with a $122,000 lawsuit as a result of royalties not being paid. This was relating to an alleged agreement for the masters of albums by The Sentinels, The Centurians, Dave Myers and the Surftones, etc.

In 1963 the band was featured in the March 16 issue of &quot;Central Coast Living&quot; section of &quot;The Tribune&quot;. Kenny Hinkle was pictured on the cover. Also that year, their &quot;Big Surf&quot; album was released on the Del-Fi label.

According to Robert J. Dalley&#x27;s book &quot;Surfin&#x27; Guitars: Instrumental Surf Bands of the Sixties&quot;, the 1965 line up consisted of John Barbata, Ron Gornell, Kenny Hinkle, Norman Knowles, and Tommy Nuñes.

===1970s to 1980s===
In August 1984, they got together and played at the San Luis Obispo Officer&#x27;s Club. This live reunion was for their twenty-year class reunion.

===1990s to present===
In 1996, Del-Fi released the &quot;Big Surf Hits&quot; various artists compilation album, featuring their track &quot;Big Surf&quot;. Other artists on the album were The Impacts, Dave Myers and The Surftones and The Lively Ones.

<text>U.S. Route 191 (US 191) is a north–south highway in the Western United States and a spur of parent route U.S. Route 91 that has two segments. The southern segment runs for from Douglas, Arizona on the Mexican border to the southern part of Yellowstone National Park. The northern segment runs for from the northern part of Yellowstone National Park to Loring, Montana, at the Canada–US border. Unnumbered roads within Yellowstone National Park connect the two segments. The highway passes through the states of Arizona, Utah, Wyoming, and Montana.

The highway was designated in 1926 and its routing has changed drastically through the years. The modern US 191 bears almost no resemblance to the original route, which was primarily in the state of Idaho. Most of the current route of US 191 was formed in 1981. Since the extensions in the 1980s and 1990s, U.S. Route 191 is much longer than its parent route to which it no longer connects, and it is one of the longest U.S. three-digit routes.

===Arizona===

US 191 begins in Cochise County, Arizona at a signaled intersection with Arizona State Route 80 (SR 80) and Historic U.S. Route 80 (Historic US 80) near Douglas. The highway then proceeds north past Bisbee Douglas International Airport passing through the hamlets of Elfrida and McNeal. Near Sunizona, US 191 intersects with the western terminus of SR 181. US 191 then curves west for before turning northwest through Sunsites and Cochise. US 191 intersects Interstate 10 (I-10) near Cochise at a trumpet interchange (I-10 Exit 331). US 191 and I-10 run concurrent for around Willcox. In Willcox, I-10/US 191 serves as the northern terminus for SR 186 at Exit 340. The city itself is served by the Willcox I-10 Business Loop, which begins and ends at I-10/US 191 southwest and northeast of the city. In Bowie Junction at Exit 352, US 191 leaves I-10 and heads north, exiting Cochise County and entering Graham County. US 191 has a overlay with US 70 east of Safford. The route links to State Route 366 (SR 366) and SR 266 to the south of Safford. The route between Springerville and Morenci was designated a National Scenic Byway and given the name of Coronado Trail Scenic Byway, as this approximates the path taken by Francisco Vásquez de Coronado between 1540 and 1542. This is a very dangerous mountain road with many sharp curves and little or no shoulders on steep cliffs. North of the byway, the highway is the primary route to access Canyon de Chelly National Monument. US 191 traverses the Navajo Nation before entering Utah.

US 191 has a detached business route in Arizona, running from SR 80/Historic US 80 in Douglas, along Pan American Ave to the US Customs/Immigration Port of Entry at the border with Mexico. The portion of this route between its intersection with SR 80 near Douglas and the intersection with Interstate 40 at Sanders was formerly the major Arizona portion of US 666. Part of US 191 through the Navajo Nation is designated by the Arizona Department of Transportation as the Tse&#x27;nikani Flat Mesa Rock Scenic Road.

===Utah===

US 191 serves the eastern half of the state. The road enters Utah in a remote portion of the Navajo Nation. The highway passes through mostly desolate areas of eastern Utah. Several portions are National or Utah Scenic Byways. It passes through Bluff, Blanding, Monticello (the seat of San Juan County), and Moab, the largest city in southeastern Utah and the seat of Grand County. It connects with U.S. Routes 6 and 50 as it joins Interstate 70 going due west through the town of Green River, home of the John Wesley Powell Museum. A few miles west of town it splits off with US 6 and continues north between the San Rafael Reef to the west and Book Cliffs to the east through Emery County. It then enters the historic coalfields of Carbon County, passing through Wellington and Price, the largest city in Eastern Utah, home to the USU Eastern Prehistoric museum, and historic Helper, the main stop for Amtrak between Provo, Utah and Grand Junction, Colorado. In addition to linking many rural towns in Utah to I-70 and US 40, the highway served to interconnect several national and state parks for tourism, namely Canyonlands National Park, Arches National Park, Bears Ears National Monument, and Dead Horse Point State Park. The highway exits Utah just after crossing the Flaming Gorge Reservoir.

===Wyoming===
US 191 enters Wyoming near a geographical feature known as Minnie&#x27;s Gap, just east of Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area. The route proceeds north through rugged desert country following an alignment mostly constructed during the 1970s, to a junction with Interstate 80 at Exit 99, just west of Rock Springs. This segment of the route is known locally as &quot;East Flaming Gorge Road.&quot;

The route is then concurrent with Interstate 80 eastward for approximately , passing just north of Rock Springs. US 191 diverges northward at Exit 104, following the former route of US 187. Traveling through high desert country, the route passes through Eden, Farson, and Pinedale before meeting US 189 at Daniel Junction. Continuing north, the road traverses increasingly mountainous terrain, entering the Bridger-Teton National Forest and passing through the small community of Bondurant before descending through the narrow Hoback River Canyon to an intersection with US 26 and US 89 at Hoback Junction. The route then follows the Snake River valley northward to Jackson. US 191 is concurrent with US 189 between Daniel Junction and Jackson, and with US 26 and US 89 between Hoback Junction and Jackson.

North of Jackson, US 191 soon enters Grand Teton National Park, running concurrently with US 26 and US 89. The highway meets US 287 at Moran Junction, inside the park; US 191, US 89, and US 287 are concurrent north of Moran, but the highways are not signed. Continuing through forested, mountainous country, the route passes through the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial Parkway before ending at the South Entrance of Yellowstone National Park. While US 191 and other U.S. Routes are officially discontinuous through the park, some commercially produced maps show these highways running inside Yellowstone National Park itself along its unnumbered roads and across the Wyoming–Montana state line.

===Montana===

US 191 in Montana begins at the West Entrance to Yellowstone National Park, at the edge of the town of West Yellowstone. The highway heads north, running concurrently with US 287 for before veering slightly east and entering Yellowstone. US 191 continues northward through Yellowstone, traversing forested, mountainous terrain and briefly looping into the state of Wyoming, before leaving the park in the upper reaches of the Gallatin River canyon. The route travels northward through the narrow canyon, past the resort community of Big Sky, then entering the Gallatin Valley near the town of Gallatin Gateway, Montana. US 191 travels north and east through the valley to the city of Bozeman, which is the largest city along the entire US 191 route.

From Bozeman, US 191 is concurrent with I-90 eastward to Big Timber, where it proceeds north. The road travels through hilly ranch country near the eastern edge of the Crazy Mountains to Harlowton, where US 191 is briefly concurrent with US 12. North of Harlowton, US 191 is concurrent with Montana Highway 3 for , to Eddie&#x27;s Corner. US 191 proceeds eastward from Eddie&#x27;s Corner to Lewistown, on a roadway shared with US 87 and Montana 200, in a wrong-way concurrency.

US 191 reaches the Canada–US border after going through Lewistown, across the Missouri River at the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge, and through Malta. It ends at the international border at Port Morgan, and the road continues into Saskatchewan as Highway 4 toward Swift Current.

==History==
===Background===
The routing of US 191 has drastically changed through the years having been extended and shortened several times. The original route designated in 1926 ran from Idaho Falls, Idaho, to West Yellowstone, Montana along the route now numbered U.S. Route 20. West Yellowstone is the only town that has been continuously served by the highway since its commissioning. On February 1, 1935, US 191 was extended over Montana Highway 187 (also known as the Gallatin Way) to Bozeman, Montana.

At one time US 191 connected to its parent, US 91, twice: at Idaho Falls, Idaho and Brigham City, Utah. Today the highway does not connect to its parent, or even enter Idaho. In Utah, there have been 2 completely different iterations of U.S. 191 serving different areas of the state. The original iteration is now State Route 13, which is mostly a frontage road for Interstate 15. In this alignment, the route in between Idaho Falls and the Utah line also paralleled I-15. As US 191 has mostly been extended while US 91 has largely been truncated, US 191 is now ten times longer than its parent.

===1981 extension===
By 1981, due to the construction of Interstate 15 and extension of other U.S. Highway designations, US 191 had been truncated to a route between West Yellowstone and Malta, Montana. Utah and Wyoming lobbied AASHTO to create a single highway that would connect several National Parks in their states to facilitate tourism. The initial proposal was to extend U.S. Route 163 north into Wyoming. However it was later decided to add Arizona to this proposal for a new highway and instead extend US 191 south. Most of the southern extension recycled existing U.S. and state highways. However, some new sections were constructed. When the 1981 extension was finished, US 191 reached Interstate 40 in Arizona.

In Wyoming, the new US 191 absorbed what was U.S. Route 187, formed in 1926 as a branch from US 87W (now US 287) at Jackson Lake Junction, Wyoming south to US 30 in Rock Springs. Although it became part of US 191 in 1981, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials still lists it in their latest log (1989), with a short independent section in Rock Springs between former US 30 (now US 30 Business) and I-80.

A combination of new construction and the upgrading of county roads created a more direct route between Interstate 80 in Wyoming and Flaming Gorge Reservoir.

Through Utah, US-191 absorbed SR-33, SR-260, and most of SR-44. From Crescent Junction to Bluff was previously numbered U.S. Route 163, eliminating all but a short segment of that route. US 191 was extended over BIA Route 12 from Bluff, Utah to a junction with U.S. Route 160 in Arizona. The 1981 extension caused US 191 to enter Arizona for the first time in its history, ending at I-40 in Chambers, Arizona. Between US 160 and I-40 the highway absorbed the route of former State Route 63.

===Later extensions===
In 1992, Arizona requested a new number for its portion of US 666. The state wished to remove the US 666 designation from within Arizona, due to public concerns relating to the biblical reference to the number &quot;666&quot;. A secondary reason given by the state was the constant theft of US 666 shields and navigational markers along the highway. As a result, US 191 was extended over I-40 to Sanders, where it absorbed the route of US 666 from Sanders to the Mexican border at Douglas, Arizona. Following the extension of US 191, US 666 was truncated out of Arizona to I-40 in Gallup, New Mexico. In 1996, it became the latest U.S. highway to travel from border to border, with the extension from Malta, Montana to the Canada–US border, absorbing former Montana Secondary Highway 242. In 2003, the remainder of US 666 between I-40 and US 191 in Monticello, Utah was renumbered US 491. The x91 number was decided because the road meets US 191 in Monticello.

<text>Richard Andrew &quot;Butch&quot; Johnson (August 30, 1955 – May 27, 2024) was an American archer. He competed in the Summer Olympics five times, and was a part of the gold medal U.S. team at the 1996 Olympics and the bronze medal U.S. team in the 2000 Olympics.

== 2004 Summer Olympics ==
At the 2004 Olympics, he was surprisingly eliminated by Ron van der Hoff with 135-145 in the round of 64, placing 52nd overall in men&#x27;s individual archery. He later placed 4th as a member of the United States team.

== 2008 Summer Olympics ==
At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing Johnson finished his ranking round with a total of 653 points. This gave him the 40th seed for the final competition bracket in which he faced Andrey Abramov in the first round. Both scored 109 points in the regular match and they had to go to an extra round. In this extra round Abramov scored 25 points, while Johnson advanced to the second round with 26 points. There he faced eight seeded Im Dong-Hyun, who was too strong with 115-106.

Together with Brady Ellison and Vic Wunderle he also took part in the team event. With his 653 score from the ranking round combined with the 664 of Ellison and the 652 of Wunderle the Americans were in 10th position after the ranking round. In the first round they were not able to win against Chinese Taipei that won the confrontation by 222-218.

== After the Olympics ==
Johnson maintained himself as one of the best recurve shooters in the country, having ranked in the top five in the United States and placed sixth in the 2012 U.S. Olympic Team Trials. Amid speculation that he would retire following the Trials, Johnson came back to finish second in the 2012 National Target Championships and won a silver medal in the 2012 Hoyt World Open, second only to number one world ranked archer Brady Ellison.

== Personal life ==
Johnson was married to Teresa and had at least one child. He died in Woodstock, Connecticut on 27 May 2024, at the age of 68, after several years of living with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

<text>Jacques Doriot (; 26 September 1898 – 22 February 1945) was a French politician, initially communist, later fascist, before and during World War II.

In 1936, after his exclusion from the French Communist Party, he founded the French Popular Party (PPF) and took over the newspaper &quot;La Liberté&quot;, which took a stand against the Popular Front.

During the war, Doriot was a radical supporter of collaboration and contributed to the creation of the Legion of French Volunteers against Bolshevism (LVF). He fought personally in German uniform on the Eastern Front, with the rank of lieutenant.

==Early life and politics==
Doriot moved to Saint Denis, near Paris, at an early age and became a labourer. In 1916, in the midst of World War I, he became a committed socialist, but his political activity was halted by his joining the French Army in 1917. Participating in active combat during World War I, Doriot was captured by enemy troops and remained a prisoner of war until 1918. For his wartime service, especially for rescuing a fellow wounded soldier from no-mans-land, Doriot was awarded the Croix de guerre.

After being released, he returned to France and in 1920 joined the French Communist Party (PCF), quickly rising through the party - within a few years, he had become one of the PCF&#x27;s major leaders. In 1922 he became a member of the Presidium of the Executive Committee of the Comintern, and a year later was made Secretary of the French Federation of Young Communists. In 1923, Doriot was arrested for violently protesting French occupation of the Ruhr Area. He was released a year later, upon being elected to the French Chamber of Deputies (the Third Republic equivalent of the National Assembly) by the people of Saint Denis.

==Fascism==
In 1931, Doriot was elected mayor of Saint Denis. Around this time, he opposed the &quot;social fascism&quot; theory and came to advocate a Popular Front alliance between the Communists and other French socialist parties with whom Doriot sympathized on a number of issues and worried that exclusion would alienate valuable political allies. Although this would soon become official Communist Party policy, at the time it was seen as heretical and Doriot was expelled from the Communist Party in 1934. This expulsion provoked a great sadness in Doriot, but above all a great anger and a thirst for revenge against the PCF leadership.

Still a member of the Chamber of Deputies, Doriot struck back at the Communists who had renounced him: now bitter towards the Comintern, his views turned to embrace the French nation, evolving into a &#x27;national&#x27; socialism—as opposed to the socialism of the Third International. By now embodying fascist more than socialist ideals, Doriot founded the ultra-nationalist &quot;Parti Populaire Français&quot; (PPF) in 1936. Doriot and his supporters were vocal advocates of France becoming organized along the lines of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany and were bitter opponents of Socialist Premier Léon Blum and his Popular Front coalition.

==Collaboration==

When France went to war with Germany in 1939, Doriot was mobilized and fought at the front as a sergeant. After the armistice in June 1940, he was demobilized. He became a staunch pro-German and supported Germany&#x27;s occupation of northern France in 1940, specifically due to Hitler&#x27;s anti-Bolshevik policy. Doriot resided in collaborationist Vichy France for a time and was made a member of the National Council of Vichy France in January 1941, but he eventually found that the Vichy regime was not nearly as Fascist as he had hoped it would be and moved to occupied Paris, where he espoused pro-German and anti-communist propaganda on Radio Paris. In 1941, he and fellow fascist collaborator Marcel Déat founded the &quot;Légion des Volontaires Français&quot; (LVF), a French unit of the Wehrmacht.

Doriot fought with the LVF and saw active duty on the Eastern Front when Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941 and was awarded the Iron Cross in 1943. In his absence leadership of the PPF officially passed to a directorate, although real power came to lie with Maurice-Yvan Sicard. In December 1944, Doriot travelled to Germany and made contact with the former members of the Vichy regime and other collaborators who had gathered together in the Sigmaringen enclave. Doriot&#x27;s PPF struggled to assume a leadership role within the French expatriate community, basing itself in Mainau and setting up its own radio station, &quot;Radio-Patrie&quot;, at Bad Mergentheim and publishing its own paper &quot;Le Petit Parisien&quot;. The PPF was also involved in conducting intelligence and sabotage activities by supplying some volunteers whom the Germans dropped by parachute into liberated France. He was killed on 22 February 1945 while traveling from Mainau to Sigmaringen when his car was strafed by Allied fighter planes. He was buried in Mengen.

<doc id="904732" wikidata="Q1281029" url="?curid=904732" title="Marmalade (band)">
<text>Marmalade are a Scottish pop rock band originating from the east end of Glasgow, originally formed in 1961 as The Gaylords, and then later billed as Dean Ford and the Gaylords, recording four singles for Columbia (EMI). In 1966 they changed the band&#x27;s name to The Marmalade and were credited as such on all of their subsequent recorded releases with CBS Records and Decca Records until 1972. Their greatest chart success was between 1968 and 1972, placing ten songs on the UK Singles Chart, and many overseas territories, including international hits &quot;Reflections of My Life&quot;, which reached No. 10 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Chart and No. 3 on the UK chart in January 1970, and &quot;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da&quot;, which topped the UK chart in January 1969, the group becoming the first-ever Scottish artist to top that chart. 
The original members began to drift away in the early 1970s, resulting in the band departing Decca in 1972.
In 1973 the first evolved line up of the band rejoined EMI Records and with their first record release became known simply as Marmalade. All subsequent record releases are credited similarly.

Graham Knight (an ongoing member from the pre-Marmalade &quot;Dean Ford and the Gaylords&quot; lineup) remained until September 2010. 
The band still exists, with none of the founding members, and many additional further evolved lineups including vocalist Sandy Newman, a member since 1975, touring the nostalgia circuit.

==History==
===The Gaylords===
The Gaylords (named after the notorious post war Chicago Gaylords street gang) were originally formed by Pat Fairley and Billy Johnston in Baillieston, a suburb east of Glasgow, in 1961. Their initial line-up included Tommy Frew on drums and lead guitarist Pat McGovern, fronted by vocalist Wattie Rodgers. William Junior Campbell joined on his 14th birthday on 31 May 1961 replacing McGovern, and Rodgers was then himself replaced, initially by two new lead vocalists, Billy Reid and Tommy Scott, although Reid soon departed leaving Scott as the sole frontman. Bill Irving, from local Baillieston group the Cadillacs, then took over from Johnston on bass.
The group began gathering notice and in 1963 Fairley and Campbell spotted Thomas McAleese, singer with local group the Monarchs, at the Barrowland Ballroom in Glasgow, and it was not long before he replaced Scott as lead singer. McAleese then adopted the stage moniker Dean Ford, and they then became known as Dean Ford and The Gaylords. Raymond Duffy, from Glasgow group the Escorts, then came in on drums after Frew departed. For a few months, they had an organist, Davey Hunter. By early 1965, Graham Knight, from the local group the Vampires, had displaced Irving on bass.

Becoming popular in Scotland, and under the management of Billy Grainger, in early 1964 they were championed by Scottish music journalist Gordon Reid, which led to them being signed to EMI&#x27;s Columbia label by Norrie Paramor after auditions at Glasgow&#x27;s Locarno Ballroom. They went on to record four singles, including a cover of the 1963 Chubby Checker US hit &quot;Twenty Miles&quot;, which was a big seller locally but failed to chart nationally. The Columbia releases, although uncredited, were all produced by Bob Barratt, EMI staff producer, with Norrie Paramor as executive. Paramor played the celesta on &quot;What&#x27;s The Matter With Me&quot;; the b-side of &quot;Twenty Miles&quot;. In 1965, they played a long stint in Germany at the Storyville in Cologne and also in Duisburg. By this time The Gaylords had attained status as one of the top groups in Scotland, borne out in music poll results, but were ambitious, and so on their return from Germany to London in early 1965, they decided to try for success in the UK as a whole, and remained in London, where they changed management and agency representation, as Billy Grainger wished to remain in Glasgow.

===Name change and the CBS era===
On the recommendation of the Tremeloes, who had played with them in Glasgow, the Gaylords were invited to join the London-based agency Starlite Artistes, owned and managed by Peter Walsh. They then began to build up a club reputation as a tight, close harmony band and in 1966, finding themselves in the middle of the 1960s swinging London scene, they decided to update their image and instrumentation. On the advice of their new manager, they changed the band name to &quot;The Marmalade&quot;. According to a 2009 interview with Graham Knight, the inspiration behind the Marmalade name came when their manager was eating breakfast and across from him was a jar of marmalade featuring a Golliwog on the label, their manager said &quot;it were staring me in the face as I were having my breakfast&quot;. The Golliwog character use to be on the Alan Whitehead&#x27;s bass drum. Unusually, they now had two bass players, Knight on four-string and Fairley on six-string (Fairley having dropped the standard rhythm guitar normally associated with rock groups of the early 1960s).

With their EMI Columbia contract at an end, Walsh, with the help of John Salter, Walsh&#x27;s booking agent, was successful in signing the band to CBS Records with producer Mike Smith, who was having great success with the Tremeloes, now their agency stablemates. But their first few CBS singles also failed to chart in the UK.

Drummer Ray Duffy (who later played with Matthews Southern Comfort and Gallagher and Lyle and also on Campbell&#x27;s later solo recordings), decided to leave in 1966 to return to Scotland to get married just after their first CBS release, &quot;Its All Leading up to Saturday Night&quot;. The band then placed adverts in the New Musical Express and Melody Maker, and after various auditions, former postman Alan Whitehead ex member of London outfit the Loose Ends became their new drummer, debuting on their next single, &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Now&quot;, which failed to sell despite the group&#x27;s performing it on a TV play, &quot;The Fantasist&quot;, written by Alun Owen, for the BBC Two &quot;Theatre 625&quot; series.

Their third CBS single, the self penned &quot;I See the Rain&quot;, written by Campbell and Ford, was praised by Jimi Hendrix as the &quot;best cut of 1967&quot;. It became a chart-topper in the Netherlands the same year. Graham Nash of the Hollies contributed to the session, but it too flopped in the UK, although the track, with its distinct 1960s feel, has since attained a cult following and been resurrected by artists such as Susanna Hoffs of the Bangles and Matthew Sweet. (see &quot;Under the Covers, Vol. 1&quot;)

19 January 1967 proved to be a turning point in the band&#x27;s progress when they made their debut at London&#x27;s Marquee Club where they supported Pink Floyd. Two weeks later, on 3 February, they supported the Action. After that, they never supported anyone again at the Marquee and on 16 March 1967 they began a long residency which carried through to the autumn of the following year, building a reputation and following, including touring with the Who, Joe Cocker, Traffic, Gene Pitney and the Tremeloes. This culminated with summer appearances at the Windsor Jazz and Rock Festival, directly preceding Jerry Lee Lewis, and Festival of the Flower Children Woburn Abbey.
CBS, concerned at Marmalade&#x27;s lack of commercial success, threatened to drop them if they did not have a hit. So after the failure of another self-penned single later that year, &quot;Man in a Shop&quot;, they were urged to record more chart-orientated material. Mike Smith offered the band &quot;Everlasting Love&quot;, but they declined as they preferred to continue to record group based material rather than with large orchestral accompaniment. The song was then given to Love Affair, arranged by Keith Mansfield, which became a No. 1 for them. They later gave in to pressure and recorded &quot;Lovin&#x27; Things&quot; written by Artie Schroeck and Jet Loring in 1967, and arranged by Mansfield using a similar orchestral formula (Mansfield already knew the band and had previously arranged earlier cuts including their previous single &quot;Man in a Shop&quot;) It reached No. 6 in the UK Singles Chart in the summer of 1968. This was covered by the Grass Roots in the US in 1969, using virtually the same arrangement. Marmalade&#x27;s debut album, &quot;There&#x27;s A Lot Of It About&quot;, featured a mix of some of their singles and cover versions of current popular tunes, and was released in 1968.

Marmalade made a cameo appearance on the big screen in the film &quot;Subterfuge&quot; that year.

After a lesser hit with their follow-up single &quot;Wait For Me Mary-Anne&quot; (written by Alan Blaikley and Ken Howard), which made No. 30, they enjoyed their biggest UK success with their cover of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da&quot;, which topped the UK chart in January 1969, the group becoming the first Scottish group to top that chart. Their version of &quot;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da&quot; sold around half a million in the UK, and a million copies globally by April 1969. This was followed by further success with &quot;Baby Make It Soon&quot; (written by Tony Macaulay), which reached No. 9 in the summer of 1969.

In February 1969, the band appeared on the BBC&#x27;s flagship program &quot;Colour Me Pop&quot;, (precursor to &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot;) performing a halfhour slot. They also appeared on the BBC&#x27;s review of the 1960s music scene, &quot;Pop Go The Sixties&quot;, performing &quot;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da&quot; live on the broadcast on BBC 1 on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1969.

===Decca era===
In November 1969, the band was signed to Decca Records by Decca head of A&amp;R, Dick Rowe under a lucrative advance deal, allowing the band to write and produce their own songs, with no studio time restraints, and in their first Decca recording session, they recorded &quot;Reflections of My Life&quot;, which would become their biggest worldwide hit, rewarding Decca&#x27;s and Dick Rowe&#x27;s faith in the band. Topping the charts in Europe (also Top 10 in United States and No. 1 in most of South America), it was written by Campbell and Ford, and featured a &quot;backwards&quot; (backmasking) guitar solo by Campbell. &quot;Reflections of My Life&quot; has recorded over two million sales, and the writers were awarded a Special Citation of Achievement in 1998 by BMI in attaining radio broadcast performances in excess of one million in the US alone.

Other UK hits for Decca included &quot;Rainbow&quot; (UK No. 3 and US No. 51) and &quot;My Little One&quot; (UK No. 15)., &quot;Cousin Norman&quot; and &quot;Radancer&quot; (both reaching UK No. 6).

Their manager, Peter Walsh, was a 1960s and 1970s pop entrepreneur whose portfolio also included the Tremeloes, Bay City Rollers, the Move, Billy Ocean, the Troggs and Blue Mink.

Their first Decca album, &quot;Reflections Of The Marmalade&quot; was released in the US as &quot;Reflections Of My Life&quot; on Decca&#x27;s London Records subsidiary. Their US singles during this era likewise came out on London. But their manager, Walsh, turned down an offer to tour the US opening for Three Dog Night, thus blowing an opportunity for further exposure there. To be fair to Walsh, he did not much care for the fact that Marmalade would have had to pay a substantial dollar premium to do so, a practice common in the US but totally alien to Walsh&#x27;s traditional UK management and agency style.

After Campbell, who co-wrote most of the group&#x27;s original material with Ford, left the band in March 1971 for a solo career, and to study orchestration and composition at the Royal College of Music, they began a series of line-up changes, including the loss of drummer Whitehead.

Marmalade recruited guitarist Hugh Nicholson, an ex-member of the Poets, to replace Campbell, and after the first post Campbell release, &quot;Cousin Norman&quot;, it was Dean Ford who insisted on sacking Whitehead and recruiting from the Poets, Dougie Henderson. This caused Marmalade to suffer adverse publicity from the UK&#x27;s &quot;News of the World&quot; after an embittered Whitehead gave them stories of the band&#x27;s experiences with groupies.

Marmalade released &quot;Songs&quot; in November 1971, with Nicholson taking over most song compositions, which met with limited success. However, Nicholson penned two of their last hits, &quot;Cousin Norman&quot; (brass arranged by Campbell) and &quot;Radancer&quot;, as well as the lesser hit &quot;Back on the Road&quot;, on which he sang lead vocal.

Fairley quit the band circa 1972 to run the group&#x27;s music publishing company, then Nicholson, who was discouraged over the failure of their &quot;Songs&quot; album, also left in 1973 to form Blue (not to be confused with a later boy band of the same name). Ford, Knight and Henderson carried on with Marmalade. Nicholson was eventually replaced by Mike Japp, a rock guitarist from the Welsh band, Thank You.

The group returned to EMI and released a new single, &quot;Wishing Well&quot;, credited simply as Marmalade (dropping the &quot;The&quot;). But Knight left during the recording of their next album, &quot;Our House Is Rocking&quot; (which showcased a heavier rock sound and was delayed until the autumn of 1974) and the group was briefly a trio before Joe Breen (ex-Dream Police) came in on bass. Refusing to play most of the band&#x27;s old hit records on stage, the group slowly came to a standstill.

===1975–1978===
In 1975, Knight linked up with former drummer Alan Whitehead to form &#x27;Vintage Marmalade&#x27; with Sandy Newman (vocals, guitar, keyboards) and Charlie Smith (guitar). They were reunited with their old manager, Peter Walsh, to play all the hits on stage and had a full date sheet.

Later in 1975, after Ford and the remaining members called it quits, Knight and Whitehead took over the name Marmalade with the new line-up, fronted by Newman. They signed a deal with Tony Macaulay&#x27;s Target Records and in 1976, had what turned out to be their final Top 10 hit with the ominously entitled, Macaulay penned song, &quot;Falling Apart at the Seams&quot;. The song also reached the easy listening charts in the U.S. and made the Top 50 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming the group&#x27;s last charting single on the U.S charts. Subsequent singles failed to chart. One of these was &quot;Talking In Your Sleep&quot;, produced by Roger Greenaway and released in January 1978, six months ahead of the Crystal Gayle version of the same song, which became well known worldwide.

Newman (ex-Chris McClure Section, 1968–1970) has continued to front Marmalade since 1975, releasing a further eleven singles in the UK (excluding re-releases), seven of which were via Target Records, none of which have charted in the UK or US, and today they continue to tour the nostalgia circuit performing the band&#x27;s full hit repertoire.

Smith departed in 1977 to join Nicholson in Blue and Garth Watt-Roy came in briefly for Marmalade&#x27;s &quot;Only Light On My Horizon Now&quot; album, before leaving for the Q-Tips in 1978. He was replaced by guitarist Ian Withington, who appeared alongside Knight, Newman and new drummer Stu Williamson for the next album &quot;Doing It All For You&quot; (1979).

Whitehead left the band in 1978 to manage other pop groups and singers, which he has continued to do. He also appeared in the 2010 TV series &quot;Take Me Out&quot; and ran a lap dance club.

===Subsequent years===
Charlie Smith returned in 1980, as the band&#x27;s drummer this time. Alan Holmes (vocals, guitars, keyboards), a former member of the Bristol-based band Federation, succeeded Withington. A 1980 US only album, &quot;Marmalade&quot;, on G&amp;P Records, featured a re-recorded mix of their Decca, EMI and Target material, alongside some Junior Campbell-penned tracks. Another unsuccessful album, &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, came out in the UK in 1982 on the Spectra label.

Graham Knight remained as the sole original band member touring the nostalgia circuit with Newman, Smith and Alan Holmes. In 1982, Glenn Taylor replaced Smith on drums, though Smith returned from 1989 to around 1998, before Taylor took over permanently.

Dave Dee began appearing as guest singer for Marmalade in 1987 and recorded a single with the band, &quot;Scirocco&quot;, in 1989. He continued to make live guest appearances with them until his death in 2009.

In September 2010 Graham Knight, the last remaining member of the original band, departed. Drummer Taylor also left to join the Fortunes. The new players were drummer Damon Sawyer and bassist Mike Steed. In 2011, guitarist and vocalist John James Newman joined, making the band a quintet once again.

2013 saw the current Marmalade line-up release their first new studio album since 1979. Entitled &quot;Penultimate&quot; and released in CD and vinyl formats, it featured six new compositions, together with re-recordings of many Marmalade songs. The album was launched on 4 October 2013 to coincide with the start of a 52-date UK tour.

In 2015, Jan Robinson (vocals, bass) and Chris North (drums, percussion) were brought in as the new rhythm section, in place of Steed and Sawyer.

===Original band members — evolved history===
2011 saw the release of &quot;Fine Cuts–The Best Of Marmalade&quot; on the Union Square Music BMG Salvo label (SALVOMDCD26), a double album containing all of the Marmalade original studio recordings between 1966 and 1972, including all of their chart hits. The complete catalogue was also made available via digital download.

Ford was one of many lead vocalists contributing to the Alan Parsons Project. Although for some years he withdrew from the music industry and battled alcoholism, settling in Los Angeles, he became active in music again and released a single of his own composition &quot;Glasgow Road&quot; with Joe Tansin (ex-Badfinger) in 2012. He later recorded a version of &quot;Reflections Of My Life&quot; in 2015 and in 2016 released a PledgeMusic album entitled &quot;Feel My Heartbeat&quot;, available for digital download. 
Ford died on 31 December 2018 at the age of 73 at his home in Los Angeles of complications from Parkinson&#x27;s disease. His final album, a two-disc collection called &quot;This Scottish Heart&quot;, was released just weeks before his death.

Fairley also moved to Los Angeles in the late 1970s having worked in music publishing for the RSO Group Robert Stigwood and for the band Yes. He retired from the music business many years ago and set up a bar and music venue called The Scotland Yard Pub, in Los Angeles in the early 1980s: he sold the business in March 2018 and retired. He died at his home in Los Angeles on 11 August 2020, at the age of 76.

Whitehead continues in artist management and can be seen reviewing the Onyx range of tuned sports cars on the Together TV programme &quot;Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll Cars&quot; (he also provides the voice-over for this show, which features pop acts such as Go West and Tony Hadley talking about their motoring history).

Knight retired from Marmalade in September 2010.

Campbell became a solo recording artist, songwriter, television and film composer, record producer and music arranger, and lives in Sussex. He continues to oversee all of the master rights to the original band recordings on behalf of the whole band, which they retain, and also their publishing rights.

<text>The Wednesday Play is an anthology series of British television plays which ran on BBC1 for six seasons from October 1964 to May 1970. The plays were usually original works written for television, although dramatic adaptations of fiction (and occasionally stage plays) also featured. The series gained a reputation for presenting contemporary social dramas, and for bringing issues to the attention of a mass audience that would not otherwise have been discussed on screen.

Some of British television drama&#x27;s most influential, and controversial, plays were shown in this slot, including &quot;Up the Junction&quot; and &quot;Cathy Come Home&quot;. The earliest television plays of Dennis Potter were featured in this slot.

==History==

===Origins and early series===
The series was suggested to the BBC&#x27;s Head of Drama, Sydney Newman, by the corporation&#x27;s director of television Kenneth Adam after his cancellation of the two previous series of single plays. Newman had been persuaded to join the BBC following the success of the similar programme &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot;, which he had produced while Head of Drama at ABC Weekend TV from 1958 to 1962. &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; had tackled many difficult and socially relevant subjects in the then-popular &#x27;kitchen sink&#x27; style, and still managed to gain a mass audience on the ITV network, and Newman wanted a programme that would be able to tackle similar issues with a broad appeal. Newman also wanted to get away from the BBC&#x27;s reputation of producing safe and unchallenging drama programmes, to produce something with more bite and vigour, what Newman called &quot;agitational contemporaneity&quot;.

&quot;The Wednesday Play&quot; succeeded in meeting this aim, and the BBC quickly developed the practice of stockpiling six or seven &quot;Wednesday Plays&quot; in case there were problems with individual works. One production, &quot;The War Game&quot; (1965), was withdrawn from broadcast by a nervous BBC under pressure from the government, while John Hopkins&#x27; &quot;Fable&quot; (20 January 1965), an inversion of South Africa&#x27;s Apartheid system, was delayed for several weeks over fears that it would incite racial tensions.

Intended as a vehicle for new writers, several careers began thanks to the series. Television programmes had a much shorter lead time in this era, and Dennis Potter&#x27;s first four accepted television plays were shown during the course of 1965. The two Nigel Barton plays (8 and 15 December 1965) first brought him to widespread public attention and the slightly earlier &quot;Alice&quot; (13 October 1965), about Lewis Carroll&#x27;s relationship with Alice Liddell, developed themes to which Potter would return.

In the first half of 1966 a series of 26 &quot;Wednesday Plays&quot; were produced by Peter Luke, the playwright, and story edited by David Benedictus. Highlights included &quot;The Snow Ball&quot; (20 April 1966), adapted from the novel by Brigid Brophy, &quot;Toddler on the Run&quot; adapted by Shena Mackay from her novella and directed by James MacTaggart, (25 May 1966), &quot;Cock Hen and Courting Pit&quot; (renamed &quot;A Tour of the Old Floorboards&quot;, 22 June 1966) by David Halliwell and two plays by Frank O&#x27;Connor (which Hugh Leonard adapted) virtually without dialogue and which, renamed &quot;Silent Song&quot;, won The Prix Italia award in 1967 for &#x27;original dramatic programmes&#x27; jointly with a French programme. The other O&#x27;Connor/Leonard work was &quot;The Retreat&quot; (11 May 1966). These two plays starred Milo O&#x27;Shea and Jack MacGowran. &quot;Cathy Come Home&quot; by Nell Dunn and Jeremy Sandford was offered to the Luke/Benedictus team who passed it on to Tony Garnett.

===Tony Garnett and Ken Loach===
Garnett was quickly seen as someone capable of delivering plays which would gain much publicity for the BBC and its Drama department. He had the enthusiastic support of Newman, his immediate superior, who lobbied for increased funding to allow for more location shooting on film rather than shooting productions in the multi-camera electronic television studio, a practice which was felt to impair realism, the preferred mode.

Director Ken Loach made ten plays in all for &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot; series. Two of them are among the best remembered of the entire run: an adaptation of Nell Dunn&#x27;s &quot;Up the Junction&quot; (3 November 1965), and the saga of a homeless young couple and their battle to prevent their children being taken into local authority care: &quot;Cathy Come Home&quot; (16 November 1966). The latter began Loach&#x27;s 13-year collaboration with Tony Garnett as his producer, although Garnett had been closely involved with &quot;Up the Junction&quot; as well.

Plays like &quot;Up the Junction&quot; though were controversial among more conservative viewers. The &#x27;Clean-Up TV&#x27; campaigner Mary Whitehouse accused the BBC of portraying &quot;promiscuity as normal&quot; in &quot;Up the Junction&quot; and &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot; as featuring &quot;Dirt, Doubt and Disbelief&quot;. The writer on television Anthony Hayward quoted Garnett in 2006: &quot;Mary Whitehouse was on the prowl, which was an added frisson, but it was actually very good free publicity and helped the ratings.&quot; The &quot;drama documentary&quot; approach was criticised by television professionals who thought it was dishonest. In a &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; article published before its first repeat transmission Grace Wyndham Goldie complained that &quot;Cathy Come Home&quot; &quot;deliberately blurs the distinction between fact and fiction ... [viewers] have a right to know whether what they are being offered is real or invented.&quot; Loach has admitted that &quot;[w]e were very anxious for our plays not to be considered dramas but as continuations of the news&quot; which preceded &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot;&#x27;s slot.

===Later series===
The last three years of the strand were predominantly produced by Irene Shubik and Graeme MacDonald; by this time the BBC Drama head Sydney Newman had left the BBC. Highlights from this period include several plays by David Mercer such as &quot;In Two Minds&quot; (1 March 1967) and &quot;Let&#x27;s Murder Vivaldi&quot; (10 April 1968) and Potter&#x27;s &quot;Son of Man&quot; (16 April 1969), a modern interpretation of the story of Jesus.

Suffering from declining audience figures, the run of &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot; ended in 1970 when the day of transmission changed, and the series morphed into &quot;Play for Today&quot;.

==Reputation and availability==
It is regarded as one of the most influential and successful programmes to be produced in Britain during the 1960s and is still frequently referenced and discussed. In a 2000 poll of industry professionals conducted by the British Film Institute to find the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes of the 20th century, two &quot;Wednesday Plays&quot; made the list: &quot;The War Game&quot; was placed twenty-seventh, and &quot;Cathy Come Home&quot; was voted the second greatest British television programme of the century.

Some examples of &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot;, such as &quot;The War Game&quot; (which was not screened by the BBC for 20 years) and &quot;Cathy Come Home&quot; (1966), a television play exploring the theme of housing and homelessness, were, according to filmmaker Roger Graef, &quot;a giant wakeup call for the whole nation,&quot; and some of the Potter plays, surfaced on VHS and DVD; the Potter play, &quot;Alice&quot; was a bonus feature of a Region 1 DVD in 2010 of Jonathan Miller&#x27;s surrealist version of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. The Ken Loach material has resurfaced in a &quot;Ken Loach at the BBC&quot; set, and the two plays directed by Alan Clarke in the &quot;Alan Clarke at the BBC&quot; set. However, as with much British television of this era, many episodes are lost, leaving 79 surviving in the archives (along with 3 with some surviving sequences) out of 182 transmitted.

==Productions==
This table is based on records in the BBC Genome archive of the &quot;Radio Times&quot;. Titles billed as &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot; (or &quot;The Wednesday Play presenting: ...&quot;) in the &quot;Radio Times&quot; listings for their first or a subsequent transmission are included, plus an additional two for the reasons given in the notes. Repeats of the individual productions are excluded, as are some additional repeats from &quot;Theatre 625&quot; shown in the Wednesday Play slot during 1968–69 but not billed as such in the &quot;Radio Times&quot;. All episodes were broadcast on BBC1, with the introduction of colour from November 1969.

The archival status has been ascertained for almost all productions based on the BFI National Archive and TV Brain online databases. Most of the extant versions are in the form of 16mm or 35mm black &amp; white telerecordings (prints or negatives), or in a few cases original film versions where that was the original medium used for production. Some of the later plays exist in videotape formats.

<text>The New Apocalyptics were a poetry grouping in the United Kingdom in the 1940s, taking their name from the anthology &quot;The New Apocalypse&quot; (1939), which was edited by J. F. Hendry (1912–1986) and Henry Treece. There followed the further anthologies &quot;The White Horseman&quot; (1941) and &quot;The Crown and Sickle&quot; (1944).

Their reaction against the political realism of much of the Thirties poetry drew for support upon D. H. Lawrence (&quot;Apocalypse&quot;, 1931), surrealism, myth, and expressionism.

== Scottish connection ==
Others closely associated were the Scottish (as Hendry was) poets G. S. Fraser and Norman MacCaig, although the latter saw his work from &quot;Riding Lights&quot; (1955) onwards as part of &quot;the long haul towards lucidity&quot; after his Apocalyptic start.

There was quite an overlap with the &quot;Scottish Renaissance&quot; group of writers, though not necessarily by publication in London. Others sometimes mentioned in this connection include Ruthven Todd, Tom Scott, Hamish Henderson, Maurice Lindsay, Edwin Morgan, Burns Singer, and William Montgomerie. This grouping was fairly represented in &quot;Modern Scottish Poetry&quot; (1946). Welsh and Irish poets were also prominent.

== Others ==
The other poets in the three anthologies were Ian Bancroft, Alex Comfort, Dorian Cooke, John Gallen, Wrey Gardiner, Robert Greacen, Robert Herring, Seán Jennett, Nicholas Moore, Philip O&#x27;Connor, Leslie Phillips, Gervase Stewart, Dylan Thomas, Vernon Watkins, and Peter Wells.

== New Romantics ==
A broader movement of New Romantics has been postulated to cover many of the British poets between the Auden group of the 1930s and The Movement. This is much more debatable; it may be something of a flag of convenience for those such as the followers of Dylan Thomas and George Barker whose style marked them off, or on the other hand a tag for those addressed polemically and retrospectively by the Robert Conquest introduction to the &quot;New Lines&quot; anthology. The phrase &quot;New Romantics&quot; was used at the time, though, for example by Henry Treece; it is usually attributed to Cyril Connolly.

== Effects of the times ==
Wartime conditions had posed great editorial difficulties, and the London operations of the publishers such as Tambimuttu, Grey Walls Press and Fortune Press had been stopgaps.

Kenneth Rexroth produced a post-war anthology covering the period, but it had little circulation in the UK. Another view was that from John Lehmann&#x27;s &quot;New Writing&quot;.

== Retrospect from the 1950s ==
By 1953 John Heath-Stubbs could write of the New Romantics as a movement of the past, though acutely singling out W. S. Graham under the heading of in it, though not of it. This was in the introduction to an anthology &quot;Images of Tomorrow&quot;, which also points out that the debate over the &#x27;romanticism&#x27; was also a fissure within the Christian poets over style—indeed harking back to the religious and psychological depths of &quot;apocalypse&quot;.

<doc id="904761" wikidata="Q2301106" url="?curid=904761" title="Tzachi Hanegbi">
<text>Tzachi Hanegbi (, born 26 February 1957) is an Israeli politician and national security expert serving as Israel&#x27;s National Security Advisor. A member of Likud, Hanegbi previously served as Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Minister of Regional Cooperation and Minister of Community Affairs.

He served as Minister of Justice, Minister of Internal Security, Minister of Intelligence and Nuclear Affairs, and Minister in the Prime Minister&#x27;s office supervising Israel&#x27;s intelligence agencies Mossad and Shin Bet. He was also responsible for overseeing Israel&#x27;s Atomic Energy Agency, and served as the minister in charge of Israel&#x27;s strategic relationship and security dialogue with the United States. He also served as Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and as the Chairman of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee and Majority Leader of the Knesset.

Hanegbi was appointed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to serve as acting prime minister of Israel, from 10 to 17 September 2017, while the prime minister traveled abroad.

He lost his seat in the Knesset in the 2022 Israeli legislative election. In January 2023, Hanegbi was appointed head of the National Security Council.

==Biography==
Hanegbi was born in Jerusalem to Geula Cohen, a prominent member of the 1940s underground group Lehi and later MK for Likud and Tehiya, and Emmanuel Hanegbi, the Operations Officer for the Lehi. After his military service in the paratroopers corps, Hanegbi studied international relations at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. As president of the Hebrew University Student Union in 1980, he received a six-month suspended sentence for leading an attack on Arab students. Despite this incident, he became president of the National Union of Israeli Students later that year, holding that title until 1982. After his undergraduate studies, he went on to study law, obtaining an LL.B.

Hanegbi lives in Mevaseret Zion, a town on the outskirts of Jerusalem.

==Political career==
Hanegbi was on the 37th spot on the Likud list and first elected to the Knesset in the 1988 elections, and headed the Prime Minister&#x27;s Bureau under Yitzhak Shamir. He retained his seat in the 1992 and 1996 elections, and was initially appointed Minister of Health in Binyamin Netanyahu&#x27;s government, becoming Minister of Justice in September 1996 and dropping the health portfolio in November that year.

He lost his ministerial portfolio after Ehud Barak won the 1999 elections, but returned to government when Ariel Sharon won the special election for PM in 2001. Hanegbi was appointed Minister of the Environment in March 2001, adding the Transportation portfolio to his duties later in the year.

After Likud&#x27;s convincing win in the 2003 elections, Hanegbi was appointed Minister of Internal Security. In September 2003 he was appointed by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon as minister in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office in charge of Israel&#x27;s intelligence agencies – the Mossad and Shin Bet, and supervised Israel&#x27;s Atomic Energy Agency.

When Sharon broke away to form Kadima in November 2005, Hanegbi was appointed interim chairman of Likud. On the following day, Hanegbi announced that he was also switching to Kadima, and resigned from the Knesset on 10 December. However, he reappeared in the Knesset in April 2006 after winning a seat in the 2006 elections. From May 2006 until December 2010 Hanegbi served as the Chairman of the Knesset&#x27;s Security and Foreign Affairs Committee.

Placed fourth on the party&#x27;s list, he retained his seat in the 2009 elections.

=== Trial ===
In July 2010, after a four-year trial for election bribery, fraud and breach of trust, Hanegbi was cleared of all charges by a Jerusalem court. However, the three-judge panel found him guilty of perjury. The case stems from Hanegbi&#x27;s denial that he was behind an ad boosting his appointments of Likud party&#x27;s political activists to positions in the Ministry of the Environmental Protection. The judges verdict cleared Hanegbi of any criminal wrongdoing, accepting the defense&#x27;s argument that such appointments were not illegal prior to 2004, and that this was the common practice among all cabinet members in all the previous governments since Israel&#x27;s independence. The court ruled that selectively prosecuting Hanegbi for what was a widespread and common practice was wrong and unfair. Hanegbi was urged by his legal team to appeal the perjury conviction to Israel&#x27;s High court of Justice. Following the verdict, several prominent leaders and officials publicly defended Hanegbi. Former Knesset Speaker Avraham Burg who opposes Hanegbi politically, has called for the firing of the prosecutor by the Attorney General.

On 9 November 2010, the Jerusalem court fined Hanegbi 10,000 NIS, and in a 2-to-1 decision imposed moral turpitude to the offense. Hanegbi therefore suspended himself from the Knesset and from his position as Chairman of the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, pending his legal appeal. His seat was taken by Nino Abesadze.

=== Return to Likud ===
Hanegbi resigned from Kadima and returned to Likud when Kadima decided to leave the short-lived unity government in July 2012. Hanegbi explained that he believed Kadima&#x27;s decision to quit the unity government was irresponsible, and motivated by short-term political goals. Following his decision, Hanegbi was re-elected on the Likud list in the January 2013 elections. In June 2014 he was appointed Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs.

On 30 May 2016 Hanegbi was appointed Minister without portfolio in the Fourth Netanyahu Cabinet, dealing with issues concerning defense and foreign affairs.

On 2 June 2016 Hanegbi denied allegations that he intentionally wrote a report on Operation Protective Edge that cleared the Israeli government of all wrongdoing. He was appointed Acting Minister of Communications in February 2017, a post he held until being replaced by Ayoob Kara in May.

<doc id="904771" wikidata="Q524901" url="?curid=904771" title="Seal of the president of the United States">
<text>The seal of the President of the United States is used to mark correspondence from the President of the United States to the U.S. Congress, and is also used as a symbol of the presidency itself. The central design, based on the Great Seal of the United States, is the official coat of arms of the U.S. presidency and also appears on the presidential flag.

The presidential seal developed by custom over a long period before being defined in law, and its early history remains obscure. The use of presidential seals goes back at least to 1850, and probably much earlier. The basic design of today&#x27;s seal originated with Rutherford B. Hayes, who was the first to use the coat of arms on White House invitations in 1877. The precise design dates from 1945, when President Truman specified it in . The only changes since were in 1959 and 1960, which added 49th and 50th stars to the circle following the admissions of Alaska and Hawaii as states.

==Design and symbolism==
The current seal is defined on , made by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on February 5, 1960, and effective since July 4, 1960. It states:
The blazon (design) is essentially the same as the obverse of the Great Seal of the United States as defined in 1782, although with some extra colors specified, and a different arrangement of the stars, clouds, and glory than is typically seen in modern versions of the Great Seal. The only purely distinct element is the ring of 50 stars, representing the 50 states. Likewise, the symbolism follows that of the Great Seal:
*The stripes on the shield represent the 13 original states, unified under and supporting the chief. The motto (meaning &quot;Out of many, One&quot;) alludes to the same concept.
*The arc of thirteen clouds, and the thirteen stars, also refer to the original 13 states.
*The olive branch and arrows denote the powers of peace and war.

The actual seal die is only used on correspondence from the president to the United States Congress, closing the envelopes with wax seals. This has been the primary use throughout the seal&#x27;s history, though isolated uses have been made for correspondence with other members of government. Documents signed by the president when representing the nation are instead sealed with the Great Seal of the United States.

Strictly speaking, the brass die used at the White House is the only actual seal of the President – other versions are technically &quot;facsimiles&quot;. The Bureau of Engraving and Printing has other dies, used to produce such facsimiles on documents, stationery, and invitations as requested by the White House. Other versions of the seal are often used as a visual symbol to represent the president, and are most often seen:
* on the Blue Goose lectern at presidential press conferences and campaign rallies
* on the sides of presidential transports Air Force One, Marine One, and the presidential limousine
* at the center of the ceiling in the Oval Office of the White House
* affixed to the Truman Balcony A.K.A. the South Portico during a State Arrival Ceremony

The presidential coat of arms (the central device on the seal, i.e. without the encircling &quot;SEAL PRESIDENT UNITED STATES&quot; legend) has even wider usage. It appears:
* on the presidential flag

* on the reverse of the Kennedy half dollar (encircled with &quot;UNITED STATES OF AMERICA&quot; on the top and &quot;HALF DOLLAR&quot; on the bottom). For the United States Bicentennial, a depiction of Independence Hall was used on the reverse of the coin. The seal returned to the reverse starting in 1977.
* at the center of the iconic oval rug in the Oval Office of the White House (each president typically designs his own, but most rugs since President Truman have used the arms).
* incorporated into the Presidential Service Badge issued to U.S. military personnel.
* on many versions of presidential china, such as the Wilson or Reagan china, which is often used at state dinners at the White House.
* at the burial sites of former presidents (e.g., Wilson and Reagan).

===Regulated use===
In general, commercial use of the Seal is prohibited by 18 USC 713 of the United States Code, and further defined by Executive Orders and . The United States Secret Service is authorized to use the seal in conjunction with fund raising sales for its charitable benefit fund.

Unofficial use of the Seal is regulated by the White House Graphics and Calligraphy Office and monitored by the office of the White House Counsel. On September 28, 2005, Grant M. Dixton, associate counsel to George W. Bush, requested that the satirical newspaper &quot;The Onion&quot; remove the presidential seal from its website. The Graphic and Calligraphy Office will approve of the seal&#x27;s use in application of official gifts, an example being its application to a silver cigarette box presented as a gift to Franklin Roosevelt.

==History==
The early history of the president&#x27;s seal remains obscure, as there is essentially no record on early usage, nor when its use started. It appears that the primary use was to seal the envelopes on correspondence from the President to Congress, and the envelopes were presumably discarded even if the correspondence was kept, so there is little record remaining. The first documented seal was in 1850 (which almost certainly was not the first one), and the design used on today&#x27;s seal had its origins in a coat of arms used on invitations by President Hayes in 1877. It was not defined in law until an executive order by President Truman in 1945.

===Seal of the president of the Congress of the Confederation===
During the period of the Congress of the Confederation, prior to the creation of the U.S. federal government and thus the presidency, the President of the Continental Congress (a mostly ceremonial position, elected to preside over meetings) had a seal. It was a small oval, with the crest from the recently adopted Great Seal (the radiant constellation of thirteen stars surrounded by clouds) in the center, with the motto &quot;E Pluribus Unum&quot; above it. Much like today&#x27;s presidential seal, the primary purpose was apparently to seal envelopes on correspondence sent to the Congress. Benson Lossing (writing in 1856) claimed it was used by all Presidents of the Congress after 1782, though only two examples from Thomas Mifflin are documented today: Lossing described a 1784 letter, and Commodore Byron McCandless (while doing research for the 1945 seal redesign) photographed a seal on a November 17, 1783 Mifflin letter to the Governor of Rhode Island. An 1885 article from the &quot;Daily Graphic&quot; included an original engraving of the seal supposedly from a 1784 letter; it is not known if this was just based on Lossing&#x27;s version or if they had a separate impression. None of these impressions are known to still exist, and no confirmation of an order for this seal (proving an official status) has been found in Continental Congress records.

This seal&#x27;s use apparently did not pass over to the new government in 1789.

===Dorsett seal===

In 1894, Palemon Howard Dorsett (a lifelong Department of Agriculture employee) turned up with a metal die very similar to the original die of the Great Seal, except that the arrows and the olive branch were switched, indicating an intentional &quot;difference&quot; to distinguish it from the actual Great Seal. The die had apparently been owned by George Washington, though there are no known uses of this die, and there even is no indication it could actually be used as a seal. The origins and purpose of this die remain unknown, though the authors of a 1978 book on the Great Seal speculated it was a gift to Washington and possibly an early version (or forerunner) of a presidential seal. The Dorsett seal was subsequently loaned to the Mount Vernon Ladies&#x27; Association to be displayed at Washington&#x27;s estate.

===Early presidential seals===
There is little extant evidence of any seals actually used by early U.S. presidents. One possibility is a letter from 1835, sent from Paris to Andrew Jackson and then forwarded to the Department of State. The envelope has a small circular red wax seal, with the upper portion appearing to have a circle of cloud puffs similar to the Great Seal, with rays of a glory. However, the rest of the design has been obliterated, so nothing further can be determined, and no other uses of this seal have been found.
The documented history begins in 1850, when a seal was made after a crude drawing submitted by Millard Fillmore. It depicted an eagle &quot;displayed with wings inverted&quot;, i.e. with its wingtips down, holding an olive branch and three arrows in its talons. The shield is essentially the same as the Great Seal, with a blue chief and red and white stripes and the eagle facing to its right, though there were nineteen stripes and the outermost stripes were red, both unlike the Great Seal. Thirty-one stars were distributed above and around the eagle, indicating that the seal dates from after when California became the 31st state in September 1850. It was made by Edward Stabler, a farmer and postmaster in Sandy Spring, Maryland, who had earlier made seals for the Senate, House of Representatives, and several government departments. Stabler had also made a seal for the Vice President in 1846, and the correspondence surrounding it indicated that even earlier vice-presidential seals existed, so presumably earlier presidential seals existed as well. The president&#x27;s seal was described by Benson Lossing in 1856 as &quot;round, with an eagle upon it&quot; (contrasting it to the seal used during the Continental Congress).
The information on Fillmore&#x27;s seal is from an 1885 article in the &quot;Daily Graphic&quot;, and (according to Daniel S. Lamont, the private secretary to Grover Cleveland and one of the article&#x27;s sources) the 1850 seal was still in use at that time and was used to seal envelopes sent to either house of Congress. The article claims that Stabler made two seals, the other being a smaller one for use on letters, and stated that both were illustrated in the article. While the large seal was illustrated, the rendering of a smaller seal was labeled the &quot;Old Seal&quot; and had only twenty-seven stars, seeming to indicate it would date from 1845 during James K. Polk&#x27;s administration rather than being a smaller 1850 seal. While Fillmore did use a personal seal (a simple script &quot;F&quot; in a circular border) it does not appear that this was the smaller seal mentioned. The design on the &quot;Old Seal&quot; was quite similar to the large version, though it was a different rendering of the eagle with small differences in positioning. The inscriptions were also slightly different; the large seal had , while the smaller one (like the present-day version) omitted the word &quot;The&quot; at the beginning.

===Lincoln&#x27;s seal===
The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum owns a small seal used by Abraham Lincoln, which was previously a part of the Taper Collection. It is about the size of a penny, has an ivory handle, and is still encrusted with red wax. The design is exactly the same as the one labeled the &quot;Old Seal&quot; in the &quot;Daily Graphic&quot; article, except it has 36 stars (Nevada became the 36th state in October 1864). A 1927 book also describes a red wax presidential seal on a letter from Lincoln to Hiram Barney.

In September 1864, an engraver named J. Baumgarten from Baltimore, Maryland made and sent Lincoln an unsolicited seal, marked with &quot;A Lincoln&quot; on its side, meant for personal use. Baumgarten also claimed to have made seals of the &quot;same plan&quot; for both Presidents Fillmore and Buchanan. This was just prior to Nevada becoming the 36th state, but as the design of this seal is not described, and no reply from Lincoln is known and no payment is recorded, it is not possible to know if it was the aforementioned 36-star seal, something similar to the simple &quot;F&quot; seal used by Fillmore, an entirely different seal, or if it was used at all. Baumgarten may well have been related to Selig Baumgarten, an engraver who emigrated to Baltimore from Hanover with eight children in 1852. One of Selig&#x27;s sons, Herman Baumgarten, later engraved the 1877 version of the Great Seal.

===Hayes design===

Rutherford B. Hayes was first to use the presidential coat of arms on White House invitations, and the design used was the direct precursor to the modern version. Its first appearance was in April 1877, about six weeks after his inauguration. The eagle&#x27;s wings were shown &quot;displayed&quot; (wingtips up), with an arc of cloud puffs between the wings, and thirteen stars scattered below the arc and surrounding a scroll reading &quot;E Pluribus Unum&quot;. The eagle&#x27;s head was turned to its left toward the arrows for the first time, a feature which would last until 1945. The eagle itself was similar to the Great Seal rendering at the time (prior to the more robust eagle used in the 1885 redesign of the Great Seal). The designer of this embossing is not known; with minor variations it was used on invitations until the early years of President Wilson&#x27;s administration.
The design using the arc of clouds is reminiscent of an early rendering of the Great Seal made by James Trenchard in 1786, which was then later used on Indian Peace Medals handed out by President Washington. It is also very similar to a design seen on the letterhead of a proclamation by James K. Polk in 1846, which also had the eagle facing its left but additionally switched the olive branch and arrows so the head was still looking towards the branch. (Earlier proclamation letterheads, and even the Jackson White House china, also switched the arrows and branch and had the eagle facing to its left, though they were completely different designs otherwise.) Other influences may have been some U.S. coins and President Grant&#x27;s china, which used the general design of an arc of clouds though the rest of the details were different.
The actual seal used by the president was changed to have a similar design, though apparently not at the time. The &quot;Daily Graphic&quot; article reported the 1850 seal was still in use in 1885, but the change had been made by 1894, as an impression of this new seal was obtained from Henry T. Thurber (President Cleveland&#x27;s private secretary) for use in a book on heraldry. This version moved closer to the modern design, with the words in smaller capital letters than the other words (a feature which is still used), and the layout of stars being slightly changed into essentially the arrangement still used today. This seal remained in use until 1945, as Gaillard Hunt confirmed the design was still current as of 1916, and it also matches actual impressions taken from the presidential seal in 1936 during Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s administration. The design continued to evolve in other places in the meantime, particularly the presidential flag, and these evolved designs were used when the seal was changed again in 1945.

===Martiny plaque===

During renovations in early 1903, a bronze inlaid version of the seal was placed in the floor of the Entrance Hall of the White House, directly under the lantern. It was made from a model by the sculptor Philip Martiny, who followed the general arrangement of the Hayes arms but used considerable artistic license with the details. The eagle is substantially altered, with differently-shaped wings and thickly feathered legs. The shape of the shield was different, and the stars were arranged differently, with all stars appearing above the scroll using an arc of 10 stars with three more directly underneath. The scroll&#x27;s inscription was .

President Truman later felt that it was not right for people to walk over it, so when the White House was renovated again in 1948 he had the seal removed and placed over the door to the Diplomatic Reception Room, where it remains today. The plaster seal in the Oval Office ceiling (originally installed in 1934 and at some point changed so the eagle faces to its right) is also based on this design, and a version is in the floor next to Wilson&#x27;s tomb in the Washington National Cathedral.

===Bailey Banks &amp; Biddle representation===

In 1916, Woodrow Wilson decided to change the presidential flag, the Navy version of which used the Great Seal on a blue background (there was a competing design from the Army, which was different but also used the Great Seal). The Aide to the Secretary of the Navy, Lt. Commander Byron McCandless, suggested adding four stars to the Navy version. Wilson however wanted the &quot;President&#x27;s eagle&quot; used on the flag instead, showing McCandless the Martiny plaque as an example. Wilson at some point obtained a color print of the president&#x27;s seal, probably from the Philadelphia firm of Bailey Banks &amp; Biddle, which was also used in the discussions. The eagle in this version was more based on the 1885 Great Seal, and is essentially the design used in the modern seal – the style and details of the eagle, the rays of the glory, the arrangement of the thirteen stars, and the cloud puffs have all been carried over into the current version.

This design was used for the 1916 flag, and also on subsequent presidential invitations and Wilson&#x27;s presidential china, meaning the coat of arms was effectively changed as well. The actual presidential seal die was not changed at the time, though a 1917 McCandless publication on flags did show the new design as its depiction the seal.

===The 1945 seal===

In March 1945, Franklin Roosevelt (who had been Assistant Secretary of the Navy during Wilson&#x27;s administration and was involved in the four-star 1916 presidential flag design) noted that the flags for the new ranks of Fleet Admiral and General of the Army both had five stars, and asked the Army and Navy Departments for suggestions. The Secretary of the Navy (whose flag also had four stars) replied that there was no issue, as the combination of four stars and the coat of arms of the presidential seal was indicative of higher rank.

Roosevelt persisted, and in March sent a query to Commodore Byron McCandless, then commanding the Naval Repair Base in San Diego, California. Roosevelt died on April 12, before McCandless could reply, but Harry Truman expressed a continuing interest in the matter and eventually a long reply was sent. McCandless recommended changing the four stars such that they were each made of 12 small stars, arranged in the shape of a larger six-pointed star; the four large stars would represent Roosevelt&#x27;s Four Freedoms, the 48 total stars would represent the states, and the six-pointed star would be representative of the president&#x27;s rank above five-star generals and admirals. Truman however disliked the idea of representing relative rank, and instead decided on a simple circle of 48 stars.

The proposed design was sent to the War and Navy Departments for comment. In a memorandum dated August 22, 1945 Arthur E. DuBois, the chief of the Heraldic Section of the Army&#x27;s Office of the Quartermaster General (forerunner to the Army Institute of Heraldry), made several suggestions. He recommended making the eagle in full color per heraldic tradition (the presidential flag of the time depicted the eagle as entirely white), and recommended against using 48 stars, believing that flags and seals should not be subject to external changes such as adding additional states and instead suggested a ring of 13 stars. DuBois also noted that the seal had never had an official definition, meaning there was also no explanation for the eagle facing to its left instead of the typical heraldic custom of having such figures face to their right (&quot;dexter&quot;), which is considered the honorable side. Therefore, he recommended changing the direction the eagle faced, and provided an illustration along with a suggested blazon to be used in an official description. Truman agreed with most of these suggestions, additionally liking that the eagle would now face towards the olive branches (which he felt was symbolic of a nation on the march and dedicated to peace,), but decided to keep the 48 stars. Truman also considered adding a lightning effect to the arrows as a reference to the atomic bomb, but later decided against it. On August 28 Truman had DuBois make a model containing all the final decisions, which was then approved.

On October 25, 1945, President Truman issued , which officially defined the presidential coat of arms and seal for the first time, and unified the design between the seal and the flag. The only changes since have been to add stars to the outer circle.

The actual die of the new seal was first used on December 5, 1945.

===The 1959 and 1960 changes===

Alaska was admitted as the 49th state on January 3, 1959, causing the 49th star to be added to the United States flag on the following July 4. On May 26, Dwight Eisenhower issued , which added a 49th star to the outer ring on the presidential coat of arms (and therefore the seal and flag as well), also effective on July 4. The order was otherwise identical to Truman&#x27;s order, which it replaced. Hawaii was admitted as the 50th state on August 21, 1959, and Eisenhower duly issued on February 5, 1960 (effective July 4, 1960) to add the 50th star to the coat of arms. Once again, it was identical to the previous orders other than the number of stars. This remains the official definition today.

Because the upcoming admission of Hawaii would cause a further change the following year, no seal dies were made in 1959 with 49 stars, and the 1945 dies continued in use. New dies with 50 stars were made by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing only after the 1960 executive order came into effect.

==Misconception==
A popular but erroneous myth is that the seal is changed during times of war, so that the eagle faces the arrows in its left talon. This belief may have arisen because major changes to the seal have coincidentally been made before or after wars – specifically, the 1945 change in the seal, and also the 1916 change in the &quot;flag&quot; (though not the seal) from the right-facing Great Seal to the left-facing presidential seal.

This misconception may also have arisen from a comment made by Winston Churchill, who, regarding Truman&#x27;s redesign of the seal, joked: &quot;Mr. President, with the greatest respect, I would prefer the American eagle&#x27;s neck to be on a swivel so that it could face the olive branches or the arrows, as the occasion might demand&quot;!

The belief is perpetuated by a 2000 episode of &quot;The West Wing&quot; entitled &quot;What Kind of Day Has It Been?&quot;. Character Admiral Fitzwallace, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, notes that the presidential seal in the center of the Oval Office carpet contains a shield bearing a bald eagle clutching the olive branch in its right talons and arrows in its left. The eagle&#x27;s head is turned toward the olive branch. Fitzwallace alleges that in times of war the seal is replaced with one in which the eagle&#x27;s head is turned toward the arrows.

Similarly, the Dan Brown novel &quot;Deception Point&quot; (2001) includes a passage implying that the seal embroidered on the carpet in the Oval Office is switched by White House workers. The novel states that an alternative carpet is stored in the basement, and the workers make the change overnight when no one notices.
In the 2007 film &quot;National Treasure: Book of Secrets&quot;, there is a variation of the presidential seal that shows the eagle clutching a scroll. This variation is supposed to represent the secret book that is passed down from president to president and contains the country&#x27;s secrets.

==Popular culture==
The seal is sometimes used in modified form as a marketing tool, or to make a political statement. The punk rock group the Ramones used a personal variation of the seal as their logo, replacing the arrows with a baseball bat and the inscription around it with the members&#x27; names, and also changing the motto and the design on the shield. Blink-182 and other bands have also used the logo on T-shirts. Some fashion brands (mainly for teenagers) have also used the logo as an added design for accessories like bags. In addition, the animated menu sequence on all DVDs of &quot;The West Wing&quot; contains a slightly altered version of the seal (40 stars, added country name, segmented ribbon). In the backing video for Skinny Puppy&#x27;s &quot;VX Gas Attack&quot;, featured on the &quot;Greater Wrong of the Right LIVE&quot; DVD, another altered version of the seal is shown (the olive and arrows replaced with bleeding gas nozzles, and the eagle replaced with a skull). It is also used by rap group The Diplomats as their trademark logo, except that the olive branch and arrows are usually replaced by two guns and the word &quot;Diplomats&quot; is across the center of the eagle. In the video game &quot;Metal Wolf Chaos&quot;, the titular powered armor is piloted by President Michael Wilson, the protagonist, and is adorned with large images of the seal, although modified from the real-life version.

==2019 trolling incident==

On July 23, 2019, President Donald Trump, the forty-fifth president, gave an address to young Republicans at the Turning Point USA Teen Student Action Summit 2019 in front of a screen onto which a spoof caricature of the seal was projected. The graphic was switched after 80 seconds. At the time, no one from the White House, the hosting facility, the hosting organization, or the summit organizers appeared to have been aware of the substitution. The story was reported by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; on July 24, including photos and video of Trump speaking in front of the fake seal. Turning Point USA later blamed an audio-visual employee for the gaffe.

The &quot;faux seal&quot; showed a double-headed eagle, in the tradition of the Russian state (suggestive of Russian interference in U.S. politics). In one claw the arrows had been replaced with golf clubs (representing the president&#x27;s connection to the sport), while the other held a wad of green banknotes. The chief of the shield bore five white hammer-and-sickle devices; and the motto &quot;E pluribus unum&quot; had been replaced by the phrase , Spanish for &quot;Number 45 is a puppet&quot;.

The graphic had been designed and marketed in 2016 as a joke by Charles Leazott, a disillusioned Republican who opposed President Trump. He later commented that the unidentified perpetrator was &quot;either wildly incompetent or the best troll ever. Either way, I love them.&quot; He subsequently displayed an image of Trump speaking before his seal design on the site for his related products.

<doc id="904773" wikidata="Q2997624" url="?curid=904773" title="Corolla, North Carolina">
<text>Corolla ( ) is an unincorporated community located in Poplar Branch township, Currituck County, North Carolina, United States, along the northern Outer Banks. It has a permanent population of approximately 500 people; during the summer vacation season, the population surges into the thousands. Corolla is home to the Currituck Beach Lighthouse, one of the seven North Carolina coastal lighthouses.

Previously a quiet and little-known location, a development boom in the 1980s sparked growth in the area, and since then, Corolla has become a popular vacation destination. Resting between the Currituck Sound and the Atlantic Ocean, Corolla attracts mainly beach-goers, especially in the summer months. Corolla is home to numerous attractions such as the historic Whalehead Club, Currituck Beach Light, Center for Wildlife Education, and is known for its numerous locations for shopping, dining, and participating in water sports.

Corolla is home to a herd of feral Banker horses. They are located on a 12,000-acre (49 km) animal sanctuary situated north of the populated areas of Corolla. Over fifty thousand people come to see these wild horses every week in the summer months.

==Pronunciation==

Named for the collection of petals of a flower, the correct pronunciation has an emphasis on the second syllable, &quot;rah&quot; (kuh-RAH-luh, /kəˈrɑːlə/); however, many visitors incorrectly pronounce &quot;Corolla&quot; the same way they pronounce the name of the Toyota Corolla, with the second syllable sounding like &quot;row&quot; (kuh-ROW-luh, /kəˈroʊlə/).

== Corolla Demographics ==
Corolla is a diverse place, with its native residents describing themselves as belonging to various ethnic groups. The greatest number among them are white, followed by African Americans. Significant ancestries of people in Corolla include English, German, Italian, and Polish. The principal language spoken is English, but Spanish and Italian are other popular languages. Per capita income in Corolla is $48,670. 52.80% of the adult population has a four-year degree or equivalent, while in other parts of the United States the average is 21.84%.

==Parks and nature preserves==

Corolla is home to the Outer Banks Center for Wildlife Education, located in Currituck Heritage Park. The park has a boardwalk through wetlands. It is listed as an eBird hotspot, with at least 219 species recorded in the park since 2000. Less than a mile north of Corolla is the Currituck Banks North Carolina National Estuarine Research Reserve.

==History==

The community of Corolla began as a European development on American Indian hunting grounds. Tribes including the Chowanoke and Poteskeet hunted along the barrier island.

The town of Corolla was first called Jones Hill, after an early settler. It was also known as Whalehead or Currituck Beach. Early settlers made a living from fishing and hunting, as well as from salvage from shipwrecks and serving as guides to hunters.

Currituck was derived from an American Indian term, &quot;Carotank&quot;, meaning land of the wild geese. On the Atlantic migratory flyway, the area at the time had a large wild geese population. Over hunting in the late 19th century caused numbers to severely drop.

The town officially took the name Corolla in 1895 when a post office opened in the community. The name was chosen to refer to the botanic term for the petals of a flower. It wasn&#x27;t until 1905 however, that a teacher and curriculum were provided to the local school.

Development of Currituck&#x27;s Northern Outer Banks began in 1967 when investors from Sandbridge, Virginia, put together an investment group to purchase undeveloped land. The first subdivision plotted was Carova with 1,993 lots. The lots were originally priced in the early 1970s at $8,000; as of 2006, some of these lots are worth up to $500,000.

The investors planned for a road to come through from Virginia Beach, Virginia, to allow access to the lots; however, these plans were abandoned in 1973 when the Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge south of Sandbridge was closed to all vehicular traffic, except by permit. Development pushed south through the 1970s, creating well over 1,000 additional lots in several subdivisions. In 1984 the residents of Corolla succeeded in their attempts to gain a public access road from the south. The state began paving the extension of NC-12 toward the north.

In addition to the Currituck Beach Light, the Currituck Shooting Club and Whalehead Club are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Beaches of Corolla ==
There are 15 beaches with public access, of which six have lifeguards and public parking and two include showers:
* Corolla Village Road (shower, bathhouse)
* Shad Street
* Sturgeon Walkway
* Bonito Street
* Sailfish Walkway
* Yaupon Lane (shower, bathhouse)

==Climate==

According to the Köppen climate classification, Corolla has a Humid subtropical climate (Cfa).

==Ecology==

According to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, Corolla, North Carolina would have a dominant vegetation type of Northern Cordgrass (&quot;73&quot;) with a dominant vegetation form of Coastal plain (&quot;20&quot;).

<text>Rodanthe ( ) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located in Dare County, North Carolina, United States, on Hatteras Island, part of North Carolina&#x27;s Outer Banks. As of the 2020 census it had a population of 213. Rodanthe, along with Waves and Salvo, are part of the settlement of Chicamacomico. Rodanthe includes the original Chicamacomico Life-Saving Station, decommissioned in 1954, but now a museum.

Rodanthe is served by North Carolina Highway 12, which runs north–south through town. The Chicamacomico area is bordered to the north by Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge and to the south by Cape Hatteras National Seashore, a situation which limits potential growth. The town is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east and Pamlico Sound to the west.

Rodanthe is the easternmost point of North Carolina. It is famous for its observation of &quot;Old Christmas&quot; on January 6, formerly Christmas, December 25, by the Julian Calendar, a custom held over from the original settlers who still used the &quot;Old Style&quot; calendar. A mythical beast, &quot;Old Buck&quot;—possibly related to Belsnickel or Krampus who are companions of Saint Nicholas in Christmas festivities—is said to appear at the celebration. 

The residents of Rodanthe are governed by the Dare County Board of Commissioners. Rodanthe is part of District 4, along with Avon, Buxton, Frisco, Hatteras, Waves and Salvo.

The Chicamacomico Life Saving Station and Oregon Inlet Station are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Demographics ==
===2020 census===

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 213 people, 81 households, and 44 families residing in the CDP.

==Tourist economy==

Many of Rodanthe&#x27;s restaurants, shops and markets are seasonal, closing during the winter months and reopening the following spring. Many of these are family-owned, rather than chain franchises. Provisions can still be purchased on the Outer Banks during the winter months, but a short drive south to the town of Avon or north to Nags Head is required.

There are two motels within the larger settlement of Chicamacomico, plus three other inns or bed and breakfasts on the island of Hatteras. There are numerous rental houses, as well as numerous campgrounds. Several smaller campgrounds cater to water sports enthusiasts. Local water sports include fishing, kayaking (both ocean and sound-side), swimming, sailboarding, surfing, kiteboarding, and wreck diving.

==Climate==
According to the Trewartha climate classification system, Rodanthe, North Carolina, has a humid subtropical climate with hot and humid summers, cool winters and year-around precipitation (&quot;Cfak&quot;). Cfak climates are characterized by all months having an average mean temperature &gt; 32.0 °F (&gt; 0.0 °C), at least eight months with an average mean temperature ≥ 50.0 °F (≥ 10.0 °C), at least one month with an average mean temperature ≥ 71.6 °F (≥ 22.0 °C) and no significant precipitation difference between seasons. During the summer months in Rodanthe, a sea breeze is present on most days, but episodes of extreme heat and humidity can occur with heat index values ≥ 100 °F (≥ 38 °C). Rodanthe is prone to hurricane strikes, particularly during the Atlantic hurricane season which extends from June 1 through November 30, sharply peaking from late August through September. During the winter months, episodes of cold and wind can occur with wind chill values &lt; 10 °F (&lt; −12 °C). The plant hardiness zone in Rodanthe is 8b with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of 16.9 °F (−8.4 °C). The average seasonal (Dec-Mar) snowfall total is &lt; 2 inches (&lt; 5 cm), and the average annual peak in nor&#x27;easter activity is in February.
 


==Ecology==
According to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, Rodanthe would have a dominant vegetation type of live oak/sea oats &quot;Uniola paniculata&quot; (&quot;90&quot;) with a dominant vegetation form of Coastal Prairie (&quot;20&quot;).

==Education==

==In popular culture==
===&quot;Nights in Rodanthe&quot;===

In 2002, Nicholas Sparks published the book &quot;Nights in Rodanthe&quot;, a romance novel about two visitors to Rodanthe. George C. Wolfe directed a film adaptation of the same name, which was partially filmed in the town of Rodanthe and entirely filmed in eastern North Carolina – including Cape Hatteras, Southport and Wilmington. The movie was released on September 26, 2008. Several Rodanthe landmarks such as the Rodanthe Pier were used during filming. During film production, one of the rental houses, &quot;Serendipity&quot;, the northeasternmost house in Rodanthe, was transformed into the fictional &quot;Inn at Rodanthe&quot;. In November 2009, the house was damaged and declared a public nuisance by Dare County after a nor&#x27;easter storm. The house was saved from demolition by a private businessman, Ben Huss, a bail bondsman, from Newton, North Carolina. Threatened by erosion, the house was moved less than one mile south. The interior and exterior of the property were meticulously renovated to replicate the house presented in the film. Now a vacation rental, the Inn at Rodanthe has become a popular Outer Banks attraction and is booked year-round.

<text>Waves is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Dare County, North Carolina, United States. It is on Hatteras Island, part of North Carolina&#x27;s Outer Banks. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 134. Waves, along with Rodanthe and Salvo, are part of the settlement of Chicamacomico.

The residents of Waves are governed by the Dare County Board of Commissioners. Waves is part of District 4, along with Avon, Buxton, Frisco, Hatteras, Rodanthe and Salvo.

== Demographics ==
===2020 census===

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 172 people, 24 households, and 13 families residing in the CDP.

==History==
The community was so named on account of waves at the beach.

The Rasmus Midgett House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.

==Boundaries==
The northern border of Waves is generally considered to be the ditch that runs under Highway 12 just south of Resort Rodanthe Drive. The southern border, separating Waves and Salvo, is more ambiguous. Long-time residents indicate various &quot;official lines&quot; separating the two. Formerly Rodanthe, Waves and Salvo were each served by their own post office. Today a single post office, located in Waves, serves the entire community and the former lines that separated the communities have become blurred.
==Economy==
The Waves area is dominated by campgrounds both large and small as well as numerous rental houses.

==Climate==

According to the Trewartha climate classification system, Waves, North Carolina has a humid subtropical climate with hot and humid summers, cool winters and year-around precipitation (&quot;Cfak&quot;). Cfak climates are characterized by all months having an average mean temperature &gt; 32.0 °F (&gt; 0.0 °C), at least eight months with an average mean temperature ≥ 50.0 °F (≥ 10.0 °C), at least one month with an average mean temperature ≥ 71.6 °F (≥ 22.0 °C) and no significant precipitation difference between seasons. During the summer months in Waves, a cooling afternoon sea breeze is present on most days, but episodes of extreme heat and humidity can occur with heat index values ≥ 100 °F (≥ 38 °C). Waves is prone to hurricane strikes, particularly during the Atlantic hurricane season which extends from June 1 through November 30, sharply peaking from late August through September. During the winter months, episodes of cold and wind can occur with wind chill values &lt; 10 °F (&lt; -12 °C). The plant hardiness zone in Waves is 8b with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of 17.2 °F (-8.2 °C). The average seasonal (Dec-Mar) snowfall total is &lt; 2 inches (&lt; 5 cm), and the average annual peak in nor&#x27;easter activity is in February.

<doc id="904780" wikidata="Q3473969" url="?curid=904780" title="Salvo, North Carolina">
<text>Salvo is a census-designated place located in Dare County, North Carolina, United States, on Hatteras Island, part of North Carolina&#x27;s Outer Banks. As of the 2010 census, Salvo had a population of 229. Originally (with Rodanthe and Waves) part of the settlement of Chicamacomico, Salvo was originally known as &quot;Clarks&quot; or &quot;Clarksville.&quot;

The name &quot;Salvo&quot; allegedly stems from the American Civil War, during which a passing Union vessel spotted the settlement, which was not marked on their maps. The commanding officer ordered an attack, and a sailor marked the site on his map with the word &quot;Salvo.&quot; The name was formally given to the town when it received a post office in 1901. The Salvo post office, ZIP code 27972, one of the smallest postal facilities in the United States, was damaged by an arsonist in 1992. A new post office was constructed later in the decade for all of Chicamacomico. Hurricane Irene in August 2011 damaged much of the Outer Banks area including Salvo.

The residents of Salvo are governed by the Dare County Board of Commissioners. Salvo is part of District 4, along with Avon, Buxton, Frisco, Hatteras, Rodanthe and Waves.

On June 24, 2014, a Virginia vacationer became buried alive in beach sand when trying to dig a tunnel, and then died.

Salvo Post Office was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.

<text>Sterling Price Newberry (August 10, 1915 – January 28, 2017) was an American inventor and microscopist. He was born in Springfield, Missouri. Newberry invented the shadow X-ray microscope and was one of the founders of the Microscopy Society of America. He turned 100 in August 2015 and died in January 2017 at the age of 101.

The first X-ray microscopes had used grazing off lenses at a very low angle to focus X-ray images. The images, however, were blurry from diffraction. While working on an alternate approach for General Electric, a technician came to him with a badge. The technician did not believe there were X-Rays in the machine, he had taken his warning badge, with X-ray film, and placed a bit of screen wire on it. He pulled the badge out and saw the exposed screen wire pattern on it. He also saw another screen wire pattern, however, far smaller and finer. Newberry recognized that the fine pattern was the screen wire mounting for the specimen, but it was 400-to-the-inch wire and it had been magnified by expansion of the shadow. This gave him the insight he needed to create a working commercial microscope, placing the specimen very close to a point source of X-rays and then further back a photographic plate. The &quot;shadow&quot; of the specimen would be under-exposed, that is X-ray dark, on the plate. This process is similar to medical X-rays, except that the microscope uses a point source for clarity whereas a medical x-ray tends to use a much larger x-ray source to avoid distortion.

<text>Esmé William Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Penrith (15 September 1863 – 1 August 1939), was a British diplomat who was British Ambassador to the United States between 1924 and 1930. He was one of Britain&#x27;s most influential diplomats of the early part of the twentieth century. With a gift for languages and a skilled diplomat, Howard is described by his biographer as an integral member of the small group of men who made and implemented British foreign policy between 1900 and 1930, a critical transitional period in Britain&#x27;s history as a world power.

==Early life==
Howard was born on 15 September 1863 at Greystoke Castle, near Penrith, Cumbria. He was the youngest son of the former Charlotte Caroline Georgina Long and Henry Howard, an MP for Steyning and New Shoreham. He was the nephew of Henrietta Anna Molyneux-Howard, wife of Henry Herbert, 3rd Earl of Carnarvon. His elder brothers were Henry Howard, later an MP for Penrith, and Sir Stafford Howard, later an MP for Thornbury and Cumberland East who served as Under-Secretary of State for India in 1886.

His paternal grandfather was Lord Henry Howard-Molyneux-Howard, the younger brother of Bernard Howard, 12th Duke of Norfolk. His maternal grandparents were Henry Lawes Long and Lady Catharine Long (a daughter of Horatio Walpole, 2nd Earl of Orford, and sister of Horatio Walpole, 3rd Earl of Orford).

Howard was educated at Harrow School.

==Career==
In 1885, he passed the Diplomatic Service examination, and was assistant private secretary to the Earl of Carnarvon as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland before being attached to the British Embassy in Rome. In 1888, he arrived in Berlin as the embassy&#x27;s third secretary, and after retiring from the Diplomatic Service four years later, he was made assistant private secretary to the Earl of Kimberley, the Foreign Secretary at the time. Howard was a talented linguist who would spoke 10 languages and chose to retire from the diplomatic service in 1890 out of boredom. For the next 13 years, Howard lived a life of irregular employment, spending his time prospecting for gold in South Africa, working as a researcher for the social reformer Charles Booth, making two lengthy trips to Morocco, working as the private secretary to Lord Kimberley in 1894–1895, frequently visiting his sister at her estate in Italy and running unsuccessfully as a Liberal candidate in the 1892 election.

Greatly concerned with social problems, Howard had developed in the 1890s his &quot;Economic Credo&quot; about &quot;co-partnership&quot; under which he envisioned the state, businesses and unions working together for the improvement of the working classes. Alongside his &quot;Economic Credo&quot;, Howard believed in &quot;Imperial Federation&quot; under which Great Britain would be united in a federation that would take in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Newfoundland, and South Africa. In 1897, Howard set up a rubber plantation in Tobago, which was partly intended to finance a &quot;co-partnership&quot; business in Britain and partly to demonstrate to the British working class how the British empire benefited them financially. Howard came from a cadet branch of one of the most famous Roman Catholic aristocratic families in England, but his grandfather had converted to the Church of England and Howard had been raised as an Anglican. In 1898, Howard converted to Roman Catholicism to marry the Countess Isabella Giustiniani-Bandini, who came from a &quot;black&quot; Italian aristocratic family who supported the Papacy in its refusal to recognize the Italian state, unlike the &quot;white&quot; aristocrats who supported the Italian crown against the Catholic Church. In 1903, following the failure of his rubber plantation together with a lack of public interest in his &quot;Economic Credo&quot; led to Howard rejoining the Diplomatic Service.

Having fought in the Second Boer War with the Imperial Yeomanry, Howard became Consul General for Crete in 1903, and three years later was sent to Washington as a counsellor at the embassy there. Esme Howard was married to Isabella Giovanna Teresa Gioachina Giustiniani-Bandini of Venice. In 1906, the Liberals won the general election and Howard&#x27;s old friend whom he had known since 1894, Sir Edward Grey became Foreign Secretary, which greatly benefited his career. In 1908, he was appointed in the same role to Vienna, and that same year became Consul General at Budapest. Three years later, Howard was made Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Swiss Confederation, and in 1913 he was transferred to Stockholm, where he spent the whole of the First World War. During World War I, Sweden leaned in a pro-German neutrality and Howard&#x27;s time as the British minister in Stockholm was a difficult one with the Swedish leaders openly expressing their hopes for a German victory. In an attempt to counter-act the pro-German sympathies of the Swedish elite, Howard sought to broaden his social contacts in Sweden, meeting with journalists, union leaders, businessmen, academics, clergymen, soldiers, and any local anglophiles in order to explain to them the British viewpoint. In 1916, having already been appointed CMG and CVO ten years earlier, he was knighted as KCMG, becoming KCB three years later.

In 1919, Sir Esmé Howard was attached to the British delegation during the Paris Peace Conference, also being made British Civil Delegate on the International Commission to Poland. At the Paris Peace Conference, Howard was assigned to drafting sections of the Treaty of Versailles dealing with Poland. That same year, he was sent to Madrid as ambassador there, arriving in August 1919. Being appointed ambassador to Spain was a major step up in the Foreign Office, but Howard knew that Spanish issues were for the most part secondary to Lord Curzon, the Foreign Secretary. In Howard&#x27;s first annual summary as an ambassador from Madrid, Howard wrote: &quot;In the first survey of the situation which I wrote after my arrival in this country I drew attention to three dominant factors in the state of affairs then existing: the activities of the &quot;juntas&quot;, the labor unrest and the bankruptcy of parliamentary institutions. These elements were perhaps not so immediately threatening as they then seemed but they are still elements of mischief&quot;.

Howard reported that the Spanish economy which depended upon exports of raw materials was collapsing due to the fall in commodity prices, that the politicians were incapable of providing leadership and King Alfonso XIII was not behaving as a constitutional monarch with the king trying to rule by intriguing with various politicians and generals instead of reigning. Howard reported that in 1920 Spain had 1,060 strikes, and predicted that 1921 seemed likely to surpass that record. Through Howard reported almost weekly bombings, assassinations and other &quot;outrages&quot; committed by extreme left-wing groups, in the main he blamed the confrontational relations between unions and businesses on the management, reporting that most Spanish corporations had little interest in compromise. On 9 July 1920, the miners working for the British Rio Tinto company went on strike. Howard&#x27;s dispatches to London stating that the attitude of Walter Browning, Rio Tinto&#x27;s manager in Spain, was harming Britain&#x27;s image in Spain, led to the Foreign Office discreetly pressuring the CEO of the Rio Tinto company, Lord Denbigh, to settle the strike. Much to Howard&#x27;s satisfaction, the strike was ended in early 1921 with the Rio Tinto company giving wage increases to their Spanish miners. In a sort of goodwill tour, Howard visited the Basque country in November 1920 where he toured mines, shipyards and foundries owned by British companies in an attempt to improve the British image with the Basque working class.

In 1921, Howard had to play detective to find out the truth about reports about a major Spanish military disaster in the Rif mountains of Morocco. After two weeks of seeking the truth, Howard reported to London that the Spanish defeat at the Battle of the Annual had been &quot;decisive&quot; and warned that the &quot;Disaster of the Annual&quot; as the battle was known in Spain had plunged the country into a crisis. Howard reported that much fighting and huge expenditure of money that almost everything the Spanish had won in the Rif over the years had been lost in a matter of weeks and that the Spanish had been driven back in disorder to two coastal enclaves. Howard predicated that the &quot;Disaster of the Annual&quot; would lead to &quot;the growth of a chauvinistic Pan-Islamic movement&quot; in North Africa and that the French would intervene rather than see their own position threatened in Algeria and French Morocco. As the British did not wish for the French to control all of Morocco, Howard was ordered to see if it was possible if somehow the Spanish might rescue themselves from the war that they were losing in the Rif without the help of the French. Howard wrote that in the aftermath of the &quot;Disaster of the Annual&quot;, the Spanish people were obsessed with finding out who had sent General Manuel Fernández Silvestre into his ill-fated drive into the Rif and growing evidence was emerging that the King Alfonso had given the orders, predicating the future of the Spanish monarchy was at stake. Howard described Spain&#x27;s colonial rule in Morocco as &quot;a byword for cruelty, incompetence and corruption&quot;, but argued Britain had never let moral factors interfere &quot;for the sake of larger and wider purposes of Policy&quot;, giving the example of British support for the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century despite the mistreatment of Christians in the Balkans. Howard argued that the main concern for Britain was preventing France from expanding its influence in Morocco, which meant that Britain should support Spain wholeheartedly in the Rif war.

In 1922, Howard suggested that to improve the image of Britain in Spain that several British intellectuals visit that country to give talks that might about the needed change in public relations and shortly afterwards, Hilaire Belloc visited Madrid to speak about Anglo-Spanish relations. To formalize these exchanges, Howard together with the Duke of Alba founded the English Committee in Spain, which arranged for university students in both countries to take exchange courses and for various British intellectuals to undertake lecture tours in Spain. In another initiative to improve Britain&#x27;s image in Spain, Howard with the British-born Queen Victoria Eugenia established a relief fund for Spanish soldiers wounded in Morocco. In the immediate post-war period, British decision-makers viewed France as too powerful and wanted a stronger Spain to check French power in the Mediterranean, and for this reason Howard welcomed the coup d&#x27;état of General Miguel Primo de Rivera in September 1923 as a force for order in Spain. Through Howard initially distrusted Primo de Rivera because of his stance on the Gibraltar issue, he quickly found from his discussions with Primo de Rivera that his main concern was winning the Rif war and he wanted British support for Spanish claims in Morocco against the French.

In 1924, Howard returned to Washington as ambassador. Puzzled at first by the provincial background and eccentric style of President Calvin Coolidge, Howard came to like and trust the president, realizing that he was conciliatory and eager to find solutions to mutual problems, such as the Liquor Treaty of 1924 which diminished friction over smuggling. Washington was greatly pleased when Britain ended its alliance with Japan. Both nations were pleased when in 1923 the wartime debt problem was compromised on satisfactory terms.

Appointed GCMG and GCB in 1923 and 1928 respectively, he was created, on his retirement in 1930, Baron Howard of Penrith, of Gowbarrow in the historic county of Cumberland. He died nine years later aged 75.

==Personal life==
He married Lady Isabella Giustiniani-Bandini (daughter of the 8th Earl of Newburgh), of a branch of the Giustiniani family, by whom he had five sons, including:

* Francis Howard, 2nd Baron Howard of Penrith (1905–1999)
* Hon. Hubert John Edward Dominic Howard (1907–1987), who married Lelia Calista Ada Caetani (1913–1977), a daughter of Marguerite Caetani and Roffredo Caetani, Prince of Bassiano and last Duke of Sermoneta.
* Hon. Henry Anthony Camillo Howard (1913–1977), who was a journalist, military officer, and colonial leader in the Caribbean.

Lord Howard died on 1 August 1939.

<doc id="904791" wikidata="Q10340884" url="?curid=904791" title="On a Clear Day You Can See Forever">
<text>On a Clear Day You Can See Forever is a musical with music by Burton Lane and a book and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner based loosely on &quot;Berkeley Square&quot;, written in 1926 by John L. Balderston. It concerns a woman who has ESP and has been reincarnated. The musical received three Tony Award nominations.

==Productions==
The Broadway production opened at the Mark Hellinger Theatre on October 17, 1965, and closed on June 11, 1966, after 280 performances and 3 previews. The production was directed by Robert Lewis, choreographed by Herbert Ross, and starred Barbara Harris as Daisy Gamble/Melinda, John Cullum as Dr. Mark Bruckner, Clifford David as Edward Moncrief, Titos Vandis as Themistocles Kriakos, and William Daniels (Harris&#x27;s co-star in &quot;A Thousand Clowns&quot;) as Warren Smith. Louis Jourdan was the original leading man when the show had its tryout at the Colonial Theatre in Boston but was replaced by Cullum before it reached Broadway. Scenic design was by Oliver Smith and costume design was by Freddy Wittop.

The show was not well received. Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; recalled: &quot;Its book was strained and muddled, most critics agreed; its big production numbers were simply cumbersome. But it did have [a] lushly melodic score...&quot; Tours followed, starring such diverse actress-singers as Tammy Grimes, Linda Lavin, and Nancy Dussault as Daisy/Melinda.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the show was budgeted at $600,000, with NBC supplying $150,000 and RCA $60,000. Operating cost per week was said to be $55,000-60,000 at a time when a big musical’s typical weekly cost was about $45,000.

A 1970 film adaptation directed by Vincente Minnelli starred Barbra Streisand, Yves Montand, Bob Newhart and Jack Nicholson.

In February 2000, the New York City Center Encores! series presented a staged concert starring Kristin Chenoweth as Daisy/Melinda and Peter Friedman as Dr. Bruckner. The show premiered in London in 2000 at the Bridewell Theatre.

A revised Broadway production began previews on November 12, 2011, at the St. James Theatre and opened on December 11, 2011, directed by Michael Mayer and with a new book by Peter Parnell. Harry Connick Jr. starred as Dr. Mark Bruckner. The cast included Jessie Mueller as Melinda and David Turner as David Gamble. The revised version, which had a developmental workshop at The Vineyard Theatre in the fall of 2009 and had readings in August 2010 at the Powerhouse Theater at Vassar College, departed from the plot of the original. The patient is now a gay florist David (Turner) who was a female jazz singer Melinda (Mueller) in a former life, and who falls in love with his psychiatrist, widower Dr. Mark Bruckner (Connick). The Vassar concert mixed &quot;material from the stage and film versions and eliminates overstuffed 1960s-style production numbers.&quot; This production closed on January 29, 2012, after 29 previews and 57 performances.

&quot;On A Clear Day You Can See Forever&quot; was revived at the Union Theatre in London starring Vicki Lee Taylor as Daisy Gamble and Nadeem Crowe as Dr. Mark Bruckner. The production was directed by Kirk Jameson and opened to rave reviews with the run ending on 28 September 2013.

The 2011 revised Broadway version was revived at The New Conservatory Theater Center in San Francisco, California starring Chris Morell as David Gamble, Melissa O&#x27;Keefe as Melinda Wells, and popular local actor William Giammona as Dr. Mark Bruckner. The production was directed by Artistic director and founder, Ed Decker, with musical direction by Matthew Lee Cannon, choreography by Jayne Zaban and new instrumental arrangements by Ben Prince. It opened May 21, 2016.

Porchlight Music Theatre presented this show as a part of their &quot;Porchlight Revisits&quot; season where they stage three forgotten musicals per year. This production was performed in Chicago, Illinois in May 2017. It was directed by Lili-Anne Brown.

Tony Award-nominee Melissa Errico starred in a 2018 Off-Broadway revival in New York City with Irish Repertory Theatre; she also wrote about the musical in an inquiry about gender politics in theater for &quot;The New York Times&quot; that summer.

==Synopsis==
;Act I
Quirky Daisy Gamble sees herself as an unremarkable person and has low self-esteem, even though she can (1) make plants grow remarkably, (2) predict when a telephone will ring or someone will drop in, and (3) tell where to find an object that someone else is looking for. Her current problem, though, is her nasty smoking habit, which will interfere with the chances of her fiancé, Warren, for a job with great benefits. She seeks help from a psychiatrist, Dr. Mark Bruckner, to stop smoking. When he hypnotizes her, she describes living a previous life in late 18th century England as &quot;Melinda Wells&quot;, who died in her late twenties from circumstances beyond her control. Free spirited Melinda was in love with portrait painter Edward Moncrief. Mark keeps to himself what Daisy has revealed to him, and he tells her that she should not be ashamed of her ESP.

At their next session, Daisy, under hypnosis, relates scenes from the salacious London Hellrakers&#x27; Club where Melinda met Edward. Melinda and Edward eventually marry, but the painter is unfaithful to her, making love to his subjects. Mark finds himself falling for &quot;Melinda&quot; and becomes convinced that Daisy is really the reincarnation of Melinda. Melinda finally leaves Edward and sets sail for America, but the ship never reaches Boston. Before Mark can save Melinda from shipwreck, Daisy wakes up.

;Act II
Mark reports on the case to his fellow psychiatrists, who ridicule his findings. Greek shipping magnate Themistocles Kriakos learns of Mark&#x27;s belief in reincarnation and offers to finance a study of the events of Melinda&#x27;s life in exchange for Mark&#x27;s help in discovering who he will be in his next life, which will allow him to leave his fortune to his future self. Daisy accidentally discovers that she is the &quot;Melinda&quot; at the center of the growing controversy and that Mark prefers Melinda to herself. In her angry confrontation with the psychiatrist about the matter, she tells him that she is &quot;through being a go-between for you and your dream girl. You&#x27;re not going to go on using my head for a motel.&quot;

Daisy goes to the airport, ready to return home. Her ESP powers warn her that the plane on which she plans to travel will crash. She realizes at last how special she really is. She leaves her starchy fiancé and she and Mark unite to explore their extraordinary future.

==Versions==
The musical is available in at least two noticeably different published versions (aside from the film version), although the basic plot-line remains the same. The first version was published in 1966. The musical numbers recorded in the original Broadway cast album of 1965 correspond to this version.

A second version is evident in the piano-vocal score published in 1967. Here several vocal numbers from the above version are missing (&quot;Ring Out the Bells,&quot; &quot;Tosy and Cosh&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Tamper with my Sister&quot;), as is the introduction to the song &quot;Hurry, It&#x27;s Lovely Up Here,&quot; which is recorded on the cast album. Also, the Greek millionaire&#x27;s solo, &quot;When I&#x27;m Being Born Again&quot; is given completely different lyrics (&quot;When I Come Around Again&quot;) and sung instead by Daisy&#x27;s friends. The overture recorded on the cast album combines the &quot;overture&quot; and &quot;entr&#x27;acte&quot; printed in the vocal score.

The 1970 film version departed from the musical significantly, adding a character for Jack Nicholson (an ex-stepbrother named Tad Pringle), and changing details of other characters, moving the period of Melinda&#x27;s life ahead by a decade or two (into the early 19th century), removing several songs, changing lyrics and adding two new songs.

Note: In the piano-vocal score, a song appears that was not included in the original Broadway production: &quot;The Solicitor&#x27;s Song&quot;, during Daisy&#x27;s first regression-scene. There was also a ballet in the first act of the original production, entitled &quot;At the Hellrakers&quot; and the song &quot;Ring Out the Bells&quot; that are not found on the original Broadway recording.

==Recordings==
The title song, first introduced by John Cullum in the 1965 musical, has been recorded by a number of artists, including Robert Goulet, Johnny Mathis, baseball pitcher Denny McLain, and Sergio Franchi on his 1976 albums &quot;TeleHouse Presents - Sergio Franchi&quot; (TeleHouse Records) and &quot;20 Magificent Songs&quot; (DynaHouse Records); Barbra Streisand, star of the 1970 film version, recorded the title song on the film&#x27;s soundtrack and has frequently included it in her concerts. Sammy Davis Jr. has also performed the title song live in concert, and Harry James released a version in 1967 on his album &quot;Our Leader!&quot; (Dot DLP 3801 and DLP 25801). In 2012, The Peddlers&#x27; 1968 jazz cover was used in season 5 episode 3 (&quot;Hazard Pay&quot;) of AMC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; over a montage of Walter White (Bryan Cranston) and Jesse Pinkman&#x27;s (Aaron Paul) meth manufacturing.

&quot;What Did I Have That I Don&#x27;t Have&quot; was covered with some success by Eydie Gorme and was also sung by Streisand on the soundtrack of the film version. &quot;Come Back to Me&quot; was recorded by swing revival band the Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies in 1994, which later appeared on their multi-platinum 1997 compilation &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; and was re-recorded for their 2014 Rat Pack tribute &quot;Please Return the Evening&quot;.

The title song is reminiscent of Maurice Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Dawn&quot; movement from his ballet &quot;Daphnis et Chloé&quot;.

<doc id="904792" wikidata="Q902794" url="?curid=904792" title="X-ray microscope">
<text>An X-ray microscope uses electromagnetic radiation in the X-ray band to produce magnified images of objects. Since X-rays penetrate most objects, there is no need to specially prepare them for X-ray microscopy observations.

Unlike visible light, X-rays do not reflect or refract easily and are invisible to the human eye. Therefore, an X-ray microscope exposes film or uses a charge-coupled device (CCD) detector to detect X-rays that pass through the specimen. It is a contrast imaging technology using the difference in absorption of soft X-rays in the water window region (wavelengths: 2.34–4.4 nm, energies: 280–530 eV) by the carbon atom (main element composing the living cell) and the oxygen atom (an element of water).

Microfocus X-ray also achieves high magnification by projection. A microfocus X-ray tube produces X-rays from an extremely small focal spot (5 μm down to 0.1 μm). The X-rays are in the more conventional X-ray range (20 to 300 keV) and are not re-focused.

== Invention and development ==
The history of X-ray microscopy can be traced back to the early 20th century. After the German physicist Röntgen discovered X-rays in 1895, scientists soon illuminated an object using an X-ray point source and captured the shadow images of the object with a resolution of several micrometers. In 1918, Einstein pointed out that the refractive index for X-rays in most mediums should be just slightly greater than 1, which means that refractive optical parts would be difficult to use for X-ray applications.

Early X-ray microscopes by Paul Kirkpatrick and Albert Baez used grazing-incidence reflective X-ray optics to focus the X-rays, which grazed X-rays off parabolic curved mirrors at a very high angle of incidence. An alternative method of focusing X-rays is to use a tiny Fresnel zone plate of concentric gold or nickel rings on a silicon dioxide substrate. Sir Lawrence Bragg produced some of the first usable X-ray images with his apparatus in the late 1940s.
In the 1950s Sterling Newberry produced a shadow X-ray microscope, which placed the specimen between the source and a target plate, this became the basis for the first commercial X-ray microscopes from the General Electric Company.

After a silent period in the 1960s, X-ray microscopy regained people&#x27;s attention in the 1970s. In 1972, Horowitz and Howell built the first synchrotron-based X-ray microscope at the Cambridge Electron Accelerator. This microscope scanned samples using synchrotron radiation from a tiny pinhole and showed the abilities of both transmission and fluorescence microscopy. Other developments in this period include the first holographic demonstration by Sadao Aoki and Seishi Kikuta in Japan, the first TXMs using zone plates by Schmahl et al., and Stony Brook&#x27;s experiments in STXM.

The uses of synchrotron light sources brought new possibilities for X-ray microscopy in the 1980s. However, as new synchrotron-source-based microscopes were built in many groups, people realized that it was difficult to perform such experiments due to insufficient technological capabilities at that time, such as poor coherent illuminations, poor-quality x-ray optical elements, and user-unfriendly light sources.

Entering the 1990s, new instruments and new light sources greatly fueled the improvement of X-ray microscopy. Microscopy methods including tomography, cryo-, and cryo-tomography were successfully demonstrated. With rapid development, X-ray microscopy found new applications in soil science, geochemistry, polymer sciences, and magnetism. The hardware was also miniaturized, so that researchers could perform experiments in their own laboratories.

Extremely high-intensity sources of 9.25 keV X-rays for X-ray phase-contrast microscopy, from a focal spot about 10 μm × 10 μm, may be obtained with a non-synchrotron X-ray source that uses a focused electron beam and a liquid-metal anode. This was demonstrated in 2003 and in 2017 was used to image mouse brain at a voxel size of about one cubic micrometer (see below).

With the applications continuing to grow, X-ray microscopy has become a routine, proven technique used in environmental and soil sciences, geo- and cosmo-chemistry, polymer sciences, biology, magnetism, material sciences. With this increasing demand for X-ray microscopy in these fields, microscopes based on synchrotron, liquid-metal anode, and other laboratory light sources are being built around the world. X-ray optics and components are also being commercialized rapidly.

==Instrumentation==
=== X-ray optics ===
=== Synchrotron light sources ===
==== Advanced Light Source ====
The Advanced Light Source (ALS) in Berkeley, California, is home to XM-1, a full-field soft X-ray microscope operated by the Center for X-ray Optics and dedicated to various applications in modern nanoscience, such as nanomagnetic materials, environmental and materials sciences and biology. XM-1 uses an X-ray lens to focus X-rays on a CCD, in a manner similar to an optical microscope. XM-1 held the world record in spatial resolution with Fresnel zone plates down to 15 nm and is able to combine high spatial resolution with a sub-100ps time resolution to study e.g. ultrafast spin dynamics. In July 2012, a group at DESY claimed a record spatial resolution of 10 nm, by using the hard X-ray scanning microscope at PETRA III.

The ALS is also home to the world&#x27;s first soft x-ray microscope designed for biological and biomedical research. This new instrument, XM-2 was designed and built by scientists from the National Center for X-ray Tomography. XM-2 is capable of producing 3-dimensional tomograms of cells.

=== Liquid-metal-anode X-ray source ===

Extremely high-intensity sources of 9.25 keV X-rays (gallium K-alpha line) for X-ray phase-contrast microscopy, from a focal spot about 10 um x 10 um, may be obtained with an X-ray source which uses a liquid metal galinstan anode. This was demonstrated in 2003. The metal flows from a nozzle downward at a high speed and the high intensity electron source is focused upon it. The rapid flow of metal carries current, but the physical flow prevents a great deal of anode heating (due to forced-convective heat removal), and the high boiling point of galinstan inhibits vaporization of the anode. The technique has been used to image mouse brain in three dimensions at a voxel size of about one cubic micrometer.

=== Detection devices ===
==Scanning transmission==
Sources of soft X-rays suitable for microscopy, such as synchrotron radiation sources, have fairly low brightness of the required wavelengths, so an alternative method of image formation is scanning transmission soft X-ray microscopy. Here the X-rays are focused to a point, and the sample is mechanically scanned through the produced focal spot. At each point the transmitted X-rays are recorded using a detector such as a proportional counter or an avalanche photodiode. This type of &quot;scanning transmission X-ray microscope&quot; (STXM) was first developed by researchers at Stony Brook University and was employed at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory.

==Resolution==
The resolution of X-ray microscopy lies between that of the optical microscope and the electron microscope. It has an advantage over conventional electron microscopy is that it can view biological samples in their natural state. Electron microscopy is widely used to obtain images with nanometer to sub-Angstrom level resolution but the relatively thick living cell cannot be observed as the sample has to be chemically fixed, dehydrated, embedded in resin, then sliced ultra thin. However, it should be mentioned that cryo-electron microscopy allows the observation of biological specimens in their hydrated natural state, albeit embedded in water ice. Until now, resolutions of 30 nanometer are possible using the Fresnel zone plate lens which forms the image using the soft x-rays emitted from a synchrotron. Recently, the use of soft x-rays emitted from laser-produced plasmas rather than synchrotron radiation is becoming more popular.

==Analysis==
Additionally, X-rays cause fluorescence in most materials, and these emissions can be analyzed to determine the chemical elements of an imaged object. Another use is to generate diffraction patterns, a process used in X-ray crystallography. By analyzing the internal reflections of a diffraction pattern (usually with a computer program), the three-dimensional structure of a crystal can be determined down to the placement of individual atoms within its molecules. X-ray microscopes are sometimes used for these analyses because the samples are too small to be analyzed in any other way.

== Biological applications ==
One early applications of X-ray microscopy in biology was contact imaging, pioneered by Goby in 1913. In this technique, soft x-rays irradiate a specimen and expose the x-ray sensitive emulsions beneath it. Then, magnified tomographic images of the emulsions, which correspond to the x-ray opacity maps of the specimen, are recorded using a light microscope or an electron microscope. A unique advantage that X-ray contact imaging offered over electron microscopy was the ability to image wet biological materials. Thus, it was used to study the micro and nanoscale structures of plants, insects, and human cells. However, several factors, including emulsion distortions, poor illumination conditions, and low resolutions of ways to examine the emulsions, limit the resolution of contacting imaging. Electron damage of the emulsions and diffraction effects can also result in artifacts in the final images.

X-ray microscopy has its unique advantages in terms of nanoscale resolution and high penetration ability, both of which are needed in biological studies. With the recent significant progress in instruments and focusing, the three classic forms of optics—diffractive, reflective, refractive optics—have all successfully expanded into the X-ray range and have been used to investigate the structures and dynamics at cellular and sub-cellular scales. In 2005, Shapiro et al. reported cellular imaging of yeasts at a 30 nm resolution using coherent soft X-ray diffraction microscopy. In 2008, X-ray imaging of an unstained virus was demonstrated. A year later, X-ray diffraction was further applied to visualize the three-dimensional structure of an unstained human chromosome. X-ray microscopy has thus shown its great ability to circumvent the diffractive limit of classic light microscopes; however, further enhancement of the resolution is limited by detector pixels, optical instruments, and source sizes.

A longstanding major concern of X-ray microscopy is radiation damage, as high energy X-rays produce strong radicals and trigger harmful reactions in wet specimens. As a result, biological samples are usually fixated or freeze-dried before being irradiated with high-power X-rays. Rapid cryo-treatments are also commonly used in order to preserve intact hydrated structures.

<doc id="904804" wikidata="Q714890" url="?curid=904804" title="Gustave Verbeek">
<text>Gustave Verbeek (; born Gustave Verbeck ; August 29, 1867 – December 5, 1937) was a Dutch-American illustrator and cartoonist, best known for his newspaper cartoons in the early 1900s featuring an inventive use of word play and visual storytelling tricks.

==Biography==
Verbeek was born in Nagasaki, Japan, in 1867, the son of Reformed Church in America missionary Guido Verbeck, of Dutch ancestry, and his wife Maria ().

He grew up in Japan, but went to Paris to study art, and worked for several European newspapers, creating illustrations and cartoons. In 1900 he moved to the United States, where he did illustrations for magazines such as &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, and produced a series of weekly comic strips for newspapers. In the 1910s he abandoned cartooning and became a fine artist. He was noted for his expressionist monotypes, which were the subject of an article in &quot;The Century Magazine&quot; in June 1916.

He was ill for two years, and died on December 5, 1937, at the Home for Incurables, on Third Avenue and 183rd Street in the Bronx, New York City. He had been a patient there for two months.

==Comics==
Verbeek&#x27;s first strip was &quot;Easy Papa&quot;, a fairly conventional strip about two mischievous kids and their father, similar to the highly popular contemporary strip &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot;, which ran in a competing newspaper. &quot;Easy Papa&quot; appeared in &quot;The New York Herald&quot; from May 25, 1902, through February 1, 1903.

Verbeek is most noted for &quot;The Upside Downs of Little Lady Lovekins and Old Man Muffaroo&quot;, a weekly 6-panel comic strip in which the first half of the story was illustrated and captioned right-side-up, then the reader would turn the page up-side-down, and the inverted illustrations with additional captions describing the scenes told the second half of the story, for a total of 12 panels. His signature usually appeared at the top of the first/last panel, upside down. The two main characters were designed such that each would be perceived as the other character when inverted. For example, in one often-reproduced panel, Muffaroo appears in a canoe next to a tree-covered island, and is being attacked by a large fish. When inverted, the image shows a later scene of Lovekins in the beak of a giant roc: Muffaroo&#x27;s canoe has become the bird&#x27;s beak, the fish has turned into the bird&#x27;s head, the island has become its body and the trees its legs, and Muffaroo has turned into Lovekins. Verbeek created a total of 64 of these strips for &quot;The New York Herald&quot;, from October 11, 1903, to January 15, 1905. A pilot strip was published on October 4, 1903. The format of the strip put extreme restrictions on the use of word balloons (even with the use of ambigrams only three strips used word-balloons, all in March 1904). Although the July 10, 1904, strip implies that the stories are set in America, Verbeek filled his milieu with African animals and peoples, fabulous monsters, fairy castles, etc.

Verbeek&#x27;s longest-running strip was &quot;The Terrors of the Tiny Tads&quot;, published by the &quot;Herald&quot; from May 28, 1905, to October 28, 1914. This strip features a group of four unnamed and interchangeable boys, who encounter a variety of strange creatures based on inventive word combinations. For example, they find a &quot;hippopautomobile&quot; (a hippopotamus with a steering wheel and seating in its back as in an automobile), a &quot;pelicanoe&quot; (a pelican in which a rider could sit and paddle like a canoe), and a &quot;samovarmint&quot; (a samovar for serving tea with the head and claws of a wild animal). As with &quot;The Upside Downs&quot;, the strip&#x27;s text consisted of captions below the illustrations; there were no speech balloons. Dan Nadel describes the strip as &quot;quiet, subdued, and somnambulant&quot; in character, partly because Verbeek eschewed &quot;speed lines, stars of pain&quot;, and other such cartoon conventions. Although most strips involved strange creatures, the tads had a clash with a pair of aggressive suffragettes in the June 28, 1914, strip.

He created a short-lived comic strip in 1910 called &quot;The Loony Lyrics of Lulu&quot;. These strips are about a girl who encounters imaginary creatures and writes (inoffensive) limericks about them.

<text>Frederick Albert Cook (June 10, 1865 – August 5, 1940) was an American explorer, physician and ethnographer, who is most known for allegedly being the first to reach the North Pole on April 21, 1908. A competing claim was made a year later by Robert Peary, though both men&#x27;s accounts have since been fiercely disputed; in December 1909, after reviewing Cook&#x27;s limited records, a commission of the University of Copenhagen ruled his claim unproven. Nonetheless, in 1911, Cook published a memoir of the expedition in which he maintained the veracity of his assertions. In addition, he also claimed to have been the first person to reach the summit of Denali (also known as Mount McKinley), the highest mountain in North America, a claim which has since been similarly discredited. Though he may not have achieved either Denali or the North Pole, his was the first and only expedition where a United States national discovered an Arctic island, Meighen Island.

== Biography ==
Cook was born in Hortonville, New York, in Sullivan County. (His birthplace is sometimes listed as Callicoon or Delaware, both also in Sullivan County.) His parents, Theodor and Magdalena Koch, were recent German immigrants who adopted an anglicized version of their surname. He attended local schools before college. After graduating from Columbia University, he studied medicine at what is today NYU&#x27;s Grossman School of Medicine, receiving his doctorate in 1890. 

Cook married Libby Forbes in 1889. She died two years later. In 1902, on his 37th birthday, he married Marie Fidele Hunt. They had two daughters together. They divorced in 1923.

=== Early expeditions ===
Cook was the surgeon on Robert Peary&#x27;s Arctic expedition of 1891–1892, and on the Belgian Antarctic Expedition of 1897–1899. He contributed to saving the lives of its crew members when their ship – the – was ice-bound during the winter, as they had not prepared for such an event. It became the first expedition to winter in the Antarctic region. To prevent scurvy, Cook went hunting to keep the crew supplied with fresh meat. One of the crew members was Roald Amundsen, who credited Cook with his survival in his diary of the expedition.

In 1897, Cook twice visited Tierra del Fuego, where he met the English missionary Thomas Bridges. They studied the Ona and Yahgan peoples, with whom Bridges had worked for two decades. During this time, Bridges had prepared a manuscript on their language&#x27;s grammar and a dictionary of more than 30,000 words. Several years later, Cook tried to publish the dictionary as his own.

=== Summit of Denali ===

In 1903, Cook led an expedition to Denali, during which he circumnavigated the range. He made a second journey in 1906, after which he claimed to have achieved the first summit of its peak with one other expedition crew member. Other members, including Belmore Browne, whom Cook had left on the lower mountain, immediately but privately expressed doubt. Cook&#x27;s claims were not publicly challenged until 1909 when the dispute with Peary over the North Pole claim erupted, with Peary&#x27;s supporters claiming Cook&#x27;s Denali ascent was also fraudulent.

Unlike Harry Karstens and Hudson Stuck in 1913, Cook had not taken photographs from atop Denali. His alleged photo of the summit was found to have been taken on a small outcrop on a ridge beside the Ruth Glacier, away.

In late 1909, Ed Barrill, Cook&#x27;s sole companion during the 1906 climb, signed an affidavit saying that they had not reached the summit. In the late 20th century, historians found that he had been paid by Peary supporters to deny Cook&#x27;s claim. (Henderson writes that this fact was covered up at the time, but Bryce says that it was never a secret.) Up until a month before, Barrill had consistently asserted that he and Cook had reached the summit. His 1909 affidavit included a map correctly locating what came to be called Fake Peak, featured in Cook&#x27;s &quot;summit&quot; photo, and showing that he and Cook had turned back at the &quot;Gateway&quot; (north end of the Great Gorge), 12 horizontal bee-line miles from Denali and below its top.

Climber Bradford Washburn gathered data, repeated the climbs, and took new photos to evaluate Cook&#x27;s 1906 claim. Between 1956 and 1995, Washburn and Brian Okonek identified the locations of most of the photographs Cook took during his 1906 Denali foray and took new photos at the same spots. In 1997 Bryce identified the locations of the remaining photographs, including Cook&#x27;s &quot;summit&quot; photograph; none were taken anywhere near the summit. Washburn showed that none of Cook&#x27;s 1906 photos were taken past the Gateway. 

A 1910 expedition by the Mazama Club reported that Cook&#x27;s map departed abruptly from the landscape at a point when the summit was still distant. Critics of Cook&#x27;s claims have compared Cook&#x27;s map of his alleged 1906 route with the landscape of the last . Cook&#x27;s descriptions of the summit ridge are variously claimed to bear no resemblance to the mountain and to have been verified by many subsequent climbers. In the 1970s, climber Hans Waale found a route that fitted both Cook&#x27;s narrative and descriptions. Three decades later, in 2005 and 2006, this route was successfully climbed by a group of Russian mountaineers.

No evidence of Cook&#x27;s purported journey between the &quot;Gateway&quot; and the summit has been found. His claim to have reached the summit is not supported by his photos&#x27; vistas, his two sketch maps&#x27; markers, and peak-numberings for points attained. Similarly, neither his recorded compass bearings, barometer readings, route-map, nor camp trash support his claim of reaching the summit. In contrast, evidence in all of these categories have been found short of the Gateway.

=== North Pole ===

After the Mount Denali expedition, Cook returned to the Arctic in 1907. He planned to attempt to reach the North Pole, although he did not announce his intention until August 1907, when he was already in the Arctic. He left Annoatok, a small settlement in the north of Greenland, in February 1908. Cook claimed that he reached the pole on April 21, 1908, after traveling north from Axel Heiberg Island, taking with him only two Inuit men, Ahpellah and Etukishook. On the journey south, he claimed to have been cut off from his intended route to Annoatok by open water. Living off local game, his party was forced to push south to Jones Sound, spending the open water season and part of the winter on Devon Island. From there they traveled north, eventually crossing Nares Strait to Annoatok on the Greenland side in the spring of 1909. They said they almost died of starvation during the journey.

Cook and his two companions were gone from Annoatok for 14 months, and their whereabouts in that period is a matter of intense controversy. In the view of Canadian historian Pierre Berton (Berton, 2001), Cook&#x27;s story of his trek around the Arctic islands is probably legitimate. Other writers have relied on later accounts told by Cook&#x27;s companions to investigators, who seemed to present another view.

There are similarities between Ahpellah and Etukishook&#x27;s sketched route of their journey south, and the route taken by the fictional shipwrecked explorers in Jules Verne&#x27;s novel &quot;The Adventures of Captain Hatteras&quot;. For example, the route the two Inuit traced on a map goes over both the Pole of Cold and the wintering site of the fictional expedition. Both expeditions went to the same area of Jones Sound in hopes of finding a whaling ship to take them to civilization.

Cook&#x27;s claim was initially widely believed, but it was disputed by Cook&#x27;s rival polar explorer Robert Peary, who claimed to have reached the North Pole in April 1909. Cook initially congratulated Peary for his achievement, but Peary and his supporters launched a campaign to discredit Cook. They enlisted the aid of socially prominent people outside the field of science, such as football coach Fielding H. Yost (as related in Fred Russell&#x27;s 1943 book, &quot;I&#x27;ll Go Quietly&quot;).
Cook never produced detailed original navigational records to substantiate his claim to have reached the North Pole. He said that his detailed records were part of his belongings, contained in three boxes, which he left at Annoatok in April 1909. He had left them with Harry Whitney, an American hunter who had traveled to Greenland with Peary the previous year due to the lack of manpower for a second sledge-journey south to Upernavik. When Whitney tried to bring Cook&#x27;s boxes with him on his return to the US on Peary&#x27;s ship &quot;Roosevelt&quot; in 1909, Peary refused to allow them on board. As a result, Whitney left Cook&#x27;s boxes in a cache in Greenland. They were never found.

On December 21, 1909, a commission at the University of Copenhagen, after having examined evidence submitted by Cook, ruled that his records did not contain proof that the explorer reached the Pole. (Peary refused to submit his records for review by such a third party, and for decades the National Geographic Society, which held his papers, refused researchers access to them.)

Cook intermittently claimed he had kept copies of his sextant navigational data, and in 1911 published some. These have an incorrect solar diameter. Ahwelah and Etukishook, Cook&#x27;s Inuit companions, gave seemingly conflicting details about where they had gone with him. The major conflicts have been resolved in the light of improved geographical knowledge. Whitney was convinced that they had reached the North Pole with Cook, but was reluctant to be drawn into the controversy.

The Peary expedition&#x27;s people (primarily Matthew Henson, who had a working knowledge of Inuit, and George Borup, who did not) claimed that Ahwelah and Etukishook told them they had traveled only a few days from land. A map allegedly was drawn by Ahwelaw and Etukishook that correctly located and accurately depicted then-unknown Meighen Island, which strongly suggests that they visited it as they claimed. Canadian Vilhjalmur Stefansson&#x27;s expedition in 1916 later landed on Meighen Island; Stefansson later read Cook&#x27;s papers and agreed that Meighen Island was a Cook discovery. It is known as the only island to be discovered by a United States expedition in the North American arctic. For more detail see Bryce (1997) and Henderson (2005).

The conflicting claims of Cook and Peary prompted Roald Amundsen to take extensive precautions in navigation during his South Pole expedition so there could be no doubt concerning attainment of the pole if successful. Amundsen also had the advantage of traveling over a continent. He left unmistakable evidence of his presence at the South Pole, whereas any ice on which Cook might or might not have camped would have drifted many miles in the year between the competing claims.

At the end of his 1911 memoir, Cook wrote: &quot;I have stated my case, presented my proofs. As to the relative merits of my claim, and Mr. Peary&#x27;s, place the two records side by side. Compare them. I shall be satisfied with your decision.&quot;

== Reputation ==
Cook&#x27;s reputation never recovered from the attacks on his claim. While Peary&#x27;s North Pole claim was widely accepted for most of the 20th century, it has since been discredited by a variety of reviewers, including the National Geographic Society, which long supported him. Cook spent the next few years defending his claim and threatening to sue writers who said that he had faked the trip. 

Researching the complicated story of the conflicting claims, the writer Robert Bryce began to assess how the men&#x27;s personalities and goals were in contrast, and evaluated them against the period of the Gilded Age. He believes that Cook, as a physician and ethnographer, cared about the people on his expedition and admired the Inuit. Bryce writes that Cook &quot;genuinely loved and hungered for the real meat of exploration—mapping new routes and shorelines, learning and adapting to the survival techniques of the Eskimos, advancing his own knowledge—and that of the world—for its own sake.&quot; But, he could not find supporters to help finance the expeditions without a goal that was more flashy. There was tremendous pressure on each man to be the first to reach the Pole, in order to gain financial support for continued expeditions.

=== Fraud trial ===
In 1919, Cook started promoting startup oil companies in Fort Worth. In April 1923, Cook and 24 other Fort Worth oil promoters were indicted in a federal crackdown on fraudulent oil company promotions. Three of Cook&#x27;s employees pleaded guilty, but Cook insisted on his innocence and went to trial. Also tried was his head advertising copywriter, S. E. J. Cox, who had been previously convicted of mail fraud in connection with his own oil company promotions.

Among other deceptive practices, Cook was charged with paying dividends from stock sales, rather than from profits. Cook&#x27;s attorney was former politician Joseph Weldon Bailey, who clashed frequently with the judge. The jury found Cook guilty on 14 counts of fraud. In November 1923, Judge Killits sentenced Cook and 13 other oil company promoters to prison terms. Cook drew the longest sentence, 14 years 9 months. His attorney appealed the verdict, but the conviction was upheld.

== Later life ==
Cook was imprisoned until 1930. Roald Amundsen, who believed he owed his life to Cook&#x27;s extrication of the &quot;Belgica&quot;, visited him there at least once. Cook was pardoned by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940, ten years after his release and shortly before his death of a cerebral hemorrhage on August 5. He was interred at the Chapel of Forest Lawn Cemetery, Buffalo.

===Pete&#x27;s Fine Foods (ex-Pete&#x27;s Frootique)===
Luckett became widely known in the Maritimes for his Pete&#x27;s Fine Foods (formerly Pete&#x27;s Frootique) specialty grocery stores. The first Pete&#x27;s Frootique store opened in 1981 at the Saint John City Market. This was subsequently run by Pete&#x27;s nephew and his partner. This was followed by a second store that opened on Mountain Road in Moncton. In 1992, the third Pete&#x27;s Frootique store opened at the Sunnyside Mall in Bedford. In 2004, the fourth Pete&#x27;s Frootique store opened on Dresden Row in downtown Halifax, and the fifth Pete&#x27;s Frootique opened in Wolfville in 2012. On March 27, 2015, Pete&#x27;s announced that the Wolfville location would close at the end of May 2015. A press release indicated that the Wolfville store was unable to attract enough local customers to become profitable.

The Pete&#x27;s Fine Foods stores are all different in scale. The Bedford store is the most expansive and up-scale as it houses the following operating divisions: a power juice bar, a gourmet fruit and gift basket shop, a European delicatessen, a gourmet butcher and fish shop, a British specialty food emporium named Best of Britain, and a wine shop.

====Sale to Sobeys====
In October 2015, Luckett announced that the national grocery chain Sobeys would be entering into an agreement to purchase the &quot;Pete’s Fine Foods&quot; grocery retail and wholesale business.

===Luckett Vineyards===

In 2010, Luckett opened Luckett Vineyards, a vineyard and winery in Gaspereau Valley, Nova Scotia. He also operates a farm that supplies vegetables and fruit to his stores, as well as commercial customers such as restaurants and caterers. As of 2023, Luckett Vineyards has been bought and run by Pete&#x27;s daughter Geena Luckett. 

===Media personality===
Luckett&#x27;s TV career started while in Saint John as a frequent guest on the CBC television show &quot;Midday&quot;. Upon moving to Nova Scotia in the early 1990s, Luckett became a contributing guest to the Halifax CTV affiliate, ATV, where he hosted a bi-weekly segment on fruit and vegetables on the supperhour news show &quot;Live at Five&quot;. Luckett&#x27;s catchphrase in his broadcast media appearances is &quot;Toodlee-doo.&quot;

Luckett hosted the Food Network series &quot;The Food Hunter&quot; where he travels around the world. Luckett has also written a column for the &quot;Halifax Chronicle-Herald&quot; and serves as a consultant for Chartwells, which delivers all food services at Acadia University, near his home.

Luckett has also appeared on such programs as CBC&#x27;s Steven and Chris. In December 2011, Luckett starred as a cab driver at the end of a TV ad for the NSLC encouraging Nova Scotians not to drink and drive by saying &quot;If you&#x27;ve had a few, your car has too&quot;. The ad shows cars parked outside a party as drunk saying such phrases as &quot;I love you man&quot; and other drunken ramblings.

==Impact on retailing in Nova Scotia==
In 1999, Luckett made headlines when he won a court battle against the Government of Nova Scotia when he sought to keep his Bedford store open on Sunday. To circumvent Nova Scotia&#x27;s Sunday shopping laws, Luckett registered sections of his Bedford store as separate businesses. He copied this approach at his Halifax store when it opened in 2004. In October 2006, the province&#x27;s Sunday shopping restrictions were overturned after both Sobeys and Atlantic Superstore copied Luckett&#x27;s approach to several of their supermarkets, forcing the government to enact restrictions that were successfully contested in court. In 2014, Pete&#x27;s Frootique became Pete&#x27;s Fine Foods.

<doc id="904822" wikidata="Q5334553" url="?curid=904822" title="Ed Bicknell">
<text>Ed Bicknell is a British music manager and drummer, best known for managing rock band Dire Straits, as well as Mark Knopfler, Gerry Rafferty, Bryan Ferry, Scott Walker and The Blue Nile.

==Career==
Ed Bicknell (born 1948, Yorkshire) was Chairman of Hull University entertainment&#x27;s committee from October 1967 to June 1969, when he first got a taste for the music industry. He also ran the folk and jazz and blues societies across the same period.

During that time he promoted shows by Jimi Hendrix, The Who, the Moody Blues, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Family, Ralph Mctell, Bert Jansch, The Kinks, Jethro Tull, John Mayall, Pink Floyd and numerous others.                       

==London==
Moving to London, he played in several bands as drummer, and then became an agent at John Sherry Enterprises, and later NEMS, representing among others Wishbone Ash, Jose Feliciano, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Man, The Ramones, Talking Heads, Richie Havens and War.

Whilst working at NEMS in December 1977, Ed Bicknell received a call from Phonogram A&amp;R man John Stainze who had just signed a new rock band, Dire Straits, formed in 1977 by guitarist Mark Knopfler, to the Vertigo label. In January 1978 Bicknell became their manager. Dire Straits would release six studio albums between 1978 and 1991. Bicknell was also the drummer of The Notting Hillbillies, a country group formed by Knopfler in 1989 whilst Dire Straits was on an extended hiatus. They recorded one album, &quot;Missing...Presumed Having a Good Time,&quot; which was released in March 1990, and toured the UK and performed two residencies at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club in London before disbanding later that year. After Dire Straits disbanded permanently in 1995, Bicknell continued to manage Mark Knopfler as a solo artist for several years until 2000 when he stood down as Knopfler&#x27;s manager on amicable terms.

In 1997, The Blue Nile appointed Ed Bicknell as a full-time manager for the first time in their career. He extricated the group from their deal with Warner Bros. He also attempted to persuade the band to change their recording habits, but had little success. Bicknell parted ways with the band in 2004, later stating that &quot;in terms of the modern recording world the history of The Blue Nile was the most screwed-up I had ever encountered&quot;.

After two years as &quot;Head of International Music&quot; during which time he set up the music department, Bicknell left the London office of William Morris Endeavor in April 2010.

In recent years, he has often appeared on radio and television to discuss music industry issues and has carried out over 80 “interviews“ of leading music industry figures and artists at conferences and educational establishments.

<text>In television broadcasting a double box is a graphical overlay on the screen with two rectangular &quot;holes&quot; where two separate video sources are inserted. A double box is typically used for two live shots from different locations, with a conversation taking place between the participants; i.e., an interview, or a dialog between a remote reporter and an anchor in the studio.

The double box graphic is created and controlled from a character generator, such as a Chyron or Avid Deko. The video sources are then mixed together by a switcher for play to air.

<doc id="904825" wikidata="Q1326943" url="?curid=904825" title="Electrolyte imbalance">
<text>Electrolyte imbalance, or water-electrolyte imbalance, is an abnormality in the concentration of electrolytes in the body. Electrolytes play a vital role in maintaining homeostasis in the body. They help to regulate heart and neurological function, fluid balance, oxygen delivery, acid–base balance and much more. Electrolyte imbalances can develop by consuming too little or too much electrolyte as well as excreting too little or too much electrolyte. Examples of electrolytes include calcium, chloride, magnesium, phosphate, potassium, and sodium.

Electrolyte disturbances are involved in many disease processes and are an important part of patient management in medicine. The causes, severity, treatment, and outcomes of these disturbances can differ greatly depending on the implicated electrolyte. The most serious electrolyte disturbances involve abnormalities in the levels of sodium, potassium or calcium. Other electrolyte imbalances are less common and often occur in conjunction with major electrolyte changes. The kidney is the most important organ in maintaining appropriate fluid and electrolyte balance, but other factors such as hormonal changes and physiological stress play a role.

==Overview==

===Anions and cations===
Calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium ions are cations (+), while chloride, and phosphate ions are anions (−).

===Causes===
Chronic laxative abuse or severe diarrhea or vomiting can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.

====Malnutrition====
People with malnutrition are at especially high risk for an electrolyte imbalance. Severe electrolyte imbalances must be treated carefully as there are risks with overcorrecting too quickly, which can result in arrhythmias, brain herniation, or refeeding syndrome depending on the cause of imbalance.

===General function===
Electrolytes are important because they are what cells (especially nerve, heart and muscle cells) use to maintain voltages across their cell membranes. Electrolytes have different functions, and an important one is to carry electrical impulses between cells. Kidneys work to keep the electrolyte concentrations in blood constant despite changes in the body. For example, during heavy exercise, electrolytes are lost in sweat, particularly in the form of sodium and potassium. The kidneys can also generate dilute urine to balance sodium levels. These electrolytes must be replaced to keep the electrolyte concentrations of the body fluids constant. Hyponatremia, or low sodium, is the most commonly seen type of electrolyte imbalance.

Treatment of electrolyte imbalance depends on the specific electrolyte involved and whether the levels are too high or too low. The level of aggressiveness of treatment and choice of treatment may change depending on the severity of the disturbance. If the levels of an electrolyte are too low, a common response to electrolyte imbalance may be to prescribe supplementation. However, if the electrolyte involved is sodium, the issue is often water excess rather than sodium deficiency. Supplementation for these people may correct the electrolyte imbalance but at the expense of volume overload. For newborn children, this has serious risks.

== Calcium ==
Though calcium is the most plentiful electrolyte in the body, a large percentage of it is used to form the bones. It is mainly absorbed and excreted through the GI system. The majority of calcium resides extracellularly, and it is crucial for the function of neurons, muscle cells, function of enzymes, and coagulation. The normal range for calcium concentration in the body is 8.5 - 10.5 mg/dL. The parathyroid gland is responsible for sensing changes in calcium concentration and regulating the electrolyte with parathyroid hormone.

=== Hypercalcemia ===

Hypercalcemia describes when the concentration of calcium in the blood is too high. This occurs above 10.5 mg/dL.

==== Causes ====
The most common causes of hypercalcemia are certain types of cancer, hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma, excessive ingestion of vitamin D, sarcoidosis, and tuberculosis. Hyperparathyroidism and malignancy are the predominant causes. It can also be caused by muscle cell breakdown, prolonged immobilization, dehydration.

==== Symptoms ====
The predominant symptoms of hypercalcemia are abdominal pain, constipation, extreme thirst, excessive urination, kidney stones, nausea and vomiting. In severe cases where the calcium concentration is &gt;14 mg/dL, individuals may experience confusion, altered mental status, coma, and seizure.

==== Treatment ====
Primary treatment of hypercalcemia consists of administering IV fluids. If the hypercalcemia is severe and/or associated with cancer, it may be treated with bisphosphonates. For very severe cases, hemodialysis may be considered for rapid removal of calcium from the blood.

=== Hypocalcemia ===

Hypocalcemia describes when calcium levels are too low in the blood, usually less than 8.5 mg/dL.

==== Causes ====
Hypoparathyroidism and vitamin D deficiency are common causes of hypocalcemia. It can also be caused by malnutrition, blood transfusion, ethylene glycol intoxication, and pancreatitis.

==== Symptoms ====
Neurological and cardiovascular symptoms are the most common manifestations of hypocalcemia. Patients may experience muscle cramping or twitching, and numbness around the mouth and fingers. They may also have shortness of breath, low blood pressure, and cardiac arrhythmias.

==== Treatment ====
Patients with hypocalcemia may be treated with either oral or IV calcium. Typically, IV calcium is reserved for patients with severe hypocalcemia. It is also important to check magnesium levels in patients with hypocalcemia and to replace magnesium if it is low.

== Chloride ==
Chloride, after sodium, is the second most abundant electrolyte in the blood and most abundant in the extracellular fluid. Most of the chloride in the body is from salt (NaCl) in the diet. Chloride is part of gastric acid (HCl), which plays a role in absorption of electrolytes, activating enzymes, and killing bacteria. The levels of chloride in the blood can help determine if there are underlying metabolic disorders. Generally, chloride has an inverse relationship with bicarbonate, an electrolyte that indicates acid-base status. Overall, treatment of chloride imbalances involve addressing the underlying cause rather than supplementing or avoiding chloride.

=== Hyperchloremia ===
==== Causes ====
Hyperchloremia, or high chloride levels, is usually associated with excess chloride intake (e.g., saltwater drowning), fluid loss (e.g., diarrhea, sweating), and metabolic acidosis.

==== Symptoms ====
Patients are usually asymptomatic with mild hyperchloremia. Symptoms associated with hyperchloremia are usually caused by the underlying cause of this electrolyte imbalance.

==== Treatment ====
Treat the underlying cause, which commonly includes increasing fluid intake.

=== Hypochloremia ===
==== Causes ====
Hypochloremia, or low chloride levels, are commonly associated with gastrointestinal (e.g., vomiting) and kidney (e.g., diuretics) losses. Greater water or sodium intake relative to chloride also can contribute to hypochloremia.

==== Symptoms ====
Patients are usually asymptomatic with mild hypochloremia. Symptoms associated with hypochloremia are usually caused by the underlying cause of this electrolyte imbalance.

==== Treatment ====
Treat the underlying cause, which commonly includes increasing fluid intake.

== Magnesium ==
Magnesium is mostly found in the bones and within cells. Approximately 1% of total magnesium in the body is found in the blood. Magnesium is important in control of metabolism and is involved in numerous enzyme reactions. A normal range is 0.70 - 1.10 mmol/L. The kidney is responsible for maintaining the magnesium levels in this narrow range.

=== Hypermagnesemia ===
Hypermagnesemia, or abnormally high levels of magnesium in the blood, is relatively rare in individuals with normal kidney function. This is defined by a magnesium concentration &gt;2.5 mg/dL.

==== Causes ====
Hypermagnesemia typically occurs in individuals with abnormal kidney function. This imbalance can also occur with use of antacids or laxatives that contain magnesium. Iatrogenic cases of hypermagnesemia can be prevented by avoiding magnesium-containing medications.

==== Symptoms ====
Mild symptoms include nausea, flushing, tiredness. Neurologic symptoms are seen most commonly including decreased deep tendon reflexes. Severe symptoms include paralysis, respiratory failure, and bradycardia progressing to cardiac arrest.

==== Treatment ====
If kidney function is normal, stopping the source of magnesium intake is sufficient. Diuretics can help increase magnesium excretion in the urine. Severe symptoms may be treated with dialysis to directly remove magnesium from the blood.

=== Hypomagnesemia ===
Hypomagnesemia, or low magnesium levels in the blood, can occur in up to 12% of hospitalized patients. Symptoms or effects of hypomagnesemia can occur after relatively small deficits.

==== Causes ====
Major causes of hypomagnesemia are from gastrointestinal losses such as vomiting and diarrhea. Another major cause is from kidney losses from diuretics, alcohol use, hypercalcemia, and genetic disorders. Low dietary intake can also contribute to magnesium deficiency.

==== Symptoms ====
Hypomagnesemia is typically associated with other electrolyte abnormalities, such as hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. For this reason, there may be overlap in symptoms seen in these other electrolyte deficiencies. Severe symptoms include arrhythmias, seizures, and tetany.

==== Treatment ====
The first step in treatment is determining whether the deficiency is caused by a gastrointestinal or kidney problem. People with no or minimal symptoms are given oral magnesium; however, many people experience diarrhea and other gastrointestinal discomfort. Those who cannot tolerate or receive magnesium, or those with severe symptoms can receive intravenous magnesium.

Hypomagnesemia may prevent the normalization of other electrolyte deficiencies. If other electrolyte deficiencies are associated, normalizing magnesium levels may be necessary to treat the other deficiencies.

== Phosphate ==

=== Hyperphosphatemia ===
=== Hypophosphatemia ===
== Potassium ==
Potassium resides mainly inside the cells of the body, so its concentration in the blood can range anywhere from 3.5 mEq/L to 5 mEq/L. The kidneys are responsible for excreting the majority of potassium from the body. This means their function is crucial for maintaining a proper balance of potassium in the blood stream.

=== Hyperkalemia ===

Hyperkalemia means the concentration of potassium in the blood is too high. This occurs when the concentration of potassium is &gt;5 mEq/L. It can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and even death. As such it is considered to be the most dangerous electrolyte disturbance.

==== Causes ====
Hyperkalemia is typically caused by decreased excretion by the kidneys, shift of potassium to the extracellular space, or increased consumption of potassium rich foods in patients with kidney failure. The most common cause of hyperkalemia is lab error due to potassium released as blood cells from the sample break down. Other common causes are kidney disease, cell death, acidosis, and drugs that affect kidney function.

==== Symptoms ====
Part of the danger of hyperkalemia is that it is often asymptomatic, and only detected during normal lab work done by primary care physicians. As potassium levels get higher, individuals may begin to experience nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Patients with severe hyperkalemia, defined by levels above 7 mEq/L, may experience muscle cramps, numbness, tingling, absence of reflexes, and paralysis. Patients may experience arrhythmias that can result in death.

==== Treatment ====
There are three mainstays of treatment of hyperkalemia. These are stabilization of cardiac cells, shift of potassium into the cells, and removal of potassium from the body. Stabilization of cardiac muscle cells is done by administering calcium intravenously. Shift of potassium into the cells is done using both insulin and albuterol inhalers. Excretion of potassium from the body is done using either hemodialysis, loop diuretics, or a resin that causes potassium to be excreted in the fecal matter.

=== Hypokalemia ===

The most common electrolyte disturbance, hypokalemia means that the concentration of potassium is &lt;3.5 mEq/L. It often occurs concurrently with low magnesium levels.

==== Causes ====
Low potassium is caused by increased excretion of potassium, decreased consumption of potassium rich foods, movement of potassium into the cells, or certain endocrine diseases. Excretion is the most common cause of hypokalemia and can be caused by diuretic use, metabolic acidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperaldosteronism, and renal tubular acidosis. Potassium can also be lost through vomiting and diarrhea.

==== Symptoms ====
Hypokalemia is often asymptomatic, and symptoms may not appear until potassium concentration is &lt;2.5 mEq/L. Typical symptoms consist of muscle weakness and cramping. Low potassium can also cause cardiac arrhythmias.

==== Treatment ====
Hypokalemia is treated by replacing the body&#x27;s potassium. This can occur either orally or intravenously. Because low potassium is usually accompanied by low magnesium, patients are often given magnesium alongside potassium.

== Sodium ==
Sodium is the most abundant electrolyte in the blood. It is a common saying in human physiology that &quot;cells are bags of Potassium floating in a sea of Sodium&quot; Sodium and its homeostasis in the human body is highly dependent on fluids. The human body is approximately 60% water, a percentage which is also known as total body water. The total body water can be divided into two compartments called extracellular fluid (ECF) and intracellular fluid (ICF). The majority of the sodium in the body stays in the extracellular fluid compartment. This compartment consists of the fluid surrounding the cells and the fluid inside the blood vessels. ECF has a sodium concentration of approximately 140 mEq/L. Because cell membranes are permeable to water but not sodium, the movement of water across membranes affects the concentration of sodium in the blood. Sodium acts as a force that pulls water across membranes, and water moves from places with lower sodium concentration to places with higher sodium concentration. This happens through a process called osmosis. When evaluating sodium imbalances, both total body water and total body sodium must be considered.

=== Hypernatremia ===

Hypernatremia means that the concentration of sodium in the blood is too high. An individual is considered to be having high sodium at levels above 145 mEq/L of sodium. Hypernatremia is not common in individuals with no other health concerns. Most individuals with this disorder have either experienced loss of water from diarrhea, altered sense of thirst, inability to consume water, inability of kidneys to make concentrated urine, or increased salt intake.

==== Causes ====
There are three types of hypernatremia each with different causes. The first is dehydration along with low total body sodium. This is most commonly caused by heatstroke, burns, extreme sweating, vomiting, and diarrhea. The second is low total body water with normal body sodium. This can be caused by diabetes insipidus, renal disease, hypothalamic dysfunction, sickle cell disease, and certain drugs. The third is increased total body sodium which is caused by increased ingestion, Conn&#x27;s syndrome, or Cushing&#x27;s syndrome.

==== Symptoms ====
Symptoms of hypernatremia may vary depending on type and how quickly the electrolyte disturbance developed. Common symptoms are dehydration, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, weakness, increased thirst, and excess urination. Patients may be on medications that caused the imbalance such as diuretics or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Some patients may have no obvious symptoms at all.

==== Treatment ====
It is crucial to first assess the stability of the patient. If there are any signs of shock such as tachycardia or hypotension, these must be treated immediately with IV saline infusion.  Once the patient is stable, it is important to identify the underlying cause of hypernatremia as that may affect the treatment plan. The final step in treatment is to calculate the patients free water deficit, and to replace it at a steady rate using a combination of oral or IV fluids.  The rate of replacement of fluids varies depending on how long the patient has been hypernatremic. Lowering the sodium level too quickly can cause cerebral edema.

=== Hyponatremia ===

Hyponatremia means that the concentration of sodium in the blood is too low. It is generally defined as a concentration lower than 135 mEq/L. This relatively common electrolyte disorder can indicate the presence of a disease process, but in the hospital setting is more often due to administration of Hypotonic fluids. The majority of hospitalized patients only experience mild hyponatremia, with levels above 130 mEq/L. Only 1-4% of patients experience levels lower than 130 mEq/L.

==== Causes ====
Hyponatremia has many causes including heart failure, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, treatment with thiazide diuretics, psychogenic polydipsia, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. It can also be found in the postoperative state, and in the setting of accidental water intoxication as can be seen with intense exercise. Common causes in pediatric patients may be diarrheal illness, frequent feedings with dilute formula, water intoxication via excessive consumption, and enemas. Pseudohyponatremia is a false low sodium reading that can be caused by high levels of fats or proteins in the blood. Dilutional hyponatremia can happen in diabetics as high glucose levels pull water into the blood stream causing the sodium concentration to be lower. Diagnosis of the cause of hyponatremia relies on three factors: volume status, plasma osmolality, urine sodium levels and urine osmolality.

==== Symptoms ====
Many individuals with mild hyponatremia will not experience symptoms. Severity of symptoms is directly correlated with severity of hyponatremia and rapidness of onset. General symptoms include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, confusion, agitation, and weakness. More concerning symptoms involve the central nervous system and include seizures, coma, and death due to brain herniation. These usually do not occur until sodium levels fall below 120 mEq/L.

==== Treatment ====
Considerations for treatment include symptom severity, time to onset, volume status, underlying cause, and sodium levels. If the sodium level is &lt;120 mEq/L, the person can be treated with hypertonic saline as extremely low levels are associated with severe neurological symptoms. In non-emergent situations, it is important to correct the sodium slowly to minimize risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome. If a person has low total body water and low sodium they are typically given fluids. If a person has high total body water (such as due to heart failure or kidney disease) they may be placed on fluid restriction, salt restriction, and treated with a diuretic. If a person has a normal volume of total body water, they may be placed on fluid restriction alone.

== Dietary sources ==
Diet significantly contributes to electrolyte stores and blood levels. Below are a list of foods that are associated with higher levels of these electrolytes.

=== Sodium ===
It is recommended that an individual consumes less than 2,300 mg of sodium daily as part of a healthy diet. A significant portion of our sodium intake comes from just a few types of food, which may be surprising, as large sources of sodium may not taste salty.
* Breads
* Soups
* Cured meats and cold cuts
* Cheese
* Savory snacks (e.g., chips, crackers, pretzels)

=== Phosphate ===
In minerals, phosphorus generally occurs as phosphate. Good sources of phosphorus includes baking powder, instant pudding, cottonseed meal, hemp seeds, fortified beverages, dried whey.

=== Potassium ===
Good sources of potassium are found in a variety of fruits and vegetables. Recommend potassium intake for adults ranges from 2,300 mg to 3,400 mg depending on age and gender.
* Beans and lentils
* Dark leafy greens (e.g., spinach, kale)
* Apples
* Apricots
* Potatoes
* Squash
* Bananas
* Dates

=== Calcium ===
Dairy is a major contributor of calcium to diet in the United States. The recommended calcium intake for adults range from 1,000 mg to 1,300 mg depending on age and gender.
* Yogurt
* Cheese
* Milk
* Tofu
* Canned sardines

=== Magnesium ===
Magnesium is found in a variety of vegetables, meats, and grains. Foods high in fiber generally are a source of magnesium. The recommended magnesium intake for adults range from 360 mg to 420 mg depending on age and gender.
* Epsom salt
* Nuts and seeds (e.g., pumpkin seeds, almonds, peanuts)
* Dark leafy greens (e.g., spinach)
* Beans
* Fortified cereals

<text>In the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;D&amp;D&quot;) fantasy role-playing game, alignment is a categorization of the ethical and moral perspective of player characters, non-player characters, and creatures.

Most versions of the game feature a system in which players make two choices for characters. One is the character&#x27;s views on &quot;law&quot; versus &quot;chaos&quot;, the other on &quot;good&quot; versus &quot;evil&quot;. The two axes, along with &quot;neutral&quot; in the middle, allow for nine alignments in combination. Later editions of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; have shifted away from tying alignment to specific game mechanics; instead, alignment is used as a roleplaying guide and does not need to be rigidly adhered to by the player. According to Ian Livingstone, alignment is &quot;often criticized as being arbitrary and unreal, but... it works if played well and provides a useful structural framework on which not only characters but governments and worlds can be moulded.&quot;

==History==
&quot;D&amp;D&quot; co-creator Gary Gygax credited the inspiration for the alignment system to the fantasy stories of Michael Moorcock and Poul Anderson.

The original version of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; (1974) allowed players to choose among three alignments when creating a character: lawful, implying honor and respect for society&#x27;s rules; chaotic, implying rebelliousness and individualism; and neutral, seeking a balance between the extremes.

In 1976, Gary Gygax published an article title &quot;The Meaning of Law and Chaos in Dungeons and Dragons and Their Relationships to Good and Evil&quot; in The Strategic Review Volume 2, issue 1, that introduced a second axis of good, implying altruism and respect for life, versus evil, implying selfishness and no respect for life. The 1977 release of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set&quot; incorporated this model. As with the law-versus-chaos axis, a neutral position exists between the extremes. Characters and creatures could be lawful and evil at the same time (such as a tyrant), or chaotic but good (such as Robin Hood).

&quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;AD&amp;D&quot;), released between 1977 and 1979, continued the two-axis system. The 1981 version of the &quot;Basic Set&quot; went back to the earlier one-axis alignment system.

&quot;AD&amp;D 2nd Edition&quot;, released in 1988, retained the two-axis system. In that edition, a character who performs too many actions outside their alignment can find their alignment changed, and is penalized by losing experience points, making it harder to reach the next level. 

&quot;D&amp;D&quot; 3rd Edition, released in 2000, kept the same alignment system. However the &quot;Eberron Campaign Setting&quot; (2004), released for 3.5 Edition, subverted many of the established &quot;D&amp;D&quot; tropes including alignment. Evil beings of traditionally good races and good beings of traditionally evil races were encouraged but the alignment definition remained true to &quot;D&amp;D&quot; standards, with good and evil retaining their meanings. Oppositely aligned characters will side with each other briefly if a threat looms over all. Keith Baker highlighted that in Eberron &quot;alignment is a spectrum&quot;.

&quot;D&amp;D&quot; 4th Edition, released in 2008, reduced the number of alignments to five: lawful good, good, evil, chaotic evil, and unaligned. In that edition, &quot;good&quot; replaced neutral good and did not encompass chaotic good; &quot;evil&quot; replaced neutral evil and did not encompass lawful evil; &quot;unaligned&quot; replaced true neutral and did not encompass lawful neutral and chaotic neutral. 4th Edition was the start of de-emphasizing alignment in &quot;D&amp;D&quot;. &quot;Wired&quot; highlighted that 4th Edition&#x27;s de-emphasis of &quot;alignment and traditional racial stereotypes&quot;, along with other adjustments to the core races, allowed for more &quot;PCs and NPCs with unknown and shifting motives&quot;.

&quot;D&amp;D&quot; 5th Edition, released in 2014, returned to the previous schema of nine alignments, and included a tenth option of &quot;unaligned&quot; for creatures that operate on instinct, not moral decision-making. With 5th Edition, alignment was decoupled from most of the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; game mechanics, such as &quot;no rules that limit certain classes to characters of a specific alignment, or spells that impact characters differently depending on&quot; alignment. Players do not need to be rigid or &quot;consistently faithful&quot; to their alignment choice; alignment in this edition is more of a roleplaying guide. Starting with the publication of &quot;Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden&quot; (2020) and &quot;Tasha&#x27;s Cauldron of Everything&quot; (2020), player and monster races no longer had preassigned alignments. In December 2021, official errata removed the suggested alignments for playable races in 5th Edition sourcebooks. &quot;Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse&quot; (2022), a sourcebook which revised roughly 250 previously published monsters, removed preassigned alignments for creatures except in the cases of specifically named characters. Creature stat blocks that also have playable races &quot;now state that they can be any alignment&quot; while &quot;other monsters, such as demons, with a strong association to a given alignment feature the word &#x27;typically&#x27; next to their alignment. This insinuates that exceptions to a preassigned alignment are possible, encouraging DMs to potentially subvert player expectations and utilize monsters in unanticipated ways&quot;.

==Function==
Richard Bartle&#x27;s &quot;Designing Virtual Worlds&quot; noted that alignment is a way to categorize players&#x27; characters, along with gender, race, character class, and sometimes nationality. Alignment was designed to help define role-playing, a character&#x27;s alignment being seen as their outlook on life. A player decides how a character should behave in assigning an alignment, and should then play the character in accordance with that alignment.

A character&#x27;s alignment can change. If a lawful neutral character consistently performs good acts, when neutral or evil actions were possible, the character&#x27;s alignment will shift to lawful good. During game sessions, the Dungeon Master decides when alignment violations occur, as it is subjective and often frowned upon, if not outright disallowed.

Characters acting as a party should have compatible alignments; a party with both good and evil characters may turn against itself. Bill Slavicsek and Richard Baker&#x27;s &quot;Dungeon Master for Dummies&quot; noted that a party of good or neutral characters works better as the motivations for adventures are easier, the group dynamics are smoother, and the &quot;heroic aspects of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; shine through in ways that just don&#x27;t happen when players play evil characters&quot;.

== Axes ==

=== Law versus chaos===
The law versus chaos axis in &quot;D&amp;D&quot; predates good versus evil in the game rules.

Originally the law/chaos axis was defined as the distinction between &quot;the belief that everything should follow an order, and that obeying rules is the natural way of life&quot;, as opposed to &quot;the belief that life is random, and that chance and luck rule the world&quot;. According to the early rulebook, lawful characters are driven to protect the interest of the group above the interest of the individual and would strive to be honest and to obey just and fair laws. Chaotic creatures and individuals embraced the individual above the group and viewed laws and honesty as unimportant. At that time, the rulebook specified that &quot;chaotic behavior is usually the same as behavior that could be called &#x27;evil. Neutral creatures and characters believe in the importance of both groups and individuals, and felt that law and chaos are both important. They believe in maintaining the balance between law and chaos and were often motivated by self-interest.

The third edition &quot;D&amp;D&quot; rules define &quot;law&quot; and &quot;chaos&quot; as follows:
* Law implies honor, trustworthiness, obedience to authority, and reliability. On the downside, lawfulness can include closed-mindedness, reactionary adherence to tradition, judgmentalness, and a lack of adaptability. Those who consciously promote lawfulness say that only lawful behavior creates a society in which people can depend on each other and make the right decisions in full confidence that others will act as they should.
* Chaos implies freedom, adaptability, and flexibility. On the downside, chaos can include recklessness, resentment toward legitimate authority, arbitrary actions, and irresponsibility. Those who promote chaotic behavior say that only unfettered personal freedom allows people to express themselves fully and lets society benefit from the potential that its individuals have within them.
* Someone who is neutral with respect to law and chaos has a normal respect for authority and feels neither a compulsion to follow rules nor a compulsion to rebel. They are honest but can be tempted into lying or deceiving others if it suits them.

=== Good versus evil===
The conflict of good versus evil is a common motif in &quot;D&amp;D&quot; and other fantasy fiction. Although player characters can adventure for personal gain rather than from altruistic motives, it is generally assumed that the player characters will be opposed to evil and will tend to fight evil creatures.

The third edition &quot;D&amp;D&quot; rules define &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; as follows:

* Good implies altruism, respect for life, and a concern for the dignity of sentient beings. Good characters make personal sacrifices to help others.
* Evil implies harming, oppressing, and killing others. Some evil creatures simply have no compassion for others and kill without qualms if doing so is convenient or if it can be set up. Others actively pursue evil, killing for sport or out of duty to some malevolent deity or master.
* People who are neutral with respect to good and evil have compunctions against killing the innocent but lack the commitment to make sacrifices to protect or help others. Neutral people are committed to others by personal relationships.

Within the game, altruistic heroes and creatures such as angels are considered good. Villains and violent criminals are considered evil, as are inherently evil creatures such as demons and most undead. Animals are considered neutral even when they attack innocents, because they act on natural instinct and lack the intelligence to make moral decisions; in the fifth edition, this is expressed by labeling such beasts as &quot;unaligned&quot;. According to Greg Littmann, the predetermined assignment of an alignment to monsters means that they are good or evil by nature. Nevertheless, the rules do allow for individual variances, permitting &quot;a red dragon looking to defect to the side of good&quot;—even though Littmann acknowledges the rarity of such situations. As 5th Edition developed, it removed preassigned alignments to races and monsters. While some monsters have a &quot;strong association to a given alignment&quot;, nature is determined by the Dungeon Master.

Although good characters can be defined as having a respect for others, Littmann notes that this does not necessarily extend to the treatment of evil creatures—&quot;a party of good characters will chop and char a tribe of orcs to so much smoking hamburger without the slightest hesitation or regrets&quot;.

==Alignments==
The nine alignments can be shown in a grid, as follows:
The 3.5 edition &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; provided archetype examples of each alignment, as shown below.

===Lawful good===
A lawful good character typically acts with compassion and always with honor and a sense of duty. However, lawful good characters will often regret taking any action they fear would violate their code, even if they recognize such action as being good. Such characters include gold dragons, righteous knights, paladins, and most dwarves.

===Neutral good===
A neutral good character typically acts altruistically, without regard for or against lawful precepts such as rules or tradition. A neutral good character has no problems with cooperating with lawful officials, but does not feel beholden to them. In the event that doing the right thing requires the bending or breaking of rules, they do not suffer the same inner conflict that a lawful good character would. Examples of this alignment include many celestials, some cloud giants, and most gnomes.

===Chaotic good===
A chaotic good character does whatever is necessary to bring about change for the better, disdains bureaucratic organizations that get in the way of social improvement, and places a high value on personal freedom, not only for oneself but for others as well. Chaotic good characters usually intend to do the right thing, but their methods are generally disorganized and often out of sync with the rest of society. Examples of this alignment include copper dragons, many elves, and unicorns.

===Lawful neutral===
A lawful neutral character typically believes strongly in lawful concepts such as honor, order, rules, and tradition, but often follows a personal code in addition to, or even in preference to, one set down by a benevolent authority. Examples of this alignment include a soldier who always follows orders, a judge or enforcer who adheres mercilessly to the letter of the law, a disciplined monk, and some wizards.

===True neutral===
A neutral character (also called &quot;true neutral&quot;) is neutral on both axes and tends not to feel strongly towards any alignment, or actively seeks their balance. Druids frequently follow this dedication to balance and, under &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; rules, were required to be this alignment. In an example given in the 2nd Edition &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, a typical druid might fight against a band of marauding gnolls, only to switch sides to save the gnolls&#x27; clan from being totally exterminated. Examples of this alignment include lizardfolk, most druids, and many humans.

===Chaotic neutral===
A chaotic neutral character is an individualist who follows their own heart and generally shirks rules and traditions. Although chaotic neutral characters promote the ideals of freedom, it is their own freedom that comes first; good and evil come second to their need to be free. Examples of this alignment include many barbarians and rogues, and some bards.

===Lawful evil===
A lawful evil character sees a well-ordered system as being necessary to fulfill their own personal wants and needs, using these systems to further their power and influence. Examples of this alignment include tyrants, devils, corrupt officials, undiscriminating mercenary types who have a strict code of conduct, blue dragons, and hobgoblins.

===Neutral evil===
A neutral evil character is typically selfish and has no qualms about turning on allies-of-the-moment, and usually makes allies primarily to further their own goals. A neutral evil character has no compunctions about harming others to get what they want, but neither will they go out of their way to cause carnage or mayhem when they see no direct benefit for themselves. Another valid interpretation of neutral evil holds up evil as an ideal, doing evil for evil&#x27;s sake and trying to spread its influence. Examples of the first type are an assassin who has little regard for formal laws but does not needlessly kill, a henchman who plots behind their superior&#x27;s back, or a mercenary who readily switches sides if made a better offer. An example of the second type would be a masked killer who strikes only for the sake of causing fear and distrust in the community. Examples of this alignment include many drow, some cloud giants, and yugoloths.

===Chaotic evil===

A chaotic evil character tends to have no respect for rules, other people&#x27;s lives, or anything but their own desires, which are typically selfish and cruel. They set a high value on personal freedom, but do not have much regard for the lives or freedom of other people. Chaotic evil characters do not work well in groups because they resent being given orders and usually do not behave themselves unless there is no alternative. Examples of this alignment include higher forms of undead (such as liches), violent killers who strike for pleasure rather than profit, demons, red dragons, and orcs.

===Unaligned===
Creatures not sapient enough to make decisions based on moral choices, but operating purely on instinct, are described as &quot;unaligned&quot;. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil: they have no alignment. The use of &quot;unaligned&quot; for creatures was introduced in the 4th edition, and retained in 5th edition.

==Legacy==
The &quot;D&amp;D&quot; alignment system is occasionally referenced as a system of moral classification in other contexts. &quot;Salon&quot; television critic Heather Havrilesky, while reviewing the HBO television series &quot;True Blood&quot;, analyzed the program&#x27;s characters in terms of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; alignments and identified protagonist Sookie Stackhouse as chaotic good, her vampire boyfriend Bill Compton as lawful neutral, Eric Northman as lawful evil, and Lafayette Reynolds as chaotic neutral. In &quot;Hostiles and Calamities&quot;, the 11th episode of season 7 of &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; television series, the character Eugene Porter makes a reference to the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; alignment system when describing himself as &quot;...not good. I’m not lawful, neutral, or chaotic.&quot; The alignment chart Internet meme humorously categorizes various items—often characters from works of pop culture—in a three-by-three grid.

The system has also been used in research into how people create virtual avatars in the digital world. For example, the computer role-playing game &quot;Neverwinter Nights 2&quot; inherits the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; alignment system and researchers have used the &quot;NW2&quot; avatar creation process to show that American undergraduate students tend to select avatars that are similar to their own moral values.

Zachary Pilon, for &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot;, commented that alignment in 5th Edition &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; is now &quot;more of a storytelling tool&quot; than something with &quot;mechanical benefits&quot;, adding that &quot;the history of the mechanic means that Wizards of the Coast is unlikely to ever remove it in entirely, but the current nine options are outdated and should either be improved or changed outright&quot;. Pilon highlighted that &quot;the variety of ways each individual alignment can be interpreted or justified can lead to a single character being viewed as several alignments, with each being just as appropriate as the other. While this is alright when it comes to placing favorite movie or anime characters on the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; alignment chart, the individual interpretation of in-game alignments means players can be upset with where a Dungeon Master places their character or how the setting applies an objective morality to what is a subjective view of morals and ethics&quot;. Pilon suggested that the more complex alignment system from Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s &quot;&quot; – five colors of mana with 32 unique combinations which correspond to various outlooks – could be adapted to &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; in order to update the alignment system.

Since 2018, the alignment system has also been popularized as an Internet meme, with users making their own alignment charts to humorously categorize objects, fictional characters, celebrities, animals, and even abstract concepts. Online communities have also been made around the meme, such as r/AlignmentCharts, a subreddit dedicated to sharing and creating alignment charts that apply the format to many different themes.

<doc id="904831" wikidata="Q950180" url="?curid=904831" title="The Speakeasy Club">
<text>The Speakeasy Club, also known as The Speak, was a club situated at 48 Margaret Street, London, England, and was a popular late-night meeting place for the music industry from 1966 to June 1978. The club took its name and theme from the speakeasies of the American Prohibition era. The club was owned by Iraqi-born entrepreneur David Shamoon, along with Blaises and The Revolution Club.

==History==
The Speakeasy club was launched on 15th December 1966 under the management of Roy Flynn. Roy had previously been the main artist booker for the Bryan Morrison Agency and NEMS Enterprises. Jim Carter-Fea was also instated in management. The initial house DJ was Mike Vesty who had worked for Blaises. Two years later in September 1968 the Speakeasy was burned down. After this it changed management. Tony Howard then took over with Laurie O&#x27;Leary. Laurie O&#x27;Leary who was a lifelong friend of the Kray twins and former PR of the Sybillas discoteque in Mayfair, London, became the promoter and publicity manager for the club. 

==Clientele==
The Speakeasy was frequented by record industry and artist agency executives. It also attracted bands who played for low fees in the hope of being spotted and form the basis of the then emerging British rock scene. The club also attracted international touring bands and established artists.

==Musicians==
Musicians and bands who played at the club (often after recording sessions) include Elton John, Cockney Rebel, The Rolling Stones, The Crazy World Of Arthur Brown, Pink Floyd (who first appeared on 19 September 1967), Arthur Lee and Love, King Crimson, The Marmalade, The Mothers of Invention (October 1967), Yes, Jimi Hendrix (1966), David Bowie, Deep Purple (10 July 1969), The Velvet Underground (6 October 1971, Loaded Tour), Bob Marley (May 1973 Catch a Fire Tour), Jeff Beck, Reg Isidore, Ginger Baker, Jan Hammer, The Gass and Bobby Tench.

==Legacy==
The Who refer to the club in their album &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; (&quot;Speakeasy, drink easy, pull easy&quot;) (1967), referencing the club in the &quot;Radio London/Speakeasy/Rotosound Strings&quot; commercial insert for the same album. Elvis Costello mentioned the club in his song &quot;London&#x27;s Brilliant Parade&quot;, included on the album &quot;Brutal Youth&quot; (1994). The Beatles also threw a party for The Monkees during their 1967 visit to England, which later became the basis for the song &quot;Randy Scouse Git&quot;. The Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band filmed a promo in 1967 at the club for their song Equestrian Statue.

<doc id="904833" wikidata="Q744091" url="?curid=904833" title="Charles Malapert">
<text>Charles Malapert (1581–1630) was a Jesuit writer, astronomer and proponent of Aristotelian cosmology, from the Spanish Netherlands. He was considered one of the intellectual champions of the Roman Catholic Church. He used observations of comets and stars of the southern sky to attack the hypotheses of Copernicus and Galileo.

He is also known for observations of sunspots and of the lunar surface, and the crater Malapert on the Moon is named after him.

Malapert was born at Mons. He worked closely with the Jesuit Alexius Sylvius Polonus in at the Jesuit College in Kalisz and at the University of Douai.

In 1630, Malapert was called to Spain to occupy a newly created chair in the Jesuit Colegio Imperial de Madrid. However, he fell ill during the journey and died in Vitoria-Gasteiz shortly after his arrival in Spain. Sylvius continued on.

Apart from being an astronomer and a mathematician, Malapert also wrote Latin poems and theatre plays that became modest bestsellers during the 17th century.

<text>In cricket, the toss is the flipping of a coin to determine which captain will have the right to choose whether their team will bat or field at the start of the match.

Before play begins, the captain of each side will inspect the pitch. Based on the pitch and weather conditions, the captains select their final eleven players. If the pitch is soft or dusty, the captain will tend to select more spin bowlers; if the pitch is hard, the choice tends to favor fast bowlers at the expense of spinners.

Half an hour before the start of play, the two captains convene and exchange team selection sheets. This lists the composition of each side, which cannot be changed for the duration of the match, other than in the case of a concussion substitute. Then, with the supervision of the umpires, a coin is tossed to determine which captain will have the right to choose whether to bat or field. The home team&#x27;s captain tosses the coin while the visiting team&#x27;s captain calls heads or tails. The decision by the winner off the toss as to whether to bat or bowl first is of great tactical importance, and the captain will have considered many variables before arriving at their decision. Because of the different natures of the games, it is considerably more common to choose to bat second in one-day cricket than it is in Test cricket due to batting conditions being difficult in 4th Innings.

In 2004, the International Cricket Council clarified the definition of when matches have deemed to commence and stated the toss is the official start of a match. Therefore a match abandoned at any time after the toss stands as a match played and enters statistical records. If a match is abandoned before the toss, it is not considered to have been played at all and does not count for records. The toss may be delayed, for example, due to bad weather.

The traditional method of the tossing of a coin in test match cricket has been practiced in the 141 years of Test cricket history from the inaugural test match in 1877.

== Scrapping the coin toss ==
In 2018, the International Cricket Council (ICC) proposed the scrapping of the traditional coin toss in Test cricket matches, citing instances when host nations were criticised for, and sometimes found guilty of, changing the pitch conditions to suit themselves when playing this longest format of the game. The ICC proposed instead that the away (visiting) team should be given the right to choose whether to bat first or field first. The ICC announced that this would be implemented in the 2019 Ashes series between Australia and England, giving Australia (the away team) the comparative advantage to either bat first or field first.

In an ICC committee meeting in May 2018, the ICC announced that the traditional method of the coin toss in test cricket would be retained, as it is an &quot;integral part&quot; of the sport that also &quot;forms part of the narrative of the game&quot;.

Between 2016 and 2019 in the English County Championship there was no mandatory toss, with the away side having the choice to field first. If the away side declined to field first, the toss still took place.

For the 2018–19 Big Bash League season in Australia, the toss was replaced by a bat flip, with &quot;hills and flats&quot; used instead of heads or tails.

==Batting first==
If the team is uncertain about the nature of the pitch or simply wants to play safe, they often bat first. If the opposition bowling is strong, batting first is often considered a good option. Sometimes the nature of the pitch deteriorates while the game progresses, making batting more difficult especially if facing spin bowling. Another advantage of batting first is that the batting team sets a target for the team batting second to chase. This can create pressure on the team&#x27;s batsmen and cause problems for the team batting second.

==Batting second==
The captain opts to bat second if he is confident that their team can successfully chase any total. Once the target is known, the team does not have to worry about setting a winnable score. The team just has to limit the opposition to a low score, and bat well to successfully chase the target. If the pitch does not deteriorate, batting second is usually a better option.
Another advantage of batting second is during day-night One Day International games, played under lights. In some venues, the cricket ball collects a lot of dew in the outfield. This results in a poor grip on the ball by the bowlers. With a moist ball, it is difficult to spin and swing the ball. The difficulty in holding the ball also means that the bowler is more likely to be inaccurate, giving the batsmen more ill-directed deliveries to hit.

==Influence of toss on outcome==
Winning the toss provides a small, but significant improvement to a team&#x27;s chances of winning, at least in longer formats of the game at the international level.

Based on the 2,502 Men&#x27;s Test matches played up to 16 April 2023:

Based on the 2045 Men&#x27;s T20I matches played up to 16 April 2023:

==History==
In the first known code of laws published in 1744, the side winning the toss had the choice of the pitch that was to be used as well as whether to bat first. In the 1774 code, this was changed, the visiting team to have the choice of both the pitch and whether to bat first. By about 1809, the modern practice had been adopted, with the choice of pitch left to the umpires and the toss determining which side had the choice of whether to bat first.

<doc id="904847" wikidata="Q475655" url="?curid=904847" title="Leon Golub">
<text>Leon Golub (January 23, 1922 – August 8, 2004) was an American painter. He was born in Chicago, Illinois, where he also studied, receiving his BA at the University of Chicago in 1942, and his BFA and MFA at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1949 and 1950, respectively.

He was married to and collaborated with the artist Nancy Spero (August 24, 1926 – October 18, 2009). Their son Stephen Golub was an economics professor at Swarthmore College. Their son Philip Golub is Professor of International and Comparative Politics at the American University of Paris and was a longstanding contributing editor of the influential journal &quot;Le Monde diplomatique&quot;. Their youngest son Paul Golub is a theater director and acting teacher working in France.

== Early life ==
Born in Chicago in 1922, Golub received his B.A. in Art History from the University of Chicago in 1942. Then he was enlisted in the army. From 1947 to 1949, he studied under the G.I. Bill at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC). The student body included a large number of vets, including Golub’s one-time flatmate Cosmo Campoli, George Cohen, Theodore Halkin and Seymour Rosofsky, whose work often reflected the horrors of war, as well as the uncertainties of the Cold War and Nuclear age. It was at SAIC that he met the artist Nancy Spero, to whom he was married for nearly fifty years. Golub helped organize and showed in the seminal Momentum Exhibitions of 1948–1949, put together by SAIC and Institute of Design students in protest over their exclusion from the Art Institute’s prestigious &quot;Annual Exhibition by Artists of Chicago and Vicinity.&quot; He was also featured, along with Campoli, Halkin and Rosofsky, in the Art Institute’s &quot;Veteran&#x27;s Exhibition&quot; of 1948. The group included, in addition to Golub’s aforementioned classmates, June Leaf, H.C. Westermann, Irving Petlin, Evelyn Statsinger, Don Baum, and Arthur Lerner.

In Chicago, Golub became involved with other artists collectively dubbed the &quot;Monster Roster&quot; by critic Franz Schulze in the late 1950s, based on their affinity for sometimes gruesome, expressive figuration, fantasy and mythology, and existential thought. They believed that an observable connection to the external world and to actual events was essential if art was to have any relevance to the viewer or society. This is a view that informed Golub&#x27;s work throughout his career.

Golub, and the group, gained notice in the 1950s, when art historian and curator Peter Selz featured him, Campoli and Cohen in a 1955, &quot;ARTnews&quot; article, &quot;Is There a New Chicago School?&quot;, and included him, Campoli and Westermann in the 1959 Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) exhibition, &quot;New Images of Man&quot;, as examples of vanguard expressive figurative work in Europe and the United States. In later years, the Monster Roster would be regarded as forerunners to the more widely known Chicago Imagists.

== Career ==
Golub, who always painted in a figural style, drew upon diverse representations of the body from ancient Greek and Roman sculpture, to photographs of athletic competitions, to gay pornography; often pulled directly from a huge database he assembled of journalistic images from the mass media. He likened his painting process to sculptural technique and employed a method of layering and scraping away paint, sometimes using a meat cleaver, leaving varying amounts of canvas untouched.

From 1959 through 1964, Golub and his wife, artist Nancy Spero opted to live in Paris, a move occasioned in part by the belief that Europe would be more receptive to their work dealing overtly with issues of power, sexual and political. During this period Golub&#x27;s work increased in size because of larger available studio space and the inspiration of the French tradition of large-scale history painting. He also switched from using lacquer to acrylics, left more of the surface unpainted, and began to grind the paint directly into the canvas. While in Italy for the year of 1956, both Golub and Spero were profoundly influenced by the figurative works of Etruscan and Roman art, whose narratives addressed ancient themes of power and violence.

When Golub returned to New York State from Paris in 1964, the Vietnam War was escalating, and he responded with his two series: Napalm and Vietnam, works that show the vulnerability of the body while also demonstrating the power of modern weapons. Golub&#x27;s work for his Vietnam paintings were at first titled Assassins, eventually being changed to not attribute the intention of the soldiers. One of his longest works would include that of &quot;Vietnam II&quot;, with it stretching over twelve meters. He and Spero became active with &quot;Artists and Writers Protest&quot;, &quot;the first such group to take a public stand against the war&quot;. This group would be centered around the organization of anti war activities. In 1967, as part of the group&#x27;s &quot;Angry Arts Week&quot;, Golub organized &quot;The Collage of Indignation&quot;, a collaborative work by over 150 artists which he described as &quot;not political art, but rather an expression of popular revulsion.&quot;

Golub had a career breakthrough that same year when he was selected to exhibit five paintings at the Museum of Modern Art&#x27;s &quot;New Images of Man&quot; show in New York City. His work was included alongside that of such established and rising artists as Willem de Kooning, Francis Bacon and Jackson Pollock.

In the mid-1970s, Golub was beset with self-doubt caused by a lack of interest in his work. Between the years of 1974 to 1976, Golub would cut up and destroy many works he produced up to this period and nearly abandoned painting. In the late seventies, however, over the course of three years he would produce more than a hundred portraits of public figures, with sixty of those portraits having been completed between February and September 1976. His interest in creating these portraits would stem from a resemblance between a young Gerald Ford and a soldier from one of his works, &quot;Vietnam III.&quot; Among the portraits were political and military leaders, dictators, and religious figures. &quot;Leon Golub: Paintings, 1950-2000&quot; includes several portraits of Nelson Rockefeller and Ho Chi Minh, along with images of Fidel Castro, Francisco Franco, Richard Nixon, and Henry Kissinger. Some of these portraits were included in the display &#x27;Leon Golub: Political Portraits&#x27; (2016) at the National Portrait Gallery, London.

In the 1980s, Golub turned his attention to terrorism in a variety of forms, from the subversive operations of governments to urban street violence. Killing fields, torture chambers, bars, and brothels became inspiration and subject for work that dealt with such themes as violent aggression, racial inequality, gender ambiguity, oppression, and exclusion. Among the work produced in this period are the series &quot;Mercenaries&quot;, &quot;Interrogation&quot;, &quot;Riot&quot;, and &quot;Horsing Around&quot;. His &quot;Interrogation II&quot; (1981; Art Institute of Chicago) is representative of the subject from this period and Golub&#x27;s technique, &quot;the canvas painted, scraped and repainted many times to create a tense, skinlike surface.&quot;

From the nineties to his death, Golub&#x27;s work shifted toward the illusionistic, with forms semi-visible, and appropriated graphic styles from ancient carvings, medieval manuscripts, and contemporary graffiti. As an older man he began to consider his own mortality, and moved toward themes of separation, loss, and death. Text appeared in many of the paintings combined with a series of symbolic references, including dogs, lions, skulls, and skeletons.

Golub&#x27;s work was seen in solo exhibitions throughout the world, among them &quot;World Wide&quot; (1991), a Grand Lobby project at the Brooklyn Museum of Art. For &quot;World Wide&quot; the artist created a process, repeated in exhibitions at several other museums, by which he enlarged images and details from his paintings and screened them on transparent sheets of vinyl, hung so that they surround the viewer. He was represented in many group exhibitions and was one of the few white artists included in &quot;Black Male: Representations of Masculinity in Contemporary American Art&quot; at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1994.

In 1996, Golub was given a commission to design a set of stained glass windows for Temple Sholom in Chicago, the four windows depict the life of Joseph. These would be the only stained glass windows Leon Golub ever did. They were fabricated in New York by Victor Rothman and Gene Mallard.

== 2001: renaissance ==

While Leon Golub&#x27;s later works from the 1990s offer more fragmented (in his words &quot;left-over&quot;) reincarnations of his early messages, it is his larger, carved works, vividly depicting power relations that have re-gained attention with the U.S.&#x27;s involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan.

In 2003, Golub revisited his 1959 painting, &quot;Reclining Youth&quot;, part of a series of paintings inspired by friezes at the Great Altar of Zeus in Pergamon. Working with Magnolia Editions, the artist translated the painting into a large-scale [] Jacquard tapestry, his first and only textile work.

==Retrospectives==

From March to May 2015, the Serpentine Gallery in London held a career retrospective which was &quot;spun off&quot; and presented as a three-floor career retrospective at the Manhattan Hauser &amp; Wirth in June 2015. In 2022, the Hall Art Foundation, in Reading, Vermont presented a major survey of approximately 70 Golub works from the Hall and Meyer Collections spanning Golub’s career from 1947 to 2003, which traveled to Kunstmuseum Schloss Derneburg in 2023.

<text>John Cole, 1st Baron Mountflorence (13 October 1709 – 30 November 1767) was an Irish peer and politician.

Born in Dublin, he was the son of John Cole, Member of Parliament for Enniskillen. In 1726 he was admitted to Trinity College Dublin, and four years later returned to the Irish House of Commons as member for his father&#x27;s old seat of Enniskillen, a constituency he represented until his ennoblement. He was also High Sheriff of Fermanagh in 1733. In 1760 Cole was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Mountflorence, of Florence Court in the County of Fermanagh. He took his seat in the Irish House of Lords the following year, and died six years later aged 58. He was succeeded in the barony by his son William Willoughby Cole, who was created Earl of Enniskillen in 1789.

<doc id="904851" wikidata="Q700772" url="?curid=904851" title="Taiwanese People's Party">
<text>The Taiwanese People&#x27;s Party, founded in 1927, was nominally Taiwan&#x27;s first political party, preceding the founding of the Taiwanese Communist Party by nine months. Initially a party with members holding moderate and conservative views, by the time of its banning, on 18 February 1931, it had become a solidly leftist, workers-oriented party. In a political atmosphere increasingly dominated by the rise of Japanese fascism, the party never participated in electoral politics.

==History==
The party grew out of the conflict within the Taiwanese Cultural Association. By the late 1920s that organization had become largely socialist-dominated. A group of its founders met during the first half of 1927 to plan an alternative, more moderate organization. After several of their proposals had been rejected by the Japanese authorities, they finally settled on &quot;Taiwanese People&#x27;s Party&quot; and a much diluted, vaguely worded party program. Specifically the new party officially disavowed any ambition to promote &quot;national struggle&quot; and declared its intention to use legal means to &quot;affirm democratic politics&quot;, establish &quot;reasonable economic organization&quot; and reform &quot;defects in the social institutions&quot;. In terms of policy it advocated the rights of Taiwanese to publish newspapers, the need to teach Taiwanese in public schools, abolition of a system of informers known as Hoko System, removal of the need for passports when travelling to China, and reform of the farmers&#x27; associations and government monopolies.

The party grew quickly. By the end of 1927, it had 15 branches and 456 members; among them, many prominent elites, including landowners, lawyers and doctors. However, the vague party charter soon presented problems: on the one hand the charter had apparently managed to placate the wary authorities; on the other, the vague wording had the effect of hiding away some of the divisive ideological differences among the most powerful players. During the party&#x27;s short existence its internal politics was dominated by the struggle between the left-wing, led by Chiang Wei-shui, and the right-wing, represented by , to define the party&#x27;s core values, particularly its position on &quot;the class question&quot;. Whereas Chiang&#x27;s faction sought to define the party as representing the interests of workers and peasants, Peng&#x27;s faction took the moderate position of &quot;working to improve their quality of life&quot;. After Chiang set up the as a party affiliate in February 1928, Peng resigned in protest. In August 1930 a number of conservatives left the party to form the , led by Lin Hsien-tang and .

By the third party congress later that year, Chiang had won control of the executive committee. His proposal for a revision of the party charter was passed the following year. It admonished &quot;bourgeois&quot; and &quot;reactionary&quot; members for not heeding the international climate, which had &quot;strengthened the consciousness of struggle within the island&#x27;s masses&quot;. The revised charter characterized the party as one to work toward the political freedom and interests of workers, peasants, the urban proletariat, and all similarly oppressed. Chiang believed that the time was ripe for a strategy that combined class and national (anti-colonial) movements.

For the most part, the party was not effective in achieving its goals. On 7 July 1927 it put forward a &quot;Statement of Recommendations&quot;, given to Prime Minister Hamaguchi Osachi, that demanded local autonomy for the island and urged freedom of speech. The following year, it demanded that the colonial governor institute popular, proportionally representative ballot for some councils. Its singular triumph was in forcing the authorities to set aside budget for establishing treatment centers for opium addicts. The party successfully created international pressure by filing complaints to the League of Nations (of which Japan remained a member until the early 1930s), which then sent a representative to investigate.

As civilian rule gave way to a new, harsher phase of all-consuming militarism in Taiwan and elsewhere in the Japanese colonies, the fate of the party was sealed. Ironically the result was essentially as Peng Hua-ying had predicted in his objection to Chiang&#x27;s more radical vision: As soon as the fourth party congress passed the revised charter, the authorities proceeded to ban the organization. Chiang Wei-shui and other party leaders were arrested. In its statement the authorities accused &quot;leftist, nationalist members&quot; of controlling the party and secretly working on independence for the colony, as well as alerting the international community of Japan&#x27;s use of chemical warfare in suppressing the Musha Rebellion of 1930. Chiang himself came to be disillusioned with legitimate political means of reform. After his death in August 1931 from typhoid, the party fell into disarray and later disbanded.

==Platform==

The party program of the TPP was socialist, emphasizing constitutional democracy and separation of power with a new Taiwanese constitution. The party had a radical economic program aiming at redistributing land to peasants and removing big landlords, abolishing big bourgeoisie and privileged classes in Taiwan, and implementing socialist programs to nationalize big companies and improve workers&#x27; rights. It also included the liberation of the Taiwanese people and regaining Taiwanese sovereignty from the Empire of Japan. Those programs were heavily inspired by Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s Three Principles of the People.

<text>Lewis Padgett was the joint pseudonym of the science fiction authors and spouses Henry Kuttner and C. L. Moore, taken from their mothers&#x27; maiden names. They also used the pseudonyms Lawrence O&#x27;Donnell and C. H. Liddell, as well as collaborating under their own names.

Writing as &#x27;Lewis Padgett&#x27; they were the author of many humorous short stories of science fiction in the 1940s and 1950s. Among the most famous were:

* The &quot;Gallegher&quot; series of stories, collected in &quot;Robots Have No Tails&quot; (Gnome, 1952):
** &quot;The Proud Robot&quot;
** &quot;Gallegher Plus&quot;
** &quot;The World Is Mine&quot;
** &quot;Ex Machina&quot;
** &quot;Time Locker&quot;
* &quot;Mimsy Were the Borogoves&quot;
* &quot;The Twonky&quot;
* &quot;What You Need&quot;

==Adaptations==
* &quot;The Twonky&quot; was the inspiration for a radio show recording and a full-length film by the same name.
* Episodes of &quot;Tales of Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; were based on the short story &quot;What You Need&quot;.
* In 1976, Caedmon Records released a spoken word album of the short story (TC 1509), narrated by William Shatner.
* The feature film &quot;The Last Mimzy&quot; is loosely based on the short story &quot;Mimsy Were the Borogoves&quot;.

<text>The third umpire (or TV Umpire) is an off-field umpire used in some cricket matches, particularly international matches. Their role is to make the final decision in questions referred to them by the two on-field umpires or the players.

The third umpire is also there to act as an emergency on-field umpire if required.

==History==
The third umpire was the brainchild of Dr Ali Bacher, the former Managing Director of the United Cricket Board of South Africa and Mike Demaine, the senior cricket producer at the South African Broadcasting Television sports department. The idea was conceived in a meeting between Ali Bacher &amp; Mike Demaine at the UCBSA offices in Johannesburg in 1991 &amp; used for the first time in South African domestic cricket competitions that season (with the approval of the ICC). After the successful use of the technology in 1991 the ICC then agreed for the UCBSA and the SABC to use the technology in the television coverage of international matches in South Africa in 1992.

It debuted in Test cricket in November 1992 at Kingsmead, Durban for the South Africa vs. India series. Karl Liebenberg was the third umpire, with Cyril Mitchley the on-field umpire, who referred the run out decision in this match. Sachin Tendulkar became the first batsman to be dismissed (run out) by using television replays in the second day of the Test scoring 11.

==Appointment==

The third umpire is appointed from the Elite Panel of ICC Umpires or the International Panel of ICC Umpires for Test matches, ODIs, and T20Is.

For all Test matches, and for ODIs where DRS is used, the third umpire is appointed by the ICC, and is a different nationality to the two sides. For ODIs where DRS is &quot;not&quot; used, and for all T20Is, the third umpire is appointed by the home side&#x27;s Governing body.

==Functions==

===Decision requests===

An on-field umpire can, at his own discretion, use a radio link to refer particular types of close decision to the third umpire, this is called an Umpire Review. When the full Umpire Decision Review System is &quot;not&quot; in use, the third umpire uses television replays (only) to assist him in coming to a decision.

When the full DRS is in use, players can also initiate reviews of particular decisions by the on-field umpires, this is called a Player Review. These are judged by the third umpire, and the third umpire has the full range of technology available beyond simple replays, for both Umpire Reviews and Player Reviews.

===Emergency on-field umpire===
In the case of injury or illness to one of the on-field umpires, the third umpire will take his place. The third umpire duties will then be taken on by the fourth umpire.

For example, during the 4th ODI between Australia and India at Canberra in 2015–16, umpire Richard Kettleborough was injured during Australia&#x27;s innings and was replaced by third umpire Paul Wilson.

<text>The Twonky is a 1953 independently made American black-and-white science fiction/comedy film, produced by A.D. Nast, Jr., Arch Oboler, and Sidney Pink, written and directed by Arch Oboler, and starring Hans Conried, Gloria Blondell, Billy Lynn, and Edwin Max. The film was distributed by United Artists. 
==Plot==
After seeing his wife (Janet Warren) off on her trip, Kerry West (Hans Conried), a philosophy teacher at a small-town college goes inside his home to contemplate his new purchase: a television set. Sitting down in his office, he places a cigarette in his mouth and is about to light it when a solid beam of light shoots from the television screen, lighting it for him. Absentmindedly unaware of what has taken place, it is only when the television subsequently lights his pipe that West realizes that his television is behaving abnormally.

West soon discovers that the television can walk and perform a variety of functions, including dishwashing, vacuuming, and card-playing. When the television deliveryman (Edwin Max) returns to settle the bill, the television materializes copies of a five-dollar bill in order to provide payment. Yet the television soon exhibits other, more controlling traits, permitting West only a single cup of coffee and breaking West’s classical music records in favor of military marches to which it dances. After West demonstrates the television to his friend Coach Trout (Billy Lynn), the coach declares the television set to be a “twonky”, the word he used as a child to label the inexplicable.

Trout concludes that the Twonky is actually a robot committed to serving West. When he tests this hypothesis by attempting to kick West, the Twonky paralyzes his leg. After tending to the coach, West attempts to write a lecture on the role of individualism in art, but the Twonky hits him with beams that alter his thoughts and censors his reading. When West attempts to give his lecture the next day, he finds himself unable to do more than ramble on about trivialities. Frustrated, West goes to the store from which his wife had ordered the television and demands that they take it back or exchange it.

Meanwhile, at West’s house, the coach summons members of the college&#x27;s football team and orders them to destroy the Twonky. West arrives with the television deliveryman and his replacement set, only to find the players passed out in front of the machine. Upon being awakened by West, they appear to be in a hypnotic state mumbling that they have “no complaints,” a condition the Twonky soon inflicts on the deliveryman as well. Upstairs, Trout theorizes that the Twonky is from a future “super state” that uses such machines to control the population, which the Twonky soon demonstrates by walking into the room and altering his mind so that he no longer believes there to be a problem. As the now-fixed Trout attempts to leave, police storm into the house in response to a call made by the device seeking female companionship for West, followed by Treasury men tracking down the bogus $5 bills manufactured by the set. When the law enforcement officers attempt to arrest West, though, the Twonky places all of them in a trance, and they leave without complaint.

Frustrated, West escapes the house and returns drunk, only to have the Twonky return him to sobriety with a light beam. After his wife returns to see a visiting bill collector driven from their home by the machine, West decides to take action. Luring the device into his car, he attempts to crash it by a variety of means but is frustrated by the Twonky’s ability to control the vehicle. Spotting a vehicle parked alongside the road, West pulls over and abandons his car, hitching a ride from the other driver, an elderly Englishwoman. His relief at having escaped is soon negated by the woman’s erratic driving, and by the discovery that the Twonky was able to hide in the trunk. When the Twonky attempts to stop the woman’s reckless driving, it precipitates a crash that destroys itself.

==Production==
&quot;The Twonky&quot; was based on the 1942 short story by established science fiction writers Henry Kuttner and C. L. Moore, writing under their joint pseudonym Lewis Padgett. It first was published in September 1942 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;. Arch Oboler completed the film in 1951, but it did not find a distributor at the time. After he finished the 3D film &quot;Bwana Devil&quot; (1952), &quot;The Twonky&quot; was finally released by United Artists. Hans Conried, a noted character actor later in his career, had his first leading role in the film.

==Reception==
&quot;The Twonky&quot; did poorly at the box office; critics saw the poor production values as a major problem. When interviewed in 1970, Hans Conried recalled that he told the producer that &quot;The Twonky&quot; would probably bomb at the box-office (which it did), whereupon the producer genially replied &quot;That&#x27;s all right. I need a tax write-off this year anyway.&quot; &quot;The Twonky&quot; is recognized today as a cult film.

<text>Michael Learns to Rock (MLTR) is a Danish soft rock and pop rock band formed in 1988. The band currently consists of Jascha Richter, Mikkel Lentz and Kåre Wanscher. Søren Madsen was an original member of the group since its formation but left in 2000. The band has sold over 11 million records over the course of their career, with the majority sold in Scandinavia and Asia. Despite being Danish, the band performs songs in English. The band has attributed its success in Asia to their drug-free, clean-living image, and to singing in English as a second language.

MLTR has earned gold and platinum status for records in many countries and won many awards, including the Gold Preis Award from RSH, Germany and &quot;The Best Performing Act of the Year&quot; at the SEA Grammy Awards in Singapore. In addition, their song &quot;Take Me to Your Heart&quot; was awarded &quot;most downloaded single of the year 2006&quot; with 6 million or more paid downloads. The band has recorded nine studio albums as well as a number of live and greatest hits albums. Their latest studio album, &quot;Still&quot;, was released on 21 March 2018.

During the peak of their popularity in the mid and late 1990s, MLTR was described by critics as being &quot;as good (if not better) a band as any current big name group out of America or the UK or the Australia.&quot; According to the band&#x27;s record label releases, their sound is &quot;the perfect balance of a Scandinavian glow and the international pop song that has been instrumental in forming the compelling sound of the band&quot;, although the lead singer and songwriter, Jascha Richter, disagrees with this, maintaining that the music defies geographical categorization.

== History ==
===Formation (1988–1992)===
In 1988, singer Jascha Richter with the intent of forming a band to perform his songs, asked his high school friend and drummer Kåre Wanscher in Aarhus, Denmark to perform with him. Realizing the limitations of playing as a duo, they recruited the guitarist Mikkel Lentz, who was then playing rock music with his group the Rocking Studs. On 15 March 1988, their first night of practice made them realize they needed a fourth musician, so they asked Søren Madsen, another guitarist who was into Led Zeppelin, to join in on bass guitar. Although Madsen was not an obvious choice for a pop band, he was invited on the basis that he had been part of the band Hip Hop that had reached the finals of a Danish competition to nominate a song to the Eurovision Song Contest.

Since Richter already had a number of original songs, eliminating the need to jam, they were able to quickly record a demo tape intending it to be sent to the &#x27;Rock Grand Prix&#x27; competition in their hometown Aarhus, they had to hurriedly come up with a name before posting it; Richter wrote as the name of the sender &#x27;Michael Learns to Rock&#x27;, partly inspired by a line from his school English textbook and partly because they were a pop band taking part in a rock concert. Lentz and Richter have admitted that the band was named after Michael Jackson: &quot;I think Richter was thinking of Michael Jackson, because he was called &#x27;the king of pop&#x27; and it was kind of funny, because it was like, what would he sound like if he learned to rock? It was wordplay,&quot; Lentz has stated. Richter claimed in an interview: &quot;Yeah, it was like Johnny Hates Jazz and Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Sure, I&#x27;ve regretted calling ourselves this many times since, but we were successful so quickly, we had to stick with it and over time I got used to it.&quot;

On 22 May 1988, the quartet played their first public show in Aarhus in &#x27;Rock Grand Prix&#x27; at Aarhus&#x27;s biggest venue, Ridehuset. As one of the two winning teams, MLTR performed that summer at the Aarhus Outdoor Festival on 20 June, however, only 20 people turned up. The disappointment was offset by a daily newspaper, &quot;Information&quot;, describing the unknown group as &quot;an immensely positive surprise&quot;. On 30 July 1988, the group entered and won the city&#x27;s famed annual talent shows &#x27;We Have The Stage – Do You Have The Music?&#x27; at Aarhus Musikhus.

Jens Peter (J.P.) Andersen, a member of the contest jury as well as a promoter of Danmarks Smukkeste Festival (literally, &quot;Denmark’s Most Beautiful Festival&quot;) at Skanderborg, was impressed with the band&#x27;s talent but was somewhat annoyed at their lack of professionalism, so he decided to become the band&#x27;s manager, at the band&#x27;s request. Michael Learns to Rock continued playing live throughout Jutland and recording material in order to attract the attention of Danish record labels. One of these efforts included the band contributing four tracks for the double album &quot;Secrets&quot;, a record organised by the Danish Rock Council to create interest in four talented but &#x27;secret&#x27; new bands. They finally signed a record deal with the Danish label Medley in January 1989. However, the band did not release their first album, &quot;Michael Learns to Rock&quot;, until September 1991, backed by the American record label Impact Records and with much of the album including the first American single, &quot;My Blue Angel&quot;, mixed and produced by the American producers Tony Peluso and Steve Barri.

Although not making any headway as intended in America despite airplay for &quot;My Blue Angel&quot;, which did peak at #70 on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; Top 100, a later single (the second in Denmark after &quot;I Still Carry On&quot;) from the album, &quot;The Actor&quot;, topped the Danish chart and also did well in Norway, Sweden, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines. In January 1992, the album topped the Danish charts, followed soon after by success in Asia, selling 25,000 copies and earning gold status in Indonesia alone.

===International breakthrough (1993–1996)===
Encouraged by the performance of their first album, Michael Learns to Rock released a second album, &quot;Colours&quot;, in October 1993 which sold over 1.1 million records. The album included the singles &quot;Sleeping Child&quot;, &quot;25 Minutes&quot; and &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;. The band toured Asia for the first time. At the Phoebus Concert Hall in Bangkok they played to their largest audience until then of 12,000 people. The performance of this album coupled with the band&#x27;s live performances resulted in the band receiving &#x27;The Best Performing Act of the Year&#x27; award in 1994 at SEA Grammy Awards in Singapore for their performance of &quot;25 Minutes&quot;, followed by the &#x27;Gold Preis&#x27; from the German radio station RSH (Radio Schleswig-Holstein) in 1995 for radio hits such as &quot;Wild Women&#x27;&quot; and &quot;25 Minutes&quot;.

In August 1995, Michael Learns to Rock&#x27;s third album &quot;Played on Pepper&quot; was released, selling more than 1.2 million units. Tracks in this album included &quot;That&#x27;s Why (You Go Away)&quot; and &quot;Someday&quot;. For the first time, the band recorded and produced the whole album themselves. To promote the album, the group performed 25 shows in ten countries. The release of this album also increased the band&#x27;s presence in hitherto untapped markets like Brazil, South Africa, the UAE and eleven countries in the Far East, including Japan.

To capitalize on the success of &quot;Played on Pepper&quot; and to curb piracy, Michael Learns to Rock released the greatest hits album &quot;Paint My Love&quot; in October 1996, primarily in Asia; the album sold 3.4 million copies. The song, &quot;Paint My Love&quot;, is an English version of &quot;Kun med dig&quot; by Danish singers Dorthe Andersen and Martin Loft, which was composed by Jascha Richter. The band was also chosen as the headliner for the &#x27;Celebrate Hong Kong&#x27; concert on 6 July 1997, marking the transfer of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to China. The album also topped the charts in South Africa with sales of more than 350,000 copies in South Africa alone.

===Mainstream success in Asia (1997–1999)===
They released their fourth studio album, &quot;Nothing to Lose&quot;, was released in September 1997, and also sold more than 1.1 million copies. In an incident that showcased Michael Learns to Rock&#x27;s popularity in Asia, 20,000 fake tickets were sold (more than twice the number of real ones) for a concert in Hanoi, Vietnam, in December 1997 and while the concert was on, those outside with fake tickets tried to break into the concert hall through the windows causing riot police to be deployed. The band travelled to South Africa in January 1998, playing sell-out concerts in Johannesburg and Pretoria, consequently taking &quot;Nothing to Lose&quot; to the top of the charts in South Africa.

Soon after, the band&#x27;s members took a break to spend time with their families and to develop projects on their own or in collaboration with other performers. They also decided to re-brand the band under the simpler name of MLTR. During the break, Richter wrote some new songs for the band, one of which is &quot;Strange Foreign Beauty&quot; that was later added to the 1999 greatest hits album &quot;Greatest Hits – Strange Foreign Beauty&quot;. In a process undertaken by MLTR for the first time, the song was made by compiling the best details from recordings of ideas made individually by the four members. This album included their previous hits, either remixed or refined in some way by notable international producers such as Chris Lord-Alge (for &quot;Someday&quot;, &quot;Something You Should Know&quot; etc.), Cutfather &amp; Joe (for &quot;Sleeping Child&quot;) and the Swedish producer Per Magnusson (for the MLTR top hit &quot;The Actor&#x27;&quot;). This greatest hits album went to the top of the Danish sales charts (the second MLTR album after their first album to do so), as well in Sweden and Portugal, and logged sales of nearly a million copies.

===Continuing as a trio (2000–2006)===
In 2000, Søren Madsen decided to leave the group to embark on a solo career. The remaining three members set themselves the challenge of pursuing a sound different from that of their previous albums and thus produced the album &quot;Blue Night&quot;, which almost went platinum in Denmark and sold well in Asia, with sales over one million. The following year a biography of MLTR, &quot;Something You Should Know&quot; written by Poul Martin-Bonde, was published along with a few previously unreleased recordings. The English translation of the book was called &quot;It Never Rains on Bali&quot;, a reference to an incident that took place during the band&#x27;s 1995 Bali concert, where a no-rain forecast proved wrong and the unexpected rain stopped the concert.

After the release of &quot;Blue Night&quot;, the band took a prolonged break, with Richter working on his solo album &quot;Planet Blue&quot;. The band later admitted that they even considered disbanding during this time. They ultimately decided against it, following the success of their greatest hits album releases, including &quot;19 Love Songs / Love Ballads&quot; in 2002, which went to number 2 in Denmark.

In 2004, the band regrouped again, departing from the name MLTR, and using the original name for their sixth album called &quot;Michael Learns to Rock&quot;, released in Asia as &quot;Take Me to Your Heart&quot;. The album focused on the Asian market. The single &quot;Take Me to Your Heart&quot; was a remake of Jacky Cheung&#x27;s &quot;Goodbye Kiss&quot; (&quot;吻别&quot;), and was popular in China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Thailand and Taiwan. By the end of 2006 alone, the single created a record when it sold over 6 million paid downloads and was awarded the &quot;Most Downloaded Single of the Year 2006&quot;. MLTR sang an English and Chinese duet of &quot;Take Me to Your Heart&quot; with the Chinese singer Hu Yanbin at a 2005 New Year&#x27;s Party in Guangzhou, China. The band also sang the song with the South Korean star Shin Hye-sung, lead vocalist of the famous boy band Shinhwa. This album has been one of the major successes of MLTR in Asia, especially China.

===Independent label; MLTR Music (2007–2013)===
In 2007, MLTR performed at the Formula1 in Shanghai and The 6th Golden Eagle Award Ceremony. Later in the year, MLTR released &quot;The Best of Michael Learns to Rock Live&quot; and in July toured Hong-Kong, Taiwan, Thailand and Malaysia. Elsewhere, this album was released as &quot;The Live Musical Adventures of Michael Learns to Rock / I Walk This Road Alone&quot;, and featured live recordings from their Take Me to Your Heart Asian Tour, mainly from the September 2005 concerts in India.

In November 2008, MLTR released their seventh studio album titled &quot;Eternity&quot; under their own independent label, MLTR Music, in association with the Danish label At:tack. This album has the distinction of being the first MLTR album to be produced solely by Mikkel Lentz. The band mention on their website that the name is an indication of the fact that &quot;the band plan to make music for as long as they still find joy in the process&quot;. Although the sales were slow (admittedly, according to the band), the second single from the album, &quot;Sweetest Surprise&quot; reached No. 1 in Thailand within a few weeks of release. The following year, another track, &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Make Sense&quot;, gained popularity in Asia after it was played as the farewell song on the Philippine reality TV show &quot;Pinoy Big Brother&quot;. The promotion of the album took MLTR on the Eternity South East Asia Tour, the response to which, the band declare, has led them to consider playing more concerts abroad, especially in Southeast Asia.

Michael Learns to Rock completed touring their home-country Denmark, having played unplugged concerts in February and March 2010 with fair success. In June 2010, the band undertook a three-city promotional tour of India playing shows at Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore to promote the latest album &quot;Eternity&quot;. More Unplugged shows followed in Denmark in late 2010. The band also did a short promotional tour of China and Macau from 27 September to 1 October 2010 for their upcoming China concerts in December 2010 and to give a preview of their Chinese Tour Compilation CD. This was followed up with their first ever international Unplugged concerts at Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou in December 2010. The track &quot;Fairy Tale&quot;, an English cover version of a song originally performed by singer Li Jian, and later popularized by Hong Kong pop diva Faye Wong, was released in conjunction with the CD release. Following this, the band was scheduled to play another unplugged tour in Denmark in spring 2011.

In a blog, dated 13 April 2010 on the band&#x27;s website, the band announced that they have started working on their next album. Over the latter part of 2010 and throughout 2011, Michael Learns to Rock began giving feelers about their next studio album on their official Facebook page. The album which was till then not named, was set to be released on 11 August 2011 in Europe and Denmark, with releases following in other territories around the same time, but was subsequently postponed to an unspecified later date. In a teaser Facebook update, the band revealed the name of one of the tracks to be &quot;Ice Breaker&quot;. Elsewhere, in a note on his Facebook Page, Jascha Richter had revealed the name of another song, &quot;Hanging On&quot;, from the forthcoming album.

On 19 November 2011, the band unveiled the song &quot;Any Way You Want It&quot; from the forthcoming album at a live concert in Kathmandu produced and organized by ODC Network (P)LTD. The band also shot footage in and around Kathmandu and during the performance of the song, to include it on the song&#x27;s music video. The video of the song was then released formally on 11 June 2012 by the band on YouTube first, and soon after, it started airing on TV in India and Nepal.

The studio album &quot;Scandinavia&quot; was released on 11 June 2012 in India digitally by Virgin Records on Nokia Music. Subsequently, release of the physical CD of album took place in many Asian countries, namely India (30 June 2012), Malaysia (2 July), Singapore (4 July), Thailand (12 July), Korea (12 July), Taiwan (13 July), Hong Kong (17 July), Philippines (19 July), Indonesia (15 August), and then in China. The album was released in Denmark by Sony Music Denmark on 3 September 2012. The album was also made available in Asia on iTunes. As in the case of the previous album &quot;Eternity&quot;, the album &quot;Scandinavia&quot; was also solely produced by Mikkel Lentz.

The first single from &quot;Scandinavia&quot;, &quot;Renovate My Life&quot;, was released on iTunes on 9 June 2012, going on air in Denmark from 11 June. The album release began on 11 June 2012, with the release of a music video for &quot;Any Way You Want It&quot; on YouTube, as well as the digital release of the album in India. The music video features different places of Kathmandu valley and the capital city of Nepal, where the band performed a concert in November 2011. The physical CD of &quot;Scandinavia&quot; was first released on 30 June 2012 in India by Virgin Records, by Warner Music during July in Southeast Asia, and by Sony Music on 3 September 2012 in Denmark.

===25th anniversary, side projects, new album (2014–2020)===
In 2014, the group released &quot;25: The Complete Singles&quot; in commemoration of the band&#x27;s 25th anniversary, released on 25 October 2014, which included two new studio recordings. The first single, &quot;Silent Times&quot; was released on 16 September 2014, followed by &quot;Call on Love&quot;, released on 18 December 2014. The band also recorded &quot;Eternal Love&quot;, the theme song of the Korean drama series, &quot;Healer&quot;. The song was written by Lee Sang Joon, Denzil &quot;DR&quot; Remedios, and Ryan Jhun Sewon. In 2015, the group released the single &quot;I&#x27;ll Wait for You&quot; on 6 November 2015. In 2016, they released the single &quot;We Shared the Night&quot; on 5 February 2016, their Valentine&#x27;s Day gift to their fans.

The song &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Make Sense&quot; from the album &quot;Eternity&quot; was featured in the Indian film &quot;Welcome M1LL10NS&quot;, directed by Milroy Goes, in which Mikkel Lentz contributed the background score to the film. The film was filmed in the states of Goa and Punjab. It was also contested at the 91st Academy Awards and qualified at Oscars 2019 in the General Category.

The band had been working on their new record over the course of 2017 and into early 2018. In late January 2018, the band organized a competition over their social media platforms for the title of their upcoming album. Over the course of the week, they released the titles of the songs slated to be released through their new record. On 2 February 2018, the band released a new single titled &quot;Everything You Need&quot;.

After the contest, the band announced its winner, as well as the title of their ninth studio album, &quot;Still&quot;. Released on 21 March 2018 through all digital music platforms successfully and on limited number of special physical copies, the album features songs that sound like &quot;Michael Learns to Rock but it sounds like today,&quot; according to Wanscher.

== Touring ==
As of September 2010, Michael Learns to Rock have played over 450 shows, including both large and small open-air &amp; closed-hall stage concerts, TV appearances, unplugged and sing-back gigs, over a period of 22 years. In total, MLTR have played in at least 21 countries and territories which include Denmark, Nepal, Indonesia, China, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, South Africa, Switzerland, Bangladesh, UAE, Faroe Islands, Vietnam, Cambodia, Norway, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Papua New Guinea and Sweden. They have also traveled to Hollywood for recording part of their debut album, to Spain, Finland and Germany to attend interviews, and to the UK to shoot a video. In Asia, MLTR are one of the few artists to have played more than once in a country and to have still sustained an audience turn-out comparable to that of their earlier appearances.

Michael Learns to Rock were also the first international act to have performed in Cambodia when they played a show (that was also televised live) in front of 700 fans in CTN&#x27;s Studio One in Phnom Penh in October 2005. The alternative version of their live album called &quot;The Live Musical Adventures of Michael Learns to Rock-I Walk This Road Alone&quot; features 14 live audio recordings mostly from their September 2005 show at Shillong, India, and a few video recordings from other live shows in Asia.

In various interviews, the band members have admitted that touring and the response from fans to their concerts, among other reasons, keep them together, in spite of the stresses associated with traveling. In a recent interview Mikkel Lentz said, &quot;The reason we stay together is because it makes sense. Our fans come to our shows and we still enjoy playing and travelling, so why should we stop? There is also the pleasure of making music, even though sometimes things like television shows or interviews can become a little boring.&quot; Kåre Wanscher has also said in an interview that the highest points of their career have been when they were out touring Asia over the last few years.

MLTR toured China in December 2010, playing unplugged concerts. The 2011 spring leg of the Danish tour started on 17 February 2011 and ended on 12 March 2011 with MLTR playing gigs in most of the Danish cities and towns, many of which were sold out. MLTR then completed their first full-production concert tour after their extended unplugged stint by playing on 22 April 2011 at Penang, 24 April 2011 at Kuala Lumpur and 30 April 2011 at Kuantan in Malaysia.

The Summer tour commenced on 11 August 2011 with the band playing in Skanderborg, and later on 12 August 2011 at Aarhus and on 13 August at Aabenraa.

The band played on 19 November 2011 for the first time ever in Kathmandu, Nepal at the Tudikhel Ground, as the headliners of Nepal Rocks. The band were only the second internationally acclaimed band to play in Nepal, after the Canadian artist Bryan Adams did so earlier in the year. They also performed in Dhaka, Bangladesh on 22 June 2012 and in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia on 7 and 8 December 2012.

The band is the first to stream their 25th anniversary concert live to a global audience, using the Subcell smartphone app. The concert was broadcast live in sound and video from the Skanderborg Smukfest festival in Denmark on 11 August 2013. In Asia, their MLTR 25 Tour was staged in the Philippines on 19 September 2015.

On 13 December 2015, MLTR performed live for the first time in North East India&#x27;s prehistoric ancient city of Guwahati (earlier known as Pragjyotishpur) in Assam in front of a 75,000 strong audience at the huge Sarusajai Stadium, in company of multiple award-winning popular Assamese-Indian singer-composer Jim Ankan Deka. The musical night was inaugurated with multilingual performances by Jim Ankan Deka and his music band VooDoo Child, wherein they sang their own compositions of Assamese and English songs. The attendance in the show was unprecedented in the city of Guwahati so far.

On 31 August 2017, MLTR&#x27;s first stop in their Eternal Asia Tour was staged at the Kia Theatre in Manila to a sold-out crowd.

In October 2022, the band played in the cities of Manila, Cebu, and Davao as part of their Back on The Road Tour 2022 in the Philippines.

On 18 July 2024, it was announced that MLTR will be holding the Asia Tour 2024 where the band will be performing in multiple countries such as Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam throughout November 2024.

== Musical style and influences ==
Michael Learns to Rock infuses soft rock and ballads and follows a basic verse-chorus song-form (which is typical of most pop songs) with lyrics comprising straight forward and short-length phrasing incorporating very basic sentence constructions. The verses consist of either one or two couplets and the chorus often contrasts the verse melodically, rhythmically, and harmonically, assuming a higher level of dynamics and activity. The essence of this style followed invariably by MLTR is evident from Jascha Richter&#x27;s dead-pan response to a query in an interview as to what constituted the elements of a good song: &quot;You got to have a chorus and a verse&quot;. Many songs incorporate a bridge section following the second chorus section (most notably &quot;25 Minutes&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s Why (You Go Away)&quot;, &quot;Someday&quot;, &quot;Paint My Love&quot;, &quot;Blue Night&quot; etc.). Many songs also contain instrumental solos, more commonly, guitar (e.g. &quot;Someday&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s Why (You Go Away)&quot;, &quot;How Many Hours&quot;, &quot;The Actor&quot;, &quot;Something You Should Know&quot;, &quot;Breaking My Heart&quot;, &quot;Watch Your Back&quot; etc.) and sometimes the keyboard (e.g. &quot;Messages&quot;), following the second chorus or following the bridge, in case the latter is present. Vocal harmonies also constitute a common feature of their songs.

Lentz admits that they never really jam to come out with or develop upon a song and most of MLTR&#x27;s songs are written and composed by Richter on the piano. According to Richter, however, after he has written the song, Lentz takes the ideas further and makes it into a final production. Lentz insists that MLTR do not fit to any genre of music except for having a classic pop-sound. Further, he believes the secret behind MLTR&#x27;s sustained music career is the non-conformance to any musical trends; &quot;We never tried to follow trends. I think that&#x27;s the reason we are still around. There&#x27;s been trip hop, grunge, pop. We never fitted into these trends. What seems to be tough then is now our strength. They&#x27;re just songs. The songs don&#x27;t belong to a musical wave.&quot;

Michael Learns to Rock have cited their influences to be Supertramp, Elton John, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Stevie Wonder, Billy Joel, ABBA, Bee Gees and &quot;all the bands that write good lyrics&quot; (as Mikkel Lentz puts it tongue-in-cheek). Lentz, however, denies the influence of Michael Jackson in their music.

However, Richter revealed on his Facebook page in response to a fan&#x27;s query that Michael Jackson&#x27;s music did influence their music, especially the latter&#x27;s &quot;Bad&quot; album which was released in the year preceding MLTR&#x27;s formation. Also, Richter has cited Talk Talk, a-ha and Eurythmics to be his influences. A-ha&#x27;s international success, in spite of originating from the small Scandinavian country of Norway, instilled the self-belief in the MLTR members that even they, hailing from a similarly small Scandinavian country (Denmark), could carve out a career for themselves in international music.

Despite being branded simplistic, easy-listening and sometimes, down-right cheesy, banal or even naive by many, Michael Learns to Rock maintain that these are the very qualities of their lyrics and music which have found favour with Asian music listeners.

Only habitable buildings are ranked, which excludes radio masts and towers, observation towers, temples, chimneys, and other tall architectural structures.

The era of skyscrapers in India began with the completion of the LIC Building in Chennai in 1959. With 12 floors initially, it was the first skyscraper in the country and remained the tallest building in the country until 1961, when it was surpassed by the 25-story Usha Kiran Building in Mumbai. Many taller buildings have appeared in various cities in the country ever since. Palais Royale in Mumbai had structurally topped out in 2018 as the tallest building in the country with a height of 320 meters, but the building is still under construction. Lokhandwala Minerva, also in Mumbai, with a height of and 78 floors, is the tallest completed building in the country.
Several taller buildings are under construction, and some are on hold. 

Mumbai has the highest number of skyscrapers and high-rise buildings in India; more than 200 skyscrapers and 5,600 high-rise buildings currently exist in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. Delhi-NCR has also witnessed a massive construction boom in the last 20 years with around 24 skyscrapers and 5,200 high-rise buildings already constructed in the region. Kolkata has 14 existing skyscrapers and around 1,000 completed high-rise buildings. Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Pune, Surat, GIFT City and Kochi also have numerous high-rise buildings.

<text>Fairoaks Airport is a general aviation airport between Chobham and Chertsey in Surrey, England. It is north of Woking and from Junction 11 of the M25 motorway which is between the M3 and A3 junctions.

==History==

Fairoaks opened as a private airstrip in 1931, but was signed up for military use in 1936 and became RAF Fairoaks during World War II. It was used as a training airfield, with No. 18 Elementary &amp; Reserve Flying School being formed on 1 October 1937 equipped with De Havilland Tiger Moths. 6,000 pilots were trained at the airfield, mostly in Tiger Moths. Terence O&#x27;Brien, an Australian pilot, later wrote a series of books about his experiences in the RAF. In &quot;Chasing After Danger&quot;, he recounts doing primary flight training on Tiger Moths at Fairoaks in 1940, when it was still a grass aerodrome.

The unit was re-designated No. 18 Reserve Flying School on 14 May 1947 and was managed by Universal Flying Services. The Tiger Moths were replaced by De Havilland Canada Chipmunks in 1951 but the school was disbanded on 31 July 1953.

In the early postwar years, the airfield was managed by Universal Flying Services, which operated a flying training school and provided aircraft maintenance services. The airfield was sold by auction in 1967. Alan Mann Helicopters began operations there in 1968 after which The Alan Mann Group became the operator. The hard runway was constructed in 1979. The Alan Mann Group sold its interests in 2008 to Albemarle Fairoaks Airport Ltd which owns Fairoaks Operations Ltd, the operator. The landside buildings were owned by West Register Property until they sold their interest on 8 December 2015 to TEREF ADP Fairoaks Limited, a company registered in Jersey number 120101 which was formed on 27 November 2015.

On 25 November 2016 the airport owners announced plans to close the airport, and build a 1,500 unit housing development to be known as &quot;Fairoaks Garden Village&quot;. In June 2022, Surrey Heath Borough Council announced that the proposed development would not form part of its Draft Local Plan, which identifies sites for new homes in the local area.

==Current operation==
Fairoaks Aerodrome has a United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority Ordinary Licence that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee. The facility is used by light aircraft, some of which are operated by its two resident training schools - Synergy Aviation
 and London Transport Flying Club. Its business centre is substantially dedicated to aviation-related enterprises, including the headquarters of the European Regions Airline Association and the British Helicopter Advisory Board.

Fairoaks was formerly equipped with a non-directional beacon (NDB) for short-range radio navigation, until its withdrawal in January 2020. 

There is a low-category fire and rescue service, operating a Category 3 fire service to allow commercial operations of mid sized turboprops and small jets. The fire and rescue vehicles comprise two Terberg TACR-3 vehicles.

From 1994 until 2009 one of three South East Regional Air Support Unit (Metropolitan and Surrey Police Forces) helicopters (and for a period of this time one for the latter force alone) were at Fairoaks. In June 2009, the remaining police helicopter was transferred to RAF Odiham in Hampshire on security grounds.

There are no restrictions on the number of helicopter movements, but fixed wing movements are limited to 120,000 per annum.
==Flying information==

A majority of the Fairoaks Aerodrome Traffic Zone (ATZ) is within the London Control Zone (CTR), therefore special procedures are in place to enable flights to depart and arrive at Fairoaks without the need to contact Heathrow Radar.

<text>Promises, Promises is a musical with music by Burt Bacharach, lyrics by Hal David and a book by Neil Simon. It is based on the 1960 film &quot;The Apartment&quot;, written by Billy Wilder and I. A. L. Diamond. The story concerns a junior executive at an insurance company who seeks to climb the corporate ladder by allowing his apartment to be used by his married superiors for .

The musical premiered in 1968 on Broadway with choreography by Michael Bennett and direction by Robert Moore. It starred Jerry Orbach as Chuck Baxter and Jill O&#x27;Hara as Fran Kubelik. It closed after 1,281 performances. A West End production opened in 1969 featuring Tony Roberts and Betty Buckley. The cast album was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album, and two songs from the show (the title tune and &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Fall in Love Again&quot;) became hit singles for Dionne Warwick.

==Productions==

=== Broadway (1968–1972) ===
After a tryout at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C., and the Colonial Theatre in Boston, MA. the show premiered on Broadway at the Shubert Theatre on December 1, 1968, and closed on January 1, 1972, after 1,281 performances. Directed by Robert Moore, and choreographed by Michael Bennett with Bob Avian as assistant choreographer, the cast featured Jerry Orbach as Chuck Baxter, Jill O&#x27;Hara as Fran Kubelik, and Edward Winter as J. D. Sheldrake. Featured in small or ensemble roles were Kelly Bishop, Graciela Daniele, Ken Howard, Baayork Lee, Donna McKechnie, Frank Pietri, Margo Sappington, and Marian Mercer. A national tour starring Tony Roberts from the West End production as Chuck Baxter, Melissa Hart as Fran, and Bob Holiday as Sheldrake performed throughout the United States during the early 1970s. Lorna Luft played Fran Kubelik on Broadway from October 1971 to January 1972. A second national tour starred Will McKenzie as Chuck Baxter; featured ensemble players included Trudi Green, Laurent Giroux, Guy Allen, Dennis Grimaldi, Brandt Edwards, and Patti McKenzie. Another tour starred Donald O&#x27;Connor as Chuck Baxter, Betty Buckley as Fran Kubelik, and Barney Martin as Dr. Dreyfuss; featured ensemble players included Laurent Giroux, Carla Lewis, and Dennis Grimaldi.

The show&#x27;s now-iconic first act closing dance number, &quot;Turkey Lurkey Time&quot;, underwent significant changes from its initial debut. According to McKechnie, who portrayed Miss Della Hoya, the original choreography was staged on three desks pushed together, and was meant to reflect what the three secretaries might realistically have choreographed in their living rooms. During the first night of the show&#x27;s Boston tryouts, the number was extremely poorly received by the audience. Bennet and Avian immediately reworked the choreography that same night in their hotel room, changing it from its initial realistic approach into its subsequent, high-energy form. The number has been described as a cult classic, and is one McKechnie described in her 2006 memoir as &quot;incredibly athletic&quot; and designed to secure the audience&#x27;s return after the intermission, despite the number having little to do with the musical&#x27;s overall plot.

=== West End (1969) ===
The show was first produced in London&#x27;s West End at the Prince of Wales Theatre in 1969, featuring Tony Roberts and Betty Buckley. It ran for 560 performances.

=== Broadway revival (2010–2011) ===
A reading for a revival of the musical was held in October 2008 with Sean Hayes and Anne Hathaway.

The revival opened at the Broadway Theatre on April 25, 2010, after previews starting on March 27. Directed and choreographed by Rob Ashford, the revival starred Sean Hayes, Kristin Chenoweth, Brooks Ashmanskas, Katie Finneran, and Tony Goldwyn. The Bacharach-David songs &quot;I Say a Little Prayer&quot;, a 1967 million-selling hit written for Dionne Warwick, and &quot;A House Is Not a Home&quot; were added to the score.

Due to pregnancy, Katie Finneran departed the role of Marge on October 10, 2010, and was replaced by &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; veteran Molly Shannon. Hayes, Chenoweth, and Shannon remained with the production until its closing on January 2, 2011. The show had 291 performances and 30 previews.

=== Other productions ===
Regional theatre productions have included a 1993 staging at the Goodspeed Opera House in Connecticut. New York City Center Encores! held a staged concert in March 1997, starring Martin Short, Kerry O&#x27;Malley, Eugene Levy, Dick Latessa, and Christine Baranski.

;2014 San Francisco
The musical opened at San Francisco Playhouse in November 2014 and closed in January 2015. It featured Jeffrey Brian Adams in the role of Chuck and Monique Hafen as Fran.

;2017 Southwark Playhouse, London
This production ran from January to February, directed by Bronagh Lagan with Gabriel Vick in the role of Chuck and Daisy Maywood as Fran.

==Synopsis==

===Act I===
Chuck Baxter is an ambitious bachelor and junior executive for a large insurance company, Consolidated Life, who expresses his frustrations and hopes for career advancement (&quot;Half as Big as Life&quot;). To curry favor with higher-ups in the company, he allows his apartment to be used for their romantic trysts in return for promises of promotion (&quot;Upstairs&quot;). Chuck has his own eye set on Fran Kubelik, a waitress in the company cafeteria whom he&#x27;s always admired from a distance. While talking together she wonders if she will ever find someone to share her life with. Chuck hopes that she might notice him (&quot;You&#x27;ll Think of Someone&quot;).

J.D. Sheldrake, the company&#x27;s powerful personnel director, notices the glowing reviews written by Chuck&#x27;s superiors and deduces the reason for them. He requests sole use of the apartment for his affairs in exchange for Chuck&#x27;s long-awaited promotion and tickets to a basketball game (&quot;Our Little Secret&quot;). (In the 2010 revival, the song &quot;I Say a Little Prayer For You&quot; was added for a scene in which Fran tells female workmates about flowers she has received from a new &quot;mystery individual&quot;.) Chuck asks Fran to attend the basketball game with him, and she agrees to meet him there after first having a drink with her soon-to-be ex-lover (&quot;She Likes Basketball&quot;).

Fran&#x27;s lover turns out to be the married Sheldrake. Fran wants to end the relationship, but Sheldrake talks her into spending the evening with him (&quot;Knowing When to Leave&quot;). Though Fran stands him up, Chuck forgives her. When he informs the other executives that his apartment is no longer available for their use, they express dismay (&quot;Where Can You Take a Girl?&quot;). Meanwhile, Sheldrake wonders why he is drawn to affairs (&quot;Wanting Things&quot;). The scene shifts to the company Christmas party, where everyone is enjoying themselves (&quot;Turkey Lurkey Time&quot;). Miss Olsen, Sheldrake&#x27;s secretary, reveals to Fran that she is simply the latest in a long line of Sheldrake&#x27;s mistresses. The first-act curtain falls as Fran is driven to misery (&quot;A House is Not a Home&quot; in the 2010 revival), and Chuck discovers that Fran is the one Sheldrake has been taking to his apartment.

===Act II===
A despondent Chuck spends Christmas Eve trying to drink away his troubles at a bar, where he meets another tipsy lonelyheart, Marge MacDougall, who agrees to come back to his apartment (&quot;A Fact Can Be a Beautiful Thing&quot;). In the meantime, at Chuck&#x27;s apartment, Fran confronts Mr. Sheldrake about his earlier affairs. While he admits to the affairs, he declares his love for Fran, but tells her that he must leave in order to catch his train home to spend Christmas Eve with his family. A despairing Fran discovers Chuck&#x27;s sleeping pills and takes the whole bottle (&quot;Whoever You Are&quot;).

When Chuck arrives with Marge, he discovers Fran on his bed. After quickly disposing of Marge, a frantic Chuck gets his neighbor, Dr. Dreyfuss, to come over and together they save her life. The next morning Chuck calls Sheldrake to let him know what happened. Sheldrake says he can&#x27;t leave for the city without his wife knowing and asks Chuck to take care of Fran (&quot;Christmas Day&quot;).

Over the next few days Chuck and Dreyfuss try to keep Fran&#x27;s spirits up to prevent a relapse into suicidal behavior (&quot;A Young Pretty Girl Like You&quot;). Chuck and Fran play gin rummy and discuss their problems, growing closer (&quot;I&#x27;ll Never Fall In Love Again&quot;). Mr. Kirkeby, one of Chuck&#x27;s former &#x27;clients&#x27;, discovers that Fran has been staying at Chuck&#x27;s apartment, so as revenge for cutting him and the others off from using the apartment he tells Fran&#x27;s overly protective brother where she has been staying. Karl Kubelik then comes to the apartment to collect her, and believing that Chuck is the cause of her current state he punches Chuck.

Miss Olsen soon discovers that Sheldrake&#x27;s actions led to Fran almost killing herself. She quits her job and tells Mrs. Sheldrake all about her husband&#x27;s affairs. She leaves him, resulting in his desperation to woo Fran back. Sheldrake asks for the keys to Chuck&#x27;s apartment again on New Year&#x27;s Eve to take Fran there. Chuck refuses and quits his job rather than allow Sheldrake to take Fran to his apartment ever again (&quot;Promises, Promises&quot;).

Deciding that he has to get away, Chuck begins packing to move elsewhere when Fran comes to see him. Sheldrake had told her that Chuck had refused him access and quit, and she realizes that Chuck is the one who really loves her. As they resume their earlier game of gin, he declares his love for her, to which she replies, &quot;Shut up and deal&quot;.

==Reception==
From &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;Though the work featured memorable dance sequences by a choreographer on the rise named Michael Bennett, what really set it apart was its score, written by the solid-gold pop composer Burt Bacharach with lyrics by Hal David. Mr. Bacharach introduced to Broadway not only the insistently rhythmic, commercial-jingle buoyancy of 1960&#x27;s soft-core radio fare, but also a cinematic use of Teflon-smooth, offstage backup vocals.&quot;

<doc id="904916" wikidata="Q1073847" url="?curid=904916" title="ArmaLite AR-15">
<text>The ArmaLite AR-15 is a gas-operated assault rifle manufactured in the United States between 1959 and 1964. Designed by American gun manufacturer ArmaLite in 1956, it was based on its AR-10 rifle. The ArmaLite AR-15 was designed to be a lightweight rifle and to fire a new high-velocity, lightweight, small-caliber cartridge to allow infantrymen to carry more ammunition.

In 1959, ArmaLite sold its rights to the AR-15 to Colt due to financial difficulties and limitations in terms of manpower and production capacity. After modifications (most notably, the charging handle was re-located from under the carrying handle like AR-10 to the rear of the receiver), Colt rebranded it the Colt 601, however, it still carried the Armalite markings due to contractual obligations to Armalite/Fairchild Aircraft Co. Colt marketed the redesigned rifle to various military services around the world and was eventually adopted by the U.S. military in January 1962 and subsequently designated as M16 rifle in December 1963, which went into production and service in 1964.

Colt continued to use the AR-15 trademark for its line of semi-automatic-only rifles marketed to civilian and law-enforcement customers, known as Colt AR-15. The Armalite AR-15 is the parent of a variety of Colt AR-15 and M16 rifle variants.

==History==
After World War II, the United States military started looking for a single automatic rifle to replace the M1 Garand, M1/M2 Carbines, M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle, M3 &quot;Grease Gun&quot; and Thompson submachine gun. However, early experiments with select-fire versions of the M1 Garand proved disappointing. During the Korean War, the select-fire M2 Carbine largely replaced the submachine gun in US service and became the most widely used Carbine variant. However, combat experience suggested that the .30 Carbine round was under-powered. American weapons designers concluded that an intermediate round was necessary, and recommended a small-caliber, high-velocity cartridge.

However, senior American commanders having faced fanatical enemies and experienced major logistical problems during WWII and the Korean War, insisted that a single powerful .30 caliber cartridge be developed, that could not only be used by the new automatic rifle, but by the new general-purpose machine gun (GPMG) in concurrent development. This culminated in the development of the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge.

The United States Army then began testing several rifles to replace the obsolete M1 Garand. Springfield Armory&#x27;s T44E4 and heavier T44E5 were essentially updated versions of the Garand chambered for the new 7.62×51mm NATO round, while Fabrique Nationale submitted their FN FAL as the T48, and the British submitted their EM-2 rifle. ArmaLite entered the competition late, hurriedly submitting several AR-10 prototype rifles in the fall of 1956 to the United States Army&#x27;s Springfield Armory for testing.

The ArmaLite AR-10 featured an innovative combination of a straight-line barrel/stock design, a new patent-filed gas-operated bolt, forged aluminum alloy receivers and with phenolic composite stocks resulting in a small arm significantly easier to control in automatic fire than other infantry rifles of the day. It had rugged elevated sights, an oversized aluminum flash suppressor and recoil compensator, and an adjustable gas system. The final prototype, featured an upper and lower receiver with the now-familiar hinge and takedown pins, and the charging handle was on top of the receiver placed inside of the carry handle. For a 1950s 7.62×51mm NATO rifle, the AR-10 was incredibly lightweight at only empty. Initial comments by Springfield Armory test staff were favorable, and some testers commented that the AR-10 was the best lightweight automatic rifle ever tested by the Armory.

In the end, the United States Army chose the T44, which entered service as the M14 rifle, which was an improved M1 Garand with a 20-round magazine and automatic fire capability. The U.S. also adopted the M60 general purpose machine gun (GPMG). Its NATO partners adopted the FN FAL and HK G3 rifles, and the FN MAG and Rheinmetall MG3 GPMGs.

The first confrontations between the AK-47 and the M14 came in the early part of the Vietnam War. Battlefield reports indicated that the M14 was uncontrollable in full-auto and that soldiers could not carry enough ammo to maintain fire superiority over the AK-47. While the M2 Carbine offered a high rate of fire, it was under-powered and ultimately outclassed by the AK-47. A replacement was needed: a medium between the traditional preference for high-powered rifles, such as the M14, and the lightweight firepower of the M2 Carbine.

===Scaling down the ArmaLite AR-10===
As a result, the Army was forced to reconsider a 1957 request by General Willard G. Wyman, commander of the U.S. Continental Army Command (CONARC), to develop a .223 caliber (5.56 mm) select-fire rifle weighing 6 lb (2.7 kg) when loaded with a 20-round magazine. The 5.56mm round had to penetrate a standard U.S. M1 helmet at and retain a velocity in excess of the speed of sound, while matching or exceeding the wounding ability of the .30 Carbine cartridge. This request ultimately resulted in the development of a scaled-down version of the ArmaLite AR-10, called the ArmaLite AR-15 rifle.

In 1958, ArmaLite submitted ten AR-15s and one hundred 25-round magazines for CONARC testing. The tests found that a five to seven man team armed with AR-15s had the same firepower as an 11-man team armed with M14s and soldiers armed with AR-15s could also carry three times more ammunition than those armed with M14s (649 rounds vs. 220 rounds). The AR-15 was found to be three times more reliable than the M14 rifle. However, General Maxwell Taylor, then Army Chief of Staff, &quot;vetoed&quot; the AR-15 in favor of the M14. In 1959, ArmaLite—now frustrated with the lack of results and suffering ongoing financial difficulties—sold its rights to the AR-10 and AR-15 to Colt.

===Colt era===
After acquiring the AR-15, Colt promptly redesigned the rifle to facilitate mass production. Based on the final ArmaLite design, most notably, the charging handle was re-located from under the carrying handle, like the earlier AR-10 to the rear of the receiver, like the later M16 rifle. Colt then renamed and rebranded the rifle &quot;Colt ArmaLite AR-15 Model 01&quot;. After a Far East tour, Colt made its first sale of Colt ArmaLite AR-15 rifles to Malaya on September 30, 1959. Colt manufactured their first batch of 300 Colt ArmaLite AR-15 rifles in December 1959. Colt would go on to market the Colt ArmaLite AR-15 rifle to military services around the world.

In July 1960, General Curtis LeMay, then Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, was impressed by a demonstration of the AR-15 and ordered 8500 rifles. In the meantime, the Army would continue testing the AR-15, finding that the intermediate cartridge .223 (5.56 mm) rifle is much easier to shoot than the standard 7.62×51mm NATO M14 rifle. In 1961 marksmanship testing, the U.S. Army found that 43% of AR-15 shooters achieved Expert, while only 22% of M14 rifle shooters did so. Also, a lower recoil impulse, allows for more controllable automatic weapons fire.

In the summer of 1961, General LeMay was promoted to Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force and requested an additional 80,000 AR-15s. However, General Maxwell D. Taylor, now Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, (who repeatedly clashed with LeMay) advised President John F. Kennedy that having two different calibers within the military system at the same time would be problematic and the request was rejected. In October 1961, William Godel, a senior man at the Advanced Research Projects Agency, sent 10 AR-15s to South Vietnam. The reception was enthusiastic, and in 1962, another 1,000 AR-15s were sent. United States Army Special Forces personnel filed battlefield reports lavishly praising the AR-15 and the stopping-power of the 5.56 mm cartridge and pressed for its adoption.

By intentionally choosing a slow twist rate the 55 grain bullet used in the 5.56 Ball M193 cartridge was only just stable in flight. The damage caused by the 5.56 mm bullet was originally believed to be caused by instantaneous &quot;tumbling&quot; on impact and render a wide, incapacitating wound due to the slow 1 in rifling twist rate. However, any pointed lead core bullet will &quot;tumble&quot; after penetration in flesh, because the center of gravity is towards the rear of the bullet. The large wounds observed by soldiers in Vietnam were actually caused by bullet fragmentation, which was created by a combination of the bullet&#x27;s velocity and construction. These wounds were so devastating that the photographs remained classified into the 1980s.

However, despite overwhelming evidence that the AR-15 could bring more firepower to bear than the M14, the Army opposed the adoption of the new rifle. U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara now had two conflicting views: the USAF&#x27;s (General LeMay&#x27;s) repeated requests for additional AR-15s and the ARPA report favoring the AR-15, versus the Army&#x27;s position favoring the M14. Even President Kennedy expressed concern, so McNamara ordered Secretary of the Army Cyrus Vance to test the M14, the AR-15 and the AK-47. The Army reported that only the M14 was suitable for service, but Vance wondered about the impartiality of those conducting the tests. He ordered the Army Inspector General to investigate the testing methods used; the Inspector General confirmed that the testers were biased towards the M14.

In January 1963, Secretary McNamara received reports that M14 production was insufficient to meet the needs of the armed forces and ordered a halt to M14 production. At the time, the AR-15 was the only rifle that could fulfill a requirement of a &quot;universal&quot; infantry weapon for issue to all services. McNamara ordered its adoption, despite receiving reports of several deficiencies, most notably the lack of a chrome-plated chamber.

After minor modifications, the new redesigned rifle was renamed the &quot;Rifle, Caliber 5.56 mm, M16&quot;. Meanwhile, the Army relented and recommended the adoption of the M16 for jungle warfare operations. However, the Army insisted on the inclusion of a forward assist to help push the bolt into battery in the event that a cartridge failed to seat into the chamber. The Air Force, Colt and Eugene Stoner believed that the addition of a forward assist was an unjustified expense. As a result, the design was split into two variants: the Air Force&#x27;s M16 without the forward assist, and the &quot;XM16E1 (AKA: M16A1)&quot; with the forward assist for the other service branches.

In November 1963, McNamara approved the U.S. Army&#x27;s order of 85,000 XM16E1s; and to appease LeMay, the Air Force was granted an order for another 19,000 M16s. In March 1964, the M16 rifle went into production and the Army accepted delivery of the first batch of 2129 rifles later that year, and an additional 57,240 rifles the following year.

The Colt ArmaLite AR-15 was discontinued with the adoption of the M16 rifle. Most AR-15 rifles in U.S. service have long ago been upgraded to M16 configuration. The Colt ArmaLite AR-15 was also used by the United States Secret Service and other U.S. federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.

Shortly after the United States military adopted the M16 rifle, Colt introduced its line semi-automatic-only Colt AR-15 rifles, which it markets to civilians and law enforcement. Colt continues to use the AR-15 name for these rifles.

===Colt ArmaLite AR-15 (Model 601 and 602)===
Colt&#x27;s first two models produced after the acquisition of the rifle from ArmaLite were the 601 and 602, and these rifles were in many ways clones of the original ArmaLite rifle (in fact, these rifles were often found stamped &quot;Colt ArmaLite AR-15, Property of the U.S. Government caliber .223&quot;, with no reference to them being M16s).

The 601 and 602 are virtually identical to the later M16 rifle without the forward-assist. Like the later M16 rifle their charging handle was re-located from under the carrying handle like AR-10 to the rear of the receiver. They were equipped with triangular fore-stocks and occasionally green or brown furniture. Their front sight had a more triangular shape. They had flat lower receivers without raised surfaces around the magazine well. Their bolt hold open device lacked a raised lower engagement surface and had a slanted and serrated surface that had to be engaged with a bare thumb, index finger, or thumb nail because of the lack of this surface. Their fire-selector was also changed from upward = safe, backward = semi-auto and forward = full-auto, to the now familiar forward = safe, upward = semi-auto, and backward = full-auto of the M16 rifle.

The only major difference between the 601 and 602 is the switch from the original four grooves, right-hand 1:14-inch (1:355.6 mm or 64 calibers) rifling twist rate to the more common four grooves, right-hand 1:12-inch (1:304.8 mm or 54.8 calibers) twist. This was done as the original 1:14-inch twist rate to just stabilize the 55 grain bullet used in the 5.56 Ball M193 cartridge under unfavorable conditions could induce too much yaw and due to the resulting excessive in flight bullet destabilization become inaccurate. The one turn in 12 inches increased accuracy and was optimized to adequately stabilize the M193 ball and longer M196 tracer bullets.

==Design details==
The ArmaLite AR-15 internal piston action was derived from the original ArmaLite AR-10 action and was later used in the M16 rifle action. This internal piston action system designed by Eugene Stoner is commonly called a direct impingement system, but it does not utilize a conventional direct impingement system. In , the designer states:


The gas system, bolt carrier, and bolt-locking design were patented at for the time and is ammunition specific, since it does not have an adjustable gas port or valve to adjust the weapon to various propellant and projectile or barrel length specific pressure behavior.

The AR-15 is a modular weapon system. It is easy to assemble, modify and repair using a few simple hand tools, and a flat surface to work on. The AR-15&#x27;s upper receiver incorporates the fore stock, the charging handle, the gas operating system, the barrel, the bolt and bolt carrier assembly. The lower receiver incorporates the magazine well, the pistol grip and the buttstock. The lower receiver also contains the trigger, disconnector, hammer and fire selector (collectively known as the fire control group). The AR-15&#x27;s &quot;duckbill&quot; flash suppressor had three tines or prongs and was designed to preserve the shooter&#x27;s night vision by disrupting the flash. Early AR-15&#x27;s had a 25-round magazine. Later model AR-15s used a 20-round waffle-patterned magazine that was meant to be a lightweight, disposable item. As such, it is made of pressed/stamped aluminum and was not designed to be durable.

The AR-15&#x27;s most distinctive ergonomic feature is the carrying handle and rear sight assembly on top of the receiver. This is a by-product of the design, where the carry handle serves to protect the charging handle. The AR-15 rifle has a 500 mm (19.75 inches) sight radius. The AR-15 uses an L-type flip, aperture rear sight and it is adjustable with two settings, 0 to 300 meters and 300 to 400 meters. The front sight is a post adjustable for elevation. The rear sight can be adjusted for windage. The sights can be adjusted with a bullet tip or pointed tool.

The AR-15&#x27;s straight-line recoil design, where the recoil spring is located in the stock directly behind the action, and serves the dual function of operating spring and recoil buffer. The stock being in line with the bore also reduces muzzle rise, especially during automatic fire. Because recoil does not significantly shift the point of aim, faster follow-up shots are possible and user fatigue is reduced.

<doc id="904921" wikidata="Q29086" url="?curid=904921" title="Matthew Lillard">
<text>Matthew Lyn Lillard (born January 24, 1970) is an American actor. His film work includes Chip Sutphin in &quot;Serial Mom&quot; (1994), Emmanuel &quot;Cereal Killer&quot; Goldstein in &quot;Hackers&quot; (1995), Stu Macher in &quot;Scream&quot; (1996), Stevo in &quot;SLC Punk!&quot; (1998), Brock Hudson in &quot;She&#x27;s All That&quot; (1999), Dennis Rafkin in &quot;Thirteen Ghosts&quot; (2001), and Jerry Conlaine in &quot;Without a Paddle&quot; (2004). He is perhaps best known for his role as Shaggy Rogers in the live-action movies &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; (2002) and &quot;Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed&quot; (2004) as well as in certain animated releases, with the actor serving as the voice of Shaggy since Casey Kasem retired from the role in 2009.

In 2023, he gained renewed recognition for his role as William Afton, a manipulative serial killer, in &quot;Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s&quot;. U.S. entertainment publication &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; stated that he had entered &quot;his Renaissance era&quot; in popular culture, noting that the movie had the third highest ever domestic box office return during its opening weekend for a horror film. Lillard has been labeled as a &quot;scream king&quot; due to his influence in the genre.

While much of his work is comedic in nature, Lillard has also given dramatic performances in projects such as &quot;The Descendants&quot; (2011), &quot;Trouble with the Curve&quot; (2012), &quot;Match&quot; (2014), and &quot;Twin Peaks: The Return&quot; (2017). Lillard also starred as Dean Boland in the television series &quot;Good Girls&quot; (2018–2021). He made his directorial debut with the coming-of-age drama &quot;Fat Kid Rules the World&quot; (2012).

==Early life==
Lillard was born in Lansing, Michigan, on January 24, 1970, the son of Paula and Jeffrey Lillard (b. 1948), and grew up in Tustin, California. He has a younger sister, Amy, and attended Foothill High School in North Tustin, California. He later attended Fullerton College and then went to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Pasadena, California, with fellow actor Paul Rudd. He also attended Circle in the Square Theatre School in New York City.

==Career==
After high school, Lillard was co-host of a short-lived TV show titled &quot;SK8-TV&quot;, and afterwards was hired as an extra in &quot;Ghoulies 3: Ghoulies Go to College&quot; (1991). In 1994, he was cast in the John Waters black comedy &quot;Serial Mom&quot;. The following year he was cast in five films, including &quot;Hackers&quot;, a thriller about a group of high school kids who thwart a multimillion-dollar corporate extortion conspiracy. In 1996, he was cast as Stu Macher in the horror film &quot;Scream&quot;. He also played Stevo in the independent film &quot;SLC Punk!&quot;, and supporting character Dennis Rafkin in &quot;Thirteen Ghosts&quot;. He was originally meant to reprise his role of Stu Macher in 2000&#x27;s &quot;Scream 3&quot; but the plans were changed.

Lillard was cast as Norville &quot;Shaggy&quot; Rogers in the 2002 live-action film &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, a role he later reprised in the 2004 sequel &quot;Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed&quot;. When Casey Kasem, who had voiced the character from the show&#x27;s debut in 1969, retired in 2009, Lillard was chosen to take over and voice Shaggy in the three subsequent animated series, &quot;Mystery Incorporated&quot;, &quot;Be Cool Scooby-Doo!&quot;, and &quot;Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?&quot;, as well as every animated direct-to-video film since 2010&#x27;s &quot;Scooby-Doo! Abracadabra-Doo&quot;. Lillard, however, did not voice Shaggy in the animated &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; reboot &quot;Scoob!&quot;, with the character instead being voiced by &quot;SNL&quot; alum Will Forte. Although Lillard was disappointed with the casting decision, he still wished the film good luck.

In 2011, Lillard guest starred on the Fox series &quot;House&quot;. In 2011, he produced and directed his first feature film, &quot;Fat Kid Rules the World&quot;, based on the K. L. Going book of the same name. Later that year, he appeared in the comedy-drama film &quot;The Descendants&quot;. Lillard also reprised the voice role of Shaggy in the crossover episode in the television series &quot;Supernatural&quot; in 2018.

In 2012, Lillard guest-starred in the &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; episode &quot;The Apprenticeship&quot;. The following year, he played the role of Daniel Frye on the American TV series &quot;The Bridge&quot;. In 2014, Lillard starred as Peter in the animated film &quot;Under Wraps&quot;, alongside Brooke Shields and Drake Bell. In 2017, Lillard starred as William Hastings in the third season of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. The next year, he began co-starring as Dean Boland on the NBC series &quot;Good Girls&quot;.

In 2016, Lillard landed the recurring role of FBI undercover agent Luke Goshen in the Amazon Series, &quot;Bosch.&quot; In 2022, Lillard was cast for the live-action movie adaptation of the &quot;Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s&quot; video game series. The film came out the following year.

He gained renewed recognition for his role as William Afton, a manipulative serial killer, in &quot;Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s&quot;. U.S. entertainment publication &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; stated that he had entered &quot;his Renaissance era&quot; in popular culture, noting that the movie had the third highest ever domestic box office return during its opening weekend for a horror film. Lillard has credited his children as inspiring him both to take on the role and to give a dominating, assertive performance as the franchise&#x27;s overarching villain.

In an interview, Lillard elaborated,
In 2024, he appeared in filmmaker Mike Flanagan&#x27;s film &quot;The Life of Chuck&quot;.

In January 2025, it was announced he is returning to the Scream franchise for its seventh entry, having previously played Stuart ‘Stu’ Macher in the first 1996 movie. 

== Other ventures==
Lillard was one of the co-founders of Beadle and Grimms, a company that publishes licensed expanded products, usually of a limited edition, from Wizards of the Coast games including &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

Lillard co-founded the company Find Familiar Spirits, which develops and sells specialized alcoholic beverages.

==Personal life==
On August 26, 2000, Lillard married Heather Helm, with whom he has three children. They reside in Los Angeles.

In October 2005, he participated in a &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; tournament, against members of the &quot;Quest Club Gaming Organization&quot;, at the Magic Castle in Hollywood, California. Lillard has also played &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; with the online series &quot;Dice, Camera, Action&quot; with Christopher Perkins as the Dungeon Master; as well as with the Critical Role cast at a special one-shot with Sam Riegel as the Dungeon Master.

<doc id="904922" wikidata="Q2300118" url="?curid=904922" title="Mileena">
<text>Mileena is a character in the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; fighting game franchise by Midway Games and NetherRealm Studios. Introduced in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; (1993), Mileena was initially depicted as a clone of the Edenian princess Kitana, created by Shang Tsung with the blood of the fictional Tarkatan species. In the reboot entry Mortal Kombat&quot; (2011), Mileena&#x27;s background as a clone of Kitana remains the same. &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; (2015) depicts Mileena&#x27;s attempts to regain the throne as the empress of Outworld, following her removal by Kotal Kahn.

In the series&#x27; second reboot &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot; (2023), significant changes were made to Mileena&#x27;s character and background. Rather than a clone, Mileena is a daughter of Sindel and the older twin sister of Kitana, making her heir to the throne. However, she was infected with the Tarkat disease, developing the deformed facial features of the Tarkatan race, which she conceals with a mask.

Mileena is featured as a prominent villain throughout the series and uses a pair of sai as her primary weapons. Despite some criticism for her revealing character designs, she has received a positive reception for her unique appearance and personality. She has been featured in various media outside of the games and is one of the franchise&#x27;s most popular characters.

==Development==
===Design===

&quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; co-creator and producer Ed Boon described Mileena and Kitana as the &quot;female version of Scorpion and Sub-Zero&quot;, two ninja characters from the 1992 original game. Mileena was created for the 1993 sequel &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; as a palette-swapped complement to Kitana in order to preserve memory. She was physically identical to Kitana save for her pink outfit and large gnashing teeth, which were created to tie in with fellow debut character Baraka in symbolizing evil in the game. The teeth were digitally added to Mileena&#x27;s face for one of her Fatalities (finishing moves that execute defeated opponents) in which she consumes her defeated opponent and spits out their bones. Character designer John Tobias chose the name &quot;Mileena&quot; as he felt &quot;it had a pleasant sound to it, which either helped hide her grotesque appearance or exposed a hidden inner beauty&quot;, while her and Kitana&#x27;s storylines in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; were borne from &quot;the conflicts of sibling rivalry and rebelling against authority&quot;. Her signature weapon is a pair of sai, along with recurring teleport-kick and ground-roll-attack moves, for which she was considered one of the top characters of &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;. Kitana was originally given the sai until they were transferred to Mileena after her creation, with Kitana instead receiving war fans. Mileena was omitted from &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; due to what Tobias considered an excessive amount of ninja characters used in &quot;MKII&quot;, but she and the ninjas returned for the upgrade &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot;, in which she was a hidden unlockable character.

For the series&#x27; three-dimensional titles beginning with &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance&quot;, Mileena and the previously palette-swapped characters were given distinct redesigns by Steve Beran, the series&#x27; lead character designer and art director. Beran explained that his objective of remaking old characters was to give them a fresh look from their previous incarnations while retaining elements that still made them recognizable to players. Her alternate costume in the 2011 series reboot was composed of bandages wrapped around her otherwise nude form. For &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot;, Mileena&#x27;s facial appearance was redesigned with a humanlike mouth and her deformities relocated to her cheeks. This change was reverted to her original mouth design for her next appearance in &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;.

Mileena and the other playable female characters in &quot;MK11&quot; were intentionally designed by Beran and lead character designer Brendan George to downplay their sexuality. Beran commented, &quot;I think it’s just what the game is about: You’re going in to fight for your life, and you’re not going to be wearing such scantily clad items.” George designed the characters overall to emphasize brighter palettes that would stand out against the game&#x27;s dark backgrounds while highlighting their individual strengths. Mileena&#x27;s &quot;MK11&quot; design was finalized by artists Manuel Robles and Julian Wolf.

===Live-action and voice portrayals===
Mileena was played by martial artist Katalin Zamiar in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; (1993), but she and several other actors from the digitized &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; games later filed an unsuccessful lawsuit against Midway over unpaid royalties from the home versions of the game and the unauthorized use of their likenesses. Zamiar was replaced by Becky Gable for &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot; (1995). Her motion capture actor for the three-dimensional games &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot; (2004) and &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot; (2006) was Midway graphics artist Carlos Pesina, but she was played by a female actor for the reboot game &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (2011).

The character&#x27;s battle cries were voiced by Peg Burr for the digitized &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; games. For the series&#x27; three-dimensional releases, Mileena was voiced by Rosalind Dugas (&quot;Mortal Kombat Gold&quot;), and Johanna Añonuevo (&quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot;). Lita Lopez voiced Mileena in the 2005 spinoff beat-&#x27;em-up game &quot;Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks&quot;. For the NetherRealm Studios &quot;MK&quot; releases, Karen Strassman voiced Mileena in the 2011 reboot and &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot;, and Kari Wahlgren has voiced Mileena since &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; games===
Making her series debut in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; (1993), Mileena is a horrific clone of Kitana, who was once the princess of the fictional realm of Edenia until Shao Kahn, evil emperor of the dimension of Outworld, forcibly annexes the realm and takes Kitana as his own daughter. To keep her from learning about her past, Kahn orders the sorcerer Shang Tsung to create a clone for the purpose of spying on Kitana and ensuring her loyalty to him, and to replace her if necessary. However, Shang Tsung combines Kitana&#x27;s genetics with that of the brutish Tarkatan race, resulting in Mileena having the latter&#x27;s characteristic mouth of razor-sharp teeth that she conceals with a mask. By adulthood, Mileena and Kitana are employed as Kahn&#x27;s personal assassins in his battle against Earth&#x27;s defenders.

In &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot; (1995), Mileena is killed by Kitana and damned to the underworld of the Netherrealm, where she swears fealty to its ruler, Shinnok. Kahn later resurrects her in his effort to defeat Earth&#x27;s warriors while granting her the ability to read Kitana&#x27;s thoughts. In &quot;Mortal Kombat Gold&quot; (1999), Mileena assists Shinnok and his cohort, the necromancer Quan Chi, in his invasion of Edenia and the imprisonment of Kitana. After diverting their forces to attack Earth, however, the reduced security enables Kitana to escape.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot; (2004), Mileena is imprisoned by Kitana for years until the Dragon King Onaga invades Edenia and kills Kitana along with Earth&#x27;s other defenders. After being freed by her ally Baraka, Mileena poses as Kitana to confuse and misdirect Onaga&#x27;s enemies while secretly taking control of both Edenia&#x27;s forces and Onaga&#x27;s undead army for herself. In the game&#x27;s training mode, Mileena tutors main protagonist Shujinko in combat.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot; (2006), Mileena seizes Kahn&#x27;s fortress while maintaining her deception until she feels Edenia&#x27;s forces are ready to serve her under her true identity. When Kahn resurfaces to resume his rule of Outworld, she is forced to reveal herself and willingly surrenders to him. She captures and incarcerates Shujinko under Kahn&#x27;s orders to coerce Onaga to join forces with him, all while secretly plotting to take Edenia&#x27;s throne for herself. In the game&#x27;s opening cinematic sequence, she is killed by Shang Tsung during the titular Armageddon in an attempt to gain Blaze&#x27;s elemental powers.

The thunder god and Earth protector Raiden alters the timeline to prevent Armageddon in the series reboot &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (2011). Mileena is created from Edenian and Tarkatan genetics by Shang Tsung in his &quot;Flesh Pit&quot; laboratory to replace Kitana as Shao Kahn&#x27;s &quot;true daughter&quot; after Kitana learns of her past. Due to Mileena&#x27;s physical and mental instability, Kahn instead uses her to lure and devour her victims.

In flashbacks depicted in &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; (2015), Mileena succeeds Kahn as Outworld&#x27;s ruler following his death at Raiden&#x27;s hands, but she is overthrown by Kotal Kahn after the revelation that she is not Shao Kahn&#x27;s biological daughter. In the present, Mileena mounts a failed assassination attempt on Kotal before she is eventually executed by D&#x27;Vorah. She was initially omitted from &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; (2019) but later added as a downloadable character in November 2020 due to heavy fan demand.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot; (2023), Fire God Liu Kang creates a second new timeline in which Mileena is Kitana&#x27;s biological elder twin sister and the daughter of Edenia&#x27;s rulers, Empress Sindel and Emperor Jerrod, but Jerrod is ultimately murdered by an unknown assailant. Mileena is the crown princess of Edenia but is also the girlfriend of Tanya, the leader of the Umgadi royal guard, despite their rules forbidding relationships. Mileena also secretly suffers from the Tarkat virus, a mutating disease that slowly transforms the afflicted into feral monsters, and uses a serum developed by Shang Tsung to keep it at bay. While helping Liu Kang defend their timeline, Mileena defeats Ermac, allowing Jerrod&#x27;s spirit to take control of Ermac&#x27;s body and reunite with his family before joining Liu Kang in the fight to preserve Outworld and Earth. When Sindel is fatally wounded in battle, she appoints Mileena her successor before Jerrod absorbs her soul. In her arcade mode ending, Mileena assumes the throne and works to mend relations with others who share her condition.

===Other appearances===

Mileena makes a brief appearance in &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot;, played by martial artist Dana Hee and identified by name only in the closing credits. Australian actress Sisi Stringer played Mileena in the 2021 reboot film &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;. Stringer, who underwent four months of martial arts training in preparation for the role, did not actively seek the part but was drawn to the character following a costume fitting and screen test. Megan Brown played Mileena in one episode of the 1998 television series &quot;Mortal Kombat: Conquest&quot;, in which the character is not directly related to Kitana. In the web series &quot;Mortal Kombat Legacy&quot;, Mileena kills Kitana&#x27;s father, Emperor Jerrod, on Shao Kahn&#x27;s orders, and defeats Johnny Cage during the Mortal Kombat tournament before she is killed by Kitana. She was played by martial artist Jolene Tran in the 2011 first season, and Michelle Lee in the 2013 second season.

Mileena makes brief appearances in the &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot; novelization and a &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; prequel comic book written and illustrated by &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; co-creator John Tobias. She and the other &quot;MKII&quot; characters appeared in the Malibu Comics miniseries &quot;Goro: Prince of Pain&quot; (1994) and &quot;Battlewave&quot; (1995), while she was featured in the one-shot issue &quot;Kitana and Mileena: Sister Act&quot; (1995). Her feud with Kotal Kahn is expanded upon in the DC Comics prequel miniseries &quot;Mortal Kombat X: Blood Ties&quot; (2015). According to series writer Shawn Kittelsen, &quot;Kotal didn&#x27;t overthrow Mileena in some macho power play; he overthrew her out of genuine concern for the safety and well being of Outworld and its citizens&quot;.

Mileena has been licensed for action figures, Halloween costumes, collectible statuettes from Syco Collectibles and Pop Culture Shock Collectibles, and a figurine by Funko. The compilation album &quot;Mortal Kombat: Songs Inspired by the Warriors&quot; (2011) included a track by electronica musician Tokimonsta titled &quot;Mileena&#x27;s Theme&quot;. In November 2020, rapper Megan Thee Stallion dressed up as Mileena to promote the character&#x27;s addition to &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;. Mileena has made several homage alternate-media appearances that parodied the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; games.

==Reception==
Mileena&#x27;s debut playable appearance in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;, combined with her evil characterization and revealing clothing, was met with favorable critical reception and made her one of the franchise&#x27;s most recognizable characters. She is additionally noted for her sex appeal despite her disfigured face. Briana Lawrence of &quot;The Mary Sue&quot; deemed Mileena her favorite series character due to her &quot;ferocity&quot; and sex appeal. &quot;I expected her whole arc to be some sort of &#x27;I hate who I am, I wish to look normal like my sister&#x27; narrative, but nope, she unapologetically loves herself.&quot; However, Joystiq&#x27;s Alexander Sliwinski wrote that instead of &quot;focusing on her fighting style, or assets&quot;, he asked, &quot;how does she pronounce the letter P without touching her lips together?&quot;

While Mileena&#x27;s sexualization was considered a positive aspect of her &quot;MKII&quot; debut, some critics have noted it as either impractical or inappropriate in her later series appearances. Gavin Jasper of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; opined in January 2015 that the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; games received legitimate criticism for its &quot;over-sexualized&quot; female characters, &quot;but I always thought it was pretty funny of them to focus the male gaze on the monster-faced woman.&quot; Three months later, in his review of &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot;, he wrote that he was &quot;shocked&quot; at the game&#x27;s perceived progressivism &quot;to the point that Mileena actually has pants on!&quot; Mileena and Kitana were the subject of an article by researcher Jane Felstead, who commented that while the intention of female characters was to cater to gamers of both sexes while possessing equal physical capabilities, they were nonetheless created to satisfy the male gaze. She praised the physical appearance of &quot;MKII&quot; actress Katalin Zamiar in that &quot;in no regard was she unrealistic&quot;, but with the onset of three-dimensional animation, female characters such as Mileena were &quot;impossibly idealised&quot;. Felstead nonetheless suggested that Mileena and Kitana both &quot;perform their gruesome tasks with as much finesse as their male counterparts&quot; while the in-game action is &quot;traditionally seen as male-coded behaviour, and yet in this case infiltrated by a number of strong, capable women.&quot;

Her cannibalism is regularly displayed in her Fatality finishing moves, and has consequently been a topic of discussion. &quot;X360&quot; featured it in their selection of &quot;notorious videogame crimes&quot;. The &quot;Man-Eater&quot; finisher from &quot;MKII&quot; was compared by authors to the &quot;vagina dentata&quot; folktale tradition. Sociologist Dina Khapaeva wrote that gamers &quot;are actually encouraged to act as cannibals&quot; through actions such as performing Mileena&#x27;s finishers. Kate Robertson of the University of Sydney likened cannibalistic female popular-media characters such as Mileena to the Sirens of Greek mythology in that &quot;the connection between women and cannibalism reflects the common trope of the danger inherent within the female body&quot; regarding &quot;allure, fear and revulsion provoked by such a display of female power.&quot;

Mileena has been analyzed as a character affected by racial stereotyping in the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; games. She was among the series characters noted by activist Guy Aoki as allegedly perpetuating existing stereotypes of Asians as martial arts experts. Author Christopher B. Patterson cited her as an example of female Asian characters in Western games being &quot;synonymous with eye candy&quot;. In their book &quot;Interacting With Video&quot; (1996), which condemned the violence of video games as supposedly affecting social behavior and causing real-life violence, Patricia Marks Greenfield and Rodney R. Cocking used the &quot;two Asian twin sisters, Mileena and Kitana&quot; as an example of a &quot;highly eroticized Dragon Lady&quot; trope. The authors believed that the games&#x27; increased diversity due to including &quot;characters of color&quot; such as the two and Jax did not necessarily represent increased progressive identity politics, but rather &quot;the racist and sexist potential of individual fights.&quot; However, author David Church included Mileena in his praise of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;″s &quot;female or nonwhite&quot; upper-tier playable characters while observing &quot;the sheer diversity of playable characters undercutting the potential for racial and gender stereotyping&quot;.

Mileena drew attention from journalists for her &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; ending that showed her in a relationship with Tanya, which was continued in &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;. &quot;Game Rant&quot;″s Lauren Beeler-Baistad lauded the game for &quot;succeed[ing] at LGBT representation because there isn&#x27;t any stigma surrounding Mileena and Tanya both being women.&quot; Conversely, Ariel Litwak of &quot;The Michigan Daily&quot; felt that Mileena fell into the &quot;&#x27;horny bisexual&#x27; stereotype&quot; of female characters&#x27; attraction toward other women being an act of fan service and not true bisexuality. Renaldo Matadeen of Comic Book Resources praised their relationship but criticized the games&#x27; &quot;past failures&quot; at inclusivity such as the &quot;mishandled queer narrative&quot; of Kung Jin, an LGBT character introduced in &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; who has made no other series appearances. Lindsay Cooper of Capilano University described in-game lesbian relationships such as Mileena and Tanya as implicitly depicted in contrast to explicit stereotyping of male homosexuality, citing &quot;Streets of Rage 3&quot; character Ash as an example. History professor Leonardo Dallacqua de Carvalho observed that &quot;MK1&quot;″s rebooted storyline included &quot;identity issues&quot; like Mileena&#x27;s relationship and the &quot;empathetic&quot; subplot of her and Baraka living with the Tarkat disease, which he likened to leprosy.

<doc id="904930" wikidata="Q2731236" url="?curid=904930" title="Nancy Spero">
<text>Nancy Spero (August 24, 1926 – October 18, 2009) was an American visual artist known for her political and feminist paintings and hand pulled prints .

Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Spero lived for much of her life in New York City. She married and collaborated with artist Leon Golub. As both artist and activist, Nancy Spero had a career that spanned fifty years. She is known for her continuous engagement with contemporary political, social, and cultural concerns. Spero chronicled wars and apocalyptic violence as well as articulating visions of ecstatic rebirth and the celebratory cycles of life. Her complex network of collective and individual voices was a catalyst for the creation of her figurative lexicon representing women from prehistory to the present in such epic-scale paintings and collage on paper as &quot;Torture of Women&quot; (1976), &quot;Notes in Time on Women&quot; (1979) and &quot;The First Language&quot; (1981). In 2010, &quot;Notes in Time&quot; was posthumously reanimated as a digital scroll in the online magazine &quot;Triple Canopy&quot;. Spero has had a number of retrospective exhibitions at major museums.

==Early years==

Spero was born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1926. A year later her family moved to Chicago, where she grew up. After graduating from New Trier High School, she studied at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and graduated in 1949. Among Spero&#x27;s peers at the Art Institute was a young GI who had returned from service in World War II, Leon Golub. Spero and Golub exhibited at the Hyde Park Art Center in Chicago as part of the group the Monster Roster. After graduating from the Art Institute of Chicago, Spero continued to study painting in Paris at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts and at the Atelier of André Lhote, an early Cubist painter, teacher and critic. Soon after her return to the United States in 1950, she married Leon Golub, and the two artists settled in Chicago.

From 1956 to 1957, Spero and Golub lived and collaborated in Italy, while raising their three sons. Spero and Golub were equally committed to exploring a modernist representation of the human form, with its narratives and art historical resonances, even as Abstract Expressionism was becoming the dominant idiom. In Florence and Ischia, Spero became intrigued by the format, style and mood of Etruscan and Roman frescoes and sarcophagi which would have influence on her later work. Finding a more varied, inclusive and international atmosphere in Europe than in the New York art world of the time, Spero and her family moved to Paris, living there from 1959 to 1964. Spero&#x27;s third son was born in Paris, and the artist had major solo exhibitions in Paris at Galerie Breteau in 1962, 1964, and 1968. During this period, Spero painted a series titled &quot;Black Paintings&quot; depicting themes including mothers and children, lovers, prostitutes, and hybrid, human-animal forms. This collection of works has a more personal meaning for her, rather than political.

==Later years==

Spero and Golub returned to New York in 1964, where the couple remained to live and work. The Vietnam War was raging and the Civil Rights Movement was exploding. Affected by images of the war broadcast nightly on television and the unrest and violence evident in the streets, Spero began her &quot;War Series&quot; from 1966 to 1970. These small gouache and inks on paper, executed rapidly, represented the obscenity and destruction of war. The &quot;War Series&quot; is among the most sustained and powerful group of works in the genre of history painting that condemns war and its real and lasting consequences.

An activist and early feminist, Spero was a member of the Art Workers Coalition (1968–69), Women Artists in Revolution (1969), and Ad Hoc Committee of Women Artists (1971) the work of which developed into the first women&#x27;s cooperative gallery, A.I.R. Gallery (Artists in Residence) in SoHo, of which she was a founding member. It was during this period that Spero completed her &quot;Artaud Paintings&quot; (1969–70), finding her artistic &quot;voice&quot; and developing her signature scroll paintings, the &quot;Codex Artaud&quot; (1971–1972), in which she directly quoted the writings of the poet and playwright Antonin Artaud. Uniting text and image, printed on long scrolls of paper, glued end-to-end and tacked on the walls of A.I.R., Spero violated the formal presentation, choice of valued medium and scale of framed paintings. Although her collaged and painted scrolls were Homeric in both scope and depth, the artist shunned the grandiose in content as well as style, relying instead on intimacy and immediacy, while also revealing the continuum of shocking political realities underlying enduring myths. In a 2008 interview in &quot;The Brooklyn Rail&quot; with publisher Phong Bui, Spero says of her early identification with Artaud: &quot;For me, the spoken words were part of the body, as if whatever I was trying to paint, and my own awareness of pain and anger—you can call it the destruction of the self—was an integral part, that duality. Things get split up right in the middle, which I was very much interested in at that moment in my life.&quot;

In 1974, Spero chose to focus on themes involving women and their representation in various cultures. Her &quot;Torture in Chile&quot; (1974) and the long scroll, &quot;Torture of Women&quot; (1976, 20 inches x 125 feet), interweave oral testimonies with images of women throughout history, linking the contemporary governmental brutality of Latin American dictatorships (from Amnesty International reports) with the historical repression of women. Spero re-presented previously obscured women&#x27;s histories, cultural mythology, and literary references with her expressive figuration. Rarely exhibited, &quot;Torture of Women&quot; was translated into book form in 2009.

Spero manifested a desire for women to be a part of the art conversation. Spero&#x27;s most mature work lives along the lines of a peinture feminine. This is when a woman is the subject as well as the &quot;artistic consciousness&quot;. Spero&#x27;s open-ended, thought provoking compositions of ruthless uncomfortable subject matter was depicted in hangings and friezes. This is seen in &quot;Helicopter, Victim, Astronaut&quot;, made in 1968 of gouache and ink on paper. Spero uses the crimes and assaults on women from all eras and cultures to provide intense and emotional imagery for her art and text. Political violence, sexism, and life-threatening situations that women endure are subjects she explored throughout her career, but especially in the 1960s and 19702. These interests are evidence of Spero&#x27;s conviction that &quot;the personal and the political are indistinguishable.&quot; Spero was influenced by Jean Dubuffet, Antonin Artaud, Simone de Beauvoir; and Hélène Cixous.

Developing a pictographic language of body gestures and motion, a bodily hieroglyphics, Spero reconstructed the diversity of representations of women from pre-history to the present. From 1976 through 1979, she researched and worked on &quot;Notes in Time on Women&quot;, a 20 inch by 210 foot paper scroll. She elaborated and amplified this theme in &quot;The First Language&quot; (1979–81, 20 inches by 190 feet), eschewing text altogether in favor of an irregular rhythm of painted, hand-printed, and collaged figures, thus creating her &quot;cast of characters.&quot; In 1983, Spero began using, in her large scroll paintings, an exuberantly vaginal female figure going by the name of Sheela-na-gig. The acknowledgement of Spero&#x27;s international status as a preeminent figurative and feminist artist was signaled in 1987 by her traveling retrospective exhibitions in the United States and United Kingdom. By 1988, she developed her first wall installations. For these installations, Spero extended the picture plane of the scrolls by moving her printed images directly onto the walls of museums and public spaces.

Harnessing a capacious imaginative energy and a ferocious will, Spero continued to mine the full range of power relations. In 1987, following retrospective exhibitions in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada, the artist created images that leapt from the scroll surface to the wall surface, refiguring representational forms of women over time and engaging in a dialogue with architectural space. Spero&#x27;s wall paintings in Chicago, Vienna, Dresden, Toronto, and Derry form poetic reconstructions of the diversity of representations of women from the ancient to the contemporary world, validating a subjectivity of female experience.

Spero expressed her art once in this way: &quot;I&#x27;ve always sought to express a tension in form and meaning in order to achieve a veracity. I have come to the conclusion that the art world has to join us, women artists, not we join it. When women are in leadership roles and gain rewards and recognition, then perhaps &#x27;we&#x27; (women and men) can all work together in art world actions.&quot;

Nancy Spero died of heart failure in Manhattan on October 18, 2009. She is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery, in Brooklyn, New York.

She was interviewed for the 2010 film &quot;!Women Art Revolution&quot;.

<text>The Glenn Highway (part of Alaska Route 1) is a highway in the U.S. state of Alaska, extending from Anchorage near Merrill Field to Glennallen on the Richardson Highway. The Tok Cut-Off is often considered part of the Glenn Highway, for a total length of .

==Route description==
The longest stretch of freeway in Alaska runs mostly along the Glenn Highway, beginning in north Anchorage, continuing onto the Parks Highway at the interchange of the two roads, and ending in the city limits of Wasilla, for a total of approximately 38 miles (61 km). This portion of the Glenn Highway is the only road access to Anchorage for most of the state (with the exception of the Kenai Peninsula on the Seward Highway), and as such is the main traffic corridor for Anchorage&#x27;s suburbs in the Chugiak-Eagle River and Mat-Su areas. The highest point on the highway is at &quot;Eureka Summit&quot;, which sits on the divide between the Chugach and Talkeetna mountain ranges.

==History==
The highway originated as the Palmer Road in the 1930s, to reach the agricultural colony at Palmer. During World War II it was completed to Glennallen as part of a massive program of military road and base building that also resulted in the Alaska Highway, and connected Anchorage to the continental highway system.

It is named for Captain Edwin Glenn (1857–1926), leader of an 1898 U.S. Army expedition to find an Alaska route to the Klondike gold fields (the eventual Richardson Highway). The highway was paved in the 1950s.

===Paleontology===
The &quot;Talkeetna Mountains Hadrosaur&quot; specimen was discovered in 1994 in a quarry being excavated for road material. That fall, excavation began, and was resumed in the summer of 1996. The quarry is near the Glenn Highway, approximately 150 miles northeast of Anchorage. This specimen was the first associated skeleton of an individual dinosaur discovered in all of Alaska.

==Interstate Highway System==
Glenn Highway is part of the unsigned part of the Interstate Highway System as Interstate A-1.

<text>Dhobitalao (&quot;Washerman&#x27;s Lake&quot;) is a neighborhood in the city of Mumbai (formerly Bombay) in India. Located in the South Mumbai area at an elevation of 11 m (31 ft), it used to be a location where linen was washed. In British times, dhobis used to wash the British soldiers clothes&#x27; here. It was filled up in the mid-17th century as the city began to expand. The lake used to be fed by a number of underground freshwater springs, which were recently uncovered while constructing the subway in the locality.

A public library stands over the land that was the lake. Just off the current site, is the famous Metro Adlabs (formerly Metro Cinema).
The north-eastern part of Dhobitalao is called Cavel, from the Koli name &quot;Kolwar&quot;. The Kolis of this village were converted to Christianity by the Portuguese in the 16th century. Cavel became a Christian enclave, and later immigrants of this religion, from Goa, Daman, Bassein and Salsette settled here. Other Christian enclaves in Dhobitalao are Sonapur and Dabul. 

Dhobitalao is home to the highest number of kudds, Goan clubs that house migrants from Goan villages seeks opportunities and employment in Mumbai.

<doc id="904940" wikidata="Q926996" url="?curid=904940" title="First-countable space">
<text>In topology, a branch of mathematics, a first-countable space is a topological space satisfying the &quot;first axiom of countability&quot;. Specifically, a space formula_1 is said to be first-countable if each point has a countable neighbourhood basis (local base). That is, for each point formula_2 in formula_1 there exists a sequence formula_4 of neighbourhoods of formula_2 such that for any neighbourhood formula_6 of formula_2 there exists an integer formula_8 with formula_9 contained in formula_10
Since every neighborhood of any point contains an open neighborhood of that point, the neighbourhood basis can be chosen without loss of generality to consist of open neighborhoods.

== Examples and counterexamples ==

The majority of &#x27;everyday&#x27; spaces in mathematics are first-countable. In particular, every metric space is first-countable. To see this, note that the set of open balls centered at formula_2 with radius formula_12 for integers form a countable local base at formula_13

An example of a space that is not first-countable is the cofinite topology on an uncountable set (such as the real line). More generally, the Zariski topology on an algebraic variety over an uncountable field is not first-countable.

Another counterexample is the ordinal space formula_14 where formula_15 is the first uncountable ordinal number. The element formula_15 is a limit point of the subset formula_17 even though no sequence of elements in formula_17 has the element formula_15 as its limit. In particular, the point formula_15 in the space formula_14 does not have a countable local base. Since formula_15 is the only such point, however, the subspace formula_23 is first-countable.

The quotient space formula_24 where the natural numbers on the real line are identified as a single point is not first countable. However, this space has the property that for any subset formula_25 and every element formula_2 in the closure of formula_27 there is a sequence in formula_25 converging to formula_13 A space with this sequence property is sometimes called a Fréchet–Urysohn space.

First-countability is strictly weaker than second-countability. Every second-countable space is first-countable, but any uncountable discrete space is first-countable but not second-countable.

== Properties ==

One of the most important properties of first-countable spaces is that given a subset formula_27 a point formula_2 lies in the closure of formula_25 if and only if there exists a sequence formula_33 in formula_25 that converges to formula_13 (In other words, every first-countable space is a Fréchet-Urysohn space and thus also a sequential space.) This has consequences for limits and continuity. In particular, if formula_36 is a function on a first-countable space, then formula_36 has a limit formula_38 at the point formula_2 if and only if for every sequence formula_40 where formula_41 for all formula_42 we have formula_43 Also, if formula_36 is a function on a first-countable space, then formula_36 is continuous if and only if whenever formula_40 then formula_47

In first-countable spaces, sequential compactness and countable compactness are equivalent properties. However, there exist examples of sequentially compact, first-countable spaces that are not compact (these are necessarily not metrizable spaces). One such space is the ordinal space formula_48 Every first-countable space is compactly generated.

Every subspace of a first-countable space is first-countable. Any countable product of a first-countable space is first-countable, although uncountable products need not be.

<text>Cable News Network International or CNN International (CNNi, simply branded on-air as CNN) is an international television channel and website, owned by CNN Worldwide. CNN International carries news-related programming worldwide; it cooperates with sister network CNN&#x27;s national and international news bureaus. Unlike its sister channel, CNN, a North American-only subscription service, CNN International is carried on a variety of TV platforms across the world, and broadcast from studios inside and outside the United States, in Atlanta, New York City, London, Mumbai, Hong Kong, and Abu Dhabi. In some countries, it is available as a free-to-air network. The service is aimed at the overseas market, similar to BBC News, France 24, CGTN, DW, RT, DD India, NHK World, TRT World or Al Jazeera English.

==History==

===Early years===
CNN International began broadcasting on September 1, 1985, at first primarily broadcasting to American business travelers in hotels. The first studio for CNNI was at CNN&#x27;s original studio building known as Techwood, home at that time to all of Turner Broadcasting System&#x27;s channels. Today, it is home to the Techwood Studios complex that houses the entertainment channels. Other early studios in Atlanta were tucked away in various corners of the CNN Center, and the newsroom lacked even a digital clock. The vast majority of the network&#x27;s programming originally consisted of simulcasts of the two domestic CNN channels (CNN/US and Headline News). In the United Kingdom, the channel began broadcasting on September 17, 1987, the office was located at 25/28 Old Burlington Street, London. In 1990, however, the amount of news programming produced by CNNI especially for international viewers increased significantly.

Paul Vessey, an executive of CNN International, said in 1992 that CNN will go international style and get &quot;less and less American&quot;.

A new newsroom and studio complex was built in 1994, as CNN decided to compete against BBC World Service Television&#x27;s news programming. CNNI emerged as an internationally oriented news channel, with staff members of various national backgrounds, even though some accusations of a pro-U.S. editorial bias persist. CNN International was awarded the Liberty Medal on July 4, 1997. Ted Turner, in accepting the medal on behalf of the network, said: &quot;My idea was, we&#x27;re just going to give people the facts... We didn&#x27;t have to show liberty and democracy as good and show socialism or totalitarianism as bad. If we just showed them both the way they were ... everybody&#x27;s going to choose liberty and democracy.&quot;

===New international era (1995–2005)===
In 1995, creative director Morgan Almeida defined a progressive rebranding strategy, to target CNNI&#x27;s diverse global market, making the on-air look less overtly American and with a cleaner, simpler &quot;international&quot; aesthetic going forward. The word &quot;International&quot; in the channel&#x27;s logo was replaced with a globe, and the new branding featured numerous international locations filmed in time-lapse, channel idents created in CGI with Velvet Design in Munich, and a news brand designed with The Attik in New York.

The regionalization of CNN International was through the efforts of Chris Cramer, joining CNN in 1996. CNN International was split into three feeds Asia, Europe/Africa/Middle East and Latin America. By 1998, CNN International produced 90% of its content, up from 50% in 1996. The rest of the percentage is for domestic CNN broadcasts from the United States. According to an annual PAX survey, in 1998 and 1999 CNN International was the leading cable and satellite network in Asia in terms of viewership among affluent households and among business decision-makers. CNN International planned to air shows in 1999 including World Beat, its popular weekly international music segment, and the global arts round-up Art Club. The channel was banned in China in June 1999, on the tenth anniversary of the Tianamnen Square massacre.

===2006–2009 revamp===
The network undertook another major rebranding effort in 2006 overseen by Mark Wright and London agency Kemistry. The ticker was replaced by a flipper, on-screen graphics were more unified and from October 2007 until August 2008, new studios were progressively rolled out. However, on January 1, 2009, CNN International adopted the &quot;lower-thirds&quot; that CNN/US had introduced a month earlier which was inspired by the clean modern design of the CNNI rebrand efforts.

In the U.S., CNNI North America was distributed overnight and on weekends over the CNNfn financial channel, until that channel&#x27;s demise in December 2004. It is now available as a standalone, full-time channel, usually as part of high-tier packages of subscription providers including Time Warner Cable, AT&amp;T U-Verse, Verizon FiOS and Cox Communications.

===Going beyond borders (2009–2013)===
From January until September 2009, CNN International adopted more programs that became geared towards a primetime European audience with a few titled after CNN International personalities, most notably the interview program &quot;Amanpour&quot;. On September 21, 2009, the channel launched a new tagline &quot;Go Beyond Borders&quot;, along with a new logo, and consolidated its general newscasts (&quot;World News&quot;, &quot;CNN Today&quot;, &quot;World News Asia&quot;, &quot;World News Europe&quot; and &quot;Your World Today&quot;) into a single newscast entitled &quot;World Report&quot;.

The slogan &quot;Go Beyond Borders&quot; emphasizes the international perspective that gives the information in this string and the plurality of the audiences. With this tagline, CNN also refers to the various platforms to disseminate their content. The new image was created by the creativity and marketing department, and agency CNN Tooth &amp; Nail. An important element of the rebrand was a new evening program that added the broadcast of programs &quot;Amanpour&quot; and &quot;World One&quot;. The makeover of CNN International has been subject to a lot of criticism on both the new prime-time lineup and the redesigned graphics.

On January 11, 2009, in a bid to compete directly with Al Jazeera English, the network launched a new production center: CNN Abu Dhabi, based in the United Arab Emirates. Then, CNN International adapted half-hour shows in its schedule with a new evening prime program for the Middle East viewers, &quot;Prism&quot;.

In 2010, CNN International launched new programs for its evening lineup to improve its schedule. In 2011, programs from CNN U.S. were added to the CNN International schedule, including the talk program &quot;Piers Morgan Live&quot; which was later canceled and replaced with CNN Tonight hosted by Don Lemon.

===This is CNN (2013–present)===
&quot;This is CNN&quot; represents CNN International&#x27;s rebrand with new sets and output in full 16:9 high definition. The &quot;This is CNN&quot; slogan is also used on its sister network CNN in the United States. The managing director of CNN International from 2003 to May 2019 was Tony Maddox.

In 2019, CNN International announced it was reducing its programming and staff based in London to reduce costs, with CNNI losing $10 million per year. Later that year, CNNI cancelled its Asia-Pacific Primetime Show, &quot;News Stream&quot;, anchored by Kristie Lu Stout, effectively ending production output from its Hong Kong Studios.

In 2022, WarnerMedia closed CNN International in Russia due to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.

==Regional and online versions==
There are five variants of CNN International:
* CNN International Asia Pacific, based in Hong Kong, China; Taipei, Taiwan and Manila, Philippines
* CNN International Europe/Middle East/Africa, based in London, United Kingdom
* CNN International in Latin America, based in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.
* CNN International North America, based in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.
* CNN International South Asia, based in New Delhi, India

The schedules of the different regional versions no longer differ significantly from each other, but there are still minor variations such as content during the commercial breaks (e.g. weather forecasts and local airtimes shown).

CNN has reported that its broadcast agreement in mainland China includes an arrangement that its signal must pass through a Chinese-controlled satellite. With this method of transmission, Chinese authorities have been able to black out CNNI segments at will. CNN has also said that its broadcasts are not widely available in mainland China, but rather only in certain diplomatic compounds, hotels, and apartment blocks.

In June 2015, CNN International was made available online in the United States for CNN/U.S subscribers on participating television providers through the CNNgo service.

===CNNj===

CNNj is a Japanese version of CNN International distributed by Japan Cable Television that first launched on March 1, 2003. CNNj is tailored specifically for a Japanese audience, with all programming broadcast from 7:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m. (Japan Standard Time) being translated into Japanese. The channel used to broadcast a mixture of CNN International and CNN/US, but since 2008, CNNj has been a direct relay of CNN International Asia Pacific.

Starting late 2010, the high-definition feed of CNN US was launched in Japan for American viewers under the name &quot;CNN/US HD&quot;, the first such feed available outside of the United States.

==Simulcasts between CNNI and CNN/US, and between CNNI and CNN Max==

Apart from during the earliest days of the network, CNNI, until the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, produced almost all of its programming, and generally only simulcast CNN/US&#x27;s primetime output. However, since the start of the outbreak, CNNI&#x27;s programming has been significantly cut back, although international programmes have slowly been reintroduced. However, CNNI still only opts out of CNN US for less than the 24-hour clock period, and CNNI currently draws from the feed of the main CNN channel for all editions of &quot;CNN This Morning&quot;, &quot;Erin Burnett Outfront&quot;, &quot;Anderson Cooper 360°&quot; and &quot;CNN Tonight&quot;. CNNI also broadcasts most of &quot;The Lead with Jake Tapper&quot;. At the weekend, CNNI simulcasts much of the entire weekend schedule, apart from the first hour of &quot;CNN This Morning&quot; and some of &quot;CNN Newsroom&quot;. Programs seen on the global network include the Sunday edition of &quot;Inside Politics&quot;, &quot; State of the Union&quot;, &quot;Fareed Zakaria GPS&quot;, &quot;Smerconish&quot; and some &quot;CNN Special Investigations Unit&quot; documentaries.

CNNI also simulcasts CNN/US newscasts whenever major events happen in the United States or around the world. Also, certain scheduled broadcasts, such as &quot;New Year&#x27;s Eve Live&quot; and &quot;Election Night in America&quot;, are aired on CNN International. Likewise, CNN/US occasionally turns to CNNI newscasts, primarily when major international news breaks during overnight hours in the U.S.

During simulcasts, the timepiece of CNN/US is replaced by that of CNNI, and CNN/US&#x27;s red logo on a white field is retained in the on-screen graphic, aligning with CNN/US as the originating source.

As of August 2014, following the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, a permanent simulcast of CNNI&#x27;s block of &quot;Newsroom&quot; with Rosemary Church and Errol Barnett was added to the late-night lineup of CNN/US, serving as a lead-in to &quot;Early Start&quot;. In late 2015, John Vause and anchor Isha Sesay began to anchor a two-hour block of the simulcast from CNN studios in Los Angeles.

In 2017, CNN International began simulcasting the first hour of the weekday edition of &quot;New Day&quot; and on September 10, 2018, &quot;The Lead with Jake Tapper&quot; started to be simulcast on CNNI.

In 2019, CNN International announced it was reducing its programming and staff based in London to reduce costs. Consequently, an additional two hours of simulcasts with CNN/US on weekdays were added – the first hour of &quot;Early Start&quot; and the second hour of &quot;New Day&quot;, resulting in CNNI broadcasting CNN/US for seven hours each weekday.

By mid-April 2020, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on CNN&#x27;s operations, CNN/US weekday programming accounted for 14 hours within each 24-hour cycle of CNN International broadcasting time, with CNN International&#x27;s daily worldwide programming in Europe consisting of five hours of the international version of CNN Newsroom, from 5 a.m. – 10 a.m. GMT, and five internationally focused programs: &quot;CNN World Sport&quot;, &quot;First Move with Julia Chatterley&quot; and &quot;Connect the World with Becky Anderson&quot; between the hours of 1 p.m. – 4 p.m. GMT; with &quot;Amanpour&quot; and &quot;Quest Means Business&quot;, between 6 p.m. – 8 p.m. GMT. Each of those internationally focused programs air for one hour each, except &quot;Connect the World&quot;, which airs for two hours and if live news events are slated to happen during &quot;Amanpour&quot;&#x27;s timeslot, that show may air at a different time. Weekend simulcasts of CNN/US were increased with CNN/US&#x27;s live news output shown in full at the time. Apart from between 5 a.m. – 11 a.m. GMT when editions of the international version of CNN Newsroom were aired alongside magazine programs, CNN International only showed its programming – consisting of magazine programs – when CNN/US was broadcasting repeat showings of programs it had aired earlier that day.

Later in 2020, live weekend domestic programming on CNN International was slightly reduced to accommodate newer editions of magazine programs although apart from during the North American overnight period, CNNI still does not produce any of its news coverage at the weekend although on weekdays, &quot;CNN World Sport&quot; was re-introduced and is broadcast instead of the final 30 minutes of &quot;New Day&quot; and June 2021 saw the return of other weekday programs with international programming now airing on weekdays between 8 am and 4 pm Eastern Time which means that CNN U.S. daytime rolling daytime news programming is once again not seen on CNN International on weekdays.

Since the beginning of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, CNN International has been augmenting CNN/US programming during hours that usually would be repeats or specials, such as overnights and late in the evening on Saturdays and Sundays. This has effectively given CNN/US rolling live 24-hour coverage throughout most of the conflict.

On September 27, 2023, selected CNNI programmes were simulcast on CNN Max, CNN&#x27;s streaming-only channel available on the US streaming service Max. The CNN International programmes simulcast there include &quot;State of the Race with Kasie Hunt&quot; (currently not airing), &quot;One World with Zain Asher &amp; Bianna Golodryga&quot;, &quot;Amanpour&quot;, &quot;Quest Means Business&quot;, and various editions of &quot;CNN Newsroom&quot;. Since February and March 2024, CNN Max editions of &quot;CNN Newsroom&quot; presented by Amara Walker, Fredricka Whitfield, and Rahel Solomon, have also aired on CNNI.

January 2024 saw the return of &quot;First Move with Julia Chatterley&quot;. The program airs just before the start of the Asian trading day, as opposed to just before the start of the American trading day. Consequently, CNNI&#x27;s weekday simulcast of CNN US programming now begins later but still operates on weeknights between 7 pm and midnight ET and between 5 am and 8 am ET.

==High definition==
CNN International HD is the high-definition simulcast feed of the channel broadcasting at 1920x1080i, which was launched in September 2012. Before June 3, 2013, only programming from CNN/US was available natively in HD, while shows made for CNN International were produced in 4:3 576i. In February 2013, the European SD feed of CNN International began broadcasting in widescreen by downscaling the HD feed, which resulted in all 4:3-native programming being broadcast in pillarbox until the June 3 switchover, and finalized on June 17 of the same year, when the switchover was completed.

Following the March 2003 launch of CNNj, a live relay of CNN/US and CNN International, with simultaneous audio translation into Japanese, starting in late 2010, the high definition feed of CNN/US was launched in Japan under the name CNN HD. CNN/US (both SD and HD) is also available on Greater China-based satellite service DishHD, a subsidiary of Dish Network in the United States.

On June 28, 2016, CNN International HD was launched for Sky customers in the UK (including on Freesat from Sky), on channel 506 or 579, making the next news channel launch in the 600s. The HD version is available free-to-air within the British Isles, and is provided on satellite and IPTV services, and also live-streamed for U.K. users (and geo-blocked outside the U.K.), through CNN International&#x27;s official U.K. video site. However, viewers with non-proprietary Freesat boxes will need to add the channel manually as Freesat does not market CNN International HD publicly as part of its offerings.

==Online==
CNN debuted its news website CNN.com (initially an experiment known as &quot;CNN Interactive&quot;) on August 30, 1995. The site attracted growing interest over its first decade and is now one of the most popular news websites in the world. The widespread growth of blogs, social media and user-generated content have influenced the site, and blogs in particular have focused CNN&#x27;s previously scattershot online offerings, most noticeably in the development and launch of CNN Pipeline in late 2005. In April 2009, CNN.com ranked third place among online global news sites in unique users in the U.S. according to Nielsen/NetRatings; with an increase of 11% over the previous year.

CNN Pipeline was the name of a paid subscription service, its corresponding website, and a content delivery client that provided streams of live video from up to four sources (or &quot;pipes&quot;), on-demand access to CNN stories and reports, and optional pop-up &quot;news alerts&quot; to computer users. The installable client was available to users of PCs running Microsoft Windows. There was also a browser-based &quot;web client&quot; that did not require installation. In July 2007, the service was discontinued and replaced with a free streaming service.

The now-defunct topical news program &quot;Judy Woodruff&#x27;s Inside Politics&quot; was the first CNN program to feature a round-up of blogs in 2005. Blog coverage was expanded when &quot;Inside Politics&quot; was folded into &quot;The Situation Room&quot;. In 2006, CNN launched CNN Exchange and CNN iReport, initiatives designed to further introduce and centralize the impact of everything from blogging to citizen journalism within the CNN brand. CNN iReport which features user-submitted photos and video, has achieved considerable traction, with increasingly professional-looking reports filed by amateur journalists, many still in high school or college. The iReport gained more prominence when observers of the Virginia Tech shootings sent in first-hand photos of what was going on during the shootings.

In early 2008, CNN began maintaining a live-streaming broadcast available to those who receive CNN at home. CNN International is broadcast live, as part of the RealNetworks SuperPass subscription outside the U.S. CNN also offers several RSS feeds and podcasts.

On April 18, 2008, CNN.com was targeted by Chinese hackers in retaliation for the channel&#x27;s coverage of the 2008 Tibetan unrest. CNN reported that they took preventive measures after news broke of the impending attack. The company was honored at the 2008 Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Awards for development and implementation of an integrated and portable IP-based live, edit and store-and-forward digital newsgathering system.

On October 24, 2009, CNN launched a new version of the CNN.com website, revamping it by adding a new &quot;sign up&quot; option where users may create their user name, a new &quot;CNN Pulse&quot; (beta) feature along a new red color theme. However, most of the news archived on the website has been deleted. CNN also has a channel on the popular video-sharing site YouTube, but its videos can only be viewed in the United States, a source of criticism among YouTube users worldwide. 

In April 2010, CNN announced via Twitter its upcoming food blog called &quot;Eatocracy&quot;, which will &quot;cover all news related to food – from recalls to health issues to culture.&quot; CNN had an internet relay chat (IRC) network at chat.cnn.com. CNN placed a live chat with Benjamin Netanyahu on the network in 1998.

CNN also maintains a wire service known as CNN Wire, a CNN Newsource division.

==Criticism==
=== Accusations of U.S.-centric viewpoint ===
Former CNN Beijing and Tokyo bureau chief Rebecca MacKinnon described how the news-gathering priorities of CNN International were skewed to &quot;produce stories and reports that would be of interest to CNN USA.&quot; Nevertheless, Jane Arraf, a former correspondent who was with the Council on Foreign Relations and later served as a Middle East-based correspondent for Al Jazeera English, noted that when she spoke on international affairs, CNN International would usually give her more airtime than CNN/US. For its part, former CNN executive Eason Jordan has defended CNN International&#x27;s &quot;international&quot; perspective, saying &quot;No matter what CNN International does, as long as CNN&#x27;s headquarters is in the United States people are going to say, well, it&#x27;s an American service. But the reality is that it&#x27;s an international service based in the United States, and we don&#x27;t make any apologies about that.&quot;

=== Accusations of pro-American bias ===
CNN is one of the world&#x27;s largest news organizations, and its international channel, CNN International is the leading international news channel in terms of viewer reach. Unlike the BBC and its network of reporters and bureaus, CNN International makes extensive use of affiliated reporters that are local to, and often directly affected by, the events they are reporting. The effect is a more immediate, less detached style of on-the-ground coverage. This has done little to stem criticism, largely from Middle Eastern nations, that CNN International reports news from a pro-American perspective. This is a marked contrast to domestic criticisms that often portray CNN as having a &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;anti-American&quot; bias. 

=== Accusations of anti-China bias ===
A Chinese website, anti-cnn.com, had accused CNN and western media in general of biased reporting against China, with the catchphrase &quot;Don&#x27;t be so CNN&quot; entering the Chinese lexicon as meaning one should not be biased and use exaggerated language in describing an event. Pictures used by CNN were allegedly edited to have completely different meanings from the original ones. In addition, the channel was accused of largely ignoring pro-China voices during the Olympic Torch Relay debacle in San Francisco.

=== Accusations of propaganda and censorship ===
In October 2011, Amber Lyon gave her claims to the Syrian government news agency SANA that she had been directed by CNN to report selectively, repetitively, and falsely to sway public opinion in favor of direct American aggression against Iran and Syria, and that this was common practice under CNN. She subsequently repeated this claim, addressing the degraded state of journalistic ethics in an interview during which she also discussed the Bahraini episode, suggesting paid-for content was also taken from Georgia, Kazakhstan, and other states, that the War on Terrorism had also been employed as a pretext to pre-empt substantive investigative journalism within the U.S., and that following the Bahrain reporting, her investigative department had been terminated and &quot;reorganized&quot;, and her severance and employee benefits used as a threat to intimidate and attempt to purchase her subsequent silence.

Lyon claimed to have met with Tony Maddox, president of CNN International, twice about this issue in 2011 and had claimed that during the second meeting, she was threatened and intimated to stop speaking on the matter. CNN issued a detailed response to Lyon&#x27;s claims about its coverage of Bahrain.

Lyon also claimed on the Russian news channel RT that CNN reporters, headed by Maddox, have been instructed to over-cover Iran as a form of propaganda, and that CNN International has been paid by the Bahraini government to produce and air news segments intentionally painting them in a positive light.

CNN became the official broadcaster of one of the biggest events of the UAE in 2021 when Dubai was hosting the Expo 2020. The official announcement was made in July 2021. However, months later, human rights organizations began to raise concerns around CNN&#x27;s participation in the event, pointing out that the CNN was lending its legitimacy to the Emirates&#x27; propaganda efforts. Analyzing CNN&#x27;s coverage of the UAE over 10 months, critics accused the news media of running a PR for the UAE. The rights groups also notified of the UAE&#x27;s poor human rights and women&#x27;s rights records They further urged CNN to be transparent about its dealings with the Arab nation.

=== Other dismissals ===
On July 7, 2010, Octavia Nasr, senior Middle East editor and a CNN journalist for 20 years, was fired after she expressed admiration on her Twitter account for a militant Muslim cleric and former Hezbollah leader who had recently died.

<text>AvCraft Technical Services was a Myrtle Beach, South Carolina U.S., based company that supplied maintenance and technical support services for owners/operators of Bombardier Dash 8, ATR 42, ATR 72 and Fairchild Dornier 328 turboprop and jet aircraft.

Avcraft operated from a 136,000 sq ft complex of hangars, paint facilities and back shops that provide FAA, EASA and Transport Canada-approved heavy maintenance, as well as structural repairs, modifications and refurbishment.

==History==
The company began its life as AvCraft Support Services, Inc., the North American operating subsidiary of Avcraft Inc. The parent company purchased the production rights for the 328JET from the receivers of Fairchild Dornier GmbH in December 2002 following the European company&#x27;s demise. The final transfers of the type and production certificates were completed in the third quarter of 2003. The company intended to restart 328Jet production in Germany during 2004 and was bringing the production of its wing, formerly outsourced, in-house.

By August 2004, AvCraft Inc. had re-entered the regional airline market and was entering the corporate aircraft market, placing previously unsold Dornier product with a number of customers. It exhibited at the 2004 Farnborough Airshow and joined major industry associations. However, in March, 2005, the company went into administration citing a lack of cash caused, it claimed, by an airline failing to accept delivery of completed aircraft.

AvCraft Support Services continued to operate while under company administration, initially focusing exclusively on MRO support for the Fairchild Dornier 328 family, operating from a facility at Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.

In September 2009 AvCraft Support Services entered into a joint venture agreement with Indaer International, a commercial aircraft technical services company with offices in Colombia and Canada. The joint venture initially targeted heavy maintenance on ATR regional turboprops and then expanded to include Dash 8 aircraft too.

In September 2010 Indaer International led a group of investors that purchased AvCraft Support Services out of administration, renaming it AvCraft Technical Services.

In the summer of 2015, AvCraft filed for bankruptcy, laying off all remaining employees and closing down.

==Capabilities==
AvCraft holds US, European, Canadian and Venezuelan approvals to provide MRO services in their 136,000 sq. ft. facility and 500,000 sq. ft. of ramp space. The company is ideally situated in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, AvCraft can easily provide easy access to North American, South American, Caribbean and European customers.

<doc id="904953" wikidata="Q1939743" url="?curid=904953" title="West Coast lady">
<text>The West Coast lady (Vanessa annabella) is one of three North American species of brush-footed butterflies known colloquially as the &quot;painted ladies&quot;. &quot;V. annabella&quot; occurs throughout much of the western US and southwestern Canada. The other two species are the cosmopolitan &quot;Vanessa cardui&quot; (painted lady) and the eastern &quot;Vanessa virginiensis&quot; (American painted lady). This species has also been considered a subspecies of the South American &quot;Vanessa carye&quot; and is frequently misspelled as &quot;anabella&quot;.

==Distinguishing features==
Aside from general differences in distribution, &quot;V. annabella&quot; can be distinguished from the other two painted ladies of North America as follows:

Most conspicuously, it lacks obvious ventral eyespots on the hindwings; there are two large ones on &quot;V. virginiensis&quot; and four small ones on &quot;V. cardui&quot;. Like the latter, it also lacks a white dot in the pinkish-orange subapical field of the ventral and dorsal forewings. Its upperwing coloration has the purest orange of the three; the American painted lady is usually quite reddish.

A less reliable indicator is the row of black eyespots on the dorsal submarginal hindwing. These are usually of roughly equal size in &quot;V. cardui&quot; and lack blue centers, though the summer morph may have a few tiny ones. In the other two, usually two eyespots are larger and have more conspicuous blue centers. In &quot;V. virginiensis&quot;, these normally are the spot at each end of the row, whereas in the present species it is the two middle ones.

== Developmental stages ==
The developmental stages of &quot;Vanessa annabella&quot; can be divided into eight different stages: first instar larva, second instar larva, third instar larva, fourth instar larva, fifth instar larva, prepupa, pupa, and adult. In their adult stage, there is subtle sexual dimorphism between males and females, as females have a more rounded hindwing compared to their male counterparts. The color pattern is the same on both males and females: “tawny orange with black markings, white subapical forewing spots, and blue pupilled hindwing ocelli.&quot; Their open wing expanse averages generally vary between 40 and 48 mm, with females often being larger than males. The total time it takes for this species to develop is typically between 30 and 36 days.

== Natural history ==
This butterfly is often seen basking in open areas in its habitat. Their habitats are mostly localized to open areas from the Upper Sonoran to the Canadian zones. The West Coast Lady is a multiple brooded species, meaning that there are more than one set of offspring within a single breeding season. Sightings of this butterfly have been captured from May to December in Huntington Beach by Ron Vanderhoff. Most captures of this butterfly are usually made in April and May. They are generally distributed in Orange County in places of lower elevations.

&quot;Vanessa annabella&quot; feeds on plants in the families of Malvacae and Urtiacae. In Southern California, the common native hostplants include &quot;Urtica holosericea&quot; (Urticaceae), &quot;Sida&quot; species, &quot;Sphaeralcea ambigua&quot; (Malvaceae), and &quot;Sidalcea malvaeflora&quot; (Malvacae). Their eggs are pale green and are laid singly on the upperside of the hostplant leaves. Additionally, their pupation sites are either on the leaves of the hostplant or on nearby objects such as twigs or branches.

Both the males and females of the species visit flowers. During the afternoon, males are typically found congregating in areas such as hilltops, forest openings, glades, meadows, streamside slopes, and patches of dry earth which are particularly suitable for basking in the sun. At these areas, males spend a large amount of time and energy chasing each other and sometimes engaging in courtship and mating with females. Though females do not congregate in a similar manner to the males, they are likely to be found on hilltops feeding, seeking foodplants, or ovipositing.

<doc id="904954" wikidata="Q187440" url="?curid=904954" title="Hives">
<text>Hives, also known as urticaria, is a kind of skin rash with red and/or flesh-colored, raised, itchy bumps. Hives may burn or sting. The patches of rash may appear on different body parts, with variable duration from minutes to days, and do not leave any long-lasting skin change. Fewer than 5% of cases last for more than six weeks (a condition known as chronic urticaria). The condition frequently recurs.
Hives frequently occur following an infection or as a result of an allergic reaction such as to medication, insect bites, or food. Psychological stress, cold temperature, or vibration may also be a trigger. In half of cases the cause remains unknown. Risk factors include having conditions such as hay fever or asthma. Diagnosis is typically based on appearance. Patch testing may be useful to determine the allergy.
Prevention is by avoiding whatever it is that causes the condition. Treatment is typically with antihistamines, with the second generation antihistamines such as fexofenadine, loratadine and cetirizine being preferred due to less risk of sedation and cognitive impairment. In refractory (obstinate) cases, corticosteroids or leukotriene inhibitors may also be used. Keeping the environmental temperature cool is also useful. For cases that last more than six weeks, long-term antihistamine therapy is indicated. Immunosuppressants such as omalizumab or cyclosporin may also be used.
About 20% of people are affected at some point in their lives. Cases of short duration occur equally in males and females, while cases of long duration are more common in females. Cases of short duration are more common among children, while cases of long duration are more common among those who are middle aged. Hives have been described since at least the time of Hippocrates. The term urticaria is from the Latin &quot;urtica&quot; meaning &quot;nettle&quot;.
==Signs and symptoms==

Hives, or urticaria, is a form of skin rash with red, raised, itchy bumps. They may also burn or sting. Hives can appear anywhere on the surface of the skin. Whether the trigger is allergic or not, a complex release of inflammatory mediators, including histamine from cutaneous mast cells, results in fluid leakage from superficial blood vessels. Hives may be pinpoint in size or several inches in diameter, they can be individual or confluent, coalescing into larger forms.

About 20% of people are affected. Cases of short duration occur equally in males and females, lasting a few days and without leaving any long-lasting skin changes. Cases of long duration are more common in females. Cases of short duration are more common among children while cases of long duration are more common among those who are middle aged. Fewer than 5% of cases last for more than six weeks. The condition frequently recurs. In half of cases of hives, the cause remains unknown.

Angioedema is a related condition (also from allergic and nonallergic causes), though fluid leakage is from much deeper blood vessels in the subcutaneous or submucosal layers. Individual hives that are painful, last more than 24 hours, or leave a bruise as they heal are more likely to be a more serious condition called urticarial vasculitis. Hives caused by stroking the skin (often linear in appearance) are due to a benign condition called dermatographic urticaria.

==Cause==
Hives can also be classified by the purported causative agent. Many different substances in the environment may cause hives, including medications, food and physical agents. In perhaps more than 50% of people with chronic hives of unknown cause, it is due to an autoimmune reaction. Risk factors include having conditions such as hay fever or asthma.

===Medications===
Drugs that have caused allergic reactions evidenced as hives include codeine, sulphate of morphia, dextroamphetamine, aspirin, ibuprofen, penicillin, clotrimazole, trichazole, sulfonamides, anticonvulsants, cefaclor, piracetam, vaccines, and antidiabetic drugs. The antidiabetic sulphonylurea glimepiride, in particular, has been documented to induce allergic reactions manifesting as hives.

===Food===
The most common food allergies in adults are shellfish and nuts. The most common food allergies in children are shellfish, nuts, eggs, wheat, and soy. One study showed Balsam of Peru, which is in many processed foods, to be the most common cause of immediate contact urticaria. Another food allergy that can cause hives is alpha-gal allergy, which may cause sensitivity to milk and red meat. A less common cause is exposure to certain bacteria, such as &quot;Streptococcus&quot; species or possibly &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;.

===Infection or environmental agent===

Hives including chronic spontaneous hives can be a complication and symptom of a parasitic infection, such as blastocystosis and strongyloidiasis among others.

The rash that develops from poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac contact is commonly mistaken for urticaria. This rash is caused by contact with urushiol and results in a form of contact dermatitis called urushiol-induced contact dermatitis. Urushiol is spread by contact but can be washed off with a strong grease- or oil-dissolving detergent and cool water and rubbing ointments.

===Dermatographic urticaria===

Dermatographic urticaria (also known as dermatographism or &quot;skin writing&quot;) is marked by the appearance of weals or welts on the skin as a result of scratching or firm stroking of the skin. Seen in 4–5% of the population, it is one of the most common types of urticaria, in which the skin becomes raised and inflamed when stroked, scratched, rubbed, and sometimes even slapped.

The skin reaction usually becomes evident soon after the scratching and disappears within 30 minutes. Dermatographism is the most common form of a subset of chronic hives, acknowledged as &quot;physical hives&quot;.

It stands in contrast to the linear reddening that does not itch seen in healthy people who are scratched. In most cases, the cause is unknown, although it may be preceded by a viral infection, antibiotic therapy, or emotional upset. Dermatographism is diagnosed by applying pressure by stroking or scratching the skin. The hives should develop within a few minutes. Unless the skin is highly sensitive and reacts continually, treatment is not needed. Taking antihistamines can reduce the response in cases that are annoying to the person.

===Pressure or delayed pressure===
This type of hives can occur right away, precisely after a pressure stimulus or as a deferred response to sustained pressure being enforced to the skin. In the deferred form, the hives only appear after about six hours from the initial application of pressure to the skin. Under normal circumstances, these hives are not the same as those witnessed with most urticariae. Instead, the protrusion in the affected areas is typically more spread out. The hives may last from eight hours to three days. The source of the pressure on the skin can happen from tight fitted clothing, belts, clothing with tough straps, walking, leaning against an object, standing, sitting on a hard surface, etc. The areas of the body most commonly affected are the hands, feet, trunk, abdomen, buttocks, legs and face. Although this appears to be very similar to dermatographism, the cardinal difference is that the swelled skin areas do not become visible quickly and tend to last much longer. This form of the skin disease is, however, rare.

===Cholinergic or stress===
Cholinergic urticaria (CU) is one of the physical urticaria which is provoked during sweating events such as exercise, bathing, staying in a heated environment, or emotional stress. The hives produced are typically smaller than classic hives and are generally shorter-lasting.

Multiple subtypes have been elucidated, each of which require distinct treatment.

===Cold-induced===

The cold type of urticaria is caused by exposure of the skin to extreme cold, damp and windy conditions; it occurs in two forms. The rare form is hereditary and becomes evident as hives all over the body 9 to 18 hours after cold exposure. The common form of cold urticaria demonstrates itself with the rapid onset of hives on the face, neck, or hands after exposure to cold. Cold urticaria is common and lasts for an average of five to six years. The population most affected is young adults, between 18 and 25 years old. Many people with the condition also have dermographism and cholinergic hives.

Severe reactions can be seen with exposure to cold water; swimming in cold water is the most common cause of a severe reaction. This can cause a massive discharge of histamine, resulting in low blood pressure, fainting, shock and even loss of life. Cold urticaria is diagnosed by dabbing an ice cube against the skin of the forearm for 1 to 5 minutes. A distinct hive should develop if a person has cold urticaria. This is different from the normal redness that can be seen in people without cold urticaria. People with cold urticaria need to learn to protect themselves from a hasty drop in body temperature. Regular antihistamines are not generally efficacious. One particular antihistamine, cyproheptadine (Periactin), has been found to be useful. The tricyclic antidepressant doxepin has been found to be effective blocking agents of histamine. Finally, a medication named ketotifen, which keeps mast cells from discharging histamine, has also been employed with widespread success.

===Solar urticaria===
This form of the disease occurs on areas of the skin exposed to the sun; the condition becomes evident within minutes of exposure.

===Water-induced===

This type of urticaria is also termed rare and occurs upon contact with water. The response is not temperature-dependent and the skin appears similar to the cholinergic form of the disease. The appearance of hives is within one to 15 minutes of contact with the water and can last from 10 minutes to two hours. This kind of hives does not seem to be stimulated by histamine discharge like the other physical hives. Most researchers believe this condition is actually skin sensitivity to additives in the water, such as chlorine. Water urticaria is diagnosed by dabbing tap water and distilled water to the skin and observing the gradual response. Aquagenic urticaria is treated with capsaicin (Zostrix) administered to the chafed skin. This is the same treatment used for shingles. Antihistamines are of questionable benefit in this instance since histamine is not the causative factor.

===Exercise===
The condition was first distinguished in 1980. People with exercise urticaria (EU) experience hives, itchiness, shortness of breath and low blood pressure five to 30 minutes after beginning exercise. These symptoms can progress to shock and even sudden death. Jogging is the most common exercise to cause EU, but it is not induced by a hot shower, fever, or with fretfulness. This differentiates EU from cholinergic urticaria.

EU sometimes occurs only when someone exercises within 30 minutes of eating particular foods, such as wheat or shellfish. For these individuals, exercising alone or eating the injuring food without exercising produces no symptoms. EU can be diagnosed by having the person exercise and then observing the symptoms. This method must be used with caution and only with the appropriate resuscitative measures at hand. EU can be differentiated from cholinergic urticaria by the hot water immersion test. In this test, the person is immersed in water at 43 °C (109.4 °F). Someone with EU will not develop hives, while a person with cholinergic urticaria will develop the characteristic small hives, especially on the neck and chest.

The immediate symptoms of this type are treated with antihistamines, epinephrine and airway support. Taking antihistamines prior to exercise may be effective. Ketotifen is acknowledged to stabilise mast cells and prevent histamine release, and has been effective in treating this hives disorder. Avoiding exercise or foods that cause the mentioned symptoms is very important. In particular circumstances, tolerance can be brought on by regular exercise, but this must be under medical supervision.

==Pathophysiology==

The skin lesions of urticarial disease are caused by an inflammatory reaction in the skin, causing leakage of capillaries in the dermis, and resulting in an edema which persists until the interstitial fluid is absorbed into the surrounding cells.

Hives are caused by the release of histamine and other mediators of inflammation (cytokines) from cells in the skin. This process can be the result of an allergic or nonallergic reaction, differing in the eliciting mechanism of histamine release.

=== Allergic hives ===
Histamine and other proinflammatory substances are released from mast cells in the skin and tissues in response to the binding of allergen-bound IgE antibodies to high-affinity cell surface receptors. Basophils and other inflammatory cells are also seen to release histamine and other mediators, and are thought to play an important role, especially in chronic urticarial diseases.

=== Autoimmune hives ===

Over half of all cases of chronic idiopathic hives are the result of an autoimmune trigger. Roughly 50% of people with chronic urticaria spontaneously develop autoantibodies directed at the receptor FcεRI located on skin mast cells. Chronic stimulation of this receptor leads to chronic hives. People with hives often have other autoimmune conditions, such as autoimmune thyroiditis, celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus.

=== Infections ===
Hive-like rashes commonly accompany viral illnesses, such as the common cold. They usually appear three to five days after the cold has started, and may even appear a few days after the cold has resolved.

=== Nonallergic hives ===
Mechanisms other than allergen-antibody interactions are known to cause histamine release from mast cells. Many drugs, for example morphine, can induce direct histamine release not involving any immunoglobulin molecule. Also, a diverse group of signaling substances called neuropeptides, have been found to be involved in emotionally induced hives. Dominantly inherited cutaneous and neurocutaneous porphyrias (porphyria cutanea tarda, hereditary coproporphyria, variegate porphyria and erythropoietic protoporphyria) have been associated with solar urticaria. The occurrence of drug-induced solar urticaria may be associated with porphyrias. This may be caused by IgG binding, not IgE.

=== Dietary histamine poisoning ===
This is termed scombroid food poisoning. Ingestion of free histamine released by bacterial decay in fish flesh may result in a rapid-onset, allergic-type symptom complex which includes hives. However, the hives produced by scombroid is reported not to include wheals.

=== Stress and chronic idiopathic hives ===
Chronic idiopathic hives has been anecdotally linked to stress since the 1940s. A large body of evidence demonstrates an association between this condition and both poor emotional well-being and reduced health-related quality of life. A link between stress and this condition has also been shown. Some cases have been thought to be due to stress, including an association between post-traumatic stress and chronic idiopathic hives. In most cases of chronic idiopathic urticaria, no cause is identified.

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis is typically based on the appearance. The cause of chronic hives can rarely be determined. Patch testing may be useful to determine the allergy. In some cases regular extensive allergy testing over a long period of time is requested in hopes of getting new insight. No evidence shows regular allergy testing results in identification of a problem or relief for people with chronic hives. Regular allergy testing for people with chronic hives is not recommended.

===Acute versus chronic===
* urticaria is defined as the presence of evanescent wheals which completely resolve within six weeks. Acute urticaria becomes evident a few minutes after the person has been exposed to an allergen. The outbreak may last several weeks, but usually the hives are gone in six weeks. Typically, the hives are a reaction to food, but in about half the cases, the trigger is unknown. Common foods may be the cause, as well as bee or wasp stings, or skin contact with certain fragrances. Acute viral infection is another common cause of acute urticaria (viral exanthem). Less common causes of hives include friction, pressure, temperature extremes, exercise, and sunlight.
* urticaria is defined as the presence of hives which persist for greater than six weeks. Some of the more severe chronic cases have lasted more than 20 years. A survey indicated chronic urticaria lasted a year or more in more than 50% of those affected and 20 years or more in 20% of them. Provocative skin challenge testing may be done in those with chronic urticaria, in which the skin is exposed to pressure (dermatographisim), cold temperatures, warm temperatures, or light in an attempt to provoke symptoms and aid in the diagnosis. The history of physical examination guide the diagnosis of chronic urticaria, with extensive lab testing not recommended.

Acute and chronic hives are visually indistinguishable on visual inspection alone.

===Related conditions===

====Angioedema====
Angioedema is similar to hives, but in angioedema, the swelling occurs in a lower layer of the dermis than in hives, as well as in the subcutis. This swelling can occur around the mouth, eyes, in the throat, in the abdomen, or in other locations. Hives and angioedema sometimes occur together in response to an allergen, and is a concern in severe cases, as angioedema of the throat can be fatal.

====Vibratory angioedema====
This very rare form of angioedema develops in response to contact with vibration. In vibratory angioedema, symptoms develop within two to five minutes after contact with a vibrating object and abate after about an hour. People with this disorder do not experience dermographism or pressure urticaria. Vibratory angioedema is diagnosed by holding a vibrating device such as a laboratory vortex machine against the forearm for four minutes. Speedy swelling of the whole forearm extending into the upper arm is also noted later. The principal treatment is avoidance of vibratory stimulants. Antihistamines have also been proven helpful.

==Management==

The mainstay of therapy for both acute and chronic hives is education, avoiding triggers and using antihistamines.

Chronic hives can be difficult to treat and lead to significant disability. Unlike the acute form, 50–80% of people with chronic hives have no identifiable triggers. But 50% of people with chronic hives will experience remission within 1 year. Overall, treatment is geared towards symptomatic management. Individuals with chronic hives may need other medications in addition to antihistamines to control symptoms. People who experience hives with angioedema require emergency treatment as this is a life-threatening condition.

Treatment guidelines for the management of chronic hives have been published. According to the 2014 American practice parameters, treatment involves a stepwise approach. Step 1 consists of second generation, H1 receptor blocking antihistamines. Systemic glucocorticoids can also be used for episodes of severe disease but should not be used for long term due to their long list of side effects. Step 2 consists of increasing the dose of the current antihistamine, adding other antihistamines, or adding a leukotriene receptor antagonist such as montelukast. Step 3 consists of adding or replacing the current treatment with hydroxyzine or doxepin. If the individual doesn&#x27;t respond to steps 1–3 then they are considered to have refractory symptoms. At this point, anti-inflammatory medications (dapsone, sulfasalazine), immunosuppressants (cyclosporin, sirolimus) or other medications like omalizumab can be used. These options are explained in more detail below.

First generation antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine or hydroxyzine, are not recommended as a first line therapy as they block both brain and peripheral H1 receptors, causing sedation. Second-generation antihistamines, such as loratadine, cetirizine, fexofenadine or desloratadine, selectively antagonize peripheral H1 receptors, and are less sedating, less anticholinergic, and generally preferred over the first-generation antihistamines. Fexofenadine, a new-generation antihistamine that blocks histamine H1 receptors, may be less sedating than some second-generation antihistamines.

People who do not respond to the maximum dose of H1 antihistamines may benefit from increasing the dose further, then to switching to another non-sedating antihistamine, then to adding a leukotriene antagonist, then to using an older antihistamine, then to using systemic steroids and finally to using ciclosporin or omalizumab. Steroids are often associated with rebound hives once discontinued.

H2-receptor antagonists are sometimes used in addition to H1-antagonists to treat urticaria, but there is limited evidence for their efficacy.

===Systemic steroids===
Oral glucocorticoids are effective in controlling symptoms of chronic hives. However, they have an extensive list of adverse effects, such as adrenal suppression, weight gain, osteoporosis, hyperglycemia, etc. Therefore, their use should be limited to a couple of weeks. In addition, one study found that systemic glucocorticoids combined with antihistamines did not hasten the time to symptom control compared with antihistamines alone.

===Leukotriene-receptor antagonists===
Leukotrienes are released from mast cells along with histamine. The medications, montelukast and zafirlukast block leukotriene receptors and can be used as add on treatment or in isolation for people with CU. It is important to note that these medications may be more beneficial for people with NSAID induced CU.

===Other===
Other options for refractory symptoms of chronic hives include anti-inflammatory medications, omalizumab, and immunosuppressants.
Potential anti-inflammatory agents include dapsone, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine. Dapsone is a sulfone antimicrobial agent and is thought to suppress prostaglandin and leukotriene activity. It is helpful in therapy-refractory cases and is contraindicated in people with G6PD deficiency. Sulfasalazine, a 5-ASA derivative, is thought to alter adenosine release and inhibit IgE mediated mast cell degranulation, Sulfasalazine is a good option for people with anemia who cannot take dapsone. Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial agent that suppresses T lymphocytes. It has a low cost however it takes longer than dapsone or sulfasalazine to work.

Omalizumab was approved by the FDA in 2014 for people with hives 12 years old and above with chronic hives. It is a monoclonal antibody directed against IgE. Significant improvement in pruritus and quality of life was observed in a phase III, multicenter, randomized control trial.

Immunosuppressants used for CU include cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, and mycophenolate. Calcineurin inhibitors, such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus, inhibit cell responsiveness to mast cell products and inhibit T cell activity. They are preferred by some experts to treat severe symptoms. Sirolimus and mycophenolate have less evidence for their use in the treatment of chronic hives but reports have shown them to be efficacious. Immunosuppressants are generally reserved as the last line of therapy for severe cases due to their potential for serious adverse effects.

==Prognosis==
In those with chronic urticaria, defined as either continuous or intermittent symptoms lasting longer than 6 weeks, 35% of people are symptom free 1 year after treatment, while 29% have a reduction in their symptoms. Those with a longer disease duration typically have a worse prognosis, with greater symptom severity. Chronic urticaria is often accompanied by an intense pruritus, and other symptoms associated with a reduced quality of life and a high burden of co-morbid psychiatric conditions such as anxiety and depression. The prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and sleep disturbances in patients with chronic urticaria has been estimated to be 37%, 46%, and 53%, respectively.

==Epidemiology==
Chronic urticaria is usually seen in those older than 40 years, it is more common in women. The prevalence of chronic urticaria is 0.23% in the United States. Notable risk factors associated with an increased risk of chronic urticaria include allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and autoimmune thyroid disorders.

==Research==
Afamelanotide is being studied as a hives treatment.

Opioid antagonists such as naltrexone have tentative evidence to support their use.

==History==
The term &quot;urticaria&quot; was first used by the Scottish physician William Cullen in 1769. It originates from the Latin word &quot;urtica&quot;, meaning stinging hair or nettle, as the classical presentation follows the contact with a perennial flowering plant &quot;Urtica dioica&quot;. The history of urticaria dates back to 1000–2000 BC with its reference as a wind-type concealed rash in the book &quot;The Yellow Emperor&#x27;s Inner Classic&quot; from &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot;. Hippocrates in the 4th century first described urticaria as &quot;knidosis&quot; after the Greek word &quot;knido&quot; for nettle. The discovery of mast cells by Paul Ehrlich in 1879 brought urticaria and similar conditions under a comprehensive idea of allergic conditions.

<text>USS &quot;Carter Hall&quot; (LSD-3) was an in the United States Navy, named in honor of Carter Hall, the Millwood, Virginia estate of Lt. Col. Nathaniel Burwell (1750–1814).

&quot;Carter Hall&quot; was launched on 4 March 1943 by Moore Dry Dock Company, Oakland, California, sponsored by Mrs. T. Wilson; and commissioned on 18 September 1943.

==Operational history==
=== World War II ===

&quot;Carter Hall&quot; sailed from San Francisco 12 October 1943 with cargo and passengers for Brisbane, Australia. She arrived at her next port, Milne Bay, New Guinea, on 26 November to act as receiving ship, tender, and supply ship for small craft there and at Buna until 10 May 1944. During this period, she took part in the invasion landings at Cape Merkus, Arawe, New Britain on 15 December 1943, where valuable experience in the use of newly developed landing craft was gained. Upon the invasion of Aitape and Tanahmerah Bay late in April, &quot;Carter Hall&quot; once again launched laden landing craft, and stood by the invaded beaches to service small craft, remaining in the area until 2 May 1944.

&quot;Carter Hall&quot; arrived at Guadalcanal on 12 May 1944 for amphibious training, then sailed to Kwajalein to stand by in case she should be needed during the invasion of Saipan. Her services not required for that assault, she sailed on to Eniwetok and final preparations for the smashing return to Guam, where she arrived 21 July, the day of the initial assault. She remained off the island, supporting the operation through servicing small craft, until 26 July. The dock landing ship returned to Hollandia on 29 August, and from 11 September to 1 October supported the operations at Morotai.

&quot;Carter Hall&quot; sailed from Hollandia on 12 October 1944 with the Palo Attack Group of the Northern Attack Force, bound for the landings on Red Beach near Tacloban, San Pedro Bay, Philippines on 20 October. Working efficiently in the apparent chaos that concealed the intricate, smoothly meshed landing plans, &quot;Carter Hall&quot;&#x27;s men carried out their key role both in landing their craft and in caring for small craft through 24 October, when she made her retirement as the Battle of Leyte Gulf raged nearby. Her participation in the Leyte operation continued as she carried cargo from New Guinea on a series of runs until 17 November. From then until 30 December, she was stationed in San Pedro Bay as tender and supply ship for landing craft.

Overhauled at Oakland, California, between 31 January and 4 April 1945, &quot;Carter Hall&quot; returned to Subic Bay on 1 May to transport small craft, and to take part in the invasions at Brunei Bay, 10 to 16 June, and Balikpapan, 1 to 4 July. She remained at Leyte drydocking small craft until 6 September, when she sailed for Jinsen, Korea, carrying LCMs and picket boats for use in the occupation of Korea.

Occupation duty at Shanghai and Sasebo continued until 9 April 1946, when &quot;Carter Hall&quot; cleared for San Francisco. She was decommissioned and placed in reserve at San Diego 12 February 1947.

=== 1951–1956 ===

Recommissioned 26 January 1951 for duty in the Atlantic Fleet, &quot;Carter Hall&quot; arrived at her home port, Norfolk, Virginia, on 11 June 1951. Until 7 January 1955, she operated on training, salvage, and fleet exercises, as well as a tour with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean from January through May 1953. Prior to the Mediterranean cruise, she operated in support of construction of the Defensive Early Warning system off Hebron, Labradore and briefly visited Greenland, crossing the Arctic Circle at 1431, latitude 66&#x27;30&quot;N and in longitude 52&#x27;03&quot;W on 22 July 1952.

Returning to the Pacific Fleet, &quot;Carter Hall&quot; arrived at San Diego on 31 January 1955. Along with type training and fleet exercises, she had tours of duty in the western Pacific in 1955, 1958, 1959, and 1960, and took part in Arctic supply operations in summer 1956.

===Fate===
&quot;Carter Hall&quot; was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 31 October 1969 and sold to N. W. Kennedy, Vancouver, British Columbia, 28 August 1970, for scrapping.

<doc id="904959" wikidata="Q360135" url="?curid=904959" title="Kang Youwei">
<text>Kang Youwei (; Cantonese: &quot;Hōng Yáuh-wàih&quot;; 19March 185831March 1927) was a political thinker and reformer in China of the late Qing dynasty. His increasing closeness to and influence over the young Guangxu Emperor sparked conflict between the emperor and his adoptive mother, the regent Empress Dowager Cixi. His ideas were influential in the abortive Hundred Days&#x27; Reform. Following the coup by Cixi that ended the reform, Kang was forced to flee. He continued to advocate for a Chinese constitutional monarchy after the founding of the Republic of China.

==Early life==

Kang was born on 19March 1858 in Su Village, Danzao Town, Nanhai County, Guangdong province (now the Nanhai District of Foshan City). According to his autobiography, his intellectual gifts were recognized in his childhood by his uncle. As a result, from an early age, he was sent by his family to study the Confucian classics to pass the Chinese civil service exams. However, as a teenager, he was dissatisfied with the scholastic system of his time, especially its emphasis on preparing for the eight-legged essays, which were artificial literary exercises required as part of the examinations.

Studying for exams was an extraordinarily rigorous activity so he engaged in Buddhist meditation as a form of relaxation, an unusual leisurely activity for a Chinese scholar of his time. It was during one of these meditations that he had a mystical vision that became the theme for his intellectual pursuits throughout his life. Believing that it was possible to read every book and &quot;become a sage&quot;, he embarked on a quasi-messianic pursuit to save humanity.

==Biography==

Kang called for an end to property and the family in the interest of an idealized future cosmopolitan utopia and cited Confucius as an example of a reformer and not as a reactionary, as many of his contemporaries did. In his work &quot;A Study of Confucius as a Reformer of Institutions,&quot; he discussed the latter point in great detail. He argued, to bolster his claims, that the rediscovered versions of the Confucian classics were forged, as he treated in detail in &quot;A Study of the Forged Classics of the Xin Period&quot;.

In 1879, Kang traveled to Hong Kong and was shocked by the prosperity there, which started his interest in Western culture and thoughts. In 1882, Kang went to Beijing to take the imperial examination. When he was returning home, he stopped over in Shanghai and bought many Western books there, and started developing his ideology based on these writings. He was influenced by Protestant Christianity in his quest for reform.

In 1883, Kang founded the Anti-Footbinding Society near Canton.

Kang Youwei launched the Society for the Study of National Strengthening (Qiangxue hui) in Beijing. It is the first political group established by reformists in China. Through it, Kang became acquainted with Governor-General Zhang Zhidong and received his financial support to inaugurate the Paper of the Society for the Study of the National Strengthening (Qiangxue bao) in January 1896. In the same month, the society was dissolved and the paper had to cease publication.

Kang was a strong believer in constitutional monarchy and wanted to remodel the country after Meiji Japan. These ideas angered his colleagues in the scholarly class who regarded him as a heretic.

In 1895, China was defeated by Japan in the First Sino-Japanese War. In protest against the Treaty of Shimonoseki, Kang Youwei, Liang Qichao and over 600 civil examination candidates signed a petition to the Guangxu Emperor, known to history as Gongche Shangshu movement. This movement is taken as the sign of the appearance of reformists and the start of Chinese mass political movements.

Kang and his noted student, Liang Qichao, were important participants in a campaign to modernize China now known as the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform. The reforms introduced radical change into the Chinese government. Empress Dowager Cixi staged a coup that put an end to the reforms, put the Guangxu Emperor under house arrest, and ordered Kang&#x27;s arrest and execution on the basis that he had tried to have her assassinated. Kang fled the country, but also organized the Protect the Emperor Society which promoted the cause of the Guangxu Emperor, mainly in Chinese diaspora communities, and advocated the removal of Cixi. Kang relied on his principal American military advisor, General Homer Lea, to head the military branch of the Protect the Emperor Society. Kang traveled throughout the world to promote his ideas. He competed with the revolutionary leader Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s Revive China Society and Revolutionary Alliance for funds and followers among overseas Chinese.

Kang visited India twice, first in 1901–1903 and then again in October 1909, in part to study India, which he regarded as comparable to China. Although his information about Indian history was derived from English authors, he observed that India&#x27;s plight as a colonised country was due to the disunity among the different regions of India.

The Xinhai Revolution led to the abdication of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of a republic under Sun Yat-sen in 1912. Kang opposed the creation of a republic.

Some advocated that a Han be installed as Emperor: either the descendant of Confucius, who was the Duke Yansheng, – which Kang briefly endorsed before dropping the idea and returning to the idea of a Qing monarch – or the Ming dynasty Imperial family descendant, the Marquis of Extended Grace.

Kang remained an advocate of constitutional monarchy and launched a failed coup d&#x27;état in 1917. General Zhang Xun and his queue-wearing soldiers occupied Beijing, declaring a restoration of Emperor Puyi on July1.

The incident was a major miscalculation. The nation was highly anti-monarchist. Kang became suspicious of Zhang&#x27;s insincere constitutionalism and feared he was merely using the restoration to become the power behind the throne. He abandoned his mission and fled to the American legation. On July 12, Duan Qirui easily occupied the city.

Kang&#x27;s reputation serves as an important barometer for the political attitudes of his time. In the span of less than twenty years, he went from being regarded as an iconoclastic radical to an anachronistic pariah.

Chinese-British biographer Jung Chang gave Kang Youwei unfavorable criticism due to his role in spreading numerous vilifying stories about the Empress Dowager. Among those stories including accusation Cixi of murdering Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an, driving her own son to death, and massively appropriating naval funds. Chang asserted that Kang Youwei was a &quot;master propagandist&quot; who also harbored an intention to become an emperor by claiming as the reincarnation of Confucius, although he later abandoned that plan.

==&quot;Datong Shu&quot;==
Kang&#x27;s best-known and probably most controversial work is &quot;Datong Shu&quot; (大同書). The title of the book derives from the name of a utopian society imagined by Confucius, but it literally means &quot;The Book of Great Unity&quot;. The ideas of this book appeared in his lecture notes from 1884. Encouraged by his students, he worked on this book for the next two decades, but it was not until his exile in India that he finished the first draft. The first two chapters of the book were published in Japan in the 1900s, but the book was not published in its entirety until 1935, about seven years after his death.

Kang proposed a utopian future world free of political boundaries and democratically ruled by one central government. In his scheme, the world would be split into rectangular administrative districts, which would be self-governing under a direct democracy but loyal to a central world government. There would also be the dissolution of racial boundaries. Kang outlines an immensely ambitious, and equally inhumane, eugenics program that would eliminate the &quot;brown and black&quot; racial phenotype after a millennium and lead to the emergence of a fair-skinned homogeneous human race whose members would &quot;be the same color, the same appearance, the same size, and the same intelligence&quot;.
Some of the methods envisioned for achieving this end included forced relocation to colder regions inhabited by whites coupled with sterilization of those suffering from diseases or whose mental and/or physical attributes were deemed exceptionally grotesque. One of the more humane tactics involved giving distinctive honors to white and yellow people who were willing to “improve humanity&quot; by procreating with their brown and black counterparts. It is worth noting that although Kang felt that the white and yellow phenotype could coexist in his ideal scheme, he ultimately felt that white was nonetheless superior to yellow, and that the latter under ideal circumstances could be eliminated within the span of a century (prior to the advent of the &quot;Great Unity&quot;). 

His desire to end the traditional Chinese family structure defines him as an early advocate of women&#x27;s independence in China. 
He reasoned that the institution of the family practiced by society since the beginning of time was a great cause of strife. Kang hoped it would be effectively abolished.

The family would be replaced by state-run institutions, such as womb-teaching institutions, nurseries and schools. Marriage would be replaced by one-year contracts between a woman and a man. Kang considered the contemporary form of marriage, in which a woman was trapped for a lifetime, to be too oppressive. Kang believed in equality between men and women and that there should be no social barrier barring women from doing whatever men can do. 

Kang saw capitalism as an inherently evil system. He believed that government should establish socialist institutions to overlook the welfare of each individual. At one point, he even advocated that government should adopt the methods of &quot;communism&quot; although it is debated what Kang meant by this term.

In this spirit, in addition to establishing government nurseries and schools to replace the institution of the family, he also envisioned government-run retirement homes for the elderly. It is debated whether Kang&#x27;s socialist ideas were inspired more by Western thought or by traditional Confucian ideals.

Laurence G. Thompsom believes that his socialism was based on traditional Chinese ideals. His work is permeated with the Confucian ideal of &quot;ren&quot; (仁), or &quot;humanity&quot;. However, Thompson also noted a reference by Kang to Fourier. Thus, some Chinese scholars believe that Kang&#x27;s socialist ideals were influenced by Western intellectuals after his exile in 1898.

Notable in Kang&#x27;s &quot;Datong Shu&quot; were his enthusiasm for and his belief in bettering humanity through technology, unusual for a Confucian scholar during his time. He believed that Western technological progress had a central role in saving humanity. While many scholars of his time continued to maintain the belief that Western technology should be adopted only to defend China against the West, he seemed to whole-heartedly embrace the modern idea that technology is integral for advancing mankind. Before anything of modern scale had been built, he foresaw a global telegraphic and telephone network. He also believed that as a result of technological advances, each individual would only need to work three or four hours per day, a prediction that would be repeated by the most optimistic futurists later in the 20th century.

When the book was first published, it was received with mixed reactions. Kang&#x27;s support for the Guangxu Emperor was seen as reactionary by many Chinese intellectuals, who believed that Kang&#x27;s book was an elaborate joke and that he was merely acting as an apologist for the emperor as to how a utopian paradise could have developed if the Qing dynasty had been maintained. Others believe that Kang was a bold and daring protocommunist, who advocated modern Western socialism and communism. Amongst the latter was Mao Zedong, who admired Kang Youwei and his socialist ideals in the &quot;Datong Shu&quot;.

Modern Chinese scholars now often take the view that Kang was an important advocate of Chinese socialism. Despite the controversy, &quot;Datong Shu&quot; still remains popular. A Beijing publisher included it on the list of 100 most influential books in Chinese history.

==Philosophical views==

Kang enumerated sources of human suffering in a way similar to that of Buddhism.

The sufferings associated with man&#x27;s physical life are: being implanted in the womb, premature death, loss of a limb, being a barbarian, living outside China, being a slave, and being a woman. The sufferings associated with natural disasters are: famine resulting from flood or drought, epidemic, conflagration, flood, volcanic eruptions, collapse of buildings, shipwreck, and locust plagues. The sufferings associated with the human relationship are: being a widow, being orphaned or childless, being ill with no one to provide medical care, suffering poverty, and having a low and mean station in life. The sufferings associated with society are: corporal punishment and imprisonment, taxation, military conscription, social stratification, oppressive political institutions, the existence of the state, and the existence of the family. The human feelings which cause suffering are: stupidity, hatred, fatigue, lust, attachment to things, and desire. The things that cause suffering because of the esteem in which they are held are: wealth, eminent position, longevity, being a ruler, and being a spiritual leader. He also visualised a hierarchy of various religions, in which Christianity and Islam were considered the lowest, above them being Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. He predicted that the lower religions would eventually disappear in the future.

== Calligraphy ==

Kang Youwei was an accomplished calligrapher, responsible for the creation of Kang Typeface (Bad Model, Chinese: 破体). He commended tablet calligraphy and depreciated model calligraphy. In his early years, he learned from Ouyang Xun by imitation. In his work &quot;Guang&quot; &quot;yizhoushuangji&quot; (广艺舟双楫), he did comprehensive and systematic research and introduction about tablet calligraphy. In Kang’s later years, selling calligraphy became his most reliable source of income.

== Kang Youwei Island ==

After the failure of the Hundred Days’ Reform, Kang Youwei fled China. In 1898, he arrived in Japan via Hong Kong. Kang reached Sweden in 1904 and was deeply attracted to the landscape. He bought an islet off Saltsjöbaden and built a Chinese style garden and building named &quot;Beihai Caotang&quot; (Chinese: 北海草堂). This island is still known as Kang Youwei Island by many Chinese.

==Death==
Kang died at his home in the city of Qingdao, Shandong in 1927. He was 69.

<text>Fort Crawford was an outpost of the United States Army located in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, during the 19th century.

The army&#x27;s occupation of Prairie du Chien spanned the existence of two fortifications, both of them named Fort Crawford. The first of was occupied from 1816 to 1832, the second from 1832 to 1856. Both of the forts formed part of a string of fortifications along the upper Mississippi River that also included Fort Snelling near Saint Anthony Falls in Minnesota, and Fort Armstrong in Rock Island, Illinois. Fort Crawford was also associated with a string of forts built along the Fox-Wisconsin Waterway, which included Fort Winnebago in Portage, Wisconsin and Fort Howard in Green Bay, Wisconsin.

The site of the second fort has been preserved and holds the Fort Crawford Museum, located in the Second Fort Crawford Military Hospital. This is a 1930s reconstruction of the hospital serving the second fort. This building contains the only surviving building fragments of either fort, and it was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1960.

==First Fort Crawford==
The U.S. Army established a presence in Prairie du Chien during the War of 1812, when it built Fort Shelby on St. Feriole Island in the Mississippi River, which was part of the town separated by a marshy bayou. On July 19, 1814, Fort Shelby was captured by British forces and renamed Fort McKay. The British would continue to occupy Prairie du Chien until 1815, after the Treaty of Ghent restored the pre-war border between the United States and British Canada. When the British retreated from the city, they burned Fort McKay rather than give it back to the Americans.

To protect Prairie du Chien against future invasion, U.S. forces returned in June 1816, with orders to construct a new fort on the site of Fort McKay. This fort was named Fort Crawford in honor of William H. Crawford, the Secretary of War under James Madison. Built entirely of wood except for the magazine, the fort measured 343 ft on each side and included Blockhouses at its northwest and southeast corners. Construction of the fort lasted through the summer of 1816.

Following the completion of Fort Crawford, the garrison was engaged primarily in peacekeeping between the new white settlers arriving in the region and the region&#x27;s historic Native American tribes. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Leavenworth, a former U.S. Indian Agent, was among the early commanders at the fort. The United States conducted several negotiations with American Indians at Fort Crawford during the 1820s. One of the largest Indian councils in U.S. history was held at the fort in 1825, when over 5000 representatives of nearly a dozen Native American nations gathered to discuss and sign the first Treaty of Prairie du Chien.

Because of the first Fort Crawford&#x27;s location alongside the Mississippi River, diseases such as malaria and dysentery were common among the troops. They did not understand the role of mosquitoes and sanitation in these diseases. In addition, the fort&#x27;s wooden walls rotted because of seasonal flooding that took place nearly every spring. The post took meteorological observations in 1822. In 1826, after a major flood, the garrison at Fort Crawford was ordered to leave Prairie du Chien and reinforce Fort Snelling in Minnesota.

During 1827, while no troops remained in Prairie du Chien, a group of hostile Winnebago Indians led by chief Red Bird murdered a family of settlers near the abandoned fort. This incident was the start of the Winnebago War of 1827. The federal government ordered the return of soldiers to Prairie du Chien. Shortly afterward, the Army decided that the first Fort Crawford was no longer habitable. In 1828 a decision was made to build a new fort on higher ground. Maj. Stephen W. Kearny, commanding officer at the time, surveyed the area and chose a site for the new fort upon a hill near the Mississippi River&#x27;s eastern bank.

==Second Fort Crawford==

The construction of the second Fort Crawford began in 1829 under the direction of the new commander, Col. Zachary Taylor, later elected as President of the United States. The new fort&#x27;s location on the mainland in Prairie du Chien was much more floodproof. In addition, to make the fort more weather-proof, it was decided to construct the structure using quarried limestone rather than wood. Use of this material and delays in federal funding resulted in delays to complete the new fort; it was not finished until 1835. Troops in Prairie du Chien were unable to fully occupy the new fort&#x27;s barracks until 1832, and in the meantime remained at the first Fort Crawford.

Army surgeon Dr. William Beaumont did his best to keep the troops healthy. Beaumont would later achieve fame for a series of experiments on human digestion which he conducted at locations across the United States. Fifty-six of these experiments were conducted at Fort Crawford hospital, and allowed Beaumont to draw conclusions on the effects of temperature and emotion on the digestive process.

As the second fort&#x27;s barracks were being completed in 1832, the Black Hawk War broke out in Illinois, and the troops at Fort Crawford were called to defend pioneer settlements. After the Battle of Bad Axe near present-day Victory, Wisconsin, Chief Black Hawk surrendered to Col. Zachary Taylor at Fort Crawford. Black Hawk was imprisoned at the fort until he was escorted by Lt. Jefferson Davis to St. Louis, Missouri. Davis, who had been assigned to Fort Crawford in 1831, was later elected as President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War.

While assigned to Fort Crawford, Davis met and fell in love with Sarah Knox Taylor, the daughter of his commanding office Zachary Taylor. Colonel Taylor disapproved of the relationship between Davis and his daughter, as he felt the life of an Army officer was too hard on wives and families. In 1834 Davis was reassigned to Fort Gibson in Oklahoma. Shortly afterward, Davis resigned his commission in order to pursue his relationship with Sarah in Prairie du Chien. Upon discovering that Zachary Taylor still would not consent to their marriage, the couple eloped to Kentucky, where Davis married Sarah Taylor in 1835.
In 1835-1836 the garrison at Fort Crawford was assigned to build a road between Fort Crawford and Fort Winnebago in Portage. The route they chose for the road is now followed by U.S. Highway 18 eastward from Prairie du Chien towards Madison, Wisconsin over Military Ridge, which is so named because of the military road which followed its crest. After the road was completed and the Ho-Chunk people were relocated from Wisconsin to Minnesota, the fort had little use. It was abandoned in 1849. In 1855 Fort Crawford was reoccupied when rumors circulated of an impending uprising among the remaining Native Americans, but no such event occurred. Troops left the fort for the last time on June 9, 1856.

During the American Civil War, the fort housed part of the Swift United States Army General Hospital.

==Fort Crawford Museum==

Except during the American Civil War, when the fort was used as both a recruitment center and hospital for Union soldiers, Fort Crawford was left unoccupied between 1856 and 1933. In 1933, the Daughters of the American Revolution began work on reconstructing a portion of the fort&#x27;s hospital, while clearing away the remaining parts of the dilapidated fort to allow for other development.

In the 1960s, the reconstructed fort hospital was transformed into a museum of medical history called the Fort Crawford Museum of Medical Progress. The museum featured exhibits on the experiments by Dr. Beaumont and other medical innovations. It was operated by the Wisconsin Medical Society until 1995. In 1996, the museum was donated to the Prairie du Chien Historical Society. It was converted into a museum of local history, called the Prairie du Chien Museum at Fort Crawford. While the fort&#x27;s hospital, which is registered as a National Historic Landmark, still houses exhibits related to Dr. Beaumont and medical history, adjacent buildings are now filled with exhibits on other aspects of Prairie du Chien history.

<doc id="904984" wikidata="Q76626" url="?curid=904984" title="Sap">
<text>Sap is a fluid transported in the xylem cells (vessel elements or tracheids) or phloem sieve tube elements of a plant. These cells transport water and nutrients throughout the plant.

Sap is distinct from latex, resin, or cell sap; it is a separate substance, separately produced, and with different components and functions.

Insect honeydew is called sap, particularly when it falls from trees, but is only the remains of eaten sap and other plant parts.

== Types of sap ==
Saps may be broadly divided into two types: xylem sap and phloem sap.

===Xylem sap===
Xylem sap (pronounced ) consists primarily of a watery solution of hormones, mineral elements and other nutrients. Transport of sap in xylem is characterized by movement from the roots toward the leaves.

Over the past century, there has been some controversy regarding the mechanism of xylem sap transport; today, most plant scientists agree that the cohesion-tension theory best explains this process, but multiforce theories that hypothesize several alternative mechanisms have been suggested, including longitudinal cellular and xylem osmotic pressure gradients, axial potential gradients in the vessels, and gel- and gas-bubble-supported interfacial gradients.

Xylem sap transport can be disrupted by cavitation—an &quot;abrupt phase change [of water] from liquid to vapor&quot;—resulting in air-filled xylem conduits. In addition to being a fundamental physical limit on tree height, two environmental stresses can disrupt xylem transport by cavitation: increasingly negative xylem pressures associated with water stress, and freeze-thaw cycles in temperate climates.

===Phloem sap===
Phloem sap (pronounced ) consists primarily of sugars, hormones, and mineral elements dissolved in water. It flows from where carbohydrates are produced or stored (sugar source) to where they are used (sugar sinks). The pressure flow hypothesis proposes a mechanism for phloem sap transport, although other hypotheses have been proposed. Phloem sap is thought to play a role in sending informational signals throughout vascular plants. According to &quot;Annual Review of Plant Biology&quot;,
Many insects of the order Hemiptera (the half-wings), feed directly on phloem sap, and make it the primary component of their diet. Phloem sap is &quot;nutrient-rich compared with many other plant products and generally lacking in toxins and feeding deterrents, [yet] it is consumed as the dominant or sole diet by a very restricted range of animals&quot;. This apparent paradox is explained by the fact that phloem sap is physiologically extreme in terms of animal digestion, and it is hypothesized that few animals take direct advantage of this because they lack two adaptations that are necessary to enable direct use by animals. These include the existence of a very high ratio of non-essential/essential amino acids in phloem sap for which these adapted Hemiptera insects contain symbiotic microorganisms which can then provide them with essential amino acids; and also insect &quot;tolerance of the very high sugar content and osmotic pressure of phloem sap is promoted by their possession in the gut of sucrase- activity, which transforms excess ingested sugar into long-chain oligosaccharides.&quot;
A much larger set of animals do however consume phloem sap by proxy, either &quot;through feeding on the honeydew of phloem-feeding hemipterans. Honeydew is physiologically less extreme than phloem sap, with a higher essential/non-essential amino acid ratio and lower osmotic pressure,&quot; or by feeding on the biomass of insects that have grown on more direct ingestion of phloem sap.

==Human uses==
Maple syrup is made from reduced sugar maple xylem sap. The sap often is harvested from the sugar maple, &quot;Acer saccharum&quot;.

In some countries (e.g., Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, Belarus, Russia) harvesting the early spring sap of birch trees (so called &quot;birch juice&quot;) for human consumption is common practice; the sap can be used fresh or fermented and contains xylitol.

Certain palm tree sap can be used to make palm syrup. In the Canary Islands they use the Canary Island date palm while in Chile they use the Chilean wine palm to make their syrup called &quot;miel de palma&quot;.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Latin Recording was conceived and lobbied for by then NYC NARAS Chapter Board Member, salsa pianist, composer, arranger, and bandleader, Larry Harlow. Through his gathering of 100,000 signatures and protesting in front of the Uris Theater in Manhattan it finally became a reality. It was presented from 1976 to 1983 and primarily encompassed progressive salsa and Latin-oriented jazz recordings. Starting from 1984 the Latin field was expanded to Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album, Best Tropical Performance (encompassing salsa and merengue), and Best Mexican/Mexican American Performance. Its first winner was Eddie Palmieri for the album, Sun of Latin Music.

Years reflect the year in which the Grammy Awards were presented, for works released in the previous year.

<doc id="904988" wikidata="Q5508805" url="?curid=904988" title="Functional constipation">
<text>Functional constipation, also known as chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC), is defined by less than three bowel movements per week, hard stools, severe straining, the sensation of anorectal blockage, the feeling of incomplete evacuation, and the need for manual maneuvers during feces, without organic abnormalities. Many illnesses, including endocrine, metabolic, neurological, mental, and gastrointestinal obstructions, can cause constipation as a secondary symptom. When there is no such cause, functional constipation is diagnosed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sex/Gender-Specific&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Functional constipation requires symptoms to be present at least a fourth of the time. Causes include anismus, descending perineum syndrome, inability to control the external anal sphincter, poor diet, unwillingness to defecate, nervous reactions, and deep psychosomatic disorders. Comorbid symptoms such as headache may also be present, especially in children.

Functional constipation is diagnosed using the Rome criteria, a consensus of experts. The criteria include over 25% of defecations involving straining, 25% resulting in lumpy or hard stools, 25% requiring partial evacuation, 25% experiencing anorectal blockage or obstruction, and 25% using manual techniques. Less than three weekly spontaneous bowel movements are also considered. A thorough history and physical examination, including a digital rectal exam, is crucial for diagnosing constipation. Additional laboratory testing is typically used in cases of uncertainty or to rule out underlying medical conditions.

Functional constipation is a condition that requires nonpharmacological management, including education and lifestyle modifications. It begins with dietary guidelines, focusing on regular fiber and fluid intake. Children with functional constipation should consume a normal intake of fiber, as per ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN criteria. Parents and children should receive counseling about overflow incontinence and withholding behavior. An organized toilet-training program with a reward system can help reduce faecal impaction.

Pharmacological treatment for children with functional constipation consists of maintenance therapy and faecal disimpaction. High-dose oral polyethylene glycol (PEG) or enemas containing active substances can induce fecal disimpaction, while maintenance therapy is recommended after successful disimpaction to avoid reoccurring stool buildup. Glycerine or bisacodyl suppositories are also used for both adults and children. Maintenance treatment for functional constipation includes osmotic laxatives, milk of magnesia, and mineral oil. Stimulant laxatives such as senna or bisacodyl are recommended for those with persistent symptoms.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Individuals suffering from functional constipation often exhibit hard or lumpy stools, decreased frequency of bowel movements, a feeling of incomplete evacuation or obstruction, straining, and in some cases, stomach pain and bloating. Generally speaking, symptoms are considered chronic if they have persisted for three months or more.

Faecal incontinence, which is the involuntary loss of stools in the underwear during toilet training and is brought on by an overflow of soft stools passing around a solid faecal mass in the rectum (faecal impaction), is a common symptom in children. Urinary symptoms, including urine incontinence and urinary tract infections, are frequently observed in children who suffer from functional constipation.

== Causes ==
To be considered functional constipation, symptoms must be present at least a fourth of the time. Possible causes are:
* Anismus
* Descending perineum syndrome
* Other inability or unwillingness to control the external anal sphincter, which normally is under voluntary control
* A poor diet
* An unwillingness to defecate
* Nervous reactions, including prolonged and/or chronic stress and anxiety, that close the internal anal sphincter, a muscle that is not under voluntary control
* Deeper psychosomatic disorders which sometimes affect digestion and the absorption of water in the colon
There is also possibility of presentation with other comorbid symptoms such as headache, especially in children.

== Diagnosis ==
Functional constipation cannot be diagnosed with particular testing; instead, the Rome criteria, a consensus of experts, is used to make this diagnosis. The Rome IV criteria define functional constipation as meeting at least two of the six requirements given below:

# Over ¼ (25%) of defecations involve straining.
# More than ¼ (25%) of defecations result in lumpy or hard stools (Bristol Stool Form Scale 1-2).
# Sensation of partial evacuation for over ¼ (25%) of the defecations.
# Sensation of anorectal blockage or obstruction during more than ¼ (25%) of bowel movements.
# Manual techniques (such as pelvic floor support and digital evacuation) to assist in more than ¼ (25%) of defecations.
# Less than three weekly spontaneous bowel movements.
# Loose stools are rarely seen without the use of laxatives.
# Not enough criteria met to diagnose irritable bowel syndrome.

A thorough history and physical examination should be performed while evaluating constipation. Along with push and squeeze maneuvers, a comprehensive digital rectal exam (DRE) is a crucial component of the clinical examination.

Generally speaking, additional laboratory testing should be carried out only in cases of uncertainty or to rule out underlying medical conditions such as hypothyroidism or celiac disease. Abdominal radiography, with or without the introduction of radio-opaque markers to determine colonic transit time, and abdominal ultrasonography are frequently employed supplementary tests in the diagnosis of constipation.

Chronic idiopathic constipation is similar to constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C); however, people with CIC do not have other symptoms of IBS, such as abdominal pain.

== Treatment ==
Treatment for functional constipation begins with nonpharmacological management. This includes education and lifestyle modifications, such as diet changes, consistent exercise, and guidance on proper body position and behavior when using the restroom.

The first treatments for constipation are dietary guidelines, which include the requirement for a regular consumption of fiber and fluids. A normal intake of fiber is advocated for children with functional constipation, as per the criteria of ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN. It is not recommended to increase the consumption of fiber above what is considered normal.

In order to effectively treat childhood constipation, it is imperative that parents and children receive counseling. This includes teaching them about the concept of overflow incontinence and the significance of withholding behavior. One way to reduce faecal impaction and lower the risk of faecal incontinence is to use an organized toilet-training program with a reward system that instructs the kid to try to defaecate at least twice or three times a day (after each meal).

Children with functional constipation can be treated pharmacologically in two stages: maintenance therapy and faecal disimpaction. High-dose oral polyethylene glycol (PEG) or enemas containing active substances such sodium phosphate, sodium lauryl sulfoacetate, or sodium docusate can be used to induce fecal disimpaction. Maintenance therapy is suggested following successful disimpaction in order to avoid reoccurring stool buildup. Adults rarely need faecal disimpaction, although the methods are comparable, and substantial doses of PEG or magnesium citrate are popular oral therapies. For both adults and children, glycerine or bisacodyl suppositories provide an alternative to enemas.

The first-choice maintenance treatment advised for functional constipation is osmotic laxatives. Other often used laxatives include milk of magnesia (magnesium hydroxide) and mineral oil, a lubricant. Clinical recommendations advocate using stimulant laxatives, such as senna or bisacodyl, in both adults and children if symptoms are still present.

A number of novel therapeutic treatments have been suggested and licensed in recent years for the treatment of functional constipation. Prosecretory drugs including plecanatide, linaclotide, and lubiprostone alter gut epithelial channels, encouraging intestinal fluid secretion and increasing stool volume, which improves GI transit. Functional constipation has been treated with a variety of 5-hydroxytryptamine 4 (5-HT4) agonists. Serotonin (5-HT) is an enteric and central neurotransmitter that binds to the gut&#x27;s 5-HT4 receptors to boost acetylcholine release, which in turn increases secretion and motility of the gut. Additionally, serotonin promotes motility by stimulating the mucosa&#x27;s afferent neurons, which in turn triggers the gastrocolic reflex.

== Research ==
A 2014 meta-analysis of three small trials evaluating probiotics showed a slight improvement in management of chronic idiopathic constipation, but well-designed studies are necessary to know the true efficacy of probiotics in treating this condition.

Children with functional constipation often claim to lack the sensation of the urge to defecate, and may be conditioned to avoid doing so due to a previous painful experience. One retrospective study showed that these children did indeed have the urge to defecate using colonic manometry, and suggested behavioral modification as a treatment for functional constipation.

<text>Webs, formerly Freewebs, was a freemium, primarily static site-only web host founded in 2001. The service offered free and premium website hosting plans, and their own templated website building service. Unusually, Webs does not offer any dynamic content support aside from their own dynamic &quot;apps&quot;, despite offering FTP access and allowing HTML uploads.

==History==
Webs began in 2001 as Freewebs just after the dot-com bubble. It was a start-up launched by brothers Haroon and Zeki Mokhtarzada during their last year at the University of Maryland, College Park with the help of their younger brother Idris. Their goal was to enable anyone in the world to express themselves through the creation of their own website. Between 2003 and 2007, the company grew 1704%.

By April 2007, the site recorded 18 million unique visitors a month.

On November 14, 2008, Freewebs changed its name to Webs, but users&#x27; URLs remained in the freewebs.com domain unless they chose to change over. Now, new websites are given subdomains of webs.com, but the old freewebs.com/&quot;sitename&quot; format still works, even for new websites. Users can also upgrade to a premium package and receive a custom web address without a Webs subdomain.

On December 28, 2011, the online printing service Vistaprint completed its acquisition of Webs for $117.5 million.

On June 4, 2012, Webs released a new version of their Sitebuilder product, called Sitebuilder3. The new version includes a new drag and drop interface, more customizable themes, and simple social media integration.

In early 2013, Webs underwent a redesign of the internal site, which overhauled the user’s building experience. It involved the removal of ads, the modernization of the user interface, and the addition of a step-by-step “successful website” checklist.

On May 3, 2013, Webs introduced a SEO Booster, a search engine optimization tool that helps users identify the best keyword phrases to build into their website in order to improve its position in search engine results.

In late 2020, the parent company, Vistaprint, announced that on March 31, 2021 all the paying websites hosted by webs.com will be migrated to the Vistaprint domain and all the free websites deleted, with their owners&#x27; accounts removed. This change was postponed to June 30, 2021. The last free subdomains were finally shut down on August 31, 2023, with all existing domains transferred to ExactHosting.com.

==Product==
Webs offered a &quot;drag-and-drop&quot; interface and professional-looking themes for users creating a new website. For pro-level websites, there were additional e-commerce features. including unlimited &quot;webstore&quot; items, and Google and Facebook advertising credits. All users could also link their websites to social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook.

Webs offered its own themes and site builder, as well as a selection of its own dynamic &quot;apps&quot; such as a blog, photo gallery, or webstore.

Free websites were limited in features and also had a Webs banner on the bottom of the screen. The company offered premium plans with more tools and features and also allowed customers to buy custom domain names.

Webs offered 80% uptime guarantee, after many customers had complained about excessive downtime.

<doc id="905003" wikidata="Q6800632" url="?curid=905003" title="McCoy Air Force Base">
<text>McCoy AFB (1940–1947, 1951–1975) is a former U.S. Air Force installation located 10 miles (16 km) southeast of Orlando, Florida. It was a training base during World War II. From 1951 to 1975, it was a frontline Strategic Air Command (SAC) base during the Cold War and Vietnam War. It was Orlando&#x27;s biggest employer and economic backbone prior to the opening of Walt Disney World in 1971.

With McCoy&#x27;s closure as an active USAF facility in 1975, the site was redeveloped and is known today as Orlando International Airport, which continues to carry the base&#x27;s original FAA LID airport code of MCO (i.e., McCoy) and ICAO airport code of KMCO.

Over the course of its existence the installation had several names, including Orlando Army Air Field #2, Pinecastle Army Airfield, and Pinecastle Air Force Base.

== History ==
McCoy Air Force Base was named for Colonel Michael Norman Wright McCoy (1905–1957) on 7 May 1958. Seven months earlier on 9 October 1957, McCoy was killed in the crash of a B-47 Stratojet (DB-47B-35-BW), AF Serial No. &quot;51-2177&quot;, of the 447th Bombardment Squadron, 321st Bombardment Wing. The six-engine bomber suffered wing failure northwest of downtown Orlando while taking part in a practice demonstration during the annual Strategic Air Command Bombing Navigation and Reconnaissance Competition at Pinecastle Air Force Base. McCoy was the aircraft commander during the flight and the mishap aircraft was one of two at Pinecastle that had been modified to carry the GAM-63 RASCAL air-to-surface missile.

At the time of his death, McCoy was the commander of the 321st Bombardment Wing, the host wing of Pinecastle AFB. A hugely popular figure in Central Florida, he was buried at Arlington National Cemetery in a funeral that included a flyover of multiple B-47s.

=== World War II ===

The facility originally was built in 1940 as a replacement civilian airport after the takeover and conversion of the Orlando Municipal Airport (present day Orlando Executive Airport) to Orlando Army Air Base by the United States Army Air Corps. However, with the expansion of Orlando AAB following establishment of the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics (AAFSAT) in 1942, the new civilian airport was also leased by the now-renamed U.S. Army Air Forces, initially being designated as Orlando Army Air Field #2 and becoming a sub-base of Orlando AAB. On 1 January 1943, it was renamed as Pinecastle Army Airfield.

Pinecastle AAF was aimed to support the training mission of Orlando AAB. Two bomb squadrons of the 9th Bombardment Group at Orlando AAB, the 5th, equipped with B-24 Liberators and the 99th, with B-25 Mitchells, B-26 Marauders and B-17 Flying Fortresses, operated from Pinecastle during the war. The squadrons had the mission of training future combat aircrews for a wide variety of bombing missions in advanced combat techniques.

In addition to the training mission, beginning in 1943, Pinecastle AAF was used as the AAFSAT Technical Center, operating an Air Force General Maintenance and Supply Depot facility. On 1 June 1944, the 901st Army Air Forces Base Unit (Heavy Bombardment), took over the bomber training mission with two squadrons, &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot;.

Records indicate that aircraft from Pinecastle AAF performed test bombing of chemical munitions at one of Pinecastle&#x27;s numerous bombing and gunnery ranges. It is uncertain whether the chemical warfare materials used in these tests were stored at Pinecastle Army Airfield or transported from the Orlando Toxic Gas and Decontamination Yard at Orlando AAB a few hours before a practice bombing run.

With the drawdown and closure of wartime airfields after the German capitulation in May 1945, units from other bases in Florida were consolidated at Pinecastle AAF. On 1 July 1945, jurisdiction of the field was transferred to Air Proving Ground Command at Eglin Field, Florida. The 901st AAFBU was inactivated and replaced by the 621st Base Unit.

===Postwar years===
In August 1945, under the Proving Ground Command (PGC), the base was used for testing of the B-32 Dominator bomber, although operations in 1945 at the field were severely curtailed due to personnel shortages caused by post-war demobilization. Weapons tests of the VB-6 Felix infrared heat seeking and VB-3 Razon radio-controlled gliding bombs were also carried out.

Beginning in January 1946, Bell Aircraft Corporation&#x27;s chief test pilot Jack Woolams tested the X-1 supersonic aircraft, originally designated the XS-1, at the airfield because of the area&#x27;s then-remote location and 10,000-foot runway.

In March 1946, the X-1 program was relocated to Muroc Army Air Field, California. The move was a logistics issue as much as anything, as Pinecastle was deemed not suitable for the X-1 project. A move to the remote California desert ensured the X-1 project team could maintain secrecy, an important issue considering the project was highly classified at the time. In addition, Muroc had an expansive landing area, thanks to the surrounding dry lakebeds, and better visibility. The X-1&#x27;s high sink rate and the problems of keeping the plane in sight amid Florida&#x27;s frequent clouds also added two more votes in favor of the Army Air Force&#x27;s decision to go to Muroc.

This aircraft, later flown by then-Captain (Brigadier General, USAF, Retired) Chuck Yeager, would be the first aircraft in history to successfully exceed the speed of sound in level flight. With the X-1 project transferred, Pinecastle AAF was closed and the entire site was transferred to the City of Orlando in 1947 with a reversal clause for future military use if deemed to be necessary for national defense purposes.

===Cold War===

====Air Training Command====
As a result of the outbreak of the Korean War, the United States Air Force&#x27;s Air Training Command (ATC) reacquired and reactivated the facility, renaming it Pinecastle Air Force Base on 1 September 1951. ATC immediately began a $100 million military construction (MILCON) program at the World War II facility, to include lengthening the existing north–south runway and constructing a parallel north–south runway, both over 12,000 feet in length. Actual flight training operations, however, did not begin until early 1952.

The 3540th Flying Training Wing (later redesignated the 4240th Flying Training Wing) was activated at the base for the purpose of training personnel in Strategic Air Command&#x27;s (SAC) new Boeing B-47 Stratojet medium jet bomber. Eighty-four B-47s were allocated for the training, and SAC transferred thirty experienced aircraft commanders to Pinecastle to serve as instructors. According to the basic plan, ATC would train forty-nine crews by the end of 1952. But from the beginning, mechanical problems with the B-47 and a lack of equipment prevented training. In addition, the base was inadequate at the time with regards to training facilities. The first B-47 class arrived at the base on 6 November 1952 and the first B-47 crew training program started a few weeks later when Class 53-6A entered combat crew training on 22 December 1952. The first trained B-47 crews graduated from training during the first half of 1953.

On 1 January 1954, ATC transferred both the B-47 crew training mission at Pinecastle AFB and jurisdiction of the base to the Strategic Air Command.

==== 321st Bombardment Wing and 19th Bombardment Wing====

On 15 December 1953, the 321st Bombardment Wing (Medium) was activated at Pinecastle AFB, absorbing all B-47 bombers and KC-97 tankers at the base. The B-47 combat crew training mission was also transferred from ATC to SAC. Colonel Michael N.W. McCoy, previously commander of the 306th Bombardment Wing at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, was appointed commander of the 321st Bombardment Wing on 24 May 1954, having earned the unofficial distinction of being the &quot;dean&quot; of the Strategic Air Command&#x27;s B-47 Stratojet aircraft commanders.

In July 1954, the 19th Bombardment Wing joined the 321st at Pinecastle AFB and the two units came under the control of the 813th Strategic Aerospace Division. The 813th was subsequently inactivated in the summer of 1956 when the 19th Bomb Wing moved to Homestead Air Force Base, Florida.

In November 1957, the base was host to the medium and heavy bombers participating in the annual Strategic Air Command Bombing Navigation and Reconnaissance Competition. During the competition, a B-47 aircraft mishap north of downtown Orlando took the lives of Colonel McCoy, Group Captain John Woodroffe of the Royal Air Force, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Joyce, and Major Vernon Stuff during preparations for the event. Despite this tragedy, the 321st Bomb Wing, under the direction of its new commander, Colonel Robert W. Strong, Jr., won the top honors of the meet, including the coveted Fairchild and McKay trophies, distinguishing the 321st as the top B-47 Wing in SAC.

====76th Fighter Interceptor Squadron====
Another distinguished unit assigned to Pinecastle AFB in November 1957 was the Air Defense Command&#x27;s 76th Fighter Interceptor Squadron (76 FIS). A descendant of the famous World War II &quot;Flying Tigers,&quot; the 76 FIS was commanded by Major Morris F. Wilson and flew the F-89H &quot;Scorpion&quot; all-weather fighter-interceptor. One of the last squadrons to fly the Scorpion, the 76 FIS was transferred from McCoy to Westover AFB, Massachusetts on 1 February 1961.

====McCoy AFB====
On 7 May 1958, Pinecastle AFB was renamed McCoy Air Force Base in memory of the late Colonel Michael N. W. McCoy. Formal dedication ceremonies were held on 21 May 1958 in conjunction with a mammoth base open house, during which an estimated 30,000 Floridians attended.

In the summer of 1961, a complete reorganization of the base began in order to convert the base from the B-47 Stratojet medium jet bomber to the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress heavy bomber. As part of this program, the 321st Bomb Wing began phasing out its operations in June 1961 and was inactivated in October 1961.

==== 4047th Strategic Wing ====

On 1 July 1961, the 321st was replaced by the 4047th Strategic Wing (Heavy), which was designated and organized under its first commander, Col Francis S. Holmes, Jr. The 4047th was part of SAC&#x27;s &quot;Strategic Wing&quot; concept, which was to disperse its medium and heavy bombers and tanker aircraft over a larger number of bases, thus making it more difficult for the Soviet Union to knock out the entire fleet with a surprise first strike. All of the Strategic Wings had one squadron of B-52s, containing 15 aircraft, and most also had a squadron of fifteen KC-135 tanker aircraft. Half of the bombers and tankers were maintained on fifteen-minute alert, fully fueled, armed, and ready for combat, while the remainder were used for training in bombardment missions and air refueling operations.

In August 1961, the first B-52D Stratofortresses were assigned to the new wing, and on 1 September 1961 the 347th Bombardment Squadron was reassigned from Westover AFB, Massachusetts to McCoy AFB as the wing&#x27;s operational flying squadron for the heavy bombers. On 15 September, the 321st Combat Support Group was also organized and on that same date Colonel William G. Walker, Jr., assumed command of the 4047th Strategic Wing.

==== 966th Airborne Early Warning and Control Squadron ====
The 966th Airborne Early Warning &amp; Control Squadron was activated on 18 December 1961 and was organized two months later at McCoy AFB as a geographically separated unit (GSU) of the 551st Airborne Early Warning and Control Wing at Otis AFB, Massachusetts. While at McCoy, the squadron flew the propeller-driven EC-121 Warning Star radar surveillance aircraft in its EC-121D and EC-121Q variants. The squadron changed its parent wing on 1 May 1963, coming under the 552nd Airborne Early Warning and Control Wing, headquartered at McClellan AFB, California. The mission of the 966th Airborne Early Warning and Control Squadron covered a broad spectrum of responsibilities. As an Air Defense Command,(later Aerospace Defense Command) (ADC) unit, the 966th also supported Strategic Air Command and Tactical Air Command (TAC) operations, assisted U.S. Navy P-2 Neptune and P-3 Orion aircraft in anti-submarine and maritime surveillance patrols, and developed weather information. It also furnished airborne radar surveillance and technical control in support of global air defense and Joint Chiefs of Staff contingency operations. 966th aircrews also frequently deployed to distant operational locations including Southeast Asia. The squadron was inactivated on 31 December 1969, although detachments from other EC-121 squadrons would continue to operate at McCoy AFB throughout the early 1970s.

====Joint Civil-Military Use: McCoy AFB and the Orlando-McCoy Jetport====
In the early 1960s, the then-Orlando Herndon Airport began to start providing commercial jet service. However, its World War II era 6,000-foot runways were dangerously short to handle the new Boeing 707, Convair 880 and Douglas DC-8 commercial passenger jets. In addition, the air terminal built in 1951 was inadequate to accommodate the increasing number of passengers. McCoy Air Force Base, with its two 12,000-foot runways, was more than capable of safely accommodating the passenger jets.

In 1962 an agreement was worked out between the Air Force and the City of Orlando for the joint-use of one of the runways (18L/36R) for airline operations, and the purchase of two former AGM-28 Hound Dog missile storage hangars in the northeast corner of the installation by the city for conversion into a passenger air terminal for use by Delta, Eastern, and National Airlines. The Orlando-McCoy Jetport opened in 1964, with Delta Air Lines being the first airline to offer jet passenger service to the new Orlando-McCoy Jetport with Delta&#x27;s DC-8 &quot;Fanjet&quot; aircraft. By 1968, all airline operations had moved from Herndon Airport to the new Orlando-McCoy Jetport.

With the opening of Walt Disney World in 1971, the amount of air traffic increased substantially, especially with Boeing 727, Boeing 737 and Douglas DC-9 aircraft. As a result, the agreement with the Air Force was amended to allow for an expansion of the civil airport facilities. Additional acreage was provided to Orlando east of the airfield in 1972 and two modern airport terminals were constructed between 1978 and 1981, along with improved parking and other infrastructure. With the improved civil airport at McCoy, the new wide-body Boeing 747, Douglas DC-10, and Lockheed L-1011 TriStar airliners began scheduled service.

==== Cuban Missile Crisis ====
On 14 October 1962, a Lockheed U-2 from the 4080th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing at Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas piloted by Major Richard S. Heyser, USAF, launched from Edwards AFB, California for a high altitude reconnaissance flight over Cuba. Arriving over the island an hour after sunrise, Heyser photographed the Soviet military installing nuclear armed SS-4 medium range and SS-5 intermediate range ballistic missiles in Cuba, thereby precipitating the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Heyser concluded this flight at McCoy AFB and the 4080th subsequently established a U-2 operating location at McCoy AFB, launching and recovering numerous flights over Cuba for the duration of the crisis. On 21 October, Attorney General of the United States Robert F. Kennedy; United States Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara; Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Maxwell Taylor, USA; and General Walter C. Sweeney, Jr., USAF met with President John F. Kennedy concerning a military contingency plan regarding this development. The 4080th&#x27;s operating location at McCoy AFB, designated OL-X, operated two U-2 aircraft and flew at least 82 missions over Cuba from McCoy AFB from 22 October – 6 December 1962.

General Sweeney, as Commander of Tactical Air Command (TAC), proposed an operational plan which first called for an air attack on the surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites in the vicinity of known medium range (MRBM) and intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) launchers by eight fighter-bombers per SAM site. Concurrently, each of the Cuban MiG airfields thought to be protecting MRBM/IRBM sites were to be struck by at least twelve fighters. Following the air strikes on SAM sites and MiG fighter airfields, each MRBM and IRBM launch site was to be attacked by at least twelve aircraft. General Sweeney&#x27;s plan was accepted and, additionally, Cuban Ilyushin Il-28 &quot;Beagle&quot; medium bomber airfields were added to the target list.

To support this plan, the USAF deployed the following TAC units to McCoy AFB while simultaneously dispersing the 4047th Strategic Wing&#x27;s B-52 and KC-135 aircraft:
* 4th Tactical Fighter Wing: 67 F-105Bs(Deployed from Seymour Johnson AFB, North Carolina)
* 354th Tactical Fighter Wing: 63 F-100D/Fs(Deployed from Myrtle Beach AFB, South Carolina)
* 427th Air Refueling Squadron: 20 KB-50Js(Deployed from Langley AFB, Virginia)
On the morning of 27 October, a U-2 piloted by Major Rudolf Anderson, Jr., USAF, departed McCoy AFB on yet another Cuban overflight mission. A few hours into his mission, Anderson&#x27;s aircraft was engaged by a Soviet-manned SA-2 &quot;Guideline&quot; surface-to-air missile site in the vicinity of Banes, Cuba. Hit by two of three SA-2 missiles fired, the aircraft was shot down over Cuba, killing Major Anderson.

A week following the shoot down, Major Anderson&#x27;s remains were turned over to a United Nations representative and returned to the United States. Major Anderson became the first recipient of the Air Force Cross, the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s second highest decoration for valor after the Medal of Honor, which was awarded to him posthumously.

The Cuban missile confrontation was ultimately resolved and the air strikes, which would have been followed by an invasion of Cuba, were never launched. However, all of the aforementioned squadrons and detachments except one remained at McCoy until the end of November 1962. The 4080th at Laughlin AFB and its successor unit, the 100th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona, would continue to maintain a permanent operating location at McCoy AFB for U-2 detachment operations monitoring Cuba through 1973, when it relocated to nearby Patrick AFB. In later years, these operations would occasionally be augmented by SR-71 detachments from the 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing at Beale AFB, California.

====306th Bombardment Wing====

SAC&#x27;s Strategic Wing concept was phased out in early 1963. In most cases, the aircraft and crews remained at the same base, but the wing (and its bomb squadron) were given new designations. On 1 April 1963, the 306th Bombardment Wing (306 BW), a B-47 Stratojet unit originally scheduled for inactivation, moved on paper from MacDill AFB, Florida to McCoy AFB, converting to a B-52D Stratofortress and KC-135A Stratotanker wing by absorbing the assets and personnel of the 4047th Strategic Wing. With this standup of the 306 BW, the 4074th Strategic Wing was inactivated.

In addition to its &quot;host wing&quot; responsibilities for operating and maintaining the installation, the 306th&#x27;s primary operational mission at McCoy AFB was deterring nuclear attack on the United States by maintaining constant ground alert and flying frequent cycles of airborne alert.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the 306th and McCoy AFB was a frequent host for the annual Strategic Air Command Bombing and Navigation Competition between SAC wings operating B-52, FB-111 and KC-135 aircraft from throughout the Strategic Air Command, competing for the prestigious Fairchild Trophy. Vulcan B.2 bombers and Victor K.2 tankers from the Royal Air Force (RAF) Strike Command would also travel to McCoy AFB from their home bases in the United Kingdom to participate in this multi-week competition.

=====Vietnam War=====
In 1966, the 306 BW began preparing and training for deployment to the Western Pacific in support of Projects Arc Light &amp; Young Tiger. In September 1966, the wing deployed to Andersen AFB, Guam and Kadena Air Base, Okinawa. Its mission while in the Western Pacific was to &quot;...Conduct bombing raids in support of US and allied ground forces fighting in the Vietnamese War.&quot; Later, the wing also operated from U-Tapao Royal Thai Navy Airfield, Thailand as U.S. forces built up in the Vietnam theater. In 1967, the 919th Air Refueling Squadron (919 ARS) was also reassigned to the 306th Bomb Wing.

When not forward deployed for operations over Vietnam, the 306th continued to operate out of McCoy AFB for both training evolutions and in its stateside strategic nuclear alert role. In January 1968, the 306 BW received another Air Force Outstanding Unit Award for this &quot;double-duty&quot; for combat operations in Southeast Asia while maintaining an alert status for SAC.

In 1971, the 919 ARS was inactivated and its personnel and aircraft merged into the 306th Air Refueling Squadron (306 ARS). In 1972, the 306 BW would be part of the heavy bombing raids Linebacker I and Linebacker II over North Vietnam. The 306 BW returned to McCoy AFB from its final Southeast Asia deployment in early 1973 after the Paris Peace Accords ended American involvement in the conflict.

From 1971 through 1973 other training activities at McCoy AFB included KC-135Q instruction by the 306 ARS and KC-135A instruction by the 32d Air Refueling Squadron (32 ARS). Whereas KC-135A aircraft typically carried JP-4 jet fuel, KC-135Q aircraft were specifically modified and equipped to offload JP-7 fuel and supported worldwide in-flight refueling requirements for USAF SR-71 reconnaissance aircraft.

====55th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron====
In February 1970, following the transfer of Kindley AFB, Bermuda to the United States Navy and its redesignation as NAS Bermuda, McCoy AFB briefly became home to the 55th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron (55 ARRS) and its HC-130 Hercules aircraft. Assigned to Military Airlift Command (MAC) and its subordinate sub-command, the Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Service, the squadron relocated from McCoy AFB to Eglin AFB, Florida in June 1971.

====42nd Air Division====

In 1971, the 42d Air Division, was transferred from Blytheville Air Force Base, Arkansas and headquartered at McCoy AFB. In September 1973, with the force reduction-directed closure of McCoy AFB in progress, the air division headquarters was transferred back to Blytheville (later renamed Eaker AFB).

====B-52 crash at McCoy AFB====

On 31 March 1972, a 306th Bombardment Wing B-52D, AF Serial Number 56-0625, sustained multiple engine failures and an engine pod fire shortly after takeoff from McCoy AFB on a routine training mission. Not carrying any weapons, the eight-engine bomber immediately attempted to return to the base, but crashed short of Runway 18R in a civilian residential area immediately north of the airfield, destroying or damaging eight homes. The crew of seven and a 10-year-old boy on the ground were killed. An Orange County historical marker honoring the flight crew was placed adjacent to the crash site in 2012.

===Realignment and closure===
In April 1973, following the cease fire agreement with North Vietnam, the return of all American prisoners of war, and anticipated reduced defense budgets, the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) announced the closure of more than forty (40) bases as part of a post-Vietnam reduction in force (RIF).

Included were the major SAC installations of Ramey AFB, Puerto Rico; Westover AFB, Massachusetts; Kincheloe AFB, Michigan; and McCoy AFB, Florida. In making this announcement, SECDEF Elliot Richardson noted that Ramey was on the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico and Westover and McCoy near the east coast of the United States and therefore, as a rationale for their closure, were &quot;...&quot;subject to short warning time attacks by (Soviet) submarine-launched ballistic missiles&quot;.&quot; Richardson&#x27;s decision was consistent with earlier SAC guidance, issued in 1954, to avoid basing strategic bomber forces within 250 miles of the Atlantic or Gulf Coasts, although this guidance had never been implemented.

However, the 250 mile rationale had been partially employed (in addition to other factors, ranging from the retirement of SAC B-47s in the early 1960s to the costs of maintaining SAC B-52 units in Southeast Asia in support of the Vietnam War in the late 1960s) in the earlier transitioning of MacDill AFB and Homestead AFB in Florida from SAC bomber/tanker bases to TAC fighter bases, the removal of a tenant SAC bomb wing at Eglin AFB, Florida to also be replaced by a TAC fighter wing, the turnover of Turner Air Force Base, Georgia to the United States Navy and its redesignation as Naval Air Station Albany, and the turnover of Hunter Air Force Base, Georgia to the U.S. Army and its redesignation as Hunter Army Airfield.

Westover AFB would transition to Westover Air Reserve Base, an airlift installation under Air Force Reserve control, initially for C-123 Provider and C-130 Hercules aircraft, and eventually for C-5 Galaxy aircraft. Ramey AFB, Kincheloe AFB, and McCoy AFB were destined for civilian airport status, although Ramey would become home to Coast Guard Air Station Borinquen with HH-3F Pelican and continuing today with HH-65C Dolphin helicopters and as a periodic operating location for USAF KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft.

With the announcement of McCoy AFB&#x27;s closure, it was also announced that the 306th Bombardment Wing would also be inactivated. The 306th Bombardment Wing (Heavy) inactivated in July 1974 as activities at the base were phased down prior to the closure, while its personnel, along with its B-52D and KC-135A aircraft assets, were redistributed to other SAC bomb wings. However, this inactivation was short-lived, when the 306th was reactivated in 1975 as the 306th Strategic Wing at RAF Mildenhall, United Kingdom, coordinating SAC KC-135 assets in support of U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) until it was replaced by the 100th Air Refueling Wing in 1992. Today, it operates as the 306th Flying Training Group, an Air Education and Training Command (AETC) unit at the U.S. Air Force Academy and Pueblo Memorial Airport as a geographically separated unit (GSU) of the 12th Flying Training Wing at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas.

EC-121 and U-2 detachment operations at McCoy AFB were also relocated in 1973 and 1974, with ADC&#x27;s EC-121 aircraft moving 210 miles south to Homestead AFB and the 100th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing&#x27;s Lockheed U-2 detachment and associated aircraft Operating Location (OL) moving 45 miles east-southeast to Patrick AFB.

Final closure of McCoy AFB was concluded in early 1975. Those portions of McCoy AFB which were not slated for transfer to other U.S. Government activities (primarily the United States Navy and U.S. Army) were transferred to the General Services Administration (GSA). The GSA subsequently transferred title of the remaining McCoy AFB property, to include the airfield, to the City of Orlando for the sum of $1.00, a standard amount at the time for the transfer of former military air bases to state and local governments. This transfer also contained a reversal clause, another standard practice at the time, enabling the Air Force to return to McCoy in the future if national security requirements ever dictated same.

The Greater Orlando Aviation Authority (GOAA) was established the following year as a successor to the City of Orlando Aviation Department via an act of the Florida State Legislature. GOAA was charged to operate and maintain both the former McCoy AFB and Herndon Airport, the latter subsequently renamed Orlando Executive Airport. The large hangars and myriad of aircraft maintenance support buildings at McCoy were eventually transferred to other U.S. Government agencies or leased by GOAA to private interests, and today many of them remain supporting the civilian aviation community. The combined former McCoy AFB and extant Orlando-McCoy Jetport was renamed the Orlando International Airport, and was greatly expanded to support the growing tourist industry in Orlando as well as the expanding business and commercial expansion of the area. Today Orlando International Airport is among the busiest commercial airports in the world as measured by annual passenger throughput. Over thirty airlines serve the airport with hundreds of daily flights to destinations across the United States and overseas. Orlando International Airport still retains the ICAO code of KMCO and the FAA and IATA code MCO, a legacy of both the Orlando-McCoy Jetport and McCoy AFB.

== Current uses ==
Today a majority of the McCoy AFB site is operated and maintained by the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority (GOAA) as Orlando International Airport. As a governmental entity chartered by the Florida Legislature and as an enterprise fund of the City of Orlando, GOAA is tasked with the operation, administration, maintenance, and oversight of expansions and enhancements to both Orlando International Airport and the Orlando Executive Airport. GOAA also leases buildings and property to private individuals and companies, primarily for aviation-related activities in support of the respective airports. Redeveloped areas on the former McCoy AFB / current Orlando International Airport include:
* The current site for the Orlando International Airport landside and airside terminal complexes and associated support areas.
* Two International Arrivals Concourses with customs, immigration, and agricultural inspection facilities administered by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Of the total 114 airport gates, the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority manages eleven gates with seven additional gates available for international operations. Expansive fixed-base operator, domestic, and charter flight operations facilities are also located on airport property.
* The Orlando Tradeport, a master planned integrated cargo center with direct airside access, of cargo ramp, a Foreign Trade Zone, and an ultramodern Plant Inspection Station with several perishable handling facilities. Originally a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) facility, the station was transferred to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection in 2003. Concurrently, many of the former USAF hangars and maintenance facilities have been taken over by civilian airlines and other aeronautical and aviation firms.

Tributes to Colonel McCoy and McCoy AFB at and near the airport include:
* The airport&#x27;s ICAO, FAA, and IATA airfield identifiers, as well as all airline tickets and baggage tags, continue to read &quot;MCO&quot; which stands for McCoy. The FAA also has an established standard instrument departure (SID) for aircraft departing MCO known as the MCCOY ONE Departure.
* A portrait of Colonel McCoy hangs in the airport&#x27;s main landside terminal near the airport chapel.
* One of the restaurants in the airport&#x27;s Hyatt Hotel is named &quot;McCoy&#x27;s&quot;.
* The Orange County Public School System operates the Colonel Michael McCoy Elementary School, which is located just north of the airport, while a nearby thoroughfare is called McCoy Road.
* McCoy AFB&#x27;s original military credit union continues to operate throughout Central Florida as the McCoy Federal Credit Union.

Over the past 30 years, the majority of the former McCoy AFB has been subjected to extensive modification due to the addition of new structures, taxiways, or runways. In addition, the remaining lands have been subjected to extensive excavation, landfill, and improvement activities. Although several former military structures remain and a new joint military reserve facility added, a significant portion of the former air force base is barely recognizable.

A continuing impact of both the former Pinecastle AAF, Pinecastle AFB, McCoy Air Force Base, and the former Orlando AAB is the continued excavation of unspent ammunition, including small practice bombs, aerial rockets, and machine gun rounds from the World War II era in the areas northeast of the current Orlando International Airport and east and southeast of the current Orlando Executive Airport. These formerly remote and uninhabited areas were leased from local landowners at the time and used as bombing and gunnery ranges for Orlando AAB and Pinecastle AAF when both were Army Air Forces facilities during World War II. At the conclusion of the war, they were returned to the original owners and their previous primarily agricultural purposes. With Central Florida&#x27;s increasing population in the 1980s, 1990s, and early 21st century, these landowners and/or their descendants sold these properties for private redevelopment, predominantly residential housing and associated support infrastructure such as schools, parks, and retail, often with limited or no knowledge of these properties previous wartime utilization. In recent years, new discoveries of unspent conventional munitions have caused repeated closures of Odyssey Middle School, northeast of Orlando International Airport.

===Post-closure military presence===
Up until 1980, Strategic Air Command considered retaining the former SAC Alert Facility on the south end of the airfield as either an Operating Location (OL) or as a smaller installation to be called McCoy Air Force Station under control of an air base squadron for occasional dispersal basing of two B-52D/G/H and two KC-135A/E/Q aircraft from other SAC installations. This concept never came to fruition, but the Alert Facility, a nose dock hangar and several buildings on the north end of the McCoy ramp were turned over to the United States Army Reserve (USAR) for use as the 49th Army Aviation Support Facility for USAR units, specifically the 138th Aviation Company (EW), which operated RU-8D, JU-21A, RU-21A, RU-21B and RU-21C aircraft until replaced by C-12 Huron and RC-12G electronic reconnaissance aircraft, plus the 348th Medical Detachment with UH-1 medical evacuation helicopters. This arrangement permitted USAF access to the remaining military facilities at MCO if and when it became necessary. The United States Army Reserve aviation units were inactivated in 1999 pursuant to an earlier Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) decision, but most of the Alert Facility still remains under United States Army Reserve control as a non-flying military facility.

A significant portion of the McCoy AFB base facilities were transferred to the United States Navy between 1974 and 1975, primarily base housing, base exchange, commissary, medical clinic, base chapel, and morale, welfare and recreation (MWR) facilities, becoming the Naval Training Center Orlando McCoy Annex. From 1975 to 1999, the Annex supported various tenant command activities at the Annex that included the Army Reserve aviation units, other units of the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Naval Reserve, U.S. Army Reserve, Florida Army National Guard, and the U.S. Air Force Liaison Office of the Florida Wing of the Civil Air Patrol. Administrative support and housing area for both McCoy Annex activities and primary command and tenant command activities at the nearby Naval Training Center Orlando were also maintained.

In 1984, a B-52D Stratofortress, AF Serial No. 56-0687, on loan from the National Museum of the United States Air Force, was flown to Orlando International Airport from the 7th Bomb Wing at the then-Carswell AFB, Texas for permanent static display at the airport&#x27;s McCoy AFB / B-52 Memorial Park. It is located north-northwest of the current civilian commercial terminal and just east of and adjacent to the former location of the since dismantled Orlando-McCoy Jetport civilian terminal.

McCoy Annex operated until Naval Training Center Orlando&#x27;s closure in late 1999 pursuant to a 1993 Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) decision. The former military family housing area originally constructed by the Air Force and later utilized by the Navy and other military service branches was fully turned over to the City of Orlando in late 1999 and was redeveloped into The Villages at Southport. Housing sales began in 1996 and the complex was awarded a US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) award for outstanding development.

With the closure of NTC Orlando in late 1999, The only military activities remaining at the former McCoy AFB today are units of the Reserve components of the United States Armed Forces.

The 1LT David R. Wilson Armed Forces Reserve Center hosts the United States Army Reserve 143rd Sustainment Command (Expeditionary), 912th Human Resources Company, 196th Transportation Company, 146th Transportation Detachment, 520th Transportation Detachment/3rd Team, 174th Judge Advocate General Detachment/10th Team, 174th Judge Advocate General Detachment/11th Team, 174th Judge Advocate General Detachment, the United States Navy Reserve Navy Operational Support Center Orlando (NOSC Orlando) and the United States Marine Corps Reserve Motor Transportation Company, Combat Logistics Battalion 451.

The Taft United States Army Reserve Center is located at 9500 Armed Forces Reserve Drive and includes the 689th Engineer Company and 418th Military Police Detachment.

The McCoy United States Army Reserve Center is home for the 377th Military Intelligence Battalion, which utilizes McCoy AFB&#x27;s former SAC bomber and tanker flight crew Alert Facility (e.g., &quot;mole hole&quot;).

The Orlando Armory of the Florida Army National Guard is located within the grounds of the former McCoy AFB, having converted the former McCoy AFB Officers Club into the 164th Air Defense Artillery Brigade (FL ARNG) Headquarters.

The Navy Exchange (to include an NEX MaxiMart grocery facility in lieu of a Defense Commissary Agency commissary) continued operations at the former McCoy Air Force Base. The Navy Exchange facility has a Barber Shop, Optical Shop, Tailor Shop, Subway restaurant and a Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) Information, Tours and Tickets office. This is due to the continued presence of Naval Air Warfare Center and Naval Support Activity Orlando, a large National Guard &amp; Reserve Component presence, and the military retiree population in the Orlando/Central Florida area that makes the facility financially self-sustaining.
