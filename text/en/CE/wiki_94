<text>Háromszék (&quot;Three Seats&quot;; Romanian: &quot;Trei Scaune&quot;) was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. Situated in south-eastern Transylvania, its territory is now in central Romania (in the counties of Covasna, Brașov, and Bacău). The capital of the county was Sepsiszentgyörgy (now Sfântu Gheorghe).

==Geography==

Háromszék county shared borders with Romania and the Hungarian counties Csík, Udvarhely, Nagy-Küküllő, and Brassó. The river Olt flowed through the county. The Carpathian Mountains formed its southern and eastern border. Its area was around 1910.

==History==

Háromszék means &quot;three seats&quot;. Háromszék County was a combination of three seats of the Székelys: Kézdiszék, Orbaiszék, and Sepsiszék (plus some villages of the former Felső-Fehér County). The county was formed in 1876, when the administrative structure of Transylvania was changed.

In 1920, under the Treaty of Trianon, the county became part of the Kingdom of Romania under the name Trei Scaune. After the Second Vienna Award of August 1940, the county was recreated with most of its historic territory as it became part of the Northern Transylvania territory of Hungary again until October 1944, towards the end of World War II.

Afterward, it became part of Romania again; its territory lies mainly in the present Romanian county of Covasna, with a small part in the south being part of Brașov County.

<text>Lespedeza is a genus of some 45 species (including nothospecies) of flowering plants in the pea family (Fabaceae), commonly known as bush clovers or (particularly East Asian species) Japanese clovers (&quot;hagi&quot;). The genus is native to warm temperate to subtropical regions of eastern North America, eastern and southern Asia and Australasia.

These shrubby plants or trailing vines belong to the &quot;typical&quot; legumes (Faboideae), with the peas and beans, though they are part of another tribe, the Desmodieae. Therein, they are treated as type genus of the smaller subtribe Lespedezinae, which unites the present genus and its presumed closest relatives, &quot;Campylotropis&quot; and &quot;Kummerowia&quot;.

==Name of the plant==
According to American botanist Asa Gray (1810–1888), the &quot;Lespedeza&quot; owes its name to governor of East Florida Vicente Manuel de Céspedes (1784–1790; who, through a letter, allowed botanist André Michaux to explore East Florida in search of new species of plants, where Michaux found Lespedeza), but when Céspedes wrote the letter, at the beginning of it, the name of Céspedes was changed to &quot;Zespedez&quot;. So, when Michaux&#x27;s book &quot;Flora Boreali-Americana&quot; of 1802 was printed, the name &quot;Céspedes&quot; to refer to the plant was written as &quot;Lespedez&quot;, the word from which the current name of the plant was derived.

&quot;Despeleza&quot; is a synonym of &quot;Lespedeza&quot;, and this name is derived from a taxonomic anagram.

==Cultivation and uses==
Some species are grown as garden or ornamental plants, and are used as a forage crops, notably in the southern United States, and as a means of soil enrichment and for prevention of erosion. In some areas, certain species are invasive. &quot;Lespedeza&quot;, like other legumes, have root nodules that harbor bacteria capable of nitrogen fixation from the air into a soil-bound form that can be taken up by other plants. Growers can take advantage of this process by putting the plants in their fields to release nitrogen, so they can use less fertilizer.

&quot;L. bicolor&quot; leaves and roots contain l-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (lespedamine), as well as related Nω,Nω-dimethyltryptamines and their oxides, as well as some bufotenin.

<text>Hunyad (today mainly Hunedoara) was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary, of the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom and of the Principality of Transylvania. Its territory is now in Romania in Transylvania. The capital of the county was Déva (present-day Deva).

==Geography==

After 1876, Hunyad county shared borders with Romania and the Hungarian counties Krassó-Szörény, Arad, Torda-Aranyos, Alsó-Fehér and Szeben. Its area was 7,809 km2 around 1910.

==Etymology==
The toponym Hunyad most likely comes from the Hungarian verb, meaning &#x27;to close&#x27; or &#x27;to die&#x27;. According to linguist Géza Kuun, the name may keep the memory of the Huns.

==History==
The first known civilization living on the territory were the Scythian Agathyrsi and Sigynnae. Later the Dacians under their leader Burebista established solid control over the territory, but were conquered and massacred by the Roman Empire. Hunyad was part of Roman Dacia for a short time, but by the 3rd century it was occupied by the Goths, later by the Vandals and Gepids. The nomadic Avars conquered Transylvania in 567, and remained the ethnic majority even after the collapse of their khaganate. The Igech, Szerekes, Andos and Zeyk noble families are all of Avar origin, along with the name of the river Zsil.

Hunyad county was formed in the Middle Ages. It was first attested in 1265 as &quot;Hungnod&quot; by the Papal Quitrent Register. In 1876, when the administrative structure of Transylvania was changed, its territory was modified to include about two thirds of the former Zaránd County (Brád/Brad and Körösbánya/Baia de Criș districts) and the Saxon seat of Broos/Orăștie. In 1920, by the Treaty of Trianon, the county became part of Romania. Most of its territory lies in the present Romanian county Hunedoara; a strip in the east is now part of Alba and a strip in the west is now part of Caraș-Severin County (the commune Băuţar).

In the early 20th century, the subdivisions of Hunyad County were:

<text>Velichko Cholakov (, 12 January 1982 20 August 2017) was a Bulgarian weightlifter.

==Career==
He competed in the over 105 kg class at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, his first Olympics, winning an Olympic bronze medal. After missing two clean and jerk attempts at 245 kg, he managed to lift a total of 447.5 kg, placing him behind Latvia&#x27;s Viktors Ščerbatihs and Iran&#x27;s Hossein Reza Zadeh.

Velichko won the European weightlifting title in Kyiv, Ukraine in 2004, and finished second at the World championship in Vancouver in 2003. In 2002, he won gold medals at both the European and World Youth Weightlifting championships.

He was once measured during competition as 2.05 meters tall, thus making lifting more difficult both in regard to distance of elevation and less than ideal limb proportions.

Cholakov tested positive for a steroid in 2008 during an out-of-competition test, along with ten other weightlifters, and therefore Bulgaria&#x27;s weightlifting federation withdrew its team from the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. Apart from Cholakov the athletes who tested positive were Ivailo Filev, Alan Tsagaev, Mehmed Fikretov, Ivan Stoitsov, Ivan Markov, Georgi Markov, Demir Demirev, Milka Maneva, Donka Mincheva and Gergana Kirilova. 
 He was supposed to compete for Azerbaijan during the 2012 Summer Olympics, but withdrew before the 105+ kg competition due to health issues.

== Career bests ==
* Snatch: 207.5 kg in 2004 Summer Olympics.
* Clean and jerk: 245.0 kg 2004 European Weightlifting Championships.
* Total: 447.5 kg (205.0+242.5) 2003 World Weightlifting Championships.

== Death ==
Velichko Cholakov died in Smolyan on 20 August 2017, aged 35, after a recent history of heart problems.

<text>A boat lift, ship lift, or lift lock is a machine for transporting boats between water at two different elevations, and is an alternative to the canal lock.

It may be vertically moving, like the Anderton boat lift in England, rotational, like the Falkirk Wheel in Scotland, or operate on an inclined plane, like the Ronquières inclined plane in Belgium.

==History==
A precursor to the canal boat lift, able to move full-sized canal boats, was the tub boat lift used in mining, able to raise and lower the 2.5 ton tub boats then in use. An experimental system was in use on the Churprinz mining canal in Halsbrücke near Dresden. It lifted boats using a moveable hoist rather than caissons. The lift operated between 1789 and 1868, and for a period of time after its opening engineer James Green reporting that five had been built between 1796 and 1830. He credited the invention to Dr James Anderson of Edinburgh.

The idea of a boat lift for canals can be traced back to a design based on balanced water-filled caissons in Erasmus Darwin&#x27;s Commonplace Book (pp. 58–59) dated 1777–1778

In 1796 an experimental balance lock was designed by James Fussell and constructed at Mells on the Dorset and Somerset Canal, though this project was never completed. A similar design was used for lifts on the tub boat section of the Grand Western Canal entered into operation in 1835 becoming the first non-experimental boat lifts in Britain and pre-dating the Anderton Boat Lift by 40 years.

In 1904 the Peterborough Lift Lock designed by Richard Birdsall Rogers opened in Canada. This high lift system is operated by gravity alone, with the upper bay of the two bay system loaded with an additional of water as to give it greater weight.

Before the construction of the Three Gorges Dam Ship Lift, the highest boat lift, with a height difference and European Class IV (1350 tonne) capacity, was the Strépy-Thieu boat lift in Belgium opened in 2002.

The ship lift at the Three Gorges Dam, completed in January 2016, is high and able to lift vessels of up to 3,000 tons displacement.

The boat lift at Longtan is reported to be even higher in total with a maximum vertical lift of in two stages when completed.

<text>Vallespir (; ) is a historical Catalan comarca in Northern Catalonia, part of the French department of Pyrénées-Orientales. 

==Geography==
The capital of the comarca is Ceret, and it borders the comarques of Conflent, Rosselló, Alt Empordà, Garrotxa and Ripollès. It lies in the Tech River valley, which crosses it from west to east.

The northern half of the comarca is dominated by the &quot;Pla Guillem&quot; and the mountain of Canigó, and to the south are the mountains of Puig de Comanegra and Roc de la Fraussa.

Ceret, the capital, contains about a third of the comarca&#x27;s polulation. Other notable towns include Amélie-les-Bains-Palalda, Arles, and Prats-de-Mollo-la-Preste.

==Name==
The name Vallespir first appears in writing in 814 under the form &quot;Vallis Asperi,&quot; and from the 9th to the 11th centuries, the names &quot;Valle Asperi&quot; or &quot;Valle Asperii&quot; were common.

By the 18th century, the form &quot;Vall de Spir&quot; appears to be the most common, seen in documents from 1706 and 1813. In the 19th century, other references call it &quot;Val Spir&quot; or &quot;Val Spire&quot;.

<text>Bajo Cinca () or Baix Cinca (; , ) is a comarca in eastern Aragon, Spain. It is named after river Cinca.

This comarca is located in the southeastern corner of the Huesca province.
The administrative capital is Fraga, with 13,592 inhabitants the largest town of the comarca.

Bajo Cinca/Baix Cinca borders La Litera/La Llitera, Cinca Medio, Monegros and Bajo Aragón-Caspe/Baix Aragó-Casp in Aragon and Segrià and Ribera d&#x27;Ebre in Catalonia. About half of the comarca, including the two largest towns (Fraga and Mequinenza), belongs to the Catalan-speaking strip in eastern Aragon known as La Franja; some municipal terms of Bajo Cinca/Baix Cinca are part of the historical region of Lower Aragon. 

==Municipal terms==
The region includes the municipalities of Ballobar (Vallobar), Belver de Cinca (Bellver de Cinca), Candasnos, Chalamera (Xalamera), Fraga, Mequinenza (Mequinensa), Ontiñena (Ontinyena), Osso de Cinca (Ossó de Cinca), Torrente de Cinca (Torrent de Cinca), Velilla de Cinca (Vilella de Cinca) and Zaidín (Saidí). The 11 municipalities that comprise it are from the province of Huesca, with the exception of Mequinenza that belongs to Zaragoza.

==Geography==
The Bajo / Baix Cinca limits to the east with the Autonomous Community of Catalonia, to the north with the Region of Cinca Medio and La Litera, to the west with the Monegros and to the south with the Bajo Aragón.

The region sits on the final stretch of the Cinca River, in the center of the Middle Ebro Depression, between the Zaragoza, Huesca and Lleida. The Cinca River, historical and cultural axis, divides the &quot;comarca&quot; asymmetrically and brings together almost all the villages, except Candasnos.

Its geography is characterized by the contrast of the fertile banks of the Ebro, Cinca and Segre and the arid land that extends outside the valleys. In recent years, irrigation has also been developed in rainfed areas, so that the landscape has been slightly modified to adapt it to agricultural needs.

Its relief has been the result of thousands of years of work in the Cinca River that, with the evolution of the years, was excavating its channel forming large and uneven terraces on both banks of its channel, which historically have been converted into fertile orchards.

The landscape is a true natural heritage that the people of Bajo / Baix Cinca are committed to conserve. The impressive contrast between the river banks full of greenery and the arid land of the Monegros offers an unparalleled variety of ecosystems. It can be found from fauna and flora with typical characteristics of the steppes and deserts to the enormous ornithological richness that abounds on the banks of the rivers. Of special natural importance is the one known as Aiguabarreig (&quot;water mixture&quot; in Catalan) that is formed in the final stretch of the confluence of the Cinca, Segre and Ebro rivers in Mequinenza.

==Climatography==
The weather is continental with little rainfall, a fact that determines the vegetation of the area. The warmest months are July and August, when the temperature can reach 35 °C or sometimes up to 40 °C. On the other hand, in the cold months of December and January the temperatures range between 0 °C and -5 °C. The region receives the cold and dry wind called &quot;cierzo&quot; that descends along the Ebro valley.

The average rainfall level ranges between 300 and 400 mm, distributed very irregularly throughout the year. Prolonged periods of drought are common.

==Population==
The socio-economic transformation experienced in Spain in the 1960s caused territorially a double current of emigration: from the interior areas to the periphery and from the rural to the urban centers. For the Bajo / Baix Cinca region, as for other areas of Aragon, it meant a strong depopulation of its rural nuclei and the concentration of a part of the population in the capital of the region.

The population of the region represents 11.03% of the total of the province of Huesca. The proportion between men and women is quite homogeneous. Fraga is where most of the population is concentrated, followed by Mequinenza with almost 9.64% of the comarca&#x27;s total. All municipalities have a historical decrease with the exception of Fraga.

==Economy==
The Bajo / Baix Cinca region is one of the most dynamic regions in Aragon, mainly promoted by the agricultural sector. The percentage of the population employed in agriculture with respect to the total is 25.5%, creating an important added value in the sweet fruit sector. The Bajo / Baix Cinca is the Aragonese region with the most cultivated hectares in this sector. The Bajo / Baix Cinca has always been an agricultural area for two fundamental reasons: the first one because traditionally and culturally it has been associated to the countryside and the second one due to the weather factor and the low rainfall rate. It is a very important sector with a considerable increase in production due to the modernization of agricultural holdings and the increase of the Mequinenza irrigable area, reaching more than 3,000 hectares. Mequinenza has become a regional engines that leads this sector mainly dedicated to peach, cherry, olive and almond.

Industry in Bajo / Baix Cinca is based mainly on industrial activities. The agrobusiness sector has a high percentage of companies, and its prominence in relation to direct and indirect employment is very significant. Services sector is also relevant for the economy of the area, representing the second source of income for the population, with a special importance of the tourism sector in areas such as Mequinenza that have numerous companies of active tourism, sport fishing and cultural tourism that attract both national and international visitors throughout the year.

Historically, the energy production sector has been concentrated also in Mequinenza. Initially, in 1850s it was with the coal extraction from the Mequinenza coal basin for more than 150 years and later with the construction of hydroelectric reservoirs of Mequinenza (also known as &quot;Mar de Aragón&quot;) and Riba-roja.

==History==
The Comarca del Bajo / Baix Cinca is located in a privileged and strategic position that has made it a meeting place for civilizations, cultures and languages. It is crossed by the Cinca river, to which it owes its name, a river that receives the waters of the Alcanadre and finally joins the Segre river that ends up depositing its waters in the Ebro river in Mequinenza.

The region treasures numerous vestiges of prehistoric villages (such as the archaeological sites of Castellets or Riols in Mequinenza) Iberians, Ibero-Romans, Romans (such as Villa Fortunatus in Fraga), Visigoths, Arabs, Jews and Christians. The result of this is a mixture of Romanesque, Gothic and Mudejar art that invades the heritage of an ancient region.

They are declared Sites of Cultural Interest in the category of archaeological zone: Villa Fortunatus and El Pilaret de Santa Quiteria in Fraga, Mas de Fayonet I, Vallbufandes, Valmayor I, Valmayor IV in Mequinenza, and El castellazo in Ballobar. In the category of monument are the Tower of the Friars, the Tower of the Pilaret of Santa Quiteria and the San Miguel church in Fraga, the Cross of Escarpe and the Castle of Mequinenza in Mequinenza, the castle of Zaidín, the Hermitage of Santa María in Chalamera and the Castle of Torrente de Cinca. In addition, the region has three museums in Mequinenza (grouped in the Museums of Mequinenza) and two located in Fraga as the House Museum of Salvador Sabaté and the Palace of Montcada.

==Culture and heritage==
===Castle of Mequinenza===
The castle stands at the edge of a great cliff overlooking the confluence of the Ebro, Segre and Cinca rivers. Its plan is an irregular quadrilateral with seven rectangular towers except one which is pentagonal. Two towers flank the small semicircular door protected by a portico. Few fortresses will have a better location than this, contemplating an extensive and impressive landscape on the confluence of the three rivers and their surrounding lands until reaching the Pyrenees at the horizon. The noble family of Moncada, lords of the barony of Mequinenza, chose this eagle&#x27;s nest to create a castle-palace fortification. The building is an authentic masterpiece, one of the best that Gothic art bequeathed to the Crown of Aragon. It is dated from the 14th and 15th centuries.

Initially, it was possibly an Arab fortress built by the Berber tribe of the Miknasa towards the 12th century. The tribe created the town and also give its name. With the reconquest it fell to Ramón Berenguer IV. After being a crown possession, it was given to the noble family of Moncada. One of the great sieges of the castle took place during the Peninsular War when it was conquered by the French Napoleonic troops of Marshal Suchet; it belonged to the French government until 1814. &quot;Mequinenza&quot; was inscribed in large letters on one of the outer columns of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris to commemorate one of the great French victories in the Iberian Peninsula.

Currently the castle is privately owned by the ENDESA Foundation. In order to visit the castle it is necessary to put in a request in advance at the Tourist Office of the City Council of Mequinenza. Guided free tours are held on Tuesday mornings with prior request.

===Museums of Mequinenza===

In the Museums of Mequinenza it is possible to explore an underground coal mining gallery with more than 1000 meters in the Museum of the Mine, explore the history of the population until the disappearance of the old town under the waters of the Ebro river in the Museum of History or discover how was the Prehistory in the Museum of the Prehistoric Past. Inaugurated in 2010, they are located in the old Maria Quintana School Group, the old schools of the town built in 1929.

===Old Town of Mequinenza===
The old town of Mequinenza was located on the left bank of the Ebro River, just at the point where they converge with the waters of Segre and Cinca. It was demolished almost completely during the construction of the Ribarroja reservoir. It constituted an urban nucleus with characteristics of the localities of the lower section of the Ebro, with an urban plot dating back to the Muslim era.

With the franquismo and the arrival of the ENHER company and the construction of the Mequinenza and Riba-roja dams, life changed for the old town on the banks of the Ebro. The industries began to close due to the significant increase in the water level of the waters and the population began to demand alternatives to the flooding of the urban nucleus. Thus began an exodus for the inhabitants of Mequinenza who had to leave their homes to move to a new population.

Part of the ancient population of Mequinenza can be visited today because it has become a large outdoor memory park. The original paths of the streets and houses that were above the water level have been recovered from the runes. The old Mequinenza, the &quot;Old Town&quot;, is an invitation to walk through the memory of its streets and alleys, to rediscover part of the old Church, to imagine the old docks and to know a thousand stories, curiosities and legends from a millenary and historic town of navigators and miners on the banks of the Ebro river.

===Jesús Moncada and &quot;The towpath&quot;===
Mequinenza is also a reference point for literature lovers. Jesús Moncada, the most universal writer from Mequinenza, turned the old village into the main location of the many personal stories told in his books. His novel &quot;Camí de Sirga&quot; (&quot;The Towpath&quot;) was translated into more than 20 languages (including Japanese, Swedish and Vietnamese). It is an amalgam of characters and stories from ancient Mequinenza and its tragic disappearance.

He is considered one of the most important authors in Catalan language of his time. He received several awards for all his works, among others the City of Barcelona Award or the National Critics Award in 1989 for &quot;Camí de sirga&quot; or the Creu de Sant Jordi granted by the Generalitat of Catalonia in 2001. In 2004 he received the Aragonese Letters Prize.

===Ramón J. Sender===
Ramón José Sender Garcés was a Spanish novelist, essayist and journalist born in Chalamera in 1901. Several of his works were translated into English by the distinguished zoologist, Sir Peter Chalmers Mitchell, including &quot;Seven Red Sundays&quot; (&quot;Siete domingos rojos&quot;), &quot;Mr Witt Among the Rebels&quot; (&quot;Mr Witt en el cantón&quot;) and &quot;The War in Spain&quot; (&quot;Contraataque&quot;).

===Bilingual zone===
The Bajo / Baix Cinca region is bilingual. The municipalities of Mequinenza, Torrente de Cinca, Velilla de Cinca and Zaidín are mostly Catalan speakers while Fraga brings together a similar percentage of Catalan-speaking and Spanish-speaking population. The municipalities of Ballobar, Belver de Cinca, Candasnos, Chalamera, Ontiñena and Osso de Cinca are Spanish speakers.

More than 80% of the inhabitants of Bajo / Baix Cinca speak Western Catalan. The successive civilizations that passed throughout history through this territory left their culture and also their language. In this sense, the Catalan landed in this territory at the time of the Reconquest initiated by Ramón Berenguer IV who repopulated this region with people coming from the Ribagorza, the Pallars and the Urgel. The language has survived to the present in its oral variant. The majority of its inhabitants are bilingual in Spanish - the language in which all primary and secondary education are received - and also in Catalan.

====Declaration of Mequinenza====
The Declaration of Mequinenza (Declaració de Mequinensa in Catalan) is a document signed on 1 February 1984 in Mequinenza (Bajo / Baix Cinca, Aragon, Spain) by the mayors of 17 municipalities of the Aragonese Catalan-speaking area together with José Bada Paniello (Minister of Culture of Government of Aragon at the time). Following the declaration, and complying with one of the proposals contained therein, on 1 October 1985, an agreement between the Government of Aragon and the Ministry of Education and Science for the teaching of education would be signed and published in the Official Gazette of Aragon Catalan language as a voluntary and evaluable subject in schools in the area.

==Nature heritage==
The dominant plants in the region are Mediterranean species adapted to drought and harsh weather conditions. They are little demanding plants, of great geological breadth such as &quot;carrasco&quot; pine, &quot;coscoja&quot;, rosemary or thyme. The fauna is linked to the steppe, riverside and desert areas of Monegros. The water turtle, the ocellated lizard or the southern snake are the main ones in terms of amphibians and reptiles. Mammals include hedgehogs, rodents and bats that live next to foxes, rabbits and deers. The Bajo / Baix Cinca has six Special Protection Areas for Birds: El Basal, Las Menorcas and Llanos de Cardiel; el Pas and Santa Rita Reservoir; La Retuerta and las Saladas; the Aiguabarreig in Mequinenza and the Sierra de Alcubierre and Valcuerna, Serreta Negra and Liberola. In these places it is possible to observe birds such as the vultures, partridge eagles, bustards and royal herons.

==Tourism==
===Fishing===
One of the most peculiar species that can be found in Mequinenza is catfish. It has become its largest habitat in Spain. Mequinenza has become an international place of reference for fishing enthusiasts from all over Spain and abroad (mainly Germans, French, English, Americans and Japanese), willing to face a fish whose characteristics have already made it mythical, achieving catches of 250 centimeters and more than one hundred kilograms of weight. Other species such as common carp, pike perch, blackbass or bathrobes can also be found. About 30 sport fishing competitions are held every year in the Mequinenza reservoir.

===Nautical sports===
Mequinenza has a race course considered one of the best in Spain for its excellent accessibility, its stable sheet of water and its sports facilities on the banks of the reservoir. In the calm waters of its reservoir it is possible to practice many sports. The rowing teams of Oxford and Cambridge, and other rowing national teams, choose Mequinenza as a place to do their preparation stages.

===Active tourism===
Mequinenza is the locality that registers a greater number of companies of active tourism and adventure of the province of Zaragoza and the fifth at the level of Aragon. The companies of active tourism and adventure are identified with a logo that represents a wind rose on a yellow background and the signature granted by the Government of Aragon. It is about guaranteeing visitors by offering quality standards, something that in the case of Mequinenza is highly valued, a fact that has made the town a benchmark for fishing in Europe and the preferred destination of many international fishermen.

==Gastronomy==
The Bajo / Baix Cinca is an area of orchards, where there is an abundance of fresh fruit and quality nuts, something that is collected in traditional desserts such as elmostillo, farinosos, pumpkin dumplings, Fraga coc or dried figs. Huerta and sheep are also basic in the dishes of the area with special importance on game meat such as rabbit, hare, partridge, wild boar and deer.

The Bajo / Baix Cinca provides a unique space for viticulture that can be found north of the region, specifically in the municipality of Belver de Cinca. Another of the historical ingredients and with greater tradition of the region are the olive oils of the Arbequina variety (of mild, aromatic flavor, and with fruity touches) and Empeltre (of soft and sweet flavor, less intense than the Arbequina variety). Several companies in the area have been awarded in numerous national and international competitions. Historically, the Arabs called the lower course of the Cinca River as &quot;river of the olive trees&quot; (&quot;Nahr al-Zaytún&quot;) term that was incorporated in the toponyms of some localities like Mequinenza, then known as Miknasa al- Zaytun.

Mequinenza cherry is particularly appreciated since the area offers a microclimate that allows to obtain the first open-field cherry productions from all over Europe offering cherries with exceptional organoleptic qualities both in hardness and color and in sweetness. The earliest varieties are destined for the international market in central and northern Europe, for the Emirates or even for Asia. Likewise, varieties of peach, nectarine, grape, Paraguayan or platerina can also be found.

==Traditions==
El Bajo / Baix Cinca is a frontier land where many traditions that live in full bloom survive. The Major Festivities of each municipality, become one of the great festive axes although the parties are distributed throughout the year. In Fraga, the figure of &quot;les de faldetes&quot; is typical, a holiday that pays tribute to this typical costume of the Bajocinqueña town as well as the offering to the Virgen del Pilar. In the other municipalities, celebrations such as the San Roque festivities in Ballobar, the Holy Week processions of Belver de Cinca, the distribution of the rosqueta in Candasnos, Easter Mondays or the pilgrimage to the hermitage of San Marcos are also celebrated. in Chalamera, the celebrations of Santa Agatoclia de Mequinenza, the celebrations of Santa Reliquia in Ontiñena, the equestrian concentration of Bajo / Baix Cinca in the month of June in Osso de Cinca, the verbena of San Juan in Torrente de Cinca, the celebrations of San Lorenzo in Velilla de Cinca or the feasts of the Virgin of the Assumption in Zaidín.

The &quot;Fiestas de San Blas and Santa Águeda&quot; that are celebrated in Mequinenza (Zaragoza) on the first weekend of February were declared in 2018 as Fiesta of Tourist Interest of Aragon with code F.I.T.A. Number 844.

<doc id="934376" wikidata="Q5978419" url="?curid=934376" title="I Married an Angel">
<text>I Married an Angel is a 1938 musical comedy by Rodgers and Hart. It was adapted from a play by Hungarian playwright János Vaszary, entitled &quot;Angyalt Vettem Felesegul&quot;. The book was by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, with music by Rodgers and lyrics by Hart. The story concerns a wealthy banker who, disillusioned with women, decides that the only mate for him would be an angel. An angel soon arrives, and he marries her, but finds out that her perfection and guilelessness are inconvenient.

==Plot==
A wealthy Budapest banker, Count Willie Palaffi, is love-weary. He ends his engagement to Anna Murphy, swearing that the only girl he could marry would be an angel. A real angel soon flies into his life, and he marries her. It turns out, however, that she is free of the human failings that permit people to tolerate each other. In particular, she is unable to fib. Her honesty alienates Willie&#x27;s high society acquaintances and his biggest customer and causes a run on his bank. His sister, Countess Palaffi, saves the day by teaching the angel about the real world. She also bribes taxi drivers to make Willie&#x27;s creditors late, so that he has time to save his bank. Willie and his now Earthier angel live happily ever after.

==Productions==
&quot;I Married an Angel&quot; opened at the Shubert Theatre on May 11, 1938 and closed on February 25, 1939 after 338 performances, followed by an extensive tour. It was directed by newcomer Joshua Logan, with choreography by George Balanchine, scenic design by Jo Mielziner, and costume design by John Hambleton. The cast included Dennis King as Willi, Vera Zorina as Angel, Vivienne Segal as Peggy, Walter Slezak as Harry, Charles Walters as Peter and Audrey Christie as Anna.

Two productions were mounted in 1964: one at Valley Forge Music Fair starring Don Ameche, Margaret Whiting and Taina Elg, and a second at the Royal Poinciana Plaza Playhouse starring Elaine Stritch, Clifford David and Taina Elg. In 1977, the musical was produced at the Berskshire Theatre Festival starring Phyllis Newman, Terence Monk and Valerie Mahaffey. New York staged readings were presented by the New Amsterdam Theatre Company (1986) with Phyllis Newman, Kurt Peterson, and Karen Ziemba; and by the Rodgers &amp; Hart Rediscovered concert series (1995) with Jason Graae, Kim Criswell, Victoria Clark and Marin Mazzie. The musical was also presented as a staged reading by San Francisco&#x27;s 42nd Street Moon theatre company in 1995 and again in 2000 and by Musicals Tonight!, New York City, as a staged concert in 2000.
It was staged by New York City Center&#x27;s &quot;Encores!&quot; in March 2019.

==Film and radio==
In 1942, MGM made the musical into a musical film starring Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy, but as was invariably the case with film adaptations of Rodgers &amp; Hart, the story is entirely different, and the songs are mostly not from the play. A 1952 radio production starred Gordon MacRae and Lucille Norman was also produced.

<doc id="934382" wikidata="Q5354088" url="?curid=934382" title="Eldorado (TV series)">
<text>Eldorado (English: &quot;The Golden One&quot;) is a British soap opera created by Tony Holland. It ran for only one year, from 6 July 1992 to 9 July 1993. Set in the fictional town of Los Barcos on the Costa Eldorado in Spain and following the lives of British and European expatriates, the BBC hoped it would be as successful as &quot;EastEnders&quot; and replicate some of the sunshine and glamour of imported Australian soaps such as &quot;Home and Away&quot; and &quot;Neighbours&quot;.

In spite of a high-profile advertising campaign on television, radio and in the press preceding the launch (&#x27;Are you ready for &quot;Eldorado&quot;?&#x27;, read by actor Campbell Morrison), the programme was not initially a popular hit with viewers or critics. Following a radical overhaul, ratings improved, but it was deemed too late to save the programme and it was cancelled by BBC1&#x27;s new controller, Alan Yentob, in March 1993.

==Creation==

&quot;Eldorado&quot; was conceived originally from an internal competition within the BBC as a replacement for Terry Wogan&#x27;s chat show &quot;Wogan&quot;, which aired on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 7.00 pm. The series was created by Tony Holland and produced by Julia Smith, both of whom had collaborated before whilst creating fellow BBC soap &quot;EastEnders&quot;. The original working title for the series being &quot;Little England&quot;, in which a group of Brits lived within an enclave of the Spanish coast. However, during production, the concept was radically revised. The first episode was written by Tony Jordan, who, several years after &quot;Eldorado&quot;, criticised the start of the soap.

&quot;Eldorado&quot; eventually became a co-production between the BBC and independent production company Cinema Verity, James Todesco and John Dark. While Smith served as the series producer, Verity Lambert was made the show&#x27;s executive producer. At the time, Lambert had established her reputation as an in-house producer for the BBC, having previously launched the BBC&#x27;s successful science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

==Problems and criticism==
The series was set to debut in September 1992, but the premiere date was brought forward to July of that year, which meant the turnaround of production had to be quickened. Although the show featured many professional actors, including Patricia Brake and Jesse Birdsall, many of the cast were inexperienced actors whose limitations became exposed on a new and ambitious project. Prior to filming, some of the cast were even unaware what a read-through was; the quality of the acting was derided by some tabloid newspapers.

As a result of filming in bare-walled villas rather than a studio, there were many sound and acoustic problems, such as reverberation. Possibly in a bid to court media attention, &quot;Eldorado&quot; opened with the controversial story of a middle-aged man, Bunny (played by Roger Walker), returning from the UK with a 17-year-old bride, Fizz (Kathy Pitkin); many viewers felt this storyline was implausible and sordid. On top of this, ITV decided to air a special one-hour edition of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; on the show&#x27;s debut evening, reputedly an attempt by network executives to sabotage the programme.

As a result, the costly production – although not exorbitant by contemporary television standards – was used by critics of the television licence to argue that the BBC was feathering the nest of former employees. Due to the stresses of internal feuding, producer Julia Smith had a nervous breakdown and left the soap opera. She was replaced by Corinne Hollingworth, who had previously worked on &quot;EastEnders&quot;. Hollingworth brought about many changes to &quot;Eldorado&quot; by hiring new scriptwriters, creating extra rehearsal time and removing many of the inexperienced actors who had attracted criticism.

==Cancellation==
Changes made by Hollingworth to rectify the soap&#x27;s early problems led to a ratings increase, but it was claimed that this was not enough to justify its continued production, and incoming controller of BBC1, Alan Yentob, cancelled the programme, which had been commissioned by his predecessor Jonathan Powell.

In the UK, &quot;Eldorado&quot; is remembered as an embarrassing failure for the BBC, with &quot;The Guardian&quot; billing it &quot;the most famous soap flop of all time&quot;. &quot;Eldorado&quot; is sometimes used as a byword for any unsuccessful, poorly received or over-hyped television programme. It is widely thought that the failure of the soap is the reason why the BBC has not attempted to launch a brand new fully-networked, prime-time soap opera from scratch since then, with the corporation opting instead to move established series &quot;Casualty&quot; and &quot;Holby City&quot; to year-round production.

The series ended with one of its central characters, Marcus Tandy (Jesse Birdsall), escaping an attempt on his life with his car being blown up, and sailing off into the distance on a boat with his girlfriend Pilar Moreno (Sandra Sandri). Some viewers noticed that the car that was blown up was not, in fact, the Renault Alpine A610 driven by Marcus, but a thinly disguised much older model, the Triumph TR7. The final line of dialogue, delivered by Tandy, was: &quot;You can&#x27;t trust anyone these days, can you?&quot;

==Later years==
===Repeat showings===
&quot;Eldorado&quot; was repeated on UK Gold between 1995 and 1996 and again in 2002. Then in July 2021, select episodes of &quot;Eldorado&quot; became available in the UK on BritBox and later ITVX. On 27 January 2025, U&amp;Drama began showing the series.

===The set===
The set, situated near the village of Coín, is still in existence, despite having lain empty for many years. Years following the demise of &quot;Eldorado&quot;, fans were able to tour the set. The set was then converted into a hotel complex called Hotel Ciudad Del Cine (Cinema City Hotel). The hotel continued to allow filming to take place; the set featured in the music video for the single &quot;Nothing on But The Radio&quot; by The Alice Band in 2002. The set has been used for various Spanish television serials both produced and broadcast in the region of Andalucía. The set has also been used for international recordings, including the Indian version of &quot;Fear Factor&quot;, which was shot in the Commercial Plaza. Since the closure of the hotel, the site has been used for airsoft shooting, and continues to be used for productions; it is now known as Ciudad Del Airsoft (Airsoft City). Future plans for the site are to renovate and reopen as a holiday resort. The beach and marina scenes were filmed at Puerto de Cabopino near Marbella.

==Music==
Following their collaboration on &quot;EastEnders&quot;, Julia Smith and Tony Holland commissioned Simon May to write the theme tune. May reworked a song called &quot;When You Go Away&quot; which he had written for his ill-fated musical &quot;Mefisto&quot;, based on Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, adding Spanish guitars to make it more relevant to the &quot;Eldorado&quot; project. An instrumental version of the theme was used for the opening and closing credits. However, the vocal version of the song was recorded by Johnny Griggs and was used over the closing credits of the final episode. &quot;When You Go Away&quot; was released as a single and included on the album &quot;New Vintage: The Best of Simon May&quot;, and the full instrumental version of the theme was included on the compilation album &quot;The Simon May Collection&quot;.

<text>The SeiGHT (pronounced variously as S-8 or &#x27;Sayt&#x27;) is a sports car manufactured as a kit or factory built vehicle by Westfield Sportscars. It is based on the familiar Lotus Seven concept, created by Colin Chapman, whose design philosophy was to strip a car design down to bare essentials for the ultimate in driving experiences. Bar a few visual differences, such as a bonnet bulge to house the large engine, it uses the same widebody chassis as the smaller engined SEi. All SEiGHTs are defined as such by the powerplant - a V8 engine. In kit form they were initially only available from the factory as a rolling chassis, unlike other Westfield kits which can be bought in component form. Later in their production run Westfield would allow the SEiGHT to be purchased in component form allowing customers to fully experience the build.

Westfield ended production of the SEiGHT in December 2010.

== Powerplant ==
The Rover V8 engine powerplant of the SEiGHT ranges from 3.5 litre units originally sourced from the Rover SD1 to bored and stroked 5.2 litre units. There are also 3.9 fuel injected versions, which are currently provided in the factory built vehicles and TVR Power engines of 4.2 litres. On the whole the V8 is a Rover unit, an alloy block which is lighter than the cast iron blocks of many V8s. One example has been built around an alloy version of the Chevrolet small block with a displacement of 6.6 litres.

<doc id="934386" wikidata="Q1932544" url="?curid=934386" title="Real wages">
<text>Real wages are wages adjusted for inflation, or equivalently wages in terms of the amount of goods and services that can be bought. This term is used in contrast to nominal wages or unadjusted wages. Because it has been adjusted to account for changes in the prices of goods and services, real wages provide a clearer representation of an individual&#x27;s wages in terms of what they can afford to buy with those wages – specifically, in terms of the amount of goods and services that can be bought; however, real wages suffer the disadvantage of not being well defined, since the amount of inflation (which can be calculated based on different combinations of goods and services) is itself not well defined. Hence real wage defined as the total amount of goods and services that can be bought with a wage, is also not defined. This is because of changes in the relative prices.

Despite difficulty in defining one value for the real wage, in some cases a real wage can be said to have unequivocally increased. This is true if: After the change, the worker can now afford any bundle of goods and services that they could just barely afford before the change, and still have money left over. In such a situation, real wage increases no matter how inflation is calculated. Specifically, inflation could be calculated based on any good or service or combination thereof, and real wage has still increased. This of course leaves many scenarios where real wage increasing, decreasing or staying the same depends upon how inflation is calculated. These are the scenarios where the worker can buy some of the bundles that they could just barely afford before and still have money left, but at the same time they simply cannot afford some of the bundles that they could before. This happens because some prices change more than others, which means relative prices have changed.

The use of adjusted figures is used in undertaking some forms of economic analysis. For example, to report on the relative economic successes of two nations, real wage figures are more useful than nominal figures. The importance of considering real wages also appears when looking at the history of a single country. If only nominal wages are considered, the conclusion has to be that people used to be significantly poorer than today. However, the cost of living was also much lower. To have an accurate view of a nation&#x27;s wealth in any given year, inflation has to be taken into account and real wages must be used as one measuring stick. There are further limitations in the traditional measures of wages, such as failure to incorporate additional employment benefits, or not adjusting for a changing composition of the overall workforce.

An alternative is to look at how much time it took to earn enough money to buy various items in the past, which is one version of the definition of real wages as the amount of goods or services that can be bought. Such an analysis shows that for most items, it takes much less work time to earn them now than it did decades ago, at least in the United States.

== Example ==

Consider an example economy with the following wages over three years. Also assume that the inflation in this economy is 2% per year:
* Year 1: $20,000
* Year 2: $20,400
* Year 3: $20,808
Real wage = &quot;W&quot;/&quot;i&quot; (&quot;W&quot; = wage, &quot;i&quot; = inflation, can also be subjugated as interest).

If the figures shown are real wages, then wages have increased by 2% after inflation has been taken into account. In effect, an individual making this wage actually has more ability to buy goods and services than the previous year. However, if the figures shown are nominal wages then real wages are not increasing at all. In absolute dollar amounts, an individual is bringing home more money each year, but the increases in inflation actually zeroes out the increases in their salary. Given that inflation is increasing at the same pace as wages, an individual cannot actually afford to increase their consumption in such a scenario.

The nominal wage increases a worker sees in his paycheck may give a misleading impression of whether he is &quot;getting ahead&quot; or &quot;falling behind&quot; over time. For example, the average worker’s paycheck increased 2.7% in 2005, while it increased 2.1% in 2015, creating an impression for some workers that they were &quot;falling behind&quot;. However, inflation was 3.4% in 2005, while it was only 0.1% in 2015, so workers were actually &quot;getting ahead&quot; with lower nominal paycheck increases in 2015 compared to 2005.

== Trends and wage stagnation ==

Historically, the trends of real wages are typically divided into two phases. The first phase, known as the Malthusian phase of history, consists of the period of time before the mass modern economic growth that began around 1800. During this phase, real wages grew very slowly, if at all, since increases in productivity would typically result in equivalent population growth that offset this increased production and left the income per person relatively constant in the long run. The second phase, known as the Solow phase, occurred after 1800 and corresponded with the massive technological and societal improvements brought about by the industrial revolution. In this phase, population growth has been more restrained, and as such real wages have risen much more dramatically with rapid increases in technology and productivity over time.

Following the recession of 2008 real wages globally have stagnated with a world average real wage growth rate of 2% in 2013. Africa, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and Latin America have all experienced real wage growth of under 0.9% in 2013, whilst the developed countries of the OECD have experienced real wage growth of 0.2% in the same period. (Conversely, Asia has consistently experienced strong real wage growth of over 6% from 2006 to 2013.) The International Labour Organisation has stated that wage stagnation has resulted in &quot;a declining share of GDP going to labour while an increasing share goes to capital, especially in developed economies.&quot;

=== United States ===
The Economic Policy Institute stated wages have failed to keep up with productivity in the United States since the mid 1970s, and that wages have therefore stagnated. According to them, between 1973 and 2013, productivity grew 74.4% and hourly compensation grew 9.2%, contradicting the neoclassical economic theory that those two should rise equally together. However, the Heritage Foundation says these claims rest on misinterpreted economic statistics. According to them, productivity grew 100% between 1973 and 2012 while employee compensation, which accounts for worker benefits as well as wages, grew 77%. The Economic Policy Institute and the Heritage Foundation used different inflation adjusting methods in their studies.

Besides rising benefit costs, proposed causes of wage stagnation include the decline of labor unions, loss of job mobility (including through non-competes), and declining employment by the manufacturing sector.

=== Europe ===
The countries of Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom have experienced strong real wage growth following European integration in the early 1980s.[6] However, according to OECD between 2007 and 2015 the United Kingdom saw a real wage decline of 10.4%, equal only to Greece.

A 2014 study argued that wages now respond more strongly to changes in unemployment rates. It documented how the UK&#x27;s 1979 - 2010 real wage growth across deciles has stagnated since 2003. Its models found that pre-2003, a doubling of the unemployment rate saw median wages fall 7%, but now the same doubling sees a fall of 12%.

A 2018 paper contended that a major source of wage stagnation is underemployment. It studied the OECD with a focus on the UK, finding that unemployment rates often returned to 2007&#x27;s pre-great recession levels. However, 2017 underemployment rates in many countries were still worse than 2007. So it argues that the low unemployment rates hide continued &quot;labour market slack&quot;: its models found underemployment was negatively related to wages both in the UK and other countries.

<text>Matarraña () or Matarranya () is a comarca in eastern Aragon, bordering the Spanish Autonomous Communities of Catalonia and Valencia. It is located in Teruel Province, in the mountainous Sistema Ibérico area.

Its capital is Valderrobres, and it borders the Aragonese comarques of Bajo Aragón-Caspe/Baix Aragó-Casp, and Bajo Aragón, the Catalan comarques of Terra Alta, Baix Ebre, and Montsià, and the Valencian comarques of Baix Maestrat and Ports.

This comarca is named after the Matarranya River flowing through it. It belongs to the Catalan-speaking strip in eastern Aragon known as La Franja.

==Historical comarca==

The historical Matarranya comarca was a natural region that roughly encompassed the whole Matarranya river basin. The historical comarca was split for administrative purposes when provincial boundaries were traced following the territorial division of Spain in 1833.

After the new divisions were created, the northern section, the Lower Matarranya, became part of the Zaragoza Province while the southern part remained in Teruel Province.
This former northern territory, that included the municipalities of Fayón (Faió del Matarranya), Maella and Fabara (Favara del Matarranya), is now the eastern end of the Bajo Aragón-Caspe/Baix Aragó-Casp comarca.

Some of the western municipalities that remained in Teruel Province, Aguaviva (Aiguaviva de Bergantes), Belmonte de San José (Bellmunt de Mesquí), La Cañada de Verich (La Canyada de Beric), La Cerollera (La Sorollera), La Codoñera (La Codonyera), La Ginebrosa and Torrevelilla (La Torre de Vilella) were later segregated from Matarranya and included in the Bajo Aragón comarca.

<text>Kis-Küküllő was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. Its territory is now in central Romania (central Transylvania). Kis-Küküllő is the Hungarian name for the river Târnava Mică. The capital of the county was &quot;Dicsőszentmárton&quot; (now Târnăveni).

==Geography==

Kis-Küküllő county shared borders with the Hungarian counties Alsó-Fehér, Torda-Aranyos, Maros-Torda, Udvarhely, and Nagy-Küküllő. The river Mureș formed part of its northern border, the river Târnava Mare its southern border. The Târnava Mică River flowed through the county. Its area was around 1910.

==History==
Kis-Küküllő County came into existence in 1876, when the administrative structure of Transylvania was changed and Küküllő County was split. In 1920, by the Treaty of Trianon, the county became part of the Kingdom of Romania. After the Second Vienna Award, a little part of the former county became part of Hungary again and was assigned to the recreated Maros-Torda County. Its territory lies in the present Romanian counties Mureș (around Târnăveni), Alba (the south-west), and Sibiu (the south, around Dumbrăveni).

==Subdivisions==

In the early 20th century, the subdivisions of Kis-Küküllő County were:

<doc id="934403" wikidata="Q15579" url="?curid=934403" title="La Franja">
<text>La Franja (; &quot;The Strip&quot;; ) is the area of Catalan-speaking territories of eastern Aragon bordering Catalonia, in Spain. It literally means &quot;the strip&quot; and can also more properly be called (Aragonese Strip), (Western Strip) or (Eastern Strip of Aragon) in Catalan (in , &quot;Eastern Strip of Aragon&quot;; or simply /, &quot;Eastern Strip&quot;, or , &quot;Aragonese Strip&quot;; in , &quot;Aragonese Strip&quot;).

&quot;La Franja&quot; is usually considered to be comprised by a part of the municipalities of the following Aragonese administrative &quot;comarcas&quot;: la Ribagorza/Ribagorça, La Litera/La Llitera, Bajo Cinca/Baix Cinca, Bajo Aragón-Caspe/Baix Aragó-Casp, Bajo Aragón/Baix Aragó and Matarraña/Matarranya.

&quot;La Franja&quot; has been part of Aragon since the medieval kingdom of Aragon; never in its history has it been part of Catalonia; however its population speaks in Catalan, presumably since the Middle Ages; consequently this territory is considered a part of the so-called Catalan Countries.

Among the territories where Catalan is spoken (Catalonia, the Valencian Community, the Balearic Islands, Andorra and Roussillon, among some other little territories), &quot;La Franja&quot; is currently the one where oral knowledge of Catalan is the most universal; this is due to low immigration to the area compared to the other ones. Roughly 80% of adults can speak Catalan. In all of Aragon there are 55,513 speakers of Catalan, according to census data.

The thin strip of land is very diverse geographically, ranging from valleys in the Pyrenees to the flat lands by the Ebro; all are included under this umbrella term. &quot;La Franja&quot; does not have any official political recognition within Aragon, nor is it a separate historical entity in and of itself; the territories only have in common being administratively and historically Aragonese and linguistically Catalan. The term is mostly used in the neighbouring Catalonia, especially by Catalan nationalists, though it has lately become common in Aragon too. Some right-wing political forces in Aragon prefer not to use the word &quot;Catalan&quot; when speaking of the language of eastern Aragon, and have used a number of alternative names for it, even in the Language Act of Aragon of 2013.

==Origin of the names that refer to &quot;La Franja&quot;==
The use of a term to refer to the eastern area of Aragon bordering Catalonia as based on linguistic criteria is recent. It was in 1929—when he christened these as &quot;Marques de Ponent&quot;, &quot;Western Marches&quot;—that Catalan geographer Pau Vila used for the first time a term designating jointly the Aragonese area where Catalan is spoken.

This term was maintained in the second half of the 20th century by Catalan linguists such as Joan Giraldo, along with other terms such as &quot;Marques d&#x27;Aragó&quot; (in Spanish, &quot;Marcas de Aragón&quot;, &quot;Marches of Aragon&quot;), &quot;Catalunya aragonesa&quot; (in Spanish, &quot;Cataluña aragonesa&quot;, &quot;Aragonese Catalonia&quot;) or &quot;la ratlla d&#x27;Aragó&quot; (in Spanish, &quot;la raya de Aragón&quot;, &quot;the Aragonese Strip&quot;).

Whichever term is used, they all refer to the eastern Catalan-speaking area of Aragon, which borders western Catalonia. These terms all originated in Catalonia but later became popular in La Franja itself. They are therefore Catalonia-centered and hence the &quot;Ponent&quot; (&quot;Western&quot;) reference in the term &quot;La Franja del Ponent&quot;, because these areas lie to the west of Catalonia.

The term &quot;Franja de Ponent&quot; itself first appeared in the second half of the 1970s, during the Spanish transition to democracy:

At the Second International Congress of the Catalan Language (&quot;Segon Congrés Internacional de la Llengua Catalana&quot;) held in 1985, the normative authority on the Catalan language, known as &quot;Institut d&#x27;Estudis Catalans&quot;, adopted &quot;Franja d&#x27;Aragó&quot; (&quot;Aragonese Strip&quot;) as the denomination for the Catalan-speaking territories of Aragon for academic and linguistic purposes, while the denomination &quot;Franja de Ponent&quot; (&quot;Western Strip&quot;) is used mainly in the political arena by some associations, groups and political parties associated with pancatalanism.

Later on, alternative denominations such as &quot;Aragón Oriental&quot; (in Catalan, &quot;Aragó Oriental&quot;), &quot;Franja Oriental&quot; or &quot;Franja de Levante&quot; (in Catalan, &quot;Franja de Llevant&quot;), all meaning roughly Eastern Aragon or Eastern Strip were created in Aragon.
== Diverse meanings ==
While the term was created to designate a linguistic area, there are other issues in question:

*The ecclesiastical sense
*The linguistic sense
*The political sense
*The socioeconomic sense

=== Ecclesiastical sense===
Many parishes of what is now called &quot;la Franja&quot; had been historically part of the Diocese of Lleida, along with other, non-Catalan-speaking Aragonese towns. In 1995, Catholic church authorities, through the Papal Nuncio to Spain, informed the president of the Spanish Episcopal Conference –Archbishop of Saragossa, Elías Yanes– of the decision of the Holy See to align the diocesan boundaries with the political and historical ones.

This meant that 111 parishes and a population of 68,089 were transferred from the Diocese of Lleida to the enlarged Diocese of Barbastro, whose name was then changed to Diocese of Barbastro-Monzón As for the reasons of the transfer, some Catalan ecclesiastical ranks considered that it was a result of the opposition of these Aragonese parishes to a short-lived debate on the convenience of creating a distinct Catalan Episcopal Conference, which would have been detached from the Spanish one. Other sources claim that the diocese of Barbastro—birthplace of the founder of Opus Dei, Josepmaria Escrivà de Balaguer—was losing population and needed to acquire neighbouring parishes from another diocese to be able to continue to exist.

The transfer of the parishes, specifically the ownership of the medieval artistic objects or sacred art comprised, originated an intricate series of lawsuits involving both dioceses (Barbastro-Monzón and Lleida), both autonomous governments (Aragón and Catalonia) and both legal systems canon and administrative law.

It was finally decided by the ecclesiastic canon judges in 2005 that the 113 works of art belong to the Barbastro-Monzón diocese. The Lleida diocese released a statement accepting this decision but, at the same time, announced that then the administrative process would be opened, later on, it stated that talks should be opened to reach an agreement, in the end effectively protracting the end of the dispute. In the meantime, the works of art remain located in the Diocese Museum of Lleida. The lawsuit is known as the &quot;conflicto del patrimonio eclesiástico de la Franja&quot; (the conflict of the ecclesiastical heritage of the Franja) or &quot;del Aragón Oriental&quot; (of Eastern Aragon), and though it began as a local debate, it has become a national press story, especially due to the confrontation between the political forces of Aragon and Catalonia.

On July 1, 2008 an agreement between the two dioceses was announced, again stating that the art pieces would return to the Barbastro-Monzón diocese. However, the situation remained stalled due to the continued refusal of the Catalan administration to issue an exit permit, something which eventually led to the Aragonese region president to open a criminal procedure in February 2009, thus effectively giving up on the resolved yet stalled civil procedure. Then the Vatican itself urged the return of the pieces to Aragon, to no avail.

=== Linguistic sense===
The Catalan language is spoken by a significant proportion of the population of La Franja (47.1% of the population uses it as their usual language according to a survey by the Aragonese Institute of Statistics in 2013; percentage that rises to 73.6%-90% according to two surveys carried out with a smaller territorial scope also in 2013 by the Generalitat of Catalonia) This despite the fact that it is not an official language and has a very limited presence in education (where it is only available as an elective) and in administration and or public acts, resulting in severe deficiencies in writing skills of this language. 

==== Territorial basis ====
The exact territorial limits of the &quot;Franja de Aragón&quot; differ depending on the source, since there are some municipalities of Ribagorza where there are doubts over whether or not to include them as Catalan-speaking or as Aragonese-speaking. The proportion of speakers of the two languages varies over time and with immigration according to the municipality, something which leads to different sources drawing slightly different linguistic borders.

==== According to the draft of the Aragonese Language Law ====
During the fourth session of the &quot;Cortes de Aragón&quot; (the parliament of Aragon) (1995–1999) under the PP-PAR coalition government the Special Commission Report on the Language Policy of Aragon was published. The report would be the basis for the Draft of the Language Law of Aragon published the following session (1999–2003) under the PSOE-PAR coalition, where for the first time from the &quot;Cortes de Aragón&quot; would detail those municipalities which formed part of a Catalan-speaking community, with the aim of recognising co-officiality and encouraging the use of Catalan in public life and especially in education.

The law was never approved due to protests and petitions in Aragon opposed to the co-officiality of Catalan, promoted mainly by the &quot;Federación de Asociaciones Culturales del Aragón Oriental&quot; (FACAO), a conservative organisation which maintained that the local &#x27;linguistic modalities&#x27; were languages and not dialects of Catalan, and there was lack of consensus on the issue among the Aragonese political parties. There are other civic associations staunchly rejecting the Catalan affiliation of the language

According to the &quot;list of municipalities which could be considered to be areas of predominant use of its own language or linguistic modality or areas of predominant use of normalised Catalan&quot; in the &quot;Second annex of the Second Final Disposition of the Avant-project of the Language Law&quot;, La Franja would be composed of:

==== According to the Institut d&#x27;Estudis Catalans ====
From the point of view of the Institut d&#x27;Estudis Catalans the territory is smaller, due to the fact that the municipality of Torre la Ribera is not considered Catalan-speaking, and the municipalities of Azanuy-Alins, Isábena, Lascuarre and San Esteban de Litera are classified as transitional dialects. The Catalan-speaking lands are thus reduced to a total of 57 municipalities with an area of 4,137.2 km2 with a population of 45,984.

==== According to the Gran Enciclopedia Aragonesa ====
The situation is reversed according to the Gran Enciclopedia Aragonesa (GEA) with the Franja having an area of 5,370 km2 and with a population of 70,000. It should be mentioned that the GEA does not recognise the denomination &quot;Franja&quot; but discusses its situation under &quot;Catalan in Aragon&quot;, nor does it specify in how many or which municipalities Catalan is definitively spoken nor the date of the census on which its figures are based.

==== According to the &quot;Gran Geografia Comarcal&quot; of the GREC ====
The &quot;Gran Geografia Comarcal&quot; of the Grup Enciclopèdia Catalana (GREC) classes the territorial area of the Franja de Aragon as larger than that defined by the Commission report although not as large as the GEA definition. All the municipalities which it adds to those of the Avant-project and of Ribagorza and therefore belong to the Province of Huesca. It adds a total of eight municipalities and three population nuclei; Güell, Laguarres y Torres del Obispo, which form part of two municipalities; Graus in the case of the first and the third, and Capella the case of the second. The table to the right details the population nuclei and official area and population figures.

==== Comparative table and map according to sources ====
==== Toponymy ====

There is no unitary policy on official toponymy in the Franja, leading to great variations between the local &quot;comarcalización&quot; laws as compared to those proposed by the IEC. The following table details the translation of the toponymy in Spanish to the official version in the local vernacular and that proposed by the IEC. At the bottom are the municipalities which the GREC includes in its definition of the Franja and the proposed names which it offers opposed to the official names:

=== Political sense===
The political significance of La Franja goes hand in hand with the Catalan nationalist political movement, which considers this part of Aragon (and even all other Catalan-speaking territories) to be part of the Catalan nation, because of its language.

This new interpretation as part of the political connotation ascribed to the Catalan Countries emerged throughout the 20th century—and especially after the 1960s—encouraged in the main part by the Valencian Joan Fuster. Pan-Catalanism demands the creation of a nation-state for the Catalan Countries in which the cultural unity is based on the Catalan linguistic community.

In the Franja itself, there has never been a political movement promoting union with Catalonia or separation from Aragon. On the other hand, Catalan political parties do not participate in municipal or regional elections in the area.

=== Socioeconomic sense===
The socioeconomic meaning of the Franja relates to the economic region surrounding the Catalan city of Lleida, which encompasses Catalan-speaking Huescan and Zaragozan municipalities and excludes those in the region of Teruel and includes Spanish-speaking municipalities such as Alcolea de Cinca, Binéfar, and Monzón.The area of influence of Lleida is especially reflected in editions of the local Lleida press for example La Mañana-Franja de Ponent and also of Aragon as shown by the digital publication Franja Digital.

<text>The giant eland (Taurotragus derbianus), also known as the Lord Derby&#x27;s eland and greater eland, is an open-forest and savanna antelope. A species of the family Bovidae and genus &quot;Taurotragus&quot;, it was described in 1847 by John Edward Gray. The giant eland is the largest species of antelope, with a body length ranging from . There are two subspecies: &quot;T. d. derbianus&quot; and &quot;T. d. gigas&quot;.

The giant eland is a herbivore, eating grasses, foliage and branches. They usually form small herds consisting of 15–25 members, both males and females. Giant elands are not territorial, and have large home ranges. They are naturally alert and wary, which makes them difficult to approach and observe. They can run at up to and use this speed as a defence against predators. Mating occurs throughout the year but peaks in the wet season. They mostly inhabit broad-leafed savannas, woodlands and glades.

The giant eland is native to Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Mali, Senegal, and South Sudan. It is no longer present in The Gambia, Ghana, Ivory Coast, and Togo. It can also be found in the Jos wildlife park in Nigeria, Guinea-Bissau, and Uganda. The subspecies have been listed with different conservation statuses by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

==Etymology==
The scientific name of the giant eland is &quot;Taurotragus derbianus&quot;, derived from three words: &quot;tauros&quot;, &quot;tragos&quot;, and &quot;derbianus&quot;. &quot;Tauros&quot; is Greek for a bull or bullock. &quot;Tragos&quot; is Greek for a male goat, and refers to the tuft of hair that grows in the eland&#x27;s ear which resembles a goat&#x27;s beard.

The giant eland is also called &quot;Lord Derby&#x27;s eland&quot; in honour of Edward Smith-Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby. It was due to his efforts that the giant eland was first introduced to England between 1835 and 1851. Lord Derby sent botanist Joseph Burke to collect animals, either alive or dead, from South Africa for his museum and menagerie. The first elands introduced in England were a pair of common elands, and what would later be identified as a giant eland bull. The details were recorded in Smith-Stanley&#x27;s privately printed work, &quot;Gleanings from the Menagerie at Knowsley Hall&quot;. The Latin name indicates that it &quot;belonged to&quot; (given by the suffix -&quot;anus&quot;) Derby, hence &quot;derbianus&quot;.

Although the giant eland is somewhat larger than the common eland, the epithet &#x27;giant&#x27; actually refers to its large horns. The name &#x27;eland&#x27; is Dutch for &quot;elk&quot; or &quot;moose&quot;. It has a Baltic source similar to the Lithuanian &quot;élnis&quot;, which means &quot;deer&quot;. It was borrowed earlier as &quot;ellan&quot; (French) in the 1610s or &quot;elend&quot; (German).

==Taxonomy==

The giant eland was first described in 1847 by John Edward Gray, a British zoologist, who called it &quot;Boselaphus derbianus&quot;. At that time, it was also called the &#x27;black-necked eland&#x27; and &quot;Gingi-ganga&quot;.

Giant eland is placed in the genus &quot;Taurotragus&quot; of family Bovidae. Giant elands are sometimes considered part of the genus &quot;Tragelaphus&quot; on the basis of molecular phylogenetics, but are usually categorized as &quot;Taurotragus&quot;, along with the common eland (&quot;T. oryx&quot;). Together with the bongo, Giant eland and common eland are the only antelopes in the tribe &quot;Tragelaphini&quot; to be given a generic name other than &quot;Tragelaphus&quot;. Although some authors, like Theodor Haltenorth, regarded the giant eland as conspecific with the common eland, they are usually considered two distinct species.

Two subspecies of giant eland have been recognized:
==Description==

The giant elands are spiral-horned antelopes. Despite its common name, this species broadly overlaps in size with the common eland (&quot;Taurotragus oryx&quot;). However, the giant eland is somewhat larger on average than the common eland and is thus the largest species of antelope in the world. They are typically between in head-and-body length and stand approximately at the shoulder. Giant elands exhibit sexual dimorphism, as males are larger than females. The males weigh and females weigh . The tail is long, having a dark tuft of hair, and averages in length. The life expectancy of giant elands is up to 25 years.

The smooth coat is reddish-brown to chestnut, usually darker in males than females, with 8–12 well-defined vertical white stripes on the torso. The colour of the male&#x27;s coat darkens with age. According to zoologist Jakob Bro-Jørgensen, the colour of the male&#x27;s coat can reflect the levels of androgen, a male hormone, which is highest during rutting. Comparing the subspecies, &quot;T. d. derbianus&quot; is characterised by 15 body stripes, smaller size, and a rufous colour, while &quot;T. d. gigas&quot; is larger, a sandy colour, and has 12 body stripes.

A crest of short black hair extends down the neck to the middle of the back, and is particularly prominent on the shoulders. The slender legs are slightly lighter on their inner surfaces, with black and white markings just above the hooves. There are large black spots on the upper forelegs. The bridge of the nose is charcoal black, and there is a thin, indistinct tan-coloured line, which is the chevron, between the eyes. The lips are white, as are several dots along the jawline. A pendulous dewlap, larger in males than females, originates from between the jowls and hangs to the upper chest when they reach sexual maturity, with a fringe of hair on its edge. The large ears of the giant eland serve as signaling devices. Giant elands have comparatively longer legs than the common eland, as well as much brighter black and white markings on the legs and pasterns.

Both sexes have tightly spiraled, V-shaped horns. They can be up to long on males and on females. Males have horns that are thicker at the ends, longer, and more divergent than those of females. These features of the horns suggest that the giant eland evolved from an ancestor with true display horns.

===Parasites===
Fecal studies of the western giant eland revealed the presence of a newly found species &quot;Eimeria derbani&quot;, of genus &quot;Eimeria&quot;, which consists of Apicomplexan parasites. The sporulation lasted for two days at a temperature of . The species has been differentiated from &quot;E. canna&quot; and &quot;E. triffittae&quot;, which parasitize the common eland (&quot;T. oryx&quot;). The giant eland is also parasitised by &quot;Carmyerius spatiosus&quot; (a trematode species), &quot;Taenia crocutae&quot; and &quot;T. hyaennae&quot; (two tapeworm species).

==Genetics and evolution==
The giant eland has 31 male chromosomes and 32 female chromosomes. In a 2008 phylogenomic study of spiral-horned antelopes, chromosomal similarities were observed between cattle (&quot;Bos taurus&quot;) and eight species of spiral-horned antelopes, namely: nyala (&quot;Tragelaphus angasii&quot;), lesser kudu (&quot;T. imberbis&quot;), bongo (&quot;T. eurycerus&quot;), bushbuck (&quot;T. scriptus&quot;), greater kudu (&quot;T. strepsiceros&quot;), sitatunga (&quot;T. spekei&quot;), giant eland and common eland (&quot;T. oryx&quot;). It was found that chromosomes involved in centric fusions in these species used a complete set of cattle painting probes generated by laser microdissection. The study confirmed the presence of the chromosome translocation known as Robertsonian translocation (1;29), a widespread evolutionary marker common to all known tragelaphid species.

An accidental mating between a male giant eland and a female kudu produced a male offspring, but it was azoospermic. Analysis showed that it completely lacked germ cells, which produce gametes. Still, the hybrid had a strong male scent and exhibited male behaviour. Chromosomal examination showed that chromosomes 1, 3, 5, 9, and 11 differed from the parental karyotypes. Notable mixed inherited traits were pointed ears like the eland&#x27;s, but a bit widened like kudu&#x27;s. The tail was half the length of that of an eland with a tuft of hair at the end as in kudu.

Previous genetic studies of African savanna ungulates revealed the presence of a long-standing Pleistocene refugium in eastern and southern Africa, which also includes the giant eland. The common eland and giant eland have been estimated to have diverged about 1.6 million years ago.

==Habitat and distribution==
Giant elands live in the broad-leafed savanna, woodlands, and glades of central and western Africa, which correspond to the two subspecies. They also live in forests as well as on the fringes of deserts. The giant elands can also live in deserts, as they produce very dry dung. They are found in South Sudan and Central African Republic into northern Cameroon and southern Chad.

They inhabit places near hilly or rocky landscapes and those with water sources nearby. Science author Jonathan Kingdon had thought the giant elands lived only in woodlands of &quot;Isoberlinia doka&quot;, an African hardwood tree. The giant eland is adapted to these broad-leafed, deciduous &quot;Isoberlinia&quot; woodlands. Recent studies proved that they also inhabit woodlands with trees of the genera &quot;Terminalia&quot;, &quot;Combretum&quot;, and &quot;Afzelia&quot;.

In the past, giant elands occurred throughout the relatively narrow belt of savanna woodland that extends across West and Central Africa from Senegal to the Nile. Today they are conserved in national parks and reserves, and occur mostly in Senegal. The western giant eland is largely restricted to Niokolo-Koba National Park in Senegal. The eastern giant eland is found in several reserves, for example in Bénoué National Park, Faro National Park and Bouba Njida National Park in Cameroon and in Manovo-Gounda St. Floris National Park in the Central African Republic. They are also kept in captivity.

==Ecology and behaviour==
Primarily nocturnal, giant elands have large home ranges and seasonal migration patterns. They form separate groups of males and of females and juveniles. Adult males mainly remain alone, and often spend time with females for an hour to a week. A gregarious species, giant eland herds usually consist of 15–25 animals (sometimes even more) and do not disband during the wet season, suggesting that social rather than ecological factors are responsible for herding. During the day, herds often rest in sheltered areas. As many other animals do, giant elands scrape mineral lick sites with the help of horns to loosen soil.

Giant elands are alert and wary, making them difficult to approach and observe or to hunt. If a bull senses danger, he will give deep-throated barks while leaving the herd, repeating the process until the whole herd is aware of the danger. Giant elands can move quickly, running at over , and despite their size are exceptional jumpers, easily clearing heights of . Their primary predators are the lion, nile crocodile and spotted hyena, while young, sickly and a rare adult may be vulnerable to leopards, cheetahs and African wild dogs. Due to their large size, they prove a good meal for the predators. However, they are not easily taken by any predator, especially the heavier and larger horned bulls which can be a dangerous adversary even for a lion pride.

===Diet===

Primarily a herbivore, the giant eland eats grasses and foliage, as well as other parts of a plant. In the rainy season, they browse in herds and feed on grasses. They can eat coarse, dry grass and weeds if nothing else is available. They eat fruits too, such as plums. A study in South Africa showed that an eland&#x27;s diet consists of 75% shrubs and 25% grasses, with highly varying proportions. They often use their long horns to break off branches.

As they need a regular intake of water in their diet, they prefer living in places with a nearby water source. However, some adaptations they possess help them to survive even in the lack of water by maintaining a sufficient quantity of it in their body. They produce very dry dung compared to domestic cattle. In deserts, they can get their required water from the moisture of succulent plants. Another way in which they conserve water is by resting in the day and feeding at night, so that they minimize the water quantity required to cool themselves.

Several studies have investigated the eland&#x27;s diet. A study of giant elands in the Bandia Natural reserve in Senegal revealed that the most important and most preferred plants were various species of &quot;Acacia&quot;, &quot;Terminalia&quot; and &quot;Combretum&quot;, along with &quot;Azadirachta indica&quot;, &quot;Daniellia oliveri&quot;, &quot;Gymnosporia senegalensis&quot;, &quot;Philenoptera laxiflora&quot; (syn. &quot;Lonchocarpus laxiflorus&quot;), &quot;Prosopis africana&quot;, &quot;Pterocarpus erinaceus&quot;, &quot;Saba senegalensis&quot; and pods of &quot;Piliostigma thonningii&quot;. Another study in Sudan showed that western giant elands preferred &quot;Cassia tora&quot;, which was the most abundant legume in the region.

In 2010, histological analysis of the feces of South African western giant elands was done in the Niokolo-Koba National Park and in the Bandia National Reserve. In both studies leaves, shoots of woody plants, and fruits were found to be the three major components. The other components that appeared in minor proportions were forbs and grasses, generally below five percent of the mean fecal volume. They were seen eating most foliage from &quot;Boscia angustifolia&quot;, &quot;Grewia bicolor&quot;, &quot;Hymenocardia acida&quot;, and &quot;Ziziphus mauritiana&quot;, and the fruits of &quot;Acacia&quot; and &quot;Strychnos spinosa&quot;. In the Bandia Reserve, differences in diet were marked among age classes. The conclusions were that in the dry season the eland was a pure browser, consuming grasses in small amounts.

===Reproduction===

Mating occurs throughout the year, but peaks in the wet season. Females reach sexual maturity at about two years, and males at four to five years. A female can remain in estrus for three days, and the estrous cycle is 21–26 days long. As in all antelopes, mating occurs at a time of food abundance. In some areas distinct breeding seasons exist. In southern Africa, females have been seen giving birth from August to October, and are joined by the males from late October to January. In Zambia calves are born in July and August.

Fights occur for dominance, in which the bulls lock horns and try to twist the necks of their opponents. As an act during rut, the males rub their foreheads in fresh urine or mud. They also use their horns to thresh and throw loose earth on themselves. The horns of older males get worn out due to rubbing them on tree barks. Expressions of anger are not typically observed. Dominant males may mate with multiple females. The courtship is brief, consisting of a penetration and one ejaculatory thrust.

After the courtship, the gestational period begins, which is of nine months duration. The delivery usually takes place in the night, after which the mother ingests the afterbirth. Generally one calf is delivered, and it remains with its mother for six months. Lactation can last for four to five months. After the first six months the young eland might join a group of other juveniles.

A Senegalese study focused on the suckling behaviour of giant eland and common eland calves about one to five months old determined that suckling bouts increased with the age of the calves. No other change occurred in the farmed common eland calves, but in the giant eland calves, the males were found to suckle more than female ones and shorter suckling bouts were marked in primiparous mothers than multiparous ones. The results suggest that Derby elands that lived in their natural habitat adjusted their maternal behaviour so as to be able to readily maintain a vigilant lookout for predators and other similar risks. In contrast, the farmed common elands behaved as in the conditions of captivity, without predators.

==Populations==
The eastern giant eland ranged from Nigeria, through Cameroon, Chad, the Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire) to Sudan and Uganda in 1980. But the rinderpest outbreak (1983–1984) caused a devastating 60–80% decline in the populations. The eastern giant eland is still found in extensive areas, though it has a decreasing population trend. Because of this, it is listed as &#x27;Vulnerable&#x27; by the IUCN. It has many uninhabited habitats that are not expected to be occupied for human settlement, particularly in northern and eastern Central African Republic and south-western Sudan, where their population has notably increased. According to Rod East, 15,000 eastern giant elands existed as of 1999, of which 12,500 are in Central African Republic. The remaining areas are often disturbed by wars and conflicts—activities that can lead to a rapid decline in the eastern giant eland&#x27;s numbers if not controlled.

The western giant eland is in a more dangerous situation, being listed as &#x27;Critically Endangered&#x27; by the IUCN. Today they mostly occur in Senegal. In 1990, populations were about 1000, of which 700 to 800 were found in the Niokolo-Koba National Park and the rest in the region around the Falémé River. As of 2008, a population of less than 200 individuals occur there, and only a few elands exist in neighboring countries.

A study of the long-term conservation strategy of the western giant eland was done in the Bandia and Fathala reserves, using demographic and pedigree data based on continuous monitoring of reproduction during 2000 to 2009. In 2009, the semi-captive population was 54 individuals (26 males, 28 females). The female breeding probability was 84%, and the annual population growth was 1.36. With more population, the elands were divided into five groups for observation. Although the mean interbreeding level became 0.119, a potential gene diversity (GD) of 92% was retained. The authors concluded that with the introduction of new founders, the GD could be greatly improved in the next 100 years, and suggested that with proper management of the semi-captive population, the numbers of the western giant eland could be increased.

==Interaction with humans==
===Threats and conservation===

The major threats to the western giant eland population are overhunting for its rich meat and habitat destruction caused by the expansion of human and livestock populations. The eastern giant eland is also depleting for similar reasons, and natural causes like continued droughts and competition from domestic animals are contributing to the reduction in numbers. Populations of the eastern giant eland had already gone down due to the rinderpest attacks. The situation was worse during World War II and other civil wars and political conflicts that harmed their natural habitats.

The giant eland is already extirpated in The Gambia, Ghana, Ivory Coast, and Togo. The western giant eland was once reported in Togo, but is believed to have been confused with the bongo (&quot;Tragalephaus eurycerus&quot;). In 1970, it was reported eliminated in Uganda, during military operations. Its presence is uncertain in Guinea-Bissau and Nigeria.

Today the western giant eland is conserved in the Niokolo-Koba National Park and the Faheme Hunting Zone in Senegal. Field studies have proven that the Niokolo-Koba National Park is ecologically suitable for the giant eland. As observed in the 2000 census of the park, the number of deaths in a decade were only 90 to 150.

The eastern giant eland is conserved in the Faro National Park, Bénoué National Park, Bouba Njida National Park, Bamingui-Bangoran National Park and Manovo-Gounda St. Floris National Park. They are bred in captivity in the Bandia Reserve and Fathala Reserve in Senegal, and at White Oak Conservation in Yulee, Florida, United States. Eland born at White Oak have been sent to other countries, including Costa Rica and South Africa, to initiate breeding programs.

===Uses===
Giant elands give large quantities of tender meat and high-quality hides even if fed a low-quality diet. These are game animals and are also hunted for trophies. Their milk is comparatively richer in proteins and milkfat than dairy cows, which may be an explanation for the quick growth of eland calves. Eland&#x27;s milk has about triple the fat content and twice the protein of a dairy cow&#x27;s milk. Its docility and profitable characteristics have made it a target of domestication in Africa and Russia and has also resulted in hunting.

Many people prefer to tame and raise eland rather than cattle due to their numerous benefits. Elands can survive on scarce water, which is a great advantage over domestic cattle. They can also eat coarse grasses, and can even manage to ingest some poisonous plants that can prove fatal for cattle. They are also immune to some diseases to which cattle may succumb.

<text>Nagy-Küküllő () was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. Its territory is now in central Romania (central Transylvania). Nagy-Küküllő is the Hungarian name for the river Târnava Mare. The capital of the county was Segesvár (present-day Sighișoara).

==Geography==

Nagy-Küküllő County shared borders with the Hungarian counties Alsó-Fehér, Kis-Küküllő, Udvarhely, Háromszék, Brassó, Fogaras, and Szeben. The river Târnava Mare formed part of its northern border and the river Olt part of its southern border. Its area was around 1910.

==History==
Nagy-Küküllő County came into existence in 1876, when the administrative structure of Transylvania was changed and Küküllő County was split. In 1920, by the Treaty of Trianon, the county became part of Romania. Its territory lies in the present Romanian counties Sibiu (the west), Brașov (the south-east), and Mureș (around Sighișoara).

<text>Clay Cross is a town and a civil parish in the North East Derbyshire district of Derbyshire, England. It is a former industrial and mining town, about south of Chesterfield. 
It is directly on the A61. Surrounding settlements include North Wingfield, Tupton, Pilsley and Ashover.

==History==
The High Street was built over a pre-dating Roman road, that may have been called Rykneild Street, where a tollhouse (1786-1876) was situated. The discovery of coal in the area introduced the village to the Industrial Revolution. Packhorses at first transported the &#x27;blackgold&#x27; over the Peaks on a turnpike road opened in 1756 between the iron foundries of Derby and Sheffield. Until the early 19th century, Clay Cross was a small village known as Clay Lane, but increasing demand for coal and other minerals trebled the population by 1840 , the oldest building being the George and Dragon Inn. While driving the tunnel for the North Midland Railway, George Stephenson discovered both coal and iron, which together with the demand for limestone, caused him to move into Tapton Hall, near Chesterfield, and set up business as George Stephenson and Co.

A map of 1833 showed Thanet Street and Clay Lane. The railway &#x27;mania&#x27; of 1840s witnessed expansion northwards facilitated by the Clay Cross tunnel dug in 1837–38. Whilst tunnelling over a mile underground they discovered vast quantities of commercial grade coal. Clay Cross became a boom town. The &#x27;Liverpool Party&#x27; of Stephenson engineers formed the Clay Cross Company in 1839 which they funded from their considerable resources. As well as sinking a number of shafts with colliery support, there were coke oven works, brickworks, limeworks, irons furnaces and foundry. The ductile pipe was developed into an internationally sold product, making Clay Cross renowned for its iron and coal industry worldwide. Although the company had been formed to mine coal and manufacture coke from the railway, the supplies from Durham were preferred, and the works turned to iron working and brick making. When Stephenson died in 1848 his son, Robert, took over, leaving the company in 1852 when it became formally known by the name of the Clay Cross Company. In 1871 the Jackson family acquired 100% of the stocks and shares. They continued as owners until 1974. For many years, the company was the town&#x27;s major employer. In 1985 Biwater took it over. In December 2000 Biwater sold the site to French company, Saint-Gobain. Some months later, it was closed down with the loss of around 750 jobs. Demolition of the vast Biwater site began in late 2008, and new houses and shops are appearing in the town.

In 1925 the Ashover Light Railway was opened to transport minerals from the quarries at Ashover Butts to the Clay Cross Company at Egstow. The passenger services on the narrow gauge line were closed in 1936 and the mineral traffic ceased in 1950.

===Industrial architecture===
In 1840 the Stephensons built Eldon House as its office headquarters, which latterly was converted into a private dwelling-house. The Stephensons also built more than 400 miners&#x27; cottages. In addition they set up elementary schools and consecrated new churches. The company provided the town with almost all its energy needs in gas and electricity. The largest house Clay Cross Hall was built in 1845 for the company&#x27;s General Manager Charles Binns. Stephenson&#x27;s workers&#x27; houses were of high quality for their time, having four rooms compared to the normal two. By 1850, there were three chapels, a church and an institute - but no constable. One such construction of 1847 was the Wesleyan Chapel in use until at least 1900 on Holmgate Road. They also provided a company bowling green with a clubhouse. A Mechanics Institute was opened which was handed over to the Clay Lane Urban Districts School Board in 1893. The Board&#x27;s Senior School for Boys was opened in 1884, converted to a junior school in the 1930s and still teaches in 2015. During the late Victorian era middle class villa style houses were also built in a new part of the town.

Colliery owner Thomas Houldsworth, also a churchwarden for 25 years, built Alma House which stood in extensive parklands. The house was surrounded by railings and flat roof of indeterminate date. He was responsible developer of Clay Cross pits until 1850, and then the Alma Colliery in North Wingfield, after the Crimean War.

Springfield House was built by the Clay Cross Company for engineer William Howe by the company. He was the resident from 1866 until his death in 1872. An even earlier event was Hill House built by 1833 it was purchased by the North Midland Railway Company in 1837 as an office for resident engineer Frederick Swanwick. When the tunnel was completed, Swanwick left town, but the house was passed to engineers James Campbell and William Howe, and by the 1860s, Dr. Wilson, the local medical practitioner was in residence.

The North Midland Railway tunnel sank nine ventilator shafts through which smoke wafted across the Peaks. Clay Cross is situated at the highest point on the line 361 feet above sea level, when it opened in 1840. A narrow gauge line transported coal up the incline to the works. Another mile north along the &#x27;Black Path&#x27; was Clay Cross railway station, between the halts at Tupton and Hepthorne Lane.

===Religion===
The Anglican church of St Bartholomew had been built and consecrated in 1851. Six years later a spire was added. The Rev. Joseph Oldham and his wife, Emma were the first conscientious incumbents. Her brother was radical designer and founder of the Arts and Crafts movement, William Morris. Morris was commissioned to install a saintly stained glass window.

Other places of worship in Clay Cross are:
* Methodist Church on High Street.
* Baptist Church on Market Street (now closed).
* Clay Cross Community Church - C4 (Assemblies of God) on Market Street.
* Roman Catholic Church of St. Patrick and St. Bridget on Thanet Street.
* Holmgate Evangelical Church on Valley Road, Holmgate.
* Salvation Army on Thanet Street.
* St Barnabas Church, an Anglican congregation meeting at the St Barnabas Centre on Pilsley Road, Danesmoor.
* Community of Christ on Thanet Street.

===Danesmoor Cemetery and Parkhouse Memorial===
Parkhouse Colliery Memorial in Danesmoor Cemetery stands today as testament to a disaster. In November 1882 an underground explosion brought the collapse of the pit shaft causing the death of 45 men and boys. Many of their families lived in company housing at Pleasant Row, Chapel Row, Cellar Row and Gaffers Row. Also known as Egstow Terrace, this last street was built in 1846, was considered of better average quality housing.

===Co-operative===
The Clay Cross Pioneer Industrial Co-operative Society&#x27;s first shop was opened on the corner of the High Street and Market Street. It was an early member of the Co-operative Movement founded in Rochdale by John Bright that spread rapidly across the North of England. The Co-operative Society archives say that the Clay Cross Pioneer Industrial Society merged with the Chesterfield &amp; District Co-operative Society in 1915.

==Housing Finance Act dispute==

The town was an urban district until 1974, when it was merged into the North East Derbyshire district under the Local Government Act 1972. In the 1970s the council achieved brief notoriety due to its refusal to implement the Housing Finance Act 1972 in increasing the rents of council housing: by law the rents should have increased by £1 a week from October 1972. The council was one of several to show defiance against the Act and of three to be ordered to comply by the Department of the Environment in November 1972 (the others being Eccles and Halstead). Clay Cross UDC was threatened with an audit in December 1972. The constituency Labour party barred the eleven councillors from its list of approved candidates. The District Auditor ordered the eleven Labour Party councillors to pay a surcharge of £635 each in January 1973, finding them &#x27;guilty of negligence and misconduct&#x27;. Conisbrough UDC faced a similar audit on 19 January 1973.

The UDC made an appeal in the case to the High Court. Clydebank and Cumbernauld abandoned similar actions in March 1973. The surcharge was upheld by the High Court on 30 July 1973, which also added a further £2,000 legal costs to their bill, as well as barring them from public office for five years. The council further defied authority (the Pay Board) in August, when they decided to increase council workers&#x27; earnings. This provoked a further dispute with NALGO. Ultimately, the dispute became moot with the replacement of Clay Cross Urban District Council with the North East Derbyshire District Council from 1 April 1974. The councillors were made bankrupt in 1975.

A book on the dispute between the council and the government, &quot;The Story of Clay Cross&quot;, was written by one of the councillors, David Skinner and the journalist Julia Langdon. The book was published by Spokesman Books in 1974.

==Local economy and transport==
Clay Cross has a large modern business park called Coney Green Business Park and is located between Egstow and Danesmoor.
There is a community hospital on the A6175 &quot;Market Street&quot;. Danesmoor Industrial Estate close to the former site of the Parkhouse Colliery. The town&#x27;s library is on &quot;Holmgate Road&quot;.
Clay Cross town centre is currently undergoing a £22m redevelopment which has so far included a new supermarket, new bus station and new relief road. The second phase of this is due to start which will see a new parade of shops plus a new medical centre. Eventually the site of the former junior and infant schools which is located in the town centre will be redeveloped.

M1 motorway junction 29 is five miles away. The nearest railway stations are Chesterfield (6 miles) and Alfreton. Clay Cross station closed as part of the Beeching cuts in 1967. In 2017, a Stagecoach in Chesterfield bus connecting Clay Cross to Chesterfield railway station was introduced. A passenger railway line runs in a tunnel under the town without stopping.

There has been talk of providing a motorway spur to the town in the past. To ease chronic congestion on the A61, which has seen traffic grow by 10% in the past few years, there is talk of a dual carriageway bypassing Clay Cross and Tupton before joining the A617 near Hasland, heading North West to Horns Bridge.

==Education==
Tupton Hall School is in Tupton and located about one mile to the north of Clay Cross. Previously Clay Cross had a secondary school located in Market Street, and a junior school located off High Street. The junior and infant schools were merged and moved to a new purpose built complex on Pilsley Road Danesmoor and renamed Sharley Park Community Primary School. The site of the former schools has been cleared and is awaiting development.
The secondary school was closed in 1969 and transferred to Tupton Hall as part of the Government&#x27;s drive to comprehensive education, it is now one of the largest with around 2,000 pupils, including a sixth form centre. Clay Cross Secondary School was converted to an adult education centre.

==Media==
Local TV coverage is provided by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the Emley Moor TV transmitter,BBC East Midlands and ITV Central can also be received from the Waltham TV transmitter.

The town is served by both BBC Radio Sheffield and BBC Radio Derby. Other radio stations including Greatest Hits Radio North Derbyshire, and Chesterfield Radio, a community based radio station that broadcast from Chesterfield.

The &quot;Derbyshire Times&quot; is the weekly local newspaper that serves the town.

==Sport==

===Leisure centre===

Sharley Park Leisure Centre, on the A6175, Market Street, has swimming, gym and sports hall facilities.

===Football===
Five football clubs from the town, all now extinct, have competed in the FA Cup over the years -
* Clay Cross Town F.C. (1874)
* Clay Cross Zingari F.C.
* Clay Cross Town F.C. (1909)
* Clay Cross &amp; Danesmoor Welfare F.C.
* Biwater F.C. (formerly Clay Cross Works F.C.)

The town&#x27;s current team, the third to be called Clay Cross Town, play in the Central Midlands Football League, and played in the FA Vase for the first time in 2016.

<text>In epidemiology, force of infection (denoted formula_1) is the rate at which susceptible individuals acquire an infectious disease. Because it takes account of susceptibility it can be used to compare the rate of transmission between different groups of the population for the same infectious disease, or even between different infectious diseases. That is to say, formula_1 is directly proportional to formula_3; the effective transmission rate.

:formula_4

Such a calculation is difficult because not all new infections are reported, and it is often difficult to know how many susceptibles were exposed. However, formula_1 can be calculated for an infectious disease in an endemic state if homogeneous mixing of the population and a rectangular population distribution (such as that generally found in developed countries), rather than a pyramid, is assumed. In this case, formula_1 is given by:

:formula_7

where formula_8 is the average age of infection. In other words, formula_8 is the average time spent in the susceptible group before becoming infected. The rate of becoming infected (formula_1) is therefore formula_11 (since rate is 1/time). The advantage of this method of calculating formula_1 is that data on the average age of infection is very easily obtainable, even if not all cases of the disease are reported.

<text>Jan Baptist De Vos (7 February 1844 – 30 March 1923) was mayor (&quot;burgomaster&quot;) of Antwerp in Belgium from 15 March 1909 until 21 July 1921. He stayed on as mayor after the capture of Antwerp by German forces during World War I, and remained in office after the end of German occupation.

==Career==
Jan De Vos was born in Dendermonde. He became a successful trader and entered local politics when he was elected in the city council as councillor on 19 October 1890.

King Leopold II appointed him mayor of Antwerp on 22 February 1909, much against the wishes of the Liberal Party, of which Jan De Vos was also member, who would have preferred the alderman (&quot;schepen&quot;) Victor Desguin.

The events of October 1914 were the most intense of his tenure. The German Army besieged the city of Antwerp and the situation worsened in the city due to the German bombardment. The city council decided to negotiate the surrender of the city. De Vos negotiated terms with General Hans Hartwig von Beseler of the German Army in Kontich to the south of Antwerp. De Vos signed the surrender of the city and the remaining fortresses around Antwerp on 10 October 1914.

De Vos remained in office throughout the war. After German capitulation, he was not prosecuted for collaboration and stayed on as mayor until 21 July 1921. He died on 30 March 1923, aged 79.

<doc id="934416" wikidata="Q3075123" url="?curid=934416" title="Follow the Leader (Eric B. &amp; Rakim album)">
<text>Follow the Leader is the second studio album by American hip hop duo Eric B. &amp; Rakim, released on July 26, 1988. Following their debut album, &quot;Paid in Full&quot; (1987), Eric B. &amp; Rakim left 4th &amp; B&#x27;way Records and signed with Uni Records, a subsidiary label of major label MCA Records. They recorded &quot;Follow the Leader&quot; at Power Play Studios in Long Island City in Queens, New York. The duo produced, composed, and arranged the album with additional contributions from Rakim&#x27;s brother Stevie Blass Griffin, who contributed with various instruments. Eric B. &amp; Rakim worked with audio engineers Carlton Batts and Patrick Adams on the album. In a similar manner to their first album, a &quot;ghost producer&quot; was brought in for two songs. In a 2007 interview with Unkut.com, The 45 King said he produced both &quot;Microphone Fiend&quot; and &quot;The R&quot;. &quot;Microphone Fiend&quot; was originally made for Fab 5 Freddy, until 45 King gave it over to Eric B., the group&#x27;s &quot;DJ&quot;.

==Reception and legacy==
&quot;Follow the Leader&quot; peaked at number 22 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Pop Albums and at number seven on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Black Albums chart. It achieved higher charting than Eric B. &amp; Rakim&#x27;s debut album and serves as their best-charting album in the United States. The album produced four singles, &quot;Follow the Leader&quot;, &quot;Microphone Fiend&quot;, &quot;The R&quot;, and &quot;Lyrics of Fury&quot;. &quot;Follow the Leader&quot; peaked at number 16 on the Hot Black Singles, at number 11 on the Hot Dance/Disco, and at number five on the Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales chart. &quot;The R&quot; reached number 79 on the Hot Black Singles, number 28 on the Hot Dance/Disco, number 41 on the Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales, and number 14 on the Hot Rap Singles chart. On September 27, 1988, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipments in excess of 500,000 copies in the United States.

&quot;Follow the Leader&quot; was well received by contemporary critics. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer Jonathan Gold viewed it as &quot;far more consistent&quot; than the duo&#x27;s &quot;Paid in Full&quot;, calling Eric B. &quot;a master of chill, understated beats&quot; and complimenting Rakim for weaving &quot;a laid-back web of words, his whiskey-smooth tenor less noisy but more intense than the machine-gun mutterings you hear booming from beat boxes, his keen rhymes all the more devastating for being near-whispered where lesser rappers would shout&quot;. In his review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau found the duo&#x27;s sampling as an improvement from their previous work&#x27;s &quot;Brownian motion&quot; and complimented Rakim&#x27;s &quot;ever-increasing words-per-minute ratio—the man loves language like a young Bob D&quot;. Peter Watrous of &quot;The New York Times&quot; commended Eric B.&#x27;s mixes and described him as &quot;a minimalist virtuoso&quot;. Watrous called Rakim &quot;one of the most distinctive rappers in the business&quot; and elaborated on his lyricism: &quot;His voice soars as gracefully as a well-thrown football; it&#x27;ll change direction on the spot. He will vary rhythms, pushing and pulling against the beat to highlight his lyrics. Insistent, cool and dedicated, his rapping has an urgency that makes the music much more than pop; it sounds like a musical version of a political, social vision.

In the 2006 book &quot;To the Break of Dawn: A Freestyle on the Hip Hop Aesthetic&quot;, author William Jelani Cobb later wrote of the album&#x27;s significance:

In a retrospective review, AllMusic editor Steve Huey viewed &quot;Follow the Leader&quot; as an improvement over &quot;Paid in Full&quot;, commending Rakim&#x27;s &quot;agile, up-tempo lyrical showcases&quot;. In a dual review of both &quot;Paid in Full&quot; and &quot;Follow the Leader&quot;″s reissues, &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Jess Harvell expressed that the high points of the latter album &quot;are as high as any rap group has gotten&quot; and wrote that both albums&#x27; music serve as &quot;a reminder of a brief period where people thought they could become a millionaire on skills alone, where the reality of that was so far away that no one had to think about what being a millionaire would mean to the culture that nurtured those skills&quot;. In 1998, &quot;Follow the Leader&quot; was selected as one of &quot;The Source&quot;″s 100 Best Rap Albums, and in 2005, it was ranked number 12 on comedian Chris Rock&#x27;s list of the &quot;Top 25 Hip-Hop Albums&quot;. The track &quot;Lyrics of Fury&quot; was ranked number five on About.com&#x27;s list of &quot;Top 100 Rap Songs&quot;.

The album is ranked number 979 in &quot;All-Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (3rd. edition, 2000).

== &quot;Follow the Leader (Reimagined as Jazz)&quot; ==
&quot;Follow the Leader, re-imagined as Jazz&quot; is an instrumental reworking of the entire album by Jonathan Hay, Mike Smith and Benny Reid. The album spent four non-consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Jazz Albums chart, dethroning Michael Bublé&#x27;s &quot;Love&quot;. Eric B. told &quot;Forbes&quot;, 

Rakim was quoted in &quot;HipHopDX&quot; as saying:

<doc id="934423" wikidata="Q6451721" url="?curid=934423" title="Virtual address space">
<text>In computing, a virtual address space (VAS) or [[address space]] is the set of ranges of virtual addresses that an operating system makes available to a process. The range of virtual addresses usually starts at a low address and can extend to the highest address allowed by the computer&#x27;s instruction set architecture and supported by the operating system&#x27;s pointer size implementation, which can be 4 bytes for 32-bit or 8 bytes for 64-bit OS versions. This provides several benefits, one of which is security through process isolation assuming each process is given a separate address space.

== Example ==
:&quot;In the following description, the terminology used will be particular to the Windows NT operating system, but the concepts are applicable to other virtual memory operating systems.&quot;

When a new application on a 32-bit OS is executed, the process has a VAS: each one of the memory addresses (from 0 to 232 − 1) in that space can have a single byte as a value. Initially, none of them have values (&#x27;-&#x27; represents no value). Using or setting values in such a VAS would cause a memory exception.

 0 4 GiB
 VAS |----------------------------------------------|

Then the application&#x27;s executable file is mapped into the VAS. Addresses in the process VAS are mapped to bytes in the exe file. The OS manages the mapping:

 0 4 GiB
 VAS |---vvv----------------------------------------|
 mapping |||
 file bytes app

The v&#x27;s are values from bytes in the mapped file. Then, required DLL files are mapped (this includes custom libraries as well as system ones such as codice_1 and codice_2):

 0 4 GiB
 VAS |---vvv--------vvvvvv---vvvv-------------------|
 mapping ||| |||||| ||||
 file bytes app kernel user

The process then starts executing bytes in the EXE file. However, the only way the process can use or set &#x27;-&#x27; values in its VAS is to ask the OS to map them to bytes from a file. A common way to use VAS memory in this way is to map it to the page file. The page file is a single file, but multiple distinct sets of contiguous bytes can be mapped into a VAS:

 0 4 GiB
 VAS |---vvv--------vvvvvv---vvvv----vv---v----vvv--|
 mapping ||| |||||| |||| || | |||
 file bytes app kernel user system_page_file

And different parts of the page file can map into the VAS of different processes:

 0 4 GiB
 VAS 1 |---vvvv-------vvvvvv---vvvv----vv---v----vvv--|
 mapping |||| |||||| |||| || | |||
 file bytes app1 app2 kernel user system_page_file
 mapping |||| |||||| |||| || |
 VAS 2 |--------vvvv--vvvvvv---vvvv-------vv---v------|

On Microsoft Windows 32-bit, by default, only are made available to processes for their own use. The other are used by the operating system. On later 32-bit editions of Microsoft Windows, it is possible to extend the user-mode virtual address space to while only is left for kernel-mode virtual address space by marking the programs as IMAGE_FILE_LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE and enabling the switch in the boot.ini file.

On Microsoft Windows 64-bit, in a process running an executable that was linked with , the operating system artificially limits the user mode portion of the process&#x27;s virtual address space to 2 GiB. This applies to both 32- and 64-bit executables. Processes running executables that were linked with the option, which is the default for 64-bit Visual Studio 2010 and later, have access to more than of virtual address space: up to for 32-bit executables, up to for 64-bit executables in Windows through Windows 8, and up to for 64-bit executables in Windows 8.1 and later.

Allocating memory via C&#x27;s malloc establishes the
page file as the backing store for any new virtual address space. However, a process can also explicitly map file bytes.

== Linux ==
For x86 CPUs, Linux 32-bit allows splitting the user and kernel address ranges in different ways: &quot;3G/1G user/kernel&quot; (default), &quot;1G/3G user/kernel&quot; or &quot;2G/2G user/kernel&quot;.

<text>La Liga Filipina () was a secret society. It was founded by José Rizal in the house of Doroteo Ongjunco at Ilaya Street, Tondo, Manila on July 3, 1892.In 1892, prior to its birth, Rizal alighted at the Old Malolos station to campaign in the Malolos Historic Town Center for the Philippine League&#x27;s establishment.

The organization derived from La Solidaridad and the Propaganda movement. The purpose of La Liga Filipina was to build a new group that sought to involve the people directly in the reform movement.

The league was to be a sort of mutual aid and self-help society dispensing scholarship funds and legal aid, loaning capital and setting up cooperatives, the league became a threat to Spanish authorities that they arrested Rizal on July 6, 1892, then he was sent to Dapitan.

During the exile of Rizal, the organization became inactive, though through the efforts of Domingo Franco and Andrés Bonifacio, it was reorganized. The organization decided to declare its support for La Solidaridad and the reforms it advocated, raise funds for the paper, and defray the expenses of deputies advocating reforms for the country before the Spanish Cortes. Eventually after some disarray in the leadership of the group, the Supreme Council of the League dissolved the society.

Liga membership split into two groups when it was about to be revealed: the conservatives formed the &quot;Cuerpo de Compromisarios&quot; which pledged to continue supporting the La Solidaridad while the radicals led by Bonifacio devoted themselves to a new and secret society, the Katipunan.

<text>Kolozs County was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary, of the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom and of the Principality of Transylvania. Its territory is now in north-western Romania (north-western Transylvania). The capital of the county was Kolozsvár (present-day Cluj-Napoca).

==Geography==

After 1876, Kolozs County shared borders with the Hungarian counties Bihar, Szilágy, Szolnok-Doboka, Beszterce-Naszód, Maros-Torda, and Torda-Aranyos. The rivers Crișul Repede and Someșul Mic flowed through the county. Its area was in 1910.

==History==
Kolozs County was formed in the 11th century. In 1876, when the administrative structure of Transylvania was changed, the territory of Kolozs was modified and some villages of Doboka County (which was then disbanded) were annexed to it. In 1920, by the Treaty of Trianon, the county became part of Romania. Following the Second Vienna Award, large part of it was retaken by Hungary in 1940 and the county was recreated; however, after World War II it became part of Romania again. Most of the territory of the county lies in the present Romanian county Cluj, some parts of the county are in the present Romanian counties Sălaj (north-west), Bistrița-Năsăud (north-east), and Mureș (south-east).

<text>The Latvian Olympic Committee (, LOK) is a non-profit organization that is the National Olympic Committee for Latvia. Its headquarters are in Riga.

== History ==
The Committee was created on 23 April 1922. In 1923, it received a notice from the International Olympic Committee that Latvia could take part in the next Olympic Games. After the occupation of Latvia by the Soviet Union in 1940, its activity was suspended. During this time, Latvians competed as part of USSR delegation.

The committee was reformed on 17 September 1988 and was recognized by the IOC in 1991.

== List of LOK Presidents ==
== Member federations ==
The Latvian National Federations are the organizations that coordinate all aspects of their individual sports. They are responsible for training, competition and development of their sports. There are currently 29 Olympic Summer and eight Winter Sport Federations and two another Sports Federations in Latvia.

==Latvian Olympiad==
Beginning in 2004, the Latvian Olympic Committee has organised a multi-sport event called the Latvian Olympiad (), usually shortly before the corresponding Olympic Games. Summer and Winter Latvian Olympiads and Youth Olympiads have been held. These are modelled on the Olympic Games, with teams representing Latvian municipalities, an opening and closing ceremony. In some cases, Olympiad competitions have served as qualifiers to the Latvian Olympic team.

<text>The Dassault Mercure is a twin-engined narrow-body jet-powered airliner developed and manufactured by French aircraft firm Dassault Aviation. According to Dassault, it was the first large-scale European cooperative civil aeronautics programme.

During 1967, the Mercure was proposed as a French competitor to the American Boeing 737. It was Dassault&#x27;s first venture into the commercial jet airliner market, the company having traditionally built fighters and executive jets. On 28 May 1971, the prototype conducted its maiden flight, while the type entered service on 4 June 1974 with French airline Air Inter.

Attempts were made to market the type in the US, including partnerships with American manufacturers Douglas, Lockheed and General Dynamics, with the vision of producing it in the United States. However, the Mercure had very little success on the market, which has been attributed to several factors, including a lack of range in comparison to rival aircraft. As a consequence, there were only 12 aircraft constructed, all of which were built between 1971 and 1975. The Mercure performed its final flight in 1995.

==Development==
===Engineering===
During the mid-1960s, Marcel Dassault, the founder and owner of French aircraft company Dassault Aviation, as well as other parties such as the French Directorate General for Civil Aviation (DGAC), examined the civil aviation market and noticed that there was no existing aircraft that was intended specifically to serve low-distance air routes. Thus, it was found that there could be a prospective market for such an airliner, if it were to be developed. The DGAC was keen to promote a French equivalent to the popular American Boeing 737, and suggested the development of a 140-seat airliner to Dassault.

In 1967, with the issuing of backing by the French government, Dassault decided to commence work on its short-haul airliner concept. During 1968, the initial studies performed by the company&#x27;s research team were orientated around a 110 to 120-seat airliner which was powered by a pair of rear-mounted Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan engines; as time went on, a specification for a 150-seat aircraft with a 1000-km range (540 nm) was developed. As envisioned, the new airliner would attack this market segment at the upper end with a 140-seat jetliner, contrasting against the 100-seat Boeing 737-100 and the 115-seat Boeing 737-200 variants then in production. In April 1969, the development programme was officially launched.

This aircraft was viewed as being a major opportunity for Dassault to demonstrate upon the civilian market its knowledge of high-speed aerodynamics and low-speed lift capability that had previously been developed in the production of a long line of jet fighters, such as the Ouragan, Mystère and Mirage aircraft. The French Government contributed 56 per cent of the programme&#x27;s total development costs, which was intended to be repaid by Dassault via a levy on sales of the airliner. The company also financed the initiative with $10 million of its own money, as well as being mainly responsible for costs related to manufacture.
The program cost was $75 million and the unit cost $6 million in 1971, raised to US$6.5 million in 1972.

According to aerospace publication Flight International, the design of the new airliner had been shaped by Dassault&#x27;s &quot;philosophy of aiming the aircraft at a corner of the market which it believes existing types do not adequately serve&quot;. Marcel Dassault decided to name the aircraft &quot;Mercure&quot; (French for Mercury). &quot;Wanting to give the name of a god of mythology, I found of them only one which had wings with its helmet and ailerons with its feet, from where the Mercure name..&quot; said Marcel Dassault. Extremely modern computer tools for the time were used to develop the wing of the Mercure 100. Even though it was larger than the Boeing 737, the Mercure 100 was the faster of the two. In June 1969, a full scale mockup was presented during the Paris Airshow at Le Bourget Airport. On 4 April 1971, the prototype Mercure 01 rolled out of Dassault&#x27;s Bordeaux-Merignac plant.

===Flight testing===
On 28 May 1971, the maiden flight of the first prototype, powered by a pair of Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-11 turbofan engines, capable of generating up to of thrust, took place at Mérignac. On 7 September 1972, the second prototype, which was powered by a pair of Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-15 engines, which would be used on all subsequent Mercures built, flew for the first time. On 19 July 1973, the first production aircraft conducted its maiden flight. On 12 February 1974, the Mercure received its Type certificate and, on 30 September 1974, was certified for Category IIIA approach all-weather automatic landing (minimum visibility = 500 ft, minimum ceiling = 50 ft). The Mercure 100 was also the first commercial airliner to be operated by a 100% female crew on one of its flights.

Dassault tried to attract the interest of major airlines and several regional airlines, touting the Mercure 100 as a replacement for the Douglas DC-9. A few airlines showed some initial interest but only Air Inter, a domestic French airline, placed an order. This lack of interest was due to several factors, including the devaluation of the dollar and the oil crisis of the 1970s, but mainly because of the Mercure&#x27;s operating range – suitable for domestic European operations but unable to sustain longer routes; at maximum payload, the aircraft&#x27;s range was only . Consequently, the Mercure 100 achieved no foreign sales. With a total of only ten sales with one of the prototypes refurbished and sold as the 11th Mercure to Air Inter, the airliner represented one of the worst failures of a commercial airliner in terms of aircraft sold.

===Mercure 200 project===
After the commercial failure of the Mercure 100, Marcel Dassault requested a new version, the Mercure 200C, in cooperation with Air France, to carry 140 passengers across . Several major carriers in the United States showed some interest.
At the beginning of 1973, an agreement was formed with the French government to finance this programme as a 200-million French Francs loan, refundable on sales after the 201st aircraft. However Air France sought a JT8D-117 powered airliner, quieter but larger, requiring an additional 80-million French Francs loan. The French government decided Dassault had to support half of the Mercure 200C development costs, which was impossible after the Mercure 100 failure. The project was then canceled.

To answer an official request, Dassault proposed a variant with the new CFM International CFM56 and a supercritical wing. In 1975, contacts were made with Douglas Aircraft Company and Lockheed Corporation to build and sell it in the US, and with SNIAS to build it in France. However, Marcel Dassault was concerned that the CFM56 was not yet ordered. The Mercure 200-1 would be lengthened by to accommodate 160 passengers in two classes to 184, while the 200-2 would keep the Mercure 100 fuselage length with the new wing to seat 124 in two classes to 150.

The wide wing of the 200 version would have an area of , for a empty weight and a MTOW.
Meanwhile, Douglas introduced a competing, stretched DC-9. Dassault then initiated contacts with General Dynamics, a Mirage F1 competitor with the F-16 Fighting Falcon, with no outcome. In 1981, Marcel Dassault tried to license the program in the US, unsuccessfully.

==Design==

The Dassault Mercure was a jet-powered narrow-body jet airliner, optimised for short-haul routes. It intentionally exchanged fuel for passenger capacity in order to carry a greater passenger load. As such, the Mercure had up to 17 per cent more seats than the competing Boeing 737 while having a shorter range. It was designed to be outfitted with a two-crew flight deck, although operator Air Inter had its aircraft flown by three-man crews. According to Flight International, the basic model of the Mercure featured a degree of built-in stretch potential. Elements of the design were reportedly capable of supporting the envisioned expanded model with little or no change, including much of the wing, cabin, and the undercarriage. The landing gear was spaced to accommodate the fitting of longer legs to, in turn, enable larger engines and an elongated fuselage to be later adopted.

The wing of the Mercure was largely conventional. It was relatively thick, possessing a section of 12.5 per cent thickness at the wing root, slimming to 8.5 per cent thickness at the tip of the wing. Aspects of the Mercure&#x27;s wing, such as the general layout and individual wing sections, were optimised using a combination of wind tunnel tests and computer-generated simulations by Dassault&#x27;s design team. The wing had a good lift/drag ratio and a high block efficiency. The flaps formed a continuous spanwise unit when deployed in the take-off position, requiring neither low-speed ailerons nor cut-outs to accommodate jet exhaust, due to the engines being fixed low down upon deep pylons.

Production Mercures were powered by a pair of Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-15 turbofan engines, capable of generating a maximum of 15,500 lb (69 kN) thrust. These were mounted on underwing pylons, which were designed with anti-vibration mountings. The engines themselves featured joint Snecma/Dassault-developed thrust reverser and noise suppression systems. Significant attention had been paid to reducing engine noise, this issue having been one of the final topics of research during the Mercure&#x27;s development. According to Flight International, there was a perception that the Federal Aviation Administration of the United States, a major potential market for the Mercure, may enact regulations that would necessitate the implementation of a noise-attenuation retrofit programme, and thus Dassault needed to be prepared to address this foreseen scenario.

Dassault emphasised the commercial value of the Mercure, highlighting its low operating costs across short sectors, which principally resulted from its refined aerodynamic features and low structural weight. The design also benefitted from an advanced fail-safe structure, the majority of which having been milled in accordance to Dassault&#x27;s traditional military manufacturing practices. The Mercure featured in-house-developed triplicated, fail-safe hydraulic flight control system and the flight controls lacked any manual reversion. Air conditioning also featured independent duplicated systems with a cross-feed tapped from the engines compressors along with, unusually, the auxiliary power unit for use during takeoffs and on the ground, as well as in the instance of a double-engine failure scenario. The electrics were composed of a pair of independent 120/128 volt three-phase 400 Hz AC systems fed via engine-driven alternators, while a third AC system was driven by the APU. There are also three independent 28 volt DC sources.

==Operational history==
Intending for the Mercure to be mass-produced in substantial numbers (According to &quot;Flight International&quot;, the 300th aircraft was projected to be delivered by the end of 1979), Dassault established a total of four plants especially for the Mercure program: Martignas (close to Bordeaux), Poitiers, Seclin (close to Lille) and Istres. Additional manufacturing work was distributed across locations throughout Europe, the production programme being a collaborative effort between Dassault, Fiat Aviazione of Italy, SABCA (Société Anonyme Belge de Constructions Aéronautiques) of Belgium, Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA) of Spain and the Swiss National Aircraft Factory at
Emmen, all of which acted as risk-sharing partners in the venture.

On 30 January 1972, Air Inter placed an order for ten Mercures, which had to be delivered between 30 October 1973 and 13 December 1975. At this point, the break-even point was anticipated to be around 125–150 aircraft. However, due to the lack of other orders, the production line was shut down on 15 December 1975. Only a total of two prototypes and ten production aircraft were built. Air Inter eventually refurbished and bought one of the prototypes (number 02) to add it to its fleet.

On 29 April 1995, the last two Mercures in service flew their last commercial flights. Throughout their combined cumulative operational lifetimes, the Mercure accumulated a total of 360,000 flight hours, during which 44 million passengers were carried across 440,000 individual flights without any accidents occurring, and a 98% in-service reliability.

<doc id="934442" wikidata="Q157470" url="?curid=934442" title="Debtor">
<text>A debtor or debitor is a legal entity (legal person) that owes a debt to another entity. The entity may be an individual, a firm, a government, a company or other legal person. The counterparty is called a creditor. When the counterpart of this debt arrangement is a bank, the debtor is more often referred to as a borrower.

If X borrowed money from their bank, X is the debtor and the bank is the creditor. If X puts money in the bank, X is the creditor and the bank is the debtor.

It is not a crime to fail to pay a debt. Except in certain bankruptcy situations, debtors can choose to pay debts in any priority they choose. But if one fails to pay a debt, they have broken a contract or agreement between them and a creditor. Generally, most oral and written agreements for the repayment of consumer debt – debts for personal, family or household purposes secured primarily by a person&#x27;s residence – are enforceable.

For the most part, debts that are business-related must be made in writing to be enforceable by law. If the written agreement requires the debtor to pay a specific amount of money, then the creditor does not have to accept any lesser amount, and should be paid in full.

Also, if there was no actual agreement but the creditor has proven to have loaned an amount of money, undertaken services or given the debtor a product, the debtor must then pay the creditor.

==The history of the term “debtor”==

Anthropologist David Graeber suggests in &quot;&quot; that trading began with some form of credit namely the promise to pay later for already handed over goods. Because of this it can be said that debtors and creditors existed even before the implementation of coinage.

The term debtor comes from the word &quot;debt&quot;, which originated from the French word &quot;dette&quot;, which came from the Latin word &quot;debere&quot;, meaning to owe.

==Types of debtors==
According to numbers released on March 31, 2013 by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, household debt has passed the $11 trillion mark in the United States. Student loan debt will also soon pass the trillion-dollar mark.

There are many different types of debts which can cause the debtor and creditor relationship to arise. Some of these areas include:
*Bank account debt
*Trade debtors (most commonly used in accounting terms)
*Car loan debt
*Credit card debt
*Council tax debt
*Gambling debt
*Legal court debt
*Loan shark debt
*Overdraft debt
*Parking fines
*Payday loan debt
*Personal loan debt
*Phone debt
*Utility bill debts

Being a debtor is not restricted to an individual, as in business there is also company debt. Many companies heavily invest in accountancy and rely on insolvency solutions to prevent debt from being left aside.

==Legislation==
In the United Kingdom, the Administration of Justice Act 1970 protects debtors from harassment intended to coerce payment of a debt.

==Default==

Default occurs when the debtor has not met its legal obligations according to the debt contract, e.g.- it has not made a scheduled payment, or has violated a covenant in the debt contract. Default may occur if the debtor is either unwilling or unable to pay its debt. This can occur with all debt obligations including bonds, mortgages, loans, and promissory notes.

If the debt owed becomes beyond the possibility of repayment, the debtor faces insolvency or bankruptcy; in the United Kingdom and some states of the United States until the mid-19th century, debtors could be imprisoned in debtor&#x27;s prisons, while in some countries such as Greece debtors are still imprisoned.

==Debtor in Bankruptcy and Individual Voluntary Arrangements==
An Individual Voluntary Arrangement is a legally binding arrangement supervised by a licensed Insolvency Practitioner, the purpose of which is to enable an individual, sole trader or Partner (&quot;the Debtor&quot;) to reach a compromise with his creditors and avoid the consequences of bankruptcy. The compromise should offer a larger repayment towards the creditor&#x27;s debt than could otherwise be expected were the Debtor to be made bankrupt. This is often facilitated by the Debtor making contributions to the arrangement from his income over a designated period or from a third party contribution or other sources that would not ordinarily be available to a Trustee in Bankruptcy.

==Other uses==
In the Latin version of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, the words &quot;Et dimitte nobis debita nostra/Sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris&quot;, the words &quot;Debtor&quot; and &quot;Debt&quot; are sometimes translated as &quot;Sinner&quot; and &quot;Sin&quot;. This particular understanding of sin, as a form of debt that humanity inherits, is related to the soteriological theory of substitutionary atonement, which states that Jesus died on the cross as a propitiation, or substitute, for sinners.

<doc id="934443" wikidata="Q7077143" url="?curid=934443" title="Ocular rosacea">
<text>Ocular rosacea is a type of rosacea that affects the eyes. Signs and symptoms generally consist of redness, irritation or burning of the eyes. Affected individuals may also feel that there is something, such as an eyelash, in the eye and frequently have redness of the nose and cheeks as well. Complications include corneal ulcer.

Those who have ocular rosacea may be treated with warm compresses, artificial tears and washing the area around the eye with warm water, including the eyelids, to help relieve symptoms. Additionally, oral antibiotics, typically doxycycline, may be prescribed. Some people with ocular rosacea feel that dietary restrictions of caffeine, spicy foods, and alcoholic beverages may reduce or eliminate symptoms.

Ocular rosacea may be caused by an overproliferation of the &quot;Demodex&quot; mites &quot;D. folliculorum&quot; and &quot;D. brevis&quot;, both frequently referred to as &quot;eyelash mites&quot;.

== Treatment ==
Doxycycline can be used in the treatment of ocular rosacea in dosages of 100 mg once or twice a day for a period of 2 to 3 months. Other studies report a good efficacy of 50 mg once a day in less severe cases. A formulation of 40 mg with a delayed release for long-term therapy can also be used. Side effects of treating ocular rosacea with doxycycline include nausea, vomiting, photosensitivity and headache, which may lead to premature discontinuation of treatment. After discontinuation of doxycycline, recurrences may occur within three months; therefore, many studies recommend either slow tapering or treatment with a lower dose over a longer period of time. Low-dose doxycycline (50 mg pe day or less) improves the clinical symptoms of rosacea by its anti-inflammatory effect rather than by its antibiotic effect.

<doc id="934445" wikidata="Q846073" url="?curid=934445" title="2005 New Zealand general election">
<text>The 2005 New Zealand general election on Saturday 17 September 2005 determined the membership of the 48th New Zealand Parliament. One hundred and twenty-one MPs were elected to the New Zealand House of Representatives: 69 from single-member electorates, including one overhang seat, and 52 from party lists (one extra due to the overhang).

No party won a majority, but the Labour Party of Prime Minister Helen Clark secured two more seats than nearest rival, the National Party of Dr Don Brash. With the exception of the newly formed Māori Party, which took four Māori electorates from Labour, most of the other parties polled lower than in the previous election, losing votes and seats.

Brash deferred conceding defeat until 1 October, when National&#x27;s election-night 49 seats fell to 48 after special votes were counted. The official count increased the Māori Party share of the party vote above 2%, entitling them to three rather than two seats from the party vote. With four electorate seats, the election night overhang of two seats was reduced to one, and as National had the 120th seat allocated under the party vote, National lost one list seat (that of Katrina Shanks) that they appeared to have won on election night.

The election was a strong recovery for National which won 21 more seats than at the 2002 election, where it suffered its worst result in its history, and the highest party vote percentage for the party since 1990; indeed, National saw its first vote share gain since 1990. Despite its resurgence, National failed to displace Labour as the largest party in Parliament. National&#x27;s gains apparently came mainly at the expense of smaller parties, while Labour won only two seats less than in 2002.

On 17 October, Clark announced a new coalition agreement that saw the return of her minority government coalition with the Progressive Party, with confidence and supply support from New Zealand First and from United Future. New Zealand First parliamentary leader Winston Peters and United Future parliamentary leader Peter Dunne became ministers of the Crown outside Cabinet, Peters as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Dunne as Minister of Revenue. The Green Party which had supported Labour before the election received no cabinet post (see below), but gained several concessions from the coalition on matters such as energy and transport, and agreed to support the government on matters of confidence and supply. This was the second time that Labour won three consecutive elections, and to date it is the only time it has won three consecutive peacetime elections.

==The election==
The total votes cast in 2005 was 2,304,005 (2,164,595 &amp; 139,510 Māori). Turnout was 80.92% of those on the rolls, or 77.05% of voting age population. Turnout was higher than in the previous 2002 election (72.5% and 76.98% respectively), and the Māori roll turnout at 67.07% was significantly higher than 2002 (57.5%).

In the election 739 candidates stood, and there were 19 registered parties with party lists. Of the candidates, 525 were electorate and list, 72 were electorate only and 142 were list only. All but 37 represented registered parties (on the list or in the electorate or both). Only 35 candidates from registered parties chose to stand as an electorate candidate only. 71% of candidates (523) were male and 29% (216) female; the same percentages as in 2002.

Labour had achieved a third term in office for the first time since 1943.

===MPs retiring in 2005===

== Analysis of results ==
Going into the election, Labour had assurances of support from the Greens (six seats in 2005, down three from 2002) and from the Progressives (one seat, down one). This three-party bloc won 57 seats, leaving Clark four seats short of the 61 seats needed for a majority in the 121-seat Parliament (decreased from the expected 122 because the final results gave the Māori Party only one overhang seat, after it appeared to win two overhang seats on election night). On 5 October the Māori Party began a series of hui to decide whom to support. That same day reports emerged that a meeting between Helen Clark and Māori co-leader Tariana Turia on 3 October had already ruled out a formal coalition between Labour and the Māori Party. Māori Party representatives also held discussions with National representatives, but most New Zealanders thought the Māori Party more likely to give confidence-supply support to a Labour-dominated government because its supporters apparently heavily backed Labour in the party vote.

Had Turia and her co-leader Pita Sharples opted to join a Labour-Progressive-Green coalition, Clark would have had sufficient support to govern with support from a grouping of four parties (Labour, Green, Māori and Progressive). Without the Māori Party, Labour needed the support of New Zealand First (seven seats, down six) and United Future (three seats, down five) to form a government. New Zealand First said it would support (or at least abstain from opposing in confidence-motions) the party with the most seats. Clark sought from New Zealand First a positive commitment rather than abstention. United Future, which had supported the previous Labour-Progressive minority government in confidence and supply, said it would talk first to the party with the most seats about support or coalition. Both New Zealand First and United Future said they would not support a Labour-led coalition which included Greens in Cabinet posts. However, United Future indicated it could support a government where the Greens gave supply-and-confidence votes.

Brash had only one possible scenario to become Prime Minister: a centre-right coalition with United Future and ACT (two seats, down seven). Given the election results, however, such a coalition would have required the confidence-and-supply votes of both New Zealand First and the Māori Party. This appeared highly unlikely on several counts. New Zealand First&#x27;s involvement in such a coalition would have run counter to Peters&#x27; promise to deal with the biggest party, and Turia and Sharples would have had difficulty in justifying supporting National after their supporters&#x27; overwhelming support for Labour in the party vote. Turia and Sharples probably remembered the severe mauling New Zealand First suffered in the 1999 election. (Many of its supporters in 1996 believed they had voted to get rid of National, only to have Peters go into coalition &quot;with&quot; National; New Zealand First has never really recovered.) Even without this to consider, National had indicated it would abolish the Maori seats if it won power.

The new government as eventually formed consisted of Labour and Progressive in coalition, while New Zealand First and United Future entered agreements of support on confidence and supply motions. In an unprecedented move, Peters and Dunne became Foreign Affairs Minister and Revenue Minister, respectively, but remained outside cabinet and had no obligatory cabinet collective responsibility on votes outside their respective portfolios.

Possible government setups

== Background ==

The governing Labour Party retained office at 2002 election. However, its junior coalition partner, the Alliance, lost most of its support after internal conflict and disagreement and failed to win parliamentary representation. Labour formed a coalition with the new Progressive Coalition, formed by former Alliance leader Jim Anderton. The Labour-Progressive coalition then obtained an agreement of support (&quot;confidence and supply&quot;) from United Future, enabling it to form a stable minority government. The National Party, Labour&#x27;s main opponents, suffered a major defeat, winning only 21% of the vote (22.5% of the seats), its weakest showing in an election.

The collapse of National&#x27;s vote led ultimately to the replacement of its Parliamentary party leader Bill English with parliamentary newcomer Don Brash, the former governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, on 28 October 2003. Brash began an aggressive campaign against the Labour-dominated government. A major boost to this campaign came with his &quot;Orewa speech&quot; (27 January 2004), in which he attacked the Labour-dominated government for giving &quot;special treatment&quot; to the Māori population, particularly over the foreshore and seabed controversy. This resulted in a surge of support for the National Party, although most polls indicated that this subsequently subsided. National also announced it would not stand candidates in the Māori electorates, with some smaller parties following suit.

The foreshore-and-seabed controversy also resulted in the establishment of the Māori Party in July 2004. The Māori Party hoped to break Labour&#x27;s traditional (and then current) dominance in the Māori electorates, just as New Zealand First had done in the 1996 election.

A large number of so-called &quot;minor&quot; parties also contested the election. These included Destiny New Zealand (the political branch of the Destiny Church) and the Direct Democracy Party.

== Polls ==

A series of opinion polls published in June 2005 indicated that the National Party had moved ahead of Labour for the first time since June 2004. Commentators speculated that a prominent billboard campaign may have contributed to this. Some said the National Party had peaked too early. The polls released throughout July showed once more an upward trend for Labour, with Labour polling about 6% above National. The release by the National Party of a series of tax-reform proposals in August 2005 appeared to correlate with an increase in its ratings in the polls.

Direct comparisons between the following polls have no statistical validity:
No single political event can explain the significant differences between most of these polls over the period between them. They show either volatility in the electorate and/or flaws in the methods of polling. In the later polls, the issue of National&#x27;s knowledge of a series of pamphlets (distributed by members of the Exclusive Brethren and attacking the Green and Labour parties) appeared not to have reduced National Party support.

== Candidates ==

== Major policy platforms ==

=== Labour Party ===
The Labour Party platform included:
* student loans: writing off interest if the recipient stays in New Zealand
* health: a pledge of extra public-hospital operations
* Treaty of Waitangi: accepting no lodgements for Treaty-claims after 1 September 2008
* increasing rates-rebates
* a &quot;KiwiSaver&quot; program, aimed at getting first homeowners into their own homes
* sponsoring 5,000 new apprenticeships
* increasing community police-force numbers by 250.
* a &quot;Working for Families&quot; tax-relief/benefit programme aimed at lower to middle-income families

=== National Party ===
The National Party campaigned on the platform of (National Party Press Release):
* taxation: lowering income-tax rates. The party ran a television advertisement parodying the telethons aired by TVNZ in the 1980s, rewording the telethon theme song &quot;Thank you very much for your kind donation&quot; (itself a cover of the 1967 The Scaffolds song &quot;Thank U Very Much&quot;) to &quot;Thank you very much for your high taxation&quot;
* removing references to the Treaty of Waitangi from existing legislation; and resolving all treaty claims amicably by 2010
* by 1 April 2006, make student-loan repayments and $5000 of pre-school childcare costs recoupable to mainstream New Zealanders
* &quot;reworking&quot; the New Zealand Resource Management Act 1991 to make development easier
* &quot;removing excessive bureaucracy&quot; in the education system, in particular by overhauling the NCEA, and by re-introducing &quot;bulk funding&quot; of schools
* abolishing early parole for violent criminals. (As of 2005 most prisoners became eligible for parole after serving one-third of their sentence)
* a return to &quot;market rents&quot; for state-housing tenants, including a system of paying housing-subsidies (for the poorest tenants) directly to private landlords
* increase Nationwide Maths and English standards
* welfare Reform – reduce the waste of having 300,000 working age New Zealand adults on benefits and to ensure all of those on benefits really need the help
* a &quot;work-for-the-dole&quot; scheme
* abolishing the Maori electorates

== Voting ==
Postal voting for New Zealanders abroad began on 31 August. Ballot voting took place on Saturday 17 September, from 9am to 7pm. The Chief Electoral Office released a provisional result at 12:05am on 18 September.

== Party funding ==
New Zealand operates on a system whereby the Electoral Commission allocates funding for advertising on television and on radio. Parties must use their own money for all other forms of advertising, but may not use any of their own money for television or radio advertising.
*Must register for funding

== Controversies ==

Police investigated six political parties for alleged breaches of election-spending rules relating to the 2005 election, but brought no prosecutions,
determining that &quot;there was insufficient evidence to indicate that an offence under s214b of the Electoral Act had been committed.&quot;

The Auditor-General has also investigated publicly funded party-advertising for the 2005 election, with a leaked preliminary finding of much of the spending as unlawful. Observers expected the release of a final report in October 2006.

<text>In nuclear physics, an energy amplifier is a novel type of nuclear power reactor, a subcritical reactor, in which an energetic particle beam is used to stimulate a reaction, which in turn releases enough energy to power the particle accelerator and leave an energy profit for power generation. The concept has more recently been referred to as an accelerator-driven system (ADS) or accelerator-driven sub-critical reactor.

== History ==

Preceding the concept and the first achieved criticality in Chicago Pile-1, Columbia University physicists Enrico Fermi and Herbert L. Anderson worked at Princeton University with physicists Robert R. Wilson and Edward Creutz, developing the A-12 pile, a subcritical experiment similar to an energy amplifier. Nine kilograms of uranium oxide were embedded in a 490 kg graphite column, and spallation of beryllium by protons from the Princeton cyclotron was used as a neutron source. Most other pile experiments in this period, in both the United States and Germany, used alpha emitters such as radium-beryllium or radon-beryllium sources.

The concept is credited to Italian scientist Carlo Rubbia, a Nobel Prize particle physicist and former director of Europe&#x27;s CERN international nuclear physics lab. He published a proposal for a power reactor (nicknamed &quot;Rubbiatron&quot;) based on a proton cyclotron accelerator with a beam energy of 800 MeV to 1 GeV, and a target with thorium as fuel and lead as a coolant. Rubbia&#x27;s scheme also borrows from ideas developed by a group led by nuclear physicist Charles Bowman of the Los Alamos National Laboratory

== Principle and feasibility ==
The energy amplifier first uses a particle accelerator (e.g. linac, synchrotron, cyclotron or FFAG) to produce a beam of high-energy (relativistic) protons. The beam is directed to collide with nuclei of a heavy metal target, such as lead, thorium or uranium. Inelastic collisions between the proton beam and the target results in spallation, which produces twenty to thirty neutrons per event. It might be possible to increase the neutron flux through the use of a neutron amplifier, a thin film of fissile material surrounding the spallation source; the use of neutron amplification in CANDU reactors has been proposed. While CANDU is a critical design, many of the concepts can be applied to a sub-critical system. Thorium nuclei absorb neutrons, thus breeding fissile uranium-233, an isotope of uranium which is not found in nature. Moderated neutrons produce U-233 fission, releasing energy.

This design is entirely plausible with currently available technology, but requires more study before it can be declared both practical and economical.

OMEGA project () is being studied as one of methodology of accelerator-driven system (ADS) in Japan.

Richard Garwin and Georges Charpak describe the energy amplifier in detail in their book &quot;Megawatts and Megatons: A Turning Point in the Nuclear Age?&quot; (2001) on pages 153-163.

Earlier, the general concept of the energy amplifier, namely an accelerator-driven sub-critical reactor, was covered in &quot;The Second Nuclear Era&quot; (1985) pages 62–64, by Alvin M. Weinberg and others.

== Advantages ==

The concept has several potential advantages over conventional nuclear fission reactors:

* Subcritical design means that the reaction could not run away — if anything went wrong, the reaction would stop and the reactor would cool down. A meltdown could however occur if the ability to cool the core was lost.
* Thorium is an abundant element — much more so than uranium — reducing strategic and political supply issues and eliminating costly and energy-intensive isotope separation. There is enough thorium to generate energy for at least several thousand years at current consumption rates.
* The energy amplifier would produce very little plutonium, so the design is believed to be more proliferation-resistant than conventional nuclear power (although the question of uranium-233 as nuclear weapon material must be assessed carefully).
* The possibility exists of using the reactor to consume plutonium, reducing the world stockpile of the very-long-lived element.
* Less long-lived radioactive waste is produced — the waste material would decay after 500 years to the radioactive level of coal ash.
* No new science is required; the technologies to build the energy amplifier have all been demonstrated. Building an energy amplifier requires only engineering effort, not fundamental research (unlike nuclear fusion proposals).
* Power generation might be economical compared to current nuclear reactor designs if the total fuel cycle and decommissioning costs are considered.
* The design could work on a relatively small scale, and has the potential to load-follow by modulating the proton beam, making it more suitable for countries without a well-developed power grid system.
* Inherent safety and safe fuel transport could make the technology more suitable for developing countries as well as in densely populated areas.
* Desired nuclear transmutation could be employed deliberately (rather than as an unavoidable consequence of nuclear fission and neutron irradiation) either to transmute high level waste (such as long-lived fission products or minor actinides) into less harmful substances, for producing radionuclides for use in nuclear medicine or to produce precious metals from low-priced feedstocks.
* The lower fraction of delayed neutrons in the fission of compared to , which hampers the use of plutonium-containing fuels in critical reactors (which need to operate in the narrow band of neutron flux between prompt critical and delayed critical), is of no concern as no criticality of any kind is achieved or needed
* While nuclear reprocessing runs into the problem that MOX-fuel can not be further recycled for use in current light-water reactors as the reactor-grade plutonium concentration of fissile isotopes is not achieved due to impurities exceeding acceptable levels, all fissile and fertile isotopes of actinoids can be &quot;burned&quot; in a subcritical reactor, thus closing the nuclear fuel cycle without the need for fast breeder reactors

== Disadvantages ==
* Each reactor needs its own facility (particle accelerator) to generate the high energy proton beam, which is very costly. Apart from linear particle accelerators, which are very expensive, no proton accelerator of sufficient power and energy at has ever been built. Currently, the Spallation Neutron Source utilizes a proton beam to produce its neutrons, with upgrades envisioned to Its cost included research equipment not needed for a commercial reactor. Economies of scale might come into play if particle accelerators (which are currently only rarely built to the above mentioned strengths and then only for research purposes) become a more &quot;mundane&quot; technology. A similar effect can be observed when comparing the cost of the Manhattan Project up to the construction of Chicago Pile-1 to the costs of subsequent research or power reactors.
* The fuel material needs to be chosen carefully to avoid unwanted nuclear reactions. This implies a full-scale nuclear reprocessing plant associated with the energy amplifier.
* If, for whatever reason, neutron flux exceeds design specifications enough for the assembly to reach criticality, a criticality accident or power excursion can occur. Unlike a &quot;normal&quot; reactor, the scram mechanism only calls for the &quot;switching off&quot; of the neutron source, which wouldn&#x27;t help if more neutrons are constantly produced than consumed (i.e. Criticality), as there is no provision to rapidly increase neutron consumption e.g. via the introduction of a neutron poison.
* Using lead as a coolant has similar disadvantages to those described in the article on lead cooled fast reactors
* Many of the current spallation-based neutron sources used for research are &quot;pulsed&quot; i.e. they deliver very high neutron fluxes for very short durations of time. For a power reactor a smaller but more constant neutron flux is desired. The European Spallation Source will be the strongest neutron source in the world (measured by peak neutron flux) but will only be capable of very short (on the order of milliseconds) pulses.

<text>Tattershall is a village and civil parish in the East Lindsey district of Lincolnshire, England. It is situated on the A153 Horncastle to Sleaford road, east from the point where that road crosses the River Witham at Tattershall Bridge. At its eastern end, Tattershall adjoins the town of Coningsby, with the two being separated by the River Bain and is south-east from the hamlet Tattershall Thorpe.

Tattershall has a history dating back to Roman times. Robert Eudo, in 1201, by means of a present of a well-trained goshawk, obtained from Richard II of England a grant to hold a weekly market here; and his son Robert obtained from Henry III of England a licence to build a castle here, together with a grant of free-warren in all his Demesne lands. Tattershall was a settlement listed in the Domesday Book of 1086, in the hundred of Horncastle and the county of Lincolnshire.

The 2011 census recorded a Tattershall civil parish population as 2,834, with the combined Tattershall and Coningsby area having a population of 6,698.

==Community==
Local public houses are the Black Horse on the High Street and the Fortescue Arms in the Market Place. The Fortescue Arms dates from the 15th century and is a Grade II listed building. Barnes Wallis Academy (built 1954) is a secondary modern school on Butts Lane for pupils aged from 11 to 16. The school also serves Coningsby and Woodhall Spa.

The remaining wreckage of the Boeing 747-121 jet that was destroyed by a bomb, on 21 December 1988, over Lockerbie in Scotland is stored at a scrapyard near Tattershall. The remains include the aircraft&#x27;s nose and flight deck.

Tattershall Carrs is a remnant of ancient alder woodland, with bat roosts made of converted bomb shelters.

==Landmarks==
 Village historic sites include the church of the Holy Trinity, a buttercross, Tattershall Castle, Collegiate College, and Tom Thumb&#x27;s house and grave.

===Tattershall Castle===

Tattershall Castle was built in 1434 by Ralph de Cromwell, 3rd Baron Cromwell - Henry VI&#x27;s Lord High Treasurer - on the site of an earlier 13th-century stone castle, of which some remains are extant, particularly the Grand Tower and moat.

===Buttercross===

An octagonal 15th-century buttercross stands in the Market Place. It is both a Grade I listed structure and an ancient scheduled monument. A charter to hold a weekly market was granted by King John in 1201 in return for an annual fee of a trained goshawk. Markets are no longer held but the buttercross remains at the centre of a shopping area.

===Tattershall railway station===
Tattershall railway station was a station on the line between Boston and Lincoln until closure. The Old Station House, a stationmaster&#x27;s house and ticket office, is a Grade II listed building as is the former goods shed. The former railway line has been converted into a cycle path at a cost of £2 million. The path was officially opened in October 2008.

===Holy Trinity Collegiate Church===

Adjacent to the castle is the Grade I listed Perpendicular-style Holy Trinity Collegiate Church, endowed by Ralph Cromwell, 3rd Baron Cromwell, but built after his death. It originally had a choir (which was seven priests, six lay clerks and six boy choristers). It received its charter from Henry VI in 1439 but building was not begun until 1472, reaching completion around 1500. The church has medieval stained glass, a collection of monumental brasses and an intact rood loft. It was restored between 1893 and 1897.

Near the font is a plaque marking the grave of the Tattershall resident Tom Thumb, reputedly tall, who died in 1620 aged 101. Tom Thumb&#x27;s small house can be seen on the roof of a larger house in the Market Place.

The churchyard contains a war grave of an officer of the Dorsetshire Regiment who died during the Second World War. Ralph Cromwell, founder of the church, is also buried here.

===Tattershall College===

Adjacent to the Market Place are the remains of Tattershall College, which was built by Ralph Cromwell, 3rd Baron Cromwell for the education of the choristers of Holy Trinity Church. The college was an example of the Perpendicular style of Gothic architecture. In the late 18th century it was converted to a brewery, and later left empty – today it is a ruin. The walls that remain are supported by modern brick. Heritage Lincolnshire currently manages the site, which is Grade II* listed, and a scheduled ancient monument.

==Notable people==
The current Lord of the Manor of Tattershall is Julian Fellowes, actor, peer of the realm, screenwriter and youngest son of Peregrine Fellowes. The current Lady of the Manor, Emma Kitchener-Fellowes, is the great-great-niece of Lord Kitchener who was the adversary of Lord Curzon of Kedleston, the benefactor and restorer of Tattershall Castle. The most important English composer of the early 16th century, John Taverner, sang as a lay clerk at Holy Trinity Church in Tattershall for a time until he was appointed as &quot;informator choristarum&quot; at Cardinal College in 1526.

<text>William Roxburgh FRSE FRCPE FLS (3/29 June 1751 – 18 February 1815) was a Scottish surgeon and botanist who worked extensively in India, describing species and working on economic botany. He is known as the founding father of Indian botany. He published numerous works on Indian botany, illustrated by careful drawings made by Indian artists and accompanied by taxonomic descriptions of many plant species. Apart from the numerous species that he named, many species were named in his honour by his collaborators. He was the first to document the existence of the Ganges river dolphin.

==Early life==
He was born on 3 June 1751 on the Underwood estate near Craigie in Ayrshire and christened on 29 June 1751 at the nearby church at Symington.

His father may have worked in the Underwood estate or he may have been the illegitimate son of a well-connected family. His early education was at Underwood parish school perhaps also with some time at Symington parish school, and he probably also had private tutoring in Latin, as demonstrated by his letters and some descriptions.

He studied medicine at Edinburgh University and matriculated around 1771 or 1772. He lived with the well-connected family of Dr John Boswell, living at &quot;the back of the Meadows&quot; in south Edinburgh during this period. He studied surgery under Dr Alexander Monro and learnt botany under John Hope. His studies included mathematics and physics, which would make him interested in precise quantification later in life in studies on hemp.

He joined (as a surgeon&#x27;s mate) an East India Company ship &quot;Houghton&quot; in 1772 serving under surgeon Richard Ballantyne. He also served on the &quot;Queen&quot; in 1774. Several of these voyages took him to Madras and other ports in India. In 1776 he received his first doctorate (MD) from Edinburgh University.

He joined the Madras Medical Service as an Assistant Surgeon on 28 May 1776 and was promoted to the rank of Surgeon in 1780. He received a second doctorate (also MD) on 12 January 1790 from Marischal College in Aberdeen.

==Career==

Roxburgh began work in the Carnatic region from 1781 and replaced Patrick Russell as the Company Botanist in Madras in April 1789. His early work was on botany as superintendent in the Samalkot garden in the Northern Circars. Here he conducted economic botany experiments. He employed native artists to illustrate plants. He had 700 illustrations by 1790. He then succeeded Patrick Russell (1727–1805) as Naturalist to the Madras Government in April 1789. From 1793, he and Andrew Ross established a garden at Corcondah, where they worked on sugarcane and indigo. He also studied the prospects of introducing sago and other food crops to help alleviate the effect of famine. He was invited to fill the position of Superintendent at the Calcutta Botanical Garden where the death of Colonel Robert Kyd had created a vacancy. He made rapid progress and acquired a good reputation and was later invited by the government of Bengal, to take charge of the Calcutta Botanical gardens from Colonel Robert Kyd in 1793 as Superintendent of the Company garden at Sibpur near Calcutta. A catalogue of the garden was made in 1814 – &quot;Hortus Bengalensis&quot;. He was succeeded by Francis Buchanan-Hamilton.

He had sent many illustrations to Sir Joseph Banks, who in May 1795, started publishing &quot;Plants of the coast of Coromandel&quot; in 3 volumes with over 300 drawings and descriptions of plants. The last part was published in March 1820. The names of the local artists who produced the botanical illustrations were not recorded.

He meticulously collected vast amounts of meteorological data for years, and is considered as a pioneer in the collection of tropical meteorological data, to an extent unrivalled elsewhere until the 1820s. He had begun collecting detailed meteorological data as soon as he set foot in India, at Madras, and is known to have taken measurements three times a day, using Ramsden barometers and Nairne thermometers, made by then reputed scientific instrument makers, Jesse Ramsden and Edward Nairne. He trained under John Hope, who was the curator of the Edinburgh botanical garden as well an experimental physiologist. Roxburgh&#x27;s interest in systematic meteorology may have stemmed from the influence of John Hope as well as his experiences at the Royal Society of Arts which, in the early 1770s, was greatly influenced by the climatic theories of Stephen Hales and Duhamel du Monceau. Such detailed measurements over many years led him to form an opinion on widespread famine and climate change in the empire.

He became a member of the Asiatic Society, to whose Transactions he contributed, from time to time, many valuable papers. Amongst these was one of singular interest on the lacca insect, from which the substance lac is made.

In 1813, he returned to Scotland due to poor health. To recuperate from his illness before continuing his voyage to Scotland, he stopped at Saint Helena island on 7 June 1813 and left on 1 March 1814. Despite his poor health he produced an annotated list of Saint Helena plants during his stay. This list formed the only accessible printed account of the flora until 1875. This was published as an appendix to Beatson&#x27;s Tracts 1816.
He appears to have lived in, or close to, his original Edinburgh lodgings, then known as 4 Park Place or Street on the Meadows. He died there on 18 February 1815 and was buried nearby in Greyfriars Kirkyard. He was outlived by his third wife Mary.

==Recognition==

In 1791 he was erected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were William Wright, Daniel Rutherford and John Walker. In 1799 he was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society.

In 1802, Roxburgh was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society held in Philadelphia.

In 1805, he received the gold medal of the Society for the Promotion of Arts for a series of highly interesting and valuable communications on the subject of the productions of the East and a second gold medal in 1803 for a communication on the growth of trees in India. On 31 May 1814, he was presented, in the presence of a large assembly, a third gold medal by the Duke of Norfolk (then, the president of the Society of Arts).

Soon after receiving this last honourable testimony of high respect, Roxburgh returned to Edinburgh, where he later died. He was created Keeper of the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh on arrival until death.

==Posthumous honours==
In 1820, at the Mission Press in Serampore, William Carey posthumously edited and published vol. 1 of Dr. William Roxburgh&#x27;s &quot;Flora Indica; or Descriptions of Indian Plants&quot;. In 1824, Carey edited and published vol. 2 of Roxburgh&#x27;s &quot;Flora Indica&quot;, including extensive remarks and contributions by Dr. Nathaniel Wallich. Carey and Wallich continued to work in the field of botany and in 1834, both Carey and Wallich contributed botanical specimens to the Royal Society for Agriculture and Botany&#x27;s Winter Show in Ghent, Belgium.

&quot;Rosa roxburghii&quot; was initially named &quot;Rosa microphylla&quot; by Dr. Roxburgh in 1820, but because René Louiche Desfontaines had previously applied the name &#x27;microphylla&#x27; to an unrelated European species in 1798. The name was then changed in 1823 by (Austrian botanist) Leopold Trattinnick.

<doc id="934460" wikidata="Q5452629" url="?curid=934460" title="First Christian Church (Columbus, Indiana)">
<text>The First Christian Church (originally known as the Tabernacle Church of Christ) is a church in Columbus, Indiana, United States, built in 1942. It was the first contemporary building in Columbus and one of the first churches in the United States to be built in a contemporary architectural style.

The building, designed by Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen, consists of a glass-fronted main hall, with a tower and bridge section. Interior details such as light fixtures, screen and furniture were designed by Saarinen&#x27;s son Eero Saarinen (who would later design the North Christian Church in Columbus) and Charles Eames.

The building was designated a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service in 2001.

==Plans for a new church==
A larger church was needed to accommodate the growing needs of the congregation between World War I and World War II. Linnie I. Sweeney, the wife of Reverend Z. T. Sweeney, and her brother W. G. Irwin first discussed plans for a Gothic or Early American church, but her son and his nephew J. Irwin Miller, who had been following an architectural appreciation course at Yale University, proposed the idea for a Modern church instead. Designing and building the church became a two-generation family affair.

The family was introduced to Eliel Saarinen through the Reverend&#x27;s daughter Nettie Sweeney Miller, who became chairwoman of the building committee. Saarinen had only built one church before, in Estonia, and was apprehensive about the project until he heard the proposal for the building:

Saarinen, the son of a Lutheran pastor, was thrilled by the idea and agreed to design the building. He disliked overly indulgent and theatrical churches and believed Gothic and Georgian style churches were overdone and no longer relevant.

==Design==

Rather than imitating an historic style with no personal relevance to Columbus, Saarinen chose to reflect the fundamentals of Christian faith in the church design, in an effort to unite the different denominations in the town. He believed Modern architecture was particularly appropriate for this form of Christianity – the church would be based on the fundamentals of religion and architecture and freed from traditional theology and style.

===Layout===
The church is divided into four major features: the East Wing, containing the church proper, the chapel, and the auditorium; the West Wing, containing part of the Bible school; the connecting bridge between the East and West Wings, containing the rest of the Bible school; and the tower. The building is divided this way to create a balanced mass that is lively, yet restful.

===Sunken terrace===
The area between the East and West wings is set 8 feet below street level. The northern part of this sunken area contained a pool of 140 by 120 feet that was drained and filled in 1957 due to leaks. Today it contains a grassy area used for outdoor gatherings. The rest of the area forms a terrace that is bordered by the wings of the building on three sides and partially covered by the connecting bridge. The entire terrace is paved in a mosaic pattern and surrounded by plant and flowerbeds. Weather permitting, the area is used for church and Bible school activities.

===Tower===
The church tower was planned as a separate unit detached from the rest of the church, rising from the terrace level in an unbroken line of 166 feet. The base, measured at 17 by 23 feet, is located at the northeastern corner of the terrace pool.

The tower is designed in a simple, geometric form with plain brick walls that open into a perforated design at the top. The perforated section surrounds the sounding chamber from which the organ chimes are broadcast. The simple design of the tower gives it dignity and strength, and its separate placement in relation to the church proper provides balance to the building.

===Church proper===
The church proper, located on the northeastern corner of the property, is set on a platform reached from the street by a set of nine steps. The entrance leads to the narthex, to the right of which is a coatroom and to the left of which are stairs that lead to the gallery. Three doors connect the narthex to the church nave, one to the central aisle, the second to the side aisle, and the last to a low passage that connects the church with the Bible school.
The church proper was designed to create a serene, spatial atmosphere and thus has a unique asymmetrical design. Saarinen did not believe in forced symmetry because it created an artificial and sterile environment. Instead, he chose to focus on creating balance between various features and points of interest in the room. To this end, the cross at the end of the chancel is off center, but the communion table, integral to the service, is placed at the central axis of the church. Symmetry is used to accentuate the spirit of the service, instead of creating an artificial environment. Similarly, the middle aisle of the nave and the pulpit are slightly off center as well.

Unlike many traditional churches, there are no stained glass windows. Instead, Saarinen designed windows with the same pattern used in the perforated part of the tower, adding to the unity and natural symmetry of the building. The flow of light into the room was designed to highlight the serenity of the room. Daylight from the floor-to-ceiling windows light up the nave and chancel during morning services, adding to the spiritual nature of the service.

The church is 144 feet in length, 46 feet in width, and seats 580 people. With an additional rear gallery that holds 180 and a choir of 40, its total capacity is 800 individuals.

===Chapel===
The chapel, like the church, also features Saarinen&#x27;s asymmetrical design. Instead of a central aisle, there is a wide aisle on the west side and a narrow aisle on the east. Similar floor to ceiling windows provide light here too.

===Baptistry===
The Baptistry is placed at the rear of the chancel, screened from the audience with swinging doors. It is lit with daylight from the windows in the church proper, and the light flows above those being baptized. The use of natural light to light the ceremony symbolizes the belief in the natural arrangements of death, burial, and resurrection. Facilities like dressing rooms, showers, and toilets for men and women are located on the second floor above. 
===Organ===
The church organ was the latest model by the Aeolian-Skinner Organ Company at the time and consists of 4 manuals and pedals, 72 speaking stops, 4695 pipes, 61 harp bars, 25 chimes, and 73 other couplers and accessories. The size of pipes vary from 32 feet to ¾ of an inch long. It is housed in a chamber on the left of the chancel.

The organ was adapted to suit the needs of the church. It is based on an 18th-century organ with great tonal richness and clarity, but modern mechanical additions were made to make it easier to play. This resulted in an organ based on a classical foundation with enough flexibility to perform music of all periods.

===Tapestry===
The 35 by 11 ½ foot tapestry decorating the church was designed by Saarinen and woven by trained Scandinavian weavers under the direction of his wife, Loja Saarinen. Woven with wool and flax, it depicts the Sermon on the Mount in an image of animals and listeners. It was the largest tapestry in the country at the time.

===Auditorium and reception room===
The auditorium space is used for dinners, plays, and other entertainment involving a large number of people. The 500 seats can be stored under the stage to create an open space. Floor length windows open out into the terrace and pool for outdoor entertainment as well. The entire room is 92 feet long, 46 feet wide, and a little more than 12 feet high. The stage is 31 feet deep.

Connected to the auditorium is a reception room, used for a variety of activities and providing access to coat and toilet facilities. The room is 24 by 64 feet in size.

===Kitchen and offices===
The kitchen and pantry, an area of 900 square feet, is located on the East side of the East wing, arranged so that it does not interrupt church services and disturb the rest of the building. The office area adjacent to the East entrance hall consists of the Pastor&#x27;s study, the secretary&#x27;s office, a library, and a reception room.

<doc id="934470" wikidata="Q312709" url="?curid=934470" title="Kobayashi Issa">
<text>was a Japanese poet and lay Buddhist priest of the Jōdo Shinshū. He is known for his haiku poems and journals. He is better known as simply , a pen name meaning Cup-of-tea (lit. &quot;one [cup of] tea&quot;). He is regarded as one of the four haiku masters in Japan, along with Bashō, Buson and Shiki — &quot;the Great Four.&quot;

Reflecting the popularity and interest in Issa as man and poet, Japanese books on Issa outnumber those on Buson and almost equal in number those on Bashō.

== Biography ==
Issa was born and registered as Kobayashi Nobuyuki (小林 信之), with a childhood name of Kobayashi Yatarō (小林 弥太郎), the first son of a farmer family of Kashiwabara, now part of Shinano-machi, Shinano Province (present-day Nagano Prefecture). Issa endured the loss of his mother, who died when he was three. Her death was the first of numerous difficulties young Issa suffered. 

He was cared for by his grandmother, who doted on him, but his life changed again when his father remarried five years later. Issa&#x27;s half-brother was born two years later. When his grandmother died when he was 14, Issa felt estranged in his own house, a lonely, moody child who preferred to wander the fields. His attitude did not please his stepmother, who, according to Lewis Mackenzie, was a &quot;tough-fibred &#x27;managing&#x27; woman of hard-working peasant stock.&quot;

He was sent to Edo (present-day Tokyo) by his father one year later to make out a living. Nothing of the next ten years of his life is known for certain. His name was associated with Kobayashi Chikua (小林 竹阿) of the Nirokuan (二六庵) haiku school, but their relationship is not clear. During the following years, he wandered through Japan and fought over his inheritance with his stepmother (his father died in 1801). He wrote a diary, now called Last Days of Issa&#x27;s Father. 

After years of legal wrangles, Issa managed to secure rights to half of the property his father left. He returned to his native village at the age of 49 and soon took a wife, Kiku (菊). After a brief period of bliss, tragedy returned. The couple&#x27;s first-born child died shortly after his birth. A daughter, Satoyo (里世), died less than two-and-a-half years later, inspiring Issa to write this haiku (translated by Lewis Mackenzie):

:露の世は露の世ながらさりながら

:&quot;Tsuyu no yo wa tsuyu no yo nagara sari nagara&quot;

:This dewdrop world --
:Is a dewdrop world,
:And yet, and yet . . .

Issa married twice more late in his life, and through it all he produced a huge body of work.

A third child died in 1820. Then Kiku fell ill and died in 1823. &quot;Ikinokori ikinokoritaru samusa kana&quot; (生き残り生き残りたる寒さかな) [Outliving them,/Outliving them all,/Ah, the cold!] was written when Issa&#x27;s wife died, when he was 61.

He died on January 5, 1828, in his native village. According to the old Japanese calendar, he died on the 19th day of Eleventh Month, Tenth Year of the Bunsei era. Since the Tenth Year of Bunsei roughly corresponds with 1827, many sources list this as his year of death.

==Writings and drawings==
Issa wrote over 20,000 haiku, which have won him readers up to the present day. Though his works were popular, he suffered great monetary instability. His poetry makes liberal use of local dialects and conversational phrases, and &#x27;including many verses on plants and the lower creatures. Issa wrote 54 haiku on the snail, 15 on the toad, nearly 200 on frogs, about 230 on the firefly, more than 150 on the mosquito, 90 on flies, over 100 on fleas and nearly 90 on the cicada, making a total of about one thousand verses on such creatures&#x27;. By contrast, Bashō&#x27;s verses are comparatively few in number, about 2,000 in all. Issa&#x27;s haiku were sometimes tender, but stand out most for their irreverence and wry humor, as illustrated in these verses translated by Robert Hass: 

No doubt about it, 

the mountain cuckoo 

is a crybaby. 
New Year&#x27;s Day—

everything is in blossom!

I feel about average. 

Issa, &#x27;with his intense personality and vital language [and] shockingly impassioned verse...is usually considered a most conspicuous heretic to the orthodox Basho tradition&#x27;. Nevertheless, &#x27;in that poetry and life were one in him...[&amp;] poetry was a diary of his heart&#x27;, it is at least arguable that &#x27;Issa could more truly be said to be Basho&#x27;s heir than most of the haikai poets of the nineteenth century&#x27;.

Issa&#x27;s works include &quot;haibun&quot; (passages of prose with integrated haiku) such as &quot;&quot; (おらが春 &quot;My Spring&quot;) and &quot;Shichiban Nikki&quot; (七番日記 &quot;Number Seven Journal&quot;), and he collaborated on more than 250 renku (collaborative linked verse).

Issa was also known for his drawings, generally accompanying haiku: &quot;the Buddhism of the haiku contrasts with the Zen of the sketch&quot;. His approach has been described as &quot;similar to that of Sengai...Issa&#x27;s sketches are valued for the extremity of their abbreviation, in keeping with the idea of haiku as a simplification of certain types of experience.&quot;

One of Issa&#x27;s haiku, as translated by R.H. Blyth, appears in J. D. Salinger&#x27;s 1961 novel, &quot;Franny and Zooey&quot;:
:O snail
:Climb Mount Fuji,
:But slowly, slowly!

(&quot;Katatsumuri sorosoro nobore Fuji no yama&quot; 蝸牛そろそろ登れ富士の山)
The same poem, in Russian translation, served as an epigraph for a novel &quot;Snail on the Slope&quot; by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky (published 1966–68), also providing the novel&#x27;s title.

Another, translated by D.T. Suzuki, was written during a period of Issa&#x27;s life when he was penniless and deep in debt. It reads:

:ともかくもあなたまかせの年の暮
:&quot;tomokaku mo anata makase no toshi no kure&quot;

:Trusting the Buddha (Amida), good and bad,
:I bid farewell
:To the departing year.

Another, translated by Peter Beilenson with Harry Behn, reads:
:Everything I touch
:with tenderness, alas,
:pricks like a bramble.

Issa&#x27;s most popular and commonly known tome, titled &quot;The Spring of My Life&quot;, is autobiographical, and its structure combines prose and haiku.

==Kobayashi Issa former residence==

After a big fire swept through the post station of Kashiwabara on July 24, 1827, Issa lost his house and was forced to live in his &quot;kura&quot; (storehouse). &quot;The fleas have fled from the burning house and have taken refuge with me here&quot;, says Issa. Of this same fire, he wrote: &quot;Hotarubi mo amaseba iya haya kore wa haya&quot; (蛍火もあませばいやはやこれははや) If you leave so much/As a firefly&#x27;s glimmer, -/Good Lord! Good Heavens!&#x27;

This building, a windowless clay-walled structure, has survived, and was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1933.

<doc id="934496" wikidata="Q362585" url="?curid=934496" title="Terry Butcher">
<text>Terry Ian Butcher (born 28 December 1958) is an English football manager and former player.

During his playing career as a defender, Butcher captained the England national team, winning 77 caps in a ten-year international career that featured three FIFA World Cups. Butcher also enjoyed success in his club career, particularly with Ipswich Town and Rangers. He has subsequently managed clubs in England, Scotland, Australia and Wales and also had a brief spell in charge of the Philippines national team.

==Early life==
Born in Singapore, where his father was commissioned with the Royal Navy, Butcher spent most of his childhood in Lowestoft, Suffolk, where he attended Lowestoft Grammar School. He turned down the chance to join the Norwich City youth team, as he was a fan of East Anglian rivals Ipswich Town. He joined the Portman Road club in August 1976 after a three-week trial.

==Club career==
===Ipswich Town===
Butcher made his debut for Ipswich Town against Everton in the First Division on 15 April 1978 and over the next eight seasons would establish himself as the club&#x27;s top central defender, combining leadership with great aerial ability and courage. This was soon noticed by England manager Ron Greenwood who gave him his debut in a friendly against Australia in 1980.

In 1981, Butcher was part of the Ipswich side that won the UEFA Cup under Bobby Robson and came close to their first League title since 1962, though they were pipped at the post by Aston Villa.

Butcher was named Player of the Year in 1985 and 1986, the latter season seeing Ipswich relegated to the Second Division.

===Rangers===
In 1986, Butcher left Ipswich when they were relegated, and became one of the first &#x27;English invasion&#x27; players to join Scottish club Rangers following the appointment of Graeme Souness as manager. Souness, the former Liverpool player, paid Ipswich £725,000 for him in July 1986. As captain, he led them to three League titles in four seasons, plus two Scottish League Cups.

In November 1987 he broke his leg during a Scottish Premier Division fixture against Aberdeen, which ruled him out for the rest of the season. In April 1988 Butcher was convicted of disorderly conduct and breach of the peace due to his behaviour in an Old Firm match in October 1987. He was fined £250. In October 1988 Butcher was the subject of a police investigation when he kicked the referee&#x27;s room door off its hinges after a match at Pittodrie. No criminal charges were brought, but the SFA fined Butcher £1500. Butcher was the subject of a £1million bid from Manchester United in July 1988, but this was rejected by Rangers.

His last Rangers game came in September 1990, in a 2–1 league defeat against Dundee United. He was partly responsible for both of the opposition&#x27;s goals, leading to him being dropped from the side. In November 1990, he was approached by Leeds United, and came close to signing for the Elland Road club, but was then offered job as player-manager of Coventry City.

===Coventry City===
Leeds United manager Howard Wilkinson was soon in talks with Graeme Souness about bringing Butcher back south of the border, but when Butcher did depart from Ibrox it was in a £400,000 deal to become player-manager of Coventry City on 15 November 1990. One of his first games as Coventry manager was against the Leeds side he had come close to signing for, holding them to a 1–1 league draw at Highfield Road on 24 November. Other promising early results included a thrilling 5–4 home win over cup holders Nottingham Forest in the Football League Cup fourth round on 28 November. However, their quest for the League Cup ended in the quarter-finals on 23 January 1991 when they were beaten 1–0 at home by eventual winners Sheffield Wednesday. Six days later their FA Cup was ended in a fourth round replay defeat by Southampton

Butcher made six league appearances for the Sky Blues as they finished 16th in the 1990–91 First Division and then retired as a player. In the 1991–92 season, Coventry defeated Luton Town 5–0 in their second league game and achieved a surprise 2–1 away win over defending league champions Arsenal, as well as a 1–0 home win over local rivals Aston Villa- to occupy sixth place in the league by the end of September, putting them ahead of more fancied teams including Liverpool and Everton. However, their form dropped over the next two months, and by the end of November they had fallen to 13th place. A 2–1 home defeat by Tottenham Hotspur on New Year&#x27;s Day 1992 saw them enter the new year in 15th place, six points clear of the relegation zone.

Butcher was dismissed on 6 January 1992 after just over a year as Coventry City manager, being replaced by his recently appointed assistant Don Howe.

===Later career===
Butcher re-registered himself as a player in August 1992, when he signed for Sunderland – founder members of the new Division One, which was the second tier of English football following the creation of the new FA Premier League. He played 38 times for the Wearside club in 1992–93, becoming player-manager following the dismissal of manager Malcolm Crosby in January 1993 and securing their Division One survival by a single place. He never played again for the club and was sacked on 26 November 1993 after a disappointing start to the 1993–94 season saw them battling relegation once again – with the battle being won under Butcher&#x27;s successor Mick Buxton.

Butcher then played three games for Clydebank before retiring as a player.

==International career==

Butcher&#x27;s performances for Ipswich were noticed by England manager Ron Greenwood, who gave him his debut in a friendly against Australia on 31 May 1980, when he was 21 years old. He won his second cap 10 months later in a 2–1 defeat against Spain (also a friendly).

Butcher was the youngest member of the back four that featured at the 1982 World Cup in Spain. He became a regular member of the national side at this stage and remained England&#x27;s first choice centre-back for the rest of the decade, playing in the 1986 World Cup. In that tournament he played in the quarter final against Argentina in which Diego Maradona passed five English players before scoring, a goal sometimes described as the &#x27;goal of the century&#x27;.

A broken leg meant that Butcher was not in the England side that exited at the group stage of the 1988 European Championship while manager Robson was forced to rely on an inexperienced defensive partnership of Tony Adams and Mark Wright.

While playing for England in a vital World Cup qualifier against Sweden in Stockholm on 6 September 1989, Butcher suffered a deep cut to his forehead early in the game. Butcher had some impromptu stitches inserted by the physiotherapist and, swathed in bandages, continued playing. His constant heading of the ball – unavoidable when playing in the centre of defence – disintegrated the bandages and reopened the cut to the extent that his white England shirt was red with blood by the end of the game. The image is regarded as iconic.

England made the semi-finals of the 1990 World Cup with Butcher at the helm of a more-cautious back five (Butcher with Wright and Des Walker in the centre, plus full-backs Stuart Pearce and – initially – Gary Stevens, later Paul Parker); he also took over the captaincy after an injury ended Bryan Robson&#x27;s tournament prematurely. After the World Cup, Butcher retired from international football with 77 caps and three goals to his name over a period of 10 years.

==Managerial career==
===Coventry City===
Butcher left Rangers on 15 November 1990 to become player-manager of Coventry City (as successor to John Sillett). At one month short of 32 he was the youngest manager in the Football League on his appointment.

Under Sillett, Coventry had won the FA Cup in 1987 and finished as high as seventh in the First Division in 1989, but a dismal start to the 1990–91 season had seen Coventry fall back into the relegation battle that had been all too familiar occurrence at Highfield Road since Coventry first reached the top flight in 1967. With Butcher&#x27;s appointment as manager, Coventry were intent on returning to their winning ways. Butcher steered Coventry to 16th place and safety in 1990–91, and they entered 1992 in 13th place, but he was sacked as manager on 6 January 1992.

Butcher had played six league games for Coventry in the 1990–91 season before announcing his retirement as a player.

===Sunderland===
In February 1993, Butcher was named manager of Sunderland, re-registering himself as a player two years after his last game. He achieved survival at the end of the 1992–93 season, but was sacked the following December.

===Motherwell===
In October 2001, Butcher became assistant to Eric Black at Motherwell in the Scottish Premier League, taking over from Black a year later as the club was forced to deal with severe financial difficulties, and Butcher has been praised by the club&#x27;s supporters and media for his performance under those difficult circumstances. Motherwell reached the 2005 Scottish League Cup Final, where his old team Rangers defeated them 5–1.

===Sydney===
After being linked for several weeks with a possible move to Sydney FC, Butcher was announced as their new head coach on 17 May 2006, signing a two-year contract. On 7 February 2007, he was sacked after the club were knocked out of the finals series with a 3–2 aggregate loss to the Newcastle Jets.

===Brentford===
On 30 March 2007, Butcher was appointed as assistant coach at Partick Thistle. However, this was a short lived appointment as he became the manager of Brentford on 24 April 2007 (he officially took up the role on 7 May 2007).

After a poor run of results, including only 5 wins in 23 matches, and under increasing pressure from the fans who had been chanting the name of former boss Martin Allen, he left Brentford on 11 December 2007.

===Scotland national team===
Butcher was named as George Burley&#x27;s assistant in 2008 during Scotland&#x27;s World Cup 2010 qualifying campaign. Butcher still harboured resentment for Maradona&#x27;s Hand of God goal against England 22 years earlier. So in the days leading up to a friendly against Argentina, managed by Diego Maradona, Butcher&#x27;s views on Maradona were a talking point in the media. Butcher said in interviews that Maradona was a cheat and a liar, and he would be happy to see him lose. Scotland lost the game 1–0. When Maradona was asked about what Butcher had said about him, he replied &quot;Who is Butcher?&quot;

In November 2009 George Burley was sacked as Scotland manager and at the same time Butcher left by mutual consent.

===Inverness Caledonian Thistle===
On 27 January 2009, Butcher was appointed manager of Inverness Caledonian Thistle, signing an 18-month contract while also continuing his role as assistant manager to George Burley for the Scotland national team. Butcher was joined in Inverness by Maurice Malpas as his assistant manager. In May 2009, Inverness were relegated from the Scottish Premier League. 
After a bad start to the 2009–10 First Division league campaign, Butcher managed to turn things around for Inverness. By the end of March, Butcher had guided his club from 16 points behind league leaders Dundee, to four points ahead and top of the Scottish First Division. He was awarded the &quot;Irn Bru Phenomenal&quot; manager of the month award for March. Inverness won the Irn Bru First Division on 21 April after Dundee were beaten 1–0 by Raith Rovers clinching Inverness&#x27;s return to the Scottish Premier League. As of 2025, Butcher was the last manager in the club to lead the team to promotion.

As part of the push for promotion in 2009–10, ICT went on an unbeaten away run in the league that continued through the entire 2010 calendar year, culminating in a 1–1 draw against Hearts at Tynecastle on 18 December. In April 2010 his contract was extended to the end of the 2011–12 season. In the SPL 2010–11 season, the club finished seventh, only narrowly missing out on a top six finish. Butcher was inducted to the Scottish Football Hall of Fame in November 2011.

In the 2012–13 season Butcher received a manager of the month award for a second time in November, along with two Inverness players Aaron Doran and Billy McKay, having receiving it for October in the 2010–11 season. This was explained due to winning three matches (including away to Celtic) and drawing another, despite the other fixture in the month being a 5–1 defeat to Motherwell and he led the club into second place by the end of 2012. Butcher expressed his delight with the club staying in second place and also his pleasure with the defenders, who were becoming more prominent than his free-scoring forward line.

In January 2013, Butcher rejected an offer to manage Barnsley, having been linked to succeed Keith Hill. After rejecting Barnsley, Butcher explained that one of his reasons for staying was his belief that the club could make history and that he was happy to continue his stay in Scotland. His decision to stay was greeted with relief by defender Daniel Devine, who had signed for the club earlier that month.

Butcher&#x27;s efforts in guiding Inverness to their top six finish were recognised when he was nominated in the four-man shortlist for PFA Scotland Manager of the Year.

===Hibernian===
On 5 November 2013, Inverness confirmed that they had received an official approach from fellow Premiership side Hibernian to replace former manager Pat Fenlon with Butcher. On 11 November, Hibernian reached a compensation deal with Inverness for Terry Butcher to move to the club, alongside assistant manager Maurice Malpas. Butcher agreed to a three-year contract, and his appointment was confirmed by the club on 12 November.

A week after Butcher&#x27;s departure, Inverness supporters responded to his departure with &quot;Terry who?&quot; in the match against St Johnstone. On 2 January 2014, Butcher won the first Edinburgh derby of his managerial career, as they won 2–1. Butcher failed to sign any players in mid-January until signing Daniel Boateng, Danny Haynes and Duncan Watmore on the last day of the transfer window.

As the months progressed, Hibernian&#x27;s results went badly. His predecessor, Pat Fenlon, had left the team in a mid-table position, but a series of bad performances led to Butcher apologising and supporters describing his tactics as &quot;gutless&quot;, &quot;passionless&quot; and &quot;clueless&quot;. Hibernian dropped to the bottom half in the league, putting them at risk of relegation. Defeats in the bottom half for Hibernian led Butcher to cancel players&#x27; day-off. Further defeats to Ross County and Kilmarnock placed Hibernian eleventh place and facing the play-offs to keep their Premiership place.

On 25 May 2014 Hibernian were relegated to the Scottish Championship, losing a two-leg playoff against Hamilton Academical. After the match, Butcher described Hibernian relegation as his &quot;darkest day in football&quot;. Butcher was criticised by James McPake, who Butcher replaced as captain with Liam Craig, for not selecting him to play despite being fit. After a meeting with new chief executive Leeann Dempster to discuss Hibs&#x27; future plans, Butcher was sacked by the club on 10 June 2014. There were also rumours of Butcher losing the dressing room and then asking players to leave the club in the January transfer window, only to use them to help the club survive relegation.

Butcher interviewed for the vacant managerial position at Motherwell in December 2014, but then asked not to be considered for the position.

===Newport County===
On 30 April 2015 Butcher was appointed manager of Welsh club Newport County in League Two on a two-year contract. He took up the role at the end of the 2014–15 season in preparation for the following season, but was sacked on 1 October 2015 with Newport bottom of League Two after gaining just five points from the first ten matches of the season.

===Philippines===
On 14 June 2018, Butcher was announced as the new head coach of the Philippines. In 2016, he almost got appointed as head coach of Global Cebu which was set to play in the inaugural edition of the Philippines Football League, but the club favoured Japanese coach Toshiaki Imai instead. He was due to lead the Philippines national team in the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, but on 2 August 2018, he announced that he will not take the role as head coach of the national team because he did not believe the system is in place for his time in charge of the Philippines to be successful. His assistant coach, Scott Cooper took over his post and take charge of the team&#x27;s 2019 Asian Cup preparations.

===Guangzhou R&amp;F===
On 26 July 2019 it was confirmed, that Butcher had joined the coaching staff of Chinese club Guangzhou R&amp;F to help fix the teams leaky defence. He was hired as a defensive coach.

===Return to Ipswich Town===
In February 2020 it was announced that Butcher would be taking up a new role with Ipswich Town, primarily working with the club&#x27;s academy whilst also having some involvement with the first-team, but he left the club again in July 2021.

Butcher has appeared as a pundit for England matches on BBC Radio Five Live, Europa League matches on Five and on Setanta Sports&#x27; SPL coverage. Butcher also worked for BBC Sport during the 2006 World Cup.

Butcher consistently raised concerns over the sum impact of David Beckham&#x27;s performances for and involvement with the England national football team, most notably during discussions concerning team and squad selection questions for the 2006 World Cup and Euro 2008 qualification campaign.

<doc id="934504" wikidata="Q6517474" url="?curid=934504" title="Contra-alto clarinet">
<text>The contra-alto clarinet, E♭ contrabass clarinet, is a large clarinet pitched a perfect fifth below the B♭ bass clarinet. It is a transposing instrument in E♭ sounding an octave and a major sixth below its written pitch, between the bass clarinet and the B♭ contrabass clarinet.

The contra-alto clarinet is often used in clarinet choirs and ensembles of clarinets and saxophones. It may also be present in a wind band. The repertoire for contra-alto clarinet in the symphony orchestra is limited. In ensembles it is usually used in unison with the other woodwind instruments, such as (bassoon, bass clarinet and contrabass clarinet), or it plays the lower octave in addition. 

== History ==

The contra-alto clarinet is largely a development of the 2nd half of the 20th century, although there were some precursors in the 19th century:
* In 1829, , an instrument maker in Göttingen, introduced an instrument tuned in F in the shape and fingering of a basset horn, which could be called a horn because it played an octave lower than it.
* Around 1890 the Belgian clarinet maker Eugène Albert or his son E. J. Albert also developed an alto clarinet in F, but without the additional basset notes typical of the basset horn notated C to it.
* In 1851, Adolphe Sax applied for a patent for an instrument, he called &quot;contrabass clarinet in E♭&quot; in order to replace the bowed contrabass of symphony orchestras in wind bands with an instrument whose lowest sounding note is contra-G or G1, like the contrabass. This is the case with a contra clarinet tuned in E♭, whose written lowest tone is the small E♭ (E-flat3), as with most clarinets. The pitch of this instrument today identifies it as a contra alto clarinet. However, it never came onto the market.
* Around 1880 the Italian clarinet maker Alessandro Maldura built a contra alto clarinet in E of grenadilla wood with 14 keys, 1.93 m long, which he called &quot;Clarone grande&quot;, exhibited at the 1881 Italian National Exhibition in Milan.

===20th century===
* built two models of a contra-alto clarinet in E-flat, Model 350 and 352, from metal. Model 350 was in a curved shape (known as a &quot;paperclip&quot;) and went to written low C. These models also have three trill keys on the right side of the upper joint. The curved shape makes the instrument much easier to transport than the traditional straight, non-dismantled model. Model 352 was straight in a bass clarinet-shape to written low E♭.

Other makers of contra-alto clarinets have developed mainly stretched models. These include:
* Henri Selmer Paris
** Model 26/40 in rosewood to written E, E♭, or D
* Buffet Crampon
** Metal model patented in 1891 for Evette and Schaeffer (patent FR218373/5)
** Model Prestige 1553 made of grenadilla, 19 keys.
* Conn-Selmer USA (1980 onwards), Bundy (from 1964 to 1980), Buescher ( 1968–1969): model 1440 made of ebonite, to written E♭ (written), with 18 keys and 7 plateau keys.
* Leblanc USA / Vito: Model L7181 in Reso-Tone material to E flat (written).
* Ripamonti, Italian manufacturer: model 322 in rosewood, to d (written).
* Martin Frères Company
** EE-3488 model in ABS
** EE-3434 model in ebonite
* Harry Pedler, Inc. (Elkhart, IN) was by late 1926 making a contrabass clarinet—presumably an E flat contra-alto.

Today&#x27;s contra-alto clarinets are mainly based on the Boehm system, although models with the German system also existed in the past.

== Description and technique ==

The range of most contra-alto clarinets extends downwards to its low E♭ (concert G♭1). Some models go down to D (concert F1) or C (concert E♭1). For this the instrument must be longer and have additional keys which the player operates with the right thumb and/or little fingers (as with the basset horn). In the altissimo range, the fingerings on the contra-alto clarinet are sometimes different from those on the higher clarinets.

Modern contra-alto clarinets have a double (or even triple) automatic stop key. 

The contra-alto clarinet has a curved bell, mainly made of metal, which is necessary for sound projection. It is located in the lowest part of the instrument. On the curved clarinets (&quot;paper clip&quot;) the bell is in the upper part of the instrument.

The instrument can be played sitting down or standing up with the help of a peg or a strap.

In orchestration, the contra-alto clarinet&#x27;s playing is as fast as that of the bass clarinet. Unlike other low wind instruments (contrabassoon, tuba, ...) it can play a wide range of nuances from &quot;fff&quot; to &quot;ppp&quot; and articulations (&quot;legato&quot;, &quot;staccato&quot;, slap, ...). In contemporary music, composers use its ability to produce polyphonic sounds. 

== Length ==
The length of the tube (without bell) ranges from about 190 centimeters for a contra-alto clarinet, which lowest written tone is E♭, and up to about 230 centimeters for an instrument down to C.

== Repertoire ==

As the contra-alto clarinet is a relatively young instrument, its repertoire is limited and much smaller than that of the contrabass clarinet. It is represented in all musical styles that emerged after the end of the 19th century, from neoclassicism, New Music, jazz and contemporary music to experimental rock. 

In the mid-1960s, pieces in which contra-alto clarinets were also used were said to be heard even from the loudspeakers of small television sets. The instrument was also in Hollywood: early episodes of The Twilight Zone, Star Trek 

Given the limited written repertoire in orchestras and ensembles, contra-alto clarinets can play in unison with other low wind instruments or provide a foundation in the lower octave to the woodwinds playing higher (organ pedal effect).

Parts for baritone saxophone in E♭ for wind bands can also be used for contra-alto clarinet. There are also transcriptions and transpositions of pieces written for low instruments in C, such as double bass, bass guitar, bassoon, and tuba.

In the publishing houses, part of the repertoire of the contra-alto clarinet is shared with that of the contrabass clarinet.

=== Neoclassicism ===
* Lien, Fantastic Scherzo with Piano.
* Siennicki, Nocturne with piano.
* Bret Newton, Three Songs for Contra Alto Clarinet and Piano.

=== Contemporary solo and chamber music ===
* Zeno Baldi: &quot;copia carbone&quot; for ensemble incl. contralto clarinet and electronics
* Chris Dench: &quot;Funk&quot; for contralto clarinet and percussion
* Davide Ianni: &quot;Dedalo Nero&quot; for contralto clarinet solo
* Bernhard Lang: &quot;Das Hirn&quot; for soprano and ensemble incl. ossia part for contralto clarinet

=== Clarinet ensemble ===
* Dick Hyman, &quot;Sextet for Clarinets&quot;.

=== Wind orchestra ===
* Lucien Cailliet is known for his arrangements for wind orchestra and clarinet ensemble, combining over 6 octaves of different clarinets from the E♭ sopranino to the contra-alto clarinet. The contra-alto clarinet is regularly used in professional wind orchestras.

Americans became aware of the importance of instrumentation during the 20th century to give instruments such as the contra-alto clarinet a place in the brass band (in English &quot;military band&quot; or &quot;concert band&quot;).

=== Arrangements ===
There are arrangements for this instrument drawn from the repertoire for other low wind instruments (tuba, bassoon, ...).
* Andrea Catozzi, &quot;Beelzebub&quot; (Varied programme for tuba solo).

== CD recordings with contra-alto clarinet ==
Recordings in which the contra-alto clarinettist appears as a soloist or chamber musician are extremely rare. A compact disc of duets for contra-alto and contrabass clarinets was recorded in 2018.

<doc id="934513" wikidata="Q14688505" url="?curid=934513" title="Irwin Conference Center">
<text>The Irwin Conference Center (formerly known as Irwin Union Bank) was designed by Eero Saarinen and built in 1954 in Columbus, Indiana, United States. It is currently owned and operated by Cummins, whose world headquarters is located across Jackson Street in the Cummins Corporate Office Building. In recognition of its unique and beautiful design, the resource was designated a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service in 2001.

The building consists of a one-story bank structure and adjacent three-story office annex. A portion of the office annex was built along with the banking hall in 1954. The remaining, much larger portion, designed by Kevin Roche, John Dinkeloo and Associates, was built in 1973.

==History==
Irwin Miller became president of the Irwin Union Trust Company after his father&#x27;s death in 1947. Three years later, he commissioned Eero Saarinen to design a new building for the bank. The building was designed to distance the Irwin Union Bank from traditional banking architecture, which mostly echoed imposing, neoclassical style buildings of brick or stone. Miller wanted the building to symbolize the bank&#x27;s progressive mission, which included offering some of the first credit cards and earliest drive-through banking. Instead of having tellers behind iron bars and removed from their customers, Saarinen worked to develop a building that would welcome customers rather than intimidate them.

The structure has changed ownership twice since 2008 and is now operated by the corporate hospitality division of Cummins.

==Design==
The glass building may look simple, but like all Saarinen&#x27;s projects, every aspect of the space was designed after extensive research of its use. The ceiling was designed at in height so the space would not feel oppressive. A freestanding structure for files occupies the center in the building, so that the office floor would be open and uncluttered. The colorful counters where tellers worked were equipped with removable plastic hoods when traffic demanded additional counters. A small elevator and spiral staircase gave tellers secure access to the cash vault below and two steel and glass vestibules connect the glass pavilion to the three-story office annex, where customers could transact business privately.

The grid of large domes on the roof of the bank was a source of amusement for the townspeople, who jokingly called the bank a &quot;brassiere factory&quot;. Nevertheless, they loved the building and customers increased fourfold.

== Landscape ==
The bank building only occupied one-third of the site, the rear portion housed a drive-through window and large parking lot surrounded and intersected with trees. Landscape architect Dan Kiley chose specific types of trees and foliage in order to integrate the bank with its neighboring buildings and help shade the inside of the bank. He used littleleaf linden trees as the basis of the space, with euonymus as ground cover and seasonal spring bulbs, begonias, geraniums, and chrysanthemums as accents.

The goal was to create a green space in the middle of downtown Columbus and provide the city with some breathing room. Since the bank building is lower than the surrounding buildings, its landscape feels more park-like. As the number of automobiles on the streets grew in the early 1950s, spaces like this helped relieve the congestion of busy downtown areas.

== Bank closure ==
On September 18, 2009, the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions closed the Irwin Union Bank and Trust Company and named the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as receiver. First Financial Bank of Hamilton, Ohio, purchased all deposits and virtually all assets of Irwin Union Bank and participated in a loss-share transaction jointly with the FDIC. The FDIC estimated that the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) for both institutions was $850 million.

== Cummins ownership ==
In 2010, Cummins purchased the building from First Financial and announced its intention to remodel the bank and associated buildings at a cost of $5.25 million. First Financial would continue to occupy the building until its new facility is completed in 2012. Cummins then expects to complete renovations by summer 2014. The Saarinen-designed structure will be used for a corporate conference center and meeting space.

<text>Enzo G. Baldoni (October 8, 1948 – August 26, 2004) was an Italian journalist working freelance and for the Italian news magazine &quot;Diario&quot; before being kidnapped and killed in captivity as captured on video by his captors. Baldoni was one of two Italians kidnapped in Iraq.

==Personal life==
Baldoni was born in Città di Castello, Umbria. He had arrived in Baghdad a few weeks before his kidnapping and death, and also served there as a Red Cross volunteer. He was married with two children.

==Career==
Baldoni had started his career in diverse jobs including working as a mason (in Belgium), a gymnastics professor, photographer, interpreter and laboratory technician. He then moved into advertising, working for the advertising agency &quot;Le balene colpiscono ancora&quot; (&quot;The whales strike again&quot;). Finally, he became a freelance journalist. He was also a translator, and was responsible for the Italian translation of &quot;Doonesbury&quot; comic strips.

==Kidnapping and death==
He was kidnapped near Najaf, Iraq, 19 August 2004 by the Islamic Army in Iraq, an Iraqi insurgent group, allegedly linked with Al-Qaeda. His driver-interpreter was killed during the abduction. The Islamic Army released a videotape, aired on August 24 by Al Jazeera, in which it threatened to kill Baldoni unless Italian troops were withdrawn from Iraq within 48 hours. On August 26, Al Jazeera came into possession of a videotape depicting Baldoni&#x27;s murder. This videotape was not aired because of its gruesome nature. The existence of this tape is based on claims made by Al Jazeera only. Other sources claim it is only a video frame or a still shot taken with a digital camera.

Al-Jazeera did not elaborate on how or where Baldoni was killed.

<doc id="934519" wikidata="Q289222" url="?curid=934519" title="Maros-Torda County">
<text>Maros-Torda was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. Its territory is now in central Romania (eastern Transylvania) and has been administratively succeeded by county Mureș which consist of about half the territory of the previous Maros-Torda administrative county. Its county seat was Marosvásárhely (present-day Târgu Mureș).

==Geography==

Maros-Torda county shared borders with the Hungarian counties Kolozs, Beszterce-Naszód, Csík, Udvarhely, Kis-Küküllő and Torda-Aranyos. The river Mureș flowed through the county. Its area was 4,188 km2 around 1910.

==History==
Maros-Torda county was formed in 1876 on the territory of the Székely seat of Marosszék and part of Torda County. In 1920, after the Treaty of Trianon, the county became part of Romania, except after the Second Vienna Award, between 1940 until the end of World War II, when much of the county&#x27;s territory was awarded to Hungary. Today, its territory lies in the present (larger) Romanian county Mureș.

==Subdivisions==

Around 1910, the subdivisions of Maros-Torda county were:

<doc id="934520" wikidata="Q16247812" url="?curid=934520" title="Huddersfield Broad Canal">
<text>The Huddersfield Broad Canal or Sir John Ramsden&#x27;s Canal, is a wide-locked navigable canal in West Yorkshire in northern England. The waterway is 3.75 miles (6 km) long and has 9 wide locks. It follows the valley of the River Colne and connects the Calder and Hebble Navigation at Cooper Bridge junction with the Huddersfield Narrow Canal near Aspley Basin in Huddersfield.

Construction was authorised in 1774, and the canal opened two years later. It became part of a trans-Pennine route in 1811 when the Huddersfield Narrow Canal joined it at Aspley Basin. Traffic was hampered by the long narrowboats used on the narrow canal that could not use Ramsden&#x27;s Canal&#x27;s shorter locks. Goods were transhipped at Aspley Basin, and although shorter narrowboats were built, its success as a trans-Pennine route was overshadowed by the Rochdale Canal which had wide locks throughout and joined the Calder and Hebble Navigation at Sowerby Bridge. The canal passed into railway ownership in 1845, but prospered into the 20th century. Railway ownership ceased in 1945, when it was bought by the Calder and Hebble Navigation, at which point the narrow canal across the Pennines was abandoned. The broad canal carried commercial traffic, particularly coal for power stations, until 1953.

After the formation of British Waterways in 1962, the canal was designated a cruiseway in 1968, which meant that it was mainly for leisure traffic. Use of the canal has increased significantly since the Huddersfield Narrow Canal re-opened in 2001, as it is no longer a dead end. Many of its structures have been given listed building status, in recognition of their historic importance.

==History==
The canal appears to have been planned for some time before it was authorised, as the Calder and Hebble Navigation obtained an act of Parliament, the Calder and Hebble Navigation Act 1757 (31 Geo. 2. c. 72), for its canal in 1758, which included a clause to prevent interference with any future navigation &quot;from the Mouth of the River Coln to the town of Huddersfield&quot;. In 1766, Robert Whitworth surveyed a route for such a canal, and the Calder and Hebble Navigation Act 1769 (9 Geo. 3. c. 71) contained a similar clause. A second survey was carried out in 1773 by Luke Holt and Joseph Atkinson for the Ramsden family, who owned the whole of Huddersfield at the time and keen to develop the canal. The family also owned roughly one-third of the land along the proposed route of the canal. Holt had worked on the construction of the Calder and Hebble above Cooper Bridge.

Atkinson presented evidence for the bill to the parliamentary committee, being somewhat less than truthful when he stated that Huddersfield was &#x27;the only market for narrow woolen cloths&#x27; in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The estimated cost of its construction was £8,000, and it was expected to take one year to complete. Profits were limited by the act, which stipulated that the tolls must be cut as the profits increased. Commissioners were to be appointed, with powers to examine the canal accounts and ensure compliance. In order to prevent water drawn by the canal from interfering with the operation of local mills, the upper were made deeper than the rest of the canal, to provide a reservoir of water.
===Construction===

The canal was authorised by an act of Parliament, the (14 Geo. 3. c. 13), obtained on 9 March 1774, which enabled &quot;Sir John Ramsden, Baronet, to make and maintain a navigable Canal from the River Calder, between a Bridge called Cooper&#x27;s Bridge, and the Mouth of the River Colne to the King&#x27;s Mill, near the town of Huddersfleld, in the West Riding of the county of York&quot;. Sir John was Lord of the Manor of Huddersfield, and proprietor of the Ramsden Estate that owned much of the town.

Although a connection to the River Colne at Huddersfield was authorised by the act, the upper terminus was a basin at Apsley, where Ramsden built wharves and warehouses. From the basin it descended over a distance of , to its junction with the Calder and Hebble Navigation at Cooper Bridge.

The canal opened in 1776, having cost £11,975, although this total included some maintenance costs. Water was taken from the River Colne and fed into the canal from the tail goit of Shaw Foot Mill until it was supplied by the Huddersfield Narrow Canal after it opened in 1811.

===Operation===
The canal prospered, and in 1788, a regular service transporting goods between Huddersfield and Wakefield was operating three times a week. During the 1790s, goods were carried over the Pennines by road, with one service, operated by Richard Milnes, connecting Manchester to Huddersfield. In 1796, he operated daily sailings onwards from Huddersfield to Wakefield, where the Calder and Hebble Navigation connected to the Aire and Calder Navigation, on which there was a daily connection to Hull. Just a year later, he operated one or more boats a day between the upper terminus of the Calder and Hebble at Sowerby Bridge and Hull, while the service from Huddersfield to Wakefield reverted to three times a week. At the time, the construction of the broad Rochdale Canal was making progress towards Sowerby Bridge, while the Huddersfield Narrow Canal was struggling with the excavation of Standedge Tunnel, the longest, deepest and highest on the English canal system. The Rochdale Canal provided a trans-Pennine route from 1804, and Sowerby Bridge remained more important than Huddersfield, even after the Huddersfield Narrow opened throughout in 1811.

The Huddersfield Narrow Canal provided a heavily-locked western connection to the wool-weaving towns of the upper Colne valley, (Golcar, Linthwaite, Slaithwaite, and Marsden) and across the Pennines to Saddleworth, Stalybridge and Manchester via Standedge Tunnel. It was never particularly successful, and Ramsden&#x27;s Canal was seen almost as a branch of the Calder and Hebble, with links to Yorkshire, rather than Lancashire. The Calder and Hebble brought prosperity to the area, and Ramsden&#x27;s Canal shared in it. The Narrow Canal was hampered by the need to tranship cargoes at Huddersfield. Their boats were , the same as those on the connecting Ashton Canal and Peak Forest Canal at the Manchester end. However, they were too long to fit through the shorter locks of Ramsden&#x27;s Canal and the Calder and Hebble. In 1812 they built a narrowboat, which could work through to Wakefield, but it carried a smaller cargo. The company tried unsuccessfully to get the Calder and Hebble to entend their locks to cater for longer boats. Had they succeeded, locks on Ramsden&#x27;s Canal would have needed lengthening.

===Railway ownership===

The canal passed into railway ownership in 1845 when it was bought by the Huddersfield and Manchester Railway and Canal Company for £46,560. The company was incorporated in 1845 and had already the Huddersfield Narrow Canal primarily to aid in the construction of a cross-Pennine rail link at Standedge. The railway company became part of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) in 1847, and the negotiations meant that shareholders received 70 per cent of the dividends paid on shares in the LNWR.

In the year of the LNWR takeover, the canal carried 120,207 tons of cargo, but this gradually declined. An attempted revival of trade to Manchester in 1856, spearheaded by the Aire and Calder Navigation after a railway company took over the Rochdale Canal, foundered when the LNWR created obstacles to using Standedge Tunnel. The Aire and Calder negotiated the expansion of Huddersfield Wharf in 1872, and leased the original and extended wharves in 1873, installing hydraulic hoists two years later. At around this time, the LNWR began selling canal water, reportedly per day according to the &quot;Huddersfield Chronicle&quot;. Trade held up well, with some 75,000 tons passing between the Calder and Hebble and Ramsden&#x27;s Canal in the 1890s, of which about one quarter transferred to the Huddersfield Narrow Canal. By 1905, this had fallen to 54,580, of which one fifth passed onto the narrow canal.

===The leisure era===
The Calder and Hebble Canal company bought Ramsden&#x27;s Canal on 1 January 1945, in an agreement with the London, Midland and Scottish Railway company. They paid £4,000 which included a short length of the Narrow Canal, and the rest of that canal was abandoned. The canal was used to carry coal to a power station, and was used by some 80 barges each month. Along with most of the operating British canals, it was nationalised on 1 January 1948. The coal traffic ended in October 1953, and was the last commercial traffic to use the canal. With the passing of the Transport Act 1962 responsibility passed from the British Transport Commission to British Waterways. Under the terms of the Transport Act 1968, the canal was classified as a cruiseway, meaning that it had a future for leisure use. In 2012, responsibility passed to the Canal and River Trust.

==Current state==

The broad canal has been used much more since the re-opening of the Huddersfield Narrow Canal in 2001, as it is no longer a dead end, but part of one of three cross-Pennine through-routes. This has resulted in better maintenance of the channel and locks. There is a card-operated pumpout machine at Aspley Basin, and mooring points have fresh water and electric services.

The Huddersfield Broad Canal made its original connection with the Huddersfield Narrow Canal to the west of the A629 Wakefield Road. Following strengthening work to Wakefield Road, which included the construction of a reinforced concrete tunnel under the original bridge, this short section is no longer navigable to vessels wider than . Although British Waterways has not officially redesignated it, the Wakefield Road tunnel now effectively forms the end of the Huddersfield Broad Canal.

==Route==
Just above Coopers Bridge, the Calder and Hebble enters a lock cut through a floodgate. The route to Ramsden&#x27;s Canal follows the main course of the river, passing under the bridge which carries the A62 road over the river. A large weir is directly ahead, protected by a boom, and the first lock is on the right, just above it. The lock is a grade II listed structure, dating from the building of the canal, although a dated kerbstone indicates that it was modified in 1899. The adjacent lock keepers cottage, which is built of hammer-dressed stone, with two storeys and a stone slate roof, dates from the early or mid 19th century, and is also a listed structure. The canal turns to the south west to run parallel to the River Colne, and passes under a railway bridge to reach the Clone Bridge Lock. Just above it is a hammer-dressed stone warehouse, dating from the 18th century, followed by an arched bridge which carries Colne Bridge Road over the canal. A datestone indicates that it was built in 1775.
Pipelines cross the canal at Colliery Bridge, which is followed by Ladgrave Lock, with a hammer-dressed stone bridge over its tail. The canal is flanked by industrial buildings on both sides as it reaches Longlands Lock, again with a stone bridge over the tail. It passes under a disused railway bridge and the A62 road, and then close to Deighton railway station. The A62 bridge is a skew-arched bridge built for the opening of the canal, although the original structure is partially obscured by reinforced concrete extensions, which carry footpaths on both sides of the road. On the south bank is a large playing field, where the Inland Waterways Association held their National Festival in 2002. Turnpike Road Lock is situated at the southern end of the fields, and has a separate overflow channel to the north. Reading Lock has another stone bridge crossing its tail, and is followed by Fieldhouse Lock and bridge, which carries Fieldhouse Lane over the lock tail. Next comes Falls Lock, and finally Red Doles Lock and bridge. The lock is from the start of the canal, and the remaining mile (1.6 km) is level.

The canal is increasingly hemmed in by buildings. On the east bank is Phoenix Mill, a five-storey building with attics and a pitched slate roof. Close to the North Eastern Gas Board offices, which are located in a three-storey mid-19th century listed building, the canal makes a dog-leg turn under Leeds Road. On the west bank is an octagonal chimney, standing over tall, which was built in 1872 and formed part of a cotton spinning mill. Adjacent to it, the Locomotive lift bridge, which was installed in 1865, is a vertical lifting bridge. It was refurbished in 2002, and converted to electric operation. On the west bank is a seven-storey mill building originally belonging to John L Brierley. As the canal approaches Aspley Basin, there is a canal warehouse on the west bank, which dates from the construction of the canal, and another, which is Grade II* listed just after Wakefield Road bridge. The basin itself is at right angles to the canal.

<text>Christopher Hansteen (26 September 1784 – 11 April 1873) was a Norwegian geophysicist, astronomer and physicist, best known for his mapping of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field.

==Early life and career==
Hansteen was born in Christiania as the son of Johannes Mathias Hansteen (1744–1792) and his wife Anne Cathrine Treschow (1754–1829). He was the younger brother of writer Conradine Birgitte Dunker, and through her the uncle of Bernhard Dunker and Vilhelmine Ullmann, and granduncle of Mathilde Schjøtt, Ragna Nielsen and Viggo Ullmann. His mother was a first cousin of Niels Treschow.

The intention was for Hansteen to become a naval officer, but since his father died when Hansteen was young, this plan did not materialize. Instead, he attended Oslo Cathedral School from the age of nine. Niels Treschow was the principal of this school. Hansteen took the examen artium in 1802, and in 1803 he enrolled at the University of Copenhagen, where he originally studied law. He later took more interest in mathematics, estranged by the lack of universal validity of a country&#x27;s laws compared to the mathematical laws. He had also been inspired by the lectures of Hans Christian Ørsted. He was hired as the tutor of a young noble, Niels Rosenkrantz von Holstein, who lived at Sorø. Here, he also met his future wife Johanne Cathrine Andrea Borch, a daughter of professor Caspar Abraham Borch. In 1806 he was hired as a mathematics teacher in the gymnasium of Frederiksborg.

==Academic career==
In 1807 Hansteen began the inquiries in terrestrial magnetism with which his name is especially associated. His first scientific publication was printed in &quot;Journal de Physique&quot;, following a contest on magnetic axes created in 1811 by the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters. In 1813 he was given a research scholarship by the recently established (in 1811) Royal Frederick University in Christiania, with a promise of a future academic position. After marrying Johanne Cathrine Andrea Borch in May 1814, they left for Norway in the summer. Due to the Swedish campaign against Norway in 1814, they opted to travel by sea, and was threatened by a Swedish privateer as well as seized by a British fregate en route. Reaching Norway after five days, they settled in the street Pilestredet.

Working as a lecturer from 1814, in 1816 Hansteen was promoted to professor of astronomy and applied mathematics. He was the editor of the official Norwegian almanac from 1815, manager of the city astronomical observatory from the same year and co-director of the Norwegian Mapping Authority (then known as &quot;Norges Geografiske Oppmåling&quot;) from 1817. In 1819 he published a volume of researches on terrestrial magnetism, which was translated into German under the title of &quot;Untersuchungen über den Magnetismus der Erde&quot;, with a supplement containing &quot;Beobachtungen der Abweichung und Neigung der Magnetnadel&quot; and an atlas. By the rules there framed for the observation of magnetical phenomena Hansteen hoped to accumulate analyses for determining the number and position of the s of the Earth. In 1822 he co-founded Norway&#x27;s first journal on natural sciences, &quot;Magazin for Naturvidenskaberne&quot;. He sat as editor-in-chief for eight years.

In the course of his research he travelled over Finland and the greater part of his own country; and from 1828 to 1830 he undertook, in company with Georg Adolf Erman and with the co-operation of Russia, a government-funded mission to Western Siberia. A narrative of the expedition soon appeared (&quot;Reise-Erinnerungen aus Siberien&quot;, 1854; &quot;Souvenirs d’un voyage en Sibérie&quot;, 1857); but the chief work was not issued until 1863 (&quot;Resultate magnetischer Beobachtungen&quot;). He did not conclude on the issue at hand, but his work was later completed by Carl Friedrich Gauss. Shortly after the return of the mission, in 1833 Hansteen moved with his family into the observatory, which was created from drawings by the architect Christian Heinrich Grosch. A magnetic observatory was added in 1839.

From 1835 to 1838 he published textbooks on geometry and mechanics, largely a reaction to his former research assistant Bernt Michael Holmboe&#x27;s textbooks. Compared to Holmboe&#x27;s method of teaching, Hansteen&#x27;s books were more practically oriented. After Holmboe wrote a review of the first textbook for the newspaper &quot;Morgenbladet&quot;, in which he advised schools not to use it, a public debate followed, with contributions from other mathematicians. It has been claimed that this was the first debate on the subject of school textbooks in Norway. Holmboe&#x27;s textbooks proved more lasting, with Hansteen&#x27;s textbook not being reprinted. In 1842 Hansteen wrote his &quot;Disquisitiones de mutationibus, quas patitur momentum acus magneticae&quot;. He also contributed various papers to different scientific journals, especially &quot;Magazin for Naturvidenskaberne&quot;.

Hansteen was a member of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters from 1818 and of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters from 1857, as well as several learned societies in other countries, including the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (1822) and a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1863). He was a member of the board of the Royal Norwegian Society for Development for many years, and also chaired the board of the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry.

==Later life==
For health reasons, Hansteen stopped holding lectures in 1856. In 1861 he retired from active work, but still pursued his studies, his &quot;Observations de l&#x27;inclination magnetique&quot; and &quot;Sur les variations séculaires du magnetisme&quot; appearing in 1865. He left the position as observatory manager in 1861 as well, but continued as editor of the Norwegian almanac until 1863 and as director of the Norwegian Mapping Authority until 1872.

His wife died in 1840. Their daughter Aasta Hansteen became a notable women&#x27;s rights campaigner. He was the paternal great-grandfather of Kristofer Hansteen and Edvard Heiberg Hansteen; trade unionist Viggo Hansteen was a later descendant. Christopher Hansteen died in April 1873 in Christiania, and is buried at Gamle Aker kirkegård. The funeral took place at the University.

==Awards and legacy==
Hansteen was appointed a Commander of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 1847, and received the Grand Cross in 1855. He was also appointed a Grand Cross of the Order of the Dannebrog and a Commander Grand Cross of the Order of the Polar Star, as well as other foreign orders of knighthood. A bust of Hansteen was raised at his observatory in the 1850s.
The crater Hansteen and the mountain Mons Hansteen on the Moon is named after him. In Oslo, the road &quot;Christopher Hansteens vei&quot; at Blindern has been named after Hansteen. In addition, a street at Majorstuen was named &quot;Hansteens gate&quot;, but in 1879 it was renamed &quot;Holmboes gate&quot; in honour of Bernt Michael Holmboe.
In the Møhlenpris neighbourhood in Bergen, the street &quot;Professor Hansteens gate&quot; was named after Hansteen in 1881.

<text>Taegukgi: The Brotherhood of War () is a 2004 South Korean war film directed by Kang Je-gyu. It stars Jang Dong-gun and Won Bin and tells the story of two brothers who are forcibly drafted into the South Korean army at the outbreak of the Korean War.

Kang Je-gyu made a name for himself directing &quot;Shiri&quot; and was able to attract top talent and capital to his new project, eventually spending 12.8 million USD on production. The film became one of the biggest successes in the South Korean film history up to that time, attracting 11.74 million people to the theatre, beating the previous record holder &quot;Silmido&quot;.

== Plot ==
In 2003, while digging up remains at a Korean War battlefield to set up a memorial site, a South Korean army excavation team notifies an elderly man that they identified some remains as his own even though he is still alive.

53 years earlier, in June 1950, the Lee family goes about their lives in the South Korean capital of Seoul. Lee Jin-tae owns a shoeshine stand to pay for his younger brother Jin-seok&#x27;s education. Jin-tae has also bought them a silver pen, a precious item the brothers share, and is working on a pair of immaculate shoes for his brother to wear to school. Jin-tae&#x27;s fiancée, Young-shin, works with the Lees&#x27; noodle shop. On June 25, 1950, North Korea invades South Korea, and both brothers are forcibly conscripted. They are assigned to the 1st Infantry Division, fighting at the Busan Perimeter before advancing north upon the successful U.S. amphibious landing at Inchon. Jin-tae is told by a superior that if he can earn the highest award for a South Korean soldier, the Taeguk Cordon of the Order of Military Merit, his brother can be sent home. Jin-tae volunteers for many dangerous missions and performs suicidal acts of bravery to earn the medal, and is quickly promoted to sergeant. His heroism during the urban Battle of Pyongyang finally results in Jin-tae&#x27;s nomination for the medal, but his combat experiences have made him into an emotionless killer, which horrifies his younger brother.

The UN coalition is eventually forced to retreat all the way back to Seoul when the Chinese enter the war on the North Korean side. Jin-tae finally earns his medal, but in Seoul, Young-shin, suspected of joining the Communist Party during the Communist occupation, is arrested by a South Korean militia, and the brothers attempt to stop them. During the struggle, Young-shin is shot dead, and the brothers are arrested for trying to rescue her. In jail Jin-tae&#x27;s request to release his brother is refused, and the security commander orders the prison set afire with the prisoners inside when the enemy forces approach. Trying to rescue his brother, Jin-tae loses consciousness and wakes up believing Jin-seok died in the fire. He murders the surrendering prison warden before being captured by Chinese soldiers.

In truth, however, Jin-seok had been transferred to a military hospital after barely escaping, rescued by &quot;Uncle Yang&quot;, a now-disabled veteran from their old unit. Jin-seok learns that his brother had defected to the North Koreans and now leads an elite North Korean formation known as the &quot;Flag Unit&quot;.

Jin-seok chooses to rejoin the Army, which has by now retaken all of what is today South Korea with UN support. He demands to be allowed to fight, at the 38th parallel, but is denied. Jin-seok eventually defects, claiming to his captors he is Jin-tae&#x27;s brother. The North Koreans, however, believe Jin-seok is a spy and are about to take him away for interrogation when their position is attacked by U.S. and South Korean forces. The attack frees Jin-seok, who continues his search as the position is captured in a vicious hand-to-hand battle. Before the U.S. and South Korean forces can secure their gains, however, the &quot;Flag Unit&quot; arrives, tearing into them with Jin-tae at its head.

The brothers come face-to-face, but, not recognizing Jin-seok, Jin-tae attempts to kill him, and Jin-seok barely avoids death before his brother is briefly incapacitated. Jin-seok attempts to carry him away but is shot in the leg. With both of them wounded, Jin-tae finally recognizes his younger brother, and the two have a tearful reunion. This is cut short, however, as the North Koreans force back the U.S. and South Korean troops. Jin-Tae orders his brother to save himself. Jin-seok initially refuses but relents after Jin-Tae promises that they will meet again. As the wounded Jin-seok limps to safety, Jin-tae mans a machine gun and provides cover fire for his younger brother and the other South Koreans before being killed.

In 2003, the elderly Jin-seok stands at the excavation site; the remains initially identified as his are those of Jin-tae. He examines Jin-tae&#x27;s few excavated belongings, including their long-lost silver pen, and begs his brother&#x27;s skeletal remains to speak to him, quoting his promises as his granddaughter looks on with sympathy.

Back in the 1950s, in the aftermath of the Korean War, Jin-seok returns to his mother, who also survived, discovers the shoes to which his brother had dedicated himself to perfecting, and heads off with Young-shin&#x27;s younger siblings in a now-peaceful, but ruined, Seoul as the nation begins rebuilding. He reassures them that he will return to school, fulfilling the promise he made to Jin-tae.

== Cast ==
* Jang Dong-gun as Lee Jin-tae
* Won Bin as Lee Jin-seok, Jin-tae&#x27;s younger brother
** Jang Min-ho as old Lee Jin-seok
* Lee Eun-ju as Kim Young-shin, Jin-tae&#x27;s fiancée
* Choi Min-sik as North Korean commander

* Jo Yoon-hee as Lee Jin-seok&#x27;s granddaughter
* Kim Soo-ro as Anti-Communist Federation member
* Joo Da-young as Young-ja
* Kim Jae-joong as Corpse hazardous excavation site unit

Prior to Kim Jae-joong&#x27;s debut as a singer, he worked as extra, one is a Corpse hazardous excavation site unit and the other is a Chinese soldier (uncredited).

Jo Sung-mo also worked as an extra, playing a soldier of the North Korean People&#x27;s Army (uncredited).

== Production ==
=== Title ===
The film&#x27;s title is the name of the pre-war flag of the People&#x27;s Republic of Korea, the flag of the Provisional People&#x27;s Committee for North Korea as well as the current flag of South Korea, featuring the Taegeuk symbol. It was released in the United Kingdom as &quot;Brotherhood: Taegukgi&quot; and the United States as &quot;Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War&quot;.

=== Soundtrack ===
The music was composed by Lee Dong-june, and released on February 23, 2004 as a single CD, produced by Yejeon Media in South Korea and Avex Trax in Japan. It has 25 tracks, with seven bonus tracks, including a solo piano and chamber ensemble arrangement of the main theme. The &quot;haunting&quot; main theme&#x27;s lyricism, present throughout several of the tracks, was compared favorably to music of film score composers Ennio Morricone and John Williams. Although it was received generally positively, one critic argued that the film was tragic enough already, and needed &quot;a more subtle soundtrack.&quot;

== Reception ==
At the 50th Asia Pacific Film Festival, &quot;Taegukgi&quot; won the &quot;Best Film&quot; award, while Kang Je-gyu was awarded the &quot;Best Director&quot;. It was one of four Korean movies screened at the 2006 International Fajr Film Festival in Iran.

<text>Szeben was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. Its territory is now in central Romania (southern Transylvania). The capital of the county was Nagyszeben (present-day Sibiu).

==Geography==

Szeben County shared borders with Romania and the Hungarian counties Hunyad, Alsó-Fehér, Nagy-Küküllő, and Fogaras. The river Olt flowed through the county. Its area was around 1910.

==History==
Szeben County was formed in 1876, when the administrative structure of Transylvania was changed. It included the former Saxon seats of Hermannstadt/Sibiu, Mühlbach/Sebeș, Reussmarkt/Miercurea, and (most of) Nocrich, as well as parts of Alsó-Fehér and Felső-Fehér counties. In 1920, by the Treaty of Trianon, the county became part of Romania. Its territory lies in the present Romanian counties Sibiu and Alba (the area around Sebeș).

==Subdivisions==

In the early 20th century, the subdivisions of Szeben county were:

<doc id="934527" wikidata="Q7865014" url="?curid=934527" title="UK statutory notification system">
<text>The UK statutory notification system for infectious diseases (also called Notifications of Infectious Diseases or NOIDS) is a system whereby doctors are required to notify a &quot;proper officer&quot; of the local authority (such as a Consultant in Communicable Disease Control) if they are presented with a case of a serious infectious disease such as diphtheria or measles. The proper officer then sends a report to the Centre for Infections of the Health Protection Agency (HPA) in Colindale, north London.

The main purpose of the system is the detection and intervention in possible epidemics. It also enables surveillance data to be collected that can help in planning ways to prevent future outbreaks.

==History of the statutory notification system==
The statutory requirement for the notification of certain infectious diseases first came into being with the Infectious Disease (Notification) Act 1889 (52 &amp; 53 Vict. c. 72), which made reporting compulsory in London and optional in the provinces. Cases of smallpox, cholera, diphtheria, membranous croup. erysipelas, scarlatina or scarlet fever, typhus fever, typhoid fever, enteric fever, relapsing fever, continued fever and puerperal fever had to be reported by the household head or attending doctor to the local authority. The system spread to the rest of England and Wales in 1899 with the Infectious Disease (Notification) Extension Act 1899 (62 &amp; 63 Vict. c. 8). Householders or general practitioners who failed to notify a case of one of these diseases was liable to a fine of up to forty shillings. Following receipt of a notification certificate, the local sanitary authority could pursue existing public health laws, such as the Public Health Act 1875 (38 &amp; 39 Vict. c. 55), to isolate patients in hospital, disinfect property and belongings, suspend schooling, and temporarily close businesses.

Originally, disease statistics were collected from the local authorities by the Registrar General&#x27;s Office, where national statistics were already collected on births, marriages and deaths. This office was later known as the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys and is now called the Office for National Statistics. In 1997, however, the responsibility for administering the system was transferred to the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC), now the Health Protection Agency&#x27;s Health Protection Services Division (HPS).

==The system today==
The main concern of the modern system is speed in detecting possible outbreaks, and accuracy of diagnosis is only secondary. Since 1968 clinical suspicion of a notifiable infection is all that is required to report a case of a disease. The attending doctor must notify the proper officers, who are usually public health clinicians called consultants in communicable disease control. These consultants are required to inform the HPA on a weekly basis of each case of a disease that has been notified. The HPA collates these reports and publishes its analysis of local and national trends.

As of June 2022, the list of notifiable diseases contains 34 entries, including leprosy. During the 2002-2003 outbreak, SARS was added to the list as the 31st.

Some of the notifiable diseases are:
* Anthrax
* Cholera
* COVID-19
* Dysentery
* Food poisoning
* Malaria
* Measles
* Meningitis
* Mumps
* Plague
* Polio
* Rabies
* Rubella
* Scarlet fever
* Smallpox
* Tetanus
* Tuberculosis
* Typhoid fever
* Typhus fever
* Viral hepatitis
* Whooping cough

<doc id="934529" wikidata="Q1277334" url="?curid=934529" title="Earl of Lennox">
<text>The Earl or Mormaer of Lennox was the ruler of the region of the Lennox in western Scotland. It was first created in the 12th century for David of Scotland, Earl of Huntingdon and later held by the Stewart dynasty.

==Ancient earls==
The first earl recorded is Ailin I, sometimes called &#x27;Alwin&#x27;. He is traditionally said to have been created Earl of Lennox by King Malcolm IV in 1154, but this is likely too early a date. [Note: Other sources say Arkil (Arkyll) was the first mormaer. He fled Northumberland for Scotland about 1070 and was made Mormaer of Levenax by Malcolm. That title was in the 12th century changed to earl of Lennox.] The earldom may in fact have been created in the late twelfth century by King William the Lion for his brother David, and after David gained the higher title Earl of Huntingdon, he resigned the Earldom of Lennox and it passed to Ailin.

Earl Ailin&#x27;s parentage and background is unknown. His line continued as Earls of Lennox until the time of Earl Duncan in the fifteenth century. Duncan&#x27;s daughter Isabella married Murdoch, son of Robert, Duke of Albany. Duncan hoped this marriage would improve the family&#x27;s prospects, but it would in fact be their downfall. Duke Robert had murdered David, the heir to the throne, and when David&#x27;s brother James became king, he wreaked his vengeance: almost the entire family were executed, including Earl Duncan, despite the fact he had had no part in the murder.

Isabella was imprisoned in Tantallon Castle, but she escaped execution, and succeeded her father as Countess of Lennox. All four of her sons died in her lifetime: two from King James&#x27;s retribution, and two from natural causes. She had several grandsons, but none of them were legitimate, and the earldom therefore died with her around the year 1457.

==Stewart earls==

In 1473 the earldom was reclaimed by Sir John Stewart of Darnley, who was the grandson of Elizabeth Lennox, daughter to Earl Duncan and sister to Countess Isabella. In 1565 his great-great-great-grandson Henry, Lord Darnley married Mary, Queen of Scots. He would be murdered at Kirk o&#x27; Field in 1567, and therefore on the death of his father Earl Matthew, the earldom of Lennox passed to James, the son of Henry and Mary. James would accede as King of Scots a few months later, and the title consequently merged with the Crown.

In 1572, the earldom was conferred upon King James&#x27;s uncle Charles. He did not long enjoy the title, for he died four years later at the age of twenty-one. It was next granted to the king&#x27;s great-uncle Robert in 1578. This Robert, described as being &quot;symple and of lyttle action or accomte&quot;, was persuaded to exchange the earldom of Lennox for the earldom of March, so that the king could give the former title to his friend and cousin Esmé. In 1581, Esmé&#x27;s earldom was raised to a dukedom, and his line continued as Dukes of Lennox until the time of his great-grandson Charles, who died childless in 1672 after drowning at Elsinore while on a diplomatic mission to the Danish government.

In 1675, the Dukedom of Lennox was conferred upon Charles, bastard son of King Charles II, along with the English Dukedom of Richmond and several other titles. However, he would later sell his lands in the Lennox to the Duke of Montrose, meaning he became Duke of Lennox in name alone. This line survives today, and is currently headed by another Charles. Despite being Stewarts, they used &quot;Lennox&quot; as their surname, which was changed to &quot;Gordon-Lennox&quot; in the 19th century after the fourth Duke married Lady Charlotte Gordon, sister and heiress to George, Duke of Gordon.

==Stewart family==

===Ludovic Stewart, 1st Duke of Richmond, 2nd Duke of Lennox===
Ludovic Stewart, 1st Duke of Richmond, 2nd Duke of Lennox (1574–1624), was the eldest son and heir of Esmé Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox, 1st Earl of Lennox (1542–1583), a Roman Catholic French nobleman of Scottish ancestry who on his move to Scotland at the age of 37 became a favorite of the 13-year-old King James VI of Scotland (later James I of England), of whose father, Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley, he was a first cousin. In 1579/80 Esmé Stewart was created Earl of Lennox, Lord Darnley, Aubigny and Dalkeith and in 1581 he was created Duke of Lennox, Earl of Darnley, Lord Aubigny, Dalkeith, Torboltoun and Aberdour.

The founder of the French branch of the Stewart family of Darnley in Renfrewshire, Scotland, was Sir John Stewart of Darnley ( – 1429), 1st Seigneur de Concressault, 1st Seigneur d&#x27;Aubigny, 1st Comte d&#x27;Évreux, a warrior who commanded the Scottish army in France assisting the French King Charles VII to expel the invading English forces under King Henry V during the Hundred Years War. He was much appreciated by the French king who showered him with honours and landed estates and granted him the &quot;glorious privilege of quartering the royal arms of France with his paternal arms&quot;. The residence of the Stewart family in France was the Château d&#x27;Aubigny, Aubigny-sur-Nère, in the ancient county of Berry.

King James I regarded all Esmé&#x27;s family with great affection, and instructed his son King Charles I to do well by them. Charles faithfully fulfilled this obligation, and as a result the Lennox family had considerable influence at the Scottish and English Courts over the next two generations. In 1603 as well as being granted the reversion of Cobham Hall, he was also granted the possession of Temple Newsam Hall in Yorkshire, the birthplace of Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley, father of King James I and first cousin of Ludovic&#x27;s father. In 1613 Ludovic Stewart was created Baron of Settrington (of Yorkshire) and Earl of Richmond (of Yorkshire) and in 1623 Earl of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne and Duke of Richmond. He married three times but died on 16 February 1623/4, aged 50, without legitimate issue, when all his titles, excepting those inherited from his father, became extinct. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, in the &quot;Richmond Vault&quot; in the Henry VII Chapel (that king formerly having been Earl of Richmond) above which survives his magnificent black marble monument by Hubert Le Sueur with gilt-bronze recumbent effigies of himself and his wife.

===Esmé Stewart, 3rd Duke of Lennox===
Esmé Stewart, 3rd Duke of Lennox (1579–1624), younger brother and heir, who had succeeded his father as 7th Seigneur d&#x27;Aubigny (which French title was able to be passed directly to a younger son). He died on 30 July 1624 of spotted fever, just 5 months after his elder brother. He married Katherine Clifton, 2nd Baroness Clifton ( – 1637) of Leighton Bromswold, Huntingdonshire, as a consequence of which in 1619 he was created Baron Stuart of Leighton Bromswold and Earl of March. He was buried in Westminster Abbey.

===James Stewart, 1st Duke of Richmond, 4th Duke of Lennox===
James Stewart, 1st Duke of Richmond, 4th Duke of Lennox (1612–1655), son and heir, a third cousin of King Charles I. In 1624 King James I created the 12-year-old newly-fatherless James Stewart as Duke of Richmond and in 1628, following the death of Frances Howard (Lady Cobham), he gained vacant possession of Cobham Hall, which became his main residence. He was a key member of Royalist party in the English Civil War and in 1641–42 he served as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, which office was administered from nearby Dover Castle in Kent. He married Mary Villiers, daughter of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham.

===Esmé Stuart, 2nd Duke of Richmond, 5th Duke of Lennox===
Esmé Stuart, 2nd Duke of Richmond, 5th Duke of Lennox (1649–1660) was the infant son the 1st Duke. On his father&#x27;s death when he was aged 6, and following the defeat of the royalist faction in the Civil War, he and his mother went into exile in France, where he died of the smallpox aged 10 in 1660 (the year of the Restoration of the Monarchy), when his titles passed to his first cousin Charles Stewart, 3rd Duke of Richmond, 6th Duke of Lennox. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, where survives his monument, a black obelisk surmounted by an urn containing his heart.

===Charles Stewart, 3rd Duke of Richmond, 6th Duke of Lennox===
Charles Stewart, 3rd Duke of Richmond, 6th Duke of Lennox (1639–1672) was the only son of George Stewart, 9th Seigneur d&#x27;Aubigny (1618–1642) (a younger brother of the 1st &amp; 4th Duke), by his wife Katherine Howard, a daughter of Theophilus Howard, 2nd Earl of Suffolk. He was appointed joint Lord Lieutenant of Kent and Vice-Admiral of Kent. With the Civil War over and the Stuart monarchy restored, he re-built the central block at Cobham Hall, between 1662 and 1672, to the design of the architect Peter Mills. His &quot;Gilt Hall&quot; of 1672 (with marble wall decorations added in the 18th c. by James Wyatt) was considered by King George IV to be the finest room in England. He married three times but died childless.

<doc id="934534" wikidata="Q7674679" url="?curid=934534" title="Tadpoles (band)">
<text>Tadpoles were an American psychedelic rock band, formed in 1990 in New York City by Todd Parker (guitars/vocals), Michael Kite Audino (drums) and Josh Bracken (bass.) In 1992, Nick Kramer (guitars/vocals), David Max (bass) and Andrew Jackson (guitars) of the fledgling Manhattan group, Hit, joined the Tadpoles after putting Hit on hiatus.

In 1993 Kite and Jackson left the group, which relocated to Hoboken, New Jersey, where Parker formed Bakery Records. In 1996, Adam Boyette (drums) joined Tadpoles to complete what would be their final line-up. Parker announced the Tadpoles would be going on an “indefinite hiatus” in 2000, and the group disbanded. Kramer, Max and Boyette reformed Hit and continued on.

== History ==
Todd Parker originally formed the group while living in Champaign, Illinois in 1985 as an outlet for mostly solo 4-track recordings. These recordings were released on the cassettes, &quot;Ham &amp; Eggs&quot; (1987); &quot;Limousines, Sardines, Dinosaurs&quot; (1988); &quot;Beautiful Music For Ugly Children&quot; (1989); and &quot;William’s Doll&quot; (1990). New York University (NYU) filmmaker, Michael Kite Audino became increasingly more involved in the recordings, so Parker and Kite decided to form a live version of the Tadpoles in New York City in 1990. They released one more cassette album &quot;Ride The Soul&quot; (1991) which featured their initial NYC recordings.

While Parker&#x27;s previous recordings were all over the musical map, the new group focused on their psychedelic rock influences, combining Kite&#x27;s films, a homemade light show, and an excessively loud sound volume to create a multi-sensory live experience akin to what the Butthole Surfers, My Bloody Valentine, Spacemen 3, and The Flaming Lips were doing at the time. Tadpoles became fixtures on the Manhattan rock club scene in 1992-1993 after NYU students, Nick Kramer, David Max and Andrew Jackson, joined the group.

In 1992, the band recorded a 10-song demo tape, &quot;Superwhip&quot;, and began a relationship with producer/Shimmy Disc Records owner, Mark Kramer, who offered to record the group at his Noise New Jersey Studio, where in 1993, Tadpoles recorded their debut album, &quot;He Fell Into The Sky&quot;. However, internal issues led to the departure of both Kite and Jackson before the album was released, and the group stalled temporarily.

In 1994, Parker formed &quot;Bakery Records&quot; to release He Fell Into The Sky, an album of short, powerful, psychedelic pop-rock songs; and, it received very positive reviews... although, the band still had a difficult time finding their audience in the Manhattan clubs. Tadpoles continued to record new material with Kramer at Noise New Jersey with guest drummers, &quot;Steve Savoca&quot; (The Werefrogs) and &quot;Edward Odowd&quot; (The Toilet Boys / Psychic TV) and with Nick Kramer taking a bigger role in song-writing and guitar-playing. &quot;Jeff Passifiume&quot; (The Lost Continentals/Hank McCoy and The Dead Ringers) added tasty, soaring lap steel to the mix. In the fall of 1994, Tadpoles were showcased in the College Music Journal (CMJ) music marathon at Manhattan&#x27;s Batcave club.

In 1996, Tadpoles’ second album, Far Out, again produced by Shimmy Disc&#x27;s Kramer, was released on Bakery Records and was extremely well received, both nationally and internationally, by the alternative music press. Far Out also garnered an unexpected and uncommon (for a self-released band) 4-star review from Rolling Stone magazine by writer Jim DeRogatis. With a smoother, spacier sound, Far Out gained Tadpoles a national fan base due to enthusiastic airplay on college radio. This led to the group being picked up by larger distributors so that their albums were able to reach a wider audience. The group, which rarely played live, added &quot;Adam Boyette&quot; as their permanent drummer and began writing and recording their next album.

In 1997, Tadpoles performed a well-received set at the first &quot;Terrastock&quot; Festival held in Providence, Rhode Island. The performance gained them new fans and was released in 1998 as Destroy Terrastock – Live, with both the album cover and title being derived from a Kiss (band) Bootleg “Destroys Anaheim.” In the fall of 1997, Tadpoles toured the US west coast along with fellow Terrastock veterans, Cul de Sac (group) and Windy &amp; Carl, and played a show in Portland, Oregon with the legendary John Fahey.

Coinciding with the tour, Tadpoles released an EP, Know Your Ghosts, which contained a track from the upcoming new studio album, along with a few other unreleased songs, one of which was a cover of the Tony Mentzer track, “Oops, I Lost Your Mind.” “Oops, I Lost Your Mind” featured Tony Mentzer on vocals, along with Chris Butler (The Waitresses/Tin Huey) on drums.

In 1998, Tadpoles released their third Bakery Records studio album, Smoke Ghost, which was once again produced by Kramer (Shimmy Disc/Bongwater) at Noise New Jersey. The album, richly layered, thick, lush psychedelia, was again well received by press; but, by this point, Tadpoles had essentially eschewed live performance, with little intention of venturing outside their Hoboken rehearsal studio except for a rare local club appearance. Smoke Ghost featured a significant song-writing contribution from Nick Kramer, who wrote half the material.

Tadpoles recorded their final studio album, Whirlaway, (producing themselves this time,) at Ampreon Recorder in Youngstown, Ohio. Engineer Pete Drivere captured the live feel of the expansive set of songs; and, the result was the first Tadpoles album released on a label other than Bakery Records. Australia&#x27;s Camera Obscura Records released Whirlaway in 1999, again garnering rave reviews and new fans for the group. Whirlaway&#x27;s long instrumental closing track, &quot;Horse and Buggy&quot;, was recorded at Manhattan&#x27;s Knitting Factory by their long-time producer, Kramer; and, Tadpoles mixed an entire version of the album with Gene Holder (The dB&#x27;s), although only a few of these mixes were used. (Drivere&#x27;s mix was preferred by the band.)

Sharing the bill with Thurston Moore and Half Japanese, Tadpoles gave their final performance in February 2000 at a sold-out show at Maxwell&#x27;s in Hoboken, which was the first time they ever played their legendary hometown club. Later in 2000, Todd Parker announced that the group was going on an “indefinite hiatus” and they disbanded.

In 2001, Bakery Records released Use With Headphones Late At Night- Best of 1990-2000, a remastered compilation featuring tracks from each studio album, along with alternate mixes. A decade later, in 2011, Bakery released Feel Like A Freak (A Historical Sideshow of Missing Links, a second compilation album of previously unreleased studio tracks and alternate mixes.

Since the Tadpoles disbanded, David Max, Nick Kramer and Adam Boyette, reformed Hit and released the vinyl EP &quot;Quosibility&quot; and completed a currently unreleased album See It Majestic. David Max became a member of seminal psychedelic electronic noise group, Psychic TV (PTV3) along with Edward Odowd (who played drums on 2 tracks on Tadpoles’ Far Out album.) David Max performs guitar on the 2007 PTV3 album, Hell is Invisible... Heaven is Her/e and the 2008 PTV3 album, Mr. Alien Brain vs the Skinwalkers. David appears in the 2011 documentary film by Marie Losier, The Ballad of Genesis and Lady Jaye. In 2007, Nick Kramer, along with Alex Kress, released an album of duets/covers, &quot;Nicholas &amp; Alexandra.&quot;
In 2010, David Max released a solo album, Simple Psychedelic Pleasures and Todd Parker released an album, Greetings From The Star Chamber by his solo project, Todd Parker and The Witches, reuniting him with original Tadpoles&#x27; drummer/collaborator, Michael Kite Audino. Parker released the companion EP The Star Club E.P. in December, 2010 as well as two additional EPs Ukulele Colored Glasses EP and Temple of The Goddess EP in 2011. In 2012, Todd Parker and The Witches released a newly re-recorded version of the Tadpoles&#x27; 1989 cassette-only album Beautiful Music For Ugly Children, called Evil Bliss. Parker&#x27;s third solo album Martians (album) was released by Bakery Records on June 21, 2013.

<doc id="934536" wikidata="Q1443784" url="?curid=934536" title="Frank Merrill">
<text>Frank Dow Merrill (December 4, 1903 – December 11, 1955) was a United States Army general and is best remembered for his command of Merrill&#x27;s Marauders, officially the 5307th Composite Unit (provisional), in the Burma Campaign of World War II. Merrill&#x27;s Marauders came under General Joseph Stilwell&#x27;s Northern Combat Area Command. It was a special forces unit modelled on the Chindits&#x27; long range penetration groups trained to operate from bases deep behind Japanese lines.

==Background and early career==
Born on December 4, 1903, in Hopkinton, Massachusetts, Merrill lived with his family in Amesbury, Massachusetts, and graduated from Amesbury High School. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1922 and earned the rank of staff sergeant in Company A, 11th Engineers.

He received an appointment to West Point in 1925 and he graduated in 1929. He subsequently earned a B.S. in military engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1932. In 1938, Merrill became the Military Attaché in Tokyo where he studied the Japanese language.

He joined General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s staff in the Philippines in 1941 as a military intelligence officer. Merrill was on a mission in Rangoon, Burma, at the time of the Pearl Harbor attack and remained in Burma after the Japanese invasion.

In November 1943, Colonel Merrill was promoted to brigadier general only a month before his fortieth birthday, making him one of the youngest American generals since the Civil War. Even more remarkable was the fact that he had been serving as a commissioned officer for only 14 years. He was promoted to major general in September 1944 at the age of 40.

==Merrill&#x27;s Marauders==

In 1943, General Merrill was appointed to command a new volunteer U.S. Army special forces unit patterned after the Long Range Jungle Penetration groups formed by the British to harass Japanese forces in Burma (the Chindits). The U.S. Army&#x27;s official name for the unit was the 5307th Composite Unit (Provisional). (The title provisional meant the unit was formed for a special mission or operation and would be disbanded afterwards.) Visiting war correspondents, after viewing the 5307th&#x27;s performance on the firing ranges, promptly dubbed the unit Merrill&#x27;s Marauders. General Merrill oversaw the training and deployment of the three battalions of the 5307th into Burma in February 1944.

In slightly more than five months of combat behind Japanese lines in Burma, the Marauders, who supported the X Force, advanced 750 miles through some of the harshest jungle terrain in the world, fought in five major engagements (Walawbum, Shaduzup, Inkangahtawng, Nhpum Ga, and Myitkyina) and engaged in combat with the Japanese Army on thirty-two occasions. Battling Japanese soldiers, hunger, and disease, they had traversed more jungle on their long-range patrols than any other U.S. Army unit of the war.

On March 29, Merrill suffered his first heart attack and command returned to then executive officer, Colonel Charles N. Hunter. In their final mission against the Japanese base at Myitkyina, the Marauders suffered 272 killed, 955 wounded, and 980 evacuated for illness and disease. By the time the town of Myitkyina was taken, only about 200 surviving members of the original Marauders were present.

On August 10, 1944, a week after the town&#x27;s fall to U.S. and Chinese forces, the 5307th was disbanded with a final total of only 130 combat-effective officers and men (out of the original 2,997).

==Post war==
After the war&#x27;s end, Merrill served in the Philippines. In early 1946 he was assigned to the headquarters of the 6th Army in San Francisco under General Stilwell. In May of the same year, Merrill and Stilwell led two Marine platoons to suppress a prison uprising at Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary in what is known as the Battle of Alcatraz.

Due to post-war downsizing of the Army, Merrill was reduced in rank to brigadier general on 1 June 1946. He retired from the Army in his permanent rank of colonel on 30 June 1948, and was promoted to brigadier general on the retired list the next day.

After retiring from the Army, Merrill became the New Hampshire Commissioner of Highways. In December 1955, he was elected President of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials but died two days later in Fernandina Beach, Florida.

==Legacy==
In 1992, General Merrill was inducted into the U.S. Army Ranger Hall of Fame as a member of its inaugural class of inductees.

The Everett Turnpike bridge over New Hampshire&#x27;s Souhegan River was a favorite of Merrill&#x27;s, and is dedicated to Merrill&#x27;s Marauders.

Camp Frank D. Merrill, near Dahlonega, Georgia, is home to the three-week mountain training phase of the United States Army Ranger School.

The U.S. Army retroactively awarded members of Merrill&#x27;s Marauders the U.S. Army Ranger Tab. 

==In popular culture==

<text>Szolnok-Doboka was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. Its territory is now in northern Romania (northern Transylvania). The capital of the county was Dés (now Dej, Romania).

==Geography==

Szolnok-Doboka county shared borders with the Hungarian counties Szilágy, Szatmár, Máramaros, Beszterce-Naszód and Kolozs. The river Someş flowed through the county. Its area was around 1910.

==History==
Szolnok-Doboka county was formed in 1876, when Belső-Szolnok county (its center was Dés/Dej), most of Doboka county (its center was Doboka/Dăbâca at first, later Szamosújvár/Gherla) and the eastern part of the Kővárvidék/Chioar district were united.

In 1920, by the Treaty of Trianon, the county became part of Romania, except from 1940 until the end of World War II, when it was returned to Hungary by the Second Vienna Award, with a slightly modified territory. The territory of the county is now divided between the Romanian counties of Cluj (the center and south, a.o. Dej), Maramureș (the north), Bistrița-Năsăud (the east) and Sălaj (the west).

<doc id="934552" wikidata="Q631226" url="?curid=934552" title="Fluke (band)">
<text>Fluke are an English electronic music group formed in the late 1980s by Jon Fugler, Mike Tournier and Mike Bryant. The band were noted for their diverse range of electronic styles, including house, techno, ambient, big beat and downtempo; for their reclusivity, rarely giving interviews; and for lengthy timespans between albums. 

Fluke produced five original studio albums, three compilation albums, and a live album. They made several line-up changes over the years, with credited appearances attributed to Neil Davenport on guitars, Robin Goodridge on drums and Hugh Bryder as a DJ. In the tour for their fourth album &quot;Risotto&quot; (1997), they were joined on stage by singer Rachel Stewart, who continued as lead female vocalist and dancer for all of Fluke&#x27;s live performances between 1997 and 1999.

After &quot;Risotto&quot;, Tournier left the group to form Syntax with Jan Burton. Bryant and Fugler went on to produce Fluke&#x27;s fifth and final studio album, &quot;Puppy&quot; (2003), and the pair subsequently engaged in a project under the name 2 Bit Pie, with their first album &quot;2Pie Island&quot; released in September 2006.

Fluke received mainstream attention through the inclusion of their music in various film and video game soundtracks, including blockbuster films like &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; (2003) and &quot;Sin City&quot; (2005), and the soundtracks to the video game series &quot;Need for Speed: Underground&quot; and &quot;Wipeout&quot;. The film &quot;The Experiment&quot; (2010) uses their song &quot;YKK&quot; from &quot;Puppy&quot;.

In 2024, Fluke returned from hiatus with the single &quot;Insanely Beautiful&quot;, released on 29 April 2024.

==History==
===&quot;The Techno Rose of Blighty&quot;===
Before forming Fluke, Fugler and Bryant had played in two punk bands together named The Leaky Radiators and The Layfigures. The third member of Fluke, Tournier, was introduced to the group when he undertook work on a collaboration with Fugler entitled &quot;Skin&quot;. It soon became clear that all three shared musical tastes, having a shared interest in the acid house scene and the more experimental electronic sounds of Cabaret Voltaire and Giorgio Moroder.

Fluke&#x27;s first single, released in 1988, was a white label vinyl entitled &quot;Island Life&quot;, pressed on a clear blue 12&quot; vinyl record. Although a commercial failure, as well as being very different in sound to the band&#x27;s later works, the group persisted and released another two white label vinyls: &quot;Thumper!&quot; () in 1989 and &quot;Joni/Taxi&quot; in 1990, a song that sampled Joni Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot;. The attention that these records received gained the band a record deal with Creation Records with whom they released their first CD single &quot;Philly&quot; in the same year.

In the following year, Fluke released their first album, &quot;The Techno Rose of Blighty&quot;, swiftly followed by the single &quot;The Bells&quot; and a live album entitled &quot;Out (In Essence)&quot;. For the release of &quot;Out (In Essence)&quot;, Fluke abandoned their deal with Creation Records and signed instead with Circa Records, an offshoot of Virgin. Along with these releases, Fluke also began their career-spanning tradition of releasing work of a different nature under various names. The first of these, the industrial music single &quot;All Aboard&quot;, was released in 1990 under the name The Lucky Monkeys.

At this early stage in their career, the band realized that they would experience the greatest artistic freedom if they had their own recording studio and took it upon themselves to obtain their own premises. This was an asset which, according to Fugler, proved invaluable in coordinating the &quot;wider pool of people — musicians and friends — that we draw on to help&quot;.

EMI asked Fluke to remix Talk Talk&#x27;s 1986 song &quot;Life&#x27;s What You Make It&quot; for the 1991 album &quot;History Revisited&quot; which largely consists of new remixes of Talk Talk songs. The album was removed from stores after the band denounced it, saying they had not given permission for the songs to be remixed.

===&quot;Six Wheels on My Wagon&quot;===
After a two-year break, Fluke returned with what became a breakthrough into mainstream popular music when, in 1993, they released the single &quot;Slid&quot;. This became a club classic when it was picked up by DJ Sasha who liked it so much that he included three separate remixes of it on his &quot;Renaissance&quot; album. This burst of success was followed by two further singles, &quot;Electric Guitar&quot; () and &quot;Groovy Feeling&quot;, and, in the same year, the release of the group&#x27;s second album, &quot;Six Wheels on My Wagon&quot;.

This new album was a distinctly house music production, with uplifting riffs and ambient effects, as opposed to the techno style of their previous release. The album was received favourably by critics, with &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine labelling it &quot;groundbreaking&quot;. Other reviewers went further, with &quot;The Independent&quot; suggesting that Fluke was to become the next big thing in Europe:

In 1994, Fluke released &quot;The Peel Sessions&quot;, recorded for the BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel. This CD was a selection of tracks from two live sessions recorded on 18 November 1990 and 10 December 1991. The CD included one new song, &quot;Time Keeper&quot;, and several tracks which had previously been released on vinyl only. Fluke were invited to perform two further, unreleased, &quot;Peel Sessions&quot; after this CD. One was broadcast on 10 November 1996 and the other was performed live on 8 December 2002.

===&quot;Oto&quot;, &quot;Risotto&quot; and departure of Mike Tournier===
The following year, Fluke released their third album, &quot;Oto&quot;, which is the Greek word for &quot;of the ear&quot;. In terms of style, &quot;Oto&quot; was somewhat darker than &quot;Six Wheels on my Wagon&quot;, focusing on the downbeat ambient effects which were present in the second half of &quot;Six Wheels&quot;, and the band completely removed the uplifting house style that characterised their previous work. Only two singles were released from &quot;Oto&quot;; &quot;Bullet&quot; and &quot;Tosh&quot;. &quot;Bullet&quot; was chosen by Dominic Pride of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine as one of his top ten picks of 1995. 

In 1996, Fluke released &quot;Atom Bomb&quot;, a single that reached #20 in the UK charts. Originally created as a track for the video game &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot; (Along with &quot;V6&quot;), it became the centrepiece of their next album, &quot;Risotto&quot;. The track was also released as a single from the soundtrack album &quot;Wipeout 2097: The Soundtrack&quot;, which had tracks from The Chemical Brothers, Future Sound of London, Photek, Underworld, Daft Punk, Leftfield and The Prodigy. Fluke&#x27;s fourth studio album was the pinnacle of Fluke&#x27;s mainstream chart success with the singles &quot;Atom Bomb&quot; and &quot;Absurd&quot; (). The album was named &quot;Risotto&quot; after the risotto food dish because, like its culinary counterpart, it contained a mix of &quot;ingredients&quot;. These included the singles &quot;Atom Bomb&quot; and &quot;Absurd&quot;, new tracks &quot;Goodnight Lover&quot; and &quot;Kitten Moon&quot;, the post-album single &quot;Squirt&quot; and reworked older tracks such as &quot;Mosh&quot;, a remix of &quot;Tosh&quot; from &quot;Oto&quot;. David Bennun of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote of &quot;Risotto&quot;:

At this time, reused the Lucky Monkeys name for the release of &quot;Bjango&quot;, a single which included a remix by Fluke themselves.

After touring for a year with &quot;Risotto&quot; on the American &quot;Electric Highway Tour&quot;, and having made two appearances at the Glastonbury festival in 1995 and 1998, Tournier left the group to pursue a different project named Syntax, with the band&#x27;s long standing friend, Jan Burton. They produced just a single album, &quot;Meccano Mind&quot; in March 2004, which in turn produced two moderately successful singles and a live tour supporting Scissor Sisters.

===&quot;Progressive History X&quot; and &quot;Progressive History XXX&quot;===
After Tournier&#x27;s departure, two &quot;Best Of&quot; albums were released, &quot;Progressive History X&quot;, a compilation spanning their entire ten year producing history, and, in 2001, &quot;Progressive History XXX&quot;, a three CD box-set including many rare and hard to find mixes. Both releases were packaged with artwork from &quot;Just Your Average Second On This Planet&quot; 1997–1998, &quot;Discotheque&quot; by David Bethell The box-set contained black, red, white and blue versions of the same original cover art, and had a poster of the silhouette image on one side and all other album covers on the back.

In 2002, The Fluke DJs were formed, a live-show pairing of Fugler and Hugh Bryder. Bryder was a DJ who had assisted Fluke in their live performances since 1993 as well as working with other DJs such as Seb Fontaine while holding a DJ residency at MTV&#x27;s special event parties. This seemed to indicate further rifts within the band as this DJ combination included neither Bryant nor Tournier. However, Fugler denied these rumours shortly after they surfaced claiming that the band merely needed some time away from each other after their intense work on &quot;Risotto&quot;.

===&quot;Puppy&quot;===
In 2000, Fluke produced a promotional CD named &quot;The Xmas Demos&quot;, which included early versions of many of the tracks intended for the album &quot;Puppy&quot;. Speculation about a new album was furthered when, in 2003, the remaining members of Fluke released two singles forming the basis of this next album. Though the aptly titled &quot;Slap It: The Return&quot; signaled a break from the past, with the writing credits listed simply as &quot;Bryant/Fugler&quot; under the Appalooso label, &quot;Pulse&quot; exemplified a much darker style and was released on the One Little Indian label. In 2003, Fluke released their fifth studio album and first without Tournier, &quot;Puppy&quot;, six years after &quot;Risotto&quot;. The name of the album was inspired by Jeff Koons&#x27; fifty foot sculpture of a puppy that stands outside the Guggenheim museum in Bilbao. This album proved to be similar to the earlier &quot;Risotto&quot; tracks in tempo and mood, but with the introduction of some new ideas, such as the inclusion of a blues track, &quot;Blue Sky&quot;, and a very dark techno orientated bonus track, &quot;Pulse&quot;.

The album was not received well critically with most of the critics labelling the album as dated. Andy Gill of &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote:

The only single to be released from &quot;Puppy&quot; after the album&#x27;s release was &quot;Switch&quot;, which was released in CD and vinyl formats. The track was used on the soundtrack for the Electronic Arts video game &quot;Need For Speed Underground 2&quot; but achieved nowhere near the critical or popular acclaim of the singles from &quot;Risotto&quot;, not even appearing in the UK top 40.

===2005 onwards===
In late 2005, Bryant and Fugler teamed up with Jan Burton, Wild Oscar, Robin Goodridge, Dilshani Weerasinghe, Marli Buck and producer Andy Gray to form 2 Bit Pie with a limited release of &quot;Nobody Never&quot;. This track retained the rough vocals and electronic feel that was by now characteristic of Fluke, but had a stronger emphasis on live playback and real instruments. In May 2006, there were club previews of two new 2 Bit Pie songs, &quot;Little Things&quot; and &quot;Here I Come&quot; (). On 4 September 2006, 2 Bit Pie released their first album, &quot;2Pie Island&quot;, in the UK to minimal critical attention. No further albums were released.

In 2009, Fluke briefly reunited for a live performance, including all three original members, with a show at The Tabernacle in London on 10 October 2009.

In 2024, Fluke returned from hiatus with the single &quot;Insanely Beautiful&quot;, released on 29 April 2024.

==Mainstream popularity==
Although Fluke produced music for the better part of two decades, they remained relatively unknown to a large scale audience and the band members themselves are even less recognizable. Fugler insisted in an interview with &quot;The Independent&quot; that the band&#x27;s reclusivity was &quot;less about selfish hedonism&quot; than the revival of &quot;a communal attitude that had long been forgotten.&quot; The main sphere in which the band had success is through their inclusion in advertisements, film and video game soundtracks. Among the more prominent of these appearances was the 2003 film, &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, using the Fluke track &quot;Slap It&quot; (also, &quot;Another Kind of Blues&quot;) renamed to &quot;Zion&quot; for compatibility with the film.

Fluke&#x27;s 1997 hit &quot;Absurd&quot; was used in the trailer for the 2000 remake of &quot;Get Carter&quot;, in the strip club sequence of the 2005 film &quot;Sin City&quot; and the &#x27;Whitewash Edit&#x27; is included on the &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot; soundtrack which tied in with a commercial deal for Ericsson who sponsored the film and then went on to use &quot;Absurd&quot; in its commercials. In addition, it was used in the video game series &quot;NFL QB Club&quot; until its discontinuation in 2002. In the &quot;Knight to King&#x27;s Pawn&quot; episode of the 2008 series of &quot;Knight Rider&quot;, the song &quot;Absurd&quot; was used by KITT to hide a secret message. &quot;Absurd&quot; is also used as the main theme for &quot;Sky Sports&quot;&#x27; &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; program first from August 1997 to May 1998 and since August 2010 to the current day. Where possible Fluke&#x27;s licensing agent, David Steel at V2 Music, tried to ensure that when their tracks are used in films they also appear on the soundtrack album:

This kind of exposure was welcomed by members of the band, as Fugler said in an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot;:

In 1997, Fluke&#x27;s US sales totalled 14,000 which was modest compared with the 200,000 copies of &quot;Dig Your Own Hole&quot; that The Chemical Brothers sold. In an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, Fugler said that he felt that predicted figures for the US electronica boom were overhyped by people who were out of touch with the music scene. &quot;The expectations came from the people who [had] nothing to do with the music, it came from the business level, people not involved with it.&quot; This lack of commercial success has not dampened the spirits of the band however, Fugler going on to say, &quot;It’s not about being on the cover of a magazine.&quot;

==Live performances==
Fluke&#x27;s live shows employed visual effects combining lasers and projected displays. Furthermore, Fluke&#x27;s performances came in two varieties of show: performances as Fluke where the shows consist of entirely original Fluke material and shows under the alias &quot;The Fluke DJs&quot; where a combination of Fluke tracks are mixed with others in the style of a DJ set. Unable to attract major crowds, Fluke resorted to &quot;festival-style&quot; tours along with other acts to draw in a sizeable audience, as was seen with their participation in the &quot;Electric Highway&quot; tour in 1997 where they were joined by The Crystal Method and the &quot;Pukkelpop&quot; festival where they headlined with Metallica among others.

When Fluke was touring for &quot;Risotto&quot; they were joined on stage by Rachel Stewart who acted as a personification of the band&#x27;s official mascot, a character from the &quot;Wipeout&quot; series named Arial Tetsuo. Stewart continued as lead female vocalist and as a dancer for all of Fluke&#x27;s live performances between 1997 and 1999.

While Bryant remained on keyboards and programming and with only Davenport being the constant touring member on guitars, Fugler and Stewart were able to motivate the crowd visually with vocals and dancing while Fluke&#x27;s resident lighting technician, Andy Walton, provided a suitable technology-driven accompaniment to the music. In 2004, Stewart left Fluke indefinitely, instead focusing on a new project with EMF band member James Atkin, named Beauty School.

The number of Fluke&#x27;s live shows decreased significantly after the release of &quot;Puppy&quot; owing to their personal commitments to young families. In the few shows since, they have opted for the Fluke DJs set up, which uses &quot;a battery of laptops and the odd deck&quot; rather than focusing on their live band, an approach which Fugler subsequently referred to as &quot;good fun, but ultimately flawed for the dancefloor.&quot;

Udvarhely county shared borders with the counties of Maros-Torda, Csík, Háromszék, Nagy-Küküllő, and Kis-Küküllő. The county lay in the Carpathian Mountains. Its area was 2,938 km2 around 1910.

==History==
Udvarhely county consisted of three former seats of the Székelys: Udvarhelyszék, Bardóc and Keresztúr (the latter two as filial seats of the former). It was formed in 1876, when the administrative structure of Transylvania was changed. In 1920, by the Treaty of Trianon, the county became part of Romania until 1940 when, by the Second Vienna Award, much of its territory was reassigned to Hungary. After the end of World War II it became again part of Romania. Most of its territory lies in the present-day Romanian county of Harghita, with small parts in Mureș (a small part in the west) and Covasna (a small part in the south-east).

<text>Turkish Cypriots or Cypriot Turks ( or ; ) are ethnic Turks originating from Cyprus. Turkish Cypriots are mainly Sunni Muslims. Following the Ottoman conquest of the island in 1571, about 30,000 Turkish settlers were given land once they arrived in Cyprus. Additionally, many of the island&#x27;s local Christians converted to Islam during the early years of Ottoman rule. Nonetheless, the influx of mainly Muslim settlers to Cyprus continued intermittently until the end of the Ottoman period. Today, while Northern Cyprus is home to a significant part of the Turkish Cypriot population, the majority of Turkish Cypriots live abroad, forming the Turkish Cypriot diaspora. This diaspora came into existence after the Ottoman Empire transferred the control of the island to the British Empire, as many Turkish Cypriots emigrated primarily to Turkey and the United Kingdom for political and economic reasons.

Standard Turkish is the official language of Northern Cyprus. The vernacular spoken by Turkish Cypriots is Cypriot Turkish, which has been influenced by Cypriot Greek, as well as English.

==History==

===Pre-Ottoman Cyprus===
Although there was no settled Muslim population in Cyprus prior to the Ottoman conquest of 1570–71, some Ottoman Turks were captured and carried off as prisoners to Cyprus in the year 1400 during Cypriot raids in the Asiatic and Egyptian coasts. Some of these captives accepted or were forced to convert to Christianity and were baptized; however, there were also some Turkish slaves who remained unbaptized. By 1425, some of these slaves helped the Mamluke army to gain access to Limassol Castle. Despite the release of some of the captives, after the payment of ransoms, most of the baptized Turks continued to remain on the island. The medieval Cypriot historian Leontios Machairas recalled that the baptized Turks were not permitted to leave Nicosia when the Mamlukes approached the city after the battle of Khirokitia in 1426. According to Professor Charles Fraser Beckingham, &quot;there must therefore have been some Cypriots, at least nominally Christian, who were of Turkish, Arab, or Egyptian origin.&quot;

By 1488, the Ottomans made their first attempt at conquering Cyprus when Sultan Bayezid II sent a fleet to conquer Famagusta. However, the attempt failed due to the timely intervention of a Venetian fleet. The Queen of Cyprus, Caterina Cornaro, was forced to relinquish her crown to the Republic of Venice in 1489. In the same year, Ottoman ships were seen off the coast of Karpas and the Venetians began to strengthen the fortifications of the island. By 1500, coastal raids by Ottoman vessels resulted in the heavy loss of Venetian fleets, forcing Venice to negotiate a peace treaty with the Ottoman Empire in 1503. However, by May 1539 Suleiman I decided to attack Limassol because the Venetians had been sheltering pirates who continuously attacked Ottoman ships. Limassol stayed under Ottoman control until a peace treaty was signed in 1540. Cyprus continued to be a haven for pirates who interrupted the safe passage of Ottoman trade ships and Muslim pilgrims sailing to Mecca and Medina. By 1569, pirates captured the Ottoman &quot;defterdar&quot; (treasurer) of Egypt, and Selim II decided to safeguard the sea route from Constantinople to Alexandria by conquering the island and clearing the eastern Mediterranean of all enemies in 1570–71.

===Ottoman Cyprus===

The basis for the emergence of a sizeable and enduring Turkish community in Cyprus emerged when Ottoman troops landed on the island in mid-May 1570 and seized it within a year from Venetian rule. The post-conquest period established a significant Muslim community which consisted of soldiers from the campaign who remained behind and further settlers who were brought from Anatolia as part of a traditional Ottoman population policy. There were also new converts to Islam on the island during the early years of Ottoman rule.

In addition to documented settlement of Anatolian peasants and craftsmen, as well as the arrival of soldiers, decrees were also issued banishing Anatolian tribes, &quot;undesirable&quot; persons, and members of various &quot;troublesome&quot; Muslim sects, principally those officially classified as heretical. This influx of mainly Muslim settlers to Cyprus continued intermittently until the end of the Ottoman period.

Some Turkish Cypriots are descendants of Crypto-Christians, a phenomenon that was not uncommon in the Ottoman Empire given its multi-faith character. In Cyprus, many Latins and Maronites, as well as Greeks, converted to Islam at different points during Ottoman rule for a number of reasons ranging from collectively avoiding heavy taxation to ending an individual woman unhappy marriage. Their artificial embrace of Islam and their secret maintaining of Christianity led this group of crypto-Christians to be known in Greek as Linobambaki or the cotton-linen sect as they changed religion to curry favour with Ottoman officials during the day but practiced Catholicism at night. In 1636 the conditions for the Christians became intolerable and certain Christians decided to become Muslims. According to Palmieri (1905) the Maronites who became Muslims lived mainly in the Nicosia District and despite the fact that the Maronites turned to Muslims they never gave up their Christian faith and beliefs hoping to become Christians. This is why they baptized their children according to the Christian faith, but they also practiced circumcision. They also gave their children two names, a Muslim and a Christian one. Many of the villages and neighbouring areas accepted as Turkish Cypriot estates, were formerly Linobambaki activity centers. These include:
By the second quarter of the nineteenth century, approximately 30,000 Muslims were living in Cyprus, comprising about 35% of the total population. The fact that Turkish was the main language spoken by the Muslims of the island is a significant indicator that the majority of them were either Turkish-speaking Anatolians or otherwise from a Turkic background. Throughout the Ottoman rule, the demographic ratio between Christian &quot;Greeks&quot; and Muslim &quot;Turks&quot; fluctuated constantly. During 1745–1814, the Muslim Turkish Cypriots constituted the majority on the island compared to the Christian Greek Cypriots, being up to 75% of the total island population. However, by 1841, Turks made up 27% of the island&#x27;s population. One of the reasons for this decline is because the Turkish community were obliged to serve in the Ottoman army for years, usually away from home, very often losing their lives in the endless wars of the Ottoman Empire. Another reason for the declining population was because of the emigration trend of some 15,000 Turkish Cypriots to Anatolia in 1878, when the Ottoman Turks handed over the administration of the island to Britain.

===British Cyprus===
By 1878, during the Congress of Berlin, under the terms of the Anglo-Ottoman Cyprus Convention, the Ottoman Turks had agreed to assign Cyprus to Britain to occupy and rule, though not to possess as sovereign territory. According to the first British census of Cyprus, in 1881, 95% of the island&#x27;s Muslims spoke Turkish as their mother tongue. As of the 1920s, the percentage of Greek-speaking Muslims had dropped from 5%, in 1881, to just under 2% of the total Muslim population. During the opening years of the twentieth century Ottomanism became an ever more popular identity held by the Cypriot Muslim intelligentsia, especially in the wake of the Young Turk Revolution of 1908. Increasing numbers of Young Turks who had turned against Sultan Abdul Hamid II sought refuge in Cyprus. A rising class of disgruntled intellectuals in the island&#x27;s main urban centres gradually began to warm to the ideas of positivism, freedom and modernization. Spurred on by the rising calls for &quot;enosis&quot;, the union with Greece, emanating from Greek Cypriots, an initially hesitant &quot;Turkism&quot; was also starting to appear in certain newspaper articles and to be heard in the political debates of the local intelligentsia of Cyprus. In line with the changes introduced in the Ottoman Empire after 1908, the curricula of Cyprus&#x27;s Muslim schools, such as the &quot;Idadi&quot;, were also altered to incorporate more secular teachings with increasingly Turkish nationalist undertones. Many of these graduates in due course ended up as teachers in the growing number of urban and rural schools that had begun to proliferate across the island by the 1920s.

In 1914, the Ottoman Empire joined the First World War against the Allied Forces and Britain annexed the island. Cyprus&#x27;s Muslim inhabitants were officially asked to choose between adopting either British nationality or retaining their Ottoman subject status; about 4,000–8,500 Muslims decided to leave the island and move to Turkey. Following its defeat in World War I, the Ottoman Empire were faced with the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922) whereby the Greek incursion into Anatolia aimed at claiming what Greece believed to be historically Greek territory. For the Ottoman Turks of Cyprus, already fearing the aims of enosis-seeking Greek Cypriots, reports of atrocities committed by the Greeks against the Turkish populations in Anatolia, and the Greek Occupation of Smyrna, produced further fears for their own future. Greek forces were routed in 1922 under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk who, in 1923, proclaimed the new Republic of Turkey and renounced irredentist claims to former Ottoman territories beyond the Anatolian heartland. Muslims in Cyprus were thus excluded from the nation-building project, though many still heeded Atatürk&#x27;s call to join in the establishment of the new nation-state, and opted for Turkish citizenship. Between 1881 and 1927 approximately 30,000 Turkish Cypriots emigrated to Turkey.

The 1920s was to prove a critical decade in terms of stricter ethno-religious compartments; hence, Muslim Cypriots who remained on the island gradually embraced the ideology of Turkish nationalism due to the impact of the Kemalist Revolution. At its core were the Kemalist values of secularism, modernization and westernization; reforms such as the introduction of the new Turkish alphabet, adoption of western dress and secularization, were adopted voluntarily by Muslim Turkish Cypriots, who had been prepared for such changes not just by the Tanzimat but also by several decades of British rule. Many of those Cypriots who until then had still identified themselves primarily as Muslims began now to see themselves principally as Turks in Cyprus.

By 1950, a Cypriot Enosis referendum in which 95.7% of Greek Cypriot voters supported a fight aimed at enosis, the union of Cyprus with Greece were led by an armed organisation, in 1955, called EOKA by Georgios Grivas which aimed at bringing down British rule and uniting the island of Cyprus with Greece. Turkish Cypriots had always reacted immediately against the objective of enosis; thus, the 1950s saw many Turkish Cypriots who were forced to flee from their homes. In 1958, Turkish Cypriots set up their own armed group called Turkish Resistance Organisation (TMT) and by early 1958, the first wave of armed conflict between the two communities began; a few hundred Turkish Cypriots left their villages and quarters in the mixed towns and never returned.

===Republic of Cyprus===
By 16 August 1960, the island of Cyprus became an independent state, the Republic of Cyprus, with power sharing between the two communities under the 1960 Zurich agreements, with Britain, Greece and Turkey as Guarantor Powers. Archbishop Makarios III was elected as president by the Greek Cypriots and Dr. Fazıl Küçük was elected as vice-president by the Turkish Cypriots. However, in December 1963, in the events known as &quot;Bloody Christmas&quot;, when Makarios III attempted to modify the Constitution, Greek Cypriots initiated a military campaign against the Turkish Cypriots and began to attack Turkish inhabited villages; by early 1964, the Turkish Cypriots started to withdraw into armed enclaves where the Greek Cypriots blockaded them, resulting in some 25,000 Turkish Cypriots becoming refugees, or internally &quot;displaced persons&quot;. This resulted in the UN peacekeeping force, UNFICYP, being stationed on the island as well as an external migration trend of thousands more Turkish Cypriots to the United Kingdom, Turkey, North America and Australia. With the rise to power of the Greek military junta, a decade later, in 1974, a group of right-wing Greek nationalists, EOKA B, who supported the union of Cyprus with Greece, launched a putsch. This action precipitated the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, which led to the capture of the present-day territory of Northern Cyprus the following month, after a ceasefire collapsed. The Turkish invasion resulted in the occupation of some 37% of the island in the north. During the invasion of the island, a number of atrocities against the Turkish Cypriot community were committed; such as the Maratha, Santalaris and Aloda massacre by the Greek Cypriot paramilitary organisation EOKA B. After the Turkish invasion and the ensuing 1975 Vienna agreements, 60,000 Turkish Cypriots who lived in the south of the island fled to the north. The 1974–1975 movement was strictly organised by the Provisional Turkish Administration who tried to preserve village communities intact.

===Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus===
In 1983, the Turkish Cypriots declared their own state in the north, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which remains internationally unrecognised, except by Turkey. In 2004, a referendum for the unification of the island, the &quot;Annan Plan&quot;, was accepted by 65% of Turkish Cypriots but rejected by 76% of Greek Cypriots.

==Culture==
The Turkish Cypriots are Turkish-speaking, regard themselves as secular Muslims, and take pride in their Ottoman heritage. However, Turkish Cypriots differentiate themselves from mainlanders, especially from the religiously conservative settlers who have come to Cyprus more recently, but their strong connection to Turkey is nonetheless undisputed. Hence, the Turkish Cypriot identity is based on their ethnic Turkish roots and links to mainland Turkey, but also to their Cypriot character with cultural and linguistic similarities with Greek Cypriots. Their culture is heavily based on family ties linked to parents, siblings, and relatives; one&#x27;s neighbourhood is also considered important as emphasis is given on helping those in need. Thus, much of their lives revolves around social activities, and food is a central feature of gatherings. Turkish Cypriot folk dances, music, and art are also integral parts of their culture.

===Religion===
The majority of Turkish Cypriots (99%) are Sunni Muslims. However, the secularizing force of Kemalism has also exerted an impact on Turkish Cypriots. Religious practices are considered a matter of individual choice and many do not actively practice their religion. Alcohol is frequently consumed within the community and most Turkish Cypriot women do not cover their heads. Turkish Cypriot males are generally circumcised at a young age in accordance with religious beliefs, although, this practice appears more related to custom and tradition than to powerful religious motivation.

The social/religious phenomenon of crypto-Christianity was observed in Cyprus, as in other parts of the Ottoman Empire. The crypto-Christians of Cyprus were known as Linobambaki (= &quot;of linen and cotton&quot;). They are mentioned by foreign travellers as Turks who are secretly Greeks, observing the Greek Orthodox fasting (Turner 1815), drinking wine, eating pork and often taking Christian wives.

===Language===
The Turkish language was introduced to Cyprus with the Ottoman conquest in 1571 and became the politically dominant, prestigious language, of the administration. In the post-Ottoman period, Cypriot Turkish was relatively isolated from standard Turkish and had strong influences by the Cypriot Greek dialect. The condition of coexistence with the Greek Cypriots led to a certain bilingualism whereby Turkish Cypriots&#x27; knowledge of Greek was important in areas where the two communities lived and worked together.

According to Prof. C. F. Beckingham (1957), in Cyprus religious and linguistic divisions do not always coincide. There were &quot;Turkish&quot;, i.e. Muslim villages in which the normal language was Greek. Among them were Lapithiou, Platanisto, Ayios Simeon Beckingham said that this phenomenon has not been adequately investigated. The existence of Greek-speaking Muslims is also mentioned in subsequent works. Ozan Gülle (2014), &quot;it is historically well documented that Turkish Cypriots showed large differences in their frequency of communication in Cypriot Greek [...]: On one end of the spectrum are Turkish Cypriots who were probably monolingual Cypriot Greek speakers or had only little competency in Turkish, ...&quot;.

The linguistic situation changed radically in 1974, following the division of Cyprus into a Greek south and a Turkish north. Today, the Cypriot Turkish dialect is being exposed to increasing standard Turkish through immigration from Turkey, new mass media, and new educational institutions. Nonetheless, a Turkish speaker familiar with the Cypriot Turkish variety of Turkish can still easily identify a member of the community from one who is not. Although many Turkish Cypriots command standard Turkish as well, they generally choose to use their own variety in particular contexts to affirm their identity. Most commonly, these differences are in pronunciation, but they extend to lexicon and grammatical structures as well. There are many words used by Turkish Cypriots that originate in the particular historical circumstances of the island, including English and Greek, and therefore have no precedent in standard Turkish. There are also words used by the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot communities which are authentically Cypriot in origin.

===Music and dances===
Folk music and dancing is an integral part of social life among Turkish Cypriots. Traditional Turkish Cypriot folk dances can be divided into five categories: Karsilamas, Sirtos, Zeybeks, Ciftetellis/Arabiyes, and Topical Dances (such as Orak, Kozan, Kartal and Topal). The folk dancing groups usually have performances during national festivals, weddings, Turkish nights at hotels and within tourism areas.

==Demographics==

===Debates on the Turkish Cypriot population in the 1970s===
The 1960 census of Cyprus reported the Turkish Cypriot population as 18% of the total population. The figure was challenged during a 1978 debate in the British Parliament when Lord Spens stated that there were 400,000 Turkish Cypriots in Cyprus, at least one-fifth of the population.

===2006 Census===
According to the 2006 Northern Cyprus Census, there were 145,443 Turkish Cypriots born on the island who were resident in Northern Cyprus (TRNC). Of the Cypriot-born population, 120,007 had both parents born in Cyprus; 12,628 had one of their parents born in Cyprus and the other born in another country. Thus, 132,635 Turkish Cypriots had at least one parent born in Cyprus.

===2011 Census===
According to the 2011 Northern Cyprus Census, there were 160,207 Turkish Cypriots born on the island who were resident in North Cyprus (TRNC).

==Diaspora==

There was significant Turkish Cypriot emigration from the island during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, mainly to Great Britain, Australia, and Turkey. Emigration from Cyprus has mainly been for economical and political reasons. According to the TRNC Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in 2001, 500,000 Turkish Cypriots were living in Turkey; 200,000 in Great Britain; 40,000 in Australia; some 10,000 in North America; and 5,000 in other countries.

A more recent estimate, in 2011, by the Home Affairs Committee states that there are now 300,000 Turkish Cypriots living in the United Kingdom though Turkish Cypriots themselves claim that the British-Turkish Cypriot community has reached 400,000. Furthermore, recent estimates suggest that there are between 60,000 and 120,000 Turkish Cypriots living in Australia, 5,000 in the United States, 2,000 in Germany, 1,800 in Canada, 1,600 in New Zealand, and a smaller community in South Africa.

===Turkey===

The first mass migration of Turkish Cypriots to Turkey occurred in 1878 when the Ottoman Empire leased Cyprus to Great Britain. The flow of Turkish Cypriot emigration to Turkey continued in the aftermath of the First World War, and gained its greatest velocity in the mid-1920s. Economic motives played an important part of the continued migration to Turkey because conditions for the poor in Cyprus during the 1920s were especially harsh. Thereafter, Turkish Cypriots continued to migrate to Turkey during the Second World War in the 1940s and during the Cyprus conflict of the 1960s and 1970s.

Initially, enthusiasm to emigrate to Turkey was inflated by the euphoria that greeted the birth of the newly established Republic of Turkey and later of promises of assistance to Turks who emigrated. A decision taken by the Turkish Government at the end of 1925, for instance, noted that the Turks of Cyprus had, according to the Treaty of Lausanne, the right to emigrate to the republic, and therefore, families that so emigrated would be given a house and sufficient land. The precise number of those who emigrated to Turkey is a matter that remains unknown. The press in Turkey reported in mid-1927 that of those who had opted for Turkish nationality, 5,000–6,000 Turkish Cypriots had already settled in Turkey. However, many Turkish Cypriots had already emigrated even before the rights accorded to them under the Treaty of Lausanne had come into force.

Metin Heper and Bilge Criss have summarized the migration of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century as follows:
St. John-Jones has analyzed the migration of Turkish Cypriots during early British rule further:
The Turkish Cypriot population in Turkey continued to increase at fluctuating speeds as a result of the Second World War (1939–1945). According to Ali Suat Bilge, taking into consideration the mass migrations of 1878, the First World War, the 1920s early Turkish Republican era, and the Second World War, overall, a total of approximately 100,000 Turkish Cypriots had left the island for Turkey between 1878 and 1945. By 31 August 1955, a statement by Turkey&#x27;s Minister of State and Acting Foreign Minister, Fatin Rüştü Zorlu, at the London Conference on Cyprus, estimated that the total Turkish Cypriot population (including descendants) in Turkey had reached 300,000: 
By 2001 the TRNC Ministry of Foreign Affairs estimated that 500,000 Turkish Cypriots were living in Turkey.

===Palestine===
Turkish Cypriots who remained in Cyprus during the early twentieth century were faced with the harsh economic conditions of the Great Depression under British rule. Consequently, many families in the poorest villages, facing debt and starvation, married off their daughters to Arabs mainly in British Palestine, and other Arab countries, in the hope that they would have a better life. A bride price was normally given by the groom to the family of the girls, usually about £10–20, enough to buy several acres of land at the time, as part of the marriage arrangements. Such payments had not been part of Cypriot tradition, and Cypriots typically describe the girls in these forced marriages as having been &quot;sold&quot;; Arabs however, often object to this characterization. Mostly between the ages of 11–18, the majority of the girls lost contact with their families in Cyprus, and while some had successful marriages and families, others found themselves little more than domestic servants, abused, or ended up working in brothels.

The marriages were sometimes arranged by brokers, who presented the prospective husbands as wealthy doctors and engineers. However, Neriman Cahit, in her book &quot;Brides for Sale&quot;, found that in reality many of these men had mediocre jobs or were already married with children. Unaware of these realities, Turkish Cypriot families continued to send their daughters to Palestine until the 1950s. Cahit estimates that within 30 years up to 4,000 Turkish Cypriot women were sent to Palestine to be married to Arab men.

In recent years second and third generation Palestinians of Turkish Cypriot origin have been applying for Cypriot citizenship; several hundred Palestinians have already been successful in obtaining Cypriot passports.

In 2012 Yeliz Shukri and Stavros Papageorghiou secured financial support for the making of a film on the subject of the &quot;Forgotten Brides&quot;. The documentary, entitled &quot;Missing Fetine&quot;, was released in 2018, and follows the search of Australian-born Turkish Cypriot Pembe Mentesh for her long-lost great-aunt, while investigating the fate of these Turkish Cypriot women.

===United Kingdom===

Turkish Cypriot migration to the United Kingdom began in the early 1920s, the British Empire having formally annexed Cyprus in 1914, with the residents of British-ruled Cyprus becoming subjects of the Crown. Some arrived as students and tourists, while others left the island due to the harsh economic and political life during the British colony of Cyprus. Emigration to the United Kingdom continued to increase when the Great Depression of 1929 brought economic depression to Cyprus, with unemployment and low wages being a significant issue. During the Second World War, the number of Turkish run cafes increased from 20 in 1939 to 200 in 1945 which created a demand for more Turkish Cypriot workers. Throughout the 1950s, Turkish Cypriots emigrated for economic reasons and by 1958 their number was estimated to be 8,500. Their numbers continued to increase each year as rumours about immigration restrictions appeared in much of the Cypriot media.

The 1950s also saw the arrival of many Turkish Cypriots to the United Kingdom due to political reasons; many began to flee as a result of the EOKA struggle and its aim of &quot;enosis&quot;. Once the ethnic cleansing broke out in 1963, and some 25,000 Turkish Cypriots became internally displaced, accounting to about a fifth of their population. The political and economic unrest in Cyprus, after 1964, sharply increased the number of Turkish Cypriot immigrants to the United Kingdom. Many of these early migrants worked in the clothing industry in London, where both men and women could work together; many worked in the textile industry as sewing was a skill which the community had already acquired in Cyprus. Turkish Cypriots were concentrated mainly in the north-east of London and specialised in the heavy-wear sector, such as coats and tailored garments. This sector offered work opportunities where poor knowledge of the English language was not a problem and where self-employment was a possibility.

Once the Turkish Cypriots declared their own state, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, the division of the island led to an economic embargo against the Turkish Cypriots by the Greek Cypriot controlled Republic of Cyprus. This had the effect of depriving the Turkish Cypriots of foreign investment, aid and export markets; thus, it caused the Turkish Cypriot economy to remain stagnant and undeveloped. Due to these economic and political issues, an estimated 130,000 Turkish Cypriots have emigrated from Northern Cyprus since its establishment to the United Kingdom.
==Origins==
Following geological separation of Cyprus from Anatolia, the first people to live in Cyprus came from Anatolia. Before Ottoman rule, Turks came from both Anatolia and Egypt. According to İsmail Bozkurt, the majority of Turkish Cypriots are of Yörük/Türkmen origin from Anatolia, who came after the Ottoman conquest of the island in 1571.

===Genetic studies===

According to genetic studies, there are close connections between modern Anatolian and Cypriot populations. A 2016 study, which focused on patrilineal ancestry, found that among the sampled Near Eastern and Southeastern European populations, Turkish Cypriots had the shortest genetic distances with those from Cyprus, Turkey, Lebanon, Greece, and Sicily.

A 2017 study found that both Turkish Cypriots&#x27; and Greek Cypriots&#x27; patrilineal ancestry derives primarily from a single pre-Ottoman local gene pool. The frequency of total haplotypes shared between Turkish and Greek Cypriots is 7-8%, with analysis showing that none of these are found in Turkey, thus not supporting a Turkish origin for the shared haplotypes. No shared haplotypes were observed between Greek Cypriots and mainland Turkish populations, while total haplotypes shared between Turkish Cypriots and mainland Turks is 3%. Turkish Cypriots also share haplotypes with North Africans to a lesser extent, and have Eastern Eurasian haplogroups (H, C, N, O, Q) – attributed to the arrival of the Ottomans – at a frequency of ~5.5%. Both Cypriot groups show close genetic affinity to Calabrian (southern Italy) and Lebanese patrilineages. The study states that the genetic affinity between Calabrians and Cypriots can be explained as a result of a common ancient Greek (Achaean) genetic contribution, while Lebanese affinity can be explained through several migrations that took place from coastal Levant to Cyprus from the Neolithic (early farmers), the Iron Age (Phoenicians), and the Middle Ages (Maronites and other Levantine settlers during the Frankish era). The predominant haplogroups among both Turkish and Greek Cypriots are J2a-M410, E-M78, and G2-P287.

In a 2019 genome-wide study, Cypriot samples grouped with people from the Levant (Druze, Lebanese and Syrians) and Armenia among the sampled populations from Eurasia and Africa, using cluster analysis based on haplotype-sharing patterns.

Homozygous beta thalassemia in a number of at-risk populations (Greek and Turkish Cypriots, Greeks, Continental Italians and Sardinians) has been prevented at the population level by programmes based on carrier screening, genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis.

<text>Schellenberg (; dialectal: &quot;Schällabärg&quot;) is a municipality in the lowland area of Liechtenstein, on the banks of the Rhine. , it has a population of 1,107 and covers an area of 

==History==
===Early history===

The area was first settled by Celts, then by Rhaetians. Rome conquered the area in 15 BC, and made it part of the province of Rhaetia. The Province later became a county (countship) under Charlemagne. The county was repeatedly divided among heirs.

The Lordship of Schellenberg was purchased by the Counts of Vaduz in 1437 and the two states have been united in fact ever since. After the Swabian War in 1499, both came under Austrian suzerainty. Different dynasties of counts bought and sold them, until their purchase in the early 18th century by the Liechtenstein dynasty, which had been granted princely status in 1706, but which needed to acquire a territory with imperial immediacy in order to vote in the Diet of the Princes of the Empire. The emperor formally united Vaduz and Schellenberg in 1719 as the Principality of Liechtenstein.

===World War II===
The Russian Monument, located in Hinterschellenberg, in the municipality commemorates the asylum given to Russian soldiers during the Second World War. Near the end of World War II, Liechtenstein granted asylum to approximately five hundred soldiers of the First Russian National Army, a collaborationist Russian force within the German Wehrmacht. This act was no small matter, as the country was poor and had difficulty feeding and caring for such a large group of refugees. Eventually, Argentina agreed to resettle the asylum seekers permanently. In contrast, the British repatriated the Russians who fought on the German side to the USSR.

== Administration ==
Schellenberg is administered by the mayor and a 9-person municipal council, elected every four years since 1975. The incumbent mayor is Dietmar Lampert, since 2023.

=== List of mayors (1864–present) ===
==Geography==
Schellenberg territory borders with the Liechtensteiner municipalities of Eschen, Gamprin, Mauren and Ruggell. It borders also with the Austrian municipality of Feldkirch, in the federal state of Vorarlberg.

==Transport==
In Schellenberg there is a small road crossing to Austria, manned by Austrian and Swiss border guards.

==Notable people==
* Gisela Biedermann, physician and politician
* Julia Hassler, Olympic swimmer.
* Fabienne Wohlwend, motor racing driver.

<text>Aristolochia () is a large plant genus with over 500 species that is the type genus of the family Aristolochiaceae. Its members are commonly known as birthwort, pipevine or Dutchman&#x27;s pipe and are widespread and occur in the most diverse climates. Some species, like &quot;A. utriformis&quot; and &quot;A. westlandii&quot;, are threatened with extinction.

&quot;Isotrema&quot; is usually included here, but might be a valid genus. If so, it contains those species with a three-lobed calyx.

==Description==

&quot;Aristolochia&quot; is a genus of evergreen and deciduous lianas (woody vines) and herbaceous perennials. The smooth stem is erect or somewhat twining. The simple leaves are alternate and cordate, membranous, growing on leaf stalks. There are no stipules.

The flowers grow in the leaf axils. They are inflated and globose at the base, continuing as a long perianth tube, ending in a tongue-shaped, brightly colored lobe. There is no corolla. The calyx is one to three whorled, and three to six toothed. The sepals are united (gamosepalous). There are six to 40 stamens in one whorl. They are united with the style, forming a gynostemium. The ovary is inferior and is four to six locular.

These flowers have a specialized pollination mechanism. The plants are aromatic and their strong scent attracts insects. The inner part of the perianth tube is covered with hairs, acting as a fly-trap. These hairs then wither to release the fly, covered with pollen.

The fruit is dehiscent capsule with many endospermic seeds.

The common names &quot;Dutchman&#x27;s pipe&quot; and &quot;pipevine&quot; (e.g. common pipevine, &quot;A. durior&quot;) are an allusion to old-fashioned meerschaum pipes at one time common in the Netherlands and northern Germany. &quot;Birthwort&quot; (e.g. European birthwort &quot;A. clematitis&quot;) refers to these species&#x27; flower shape, resembling a birth canal. 
Aristolochia was first described by the 4th c. BC Greek philosopher and botanist Theophrastus in his ‘’Inquiry of Plants’’ [IX.8.3], and the scientific name &quot;Aristolochia&quot; was developed from Ancient Greek &quot;aristos&quot; (&quot;άριστος&quot;) &quot;best&quot; + &quot;locheia&quot; (&quot;λοχεία&quot;), &quot;childbirth&quot; or &quot;childbed&quot;, relating to its known ancient use in childbirth. The Roman orator Cicero records a different tradition, that the plant was named for the otherwise unknown individual with the common Greek name Aristolochos, who had learned from a dream that it was an antidote for snake bites.

In Australia the invasive &quot;Aristolochia littoralis&quot; is fatal to the caterpillars of &quot;Ornithoptera euphorion&quot; and &quot;O. richmondia&quot; and threatens to displace their proper host, &quot;A. tagala&quot;.

==Herbalism, toxicity and carcinogenicity==
The species &quot;Aristolochia clematitis&quot; was highly regarded as a medicinal plant since the ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans, and on until the Early Modern era; it also plays a role in traditional Chinese medicine. Due to its resemblance to the uterus, the doctrine of signatures held that &quot;birthwort&quot; was useful in childbirth. A preparation was given to women upon delivery to expel the placenta, as noted by the herbalist Dioscurides in the 1st century AD. Despite its presence in ancient medicine, &quot;Aristolochia&quot; is known to contain the lethal toxin aristolochic acid.

The &quot;Bencao Gangmu&quot;, compiled by Li Shi-Zhen in the latter part of the sixteenth century, was based on the author&#x27;s experience and on data obtained from earlier herbals; this Chinese herbal classic describes 1892 &quot;drugs&quot; (with 1110 drawings), including many species of &quot;Aristolochia&quot;. For 400 years, the &quot;Bencao Gangmu&quot; remained the principal source of information in traditional Chinese medicine and the work was translated into numerous languages, reflecting its influence in countries other than China. In the mid-twentieth century, the &quot;Bencao Gangmu&quot; was replaced by modern &quot;Materia Medica&quot;, the most comprehensive source being &quot;Zhong Hua Ben Cao&quot; (&quot;Encyclopedia of Chinese Materia Medica&quot;), published in 1999. The &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; lists 23 species of &quot;Aristolochia&quot;, though with little mention of toxicity. The Chinese government currently lists the following &quot;Aristolochia&quot; herbs: &quot;A. manshuriensis&quot; (stems), &quot;A. fangchi&quot; (root), &quot;A. debilis&quot; (root and fruit), and &quot;A. contorta&quot; (fruit), two of which (&quot;madouling&quot; and &quot;qingmuxiang&quot;) appear in the 2005 Pharmacopoeia of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

In traditional Chinese medicine &quot;Aristolochia&quot; species are used for certain forms of acute arthritis and edema.

Despite the toxic properties of aristolochic acid, naturopaths claim that a decoction of birthwort stimulates the production and increases the activity of white blood cells, or that pipevines contain a disinfectant which assists in wound healing. Also, &quot;Aristolochia bracteolata&quot; is colloquially known as &quot;worm killer&quot; due to supposed antihelminthic activity.

&quot;Aristolochia&quot; taxa have also been used as reptile repellents. &quot;A. serpentaria&quot; (Virginia snakeroot) is thus named because the root was used to treat snakebite, as &quot;so offensive to these reptiles, that they not only avoid the places where it grows, but even flee from the traveler who carries a piece of it in his hand&quot;. &quot;A. pfeiferi&quot;, &quot;A. rugosa&quot;, and &quot;A. trilobata&quot; are also used in folk medicine to treat snakebites.
===Toxicity and carcinogenicity===
In 1993, a series of end-stage renal disease cases was reported from Belgium associated with a weight loss treatment, where &quot;Stephania tetrandra&quot; in a herbal preparation was suspected of being replaced with &quot;Aristolochia fangchi&quot;. More than 105 patients were identified with nephropathy following the ingestion of this preparation from the same clinic from 1990 to 1992. Many required renal transplantation or dialysis. Aristolochia is a component of some Chinese herbal medicines.

&quot;Aristolochia&quot; has been shown to be both a potent carcinogen and kidney toxin. Herbal compounds containing &quot;Aristolochia&quot; are classified as a Group 1 carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Epidemiological and laboratory studies have identified &quot;Aristolochia&quot; to be a dangerous kidney toxin; &quot;Aristolochia&quot; has been shown to be associated with more than 100 cases of kidney failure. Furthermore, it appears as if contamination of grain with European birthwort (&quot;A. clematitis&quot;) is a cause of Balkan nephropathy, a severe renal disease occurring in parts of southeast Europe. In 2001 the UK government banned the sale, supply and importation of any medicinal product consisting of or containing a plant of the genus Aristolochia. Several other plant species that do not cause themselves kidney poisoning, but which were commonly substituted with Aristolochia in the remedies, were prohibited in the same order.

Aristolochic acid was linked to aristolochic acid-associated urothelial cancer in a Taiwanese study in 2012. In 2013, two studies reported that aristolochic acid is a strong carcinogen. Whole-genome and exome analysis of individuals with a known exposure to aristolochic acid revealed a higher rate of somatic mutation in DNA. Metabolites of aristolochic acid enter the cell nucleus and form adducts on DNA. While adducts on the transcribed DNA strand within genes are detected and removed by transcription-coupled repair, the adducts on the non-transcribed strand remain and eventually cause DNA replication errors. These adducts have a preference for adenine bases, and cause A-to-T transversions. Furthermore, these metabolites appear to show a preference for CAG and TAG sequences.

==Garden history==
Due to their spectacular flowers, several species are used as ornamental plants, notably the hardy &quot;A. durior&quot; of eastern North America, which was one of John Bartram&#x27;s many introductions to British gardens; in 1761 Bartram sent seeds he had collected in the Ohio River Valley to Peter Collinson in London, and Collinson gave them to the nurseryman James Gordon at Mile End to raise. The vine was soon adopted for creating for arbors &quot;a canopy impenetrable to the rays of the sun, or moderate rain,&quot; as Dr John Sims noted in &quot;The Botanical Magazine&quot;, 1801.

<text>The Bjelovar-Križevci County (; ) was a historic administrative subdivision of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia. Croatia-Slavonia was an autonomous kingdom within the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen (Transleithania), the Hungarian part of the dual Austro-Hungarian Empire. Its territory is now in northern Croatia. Belovár and Kőrös are the Hungarian names for the cities Bjelovar and Križevci, respectively. The capital of the county was Bjelovar.

==Geography==
The Bjelovar-Križevci County shared borders with the Hungarian county of Somogy, and the Croatian-Slavonian counties of Virovitica, Požega, Varaždin, and Zagreb. The river Drava formed its northeastern border. Its area was around 1910.

==History==
The territory of the Bjelovar-Križevci County was part of the Kingdom of Croatia when it entered a personal union with the Kingdom of Hungary in 1102, and with it became part of the Habsburg monarchy in 1526. However, by then most of the territory of the later county had become part of Ottoman Hungary and remained so until the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699. After that this area became part of the Military Frontier as the Varaždin Generalate, centred on Bjelovar, which was subdivided into the Križevci and Đurđevac districts.

Following the compromise of 1867 which established Austria-Hungary from the Austrian Empire several waves of administrative restructuring took place. In 1871 the Varaždin Generalate was dissolved and it territory integrated into Croatia-Slavonia. This territory, plus parts of the Križevci County and the Kutina exclave of Požega County were reconstituted as the Bjelovar and Križevci Counties. The remainder of the Croatian and Slavonian Military Frontiers were incorporated in 1881, which led to a final restructuring of the counties in 1886; Bjelovar-Križevci County was formed from almost all of the Bjelovar and Križevci Counties.

In 1920 by the Treaty of Trianon the county became part of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed to Yugoslavia) and was formally abolished in 1922 when the Vidovdan Constitution came into force. Since 1991, when Croatia became independent from Yugoslavia, the county has been part of Croatia.

<text>Roman Šebrle (; born 26 November 1974) is a retired decathlete from the Czech Republic. He is considered to be one of the best decathlon athletes of all time. Originally a high jumper, he later switched to the combined events and is a former world record holder in the decathlon, holding the record for over eleven years. In 2001 in Götzis he became the first decathlete ever to achieve over 9,000 points, setting the record at 9,026 points, succeeding his compatriot, Tomáš Dvořák, who had scored 8,994 points two years earlier.

After placing second in the decathlon during the 2000 Summer Olympics, Šebrle won the gold medal in the 2004 Summer Olympics. Tradition dictates the winner of the decathlon holds the title of &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Athlete&quot;.

A panel of experts convened by the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; in 2008 also ranked Šebrle as the world&#x27;s greatest athlete. That very same year, Šebrle finished 6th in the decathlon in the Beijing Olympics.

==Private life==
Šebrle was born in Lanškroun, Czechoslovakia. He studied at &quot;Gymnázium Františka Martina Pelcla&quot; () in Rychnov nad Kněžnou and at Gymnázium Pardubice. Then he studied an extension course of Information Science and Computer Technology.

On 14 October 2000 Šebrle married Eva Kasalová, a former Czech athlete who competed on the track in the 400 and 800 metres. Their son, Štěpán, a professional footballer, was born on 4 September 2002 and their daughter Kateřina on 30 January 2006.

==Sporting career==

===Beginning===
When Roman Šebrle was six years old, he started playing football, but also occasionally took part in athletics competitions. In 1987 he broke his calf bone and shin bone on one leg in a collision with the opponent goalkeeper during a football match. After this incident he had his leg in plaster for 2 months and spent one year learning to walk.

He competed in his first decathlon competition in 1991 in Týniště nad Orlicí, reaching 5,187 points. Then he met coach Jiří Čechák who convinced him to change school from Rychnov nad Kněžnou to Pardubice, where he joined the Track and Field Club in 1992. He improved his decathlon personal best to 7642 points, although he did just light training.

===TJ Dukla Praha===
In 1995 he started his two-year compulsory military service in the Czech Armed Forces. He joined the army sports club Dukla Prague and its group of decathletes led by coach Zdeněk Váňa, and has stayed a member since that time. Thus he is still automatically a soldier of the Czech army, although in fact he does not take part in any military operations or, with a few exceptions, in any military training.

===Achievements===
In 1996 Šebrle achieved a score of over 8,000 points for the first time, reaching 8,210 points at a meeting in Prague. His first big success came in 1997, when he won the World University Games in Sicily and came ninth at the World Championships in Athens. In 1999 he was successful at the World Indoor Championships in Maebashi, where he won bronze in the heptathlon, and one year later at the European Indoor Athletics Championships in Ghent, where he took silver.

By the end of the discus discipline at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, after Estonian Erki Nool was red-flagged three times by the discus judge, it seemed that Roman Šebrle was on course for the gold medal. However, the competition referee overruled the decision and Šebrle finally took silver.

In March 2001 he won the first major tournament – the World Indoor Championships in Lisbon – and in May he shocked the world with a new world record of 9,026 points, marking the first time a decathlete has ever broken the illustrious 9,000 point barrier. However, due to an injury he couldn&#x27;t do himself justice and finished a disappointed 10th in the World Championships in Edmonton.
Šebrle then left the Váňa&#x27;s group and started to train with coach Dalibor Kupka in the same club. In 2002 he won both European Indoor Championships in Vienna and European Championships in Munich. In 2004 in Athens he finally won the Olympic Games, reaching 8,893 points and thus beating the 20-year-old Olympic record set by the British decathlete Daley Thompson in the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. After the victory in Athens, the Czech minister of defence promoted him to the rank of major.

Šebrle&#x27;s best World Championships results were gold in 2007 (Osaka) and silver in 2003 (Paris) and 2005 (Helsinki). He was also successful at the World Indoor Championships in heptathlon, taking gold in 2001 (Lisbon) and 2004 (Budapest, beating the European record with 6,438 points), and bronze in 1999 (Maebashi), 2003 (Birmingham) and 2006 (Moscow). In 2005 he won the European Indoor Championships in heptathlon (Madrid), in 2006 the European Championships in decathlon for the second time (Gothenburg) and in 2007 he got his third European indoor gold (Birmingham).

The sum of his personal bests in individual disciplines is 9,326 points (the third ever best after Dan O&#x27;Brien and Mike Smith). He is the only decathlete who finished 40 decathlon competitions with the score over 8,000 points and 20 competitions with the score over 8,500 points ().
Šebrle was also voted the Best Czech Athlete of the Year five times in a row (2002–2006), and in 2004 he received the title of the Czech Sportsman of the Year. In 2002 he received the Guth-Jarkovský Trophy for his world record, which is awarded by the Czech Olympic Committee for the best performance by a Czech athlete achieved during the previous year.

===Javelin injury===
On 22 January 2007, Šebrle was hurt by a javelin thrown by a South African female javelin thrower, Sunette Viljoen, from a distance of 55 metres while training in South Africa. The javelin pierced the edge of his right shoulder from the front, 12 cm deep. Shocked, Šebrle ripped the javelin out immediately, which could have caused even more damage. It did not cause any serious injury however, because it slipped between a muscle and his skin. He was taken to a hospital, but left soon with just eleven stitches. However, he was limited in training for some time, especially in the pole vault. Later he stated that he was only 20 cm away from being killed and 1 cm from an injury that would have ended his career.

<text>Wols was the pseudonym of Alfred Otto Wolfgang Schulze (27 May 19131 September 1951), a German painter and photographer predominantly active in France. Though broadly unrecognized in his lifetime, he is considered a pioneer of lyrical abstraction, one of the most influential artists of the Tachisme movement. He is the author of a book on art theory entitled &quot;Aphorismes de Wols&quot;.

==Biography==
Alfred Otto Wolfgang Schulze was born in Berlin in 1913 into a wealthy family; his father was a high-ranking civil servant and patron of the arts who maintained friendships with many prominent artists of the period, including Otto Dix. In 1919, the family moved to Dresden, where subsequently he found his love for art in 1927. In 1924, Schulze was given a still camera, an event that, along with the death of his father in 1929, became one of the defining moments of his life. In 1930 he began to pursue an apprenticeship with his camera at the Reiman-Schule, the Berlin school of applied art. He was a multifaceted man who was capable of teaching German, painting, and capturing photographs of portrait landscape.
After abandoning school, Schulze pursued several interests, including ethnography before moving to Paris in 1932 on the advice of László Moholy-Nagy. After visiting Germany in 1933, he decided not to return, instead traveling to Barcelona, Majorca, and Ibiza, where he worked odd jobs, including a stint as a taxicab driver and a German tutor.

In 1936, he received official permission to live in Paris with the help of Fernand Léger; as an army deserter, Schulze had to report to the Paris police on a monthly basis. Beginning in 1937, he actively worked on his photographs, which were shown in many of Paris&#x27;s most prestigious galleries. He befriended luminaries of the period, including Max Ernst and Jacques Prévert. As a German national, Schulze (like Ernst) was interned at the start of World War II, but he managed to escape and hide in Cassis near Marseilles, where he passed the time drawing and painting in watercolor. In 1942 he fled from the Germans to the safety of Montelimar.

He spent most of the war trying to emigrate to the United States, an unsuccessful and costly enterprise that may have driven him to alcoholism. Upon his return to Paris, after the hype from the war had died down, he had his first exhibition of watercolors in December 1945 at the Galerie René Drouin, where despite the lack of commercial success he made an impression on the circle of intellectuals around the gallery. These included Jean Paulhan, Francis Ponge, Georges Limbour and André Malraux. The small works were displayed in light boxes. A second exhibition in the same gallery two years later saw greater recognition. His paintings represented a rejection of figuration and abstraction, and a projection into a metaphysical plane.
In the years following the war, Schulze concentrated on painting and etching. His health declined severely towards the end of the 1940s; in 1951 he died of food poisoning at the Hotel Montalembert in Paris, after releasing himself from hospital against medical advice. After his death his works were shown at the Kassel documenta (1955), documenta II (1959) and documenta III (1964).

===Artistic style===

Wols&#x27; painting style, as early as 1946–47 (&quot;Untitled&quot;, 1946–47, &quot;Yellow Composition&quot;, 1946–7; Berlin, Neue N.G., &quot;It&#x27;s All Over The City&quot;, 1947), was informal, gestural, with the paint applied in layers by means of dripping and with scratching into the surface. This new development in art proved influential, earning him the praise of artists such as Georges Mathieu and critics such as Michel Tapié, who coined the term &quot;Art autre&quot; (the Other Art) to describe the new style.

Wols was noted for his etchings and for his use of stains (&quot;taches&quot;) of color dabbed onto the canvas (as exemplified by his painting &quot;Composition&quot;, c. 1950). His painted work contains figurative elements as well as free improvisations and abstract elements. Spontaneity and immediateness determine the creative work of Wols, who never underwent any formal artistic training. Randomness (initially inspired by the Surrealist psychic Automatism) plays an important role in his unstructured compositions. In later years Wols was particularly interested in the combination of powerful brushstrokes with a relief-like painted surface structure.

===Influences===
His inspiration to become an artist derived from the work of the artists Paul Klee, Otto Dix and George Grosz. His advisor Moholy-Nagy instructed him to pursue his artistic endeavours in Paris. His encounters with Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir awakened a lively interest in the philosophy of Existentialism. In the late 1940s Sartre chose to promote his abstract art.

<text>Kinobe is a British electronic music group, founded in west London in 1998 by childhood friends Mark Blackburn and Julius Waters. Blackburn departed in 2004, replaced by Dave Pemberton. Chuck Norman replaces Pemberton for their 2017 releases.

Kinobe first came to prominence with their single &quot;Slip Into Something More Comfortable&quot; (sampling Engelbert Humperdinck&#x27;s &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;) during the late 1990s/early 2000s boom for chilled electronic music, alongside Lemon Jelly, Bonobo and Bent. The track featured on numerous TV, film and compilation soundtracks and was reissued in 2016 with new remixes featuring Psychemagik, Stephen Hague, Shibumi and Enginearz.

Kinobe followed up the success of the single with a series of albums that featured continued use of sampling and live instruments, while also introducing guest vocalists.

In May 2017, after an eight year hiatus, Kinobe released &quot;The Firebird EP&quot;. The title track was accompanied by a vintage skateboarding video, featuring legendary Seventies downhill speed champ, Guy ‘Grundy’ Spagnoli.

A further EP, &quot;Thought It Was You EP&quot;, was released in July 2017, comprising four new songs: the title track featuring vocals from the Donny Hathaway-esque songwriter Rich Hale, &quot;Summer Rain&quot; sung by model and songwriter Lucy Chapman, and two instrumentals &quot;Sunray&quot; and &quot;Watch The Skies&quot;. The video for the latter contained edited sections of a General Motors promotional video &#x27;Designed for Dreaming&#x27;

In August 2018, they released &quot;Golden Age&quot;, their first full length album since 2009, with lead single &quot;Little Words&quot;. This was followed in October 2019 by &quot;Golden Dubs&quot;, an instrumental album based on the previous years’ &quot;Golden Age&quot;.

<text>The First Baptist Church is one of six National Historic Landmarks in Columbus, Indiana, United States. It was designed by distinguished architect Harry Weese; construction was completed in 1965. Since completion, few alterations have been made and the building has retained its integrity. It was one of the first church designs to integrate Modern movement architecture and a non-traditional church plan.

== Location ==
The First Baptist Church of Columbus is located at 3300 Fairlawn Drive in Columbus, Indiana. It occupies one-third of an open area in a suburban neighborhood of single-family homes developed in the 1960s and 1970s. Richards Elementary School (designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes and built in 1965) and Par 3 Golf Course and Clubhouse (designed by Bruce Adams and built in 1972) comprise the other two-thirds of the &quot;town square&quot;. These structures are easily visible as they create the skyline of this residential subdivision.

== Description ==

The First Baptist Church was one of Columbus&#x27;s early . It occupied a previous site (which has not been preserved) before moving to Fairlawn Drive in 1965. The facility occupies a site at the base of a gently sloping hill which the group chose because the site allowed room for growth and parking. The parcel originally contained a row of walnut trees along its southern boundary, however other trees have been planted on the grounds.

The red brick building has five distinct sections (narthex, sanctuary, office wing, fellowship hall, and chapel) built around a central courtyard. The windows are tall and narrow.

The sanctuary is the principal interior space of the building. It is a windowless room, made up of simple elements that combine to create a space that is at the same time dramatic and serene. Each element is a simple object—a brick wall, a beam, an opening, a skylight—but all exaggerated slightly in size, proportion, or height.

<text>Dilip Narayan Sardesai (; 8 August 1940 – 2 July 2007) was an Indian international cricketer. He played Tests for the Indian national team as a batsman, the first Goa-born cricketer to play for India, and was often regarded as one of India&#x27;s best batsmen against spin, although Indian batsmen have been known to play better against spin.

==Early life and career==
Sardesai grew up in a Gaud Saraswat Brahmin family of Margao, a town in the erstwhile Portuguese India (in the present-day Indian State of Goa). He studied in the New Era high school there. The region had no cricketing infrastructure during his growing days in the early 1950s. His family moved to Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1957, when Sardesai was 17. He attended the city&#x27;s Wilson College where his cricketing talent was spotted by coach &#x27;Manya&#x27; Naik. He also studied at the Siddharth College of Arts, Science and Commerce in Fort, Mumbai.

Sardesai made his first mark in cricket in the inter-university Rohinton Baria Trophy in 1959–60 where he made 435 runs at an average of 87. He would later recall that he was called up for the trials for the Combined Universities team that was to play the touring Pakistan side in 1960–61. Impressed by his technique, Lala Amarnath, the chairman of selectors, drafted him into the team. Sardesai made the playing XI, thus making his first-class debut, against Pakistan in Pune in November 1960. Sardesai went on to make 87 in 194 minutes in his only innings of the match, while also taking Hanif Mohammad&#x27;s catch with his fielding. In his next game, playing for Board President&#x27;s XI against the same Pakistan side prior to the Fourth Test of the tour, he scored an unbeaten century (106 in 260 minutes), putting together a 134-run stand with Vijay Mehra for the third wicket.

==Test career==
Sardesai had little to show in first class cricket in 1961–62, except for a 281 against Gujarat in a university match. He was included in the India team for the Second Test of England&#x27;s India tour, in Kanpur, in December 1961. Leading up to the Test, he was described as an &quot;aggressive strokeplayer&quot;. In his debut innings Sardesai made 28 before he was out hit wicket while trying to late-cut spinner Tony Lock through the vacant slip region to the third man boundary. His innings lasted 108 minutes. Sardesai toured the West Indies later in the season, playing in three of the five Tests. He was captain Nari Contractor&#x27;s opening partner in a tour game against Barbados that saw the former hit on the head by a Charlie Griffith delivery after Sardesai had lost his wicket. Contractor&#x27;s injury created a place for Sardesai in the Test team. He scored 31 and 60 in the Test at Bridgetown, opening the batting, but was dropped after he was dismissed for a pair in the following match. Sardesai scored 449 runs in the five Test series against England in 1963–64 with 79 and 87 in the Fifth and final Test as the most notable performances, helping India to secure a draw after being made to follow on.

Against New Zealand in 1964–65, Sardesai scored a double century at Bombay and a very fast hundred that set up a win at Delhi. New Zealand had forced India to follow on at Bombay, but Sardesai&#x27;s unbeaten double-century nearly won the match for India. He played against West Indies in 1966–67, and then toured England in 1967, where he injured himself on a staircase in the pavilion at Lord&#x27;s and missed the First Test at Headingley. He recovered to appear in the Second Test back at Lord&#x27;s, but a broken finger sustained during that match ended his tour. He was dropped after two Tests in Australia in 1967–68 due to injury and a series of failures.

Sardesai&#x27;s career had seemed over until he was picked for the Indian tour of West Indies in 1970–71. In the First Test at Kingston, India lost the first five wickets for 75, before Sardesai hit 212 runs and took the total to 387. His 112 in the next Test at Port of Spain led to India&#x27;s first victory over West Indies. This innings made him the first Indian to score a double century outside India. He hit another 150 in the Fourth Test after India were 70 for 6. His 642 runs in the series stood as an Indian record for five days before Sunil Gavaskar went past it. It was India&#x27;s first victory over West Indies in a series and Vijay Merchant, the chairman of selectors, called Sardesai the &quot;renaissance man of Indian cricket&quot;. Sardesai scored 54 and 40 in the Indian win over England at the Oval in 1971, which led to another series win. His career ended one Test later, and he retired from all cricket at the end of the 1972–73 season.

Sardesai played for Bombay in the Ranji Trophy in 13 seasons, between 1961 and 1973, including 10 finals, and never finished on the losing side. He scored 199 against Rajasthan in the 1967 final. In the semi-final against the same team two years later, he was Mankaded by Kailash Gattani. Sardesai&#x27;s final first-class match was the famous Ranji Trophy final against Madras in 1972–73, which ended on the first ball of the third day. Sardesai scored over 1,000 first-class runs in three domestic seasons, with a career best of 1,429 runs in 1964–65, which included his highest first-class score of 222, for Associated Cement Company against Indian Starlets in the final of the Moin-ud-Dowlah Gold Cup Tournament.

== Personal life and post retirement ==
Sardesai first met Nandini Pant (born 1945) in Mumbai&#x27;s Berry&#x27;s restaurant when she was holidaying in the city after her exams. Sardesai was a university cricketer during the time. The two kept in touch during the latter&#x27;s tour of the Caribbean with Indian team in 1961–62, before marrying a couple of years later. Pant worked as a sociology professor for 35 years and later as member of the Central Board of Film Certification till 2015. She is currently a visiting faculty in some of Mumbai&#x27;s leading colleges. Sardesai&#x27;s cousin Sopandev was also a cricketer, who played as a wicket-keeper in the first-class level for Rajputana. The Sardesais had three children together: son Rajdeep, and two daughters. Rajdeep is a television journalist and former cricketer. As a cricketer, he earned an Oxford University blue, before beginning a career in journalism. He was the editor-in-chief of IBN18 Network prior to his resignation in 2014; his wife Sagarika Ghose is also a journalist. One of Dilip&#x27;s daughters, Shonali, is a senior social scientist with the World Bank in Washington, D.C.

After retirement from cricket, Sardesai would split his time between his residences in Mumbai and Goa. In June 2007, he was admitted to a hospital in Mumbai for a chest infection. Suffering from kidney ailment during the time, he was on dialysis. He died on 2 July from multiple organ failure. The last rites were performed by Rajdeep at Mumbai&#x27;s Chandanwadi crematorium the following day.

Sardesai was popularly known as &#x27;Sardee-Singh&#x27;. During his successful 1970–71 tour there, Sardesai was asked at the airport whether he had anything to declare. &#x27;I have come here with runs&#x27;, he replied, &#x27;and I&#x27;ll go back with more&#x27;.
On 8 August 2018, search engine Google commemorated Sardesai with a Doodle on his 78th birth anniversary.

The Directorate of Sports and Youth Affairs, Government of Goa, instituted the Dilip Sardesai Sports Excellence Award in 2009, which is given on the occasion of National Sports Day (29 August) each year. The award consists of a bronze plaque of Sardesai, a citation and a purse of 200,000. It is presented to achievers among Goan sportspersons who represented India at any international-level sports competition during the preceding year.

<text>PerlMonks is a community website covering all aspects of Perl programming and other related topics such as web applications and system administration. It is often referred to by users as &#x27;The Monastery&#x27;.
The name PerlMonks, and the general style of the website, is designed to both humorously reflect the almost religious zeal that programmers sometimes have for their favorite language, and also to engender an atmosphere of calm reflection and consideration for other users.

Users (referred to as monks) create discussion topics which other monks can reply to and vote as good or bad. Users have an experience rating (XP) that roughly measures their participation in the PerlMonks website as perceived by the other monks, not necessarily their proficiency in the Perl language. All monks have a &#x27;home node&#x27;, providing profile information and an area for Monks to personalize.

Notable members include the creator of the Perl language, the authors of several well-known Perl books
and the authors of numerous CPAN modules. CPAN authors frequently promote and provide support for their modules
at PerlMonks.

== Features ==
The site has tutorials, reviews, Q&amp;A, poetry, obfuscated code, as well as sections for code snippets and entire scripts and modules.

Generally, the section of the site with the most traffic is Seekers of Perl Wisdom, where users of all experience levels ask Perl-related questions. Some questions are from beginners trying to understand the basics of the language, while others are from seasoned veterans looking for methods to improve upon algorithms or to optimize performance. Those who provide answers are also of varying experience levels.

Much of the site&#x27;s content consists of specific code examples. Some of these examples are for Perl&#x27;s core features, as documented on the official Perl documentation website (http://perldoc.perl.org). Other examples are for the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN), which is a repository for Perl libraries (known as modules) that are not part of the core Perl distribution.

The code that the site runs on is a much hacked fork of an early version of the Everything Engine and was created by Nathan Oostendorp as part of Blockstackers Intergalactic — the firm that also ran Slashdot. As a result, PerlMonks has many features in common with both Everything2 and Slashdot like its strong emphasis placed on user feedback.

Another feature that PerlMonks retains from Everything is the Chatterbox, which is a text chat area at the side of every page. Logged-in users can type in anything they want, and it appears for all users to see. Talk in the chatterbox is often Perl related, and various tools (written in Perl) have been written to improve the chatterbox experience. Some come to PerlMonks primarily for the chatterbox. Others find the chatterbox distracting and turn it off.

<doc id="934672" wikidata="Q284526" url="?curid=934672" title="Constant-velocity joint">
<text>A constant-velocity joint (also called a CV joint and homokinetic joint) is a mechanical coupling which allows the shafts to rotate freely (without an appreciable increase in friction or backlash) and compensates for the angle between the two shafts, within a certain range, to maintain the same velocity.

A common use of CV joints is in front-wheel drive vehicles, where they are used to transfer the engine&#x27;s power to the wheels, even as the angle of the driveshaft varies due to the operation of the suspension.

== History ==

The predecessor to the constant-velocity joint was the universal joint (also called a &quot;Cardan joint&quot;) which was invented by Gerolamo Cardano in the 16th century. A short-coming of the universal joint is that the rotational speed of the output shaft fluctuates despite the rotational speed of the input shaft being constant. This fluctuation causes unwanted vibration in the system and increases as the angle between the two shafts increases. A constant-velocity joint does not have this fluctuation in output speed and therefore does not possess this unwanted vibration. Also, although universal joints are simple to produce and can withstand large forces, universal joints often become &quot;notchy&quot; and difficult to rotate as the angle of operation increases.

The first type of constant-velocity joint was the &quot;Double Hooke&#x27;s (Double Cardan) Joint&quot; which was invented by Robert Hooke in the 17th century. This design uses two universal joints connected by a shaft and offset by 90 degrees thereby cancelling out the speed variations inherent in each individual joint. 

Many other types of constant-velocity joints have been invented since then.
== Types ==

=== Double Cardan Joint ===

Double Cardan Joints are similar to Hooke&#x27;s use of two universal joints except that the length of the intermediate shaft is shortened leaving only the yokes; this effectively allows the two Hooke&#x27;s joints to be mounted back to back. DCJs are typically used in steering columns, as they eliminate the need to correctly phase the universal joints at the ends of the intermediate shaft (IS), which eases packaging of the IS around the other components in the engine bay of the car. They are also used to replace Rzeppa style constant-velocity joints in applications where high articulation angles, or impulsive torque loads are common, such as the driveshafts and halfshafts of rugged four-wheel drive vehicles. 

To be truly constant-velocity, Double Cardan joints require a centering element that will maintain equal angles between the driven and driving shafts. This centering device requires additional torque to accelerate the internals of the joint and does generate some additional vibration at higher speeds.

=== Tracta joints ===

The Tracta joint works on the principle of the double tongue and groove joint. It comprises only four individual parts: the two forks (a.k.a. yokes, one driving and one driven) and the two semi-spherical sliding pieces (one called male or spigot swivel and another called female or slotted swivel) which interlock in a floating (movable) connection. Each yoke jaw engages a circular groove formed on the intermediate members. Both intermediate members are coupled together in turn by a swivel tongue and grooved joint. When the input and output shafts are inclined at some working angle to each other, the driving intermediate member accelerates and decelerates during each revolution. Since the central tongue and groove joint are a quarter of a revolution out of phase with the yoke jaws, the corresponding speed fluctuation of the driven intermediate and output jaw members exactly counteracts and neutralizes the speed variation of the input half member. Thus the output speed change is identical to that of the input drive, providing constant velocity rotation.

=== Rzeppa joints ===

A Rzeppa joint (invented by Alfred H. Rzeppa in 1926) consists of a spherical inner shell with 6 grooves in it and a similar enveloping outer shell. Each groove guides one ball. The input shaft fits in the centre of a large, steel, star-shaped &quot;gear&quot; that nests inside a circular cage. The cage is spherical but with ends open, and it typically has six openings around the perimeter. This cage and gear fit into a grooved cup that has a splined and threaded shaft attached to it. Six large steel balls sit inside the cup grooves and fit into the cage openings, nestled in the grooves of the star gear. The output shaft on the cup then runs through the wheel bearing and is secured by the axle nut.

This joint can accommodate the large changes of angle when the front wheels are turned by the steering system; typical Rzeppa joints allow 45°–48° of articulation, while some can give 54°. At the &quot;outboard&quot; end of the driveshaft a slightly different unit is used. The end of the driveshaft is splined and fits into the outer &quot;joint&quot;. It is typically held in place by a circlip.

=== Birfield joints ===
The Birfield joint is a type of constant-velocity joint based on the Rzeppa joint but confined the travel of the six balls using elliptical tracks. They have improved efficiency and are widely used in modern cars for the outboard driveshaft joints. The Birfield joint was developed by Birfield Industries and came into widespread use with the development of front-wheel drive cars such as the Mini.

=== Tripod joints ===

Tripod joints are used at the inboard end of car driveshafts. The joints were developed by Michel Orain, of Glaenzer Spicer of Poissy, France. This joint has a three-pointed yoke attached to the shaft, which has barrel-shaped roller bearings on the ends. These fit into a cup with three matching grooves, attached to the differential. Since there is only significant movement in one axis, this simple arrangement works well. These also allow an axial &#x27;plunge&#x27; movement of the shaft, so that engine rocking and other effects do not preload the bearings. A typical Tripod joint has up to 50 mm of plunge travel, and 26 degrees of angular articulation. The tripod joint does not have as much angular range as many of the other joint types, but tends to be lower in cost and more efficient. Due to this it is typically used in rear-wheel drive vehicle configurations or on the inboard side of front-wheel drive vehicles where the required range of motion is lower.

=== Weiss joints ===
A Weiss joint consists of two identical ball yokes which are positively located (usually) by four balls. The two joints are centered by means of a ball with a hole in the middle. Two balls in circular tracks transmit the torque while the other two preload the joint and ensure there is no backlash when the direction of loading changes.

Its construction differs from that of the Rzeppa in that the balls are a tight fit between two halves of the coupling and that no cage is used. The center ball rotates on a pin inserted in the outer race and serves as a locking medium for the four other balls. When both shafts are in line, that is, at an angle of 180 degrees, the balls lie in a plane that is 90 degrees to the shafts. If the driving shaft remains in the original position, any movement of the driven shaft will cause the balls to move one half of the angular distance. For example, when the driven shaft moves through an angle of 20 degrees, the angle between the two shafts is reduced to 160 degrees. The balls will move 10 degrees in the same direction, and the angle between the driving shaft and the plane in which the balls lie will be reduced to 80 degrees. This action fulfills the requirement that the balls lie in the plane that bisects the angle of drive. This type of Weiss joint is known as the Bendix-Weiss joint.

The most advanced plunging joint which works on the Weiss principle is the six-ball star joint of Kurt Enke. This type uses only three balls to transmit the torque, while the remaining three center and hold it together. The balls are preloaded and the joint is completely encapsulated.

=== Thompson joints ===

The Thompson joint (also known as a &quot;Thompson coupling&quot;) assembles two cardan joints within each other to eliminate the intermediate shaft. A control yoke is added to keep the input and output shafts aligned. The control yoke uses a spherical pantograph scissor mechanism to bisect the angle between the input and output shafts and to maintain the joints at a relative phase angle of zero. The alignment ensures constant angular velocity at all joint angles. Eliminating the intermediate shaft and keeping the input shafts aligned in the homokinetic plane greatly reduces the induced shear stresses and vibration inherent in double cardan shafts. While the geometric configuration does not maintain constant velocity for the control yoke that aligns the cardan joints, the control yoke has minimal inertia and generates little vibration. Continuous use of a standard Thompson coupling at a straight-through, zero-degree angle will cause excessive wear and damage to the joint; a minimum offset of 2 degrees between the input and output shafts is needed to reduce control yoke wear. Modifying the input and output yokes so that they are not precisely normal to their respective shafts can alter or eliminate the &quot;disallowed&quot; angles.

The novel feature of the coupling is the method for geometrically constraining the pair of cardan joints within the assembly by using, for example, a spherical four bar scissors linkage (spherical pantograph) and it is the first coupling to have this combination of properties.

== Usage in cars ==
Early front-wheel drive vehicles (such as the 1930s Citroen Traction Avant) and the front axles of off-road four-wheel drive vehicles used universal joints rather than CV joints. Amongst the first cars to use CV joints were the 1926 Tracta, the 1931 DKW F1 and the 1932 Adler Trumpf, all of which were front-wheel drive and used the Tracta joint design under licence. The CV joints allowed a smooth transfer of power over a wider range of operating angles (such as when the suspension is compressed by cornering force or a bump in the road).

Modern rear-wheel drive cars with independent rear suspension typically use CV joints at the ends of the half-shafts and increasingly use them on the tailshaft.

=== CV boots and lubrication ===
A separate flexible cover is usually installed over the CV joint, to protect it from foreign particles and prevent the lubricating grease from leaking out. This cover is usually made of rubber and called a &quot;CV boot&quot; or &quot;CV gaiter&quot;. Cracks and splits in the boot will allow contaminants in, which would cause the joint to wear quickly or completely fail. An all-metal universal joint or CV located inside and protect by a solid axle (housing), swivel hub or closed knuckle may be desirable in harsh operating environments, where rubber is prone to physical or chemical damage. Metal armour and kevlar sleeves/covers may be used to protect rubber CV boots.

The CV joint is usually lubricated by molybdenum disulfide grease. The six spheres are bounded by an anti-fall gate that prevents the spheres from falling when the shaftings are perfectly aligned.

<text>Richard Sterne (c. 1596–1683) was a Church of England priest, Archbishop of York from 1664 to 1683.

==Life==
He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated MA in 1618, BD in 1625 and DD in 1635. He was elected a fellow of Benet College (now Corpus Christi College), Cambridge in 1623 and then served as Master of Jesus College, Cambridge, from 1634.

Around 1633, he became chaplain to Archbishop Laud. From 1642, he held the rectories of Yeovilton and Harleton. A Royalist, he was arrested and imprisoned by the Parliamentarians later the same year. In 1644, he was formally dismissed as Master of Jesus and, in 1645, he lost his rectories, although he was released from prison.

At the Restoration in 1660, Sterne was appointed Bishop of Carlisle — he was elected to the See on 15 November 1660, confirmed 1 December, and consecrated a bishop on 2 December 1660. From there he was translated to York in 1664 — he was elected to that See on 28 April and confirmed on 31 May. He is said to have been one of those who assisted in revising the Book of Common Prayer in 1662. He also assisted Brian Walton with the English Polyglot Bible and himself wrote &quot;Summa Logicae&quot; (published posthumously in 1685). He founded scholarships at both Corpus Christi and Jesus Colleges.

His great-grandson Laurence Sterne attended Jesus College, Cambridge, and would find literary fame in the 1760s as author of &quot;The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gent.&quot; and live as a curate and parson in Yorkshire.

<text>Digital obsolescence is the risk of data loss because of inabilities to access digital assets, due to the hardware or software required for information retrieval being repeatedly replaced by newer devices and systems, resulting in increasingly incompatible formats. While the threat of an eventual &quot;digital dark age&quot; (where large swaths of important cultural and intellectual information stored on archaic formats becomes irretrievably lost) was initially met with little concern until the 1990s, modern digital preservation efforts in the information and archival fields have implemented protocols and strategies such as data migration and technical audits, while the salvage and emulation of antiquated hardware and software address digital obsolescence to limit the potential damage to long-term information access.

== Background ==

A false sense of security persists regarding digital documents: because an infinite number of identical copies can be created from original files, many users assume that their documents have a virtually indefinite shelf life. In reality, the mediums utilized for digital information storage and access present unique preservation challenges compared to many of the physical formats traditionally handled by archives and libraries. Paper materials and printed media migrated to film-based microform, for example, can be accessible for centuries if created and maintained under ideal conditions, compared to mere decades of physical stability offered by magnetic tape and disk or optical formats. Therefore, digital media have more urgent preservation concerns than the gradual change in written or spoken language experienced with the printed word.

Little professional thought in the fields of library and archival science was directed toward the topic of digital obsolescence as the use of computerized systems grew more widespread and commonplace, but much discussion began to emerge in the 1990s. Despite this, few options were proposed as genuine alternatives to the standard method of continuously migrating data to increasingly newer storage media, employed since magnetic tape began succeeding paper punch cards as practical data storage in the 1960s and 1970s. These basic migration practices persist into the modern era of hard disk and solid-state drives as research has shown many digital storage mediums frequently last considerably shorter in the field compared to manufacturer claims or laboratory testing, leading to the facetious observation that &quot;digital documents last forever—or five years, whichever comes first.&quot;

The causes for digital obsolescence aren’t always purely technical. Capitalistic accumulation and consumerism have been labeled key motivators toward digital obsolescence in society, with newly introduced products frequently assigned greater value than older products. Digital preservation relies on the continuous maintenance and usage of hardware and software formats, which the threat of obsolescence can interfere with. Four types of digital obsolescence exist in the realm of hardware and software access:.
* Functional obsolescence, or the mechanical failure of a device that prevents information access, which can be the result of damage through rough handling, gradual wear from extended usage, or intentional failure through planned obsolescence;
* Postponement obsolescence, or intentionally upgrading some information systems within an institution, but not all of them, that is often implemented as part of a &quot;security through obsolescence&quot; strategy;
* Systemic obsolescence, or deliberate design changes made to programs and applications so that newer updates are increasingly incompatible with older versions, forcing the user to purchase newer software editions or hardware;
* Technical obsolescence, or the adoption of newer, more accessible technologies with the intention to replace older, often outdated software or hardware, occurring on the side of the consumer or manufacturer.

== Examples of digital obsolescence ==
Because the majority of digital information relies on two factors for curation and retrieval, it is important to separately classify how digital obsolescence impacts digital preservation through both hardware and software mediums.

=== Hardware ===
Hardware concerns are two-fold in archival and library fields: in addition to the physical storage medium of magnetic tape, optical disc, or solid-state computer memory, a separate electronic device is often required for information access. And while proper storage can help mitigate some environmental vulnerabilities to storage formats (including dust, humidity, radiation, and temperature) and extend preservation for decades, there are other inevitable endangering factors. Magnetic tape and floppy disks are vulnerable to both the deterioration of adhesive holding the magnetic data layer to its backing or the demagnetization of the data layer, commonly called &quot;bit rot&quot;; optical discs are specifically susceptible to physical damage to their readable surface, and to oxidation occurring between improperly sealed outer layers; a process referred to as &quot;disc rot&quot; or, inaccurately, &quot;laser rot&quot; (particularly in reference to LaserDiscs). Older forms of floating-gate MOSFET based read-only-memory storage such as (some) cartridges and (most) memory cards encounter their own form of bit rot when the charges representing individual bits of binary information dissipate beyond a certain level (called &quot;flipping&quot;) and the data is rendered unreadable.

The operability of a format’s appropriate playback or recording device possess their own vulnerabilities. Cassette decks and disk drives rely on the functionality of precision-manufactured moving parts that are susceptible to damages caused by repetitive physical stress and foreign materials like dust and grime. Routine maintenance, calibrations, and cleaning operations can help extend the lifetime of many devices, but broken or failing parts will need repair or replacement: sourcing parts becomes more difficult and expensive as the supply stock for older machines reaches scarcity, and user technical skills grow challenged as newer machines and storage formats use less electromechanical parts and more integrated circuits and other complex components.

Only a decade after the 1970s Viking program, NASA personnel discovered that much of the mission data stored on magnetic tapes, including over 3000 unprocessed images of the Martian surface transmitted by the two Viking probes, was inaccessible due to a multitude of factors. While in possession of indecipherable notes written by long-departed or deceased programmers, the computer hardware and source code needed to correctly run the decoding software had been replaced and disposed of by the agency. Information was eventually recovered after more than a year of reverse engineering how the raw data was encoded onto the tapes, which included consulting with the original engineers of the Viking landers’ cameras and imaging hardware. NASA experienced similar issues when attempting to recover and process images from 1960s lunar orbiter missions. Engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory acknowledged in 1990, following a one-year search that located a compatible data tape reader at a United States Air Force base, that a missing part might need to be rebuilt in-house if a replacement could not be sourced from computer salvage yards.

=== Software ===

Over the past several decades, there have been a number of various, once industry-standard file formats and application platforms for data, images, and text that have been repeatedly replaced and superseded by newer iterations of software formats and applications, often with increasingly greater degrees of incompatibility between each other and along their own product lines. Such incompatibilities now frequently extend to which version of the operating system is installed on the system (such as instances of Microsoft Works predating Version 4.5 being unable to run on the Windows 2000 operating system and beyond). One example of a developer cancelling an instance of planned obsolescence occurred in 2008, when Microsoft retracted intentions of an Office service package dropping support for a number of older file formats, due to the intensity of public outcry.

Systemic obsolescence in software can be exemplified by the history of the word processor WordStar. A popular option for WYSIWYG document editing on C/PM and MS-DOS operating systems during the 1980s, a delayed port to Windows 1.0 caused WordStar to lose significant market share to competitors WordPerfect and Microsoft Word by 1991. Further development of the Windows version stopped in 1994, and WordStar 7 for MS-DOS was last updated in 1999. Over time, any version of WordStar grew increasingly incompatible with modern versions of Windows beyond 3.1 to the frustration of long-devoted users, including authors William F. Buckley, Jr. and Anne Rice.

Digital obsolescence has a prominent effect on the preservation of video game history, since many older games and hardware were regarded by players as ephemeral products, due to the continuous process of computer hardware upgrading and home console generation cycles. Such cycles are often the result of both systemic and technical obsolescence. Some of the oldest computer games, like 1962&#x27;s &quot;Spacewar!&quot; for the PDP-1 commercial minicomputer, were developed for hardware platforms so outdated that they are virtually nonexistent today. Many older games of the 1960s and 1970s built for contemporary mainframe terminals and microcomputers can only be played today through software emulation. While video games and other software applications can be orphaned by their parent developers or publishing companies, the copyright issues surrounding software are a very complicated hurdle in the path of digital preservation.

One prime example of copyright issues with software were those encountered during preservation efforts for the BBC Domesday Project, a 1986 UK multimedia data collection survey that commemorated the 900th anniversary of the original Domesday Book. While the project&#x27;s specially customized LaserDisc reader resulted in its own hardware-based preservation problems, the combination of one million personal copyrights belonging to participating civilians, in addition to corporate claims on the specialized computer hardware, means that publicly accessible digital preservation efforts might be stalled until 2090.

== Prevention strategies ==
Organizations possessing digital archives should perform assessments of their records in order to identify file corruption and reduce the risks associated with file format obsolescence. Such assessments can be accomplished through internal file format action plans, which list digital file types in an archive&#x27;s holdings and assess the actions taken in order to ensure continued accessibility.

One emerging strategic avenue in combatting digital obsolescence is the adoption of open source software, due to source code availability, transparency, and potential adaptability in modern hardware environments. For example, the Apache Software Foundation&#x27;s OpenOffice application supports access for a number of legacy word processor formats, including Version 6 of Microsoft Word, and basic support for Version 4 of WordPerfect. This contrasts with criticism directed toward Microsoft&#x27;s own purported Open XML format from the open source community for non-disclosure agreements and translator demands.

Standard strategies for digital preservation utilized by information institutions are frequently interconnected or otherwise related in function or purpose. Bitstream copying (or data backup) is a foundational operation often employed before many other practices, and facilitates establishing the redundancy of multiple storage locations: refreshing is the transportation of unchanging data, frequently between identical or functionally similar storage formats, while migration converts the format or coding of digital information to enable moving it between different operating systems and hardware generations. Normalization reduces organizational complexity for archival institutions by reducing the number of similar filetypes through conversion, and encapsulation assembles digital information with its associated metadata to guarantee information accessibility. Digital archives employ canonicalization to ensure that key aspects of documents have survived the process of conversion, while a reliance on standards established by regional archival institutions maintains organization within the broader spectrum of the field. Technology preservation (also called computer museum) and digital archeology respectively involve institutions maintaining possession or access to legacy hardware and software platforms, and the salvaging methods employed to recover digital information from damaged or obsolete media and devices. Following recovery, some data, such as documentation, can be converted to analog backups in the form of physically accessible copies, while executable code can be launched through emulation platforms within modern hardware and software environments designed to simulate obsolete computer systems.

Writing in 1999, Jeff Rothenberg was critical of many contemporary preservation procedures and how they improperly addressed digital obsolescence as the most prominent problem in long-term digital information storage.  Rothenberg disapproved of the reliance on hard copies, arguing that printing digital documents stripped them of their inherent &quot;digital&quot; qualities, including machine readability and dynamic, user functionalities. Computer museums were also cited as an inadequate practice. There are practical limitations of a limited number of locations capable of maintaining obsolete hardware forever, realistically limiting the full access capabilities of legacy digital documents: additionally, most older data rarely exists in coding formats to take full advantage of their original hardware or software environments. Two digital preservation processes specifically criticized were the implementation of relational database (RDB) standards and an overreliance on migration. While designed for standardization, RDBs and the features of their management systems (RDBMS) often promoted unintentional tribalistic practices among regional institutions, introducing incompatibilities between RDBs: meanwhile, the ubiquity of file and program migration frequently risked failing to compensate for conversional paradigm shifts between increasingly newer software environments. Emulation, with the digital data supported by an encapsulation of metadata, documentation, and software and emulation environment specifications, was argued as the most ideal preservation practice in the face of digital obsolescence.

The UK National Archives published a second revision to their Information Assurance Maturity Model (IAMM) in 2009, overviewing digital obsolescence risk management for institutions and businesses.  After instructing senior information risk owners on the initial requirements that determined both potential risk of digital obsolescence and the mitigating actions to counter it, the guide dissects a multi-step process toward maintaining digital continuity of archival information. Such steps run the gamut from enforcing responsibility of information continuity and confirming the degree of content metadata, to ensuring critical information discovery through institutional usage and that system migration doesn’t affect information accessibility, to guaranteeing IT support and enforcing contingency plans for information survivability through organizational changes.

In 2014, the National Digital Stewardship Alliance recommended developing file format action plans, stating &quot;it is important to shift from more abstract considerations about file format obsolescence to develop actionable strategies for monitoring and mining information about the heterogeneous digital files the organizations are managing&quot;. Other important resources for assessment support are the Library of Congress&#x27; Sustainability of Digital Formats page, and the UK National Archives&#x27; PRONOM online file format registry.

CERN began its Digital Memory Project in 2016, aiming to preserve decades of the organization’s media output through standardized initiatives. CERN determined that their solution would require continuous access to metadata, the implementation of an Open Archival Information System (OAIS) archive as soon as possible to reduce costs, and the advance execution of any new system’s archiving plan. Using OAIS, CERN developed certification for trustworthy digital repositories (TDR), the ISO 16363 standard, and implemented E-Ternity as the prototype for its compliant digital archive model.

On 1 January 2021, Adobe ended support and blocked content from running in its Flash Player in response to the advancements in open standards for the Web. This action followed a July 2017 announcement despite affecting the user experience for millions of websites to varying degrees. Since January 2018, the Flashpoint Archive has been one of several Adobe Flash Player preservation projects, salvaging more than 160,000 animations and games.

<doc id="934685" wikidata="Q1889369" url="?curid=934685" title="Neutron reflector">
<text>A neutron reflector is any material that reflects neutrons. This refers to elastic scattering rather than to a specular reflection. The material may be graphite, beryllium, steel, tungsten carbide, gold, or other materials. A neutron reflector can make an otherwise subcritical mass of fissile material critical, or increase the amount of nuclear fission that a critical or supercritical mass will undergo. Such an effect was exhibited twice in accidents involving the Demon Core, a subcritical plutonium pit that went critical in two separate fatal incidents when the pit&#x27;s surface was momentarily surrounded by too much neutron reflective material.

==Nuclear reactors==
In a uranium graphite chain reacting pile, the critical size may be considerably reduced by surrounding the pile with a layer of graphite, since such an envelope reflects many neutrons back into the pile.

To obtain a 30-year life span, the SSTAR nuclear reactor design calls for a moveable neutron reflector to be placed over the column of fuel. The reflector&#x27;s slow downward travel over the column would cause the fuel to be burned from the top of the column to the bottom.

A reflector made of a light material like graphite or beryllium will also serve as a neutron moderator reducing neutron kinetic energy, while a heavy material like lead or lead-bismuth eutectic will have less effect on neutron velocity.

In power reactors, a neutron reflector reduces the non-uniformity of the power distribution in the peripheral fuel assemblies, reduces neutron leakage and reduces a coolant flow bypass of the core. By reducing neutron leakage, the reflector increases reactivity of the core and reduces the amount of fuel necessary to maintain the reactor critical for a long period. In light-water reactors, the neutron reflector is installed for following purposes:
* The neutron flux distribution is &quot;flattened&quot;, i.e., the ratio of the average flux to the maximum flux is increased. Therefore, reflectors reduce the non-uniformity of the power distribution.
* By increasing the neutron flux at the edge of the core, there is much better utilization in the peripheral fuel assemblies. This fuel, in the outer regions of the core, now contributes much more to the total power production.
* The neutron reflector scatters back (or reflects) into the core many neutrons that would otherwise escape. The neutrons reflected back into the core are available for chain reaction. This means that the minimum critical size of the reactor is reduced. Alternatively, if the core size is maintained, the reflector makes additional reactivity available for higher fuel burnup. The decrease in the critical size of core required is known as the reflector savings.
* Neutron reflectors reduce neutron leakage, i.e., to reduce the neutron fluence on a reactor pressure vessel.
* Neutron reflectors reduce a coolant flow bypass of a core.
* Neutron reflectors serve as a thermal and radiation shield of a reactor core.

<text>Susan Hockfield (born March 24, 1951) is an American neuroscientist who served as the 16th president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 2004 to 2012. 

Hockfield currently serves as a Professor of Neuroscience in MIT&#x27;s Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, a Joint Professor of Work and Organization Studies in MIT’s Sloan School of Management, and a member of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. She is also a director of Break Through Cancer, Cajal Neuroscience, Fidelity Non-Profit Management Foundation, Lasker Foundation, Mass General Brigham, Pfizer, Repertoire Immune Medicines, and the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research; a lifetime member of the MIT Corporation; and a board member of the Belfer Center at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. Before returning to MIT following her presidency, Hockfield held the Marie Curie Visiting Professorship at Harvard University&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government.

==Early life and education==
Hockfield graduated from Horace Greeley High School in Chappaqua, New York, in 1969. She received her bachelor&#x27;s degree in Biology from the University of Rochester in 1973 and her Ph.D. in Anatomy and Neuroscience from the Georgetown University School of Medicine in 1979. Her doctoral dissertation centered on the pathways in the nervous system through which pain is perceived and processed. Her advisor during her doctoral work was Stephen Gobel.

==Career==
Following a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of California, San Francisco, Hockfield joined the staff of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in 1980. She was hired by James Watson, who together with Francis Crick had discovered the structure of DNA.

In 1985, Hockfield joined the faculty of Yale University. She received tenure in 1991 and became a full professor of neurobiology in 1994; soon thereafter she began to take on positions of administrative leadership. From 1998 to 2002, she served as Dean of Yale&#x27;s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, with oversight of 70 graduate programs. Over the course of her deanship, the number of applicants to the graduate school doubled. Support for graduate students also expanded in many dimensions, including healthcare, career counseling, fellowships, and opportunities to interact with faculty.

In December 2002, she was named Yale&#x27;s Provost — the university&#x27;s second-highest officer, with oversight of the university&#x27;s 12 schools. As Provost, she led major initiatives in science, medicine, and engineering, including a $500 million investment in scientific facilities.

During her time as dean and as provost, Hockfield was at the center of an imbroglio surrounding the Graduate Employees and Students Organization and its unionization efforts. While Yale opposed the student union, Hockfield made healthcare for Ph.D. students free and increased stipends for graduate students.

=== MIT presidency ===
In August 2004, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology named Hockfield its next president. MIT raised nearly $3 billion during Hockfield&#x27;s presidency, making it a more successful period of fundraising than any prior administration. However, the global financial crisis put great pressure on the Institute&#x27;s endowment, which was valued at $5.9 billion upon Hockfield&#x27;s arrival. It peaked at $9.9 billion in June 2008, then fell to $7.9 billion. By June 2011, it was valued at $9.7 billion. Through these financial ups and downs, Hockfield made affordability a priority: Annual undergraduate financial aid increased by about 75 percent during her presidency.

In her inaugural address, Hockfield called for MIT to cultivate the convergence of engineering and the life sciences to develop new approaches to address global challenges. She encouraged work that crossed disciplines, departments, and schools within MIT and that fostered collaborations among the Boston region&#x27;s academic medical centers and educational institutions. To that end, she led, among other efforts, the establishment of the David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research; the Ragon Institute (a collaboration between Massachusetts General Hospital, MIT, and Harvard University); and the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center in Holyoke, Massachusetts, an unprecedented collaboration of 5 universities, 2 private companies, and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to provide state-of-the art computation tools for research in a wide variety of fields.

Hockfield also announced her intention to develop a multidisciplinary, Institute-wide center focused on energy. That effort spawned the MIT Energy Initiative, which raised more than $350 million during Hockfield&#x27;s tenure and accelerated research on technologies and policies for a sustainable energy future. In 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama gave an address on U.S. energy policy at MIT, and Hockfield gave him the first tour of an MIT laboratory by a sitting U.S. president.

Hockfield also encouraged concerted faculty research in an area she considered vital to American national interests: manufacturing. She launched “Production in the Innovation Economy,” a campus-wide project to provide a blueprint for 21st century manufacturing in America. During her presidency, she served as the inaugural co-chair of the White House-led Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP), a task force of government, industry, and academic leaders. In an August 2011 &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed, Hockfield wrote, “To make our economy grow, sell more goods to the world and replenish the work force, we need to restore manufacturing — not the assembly-line jobs of the past, but the high-tech advanced manufacturing of the future.”

During Hockfield&#x27;s presidency, representation of underrepresented minorities and women increased across the undergraduate, graduate, and faculty populations. The graduating Class of 2015 was composed of 45 percent women and 24 percent underrepresented minorities. To address the growing interest in attending MIT (applications more than doubled during her tenure), Hockfield initiated an expansion of the undergraduate population. She also guided enhancements to student life and learning, including the construction of a new residence for graduate students and a restoration of MIT&#x27;s oldest building into an undergraduate residence with expanded space and amenities to foster student collaboration.

In addition, while Hockfield was president, the east side of MIT&#x27;s campus was enhanced by an extension to the Media Lab complex and a new building for the MIT Sloan School of Management. Hockfield also led a comprehensive strategic planning process for campus development and worked to foster the innovation cluster around Kendall Square, which at the end of her presidency was home to more biotech and life sciences companies per square mile than anywhere in the world.

In December 2011, MIT launched MITx, a not-for-profit online learning platform that offers online versions of MIT courses free of charge. In May 2012, Hockfield and Harvard president Drew Gilpin Faust announced edX, an MIT-Harvard partnership in online education. EdX, Hockfield said, “represents a unique opportunity to improve education on our own campuses through online learning, while simultaneously creating a bold new educational path for millions of learners worldwide.”

=== Scientific research ===
Hockfield pioneered the use of monoclonal antibody technology in brain research and discovered a gene that plays a critical role in the spread of cancer in the brain. Hockfield&#x27;s early work involved the application of monoclonal antibody technology to questions within neurobiology. She and her colleagues identified a family of cell surface proteins whose expression is regulated by neuronal activity early in an animal&#x27;s life and which reflect the effect of early experience on brain structure and function. A link between her research and human health was made when it was suggested that one of these proteins played a role in the progression of brain tumors. Hockfield&#x27;s work on a type of brain tumor called glioma identified molecules that allow glioma cells to move through normal brain tissue, the feature that makes glioma particularly deadly.

<doc id="934707" wikidata="Q5377975" url="?curid=934707" title="England First Party">
<text>The England First Party (EFP) was an English nationalist and far-right political party. It had two councillors on Blackburn with Darwen council between 2006 and 2007.

==Formation and policies==
They were formed in 2004 by Mark Cotterill who had been the founder and chairman of American Friends of the British National Party (BNP). However, he began to disagree with the BNP politically, and so formed the EFP, after a spell in the White Nationalist Party.

The EFP differed from the BNP in its analysis of the United Kingdom. It criticised British nationalism and supported English nationalism instead. Most members of the EFP were former BNP members like their chairman, Cotterill.

The EFP campaigned against the creation of regional assemblies across England. They also campaigned on issues such as opposing immigration in England and opposing the UK&#x27;s continued membership of the European Union.

On the economy, the EFP supported the gradual nationalisation of most national and public services in attempts to achieve autarky. While not aiming to abolish capitalist ownership, the EFP claimed the interests of workers to be paramount and subsequently supported worker co-operatives. The EFP also aimed to end the connections between trade unions and the Labour Party while encouraging trade union membership and re-nationalising and re-opening coal mines which had a &quot;reasonable working life&quot;.

According to the accounts filed with the Electoral Commission the party had 27 full members at year-end 2004 and 85 &quot;supporters&quot;. By the end of 2005 this had increased to 39 paid members and 97 registered supporters. For the year end 2007 the party recognised &quot;100 supporters&quot;. By year end 2010, England First had 42 full members and recognised 111 supporters.

It sold a magazine &quot;Heritage and Destiny&quot;, which ran issues every year from July 1999. It provided news on the progress of racial nationalism in Britain, Europe and America.

=== Policies on religion ===
The EFP was criticised for a section of its manifesto that promised &quot;the abolition of all non-European faiths and religions&quot;. On 4 June 2010 Mark Cotterill issued a statement that &quot;[f]ar from wishing to &quot;abolish&quot; any religion (from the East or West!), the EFP is committed to traditional English values of religious freedom.&quot; A later version of the party manifesto, last edited 28 April 2010, did not contain the call for abolition of non-European religions.

==Elections==
In their first electoral test, a local government by-election in February 2004 for the Heysham South ward in Lancaster, the EFP polled 14%. In the May 2004 local elections, the EFP contested three seats in Blackburn, Preston and Macclesfield, polling an average of 18% of the vote.

Two candidates contested the May 2006 local elections in Blackburn, polling an average of 37% of the vote and both were elected as councillors. In a by-election in the East Rural ward of Blackburn in September 2006, they polled 13%. They also contested a by-election in the Danehouse and Stoneyholme ward in Burnley in February 2007, polling 7%. Despite the party campaigning for a ban on mixed-race marriages it was revealed that one of the two elected councillors was reported to have a great-grandmother from the West Indies and a grandfather from Wales. Steven Smith and Simon Bennett stood in the Cliviger with Worsthorne and Queensgate wards respectively, at the 2007 Burnley council elections. Smith came a very distant second with Bennett third in a closer vote.

=== 2010 elections ===
The EFP fielded seven candidates for the 2010 local elections three of them to compete against the BNP in Stoke, but it did not stand in the general election and they had encouraged EFP supporters to vote for the National Front.

It came fourth place with 606 votes in the Longton North ward, fifth place with 117 votes in the Weston and Meir ward and sixth place in the Fenton ward with 236 votes in the Stoke-on-Trent local elections.

In the Preston Ribbleton ward, Mark Cotterill came fourth place with 315 votes; it came fourth place in the St James ward in Oldham with 425 votes, in the Bradley ward of Pendle it received 279 coming fourth place and sixth place in the Ince ward of Wigan with 134 votes.

==Resignations==
In March 2007 the EFP&#x27;s two councillors announced their intentions to quit. Michael Johnson stated that he would be joining a new party created by himself and Tony Melia For Darwen, while Mark Cotterill signalled his intention to stand down as a councillor and party leader at the 3 May local elections. Johnson&#x27;s move followed a rift with the party after he objected to an anti-Islamic cartoon of Jesus on YouTube, while Cotterill—who remained a leading EFP activist—has put his decision down to a work-related move to Preston.

==Defection to England First Party==
On 1 May 2009, a former British National Party councillor, John Gamble, confirmed that he had defected to the EFP, after criticising the BNP. In the preceding months, he had become increasingly disillusioned with the BNP&#x27;s national and local leadership, this resulted in him being expelled from the BNP. He sat as an independent for a few days and then he decided to &quot;join a party that offers a serious, radical challenge to the corrupt political establishment&quot;.

On 12 March 2010, John Gamble defected from the EFP to the National Front. This was after he told &quot;The Star&quot; newspaper in Sheffield he had &quot;jumped ship&quot; to the NF because he wanted to join a &quot;more active&quot; organisation than England First.

On 1 April 2010, Gamble defected back to England First because he stated to &quot;The Star&quot;, &quot;I am not aware of the severity of these opinions&quot; when some of the NF&#x27;s recorded views were put to him. On 5 April 2010 England First refused to take him back. England First&#x27;s chairman, Mark Cotterill, said: &quot;While we have nothing against Cllr. Gamble, the fact is that despite his various and contradictory public statements he has had no involvement with the EFP – and is no longer an EFP member.&quot; Mr Cotterill went on to release a statement to &quot;The Sheffield Star&quot; saying, &quot;We don&#x27;t want anything to do with Councillor Gamble. He has done nothing for the party, and when he left we washed our hands of him.&quot;

==Support to the English Democrats==
In May 2009, the England First Party decided to stand a candidate in the County council elections in Lancashire but did not stand any European candidates. For the European Parliament, the England First Party worked with the English Democrats and attended and spoke at the English Democrats&#x27; conference in Darwen. Cotterill stated that the parties had differences on race, immigration and independence but they had in common withdrawal from EU and putting England first.

The party was de-registered on 14 June 2012, and as such the name &quot;England First Party&quot; cannot be used on ballot papers by candidates at elections.

<text>Powe v. Miles, 407 F.2d 73 (2d Cir. 1968), reversed a lower court decision, United States District Court for the Western District of New York, F.R.Civ. P. 65(a) (2), on an appeal of the court&#x27;s decision that the District Court did not have jurisdiction on the case as Alfred University (Miles was President of the university), the defendant, was a private institution.

The court ruled that though Alfred University was a private institution, the College of Ceramics within the university was a public institution due to its state funding and governorship hence the court did have jurisdiction to hear the case of those plaintiffs who were students of the College of Ceramics. Those students from other parts of Alfred University were not within the court&#x27;s jurisdiction as Alfred University did not meet the court&#x27;s criteria for being a public institution.

==Facts==
During the annual Parents Day celebration at Alfred University on May 11, 1968, a group of students and faculty staged a demonstration during the part of the ceremony in which participated the ROTC unit. The purpose of the demonstration was to advocate scholarships for black students, add the teaching of Afro-American history to the curriculum, end compulsory ROTC at the university, and advocate an end to the Vietnam War which was then in progress. The demonstration was non-violent though the signs of the demonstrators did block the view of some people attending the ceremony. The demonstrators positioned themselves such that during the ROTC ceremony which included dignitaries presenting awards to members of the ROTC unit, the dignitaries must walk from the reviewing stand through the line of demonstrators to the ROTC recipients arrayed on the review field.

The Dean of Students requested the demonstrators to move citing the demonstration did not meet the university&#x27;s policy on demonstrations as the demonstration was obstructing the ceremony and prior notice of the demonstration had not been provided to university officials. Some of the demonstrators moved to the side of the field sitting down while still holding their signs. The remainder stayed firm in their positions. The Dean of Students then announced the remaining students were suspended and would be provided a hearing as to whether they should be expelled from the university the next day. The ROTC ceremony was conducted despite the demonstration and after the ceremony completed, the demonstrators left the field of their own accord.

The next day, the faculty-staff board reviewing the suspension adjourned without a decision until the students could be represented by counsel. After re-convening, the board recommended to President Miles of the university that the students &quot;be separated forthwith from the University.&quot; The President instead suspended the students for the remainder of the current semester and the next semester with leave to apply for readmission in the following year. The students were allowed to take final examinations off campus and receive credit for their coursework.

The students sued alleging violation of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C., asking the court to provide temporary and final injunctions compelling the university to reinstate them immediately without any penalties, a judgment declaring the university&#x27;s Policy on Demonstrations to be void, and damages. The students were from two different parts of the university, some were liberal arts students and some were students of the College of Ceramics.

==Issue==
Did the court have jurisdiction to hear the case and if so, were the students&#x27; civil rights, specifically the right to freedom of expression, violated?

==Answer==
The court did have jurisdiction to hear the case for the students of the College of Ceramics, a state funded part of the university, but not for the liberal arts students as the university as a whole had insufficient state sponsorship or governance. The court then decided the students&#x27; civil rights were not violated.

The court determined the students&#x27; civil rights were not violated as (1) they had not adhered to the university demonstration policy by giving prior notice yet prior planning was obvious and such notice could have been given (2) the students who moved, though still demonstrating, were not punished by the university as they were no longer obstructing the ceremony.

==Reasoning of the Court==
The court specified three reasons why it had jurisdiction to hear the case: (1) the College of Ceramics was almost totally state funded by the State of New York, (2) the state owned the land and building of the College of Ceramics, and (3) the state was involved in the governance of the College of Ceramics. None of these applied to Alfred University as a whole.

<doc id="934711" wikidata="Q1393230" url="?curid=934711" title="Hotelling's T-squared distribution">
<text>In statistics, particularly in hypothesis testing, the Hotelling&#x27;s &quot;T&quot;-squared distribution (&quot;T&quot;2), proposed by Harold Hotelling, is a multivariate probability distribution that is tightly related to the &quot;F&quot;-distribution and is most notable for arising as the distribution of a set of sample statistics that are natural generalizations of the statistics underlying the Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-distribution.
The Hotelling&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-squared statistic (&quot;t&quot;2) is a generalization of Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-statistic that is used in multivariate hypothesis testing.

==Motivation==
The distribution arises in multivariate statistics in undertaking tests of the differences between the (multivariate) means of different populations, where tests for univariate problems would make use of a &quot;t&quot;-test.
The distribution is named for Harold Hotelling, who developed it as a generalization of Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-distribution.

==Definition==
If the vector formula_1 is Gaussian multivariate-distributed with zero mean and unit covariance matrix formula_2 and formula_3 is a formula_4 random matrix with a Wishart distribution formula_5 with unit scale matrix and &quot;m&quot; degrees of freedom, and &quot;d&quot; and &quot;M&quot; are independent of each other, then the quadratic form formula_6 has a Hotelling distribution (with parameters formula_7 and formula_8):
:formula_9

It can be shown that if a random variable &quot;X&quot; has Hotelling&#x27;s &quot;T&quot;-squared distribution, formula_10, then:
:formula_11
where formula_12 is the &quot;F&quot;-distribution with parameters &quot;p&quot; and &quot;m&quot; − &quot;p&quot; + 1.

==Hotelling &quot;t&quot;-squared statistic==

Let formula_13 be the sample covariance:

: formula_14

where we denote transpose by an apostrophe. It can be shown that formula_13 is a positive (semi) definite matrix and formula_16 follows a &quot;p&quot;-variate Wishart distribution with &quot;n&quot; − 1 degrees of freedom. 
The sample covariance matrix of the mean reads formula_17.

The Hotelling&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-squared statistic is then defined as:

: formula_18

which is proportional to the Mahalanobis distance between the sample mean and formula_19. Because of this, one should expect the statistic to assume low values if formula_20, and high values if they are different.

From the distribution,

:formula_21

where formula_22 is the &quot;F&quot;-distribution with parameters &quot;p&quot; and &quot;n&quot; − &quot;p&quot;. 

In order to calculate a &quot;p&quot;-value (unrelated to &quot;p&quot; variable here), note that the distribution of formula_23 equivalently implies that 

:formula_24

Then, use the quantity on the left hand side to evaluate the &quot;p&quot;-value corresponding to the sample, which comes from the &quot;F&quot;-distribution. A confidence region may also be determined using similar logic.

=== Motivation === 
Let formula_25 denote a &quot;p&quot;-variate normal distribution with location formula_19 and known covariance formula_27. Let

:formula_28

be &quot;n&quot; independent identically distributed (iid) random variables, which may be represented as formula_29 column vectors of real numbers. Define

:formula_30

to be the sample mean with covariance formula_31. It can be shown that

:formula_32

where formula_33 is the chi-squared distribution with &quot;p&quot; degrees of freedom.

Alternatively, one can argue using density functions and characteristic functions, as follows.
 \cdot \cancel{n} \cdot \boldsymbol\Sigma^{-1} \right|^{1/2} \\
&amp; = \left| \left[ (\cancel{\boldsymbol\Sigma^{-1}} -2i \theta \cancel{\boldsymbol\Sigma^{-1}} ) \cancel{\boldsymbol\Sigma} \right]^{-1} \right|^{1/2} \\
&amp; = |\mathbf I_p-2 i \theta \mathbf I_p|^{-1/2}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where formula_34 is an identity matrix of dimension formula_7. Finally, calculating the determinant, we obtain:
:formula_36
which is the characteristic function for a chi-square distribution with formula_7 degrees of freedom. formula_38


==Two-sample statistic==

If formula_39 and formula_40, with the samples independently drawn from two independent multivariate normal distributions with the same mean and covariance, and we define

:formula_41

as the sample means, and

:formula_42
:formula_43

as the respective sample covariance matrices. Then

:formula_44

is the unbiased pooled covariance matrix estimate (an extension of pooled variance).

Finally, the Hotelling&#x27;s two-sample &quot;t&quot;-squared statistic is

:formula_45

===Related concepts===
It can be related to the F-distribution by

:formula_46

The non-null distribution of this statistic is the noncentral F-distribution (the ratio of a non-central Chi-squared random variable and an independent central Chi-squared random variable) 
:formula_47
with 
:formula_48
where formula_49 is the difference vector between the population means.

In the two-variable case, the formula simplifies nicely allowing appreciation of how the correlation, formula_50, 
between the variables affects formula_23. If we define
:formula_52
and 
:formula_53
then
:formula_54
Thus, if the differences in the two rows of the vector formula_55 are of the same sign, in general, formula_23 becomes smaller as formula_50 becomes more positive. If the differences are of opposite sign formula_23 becomes larger as formula_50 becomes more positive.

A univariate special case can be found in Welch&#x27;s t-test.

More robust and powerful tests than Hotelling&#x27;s two-sample test have been proposed in the literature, see for example the interpoint distance based tests which can be applied also when the number of variables is comparable with, or even larger than, the number of subjects.

<text>Mark Adrian Cotterill (born 3 October 1960) is a far right political figure who has been involved in a number of movements throughout his career. He is noted for activity to establish links between the far right in Britain and America, by founding the American Friends of the British National Party.

==National Front and Patriotic Forum years==
Cotterill was a member of the National Front (NF) from 1977 to 1979 and again from 1984 to 1992, and was the party&#x27;s South West England organiser from 1985 to 1991. He &quot;helped promulgate the New Atlantic Charter, signed between the National Front and the Nationalist Movement, pledging Anglo-American solidarity&quot; and was &quot;instrumental in arranging the exchange visit of (Nick) Griffin to America&quot;.

In 1992 Cotterill left the NF and formed the Patriotic Forum. The Patriotic Forum was largely composed of fellow ex-NF members, such as Darren Copeland (as Chairman), Keith Jowsey (as secretary), and Alan Harvey. The Patriotic Forum published a right-wing conservative magazine entitled &quot;British Patriot&quot; which Cotterill edited, and which also featured articles by Steve Brady and Alan Harvey.

Alan Harvey had formed the short-lived White Rhino Club, which supported apartheid in South Africa; Harvey later accused Cotterill of sabotaging the Club&#x27;s activities, but without substantiating the claim. In turn Cotterill claimed to have expelled Harvey from the Patriotic Forum, although the organisation had no formal membership. Cotterill was, for a short time, a member of the Conservative Party in Torquay in 1993, and was active in the Revolutionary Conservative Caucus. In 1994, he was attacked, receiving severe head injuries, by two members of Anti-Fascist Action who were subsequently &quot;charged with unlawful wounding&quot;. He stood as an Independent Conservative in the local elections in 1995.

Cotterill wound up the Patriotic Forum and ceased publication of &quot;British Patriot&quot; in 1995.

==British National Party years==
Cotterill then moved to the British National Party (BNP). In 1998, when he lived just outside Washington, D.C., he formed and ran the American Friends of the British National Party (AFBNP), which raised funds for the BNP.

While living in the United States he campaigned for David Duke in his bid to be elected to the United States Congress in 1999, and worked for Pat Buchanan&#x27;s bid to be elected President of the United States in the 2000 U.S. presidential election. However, &quot;Buchanan&#x27;s campaign threw out Cotterill and other racist volunteers after their presence was exposed by the Center for New Community and other groups&quot;. This involved Buchanan losing three-quarters of his Northern Virginia campaign staff.

Cotterill became an associate of William Pierce, editing one issue of his &quot;Resistance&quot; magazine in 1999; he was also the U.S. distributor for &quot;Right Now!&quot; magazine. Cotterill was by now defined by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a &quot;key British neofascist&quot;. In 2002, Cotterill was excluded from the U.S. for ten years.

==England First Party years==
Back in England, Cotterill broke with the BNP and in 2004 founded the England First Party (EFP). He publishes and edits an ethnic nationalist bimonthly magazine called &quot;Heritage and Destiny&quot;.

He was elected councillor for Meadowhead on Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council in the 2006 local elections as leader of the England First Party, defeating the incumbent Labour councillor by more than 400 votes. However, Cotterill resigned the seat in May 2007 and also stood down from the party leadership.

In the Preston local council elections in 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2012, Cotterill stood as the EFP candidate. In 2009 he was a candidate for the Preston East division of Lancashire County Council.

==Media coverage==
On 7 May 2019, Cotterill was interviewed for an article about the UK far right published in the &quot;Financial Times&quot;.

On 21 September 2023, the &quot;Lancashire Evening Post&quot; detailed how Cotterill hired a conference room claiming it was for a meeting of military veterans (securing a discount) whereas in reality it was for his far right group Heritage and Destiny.

<text>The metamonads are a large group of flagellate amitochondriate microscopic eukaryotes. They include the retortamonads, diplomonads, parabasalids, oxymonads, and a range of more poorly studied taxa, most of which are free-living flagellates. All metamonads are anaerobic (many being aerotolerant anaerobes), and most members of the four groups listed above are symbiotes or parasites of animals, as is the case with &quot;Giardia lamblia&quot; which causes diarrhea in mammals.

==Characteristics==
A number of parabasalids and oxymonads are found in termite guts, and play an important role in breaking down the cellulose found in wood. Some other metamonads are parasites.

These flagellates are unusual in lacking aerobic mitochondria. Originally they were considered among the most primitive eukaryotes, diverging from the others before mitochondria appeared. However, they are now known to have lost aerobic mitochondria secondarily, and retain both organelles and nuclear genes derived ultimately from the mitochondrial endosymbiont genome. Mitochondrial relics include hydrogenosomes, which produce hydrogen (and make ATP), and small structures called mitosomes.

It now appears the Metamonada are, together with &quot;Malawimonas&quot;, sister clades of the Podiata.

All of these groups have flagella or basal bodies in characteristic groups of four (or more, in parabasalids), which are often associated with the nucleus, forming a structure called a karyomastigont. In addition, genera such as &quot;Carpediemonas&quot; and &quot;Trimastix&quot; are now known to be close relatives of the retortamonad-diplomonad lineage and the oxymonads, respectively. Most of the closer relatives of the retortamonad-diplomonad lineage actually have two flagella and basal bodies.

== Classification ==

The metamonads were thought to make up part of the Excavata, a proposed eukaryotic supergroup including flagellates with feeding grooves and their close relatives. Their relationships are uncertain, and they do not always appear together on molecular trees. Current opinion is that Excavata is not a monophyletic group, but it might be paraphyletic.

The following higher level treatment from 2013 is based on works of Cavalier-Smith with amendments within Fornicata from Yubuki, Simpson &amp; Leander.

Metamonada were once again proposed to be basal eukaryotes in 2018.

== Evolution ==

Within Metamonada, two main branches are recovered in recent phylogenetic analyses. One branch contains the Parabasalia and the closely related anaeramoebae. The other branch contains two large groups: the Fornicata, which is closely related to barthelonids and the recently isolated &quot;Skoliomonas&quot;; and the Preaxostyla.

<text>Alan Ramsay Hawley (July 29, 1864 – February 16, 1938) was one of the early aviators in the United States. In 1910, he won the national race with his balloon &quot;America II&quot; alongside his aide and life-long friend Augustus Post. Hawley was the first passenger to fly in an airplane from New York City to Washington, D.C., in May 1916. He was the president of the Aero Club of America from 1913 to 1918.

== Biography ==
He was born on 29 July 1869 in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, to Peter William Radcliffe Hawley (1829–1884) and Isabella Meritt (1838–1904). He attended the Trinity School in New York City before becoming a stockbroker with his brother, William Hawley, until he retired in 1912.

On January 1, 1907, he ascended with Major James C. McCoy in a balloon &quot;Orient&quot; in St. Louis, Missouri.

On April 22, 1907, he ascended over in his balloon with Arthur T. Atherolt.

He entered the 1910 Gordon Bennett International Balloon Race with Augustus Post and they left the grounds of the Aero Club of St. Louis at 5:45 p.m. on Monday, October 17, 1910, in their balloon &quot;America II&quot;. The balloon had been specially constructed in France for this race and was owned by Major James C. McCoy. During the flight they took watches of three hours each, &quot;one sleeping and one watching the statiscopes, aneroid, and other instruments&quot; (sic). A recording barograph (altimeter) kept a precise log of their altitude during the flight. They reached altitudes of above the altitude of St. Louis, their 0 altitude reference point. St. Louis is at above sea level. 46 hours later, at 3:45 p.m. on Wednesday, 19 October they landed in the middle of the wilderness in Quebec, Canada, about north of Chicoutimi. They had been forced to land because of a storm. They were on a hillside at some altitude and had traveled from St. Louis. They had traveled at an average of 50 kilometres per hour (30 miles per hour). The next day they traveled south towards the last inhabited area they had passed over. Hawley was slowed by an ankle twisted just after landing. For the next three days they walked, sleeping under their blankets at night and eating a bare minimum of food. They eventually came upon a trapper&#x27;s hut, at the edge of Lake St. John, which was not occupied at that moment. They rested there for a day, after which two French Canadian men out on a hunting trip arrived and agreed to help them. The trappers took them to Saint-Ambroise-de-Kildare, Quebec. Once there, they sent telegrams to family and the Aero Club to let them know they were alright. The message Hawley sent to his brother read: &quot;Landed in wilderness week ago, fifty miles north of Chicoutimi. Both well —Alan.&quot; Their telegrams ended searches which had various parties had started, looking for them around the Great Lakes. Clifford B. Harman, a wealthy amateur aeronaut and aviator, had offered $1,000 to anyone who found Hawley and Post, dead or alive. On the evening before their telegrams were sent, Harmon had increased the reward to $7,000.

He died of coronary thrombosis on February 16, 1938, at age 73 at his home, 400 Park Avenue.

<doc id="934744" wikidata="Q692077" url="?curid=934744" title="Nevus">
<text>Nevus (: nevi) is a nonspecific medical term for a visible, circumscribed, chronic lesion of the skin or mucosa. The term originates from &quot;nævus&quot;, which is Latin for &quot;birthmark&quot;; however, a nevus can be either congenital (present at birth) or acquired. Common terms, including mole, birthmark, and beauty mark, are used to describe nevi, but these terms do not distinguish specific types of nevi from one another.
==Classification==
The term &quot;nevus&quot; is applied to a number of conditions caused by neoplasias and hyperplasias of melanocytes, as well as a number of pigmentation disorders, both hypermelanotic (containing increased melanin, the pigment responsible for skin color) and hypomelanotic (containing decreased melanin). Suspicious skin moles which are multi-colored or pink may be a finding in skin cancer.

===Increased melanin===

==== Usually acquired ====
* Melanocytic nevus
** Melanocytic nevi can be categorized based on the location of melanocytic cells
*** Junctional: epidermis 
*** Intradermal: dermis 
*** Compound: epidermis and dermis 
* Atypical (dysplastic) nevus: This type of nevus must be diagnosed based on histological features. Clinically, atypical nevi are characterized by variable pigmentation and irregular borders.
* Becker&#x27;s nevus
* Blue nevus (rarely congenital): A classic blue nevus is usually smaller than 1 cm, flat, and blue-black in color.
* Hori&#x27;s nevus
* Nevus spilus (speckled lentiginous nevus): This lesion includes dark speckles within a tan-brown background.
* Pigmented spindle cell nevus
* Spitz nevus
* Zosteriform lentiginous nevus

==== Usually congenital ====
* Congenital melanocytic nevus
** These nevi are often categorized based on size, however, the lesions usually grow in proportion to the body over time, so the category may change over an individual&#x27;s life. This categorization is important because large congenital melanocytic nevi are associated with an increased risk of melanoma, a serious type of skin cancer.
*** Small: &lt;1.5 cm
*** Medium: 1.5–19.9 cm
*** Large: ≥ 20 cm
* Nevus of Ito
* Nevus of Ota

===Decreased melanin===

==== Acquired ====
* Nevus anemicus

==== Congenital ====
* Nevus depigmentosus

Additional types of nevi do not involve disorders of pigmentation or melanocytes. These additional nevi represent hamartomatous proliferations of the epithelium, connective tissue, and vascular malformations.

===Epidermal nevi===
These nevi represent excess growth of specific cells types found in the skin, including those that make up oil and sweat glands.
* Verrucous epidermal nevus
* Nevus sebaceous
* Nevus comedonicus
* Eccrine nevus
* Apocrine nevus

===Connective tissue nevi===
Connective tissue nevi represent abnormalities of collagen in the dermis, the deep layer of the skin.
* Collagenoma
* Elastoma

===Vascular nevi===
These nevi represent excess growth of blood vessels, including capillaries.
* Nevus simplex (nevus flammeus nuchae), also known as a &quot;stork bite&quot; or &quot;salmon patch&quot;.
===Intramucosal nevi===
An &quot;intramucosal nevus&quot; is a nevus within the mucosa as found in for example the mouth and genital areas. In the mouth, they are found most frequently on the hard palate. They are typically light brown and dome-shaped. Intramucosal nevi account for 64% of all reported case of oral nevi.

== Diagnosis ==

Nevi are typically diagnosed clinically with the naked eye or using dermatoscopy. More advanced imaging tests are available for distinguishing melanocytic nevi from melanoma, including computerized dermoscopy and image analysis. The management of nevi depends on the type of nevus and the degree of diagnostic uncertainty. Some nevi are known to be benign, and may simply be monitored over time. Others may warrant more thorough examination and biopsy for histopathological examination (looking at a sample of skin under a microscope to detect unique cellular features). For example, a clinician may want to determine whether a pigmented nevus is a type of melanocytic nevus, dysplastic nevus, or melanoma as some of these skin lesions pose a risk for malignancy. The ABCDE criteria (asymmetry, border irregularity, color variegation, diameter &gt; 6 mm, and evolution) are often used to distinguish nevi from melanomas in adults, while modified criteria (amelanosis, bleeding or bumps, uniform color, small diameter or de novo, and evolution) can be used when evaluating suspicious lesions in children. In addition to histopathological examination, some lesions may also warrant additional tests to aid in diagnosis, including special stains, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. Typically, the nevi that exist since childhood are harmless.

=== Differential diagnoses ===
Hypermelanotic nevi must be differentiated from other types of pigmented skin lesions, including:
* Lentigo simplex
* Solar lentigo
* Café au lait macule
* Ink-spot lentigo
* Mucosal melanotic macule
* Mongolian spot (dermal melanocytosis)
== Management ==

The management of a nevus depends on the specific diagnosis, however, the options for treatment generally include the following modalities:

=== Observation ===

=== Destruction ===
* Chemical peels
* Cryotherapy
* Dermabrasion
* Electrodessication
* Laser ablation

=== Surgery ===
The decision to observe or treat a nevus may depend on a number of factors, including cosmetic concerns, irritative symptoms (e.g., pruritus), ulceration, infection, and concern for potential malignancy.

== Syndromes ==
The term nevus is included in the names of multiple dermatologic syndromes:
* Basal cell nevus syndrome
* Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome
* Dysplastic nevus syndrome
* Epidermal nevus syndrome
* Linear nevus sebaceous syndrome

<text>Minnesota State Highway 57 (MN 57) is a state highway in southeast Minnesota, which runs from its interchange with U.S. Highway 14 in the city of Kasson and continues north to its northern terminus at its intersection with U.S. Highway 52 in the unincorporated community of Hader in Wanamingo Township.

==Route description==
Highway 57 serves as a north–south route in southeast Minnesota between Kasson, Mantorville, Wanamingo, and Hader.

Highway 57 is a two-lane undivided highway its entire length, except for a small portion in the city of Kasson. The route begins in Kasson, and heads through the center of town. Two miles north of Kasson, the route enters historic Mantorville and goes by some landmarks, such as the Hubbell House. North of Mantorville, Highway 57 is very lightly traveled and doesn&#x27;t enter another incorporated city for twenty miles (32 km). The route intersects State Highway 60 at Wanamingo. Highway 57 then heads north four more miles to its northern terminus at its intersection with U.S. Highway 52 in Hader.

Highway 57 is also known as &quot;Mantorville Avenue&quot; in the city of Kasson. The route is also known as &quot;Main Street&quot; in the cities of Mantorville and Wanamingo.

==History==
Highway 57 was first commissioned as Minnesota Constitutional Route 57 in 1920. Constitutional Route 57 only extended from Highway 14 in Kasson to Mantorville. The remainder of the route north to Hader was authorized in 1934. Highway 57 was completely paved by 1958. The route was extended south of the original terminus in Kasson in 1980 to meet the U.S. 14 bypass.

Highway 57 was the shortest constitutional route in the 1920 Minnesota highway plan, then only three miles in length between Kasson and Mantorville.

<text>Sandkings is a collection of science fiction short stories by American writer George R. R. Martin, published by Timescape Books in December 1981. The collection won the Locus Award for best single author collection. The multiple-award-winning title story concerns a race of insectoid, militaristic alien &quot;pets&quot; who worship their master until he badly mistreats them.

==&quot;Sandkings&quot;==
In the original story (set in the same fictional &quot;Thousand Worlds&quot; universe as several of Martin&#x27;s other works, including &quot;Dying of the Light&quot;, &quot;Nightflyers&quot;, &quot;A Song for Lya&quot;, &quot;With Morning Comes Mistfall&quot;, &quot;The Way of Cross and Dragon&quot; and the stories collected in &quot;Tuf Voyaging&quot;), a millionaire named Simon Kress buys four colonies of sandkings—highly intelligent antlike creatures—as an addition to his collection of exotic pets. Problems occur when he forces the sandkings to make war on one another for his amusement, only to find they are a more sophisticated species than he had realised. 

The story was adapted into &quot;The Sandkings&quot;, an episode of the new &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, as well as a 1987 graphic novel, published by DC Comics as the seventh and last book of the DC Science Fiction Graphic Novel line, adapted by Doug Moench, Pat Broderick and Neal McPheeters.

<text>Victor Desguin (; 30 January 1838 – 8 July 1919) was a Belgian liberal politician.

He was a popular alderman of the city of Antwerp in charge of education and municipal schools at the end of the 19th century. He was twice acting mayor of Antwerp, but was never appointed mayor of the city.

Desguin was born on 30 January 1838. He became alderman of the city of Antwerp in 1892, responsible for education and schooling. He built libraries and schools.

He became acting mayor in 1906, when mayor Jan Van Rijswijck withdrew from office due to illness. Desguin was a member of the liberal party, and because of this, the Catholic government did not want him appointed as mayor. Instead Peter Hertogs became mayor.

When Peter Hertogs died in office in 1908, Desguin became acting mayor again, and for the second time somebody else became mayor instead of him. Jan De Vos was appointed mayor.

During the chaotic days of October 1914, Desguin organised the Antwerpsch Komiteit voor Hulp (Antwerp Relief Committee), a relief organisation for war victims.

Desguin never got the opportunity of becoming mayor; he died on 8 July 1919.

<doc id="934773" wikidata="Q1113775" url="?curid=934773" title="Toga party">
<text>A toga party is a Greco-Roman-themed costume party where attendees wear a garment inspired by ancient Roman clothing (normally made from a bed sheet) with sandals. The costumes, party games, and other entertainment often adhere to the Roman or Greek theme. Toga parties are associated with keg parties and excessive drinking, and attendees typically tend to be college or university students.

==History==
First lady Eleanor Roosevelt held a toga party in 1934 to spoof those that compared her husband President Franklin D. Roosevelt to &quot;Caesar&quot;.

The earliest known college toga parties took place in the United States in the early 1950s. Toga parties are recorded in the yearbooks for Theta Delta Chi (1952) and the University of Michigan&#x27;s Acacia fraternity (1953). Another early toga party took place in 1953, when Pomona College students wore togas and ivy wreaths, and brought their dorm mattresses to freshman Mark Neuman&#x27;s home on Hillcrest Avenue in nearby Flintridge.

For the eight decades before Greek-themed parties became known as &quot;toga parties&quot; in the 1950s, similar parties were generally called &quot;bed sheet and pillow slip&quot; parties (or simply, &quot;pillow slip&quot; parties), in which attendees wrapped themselves in sheets and pillow cases, were regularly held by fraternal orders (like the Masons, Odd Fellows and Elks), civic organizations, and church groups. In 1882, the Terpsichore Society of the Ohio State University held a &quot;pillow slip party&quot; which may arguably be considered the first known college toga party.

Although they are called &quot;toga parties&quot;, attendants rarely wear togas, which were intricately draped garments made from large semicircles of fabric, instead wearing articles that more closely resemble chitons.

The Guinness World Record for the largest toga party is 3,700 participants. The event, organized by the University of Queensland Union and the Queensland University of Technology Student Guild, was held on 24 February 2012 at Riverstage in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.

==In popular culture==

A toga party was depicted in the 1978 film &quot;Animal House&quot;, which propelled the ritual into a widespread and enduring practice. Chris Miller, who was one of the writers of &quot;Animal House&quot;, attended Dartmouth College where the toga party was a popular costume event at major fraternity parties (such as Winter Carnival and Green Key Weekend) during the late 1950s and early 1960s.

A toga party was also briefly described in Tom Wolfe&#x27;s 1968 story &quot;The Pump House Gang&quot;, although somewhat different from the version in the film. Toga parties are also seen in the first episode of season four of the television series &quot;Greek&quot; and in the fourth episode of &quot;Silicon Valley&quot;.

&quot;The World&#x27;s Largest Toga Party&quot; was the tagline of WrestleMania IX.

<doc id="934777" wikidata="Q1399328" url="?curid=934777" title="Tui na">
<text>Tui na (; ) is a form of alternative medicine similar to shiatsu. As a branch of traditional Chinese medicine, it is often used in conjunction with acupuncture, moxibustion, fire cupping, Chinese herbalism, tai chi or other Chinese internal martial arts, and qigong.

== Background ==
&quot;Tui na&quot; is a hands-on body treatment that uses Chinese Daoist principles in an effort to bring the eight principles of traditional Chinese medicine into balance. The practitioner may brush, knead, roll, press, and rub the areas between each of the joints, known as the eight gates, to attempt to open the body&#x27;s defensive &quot;qi&quot; (&quot;wei qi&quot;) and get the energy moving in the meridians and the muscles. Techniques may be gentle or quite firm. The name comes from two of the actions: &quot;tui&quot; means &quot;to push&quot; and &quot;na&quot; means &quot;to lift and squeeze.&quot; Other strokes include shaking and tapotement. The practitioner can then use a range of motion, traction, and the stimulation of acupressure points. These techniques are claimed to aid in the treatment of both acute and chronic musculoskeletal conditions, as well as many non-musculoskeletal conditions.

As with many other traditional Chinese medical practices, different schools vary in their approach to the discipline. In traditional Korean medicine it is known as &quot;chu na&quot; (), and it is related also to Japanese massage or &quot;anma&quot; and its derivatives &quot;shiatsu&quot; and &quot;sekkotsu. &quot;In the West, tui na is taught as a part of the curriculum at some acupuncture schools.

== Efficacy ==

A collaborative study between researchers in China and Germany concluded that the use of Tui na techniques can be a safe, low-cost method to reduce back and neck pain.

<text>Tadeáš Hájek z Hájku () (1 December 1525 in Prague – 1 September 1600 in Prague), also known as Tadeáš Hájek of Hájek, Thaddaeus Hagecius ab Hayek or Thaddeus Nemicus, was a Czech naturalist, personal physician of the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolph II and an astronomer in the Kingdom of Bohemia.

==Biography==
Tadeáš Hájek was the son of Šimon Hájek (ca. 1485–1551) from an old Prague family. He was ennobled in 1554 by Ferdinand I of Germany, knighted in 1571 by Maximilian II, later made knight of the Holy Roman Empire by Rudolf II. He had three wives, three sons, and one daughter.

In 1548–1549, he studied medicine and astronomy in Vienna and graduated in 1550, receiving his Masters &quot;in artibus&quot; in 1551. In 1554 he studied medicine in Bologna and went to Milan the same year to listen to lectures by Girolamo Cardano, but he soon returned to Prague, where he became a professor of mathematics at the Charles University of Prague in 1555.

He published the &quot;Aphorismi Metoposcopici&quot; in 1561, dealing with divination and diagnosis by interpreting lines on the forehead. He triangulated the area around Prague and in 1563 co-authored a map of it, which is lost. In 1564 he received the Emperor&#x27;s privilege stating that no astrological prognostication could be printed in Prague before he had seen and approved it. In 1566–1570, he served as an army doctor in Austria and Hungary during the war with the Ottoman Empire. Hepublished his studies of a supernova in the constellation Cassiopeia in 1572. Tadeáš Hájek was in frequent scientific correspondence with the recognized astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546–1601) and played an important role in persuading Rudolph II to invite Brahe (and later Kepler) to Prague.

His voluminous writings in Latin were mostly concerned with astronomy and many regarded him as the greatest astronomer of his time. Besides his work, Tadeáš Hájek eagerly collected manuscripts, especially those by Copernicus.

Throughout his life he also published numerous astrological prognostics in Czech and that is why he was until recently viewed as an &quot;occultist&quot; rather than a great scientist. He corresponded with John Dee as a result of their common interest in Euclid and geometry.

The lunar crater &quot;Hagecius&quot; and the asteroid &quot;1995 Hajek&quot; are named in his honour.

<text>Ceres is a village in Fife, Scotland, located in a small glen approximately over the Ceres Moor from Cupar and from St Andrews. The former parish of that name included the settlements of Baldinnie, Chance Inn, Craigrothie, Pitscottie and Tarvit Mill.

==Village==
Ceres is one of a few Scottish villages to have a village green. It is known as the &quot;Bow Butts&quot; since its use as an archery practice ground in medieval times. The Ceres Burn runs through the village and alongside the green. An old packhorse bridge, known as the &quot;Bishop&#x27;s Bridge&quot; has spanned the burn since the 17th century and still stands close to a more modern road bridge.
The village is dominated by the Parish Church. It has what is possibly the shortest High Street in Scotland - just a few houses on each side. In a prominent position by the Bow Butts is a monument commemorating the men of Ceres who fought in the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. It was erected on the six hundredth anniversary of the battle, in 1914.

The Italian balloonist Vincenzo Lunardi landed in the parish after his first flight in Scotland in 1785. Fetched from a field near Pitscottie, he was greeted in the village where his flag was carried in procession and the church bell rung in his honour.

While agriculture remains important to the local economy, many local residents now commute to work in nearby towns and cities such as Perth, Cupar, Dundee, St. Andrews and Glenrothes. A pottery in the village has revived the manufacture of traditional Fife Wemyss Ware.

===Folk Museum===
The Fife Folk Museum is located in the village in a range of buildings including the old weigh-house where grain was weighed at a tron on market days. The building also served as a tolbooth for locking up minor offenders and the village jougs are still attached. The museum commemorates rural life of a bygone era. The museum began in 1968 in the renovation and conversion of the former weigh-house and adjoining cottages through an initiative by Cupar &amp; North Fife Preservation Society. A fundraising campaign in 2003-4 enabled a £395,000 project to renovate the Museum.

==Origin of the name==
The village name signifies &quot;place to the west&quot; from the Scottish Gaelic &quot;Siar&quot; meaning &quot;west&quot;, probably in relation to St Andrews. Locational endings in &quot;-es&quot; are common in East Fife. Suggestions that the name originated from an early dedication of the local kirk, such as to &quot;Saint Siris&quot;, Saint Cyrus or Saint Cyricus are now discounted.

Ceres was the name of the Roman goddess of agriculture and grain. The name has led to contact with Ceres, Italy (visited by the local pipe band in the 1970s) and Ceres, Western Cape, South Africa (with which gifts were exchanged in the 1990s).

The parish of Ceres has some biblical place names: Babylon near Muirhead, south of Craigrothie, and Sodom and Gomorrah (locally pronounced &quot;Gemorrie&quot;) and Purgatory on the road to Pitscottie. There are now no dwellings at these locations. On the other hand, there is a place called Paradise, which now habited, just over the boundary in Cults parish.

==Ceres Games==
The Ceres Games are said to have been held every year since 1314 after Robert the Bruce granted the village permission to hold them in commemoration of its men&#x27;s participation in the Battle of Bannockburn. Now staged in the form of Highland games, they are the oldest free games in Scotland.

==Craighall==
Craighall lies about south-east of the village; it was the historic seat of the Clan Hope.

==Parish church==

The current parish church was built in 1806 to a design by Alexander Leslie, replacing a medieval building. A tower and octagonal spire were added in the 1850s. Apart from the addition of electric lighting and two early 20th-century stained glass windows (either side of the central pulpit), the interior is substantially unaltered from when first built and retains the gallery and original wooden box pews. These can be converted into two long tables for communion, a feature which was once a common feature in churches in Scotland, but is now only found in Ceres. 

Within the vestibule of the church a late medieval effigy of a knight which was originally in the ancient church is preserved on a modern stand. It is extremely well preserved and shows interesting details of 15th-century armour.

There is a mausoleum in the cemetery which was established by the widow of Robert 9th Lord Lindsay and is called &quot;Lady Boyd&#x27;s House&quot; as she subsequently married the 6th Lord Boyd of Kilmarnock. However, the vault contains the grave of John Lindsay, 20th Earl of Crawford (1702–1749).

Ceres Church is within the Church of Scotland Presbytery of Fife. In 1983, the parish of Ceres was linked (and later united) with the neighbouring parish of Springfield. This united parish was further united with Kemback in 2005. There is usually a service in Ceres every other Sunday (alternating with Springfield) at 10:30 am except on Remembrance Sunday (10:45am). 

The present Minister is the Rev Jane Barron.

Two serving past ministers of Ceres have been Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland: Thomas Buchanan (1588) and Robert Arnot (1794).

==The Provost==

Thomas Buchanan (related to the 17th-century theologian George Buchanan), who became the last church provost of Ceres in 1578, was at one time said to be the subject of &quot;The Provost&quot; sculpture, in the village centre. However, the sculpture is an amalgam of parts: the upper section is a Toby Jug and therefore cannot pre-date 1760; the word &quot;PROVOST&quot; has been added by a different hand and appears to be a joke aimed at a 19th century self-appointed leader of the local community. The overall frame is 16th or early 17th century and contains a worn but interesting hunting scene.

==City Commissioners==
The city government of Dayton, Ohio, is governed by a city commission comprising five commissioners, one of whom is the mayor. The commissioners serve staggered, four-year terms. Commissioners are elected two at a time in open, at-large, nonpartisan elections. The four top vote-getters in the primary election go on to compete in the general election, regardless of party membership. The top two vote-getters in the general election are elected. As of November 1969, the mayor is elected in a separate election. Although the elections are nominally nonpartisan, the Democratic and Republican parties nominate candidates.
