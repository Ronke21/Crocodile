<text>Marinka is an operetta by Hungarian composer Emmerich Kálmán with book by George Marion, Jr. and Karl Farkas, and lyrics by George Marion, Jr. The operetta is a retelling of the story of the Mayerling Incident, but with a happy ending replacing the infamous 1889 double suicide of Austrian Crown Prince Rudolf and his mistress, Maria Vetsera. The best-known songs include &quot;Only One Touch of Vienna,&quot; &quot;Sigh by Night,&quot; &quot;The Cab Song,&quot; and &quot;When I Auditioned for the Harem of the Shah&quot;.

== Productions ==
It was first produced on Broadway by Jules J. Leventhal and Harry Howard with financial backing from Lee Shubert and Warner Bros. It was staged by Hassard Short, choreographed by Albertina Rasch and used set designs by Howard Bay and costume designs by Mary Grant. The work premiered on July 18, 1945, at the Winter Garden Theatre. The production moved to the Ethel Barrymore Theatre on October 1, 1945, running until December 8, 1945, for a total of 165 performances. The opening night cast included Joan Roberts (Marinka), Harry Stockwell (Rudolph), Romo Vincent (Bratfisch), Michael Barrett (Sergeant Negulegul), Paul Campbell (Count Hoyos), Ronnie Cunningham (Tilly), Bob Douglas (Lieutenant Baltatzy), Leonard Elliott (Francis), Jack Gansert (Lieutenant Palafy), Noel Gordon (Naval Lieutenant), Adrienne Gray (Countess Huebner), Taylor Holmes (Count Lobkowitz), Jack Leslie (Waiter), Ethel Levey (Madame Sacher), Reinhold Schünzel (Emperor Franz Josef), Elline Walther (Countess von Diefendorfer), Ruth Webb (Nadine), and Luba Malina (Countess Landovska). Later in the show&#x27;s run radio personality Jerry Wayne replaced Stockwell as Rudolph and actress Edith Fellows replaced Roberts as Marinka.

The work received its Australian premiere in 1948 at the Tivoli Theatre in Melbourne.

The European premiere took place as late as 2016 at the Komische Oper Berlin in the form of a staged concert conducted by Koen Schoots and staged by Barrie Kosky. Insofar as the original orchestrations appear to have been lost, a completely new orchestration was conceived by Ferdinand von Seebach. The cast was cut back to the main four soloists: Marinka (Ruth Brauer-Kvam), Rudolph (Johannes Dunz), Bratfisch (Peter Bording) and Countess Landovska (Talya Lieberman), with Marinka and Bratfisch narrating the story.

== Synopsis ==

The plot, set in Vienna, Mayerling, and Budapest, with a prologue and epilogue in an open air movie theatre in Connecticut, was a retelling of the story of the Mayerling Incident.

In the prologue, youngsters at a movie palace watch a film about the Mayerling story and feel that it is too tragic. Their cab driver, the son of Rudolph&#x27;s coachman, has his own version of the story.

<text>A coast (or coastal) radio station (short: coast station) is an onshore maritime radio station which monitors radio distress frequencies and relays ship-to-ship and ship-to-land communications.

A coast station (also: &quot; coast radio station &quot;) is – according to &quot;article 1.75&quot; of the International Telecommunication Union&#x27;s (ITU) ITU Radio Regulations (RR) – defined as «&quot;A land station in the maritime mobile service&quot;.»

Coast Radio Station had an important role in the history of wireless radio communication as well as in maritime and war history.

Recent costal radio station provide medical advice services for ships, transmitting meteo messages and navigational warnings (NAV-Notice) on a regular base and all of them do a distress chanel watch (DSC-Watch) on VHF Chanel 16. Not all station monitore 2182 kHz shortwave anymore.

<text>West Drayton is a suburban town in the London Borough of Hillingdon. It was an ancient parish in the county of Middlesex and from 1929 was part of the Yiewsley and West Drayton Urban District, which became part of Greater London in 1965. The settlement is near the Colne Valley Regional Park and its centre lies north of Heathrow Airport.

Traditionally the Parish of West Drayton covers . In 1901 the population of the civil parish was 984. In the 2011 Census 14,370 people were living in the West Drayton electoral ward. The ward has three councillors in the Hillingdon Borough Council. The vast majority of the housing in West Drayton is mid-20th century.

==Toponymy==
In 939 the area was known as &quot;Draegtun&quot;. Tun/ton is cognate with the later form town, but originally implied any kind of farmstead of more than one family. Dray is cognate with draught (as in draft horse/a dray) implying a portage/slope used for dragging loads, or simply notable use of the dragged plough, quite possibly given about 13 other examples in England simply land under till. It is recorded as &quot;Draitone&quot; in the 1086 &quot;Domesday Book&quot;, and as &quot;Westdrayton&quot; in 1465. It is thought that the &quot;West&quot; may have been added to differentiate the village from Drayton near Ealing.

==Geography==

West Drayton lies to the south of the Great Western Main Line which run east–west, with Yiewsley lying to the north of the railway line. It lies on the north side of the M4 motorway with the village of Harmondsworth to the south, and is northwest of M4 junction 4 (Heathrow Airport spur). This intersects with the A408 (for Stockley Park and Uxbridge) which forms West Drayton&#x27;s eastern boundary with Hayes until the Heathrow Express railway line forms this boundary at Prologos Park Heathrow. In this area lay the former hamlet of Stockley, known until 1912 as Starveall or Starvhall. On the eastern side of West Drayton is the county boundary with Buckinghamshire.

West Drayton railway station in Yiewsley is served by the Elizabeth line and Great Western Railway (GWR). The Elizabeth line operates a stopping service between Abbey Wood and Reading and GWR operates a stopping service between London Paddington and Didcot Parkway.

West Drayton has five primary schools, West Drayton Academy, Laurel Lane Primary School, St Martin&#x27;s CE Primary School, St Catherine Catholic Primary School and Cherry Lane Primary School. The community is served by the Park Academy West London secondary school which is located on Park View Road in Yiewsley. 

West Drayton has at its heart in the west of the parish a conservation area, The Green, along which are many buildings protected under UK law by grade II and II* listing – residential and commercial.

==Demography==
As of the 2011 census, 57% of the population was White British. Living in the ward were 14,370 people according to the 2011 Census.

The decennial censuses between 1801 and 1901 each show a rise in population and a low population density. From 1801 when the population of the almost identically sized ecclesiastical parish (civil parishes were invented later in the 19th century) was 515; to 1901 when the population of the civil parish was 984.

==History==
===The St Paul&#x27;s Era===
The first record of West Drayton is from 939 when Æthelstan, King of the English, gave the Manor of West Drayton to the Dean and Chapter of Cathedral church of St Pauls, recorded in the Cartularium Saxonicum.
In the 1086 &quot;Domesday Book&quot;, West Drayton was assessed at ten hides with land suitable for six ploughs. The Parish had 17 landowners which indicated a population of less than 100. In 1461 a separate smaller manor, Drayton and Colham Garden Manor was first recorded, lying between Swan road and Colham Mill road. Both manors shared St Martin&#x27;s Parish Church. Until 1525 West Drayton Manor was managed on behalf of the Dean and Chapter of St Paul&#x27;s by an appointment known as a &quot;Firmarius&quot; who was responsible for the day-to-day running of the estate.

===The Paget Era===

From 1525 St Paul&#x27;s began leasing West Drayton Manor to tenants. From 1537 the lessee of the manor was William Paget who held high office of state in the court of Henry VIII. On 1 April 1546, the Dean and Chapter of St Paul&#x27;s released the Manor of West Drayton to the Crown and two weeks later Henry granted the manor to the now knighted Sir William Paget. In the same year Henry granted Paget six manors in his native Staffordshire. Henry died in January 1547. Paget was made a peer of the realm as Lord Paget of Beaudesert by Edward VI in 1549.

While he was leasing the manor William Paget used the existing building of St Pauls which was situated near St Martin&#x27;s Parish church. Paget described the building as his &quot;cotage at Drayton&quot;. Once owning the manor he built a new manor house, completed by 1549, which occupied the western end of the churchyard. The Manor grounds contained the Church, ornamental gardens, stables, a dovecote and other outbuildings and was enclosed by a high brick wall and two gatehouses. The wall and one of the gatehouses can still be seen today. The construction of the manor house and grounds resulted in the demolition of villagers&#x27; homes on Church Road and building on the graves of generations of West Drayton people in the churchyard. In addition to this, Paget enclosed 150 acres of common land to add to his demesne. In 1550 Paget legalised his position by obtaining a royal pardon for his actions. The loss of the Parish churchyard was compensated for by the granting of an alternative burial site which was situated on the eastern side of where Drayton Hall is today. The burial site was used until 1888.

After serving as Lord Privy Seal under Mary I, poor health meant William Paget played little part in public life after the accession of Queen Elizabeth I in 1558, although as a Privy Councillor his advice was often sought. He died in West Drayton on 9 June 1563. He was succeeded by his son Henry, who died five years later without male issue. Henry&#x27;s brother Thomas became the 3rd Baron Paget in 1568.

Thomas Paget (1544–1590) and his brother Charles were both devout Roman Catholics, and would not conform to the Protestant religion of Queen Elizabeth I. 
Aided by Henry Percy, Paget fled to Paris on the uncovering of the Throckmorton Plot in November 1583, joining Charles who had been in exile there since 1581. The failed conspiracy&#x27;s plan was for an invasion of England by French forces under the command of Henry, Duke of Guise, financed by Philip II of Spain. English Catholics would then rise up and depose Elizabeth, placing Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots on the English throne.

After his flight to France Elizabeth issued a proclamation commanding Thomas Paget to return to England. In June 1584 a formal demand for the surrender of Paget was made to Henry III, King of France through the English ambassador, which was not carried out. 

In 1584 or 1585 Philip II made the decision for Spain to invade England and depose Queen Elizabeth. The ground invasion would be led by Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma with the majority of troops coming from the Spanish Netherlands. Parma commanded the Army of Flanders which was engaged in fighting England&#x27;s Protestant Dutch allies. 

Paget travelled to Spain and was given a pension of 180 crowns per month by Philip II. He then moved to the Spanish Netherlands where he was consulted by Parma in the planning of the invasion. The endeavour of July–August 1588 to stop England&#x27;s rise as a maritime power and to force the English and Welsh back to Roman Catholicism failed when the Spanish Armada required to support Parma&#x27;s passage from the Spanish Netherlands to England was scattered after engagements with the English Navy off the coast of Calais and Gravelines. Thomas Paget would die in Brussels in 1590.

In 1587 Thomas Paget had been attainted of treason by act of parliament. His lands including West Drayton were confiscated by the Crown. Elizabeth granted the manor to her Lord Chancellor, Sir Christopher Hatton for life. Hatton died in 1591 and from 1592 the manor was leased to her Lord Chamberlain, George Carey. Carey became 2nd Baron Hunsdon in 1596 and entertained Elizabeth at the West Drayton Manor House in October 1602.

In the next year 1603, both Elizabeth and George Carey died. With Elizabeth&#x27;s death, James I, son of Mary Queen of Scots acceded to the English throne. In 1604 James restored the Paget family lands and honours to Thomas Paget&#x27;s son William. William like James I was a Protestant and had taken part in the successful Anglo-Dutch capture of Cadiz (Gades) in 1596 with Admiral Charles Howard, Sir Walter Raleigh and Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. It is believed William Paget received possession of West Drayton Manor in 1610. In 1612 William Paget became an &#x27;Adventurer&#x27; (shareholder) and member of the Council of the Virginia Company (London Company) and the Somers Isles Company. The Paget Parish and Paget Island in Bermuda are named after him. He died on 29 August 1629 and is buried in St Martin&#x27;s Churchyard.

William Paget&#x27;s son, William Paget, 5th Baron Paget, (1609–1678) was among the Peers who petitioned King Charles I on 18 August 1640 to summon a parliament for the redress of grievances. However at the start of the Civil War he did not wish to take up arms against the king and joined him at York in June 1642. He raised a regiment of foot which fought for the King at the battle of Edgehill on 23 Oct 1642. In 1643/44 he was with the King at Oxford. Paget had his estates sequestered by Parliament and was fined £500 for supporting the King. He died in October 1678 and is buried in St Martin&#x27;s Churchyard.

William&#x27;s son, William Paget, 6th Baron Paget, (1637–1713) was appointed by William III as English Ambassador to Vienna (1689–1692) and Ambassador-Extraordinary to Constantinople (1692–1702). He was joint chairman at the congress of Karlowitz which resulted in the Treaty of Karlowitz of 26 January 1699 which brought peace between the Holy League and the Ottoman Empire after the 15 year Great Turkish War.

In 1714 William&#x27;s son, Henry Paget the 7th Lord Paget,(1663–1743), was created 1st Earl of Uxbridge by George I. Paget was a member of the Privy Council and the town of Uxbridge, Massachusetts is named in his honour. He died at West Drayton on 30 August 1743 and was buried at Hillingdon Church. 

Henry Paget was succeeded by his grandson, Henry Paget, 2nd Earl of Uxbridge (1719–1769). In 1755 Dawley House was acquired and the West Drayton Manor house was demolished around this time. Henry Paget died childless on 16 November 1769 and was buried in St Martin&#x27;s Churchyard. The title of 9th Baron Paget was given to Henry Bayly, whose name was changed to Henry Paget by Royal License in 1770. He was created 1st Earl of Uxbridge (Second creation) in May 1784. On 21 October 1786 Henry Bayly-Paget sold the Manor of West Drayton to Fysh Coppinger of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, for £12,000 ending the Paget family&#x27;s relationship with West Drayton.

===St Martin&#x27;s Church===
West Drayton&#x27;s parish church, dedicated to Martin of Tours, was first mentioned in the 12th century. However, no trace of the original church remains. The present church was first built in the 13th century, of which the base of the tower, the piscina and the north chancel wall are incorporated in the present building, which dates from the 15th century. The church was heavily restored and reordered in 1974, when the altar was resited at the west end. The baptismal font is a splendid example of mid-15th century work, and the parish chest is early 17th century. There are monumental brasses to Richard Roose (1406), Margaret Burnell (1529), her son John Burnell (1551) and Dr James Good (1581, a physician to Mary, Queen of Scots). There is a small memorial tablet to George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon (1547–1603) who was Lord of West Drayton Manor between 1592 and 1603. Carey&#x27;s father was Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s cousin. The memorial states how &#x27;bountiful&#x27; he was to the poor of the Parish. In his will Hunsdon left the sum of &#x27;one hundred marks for the benefit of the poor of West Drayton for ever.&#x27; This is one of the oldest West Drayton Parish charities and its small income is still distributed each New Year&#x27;s Day.

===St Catherine&#x27;s Catholic Church===

After the Potato Famine of the 1840s &quot;(known in Ireland as the Great Famine or Great Hunger)&quot;, Irish immigrants who were of the Roman Catholic religion and principally from counties Cork and Waterford arrived in West Drayton and took up residence in poor housing by The Green which became known locally as the Irish hovels. Today this is the site of Daisy Villas. Work for the Irish immigrants was found in the market-gardens surrounding West Drayton. 

The nearest official place of Catholic worship was St. Mary&#x27;s chapel at North Hyde, requiring a walk of over four miles each way to attend Mass on a Sunday. Because of this distance a Roman Catholic Mass was offered in a stable at the back of the Kings Head Public House adjacent to The Green. By 1862 the Reverend Andrew Mooney, priest at the St. Mary&#x27;s North Hyde Orphanage was using a cottage in Money Lane called the &#x27;White House&#x27; as a school and was conducting services there. He was succeeded by the Reverend Peter Francis Elkins, also the priest at the North Hyde Mission to which the school at West Drayton was attached. 

On 30 May 1867 West Drayton became a Catholic Mission with the Rev. Elkins becoming the resident priest. In July 1867 Rev. Elkins petitioned the Archbishop of Westminster to support the building of a church and school. The building of a church and school was given the special approbation of the Archbishop.

By September 1867 Rev. Elkins health had failed and the West Drayton Mission was undertaken by Reverend Michael Wren. Through the autumn, winter and spring of 1867-8 Rev. Wren requested financial donations for the new church and school stating that West Drayton was the most destitute mission in England with upwards of 300 persons being compelled to remain in the open air during Catholic mass.

On 19 December 1867 a house and land for the church and school was purchased at public auction for £855. Rev. Wren used the house as his Presbytery and a temporary chapel was created in the adjoining coach-house and stables. Premises at the back of the property were demolished to make room for the school. 

On 26 October 1868 the Most Reverend Dr. Henry Manning, Archbishop of Westminster laid the foundation stone of the Church of St Catherine of Alexandria. On 29 September 1869 he opened the church, preaching its first sermon. 

Despite Rev. Wren&#x27;s efforts in seeking donations, a loan was required to fund the building of the church and school. This debt resulted in the church not being consecrated until 29 September 1893, twenty-four years after its opening. Both the opening and consecration of the church occurred on 29 September, Michaelmas, the feast of St. Michael, Rev. Michael Wren&#x27;s patron saint. 

The church is built of buff stock brick with Bath stone dressing with dimensions of 85ft by 48ft and was designed by architects Samuel Joseph Nicholl and Thomas John Willson of London in the English Gothic style of the early 14th century. It was fitted to accommodate 500 persons and was constructed by builders James and William Fassnidge of Uxbridge. The schoolroom was 40ft long and 20ft broad and accommodated 250 children and was in use until 1939.

==Local economy==

Historically, employment was commonly connected to agriculture, the railway yards and the canal. The former RAF West Drayton hosted a military air traffic control centre co-located with the civil London Terminal Control Centre, residual functions of which were relocated to Swanwick, Hampshire entirely by January 2008.

West Drayton has a mixture of tradespeople, airport workers, construction workers and commuters in office professions or public utilities such as schools and hospitals. Its housing hosts people with a range of incomes, with relatively large areas built aesthetically in keeping with existing housing by the local authority.

West Drayton has rapid connectivity to the M4 and thereafter to the M25 and motorways north-west and south-west. The M4 spur and the A408 Stockley Road by-pass links to Heathrow Airport and to the Stockley Business Park, respectively. The Stockley Close Industrial estate lies on the eastern side of the by-pass. The businesses situated here are: Ocado, Greencore, Carrier Retail Systems, Amalga Ltd, Clevertronics, MNX Global Logistics and the Heathrow Parcel Centre.

Drayton Hall has the offices of Ferring Pharmaceuticals, Trizell Ltd, Kore Wireless and North South Wines. Britannia Court, on the east side of The Green, has the offices of the Schools HR Co-operative, MagLabs, Wells Burcombe LLP, MD Developments Ltd, Insultec Ltd, QIK Group and Flight Data Systems.

<text>Skoglar Toste or Skoglar Tosti (there are several variations) is a legendary 10th century chieftain from the Swedish province of West Gothland. Snorri Sturlusson recounts in &quot;Heimskringla&quot; that he was a great Viking who often waged war and that is why he was called &quot;Skagul&#x27;s Tosti&quot;. Skagul was a Valkyrie.

Toste is mentioned in several sagas, most notable in &quot;Heimskringla&quot;. According to Snorri Sturluson, he was the father of Sigrid the Haughty. For some time he gave refuge to Harald Grenske, who later came back to woo Sigrid, only to be killed by her for his persistence. According to the sagas, Skoglar Toste was also the father of Ulf Tostesson, father of Ragnvald Ulfsson and grandfather of Stenkil who became the King of Sweden in 1060.

Toste has been connected to the U 344 runestone in Orkesta in Vallentuna, near Stockholm, which tells of how Ulf of Borresta three times took danegeld:
: in ulfr hafiʀ o| |onklati &#x27; þru kialt| |takat þit uas fursta þis tusti ka-t &#x27; þ(a) ---- (þ)urktil &#x27; þa kalt knutr

Translation:
: &quot;And Ulf of Borresta (&quot;ulfr&quot;) has taken three payments in England. That was the first that Toste (&quot;tusti&quot;) paid. Then Thorkell the Tall (&quot;Þurktil &quot;) paid. Then Canute the Great (&quot;knutr&quot;) paid&quot;.

<doc id="911472" wikidata="Q7084639" url="?curid=911472" title="Old Norse poetry">
<text>Old Norse poetry encompasses a range of verse forms written in the Old Norse language, during the period from the 8th century to as late as the far end of the 13th century. Old Norse poetry is associated with the area now referred to as Scandinavia. Much Old Norse poetry was originally preserved in oral culture, but the Old Norse language ceased to be spoken and later writing tended to be confined to history rather than for new poetic creation, which is normal for an extinct language. Modern knowledge of Old Norse poetry is preserved by what was written down. Most of the Old Norse poetry that survives was composed or committed to writing in Iceland, after refined techniques for writing (such as the use of vellum, parchment paper, pens, and ink) were introduced—seemingly contemporaneously with the introduction of Christianity: thus, the general topic area of Old Norse poetry may be referred to as Old Icelandic poetry in literature.

There are also around 122 verses preserved in Swedish rune inscriptions, 54 in Norwegian and 12 in Danish. (See Eggjum stone.)

Poetry played an important role in the social and religious world of the Vikings. In &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, Snorri Sturluson, recounts the myth of how Odin brought the mead of poetry to Asgard. Poetry is referred to in such terms as &#x27;the drink of the raven-god (= Odin)&#x27; even in the oldest preserved poetry, which is an indicator of its significance within the ancient Scandinavian culture.

Old Norse poetry developed from the common Germanic alliterative verse, and as such has many commonalities with Old English, Old Saxon, and Old High German poetry, including alliteration, poetic circumlocutions termed kennings, and an expansive vocabulary of poetic synonyms, termed heiti.

Old Norse poetry is conventionally, and somewhat arbitrarily, split into two types: Eddaic poetry (also known as &quot;Eddic&quot; poetry) and Skaldic poetry. Eddaic poetry refers to poems on themes of mythology or ancient heroes, composed in simpler meters (see below) and with anonymous authors. Most of the Eddaic poems are preserved in the &quot;Codex Regius&quot; manuscript, but a few others survive in manuscripts like the fragmentary AM 748 I 4to. On the other hand, Skaldic poetry was usually written as praise for living kings and nobles, in more intricate meters and by known authors, known as skalds.

==Types of poetry==
There are various types of Old Norse poetry which have been preserved. Of particular interest to scholars are the Skaldic and Eddic lays, or poems. However, also of interest are occasional verse from other sources. Skaldic and Eddic works have many commonalities besides being written in Old Norse, such as alliteration; however, scholars usually distinguish the two based on certain characteristics.

===Distinction between Skaldic and Eddic poetry===
Scholarly distinction between Eddic and Skaldic works largely derives both from differing manuscript traditions and their typical matter and style.

====Manuscript sources====
One major distinction between Skaldic and Eddic poetry derives from the manuscript sources of the surviving known works. The large majority of works described as &quot;Eddic&quot; are found only in the Codex Regius, while a few of the poems found in it also survive in independent recensions in the AM 748 I 4to manuscript. Many verses from these Eddic poems are also quoted as evidence in the Prose Edda. Some poems not found in the early Eddic manuscripts are still considered to be &quot;Eddic&quot; due to their style. Examples include the &quot;Lay of Ríg&quot; from the &quot;Codex Wormianus&quot;; the &quot;Lay of Hyndla&quot; from the &quot;Flatey-jarbók&quot;; and, the &quot;Lay of Svipdag&quot;, which is only found in later, paper manuscripts (rather than vellum). Together, all of these poems are grouped under the somewhat fluid term the Poetic Edda.

====Matter and style====
Compared to the main skaldic style, the Eddic lays tend to be differentiated by three characteristics: the material deals with the mythology, ancient heroes, and ethics of the ancient Norse. Furthermore, the Eddic style is characterized by relative simplicity in terms of style and meter and, &quot;like the later folk songs and ballads, they are anonymous and objective, never betraying the feelings or attitudes of their authors.&quot; In contrast, the skaldic poetry tends to concern itself with contemporary events and personalities, although also sometimes dealing with or alluding to myth and legend; skaldic poetry avoids direct narration; and, it is often known who the authors of the skaldic verses are along with their dates, unlike the Eddic poetry.

==Metrical forms==
Old Norse poetry has many metrical forms (). They range from the ancient and relatively simple fornyrðislag (&#x27;air of ancient utterings&#x27;), closely related to the Old English meter, to the innovative and complex dróttkvætt ( &#x27;court-spoken meter&#x27;).

===Eddic metrical forms===
In Eddic, or Eddaic, poetry, the metric structures are for the most part either in the form of &quot;fornyrðislag&quot; (&quot;old story&quot;/&quot;epic meter&quot;) or &quot;ljóðaháttr&quot; (&quot;song&quot;/&quot;chant meter&quot;). Both &quot;fornyrðislag&quot; and &quot;ljóðaháttr&quot; verse form share similarities; such as, partial alliteration of stressed and grammatically important syllables, division of the verse into half lines or full lines and couplets, with fixed numbers of lines, line lengths determined by the number of stressed syllables (called &quot;lifts&quot;), and the linking of full lines or couplets by means of alliteration.

====Epic meter (&quot;Fornyrðislag&quot;)====
A verse form close to that of &quot;Beowulf&quot; was used on runestones and in the Old Norse Poetic Edda; in Norse, it was called &quot;fornyrðislag&quot;, which means &quot;old story metre&quot;. &quot;Fornyrðislag&quot; is the more commonly used Eddic meter, and is often used for narrative poems.

&quot;Fornyrðislag&quot; formally consists of eight line stanzas. Each line of the stanza has two vocally stressed syllables, also known as &quot;lifts&quot;, with a somewhat arbitrary number of other syllables. Through the use of alliteration, lines join into couplets. Generally, in the first line of &quot;fornyrðislag&quot;, both &quot;lifts&quot;, or stressed syllables alliterate. In the second line of any given couplet, only one of the two stressed syllables is alliterated, usually the first—this is the &quot;head-stave&quot; (or, &quot;hǫfuðstafr&quot;).

The word &quot;line&quot; and &quot;couplet&quot; need some clarification. Essentially, in fornyrðislag and many other forms, Norse poets treated each &quot;half-line&quot; of Germanic alliterative verse as a separate line. The Norse &quot;couplet&quot; is basically a single Germanic line, a pair of half-lines joined by alliteration. Thus, a Norse fornyrðislag stanza of eight lines corresponds to four lines of Old-English alliterative verse. Another difference between the Norse system and the general Germanic pattern is that the Norse poets, unlike the Old English poets, tended to treat each &quot;couplet&quot;, or Germanic line, as a complete syntactic unit, avoiding enjambment where a thought begun on one line continues through the following lines; only seldom do they begin a new sentence in the second half-line. This example is from the &quot;Waking of Angantyr&quot;:
&quot;Fornyrðislag&quot; had a variant form called &quot;málaháttr&quot; (&quot;meter of speeches&quot;), which adds an unstressed syllable to each half-line, making six to eight (sometimes up to ten) unstressed syllables per line. This meter is similar to that used in the Old Saxon Heliand. Conversely, another variant, &quot;kviðuháttr&quot;, has only three syllables in its odd half-lines (but four in the even ones).

====Chant meter (Ljóðaháttr)====
&quot;Ljóðaháttr&quot; (&quot;chant&quot; or &quot;ballad&quot; metre) is a stanzaic verse form, organized into four-line stanzas. The first and third lines were standard lines of Germanic alliterative verse with four lifts and two or three alliterations, separated into two half-lines with cæsura; the second and fourth lines had three lifts and two alliterations, and no cæsura. This example is from Freyr&#x27;s lament in &quot;Skírnismál&quot;:
Because of its structure, which comprises clearly defined rhythmic stanzas, &quot;ljóðaháttr&quot; lends itself to dialogue and discourse. There were a number of variant stanza forms based on &quot;ljóðaháttr&quot;, including &quot;galdralag&quot; (&quot;incantation meter&quot;), which adds a fifth short (three-lift) line at the end of the stanza; in this form, the fifth line usually echoes the fourth.

===Eddic topical characteristics===
Eddic poems have other common characteristics besides verse form. The Eddic poetry lays are diverse; however, three important common characteristics can be described: mythology, ethics, and heroic lore.

====Mythology====
One major topic of Eddic poetry is mythology. The mythological topics of Eddic poetry most importantly include Norse mythology, however other types of mythology are also involved, including various other Germanic traditions, probable Christian ideas, and a wide range of other possibilities.

====Ethics====
Many of the Eddic lays can be characterized as focused on ethical topics.

====Heroic lore====
Eddic poetry is to indebted narratives describing heroes, which was part of a long oral tradition, as well as textual.

===Skaldic metrical forms===
The skaldic forms were so called because of the existence of a socially-defined group of which the individual members were generally known by the term &quot;skald&quot;, or &quot;scold&quot;, or by similarly linguistically related terms, in Old Norse and particularly closely related languages. Basically, the skald was a type of poet.

====Verse forms====
In Skaldic poetry, the structures used tend to be complex, evolved from the common Germanic poetic tradition. Around a hundred meters are known, many only from Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s Háttatal. 

One of the simpler skaldic meters was &quot;kviðuháttr&quot;, a variant of fornyrðislag with alternating lines of 3 and 4 syllables, used in genealogical poems such as Þjóðólfr ór Hvíni&#x27;s Ynglingatal and Eyvindr Skáldaspillir&#x27;s Háleygjatal. Other Skaldic meters, sch as &quot;dróttkvætt&quot; and &quot;Hrynhenda&quot; were more complex..

=====Courtly Meter (&quot;Dróttkvætt&quot;)=====

&quot;Dróttkvætt&quot;, meaning &quot;courtly metre&quot;, added internal rhymes and other forms of assonance to its stanza structures. The resulting verse form goes well beyond the requirements of Germanic alliterative verse and strongly resembles Celtic (Irish and Welsh) verse forms. The &quot;dróttkvætt&quot; stanza had eight lines, each having usually three lifts and almost invariably six syllables. Although other stress patterns appear, the verse is predominantly trochaic. The last two syllables in each line had to form a trochee (there are a few specific forms which utilize a stressed word at line-end, such as in some &quot;docked&quot; forms). In addition, specific requirements obtained for odd-numbered and even-numbered lines.

In the odd-numbered lines (equivalent to the a-verse of the traditional alliterative line):

*Two of the stressed syllables alliterate with each other.
*Two of the stressed syllables share partial rhyme of consonants (which was called &quot;skothending&quot;) with dissimilar vowels (e.g. &quot;hat and &quot;bet), not necessarily at the end of the word (e.g. &quot;touching&quot; and &quot;orchard&quot;).

In the even lines (equivalent to the b-verse of the traditional alliterative line):

*The first stressed syllable must alliterate with the alliterative stressed syllables of the previous line.
*Two of the stressed syllables rhyme (&quot;aðalhending&quot;, e.g. &quot;hat and &quot;cat), not necessarily at the end of the word (e.g. &quot;torching&quot; and &quot;orchard&quot;).

The requirements of the verse form were so demanding that occasionally the text of the poems had to run parallel, with one thread of syntax running through the on-side of the half-lines, and another running through the off-side. According to the &quot;Fagrskinna&quot; collection of sagas, King Harald III of Norway uttered these lines of &quot;dróttkvætt&quot; at the Battle of Stamford Bridge; the internal assonances and the alliteration are emboldened:

:&quot;Krjúpum vér fyr vápna,&quot;
:&quot;(valteigs), brǫkun eigi,&quot;
:&quot;(svá bauð Hildr), at hjaldri,&quot;
:&quot;(haldorð), í bug skjaldar.&quot;
:&quot;(Hátt bað mik), þar&#x27;s mœttusk,&quot;
:&quot;(menskorð bera forðum),&quot;
:&quot;hlakkar íss ok hausar,&quot;
:&quot;(hjalmstall í gný malma).&quot;

: In battle, we do not creep behind a shield before the din of weapons (so said the goddess of hawk-land [a valkyrja], true of words). She who wore the necklace bade me to bear my head high in battle, when the battle-ice [a gleaming sword] seeks to shatter skulls.

The bracketed words in the poem (&quot;so said the goddess of hawk-land, true of words&quot;) are syntactically separate but interspersed within the text of the rest of the verse. The elaborate &quot;kennings&quot; manifested here are also practically necessary in this complex and demanding form, as much to solve metrical difficulties as for the sake of vivid imagery. Intriguingly, the saga claims that Harald improvised these lines after he gave a lesser performance (in &quot;fornyrðislag&quot;); Harald judged that verse bad and then offered this one in the more demanding form. While the exchange may be fictionalized, the scene illustrates the regard in which the form was held.

Most &quot;dróttkvætt&quot; poems that survive appear in one or another of the Norse sagas; several of the sagas are biographies of skaldic poets.

=====Flowing Verse (&quot;Hrynhenda&quot;)=====
&quot;Hrynhenda&quot; or &quot;hrynjandi háttr&quot; (&#x27;the flowing verse-form&#x27;) is a later development of &quot;dróttkvætt&quot; with eight syllables per line instead of six, with the similar rules of rhyme and alliteration, although each &quot;hrynhent&quot;-variant shows particular subtleties. It is first attested around 985 in the so-called &quot;Hafgerðingadrápa&quot; of which four lines survive (alliterants and rhymes bolded):

:&quot;Mínar biðk at munka reyni&quot;
:&quot;meinalausan farar beina;&quot;
:&quot;heiðis haldi hárar foldar&quot;
:&quot;hallar dróttinn of mér stalli.&quot;

: I ask the tester of monks (God) for a safe journey; the lord of the palace of the high ground (God — here we have a kenning in four parts) keep the seat of the falcon (hand) over me.

The author was said to be a Christian from the Hebrides, who composed the poem asking God to keep him safe at sea. (&quot;Note&quot;: The third line is, in fact, over-alliterated. There should be exactly two alliterants in the odd-numbered lines.) The metre gained some popularity in courtly poetry, as the rhythm may sound more majestic than dróttkvætt.

We learn much about these in the &quot;Hattatal&quot;: Snorri gives for certain at least three different variant-forms of hrynhenda. These long-syllabled lines are explained by Snorri as being &quot;extra-metrical&quot; in most cases: the &quot;main&quot; form never has alliteration &quot;or&quot; rhyme in the first 2 syllables of the odd-lines (i.e., rhymes always coming at the fourth-syllable), and the even-lines never have rhyme on the fifth/sixth syllables (i.e.: they cannot harbor rhyme in these places because they extra-metrical), the following couplet shows the paradigm:

:&quot;Tiggi snýr á ógnar áru&quot;
:&quot;(Undgagl veit þat) sóknar hagli&quot;.&quot; &quot;

[Note the juxtaposition of alliteration and rhyme of the even-line]

Then, the variant-forms show unsurprising dróttkvætt patterns overall; the main difference being that the first trochee of the odd-lines are technically not reckoned as extrametrical since they harbor &quot;alliteration&quot;, but the even-lines&#x27; extra-metrical feature is more or less as the same. The 2nd form is the &quot;troll-hrynjandi&quot;: in the odd-lines the alliteration is moved to the &quot;first&quot; metrical position (no longer &quot;extra-metrical&quot;) while the rhyme remains the same (Snorri seems to imply that &quot;frumhending&quot;, which is placing a rhyme on the first syllable of any line, is preferably avoided in all these forms: the rhymes are always preferred as &quot;oddhending&quot;, &quot;middle-of-the-line rhymes&quot;) — in the even-lines the rhyme and alliteration are not juxtaposed, and this is a key feature of its distinction (the significant features only are marked in bold below):

:&quot;Stála kendi steykvilundum&quot;
:&quot;Styriar valdi raudu falda&quot;...&quot; &quot;

The next form, which Snorri calls &quot;ordinary/standard hrynhenda&quot;, is almost like a &quot;combination&quot; of the previous — alliteration always on the first metrical-position, and the rhymes in the odd-lines juxtaposed (all features in bold in this example):

:&quot;Vafdi lítt er virdum mætti&quot;
:&quot;Vígrækiandi fram at sækia.&quot;&quot;

There is one more form which is a bit different though seemed to be counted among the previous group by Snorri, called &quot;draughent&quot;. The syllable-count changes to &quot;seven&quot; (and, whether relevant to us or not, the second-syllable seems to be counted as the extra-metrical):

:&quot;Vápna hríd velta nádi&quot;
:&quot;Vægdarlaus feigum hausi.&quot;
:&quot;Hilmir lét höggum mæta&quot;
:&quot;Herda klett bana verdant.&quot;

As one can see, there is very often clashing stress in the middle of the line (&quot;Vápna hríd velta...//..Vægdarlaus feigum...&quot;, etc.), and &quot;oddhending&quot; seems preferred (as well as keeping alliterative and rhyming syllables separated, which likely has to do with the syllabic-makeup of the line).

<text>Aaron Wells Peirsol (born July 23, 1983) is an American former competition swimmer and backstroke specialist who is a former world champion and world record-holder. He is a three-time Olympian and seven-time Olympic medalist (five gold, two silver). Individually, he currently holds the world record in the 200-meter backstroke event (long course). In February 2011, Peirsol announced his retirement, saying, &quot;I ended up doing everything I set out to do.&quot;

Peirsol swam for the University of Texas in the Big 12 Conference under Hall of Fame Coach Eddie Reese and Associate Coach Kris Kubik. At University of Texas at Austin, he graduated in 2006, majoring in Political Science, and was the 2003 NCAA Swimmer of the Year.

Peirsol&#x27;s successes have earned him the American Swimmer of the Year Award once. He has won a total of thirty-six medals in major international competition: twenty-nine gold, six silver, and one bronze spanning the Olympics, the World, Pan American, and the Pan Pacific Championships.

In his Olympic debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics, at the age of 17, Peirsol won a silver medal in the 200-meter backstroke. Four years later, at the 2004 Summer Olympics, Peirsol won gold in the 100-meter and 200-meter backstroke (sweeping the backstroke events) and the 4×100-meter medley relay. In his third Olympics (2008 Summer Olympics), Peirsol won gold in the 100-meter backstroke and the 4×100-meter medley relay. He came short of his success he had in Athens by winning silver in the 200-meter backstroke, finishing behind Ryan Lochte.

==Personal life==

Peirsol was born in Newport Beach, California, in 1983, the son of Scott and Wella Peirsol. His father is a captain and his mother is a retired dental hygienist. He has one younger sister, Hayley, who is also a swimmer. In 2003, Peirsol and his sister became the first sibling duo to medal at the same FINA World Championships. He is a 2002 graduate of Newport Harbor High School in Newport Beach, California. After finishing his second year of collegiate eligibility, Peirsol signed with Nike, Inc., thus turning professional. Peirsol trained under the guidance of Eddie Reese and Kris Kubik.

Peirsol is also involved in a number of charities. He is an ambassador for the Global Water Foundation and the Surfrider Foundation. He is also a spokesman for Oceana, which is the largest international ocean conservation and advocacy organization.

==Swimming career==

===2000–2002===

Peirsol qualified for his first Olympics at the age of seventeen after finishing second to Lenny Krayzelburg in the 200-meter backstroke at the 2000 U.S. Olympic Team Trials. Peirsol also competed in the 100-meter backstroke, but did not qualify for the event finals At the 2000 Summer Olympics, Peirsol finished second to Krayzelburg in the 200-meter backstroke. Afterwards Peirsol said, &quot;I think I&#x27;m getting to a point where I&#x27;m becoming more of a threat to (Lenny) and I think he knows that.&quot;

At the 2001 National Championships, with Krayzelburg not competing, Peirsol qualified for the 2001 World Aquatics Championships in Fukuoka, Japan, in the 100-meter backstroke, the 200-meter backstroke, and the 4×100-meter medley relay. Peirsol&#x27;s time in the 200-meter backstroke was the second-fastest ever, with only Krayzelburg&#x27;s world record faster. At the 2001 World Aquatics Championships, Peirsol won gold in the 200-meter backstroke with a time of 1:57.13, a championship record.

Peirsol started off 2002 with the first world record of his career in the 200-meter backstroke, bettering Krayzelburg&#x27;s mark set in 1999. In his first major competition of 2002, Peirsol won five medals (three gold, one silver, one bronze) at the 2002 FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m) in Moscow. In Moscow, he was a part of the American team that broke the world record in the 4×100-meter medley relay and he broke the 200-meter backstroke world record. At the 2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Yokohama, Japan, Peirsol won gold in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke and the 4×100-meter medley relay. Combined with Brendan Hansen, Michael Phelps, and Jason Lezak, Peirsol set the world record in the 4×100-meter medley relay to break the previous record set in 2000.

===2003 World Championships===

At the 2003 World Aquatics Championships in Barcelona, Spain, Peirsol won gold in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke and the 4×100-meter medley relay. He also won a silver medal in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay. In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol won gold in a time of 53.61, a championship record. His time was just 0.01 s off Lenny Krayzelburg&#x27;s world record. Peirsol participated in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay with Michael Phelps, Nate Dusing, and Klete Keller to win silver behind Australia. Peirsol then competed in the 200-meter backstroke and won gold in a time of 1:55.92, almost two seconds ahead of second-place finisher Gordan Kožulj of Croatia. Peirsol also competed in the 50-meter backstroke and the 4×100-meter medley relay. In the 50-meter backstroke, Peirsol finished out of medal contention with an 8th-place finish. In his last event, Peirsol competed in the 4×100-meter medley relay with Brendan Hansen, Ian Crocker, and Jason Lezak. The final time of 3:31.54 was a new world record, bettering the old mark from 2002.

===2004 Summer Olympics===

At the 2004 U.S. Olympic Team Trials, Peirsol won individual titles in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke. Four years after finishing in 4th place at the 2000 U.S. Olympic Team Trials, Peirsol won the 100-meter backstroke title, beating Lenny Krayzelburg. Peirsol was the only individual in the field to break 54 seconds and was just off Krayzelburg&#x27;s world record. In the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol won in a world record time of 1:54.74, bettering his previous record of 1:55.15 set in 2002. He beat his closest competitor, Michael Phelps, by more than a second.

At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, Peirsol won gold in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke, sweeping the backstroke events, and the 4×100-meter medley relay. In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol won gold in a time of 54.06, 0.29 s ahead of second-place finisher Markus Rogan of Austria. In his second event, the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol won gold in an Olympic record time of 1:54.95 and completed a clean sweep of the backstroke events. Rogan again finished second to Peirsol, 2.40 s back. An initial disqualification alleged that Peirsol had made an illegal turn during the 200-meter backstroke race. Having been improperly entered, the disqualification was eventually overturned. In his last event, the 4×100-meter medley relay, Peirsol combined with Brendan Hansen, Ian Crocker, and Jason Lezak to win gold in a world record time of 3:30.68, 2.94 s ahead of second-place finisher Germany. While leading off the relay, Peirsol broke the world record in the 100-meter backstroke with a time of 53.45, bettering Krayzelburg&#x27;s time of 53.60 set in 1999.

Peirsol caused minor controversy when he accused Kosuke Kitajima of Japan of using an illegal dolphin kick in the 100-meter breaststroke final when compatriot Brendan Hansen lost by 0.17 s.

===2004 FINA Short Course World Championships===

Shortly after the 2004 Summer Olympics, Peirsol competed at the 2004 FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m) in Indianapolis where he won three gold medals.

In the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol won gold in a world record time of 1:50.52, bettering his old mark of 1:50.64 (set earlier in 2004) and finished 2.02 s ahead of Matt Welsh of Australia. Peirsol then competed in the 4×100-meter medley relay with Brendan Hansen, Ian Crocker, and Jason Lezak to win gold in a world record time of 3:25.09, 4.63 s ahead of Australia. Peirsol also competed in the 50-meter backstroke but finished out of medal contention.

In the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol won and broke his own world record with a time of 53.17, bettering his time of 53.45 set in Athens. In the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol easily won with a time of 1:55.13.

At the 2005 World Aquatics Championships in Montreal, Quebec, Peirsol won gold in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke and the 4×100-meter medley relay.

For his second event, the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol won in dominating fashion. His time of 1:54.66 was a new world record and 1.97 s ahead of second-place finisher Markus Rogan. Peirsol then competed in the 4×100-meter medley relay with Brendan Hansen, Ian Crocker, and Jason Lezak to win gold in a time of 3:31.85, 3.23 s ahead of second-place finisher Russia. Peirsol also competed in the 50-meter backstroke but finished out of medal contention.

===2006 Pan Pacific Championships===

At the 2006 National Championships, the selection meet for the 2006 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships and the 2007 World Aquatics Championships, Peirsol won individual titles in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke. At the 2006 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Victoria, British Columbia, Peirsol won gold in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke and the 4×100-meter medley relay. In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol won gold in a championship record time of 53.32.

===2007 World Championships===

At the 2007 World Aquatics Championships in Melbourne, Australia, Peirsol won one gold and one silver medal. In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol won gold in a world record time of 52.98, bettering his time of 53.17 set in 2005. Peirsol became the first man in the event to go under 53 seconds and beat Ryan Lochte by 0.52 s. At the time, Peirsol held five of the fastest times posted in the event. At one point during the first 50-meters, Peirsol was a full meter behind Ryan Lochte, and at the turn, Peirsol was in third place behind Liam Tancock and Lochte. But Peirsol had a superior finish to over-take both swimmers. After the race, Peirsol thanked Lochte for the fast start, which he attributed to the world record. In the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol placed second to Lochte and lost his world record he set in 2006. Throughout the race, Peirsol was in first and at the 150-meter mark, Peirsol was ahead of Lochte 1:24.56 to 1:25.05. But Lochte had a strong finish to over-take Peirsol for the win. For Peirsol, it was his first international loss in the event since the 2000 Summer Olympics. Peirsol did not have a chance to swim in the 4×100-meter medley relay final because the United States was disqualified in the heats.

===2008 Summer Olympics===

At the 2008 U.S. Olympic Team Trials, Peirsol won individual titles in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke, repeating his results from the 2004 U.S. Olympic Team Trials. In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol won ahead of Matt Grevers with a world record time of 52.89, lowering his previous mark of 52.98 set last year. In his second event, the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol won in a time of 1:54.32, equalling Ryan Lochte&#x27;s world record set last year. Lochte finished a close second, just 0.02 s behind Peirsol.

At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, Peirsol won gold in the 100-meter backstroke and the 4×100-meter medley relay. He also won silver in the 200-meter backstroke.

For the final of the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol was swimming in lane two, having qualified fifth in the semi-finals. At the first 50-meters in the 100-meter backstroke final, Peirsol was in second place behind Liam Tancock, who took it out in 25.11. Peirsol was 0.54 s behind Tancock at the turn. However, after the turn, Peirsol overtook Tancock, who eventually placed sixth, and won the gold. Peirsol&#x27;s final time of 52.54 was a new world record, bettering his previous mark of 52.89 set last month. After the race, Peirsol said, &quot;I&#x27;m a little bit excited, a little bit relieved, absolutely elated.&quot; In his second event, the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol placed second to Ryan Lochte 1:54.33 to 1:53.94.

===2009 World Championships===

At the 2009 National Championships, the selection meet for the 2009 World Aquatics Championships, Peirsol won individual titles in the 100- and 200-meter backstroke. In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol won in a time of 51.94, reclaiming the world record from Aschwin Wildeboer. In winning the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol became the first person to swim the event in under 52 seconds and it was the sixth time he set the world record in the event. In the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol defeated Ryan Lochte and reclaimed the 200-meter backstroke world record he lost in Beijing. Peirsol also competed in the 100-meter butterfly but did not qualify for the event in Rome, finishing in third place.

At the 2009 World Aquatics Championships in Rome, Peirsol won two gold medals. In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol surprised many after he failed to make the final, which he attributed to a miscalculation of his own position in the semi-finals. Peirsol said, &quot;I thought I was going faster. I am very disappointed. I completely misjudged my race. I have to go on, pick myself up and focus on my next events.&quot; But Peirsol&#x27;s world record in the 100-meter backstroke would stay in place after the final. In his second event, the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol won the gold in a time of 1:51.92, breaking his own world record of 1:53.08 by more than a second. Peirsol then competed in the 50-meter backstroke but did not advance past the heats. In his last event, the 4×100-meter medley relay, Peirsol combined with Eric Shanteau, Michael Phelps, and David Walters to win gold in a world record time of 3:27.28, lowering the old mark of 3:29.34 set a year ago in Beijing. While leading off the relay, Peirsol broke the championship record in the 100-meter backstroke with a time of 52.19, bettering the previous mark of 52.26 set by Junya Koga.

===2010===

At the 2010 National Championships, Peirsol placed second in both the 100- and 200-meter backstroke. In the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol placed second to David Plummer, who touched just 0.03 s ahead. For Peirsol, it was his first loss in the 100-meter backstroke at a national championships since he placed 4th at the 2000 U.S. Olympic Team Trials. In the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol placed second to Ryan Lochte, who finished 0.70 s ahead.

At the 2010 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Irvine, California, Peirsol won gold in the 100-meter backstroke and the 4×100-meter medley relay. Peirsol&#x27;s first gold came in the 100-meter backstroke. Initially, Peirsol did not qualify to swim in the medal-awarding final because only a maximum of two swimmers from one country could enter in the finals and David Plummer and Ryan Lochte owned the top two American spots. However, Lochte withdrew from the 100-meter backstroke and as a result, Peirsol advanced to the finals. Peirsol won the gold in a time of 53.31, breaking his own championship record set in 2006. Peirsol then competed in the 200-meter backstroke but did not qualify to swim in the medal-awarding final, with Lochte and Tyler Clary taking the top two American spots. In his final event, the 4×100-meter medley relay, Peirsol won gold along with compatriots Mark Gangloff, Michael Phelps, and Nathan Adrian. This would be the last race of his international career. When the competition was over, Peirsol said he put his swimming equipment in a locker and walked away.

==Retirement==

On February 2, 2011, at the age of twenty-seven, Peirsol announced that he was officially retiring from professional swimming. This ended months of speculation after Peirsol withdrew from his spots in both the 2010 FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m) in Dubai and the 2011 World Aquatics Championships in Shanghai. Peirsol said he contemplated retirement after the 2008 Summer Olympics. In 2010, he said he had no further goals and found it difficult to swim because he &quot;ended up doing everything (he) set out to do.&quot; He added, &quot;Things outside of the sport started to interest me.&quot; Peirsol said it was &quot;poetic&quot; that 2010 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships, his final competition, was held at the pool where he trained in childhood. Peirsol plans to go to graduate school at the University of Texas at Austin to study political science.

Peirsol returned to Newport Beach where he works as a seasonal ocean lifeguard and swim coach at his alma mater, Newport Harbor High School.

In November 2015 it was announced that Peirsol would be inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame Class of 2016 alongside fellow Americans Dara Torres and coach Bob Bowman.

<doc id="911478" wikidata="Q5113243" url="?curid=911478" title="Christopher Skase">
<text>Christopher Charles Skase (18 September 1948 – 5 August 2001) was an Australian businessman who later became one of his country&#x27;s most wanted fugitives, after his business empire crashed spectacularly and he fled to Majorca, Spain.

==Early life==
Skase was born into a wealthy Melbourne family. His father was Charles Skase, 1948 winner of the Melbourne Sun-Aria, and prominent on-air personality on radio station 3DB, including his role as star of the live-to-air program, &quot;The Happy Gang&quot;, in the 1950s. Skase was educated at Malvern and Caulfield Grammar Schools.

==Career==
Skase began his career as a stockbroker, but soon became a finance journalist instead, working at &quot;The Sun News-Pictorial&quot;. In 1975 he purchased Qintex, a small Tasmanian company.

Skase slowly developed Qintex and, over several years, turned it into one of Australia&#x27;s larger corporations. By the late 1980s, the Qintex group was worth A$1.5 billion. Skase owned five resorts as well as interests in the Seven television network and the Brisbane Bears football club. On the eve of the 1990 economic recession, his two Mirage resorts in Queensland were among the largest in the country and one of them, the Mirage Port Douglas Resort, played a key role in putting the formerly small town of Port Douglas on the international tourist map.

Skase became known for his displays of wealth, with a lavish 40th birthday party in 1988, and a company Christmas party that cost $450,000. In one particular incident, he had his private jet fly from Port Douglas to Melbourne to pick up a dress for his wife, Pixie.

==Downfall==
By 1989, interest rates had risen, an attempt to buy the MGM film studios fell through, and Skase was forced to sell half of his resorts to Japanese investors. In the months that followed, it became clear that Skase and the Qintex group had overextended themselves.

According to a 1998 report by ABC program &quot;Four Corners&quot;, Skase had begun obtaining and moving money into foreign bank accounts in July 1989. Despite efforts lasting more than a decade, Max Donnelly, the creditors&#x27; trustee, was unable to trace much of the missing money.

At a meeting in October, Skase began to fall out with the Qintex board. He demanded that the board pay $13.5 million to a private company that he owned. The board refused to ratify the payment, but soon discovered that the payment had already been made. Skase then demanded the board give him a pay rise, and threatened to resign if he did not receive it. The board refused, with several members themselves threatening to resign.

One of the directors reported the incident to the Australian Securities Commission. The creditors moved in, and Qintex collapsed. Skase was forced to sell the Seven Network for a tiny portion of what he had paid for it. In the end, Skase was more than $700 million in debt. He began to parcel up his remaining wealth, including more than $900,000 worth of antiques and furniture.

==Exile to Spain==
He was charged with improperly using his position to obtain management fees, briefly arrested and spent a night in jail. However, he was subsequently released and allowed to regain his passport. He promptly fled the country. His discovery on the Spanish island of Majorca in 1991 by the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; sparked intense media interest. In 1994, the Australian Securities Commission assembled a case against Skase, with the assistance of former Skase associate Lawrence Van der Plaat, and began to chase him in earnest.

Throughout the 1990s, successive Australian governments, in combination with Max Donnelly, attempted to have Skase extradited from Spain, with no success. Skase claimed that he was unable to travel due to a life-threatening lung condition. This was disputed by the Australian government, who released a video filmed by some Australian tourists, which featured Skase walking easily on a local beach. During this period, Skase also attempted to build a new business empire, and continued to live in a multimillion-dollar mansion.

In one incident, television personality Andrew Denton organized a public subscription to hire a bounty hunter to kidnap Skase. However, after raising $250,000 the idea was called off on legal advice.

In May 1998, the Australian government canceled Skase&#x27;s passport. Skase was ordered to leave Majorca by 23 July, but lodged an appeal. The extradition process was still tied up in the courts when, the following month, he became a citizen of Dominica. At this point, numerous commentators suggested that the chase was over, and that there was nothing more that could be done to bring Skase back to Australia.

==Personal life==
Skase was married to Pixie Skase. She remained in exile in Dominica until returning to Melbourne in 2008. Pixie Skase died in Melbourne on 15 November 2024, aged 83.

==Death==
By 2001, both the Australian government and Donnelly were starting to grow weary of the large costs of continuing the chase for Skase with $3 million having been spent. Nevertheless, there was renewed speculation in January that Skase would soon be deported from Spainin which case it would have been legally possible to bring him back to Australia, with which Dominica had an extradition treaty. However, he became ill and died of stomach cancer in Majorca on 5 August 2001, before any further proceedings had taken place.

==In popular culture==
A satirical 2001 film, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Skase&quot;, is based on an invented plot to kidnap Christopher Skase in Majorca.

TISM bassist Jock Cheese&#x27;s solo album &quot;Platter&quot; features the song &quot;Totally Addicted to Skase&quot;, whose title parodies &quot;Addicted to Bass&quot;, about the media coverage of the chase for Skase.

<doc id="911479" wikidata="Q51631" url="?curid=911479" title="Miracles of Jesus">
<text>The miracles of Jesus are the many miraculous deeds attributed to Jesus in Christian texts, with the majority of these miracles being faith healings, exorcisms, resurrections, and control over nature.

In the Gospel of John, Jesus is said to have performed seven miraculous signs that characterize his ministry, from changing water into wine at the start of his ministry to raising Lazarus from the dead at the end.

For many Christians and Muslims, the miracles are believed to be actual historical events. Others, including many liberal Christians, consider these stories to be figurative. 

Since the Age of Enlightenment, many scholars have taken a highly skeptical approach to claims about miracles. There is less agreement on the interpretation of miracles than in former times, though there is a scholarly consensus that the Historical Jesus was viewed as a miracle-worker during his lifetime. Non-religious historians commonly avoid commenting on the veracity of miracles as the sources are limited and considered problematic. Some scholars rule out miracles altogether while others defend the possibility, either with reservations or more strongly (in the latter case commonly reflecting religious views).

==Types and motives==
In most cases, Christian authors associate each miracle with specific teachings that reflect the message of Jesus.

In &quot;The Miracles of Jesus&quot;, H. Van der Loos describes two main categories of miracles attributed to Jesus: those that affected people (such as Jesus healing the blind man of Bethsaida), or &quot;healings&quot;, and those that &quot;controlled nature&quot; (such as Jesus walking on water). The three types of healings are cures, in which an ailment is miraculously remedied, exorcisms, in which demons are cast out of victims, and the resurrection of the dead. Karl Barth said that, among these miracles, the Transfiguration of Jesus is unique in that the miracle happens to Jesus himself.

According to Craig Blomberg, one characteristic shared among all miracles of Jesus in the Gospel accounts is that he delivered benefits freely and never requested or accepted any form of payment for his healing miracles, unlike some high priests of his time who charged those who were healed. In he advised his disciples to heal the sick without payment and stated, &quot;Freely ye received, freely give.&quot;

It is not always clear when two reported miracles refer to the same event. For example, in the healing the centurion&#x27;s servant, the Gospels of Matthew and Luke narrate how Jesus healed the servant of a centurion in Capernaum at a distance. The Gospel of John has a similar but slightly different account at Capernaum and states that it was the son of a royal official who was cured at a distance.

===Healing those who were ill and infirm===
The largest group of miracles mentioned in the Gospels involves healing people who are ill, infirm or disabled. The Gospels give varying amounts of detail for each episode; sometimes Jesus cures simply by saying a few words, at other times, he employs material such as spit and mud. And as per Luke 4:40, &quot;...all those who...were sick...were brought to Him, and He laid His hands on every one of them and healed them.&quot; [citation needed]

==== Blind people ====
The canonical Gospels contain a number of stories about Jesus healing blind people. The earliest is a story of the healing of a blind man in Bethsaida in the Gospel of Mark.

Mark&#x27;s gospel gives an account of Jesus healing a blind man named Bartimaeus as Jesus is leaving Jericho. The Gospel of Matthew has a simpler account loosely based on this, with two unnamed blind men instead of one (this &quot;doubling&quot; is a characteristic of Matthew&#x27;s treatment of Mark&#x27;s text) and a slightly different version of the story, taking place in Galilee, earlier in the narrative. The Gospel of Luke tells the same story of Jesus healing an unnamed blind man but moves the event in the narrative to when Jesus approaches Jericho.

The Gospel of John describes an episode in which Jesus heals a man blind from birth, placed during the Festival of Tabernacles, about six months before his crucifixion. Jesus mixes spittle with dirt to make a mud mixture, which he then places on the man&#x27;s eyes. He instructs the man to wash his eyes in the Pool of Siloam. When the man does this, he is able to see. When asked by his disciples whether the cause of the blindness was the man&#x27;s sins or his parents&#x27; sins, Jesus states that it was due to neither.

==== Lepers ====
A story in which Jesus cures a leper appears in , and . Having cured the man, Jesus instructs him to offer the requisite ritual sacrifices as prescribed by the Deuteronomic Code and Priestly Code and to not tell anyone who had healed him. But the man disobeyed, increasing Jesus&#x27;s fame, and thereafter Jesus withdrew to deserted places but was followed there.

In an episode in the Gospel of Luke (), while on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus sends ten lepers who sought his assistance to the priests, and they were healed as they go, but the only one who comes back to thank Jesus is a Samaritan.

==== Paralytics ====
Healing the paralytic at Capernaum appears in Matthew 9:1–8, and . The Synoptics state that a paralytic was brought to Jesus on a mat; Jesus told him to &quot;get up and walk&quot;, and the man did so. Jesus also told the man that his sins were forgiven, which irritated the Pharisees. Jesus is described as responding to the anger by asking whether it is easier to say that someone&#x27;s sins are forgiven, or to tell the man to &quot;get up and walk&quot;. Mark and Luke state that Jesus was in a house at the time, and that the man had to be lowered through the roof by his friends due to the crowds blocking the door.

A similar cure is described in the Gospel of John as the healing the paralytic at Bethesda and occurs at the Pool of Bethesda. In this cure Jesus also tells the man to take his mat and walk.

==== Women ====
The curing of a bleeding woman appears in , and , along with the miracle of the daughter of Jairus. The Gospels state that while heading to Jairus&#x27;s house, Jesus was approached by a woman who had been bleeding for 12 years and that she touched Jesus&#x27;s cloak (fringes of his garment) and was instantly healed. Jesus turned about and, when the woman came forward, said, &quot;Daughter, your faith has healed you, go in peace&quot;.

The Synoptics describe Jesus as healing the mother-in-law of Simon Peter when he visited Simon&#x27;s house in Capernaum, around the time of Jesus recruiting Simon as an Apostle (Mark records the event occurring just after the calling of Simon, while Luke records it just before). The Synoptics imply that this led other people to seek out Jesus.

Jesus healing an infirm woman appears in . While teaching in a synagogue on the Sabbath, Jesus cured a woman who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years and could not stand straight at all.

====Other healings====
The healing of a man with dropsy is described in . In this miracle, Jesus cured a man with dropsy at the house of a prominent Pharisee on the Sabbath. Jesus justified the cure by asking, &quot;If one of you has a child or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day, will you not immediately pull it out?&quot;

In the healing of the man with a withered hand, the Synoptics state that Jesus entered a synagogue on Sabbath and found a man with a withered hand, whom Jesus healed, having first challenged the people present to decide what was lawful for Sabbath—to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill. The Gospel of Mark adds that this angered the Pharisees so much that they started to contemplate killing Jesus.

The miraculous healing the deaf mute of Decapolis only appears in the Gospel of Mark. Mark states that Jesus went to the Decapolis, met a man there who was deaf and mute, and cured him. Specifically, Jesus first touched the man&#x27;s ears, then touched his tongue after spitting, and then said, &quot;Ephphatha!&quot;, an Aramaic word meaning &quot;be opened&quot;&quot;.&quot;

The miraculous healing of a centurion&#x27;s servant is reported in and . These two Gospels narrate how Jesus healed the servant of a centurion in Capernaum. has a similar account at Capernaum but states that it was the son of a royal official who was healed. In both cases the healing took place at a distance.

Jesus healing in the land of Gennesaret appears in and . As Jesus passes through Gennesaret all those who touch his cloak are healed.

 also reports that after the miracle of Jesus exorcising a mute, Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness.

The healing of Malchus was Christ&#x27;s final miracle before his resurrection. Simon Peter had cut off the ear of the High Priest&#x27;s servant, Malchus, during the scene in the Garden of Gethsemane. Jesus restored the ear by touching it with his hand.

=== Exorcisms ===

According to the three Synoptic Gospels, Jesus performed many exorcisms of demons. These incidents are not mentioned in the Gospel of John and appear to have been excluded due to theological considerations.

The seven major exorcism accounts in the Synoptic Gospels which have details, and imply specific teachings, are as follows:
* Exorcism at the Synagogue in Capernaum—Jesus exorcises an evil spirit who cries out, &quot;What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!&quot;
* Exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac or Miracle of the (Gadarene) Swine—Jesus exorcises a possessed man (changed in the Gospel of Matthew to two men). When Jesus asks the demon&#x27;s name (finding the name of the possessing demon was an important traditional tool of exorcists), he is given the reply Legion, &quot;for we are many&quot;. When the demons ask to be expelled into a nearby group of pigs rather than be sent out of the area, Jesus obliges, but the pigs then run into the lake and drown.
* Exorcism of the Syrophoenician woman&#x27;s daughter (Matthew 15:21–28 and Mark 7:24–30)—A Gentile woman asks Jesus to heal her daughter, but Jesus refuses, saying that he has been sent only to &quot;the lost sheep of the house of Israel&quot;. The woman persists, saying that &quot;dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters&#x27; table&quot;. In response Jesus relents and informs her that her daughter has been healed.
* Exorcising the blind and mute man (, , and )—Jesus heals a possessed man who is blind and mute. People are astonished and ask, &quot;Could this be the Son of David?&quot;
* Exorcising a boy possessed by a demon (, , and )—A boy possessed by a demon is brought forward to Jesus. The boy is said to have foamed at the mouth, gnashed his teeth, become rigid, and involuntarily fallen into both water and fire. Jesus&#x27;s followers could not expel the demon, and Jesus condemns the people as unbelieving, but when the father of the boy questions if Jesus could heal the boy, he replies &quot;everything is possible for those that believe&quot;. The father then says that he believes and the child is healed.
* Jesus exorcising at sunset (, , and )—This miracle appears in the Synoptic Gospels just after Jesus heals Simon Peter&#x27;s mother-in-law. In this miracle, Jesus heals people and casts out demons.
* Jesus exorcising a mute ()—This miracle immediately follows the account of Jesus healing two blind men. A man who is possessed and can not talk is brought to Jesus, who casts out the demon. The man is then able to speak.

There are also brief mentions of other exorcisms, such as the following:
* Jesus casts seven devils out of Mary Magdalene. (, )
* Jesus continues to cast out devils even though Herod Antipas wants to kill him. ()

===Resurrection of the dead===

All four canonical gospels describe the resurrection of Jesus; three of them also relate a separate occasion on which Jesus calls a dead person back to life:
* Daughter of Jairus. Jairus, a major patron of a synagogue, asks Jesus to heal his daughter, but while Jesus is on the way, Jairus is told his daughter has died. Jesus tells him she was only sleeping and wakes her with the words Talitha kum!
* The Young Man from Nain. A young man, the son of a widow, is brought out for burial in Nain. Jesus sees her, and his pity causes him to tell her not to cry. Jesus approaches the coffin and tells the man inside to get up, and he does so.
* The Raising of Lazarus. A close friend of Jesus who had been dead for four days is brought back to life when Jesus commands him to get up.

=== Harmony with nature ===

The Gospels include eight pre-resurrection accounts concerning Jesus&#x27;s power over nature:
* Turning water into wine at a wedding, when the host runs out of wine, the host&#x27;s servants fill vessels with water at Jesus&#x27;s command, then a sample is drawn out and taken to the master of the banquet who pronounces the content of the vessels as the best wine of the banquet.
* The miraculous catch of fish takes place early in Jesus&#x27;s ministry and results in Saint Peter, Saint Andrew, James, son of Zebedee, and John the Apostle joining Jesus as his apostles.
* Walking on waterJesus walks on water.
* Calming the stormduring a storm, the disciples woke Jesus, and he rebuked the storm causing it to become calm. Jesus then rebukes the disciples for lack of faith.
* Finding a coin in the fish&#x27;s mouth is reported in Matthew 17:24–27.
* Cursing the fig treeJesus cursed a fig tree, and it withered.

Post-resurrection miracles attributed to Jesus are also recorded in the Gospels:
* A miracle similar to the miraculous catch of fish, also called the catch of 153 fish to distinguish it from the account in Luke, is reported in the Gospel of John but takes place after the Resurrection of Jesus.

== List of miracles found outside the New Testament ==

=== The Book of Mormon ===
The Book of Mormon, one of the religious texts of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, records multiple miracles performed by Jesus. Sometime shortly after his Ascension, the Book of Mormon records that Jesus miraculously descends from heaven and greets a large group of people who immediately bow down to him. Jesus offers this invitation: &quot;Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world&quot; 3 Nephi 11:8–17&quot;.&quot;

In addition to descending from heaven, other miracles of Jesus found in the Book of Mormon include the following:

* Healing the &quot;lame, or blind, or halt, or maimed, or leprous, or that are withered, or that are deaf, or that are afflicted in any manner&quot;3 Nephi 17:7–10.
* Providing bread and wine as emblems of his sacrifice and death to the multitude when neither had been brought 3 Nephi 20:3–7.
* Changing the nature of three of his called twelve disciples in the Book of Mormon so that they could live until his Second Coming and the other nine that they would live until the age of 72 and be taken &quot;up to his kingdom&quot; 3 Nephi 28:1–23.

=== Infancy Gospels ===
Accounts of Jesus performing miracles are also found outside the New Testament. Later, 2nd century texts, called Infancy Gospels, narrate Jesus performing miracles during his childhood.

Miracles performed by Jesus are mentioned in two sections of the Quran (suras 3:49 and 5:110) in broad strokes with little detail or comment.

== Setting and interpretations ==

===Cultural background===
Miracles were widely believed in around the time of Jesus. Gods and demigods such as Heracles (better known by his Roman name, Hercules), Asclepius (a Greek physician who became a god) and Isis of Egypt all were thought to have healed the sick and overcome death (i.e., to have raised people from the dead). Some thought that mortal men, if sufficiently famous and virtuous, could do likewise; there were myths about philosophers like Pythagoras and Empedocles calming storms at sea, chasing away pestilences, and being greeted as gods, and similarly some Jews believed that Elisha the Prophet had cured lepers and restored the dead. The achievements of the 1st century Apollonius of Tyana, though occurring after Jesus&#x27;s life, were used by a 3rd-century opponent of the Christians to argue that Christ was neither original nor divine (Eusebius of Caesaria argued against the charge).

The first Gospels were written against this background of Hellenistic and Jewish belief in miracles and other wondrous acts as signs—the term is explicitly used in the Gospel of John to describe Jesus&#x27;s miracles—seen to be validating the credentials of divine wise men.

===Traditional Christian interpretation===
Many Christians believe Jesus&#x27;s miracles were historical events and that his miraculous works were an important part of his life, attesting to his divinity and the Hypostatic union, i.e., the dual natures of Jesus as God and Man. They see Jesus&#x27;s experiences of hunger, weariness, and death as evidences of his humanity, and miracles as evidences of his divinity.

Christian authors also view the miracles of Jesus not merely as acts of power and omnipotence, but as works of love and mercy, performed not with a view to awe by omnipotence, but to show compassion for sinful and suffering humanity. And each miracle involves specific teachings.

Since according to the Gospel of John, it was impossible to narrate all of the miracles performed by Jesus, the Catholic Encyclopedia states that the miracles presented in the Gospels were selected for a twofold reason: first for the manifestation of God&#x27;s glory, and then for their evidential value. Jesus referred to his &quot;works&quot; as evidences of his mission and his divinity, and in he declared that his miracles have greater evidential value than the testimony of John the Baptist. quotes Jesus as follows:

Do not believe me unless I do what my Father does. But if I do it, even though you do not believe me, believe the miracles, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.

In Christian teachings, the miracles were as much a vehicle for Jesus&#x27;s message as his words. Many emphasize the importance of faith, for instance in cleansing ten lepers, Jesus did not say: &quot;My power has saved you,&quot; but said:

Rise and go; your faith has saved you.

Similarly, in the miracle of walking on water, Apostle Peter learns an important lesson about faith in that as his faith wavers, he begins to sink. 

Christian authors have discussed the miracles of Jesus at length and assigned specific motives to each miracle. For example, authors Pentecost and Danilson suggest that the miracle of walking on water centered on the relationship of Jesus with his apostles rather than their peril or the miracle itself. In their view, the miracle was specifically designed by Jesus to teach the apostles that when encountering obstacles, they need to rely on their faith in Christ, first and foremost.

Authors Donahue and Harrington argue that the healing of Jairus&#x27;s daughter teaches that faith, as embodied in the bleeding woman, can exist in seemingly hopeless situations and that through belief, healing can be achieved, in that when the woman is healed, Jesus tells her, &quot;Your faith has healed you&quot;.

===Liberal Christianity===
Liberal Christians place less emphasis on miraculous events associated with the life of Jesus than on his teachings. The effort to remove superstitious elements from Christian faith dates to intellectual reformist Christians such as Erasmus and the Deists in the 15th–17th centuries. In the 19th century, self-identified liberal Christians sought to elevate Jesus&#x27;s humane teachings as a standard for a world civilization freed from cultic traditions and traces of pagan belief in the supernatural. The debate over whether a belief in miracles was mere superstition or essential to accepting the divinity of Christ constituted a crisis within the 19th-century church, for which theological compromises were sought.

Attempts to account for miracles through scientific or rational explanation were mocked even at the turn of the 19th–20th century. A belief in the authenticity of miracles was one of five tests established in 1910 by the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America to distinguish true believers from what they saw as false professors of faith such as &quot;educated, &#x27;liberal&#x27; Christians.&quot;

Contemporary liberal Christians may prefer to read Jesus&#x27;s miracles as metaphorical narratives for understanding the power of God. Not all theologians with liberal inclinations reject the possibility of miracles, but may reject the polemicism that denial or affirmation entails.

Among other changes, Thomas Jefferson excised all the miracles of Jesus from his &quot;Jefferson Bible&quot;.

===Nonreligious views===
The Scottish philosopher David Hume published an influential essay on miracles in his &quot;An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding&quot; (1748) in which he argued that any evidence for miracles was outweighed by the possibility that those who described them were deceiving themselves or others:

As the violations of truth are more common in the testimony concerning religious miracles, than in that concerning any other matter of fact; this must diminish very much the authority of the former testimony, and make us form a general resolution, never to lend any attention to it, with whatever specious pretence it may be covered.

Historian Will Durant attributes Jesus&#x27;s miracles to &quot;the natural result of suggestion—of the influence of a strong and confident spirit upon impressionable souls; similar phenomena may be observed any week at Lourdes&quot;.

People thought Jesus was a liar, a fake, and lying about the kingdom of God. He is the son of God because of the miracles he performed. During a wedding, the servers ran out of wine and didn&#x27;t know what to do. Jesus asked them to fill 6 large tubes with water. They were confused about what he was going to do with them but didn&#x27;t ask any questions. When they came back with the water Jesus he poured a glass of water in a cup. Or was it water? He handed it to one of the questions and he drank from it. It was turned into wine. This Miracle will be known as Changing the Water to wine. 

Russian skeptic Kirill Eskov in his &quot;Nature&quot;-praised work &quot;The Gospel of Afranius&quot; argues that it was politically prudent for the local Roman administration to strengthen Jesus&#x27;s influence by spreading rumours about his miracles via active measures and eventually even staging the resurrection itself.

===Scholarly views===
Scholars are divided on the interpretation of miracles; some rule them out a priori, while others defend their possibility or reality. There is a consensus that the Historical Jesus was viewed as a miracle-worker during his lifetime. New Testament scholar Bart Ehrman argues that though some historians believe that miracles have happened and others do not, due to the limitations of the sources, it is not possible for historians to affirm or deny them. He states &quot;This is not a problem for only one kind of historian—for atheists or agnostics or Buddhists or Roman Catholics or Baptists or Jews or Muslims; it is a problem for all historians of every stripe.&quot; According to Michael Licona, among general historians there are some postmodern views of historiography that are open to the investigation of miracles.

According to the Jesus Seminar, Jesus probably cured some sick people, but described Jesus&#x27;s healings in modern terms, relating them to &quot;psychosomatic maladies.&quot; They found six of the nineteen healings to be &quot;probably reliable&quot;. Most participants in the Jesus Seminar believe Jesus practiced exorcisms, as Josephus, Philostratus and others wrote about other contemporary exorcists, but do not believe the gospel accounts were accurate reports of specific events or that demons exist. They did not find any of the nature miracles to be historical events.

According to scholar Maurice Casey, it is fair to assume that Jesus was able to cure people affected with psychosomatic disorders, although he believes that the healings were likely due to naturalistic causes and placebo effects. John P. Meier believes that Jesus as healer is as well supported as almost anything about the historical Jesus. In the Gospels, the activity of Jesus as miracle worker looms large in attracting attention to himself and reinforces his eschatological message. Such activity, Meier suggests, might have added to the concern of authorities that culminated in Jesus&#x27;s death. E.P. Sanders and Géza Vermes also agree that Jesus was indeed a healer and that this helped increase his following among the people of his time.

<text>A board of estimate is a governing body, particularly in the United States.

Typically, the board&#x27;s membership will consist of a combination of elected officials from the executive branch (e.g., the mayor or county executive) and the legislative branch (called the city council or, in some localities, the board of supervisors), and its powers are usually concentrated in such areas as taxation and debt management.

In Minneapolis, the Minneapolis Board of Estimate and Taxation is a &quot;council of government&quot; form of government, where elected officials from other Boards sit to make policy that affects all the Boards. In this case, the Minneapolis Board of Estimate has the Mayor, the City Council, independent Park Board Members, and independently elected persons on the Board of Estimate and Taxation. It primarily makes tax and debt policy for both the City and the Park Board organizations.

Baltimore has a Board of Estimates. The Baltimore City Board of Estimates consists of five voting members: The Mayor, the President of the City Council, the Comptroller, the City Solicitor, and the Director of Public Works. The President of the City Council serves as President of the Board of Estimates, and the City Comptroller serves as Secretary to the Board. Similar to Minneapolis, it sets fiscal policy for the City by sharing power among different elected individuals.

Middleton, New York has a Board of Estimate which is made up of the Mayor, the President of the Common Council and the Chair of the Finance Committee. They oversee the finances of the City, including purchasing, contracts, debt management, setting salaries and other similar financial duties. 

Mount Vernon, New York has a Board of Estimate and Contracts, made up of the Mayor, Comptroller and City Council President, which oversees the City&#x27;s finances. 

New York City had a Board of Estimate but it was found to be unconstitutional in 1989 because each borough had one vote, making Brooklyn&#x27;s vote equal to that of Staten Island, which was found to violate the 14th Amendment.

<text>Anthocharis cardamines, the orange tip, is a butterfly in the family Pieridae, which contains about 1,100 species. &quot;A. cardamines&quot; is mainly found throughout Europe and temperate Asia (Palearctic) The males feature wings with a signature orange pigmentation, which is the origin of &quot;A. cardamines&quot;&#x27; common name.

Males and females of this species occupy different habitats: males mostly frequent the edges of forests whereas females frequent meadows. &quot;A. cardamines&quot; feeds on most plants found within its habitat but the females selectively oviposit on young inflorescence of crucifers.

Mating is usually controlled by females as virgin females found in flight are always pursued by males immediately. Females can signal different meanings to the approaching males by using their abdomen. There is evidence that mated females have an anti-aphrodisiac and that their usage of the abdomen has a closely related function in presenting these pheromones to males.

This species has been affected by changing temperatures, and its first appearance has shifted forward 17.3 days in the Spring.

==Description==
The common name derives from the bright orange tips of the male&#x27;s forewings. The males are a common sight in spring, flying along hedgerows and damp meadows in search of the more reclusive female which lacks the orange and is often mistaken for other species of butterfly. The undersides are mottled green and white and create a superb camouflage when settled on flowerheads such as cow parsley and garlic mustard (&quot;Alliaria petiolata&quot;).

Males display a variation in body size, which is attributed to their host plant. Males reared on &quot;C. pratensis&quot; become the smaller of the two variants, and those reared on &quot;A. petiolata&quot; become the larger.
==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;A. cardamines&quot; can be found throughout Europe and across the Palearctic to China.

The habitats of males and females differ significantly. Males are restricted to edges and clearings of forests for their entire lives. On rare occurrences, males will leave forest edges and enter meadows, but this is only to cross and reach another forest edge. They prefer to fly in bright sunlight and avoid areas of shade in the forest. Females are mainly found in open meadows and dry hillocks for a majority of their lives. Females only spend short period of time in forests before re-entering nearby meadows. 
In Armenia the species inhabits not only forests and woodlands, but also meadows, where males occur together with females.

==Food resources==
* &quot;Lathyrus montanus&quot; 
* &quot;Viola canina&quot;
* &quot;Viola riviniana&quot;
* &quot;Geranium robertianum&quot;
* &quot;Viola tricolor&quot; 
* &quot;Capsella bursa-pastoris&quot;
* &quot;Lychnis flos-cuculi&quot;
Female &quot;A. cardamines&quot; feed on the flowers listed above, in addition to all species of flowers located in the habitats where their host plants are found. They do not interrupt host plant search to find foraging habitats; instead, they visit available flowers in host plant habitats.

==Parental care==
===Oviposition===
Females will tend to only deposit eggs on crucifers if they are in bloom. Furthermore, they prefer to oviposit on young inflorescences, and there have been instances of &quot;A. cardamines&quot; that refuse to deposit eggs on inflorescences that had aged. If the stem of the inflorescence is not strong enough to support the weight of the female &quot;A. cardamines&quot;, they will cease egg laying.

===Egg guarding===
Initially, it was believed that the bright orange color of &quot;A. cardamines&quot; egg deterred further egg laying. However, new studies have discovered another deterrent. To prevent other females from laying eggs on the same flowerhead, female &quot;A. cardamines&quot; will deposit a pheromone during egg laying. This pheromone will deter other females from also laying an egg on that flower head. Flower heads with more than one egg can still be found because the pheromone is water-soluble and relatively short-lived.

===Host plant learning and selection===
When choosing host plants, female &quot;A. cardamines&quot; only lay eggs on host plants growing in the sun. Those in the shade are completely avoided, and plants partially covered in shade are only selected if the female does not have to travel through shaded areas to reach the plant. Females are extremely selective for host plant size, and larger flower heads are preferred to smaller ones. Even when smaller flower heads are overly abundant, female &quot;A. cardamines&quot; will completely ignore them in search of larger flower heads. Females will also ignore flower heads already containing a conspecific egg. This is because larva from the already laid eggs will hatch first and cannibalize any other present eggs.

==Life history==
=== Life cycle ===
==== Egg ====
Eggs of &quot;A. cardamines&quot; are always deposited on inflorescences of crucifers. When first laid, eggs are white in colour and eventually change to orange and then brown after a few days. Eggs are covered with a pheromone that deters other females from ovipositing on the same crucifer.

====Larva====
When hatched, the larva consumes its egg shell before eating the seed pods of its host plant. The fully grown larva leaves the food plant after its five larval instars and pupates on lower vegetation. If more than one egg had been laid on the same host plant, then the larva to first hatch will cannibalize its sibling. This is the major reason why Orange tip females avoid eggs laying on the same crucifer.

====Pupa====
While the earlier stages of &quot;A. cardamines&quot; are easy to find since most individuals develop on a single plant, the pupa is very difficult to locate.

==Migration==
===Regional dispersal===
In Britain, there have been patterns found relating weather and &quot;A. cardamines&quot; appearances. From data collected from 1976 to 1998, spring and summer temperatures were found to have increased by approximately 1 degree Celsius. This has affected first appearance of &quot;A. cardamines&quot;, which has advanced by 17.3 days with the increasing temperature. The increased temperature has also been to connected to increases in duration of flight period of &quot;A.cardamines&quot; in Britain.

==Enemies==
===Predation===
Corpses of &quot;A. cardamines&quot; caterpillars are often found with darkening around a wound near the tail. These injuries are consistent with damage inflicted by spiders, which are their main predators.

The host plants of &quot;A. cardamines&quot; are often grazed by Muntjac deer. The deer favor plants with young flowers, which corresponds to the preferred plants of &quot;A. cardamines&quot; for egg laying. As a result, Muntjac deer are responsible for consuming up to nineteen percent of &quot;A. cardamines&quot; young through indirect predation.

==Mating==
===Courting===
The result of male courting depends heavily on the location of the female when courted. Females found in flight are immediately pursued by males, and the encounter almost always results in acceptance of the male mating attempt. When males encounter females already perched on vegetation, their mating attempts are usually met by a raised abdomen.

Both mated and virgin females respond to males with a raised abdomen, but the signals take different meanings. When a male encounters a mated female with a raised abdomen, it is taken as a signal of rejection, and he quickly leaves. When virgin females raise their abdomen, the signal takes on a male detention function instead of rejection. Males will continue to court a perched, virgin female with a raised abdomen until she acquiesces or flees.

===Pheromone===
While a specific pheromone has not been identified in &quot;A. cardamines&quot;, since both the rejection signal and detention signal in females are visually identical scientists hypothesize that a chemical signal distinguish the two. Mated females tend to track the males with their abdomens during the courting attempt, and this is behavioral evidence that mated females have an anti-aphrodisiac, and that the raised abdomen presents the pheromone as close as possible to the male. 

==Subspecies==
* &quot; A. c. cardamines&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – In the male of the name-typical cardamines the orange-red apical patch does not reach much further than to the black discocellular spot, the rest of the upperside being white with the exception of the narrowly lack apical margin, the proximal area of the forewing beneath and the underside of the hindwing being likewise white, the latter with greenish (&quot;parsley&quot;) markings, which are rather variable in extent. In the female the orange-red apical patch is wanting, but the black apical marking is much wider and the black discocellular spot larger, otherwise the female similar to the male.
* &quot;A. c. meridionalis&quot; (Verity, 1908)
* &quot;A. c. phoenissa&quot; (Kalchberg 1805)
* &quot;A. c. alexandra&quot; (Hemming, 1933) – Found in the mountain ridges of Northern Tian-Shan at elevations of 1200–2700 m. Flight period is April–July.
* &quot;A. c. isshikii&quot; – Distinct spot found both in pupae and adults and found in Japan.

<text>Anthocharis belia, the Moroccan orange tip, is a butterfly of the family Pieridae. It is found in northwestern Africa (specifically Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia). The length of the forewings is .

==Description in Seitz==
&quot;A. eupheno&quot; L. (synonym of &quot;Anthocharis belia&quot;) from North Africa, is above very similar to &quot;Anthocharis damone&quot; but the orange patch is smaller and proximally more strongly edged with dark, the black median spot disappearing in the dark edge of the orange spot; however, the underside of the hindwing lighter yellow and differently marked. The female is without the orange patch, having reddish yellow only in the apical area. — &quot;androgyne&quot; Leech, from Morocco, differs only in the female in the stronger development of the reddish yellow apical spot. Larva green, with yellow and black dorsal markings, very similar to that of &quot;A. euphenoides&quot;, on &quot;Biscutella&quot; (Spuler).

==Biology==
The larvae feed on &quot;Biscutella laevigata&quot; and &quot;Sisymbrium officinale&quot; in the wild, and have been reared on &quot;Alyssum&quot; in captivity. In Morocco, subspecies &quot;A.b. androgyne&quot; (with male-like females) is one of several coexisting Euchloine species (including species of the genera &quot;Euchloe&quot;, &quot;Elphinstonia&quot; and &quot;Zegris&quot;). All of these species have larvae that may be cannibalistic. These species do not segregate by use of different host plants, but show some separation by use of different habitats. &quot;A. belia&quot; is most associated with relatively stable environments and the use of longer-lived hosts

<text>Joan Roberts (July 15, 1917 – August 13, 2012) was an American actress, most famous for creating the role of Laurey in the original Broadway production of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; in 1943.

==Early years==
Roberts was born Josephine Rose Seagrist in Manhattan, New York and was raised in Astoria, Queens. She first appeared on stage at age 6. She was active in dramatic productions as a student at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral (Manhattan) High School and gained additional experience in summer stock productions. She studied singing with Estelle Liebling, the teacher of Beverly Sills, in her youth.

==Career==
===Radio===
Roberts was a regular on &quot;The Texaco Summer Theater&quot; on CBS July 4 - December 5, 1943. The program was a summer replacement for &quot;The Fred Allen Show&quot; but was extended when Allen did not return as scheduled.

===Stage===
&quot;Sunny River&quot; was Roberts&#x27; first Broadway production. She played Madeleine Caresse December 4, 1941 - January 3, 1942. Later in 1942 she played in &quot;Hit the Deck&quot; with the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera.

Roberts initially auditioned for the role of Ado Annie in the original Broadway production of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; (which eventually went to Celeste Holm), but the show&#x27;s librettist Oscar Hammerstein cast her as the female lead, Laurey. At the time of her death she was one of four surviving cast members of the original 1943 opening night production of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; and the only one who played a principal role (Celeste Holm died several weeks earlier), along with George S. Irving, Marc Platt, and Bambi Linn. Roberts subsequently starred as Sara Longstreet on Broadway in the musical &quot;High Button Shoes&quot;.

In addition to her work as an actress, Roberts taught voice lessons and presented workshops on singing and voice projection. In 2011 the University of North Carolina&#x27;s School of the Arts mounted a production of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; that replicated the original Broadway staging of the show. Roberts and Celeste Holm both attended that production and were present at an event honoring the two actresses.

She was in retirement for many years on Long Island, New York, when she appeared as Heidi Schiller in the 2001 Broadway revival of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Follies&quot;. Over the years she was seen in documentaries about Oscar Hammerstein II, George Abbott and in the film &quot;&quot;.

===Television===
On December 19, 1966, Roberts appeared in a production of &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; on CBS-TV.

In 1977 on the Series &quot;Emergency!&quot; S6 E15 “Breakdown”, she made an appearance as Jane.

==Personal life==
Roberts was married to Dr. John J. Donlon, who died in 1965. They had a son, John J. Donlon, Jr.

==Death==
On August 13, 2012, Roberts died of congestive heart failure, aged 95, according to her son.

Celeste Holm, who played Ado Annie in the same original production of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, had died only a month before, also at age 95.

<doc id="911516" wikidata="Q1438438" url="?curid=911516" title="Rolling blackout">
<text>A rolling blackout, also referred to as rota or rotational load shedding, rota disconnection, feeder rotation, or a rotating outage, is an intentionally engineered electrical power shutdown in which electricity delivery is stopped for non-overlapping periods of time over different parts of the distribution region. Rolling blackouts are a last-resort measure used by an electric utility company to avoid a total blackout of the power system.

Rolling blackouts are a measure of demand response if the demand for electricity exceeds the power supply capability of the network. Rolling blackouts may be localised to a specific part of the electricity network, or they may be more widespread and affect entire countries and continents. Rolling blackouts generally result from two causes: insufficient generation capacity or inadequate transmission infrastructure to deliver power to where it is needed.

Rolling blackouts are also used as a response strategy to cope with reduced output beyond reserve capacity from power stations taken offline unexpectedly.

== In developing countries==
Rolling blackouts are a common or even a normal daily event in many developing countries, where electricity generation capacity is underfunded or infrastructure is poorly managed. In well managed under-capacity systems blackouts are planned and schedules are published in advance to allow people to work around them. In poorly managed systems they happen without warning, typically whenever the transmission frequency falls below the &#x27;safe&#x27; limit.

These have wide-ranging impacts, and can effect the expectations of communities. For example, in Ghana dumsor describes the widespread expectations for intermittent unexpected power outages due to rolling blackouts.

===Iran===
In 2021, Iran regularly conducted large blackouts nationwide.

In July 2024, the government started 4 hour per day blackouts affecting homes and industries despite 40 degrees Celsius heat waves, and the severity of power shortages exceeded worst case scenario predictions.

On 10 November 2024, the government began reimplementing blackouts nationally.

===Philippines===
Remote areas or off-grid areas are the most vulnerable to power supply issues. Areas placed with under yellow and red alerts are subject to rolling blackouts.

=== South Africa ===
Since 2007, South Africa has experienced multiple periods of rolling blackouts which are locally referred to as load shedding by the state-owned energy company Eskom. This was initially caused by the country&#x27;s demand for electricity outstripping supply, and as time progressed, later exacerbated by ageing power infrastructure, poor maintenance, and the slow completion of new power stations. It was recently revealed by Eskom&#x27;s former spokesperson Sikhonathi Mantshantsh, that widespread tender corruption and the sabotage of power infrastructure by employees is one of the primary reasons for continuing load shedding. This has caused severe damage to the South African economy and has played a large part in limiting the country&#x27;s economic growth.

=== Ukraine ===
In the late 1990s, Ukraine experienced frequent scheduled electricity blackouts throughout the country&#x27;s power system due to miners&#x27; strikes, the destruction of the coal industry in 1991–1996, the hidden privatization of energy companies and barters in the energy industry, which included even nuclear power.

During the Russian invasion in 2022, Russia conducted multiple attacks on Ukraine&#x27;s energy infrastructure. On 23 October 2022, rolling blackouts were introduced in Kyiv and its oblast. Rolling blackouts were introduced in all Ukrainian regions on 25 October 2022.

In 2024, Ukraine faced another unprecedented energy crisis due to Russia&#x27;s destruction of energy infrastructure, re-introducing rolling blackouts. Approximately 70% of the country&#x27;s heating infrastructure was either damaged or under occupation by May 2024.

=== Egypt ===
In the Summer of 2023, with the unprecedented heatwave that hit the country, the Egyptian government announced it would start a scheduled blackout across all major cities for 1 hour per day until the heatwave ended.
However, the blackouts remained well into the winter and were increased to 2 hours per day.
In the Summer of 2024, the temperatures rose even higher and the schedule changed to 3 hours per day with reports of unplanned cuts in Alexandria, Cairo and other cities where some places faced over 6 hours without electricity for 3 days.

== In developed countries ==
Rolling blackouts in developed countries sometimes occur due to economic forces at the expense of system reliability, or during natural disasters such as heat waves. 

===Japan===
After the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, the Tokyo Electric Power Company implemented rolling blackouts. Its service area was divided into five blocks and blackouts were implemented from 6:20 to 22:00. The schedule from 15 to 18 March 2011 was as follows:

===USA===
In California, rolling blackouts during 2000–01 California energy crisis occurred in June 2000, January, March and May 2001, and August 2020. The 2021 Texas power crisis involved rolling blackouts caused by the February 13–17, 2021 North American winter storm and lack of winterization. The Late December 2022 North American winter storm resulted in rolling blackouts in parts of the eastern US.

===Other===
* 2003 Italy blackout
* 2016 South Australian blackout

== Effects ==
Intermittent access to electricity causes major economic problems for businesses, which incur costs in the form of lost resources, reduced patronage, or curtailed production if electrical equipment—for example refrigeration, lighting, or machinery—abruptly stops working. Businesses in areas that are subject to regular blackouts may invest in backup power generation to avoid these costs, but power backup is itself a cost because generators must be purchased and maintained and fuel must be regularly replenished.

== Scheduling ==
When blackouts are scheduled in advance, they are easier to work around.

The speed at which blackouts roll may be adjusted so that no blackout lasts longer than a certain limit. For instance, in Italy, the PESSE (&quot;Piano di Emergenza per la Sicurezza del Sistema Electrico,&quot; Emergency plan for national grid safety) does not permit a controlled blackout longer than 90 minutes. In Canada, blackouts have been rolled so that no area had to spend more than one hour without power.

== Causes ==
In some countries, generating capacity is chronically below demand. Assorted factors may prevent adequate investment in generation. Alternately, generating capacity may temporarily decrease below demand due to power station outages or loss of renewable capacity due to the wind dropping or the sun shining less. Natural disasters can also abruptly reduce supply by damaging power plants. A lack of fuel makes some types of power plant useless. Industrial accidents and poor maintenance can also take generation capacity offline. Conflict can disrupt fuel supply, as well as damage or destroy generating and delivery infrastructure.

In electricity grids where power generators are paid a flexible market rate, power suppliers sometimes deliberately keep the generating capacity too low, or fake accidents that take capacity offline, to jack up prices.

Demand spikes can also cause blackouts. Unusually hot or cold weather can cause demand spikes. Independent system operators may introduce rolling blackouts in anticipation of demand spikes, based on often arbitrary minimum thresholds of electricity reserves.

In the case of South Africa, failing and aged infrastructure, lack of maintenance and alleged corruption in the country&#x27;s African National Congress-led government in the running of their primary electricity provider, Eskom, is the direct cause of rolling blackouts.

<text>Freedom of information is freedom of a person or people to publish and have access to information. Access to information is the ability for an individual to seek, receive and impart information effectively. As articulated by UNESCO, it encompasses 

&quot;scientific, indigenous, and traditional knowledge; freedom of information, building of open knowledge resources, including open Internet and open standards, and open access and availability of data; preservation of digital heritage; respect for cultural and linguistic diversity, such as fostering access to local content in accessible languages; quality education for all, including lifelong and e-learning; diffusion of new media and information literacy and skills, and social inclusion online, including addressing inequalities based on skills, education, gender, age, race, ethnicity, and accessibility by those with disabilities; and the development of connectivity and affordable ICTs, including mobile, the Internet, and broadband infrastructures&quot;.
Public access to government information, including through the open publication of information, and formal freedom of information laws, is widely considered an important basic component of democracy and integrity in government.

Michael Buckland defines six types of barriers that have to be overcome in order for access to information to be achieved: identification of the source, availability of the source, price of the user, cost to the provider, cognitive access, acceptability. While &quot;access to information&quot;, &quot;right to information&quot;, &quot;right to know&quot; and &quot;freedom of information&quot; are sometimes used as synonyms, the diverse terminology does highlight particular (albeit related) dimensions of the issue.

Freedom of information is related to freedom of expression, which can apply to any medium, be it oral, writing, print, electronic, or through art forms. This means that the protection of freedom of speech as a right includes not only the content, but also the means of expression. Freedom of information is a separate concept which sometimes comes into conflict with the right to privacy in the content of the Internet and information technology. As with the right to freedom of expression, the right to privacy is a recognized human right and freedom of information acts as an extension to this right. The government of the United Kingdom has theorised it as being an extension of freedom of speech, and a fundamental human right. It is recognized in international law. The international and United States Pirate Party have established political platforms based largely on freedom of information issues.

== Overview ==
There has been a significant increase in global access to the Internet, which reached just over 5.35 billion users in 2024, amounting to about 66 per cent of the world&#x27;s population. But the digital divide continues to exclude over half of the world&#x27;s population, particularly women and girls, and especially in Africa and the least developed countries as well as several Small Island Developing States. Further, individuals with disabilities can either be advantaged or further disadvantaged by the design of technologies or through the presence or absence of training and education.

== Context ==
===The Digital Divide===

Access to information faces great difficulties because of the global digital divide. A digital divide is an economic and social inequality with regard to access to, use of, or impact of information and communication technologies (ICT). The divide within countries (such as the digital divide in the United States) may refer to inequalities between individuals, households, businesses, or geographic areas, usually at different socioeconomic levels or other demographic categories. The divide between differing countries or regions of the world is referred to as the global digital divide, examining this technological gap between developing and developed countries on an international scale.

==== Racial divide ====
Although many groups in society are affected by a lack of access to computers or the internet, communities of color are specifically observed to be negatively affected by the digital divide. This is evident when it comes to observing home-internet access among different races and ethnicities. 81% of Whites and 83% of Asians have home internet access, compared to 70% of Hispanics, 68% of Blacks, 72% of American Indian/Alaska Natives, and 68% of Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders. Although income is a factor in home-internet access disparities, there are still racial and ethnic inequalities that are present among those within lower income groups. 58% of low income Whites are reported to have home-internet access in comparison to 51% of Hispanics and 50% of Blacks. This information is reported in a report titled &quot;Digital Denied: The Impact of Systemic Racial Discrimination on Home-Internet Adoption&quot; which was published by the DC-based public interest group Fress Press. The report concludes that structural barriers and discrimination that perpetuates bias against people of different races and ethnicities contribute to having an impact on the digital divide. The report also concludes that those who do not have internet access still have a high demand for it, and reduction in the price of home-internet access would allow for an increase in equitable participation and improve internet adoption by marginalized groups.

Digital censorship and algorithmic bias are observed to be present in the racial divide. Hate-speech rules as well as hate speech algorithms online platforms such as Facebook have favored white males and those belonging to elite groups in society over marginalized groups in society, such as women and people of color. In a collection of internal documents that were collected in a project conducted by ProPublica, Facebook&#x27;s guidelines in regards to distinguishing hate speech and recognizing protected groups revealed slides that identified three groups, each one containing either female drivers, black children, or white men. When the question of which subset group is protected is presented, the correct answer was white men. Minority group language is negatively impacted by automated tools of hate detection due to human bias that ultimately decides what is considered hate speech and what is not.

Online platforms have also been observed to tolerate hateful content towards people of color but restrict content from people of color. Aboriginal memes on a Facebook page were posted with racially abusive content and comments depicting Aboriginal people as inferior. While the contents on the page were removed by the originators after an investigation conducted by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, Facebook did not delete the page and has allowed it to remain under the classification of controversial humor. However, a post by an African American woman addressing her discomfort with being the only person of color in a small-town restaurant was met with racist and hateful messages. When reporting the online abuse to Facebook, her account was suspended by Facebook for three days for posting the screenshots while those responsible for the racist comments she received were not suspended. Shared experiences between people of color can be at risk of being silenced under removal policies for online platforms.

==== Disability divide ====
Inequities in access to information technologies are present among individuals living with a disability in comparison to those who are not living with a disability. According to The Pew Internet 54% of households with a person who has a disability have home internet access compared to 81% of households that have home internet access and do not have a person who has a disability. The type of disability an individual has can prevent one from interacting with computer screens and smartphone screens, such as having a quadriplegia disability or having a disability in the hands. However, there is still a lack of access to technology and home internet access among those who have a cognitive and auditory disability as well. There is a concern of whether or not the increase in the use of information technologies will increase equality through offering opportunities for individuals living with disabilities or whether it will only add to the present inequalities and lead to individuals living with disabilities being left behind in society. Issues such as the perception of disabilities in society, Federal and state government policy, corporate policy, mainstream computing technologies, and real-time online communication have been found to contribute to the impact of the digital divide on individuals with disabilities.

People with disabilities are also the targets of online abuse. Online disability hate crimes have increased by 33% within the past year across the UK according to a report published by Leonard Cheshire.org. Accounts of online hate abuse towards people with disabilities were shared during an incident in 2019 when model Katie Price&#x27;s son was the target of online abuse that was attributed to him having a disability. In response to the abuse, a campaign was launched by Katie Price to ensure that Britain&#x27;s MP&#x27;s held those who are guilty of perpetuating online abuse towards those with disabilities accountable. Online abuse towards individuals with disabilities is a factor that can discourage people from engaging online which could prevent people from learning information that could improve their lives. Many individuals living with disabilities face online abuse in the form of accusations of benefit fraud and &quot;faking&quot; their disability for financial gain, which in some cases leads to unnecessary investigations.

===Gender divide===
Women&#x27;s freedom of information and access to information globally is less than men&#x27;s. Social barriers such as illiteracy and lack of digital empowerment have created stark inequalities in navigating the tools used for access to information, often exacerbating lack of awareness of issues that directly relate to women and gender, such as sexual health. There have also been examples of more extreme measures, such as local community authorities banning or restricting mobile phone use for girls and unmarried women in their communities. According to the Wharton School of Public Policy, the expansion of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has resulted in multiple disparities that have had an impact on women&#x27;s access to ICT with the gender gap being as high as 31% in some developing countries and 12% globally in 2016. Socioeconomic barriers that result from these disparities are known as what we call the digital divide. Among low-income countries and low-income regions alike, the high price of internet access presents a barrier to women since women are generally paid less and face an unequal dividend between paid and unpaid work. Cultural norms in certain countries may prohibit women from access to the internet and technology as well by preventing women from attaining a certain level of education or from being the breadwinners in their households, thus resulting in a lack of control in the household finances. However, even when women have access to ICT, the digital divide is still prevalent.

===LGBTQIA divide, and repression by states and tech companies===
A number of states, including some that have introduced new laws since 2010, notably censor voices from and content related to the LGBTQI community, posing serious consequences to access to information about sexual orientation and gender identity. Digital platforms play a powerful role in limiting access to certain content, such as YouTube&#x27;s 2017 decision to classify non-explicit videos with LGBTQIA themes as &#x27;restricted&#x27;, a classification designed to filter out &quot;potentially inappropriate content&quot;. The internet provides information that can create a safe space for marginalized groups such as the LGBTQIA community to connect with others and engage in honest dialogues and conversations that are affecting their communities. It can also be viewed as an agent of change for the LGBTQIA community and provide a means of engaging in social justice. It can allow for LGBTQIA individuals who may be living in rural areas or in areas where they are isolated to gain access to information that are not within their rural system as well as gaining information from other LGBT individuals. This includes information such as healthcare, partners, and news. Gay Health provides online medical and health information and Gay and Lesbians Alliance Against Defamation contains online publications and news that focus on human rights campaigns and issues focused on LGBTQIA issues. The Internet also allows LGBTQIA individuals to maintain anonymity. Lack of access to the internet can hinder these things, due to lack of broadband access in remote rural areas. LGBT Tech has emphasized launching newer technologies with 5G technology in order to help close the digital divide that can cause members of the LGBTQIA community to lose access to reliable and fast technology that can provide information on healthcare, economic opportunities, and safe communities.

There are also other factors that can prevent LGBTQIA members from accessing information online or subject them to having their information abused. Internet filters are also used to censor and restrict LGBTQIA content that is in relation to the LGBTQIA community in public schools and libraries. There is also the presence of online abuse by online predators that target LGBTQIA members by seeking out their personal information and providing them with inaccurate information. The use of the internet can provide a way for LGBTQIA individuals to gain access to information to deal with societal setbacks through therapeutic advice, social support systems, and an online environment that fosters a collaboration of ideas, concerns, and helps LGBTQIA individuals move forward. This can be fostered through human service professionals who can utilize the internet with evidence and evaluation to provide information to LGBTQIA individuals who are dealing with the circumstances of coming out and the possible repercussions that could follow as a result.

=== The security argument ===
With the evolution of the digital age, application of freedom of speech and its corollaries (freedom of information, access to information) becomes more controversial as new means of communication and restrictions arise including government control or commercial methods putting personal information to danger.

==Digital access==
Freedom of information (or information freedom) also refers to the protection of the right to freedom of expression with regard to the Internet and information technology. Freedom of information may also concern censorship in an information technology context, i.e. the ability to access Web content, without censorship or restrictions.

===Information and media literacy===
According to Kuzmin and Parshakova, access to information entails learning in formal and informal education settings. It also entails fostering the competencies of information and media literacy that enable users to be empowered and make full use of access to the Internet.

The UNESCO&#x27;s support for journalism education is an example of how UNESCO seeks to contribute to the provision of independent and verifiable information accessible in cyberspace. Promoting access for disabled persons has been strengthened by the UNESCO-convened conference in 2014, which adopted the &quot;New Delhi Declaration on Inclusive ICTs for Persons with Disabilities: Making Empowerment a Reality&quot;.

===Open standards===
According to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), &quot;Open Standards&quot; are standards made available to the general public and developed (or approved) and maintained via a collaborative and consensus driven process. &quot;Open Standards&quot; facilitate interoperability and data exchange among different products or services and are intended for widespread adoption.&quot; A UNESCO study considers that adopting open standards has the potential to contribute to the vision of a ‘digital commons’ in which citizens can freely find, share, and re-use information. Promoting Free and open-source software, which is both free of cost and freely modifiable could help meet the particular needs of marginalized users advocacy on behalf of minority groups, such as targeted outreach, better provision of Internet access, tax incentives for private companies and organizations working to enhance access, and solving underlying issues of social and economic inequalities

=== The Information Society and freedom of expression ===
The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) Declaration of Principles adopted in 2003 reaffirms democracy and the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Declaration also makes specific reference to the importance of the right to freedom of expression for the &quot;Information Society&quot; in stating:
We reaffirm, as an essential foundation of the Information Society, and as outlined in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; that this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. Communication is a fundamental social process, a basic human need and the foundation of all social organisation. It is central to the Information Society. Everyone, everywhere should have the opportunity to participate and no one should be excluded from the benefits the Information Society offers.
The 2004 WSIS Declaration of Principles also acknowledged that &quot;it is necessary to prevent the use of information resources and technologies for criminal and terrorist purposes, while respecting human rights&quot;. Wolfgang Benedek comments that the WSIS Declaration only contains a number of references to human rights and does not spell out any procedures or mechanism to assure that human rights are considered in practice.

=== Hacktivismo ===

The digital rights group Hacktivismo, founded in 1999, argues that access to information is a basic human right. The group&#x27;s beliefs are described fully in the &quot;Hacktivismo Declaration&quot; which calls for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) to be applied to the Internet. The Declaration recalls the duty of member states to the ICCPR to protect the right to freedom of expression with regard to the internet and in this context freedom of information. The Hacktivismo Declaration recognizes &quot;the importance to fight against human rights abuses with respect to reasonable access to information on the Internet&quot; and calls upon the hacker community to &quot;study ways and means of circumventing state sponsored censorship of the internet&quot; and &quot;implement technologies to challenge information rights violations&quot;. The Hacktivismo Declaration does, however, recognise that the right to freedom of expression is subject to limitations, stating &quot;we recognized the right of governments to forbid the publication of properly categorized state secrets, child pornography, and matters related to personal privacy and privilege, among other accepted restrictions.&quot; However, the Hacktivist Declaration states &quot;but we oppose the use of state power to control access to the works of critics, intellectuals, artists, or religious figures.&quot;

=== Global Network Initiative ===
On October 29, 2008, the Global Network Initiative (GNI) was founded upon its &quot;Principles on Freedom of Expression and Privacy&quot;. The Initiative was launched in the 60th Anniversary year of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and is based on internationally recognized laws and standards for human rights on freedom of expression and privacy set out in the UDHR, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). Participants in the Initiative include the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Human Rights Watch, Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, other major companies, human rights NGOs, investors, and academics.

According to reports, Cisco Systems was invited to the initial discussions but did not take part in the initiative. Harrington Investments, which proposed that Cisco establish a human rights board, has dismissed the GNI as a voluntary code of conduct not having any impact. Chief executive John Harrington called the GNI &quot;meaningless noise&quot; and instead calls for bylaws to be introduced that force boards of directors to accept human rights responsibilities.

=== Internet censorship ===
Jo Glanville, editor of the Index on Censorship, states that &quot;the internet has been a revolution for censorship as much as for free speech&quot;. The concept of freedom of information has emerged in response to state sponsored censorship, monitoring and surveillance of the internet. Internet censorship includes the control or suppression of the publishing or accessing of information on the Internet.
According to the Reporters without Borders (RSF) &quot;internet enemy list&quot; the following states engage in pervasive internet censorship: Cuba, Iran, Maldives, Myanmar/Burma, North Korea, Syria, Tunisia, Uzbekistan and Vietnam. A widely publicised example is the so-called &quot;Great Firewall of China&quot; (in reference both to its role as a network firewall and to the ancient Great Wall of China). The system blocks content by preventing IP addresses from being routed through and consists of standard firewall and proxy servers at the Internet gateways. The system also selectively engages in DNS poisoning when particular sites are requested. The government does not appear to be systematically examining Internet content, as this appears to be technically impractical. Internet censorship in the People&#x27;s Republic of China is conducted under a wide variety of laws and administrative regulations. In accordance with these laws, more than sixty Internet regulations have been made by the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) government, and censorship systems are vigorously implemented by provincial branches of state-owned ISPs, business companies, and organizations.

In 2010, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, speaking on behalf of the United States, declared &#x27;we stand for a single internet where all of humanity has equal access to knowledge and ideas&#x27;. In her &#x27;Remarks on Internet Freedom&#x27; she also draws attention to how &#x27;even in authoritarian countries, information networks are helping people discover new facts and making governments more accountable&#x27;, while reporting President Barack Obama&#x27;s pronouncement &#x27;the more freely information flows, the stronger societies become&#x27;.

== Privacy protections ==
=== Privacy, surveillance and encryption ===
The increasing access to and reliance on digital media to receive and produce information have increased the possibilities for States and private sector companies to track individuals’ behaviors, opinions and networks. States have increasingly adopted laws and policies to legalize monitoring of communication, justifying these practices with the need to defend their own citizens and national interests. In parts of Europe, new anti-terrorism laws have enabled a greater degree of government surveillance and an increase in the ability of intelligence authorities to access citizens’ data. While legality is a precondition for legitimate limitations of human rights, the issue is also whether a given law is aligned to other criteria for justification such as necessity, proportionality and legitimate purpose.

==== International framework ====
The United Nations Human Rights Council has taken a number of steps to highlight the importance of the universal right to privacy online. In 2015, in a resolution on the right to privacy in the digital age, it established a United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Privacy. In 2017, the Human Rights Council emphasized that the ‘unlawful or arbitrary surveillance and/ or interception of communications, as well as the unlawful or arbitrary collection of personal data, as highly intrusive acts, violate the right to privacy, can interfere with other human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference’.

==== Regional framework ====
Number of regional efforts, particularly through the courts, to establish regulations that deal with data protection, privacy and surveillance, and which affect their relationship to journalistic uses. The Council of Europe’s Convention 108, the Convention for the protection of individuals with regard to automatic processing of personal data, has undergone a modernization process to address new challenges to privacy. Since 2012, four new countries belonging to the Council of Europe have signed or ratified the Convention, as well as three countries that do not belong to the Council, from Africa and Latin America.

Regional courts are also playing a noteworthy role in the development of online privacy regulations. In 2015 the European Court of Justice found that the so-called ‘Safe Harbour Agreement’, which allowed private companies to ‘legally transmit personal data from their European subscribers to the US’, was not valid under European law in that it did not offer sufficient protections for the data of European citizens or protect them from arbitrary surveillance. In 2016, the European Commission and United States Government reached an agreement to replace Safe Harbour, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, which includes data protection obligations on companies receiving personal data from the European Union, safeguards on United States government access to data, protection and redress for individuals, and an annual joint review to monitor implementation.

The European Court of Justice&#x27;s 2014 decision in the Google Spain case allowed people to claim a &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; or &quot;right to be de-listed&quot; in a much-debated approach to the balance between privacy, free expression and transparency. Following the Google Spain decision the &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; or &quot;right to be de-listed&quot; has been recognized in a number of countries across the world, particularly in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Recital 153 of the European Union General Data Protection Regulation states &quot;Member States law should reconcile the rules governing freedom of expression and information, including journalistic...with the right to the protection of personal data pursuant to this Regulation. The processing of personal data solely for journalistic purposes...should be subject to derogations or exemptions from certain provisions of this Regulation if necessary to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with the right to freedom of expression and information, as enshrined in Article 11 of the Charter.&quot;

==== National framework ====
The number of countries around the world with data protection laws has also continued to grow. According to the World Trends Report 2017/2018, between 2012 and 2016, 20 UNESCO Member States adopted data protection laws for first time, bringing the global total to 101. Of these new adoptions, nine were in Africa, four in Asia and the Pacific, three in Latin America and the Caribbean, two in the Arab region and one in Western Europe and North America. During the same period, 23 countries revised their data protection laws, reflecting the new challenges to data protection in the digital era.

According to Global Partners Digital, only four States have secured in national legislation a general right to encryption, and 31 have enacted national legislation that grants law enforcement agencies the power to intercept or decrypt encrypted communications.

==== Private sector implications ====
Since 2010, to increase the protection of the information and communications of their users and to promote trust in their services’. High-profile examples of this have been WhatsApp&#x27;s implementation of full end-to-end encryption in its messenger service, and Apple&#x27;s contestation of a law enforcement warrant to unlock an iPhone used by the perpetrators of a terror attack.

=== Protection of confidential sources and whistle-blowing ===
Rapid changes in the digital environment, coupled with contemporary journalist practice that increasingly relies on digital communication technologies, pose new risks for the protection of journalism sources. Leading contemporary threats include mass surveillance technologies, mandatory data retention policies, and disclosure of personal digital activities by third party intermediaries. Without a thorough understanding of how to shield their digital communications and traces, journalists and sources can unwittingly reveal identifying information. Employment of national security legislation, such as counter-terrorism laws, to override existing legal protections for source protection is also becoming a common practice. In many regions, persistent secrecy laws or new cybersecurity laws threaten the protection of sources, such as when they give governments the right to intercept online communications in the interest of overly broad definitions of national security.

Developments in regards to source protection laws have occurred between 2007 and mid-2015 in 84 (69 per cent) of the 121 countries surveyed. The Arab region had the most notable developments, where 86 per cent of States had demonstrated shifts, followed by Latin America and the Caribbean (85 per cent), Asia and the Pacific (75 per cent), Western Europe and North America (66 per cent) and finally Africa, where 56 per cent of States examined had revised their source protection laws.

As of 2015, at least 60 nations had adopted some form of whistle-blower protection. At the international level, the United Nations Convention against Corruption entered into force in 2005. By July 2017, the majority of countries around the globe, 179 in total, had ratified the convention, which includes provisions for the protection of whistleblowers.

Regional conventions against corruption that contain protection for whistle-blowers have also been widely ratified. These include the Inter-American Convention Against Corruption, which has been ratified by 33 Member States, and the African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption, which was ratified by 36 UNESCO Member States.

In 2009, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Council adopted the Recommendation for Further Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions.

==Media pluralism==
According to the World Trends Report, access to a variety of media increased between 2012 and 2016. The internet has registered the highest growth in users supported by massive investments in infrastructure and significant uptake in mobile usage.

=== Internet mobile ===
The United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the work of the Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development, co-chaired by UNESCO, and the Internet Governance Forum&#x27;s intersessional work on &#x27;Connecting the Next Billion&#x27; are proof of the international commitments towards providing Internet access for all. According to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), by the end of 2017, an estimated 48 per cent of individuals regularly connect to the internet, up from 34 per cent in 2012. Despite the significant increase in absolute numbers, however, in the same period the annual growth rate of internet users has slowed down, with five per cent annual growth in 2017, dropping from a 10 per cent growth rate in 2012.

The number of unique mobile cellular subscriptions increased from 3.89 billion in 2012 to 4.83 billion in 2016, two-thirds of the world’s population, with more than half of subscriptions located in Asia and the Pacific. The number of subscriptions is predicted to rise to 5.69 billion users in 2020. As of 2016, almost 60 per cent of the world’s population had access to a 4G broadband cellular network, up from almost 50 per cent in 2015 and 11 per cent in 2012.

The limits that users face on accessing information via mobile applications coincide with a broader process of fragmentation of the internet. Zero-rating, the practice of internet providers allowing users free connectivity to access specific content or applications for free, has offered some opportunities for individuals to surmount economic hurdles, but has also been accused by its critics as creating a ‘two-tiered’ internet. To address the issues with zero-rating, an alternative model has emerged in the concept of ‘equal rating’ and is being tested in experiments by Mozilla and Orange in Africa. Equal rating prevents prioritization of one type of content and zero-rates all content up to a specified data cap. Some countries in the region had a handful of plans to choose from (across all mobile network operators) while others, such as Colombia, offered as many as 30 pre-paid and 34 post-paid plans.

=== Broadcast media ===
In Western Europe and North America, the primacy of television as a main source of information is being challenged by the internet, while in other regions, such as Africa, television is gaining greater audience share than radio, which has historically been the most widely accessed media platform. Age plays a profound role in determining the balance between radio, television and the internet as the leading source of news. According to the 2017 Reuters Institute Digital News Report, in 36 countries and territories surveyed, 51 per cent of adults 55 years and older consider television as their main news source, compared to only 24 per cent of respondents between 18 and 24. The pattern is reversed when it comes to online media, chosen by 64 per cent of users between 18 and 24 as their primary source, but only by 28 per cent of users 55 and older. According to the Arab Youth Survey, in 2016, 45 percent of the young people interviewed considered social media as a major source of news.

Satellite television has continued to add global or transnational alternatives to national viewing options for many audiences. Global news providers such as the BBC, Al Jazeera, Agence France-Presse, RT (formerly Russia Today) and the Spanish-language Agencia EFE, have used the internet and satellite television to better reach audiences across borders and have added specialist broadcasts to target specific foreign audiences. Reflecting a more outward looking orientation, China Global Television Network (CGTN), the multi-language and multi-channel grouping owned and operated by China Central Television, changed its name from CCTV-NEWS in January 2017. After years of budget cuts and shrinking global operations, in 2016 BBC announced the launch of 12 new language services (in Afaan Oromo, Amharic, Gujarati, Igbo, Korean, Marathi, Pidgin, Punjabi, Telugu, Tigrinya, and Yoruba), branded as a component of its biggest expansion ‘since the 1940s’.

Also expanding access to content are changes in usage patterns with non-linear viewing, as online streaming is becoming an important component of users’ experience. Since expanding its global service to 130 new countries in January 2016, Netflix experienced a surge in subscribers, surpassing 100 million subscribers in the second quarter of 2017, up from 40 million in 2012. The audience has also become more diverse with 47 per cent of users based outside of the United States, where the company began in 1997.

=== Newspaper industry ===
The Internet has challenged the press as an alternative source of information and opinion but has also provided a new platform for newspaper organizations to reach new audiences. Between 2012 and 2016, print newspaper circulation continued to fall in almost all regions, with the exception of Asia and the Pacific, where the dramatic increase in sales in a few select countries has offset falls in historically strong Asian markets such as Japan and the Republic of Korea. Between 2012 and 2016, India’s print circulation grew by 89 per cent. As many newspapers make the transition to online platforms, revenues from digital subscriptions and digital advertising have been growing significantly. How to capture more of this growth remains a pressing challenge for newspapers.

=== UNESCO&#x27;s work ===
==== Mandate ====
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in September 2015, includes Goal 16.10 to ‘ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and international agreements’. UNESCO has been assigned as the custodian agency responsible for global reporting on indicator 16.10.2 regarding the ‘number of countries that adopt and implement constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information’. This responsibility aligns with UNESCO&#x27;s commitment to promote universal access to information, grounded in its constitutional mandate to ‘promote the free flow of ideas by word and image’. In 2015, UNESCO&#x27;s General Conference proclaimed 28 September as the International Day for Universal Access to Information. The following year, participants of UNESCO&#x27;s annual celebration of World Press Freedom Day adopted the Finlandia Declaration on access to information and fundamental freedoms, 250 years after the first freedom of information law was adopted in what is modern day Finland and Sweden.

==== The International Programme for Development of Communication ====

The International Programme for the Development of Communication (IPDC) is a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) programme aimed at strengthening the development of mass media in developing countries. Its mandate since 2003 is &quot;... to contribute to sustainable development, democracy and good governance by fostering universal access to and distribution of information and knowledge by strengthening the capacities of the developing countries and countries in transition in the field of electronic media and the printed press.&quot;

The International Programme for the Development of Communication is responsible for the follow-up of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16 through indicators 16.10.1 and 16.10.2. Every two years, a report containing information from the Member States on the status of judicial inquiries on each of the killings condemned by UNESCO is submitted to the IPDC Council by UNESCO&#x27;s Director-General. The journalists safety indicators are a tool developed by UNESCO which, according to UNESCO&#x27;s website, aims on mapping the key features that can help assess safety of journalists, and help determine whether adequate follow-up is given to crimes committed against them. The IPDC Talks also allow the Programme to raise awareness on the importance of access to information. The IPDC is also the programme that monitors and reports on access to information laws around the world through the United Nations Secretary-General global report on follow-up to SDGs.

On 28 September 2015, UNESCO adopted the International Day for the Universal Access to Information during its 38th session. During the International Day, the IPDC organized the &quot;IPDC Talks: Powering Sustainable Development with Access to Information&quot; event, which gathered high-level participants. The annual event aims on highlighting the &quot;importance of access to information&quot; for sustainable development.

==== The Internet Universality framework ====

Internet Universality is the concept that &quot;the Internet is much more than infrastructure and applications, it is a network of economic and social interactions and relationships, which has the potential to enable human rights, empower individuals and communities, and facilitate sustainable development. The concept is based on four principles stressing the Internet should be Human rights-based, Open, Accessible, and based on Multistakeholder participation. These have been abbreviated as the R-O-A-M principles. Understanding the Internet in this way helps to draw together different facets of Internet development, concerned with technology and public policy, rights and development.&quot;

Through the concept internet universality UNESCO highlights access to information as a key to assess a better Internet environment. There is special relevance to the Internet of the broader principle of social inclusion. This puts forward the role of accessibility in overcoming digital divides, digital inequalities, and exclusions based on skills, literacy, language, gender or disability. It also points to the need for sustainable business models for Internet activity, and to trust in the preservation, quality, integrity, security, and authenticity of information and knowledge. Accessibility is interlinked to rights and openness. Based on the ROAM principles, UNESCO is now developing Internet Universality indicators to help governments and other stakeholders assess their own national Internet environments and to promote the values associated with Internet Universality, such as access to information.

=== The World Bank initiatives ===
In 2010, the World Bank launched the World Bank policy on access to information, which constitutes a major shift in the World Bank&#x27;s strategy. The principle binds the World Bank to disclose any requested information, unless it is on a &quot;list of exception&quot;:

# &quot;Personal information
# Communications of Governors and/or Executive Directors’ Offices
# Ethics Committee
# Attorney-Client Privilege
# Security and Safety Information
# Separate Disclosure Regimes
# Confidential Client/Third Party Information
# Corporate Administrative
# Deliberative Information*
# Financial Information&quot;

The World Bank is prone to Open Developments with its Open data, Open Finance and Open knowledge repository.

=== The World Summit on the Information Societies ===

The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) was a two-phase United Nations-sponsored summit on information, communication and, in broad terms, the information society that took place in 2003 in Geneva and in 2005 in Tunis. One of its chief aims was to bridge the global digital divide separating rich countries from poor countries by spreading access to the Internet in the developing world. The conferences established 17 May as World Information Society Day.

== Regional framework ==
The results from UNESCO monitoring of SDG 16.10.2 show that 112 countries have now adopted freedom of information legislation or similar administrative regulations. Of these, 22 adopted new legislation since 2012. At the regional level, Africa has seen the highest growth, with 10 countries adopting freedom of information legislation in the last five years, more than doubling the number of countries in the region to have such legislation from nine to 19. A similarly high growth rate has occurred in the Asia-Pacific region, where seven countries adopted freedom of information laws in the last five years, bringing the total to 22. In addition, during the reporting period, two countries in the Arab region, two countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, and one country in Western Europe and North America adopted freedom of information legislation. The vast majority of the world&#x27;s population now lives in a country with a freedom of information law, and several countries currently have freedom of information bills under consideration.

== National framework ==
=== Freedom of information laws ===

In June 2006, nearly 70 countries had freedom of information legislation applying to information held by government bodies and in certain circumstances to private bodies. In 19 of these countries, the freedom of information legislation also applied to private bodies. Access to information was increasingly recognised as a prerequisite for transparency and accountability of governments, as facilitating consumers&#x27; ability to make informed choices, and as safeguarding citizens against mismanagement and corruption. This has led an increasing number of countries to enact freedom of information legislation in the past 10 years. In recent years, private bodies have started to perform functions which were previously carried out by public bodies. Privatisation and de-regulation saw banks, telecommunications companies, hospitals and universities being run by private entities, leading to demands for the extension of freedom of information legislation to cover private bodies.

While there has been an increase in countries with freedom of information laws, their implementation and effectiveness vary considerably across the world. The Global Right to Information Rating is a programme providing advocates, legislators, reformers with tools to assess the strength of a legal framework. In measuring the strength and legal framework of each country&#x27;s freedom of information law using the Right to Information Rating, one notable trend appears. Largely regardless of geographic location, top scoring countries tend to have younger laws. According to the United Nations Secretary General’s 2017 report on the Sustainable Development Goals, to which UNESCO contributed freedom of information-related information, of the 109 countries with available data on implementation of freedom of information laws, 43 per cent do not sufficiently provide for public outreach and 43 per cent have overly-wide definitions of exceptions to disclosure, which run counter to the aim of increased transparency and accountability.

Despite the adoption of freedom of information laws; officials are often unfamiliar with the norms of transparency at the core of freedom of information or are unwilling to recognize them in practice. Journalists often do not make effective use of freedom of information laws for a multitude of reasons: official failure to respond to information requests, extensive delays, receipt of heavily redacted documents, arbitrarily steep fees for certain types of requests, and a lack of professional training.

Debates around public access to information have also focused on further developments in encouraging open data approaches to government transparency. In 2009, the data.gov portal was launched in the United States, collecting in one place most of the government open data; in the years following, there was a wave of government data opening around the world. As part of the Open Government Partnership, a multilateral network established in 2011, some 70 countries have now issued National Action Plans, the majority of which contain strong open data commitments designed to foster greater transparency, generate economic growth, empower citizens, fight corruption and more generally enhance governance. In 2015 the Open Data Charter was founded in a multistakeholder process in order to establish principles for ‘how governments should be publishing information’. The Charter has been adopted by 17 national governments half of which were from Latin America and the Caribbean.

The 2017 Open Data Barometer, conducted by the World Wide Web Foundation, shows that while 79 out of the 115 countries surveyed have open government data portals, in most cases &quot;the right policies are not in place, nor is the breadth and quality of the data-sets released sufficient&quot;. In general, the Open Data Barometer found that government data is usually &quot;incomplete, out of date, of low quality, and fragmented&quot;.

==== Private bodies ====
, the following 19 countries had freedom of information legislation that extended to government bodies and private bodies: Antigua and Barbuda, Angola, Armenia, Colombia, the Czech Republic, the Dominican Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Panama, Poland, Peru, South Africa, Turkey, Trinidad and Tobago, Slovakia, and the United Kingdom. The degree to which private bodies are covered under freedom of information legislation varies, in Angola, Armenia and Peru the legislation only applies to private companies that perform what are considered to be public functions. In the Czech Republic, the Dominican Republic, Finland, Trinidad and Tobago, Slovakia, Poland and Iceland private bodies that receive public funding are subject to freedom of information legislation. Freedom of information legislation in Estonia, France and UK covers private bodies in certain sectors. In South Africa the access provisions of the Promotion of Access to Information Act have been used by individuals to establish why their loan application has been denied. The access provisions have also been used by minority shareholders in private companies and environmental groups, who were seeking information on the potential environmental damage caused by company projects.

==== Consumer protection ====
In 1983, the United Nations Commission on Transnational Corporations adopted the United Nations Guidelines for Consumer Protection stipulating eight consumer rights, including &quot;consumer access to adequate information to enable making informed choices according to individual wishes and needs&quot;. Access to information became regarded as a basic consumer right, and preventive disclosure, i.e. the disclosure of information on threats to human lives, health and safety, began to be emphasized.

==== Investors ====
Secretive decision making by company directors and corporate scandal led to freedom of information legislation to be published for the benefits of investors. Such legislation was first adopted in Britain in the early 20th century, and later in North America and other countries. Disclosure regimes for the benefit of investors regained attention at the beginning of the 21st century as a number of corporate scandals were linked to accounting fraud and company director secrecy. Starting with Enron, the subsequent scandals involving Worldcom, Tyco, Adelphia and Global Crossing prompted the US Congress to impose new information disclosure obligations on companies with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002.

<text>In group theory, a branch of abstract algebra, a character table is a two-dimensional table whose rows correspond to irreducible representations, and whose columns correspond to conjugacy classes of group elements. The entries consist of characters, the traces of the matrices representing group elements of the column&#x27;s class in the given row&#x27;s group representation. In chemistry, crystallography, and spectroscopy, character tables of point groups are used to classify &quot;e.g.&quot; molecular vibrations according to their symmetry, and to predict whether a transition between two states is forbidden for symmetry reasons. Many university level textbooks on physical chemistry, quantum chemistry, spectroscopy and inorganic chemistry devote a chapter to the use of symmetry group character tables.

==Definition and example==
The irreducible complex characters of a finite group form a character table which encodes much useful information about the group &quot;G&quot; in a concise form. Each row is labelled by an irreducible character and the entries in the row are the values of that character on any representative of the respective conjugacy class of &quot;G&quot; (because characters are class functions). The columns are labelled by (representatives of) the conjugacy classes of &quot;G&quot;. It is customary to label the first row by the character of the trivial representation, which is the trivial action of on a 1-dimensional vector space by formula_1 for all formula_2. Each entry in the first row is therefore 1. Similarly, it is customary to label the first column by the identity. The entries of the first column are the values of the irreducible characters at the identity, the degrees of the irreducible characters. Characters of degree 1 are known as linear characters.

Here is the character table of &quot;C&quot;3 = &quot;&quot;, the cyclic group with three elements and generator &quot;u&quot;:

where ω is a primitive cube root of unity. The character table for general cyclic groups is (a scalar multiple of) the DFT matrix.

Another example is the character table of formula_3:

where (12) represents the conjugacy class consisting of (12), (13), (23), while (123) represents the conjugacy class consisting of (123), (132). To learn more about character table of symmetric groups, see .

The first row of the character table always consists of 1s, and corresponds to the trivial representation (the 1-dimensional representation consisting of 1×1 matrices containing the entry 1). Further, the character table is always square because (1) irreducible characters are pairwise orthogonal, and (2) no other non-trivial class function is orthogonal to every character. (A class function is one that is constant on conjugacy classes.) This is tied to the important fact that the irreducible representations of a finite group &quot;G&quot; are in bijection with its conjugacy classes. This bijection also follows by showing that the class sums form a basis for the center of the group algebra of &quot;G&quot;, which has dimension equal to the number of irreducible representations of &quot;G&quot;.

==Orthogonality relations==

The space of complex-valued class functions of a finite group &quot;G&quot; has a natural inner product:

:formula_4

where formula_5 denotes the complex conjugate of the value of formula_6 on formula_7. With respect to this inner product, the irreducible characters form an orthonormal basis
for the space of class functions, and this yields the orthogonality relation for the rows of the character
table:

:formula_8

For formula_9 the orthogonality relation for columns is as follows:

:formula_10

where the sum is over all of the irreducible characters formula_11 of &quot;G&quot; and the symbol formula_12 denotes the order of the centralizer of formula_7.

For an arbitrary character formula_11, it is irreducible if and only if formula_15.

The orthogonality relations can aid many computations including:
* Decomposing an unknown character as a linear combination of irreducible characters, i.e. # of copies of irreducible representation &quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot; in formula_16.
* Constructing the complete character table when only some of the irreducible characters are known.
* Finding the orders of the centralizers of representatives of the conjugacy classes of a group.
* Finding the order of the group, formula_17, for any &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot;.

If the irreducible representation &quot;V&quot; is non-trivial, then formula_18

More specifically, consider the regular representation which is the permutation obtained from a finite group &quot;G&quot; acting on (the free vector space spanned by) itself. The characters of this representation are formula_19 and formula_20 for formula_7 not the identity. Then given an irreducible representation formula_22,

:formula_23.

Then decomposing the regular representations as a sum of irreducible representations of &quot;G&quot;, we get formula_24, from which we conclude

:formula_25

over all irreducible representations formula_22. This sum can help narrow down the dimensions of the irreducible representations in a character table. For example, if the group has order 10 and 4 conjugacy classes (for instance, the dihedral group of order 10) then the only way to express the order of the group as a sum of four squares is formula_27, so we know the dimensions of all the irreducible representations.

==Properties==
Complex conjugation acts on the character table: since the complex conjugate of a representation is again a representation, the same is true for characters, and thus a character that takes on non-real complex values has a conjugate character.

Certain properties of the group &quot;G&quot; can be deduced from its character table:

* The order of &quot;G&quot; is given by the sum of the squares of the entries of the first column (the degrees of the irreducible characters). More generally, the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the entries in any column gives the order of the centralizer of an element of the corresponding conjugacy class.
*All normal subgroups of &quot;G&quot; (and thus whether or not &quot;G&quot; is simple) can be recognised from its character table. The kernel of a character χ is the set of elements &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot; for which χ(g) = χ(1); this is a normal subgroup of &quot;G&quot;. Each normal subgroup of &quot;G&quot; is the intersection of the kernels of some of the irreducible characters of &quot;G&quot;. 
*The number of irreducible representations of &quot;G&quot; equals the number of conjugacy classes that &quot;G&quot; has.
*The commutator subgroup of is the intersection of the kernels of the linear characters of .
*If is finite, then since the character table is square and has as many rows as conjugacy classes, it follows that is abelian iff each conjugacy class has size 1 iff the character table of is formula_28 iff each irreducible character is linear.
*It follows, using some results of Richard Brauer from modular representation theory, that the prime divisors of the orders of the elements of each conjugacy class of a finite group can be deduced from its character table (an observation of Graham Higman).

The character table does not in general determine the group up to isomorphism: for example, the quaternion group and the dihedral group of order 8 have the same character table. Brauer asked whether the character table, together with the knowledge of how the powers of elements of its conjugacy classes are distributed, determines a finite group up to isomorphism. In 1964, this was answered in the negative by E. C. Dade.

The linear representations of are themselves a group under the tensor product, since the tensor product of vector spaces is again . That is, if formula_29 and formula_30 are linear representations, then formula_31 defines a new linear representation. This gives rise to a group of linear characters, called the character group under the operation formula_32. This group is connected to Dirichlet characters and Fourier analysis.

== Outer automorphisms ==
The outer automorphism group acts on the character table by permuting columns (conjugacy classes) and accordingly rows, which gives another symmetry to the table. For example, abelian groups have the outer automorphism formula_33, which is non-trivial except for elementary abelian 2-groups, and outer because abelian groups are precisely those for which conjugation (inner automorphisms) acts trivially. In the example of formula_34 above, this map sends formula_35 and accordingly switches formula_36 and formula_37 (switching their values of formula_38 and formula_39). Note that this particular automorphism (negative in abelian groups) agrees with complex conjugation.

Formally, if formula_40 is an automorphism of &quot;G&quot; and formula_41 is a representation, then formula_42 is a representation. If formula_43 is an inner automorphism (conjugation by some element &quot;a&quot;), then it acts trivially on representations, because representations are class functions (conjugation does not change their value). Thus a given class of outer automorphisms, it acts on the characters – because inner automorphisms act trivially, the action of the automorphism group formula_44 descends to the quotient formula_45.

This relation can be used both ways: given an outer automorphism, one can produce new representations (if the representation is not equal on conjugacy classes that are interchanged by the outer automorphism), and conversely, one can restrict possible outer automorphisms based on the character table.

== Finding the vibrational modes of a water molecule using character table ==
To find the total number of vibrational modes of a water molecule, the irreducible representation Γirreducible needs to calculate from the character table of a water molecule first.

=== Finding Γreducible from the Character Table of H²O molecule ===
Water (&lt;chem&gt;H2O&lt;/chem&gt;) molecule falls under the point group formula_46. Below is the character table of formula_46 point group, which is also the character table for a water molecule. 
In here, the first row describes the possible symmetry operations of this point group and the first column represents the Mulliken symbols. The fifth and sixth columns are functions of the axis variables. 

Functions:

* formula_48, formula_49 and formula_50 are related to translational movement and IR active bands.
* formula_51, formula_52 and formula_53 are related to rotation about respective axis.
* Quadratic functions (such as formula_54, formula_55, formula_56, formula_57,formula_58, formula_59, formula_60,formula_61) are related to Raman active bands.

When determining the characters for a representation, assign formula_62 if it remains unchanged, formula_63 if it moved, and formula_64 if it reversed its direction. A simple way to determine the characters for the reducible representation formula_65, is to multiply the &quot;&quot;number of unshifted atom(s)&quot; with &quot;contribution per atom&quot;&quot; along each of three axis (formula_66) when a symmetry operation is carried out. 

Unless otherwise stated, for the identity operation formula_67, &quot;contribution per unshifted atom&quot; for each atom is always formula_68, as none of the atom(s) change their position during this operation. For any reflective symmetry operation formula_69, &quot;contribution per atom&quot; is always formula_62, as for any reflection, an atom remains unchanged along with two axis and reverse its direction along with the other axis. For the inverse symmetry operation formula_71, &quot;contribution per unshifted atom&quot; is always formula_72, as each of three axis of an atom reverse its direction during this operation. An easiest way to calculate &quot;contribution per unshifted atom&quot; for formula_73 and formula_74 symmetry operation is to use below formulas
: formula_75
: formula_76
where, formula_77

A simplified version of above statements is summarized in the table below
&quot;Character of formula_65 for any symmetry operation formula_79 Number of unshifted atom(s) during this operation formula_80 Contribution per unshifted atom along each of three axis&quot;

=== Calculating the irreducible representation Γirreducible from the reducible representation Γreducible along with the character table ===
From the above discussion, a new character table for a water molecule (formula_46 point group) can be written as
Using the new character table including formula_82, the reducible representation for all motion of the &lt;chem&gt;H2O&lt;/chem&gt; molecule can be reduced using below formula

: formula_83 

where, 

: formula_84 order of the group, 
: formula_85 character of the formula_65 for a particular class, 
: formula_87 character from the reducible representation for a particular class, 
: formula_88 the number of operations in the class

So,

formula_89

formula_90

formula_91

formula_92

So, the reduced representation for all motions of water molecule will be

formula_93

=== Translational motion for water molecule ===
Translational motion will corresponds with the reducible representations in the character table, which have formula_48, formula_49 and formula_50 function
As only the reducible representations formula_97, formula_98 and formula_99 correspond to the formula_48, formula_49 and formula_50 function, 

formula_103

=== Rotational motion for water molecule ===
Rotational motion will corresponds with the reducible representations in the character table, which have formula_51, formula_52 and formula_53 function
As only the reducible representations formula_98, formula_97 and formula_109 correspond to the formula_48, formula_49 and formula_50 function, 

formula_113

=== Total vibrational modes for water molecule ===
Total vibrational mode, formula_114

formula_115

formula_116

So, total formula_117 vibrational modes are possible for water molecules and two of them are symmetric vibrational modes (as formula_118) and the other vibrational mode is antisymmetric (as formula_119) 

=== Checking whether the water molecule is IR active or Raman active ===
There is some rules to be IR active or Raman active for a particular mode. 

* If there is a formula_48, formula_49 or formula_50 for any irreducible representation, then the mode is IR active
* If there is a quadratic functions such as formula_54, formula_55, formula_56, formula_57,formula_58, formula_59, formula_60 or formula_130 for any irreducible representation, then the mode is Raman active
* If there is no formula_48, formula_49, formula_50 nor quadratic functions for any irreducible representation, then the mode is neither IR active nor Raman active

As the vibrational modes for water molecule formula_134 contains both formula_48, formula_49 or formula_50 and quadratic functions, it has both the IR active vibrational modes and Raman active vibrational modes.

Similar rules will apply for rest of the irreducible representations formula_138

<text>Nikolai Robert Maximilian Freiherr von Ungern-Sternberg (; 10 January 1886 – 15 September 1921), often referred to as Roman von Ungern-Sternberg or Baron Ungern, was an anti-communist general in the Russian Civil War and then an independent warlord who intervened in Mongolia against China. A part of the Russian Empire&#x27;s Baltic German minority, Ungern was an ultraconservative monarchist who aspired to restore the Russian monarchy after the 1917 Russian Revolutions and to revive the Mongol Empire under the rule of the Bogd Khan. His attraction to Vajrayana Buddhism and his eccentric, often violent, treatment of enemies and his own men earned him the sobriquet &quot;the Mad Baron&quot; or &quot;the Bloody Baron&quot;. He was viewed by his Mongolian subjects during his rule as the &quot;God of War&quot;.

In February 1921, at the head of the Asiatic Cavalry Division, Ungern expelled Chinese troops from Mongolia and restored the monarchic power of the Bogd Khan. During his five-month occupation of Outer Mongolia, Ungern imposed order on the capital city, Ikh Khüree (now Ulaanbaatar), by fear, intimidation and brutal violence against his opponents, such as the Bolsheviks, Jews and Chinese. In June 1921, he travelled to eastern Siberia to support anti-Bolshevik partisan forces and to head off a joint Red Army-Mongolian rebel invasion. That action ultimately led to his defeat and capture two months later. He was taken prisoner by the Red Army and, a month later, was put on trial for &quot;counter-revolution&quot; in Novonikolayevsk (now Novosibirsk). He was found guilty after a six-hour show trial, and on 15 September 1921 he was executed.

==Early life==

Nikolai Robert Maximilian Freiherr von Ungern-Sternberg was born in Graz, Austria, on to a noble Baltic German family. The Ungern-Sternberg family had settled in present-day Estonia during the Middle Ages. Ungern-Sternberg&#x27;s first language was German, but he became fluent in French, Russian, English and Estonian. His mother was a German noblewoman, Sophie Charlotte von Wimpffen, later Sophie Charlotte von Ungern-Sternberg, and his father was Theodor Leonhard Rudolph Freiherr von Ungern-Sternberg (1857–1918). He also had Hungarian roots and claimed descent from Batu Khan, Genghis Khan&#x27;s grandson, which played a role in his dream of reviving the Mongol Empire.

In 1888 his family moved to Reval (Tallinn), the capital of the Governorate of Estonia in the Russian Empire, where his parents divorced in 1891. In 1894 his mother married the Baltic-German nobleman Oskar Anselm Hermann Freiherr von Hoyningen-Huene. Ungern-Sternberg grew up in the Governorate, with his home being the Hoyningen-Huene estate at Jerwakant (modern Järvakandi, Estonia), deep in the forests, about from Reval. In the summer, Ungern-Sternberg lived on the Baltic island of Dagö (now Hiiumaa), which he liked to boast had belonged to his family for over 200 years.
As a boy, Ungern-Sternberg was noted for being such a ferocious bully that even the other bullies feared him and several parents forbade their children from playing with him as he was a &quot;terror&quot;. Ungern was well known for his love of torturing animals, and at the age of 12 he tried to strangle to death his cousin&#x27;s pet owl for no particularly good reason other than his cruelty towards animals. Ungern-Sternberg had extreme pride in his ancient, aristocratic family and later wrote that his family had over the centuries &quot;never taken orders from the working classes&quot; and it was outrageous that &quot;dirty workers who&#x27;ve never had any servants of their own, but still think they can command&quot; should have any say in the ruling of the vast Russian Empire. Ungern-Sternberg, although proud of his German origin, identified himself very strongly with the Russian Empire. When asked whether his &quot;family had distinguished itself in Russian service&quot;, Ungern proudly answered: &quot;Seventy-two killed in wartime!&quot; Ungern-Sternberg believed that return to monarchies in Europe was possible with the aid of &quot;cavalry people&quot; – meaning Russian Cossacks, Buryats, Tatars, Mongols, Kyrgyz, Kalmyks, etc.

In 1898, his father was briefly imprisoned for fraud; a year later he was committed to the local insane asylum. From 1900 to 1902 Ungern attended the Nicholas I Gymnasium in Reval. His school records show an unruly, bad-tempered young man who was constantly in trouble with his teachers because of frequent fights with other cadets and breaking other school rules: smoking in bed, growing long hair, leaving without permission, etc., which finally led the schoolmaster to write his stepfather and mother in February 1905 asking them to withdraw him from the school or he would be expelled. They chose the former, and Ungern joined the fighting in eastern Russia during the Russo-Japanese War. It is unclear whether he saw action against the Japanese or if all military operations had ceased before his arrival in Manchuria, although he was awarded the Russo-Japanese War Medal in 1913.

During the 1905 Russian Revolution, Estonian peasants went on a bloody &quot;jacquerie&quot; against the Baltic-German nobility, who owned most of the land. Aristocrats were lynched and their estates burned down, among them the one at Jerwakant where Ungern-Sternberg had grown up. These events were traumatic for Ungern-Sternberg, confirming his belief that the Estonian peasants who worked on his family&#x27;s lands were all &quot;rough, untutored, wild and constantly angry, hating everybody and everything without understanding why&quot;.

In 1906, Ungern was transferred to the Pavlovsk Military School, in St. Petersburg, as a cadet of ordinary rank. As an army cadet, he proved to be a better student than he ever was as a naval cadet, and he actually studied his course material, but in the words of Palmer, he was a &quot;mediocre student&quot; at best. During the same period, Ungern-Sternberg became obsessed with the occult and developed an interest in Buddhism. His cousin Count Hermann von Keyserling, who later knew him well, wrote that the baron was very curious from his teenage years onward with &quot;Tibetan and Hindu philosophy&quot; and often spoke of the mystical powers possessed by &quot;geometrical symbols&quot;. Keyserling called Ungern-Sternberg &quot;one of the most metaphysically and occultly gifted men I have ever met&quot; and believed that the baron could read minds. Later, in Mongolia, Ungern became a Buddhist but did not leave the Lutheran faith. There is a widespread view that he was viewed by Mongols as the incarnation of the &quot;God of War&quot; (the figure of Jamsaran in Tibetan and Mongol folklore). Comparison of old narrations collected by B. Rinchen with scattered memoir data and memories preserved in Mongolia suggested that Ungern could be associated with Gesar, who in some Buddhist representations of the Mongols was considered the god of war and associated with Jamsaran. Although many Mongols may have believed him to be a deity or at the very least a re-incarnation of Genghis Khan, Ungern was never officially proclaimed to be any of those incarnations.

After graduating, he specifically asked to be stationed with a Cossack regiment in Asia, to learn more about Asian culture. His request was granted, and he served as an officer in eastern Siberia in the 1st Argunsky and then in the 1st Amursky Cossack regiments, where he became enthralled with the lifestyle of nomadic peoples, such as the Mongols and Buryats.

Ungern-Sternberg was notorious for his heavy drinking and exceptionally cantankerous moods. In one such brawl, his face was scarred when the officer that he fought struck him with his sword. It was also rumored that brain damage from the injury had affected his sanity. However, a special study found that Ungern-Sternberg was sane, although the wound affected his irritability.

In 1913, at his request, he transferred to the reserves. Ungern moved to Outer Mongolia to assist the Mongols in their struggle for independence from China, but Russian officials prevented him from fighting on the side of Mongolian troops. He arrived in the town of Khovd, in western Mongolia, and served as an out-of-staff officer in the Cossack guard detachment at the Russian consulate.

==First World War==

On 19 July 1914, Ungern joined frontline forces as part of the second-turn 34th Regiment of Cossack troops stationed on the Austro-Hungarian frontier in Galicia. He took part in the Russian offensive in East Prussia. From 1915 to 1916, he also participated in rear-action raids on German troops by the L.N. Punin Cavalry Special Task Force. Ungern served in the Nerchinsk Regiment.

Throughout the war on the Eastern Front, he gained a reputation as an extremely brave but somewhat reckless and mentally unstable officer. Showing no fear of death, he seemed happiest leading cavalry charges and being in the thick of combat. General Pyotr Wrangel mentions Ungern&#x27;s determination in his memoirs. He received the orders of St. George of the 4th grade, St. Vladimir of the 4th grade, St. Anna of the 3rd and 4th grades and St. Stanislas of the 3rd grade. These decorations were offset by disciplinary issues: he was eventually discharged from one of his command positions for attacking another officer and a hall porter during a drunken rage in October 1916, for which he was sentenced to two months in prison after a court martial.

After his release, in January 1917, Ungern was transferred to the Caucasian Theatre of the conflict, where Russia was fighting against the Ottoman Empire. The February Revolution that ended the rule of the House of Romanov was an extremely bitter blow to the monarchist Ungern-Sternberg, who saw it as the beginning of the end of Russia. In the Caucasus, Ungern-Sternberg first met Cossack Captain Grigory Semyonov, later one of the most well-known Russian anticommunist warlords in Siberia.

In April 1917, near Urmia, Iran, Ungern, together with Semyonov, started to organise a volunteer Assyrian Christian unit. The Assyrian genocide under the Ottoman Empire led to thousands of Assyrians fleeing to the Russian lines. Ungern and Semyonov organised Assyrian troops to serve as an example for the Russian army, generally demoralised by the revolutionary mood. The Assyrians scored some minor victories over the Turks, but their contribution to Russia&#x27;s war effort was limited. Afterwards, the Assyrian scheme led Semyonov to the idea of placing Buryat troops in Siberia. The Kerensky government gave its approval, and Ungern-Sternberg soon headed east to join his friend in raising a Buryat regiment.

==Russian Civil War==
After the Bolshevik-led October Revolution in 1917, Semyonov and Ungern declared their allegiance to the Romanov dynasty, making themselves part of the White Army, vowing to fight the revolutionaries&#x27; Red Army. Late that year, they and five Cossacks peacefully disarmed a group of about 1,500 Reds at a railway station in Manchuria on the Far Eastern Railway (FER) in China, near the Russian border. They maintained it as a stronghold in their preparations for war in the Transbaikal region, raising troops in a Special Manchurian Regiment, the nucleus of forces led by Grigory Semyonov.

After the White troops defeated the Reds on a section of the FER line in Russia, Semyonov appointed Ungern commandant of troops stationed in Dauria, a railway station in a strategic position east-southeast of Lake Baikal. Semyonov and Ungern, though fervently anti-Bolshevik, were not typical of the figures to be found in the leadership of the White movement, as their plans differed from those of the main White leaders. Semyonov refused to recognize the authority of Admiral Alexander Kolchak, the nominal leader of the Whites in Siberia. Instead, he acted independently and was supported by the Japanese with arms and money.

For White leaders like Kolchak and Denikin, who believed in a &quot;Russia strong and indivisible&quot;, that represented high treason. Ungern, nominally subordinate to Semyonov, also often acted independently. Kolchak was a conservative but not a monarchist, and he promised that after the victory of the Whites he would reconvene the Constituent Assembly, disbanded by the Bolsheviks in January 1918, which would then decide the future of Russia, including the question of whether to restore the monarchy. Ungern, to the contrary, believed that monarchs were accountable only to God, and the monarchy was the political system that God had chosen for Russia and so it was self-evident that it should be restored as it had been before the October Manifesto of 1905. For Ungern, the opinions of the people of Russia were irrelevant, as monarchs were not accountable to them.

Because of his successful military operations in Hailar and Dauria, Ungern received the rank of major-general. Semyonov entrusted him with forming military units to battle Bolshevik forces. They enrolled Buryats and Mongols in their national military units.

During this time, Semyonov and Ungern grew personally distant although neither admitted it publicly. Ungern, whose interest in Buddhism had led him to follow an increasingly ascetic personal lifestyle, was disgusted by his mentor&#x27;s corruption and debauchery. In particular, the virulently antisemitic Ungern was so outraged by Semyonov&#x27;s public affair with a Jewish cabaret singer that he named one of his horses after her. Semyonov was also uninterested in ensuring that his subordinates followed his orders. Combined with Ungern&#x27;s tendency to act on his own, this greatly impaired their combined military effectiveness.

In Dauria, Ungern formed the volunteer Asiatic Cavalry Division (ACD), creating a fortress where he launched attacks on Red forces. Under his rule, Dauria became a well-known &quot;torture centre&quot; filled with the bones of dozens of Ungern&#x27;s victims, who were executed as Reds or thieves. Ungern&#x27;s chief executioner had been a Colonel Laurentz, but in Mongolia, Ungern had him executed because he lost Ungern&#x27;s trust under unclear circumstances.

Like many other White units, Ungern&#x27;s troops used &quot;requisitions&quot; of freight on Manchuria-bound trains passing through Dauria, as supplies. Their confiscations did not significantly diminish the supplies of Kolchak&#x27;s forces, but private Russian and Chinese merchants lost considerable property.

In 1919, taking advantage of the instability in Russia, the Chinese government, established by members of the Anhui military party, sent troops, led by General Xu Shuzheng, to join Outer Mongolia to China. This action violated the terms of a tripartite Russian-Mongolian-Chinese agreement concluded in 1915 that secured Mongolian autonomy and did not allow the presence of Chinese troops except minimal consular guards. Although the Anhui party was supported by Japan, indications of Japan-inspired Chinese occupation of Outer Mongolia have not yet been confirmed by documents.

After the fall of Anhui party rule in China, Chinese soldiers in Mongolia found themselves effectively abandoned. They rebelled against their commanders, plundering and killing Mongols and foreigners. Some of the Chinese troops during the occupation were Tsahar (Chahar) Mongols from Inner Mongolia, a major cause of animosity between Outer Mongols (Khalkhas) and Inner Mongols.

As part of his plans, Ungern travelled to Manchuria and China between February and September 1919, establishing contacts with monarchist circles and making preparations for Semyonov to meet the Manchurian warlord Marshal Zhang Zuolin, the &quot;Old Marshal&quot;. In July 1919, Ungern married the Manchurian princess Ji, who was just 19, in an Orthodox ceremony in Harbin. The princess was given the name Elena Pavlovna; she and Ungern communicated in English, their only common language. The marriage had a political aim, as Ji was a relative of General Zhang Kuiwu, the commander of Chinese troops at the western end of the Chinese-Manchurian Railway and the governor of Hailar.

==Restoration of Outer Mongolian independence==

After Kolchak&#x27;s defeat by the Reds and Japan&#x27;s subsequent decision to withdraw its expeditionary troops from the Transbaikal, Semyonov, unable to withstand the pressure of Bolshevik forces, planned a retreat to Manchuria. Ungern, however, saw it as an opportunity to implement his monarchist plan. The ACD was then approximately 1,500 men, mostly Russian but with Cossacks, Buryat, Chinese and a few Japanese, all under Russian command, with rifles, machine guns and four artillery pieces. Ungern drove them mercilessly in training, maintaining even stricter discipline than he had previously. Minor offences were punished by lashings with bamboo; soldiers committing more serious violations were usually executed. On 7 August 1920, he broke his allegiance to Semyonov and transformed the ACD into a guerrilla detachment. After crossing the Outer Mongolian border on 1 October, they moved southwest, then moved westwards to the Mongolian capital of Urga (officially Niislel Khuree, now Ulaanbaatar). There, he entered into negotiations with Chinese occupying forces. All of his demands, including the disarmament of Chinese troops, were rejected.

On 26–27 October and again on 2–4 November 1920, Ungern&#x27;s troops assaulted Urga but suffered disastrous losses. After the defeat, his forces retreated to the upper currents of the Kherlen River, in Setsen-Khan Aimag, a district ruled by princes with the title Setsen Khan, in eastern Outer Mongolia. He was supported by Mongols who sought independence from Chinese occupation, especially the spiritual and secular leader of Mongols, the Bogd Khan, who secretly sent Ungern his blessing for expelling Chinese from Mongolia.

Ungern&#x27;s devotion to harsh discipline remained unabated. After learning that a lieutenant he had initially favored and put in command of the medical division had, during the retreat, sexually assaulted the nurses (many of whom were married to other officers), looted settlements the unit passed through and ordered all the wounded fatally poisoned because they were &quot;a nuisance&quot;, Ungern ordered the man flogged and then burned at the stake.

The Chinese had tightened their control of Outer Mongolia by then, by strictly regulating Buddhist services in monasteries and imprisoning Russians and Mongols whom they considered &quot;separatists&quot;. According to the memoirs of M. G. Tornovsky, the ACD numbered 1,460 men, while the Chinese garrison was 7,000 strong. The Chinese had the advantage in artillery and machine guns and had built a network of trenches in and around Urga. 

Ungern&#x27;s troops began moving from their camp to Urga on 31 January. On 2 February, they battled for control of Chinese front lines and secured parts of Urga. His detachment, led by B. P. Rezukhin, captured Chinese front-line fortifications near Small Madachan and Big Madachan settlements in the southeastern vicinities of Urga. During the battle Ungern&#x27;s special detachment of Tibetans, Mongols, Buryats, and Russians rescued the Bogd Khan from house arrest and transported him through the Bogd Uul to Manjushri Monastery. At the same time, another detachment moved to the mountains east of Urga.

The following day, he gave his soldiers a respite. Borrowing a tactic from Genghis Khan, he ordered his troops to light a large number of campfires in the hills surrounding Urga and to use them as reference points for Rezukhin&#x27;s detachment. That made the town appear to be surrounded by an overwhelming force.

Early on 4 February, Ungern launched an assault on the Chinese White barracks from the east, captured them and divided his forces into two parts. The first launched a major assault on the remaining Chinese positions in the Chinese trade settlement (, &quot;Maimaicheng&quot;, &quot;buy-sell-city&quot;). The second moved westwards towards the Consular Settlement. Upon reaching the Maimaicheng, Ungern had his men smash their way in by blasting the gates with explosives and improvised battering rams. After breaking in, a general slaughter set in, as both sides fought with sabres.

After the capture of Maimaicheng, Ungern joined his troops attacking Chinese troops at the Consular Settlement. After a Chinese counterattack, Ungern&#x27;s soldiers retreated a short distance northeast and then launched another attack with the support of another Cossack and Mongolian detachment, which began an attack from the northeast and northwest. Ungern&#x27;s troops gradually moved westwards in Urga, pursuing retreating Chinese soldiers.

The capital city was finally taken on the evening of 4 February. Chinese civilian administrators and military commanders abandoned their soldiers and fled northwards from Urga in 11 cars in the night of 3–4 February. Chinese troops fled northward on 4 and 5 February. They massacred any Mongolian civilians they encountered along the road from Urga to the Russian border.

Russian settlers who supported the Reds moved from Urga, together with the fleeing Chinese troops. During the capture of Urga, the Chinese lost about 1500 men, and Ungern&#x27;s forces suffered about 60 casualties.

After the battle, Ungern&#x27;s troops, initially welcomed as liberators by a populace tired of living under Chinese rule, began plundering Chinese stores and killing Russian Jews who were living in Urga, as the Cossacks had also been set against the Jews. Ungern himself ordered the Jews to be killed except for those who had notes from him sparing their lives. It has been estimated by surviving archival documents and memoirs that 43–50 Jews were killed during Ungern&#x27;s stay in Mongolia, about 5–6% of all those executed under his orders. This pogrom effectively eliminated Urga&#x27;s entire Jewish community at the time.

Several days later, Ungern stopped the looting, but his secret police bureau, led by Colonel Leonid Sipailov, who had already developed a reputation for serious brutality under Ungern in Russia, continued searching for &quot;Reds&quot;. Between 11 and 13 March, Ungern captured a fortified Chinese base at Choir, between the Otsol Uul and Choiryn Bogd Uul Mountains, south of Urga. Ungern had 900 troops and the Chinese defenders about 1500. After capturing Choir, Ungern returned to Urga. His detachments, consisting of Cossacks and Mongols, moved southward to Zamyn-Üüd, a frontier settlement and another Chinese base. The defending Chinese soldiers abandoned Zamyn-Üüd without a fight.

When the remaining Chinese troops, having retreated to northern Mongolia near Kyakhta, attempted to go around Urga to the west to reach China, the Russians and the Mongols feared that they were attempting to recapture Urga. Several hundred Cossack and Mongol troops were dispatched to stop the several thousand Chinese in the area of Talyn Ulaankhad Hill near the Urga–Uliastai road in central Mongolia. After a battle that raged from 30 March to 2 April in which more than a thousand Chinese and approximately 100 Mongols, Russians and Buryats were killed, the Chinese were routed and chased to the southern border of the country. Thus Chinese forces left Outer Mongolia.

==Mongolia and Ungern (February to August 1921)==

Ungern, Mongolian lamas and princes brought the Bogd Khan from Manjusri Monastery to Urga on 21 February 1921. On 22 February, a solemn ceremony took place to restore the Bogd Khan to the throne. As a reward for ousting the Chinese from Urga, the Bogd Khan granted Ungern the high hereditary title &quot;darkhan khoshoi chin wang&quot; in the degree of &quot;khan&quot;, and other privileges. Other officers, lamas and princes who had participated in these events also received high titles and awards.

On 22 February 1921, Mongolia was proclaimed an independent monarchy. Supreme power over Mongolia belonged to the Bogd Khan, or the 8th Bogd Gegen Jebtsundamba Khutuktu.

Ossendowski had served as an official in Kolchak&#x27;s government and, after its collapse, fled to Mongolia. He became one of Ungern&#x27;s very few friends, and in 1922, published a best-selling book in English, &quot;Beasts, Men and Gods&quot;, about his adventures in Siberia and Mongolia. Comparison of Ossendowski&#x27;s diary with his book and documents on Mongolia revealed that his reports on Mongolia at Ungern are largely true, except for a few stories. Ossendowski was the first to describe Ungern&#x27;s views in terms of Theosophy, but Ungern himself had never been a Theosophist.

A similar novel, Asian Odyssey, written by Dmitri Alioshin who was a soldier in Ungern&#x27;s forces, describes the millenarist beliefs common among Ungern&#x27;s supporters:

Hutukhta did not share Ungern&#x27;s enthusiasm for re-establishing monarchy across the continent, knowing that his small army would likely be vanquished by the Soviets or Chinese long before any of these ambitions could be realized. In April 1921 he wrote to Beijing distancing Outer Mongolia from Ungern&#x27;s vision and asking if the Chinese government would be interested in resuming the dominant relationship it had had under the former emperors. Ungern thus began seeking other sources of support. Japan, believed by the Soviets to be supporting Ungern extensively, instead doubted the capability of the ACD and considered the mercurial Ungern harder to work with than Semyonov had been. The Chinese warlords Ungern reached out to also rejected his plans, even Zhang Zuolin, then in control of most of Manchuria, to whom Ungern offered the throne of a hypothetical empire that would stretch to Central Asia.

Ungern did not interfere in Mongolian affairs and assisted Mongols only in some issues according to orders of the Bogd Khan. Russian colonists, on the other hand, suffered cruelties from Ungern&#x27;s secret police bureau led by Sipailov. A list of people known to have been killed on Ungern&#x27;s orders or by others on their pretext, both in Russia and Mongolia, confirms the deaths of 846 people, approximately 100–120 from Urga, about 3–8% of the total foreign colony population. Ungern&#x27;s unrelenting harshness contributed to discontent that later erupted in mutiny among his troops.

Dozens of Tibetans also served as part of his troops. They might have been sent by 13th Dalai Lama, with whom Ungern communicated, or the Tibetans may have belonged to the Tibetan colony in Urga.

The presence of the Japanese unit in the division is often explained as evidence that Japan stood behind Ungern in his actions in Mongolia. Studies of their interrogations from Japanese archives revealed that they were mercenaries serving on their own, like other nationals in the division, and that Ungern was not managed by Japan.

Owen Lattimore used the words &quot;a strange, romantic and sometimes savage figure&quot; for the Mongol Sandagdorjiyn Magsarjav (1877–1927). Magsarjav had served under Ungern-Sternberg. In Uriankhai Kazakh bandits who were captured had their hearts cut out and sacrificed by Magsarjav.

==Defeat, capture and execution==

The Bolsheviks started infiltrating Mongolia shortly after the October Revolution, long before they took control of the Russian Transbaikal. In 1921, various Red Army units belonging to Soviet Russia and to the Far Eastern Republic invaded the newly independent Mongolia to defeat Ungern. The forces included the Red Mongolian leader Damdin Sükhbaatar. The Soviets also began supporting the newly formed Mongolian Communist Party and its partisans in actions against Ungern and the government.

Spies and various smaller diversionary units went ahead to spread terror to weaken Ungern&#x27;s forces. Ungern organised an expedition to meet these forces in Siberia and to support ongoing anti-Bolshevik rebellions. Believing that he had the unwavering popular support of locals in Siberia and Mongolia, Ungern failed to strengthen his troops properly, although he was vastly outnumbered and outgunned by the Red forces. He did not know that the Reds had successfully crushed uprisings in Siberia and that Soviet economic policies had temporarily softened in Lenin&#x27;s New Economic Policy. Upon Ungern&#x27;s arrival in Siberia, few local peasants and Cossacks volunteered to join him.

In the spring, the Asiatic Cavalry Division was divided into two brigades: one under the command of Lieutenant General Ungern and the second under Major General Rezukhin. In May, Rezukhin&#x27;s brigade launched a raid beyond the Russian border, west of the Selenga River. Ungern&#x27;s brigade left Urga and slowly moved to the Russian town of Troitskosavsk (present-day Kyakhta in Buryatia).

Meanwhile, the Reds moved large numbers of troops towards Mongolia from different directions. They had a tremendous advantage in equipment (armoured cars, aeroplanes, rail, gunboats, ammunition, human reserves etc.) and the number of troops. As a result, Ungern was defeated in battles that took place between 11 and 13 June, and he failed to capture Troitskosavsk. Combined Bolshevik and Red Mongol forces entered Urga on 6 July 1921 after a few small skirmishes with Ungern&#x27;s guard detachments.

Chinese forces slaughtered most of a 350 strong White Russian forces in June 1921 under Colonel Kazagrandi in the Gobi desert, with only two batches of 42 men and 35 men surrendering separately as Chinese were wiping out White Russian remnants following the Soviet Red army defeat of Ungern Sternberg, and other Buryat and White Russian remnants of Ungern-Sternberg&#x27;s army were massacred by Soviet Red Army and Mongol forces in the same summer, in Uliastai Mongols beat Colonel Vangdabov&#x27;s Buryats to death with clubs for being loyal to Ungern-Sternberg.
Although they had captured Urga, the Red forces failed to defeat the main forces of the Asiatic Division (Ungern&#x27;s and Rezukhin&#x27;s brigades). Ungern regrouped and attempted to invade Transbaikal, across the Russo-Mongolian border. To rally his soldiers and local people, he quoted an agreement with Semyonov and pointed to a supposed Japanese offensive that was to support their drive, but neither Semyonov nor the Japanese were eager to assist him.

After several days of rest, the Asiatic Division started its raid into Soviet territory on 18 July. The eyewitnesses Kamil Giżycki and Mikhail Tornovsky gave similar estimates of their numbers: about 3000 men in total. Ungern&#x27;s troops penetrated deep into Russian territory.

The Soviets declared martial law in areas where the Whites were expected, including Verkhneudinsk (now Ulan-Ude, the capital of Buryatia). Ungern&#x27;s troops captured many settlements, the northernmost being Novoselenginsk, which they occupied on 1 August. By then, Ungern had understood that his offensive was ill-prepared, and he had heard about the approach of large Red forces. On 2 August 1921, he began his retreat to Mongolia, where he declared his determination to fight communism.

While Ungern&#x27;s troops wanted to abandon the war effort, head towards Manchuria and join with other Russian émigrés, it soon became clear that Ungern had other ideas. He wanted to retreat to Tuva and then to Tibet. Troops under both Ungern and Rezukhin effectively mutinied and hatched plots to kill their respective commanders.

On 17 August, Rezukhin was murdered. A day later, conspirators attempted to assassinate Ungern. Ungern managed to evade the conspirators twice and retreated to a detachment made up exclusively of local Mongol soldiers. They did not want to take on the mutineers, nor side with Ungern and did not want to kill Ungern himself. They left him immobilized and fled. The rest of the brigade broke apart during its retreat towards the Chinese border (with the ultimate aim being the Far Eastern Republic). On 20 August, Ungern was captured by a Soviet detachment, led by guerrilla commander Petr Efimovich Shchetinkin, who was later a member of the Cheka. After a show trial of 6 hours and 15 minutes on 15 September 1921, prosecuted by Yemelyan Yaroslavsky, Ungern was sentenced to execution by firing squad. The sentence was carried out that night in Novonikolayevsk (now Novosibirsk).

When the news on the Baron&#x27;s execution reached the Living Buddha the Bogd Khan, he ordered services to be held in temples throughout Mongolia.

=== Geopolitical impact ===

In 2022, John Jennings, a history professor at the United States Air Force Academy, argued that Ungern was one of the worst military leaders ever. His campaigns in Mongolia were, at best, quixotic efforts to re-establish dead empires, marked by brutality and violence directed at not only his own troops but the local populace. They, ironically, made it easier for the Reds to further the reach of Soviet communism, a goal Ungern bitterly opposed. His expedition to Mongolia and conquest of Urga, by driving the Chinese out the country, also eliminated the one force in the region which might have been a match for the Red Army and made it inevitable that the Soviets would invade. The establishment of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic, the first Soviet satellite nation, after the death of the Bogd Khan in 1924 could not have happened without Ungern, Jennings writes.

=== 2020 statue controversy in Estonia ===
In late-2020, members of Blue Awakening, the former youth wing of the Conservative People&#x27;s Party of Estonia (EKRE) and the current Estonian Nationalists and Conservatives (Estonian: Eesti Rahvuslased ja Konservatiivid, abbr. ERK), formed an NGO called &quot;Ungern Khaan&quot; with the goal of promoting von Ungern-Sternberg&#x27;s memory. The group was subsequently granted €45 000 in funding by the three parties in the Estonian coalition government in power at the time, EKRE, the Estonian Centre Party, and Isamaa, to build a statue of von Ungern-Sternberg. After the funding was met with a backlash, the group announced that it would turn down the funding and rely on private donations instead.

<text>Iztok Čop (born 17 June 1972) is a Slovenian rower and Olympic gold medalist.

==Biography==
Čop was born in Kranj, SR Slovenia, and started rowing at the age of 13 in Bled, where Slovenia&#x27;s best rowing club is located.

Originally rowing in the coxless pairs, Čop finished second in the World Championships in 1991, and won Bronze at the Barcelona Olympics in 1992 with Denis Žvegelj (the first Olympic medal for independent Slovenia). He then switched to the single scull, winning gold at the 1995 World Championship, but came fourth at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996. He then changed to the men&#x27;s double sculls with Luka Špik, and won the 1999 World Championships, and gold at the Sydney Olympics in 2000, which was the first Olympic gold medal for Slovenia since its independence.

Špik and Čop were the favourites to repeat the victory in men&#x27;s double sculls at the 2004 Summer Olympics, but finished in the silver medal position.

Špik and Čop came into the 2012 Summer Olympics not as favorites; however, with a strong performance in the semifinals they became contenders for a medal. After taking an early lead and holding it until nearly the 1500 m mark, they lost the lead to the Italians and the later winners from New Zealand. They finished in third position, giving Slovenia its second medal of the Olympics after Urška Žolnir won the gold 2 days earlier.

In 2008 Čop became the fourth Slovenian to compete at five Olympics, after shooter Rajmond Debevec (eight Olympics) in 2000, biathlete/cross country skier Sašo Grajf in 2002, and biathlete Janez Ožbolt in 2006.

Čop lives in Radovljica with his wife Petra and daughters Ruby and Amber.

<doc id="911559" wikidata="Q241422" url="?curid=911559" title="Johann Hermann">
<text>Johann, or Jean-Frederic, Hermann, or Herrmann, (31 December 1738 in Barr, Alsace – 4 October 1800 in Strasbourg) was a French physician and naturalist.

In 1769 he was appointed professor of medicine at the School of Public Health of Strasbourg, then, in 1778, professor of philosophy, before going on, in 1784, to succeed Jacob Reinbold Spielmann as chair of chemistry, natural history and materia medica. In 1794 he became professor of botany and materia medica in the new School of Medicine.
He was the author of &quot;Tabula affinitatum animalium &quot; (1783) and &quot;Observationes zoologicae quibus novae complures&quot;, published posthumously in 1804.

His collections and library of 18,000 volumes formed the basis of the Natural History Museum of Strasbourg, where a reconstruction of his natural history cabinet was opened in 1988.

Hermann was also in charge of Strasbourg&#x27;s botanical garden, where he was responsible for a large increase in the number of living plant species. The garden was threatened with closure by the city administration during the French Revolution, and was only saved by the efforts of Hermann.
His zoological collection, including 200 mammals, 900 birds, more than 200 reptiles, many fish, invertebrates and dried plants, was bought by the city of Strasbourg in 1804 and served as the base for the Strasbourg zoological Museum.

His brother, Jean-Frédéric Hermann (1743–1820), Professor of Law, was a member of the Lower Rhine and Mayor of Strasbourg.

His son, Jean-Frédéric Hermann (1768–1793), would follow in his footsteps both in medicine and in natural history, until his untimely death during the revolutionary wars put an end to his ambitions.

Hermann&#x27;s name survives most famously through Hermann&#x27;s tortoise (&quot;Testudo hermanni&quot; ).

<text>James Gray (born April 14, 1969) is an American film director and screenwriter. Since his feature debut &quot;Little Odessa&quot; in 1994, he has made seven other features including &quot;We Own the Night&quot; (2007), &quot;Two Lovers&quot; (2008), &quot;The Immigrant&quot; (2013), &quot;The Lost City of Z&quot; (2016), (2019), and &quot;Armageddon Time&quot; (2022). Five of his films have competed for the at the Cannes Film Festival.

==Early life==
Gray was born in New York City and grew up in the neighborhood of Flushing. He is of Russian Jewish descent, with grandparents from Ostropol, Western Ukraine, which at that time was a part of the USSR. The original family name was &quot;Grayevsky&quot; or &quot;Greyzerstein.&quot; His father was once an electronics contractor. Gray attended the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts, where his student film, &quot;Cowboys and Angels&quot;, helped him get an agent and the attention of producer Paul Webster, who encouraged him to write a script which he could produce.

==Career==
=== 1990s ===
In 1994, at age 25, Gray made his first feature film &quot;Little Odessa&quot;, starring Tim Roth as a hit man confronted by his younger brother upon returning to his hometown, &quot;Little Odessa,&quot; a section of Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. The film won the Silver Lion at the 51st Venice International Film Festival.

In 1998, Gray began shooting his second film, &quot;The Yards&quot;, a crime drama set in the commuter rail yards in New York City. The film was released theatrically by Miramax two years later on October 12, 2000.

=== 2000s ===
In March 2006, Gray began production on his third film, &quot;We Own the Night&quot;, which he had been wanting to shoot since the early 2000s. Set in 1988, it stars Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Wahlberg as two brothers, one a nightclub manager with ties to the mob, and the former a police detective who wages an all-out war on drugs. The film screened in competition at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival in May, receiving widely divergent reviews from international critics, and was released theatrically in the U.S. in October.

After that film&#x27;s success, Gray was given creative freedom for &quot;Two Lovers&quot; which was loosely based on Fyodor Dostoevsky’s &quot;White Nights&quot;. The film made its premiere at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival.

=== 2010s ===
Gray co-wrote the screenplay for Guillaume Canet&#x27;s film &quot;Blood Ties&quot;, a remake of the French thriller &quot;Rivals&quot;. This collaboration with Canet led Gray to meeting his partner Marion Cotillard, whom he would cast in his next film &quot;The Immigrant&quot;. It tells the story of a Polish nurse who is separated from her sister at Ellis Island and forced into prostitution by a theater manager, played by Joaquin Phoenix. The film, which was previously titled &quot;Lowlife&quot; and &quot;The Nightingale&quot;, marked Gray&#x27;s fourth collaboration with Phoenix. It was nominated for the at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival.

In 2015, Gray directed a television commercial for Chanel men&#x27;s fragrance, &quot;Bleu de Chanel&quot;, starring Gaspard Ulliel. It was filmed in Los Angeles and released on February 5, 2015.

In October 2016, Gray&#x27;s film &quot;The Lost City of Z&quot; premiered at the New York Film Festival. The film, based on the book by David Grann, depicts the life of explorer Percy Fawcett, played by Charlie Hunnam.

At the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, it was reported that Gray would next direct his long-gestated sci-fi space epic . Brad Pitt signed on to star in April 2017 and the rest of the cast joined later that year. premiered at the Venice Film Festival on August 29, 2019 and was theatrically released in the United States on September 20, 2019 by 20th Century Fox. Gray later stated that the film that was released to theaters was not his cut.

=== 2020s ===
On June 17, 2020, it was officially confirmed that his next film, titled &quot;Armageddon Time&quot;, would be a coming-of-age drama loosely based on Gray&#x27;s childhood memories, with Anne Hathaway, Anthony Hopkins and Jeremy Strong cast in the film. The film had its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival on May 19, 2022 and was released in the United States on October 28, 2022 by Focus Features.

===Unrealized projects===
After &quot;Little Odessa&quot;, Gray was offered the script for &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Own&quot; by Brad Pitt, a friend of his. Gray turned it down and the film was ultimately directed by Alan J. Pakula. He also passed up the opportunity to direct &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;.

In 1997, Gray was in negotiations with producer Art Linson to direct the biopic &quot;Killer Spy&quot;, about CIA agent Aldrich Ames, based on the novel &quot;Betrayal&quot;. Kevin Spacey was being talked about for the starring role of Ames.

In 1999, Gray was in talks to direct Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston in &quot;Waking Up in Reno&quot; for Miramax. The film was made three years later but without the involvement of Gray, Pitt or Aniston.

It was reported in 2000 that Gray would direct and co-write &quot;Edgardo Mortara&quot;, a film based on the infamous 1858 kidnapping of the 6-year-old Jewish boy by the Papal police. Gray was to collaborate with writer Rob Eshman on the screenplay.

In 2003, it was rumored that Gray had written an adaptation of Philip K. Dick&#x27;s novelette &quot;Paycheck&quot;. Prior to John Woo being selected, Brett Ratner was in talks to direct. A film was released later that year, but Gray had no involvement.

In 2006, Gray was planning to direct &quot;Alphabet City&quot;, based on the 1995 novel by Steven Knight, who also penned the first draft of the script.

In 2010, Gray was hired to rewrite the script of the Charlie Hunnam-scripted &quot;Vlad&quot;, which would have been a period action film based on the story of Dracula. Anthony Mandler had been attached to direct the film.

In January 2011, it was reported that Gray would be directing a film adaptation of Mark Greaney&#x27;s novel &quot;The Gray Man&quot; written by Adam Cozad. The project was first set up at New Regency. Brad Pitt was initially cast to star, but by October 2015, he and Gray were no longer involved with the film.

In April 2011, Jeremy Renner enlisted Gray to write the screenplay for an untitled Steve McQueen biopic with Renner in the role under his production banner The Combine. &quot;I did it more or less as a favor to Jeremy and to honor Steve McQueen,&quot; Gray said. Heavily researched and based on two books by Marshall Terrill, &quot;Portrait of an American Rebel&quot; and &quot;The Life and Legend of a Hollywood Icon&quot;, the film was initially going to be directed by Ivan Zachariáš, although Gray later stated in 2013 that he may end up directing it himself at some point.

In August 2013, it was announced that Warner Bros. tapped Gray to write and direct &quot;White Devil&quot;, a film based on the life of John Willis.

It was reported in April 2015 by &quot;Variety&quot; that Gray was to executive produce and serve as creative consultant on &quot;Hard Apple&quot;, an &quot;adult-skewing&quot; animated series inspired by New York-born author Jerome Charyn&#x27;s Isaac Sidel novels.

In April 2018, MGM closed a deal for Gray to direct &quot;I Am Pilgrim&quot;, an adaptation of the espionage novel by Terry Hayes. He was slated to direct the film after he finished shooting . However, Gray confirmed in 2022 that the project is officially dead, and that it had got lost in the &quot;business mess&quot; with studios changing hands.

In April 2022, Gray announced plans to develop a limited series about novelist Norman Mailer based on J. Michael Lennon&#x27;s biography &quot;Norman Mailer: A Double Life&quot;.

In October 2022, Gray said he was interested in wrangling back the cast for a semi-sequel to &quot;Armageddon Time&quot;, to focus solely on his mother, who was portrayed by Anne Hathaway. &quot;The story goes in a very unexpected place,&quot; said Gray, &quot;Because my father actually did achieve some financial success but wound up getting it all confiscated by the government when he got into legal trouble. At the same time, my mother found out she was dying. And so, it&#x27;s going to be, I think, something about that period.&quot; That same month, &quot;Deadline&quot; reported that Gray&#x27;s next film would be a biopic about a young John F. Kennedy that focused on his time in World War II where he saved his crew from a sinking patrol boat. The film was titled &quot;Mayday 109&quot; and had been in development for several years before Gray boarded the project. Bill Skarsgård is attached to star as Kennedy.

In November 2022, Gray revealed in an interview for &quot;Collider&quot; that one of his dream projects was an epic about the Russian Revolution called &quot;The Dream of a Thousand Men&quot;, but that it was unlikely to be made anytime soon, if at all, due to Russia&#x27;s 2022 Ukraine invasion.

In March 2023, it was announced Gray would direct &quot;Ezekiel Moss&quot;, a Depression-set ghost story written by Keith Bunin, for Focus Features.

In February 2024, Gray replaced Neil Burger as the director of &quot;Summer Frost&quot;, based on Blake Crouch&#x27;s source material, which had first been announced back in 2020. Zoe Saldana is attached to star in the film.

In November 2024, it was reported that Gray had set his next film, &quot;Paper Tiger&quot;, described as a &quot;blue chip crime-drama-thriller&quot; with Adam Driver, Jeremy Strong and Anne Hathaway lined up to star. Based on Gray&#x27;s original screenplay, the story follows two brothers&#x27; pursuit of the American Dream—only to become entangled in a scheme that turns out to be too good to be true. They find themselves and their family brutally terrorized by the Russian &quot;Mafiya&quot;, and their bond begins to fray. Filming had been scheduled for the first quarter of 2025, financed fully by Leone Film Group.

In 2025, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; announced that Julia Roberts would be teaming with Gray for an adaptation of Peter Swanson&#x27;s forthcoming &quot;Kill Your Darlings&quot;, a murder mystery &quot;told in reverse.&quot;

Gray also turned down the role played by Noah Taylor in Wes Anderson&#x27;s &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot;. He did, however, appear in a brief cameo in a deleted scene in &quot;Love Jones&quot;.

==Opera==
In 2019, it was reported that Gray was to stage Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, his first opera, at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris that November. French fashion designer Christian Lacroix did the costumes for the production.

==Personal life==
Gray married Alexandra Dickson in 2005. The couple have three children.

<text>Georges Louis Duvernoy (6 August 1777, Montbéliard, Doubs – 1 March 1855) was a French zoologist. He assisted Georges Cuvier in writing &quot;Leçons d&#x27;anatomie comparée&quot;. He was elected a member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1847 and a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1851.

He studied in Stuttgart, Strasbourg, and Paris, and in 1802 was asked by Cuvier (a distant cousin) to help edit his masterpiece on comparative anatomy. From notes and counsel from Cuvier, Duvernoy prepared the last three volumes of &quot;Leçons d&#x27;anatomie comparée&quot;, writings that involved respiration, circulation, digestive organs, et al.

In 1805 he returned to Montbéliard, where he worked as a practitioner of medicine. In 1827 he was elected professor to the Faculty of Sciences at Strasbourg, and during the next ten years published a number of treatises on anatomical subjects. After the death of Cuvier in 1832, he worked at arranging his papers for publication. In 1837 he became a professor of natural history at the Collège de France.

<text>Presidential elections were held in São Tomé and Príncipe on 30 June 1996. The election was contested by four candidates; incumbent President Miguel Trovoada, former President Manuel Pinto da Costa, Alda Bandeira, a former Foreign Minister, and former Prime Minister Carlos da Graça. No candidate won a majority of votes in the first round, in which voter turnout in the first round was 77.3%, resulting in a second round being held on 21 July between the two leading candidates - Trovoada and da Costa. Trovoada won the election with 52.7% of the vote, based on a 78.7% turnout.

==Results==
==Aftermath==
Despite being declared generally free and fair by international and domestic observers, da Costa, who had initially acknowledged Trovoada&#x27;s victory, contested the results of the election, claiming that irregularities had occurred in the registration process. The National Electoral Commission acknowledged that there were minor discrepancies in the registration process and in voter rolls but determined that these were insufficient to call the results into question.

In early August the Supreme Court declared that it was unable to adjudicate on the appeal made by da Costa, and recommended that the government seek international legal arbitration. However, on 20 August da Costa withdrew his challenge and Trovoada was confirmed as president.

<doc id="911602" wikidata="Q855634" url="?curid=911602" title="Serowe">
<text>Serowe (population approximately 60,000) is an urban village in Botswana&#x27;s Central District. A trade and commercial centre, it is Botswana&#x27;s third largest village. Serowe has played an important role in Botswana&#x27;s history, as capital for the Bamangwato people in the early 20th century and as birthplace of several of Botswana&#x27;s presidents. More recently it has undergone significant development as the town and as Botswana continues to grow.

==History==
Serowe has a memorial to Khama III, chief of the Bamangwato people in the late 19th-early 20th century, who in 1903 founded the town as a new capital of the Bamangwato. They called the area Serowa after the bulb plant they found in the area, which was indicative of water. However, the name Serowe stuck because British settlers misspelt it, and the people agreed to keep it. The word Serowe does not exist in Setswana. It is also the birthplace of Seretse Khama, Botswana&#x27;s first president, and the traditional center of the Bamangwato tribe.

Swaneng Hill School was the first of the Brigades Movement schools founded by educationalist Patrick van Rensburg.

==Geography==
Serowe is located in a fertile area, well-watered by the Lotsane River. It lies west of the Gaborone–Francistown road, from which it is easily reached. It also marks the beginning of the Serowe-Orapa road, which ends at the diamond mines of Orapa. Construction of this road began in 1986 and was completed several years later.

There are two hills at Swaneng, called Rra-Swaneng and Mma-Swaneng – Father- and Mother-Swaneng – respectively.

Notable features of the local area include a Botswana Defence Force (BDF) base on the road to Paje and the Khama Rhino Sanctuary. The Rhino Sanctuary is a charitable game reserve, 25 km north of Serowe, established in 1992 by the local Ballentine and Watson families and Ian Khama (the former President). Its 4,300 hectares of Kalahari sandveld were established as a haven for black and white rhinoceroses.

==Government==

Serowe currently serves as capital of the Central District. The first president Sir Seretse Khama (father of the fourth President President Lieutenant General Ian Khama) and the third president Festus Mogae of Botswana were born in Serowe.

The Botswana Prison Service (BPS) operates the Serowe New Prison.

==Infrastructure==

Since 2000, Serowe has undergone numerous developments and continues to expand at a steady rate, despite exponential growth from neighbouring Palapye. The Swaneng Senior Secondary School, fondly referred to as Swaneng Hill, has been upgraded by the Botswana government through contract with a Chinese construction company. It now has relatively modern chemistry, physics and biology laboratories, although they lack equipment for in-depth experiments. As a result, student interest in the sciences has grown, with a number of students going overseas to continue their studies. The school&#x27;s history department regularly takes students on field trips to ancient sites around the country. Debating is highly encouraged, and has led to a number of national championship titles.

A major recent upgrade involved the construction of the new state-of-the-art Sekgoma Hospital, which is located 6 km to the south of the main town, replacing the old and derelict hospital of the same name. It now operates as the main medical centre in the district. The hospital was constructed at an estimated cost of P300 million and was opened to the public in late 2007, reducing a heavy burden at the Francistown Hospital, which was subject to overcrowding and unhygienic conditions. Adjacent to Sekgoma Memorial is the Institute of Health Sciences (IHS) Serowe Campus which provides training to health workers in various areas such as general nursing and health education. The Serowe IHS campus is one of the 6 campuses found at different major hospitals in Botswana. 

The Old Sekgoma Memorial Hospital has been refurbished and turned into a 24hr clinic that has sexual health and reproductive services Centre, chronic disease center, TB Clinic and District Drug hub.

Another major recent development is the Serowe Stadium and surrounding sports complex. This project, which cost the Botswana government P30 million, was opened in mid-2003. It currently provides the Central District with its only major sports facility.

The town used to be served by Serowe Airport. The airport location was used to build the now completed Sekgoma Memorial Hospital and the adjacent Nursing Institute.

==Literature==

Serowe was the adopted hometown of South African-born writer Bessie Head, inspiring her 1974 book &quot;&quot;. Her importance to the village is remembered in the Bessie Head Room of the Khama III Memorial Museum, established in 2007.

<text>Oktay Sinanoğlu (February 25, 1935 – April 19, 2015) was a Turkish physical chemist and molecular biophysicist who made contributions to the theory of electron correlation in molecules, the statistical mechanics of clathrate hydrates, quantum chemistry, and the theory of solvation.

==Early life and education==
Sinanoğlu was born in Bari, Italy on February 25, 1935. His parents were Rüveyde (Karacabey) Sinanoğlu and Nüzhet Haşim. His father Rüveyde was a writer, and a consular official in the Bari consulate of Turkey. Following his father&#x27;s recall to Turkey in July 1938, the family returned to Turkey before the start of World War II. He had a sister, Esin Afşar (1936-2011), who became a well-known singer and actress.

Sinanoğlu graduated from TED Ankara Koleji in 1951. He went to the United States in 1953, where he studied in University of California, Berkeley graduating with a BSc degree in 1956. The following year, he completed an MSc degree at MIT (1957), and was awarded a Sloan Research Fellowship. He completed a predoctoral fellowship (1958-1959) and earned his PhD in physical chemistry (1959-1960) at the University of California, Berkeley, advised by Kenneth Pitzer.

== Academic career ==
In 1960, Sinanoğlu joined the chemistry department at Yale University. He was appointed full professor of chemistry in 1963. At age 28, he became the youngest full professor in Yale’s 20th-century history. It has been claimed that he was also the third-youngest full professor in the 300-plus year history of Yale University.

During his tenure at Yale he wrote a number of papers in various subfields of theoretical chemistry, the most widely cited of which was his 1961 paper on electron correlation. This work anticipated the widely used coupled cluster method for describing electrons in molecules with greater accuracy than is possible via the Hartree-Fock method. He also published important papers on the statistical mechanics of clathrate hydrates, solvation, and surface tension. His final projects were focused on the development of his valency interaction formula (VIF) theory, a method for predicting energy level patterns for compounds from the manipulation of graphs (1983). He intended for chemists to be able to use his system to predict the ways in which complex chemical reactions would proceed, using only a chalkboard or pencil and paper. He continued to develop the VIF method, which he sometimes referred to as &quot;Sinanoğlu Made Simple,&quot; and other problems related to graph theory and quantum mechanics for the rest of his career. After 37 years on the Yale faculty, Sinanoğlu retired in 1997.

During his time at Yale, Sinanoğlu served as a consultant to Turkish universities, the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK), and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS). In 1962, the Board of Trustees of Middle East Technical University in Ankara granted him the title of &quot;consulting professor.&quot;

After his retirement from Yale, Sinanoğlu was appointed to the chemistry department of Yıldız Technical University in Istanbul, serving until 2002.

Sinanoğlu was the author or co-author of over 200 scientific articles and books. He also authored books on contemporary affairs in Turkey and Turkish language, such as &quot;Target Turkey&quot; and &quot;Bye Bye Turkish&quot; (2005). In &quot;Bye Bye Turkish&quot;, he propounded the idea of cognation between Turkish and Japanese based on the alleged similarity of a number of words.

A 2001 best-seller book about his life and works, edited by Turkish writer Emine Çaykara, referred to him as &quot;The Turkish Einstein, Oktay Sinanoğlu&quot; ().

== Honors ==
He received the &quot;TÜBİTAK Science Award&quot; for chemistry in 1966, the Alexander von Humboldt Research Award in chemistry in 1973, and the &quot;International Outstanding Scientist Award of Japan&quot; in 1975. It has been reported in Turkish media that Sinanoğlu was a two-time nominee for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, but this claim is not supported by actual data from the Nobel Foundation.

==Personal life and death==
On December 21, 1963, Oktay Sinanoğlu married Paula Armbruster, who was doing graduate work at Yale University. The wedding ceremony took place in the Branford College Chapel of Yale. They had three children. After their later divorce, he married Dilek Sinanoğlu and from this marriage he became the father of twins. The family resided in the Emerald Lakes neighborhood of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and in Istanbul, Turkey.

Dilek Sinanoğlu made public on April 10, 2015, that Oktay Sinanoğlu was hospitalized in Miami, Florida, and was in a coma in the intensive care unit. He died at age 80 on April 19, 2015. No medical statement was released about the cause of the death. His body was transferred to Turkey, where he was buried in Karacaahmet Cemetery, Üsküdar following the religious funeral service at Şakirin Mosque.

<text>Beatallica is a mash-up band that plays music made from combinations of songs of the Beatles and Metallica. A Beatallica song is typically a blend of a Beatles song and a Metallica song with a related title (e.g. &quot;The Thing That Should Not Let It Be&quot;, combining The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Let It Be&quot; and Metallica&#x27;s &quot;The Thing That Should Not Be&quot; or &quot;And Justice for All My Loving&quot; combining Metallica&#x27;s &quot;And Justice for All&quot; and the Beatles&#x27; &quot;All My Loving&quot;), though sometimes just a Beatles song will be used as a basis with modified lyrics. The lyrics slip back and forth between the two songs, or occasionally neither, in lieu of original lyrics comically referencing Metallica, heavy metal music, or the heavy metal community. While the scansion and melody are usually Beatles-based, the music is played metal style with some Metallica riffs and solos thrown in. Consistent quirks made in the lyrics also criticize glam metal much in the fashion that thrash metal fans would do, as well as many references to blood. Their version of &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; called &quot;I Want to Choke Your Band&quot;, is an example of their criticism towards glam metal.

Although facing some misunderstandings in the media, members of Metallica itself have repeatedly praised the comedic styling of the group. For example, Kirk Hammett has publicly remarked point-blank, &quot;I think it&#x27;s cool,&quot; and, &quot;It&#x27;s just fun for me.&quot; James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich have also been friendly with the band.

==History==
The project was founded in 2001 by original guitarist &quot;Krk Hammetson&quot; and singer &quot;Jaymz Lennfield&quot;. The EP &quot;A Garage Dayz Nite&quot; was recorded for the annual &quot;Spoof Fest&quot; concert held in Milwaukee, as a memento of that year&#x27;s concert. A few dozen copies of the EP were handed out to friends. Later that year, one of those CDs made its way to Milwaukee resident Dr. David Dixon, who created a web page that included mp3s of the songs and he named the band &quot;Beatallica&quot;. The band was unaware of the webpage until Dixon finally met them in the summer of 2002, carrying a stack of fan emails from all around the world. Beatallica gave the webpage its blessings, and after further urgings from its internet fanbase, recorded the EP &quot;Beatallica&quot;, also known as &quot;The Grey Album&quot;, releasing it online on April 1, 2004.

Later in 2004, the band (including bassist &quot;Kliff McBurtney&quot; and drummer &quot;Ringo Larz&quot;) started to perform at live venues nationally and internationally, with a stage show incorporating elements from both Beatles and Metallica performances. They also played as an opening act for Dream Theater; Mike Portnoy even joined the band on stage playing drums for one song.

During 2005 and 2006 the band toured around the world, playing over 60 shows, including their first UK show in London on April 26, 2006. Beatallica would go on to perform with likes of Motorhead, Testament, Kreator, Sepultura, LA Guns and play huge summer festivals worldwide, including Milwaukee&#x27;s Summerfest, Germany&#x27;s Earthshaker Festival, The Netherlands&#x27; Kings of Metal festival, and Korea&#x27;s Busan International Rock Festival.

In 2007, the band&#x27;s current lineup of Jaymz Lennfield (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Grg Hammetson (lead guitar), Kliff McBurtney (lead bass, backing vocals) and Ringo Larz (drums) went into the studio to re-record many of Krk and Jaymz&#x27; original songs and write some new compositions for their official debut &quot;Sgt. Hetfield&#x27;s Motorbreath Pub Band&quot;.

May 2008, marked the release of Beatallica&#x27;s single; &quot;All You Need Is Blood&quot; recorded in 13 languages as a worldwide thank-you to the network of Beatallica fans known as Beatallibangers. The band added Belgium, Czech Republic, and Poland to the list of places they have toured. Sgt. Hetfield&#x27;s Motorbreath Pub Band was released in Poland on the label Metal Mind Productions.

September and October 2008 saw the release of both album &quot;Sgt. Hetfield&#x27;s Motorbreath Pub Band&quot; and single &quot;All You Need Is Blood&quot; by Sony-ATV in Japan. Both Japanese CD versions contain bonus tracks.

On April 1, 2009, Beatallica met Metallica backstage after Metallica&#x27;s show in Paris. This was the first time that both bands had met each other in person. Both bands had communicated with each other over the years, as they continue to do so.

On August 4, 2009, &quot;Masterful Mystery Tour&quot;, the band&#x27;s second full-length album was released internationally. An official music video for the first single, Hero of the Day Tripper, was made with the band starring as hesh 1970&#x27;s superheroes saving a party from the clutches of four Big Sleazers.

On September 9, 2009, (September 11 in Germany) &quot;Masterful Mystery Tour&quot; was released by Sony-ATV in Japan. The Japanese album version includes 2 bonus tracks, live versions of &quot;I Want to Choke Your Band&quot; and &quot;Revol-ooh-tion&quot;, recorded live in concert in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
 The CD contains a bonus track, Beatallica&#x27;s cover of the JBO song &quot;Eine Guten Tag Zum Sterben&quot; (English translation: &quot;A Good Day for Dying&quot;). Also of note is fact that Beatallica recorded this cover song singing in German, making this the second song they have released singing in German. Beatallica&#x27;s cover version of the song was also included on the JBO 2009 album &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like Metal – I Love It&quot; (Limited Edition version that includes a bonus CD).

&quot;Winter Plunderband&quot; was released on November 17, 2009. It is Beatallica&#x27;s first ever Holiday Season release. The (EP) album is only available as a CD at Beatallica live shows (very limited pressing) and can also be purchased as a Digital Download which includes Digital Booklet with artwork, lyrics and photos (including Beatallica and Metallica together). The songs included are covers of Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Wonderful Christmastime&quot; and John Lennon and Yoko Ono&#x27;s &quot;Happy Christmas (War Is Over)&quot; and also the very first two Beatallica original songs &quot;Hella Day For Holiday&quot; and &quot;Heretic&quot;.

Beatallica toured Germany in December 2009 supporting JBO who were celebrating their 20th anniversary. During the tour Jaymz would join J.B.O on stage to sing &quot;Ein Guter Tag Zum Sterben&quot; in German. On the final night of the tour in Berlin, J.B.O. (mainly Vito C.) hijacked Beatallica&#x27;s set by playing AC/DC&#x27;s song &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; on guitar from backstage. Beatallica had no idea what was going on and thought a CD somehow was being played in error from the soundboard. During J.B.O.&#x27;s final set, Beatallica came out on stage wearing J.B.O.&#x27;s pink robes, which they stole from their dressing room, and took over the stage dancing around and drinking. Jaymz used a &#x27;Beatallica Arschwaschlappen&#x27; to wipe Hannes Holzmann&#x27;s face, much to the amusement of the sold-out audience.

March 5, 2009, saw the release for Beatallica&#x27;s second (and third) official video entitled &quot;Fuel on the Hill (and Benzin auf dem Berg)&quot;.

On April 16, 2013, Beatallica&#x27;s third album, &quot;Abbey Load&quot;, was released. Unlike other Beatallica albums, the songs on this album maintain the original lyrics written by the Beatles.

On November 12, 2021, their fourth album &quot;The Devolver Album&quot; was released, with a preview of the first song &quot;Wherever and Everywhere&quot; being released on the band&#x27;s official YouTube channel on October 1, 2021.

==Legal problems==
To avoid legal problems, the band maintained a strict non-commercial policy (all songs were available for free download) and shrouded themselves in anonymity (all names mentioned above are stage names, but their real names were revealed in interviews and, hence, also appear in this article). Metallica were aware of the spoof band&#x27;s existence and never threatened to take any legal action; Lars Ulrich, James Hetfield and Kirk Hammett have all publicly stated that they enjoy Beatallica&#x27;s music.

On February 17, 2005, a cease-and-desist notice was sent to David Dixon (and the band&#x27;s web host) by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, a company which holds rights to most of The Beatles&#x27; catalog. The notice states that the &quot;music&quot;, &quot;news&quot; and &quot;merchandise&quot; sections of the official Beatallica website constitute a copyright violation and should therefore be taken down. In response to this, a petition requesting Sony/ATV Music Publishing to retract its threat of legal action was created. The band was saved from further legal action by Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich, who offered to provide assistance with legal negotiations and also asked Metallica&#x27;s longtime attorney to try to defuse the situation with Sony. Sony ultimately reached an agreement with Beatallica and their new label Oglio Records, and an official Beatallica recording was released in July 2007 entitled &quot;Sgt. Hetfield&#x27;s Motorbreath Pub Band&quot;.

<text>South Africa competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s sixteenth overall and fourth consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics in the post-apartheid era. The South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (SASCOC) sent a total of 106 athletes to the Games, 66 men and 40 women, to compete in 19 sports. Field hockey was the only team-based sport in which South Africa had its representation at these Games. There was only a single competitor in archery, canoeing, diving, artistic and rhythmic gymnastics, judo, sailing, shooting, taekwondo, and wrestling.

The South African team featured four Olympic medalists from Sydney: breaststroke swimmer Terence Parkin, high jumper Hestrie Cloete, discus thrower Frantz Kruger, and hurdler Llewellyn Herbert. Several athletes made their third consecutive Olympic appearance, including freestyle Ryk Neethling and middle distance runner Hezekiél Sepeng, who previously won the silver in Atlanta for the men&#x27;s 800 metres. Sepeng&#x27;s fellow runner and teammate Mbulaeni Mulaudzi, a top medal contender on the same event, later became the nation&#x27;s flag bearer in the opening ceremony.

South Africa left Athens with a remarkable tally of six Olympic medals, one gold, three silver, and two bronze, being considered its most successful Olympics since the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. The highlight of the South African team at these Games came with a surprising triumph in men&#x27;s swimming, when Roland Mark Schoeman, Ryk Neethling, Lyndon Ferns, and Darian Townsend held a major upset on the Aussies, Americans, and the Dutch for a new world record and a prestigious gold medal in the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay. Furthermore, Schoeman completed a full set of medals to become the most decorated South African athlete at these Games, adding his silver in the men&#x27;s 100 m freestyle and bronze in the men&#x27;s 50 m freestyle. Cloete managed to repeat her silver from Sydney in the women&#x27;s high jump, while Donovan Cech and Ramon di Clemente claimed a bronze for the first time in men&#x27;s rowing.

Field hockey players Craig and Natalie Fulton became the first married couple to represent South Africa at the same Olympic Games.

<text>Australian Associated Press Ltd (AAP) is an Australian news agency. It was founded in 1935 by Keith Murdoch.

AAP employs around 90 journalists who work in bureaus in all states and territories of Australia except the Northern Territory. It also maintains correspondents in New Zealand and London as well as using a network of contributors from the US, Europe, Asia and Africa. AAP&#x27;s domestic news coverage is complemented by alliances with the major international news agencies.

AAP&#x27;s main focus is on breaking news but is also known for its court reporting, sport, political coverage, feature stories, and photographs. It also produces video and visual explainers. AAP is one of the few remaining non-government newswires in the world.

==History==

Australia was first linked to international telegraph services by a submarine cable that linked Java to Darwin, which was laid by the British-Australian Telegraph Company, and completed on 18 November 1871. The Eastern states were connected through Adelaide on the completion of the Australian Overland Telegraph Line in 1872. As a result, the time it took to transmit news from Europe to Australia was dramatically reduced, having previously taken weeks or months to arrive via post on ships, news could now be transmitted in just hours by telegraph. Anticipating that the cost of sending messages would be high, the Melbourne newspaper &quot;The Argus&quot; formed an association with the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, creating an agreement with the Reuters news agency for the transmission of news to Australia. This group successfully lobbied the Government of Victoria to pass the first copyright legislation of its kind in the world in 1871, protecting news material transmitted electronically for 24 hours from its first publication.

For a decade prior to 1895, three organisations supplied overseas news to Australia, The Argus group, The Age group, and the Reuters telegraph agency. In 1895, these services merged into the Australian Press Association, which had an exclusive contract with Reuters for its foreign newswire service. A 1909 Senate inquiry found that the association was a monopolistic cartel, and financed a short-lived alternative service. A competitor was established in 1911, called the United Cable Service, which competed for exclusive access to Reuters&#x27; foreign newswire service. Initially serving &quot;The Sun&quot; and &quot;The Herald&quot;, the service drew on the London newspaper &quot;The Times&quot;, and would be headed by Keith Murdoch from 1915 to 1921. The Australian Press Association and the United Cable Service agreed on an arrangement for shared access in 1926. In the early 1930s they set up an &#x27;omnibus&#x27; service, dividing routine work like court cases and ship movements. When several of the newspapers who were part of the Australian Press Association folded, the two services began discussions on merging. In 1935, Murdoch brokered a merger between the two competitors to cut down costs, which established the Australian Associated Press as a not-for-profit cooperative with 14 newspaper shareholders. The AAP had an initial staff of 12, with London and New York bureaus. Murdoch became the AAP&#x27;s first chairman, and would serve until 1940. Its charter laid out that the service was to provide:&quot;the most accurate and most searching information of all the world’s activities and thought without any tendency toward or opportunity for the exercise of political partisanship or bias&quot;.Initially, the AAP only functioned to provide overseas news to the Australian media, as major newspapers at the time had long-standing groups for local news syndication. In 1947, the agency became a shareholder in the Reuters telegraph agency, providing the AAP with windfall profits as well as representation on the Reuters board. In addition to its initial bureaux in London and New York, in the 1950s the AAP partnered with the Reuters telegraph agency to post AAP-Reuters correspondents in Asia. In the 1970s, the AAP began to offer federal parliamentary reporting from Canberra as well as court, sports, racing and stock market reporting. By 1972 the AAP had correspondents in Beijing, Los Angeles, Port Moresby, Saigon (today Ho Chi Minh City), Singapore, Suva and Wellington, as well as all Australian states and territories. At this time the AAP experienced a large growth in its newsroom, from 40 journalists in 1970 to 120 in 1980, and as a result of the AAP&#x27;s high-pressured environment there was also a high turnover of around 1000 journalists in that period.

The AAP launched a full domestic news service in 1980. It was also in the 1980s that the AAP switched from its not-for-profit model to become a commercial service. An attempt to take over the AAP by News Corp, now led by Keith Murdoch&#x27;s son Rupert Murdoch, by buying half of the shares of the then other largest shareholder Fairfax in 1988 was not allowed to proceed by the Trade Practices Commission. After 60 years of continuous reporting in the country, the AAP shut its bureau in Papua New Guinea in 2014, AAP&#x27;s departure from the country was criticised by academics and members of the local media for diminishing the quality and quantity of news about Papua New Guinea which made it to Australia. The AAP also closed down its Jakarta office in September 2017 after 35 years, opting to operate its Asia desk from Australia by using international newswires and freelance journalists. In June 2018, the AAP cut its editorial team by 25 staff, around 10% of its then around 220 person editorial personnel. After posting a $10.45 million loss in 2018, it achieved a $929,000 profit in 2019.

=== New Zealand Newswire ===
After the closure of the AAP&#x27;s New Zealand counterpart the New Zealand Press Association on 31 August 2011, the AAP launched a New Zealand Newswire (NZN) division on 5 September 2011 with offices in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. NZN employed 14 journalists split across Auckland and Wellington. NZN closed its digital news video team in September 2017. The AAP shut down its NZ Newswire division on 27 April 2018, and it was the final independent news agency in New Zealand to shut down, with the AAP retaining two full-time journalists in New Zealand.

===AAP 2.0===
On 20 March 2020, it was announced that AAP&#x27;s shareholders had decided to break up and shut down the newswire, saying that the service had become unsustainable in competition with free online content. However, at the last-minute before the service was set to close in June, AAP was bought by a consortium of impact investors and philanthropists led by Peter Tonagh, a former chief of News Corp and Foxtel. The group said they were motivated by a desire to support media diversity, and included Nick Harrington, the notable philanthropist John McKinnon, Fred Woollard the managing director of Samuel Terry Asset Management, and Kylie Charlton the managing director of Australian Impact Investments. The group was made up of 35 investors from five states. It was reported that the sale was made for the price of $1. In the year prior to its sale and restructure, the AAP reported a loss of $10 million, $5.4 million of that being from the newswire service.

The service was relaunched as a not-for-profit on 1 August 2020, under the same name, but has been referred to as &#x27;AAP 2.0&#x27; when making the distinction from the previous organisation. The newswire was bought by Acta Diurna AAP Limited, a legal entity founded by Harrington and McKinnon, the name referring to the public daily records of ancient Rome. It was later renamed Australian Associated Press Limited. The AAP&#x27;s editor Andrew Drummond remained in the role, Emma Cowdroy was appointed CEO after having previously acted the AAP&#x27;s senior legal counsel, making her the only woman at the head of a news agency internationally. Jonty Low was appointed to chair of the AAP board, becoming the first woman to hold the role, as well as the first board chair without a media background. Peter Tonagh became a member of the AAP&#x27;s board. Nick Harrington joined AAP&#x27;s executive team as head of strategy and development, a position he resigned from on 21 September 2020. After relaunching with fewer staff and more infrequent coverage, the AAP asked its existing customers to transition their contracts to the new company at the same rates.

==Operations==

While news outlets initially sourced content from the AAP predominantly for foreign news and war reporting, they became increasingly reliant on the service for domestic and breaking news. It has been noted that all major newspapers once reported from Canberra&#x27;s parliamentary press gallery, but in recent times often only AAP and ABC reporters were present. As a result, the AAP is increasingly seen as the silent partner of Australian news outlets, almost all of which publish increasing amounts of copy from the newswire.

By the 2010s it became common practice for newspapers to republish AAP copy, with minor edits and sometimes verbatim, sometimes including an &#x27;AAP&#x27; byline and at times omitting one. This practice of publishing AAP, and other newswire, copy with little to no changes has been referred to as &#x27;churnalism&#x27;. Content from the AAP is particularly prevalent on online news sites, as a way to cut down costs. A 2009 study found that the online breaking news sections of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Age&quot;, were more than half unchanged AAP reports, with the remainder predominantly sourced from international newswires, and suggested errors in AAP reporting are spread and republished in a homogeneous news environment. A 2013 study found that when the AAP reported on media relations output like press releases, it most often included little change from the original source, and as a result many newspapers were publishing media release content &#x27;recycled&#x27; through the AAP.

After the AAP&#x27;s 2020 sale and relaunch, its staff was reduced to around 80 editorial positions, and around 10 additional management, IT and support roles. On 5 September 2020, Emma Cowdroy the new chief executive of the AAP admitted that the company was facing significant financial challenges since its relaunch as a not-for-profit; this came about as a result of clients signing on for shorter periods awaiting the entrance of NCA Newswire, a new competitor owned by News Corp Australia a former large shareholder in the AAP, into the market when the companies non-compete clause ends in February 2021. The company appealed for crowd-funding donation from the public. The company also applied for a grant from the Public Interest News Gathering fund which had been started by the federal government, on 18 September 2020 it was announced that the AAP would receive $5 million in funds from the federal government.

== Services ==
In addition to their main newswire service, AAP also currently operates FactCheck a fact-checking service which is accredited by the Poynter Institute&#x27;s International Fact-Checking Network. FactCheck has a partnership with Facebook to verify content posted on the social media site.

===Past===
The AAP established AAPT, a telecommunications division offering long-distance voice and data services in 1991, which was spun off and sold to Telecom New Zealand in 2000. It was sold again to TPG Telecom in 2013. In the 1970s the AAP began its &#x27;Formguide&#x27; service, publishing horse racing information. In the 1980s it established &#x27;MediaNet&#x27;, a service for distributing press releases among journalists. The AAP bought &#x27;Pagemasters&#x27; a sub-editing business in 2002 from Bruce Davidson.

As part of AAP&#x27;s sale and relaunch in 2020, several divisions of the agency were spun off and retained by the agency&#x27;s prior owners Nine Entertainment, News Corp Australia, Seven West Media and Australian Community Media. This included &#x27;Medianet&#x27;, its media planning and public relations service; &#x27;Mediaverse&#x27;, a service for research and analysis of media; &#x27;ConnectWeb&#x27;, a directory service for biographical data; &#x27;Pagemasters&#x27;, a digital publishing and design service; and &#x27;Megaform&#x27;, which provides information about horse racing. The services were housed under the umbrella of a new company called Mediality, employing 130 staff, 95 being full-time roles, with the head office in Sydney moving into the News Corp Australia Building. Bruce Davidson, the former CEO of the AAP became the CEO of Mediality.

==Ownership==
In March 2020, it was announced that the AAP would cease trading in June of that year. In May 2020, a consortium headed by former News Corp executive Peter Tonagh entered negotiations to buy AAP. The sale was completed in June 2020 and was relaunched in August 2020. The AAP newswire was acquired by an independent, non-partisan Australian not-for-profit organisation in June 2020. As a not-for-profit organisation it does not have owners or shareholders. The exact ownership of the AAP since its 2020 sale and relaunch are unclear, as the terms of sale have not been released.

===Past===
From 2012 to 2020 when AAP become a non-profit, the AAP was jointly owned by 12 of the original 13 newspaper shareholders which established it in 1935, with those newspapers now being owned by various media conglomerates. Prior to its 2020 sale and relaunch the AAP was predominantly owned by: Nine Entertainment (45%), and News Corp Australia (45%), with Seven West Media and Australian Community Media as minor shareholders. News Corp and Nine formerly contributed in excess of $10 million annually, with minor shareholders Seven West Media and Australian Community Media contributing more than $1 million.

<doc id="911658" wikidata="Q1058762" url="?curid=911658" title="Reserve requirement">
<text>Reserve requirements are central bank regulations that set the minimum amount that a commercial bank must hold in liquid assets. This minimum amount, commonly referred to as the commercial bank&#x27;s reserve, is generally determined by the central bank on the basis of a specified proportion of deposit liabilities of the bank. This rate is commonly referred to as the cash reserve ratio or shortened as reserve ratio. Though the definitions vary, the commercial bank&#x27;s reserves normally consist of cash held by the bank and stored physically in the bank vault (vault cash), plus the amount of the bank&#x27;s balance in that bank&#x27;s account with the central bank. A bank is at liberty to hold in reserve sums above this minimum requirement, commonly referred to as &quot;excess reserves&quot;.

In some areas such as the euro area and the UK, tightening of reserve requirements in the home country is found to be associated with higher lending by foreign branches. For this reason, the reserve ratio is sometimes used by a country’s monetary authority as a tool in monetary policy, to influence the country&#x27;s money supply by limiting or expanding the amount of lending by the banks. Monetary authorities increase the reserve requirement only after careful consideration because an abrupt change may cause liquidity problems for banks with low excess reserves; they generally prefer to use other monetary policy instruments to implement their monetary policy. In many countries (except Brazil, China, India, Russia), reserve requirements are generally not altered frequently in implementing a country&#x27;s monetary policy because of the short-term disruptive effect on financial markets. In several countries, including the United States, there are today zero reserve requirements.

==Policy objective==
One of the critical functions of a country&#x27;s central bank is to maintain public confidence in the banking system, as under a fractional-reserve banking system banks are not expected to hold cash to cover all deposits liabilities in full. One of the mechanisms used by most central banks to further this objective is to set a reserve requirement to ensure that banks have, in normal circumstances, sufficient cash on hand in the event that large deposits are withdrawn, which may precipitate a bank run. The central bank in some jurisdictions, such as the European Union, does not require reserves to be held during the day, while in others, such as the United States, the central bank does not set a reserve requirement at all.

Bank deposits are usually of a relatively short-term duration, and may be “at call”, while loans made by banks tend to be longer-term, resulting in a risk that customers may at any time collectively wish to withdraw cash out of their accounts in excess of the bank reserves. The reserves only provide liquidity to cover withdrawals within the normal pattern. Banks and the central bank expect that in normal circumstances only a proportion of deposits will be withdrawn at the same time, and that the reserves will be sufficient to meet the demand for cash. However, banks routinely find themselves in a shortfall situation or may experience an unexpected bank run, when depositors wish to withdraw more funds than the reserves held by the bank. In that event, the bank experiencing the liquidity shortfall may routinely borrow short-term funds in the interbank lending market from banks with a surplus. In exceptional situations, the central bank may provide funds to cover the short-term shortfall as lender of last resort. When the bank liquidity problem exceeds the central bank’s desire to continue as &quot;lender of last resort&quot;, as happened during the global financial crisis of 2007-2008, the government may try to restore confidence in the banking system, for example, by providing government guarantees.

==Effects on money supply==

===Textbook view===
Many textbooks describe a system in which reserve requirements can act as a tool of a country’s monetary policy though these bear little resemblance to reality and many central banks impose no such requirements. The commonly assumed requirement is 10% though almost no central bank and no major central bank imposes such a ratio requirement.

With higher reserve requirements, there would be less funds available to banks for lending. Under this view, the money multiplier compounds the effect of bank lending on the money supply. The multiplier effect on the money supply is governed by the following formulas:

:formula_1 : definitional relationship between monetary base &quot;MB&quot; (bank reserves plus currency held by the non-bank public) and the narrowly defined money supply, formula_2,

:formula_3 : derived formula for the money multiplier &quot;m&quot;, the factor by which lending and re-lending leads formula_2 to be a multiple of the monetary base:

where notationally,

:formula_5 the currency ratio: the ratio of the public&#x27;s holdings of currency (undeposited cash) to the public&#x27;s holdings of demand deposits; and

:formula_6 the total reserve ratio (the ratio of legally required plus non-required reserve holdings of banks to demand deposit liabilities of banks).

This limit on the money supply does not apply in the real world.

===Endogenous money view===
Central banks dispute the money multiplier theory of the reserve requirement and instead consider money as endogenous. See endogenous money.

Jaromir Benes and Michael Kumhof of the IMF Research Department report that the &quot;deposit multiplier&quot; of the undergraduate economics textbook, where monetary aggregates are created at the initiative of the central bank, through an initial injection of high-powered money into the banking system that gets multiplied through bank lending, turns the actual operation of the monetary transmission mechanism on its head. Benes and Kumhof assert that in most cases where banks ask for replenishment of depleted reserves, the central bank obliges. Under this view, reserves therefore impose no constraints, as the deposit multiplier is simply, in the words of Kydland and Prescott (1990), a myth. Under this theory, private banks almost fully control the money creation process.

==Required reserves==

===China===

The People&#x27;s Bank of China uses changes in the reserve requirement as an inflation-fighting tool, and raised the reserve requirement ten times in 2007 and eleven times since the beginning of 2010.

===India===

The Reserve Bank of India uses changes in the CRR as a liquidity management tool, hiked it alongside SLR to navigate 2008 financial crisis. RBI introduced and withdrew Incremental - Cash reserve ratio I-CRR over and above CRR for managing liquidity.

==Countries and districts without reserve requirements==
Canada, the UK, New Zealand, Australia, Sweden and Hong Kong have no reserve requirements.

This does not mean that banks can—even in theory—create money without limit. On the contrary, banks are constrained by capital requirements, which are arguably more important than reserve requirements even in countries that have reserve requirements.

A commercial bank&#x27;s overnight reserves are not permitted to become &quot;negative&quot;. The central bank will step in to lend a bank funds if necessary so that this does not happen. Historically, a central bank might have run out of reserves to lend to banks with liquidity problems and so had to suspend redemptions, but this can no longer happen to modern central banks because of the end of the gold standard worldwide, which means that all nations use a fiat currency.

A zero reserve requirement cannot be explained by a theory that holds that monetary policy works by varying the quantity of money using the reserve requirement.

Even in the United States, which retained formal reserve requirements until 2020, the notion of controlling the money supply by targeting the quantity of base money fell out of favor many years ago, and now the pragmatic explanation of monetary policy refers to targeting the &quot;interest rate&quot; to control the broad money supply. (See also Regulation D (FRB).)

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, commercial banks are called clearing banks with direct access to the clearing system.

The Bank of England, the central bank for the United Kingdom, previously set a voluntary reserve ratio, and not a minimum reserve requirement. In theory, this meant that commercial banks could retain zero reserves. The average cash reserve ratio across the entire United Kingdom banking system, though, was higher during that period, at about 0.15% .

From 1971 to 1980, the commercial banks all agreed to a reserve ratio of 1.5%. In 1981 this requirement was abolished.

From 1981 to 2009, each commercial bank set out its own monthly voluntary reserve target in a contract with the Bank of England. Both shortfalls and excesses of reserves relative to the commercial bank&#x27;s own target over an averaging period of one day would result in a charge, incentivising the commercial bank to stay near its target, a system known as &quot;reserves averaging&quot;.

Upon the parallel introduction of quantitative easing and interest on excess reserves in 2009, banks were no longer required to set out a target, and so were no longer penalised for holding excess reserves; indeed, they were proportionally compensated for holding all their reserves at the Bank Rate (the Bank of England now uses the same interest rate for its bank rate, its deposit rate and its interest rate target). In the absence of an agreed target, the concept of excess reserves does not really apply to the Bank of England any longer, so it is technically incorrect to call its new policy &quot;interest on excess reserves&quot;.

===Canada===
Canada abolished its reserve requirement in 1992.

=== Australia ===
Australia abolished &quot;statutory reserve deposits&quot; in 1988, which were replaced with 1% non-callable deposits.

=== United States ===
In the Thomas Amendment to the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, the Fed was granted the authority to set reserve requirements jointly with the president as one of several provisions that sought to mitigate or prevent deflation. The power was granted to the Fed, without presidential consent, in the Banking Act of 1935. Under the International Banking Act of 1978, the same reserve ratios would apply to branches of foreign banks operating in the United States.

The United States removed reserve requirements for nonpersonal time deposits and eurocurrency liabilities on Dec 27, 1990 and for net transaction accounts on March 27, 2020, thus eliminating reserve requirements altogether. Before that, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System used to set reserve requirements (“liquidity ratio”) based on categories of deposit liabilities (&quot;Net Transaction Accounts&quot; or &quot;NTAs&quot;) of depository institutions, such as commercial banks including U.S. branches of a foreign bank, savings and loan association, savings bank, and credit union. For a time, checking accounts were subject to reserve requirements, whereas there was no reserve requirement on savings accounts and time deposit accounts of individuals. The Board for some time set a zero reserve requirement for banks with eligible deposits up to , 3% for banks up to , and 10% thereafter. The total removal of reserve requirements followed the Federal Reserve&#x27;s shift to an &quot;ample-reserves&quot; system, in which the Federal Reserve Banks pay member banks interest on excess reserves held by them.

The total amount of all NTAs held by customers with U.S. depository institutions, plus the U.S. paper currency and coin currency held by the nonbank public, is called M1.

<text>Riga Technical University (RTU) () is the oldest technical university in the Baltic countries established on October 14, 1862. It is located in Riga, Latvia and was previously known as &#x27;Riga Polytechnical Institute&#x27; and &#x27;Riga Polytechnicum&#x27;.

In 1958, the Riga Polytechnic Institute was established as a separate institution, separating the departments of engineering from the Latvian State University. Over the years, the Riga Polytechnic Institute evolved and expanded its academic offerings, becoming one of the leading technical universities in the region. In 1990, it was renamed Riga Technical University (RTU), and today, it has nine faculties and is the largest STEM oriented university in, Latvia.

In the 2022 QS EECA university rankings, RTU was ranked 57th among the universities in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.

==History==
===Riga Polytechnical Institute (1862–1918)===
Riga Polytechnicum was first established in 1862 and was the first poly technical institute in Imperial Russia. It offered degrees in agriculture, chemistry, engineering, mechanics, trade and architecture, with education in German.

In addition to four technical faculties (architecture, engineering, mechanical engineering, chemistry), the polytechnic also included an agricultural and a commercial faculty. The first lecturers came from Germany, Switzerland and Austria-Hungary. The language of instruction was German.

Between 1863 and 1869, the number of students grew from sixteen to ninety. In 1869 the polytechnic moved into a new building. Since there was a lack of technical universities in Russia, many students – especially from the Baltic Sea governments – had gone to study at ETH Zurich, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, TU Dresden and Leibniz University Hannover. That should be changed. On January 1, 1874, Alexander II of Russia introduced general conscription. Now all men from the age of 21 had to serve fifteen years, six in Imperial Russian Army and nine in the reserve. For graduates of the Russian university who wanted to study, the period of service was only six months. This difference led to a significant increase in student numbers. At the beginning of the academic year 1874/75, 59 students enrolled, the total student body comprised 201 members. In the course of Russification, Nicholas II of Russia nationalized the university by decree of May 6, 1896. From 1896 to 1918 it was called the Riga Polytechnic Institute (Rīgas Politehniskais institūts – RPI). The number of students continued to increase, reaching 2088 students in 1913/14. In 1918/19 the Polytechnic was called the Baltic Technical University (Baltijas Tehniskā augstskola).

In 1896, it was renamed Riga Polytechnical Institute and the language of instruction was changed to Russian. The establishment of a faculty of architecture at the Polytechnicum in 1869 was instrumental in providing Riga with a group of locally trained architects, with consequences for the development of the characteristic Art Nouveau architecture in Riga.

When World War I started in 1914, the Riga Polytechnical Institute was evacuated to Moscow and worked there until 1918. After that, part of the faculty returned to Latvia and joined the newly established University of Latvia.

In 1919, the university was incorporated as a technical faculty of the Latvian University of Applied Sciences (Latvijas Augstskola, since 1923: University of Latvia), which was founded after independence. On September 1, 1958, their technical faculties were spun off again and raised to an independent university. From 1958 to 1983 it was called the Riga Polytechnic Institute, and then renamed the Arvīds Pelše Institute of Technology in Riga (). In the mid-1970s, the university became the largest university in the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic. It has been called the Riga Technical University since March 1990. On April 23, 1992, a student parliament was founded. It is the oldest student self-government in Latvia.

=== Riga Technical University (1958–present) ===
Riga Polytechnical Institute was re-established in 1958 by splitting off the engineering departments from the State University of Latvia. In 1990, it was renamed to Riga Technical University. The university currently consists of 9 faculties:

The Riga Business School is a management–education institution within Riga Technical University. It was founded in 1991, in close cooperation with the State University of New York at Buffalo (USA) and the University of Ottawa (Canada), and it was the first higher education institution in the Baltic states that offered Master of Business Administration (MBA) programs in English.

The school currently has more than 800 MBA graduates, mostly middle- and upper-level managers both in Latvia and abroad. The education standards and structure are adopted from the North-American style MBA, which contains case studies, working in groups, and active participation in classrooms.

== Rankings ==
In March 2017, RTU announced that it had won the first place among universities in Latvia in the international U-Multirank rating. The employment of RTU graduates is rated the highest (at the A level). The same evaluation was given to the university for bachelor&#x27;s programs in English, for self-created or spin-off companies, for the post-doctoral study process and creativity in science.

RTU is also the highest rated Latvian higher education institution «Times Higher Education Rating» in the 2020 Sustainability Assessment, which evaluates the performance of universities in sustainable development. place in the group of the highest rated universities.

<doc id="911666" wikidata="Q413386" url="?curid=911666" title="Vivianite">
<text>Vivianite () is a hydrated iron(II) phosphate mineral found in a number of geological environments. Small amounts of manganese Mn2+, magnesium Mg2+, and calcium Ca2+ may substitute for iron Fe2+ in its structure. Pure vivianite is colorless, but the mineral oxidizes very easily, changing the color, and it is usually found as deep blue to deep bluish green prismatic to flattened crystals. Vivianite crystals are often found inside fossil shells, such as those of bivalves and gastropods, or attached to fossil bone. Vivianite can also appear on the iron coffins or on the corpses of humans as a result of a chemical reaction of the decomposing body with the iron enclosure.

It was named by Abraham Gottlob Werner, the &quot;father of German geology&quot;, in 1817, the year of his death, after either John Henry Vivian (1785–1855), a Welsh-Cornish politician, mine owner and mineralogist living in Truro, Cornwall, England, or after Jeffrey G. Vivian, an English mineralogist. Vivianite was discovered at Wheal Kind, in St Agnes, Cornwall.

== Vivianite group ==
Vivianite group minerals have the general formula A3(XO4)2·8H2O, where A is a divalent metal cation and X is either phosphorus or arsenic, and they are monoclinic. 

Group members are:

: Related:
: – Bobierrite: Mg3(PO4)2·8H2O
: – Symplesite: Fe2+3(AsO4)2·8H2O
: – Metaköttigite: Zn3(AsO4)2·8H2O
: – Metavivianite: (Fe2+,Fe3+)(PO4)2(OH)·H2O.
: Note: Metavivianite, that vivianite readily alters to, is not a member of the vivianite group because it contains trivalent Fe3+ cations.

== Structure ==
In pure end member vivianite all the iron is divalent, Fe2+, but there are two distinct sites in the structure that these ions can occupy. In the first site, the Fe2+ is surrounded by four water molecules and two oxygens, making an octahedral group. In the second site, the Fe2+ is surrounded by two water molecules and four oxygens, again making an octahedral group. The oxygens are part of the phosphate groups (PO43−), that are tetrahedral. The vivianite structure has chains of these octahedra and tetrahedra that form sheets perpendicular to the a-crystal axis. The sheets are held together by weak bonds, and that accounts for the perfect cleavage between them.

The crystals are monoclinic, class 2/m, space group C 2/m, with two formula units per unit cell (Z = 2). The approximate values of the unit cell parameters are: 
:a = 10.1 Å, b = 13.4 Å, c = 4.7 Å and β = 104.3°,
with slightly different values given by different sources:

: a = 10.086 Å, b = 13.441 Å, c = 4.703 Å, β = 104.27° 
: a = 10.06 Å, b = 13.41 Å, c = 4.696 Å, β = 104.3°
: a = 10.034–10.086 Å, b= 13.434–13.441 Å, c= 4.687–4.714 Å, β = 102.65–104.27°
: a = 10.024(6) Å, b = 13.436(3) Å, c = 4.693(4) Å, β = 102.30(5)°

== Appearance ==
The mineral may occur as crystals, or as masses or concretions. The crystals are usually prismatic parallel to the c-crystal axis, and flattened perpendicular to the b-axis. Equant crystals are rarer. They may also occur as stellate (star-shaped) groups, or encrustations with a bladed or fibrous structure. 
Unaltered specimens are colorless to very pale green, but they oxidize on exposure to light (and possibly also in situ) to blue, then darker green, brown, purple and purplish black. The streak is white, altering to dark blue or brown. Crystals are transparent to translucent with a vitreous luster, pearly on the cleavage surface, or dull and earthy.

== Optical properties ==
Vivianite is biaxial (+) with refractive indices approximately: 
:nα = 1.58, nβ = 1.6, nγ = 1.6, but different sources give somewhat different values
:nα = 1.579, nβ = 1.602, nγ = 1.637 
:nα = 1.579–1.616, nβ = 1.602–1.656, nγ = 1.629–1.675
:nα = 1.58–1.626, nβ = 1.598–1.662, nγ = 1.627–1.699

Birefringence: δ = 0.050–0.059 or 0.0470–0.0730

The refractive indices increase with increasing oxidation, the birefringence decreases, and the pleochroism on {010} becomes stronger.

The angle between the optic axes, 2V, has been measured as between 63° and 83.5°; it can also be calculated from the refractive indices, giving a value between 78° and 88°. The dispersion of the optic axes is weak, with r&lt;v, or non-existent. 
Vivianite is pleochroic with X= blue, deep blue or indigo-blue; Y= pale yellowish green, pale bluish green or yellow-green; Z= pale yellowish green or olive-yellow. X is parallel to the b-crystal axis and Z is inclined to the c-crystal axis at an angle of 28.5°. It is not fluorescent.

== Physical properties ==
Vivianite is a soft mineral, with Mohs hardness only to 2, and specific gravity 2.7. It splits easily, with perfect cleavage perpendicular to the b-crystal axis, due to the sheet-like structure of the mineral. It is sectile, with a fibrous fracture, and thin laminae parallel to the cleavage plane are flexible. It is easily soluble in acids. 
It has a melting point of , it darkens in color in H2O2, and is not radioactive.

== Geological setting ==
Vivianite is a secondary mineral found in a number of geologic environments: the oxidation zone of metal ore deposits, in granite pegmatites containing phosphate minerals, in clays and glauconitic sediments, and in recent alluvial deposits replacing organic material such as peat, lignite, bog iron ores and forest soils (all). Bones and teeth buried in peat bogs are sometimes replaced by vivianite. Some authors say that it is particularly associated with gossan, but this is disputed by Petrov.

Associated minerals include metavivianite, ludlamite, pyrite, siderite and pyrrhotite. 
Hydrothermal veins produce the best crystal specimens with the classic gemmy green color.

The type locality is Wheal Kind (Wheal Kine), West Wheal Kitty group, St Agnes, St Agnes District, Cornwall, England.

== Photo-oxidation ==
Oxidation of vivianite is an internal process; no oxygen or water enters or leaves the mineral from the outside. A visible light photon knocks a proton out of a water molecule, leaving a hydroxide ion (OH−). In turn, a divalent iron Fe2+ loses an electron to become Fe3+, i.e., it is oxidized and balances the charge. This process starts when visible light falls on the vivianite, and it can occur within a few minutes, drastically changing the color of the mineral. Eventually, the vivianite changes to a new species, metavivianite Fe2+2Fe3+(PO4)2(OH)·7H2O, which usually occurs as paramorphs after vivianite.

== Pigment ==
Vivianite was known as a pigment since Roman times, but its use in oil painting was rather limited. It has been found in Vermeer&#x27;s &quot;The Procuress&quot; in the blue-grey parts of the carpet in the foreground.
== Localities ==
* Brazil. Cigana Mine, Galileia, Minas Gerais, with muscovite and pyrite. Typically wedge-shaped crystals of vivianite to 11 cm across, of medium lustre, smoke-blue color and good transparency on matrix of sharp silvery muscovite plates, some with druses of pyrite microcrystals. 
* Bolivia: Llallagua, Potosi: Crystals to 10 cm at the Siglio XX mine. Transparent bottle-green crystals to 10 cm from the San Jose/San Firmin vein. In general, the vivianite occurs as prismatic crystals on a matrix of botryoidal goethite derived from the alteration of pyrite and marcasite. Specimens found in 2000 were associated with childrenite, cronstedtite, pyrrhotite, franckeite and pink massive sphalerite.

<text>Eduard &quot;Edi&quot; Strauss (15 March 1835 – 28 December 1916) was an Austrian composer who, together with his brothers Johann Strauss II and Josef Strauss made up the Strauss musical dynasty. He was the son of Johann Strauss I and Maria Anna Streim. The family dominated the Viennese light music world for decades, creating many waltzes and polkas for many Austrian nobility as well as dance-music enthusiasts around Europe. He was affectionately known in his family as &#x27;Edi&#x27;.

==Life and music==

Eduard Strauss&#x27; style was individual and did not attempt to emulate the works of his other brothers or his contemporaries. But he was primarily remembered and recognized as a dance music conductor rather than as a major composer in the , and his popularity was overshadowed by that of his elder brothers. Realising this, he stamped his own mark with the quick polka, known in German as the &quot;polka-schnell&quot;. Among the more popular polkas that he penned for the Strauss Orchestra, which he continued to conduct until its disbandment on 13 February 1901, were &quot;&quot;, Op. 45, &quot;Ausser Rand und Band&quot;, Op. 168, and &quot;Ohne Bremse&quot;, Op. 238. He also found time to pen a few lovely waltzes, of which only a handful survived obscurity. The most famous is probably &quot;Doctrinen&quot;, Op.79. 

Strauss&#x27;s musical career was pervaded with rivalry, not only from his brothers, but also from the military bandmaster and dance music composer Karl Michael Ziehrer, who even formed a rival orchestra called &quot;Formerly Eduard Strauss Orchestra&quot;, and began giving concerts in Vienna under this new title. Eduard Strauss successfully filed a court action against Ziehrer for the improper and misleading use of his name, but Ziehrer would eventually surpass the Strauss family in popularity in Vienna, particularly after the deaths of his more talented brothers, Johann Strauss II and Josef Strauss. Their rivalry was to extend until the Strauss Orchestra was disbanded. 

Strauss married Maria Klenkhart on 8 January 1863 and had two sons, Johann Strauss III and Josef Eduard Strauss. The elder son, Johann Strauss III, was to lead the Strauss revival well into the 20th century. Josef Eduard&#x27;s son, Eduard Strauss II, was active as a conductor.

However, personal setbacks in the 1890s, such as the death of brother Johann Strauss II in 1899, and his realization that his immediate family had squandered his personal fortune, led Eduard Strauss to decide on retirement. Eduard Strauss engaged in the final tour of his musical career to North America in 1899 and in 1901, disbanded the Strauss Orchestra, and returned to Vienna, where he died in 1916. He retired from public life and never actively took part in any public musical activity, although he did document his family memoirs titled &quot;Erinnerungen&quot; in 1906. He is buried in Zentralfriedhof (Vienna) cemetery.

Since 1825, the Strauss Orchestra Archives collected the compositions of not only Eduard, but of Johann II and the rest of the Strauss family. In October 1907, Eduard presided over the burning of many Strauss family musical manuscripts. Eighty years later, conductors Alfred Walker and Klaus Heymann managed to put together a semi-complete collection of Johann&#x27;s works (according to Johann Strauss II: The Complete Orchestral Edition).

<doc id="911677" wikidata="Q1561608" url="?curid=911677" title="Heiti">
<text>A heiti (Old Norse &quot;heiti&quot; , Modern Icelandic , pl. &quot;heiti&quot; &quot;name, appellation, designation, term&quot;) is a synonym used in Old Norse poetry in place of the normal word for something. For instance, Old Norse poets might use &quot;jór&quot; &quot;steed&quot; instead of the prosaic &quot;hestr&quot; &quot;horse&quot;.

==Kennings==

In the modern sense, heiti are distinguished from kennings in that a heiti is a simple word, whereas a kenning is a circumlocution in the form of a phrase or compound word; thus &quot;mækir&quot; is a heiti for &quot;sword&quot; (the usual word in prose is &quot;sverð&quot;), whereas &quot;grand hlífar&quot; &quot;bane of shield&quot; and &quot;ben-fúrr&quot; &quot;wound-fire&quot; are kennings for &quot;sword&quot;.

However, Snorri Sturluson, writing in the 13th century, understood heiti in a broader sense that could include kennings. Snorri termed simple words, poetic or otherwise, &quot;ókend heiti&quot; &quot;unqualified terms&quot;. These he distinguished from circumlocutions, &quot;kend heiti&quot; &quot;qualified terms&quot; (i.e. kennings).

==Types==

Some heiti are words not normally found outside verse, e.g. &quot;fírar&quot;, one of numerous synonyms for &quot;menn&quot; &quot;men, people&quot;. Others are common enough in prose but used by the poets in some specialised sense, such as &quot;salt&quot; &quot;salt&quot; to mean &quot;sjár&quot; &quot;sea&quot;.

Heiti had a variety of origins. Some were archaic words: &quot;jór&quot; &quot;steed&quot;, some loanwords: &quot;sinjór&quot; &quot;lord&quot; (from Latin &quot;senior&quot;, probably via Old French &quot;seignor&quot;). Several kinds of synecdoche and metonymy were employed: &quot;barð&quot; &quot;part of the prow of a ship&quot; for &quot;ship&quot; as a whole; &quot;gotnar&quot; &quot;Goths&quot; for &quot;men&quot; or &quot;people&quot; in general; &quot;targa&quot; &quot;targe&quot; (a type of shield) for &quot;shield&quot; in general; &quot;stál&quot; &quot;steel&quot; for &quot;weapons, warfare&quot;. A few heiti were metaphorical: &quot;hríð&quot; &quot;storm&quot; for &quot;attack, (onset of) battle&quot;. Some were originally proper names: &quot;Hrotti&quot;, &quot;Laufi&quot;, &quot;Mistilteinn&quot; and &quot;Tyrfingr&quot; were all swords owned by legendary heroes. There were also heiti for specific individuals, especially gods (e.g. &quot;Grímnir&quot;, &quot;Fjölnir&quot;, &quot;Viðrir&quot; and many more for Odin).

There were a great many heiti for certain concepts which the poets often dealt with, such as &quot;man&quot;, &quot;woman&quot;, &quot;leader&quot;, and terms for weapons. Names of &quot;sækonungar&quot; &quot;sea-kings&quot; (legendary pirate leaders) constitute another large category. From these were formed kennings for &quot;sea&quot; and &quot;ship&quot;, e.g. &quot;Rakna bifgrund&quot; &quot;Rakni&#x27;s shaking ground&quot; = &quot;the sea&quot;; &quot;Þvinnils dýr&quot; &quot;Thvinnil&#x27;s beast&quot; = &quot;ship&quot;.

==Parallels==

Analogous, and in some cases cognate terms, are found in the poetic traditions of other early Germanic languages, e.g. Old English &quot;guma&quot;, &quot;secg&quot;: Old Norse &quot;gumi&quot;, &quot;seggr&quot; &quot;man&quot;; Old English &quot;heoru&quot;, &quot;mēce&quot;: Old Norse &quot;hjǫrr&quot;, &quot;mækir&quot; &quot;sword&quot;. Many other languages, ancient and modern, have possessed a specialised poetic vocabulary more or less removed from everyday speech, often derived in similar ways to Old Norse heiti.

<doc id="911681" wikidata="Q375487" url="?curid=911681" title="Sun Jihai">
<text>Sun Jihai (; ; born 30 September 1977) is a Chinese former professional footballer who played in the English Premier League. Sun is one of the most well-known footballers in East Asia, as he is the first East Asian footballer to score in the Premier League when he scored a goal for Manchester City in 2002, and also the first Chinese footballer to score in the UEFA Cup. Sun was a member of the China national team that qualified for the 2002 FIFA World Cup.

Sun founded Beijing Haiqiu Technology Company (HQ Sports) in February 2016, while he still played for Beijing Renhe in the China League One division. Subsequently, in December of the same year, Sun ended his 22 years of professional football career by announcing his official retirement in a public event. Also at the same occasion, Sun announced the successful first round funding of his company, led by China Media Capital (CMC), Tencent and Yuan Xun Fund. HQ Sports has now developed to a staff force of more than 100 and with focus on Sports Technology, Media and Datatainment business in China and Worldwide.

==Club career==
===Dalian Shide===
Sun Jihai started his football career with Dalian Shide in 1995 and made his first appearance on 28 May 1995 against Sichuan Quanxing. Like many of the top young Chinese players of his generation, he wanted to go to the Chinese youth training camp in Brazil that was sponsored by Jianlibao. However, he was not selected as he was not deemed to possess enough potential. Sun showed great character by not letting this huge disappointment derail him and worked very hard to establish himself at his club. Sun enjoyed a successful spell with Dalian as the club won four league titles and one Chinese FA Cup title during his time there.

===Crystal Palace===
After three successful years at Dalian Shide, Sun along with Fan Zhiyi signed for Crystal Palace in August 1998. They became the first ever Chinese footballers to play in the English leagues. Sun made his debut for Crystal Palace in a 3–0 loss against Bury in the first leg of a 1998–99 Football League Cup match. He was recalled by Dalian who struggled heavily at the bottom of the league in the 1999 season.

===Manchester City===
In February 2002, Sun signed for the English side Manchester City from Crystal Palace for £2 million and became the first Asian player to sign for the club. He made his debut for the club in a 4–2 win against Coventry City. His solid defence and dangerous attacking forays won over many City fans. He was voted the best player for the club in September 2002. In October 2002, Sun became the first East Asian footballer to score in the Premier League when he headed home the first goal in a 2–0 win over Birmingham City.

At the beginning of the 2004–05 season, Sun damaged his cruciate ligaments in a tackle with Chelsea striker Eiður Guðjohnsen and missed the rest of the season. After recuperating and following a strict physical regimen devised by his father, Sun re-installed his place as a regular in the club&#x27;s starting lineup. In the 2006–07 season, Sun was set back yet again by another injury and he made his return on 10 February 2007, against Portsmouth which his side lost 2–1. With the arrival of Sven-Göran Eriksson as the new manager, Sun rarely played in the 2007–08 season. Sun played 14 games and only started 7 times in that season. He was replaced by Vedran Ćorluka at right back and Michael Ball played as the defensive substitute instead of Sun.

===Sheffield United===
On 2 July 2008, Sun signed a two-year deal with English Championship club Sheffield United. Sun only managed nineteen minutes in his first match for Sheffield United, getting sent off after picking up two yellows in a friendly. He went on to make his full debut in the opening fixture of the 2008–09 season against Birmingham City.
He was sent off during a game against Coventry City after a lunging tackle from behind on opposing player Michael Mifsud. The Football Association charged him for his behavior after receiving a red card even with his past good disciplinary record and handed him an additional one-match ban. Having played regularly until November he succumbed to an injury and subsequently failed to force his way back into the first team and made only a handful of appearances in the FA Cup in the second half of the season. Sun was then released from his contract in July 2009 with Sheffield United claiming he had &quot;failed to settle&quot; in Yorkshire.

===Return to China===
In July 2009, Sun was loaned to Sheffield United&#x27;s satellite team Chengdu Blades in the Chinese Super League, hoping to make an impact. He steadily established himself at Chengdu and helped them to achieve the club&#x27;s best ever league position at seventh place. However, the club was relegated to China League One in the fallout of a match fixing scandal. He returned to Sheffield United after the loan was finished, but his contract ended and was left without a club to play for.

On 8 January 2010, Sun signed a two-year contract with fellow top tier side Shaanxi Chanba. He was promoted as the team captain immediately and he extended his contract for another two years in December 2011. At the beginning of the 2012 season, Sun followed the club when it decided to move to Guizhou and rename themselves Guizhou Renhe. He played nineteen league matches and five Chinese FA Cup matches in the 2012 season as the club achieved fourth place that league season and were runners-up in the cup which gained them entry into AFC Champions League for the first time in the club&#x27;s history.

On 4 February 2015, Sun moved to fellow top tier side Chongqing Lifan on a free transfer. He made his debut for the club on 8 March 2014 in a 3–0 loss against Beijing Guoan.

On 8 December 2015, Sun returned to second tier side Beijing Renhe on a free transfer.

On 10 December 2016, Sun announced his retirement from football.

==International career==
Sun made his international debut for the China national team on 6 December 1996 against Uzbekistan. At the 2002 FIFA World Cup in a group stage match against Costa Rica, Sun picked up an ankle injury after a tackle from behind by Mauricio Solís after just 17 minutes. Unable to play, Sun was replaced after 25 minutes and sat out the rest of the group stage, while Solís was only shown a yellow card. On 7 June 2008, during a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Qatar, Sun was shown a straight red card for dissent while he was warming up as a substitute on the bench. China lost the match 1–0. He was given a ban of five matches by FIFA and did not receive any call-ups to the national team after this incident.

<text>NOMA was a company best known for making Christmas lights. It was once the largest manufacturer of holiday lighting in the world. As of 2021, the rights to the brand in Canada and the United States are owned by Canadian Tire, which sells NOMA-branded products through its namesake stores in Canada, and through an e-commerce website in the United States.

== History ==

=== Background ===
Electric Christmas lights were first used in 1882, but were not commercially available until around 1901, with pre-wired sets available by 1903. By 1920 they were popular, with a range of small and large manufacturers. The lighting sets, or &quot;outfits&quot;, were of fixed length, with only limited and difficult to use options available to use more than one string together.

In 1921, Lester Haft filed a patent for a system to interconnect multiple strings. Several small companies licensed the patent from Haft&#x27;s employer, C. D. Wood Electric. Morris Propp, whose company was the largest manufacturer of the Christmas light outfits, developed a competing interconnection system, and filed his own patent. The Haft patent () was granted in 1924, and Propp&#x27;s () in 1926. Before either was granted, some companies licensed the Haft patent, while others developed their own systems that may have been in violation of one or both pending patents.

=== Formation ===
In late 1925, Joseph Bloch and Albert Sadacca organized a trade association of 15 of the Haft patent licensees, all small manufacturers, including C. D. Wood. Block named the trade group National Outfit Manufacturer&#x27;s Association, or N. O. M. A., and later, simply NOMA. By joining, the companies could consolidate purchasing and gain other efficiencies to improve their competitiveness. This was successful for the 1925 and 1926 seasons, and by the end of 1926, the companies agreed to formally merge into a single manufacturer bearing the NOMA name. NOMA branded light outfits were sold starting in the 1927 season.

Ironically, most of the original partners who formed NOMA were Jewish, and did not celebrate Christmas. Electric Christmas lights started as product line within their novelty or electrical businesses, before coming to dominate their endeavors.

Joseph Block was the first president of the company. In 1928, Propp agreed to merge his company into NOMA, and displaced Block as its president in 1929. He continued to lead the company until his 1933 death from brain cancer, and was then succeeded by Henry Hyman.

=== Fight for control ===
The company was originally based at 340 Hudson Street in New York City. When its lease ended in 1932 it moved to a building owned by Propp at 524 Broadway. That building already housed Propp&#x27;s original Propp Electrical business, which had become a subsidiary of NOMA. The company was headquartered there for two years.

On Propp&#x27;s death, Henry Hyman, another of the original Haft licensees forming NOMA, took over as president. He was also president of his original company, United States Electric Corporation (USEC). In 36, NOMA was looking to develop a product similar to one that was already marketed to a competitor but did not have the facilities to do so. NOMA contracted USEC to produce prototypes and a test commercial run and named the product Cheero-lites. Many of the prototypes failed, and Cheero-lites did not sell well. NOMA withdrew the product form the market.

Block, another of the original NOMA constituent owners and still a director of NOMA&#x27;s board, sued NOMA; Hyman; Propp&#x27;s estate (executor Bankers Trust and Propp&#x27;s son Mortimer Propp); and three other directors (Samuel Cohen, Jacob Lunitz and Joseph H. Tuttle). He charged them with self-dealing in the lease and the Cheero-lites. Shortly thereafter, Sadacca started buying up stock in the company and ousted Hyman. Under Sadacca&#x27;s leadership, NOMA, a co-defendant, worked to support the plaintiffs.

The judge in the case, J. Bernstein, determined that there was no self-dealing, and the action was designed to harass the defendants as Sadacca&#x27;s brother Henri was trying to wrest control of NOMA from the individual defendants; Henri Sadacca gained control in early 1939, which is when the dormant lawsuit was pursued vigorously. Bernstein stated that both causes for action were approved by the company directors, including Block; the lease was beneficial to NOMA, at a fair price, saving the company money, and consolidating operations; while the Cheero-lite product development was proposed independent of USEC, did not make USED money, and any defects or lack of sales were ordinary for new products.

=== Innovation ===
NOMA introduced a number of innovations to holiday lighting, including:
* the use of E17 intermediate base lamps for outdoor decorating (1928),
* successful parallel-wired light sets for indoor use (1934),
* all-rubber cords (1940),
* Bubble Lites (1946), and
* fused safety plugs (1951).

When the NOMA Electric Company was located in New York City, it may have produced the first commercial printed circuit board in 1946 with its Party Quiz Game. It was an electrical board game with replaceable question cards and two electrodes which, when placed in the proper positions to answer a question correctly, cause a bulb to light. Initially hard-wired, the game was made thinner by hot pressing aluminum foil onto cardboard, with the electrical contacts made into the board.

== Growth and decline ==
The company survived the stock market crash of 1929 and subsequent economic contraction with clever marketing proposed by Propp. Their advertisements made Christmas lighting seem like an essential part of the holiday, and the holiday celebrations essential in such trying times. The campaign worked, and NOMA was successful from 1929 through the depression years, despite its product being previously viewed as a luxury item.

On Propp&#x27;s death, Henri Sadacca became president. His family owned one of the original companies that formed NOMA. During World War II, NOMA sold wooden toys for the holiday season, switching its electrical manufacturing to the war effort. Sadacca bought a number of other companies, and focused manufacturing on incendiary devices.

In 1950, NOMA still had 35% of the holiday lighting marketing. In 1953, NOMA separated its Christmas light manufacturing operations into a subsidiary NOMA Lites, Inc. and enjoyed considerable success. Sadacca, by now chairman of the board, together with company president James Ward, formed a plastics company named TICO to vertically integrate manufacturing.

By the early 1960s, the company faced increasing competition from cheaper, imported miniature light sets. Ward was replaced by Morris Goldman for 1963. The company began a policy of reducing manufacturing and relying on cheap buyouts of stock from other companies in the industry as they failed in the face of the cheap imports. Sales still fell in the following two years, and NOMA Lites filed for bankruptcy in 1965, and started using cheaper components, while still assembling in the United States factory, under the name &quot;NOMA Worldwide, Inc.&quot; In 1967, this was renamed simply &quot;Worldwide, Inc.&quot;

In February 2007, Electrical Components International (ECI) purchased GenTek&#x27;s wire and cable assembly business known as NOMA Corporation. ECI owns the NOMA brand but is not involved in the design, sourcing or manufacture of these products.

=== European business ===
NOMA&#x27;s British affiliate was founded in 1939, as a joint venture of NOMA&#x27;s Toronto subsidiary and various European interests. The operation was called Noma Electric Company Ltd. It continued to succeed independently as the American company failed.

In 1969, after a private buyout, the name changed to NOMA Lights. The LeisureGrow company purchased it in 2014, and it was downgraded to a brand, though LeisureGrow claims the title, via NOMA, of oldest Christmas company in the UK and possibly the world.

<text>Homie was an American rock supergroup, which was the side project of Rivers Cuomo, lead singer of the band Weezer. Homie, as it stands now, was a one-time effort, and were only active for a year. Homie has officially released just one song, &quot;American Girls&quot;, for the soundtrack of the 1998 film &quot;Meet the Deedles&quot;. For this recording, Cuomo was joined by Greg Brown (member of Cake and Deathray), Matt Sharp (formerly of Weezer, lead singer of The Rentals), Adam Orth of Shufflepuck and Yuval Gabay of Soul Coughing and Sulfur.

== Overview ==
Weezer fans sometimes erroneously apply the Homie moniker to a very different Cuomo-led group of Boston-area musicians that played several shows while Rivers took time off from Harvard. This group was not Homie, but were played under the guise of Rivers Cuomo solo shows and the material played at these shows were songs Rivers had written for the third Weezer album at the time. This band included members of other local bands such as Chevy Heston, Heretix, and The Shods. This band is often referred to by fans as &quot;The Rivers Cuomo Band&quot;, although this was never a name used by the band.

The &quot;Rivers Cuomo Band&quot; formed in 1997 and began playing in October of that year they were a way for Cuomo to release solo music and play small clubs. For the first show the lineup of the band consisted of Rivers Cuomo, Kevin Stevenson, Mikey Welsh, and Zeph Courtney. After Stevenson complained of being unable to work with the current lineup, Welsh and Courtney were replaced with Fred Eltringham and Drew Parsons. This was the lineup for the second show in late October. By the third show Cuomo had come up with a fully developed solo project he called Homie. Further shows were billed as Homie and the material played at Homie shows were exclusive to the Homie project and are assumed to have been intended for the Homie album which was worked on in 1997 and 1998.

The song &quot;Wanda (You&#x27;re My Only Love)&quot;, although originally written as a Weezer song for the film Angus, is often considered to be a Homie song since it was played during the Homie shows. The song &quot;Wanda (You&#x27;re My Only Love)&quot; was released on &quot;Alone - The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo&quot;. The song &quot;I&#x27;ll Think About You&quot; was released on &quot;Alone II: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo&quot;.

On February 20, 2009, a fan-made tribute was distributed by two members of a Weezer fan community, Jack Mergist (The Lifetaker) and Ryan Rowland (runnersdialzero). The tribute features an album worth of high-quality recordings of interpretations of Homie and Rivers Cuomo solo songs from this era.

In November 2020, a batch of unreleased songs were released on Rivers Cuomo&#x27;s website, and some of these songs, such as &quot;Hot Tub&quot; or &quot;Rosemary,&quot; were possibly originally by Homie.

<text>Georg August Goldfuß (18 April 1782 – 2 October 1848) was a German palaeontologist, zoologist and botanist. He became a professor of zoology at the University of Erlangen and later at the University of Bonn. He coined the terms &quot;protozoa&quot; and &quot;pelecypoda&quot;.

== Life and work ==
Goldfuß was born at Thurnau near Bayreuth. His father, a court physician, Johann August Goldfuß (1748–85) died in an accident on a voyage to the East Indies. His mother Margarete née Waechter died in 1799. After studies at the Latin school in Thurnau, he went to study medicine in 1800 first at Arzberg and then at the Collegium Medico-chirurgium in Berlin. At Berlin he was influenced by lectures by Carl Ludwig Willdenow (1765-1812). He received a scholarship from the Prussian government, and he dedicated his thesis to the officer Karl Freiherr vom Stein zum Altenstein (1770-1840). He completed his doctorate at Erlangen in 1804 with a thesis on South African beetles. He worked briefly at the natural history collection in Erlangen but lost the position after the French invasion of 1806. He edited the magazine &quot;Politische Zeitung&quot;, and in 1808, he was a founder of a medical law firm in Erlangen. After serving as a private tutor for Baron Winkler von Mohrenfels in Helmhofen he considered moving to Calcutta, but this was scuttled by a blockade imposed by Napoleon. Following the vacancies created by the death of his teachers Johann von Schreber (1739-1810) and Eugen Esper (1742-1810), he worked as a lecturer in zoology from 1811 and became professor of zoology at the University of Erlangen. He was admitted to the Leopoldina Academy in 1813. In 1818, he moved to the newly established Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn where he was involved in establishing a natural history museum. He took a keen interest in fossils and introduced the term protozoa in that year although he included not just single-celled organisms but included polyps, bryozoans and rotifers. He was subsequently appointed professor of zoology and mineralogy at the University of Bonn. Aided by Count Georg zu Münster, he issued the important (1826–44), a work which was intended to illustrate the invertebrate fossils of Germany, but it was left incomplete after the sponges, corals, crinoids, echinoderms and part of the mollusca had been figured. A collection of Goldfuß&#x27; botanical specimens are housed at Bonn University. 06.04.2024) 

Goldfuß married Eleonore Oelhafen (1789-1873) in 1815 and they had five sons and six daughters. One of his sons, Otto Goldfuß (1831-1905), became a malacologist. He received an Order of the Red Eagle III Class from the Prussian empire in 1822. He was a Freemason and a member of the Lebanon lodge of Erlangen. He built a large home &quot;Rosenburg&quot; in Kessenich, Bonn. He suffered from chest disease from 1847 and died from a stroke. He was buried in Poppelsdorf. A street in Bonn was named after him.

== Reception ==

&quot;Billboard&quot; in its Spotlight of the Week album reviews stated that the album &quot;features a fine collection of tunes.&quot;

&quot;Cashbox&quot; described the album as a &quot;top-notch listening pleasure album.&quot;

Hunter Nigel of &quot;Disc&quot; praised Orbison for &quot;His high-pitched delivery is unique in the beat business.&quot;

Richie Unterberger of AllMusic said that the album &quot;was above-average considering the slight standards of the time, but was a fairly slight effort nonetheless. In its favor, the album features nearly all original material by Orbison and some of the writers who frequently tailored songs for him, such as Boudleaux and Felice Bryant and Joe Melson.

<text>Maurice Lauré (24 November 1917 – 20 April 2001)*Maurice Lauré was a French civil servant. He is primarily known for creating the &quot;taxe sur la valeur ajoutée&quot; (TVA in French, otherwise known as value added tax (VAT) in English).

Originally an engineer of the École Polytechnique with the French postal and telephone service (PTT), he joined the French tax inspectorate after World War II. In 1952, he became deputy director of the new tax authority, the &quot;Direction générale des impôts&quot;, which he had helped to create.

In 1954, he invented an indirect tax on consumption which became the TVA. His idea was quickly adopted because it forced taxpayers at all levels in the production process to administer and account for the tax themselves, rather than putting the burden only on retailers or requiring assessment by the tax authorities.

He later joined the board of several private sector companies, including Société Générale (the bank) and Nouvelles Galeries (a retailer).

His name is associated to the :fr:Taxe Lauré which is a tax on import goods from countries having an unfair advantage about salaries and working conditions.

<text>Mary Elizabeth Post (June 17, 1841 – 1934) was an American teacher and a pioneer of education in Arizona.

==Biography==
A native of Elizabethtown, New York, her father was a carpenter who loved literature. From an early age, Post and her seven siblings were taught the importance of education and manners in society. Wanting a better future for his daughter, Post&#x27;s father hired a teacher to teach her during summers. A fast learner, Post got her first job as a teacher in 1856 at the age of 15
Post applied for a scholarship at the University of Vermont, not knowing that the university did not accept female students. Undaunted by this rejection, she went on to study at the Burlington Female Seminary. In 1863, after graduating from that school, Post relocated with her family to Iowa.

In Iowa, Post met and fell in love with a politician who was a rising star in his party. While he was campaigning for an important political position, his political enemies, aware that he was about to win the election, spread a rumor that he was having an affair. While these rumors had no base, Post believed them and, deeply hurt, avoided him for the rest of her life, refusing to speak with him or respond to his letters. Soon after, she accepted a job teaching in Lansing, Iowa. While in Lansing, Post began to investigate her former boyfriend&#x27;s supposed affair. Despite discovering the truth, she did not apologize to him.

Post moved to Arizona City, Arizona (now known as Yuma, Arizona) in 1872. Upon her arrival in Yuma, she was met by Arizona territorial governor Anson P. K. Safford. Only the fifth teacher in Arizona, Post got help from Safford to re-open a former saloon and turn it into Arizona&#x27;s third school.

Post was known as a strict rule enforcer in class; for example, if a student missed class Post would go to the student&#x27;s home and unless the student had a valid excuse not to be in class, would take the student to school herself. Many of her students&#x27; parents disliked her practices, and Post was aware of this. She began to win the parents over, however, by ordering trendy uniforms from San Francisco and teaching the students&#x27; mothers how to sew.

On May 2, 1873, Mary witnessed the hanging of Manuel Fernandez, who had been found guilty of murdering Michael &quot;Rawhide&quot; McCartney, a local salesman. Disillusioned by the act and by the subsequent approval by the &quot;Arizona Sentinel&quot;, Post decided to relocate to San Diego, California, where she took a job as general vice-principal of San Diego&#x27;s school system. However, only a year later she returned to Arizona City. She and her brother, Albert, shared positions at her new school; Mary supervised the girls while Albert oversaw the boys.
Occasionally, Post engaged in creative fundraising for education. Post once convinced a wealthy man to hold a charity horse race that raised $600, which she used to buy school supplies. She also hired Colorado River boat captain Isaac Pulhamus (1828-1922) to organize a beauty contest from which she garnered $500, which were also used for school supplies.

After her retirement from teaching at the age of 72, the United States Senate passed a bill which dictated for Post to receive a pension of fifty dollars a month. She was the first teacher in the state to do so. In her retirement, Post operated a small store and pursued her hobby of sewing, going door to door teaching women to sew clothes. Post died of natural causes in 1934, at the age of 93. The &quot;Mary E. Post school&quot; in Yuma is named after her.

<text>Grassroots is the second studio album by American rock band 311, released on July 12, 1994, through Capricorn Records. The album was intentionally recorded to have a &quot;muddy&quot; tone, and was recorded in a small house in Van Nuys where all of the band members lived together. This album also contains the track &quot;Applied Science&quot;, which is a staple in 311&#x27;s live show and has included a full-band drum solo since 2000. P-Nut records with a five-string Warwick bass for the first time here as well. The album was certified gold in 1999 by the RIAA, having sold over 500,000 copies. With their second album, 311 started recording with Eddy Offord, but parted ways very early in the process. Funds for the album were cut off, but the band persevered by doing it themselves. 311 finished recording the album in their band house, leading to the unique sound of this record.

A special vinyl edition of the record was pressed for Black Friday in 2011 at United Record Pressing in Nashville, TN.

==Critical reception==
Sandra Schulman of the &quot;South Florida Sun Sentinel&quot; chastised &quot;Grassroots&quot; for resembling &quot;Beastie Boys meets the Spin Doctors&quot;, writing that while musical fusion is a &quot;fine&quot; template to work from, the album is unsuccessful for reminding them of the musical styles of other musicians, rather than presenting &quot;something new to groove on&quot;. They also added that while 311 may have &quot;a lot to say&quot;, &quot;none of it is getting across&quot; behind the group&#x27;s funk bass backdrops, speedy tempos and &quot;thick as thieves&quot; lyrics. By contrast, J.D. Considine of the &quot;Tucson Citizen&quot; wrote that while 311 are stylistically similar to the Beastie Boys and Red Hot Chili Peppers, there is &quot;nothing secondhand&quot; about the music on &quot;Grassroots&quot;, partly for the band&#x27;s &quot;more natural fusion of rock and rhyme&quot; than the aforementioned groups in which sung and rapped parts &quot;coexist in their own songs without seeming crowded together&quot;, and partly for the group&#x27;s jazzy swing, as exemplified on songs like &quot;8:16 a.m.&quot; He further praised the band for being energetic without &quot;getting mirred in musical extremes&quot;.

Rodo Pocowatchit of &quot;The Wichita Eagle&quot; also drew comparisons to the Beastie Boys and Chili Peppers, as well as &quot;a dash of Faith No More&quot;, but noted that the further incorporation of reggae, funk and hip hop flavours and &quot;biting, mile-a-minute lyrics&quot; made &quot;Grassroots&quot; feel &quot;as raw as any urban underground from-the-gut record&quot;, and praised the group&#x27;s energy and tone. Retrospectively, Jacob N. Lunders of AllMusic selected &quot;Grassroots&quot; as an &quot;Album Pick&quot; and wrote that it was 311&#x27;s artistic peak and one of 1994&#x27;s most underrated records, adding that it &quot;evenly balancing the band&#x27;s rap-metal intensity with reggae vibrations, Grateful Dead-like jams, and hallucinogenic ambience.&quot; He recommended it to fans of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Rage Against the Machine and Sublime, but also noted how the album &quot;artistically ignores corporate rock&#x27;s temptations of conformity, which consequently threaten the possibility of mainstream airplay.&quot;

<doc id="911747" wikidata="Q5377279" url="?curid=911747" title="Enfield, Nova Scotia">
<text>Enfield is an unincorporated community in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, located in both East Hants Municipality and Halifax Regional Municipality. Enfield is situated along the Shubenacadie River and its source at Grand Lake, and is directly adjacent to the community of Elmsdale. The area encompassing Enfield, Elmsdale, Lantz, and Milford is colloquially referred to as &quot;The Corridor&quot;. The namesake of Enfield is the town of Enfield, Connecticut, the former residence of an early settler.

==History==
===18th and 19th centuries===
The lands including the present day community of Enfield were part of a land grant of 20,000 acres provided to Benjamin Franklin by the Privy Council of Nova Scotia in 1767. Franklin had applied for the land grant in 1765 and by the time he received it had largely lost interest in developing the lands. While he never moved to Nova Scotia himself, he hired a man named Mr. Hall to settle the lands and operate a hotel there named the &quot;Wayside Inn.&quot; Franklin would bequeath these lands to his son, William Franklin, who fought against his father in the American Revolutionary War. Benjamin Franklin was quite wealthy at the time of his death, and leaving solely these undeveloped, worthless lands to his son was considered to be a final act of retribution.
“To my son, William Franklin, late Governor of the Jerseys, I give and devise all the lands I hold or have a right to in the Province of Nova Scotia … The part he acted against me in the late war, which is of public notoriety, will account for my leaving him no more of an estate he endeavoured to deprive me of.”While the lands were left to William Franklin upon his father&#x27;s death, ownership of the land would have been unclear as the terms of the agreement stipulated that the land must be settled within ten years of ownership. William would never again return to North America, and the exact nature of the settlement in the area at the time is unclear.

The first recorded settler in the area is William Hall, who established himself in the area in 1830. His relation to the &quot;Mr. Hall&quot; who presided over Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s land grant is not known.

By the 1860s there were five families in the area, which at the time was referred to as &quot;The Crossing.&quot; The families included that of Henry Donaldson (farmer), Thomas Donaldson (trader), John Hall (trader), Donald McKenzie (farmer), and James McKenzie (deputy gold commissioner). In 1862 the settlers held a public meeting at Malcolm Pottery House to decide on a name for the growing community. The name &quot;Enfield&quot; was suggested by Thomas B. Donaldson, recalling his time living in Enfield, Connecticut. After selling his general store business in 1867, Thomas Donaldson purchased the Hall farm in Enfield. By 1871 he had firmly established himself in the community and began planning for the construction of a church. The building was completed by 1872, operating originally as a Methodist church and later a United Church.

Enfield experienced a period of growth during the mid-19th century as a shipping hub for the nearby gold mining area of Renfrew. During this time a system of locks on the Shubenacadie River was constructed to assist small vessels in navigating from the Bay of Fundy to nearby Grand Lake as part of the Shubenacadie Canal.

The Horne family, well known in Enfield today, are descended from German immigrant Jacob Horn. Horn immigrated to America and was piloting a boat from New York when General James Wolfe stopped in Halifax on the way to Louisbourg in 1759. After the capture of Louisbourg, Horn was given a land grant on McNab&#x27;s Island, where he built a home. The location on the island was inconvenient for trading and transporting cattle, and Horn would later give up this grant and move to Eastern Passage. His grant there was a 220 acre plot originally granted to Joseph Goreham on July 20 1752, escheated on August 24 1797, and granted to Jacob Horn on November 1 1798.

===20th century===
Enfield continued to grow steadily into the 20th century. During this time, Enfield became known as the home of Edmund H. Horne; prospector, miner, and descendent of Jacob Horn. Horne had spent a number of years traveling the United States and Canada before discovering the site of the Noranda Mines in Quebec. After finding success in Quebec he eventually returned to his hometown of Enfield and established his estate, Monte Vista Farm, on Grand Lake. At his estate Horne raised prize winning cattle and established himself as an integral part of the community.

Around 1940, Reverend J.J. Devine, the parish priest of St. Bernard&#x27;s Church, approached Horne to express the need for a new school in the community. Horne would organize and fund the construction of a four classroom school, with a library and auditorium. The E. H. Horne School opened in 1943 teaching grades primary to eleven, and the auditorium would become a major asset for the community for concerts, meetings, and other events. When the church in Enfield was destroyed by fire in March 1944, services were held in the school while residents waited for a new church venue. When Hants East Rural High School opened in nearby Milford in 1957, the E. H. Horne School would be reduced to teaching grades primary to six. The E. H. Horne school continued to be used as a school until 2000.

===21st century===
Situated near the halfway point between Halifax and Truro, Enfield was once home to a prominent railway station constructed by the Nova Scotia Railway and later the Intercolonial Railway and Canadian National Railway; it has since been sold, moved and now is a private cottage near Monte Vista.

In 2016, Enfield residents Lorraine and Hervé Burri funded the creation of a new park in Enfield beside St. Bernard&#x27;s Church. Upon its opening in 2017, St. Bernard&#x27;s Park featured 100 different species of flowers, 25 different species of trees and 20 different species of grasses. A Japanese garden and 400 square-foot red spruce gazebo was also constructed in the park.

On April 19, 2020, a spree killing that spanned a wide area of Nova Scotia resulted in a police chase that ended on Highway 2 in Enfield.

==Geography==
Enfield lies in the Shubenacadie Valley, on the northwestern and eastern side of Grand Lake, situated along the meanders of the Shubenacadie River. The community is situated north of Halifax Stanfield International Airport on the border of Hants County and Halifax County. Enfield exists in both the East Hants Municipality and Halifax Regional Municipality.

===Climate===
Enfield has a humid continental climate with some marine influence, as typical of Nova Scotia. The nearest station is at the Halifax Stanfield International Airport located around south of the Enfield core.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the area of Enfield—Lantz had a population of 6,583 living in 2,724 of its 2,806 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 6,807. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Economy==

Enfield is a bedroom community with a small but diverse local economy. Employment in the area is concentrated in health care and social assistance (12%), retail trade (12%), public administration (12%), and construction (9%). The East Hants Chamber of Commerce is based in Enfield and services the surrounding business community. 

A major economic driver for the area is the nearby Halifax Stanfield International Airport. Air Canada Jazz and Maritime Air Charter have their headquarters adjacent to the airport. Now-defunct CanJet and Air Nova were also based in the vicinity of the airport.

==Sports==
The Enfield Rugby Football Club (Established 2007) won the NSRFU Summer Division II Championship against the Halifax Tars 26-12 after completing an undefeated 8-0 season. They were also the Truro 7&#x27;s Indoor Rugby Men&#x27;s Div &#x27;A&#x27; Champions for 2009.

<text>The British Medical Association (BMA) is a registered trade union and professional body for doctors in the United Kingdom. It does not regulate or certify doctors, a responsibility which lies with the General Medical Council. The BMA has a range of representative and scientific committees and is recognised by National Health Service (NHS) employers alongside the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association as one of two national contract negotiators for doctors.

The BMA&#x27;s stated aim is &quot;to promote the medical and allied sciences, and to maintain the honour and interests of the medical profession&quot;.

==History==
===Provincial Medical and Surgical Association and Webster&#x27;s Medical Association===

The British Medical Association traces its origins to the Provincial Medical and Surgical Association (PMSA), founded by Sir Charles Hastings on 19 July 1832, and to the &quot;British Medical Association&quot; founded by George Webster in 1836. Ten years after its initial meeting the Provincial Medical and Surgical Association&#x27;s membership had grown to 1,350 and it had begun to publish a weekly journal, &quot;The Provincial Medical and Surgical Journal&quot;. In 1853 the PMSA extended its membership to London doctors and 1856 transformed itself into the British Medical Association. From 1857 their journal was known as the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; or &quot;BMJ&quot;.
Although not initially formed with the aim of initiating medical reform, the BMA played a key role in the drafting and passing of the Medical Act 1858, which established the General Medical Council and set a standard for qualified and unqualified doctors and established a system of professional regulation. Prior to this anyone, qualified or not, could practice as a doctor. This also positioned the BMA to play a major role in future medical politics, campaigning on issues such as Poor Law Medicine, quackery, public health, alternative and military medicine, and contract practice. During this time one of the most active and influential of the association&#x27;s bodies was the Parliamentary Bills Committee, formed in 1863 to take a leading role in influencing legislation on public health matters.

===Early 20th century===
In May 1911 the Government introduced the National Health Insurance Bill which presented the BMA with new challenges. This bill introduced the idea that for a maximum contribution of four pence a week every employed person in the country could be insured against treatment costs for sickness. The BMA supported the principle but had a number of reservations about the scheme including the lack of doctor involvement in delivering the medical benefits, which were instead being delivered by friendly societies and trade unions. In response the BMA produced &quot;Six Cardinal Points&quot; which it felt should be included in any legislation.

At the BMA&#x27;s general meeting in July 1912, incoming president Sir James Barr condemned the National Health Insurance Bill as &quot;the most gigantic fraud which had ever been perpetrated on the public since the South Sea Bubble.&quot; Addressing &quot;a large and distinguished audience,&quot; Barr &quot;spoke eloquently and forcibly in favour of the improvement of the race by attention to eugenics, and pointed out the necessity of preventing disease as well of curing it. No serious attempt, he said, had yet been made to prevent the race from being carried on by its least worthy citizens.&quot; Barr explained that: &quot;If such an attempt was to be successful we must begin with the unborn. The race must be renewed from the mentally and physically fit, and moral and physical degenerates should not be allowed to take any part in adding to it&quot;.

Ultimately the final bill was passed in 1913 in which four of the six points had been included. This resulted in an income limit of £2 per week being set to join the scheme, there was to be free choice of doctor by patient, the payment to the doctor should be adequate, and finally there should be adequate medical representation among the various bodies working on the Act.

With the start of World War I, the BMA formed a Central Medical War Committee (CMWC), and was given responsibility by the government for managing the demand for doctors in the armed forces whilst maintaining a full medical service for civilians. The BMA repeated this role during World War II. During this time the BMA also campaigned on issues such as the production and marketing of &quot;secret remedies&quot;, nutrition and physical fitness, the relationship of alcohol to road accidents, and the medical aspects of abortion.

Early in the Second World War, the BMA became aware of the need for a change in the provision of medical care to the public after the end of the war and during peacetime, so shortly after the war, the BMA had produced its own plan for a &quot;general medical service for the nation&quot;.

After the Labour Party won the 1945 general election and formed a government under Clement Attlee pledging national health insurance, the BMA spent three years negotiating with Health Minister Aneurin Bevan to allow the continuation of capitation fees, private practice, and paybeds under the new National Health Service.

During the 7 July 2005 London bombings a London Buses route 30 double decker bus exploded near the BMA headquarters on Upper Woburn Place, damaging it. After the explosion, some medical professionals in the building were able to assist police and ambulance personnel.

==Membership==
As of August 2024 the BMA had 195,000 members.

It is officially recognised by the British government and by the Review Body on Doctors&#x27; and Dentists&#x27; Remuneration. The BMA has sole national bargaining rights for most groups of doctors although, for consultants, these are shared with the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA).

Members of the BMA have access to employment advice, covering subjects including contract checking, job planning, pay disputes and relationship issues.

Members also receive a subscription to &quot;The BMJ&quot;, and other associated resources.

==ARM, Council, and committees==

As part of the representative remit of the BMA, it has a number of representative committees formed from members elected at the Annual Representatives Meeting (ARM) and via other election processes. The most senior of these is Council, which meets five times a year to implement policy as decided at the ARM and to take relevant decisions during the year. Council has 34 voting members, led by the Chair who is elected by council for an initial term of three years and to a maximum of five.

The Board of Professional Activities reports to Council and considers ethical, scientific, research, and educational matters whilst The Board of Representative and Political Activities considers reports from the following committees which represent doctors across the seven branches of practice, namely:
* Consultants Committee (CC) – representing senior hospital doctors
* General Practitioners Committee (GPC) – representing NHS General Practitioners (GPs) and GP trainees throughout their training
* Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) – representing junior hospital doctors
* Medical Academic Staff Committee (MASC) – representing academic and research staff
* Medical Students Committee (MSC) – representing medical students
* Public Health Medicine Committee (PHMC) – representing public and community health doctors
* Staff and Associate Specialists Committee(SASC) – for doctors in the non consultant career grades.

Branch of Practice committees have a majority of BMA members but may also include non-members. All members are elected. These UK committees are mirrored across the devolved nations of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

===Medical Ethics Committee===
The BMA has a Medical Ethics Committee provides guidance to the association on current and developing issues in medical ethics. The committee debates issues of principle including those touching on:

===Armed Forces Committee===
The BMA supports armed forces doctors through its Armed Forces Committee (AFC) which represents clinicians in all parts of the armed forces, whether they are deployed to war zones, acting as reservists or civilian doctors employed by the Ministry of Defence. A large part of the AFC&#x27;s work is the production of evidence to the Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB). The AFPRB advises on remuneration for members of the naval, military, and air forces. Further to this work, the AFC negotiates with the Ministry of Defence on the terms and conditions for civilian doctors. The committee holds two conferences a year; an Armed Forces Committee conference usually in May and a Civilian Doctors&#x27; conference usually in October.

===Private Practice Committee===
The BMA supports doctors that undertake private practice outside the NHS through its Private Practice Committee. This body considers topics facing both private consultants and general practitioners. The committee meets three times a year and holds conferences in relation to private practice. The main issues currently being dealt with by the committee include looking at the implementation of revalidation in the independent sector and addressing difficulties that doctors experience in relation to new ways of working by the private medical insurers.

=== Special Chloroform Committee ===
The Special Chloroform Committee of the British Medical Association (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Third Chloroform Committee&quot;) was established in 1901 following the annual meeting of the British Medical Association and it produced its last final report 1910. The committee was instigated to investigate chloroform, which was a subject of great interest to the profession and the public at the time.

The committee was started with a budget of £100 and the committee was chaired by Dr. A. D. Waller, and consisted of Dr. Barr, Dr. Dudley Buxton, Sir Victor Horsley, Dr. Sherrington and Dr Walker (and later A. Vernon Hardcourt and Professor Dunstan) &quot;to investigate methods of quantitatively determining the presence of chloroform in the air and the living body&quot;.

In their final report, the committee stated that chloroform doses above 2% were unsafe as cardiac arrest occurred under inhibition of the vagus nerve. They also selected a list of inhalers suitable for giving accurate measures of chloroform.

===Other committees===
The BMA also has a number of committees which represent other specialities and interests which affect its members, including:
* Medical Ethics
* Board of Medical Education
* Equality and Diversity Committee
* Pensions
* Armed Forces
* Civil and Public Services Committee
* International Committee
* Medico-Legal
* Occupational Health
* GP Registrars Subcommittee

==Headquarters==

BMA House has been the headquarters of the BMA since 1925, the association being previously housed at 429 The Strand since its move to London. In addition to offices for its staff, the building is used for BMA conferences and events and parts of the building are available on a private hire basis for events. The building, Grade II listed since 1982, was originally designed for the Theosophical Society by Sir Edwin Lutyens, with work commencing in September 1911. However the start of World War I interrupted construction and the Army Pay Office took over the uncompleted building. After the war the Theosophical Society could not afford to finish the building, and it was sold to the BMA for £50,000, with the association later purchasing the freehold of the site from the Bedford Estates in 1962.

After purchasing the building, the BMA commissioned Lutyens to complete the building to its specifications and it was officially opened by King George V and Queen Mary on 13 July 1925. However, plans were soon commissioned from Cyril Wontner Smith to extend the building to overlook Tavistock Square, and this was completed in 1929. The association later commissioned Douglas Wood to design further extensions on either side of Wontner Smith&#x27;s front entrance (built 1938–1949), to the south (1947–1950) and at the back of the building (1959–1960).

A 1954 war memorial by James Woodford in the central courtyard – a bronze fountain in a stepped pool, with four stone statues – is Grade II* listed, and described by Historic England as a particularly good example of a Second World War memorial to a civilian profession.

== Controversy ==
In 2019, the BMA faced criticism after two leading general practitioners blew the whistle on sexism and harassment in the organisation. Following the independent Romney review which described the BMA as an &quot;old boys club&quot; that undervalued women, the BMA apologised to female doctors. 

In 2024, the BMA was criticised by key medical figures for disavowing the final report of The Independent Review of Gender Identity Services for Children and Young People (commonly, Cass Review), which was accepted by the last government and its Labour party successor. The situation led to a split within the organisation, and resignations by long time members. Two months later, they announced that the organization had adopted &quot;a neutral position on the Cass Review&quot; and its recommendations.

==Fair and ethical trade==

The BMA&#x27;s Medical Fair and Ethical Trade Group (MFETG) was established in 2007 and works to &quot;investigate, promote and facilitate fair end ethical trade&quot; in relation to medical commodities. The group has worked with Swedish-based NGO Swedwatch to investigate and report on supply chain concerns, particularly looking at working conditions in the production of surgical instruments in Sialkot in Pakistan.

==Grants==
The BMA makes grants to doctors for research and other reasons. Details of all the awards and grants offered by The BMA are available on their website. However, the top three are listed here:
*Claire Wand Fund a charitable fund, administered by The BMA, that makes grants to fund the further education of medical practitioners predominantly engaged in general practice.
*Humanitarian Fund the BMA International Department runs the BMA Humanitarian Fund which offers grants of up to £3,000 for projects taking place in developing countries.
*BMA Research Grants the BMA awards ten grants totalling £500,000 annually. All grants are for research in progress or prospective research and cover a diversity of research areas.

==Insignia==
The logo of the BMA includes a stylised version of the rod of Asclepius, associated with Asclepius, the Greek god of healing. It was designed by John Lloyd (graphic designer) and Martin Skeet of the British design consultancy, Lloyd Northover.

== Awards ==
* The BMA Medical Book awards are announced annually. There are awards in 20 subject categories (from &quot;Anaesthesia&quot; to &quot;Surgical Specialities&quot;); special category awards including &quot;Illustrated book&quot;, &quot;Student textbook&quot;, &quot;Young author&quot;; and an overall &quot;Medical Book of the Year&quot;.
* The Association Medal is awarded to members for &quot;outstanding and sustained services&quot; to the BMA at national level
* Fellowship of the Association is awarded for &quot;distinguished and notable&quot; services to the BMA and the profession
* The Gold Medal is awarded to those who have &quot;conspicuously raised the character of the medical profession&quot;. The medal was instituted in 1877 at the association&#x27;s annual meeting in Manchester.

<text>Snake&#x27;s Revenge (also known as Snake&#x27;s Revenge: Metal Gear 2) is a stealth action-adventure video game produced by Konami for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990. It is a stand-alone sequel to &quot;Metal Gear&quot; that was released in North America (under the Ultra Games brand) and the PAL region following the international commercial success of the NES version. The game was produced without the involvement of series creator Hideo Kojima, who went on to develop a separate sequel for the MSX2 titled &quot;Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake&quot;, which was released later during the same year in Japan.

==Gameplay==
As in the original &quot;Metal Gear&quot;, the player&#x27;s objective is to infiltrate the enemy&#x27;s stronghold while avoiding detection from enemy soldiers or surveillance devices. To fulfill their mission, the player must collect a variety of weapons and equipment, such as firearms, explosives, and rations, as well as card keys to access new areas. If the player is discovered by the enemy, the game will go into an alert phase, causing enemy soldiers to enter the screen and attack the player. The player must defeat a certain number of enemy soldiers to return to the infiltration phase or go to a different floor or area. In some cases, particularly when a guard sees the player and only a single exclamation mark (!) appears over his head instead of two (!!), the player can also escape the alert phase by simply moving to the adjacent screen.

A change to the original &quot;Metal Gear&quot; formula is the fact that the player now begins the game with a combat knife and a handgun already in their equipment. The A button is used for firearms and explosives as in the original game, whereas the B button is used for a melee attack with a punch or a knife depending on which one is assigned. The knife can be used to instantly kill guards at close range, but guards who are defeated with punches instead will occasionally leave behind an ammo box or a single ration unit.

As in the original &quot;Metal Gear&quot;, Snake&#x27;s maximum health and carrying capacity are determined by his rank, with the highest level being six stars. The player must rescue various hostages scattered throughout various areas until enough have been rescued for a promotion. The player will also encounter enemy officers in certain rooms who can be interrogated by applying truth gas unto them. Successful interrogations are counted alongside rescued hostages for promotions.

The interface of the player&#x27;s transceiver has also been greatly changed from the original &quot;Metal Gear&quot;. Instead of dialing frequency numbers, Snake now has a set list of three contacts (John, Nick, and Jennifer) that he can communicate with and a radar that is activated whenever it detects a tracking signal transmitting from a nearby area. Unlike in the original &quot;Metal Gear&quot;, the transceiver cannot be used when the player enters alert mode.

&quot;Snake&#x27;s Revenge&quot; features a varied progression of areas such as a jungle, a warehouse, a cargo ship, and a train, as well as the usual encounters with enemy bosses. In addition to the standard top-view areas, the player must also go through a series of side-view areas that play in a manner similar to &quot;Rush &#x27;n Attack&quot;, in which Snake proceeds by walking, jumping, or crawling on his stomach while avoiding detection as usual. While in a side-view area, the player is limited to only the knife or handgun as their standard weapon, although plastic explosives can be planted as well to eliminate obstructions. Some of these areas require the player to crawl underwater to progress, resulting in the need for oxygen tanks to proceed without sustaining damage. Each time Snake&#x27;s oxygen gauge runs out, a tank will be used automatically to refill the gauge until supplies last.

==Plot==
Three years after the events of the original &quot;Metal Gear&quot;, FOXHOUND discovers that a hostile nation in the Middle East may have gotten hold of the plans for Metal Gear and is secretly constructing a new model. Lieutenant Solid Snake, the FOXHOUND operative responsible for the destruction of Metal Gear, is given orders to lead a three-man team to the enemy&#x27;s base consisting of himself and two fellow operatives: John Turner, a former Navy Intelligence agent and infiltration pro; and Nick Myer, a weapons and explosive expert formerly with the Marines. The codename of the mission is Operation 747.

Snake infiltrates the enemy&#x27;s jungle base with the help of John, who acts as a decoy by allowing himself to be captured. Snake eventually learns that the enemy is transporting their weapons, a set of mass-produced Metal Gear tanks, on a cargo ship. Snake blows up the ship&#x27;s ammunition cache and escapes with the help of the team&#x27;s helicopter pilot while the ship sinks.

The pilot informs Snake that the enemy has a prototype of the new Metal Gear 2 model in their main base and is told to contact their double agent, Jennifer, on the inside. As Snake goes deep into the base, he defeats an impostor posing as John, regains contact with Nick and eventually contacts Jennifer, who reveals that the enemy commander is planning to launch nukes around the globe. However, as Snake approaches the commander&#x27;s lair, Nick is killed and Jennifer is exposed as a spy and captured. Snake confronts the enemy&#x27;s commander, who reveals himself to be a cybernetically enhanced Big Boss, having survived his previous encounter with Snake. Snake defeats Big Boss and rescues Jennifer, who shows him to the storage facility where Metal Gear 2 is located. Snake destroys the weapon before its launch countdown is completed.

In the aftermath of Operation 747, the United Nations declares &quot;World Peace Day&quot;. John Turner is declared missing in action and removed from Navy records, while Nick Myer is awarded three posthumous promotions.

==Development==
Konami produced &quot;Snake&#x27;s Revenge&quot; following the release of the NES version of &quot;Metal Gear&quot;, as a sequel produced specifically for the Western market. Hideo Kojima, the designer of the original MSX2 version of &quot;Metal Gear&quot;, was not involved in the production of &quot;Snake&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. According to Kojima, one of the developers working on &quot;Snake&#x27;s Revenge&quot; informed him of the game. He then asked Kojima to develop a true sequel to &quot;Metal Gear&quot;. This inspired Kojima to direct his own sequel, &quot;Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake&quot; for the MSX2, which served as the sequel to &quot;Metal Gear&quot; in Japan. &quot;Snake&#x27;s Revenge&quot; was released in North America and Europe with no corresponding Famicom version. The game has been referred to in publications by the alternate title of &quot;Snake&#x27;s Revenge: Metal Gear II&quot;, although this title is never used in the actual game.

When interviewed by Steven Kent in 1999, Kojima stated that he enjoyed &quot;Snake&#x27;s Revenge&quot; and that he thought it was &quot;faithful to the Metal Gear concept&quot;. While Kojima once jokingly stated that &quot;Snake&#x27;s Revenge&quot; was &quot;somewhat of a crappy game&quot; during the 2009 Game Developers Conference, he later stated in an interview with &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; that he does not consider it to be a &quot;bad game&quot;.

A handheld electronic game for &quot;Snake&#x27;s Revenge&quot; was published by Tiger Electronics.

=== Compilations ===
A port was included in &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1&quot; for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S.

<text>The Utsunomiya Line () is the name given to a section of the [[Tōhoku Main Line]] between Tokyo Station in Tokyo and Kuroiso Station in Nasushiobara, Tochigi, Japan. It is part of the East Japan Railway Company (JR East) network.

== Services ==
Services on the Utsunomiya Line are typically divided into three categories: services to or from Ueno, Shōnan–Shinjuku Line services, and Ueno–Tokyo Line services. Between Ueno and Ōmiya, trains share the track with the Takasaki Line, both of which serve as &quot;de facto&quot; express services compared to the parallel Keihin–Tōhoku Line. Northbound services mostly terminate at or , with some at . Southbound trains mostly travel through the Shōnan–Shinjuku Line to on the Yokosuka Line, or the Ueno–Tokyo Line to on the Tōkaidō Line, with a few trains terminating at Ueno.

The fastest service on the line, the rapid &quot;Rabbit&quot;, makes the run between Ueno and Utsunomiya in 1 hour and 26 minutes.

Service on the line is generally divided at Utsunomiya, though the number of through trains had been increasing steadily over the years. South of Utsunomiya, 10- and 15-car E231-1000/E233-3000 series four-door suburban commuter EMUs with Green cars attached service the line, while to the north service was provided chiefly by 4-car 205-600 series four-door EMUs. Starting 12 March 2022, all services north of Utsunomiya until Kuroiso use E131-600/-680 series EMUs, and through services using suburban 10/15-car trains ceased to operate.

=== Limited express ===
Limited express services use the line, including:
* &quot;Nikkō / Spacia Nikkō / Kinugawa / Spacia Kinugawa&quot; (from Ikebukuro/Shinjuku to Kurihashi and on to the Tōbu Nikkō Line)

=== Local/rapid services ===

==== Rapid &quot;Rabbit&quot; ====
Since March 2015, Rapid &quot;Rabbit&quot; services now run from on the Tōkaidō Line, through the Ueno–Tokyo Line, to Utsunomiya. This service stops at every station on the Tōkaidō Line, and skips some stations on the Utsunomiya Line. &quot;Rabbit&quot; trains were first operated by the Japanese National Railways as an hourly/half-hourly rapid service. From October 2004, &quot;Rabbit&quot; services ran only twice during the morning; on weekends, they replaced the weekday commuter rapid service. From March 2021, the commuter rapid service was consolidated into the rapid &quot;Rabbit&quot; service, which now operate two trains one-way from the Tōkaidō Line (one from and one from Kōzu) to Utsunomiya in the morning, and between three and five trains each way between Ueno and Utsunomiya in the evening. From the start of March 2024 timetable revision, all southbound &quot;Rabbit&quot; services to Ueno were discontinued, resulting in these services fully becoming one-way operation. Following this, evening northbound services were reduced to two trains from Ueno to Utsunomiya.

==== Local ====
Local trains run four times hourly; one of those terminates at Koganei, while the rest terminate at Utsunomiya. During the morning peak, Tokyo-bound trains run at intervals of 4–6 minutes. Services are provided by E231/E233 series 10- or 15-car EMUs. Most trains continue south to the Tōkaidō Line through the Ueno–Tokyo Line, while some trains terminate at Ueno.

=== Shōnan–Shinjuku Line services ===

Within the Utsunomiya Line, Shōnan–Shinjuku Line rapid and local trains are each operated once per hour. They do not stop at Saitama-Shintoshin Station since it has no platforms available. They operate between Zushi on the Yokosuka Line and Utsunomiya.

==== Rapid ====
Rapid trains operate once hourly, making limited stops. The travel time between Shinjuku and Utsunomiya is about 1 hour and 35 minutes.

==== Local ====
Local trains operate once hourly (twice hourly during the morning), stopping at all stations. The travel time between Shinjuku and Ōmiya is about 32 minutes.

=== Utsunomiya – Kuroiso services ===
Between Utsunomiya and Kuroiso, local trains stop at every station. Trains operate approximately two times per hour, traveling between Utsunomiya and Kuroiso in approximately 50 minutes. All trains use E131-600/-680 series EMUs.

=== Past services ===
==== Commuter rapid ====
Commuter rapid services for Utsunomiya made fewer stops than the &quot;Rabbit&quot; rapid services. They were operated only on weekday evenings, between Ueno and Utsunomiya. Trains departed Ueno between 18:00 and 22:00, and Utsunomiya between 16:00 and 21:00, with approximately one round-trip per hour. All trains were E231/E233 series 10- or 15-car EMUs. This service ended on 12 March 2021.

==== Rapid &quot;Acty&quot; ====

From March 2015, with the Ueno–Tokyo Line opening, Tōkaidō Line Rapid &quot;Acty&quot; services ran up along the Utsunomiya Line. Services stopped at every station on the Utsunomiya Line, and skipped some stations on the Tōkaidō Line. Since 13 March 2021, &quot;Acty&quot; services stopped running through to the Utsunomiya Line.

==== Limited Express ====
* &quot;Ohayō Tochigi・Hometown Tochigi&quot;
* &quot;Hokutosei&quot;, &quot;Cassiopeia&quot; (once or twice daily night trains)

==== &quot;Home Liner Koga&quot; ====
Two trains bound for Koga depart Ueno every weekday evening. Passengers can board only at Ueno; all other stations are for disembarking only. Stops include: Ueno, Urawa, Ōmiya, Higashi-Ōmiya, Hasuda, Kuki, and Koga. Service is provided by 7-car 185 series and 9-car 489 series EMUs.

<text>Bernard Hislaire (born 11 January 1957) is a Belgian comic book creator. He is also known as Sylaire and as Yslaire, his current artist name.

==Biography==
Bernard Hislaire was born in 1957 in Brussels, Belgium. Passionate about comics since he was very young, he produced his first drawings in the &quot;Robidule&quot; fanzine, and worked on his style at the Institut Saint-Luc in Brussels. At the age of 18, he joined the drawing team of the &quot;Spirou&quot; magazine, where he published a story in the section dedicated to young creators. Soon, he began a 16-page story, &quot;Le Troisième Laron&quot;. He was then supported by the best known scenarists of Dupuis, such as Raoul Cauvin and Jean-Marie Brouyère, with whom he realised various series including &quot;Coursensac et Baladin&quot;. In 1978 he launched his own characters in the Spirou magazine, &quot;Bidouille et Violette&quot;, which continued until 1985, achieving considerable success with the public. Meanwhile, he also published humorous drawings in La Libre Belgique and Le Trombone Illustré.

In 1986, after having met the scenarist Balac, he created &quot;Sambre&quot;, a 19th-century saga, about an impossible love story between Bernard Sambre, a rich young man, and Julie, a farmer girl, during the 1848 revolution in France. This series was original because the graphical style used in these albums is different from the one Hislaire used before, and because the number of colours used is very restricted and centered on red. This was the first publication on which he used the name Yslaire. The whole series was published by Glénat and was a critical and commercial success.

In 1997 he surprised his fans again with the release of the unique &quot;Mémoires du XXe ciel: 98&quot;, later renamed &quot;XXe ciel.com: Mémoires98&quot; after it changed publishers as well as some of its content. In 2001, the sequel, &quot;Mémoires99&quot; was released. &quot;XXe ciel.com&quot; has as its central theme the existence of angels.

Hislaire has also made some scenarios for other artists, both under his own name and as Yslaire. Some of these works were &quot;Trois vierges&quot; for Boccar and &quot;Le Gang Mazda&quot; for Darasse.

<doc id="911776" wikidata="Q1435089" url="?curid=911776" title="Focusing (psychotherapy)">
<text>Focusing is an internally oriented psychotherapeutic process developed by psychotherapist Eugene Gendlin. It can be used in any kind of therapeutic situation, including peer-to-peer sessions. It involves holding a specific kind of open, non-judging attention to an internal knowing which is experienced but is not yet in words. Focusing can, among other things, be used to become clear on what one feels or wants, to obtain new insights about one&#x27;s situation, and to stimulate change or healing of the situation. Focusing is set apart from other methods of inner awareness by three qualities: something called the &quot;felt sense&quot;, a quality of engaged accepting attention, and a research-based technique that facilitates change.

==Origin==
At the University of Chicago, beginning in 1953, Eugene Gendlin did 15 years of research analyzing what made psychotherapy either successful or unsuccessful. His conclusion was that it is not the therapist&#x27;s technique that determines the success of psychotherapy, but rather the way the patient behaves, and what the patient does inside himself during the therapy sessions. Gendlin found that, without exception, the successful patient intuitively focuses inside himself on a very subtle and vague internal bodily awareness—or &quot;felt sense&quot;—which contains information that, if attended to or focused on, holds the key to the resolution of the problems the patient is experiencing.
&quot;Focusing&quot; is a process and learnable skill developed by Gendlin which re-creates this successful-patient behavior in a form that can be taught to other patients. Gendlin detailed the techniques in his book &quot;Focusing&quot; which, intended for the layperson, is written in conversational terms and describes the six steps of Focusing and how to do them. Gendlin stated: &quot;I did not invent Focusing. I simply made some steps which help people to find Focusing.&quot;

==&quot;Felt sense&quot; and &quot;felt shift&quot;==
Gendlin gave the name &quot;felt sense&quot; to the unclear, pre-verbal sense of &quot;something&quot;—the inner knowledge or awareness that has not been consciously thought or verbalized—as that &quot;something&quot; is experienced in the body. It is not the same as an emotion. This bodily felt &quot;something&quot; may be an awareness of a situation or an old hurt, or of something that is &quot;coming&quot;—perhaps an idea or insight. Crucial to the concept, as defined by Gendlin, is that it is &quot;unclear&quot; and vague, and it is always &quot;more&quot; than any attempt to express it verbally. Gendlin also described it as &quot;sensing an implicit complexity, a wholistic sense of what one is working on&quot;.

According to Gendlin, the Focusing process makes a felt sense more tangible and easier to work with. To help the felt sense form and to accurately identify its meaning, the focuser tries out words that might express it. These words can be tested against the felt sense: The felt sense will not resonate with a word or phrase that does not adequately describe it.

Gendlin observed clients, writers, and people in ordinary life (&quot;Focusers&quot;) turning their attention to this not-yet-articulated knowing. As a felt sense formed, there would be long pauses together with sounds like &quot;uh...&quot; Once the person had accurately identified this felt sense in words, new words would come, and new insights into the situation. There would be a sense of felt movement—a &quot;felt shift&quot;—and the person would begin to be able to move beyond the &quot;stuck&quot; place, having fresh insights, and also sometimes indications of steps to take.

==Learning and using Focusing==
One can learn the Focusing technique from one of several books, or from a Focusing trainer, practitioner, or therapist. Focusing is easiest to sense and do in the presence of a &quot;listener&quot;—either a Focusing trainer, a therapist, or a layperson trained in Focusing. However, the practice can be done alone. Gendlin&#x27;s book details the six steps of Focusing, however it emphasizes that the essence of Focusing is not adhering to these steps, but following the organic process. When the person learns the basics, they are able to weave through the process increasingly more and more organically.

Focusing is now practiced all over the world by thousands of people—both in professional settings with Focusing trainers, and informally between laypersons. As a stand-alone process, a Focusing session can last from approximately 10 minutes to an hour, on average—with the &quot;focuser&quot; being listened to, and their verbalized thoughts and feelings being reflected back by the &quot;listener&quot;. Generally speaking, but not always, the focuser has their eyes closed, in order to more accurately focus inwardly on their &quot;felt sense&quot; and the shifts that take place from it.

==Subsequent developments==
In 1996, Gendlin published a comprehensive book on Focusing-oriented psychotherapy. The Focusing-oriented psychotherapist attributes a central importance to the client&#x27;s capacity to be aware of their &quot;felt sense&quot; and the meaning behind their words or images. The client is encouraged to sense into feelings and meanings which are not yet formed. Other elements of Focusing are also incorporated into the therapy practice so that Focusing remains the basis of the process—allowing for inner resonance and verification of ideas and feelings, and allowing new and fresh insights to come from within the client.

Several adaptations of Gendlin&#x27;s original six-step Focusing process have been developed. The most popular and prevalent of these is the process Ann Weiser Cornell teaches, called Inner Relationship Focusing.

Other developments in Focusing include focusing alone using a journal or a sketchbook. Drawing and painting can be used with Focusing processes with children. Focusing also happens in other domains besides therapy. Attention to the felt sense naturally takes place in all manner of processes where something new is being formed: for example in creative process, learning, thinking, and decision making.

<doc id="911778" wikidata="Q504536" url="?curid=911778" title="Quadriceps">
<text>The quadriceps femoris muscle (, also called the quadriceps extensor, quadriceps or quads) is a large muscle group that includes the four prevailing muscles on the front of the thigh. It is the sole extensor muscle of the knee, forming a large fleshy mass which covers the front and sides of the femur. The name derives .

==Structure==
===Parts===
The quadriceps femoris muscle is subdivided into four separate muscles (the &#x27;heads&#x27;), with the first superficial to the other three over the femur (from the trochanters to the condyles):
* The rectus femoris muscle occupies the middle of the thigh, covering most of the other three quadriceps muscles. It originates on the ilium. It is named for its straight course.
* The vastus lateralis muscle is on the &quot;lateral side&quot; of the femur (i.e. on the outer side of the thigh).
* The vastus medialis muscle is on the &quot;medial side&quot; of the femur (i.e. on the inner part thigh).
* The vastus intermedius muscle lies between vastus lateralis and vastus medialis on the &quot;front&quot; of the femur (i.e. on the top or front of the thigh), but deep to the rectus femoris muscle. Typically, it cannot be seen without dissection of the rectus femoris.

===Attachments===
The rectus femoris arises from the anterior inferior iliac spine and from the superior edge of the acetabulum. It is thus a biarticular muscle. The other parts of the quadriceps arise from the surface of the femur. All four parts of the quadriceps muscle ultimately insert into the tuberosity of the tibia via the patella, where the quadriceps tendon becomes the patellar tendon.

===Other muscles===
There is a small fifth muscle of the quadriceps complex—the articularis genus muscle—that is not often included.

In addition, cadaver studies have confirmed the presence of a sixth muscle, the tensor vastus intermedius. While this muscle has a variable presentation, it consistently originates at the proximal femur, runs between the vastus lateralis and vastus intermedius muscles, and inserts distally at the medial aspect of the patellar base. Historically considered a part of the vastus lateralis muscle, the tensor vastus intermedius muscle is innervated by an independent branch of the femoral nerve and its tendinous belly can be separated from the vasti lateralis and intermedius muscles in most cases.

===Innervation===
The quadriceps femoris is innervated by the femoral nerve, which originates from L2, L3, L4.

==Function==
All four quadriceps are powerful extensors of the knee joint. They are crucial in walking, running, jumping and squatting. Because the rectus femoris attaches to the ilium, it is also a flexor of the hip. This action is also crucial to walking or running, as it swings the leg forward into the ensuing step. The quadriceps, specifically the vastus medialis, play the important role of stabilizing the patella and the knee joint during gait.

==Clinical significance==
The quadriceps femoris muscle is a target for manual therapy and physical therapy from repetitive strain injuries, such as from skiing.

The quadriceps femoris muscle is the most common site of myositis ossificans.

==Society and culture==

===Training===

In strength training, the quadriceps are trained by several leg exercises including the squat, leg press, and leg extension.

==Etymology==
The proper Latin plural form of the adjective &quot;quadri&quot; would be &quot;quadricipites&quot;. In modern English usage, &quot;quadriceps&quot; is used in both the singular and plural form. The singular form &quot;quadricep&quot;, produced by back-formation, is frequently used.

<doc id="911786" wikidata="Q4999220" url="?curid=911786" title="Burlington (department store)">
<text>Burlington, formerly known as Burlington Coat Factory, is an American national off-price department store retailer, and a division of Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse Corporation with more than 1,000 stores in 40 states and Puerto Rico, with its corporate headquarters located in Burlington Township, New Jersey. In 2007, it was acquired by Bain Capital in a transaction and in 2008, Tom Kingsbury became president and CEO. The company went public again in 2013. Burlington is the third largest off-price retailer after TJX Companies and Ross Stores.

==History== 

Monroe Milstein and his father, Abe, had been running a successful wholesale and retail outerwear business together since 1946.
In 1972, Henrietta Milstein convinced her husband Monroe to purchase a former factory outlet in Burlington, New Jersey, for $675,050, using money she had saved from her job as a librarian for most of the $75,000 down payment.
Initially, the Milsteins sold coats and jackets in wholesale, but in order to become less dependent on the seasonal coat business, they gradually began adding clothing items and accessories, eventually expanding into linens, gift items, a baby department and shoes.

A second location was opened in 1975 in Copiague on Long Island, and Milstein asked his son Lazer, who was living in Israel at the time, to return home and act as the store&#x27;s legal owner for the new location. Lazer agreed, on the condition that the store be closed Saturdays in observance of the Sabbath. At the time, businesses faced legal action for being open on Sunday, with an exception made for religions observing a different Sabbath. In 1983, with 31 locations, the company, whose name was Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse Corporation since it was bought by the family in 1972, went public.

In 2006, the company was purchased by Bain Capital Partners for $2.06 billion. The Milstein family held almost 30 million shares of the Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse Corporation, making approximately $1.3 billion, and Monroe Milstein was unassociated with the business following the sale, although two of his sons, Stephen and Andrew, stayed on briefly. Mark Nesci, the former executive vice president and chief operating officer, was named to serve as the acting CEO. A holding company called Burlington Coat Factory Holdings Inc., was formed to be the ultimate parent of the chain. 

Monroe Milstein was the first cousin of Paul Milstein and Seymour Milstein.

In July 2012, the company received a $40 million incentive from the New Jersey Economic Development Authority as part of the state&#x27;s GrowNJ program in order to build a new headquarters in Florence, adjacent to its existing headquarters, keeping the company from moving its headquarters outside the state.

On June 27, 2013, Burlington filed its S-1 registration statement with the SEC for an initial public offering. In October 2013, the company&#x27;s stock rose more than 40% on its first day of trading. The company reported $4.35 billion in sales for the 12-month period ending August 3, 2013. As of October 2013, the company operated 503 stores in 44 states and Puerto Rico under the names Burlington Coat Factory, Cohoes Fashions, Baby Depot, and MJM Designer Shoes.

In 2016, Burlington Stores joined the Fortune 500 for the first time. Tom Kingsbury served as the CEO from 2008 to 2018.

Following the bankruptcy and closure of all Bed Bath &amp; Beyond stores in the United States, Burlington purchased the leases for more than 40 closed locations in June 2023. The following year, Burlington acquired the leases of 15 locations of the Texas-based retailer Conn&#x27;s after their bankruptcy and store closings.

==Charitable partnerships==

Burlington has partnered with charitable organizations for several years. Since 2002, they have partnered with the joining the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society&#x27;s Light the Night campaign, collecting donations at the store checkout. With an annual fundraiser that runs from July through October, the company raised more than $3 million in 2013, bringing the total raised by the company to date to more than $19 million.

In 2006, Burlington launched the Warm Coats and Warm Hearts Drive to collect coat donations for those in need. Partnering with ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and the national nonprofit Fashion Delivers, Burlington stores served as drop off spots for the donations, which were then distributed within the area by local charities. Since the program&#x27;s inception, over 1.2 million coats have been collected and distributed.

In 2012, the company first partnered with WomenHeart: The National Coalition for Women with Heart Disease to promote women&#x27;s heart health education during National Heart Health Month As part of this partnership, the company holds a yearly Red Dress Event, where red dresses are sold in stores, with $1 from every sale donated to WomenHeart. In 2014, as part of the partnership they launched the “Heart of Style Tour”. For the tour, a bus traveled to various store locations, with heart health professionals on board providing blood pressure tests and Body Mass Index (BMI) tests and education about women&#x27;s heart disease.

== Business issues ==

Under investigation from animal welfare organization Humane Society of the United States, Burlington Coat Factory has been accused of labeling real fur products as &quot;faux fur&quot;. The company agreed to pull the false advertisements after an undercover investigation revealed &quot;faux fur&quot; as actually made from the pelts of animals killed in China. Coats sold by stores such as Burlington Coat Factory have also been found to contain hair of raccoon dog.

From 1981 until 2009, Burlington Coat Factory&#x27;s logo was supplemented with the tag &quot;Not Affiliated with Burlington Industries.&quot; When Burlington Coat Factory settled a trademark dispute with fabric maker Burlington Industries in 1981, Burlington Coat Factory agreed to say in advertising that the two companies were not affiliated. Even though Burlington Industries ceased operations in 2004 following a buyout of its remaining operations, the &quot;not affiliated&quot; disclaimer remained on advertising logo and company media until 2009, when the text was retired from all logos used by the company.

An urban legend concerning snakes hiding in coats being sold at Burlington became widely circulated in the early 1990s. A representative from the company assured customers that since distribution centers and stores were maintained at 68 °F, a snake would not be able to survive retail conditions.

In the September 11, 2001, attacks, after hijacked United Airlines Flight 175 penetrated through the South Tower of The World Trade Center, part of the plane&#x27;s landing gear and fuselage came out the north side of the tower and crashed through the roof and two of the floors of the Burlington Coat Factory at 45–47 Park Place, between West Broadway and Church Street, () north of the former World Trade Center. The store had been the company&#x27;s first location in Manhattan, opened in 1991. Three floor beams of the top floor of the building were destroyed, causing major structural damage. Nearly nine years later, the building was part of a national controversy, as efforts to build a Muslim center and mosque at the site as the &quot;Cordoba House&quot; sparked protest and was widely rejected.

He is employed as a writer for Microsoft Game Studios. His duties include the development of story bibles and other such fictional assets, the preparation of materials for marketing, and coordination with Microsoft localization, legal, and geopolitical departments.

In the 1990s he was hired by Microsoft to help rewrite and edit portions of Microsoft&#x27;s multi-media encyclopedia. Since then, he has written several novels based on Microsoft-published games, including the aforementioned Halo novels, and &quot;Crimson Skies&quot;, which was written collaboratively with Eric S. Trautmann.

Nylund has written many original novels as well, including &quot;Signal to Noise&quot;, &quot;A Signal Shattered&quot; and &quot;Dry Water&quot;.

<text>VGA Planets is a multi-player space strategy war game originally released in 1992. The game simulates combat in space between galactic scale empires. It follows the 4X game (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate) model: The players start with a home world, and have to build spaceships, explore the galaxy, colonize planets, mine minerals, build up their industry.

The game is set in the &quot;Echo Cluster&quot; where 11 different races fight for control. It was one of the first indie games to become commercially successful. It was notable for being played via email, without a central server: each game of up to 11 players is handled independently, with the players sending their orders for each turn to the computer which manages that game.

A hosted web version is now available.

==History==
The game was originally released in 1992 but became well known as a play-by-mail game in 1994 with version 3, although the prior version 2.2 was already played worldwide. Version 3 allows up to 11 players to join, each of them leading one of the 11 possible races. In 1994, the game was distributed as shareware, which could be purchased for $15 and registration was free. Although games could be set up directly by any group of players, a common way to find groups was to post and answer game invitations on the Usenet group .

The predefined races are modeled after &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, though custom races can be created with special tools. Each predefined race has some special powers and specific fields of expertise (for example: Cyborgs can assimilate native races into colonists; Robots are expert minelayers; Birdmen excel at spy tactics and cloaking).

&quot;VGA Planets&quot; follows the 4X game (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate) model: The players start with a home world, and have to build spaceships, explore the galaxy, colonize planets, mine minerals, build up their industry, etc. The game has no built-in victory condition: the players have to agree on one before starting a game.

===&quot;VGA Planets 3&quot;===
Clients up to version 3.0 were DOS programs; from version 3.5 on there were clients for Microsoft Windows. In addition, there are cross-platform third-party tools, including clients written in Java. A third-party Linux client named &quot;GNOME War Pad&quot; is also available.

===&quot;VGA Planets 4&quot;===
This is an expanded version of the original, with many new races and many new rules, expanded fleet combat - and the addition of ground combat units.

===&quot;VGA Planets 5&quot;===
This new browser-based version, based on version 4, was supposed to be published in 2011, but in February 2012 was put on hold indefinitely.

===&quot;VGA Planets Nu&quot;===
In May 2010 a new project was approved by Tim Wisseman called &quot;VGA Planets Nu&quot; to rebuild the version 3 game with modern web-based technology. The &quot;Nu&quot; project was developed over the course of 2010 and was released for live games in November 2010.

&quot;VGA Planets Nu&quot; is a remake of the version 3.0 game which runs on the web in a web browser or via the mobile app. The Nu project aims to overcome the technology challenges found in the older &quot;VGA Planets 3&quot; versions which do not run on modern technology and create many barriers to entry for new players. Players sign up and can start playing immediately.

This is now the most common way to play &quot;VGA Planets&quot;.

==Original gameplay==
The gameplay for both version 3 and 4 uses three programs: a master program that allows the creation of a universe with the desired characteristics; a host program that acts as a server; and a copy of the client program for each player.

First, the host sends a file with the initial conditions to each player. The client program allows the player to view data about the game and make decisions. Once the player has finished giving orders for the turn, either the client program or an external helper program takes the data, creates a turn file (usually with a extension), and sends it to the host person, who feeds all the turn files into the host program. The host processes all the turns and creates new status files (usually with a extension), which are then sent back to the players. This process can be fully automated (the host can be an automatic server).

At the time that the game gained popularity, LANs and the Internet were not generally available to the public, so &quot;VGA Planets&quot; was primarily played via dial-up bulletin board systems (BBS), gradually moving to email as a PBEM as it became more widely available. The turn files and the game status files were transferred to and from the BBS or by email manually. This required games to have a regular hosting schedule.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in 1993 and 1994 noted &quot;VGA Planets 3.0&quot;″s &quot;clunky&quot; interface and lack of single-player AI, but approved the &quot;great deal Mr. Wisseman is giving the computer gaming public&quot; for $15, and his &quot;constant striving to improve his product&quot;. The magazine recommended that &quot;anyone who enjoys spaceploitation&quot; should try the game, stating that it &quot;is very similar in feel to a play-by-mail system but without the cost and wait&quot;. A May 1994 survey in the magazine of strategic space games set in the year 2000 and later gave &quot;VGA Planets 3.0&quot; four stars out of five, calling it &quot;excellent ... easy to learn, tough to master&quot;. Another article in the issue described &quot;3.0&quot; as &quot;a wonderful blend of &quot;Reach for the Stars&quot;, &quot;Master of Orion&quot; and &quot;Diplomacy&quot;&quot;.

In June 1994 &quot;VGA Planets&quot; was named a Finalist (Honorable Mention) for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s &quot;Online Game of the Year&quot; award, losing to &quot;Multiplayer BattleTech&quot;. It was the first PBEM game nominated for the award.

The game sold more than 50,000 copies.

The full name of the band is a tongue-in-cheek reference to Ōtara&#x27;s status as one of the poorest suburbs of Auckland.

==Career==
===Origin (1992–1995)===
The Otara Millionaires Club was formed in 1992 by Phil Fuemana, who had played in the bands Houseparty and Fuemana. Fuemana and his younger brother Pauly Fuemana recorded two tracks as the new band for producer Alan Jansson&#x27;s Urban Pacifica collection &quot;&quot;. Jansson had achieved cult status as composer/producer for the synthpop group Body Electric during the early 1980s.
In 1994, after the split of the Otara Millionaires Club, Pauly approached Jansson and the two formed a musical partnership, with Fuemana the public face and Jansson as producer and co-writer. Pauly suggested that they shorten the band&#x27;s name to just the initials, and thereafter, Fuemana and Jansson were OMC. Pauly performed as OMC, serving as the frontman and playing several instruments during performances. However, the music was created by Pauly and Alan Jansson, with Jansson co-writing all of the tracks and handling most of the arrangement and all production duties in the studio.

===&quot;How Bizarre&quot; (1995–1997)===

Signed to Simon Grigg&#x27;s Huh! label, OMC released the single &quot;How Bizarre&quot; in New Zealand in late 1995. It was an immediate smash hit even without a video, reaching number one in early 1996 and staying there for three weeks. It sold over 35,000 copies.

The same year, &quot;How Bizarre&quot; went to number one in Australia for five weeks, sold over 150,000 singles, and was certified as a platinum single. Later in the year the single went to number 5 in the UK Singles Chart and number one in countries across Europe and much of the rest of the world.

In the United States, &quot;How Bizarre&quot; spent 32 weeks on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Mainstream Top 40 chart, peaking at number one in August 1997 due to the large amount of radio play it received. This made OMC the first New Zealand artist to reach the number one spot on a &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. The song never charted on the regular &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 as it was not released as a commercially available single in the US, which was a chart-eligibility requirement at the time. It also became a BMI-certified &quot;million airplay&quot; song two years in a row.

OMC&#x27;s third single, &quot;On the Run&quot;, reached number 56 on the UK in 1997.

In 1996, OMC&#x27;s debut album, also entitled &quot;How Bizarre&quot;, was released. The album sold in the United States in excess of half a million copies, and charted worldwide. Between 1995 and 2000, world-wide OMC sales are estimated at between three and four million records.

===Follow-up success (1997–2010)===
&quot;How Bizarre&quot; was followed by the singles &quot;Land of Plenty&quot; which reached the top 5 in the New Zealand charts; &quot;Right On&quot; which achieved platinum-status in New Zealand; and &quot;On The Run&quot; which was a minor international hit in the Netherlands and the UK. By 1998, Fuemana and Jansson had a falling out over royalties, which ended up in court. It was resolved in arbitration with Fuemana paying a sum to Jansson and Jansson handing over all claim to the name and ongoing artist royalties.

Fuemana and Jansson regrouped in 2005 and released the single &quot;4 All of Us&quot;, featuring the actress Lucy Lawless as a guest vocalist, in 2007.

In 2002, their song &quot;How Bizarre&quot; reached #71 on the &quot;100 Greatest One-hit Wonders&quot; hosted by William Shatner.

===Death of Pauly and Phil===
Phil died in 2005 of a heart attack.

On 31 January 2010, Pauly Fuemana died at North Shore Hospital in Auckland after suffering for several years from a chronic degenerative disease, progressive demyelinating polyneuropathy, an auto-immune disorder similar to the nerve disease multiple sclerosis. He was 40 years old, and was survived by his wife and six children. In February 2010, &quot;How Bizarre&quot; briefly reentered the charts in New Zealand following news of Pauly Fuemana&#x27;s death.

<text>The Bismarck Sea (, ) lies in the south-western Pacific Ocean within the Papua New Guinean exclusive economic zone. It is located north-east of the island of New Guinea and south of the Bismarck Archipelago. It has coastlines in districts of the Islands Region, Momase Region, and Papua Region.

== Geography ==
Like the Bismarck Archipelago, it is named in honour of the first German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. The Bismarck Archipelago extends round to the east and north of the sea, enclosing the Bismarck Sea and separating it from the Southern Pacific Ocean. To the south it is linked to the Solomon Sea by the Vitiaz Strait.

=== Official boundaries ===

The International Hydrographic Organization defines the Bismarck Sea as &quot;that area of the South Pacific Ocean off the northeast coast of New Guinea&quot;, with the following limits:
&quot;On the North and East.&quot; By the Northern and Northeastern coasts of the islands of New Ireland, New Hanover, the Admiralty Islands, Hermit Island, and the Ninigo Group, through Manu and Aua Islands to Wuvulu Island and thence a line to Baudissin Point in New Guinea (142°02&#x27;E).

&quot;On the Southeast.&quot; A line from the Southern point of New Ireland along the parallel of 4°50&#x27; South to the coast of New Britain, along its Northern coast and thence a line from its Western extreme through the Northern point of Umboi Island to Teliata Point, New Guinea ()

&quot;On the Southwest.&quot; By the Northeast coast of New Guinea.
=== Geology ===
The geology is related to the tectonic processes that have produced the underlying South Bismarck Plate and the relic North Bismarck Plate. These processes have created the Melanesian arc volcanoes and explain the many earthquakes under the sea. 

==== Mineral wealth ====
Recent explorations in the Bismarck Sea seabed have yielded discoveries of mineral-rich beds of sulfides, copper, zinc, silver and gold. These findings are especially important because they lie in shallow, calm waters. Papua New Guinea owns the mining rights to these minerals under international law.

=== Important Bird Area ===
Some 5,200 km2 of the Bismarck Sea, between the north-eastern end of New Britain and New Ireland, has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it apparently supports a population of Beck&#x27;s petrels, following sightings at sea of this rare and enigmatic species, of which the breeding grounds remain undiscovered.

== History ==
It was the site of a major Japanese naval defeat in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea during World War II on 3 and 4 March 1943.

<doc id="911820" wikidata="Q840226" url="?curid=911820" title="Normal modal logic">
<text>In logic, a normal [[modal logic]] is a set &quot;L&quot; of modal formulas such that &quot;L&quot; contains:
* All propositional tautologies;
* All instances of the Kripke schema: formula_1
and it is closed under:
* Detachment rule (&quot;modus ponens&quot;): formula_2 implies formula_3;
* Necessitation rule: formula_4 implies formula_5.

The smallest logic satisfying the above conditions is called K. Most modal logics commonly used nowadays (in terms of having philosophical motivations), e.g. C. I. Lewis&#x27;s S4 and S5, are normal (and hence are extensions of K). However a number of deontic and epistemic logics, for example, are non-normal, often because they give up the Kripke schema.

Every normal modal logic is regular and hence classical.

== Common normal modal logics ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;The following table lists several common normal modal systems. &lt;/onlyinclude&gt;The notation refers to the table at Kripke semantics § Common modal axiom schemata. 
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;Frame conditions for some of the systems were simplified: the logics are &quot;sound and complete&quot; with respect to the frame classes given in the table, but they may &quot;correspond&quot; to a larger class of frames.

<doc id="911827" wikidata="Q2276525" url="?curid=911827" title="Sound system (DJ)">
<text>A sound system is a group of DJs and audio engineers contributing and working together as one, playing and producing music over a large PA system or sound reinforcement system, typically for a dance event or party.

==Origin==

The sound system concept originated in the 1950s in Kingston, Jamaica. DJs would load up a truck with a generator, turntables, and huge speakers to set up street parties. The sound system scene is a part of Jamaican cultural history and responsible for the rise of modern Jamaican musical styles such as ska, rocksteady, reggae and dub. When Jamaicans emigrated to the United Kingdom, the sound system culture followed and became firmly rooted there in the 1970s. It is still strongly linked with those Jamaican-originated music genres, and some bands or producers still call themselves sound systems, such as Dub Narcotic Sound System and the On-U Sound System. When Asian Dub Foundation are advertised as &quot;Asian Dub Foundation&quot;, the whole band performs, but when they announce themselves as &quot;Asian Dub Foundation Sound System&quot;, members of the band mix and play music (by other artists, as well as their own) while one or two MCs rap over the songs. The term also has become connected with sound reinforcement systems by DJs.

==Free party==
The term &quot;sound system&quot; is also used to refer to a free party sound system, also known as a rig. The equipment includes a van, loudspeakers, amplifiers, turntable decks and cables. Larger rigs might also have a fog machine, stage lighting, video projectors and an electrical generator; the generator enables the sound system to be set up anywhere. A sound system collective is usually five or more people, with larger sound systems having more members. Equipment is owned by some and others are DJs, record producers or enthusiastic ravers who help out. They will be the people who organise free parties and teknivals and will be a group of friends with similar interests. Some owners purposely use second hand equipment, to reduce their risk if the equipment is stolen or damaged. This type of rig is called a &quot;suicide rig&quot; and usually used at insecure locations where it may get stolen or damaged and if it is suspected that police will have knowledge of the party.

Sometimes a sound system collective is well known for its wide travels. This type of collective can be described as modern nomad tribes or new age travellers. In this context the word sound system is used interchangeably to describe either the group of people or the equipment. The techno travelling scene of the 1990s was made of sound system crews like Bedlam sound system and Spiral Tribe. The free party community has been criticized for the unkempt appearance of attendees to such events, accusations of substance abuse of illegal drugs such as MDMA, ketamine, amphetamines and LSD, and complaints about messes left behind by such parties have given the scene a negative reputation. However, despite such complaints, the scene continues to grow with a large following in Bristol, Abergavenny, Newport, London, Devon and Cornwall.

<doc id="911831" wikidata="Q274730" url="?curid=911831" title="Thea Astley">
<text>Thea Beatrice May Astley (25 August 1925 – 17 August 2004) was an Australian novelist and short story writer. She was a prolific writer who was published for over 40 years from 1958. At the time of her death, she had won more Miles Franklin Awards, Australia&#x27;s major literary award, than any other writer. As well as being a writer, she taught at all levels of education – primary, secondary and tertiary.

Astley has a significant place in Australian letters as she was &quot;the only woman novelist of her generation to have won early success and published consistently throughout the 1960s and 1970s, when the literary world was heavily male-dominated&quot;.

==Life==
Born in Brisbane and educated at All Hallows&#x27; School, Astley studied arts at the University of Queensland then trained to become a teacher. After marrying Jack Gregson in 1948, she moved to Sydney where she taught at various high schools, as well as kept up with her writing. She tutored at Macquarie University from 1968 to 1980, before retiring to write full-time, at which time she and her husband moved to Kuranda in North Queensland. In the late 1980s they moved to Nowra, New South Wales, on the state&#x27;s south coast, and, after her husband&#x27;s death in 2003, she moved to Byron Bay to be near her only child, Ed Gregson, a musician and television producer.

In addition to her passion for writing, Astley, along with her husband, had a great love of music, particularly jazz and chamber music.

Wyndham writes that &quot;in person and in print, the chain-smoking Astley was unsentimental, wickedly funny and yet had a deep kindness and a loathing of injustice towards Aborigines, underdogs and misfits&quot;.

Thea Astley died at the John Flynn Hospital on the Gold Coast in 2004.

In 2005, the Thea Astley lecture was instituted at the Byron Bay Writers Festival, with Kate Grenville delivering the inaugural one.

==Career==

Astley&#x27;s novels won four Miles Franklin Awards and in 1989 the author won the Patrick White Award for services to Australian literature and was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Queensland. Much of her writing, which draws heavily from her early childhood, is set in Queensland, which she has described as &quot;the place where the tall yarn happens, where it is lived out by people who are the dramatis personae of the tall yarns.&quot;

Astley nearly became a journalist, following her father&#x27;s footsteps, but was refused a position by the &quot;Brisbane Telegraph&quot; for being too old when she applied after having finished her university degree. She sold her first poem under the name &quot;Phillip Cressy&quot; because men were paid £5, while women were only paid £3.

Her first book, &quot;Girl with a monkey&quot; was published in 1958. The author noted that &quot;I wrote quite a bit of it before Ed was born and entered it in the &quot;Herald&quot; and got an honourable mention. So I thought. &#x27;Oh well, I&#x27;ll bung it into A&amp;R&#x27;s, which was the only publisher I knew&#x27;&quot;. After the publication of her third book, &quot;The Well-dressed Explorer&quot;, the &quot;Herald&#x27;s&quot; reviewer, Sidney J. Baker, wrote &quot;With this book, Miss Astley earns a place among the leaders of modern Australian fiction&quot;. He associated her with writers such as Patrick White and Hal Porter who wrote &quot;poetic prose ... an important but by no means popular dimension to Australian fiction&quot;. Her early style, in particular, used &quot;obscure polysyllables, formal syntax and lush imagery [which] divided critics and daunted many readers&quot;.

In 1997, Thea Astley wrote in a column for &quot;Australian House &amp; Garden&quot; magazine that &quot;For me the chief advantage of writing is that it can be done anywhere. I recall writing almost the whole of a short story in &quot;Hunting the Wild Pineapple&quot; on a plane coming down from Cooktown. I&#x27;ve taken copious notes at a luncheon table in Santo, in small pub rooms in Charleville and Roma when I was on the Writers&#x27; Train. I&#x27;ve written in a convent bedroom on Palm Island, on the wharf at Magnetic [Island]&quot;.

Two weeks before her death, Astley appeared at the Byron Bay Writers&#x27; Festival and gave &quot;a brilliantly comic reading of &#x27;Why I Wrote a Story Called the Diesel Epiphany&#x27;, a short story about one of her many journeys by bus with all its annoyances&quot;. A plaque commemorating Astley&#x27;s writing is included in the Sydney Writers Walk at Circular Quay.

==Influences==
In her early years she was friends with Patrick White, Hal Porter and Thomas Keneally. She had few female literary contemporaries until the 1980s.

==Style and themes==
According to the &quot;AustLit Gateway News&quot; Astley was &quot;revered for her meticulous and controlled use of language and her portrayals of the Queensland landscape and character, [and] was renowned for her quick wit, raspy voice, and ever-present cigarettes&quot;. Many of her books explore the &quot;geography and politics of the small community&quot;.

Astley built a reputation as a &quot;metaphoric&quot; writer, resulting in a style that alienated some readers and critics. In an interview with Candida Baker, Astley quotes Helen Garner as saying &quot;I simply hate her style&quot; and goes on to say &quot;I can&#x27;t resist using imagistic language. I like it. I really don&#x27;t do it to annoy reviewers&quot;. In her review of &quot;An Item from the Late News&quot;, Garner wrote &quot;Great story, great characters ... Stylistically, however, this book is like a very handsome, strong and fit woman with too much makeup on ... This kind of writing drives me berserk&quot;.

Despite tepid reception among some, there were also many who admired Astley&#x27;s writing for both its style and for the subject matter, such as writer Kerryn Goldsworthy, who was quoted as saying, &quot;I love its densely woven grammar, its ingrained humour, its uncompromising politics, and its undimmed outrage at human folly, stupidity and greed&quot;. Goldsworthy continues to say that &quot;her body of work [over four decades] adds up to a protracted study in the way that full-scale violence and tragedy can flower extravagantly from the withered seeds of malice and resentment ... The perps in &quot;Drylands&quot; are all her usual suspects: racists, developers, hypocritical gung-ho civic do-gooders, and assorted unreconstructed male-supremacist swine&quot;.

Academic and literary editor, Delys Bird, summarises the author&#x27;s themes as follows: &quot;Astley&#x27;s novels and stories typically present a sceptical view of social relationships among ordinary people, one often coloured by her former Catholicism, and directed through the struggles of her self-conscious protagonists to find an expressive space within their uncongenial surroundings&quot;. In several novels, such as &quot;A Kindness Cup&quot; and &quot;The Multiple Effects of Rainshadow&quot;, she explores the relationships between white and Indigenous Australian societies. Leigh Dale writes that &quot;A Kindness Cup&quot; &quot;focuses on the massacre of a group of Aborigines and the efforts made to forget and to remember this violence at a town reunion twenty years later, is marked largely by the rage and frustration felt by its central character who seems to mirror Astley&#x27;s horror at the genial amorality that pervades some rural communities.&quot;

Astley found her material in newspaper stories and through her travels, but mostly in the various communities she and her husband lived in. In north Queensland, for example, she &quot;found a wealth of stories and &#x27;screwball&#x27; characters by listening to people in the small towns and wilderness of the tropics&quot;. In 1997, she wrote &quot;Sadly, the north has changed. As we say up there: beautiful one day, developed the next. I keep writing about it. I can&#x27;t help myself&quot;.

==Influence==
Astley encouraged many friends and students to pursue careers in writing, and is regularly quoted by other teachers, particularly her advice that writing one page a day &quot;adds up to a book in a year&quot;.

<doc id="911833" wikidata="Q169917" url="?curid=911833" title="Graphene">
<text>Graphene () is a carbon allotrope consisting of a single layer of atoms arranged in a honeycomb planar nanostructure. The name &quot;graphene&quot; is derived from &quot;graphite&quot; and the suffix -ene, indicating the presence of double bonds within the carbon structure.

Graphene is known for its exceptionally high tensile strength, electrical conductivity, transparency, and being the thinnest two-dimensional material in the world. Despite the nearly transparent nature of a single graphene sheet, graphite (formed from stacked layers of graphene) appears black because it absorbs all visible light wavelengths. On a microscopic scale, graphene is the strongest material ever measured.

The existence of graphene was first theorized in 1947 by Philip R. Wallace during his research on graphite&#x27;s electronic properties, while the term &quot;graphene&quot; was first defined by Hanns-Peter Boehm in 1987. In 2004, the material was isolated and characterized by Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov at the University of Manchester using a piece of graphite and adhesive tape. In 2010, Geim and Novoselov were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their &quot;groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene&quot;. While small amounts of graphene are easy to produce using the method by which it was originally isolated, attempts to scale and automate the manufacturing process for mass production have had limited success due to cost-effectiveness and quality control concerns. The global graphene market was $9 million in 2012, with most of the demand from research and development in semiconductors, electronics, electric batteries, and composites.

The IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) advises using the term &quot;graphite&quot; for the three-dimensional material and reserving &quot;graphene&quot; for discussions about the properties or reactions of single-atom layers. A narrower definition, of &quot;isolated or free-standing graphene&quot;, requires that the layer be sufficiently isolated from its environment, but would include layers suspended or transferred to silicon dioxide or silicon carbide.

== History ==


=== Structure of graphite and its intercalation compounds ===

In 1859, Benjamin Brodie noted the highly lamellar structure of thermally reduced graphite oxide. Pioneers in X-ray crystallography attempted to determine the structure of graphite. The lack of large single crystal graphite specimens contributed to the independent development of X-ray powder diffraction by Peter Debye and Paul Scherrer in 1915, and Albert Hull in 1916. However, neither of their proposed structures was correct. In 1918, Volkmar Kohlschütter and P. Haenni described the properties of graphite oxide paper. The structure of graphite was successfully determined from single-crystal X-ray diffraction by J. D. Bernal in 1924, although subsequent research has made small modifications to the unit cell parameters.

The theory of graphene was first explored by P. R. Wallace in 1947 as a starting point for understanding the electronic properties of 3D graphite. The emergent massless Dirac equation was separately pointed out in 1984 by Gordon Walter Semenoff, and by David P. Vincenzo and Eugene J. Mele. Semenoff emphasized the occurrence in a magnetic field of an electronic Landau level precisely at the Dirac point. This level is responsible for the anomalous integer quantum Hall effect.

=== Observations of thin graphite layers and related structures ===

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of thin graphite samples consisting of a few graphene layers were published by G. Ruess and F. Vogt in 1948. Eventually, single layers were also observed directly. Single layers of graphite were also observed by transmission electron microscopy within bulk materials, particularly inside soot obtained by chemical exfoliation.

From 1961 to 1962, Hanns-Peter Boehm published a study of extremely thin flakes of graphite. The study measured flakes as small as ~0.4 nm, which is around 3 atomic layers of amorphous carbon. This was the best possible resolution for TEMs in the 1960s. However, it is impossible to distinguish between suspended monolayer and multilayer graphene by their TEM contrasts, and the only known method is to analyze the relative intensities of various diffraction spots. The first reliable TEM observations of monolayers are likely given in references 24 and 26 of Geim and Novoselov&#x27;s 2007 review.

In 1975, van Bommel et al. epitaxially grew a single layer of graphite on top of silicon carbide. Others grew single layers of carbon atoms on other materials. This &quot;epitaxial graphene&quot; consists of a single-atom-thick hexagonal lattice of sp2-bonded carbon atoms, as in free-standing graphene. However, there is significant charge transfer between the two materials and, in some cases, hybridization between the d-orbitals of the substrate atoms and π orbitals of graphene, which significantly alter the electronic structure compared to that of free-standing graphene.

Boehm et al. coined the term &quot;graphene&quot; for the hypothetical single-layer structure in 1986. The term was used again in 1987 to describe single sheets of graphite as a constituent of graphite intercalation compounds, which can be seen as crystalline salts of the intercalant and graphene. It was also used in the descriptions of carbon nanotubes by R. Saito and Mildred and Gene Dresselhaus in 1992, and in the description of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in 2000 by S. Wang and others.

Efforts to make thin films of graphite by mechanical exfoliation started in 1990.
Initial attempts employed exfoliation techniques similar to the drawing method. Multilayer samples down to 10 nm in thickness were obtained.

In 2002, Robert B. Rutherford and Richard L. Dudman filed for a patent in the US on a method to produce graphene by repeatedly peeling off layers from a graphite flake adhered to a substrate, achieving a graphite thickness of . The key to success was the ability to quickly and efficiently identify graphene flakes on the substrate using optical microscopy, which provided a small but visible contrast between the graphene and the substrate.

Another U.S. patent was filed in the same year by Bor Z. Jang and Wen C. Huang for a method to produce graphene-based on exfoliation followed by attrition.

In 2014, inventor Larry Fullerton patented a process for producing single-layer graphene sheets.

=== Full isolation and characterization ===
Graphene was properly isolated and characterized in 2004 by Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov at the University of Manchester. They pulled graphene layers from graphite with a common adhesive tape in a process called micro-mechanical cleavage, colloquially referred to as the Scotch tape technique. The graphene flakes were then transferred onto a thin silicon dioxide layer on a silicon plate (&quot;wafer&quot;). The silica electrically isolated the graphene and weakly interacted with it, providing nearly charge-neutral graphene layers. The silicon beneath the could be used as a &quot;back gate&quot; electrode to vary the charge density in the graphene over a wide range.

This work resulted in the two winning the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010 for their groundbreaking experiments with graphene. Their publication and the surprisingly easy preparation method that they described, sparked a &quot;graphene gold rush&quot;. Research expanded and split off into many different subfields, exploring different exceptional properties of the material—quantum mechanical, electrical, chemical, mechanical, optical, magnetic, etc.

=== Exploring commercial applications ===

Since the early 2000s, several companies and research laboratories have been working to develop commercial applications of graphene. In 2014, a National Graphene Institute was established with that purpose at the University of Manchester, with a £60 million initial funding. In North East England two commercial manufacturers, Applied Graphene Materials and Thomas Swan Limited have begun manufacturing. Cambridge Nanosystems is a large-scale graphene powder production facility in East Anglia.

== Structure ==
Graphene is a single layer of carbon atoms tightly bound in a hexagonal honeycomb lattice. It is an allotrope of carbon in the form of a plane of sp2-bonded atoms with a molecular bond length of . In a graphene sheet, each atom is connected to its three nearest carbon neighbors by σ-bonds, and a delocalized π-bond, which contributes to a valence band that extends over the whole sheet. This type of bonding is also seen in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The valence band is touched by a conduction band, making graphene a semimetal with unusual electronic properties that are best described by theories for massless relativistic particles. Charge carriers in graphene show linear, rather than quadratic, dependence of energy on momentum, and field-effect transistors with graphene can be made that show bipolar conduction. Charge transport is ballistic over long distances; the material exhibits large quantum oscillations and large nonlinear diamagnetism. 

=== Bonding ===

Three of the four outer-shell electrons of each atom in a graphene sheet occupy three sp2 hybrid orbitals – a combination of orbitals s, px and py — that are shared with the three nearest atoms, forming σ-bonds. The length of these bonds is about 0.142 nanometers.

The remaining outer-shell electron occupies a pz orbital that is oriented perpendicularly to the plane. These orbitals hybridize together to form two half-filled bands of free-moving electrons, π, and π∗, which are responsible for most of graphene&#x27;s notable electronic properties. Recent quantitative estimates of aromatic stabilization and limiting size derived from the enthalpies of hydrogenation (ΔHhydro) agree well with the literature reports.

Graphene sheets stack to form graphite with an interplanar spacing of .

Graphene sheets in solid form usually show evidence in diffraction for graphite&#x27;s (002) layering. This is true of some single-walled nanostructures. However, unlayered graphene displaying only (hk0) rings have been observed in the core of presolar graphite onions. TEM studies show faceting at defects in flat graphene sheets and suggest a role for two-dimensional crystallization from a melt.

=== Geometry ===
The hexagonal lattice structure of isolated, single-layer graphene can be directly seen with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of sheets of graphene suspended between bars of a metallic grid. Some of these images showed a &quot;rippling&quot; of the flat sheet, with an amplitude of about one nanometer. These ripples may be intrinsic to the material as a result of the instability of two-dimensional crystals, or may originate from the ubiquitous dirt seen in all TEM images of graphene. Photoresist residue, which must be removed to obtain atomic-resolution images, may be the &quot;adsorbates&quot; observed in TEM images, and may explain the observed rippling.

The hexagonal structure is also seen in scanning tunneling microscope (STM) images of graphene supported on silicon dioxide substrates The rippling seen in these images is caused by the conformation of graphene to the substrates&#x27; lattice and is not intrinsic.

=== Stability ===

Ab initio calculations show that a graphene sheet is thermodynamically unstable if its size is less than about 20 nm and becomes the most stable fullerene (as within graphite) only for molecules larger than 24,000 atoms.

== Electronic properties ==
Graphene is a zero-gap semiconductor because its conduction and valence bands meet at the Dirac points. The Dirac points are six locations in momentum space on the edge of the Brillouin zone, divided into two non-equivalent sets of three points. These sets are labeled K and K&#x27;. These sets give graphene a valley degeneracy of formula_1. In contrast, for traditional semiconductors, the primary point of interest is generally Γ, where momentum is zero. 

If the in-plane direction is confined rather than infinite, its electronic structure changes. These confined structures are referred to as graphene nanoribbons. If the nanoribbon has a &quot;zig-zag&quot; edge, the bandgap remains zero. If it has an &quot;armchair&quot; edge, the bandgap is non-zero.

Graphene&#x27;s honeycomb structure can be viewed as two interleaving triangular lattices. This perspective has been used to calculate the band structure for a single graphite layer using a tight-binding approximation.

=== Electronic spectrum ===

Electrons propagating through the graphene honeycomb lattice effectively lose their mass, producing quasi-particles described by a 2D analogue of the Dirac equation rather than the Schrödinger equation for spin- particles.

=== Dispersion relation ===
The cleavage technique led directly to the first observation of the anomalous quantum Hall effect in graphene in 2005 by Geim&#x27;s group and by Philip Kim and Yuanbo Zhang. This effect provided direct evidence of graphene&#x27;s theoretically predicted Berry&#x27;s phase of massless Dirac fermions and proof of the Dirac fermion nature of electrons. These effects were previously observed in bulk graphite by Yakov Kopelevich, Igor A. Luk&#x27;yanchuk, and others, in 2003–2004.

When atoms are placed onto the graphene hexagonal lattice, the overlap between the &quot;p&quot;z(π) orbitals and the &quot;s&quot; or the &quot;p&quot;x and &quot;p&quot;y orbitals is zero by symmetry. Therefore, &quot;p&quot;z electrons forming the π bands in graphene can be treated independently. Within this π-band approximation, using a conventional tight-binding model, the dispersion relation (restricted to first-nearest-neighbor interactions only) that produces the energy of the electrons with wave vector &quot;k&quot; is:

:formula_2

with the nearest-neighbor (π orbitals) hopping energy &quot;γ&quot;0 ≈ and the lattice constant . The conduction and valence bands correspond to the different signs. With one &quot;p&quot;z electron per atom in this model, the valence band is fully occupied, while the conduction band is vacant. The two bands touch at the zone corners (the &quot;K&quot; point in the Brillouin zone), where there is a zero density of states but no band gap. Thus, graphene exhibits a semi-metallic (or zero-gap semiconductor) character, although this is not true for a graphene sheet rolled into a carbon nanotube due to its curvature. Two of the six Dirac points are independent, while the rest are equivalent by symmetry. Near the &quot;K&quot;-points, the energy depends &quot;linearly&quot; on the wave vector, similar to a relativistic particle. Since an elementary cell of the lattice has a basis of two atoms, the wave function has an effective 2-spinor structure.

Consequently, at low energies even neglecting the true spin, electrons can be described by an equation formally equivalent to the massless Dirac equation. Hence, the electrons and holes are called Dirac fermions. This pseudo-relativistic description is restricted to the chiral limit, i.e., to vanishing rest mass &quot;M&quot;0, leading to interesting additional features:

:formula_3

Here &quot;vF&quot; ~ (.003 c) is the Fermi velocity in graphene, which replaces the velocity of light in the Dirac theory; formula_4 is the vector of the Pauli matrices, formula_5 is the two-component wave function of the electrons, and &quot;E&quot; is their energy.

The equation describing the electrons&#x27; linear dispersion relation is:

:formula_6

where the wavevector &quot;q&quot; is measured from the Brillouin zone vertex K, formula_7, and the zero of energy is set to coincide with the Dirac point. The equation uses a pseudospin matrix formula that describes two sublattices of the honeycomb lattice.

=== Single-atom wave propagation ===

Electron waves in graphene propagate within a single-atom layer, making them sensitive to the proximity of other materials such as high-κ dielectrics, superconductors, and ferromagnets.

=== Ambipolar electron and hole transport ===
Graphene exhibits high electron mobility at room temperature, with values reported in excess of . Hole and electron mobilities are nearly identical. The mobility is independent of temperature between and , showing minimal change even at room temperature (300 K), suggesting that the dominant scattering mechanism is defect scattering. Scattering by graphene&#x27;s acoustic phonons intrinsically limits room temperature mobility in freestanding graphene to at a carrier density of .

The corresponding resistivity of graphene sheets is , lower than the resistivity of silver, which is the lowest known at room temperature. However, on substrates, electron scattering by optical phonons of the substrate has a more significant effect than scattering by graphene&#x27;s phonons, limiting mobility to .

Charge transport can be affected by the adsorption of contaminants such as water and oxygen molecules, leading to non-repetitive and large hysteresis I-V characteristics. Researchers need to conduct electrical measurements in a vacuum. Coating the graphene surface with materials such as SiN, PMMA or h-BN has been proposed for protection. In January 2015, the first stable graphene device operation in the air over several weeks was reported for graphene whose surface was protected by aluminum oxide. In 2015, lithium-coated graphene exhibited superconductivity, a first for graphene.

Electrical resistance in 40-nanometer-wide nanoribbons of epitaxial graphene changes in discrete steps. The ribbons&#x27; conductance exceeds predictions by a factor of 10. The ribbons can function more like optical waveguides or quantum dots, allowing electrons to flow smoothly along the ribbon edges. In copper, resistance increases proportionally with length as electrons encounter impurities.

Transport is dominated by two modes: one ballistic and temperature-independent, and the other thermally activated. Ballistic electrons resemble those in cylindrical carbon nanotubes. At room temperature, resistance increases abruptly at a specific length—the ballistic mode at 16 micrometers and the thermally activated mode at 160 nanometers (1% of the former length).

Graphene electrons can traverse micrometer distances without scattering, even at room temperature.

==== Electrical conductivity and charge transport ====
Despite zero carrier density near the Dirac points, graphene exhibits a minimum conductivity on the order of formula_8. The origin of this minimum conductivity is still unclear. However, rippling of the graphene sheet or ionized impurities in the substrate may lead to local puddles of carriers that allow conduction. Several theories suggest that the minimum conductivity should be formula_9; however, most measurements are of the order of formula_8 or greater and depend on impurity concentration.

Near zero carrier density, graphene exhibits positive photoconductivity and negative photoconductivity at high carrier density, governed by the interplay between photoinduced changes of both the Drude weight and the carrier scattering rate.

Graphene doped with various gaseous species (both acceptors and donors) can be returned to an undoped state by gentle heating in a vacuum. Even for dopant concentrations in excess of 1012 cm−2, carrier mobility exhibits no observable change. Graphene doped with potassium in ultra-high vacuum at low temperature can reduce mobility 20-fold. The mobility reduction is reversible on heating the graphene to remove the potassium.

Due to graphene&#x27;s two dimensions, charge fractionalization (where the apparent charge of individual pseudoparticles in low-dimensional systems is less than a single quantum) is thought to occur. It may therefore be a suitable material for constructing quantum computers using anyonic circuits.

=== Chiral half-integer quantum Hall effect ===
==== Quantum hall effect in graphene ====
The quantum Hall effect is a quantum mechanical version of the Hall effect, which is the production of transverse (perpendicular to the main current) conductivity in the presence of a magnetic field. The quantization of the Hall effect formula_11 at integer multiples (the &quot;Landau level&quot;) of the basic quantity &quot;e&quot;2/&quot;h&quot; (where &quot;e&quot; is the elementary electric charge and &quot;h&quot; is the Planck constant). It can usually be observed only in very clean silicon or gallium arsenide solids at temperatures around and very high magnetic fields.

Graphene shows the quantum Hall effect: the conductivity quantization is unusual in that the sequence of steps is shifted by 1/2 with respect to the standard sequence and with an additional factor of 4. Graphene&#x27;s Hall conductivity is formula_12, where &quot;N&quot; is the Landau level and the double valley and double spin degeneracies give the factor of 4. These anomalies are present not only at extremely low temperatures but also at room temperature, i.e. at roughly .

==== Chiral electrons and anomalies ====
This behavior is a direct result of graphene&#x27;s chiral, massless Dirac electrons. In a magnetic field, their spectrum has a Landau level with energy precisely at the Dirac point. This level is a consequence of the Atiyah–Singer index theorem and is half-filled in neutral graphene, leading to the &quot;+1/2&quot; in the Hall conductivity. Bilayer graphene also shows the quantum Hall effect, but with only one of the two anomalies (i.e. formula_13). In the second anomaly, the first plateau at is absent, indicating that bilayer graphene stays metallic at the neutrality point.

Unlike normal metals, graphene&#x27;s longitudinal resistance shows maxima rather than minima for integral values of the Landau filling factor in measurements of the Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations, thus the term &quot;&quot;integral&quot; quantum Hall effect&quot;. These oscillations show a phase shift of π, known as Berry&#x27;s phase. Berry&#x27;s phase arises due to chirality or dependence (locking) of the pseudospin quantum number on the momentum of low-energy electrons near the Dirac points. The temperature dependence of the oscillations reveals that the carriers have a non-zero cyclotron mass, despite their zero effective mass in the Dirac-fermion formalism.

==== Experimental observations ====
Graphene samples prepared on nickel films, and on both the silicon face and carbon face of silicon carbide, show the anomalous effect directly in electrical measurements. Graphitic layers on the carbon face of silicon carbide show a clear Dirac spectrum in angle-resolved photoemission experiments, and the effect is observed in cyclotron resonance and tunneling experiments.

=== &quot;Massive&quot; electrons ===

Graphene&#x27;s unit cell has two identical carbon atoms and two zero-energy states: one where the electron resides on atom A, and the other on atom B. However, if the unit cell&#x27;s two atoms are not identical, the situation changes. Research shows that placing hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) in contact with graphene can alter the potential felt at atoms A and B sufficiently for the electrons to develop a mass and an accompanying band gap of about 30 meV.

The mass can be positive or negative. An arrangement that slightly raises the energy of an electron on atom A relative to atom B gives it a positive mass, while an arrangement that raises the energy of atom B produces a negative electron mass. The two versions behave alike and are indistinguishable via optical spectroscopy. An electron traveling from a positive-mass region to a negative-mass region must cross an intermediate region where its mass once again becomes zero. This region is gapless and therefore metallic. Metallic modes bounding semiconducting regions of opposite-sign mass is a hallmark of a topological phase and displays much the same physics as topological insulators.

If the mass in graphene can be controlled, electrons can be confined to massless regions by surrounding them with massive regions, allowing the patterning of quantum dots, wires, and other mesoscopic structures. It also produces one-dimensional conductors along the boundary. These wires would be protected against backscattering and could carry currents without dissipation.

== Interactions and phenomena ==

=== Strong magnetic fields ===

In magnetic fields above 10 tesla, additional plateaus of the Hall conductivity at with are observed. A plateau at and the fractional quantum Hall effect at were also reported. 

These observations with indicate that the four-fold degeneracy (two valley and two spin degrees of freedom) of the Landau energy levels is partially or completely lifted.

=== Casimir effect ===

The Casimir effect is an interaction between disjoint neutral bodies provoked by the fluctuations of the electromagnetic vacuum. Mathematically, it can be explained by considering the normal modes of electromagnetic fields, which explicitly depend on the boundary conditions on the interacting bodies&#x27; surfaces. Due to graphene&#x27;s strong interaction with the electromagnetic field as a one-atom-thick material, the Casimir effect has garnered significant interest.

=== Van der Waals force ===

The Van der Waals force (or dispersion force) is also unusual, obeying an inverse cubic asymptotic power law in contrast to the usual inverse quartic law.

=== Permittivity ===

Graphene&#x27;s permittivity varies with frequency. Over a range from microwave to millimeter wave frequencies, it is approximately 3.3. This permittivity, combined with its ability to function as both a conductor and as an insulator, theoretically allows compact capacitors made of graphene to store large amounts of electrical energy.

== Optical properties ==
Graphene exhibits unique optical properties, showing unexpectedly high opacity for an atomic monolayer in vacuum, absorbing approximately of light from visible to infrared wavelengths, where &quot;α&quot; is the fine-structure constant. This is due to the unusual low-energy electronic structure of monolayer graphene, characterized by electron and hole conical bands meeting at the Dirac point, which is qualitatively different from more common quadratic massive bands. Based on the Slonczewski–Weiss–McClure (SWMcC) band model of graphite, calculations using Fresnel equations in the thin-film limit account for interatomic distance, hopping values, and frequency, thus assessing optical conductance.

Experimental verification, though confirmed, lacks the precision required to improve upon existing techniques for determining the fine-structure constant.

=== Multi-parametric surface plasmon resonance ===
Multi-parametric surface plasmon resonance has been utilized to characterize both the thickness and refractive index of chemical-vapor-deposition (CVD)-grown graphene films. At a wavelength of , measured refractive index and extinction coefficient values are 3.135 and 0.897, respectively. Thickness determination yielded 3.7 Å across a 0.5mm area, consistent with the 3.35 Å reported for layer-to-layer carbon atom distance of graphite crystals. This method is applicable for real-time label-free interactions of graphene with organic and inorganic substances. The existence of unidirectional surface plasmons in nonreciprocal graphene-based gyrotropic interfaces has been theoretically demonstrated, offering tunability from THz to near-infrared and visible frequencies by controlling graphene&#x27;s chemical potential. Particularly, the unidirectional frequency bandwidth can be 1– 2 orders of magnitude larger than that achievable with metal under similar magnetic field conditions, stemming from graphene&#x27;s extremely small effective electron mass.

=== Tunable band gap and optical response ===
Graphene&#x27;s band gap can be tuned from 0 to (about 5-micrometer wavelength) by applying a voltage to a dual-gate bilayer graphene field-effect transistor (FET) at room temperature. The optical response of graphene nanoribbons is tunable into the terahertz regime by an applied magnetic fields. Graphene/graphene oxide systems exhibit electrochromic behavior, enabling tuning of both linear and ultrafast optical properties.

=== Graphene-based Bragg grating ===
A graphene-based Bragg grating (one-dimensional photonic crystal) has been fabricated, demonstrating its capability to excite surface electromagnetic waves in periodic structure using a He–Ne laser as the light source.

=== Saturable absorption ===

Graphene exhibits unique saturable absorption, which saturates when the input optical intensity exceeds a threshold value. This nonlinear optical behavior, termed saturable absorption, occurs across the visible to near-infrared spectrum, due to graphene&#x27;s universal optical absorption and zero band gap. This property has enabled full-band mode-locking in fiber lasers using graphene-based saturable absorbers, contributing significantly to ultrafast photonics. Additionally, the optical response of graphene/graphene oxide layers can be electrically tuned.

Saturable absorption in graphene could occur at the Microwave and Terahertz band, owing to its wideband optical absorption property. The microwave-saturable absorption in graphene demonstrates the possibility of graphene microwaves and terahertz photonics devices, such as a microwave-saturable absorber, modulator, polarizer, microwave signal processing, and broadband wireless access networks.

=== Nonlinear Kerr effect ===

Under intense laser illumination, graphene exhibits a nonlinear phase shift due to the optical nonlinear Kerr effect. Graphene demonstrates a large nonlinear Kerr coefficient of , nearly nine orders of magnitude larger than that of bulk dielectrics, suggesting its potential as a powerful nonlinear Kerr medium capable of supporting various nonlinear effects, including solitons.

== Excitonic properties ==
First-principle calculations incorporating quasiparticle corrections and many-body effects have been employed to study the electronic and optical properties of graphene-based materials. The approach was described as three stages. With GW calculation, the properties of graphene-based materials were accurately investigated, including bulk graphene, nanoribbons, edge and surface functionalized armchair ribbons, hydrogen saturated armchair ribbons, Josephson effect in graphene SNS junctions with single localized defect and armchair ribbon scaling properties.

=== Spin transport ===

Graphene is considered an ideal material for spintronics due to its minimal spin–orbit interaction, the near absence of nuclear magnetic moments in carbon, and weak hyperfine interaction. Electrical injection and detection of spin current have been demonstrated up to room temperature, with spin coherence length exceeding 1 micrometer observed at this temperature. Control of spin current polarity via electrical gating has been achieved at low temperatures.

== Magnetic properties ==

=== Strong magnetic fields ===

Graphene&#x27;s quantum Hall effect in magnetic fields above approximately 10 tesla reveals additional interesting features. Additional plateaus in Hall conductivity at formula_14 with formula_15 have been observed, along with plateau at formula_16 and a fractional quantum Hall effect at formula_17.

These observations with formula_18 indicate that the four-fold degeneracy (two valley and two spin degrees of freedom) of the Landau energy levels is partially or completely lifted. One hypothesis proposes that magnetic catalysis of symmetry breaking is responsible for this degeneracy lift.

=== Spintronic properties ===
Graphene exhibits spintronic and magnetic properties concurrently. Low-defect graphene Nano-meshes, fabricated using a non-lithographic approach, exhibit significant ferromagnetism even at room temperature. Additionally, a spin pumping effect has been observed with fields applied in parallel to the planes of few-layer ferromagnetic nano-meshes, while a magnetoresistance hysteresis loop is evident under perpendicular fields. Charge-neutral graphene has demonstrated magnetoresistance exceeding 100% in magnetic fields generated by standard permanent magnets (approximately 0.1 tesla), marking a record magneto resistivity &quot;at room temperature&quot; among known materials.

=== Magnetic substrates ===
In 2010 researchers magnetized graphene by producing it via CVD on the Ni(111) substrate and then in 2014 by placing it on an atomically smooth layer of magnetic yttrium iron garnet, maintaining graphene&#x27;s electronic properties unaffected. Previous methods involved doping graphene with other substances. The dopant&#x27;s presence negatively affected its electronic properties.

== Mechanical properties ==
The (two-dimensional) density of graphene is 0.763 mg per square meter.

Graphene is the strongest material ever tested, with an intrinsic tensile strength of (with representative engineering tensile strength ~50-60 GPa for stretching large-area freestanding graphene) and a Young&#x27;s modulus (stiffness) close to . The Nobel announcement illustrated this by saying that a 1 square meter graphene hammock would support a cat but would weigh only as much as one of the cat&#x27;s whiskers, at (about 0.001% of the weight of of paper).

Large-angle bending of graphene monolayers with minimal strain demonstrates its mechanical robustness. Even under extreme deformation, monolayer graphene maintains excellent carrier mobility.

The spring constant of suspended graphene sheets has been measured using an atomic force microscope (AFM). Graphene sheets were suspended over cavities where an AFM tip was used to apply stress to the sheet to test its mechanical properties. Its spring constant was in the range 1–5  N/m and the stiffness was , which differs from that of bulk graphite. These intrinsic properties could lead to applications such as NEMS as pressure sensors and resonators. Due to its large surface energy and out of plane ductility, flat graphene sheets are unstable with respect to scrolling, i.e. bending into a cylindrical shape, which is its lower-energy state.

In two-dimensional structures like graphene, thermal and quantum fluctuations cause relative displacement, with fluctuations growing logarithmically with structure size as per the Mermin–Wagner theorem. This shows that the amplitude of long-wavelength fluctuations grows logarithmically with the scale of a 2D structure, and would therefore be unbounded in structures of infinite size. Local deformation and elastic strain are negligibly affected by this long-range divergence in relative displacement. It is believed that a sufficiently large 2D structure, in the absence of applied lateral tension, will bend and crumple to form a fluctuating 3D structure. Researchers have observed ripples in suspended layers of graphene, and it has been proposed that the ripples are caused by thermal fluctuations in the material. As a consequence of these dynamical deformations, it is debatable whether graphene is truly a 2D structure. These ripples, when amplified by vacancy defects, induce a negative Poisson&#x27;s ratio into graphene, resulting in the thinnest auxetic material known so far.

Graphene-nickel (Ni) composites, created through plating processes, exhibit enhanced mechanical properties due to strong Ni-graphene interactions inhibiting dislocation sliding in the Ni matrix.

=== Fracture toughness ===

In 2014, researchers from Rice University and the Georgia Institute of Technology have indicated that despite its strength, graphene is also relatively brittle, with a fracture toughness of about 4 MPa√m. This indicates that imperfect graphene is likely to crack in a brittle manner like ceramic materials, as opposed to many metallic materials which tend to have fracture toughness in the range of 15–50 MPa√m. Later in 2014, the Rice team announced that graphene showed a greater ability to distribute force from an impact than any known material, ten times that of steel per unit weight. The force was transmitted at .

=== Polycrystalline graphene ===

Various methods – most notably, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), as discussed in the section below – have been developed to produce large-scale graphene needed for device applications. Such methods often synthesize polycrystalline graphene. The mechanical properties of polycrystalline graphene are affected by the nature of the defects, such as grain-boundaries (GB) and vacancies, present in the system and the average grain-size.

Graphene grain boundaries typically contain heptagon-pentagon pairs. The arrangement of such defects depends on whether the GB is in a zig-zag or armchair direction. It further depends on the tilt-angle of the GB. In 2010, researchers from Brown University computationally predicted that as the tilt-angle increases, the grain boundary strength also increases. They showed that the weakest link in the grain boundary is at the critical bonds of the heptagon rings. As the grain boundary angle increases, the strain in these heptagon rings decreases, causing the grain boundary to be stronger than lower-angle GBs. They proposed that, in fact, for sufficiently large angle GB, the strength of the GB is similar to pristine graphene. In 2012, it was further shown that the strength can increase or decrease, depending on the detailed arrangements of the defects. These predictions have since been supported by experimental evidence. In a 2013 study led by James Hone&#x27;s group, researchers probed the elastic stiffness and strength of CVD-grown graphene by combining nano-indentation and high-resolution TEM. They found that the elastic stiffness is identical and strength is only slightly lower than those in pristine graphene. In the same year, researchers from University of California, Berkeley and University of California, Los Angeles probed bi-crystalline graphene with TEM and AFM. They found that the strength of grain boundaries indeed tends to increase with the tilt angle.

While the presence of vacancies is not only prevalent in polycrystalline graphene, vacancies can have significant effects on the strength of graphene. The consensus is that the strength decreases along with increasing densities of vacancies. Various studies have shown that for graphene with a sufficiently low density of vacancies, the strength does not vary significantly from that of pristine graphene. On the other hand, a high density of vacancies can severely reduce the strength of graphene.

Compared to the fairly well-understood nature of the effect that grain boundary and vacancies have on the mechanical properties of graphene, there is no clear consensus on the general effect that the average grain size has on the strength of polycrystalline graphene. In fact, three notable theoretical or computational studies on this topic have led to three different conclusions. First, in 2012, Kolakowski and Myer studied the mechanical properties of polycrystalline graphene with &quot;realistic atomistic model&quot;, using molecular-dynamics (MD) simulation. To emulate the growth mechanism of CVD, they first randomly selected nucleation sites that are at least 5A (arbitrarily chosen) apart from other sites. Polycrystalline graphene was generated from these nucleation sites and was subsequently annealed at 3000K, and then quenched. Based on this model, they found that cracks are initiated at grain-boundary junctions, but the grain size does not significantly affect the strength. Second, in 2013, Z. Song et al. used MD simulations to study the mechanical properties of polycrystalline graphene with uniform-sized hexagon-shaped grains. The hexagon grains were oriented in various lattice directions and the GBs consisted of only heptagon, pentagon, and hexagonal carbon rings. The motivation behind such a model was that similar systems had been experimentally observed in graphene flakes grown on the surface of liquid copper. While they also noted that crack is typically initiated at the triple junctions, they found that as the grain size decreases, the yield strength of graphene increases. Based on this finding, they proposed that polycrystalline follows pseudo Hall-Petch relationship. Third, in 2013, Z. D. Sha et al. studied the effect of grain size on the properties of polycrystalline graphene, by modeling the grain patches using Voronoi construction. The GBs in this model consisted of heptagons, pentagons, and hexagons, as well as squares, octagons, and vacancies. Through MD simulation, contrary to the aforementioned study, they found an inverse Hall-Petch relationship, where the strength of graphene increases as the grain size increases. Experimental observations and other theoretical predictions also gave differing conclusions, similar to the three given above. Such discrepancies show the complexity of the effects that grain size, arrangements of defects, and the nature of defects have on the mechanical properties of polycrystalline graphene.

=== Thermal conductivity ===

Thermal transport in graphene is a burgeoning area of research, particularly for its potential applications in thermal management. Most experimental measurements have posted large uncertainties in the results of thermal conductivity due to the limitations of the instruments used. Following predictions for graphene and related carbon nanotubes, early measurements of the thermal conductivity of suspended graphene reported an exceptionally large thermal conductivity up to , compared with the thermal conductivity of pyrolytic graphite of approximately at room temperature. However, later studies primarily on more scalable but more defected graphene derived by Chemical Vapor Deposition have been unable to reproduce such high thermal conductivity measurements, producing a wide range of thermal conductivities between – for suspended single-layer graphene. The large range in the reported thermal conductivity can be caused by large measurement uncertainties as well as variations in the graphene quality and processing conditions. In addition, it is known that when single-layer graphene is supported on an amorphous material, the thermal conductivity is reduced to about – at room temperature as a result of scattering of graphene lattice waves by the substrate, and can be even lower for few-layer graphene encased in amorphous oxide. Likewise, polymeric residue can contribute to a similar decrease in the thermal conductivity of suspended graphene to approximately – for bilayer graphene. 

Isotopic composition, specifically the ratio of 12C to 13C, significantly affects graphene&#x27;s thermal conductivity. Isotopically pure 12C graphene exhibits higher thermal conductivity than either a 50:50 isotope ratio or the naturally occurring 99:1 ratio. It can be shown by using the Wiedemann–Franz law, that the thermal conduction is phonon-dominated. However, for a gated graphene strip, an applied gate bias causing a Fermi energy shift much larger than &quot;k&quot;B&quot;T&quot; can cause the electronic contribution to increase and dominate over the phonon contribution at low temperatures. The ballistic thermal conductance of graphene is isotropic.

Graphite, a 3D counterpart to graphene, exhibits a basal plane thermal conductivity exceeding (similar to diamond), In graphite, the c-axis (out of plane) thermal conductivity is over a factor of ~100 smaller due to the weak binding forces between basal planes as well as the larger lattice spacing. In addition, the ballistic thermal conductance of graphene is shown to give the lower limit of the ballistic thermal conductance, per unit circumference, length of carbon nanotubes.

Graphene&#x27;s thermal conductivity is influenced by its three acoustic phonon modes: two linear dispersion relation dispersion relation in-plane modes (LA, TA) and one quadratic dispersion relation out-of-plane mode (ZA). At low temperatures, the dominance of the T1.5 thermal conductivity contribution of the out-of-plane mode supersedes the &quot;T&quot;2 dependence of the linear modes. Some graphene phonon bands exhibit negative Grüneisen parameters, resulting in negative thermal expansion coefficient at low temperatures. The lowest negative Grüneisen parameters correspond to the lowest transverse acoustic ZA modes, whose frequencies increase with in-plane lattice parameter, akin to a stretched string with higher frequency vibrations.

=== Chemical properties ===

Graphene has a theoretical specific surface area (SSA) of . This is much larger than that reported to date for carbon black (typically smaller than ) or for carbon nanotubes (CNTs), from ≈100 to and is similar to activated carbon.
Graphene is the only form of carbon (or solid material) in which every atom is available for chemical reaction from two sides (due to the 2D structure). Atoms at the edges of a graphene sheet have special chemical reactivity. Graphene has the highest ratio of edge atoms of any allotrope. Defects within a sheet increase its chemical reactivity. The onset temperature of reaction between the basal plane of single-layer graphene and oxygen gas is below . Graphene burns at very low temperatures (e.g., ). Graphene is commonly modified with oxygen- and nitrogen-containing functional groups and analyzed by infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. However, the determination of structures of graphene with oxygen- and nitrogen- functional groups require the structures to be well controlled.

In 2013, Stanford University physicists reported that single-layer graphene is a hundred times more chemically reactive than thicker multilayer sheets.

Graphene can self-repair holes in its sheets, when exposed to molecules containing carbon, such as hydrocarbons. Bombarded with pure carbon atoms, the atoms perfectly align into hexagons, filling the holes.

=== Biological properties ===

Despite the promising results in different cell studies and proof of concept studies, there is still incomplete understanding of the full biocompatibility of graphene-based materials. Different cell lines react differently when exposed to graphene, and it has been shown that the lateral size of the graphene flakes, the form and surface chemistry can elicit different biological responses on the same cell line.

There are indications that graphene has promise as a useful material for interacting with neural cells; studies on cultured neural cells show limited success.

Graphene also has some utility in osteogenesis. Researchers at the Graphene Research Centre at the National University of Singapore (NUS) discovered in 2011 the ability of graphene to accelerate the osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells without the use of biochemical inducers.

Graphene can be used in biosensors; in 2015, researchers demonstrated that a graphene-based sensor can be used to detect a cancer risk biomarker. In particular, by using epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide, they were repeatedly able to detect 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a DNA damage biomarker.

=== Support substrate ===

The electronic property of graphene can be significantly influenced by the supporting substrate. Studies of graphene monolayers on clean and hydrogen(H)-passivated silicon (100) (Si(100)/H) surfaces have been performed. The Si(100)/H surface does not perturb the electronic properties of graphene, whereas the interaction between the clean Si(100) surface and graphene changes the electronic states of graphene significantly. This effect results from the covalent bonding between C and surface Si atoms, modifying the π-orbital network of the graphene layer. The local density of states shows that the bonded C and Si surface states are highly disturbed near the Fermi energy.

== Graphene layers and structural variants ==
=== Monolayer sheets ===

In 2013 a group of Polish scientists presented a production unit that allows the manufacture of continuous monolayer sheets. The process is based on graphene growth on a liquid metal matrix. The product of this process was called High Strength Metallurgical Graphene. In a new study published in Nature, the researchers have used a single-layer graphene electrode and a novel surface-sensitive non-linear spectroscopy technique to investigate the top-most water layer at the electrochemically charged surface. They found that the interfacial water response to the applied electric field is asymmetric concerning the nature of the applied field.

=== Bilayer graphene ===
Bilayer graphene displays the anomalous quantum Hall effect, a tunable band gap and potential for excitonic condensation –making it a promising candidate for optoelectronic and nanoelectronic applications. Bilayer graphene typically can be found either in twisted configurations where the two layers are rotated relative to each other or graphitic Bernal stacked configurations where half the atoms in one layer lie atop half the atoms in the other. Stacking order and orientation govern the optical and electronic properties of bilayer graphene.

One way to synthesize bilayer graphene is via chemical vapor deposition, which can produce large bilayer regions that almost exclusively conform to a Bernal stack geometry.

It has been shown that the two graphene layers can withstand important strain or doping mismatch which ultimately should lead to their exfoliation.

=== Turbostratic ===

Turbostratic graphene exhibits weak interlayer coupling, and the spacing is increased with respect to Bernal-stacked multilayer graphene. Rotational misalignment preserves the 2D electronic structure, as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. The D peak is very weak, whereas the 2D and G peaks remain prominent.

A rather peculiar feature is that the I2D/IG ratio can exceed 10. However, most importantly, the M peak, which originates from AB stacking, is absent, whereas the TS1 and TS2 modes are visible in the Raman spectrum. The material is formed through conversion of non-graphenic carbon into graphenic carbon without providing sufficient energy to allow for the reorganization through annealing of adjacent graphene layers into crystalline graphitic structures.

=== Graphene superlattices ===

Periodically stacked graphene and its insulating isomorph provide a fascinating structural element in implementing highly functional superlattices at the atomic scale, which offers possibilities for designing nanoelectronic and photonic devices. Various types of superlattices can be obtained by stacking graphene and its related forms. The energy band in layer-stacked superlattices is found to be more sensitive to the barrier width than that in conventional III–V semiconductor superlattices. When adding more than one atomic layer to the barrier in each period, the coupling of electronic wavefunctions in neighboring potential wells can be significantly reduced, which leads to the degeneration of continuous subbands into quantized energy levels. When varying the well width, the energy levels in the potential wells along the L-M direction behave distinctly from those along the K-H direction.

A superlattice corresponds to a periodic or quasi-periodic arrangement of different materials and can be described by a superlattice period which confers a new translational symmetry to the system, impacting their phonon dispersions and subsequently their thermal transport properties. Recently, uniform monolayer graphene-hBN structures have been successfully synthesized via lithography patterning coupled with chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Furthermore, superlattices of graphene-HBN are ideal model systems for the realization and understanding of coherent (wave-like) and incoherent (particle-like) phonon thermal transport.

== Nanostructured graphene forms ==
=== Graphene nanoribbons ===


Graphene nanoribbons (&quot;nanostripes&quot; in the &quot;zig-zag&quot;/&quot;zigzag&quot; orientation), at low temperatures, show spin-polarized metallic edge currents, which also suggests applications in the new field of spintronics. (In the &quot;armchair&quot; orientation, the edges behave like semiconductors.) 

=== Graphene quantum dots ===

A graphene quantum dot (GQD) is a graphene fragment with a size lesser than 100 nm. The properties of GQDs are different from bulk graphene due to the quantum confinement effects which only become apparent when the size is smaller than 100 nm.

== Modified and functionalized graphene ==
=== Graphene oxide ===
Graphene oxide is usually produced through chemical exfoliation of graphite. A particularly popular technique is the improved Hummers&#x27; method. Using paper-making techniques on dispersed, oxidized and chemically processed graphite in water, the monolayer flakes form a single sheet and create strong bonds. These sheets, called graphene oxide paper, have a measured tensile modulus of 32 GPa. The chemical property of graphite oxide is related to the functional groups attached to graphene sheets. These can change the polymerization pathway and similar chemical processes. Graphene oxide flakes in polymerss display enhanced photo-conducting properties. Graphene is normally hydrophobic and impermeable to all gases and liquids (vacuum-tight). However, when formed into a graphene oxide-based capillary membrane, both liquid water and water vapor flow through as quickly as if the membrane were not present.

In 2022, researchers evaluated the biological effects of low doses on graphene oxide on larvae and imago of &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;. Results show that oral administration of graphene oxide at concentrations of 0.02-1% has a beneficial effect on the developmental rate and hatching ability of larvae. Long-term administration of a low dose of graphene oxide extends the lifespan of Drosophila and significantly enhances resistance to environmental stresses. These suggest that graphene oxide affects carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in adult Drosophila. These findings might provide a useful reference to assess the biological effects of graphene oxide, which could play an important role in a variety of graphene-based biomedical applications.

=== Chemical modification ===

 Soluble fragments of graphene can be prepared in the laboratory through chemical modification of graphite. First, microcrystalline graphite is treated with an acidic mixture of sulfuric acid and nitric acid. A series of oxidation and exfoliation steps produce small graphene plates with carboxyl groups at their edges. These are converted to acid chloride groups by treatment with thionyl chloride; next, they are converted to the corresponding graphene amide via treatment with octadecyl amine. The resulting material (circular graphene layers of thickness) is soluble in tetrahydrofuran, tetrachloromethane and dichloroethane.

Refluxing single-layer graphene oxide (SLGO) in solvents leads to size reduction and folding of individual sheets as well as loss of carboxylic group functionality, by up to 20%, indicating thermal instabilities of SLGO sheets dependent on their preparation methodology. When using thionyl chloride, acyl chloride groups result, which can then form aliphatic and aromatic amides with a reactivity conversion of around 70–80%.

Hydrazine reflux is commonly used for reducing SLGO to SLG(R), but titrations show that only around 20–30% of the carboxylic groups are lost, leaving a significant number available for chemical attachment. Analysis of SLG(R) generated by this route reveals that the system is unstable and using a room temperature stirring with hydrochloric acid (&lt; 1.0 M) leads to around 60% loss of COOH functionality. Room temperature treatment of SLGO with carbodiimides leads to the collapse of the individual sheets into star-like clusters that exhibited poor subsequent reactivity with amines (c. 3–5% conversion of the intermediate to the final amide). It is apparent that conventional chemical treatment of carboxylic groups on SLGO generates morphological changes of individual sheets that leads to a reduction in chemical reactivity, which may potentially limit their use in composite synthesis. Therefore, chemical reaction types have been explored. SLGO has also been grafted with polyallylamine, cross-linked through epoxy groups. When filtered into graphene oxide paper, these composites exhibit increased stiffness and strength relative to unmodified graphene oxide paper.

Full hydrogenation from both sides of the graphene sheet results in Graphane, but partial hydrogenation leads to hydrogenated graphene. Similarly, both-side fluorination of graphene (or chemical and mechanical exfoliation of graphite fluoride) leads to fluorographene (graphene fluoride), while partial fluorination (generally halogenation) provides fluorinated (halogenated) graphene.

=== Graphene ligand/complex ===

Graphene can be a ligand to coordinate metals and metal ions by introducing functional groups. Structures of graphene ligands are similar to e.g. metal-porphyrin complex, metal-phthalocyanine complex, and metal-phenanthroline complex. Copper and nickel ions can be coordinated with graphene ligands.

== Advanced graphene structures ==
=== Graphene fiber ===
In 2011, researchers reported a novel yet simple approach to fabricating graphene fibers from chemical vapor deposition-grown graphene films. The method was scalable and controllable, delivering tunable morphology and pore structure by controlling the evaporation of solvents with suitable surface tension. Flexible all-solid-state supercapacitors based on these graphene fibers were demonstrated in 2013.

In 2015, intercalating small graphene fragments into the gaps formed by larger, coiled graphene sheets, after annealing provided pathways for conduction, while the fragments helped reinforce the fibers. The resulting fibers offered better thermal and electrical conductivity and mechanical strength. Thermal conductivity reached , while tensile strength reached .

In 2016, kilometer-scale continuous graphene fibers with outstanding mechanical properties and excellent electrical conductivity were produced by high-throughput wet-spinning of graphene oxide liquid crystals followed by graphitization through a full-scale synergetic defect-engineering strategy. The graphene fibers with superior performances promise wide applications in functional textiles, lightweight motors, microelectronic devices, etc.

Tsinghua University in Beijing, led by Wei Fei of the Department of Chemical Engineering, claims to be able to create a carbon nanotube fiber that has a tensile strength of .

=== 3D graphene ===

In 2013, a three-dimensional honeycomb of hexagonally arranged carbon was termed 3D graphene, and self-supporting 3D graphene was also produced. 3D structures of graphene can be fabricated by using either CVD or solution-based methods. A 2016 review by Khurram and Xu et al. provided a summary of then-state-of-the-art techniques for fabrication of the 3D structure of graphene and other related two-dimensional materials. In 2013, researchers at Stony Brook University reported a novel radical-initiated crosslinking method to fabricate porous 3D free-standing architectures of graphene and carbon nanotubes using nanomaterials as building blocks without any polymer matrix as support. These 3D graphenes (all-carbon) scaffolds/foams have applications in several fields such as energy storage, filtration, thermal management, and biomedical devices and implants.

Box-shaped graphene (BSG) nanostructure appearing after mechanical cleavage of pyrolytic graphite was reported in 2016. The discovered nanostructure is a multilayer system of parallel hollow nanochannels located along the surface and having quadrangular cross-section. The thickness of the channel walls is approximately equal to 1 nm. Potential fields of BSG application include ultra-sensitive detectors, high-performance catalytic cells, nanochannels for DNA sequencing and manipulation, high-performance heat sinking surfaces, rechargeable batteries of enhanced performance, nanomechanical resonators, electron multiplication channels in emission Nano-electronic devices, high-capacity sorbents for safe hydrogen storage.

Three dimensional bilayer graphene has also been reported.

=== Pillared graphene ===
Pillared graphene is a hybrid carbon, structure consisting of an oriented array of carbon nanotubes connected at each end to a sheet of graphene. It was first described theoretically by George Froudakis and colleagues at the University of Crete in Greece in 2008. Pillared graphene has not yet been synthesized in the laboratory, but it has been suggested that it may have useful electronic properties, or as a hydrogen storage material.

=== Reinforced graphene ===

Graphene reinforced with embedded carbon nanotube reinforcing bars (&quot;rebar&quot;) is easier to manipulate, while improving the electrical and mechanical qualities of both materials.

Functionalized single- or multi-walled carbon nanotubes are spin-coated on copper foils and then heated and cooled, using the nanotubes themselves as the carbon source. Under heating, the functional carbon groups decompose into graphene, while the nanotubes partially split and form in-plane covalent bonds with the graphene, adding strength. π–π stacking domains add more strength. The nanotubes can overlap, making the material a better conductor than standard CVD-grown graphene. The nanotubes effectively bridge the grain boundaries found in conventional graphene. The technique eliminates the traces of substrate on which later-separated sheets were deposited using epitaxy.

Stacks of a few layers have been proposed as a cost-effective and physically flexible replacement for indium tin oxide (ITO) used in displays and photovoltaic cells.

=== Molded graphene ===

In 2015, researchers from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) developed a new approach for forming 3D shapes from flat, 2D sheets of graphene. A film of graphene that had been soaked in solvent to make it swell and become malleable was overlaid on an underlying substrate &quot;former&quot;. The solvent evaporated over time, leaving behind a layer of graphene that had taken on the shape of the underlying structure. In this way, they were able to produce a range of relatively intricate micro-structured shapes. Features vary from 3.5 to 50 μm. Pure graphene and gold-decorated graphene were each successfully integrated with the substrate.

== Specialized graphene configurations ==
=== Graphene aerogel ===

An aerogel made of graphene layers separated by carbon nanotubes was measured at 0.16 milligrams per cubic centimeter. A solution of graphene and carbon nanotubes in a mold is freeze-dried to dehydrate the solution, leaving the aerogel. The material has superior elasticity and absorption. It can recover completely after more than 90% compression, and absorb up to 900 times its weight in oil, at a rate of 68.8 grams per second.

=== Graphene nanocoil ===

In 2015, a coiled form of graphene was discovered in graphitic carbon (coal). The spiraling effect is produced by defects in the material&#x27;s hexagonal grid that causes it to spiral along its edge, mimicking a Riemann surface, with the graphene surface approximately perpendicular to the axis. When voltage is applied to such a coil, current flows around the spiral, producing a magnetic field. The phenomenon applies to spirals with either zigzag or armchair patterns, although with different current distributions. Computer simulations indicated that a conventional spiral inductor of 205 microns in diameter could be matched by a nanocoil just 70 nanometers wide, with a field strength reaching as much as 1 tesla.

The nano-solenoids analyzed through computer models at Rice University should be capable of producing powerful magnetic fields of about 1 tesla, about the same as the coils found in typical loudspeakers, according to Yakobson and his team – and about the same field strength as some MRI machines. They found the magnetic field would be strongest in the hollow, nanometer-wide cavity at the spiral&#x27;s center.

A solenoid made with such a coil behaves as a quantum conductor whose current distribution between the core and exterior varies with applied voltage, resulting in nonlinear inductance.

=== Crumpled graphene ===

In 2016, Brown University introduced a method for &quot;crumpling&quot; graphene, adding wrinkles to the material on a nanoscale. This was achieved by depositing layers of graphene oxide onto a shrink film, then shrunken, with the film dissolved before being shrunken again on another sheet of film. The crumpled graphene became superhydrophobic, and when used as a battery electrode, the material was shown to have as much as a 400% increase in electrochemical current density.

== Mechanical synthesis ==
A rapidly increasing list of production techniques have been developed to enable graphene&#x27;s use in commercial applications.

Isolated 2D crystals cannot be grown via chemical synthesis beyond small sizes even in principle, because the rapid growth of phonon density with increasing lateral size forces 2D crystallites to bend into the third dimension. In all cases, graphene must bond to a substrate to retain its two-dimensional shape.

=== Bottom-up and top-down methods ===
Small graphene structures, such as graphene quantum dots and nanoribbons, can be produced by &quot;bottom-up&quot; methods that assemble the lattice from organic molecule monomers (e. g. citric acid, glucose). &quot;Top-down&quot; methods, on the other hand, cut bulk graphite and graphene materials with strong chemicals (e. g. mixed acids).

=== Micro-mechanical cleavage ===
The most famous, clean and rather straight-forward method of isolating graphene sheets, called micro-mechanical cleavage or more colloquially called the scotch tape method, was introduced by Novoselov et al. in 2004, which uses adhesive tape to mechanically cleave high-quality graphite crystals into successively thinner platelets. Other methods do exist like exfoliation.

=== Exfoliation techniques ===

==== Mechanical exfoliation ====
Geim and Novoselov initially used adhesive tape to pull graphene sheets away from graphite. Achieving single layers typically requires multiple exfoliation steps. After exfoliation, the flakes are deposited on a silicon wafer. Crystallites larger than 1 mm and visible to the naked eye can be obtained.

As of 2014, exfoliation produced graphene with the lowest number of defects and highest electron mobility. Alternatively, a sharp single-crystal diamond wedge can penetrate onto the graphite source to cleave layers. In the same year, defect-free, unoxidized graphene-containing liquids were made from graphite using mixers that produce local shear rates greater than .

Shear exfoliation is another method in which by using a rotor-stator mixer the scalable production of defect-free graphene has become possible. It has been shown that, as turbulence is not necessary for mechanical exfoliation, ResonantAcoustic mixing or low speed ball milling is effective in the production of high-yield and water-soluble graphene.

==== Liquid phase exfoliation ====
Liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) is a relatively simple method that involves dispersing graphite in a liquid medium to produce graphene by sonication or high shear mixing, followed by centrifugation. Restacking is an issue with this technique unless solvents with appropriate surface energy are used (e.g. NMP). Adding a surfactant to a solvent prior to sonication prevents restacking by adsorbing to the graphene&#x27;s surface. This produces a higher graphene concentration, but removing the surfactant requires chemical treatments.

LPE results in nanosheets with a broad size distribution and thicknesses roughly in the range of 1-10 monolayers. However, liquid cascade centrifugation can be used to size-select the suspensions and achieve monolayer enrichment.

Sonicating graphite at the interface of two immiscible liquids, most notably heptane and water, produced macro-scale graphene films. The graphene sheets are adsorbed to the high-energy interface between the materials and are kept from restacking. The sheets are up to about 95% transparent and conductive.

With definite cleavage parameters, the box-shaped graphene (BSG) nanostructure can be prepared on graphite crystal. A major advantage of LPE is that it can be used to exfoliate many inorganic 2D materials beyond graphene, e.g. BN, MoS2, WS2.

==== Exfoliation with supercritical carbon dioxide ====
Liquid-phase exfoliation can also be done by a less-known process of intercalating supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) into the interstitial spaces in the graphite lattice, followed by rapid depressurization. The scCO2 intercalates easily inside the graphite lattice at a pressure of roughly 100 atm. Carbon dioxide turns gaseous as soon as the vessel is depressurized and makes the graphite explode into few-layered graphene.

This method may have multiple advantages: being non-toxic, the graphite does not have to be chemically treated in any way before the process, and the whole process can be completed in a single step as opposed to other exfoliation methods.

=== Splitting monolayer carbon allotropes ===
Graphene can be created by opening carbon nanotubes by cutting or etching. In one such method, multi-walled carbon nanotubes were cut open in solution by action of potassium permanganate and sulfuric acid. In 2014, carbon nanotube-reinforced graphene was made via spin coating and annealing functionalized carbon nanotubes.

Another approach sprays buckyballs at supersonic speeds onto a substrate. The balls cracked open upon impact, and the resulting unzipped cages then bond together to form a graphene film.

== Chemical synthesis ==

=== Graphite oxide reduction ===
P. Boehm reported producing monolayer flakes of reduced graphene oxide in 1962. Rapid heating of graphite oxide and exfoliation yields highly dispersed carbon powder with a few percent of graphene flakes.

Another method is the reduction of graphite oxide monolayer films, e.g. by hydrazine with annealing in argon/hydrogen with an almost intact carbon framework that allows efficient removal of functional groups. Measured charge carrier mobility exceeded 1,000 cm/Vs (10 m/Vs).

Burning a graphite oxide coated DVD produced a conductive graphene film (1,738 siemens per meter) and specific surface area (1,520 square meters per gram) that was highly resistant and malleable.

A dispersed reduced graphene oxide suspension was synthesized in water by a hydrothermal dehydration method without using any surfactant. The approach is facile, industrially applicable, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective. Viscosity measurements confirmed that the graphene colloidal suspension (graphene nanofluid) exhibits Newtonian behavior, with the viscosity showing a close resemblance to that of water.

=== Molten salts ===
Graphite particles can be corroded in molten salts to form a variety of carbon nanostructures including graphene. Hydrogen cations, dissolved in molten lithium chloride, can be discharged on cathodically-polarized graphite rods, which then intercalate, peeling graphene sheets. The graphene nanosheets produced displayed a single-crystalline structure with a lateral size of several hundred nanometers and a high degree of crystallinity and thermal stability.

=== Electrochemical synthesis ===
Electrochemical synthesis can exfoliate graphene. Varying a pulsed voltage controls thickness, flake area, and number of defects and affects its properties. The process begins by bathing the graphite in a solvent for intercalation. The process can be tracked by monitoring the solution&#x27;s transparency with an LED and photodiode.

=== Hydrothermal self-assembly ===
Graphene has been prepared by using a sugar like glucose, fructose, etc. This substrate-free &quot;bottom-up&quot; synthesis is safer, simpler and more environmentally friendly than exfoliation. The method can control the thickness, ranging from monolayer to multilayer, which is known as the &quot;Tang-Lau Method&quot;.

=== Sodium ethoxide pyrolysis ===
Gram-quantities were produced by the reaction of ethanol with sodium metal, followed by pyrolysis and washing with water.

=== Microwave-assisted oxidation ===
In 2012, microwave energy was reported to directly synthesize graphene in one step. This approach avoids use of potassium permanganate in the reaction mixture. It was also reported that by microwave radiation assistance, graphene oxide with or without holes can be synthesized by controlling microwave time. Microwave heating can dramatically shorten the reaction time from days to seconds.

Graphene can also be made by microwave assisted hydrothermal pyrolysis.

=== Thermal decomposition of silicon carbide ===
Heating silicon carbide (SiC) to high temperatures () under low pressures (c. 10−6 torr, or 10−4 Pa) reduces it to graphene.

== Vapor deposition and growth techniques ==

=== Chemical vapor deposition ===
==== Epitaxy ====
Epitaxial graphene growth on silicon carbide is a wafer-scale technique to produce graphene. Epitaxial graphene may be coupled to surfaces weakly enough (by the active valence electrons that create Van der Waals forces) to retain the two-dimensional electronic band structure of isolated graphene.

A normal silicon wafer coated with a layer of germanium (Ge) dipped in dilute hydrofluoric acid strips the naturally forming germanium oxide groups, creating hydrogen-terminated germanium. CVD can coat that with graphene.

The direct synthesis of graphene on insulator TiO2 with high-dielectric-constant (high-κ). A two-step CVD process is shown to grow graphene directly on TiO2 crystals or exfoliated TiO2 nanosheets without using any metal catalyst.

==== Metal substrates ====

CVD graphene can be grown on metal substrates including ruthenium, iridium, nickel and copper.

==== Roll-to-roll ====

In 2014, a two-step roll-to-roll manufacturing process was announced. The first roll-to-roll step produces the graphene via chemical vapor deposition. The second step binds the graphene to a substrate.
==== Cold wall ====

Growing graphene in an industrial resistive-heating cold wall CVD system was claimed to produce graphene 100 times faster than conventional CVD systems, cut costs by 99%, and produce material with enhanced electronic qualities.

==== Wafer scale CVD graphene ====

CVD graphene is scalable and has been grown on deposited Cu thin film catalyst on 100 to 300 mm standard Si/SiO2 wafers on an Axitron Black Magic system. Monolayer graphene coverage of &gt;95% is achieved on 100 to 300 mm wafer substrates with negligible defects, confirmed by extensive Raman mapping.

=== Solvent interface trapping method (SITM) ===

As reported by a group led by D. H. Adamson, graphene can be produced from natural graphite while preserving the integrity of the sheets using the solvent interface trapping method (SITM). SITM uses a high-energy interface, such as oil and water, to exfoliate graphite to graphene. Stacked graphite delaminates, or spreads, at the oil/water interface to produce few-layer graphene in a thermodynamically favorable process in much the same way as small molecule surfactants spread to minimize the interfacial energy. In this way, graphene behaves like a 2D surfactant. SITM has been reported for a variety of applications such conductive polymer-graphene foams, conductive polymer-graphene microspheres, conductive thin films and conductive inks.

=== Carbon dioxide reduction ===

A highly exothermic reaction combusts magnesium in an oxidation-reduction reaction with carbon dioxide, producing carbon nanoparticles including graphene and fullerenes.

=== Supersonic spray ===

Supersonic acceleration of droplets through a Laval nozzle was used to deposit reduced graphene oxide on a substrate. The energy of the impact rearranges those carbon atoms into flawless graphene.

=== Laser ===

In 2014, a infrared laser was used to produce patterned porous three-dimensional laser-induced graphene (LIG) film networks from commercial polymer films. The resulting material exhibits high electrical conductivity and surface area. The laser induction process is compatible with roll-to-roll manufacturing processes. A similar material, laser-induced graphene fibers (LIGF), was reported in 2018.

=== Flash Joule heating ===

In 2019, flash Joule heating (transient high-temperature electrothermal heating) was discovered to be a method to synthesize turbostratic graphene in bulk powder form. The method involves electrothermally converting various carbon sources, such as carbon black, coal, and food waste into micron-scale flakes of graphene. More recent works demonstrated the use of mixed plastic waste, waste rubber tires, and pyrolysis ash as carbon feedstocks. The graphenization process is kinetically controlled, and the energy dose is chosen to preserve the carbon in its graphenic state (excessive energy input leads to subsequent graphitization through annealing).

=== Ion implantation ===

Accelerating carbon ions inside an electrical field into a semiconductor made of thin nickel films on a substrate of SiO2/Si, creates a wafer-scale () wrinkle/tear/residue-free graphene layer at a relatively low temperature of 500 °C.

=== CMOS-compatible graphene ===

Integration of graphene in the widely employed CMOS fabrication process demands its transfer-free direct synthesis on dielectric substrates at temperatures below 500 °C. At the IEDM 2018, researchers from University of California, Santa Barbara, demonstrated a novel CMOS-compatible graphene synthesis process at 300 °C suitable for back-end-of-line (BEOL) applications. The process involves pressure-assisted solid-state diffusion of carbon through a thin-film of metal catalyst. The synthesized large-area graphene films were shown to exhibit high quality (via Raman characterization) and similar resistivity values when compared with high-temperature CVD synthesized graphene films of the same cross-section down to widths of 20 nm.

== Simulation ==

In addition to experimental investigation of graphene and graphene-based devices, numerical modeling and simulation of graphene has also been an important research topic. The Kubo formula provides an analytic expression for the graphene&#x27;s conductivity and shows that it is a function of several physical parameters including wavelength, temperature, and chemical potential. Moreover, a surface conductivity model, which describes graphene as an infinitesimally thin (two-sided) sheet with a local and isotropic conductivity, has been proposed. This model permits the derivation of analytical expressions for the electromagnetic field in the presence of a graphene sheet in terms of a dyadic Green function (represented using Sommerfeld integrals) and exciting electric current.

Even though these analytical models and methods can provide results for several canonical problems for benchmarking purposes, many practical problems involving graphene, such as the design of arbitrarily shaped electromagnetic devices, are analytically intractable. With the recent advances in the field of computational electromagnetics (CEM), various accurate and efficient numerical methods have become available for analysis of electromagnetic field/wave interactions on graphene sheets and/or graphene-based devices. A comprehensive summary of computational tools developed for analyzing graphene-based devices/systems is proposed.

== Graphene analogs ==

Graphene analogs (also referred to as &quot;artificial graphene&quot;) are two-dimensional systems which exhibit similar properties to graphene. Graphene analogs have been studied intensively since the discovery of graphene in 2004. People try to develop systems in which the physics is easier to observe and manipulate than in graphene. In those systems, electrons are not always the particles that are used. They might be optical photons, microwave photons, plasmons, microcavity polaritons, or even atoms. Also, the honeycomb structure in which those particles evolve can be of a different nature than carbon atoms in graphene. It can be, respectively, a photonic crystal, an array of metallic rods, metallic nanoparticles, a lattice of coupled microcavities, or an optical lattice.

== Applications ==
Graphene is a transparent and flexible conductor that holds great promise for various material/device applications, including solar cells, light-emitting diodes (LED), integrated photonic circuit devices, touch panels, and smart windows or phones. Smartphone products with graphene touch screens are already on the market.

In 2013, Head announced their new range of graphene tennis racquets.

As of 2015, there is one product available for commercial use: a graphene-infused printer powder. Many other uses for graphene have been proposed or are under development, in areas including electronics, biological engineering, filtration, lightweight/strong composite materials, photovoltaics and energy storage. Graphene is often produced as a powder and as a dispersion in a polymer matrix. This dispersion is supposedly suitable for advanced composites, paints and coatings, lubricants, oils and functional fluids, capacitors and batteries, thermal management applications, display materials and packaging, solar cells, inks and 3D-printer materials, and barriers and films.

On August 2, 2016, Briggs Automative Company&#x27;s new Mono model is said to be made out of graphene as the first of both a street-legal track car and a production car.

In January 2018, graphene-based spiral inductors exploiting kinetic inductance at room temperature were first demonstrated at the University of California, Santa Barbara, led by Kaustav Banerjee. These inductors were predicted to allow significant miniaturization in radio-frequency integrated circuit applications.

The potential of epitaxial graphene on SiC for metrology has been shown since 2010, displaying quantum Hall resistance quantization accuracy of three parts per billion in monolayer epitaxial graphene. Over the years precisions of parts-per-trillion in the Hall resistance quantization and giant quantum Hall plateaus have been demonstrated. Developments in the encapsulation and doping of epitaxial graphene have led to the commercialization of epitaxial graphene quantum resistance standards.

Novel uses for graphene continue to be researched and explored. One such use is in combination with water-based epoxy resins to produce anticorrosive coatings. The van der Waals nature of graphene and other two-dimensional (2D) materials also permits van der Waals heterostructures and integrated circuits based on Van der Waals integration of 2D materials.

Graphene is utilized in detecting gasses and chemicals in environmental monitoring, developing highly sensitive biosensors for medical diagnostics, and creating flexible, wearable sensors for health monitoring. Graphene&#x27;s transparency also enhances optical sensors, making them more effective in imaging and spectroscopy.

== Toxicity ==

One review on graphene toxicity published in 2016 by Lalwani et al. summarizes the in vitro, in vivo, antimicrobial and environmental effects and highlights the various mechanisms of graphene toxicity. Another review published in 2016 by Ou et al. focused on graphene-family nanomaterials (GFNs) and revealed several typical mechanisms such as physical destruction, oxidative stress, DNA damage, inflammatory response, apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis.

A 2020 study showed that the toxicity of graphene is dependent on several factors such as shape, size, purity, post-production processing steps, oxidative state, functional groups, dispersion state, synthesis methods, route and dose of administration, and exposure times.

In 2014, research at Stony Brook University showed that graphene nanoribbons, graphene nanoplatelets, and graphene nano–onions are non-toxic at concentrations up to 50 μg/ml. These nanoparticles do not alter the differentiation of human bone marrow stem cells towards osteoblasts (bone) or adipocytes (fat), suggesting that at low doses, graphene nanoparticles are safe for biomedical applications. In 2013, research at Brown University found that 10 μm few-layered graphene flakes can pierce cell membranes in solution. They were observed to enter initially via sharp and jagged points, allowing graphene to be internalized in the cell. The physiological effects of this remain unknown, and this remains a relatively unexplored field.

<text>John Arnold Griffin III (April 24, 1928 – July 25, 2008) was an American jazz tenor saxophonist. Nicknamed &quot;the Little Giant&quot; for his short stature and forceful playing, Griffin&#x27;s career began in the mid-1940s and continued until the month of his death. A pioneering figure in hard bop, Griffin recorded prolifically as a bandleader in addition to stints with pianist Thelonious Monk, drummer Art Blakey, in partnership with fellow tenor Eddie &quot;Lockjaw&quot; Davis and as a member of the Kenny Clarke/Francy Boland Big Band after he moved to Europe in the 1960s. In 1995, Griffin was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music.

== Early life and career ==
Griffin studied music at DuSable High School in Chicago under Walter Dyett, starting out on clarinet before moving on to oboe and then alto saxophone. While still at high school at the age of 15, Griffin was playing with T-Bone Walker in a band led by Walker&#x27;s brother.

Alto saxophone was still his instrument of choice when he joined Lionel Hampton&#x27;s big band, three days after his high school graduation, but Hampton encouraged him to take up the tenor, playing alongside Arnett Cobb. He first appeared on a Los Angeles recording with Hampton&#x27;s band in 1945 at the age of 17.

By mid-1947, Griffin and fellow Hampton band member Joe Morris, had formed a sextet made up of local musicians, including George Freeman, where he remained for the next two years. His playing can be heard on early rhythm and blues recordings for Atlantic Records. By 1951, Griffin was playing baritone saxophone in an R&amp;B septet led by former bandmate Arnett Cobb.

After returning to Chicago from two years in the Army, Griffin began to establish a reputation as one of the premiere saxophonists in that city. Thelonious Monk enthusiastically encouraged Orrin Keepnews of the Riverside label to sign the young tenor, but before he could act Blue Note had signed Griffin.

He joined Art Blakey&#x27;s Jazz Messengers in 1957, and his recordings from that time include an album joining together the Messengers and Thelonious Monk. Griffin then succeeded John Coltrane as a member of Monk&#x27;s Five Spot quartet; he can be heard on the albums &quot;Thelonious in Action&quot; and &quot;Misterioso.&quot;

Griffin&#x27;s unique style, based on an astounding technique, included a vast canon of bebop language. He was known to quote generously from classical, opera and other musical forms. A prodigious player, he was often subjected to &quot;cutting sessions&quot; (a musical battle between two musicians) involving a legion of tenor players, both in his hometown Chicago with Hank Mobley and Gene Ammons, and on the road. Diminutive, he was distinctive as a fashionable dresser, a good businessman, and a well-liked bandleader to other musicians.
Griffin was leader on his first Blue Note album &quot;Introducing Johnny Griffin&quot; in 1956. Also featuring Wynton Kelly on piano, Curly Russell on bass and Max Roach on drums, the recording brought Griffin critical acclaim.

The album &quot;A Blowin&#x27; Session&quot; (1957) featured John Coltrane and Hank Mobley. He played with Art Blakey&#x27;s Jazz Messengers for a few months in 1957 and in the Thelonious Monk Sextet and Quartet (1958). During this period, he recorded a set with Clark Terry on &quot;Serenade to a Bus Seat&quot;, featuring the rhythm trio of Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers, and Philly Joe Jones.

=== Move to Europe ===
Griffin moved to France in 1963 and to the Netherlands in 1978, where he settled in Bergambacht. His relocation was the result of several factors, including income tax problems, a failing marriage and feeling &quot;embittered by the critical acceptance of free jazz&quot; in the United States, as journalist Ben Ratliff wrote. Apart from appearing regularly under his own name at jazz clubs such as London&#x27;s Ronnie Scott&#x27;s, Griffin became a &quot;first choice&quot; sax player for visiting US musicians touring the continent during the 1960s and 1970s.

In 1965, he recorded albums with Wes Montgomery. He briefly rejoined Monk&#x27;s groups (an Octet and Nonet) in 1967. From 1967 to 1969, he was part of the Kenny Clarke/Francy Boland Big Band.

Griffin and Davis met up again in 1970 and recorded &quot;Tough Tenors Again &#x27;n&#x27; Again&quot;, and again with the Dizzy Gillespie Big 7 at the Montreux Jazz Festival. In the late 1970s, Griffin recorded with Peter Herbolzheimer and His Big Band, which also included, among others, Nat Adderley, Derek Watkins, Art Farmer, Slide Hampton, Jiggs Whigham, Herb Geller, Wilton Gaynair, Stan Getz, Gerry Mulligan, Rita Reys, Jean &quot;Toots&quot; Thielemans, Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen, Grady Tate, and Quincy Jones as arranger.

He also recorded with the Nat Adderley Quintet in 1978, having previously recorded with Adderley in 1958.

In 1978, Griffin and Dexter Gordon returned to the U.S., and the two performed at the Ann Arbor&#x27;s Eclipse Jazz Festival, before recording &quot;Live at Carnegie Hall&quot;.

Griffin&#x27;s last concert was in Hyères, France on July 21, 2008. On July 25, 2008, he died of a heart attack at the age of 80 in Mauprévoir, near Availles-Limouzine, France.

<text>Donald Jess Bachardy (born May 18, 1934) is an American portrait artist. He resides in Santa Monica, California. Bachardy was the partner of Christopher Isherwood for more than 30 years.

== Early life ==
Born in Los Angeles, California, Bachardy studied at the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles and the Slade School of Art in London. His first one-man exhibition was held in October 1961 at the Redfern Gallery in London. He met the writer Christopher Isherwood on Valentine&#x27;s Day 1953, when he was 18 and Isherwood was 48. They remained together until Isherwood&#x27;s death in 1986. A number of paperback editions of Isherwood&#x27;s novels feature Bachardy&#x27;s pencil portraits of the author. A film about their relationship, titled &quot;Chris &amp; Don: A Love Story&quot;, was released in 2008.

==Work==

Bachardy has had many one-man exhibitions in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Houston and New York City. More recently, he exhibited at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California, in 2004–2005.

His works reside in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum of Art in San Francisco, the University of Texas, Henry E. Huntington Library and Art Gallery, San Marino, California, the University of California, Los Angeles, the Fogg Art Museum of Harvard University, Princeton University, the Smithsonian Institution, and the National Portrait Gallery, London.

Six books of his work have been published. His life and works are also documented in Terry Sanders&#x27; film &quot;The Eyes of Don Bachardy&quot;. He collaborated with Isherwood on &quot;Frankenstein: The True Story&quot; (1973). His book &quot;Stars in My Eyes&quot; (2000), about celebrated people whom he had painted, became a number one best-seller in Los Angeles. Bachardy&#x27;s most haunting and eloquent published collection, &quot;Last Drawings of Christopher Isherwood&quot; in 1990 contains the dying and deceased Isherwood for the last time in his eyes.

One of Bachardy&#x27;s most notable works is the official gubernatorial portrait of Jerry Brown that hangs in the California State Capitol Museum.

Most recently, Bachardy made a cameo appearance in the movie &quot;A Single Man&quot; (starring Colin Firth) based on Isherwood&#x27;s book of the same name—he portrays a professor in the teacher&#x27;s lounge, to whom Firth says &quot;Hello. Don.&quot; Bachardy told &quot;Angeleno Magazine&quot; in their December 2009 issue: &quot;Chris got the idea for that book when he and I were having a domestic crisis. We&#x27;d been together 10 years. I was making a lot of trouble and wondering if I shouldn&#x27;t be on my own. Chris was going through a very difficult period (as well). So he killed off my character, Jim, in the book and imagined what his life would be like without me.&quot;

==Personal life==
Bachardy still lives in his and Isherwood&#x27;s Santa Monica home (his place of residence for over 50 years), where he paints portraits for gallery shows and on a commission basis. In January 2010 he showed a retrospective of self-portraits (from 1959–2009) at Craig Krull Gallery in Santa Monica. In Fall of 2011, Bachardy exhibited portraits made over the last 40 years depicting artists from Southern California, including Peter Alexander, Larry Bell, Billy Al Bengston, Robert Irwin, Ed Moses, and Ed Ruscha at Craig Krull Gallery in conjunction with the Getty initiative Pacific Standard Time. All 33 paintings were purchased by a New York collector on the board of the Whitney Museum.
