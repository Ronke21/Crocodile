<text>&quot;Innocence&quot; is episode 14 of season two of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. It was written and directed by Joss Whedon and first broadcast on The WB on January 20, 1998. It is part two of a two-part story. Part 1, &quot;Surprise,&quot; was broadcast the day before.

&quot;Innocence&quot; is one of the most critically acclaimed and highest rated episodes in the series, attracting 8.2 million viewers as the series moved from its Monday timeslot to Tuesday.

==Plot==
After making love with Buffy, Angel is racked with pain as his soul is ripped from him. In the street, he kills a passer-by when she offers to help him. He goes to the factory to join Spike and Drusilla, but the Judge attacks him. It is unable to burn him because Angel has fully reverted to the evil Angelus. Spike, Drusilla, and Angelus are clearly pleased to be reunited. Angelus vows to destroy Buffy for how she made him feel when he was Angel.

While researching a way to defeat the Judge, a demon with the power to destroy the world whom &quot;no weapon forged&quot; can harm, Xander and Cordelia are caught kissing in the library by a jealous Willow. Buffy finds Angel in his apartment, not knowing that he is now Angelus, and he blows her off, laughing at her as she weeps. Jenny is castigated by her uncle Enyos, who tells her that if Angel has one moment of true happiness, the curse placed on him will be broken and his new soul taken from him. Angelus terrorizes Willow and the Gang at school, emotionally tormenting Buffy. Later, as they discuss Angel&#x27;s transformation in the library, Buffy realises that having sex with Angel is what caused him to turn evil.

Buffy has a dream in which Angel indicates that Jenny knows more than she is letting on. The next morning, Buffy confronts Jenny, who tells her that Angelus was cursed with a soul in vengeance for what he did to her people, and that Enyos had tasked her with keeping Buffy and Angel apart. When Buffy, Jenny, and Giles arrive at Enyos&#x27; home, they find that Angelus has brutally killed him, leaving Buffy a message written in blood on the wall. Buffy begins to accept that she has to kill Angelus.

Xander, using memories from being a soldier on Halloween, hatches a plan to kill the Judge. He and Cordelia break into an army base and steal a shoulder-launched rocket. Oz declines Willow&#x27;s offer to make out, as he suspects that she only wants to make Xander jealous.

Tracking down the Judge, who is slaughtering people at a crowded mall, Buffy blows him to bits with the anti-tank weapon. Buffy stalks Angelus through the fleeing crowd and, when he ambushes her, they battle ferociously. Reaching a stand-off, Buffy is still unwilling to kill Angelus and settles for kicking him in the crotch.

Buffy blames herself for everything that has happened, but Giles reassures her that although she acted rashly, she and Angel loved each other and that Giles still supports and respects her. Later, Joyce lights the candle on Buffy&#x27;s birthday cake and tells her to make a wish, but Buffy decides to let it burn, while they watch the classic movie &quot;Stowaway&quot;.

==Themes==
Myles McNutt writes that the episode depicts &quot;a harsh reality which breaks down the show&#x27;s romantic depiction of love perhaps once and for all&quot;:

==Broadcast==
&quot;Innocence&quot; was the highest-rated episode ever for &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, scoring a 5.2 Nielsen rating and a 6.7 overnight rating, with each ratings point representing 980,000 households. It was watched by 8.2 million viewers.

==Reception==
The two-part story won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Makeup for a Series, one of only two Emmys the series would win.

In &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; list of the 25 best Whedonverse episodes including episodes from &quot;Buffy&quot;, as well as &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;Firefly&quot; and &quot;Dollhouse&quot; &quot;Innocence&quot; placed at No. 2, with the magazine saying, &quot;It&#x27;s as primal a metaphor for the terrors of sex as one could imagine, and it showed the audience, the cast, and Whedon himself just how high his little show about dusting vampires could climb.&quot; Joss Whedon listed &quot;Innocence&quot; as his favorite episode of the series; the interviewer wrote, &quot;Every girl&#x27;s nightmare, and one of the show&#x27;s most sly yet most powerful uses of metaphor... Though devastated, Buffy realizes that her mission is more important than her feelings.&quot;

&quot;Vox&quot; ranked it at #16 of all 144 episodes on their &quot;Every Episode Ranked From Worst to Best&quot; list (to mark the 20th anniversary of the show), writing, &quot;Up until this point, it’s been a smart, charming, and sharply written but also goofy and campy take on adolescence and its demons. After &quot;Innocence,&quot; it’s an immortal piece of television.&quot;

Reviewer Billie Doux writes that the two episodes &quot;together are outstanding, and mark a major turning point in the series,&quot; adding, &quot;David Boreanaz is much more impressive as Angelus than as Angel. I noticed mostly how he goes for a much lighter, more whimsical tone; good Angel is usually grim and haunted, but Angelus is playful, enthusiastic, and smiles all the time. Okay, smirks.&quot; Myles McNutt notes that &quot;what &#x27;Innocence&#x27; does so well is give us a clear indication of what the show will be like now that Angel has moved to the dark side. It doesn&#x27;t just turn Angel into Angelus without giving us a sense of how the character will act or what his dynamic will be with Spike and Drusilla; instead, David Boreanaz is given a great deal of time to flesh out just what Angel is like without a soul...&quot; He adds that it&#x27;s &quot;clever how the Judge was an unquestionably dominant threat but was not actually a dominant character: because it took him time to regain his power, it allowed for the wheelchair-bound Spike, the newly returned Angelus and Drusilla to remain the clear villains of the piece. The Judge remains simply a weapon at their disposal, which fit the episode quite nicely.&quot;

Screen Rant named it an episode including some of &quot;The Best 60 Seconds From All 7 Seasons.&quot; &quot;The best 60 seconds of the season occur when the Judge arrives at a shopping mall and starts killing people. Buffy turns up, and he announces that no weapon can kill him. Buffy replies, &quot;That was then, this is now,&quot; and pulls out the rocket launcher. The Judge asks what it does, and Buffy blows him into thousands of pieces.&quot;

<doc id="903452" wikidata="Q7587886" url="?curid=903452" title="St. Enda's School">
<text>St. Enda&#x27;s School () was an Irish language secondary established in 1908 by Irish nationalist Patrick Pearse. Originally Pearse&#x27;s school was established in 1908 at Cullenswood House, Ranelagh before moving to the Hermitage in Rathfarnham in 1910. After Pearse was executed for his part in the 1916 rising, and due to increasing financial worries, the school closed in 1935. Today the site is occupied by the Pearse Museum.

==Background==
Pearse, one of the leaders of the Easter Rising in 1916, had long been critical of the educational system in Ireland, which he believed taught Irish children to be good Englishmen. He had for years been committed to the preservation of the Irish language, mostly through the Gaelic League, and was dearly concerned about the language&#x27;s future. A trip abroad to Belgium and his observations of bilingual education there inspired him to attempt a similar experiment at home. Pearse also simply enjoyed educating boys, writing: &quot;&quot;To me a boy is the most interesting of all living things, and I have for years found myself coveting the privilege of being in a position to mould or help to mould, the lives of boys to noble ends&quot;.&quot;

Pearse was not a practical businessman, but did not let lack of finances get in the way of his plans. With promises from prominent nationalists that as proponents of Irish heritage they would provide whatever limited financial support they could, and, where applicable, enroll their children, Pearse officially opened his school on 8 September 1908, in Cullenswood House, Ranelagh, a suburb of Dublin.

The school proved a successful experiment, but was never to fully escape the shadow of looming financial woes. In fact, the school would not have survived the crucial first few years without the devoted aid of his good friend and assistant headmaster Thomas MacDonagh, and the solid dedication of Pearse&#x27;s brother Willie.

==Move to Rathfarnham==
St. Enda&#x27;s taught many of the classes in Irish, and particularly stressed the arts and dramatics. Everything was given an Irish approach. After two years the school was doing quite well. Thrilled with his creation, and concerned that Cullenswood House was not a location that did St. Enda&#x27;s justice, Pearse found what he believed to be the perfect home for the school. The Hermitage in Rathfarnham, substantially further from Dublin than Cullenswood House, caught his imagination and he decided that the school would have to move there. The substantial extra expenses involved did not deter him, nor was anything likely to, for the Hermitage, in addition to having a pastoral setting, had a connection with Robert Emmet, an Irish martyr and hero of Pearse&#x27;s. It was on these grounds that Emmet had courted Sarah Curran, who had lived nearby and whose father did not look kindly on young Emmet, forcing them to the grounds of the nearby Hermitage for their trysts.

In addition, the school&#x27;s namesake, St. Enda of Aran, had similarly left his life to teach a devoted group of students in the secluded Aran Islands, much as Pearse was now to do. In 1910 St. Enda&#x27;s opened its doors at the Hermitage.

The Hermitage, while perfect for Pearse&#x27;s idyllic image of what he hoped to achieve, proved to be a financial disaster. The extra distance made it less practical for the day school boys, forcing many of them to drop out rather than switch to boarding. In addition to this school, Pearse had decided to use Cullenswood House to establish a similar school for girls, St. Ita&#x27;s. With bankruptcy looming Pearse was forced to look to the United States for further funding. A lecture tour gave him some good contacts among the exiled Fenians who would prove to play a large part in Ireland&#x27;s near political future, but the money he raised only kept the school barely in solvency.

==Later years and closure==
Pearse&#x27;s involvement in the Irish Volunteers in 1913, and his active participation in the Irish Republican Brotherhood shortly thereafter, left St. Enda&#x27;s with a less devoted master than it had previously. Pearse&#x27;s radical politics also made even some moderate supporters question what their children might be exposed to, and some, notably Eoin MacNeill, removed their children from Pearse&#x27;s influence. As it turned out, a large number of St. Enda&#x27;s pupils did join the Fianna Éireann, and even the IRB, fifteen of whom later took part in the Easter Rising in 1916.

Following the execution of the Pearse brothers after the rising, their mother reopened St. Enda&#x27;s back at Cullenwood House, facilitated by the closure of St. Ita&#x27;s. Frank Burke, an ex-pupil who had served in the Rising, was headmaster. The school returned to the Hermitage in 1919. The international fame the rising had given Pearse and his martyrdom made raising funds easier than before, and the following year Margaret Pearse had raised enough to buy the property Pearse could never afford in his lifetime. However, without the leadership of either of the Pearse brothers, St. Enda&#x27;s could not last, and it eventually closed its doors for good in 1935.

==Pearse Museum==
Today the Hermitage stands as the Pearse Museum, dedicated to the memory of the school&#x27;s founders.

The museum contains several reconstructions of original rooms, including the study used by Patrick Pearse, the common sitting room, one of the dormitories, the school art gallery and the school museum. There is also a gallery solely devoted to William Pearse and his sculptures.

In the courtyard behind the school house, it is possible to visit a nature study room with examples of Irish plants and animals.

<doc id="903460" wikidata="Q7191204" url="?curid=903460" title="Picture superiority effect">
<text>The picture superiority effect refers to the phenomenon in which pictures and images are more likely to be remembered than words. This effect has been demonstrated in numerous experiments using different methods. It is based on the notion that &quot;human memory is extremely sensitive to the symbolic modality of presentation of event information.&quot; Explanations for the picture superiority effect are not concrete and are still being debated, however an evolutionary explanation is that sight has a long history stretching back millions of years and was crucial to survival in the past, whereas reading is a relatively recent invention, and requires specific cognitive processes, such as decoding symbols and linking them to meaning.

== History ==
Allan Paivio&#x27;s dual-coding theory is a basis of picture superiority effect. Paivio claims that pictures have advantages over words with regards to coding and retrieval of stored memory because pictures are coded more easily and can be retrieved from symbolic mode, while the dual coding process using words is more difficult for both coding and retrieval. Another explanation of the higher recall in picture superiority is the higher familiarity or frequency of pictured objects (Asch &amp; Ebenholtz, 1962). According to dual-coding theory (1971, 1986), memory exists either (or both) verbally or through imagery. Concrete concepts presented as pictures are encoded into both systems; however, abstract concepts are recorded only verbally. In psychology, the effect has implications for salience in attribution theory as well as the availability heuristic. It is also relevant to advertising and user interface design.

==Related theories==

===Paivio – Dual coding theory===

Picture stimuli have an advantage over word stimuli because they are dually encoded; they generate a verbal and image code, whereas word stimuli only generate a verbal code. Pictures are likely to generate a verbal label, whereas words are not likely to generate image labels.

===Nelson – Sensory semantic theory===

Pictures hold two encoding advantages over words. Pictures are perceptually more distinct from one another than words, thus increasing their chance for retrieval. In experiments when similarity among pictures was high, no picture superiority effect was present. Pictures are also believed to assess meaning more directly than words. Levels of processing theory apply when words and pictures are compared under semantic study instructions (rate the pleasantness of each item), recall is very similar for pictures and words, as both were encoded at deeper levels.

Picture superiority results from superior encoding for pictures over words, which facilitates greater recollection of pictures.

=== Weldon and Roediger-transfer appropriate processing theories ===
Greater overlap of processing at study and test result in increased performance. TAP accounts for picture superiority by an interaction of encoding and retrieval. If items are encoded during a semantic task, performance should be higher for a memory test that relies on concepts related to the items for retrieval than a test that relies on perceptual features.

==Evidence==

This effect has been shown to occur in recognition memory tasks, where items studied as pictures are better remembered than items studied as words, even when targets are presented as words during the test phase. Whether the picture superiority effect influences the familiarity and/or recollection processes, according to the dual-process models, thought to underlie recognition memory is not clear.

In experiments of associative recognition memory, participants studied random concrete word pairs, and line drawing pairs. They had to discriminate between intact and rearranged pairs at test. The picture superiority effect continued to express a strong effect with a greater hit rate for intact picture pairs. This further supports encoding theories More recent research in associative recognition shows support that semantic meaning of nameable pictures is activated faster than that of words, allowing for more meaningful associations between items depicted as pictures to be generated.

Pictures have distinctive features that enable to distinguish pictures from words and such discriminability increase memory ability in comparison with verbal cues (Jenkins, Neale &amp; Deno, 19 67). Picture Superiority effect was also evident for memory recall during semantic procession (Childers &amp; Houston, 1984). Moreover, pictures in pairs or group were better organized in our memory than words thus resulting in superiority in recall (Pavio &amp; Csapo, 1973). The picture superiority effect is also present in spatial memory, where locations of items and photographs were remembered better than locations of words.

== Critique ==
The advantage of pictures over words is only evident when visual similarity is a reliable cue; because it takes longer to understand pictures than words (Snodgrass &amp; McCullough, 1986). Pictures are only superior to words for list learning because differentiation is easier for pictures (Dominowski &amp; Gadlin, 1968). In reverse picture superiority it was observed that learning was much slower when the responses were pictures (Postman, 1978). Words produced a faster response than pictures and pictures did not have an advantages of having easier access to semantic memory or superior effect over words for dual-coding theory (Amrhein, McDaniel &amp; Waddill 2002). Similarly, studies where response time deadlines have been implemented, the reverse superiority effect was reported. This is related to the dual-process model of familiarity and recollection. When deadlines for the response were short, the process of familiarity was present, along with an increased tendency to recall words over pictures. When response deadlines were longer, the process of recollection was being utilized, and a strong picture superiority effect was present. In addition, equivalent response time was reported for pictures and words for intelligence comparison (Paivio &amp; Marschark, 1980). Contrary to the assumption that pictures have faster access to the same semantic code than words do; all semantic information is stored in a single system. The only difference is that pictures and words access different features of the semantic code (te Linde, 1982).

==With age==

Across the lifespan, a gradual development of the picture superiority effect is evident. Some studies have shown that it appears to become more pronounced with age, while others have found that this effect is also observed among younger children (Whitehouse, Mayber, Durkin, 2006). However, the major contribution in picture superiority in recognition memory among children was familiarity (Defeyter, Russo &amp; McPartlin, 2009). During childhood, specifically among seven-year-olds, the picture superiority effect is lesser in magnitude than in other age groups. This could be due to the lack of inner speech among younger children supporting the dual coding theory of Paivio. In healthy older adults, the picture superiority effect was found to be greater than it was for younger adults, in comparison to recognition for words, which was disadvantaged for older adults. In that regard, seniors can benefit from using pictorial information to retain textual information (Cherry et al., 2008). While memory for words is impaired for older adults, pictures help restore their impaired memory and function properly (Ally et al., 2008). In addition, older adults have shown the same level of capability for identifying correct items in comparison with young adults when items were accompanied with pictures (Smith, Hunt &amp; Dunlap, 2015). In populations with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and other mild cognitive impairments, the picture superiority effect remains evident. ERP activity indicates that patients with amnesic mild cognitive impairment utilized frontal-lobe based memory processes to support successful recognition for pictures, which was similar to healthy controls, but not for words.

== Applications ==

* Education (language learning): Learners can structure a mental model when processing a picture initially so that no further model construction may be required for subsequent processing of a text. Presenting picture before text is beneficial to students with low prior knowledge (Eitel &amp; Scheiter, 2015). In a similar vein, reading a picture prior to processing textual information improves comprehension levels for students with low prior knowledge (Salmerón, Baccino, Cañas, Madrid, &amp; Fajardo, 2009). Pictures can be more effective than word translation for language learning when individuals are not overconfident in the mnemonic power of pictures (Carpenter &amp; Olson, 2011). If they are overconfident, pictures lose superiority over words.
* Health communication: A study by Ally, Gold and Budson (2009) confirm that picture superiority effect was observed among mild Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD) and amnestic-type mild cognitive impairment (MC). Pictures have a significantly positive effect on four areas of communication: attention, comprehension, recall, and intention/adherence. Health education materials can benefit greatly by adding pictures as pictures can be especially beneficial for people who lack literacy skill (Houts, C.Doak, L.Doak &amp;Loscalzo, 2006). Picture superiority effect can be implemented in creating materials for health communication that inclusion of fearful or disgusting images led to improved recognition memory in comparison with the condition without a presence of image (Leshner, Vultee, Bolls &amp; Moore, 2010).
*Advertising: Percy and Rossiter (1997, p. 295) stated, &quot;The picture is the most important structural element in magazine advertising, for both consumer and business audiences.&quot; Visually framed messages were more effective under the condition where the audience was less motivated and had less ability to process information semantically. Visual ads require less exposure than verbal ads for long-term memory effect (Childers &amp; Houston, 1984). The pictorial component in the ad is more likely to be viewed before words, and it generates an expectation for the verbal component of the ad (Houston, Childers &amp; Heckler, 1987). Maximizing the size of pictures regardless of advertising contents will improve attention to the entire advertisement as pictures draw significant attention to baseline in the ads (Pieters &amp; Wedel, 2004).

== Proposed model ==

== Direction for future studies ==

<doc id="903480" wikidata="Q2711415" url="?curid=903480" title="North American XB-21">
<text>The North American XB-21 (manufacturer&#x27;s model designation NA-21) and sometimes referred to by the name &quot;Dragon&quot;, was a prototype bomber aircraft developed by North American Aviation in the late 1930s, for evaluation by the United States Army Air Corps. Evaluated against the Douglas B-18 Bolo, it was found to be considerably more expensive than the rival aircraft, and despite the ordering of a small number of evaluation aircraft, only the prototype was ever built.

==Design and development==
North American Aviation&#x27;s first twin-engined military aircraft, the NA-21 prototype was constructed at North American&#x27;s factory in Inglewood, California, where work on the aircraft began in early 1936. The NA-21 was a mid-wing monoplane of all-metal construction, powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2180-A Twin Hornet radial engines, which were fitted with turbosuperchargers for increased high-altitude performance.

Flown by a crew of six to eight men, the XB-21 featured a remarkably strong defensive armament for the time, including as many as five .30-calibre M1919 machine guns. These were planned to be fitted in hydraulically powered nose and dorsal turrets, in addition to manually operated weapons installed in waist and ventral positions. Up to of bombs could be carried in an internal bomb bay, with of bombs being able to be carried over a range of .

==Testing and evaluation==
Undertaking its maiden flight on 22 December 1936 at Mines Field in Los Angeles, test flights indicated a number of minor problems. Modifications resolving these resulted in the aircraft being re-designated NA-39, and, accepted by the US Army Air Corps as the XB-21. The aircraft, which had been assigned the serial number &quot;38-485&quot;, was evaluated early the following year in competition against a similar design by Douglas Aircraft, an improved version of the company&#x27;s successful B-18 Bolo.

During the course of flight testing, the gun turrets proved troublesome, their drive motors proving to be underpowered, and issues with wind blast through the gun slots were also encountered. As a result of these problems, the XB-21&#x27;s nose turret was faired over, while the dorsal turret was removed.

The XB-21 proved to have superior performance over its competitor, but price became the primary factor distinguishing the Bolo and the XB-21. On this account, the modified B-18 was declared the winner of the competition, Douglas quoting a price per aircraft of US$64,000, while North American&#x27;s estimate was US$122,000 per aircraft, and an order was placed for 177 of the Douglas aircraft, to be designated B-18A.

Despite this, the US Army Air Corps found the performance of the XB-21 to have been favorable enough to order five pre-production aircraft, to be designated YB-21. However, soon after this contract was awarded, it was cancelled, and none of the YB-21s were ever built, leaving the XB-21 as the sole example of the type ever constructed. Operated by North American Aviation, the XB-21 served as a research aircraft until its retirement.

Although the XB-21 failed to win a production contract, it was the first of a long line of North American Aviation medium bomber aircraft, and provided experience and knowledge that assisted in the development of the North American NA-40, which, developed into the B-25 Mitchell, would become one of the Army&#x27;s standard medium bombers of World War II.

<doc id="903481" wikidata="Q1422241" url="?curid=903481" title="Von Restorff effect">
<text>The Von Restorff effect, also known as the &quot;isolation effect&quot;, predicts that when multiple homogeneous stimuli are presented, the stimulus that differs from the rest is more likely to be remembered. The theory was coined by German psychiatrist and pediatrician Hedwig von Restorff (1906–1962), who, in her 1933 study, found that when participants were presented with a list of categorically similar items with one distinctive, isolated item on the list, memory for the item was improved.

The study utilized the &quot;isolation paradigm&quot;, which refers to a distinctive feature of an item in a list that differs from the others by way of dimension. Such distinctiveness, leading to the von Restorff effect, can be generated from changing the meaningfulness or physical nature of the stimulus in some way, such as in size, shape, color, spacing and underlining.

== Examples ==
For example, if a person examines a shopping list with one item highlighted in bright green, they will be more likely to remember the highlighted item than any of the others. Additionally, in the following list of words – desk, chair, bed, table, chipmunk, dresser, stool, couch – &quot;chipmunk&quot; will be remembered the most as it stands out against the other words in its meaning (an animal, while the others are words for furniture).

== Explanation ==
There are different theories proposed to explain the increased performance of isolated items. The total-time hypothesis suggests that isolated items are rehearsed for a longer time in working memory compared to non-isolated items. Another approach offers that subjects could consider the isolated items to be in their own special category in a free-recall task, making them easier to recollect. A separate explanation is based upon the analysis of the deep processing of similarities and differences among the items. Debate surrounds whether perceptual salience and differential attention are necessary to produce this effect. Modern theory holds that the contextual incongruity of the isolate is what leads to the differential attention to this item. Based on this assumption, an isolation effect would not be expected if the isolated item were presented prior to some consistent context, a theory that goes against von Restorff&#x27;s findings.

Empirical data has shown a strong relationship between the von Restorff effect and measures of event-related potential in the brain. Specifically, evidence has shown that exposure to novel or isolated items on a list for free recall generates an ERP with a larger amplitude and this amplitude in turn predicts a higher likelihood of future recall and faster recognition of the items.

==Age==
There have been many studies that demonstrate and confirm the von Restorff effect in children and young adults. Another study found that college-aged students performed better when trying to remember an outstanding item in a list during an immediate memory-task whereas elderly individuals did not remember it well, suggesting a difference in processing strategies between the age groups.

In yet another study, although a significant von Restorff effect was produced amongst both age groups when manipulating font color, it was found to be smaller in older adults than younger adults. This too indicates that older people display lesser benefits for distinctive information compared to younger people.

<doc id="903485" wikidata="Q460282" url="?curid=903485" title="Amchitka">
<text>Amchitka (; ;) is a volcanic, tectonically unstable and uninhabited 
island in the Rat Islands group of the Aleutian Islands in southwest Alaska. It is part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. The island, with a land area of roughly , is about long and wide. The area has a maritime climate, with many storms, and mostly overcast skies.

Amchitka was populated for more than 2,500 years by the Aleut people, but has had no permanent population since 1832. The island has been part of the United States since the Alaska Purchase of 1867. During World War II, it was used as an airfield by US forces in the Aleutian Islands Campaign.

Amchitka was selected by the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to be the site for underground detonations of nuclear weapons. Three such tests were carried out: &quot;Long Shot&quot;, an blast in 1965; &quot;Milrow&quot;, a blast in 1969; and &quot;Cannikin&quot; in 1971 – at , the largest underground test ever conducted by the United States. The tests were highly controversial, with environmental groups fearing that the &quot;Cannikin&quot; explosion, in particular, would cause severe earthquakes and tsunamis. Amchitka is no longer used for nuclear testing. It is still monitored for the leakage of radioactive materials.

==Geography==

Amchitka is the southernmost of the Rat Islands group in the Aleutian Chain, located between and . It is bounded by the Bering Sea to the north and east, and the Pacific Ocean to the south and west.

The eastern part of the island is a lowland plateau, with isolated ponds and gently rolling hills. There is low but abundant vegetation, consisting of mosses, lichens, liverworts, ferns, grasses, sedges, and crowberry. The center of the island is mountainous, and the western end is barren and vegetation is sparse.

Amchitka has a maritime climate, often foggy and windswept, with cloud cover 98 percent of the time. While temperatures are moderated by the ocean, storms are frequent. Geologically, the island is volcanic, being a part of a small crustal block on the Aleutian Arc that is being torn apart by oblique subduction. It is &quot;one of the least stable tectonic environments in the United States.&quot;


==Early history==
The human history of Amchitka dates back at least 2,500 years, with the Aleut people. Human remains, thought to be of an Aleut dating from about 1000 AD, were discovered in 1980.

Amchitka is said to have been seen and named St. Makarius by Vitus Bering in 1741, was sighted by Joseph Billings in 1790, and visited by Shishmaref in 1820.

In 1783, Daikokuya Kōdayū and 15 Japanese castaways landed on Amchitka after drifting for seven months. The castaways were taken care of by Russian employees of Zhigarev and hunted with indigenous people. Six of the castaways died in three years.

==World War II and after==
In June 1942, the Japanese occupied some of the western Aleutian islands, and hoped to occupy Amchitka. Eager to remove the Japanese, the Joint Chiefs of Staff agreed to move quickly to regain the territory. American planners decided to build a series of airfields to the west of Umnak, from which bombers could attack the invading forces.

The United States Army established bases at Adak and 13 other locations. At the War Department&#x27;s suggestion, an initial reconnaissance of Amchitka was carried out in September 1942, finding that it would be difficult to build an airstrip on the island. Nevertheless, planners decided on December 13 that the airfield &quot;had to be built&quot; to prevent the Japanese from doing the same. A further reconnaissance mission visited Amchitka from 17 to 19 December, and reported that a fighter strip could be built in two to three weeks, and a main airfield in three to four months. The plan was approved and began in 1942.

American forces made an unopposed landing on Amchitka on January 12, 1943. Despite facing difficult weather conditions and bombing from the Japanese, they made the airfield usable by February 16. The Alaska Command was now away from their target, Kiska. The military eventually built numerous buildings, roads, and a total of three airstrips on the island, one of which would later be rebuilt and used by the Atomic Energy Commission in the late 1960s. At its peak, the occupancy of Amchitka reached 15,000 troops.

The Aleutian Islands campaign was successfully completed on August 24, 1943. In that month, a strategic intercept station was established on the island, remaining until February 1945. On 31 December 1949 the Air Force base was closed due to insufficient personnel and staff. The Army closed its communications facility at Amchitka in August 1950. On 31 December 1950 the Air Force 2107th Air Weather Group withdrew the last of its personnel from Amchitka and the facility was abandoned.

The site later hosted an Air Force White Alice Communications System from 1959 to 1961, and a temporary relay station in the 1960s and 1970s. A prototype Relocatable Over-the-Horizon Radar system existed on Amchitka between 1991 and 1993 to conduct surveillance on Russia.

==Demographics==
Amchitka first appeared as a census-designated place (CDP) on the 1990 U.S. Census with a population of 25. This was the only time it appeared on the census, and the CDP was abolished in 2000.

==Nuclear testing==

===Plans for nuclear testing===
With the pullout of military forces from Amchitka in 1950, the Department of Defense (DoD) initially considered the island for nuclear testing planned for 1951, under &quot;Operation Windstorm.&quot; Requiring information about the cratering potential of nuclear weapons, plans were made to detonate two devices. After approximately 34 test holes had been drilled, the site was deemed unsuitable, and the project was moved to the Nevada test site.

In the late 1950s, scientists realized that improved seismological knowledge was necessary for the detection of Soviet underground nuclear explosions. The &quot;Rainier&quot; test (part of Operation Plumbbob, performed in Nevada) produced strong seismic signals, but looked much like an ordinary earthquake. In 1959, Dr. James R. Killian, the Special Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, formed the Panel on Seismic Improvement (which subsequently recommended the program that came to be known as Vela Uniform), with the twin goals of improving seismic instruments and deploying them globally, and researching in more depth the seismic effects of nuclear explosions. The project was subsequently initiated by the Eisenhower administration.

Together with the Atomic Energy Commission, the DoD began assessing Amchitka for atmospheric tests of very high-yield thermonuclear weapon effects as part of the &quot;Vela Uniform&quot; nuclear test program, under Project Rufus, and later, Project Larkspur, using a pre-existing Vela Uniform program for underground testing as a cover. The Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963 ended investigation of Amchitka as a site for atmospheric testing, but work continued on underground test preparations.

===Long Shot test===

To conduct the Vela Uniform test &quot;Long Shot&quot;, the Department of Defense occupied Amchitka from 1964 to 1966, with the AEC providing the device, measuring instruments, and scientific support. The goal was &quot;to determine the behavior and characteristics of seismic signals generated by nuclear detonations and to differentiate them from seismic signals generated by naturally occurring earthquakes.&quot;

Although it would not be publicly announced until March 18, 1965, senior Alaskan officials were notified the previous February. After the devastating Great Alaska earthquake of March 27, 1964, the governor expressed concern about the psychological effects of the test on the populace. He was quickly reassured.

&quot;Long Shot&quot; was detonated on October 29, 1965, and the yield was . It was the first underground test in a remote area, and the first test managed by the DoD. While there was no surface collapse,tritium and krypton were found at the surface following the test; this was not made public until 1969.

===Milrow and Cannikin tests===

Though performed as part of the Nuclear Weapons Testing Program, &quot;[the] purpose of the &quot;Milrow&quot; test was to test an island, not a weapon.&quot; It was a &quot;calibration shot&quot;, intended to produce data from which the impact of larger explosions could be predicted, and specifically, to determine whether the planned &quot;Cannikin&quot; detonation could be performed safely. &quot;Milrow&quot; was detonated on October 2, 1969 , with an approximate yield of .

The shockwave reached the surface with an acceleration of over 35 g (340 m/s2), causing a dome of the Earth&#x27;s surface, approximately in radius, to rise about . The blast &quot;turned the surrounding sea to froth&quot; and &quot;forced geysers of mud and water from local streams and lakes into the air&quot;. A &quot;surface collapse feature&quot;, also known as a subsidence crater, was formed by material collapsing into the cavity formed by the explosion.

&quot;Cannikin&quot; was intended to test the design of the Spartan anti-ballistic missile (ABM) interceptor – a high-yield warhead that &quot;produced copious amounts of x-rays and minimized fission output and debris to prevent blackout of ABM radar systems.&quot; The test would &quot;measure the yield of the device, measure the x-ray flux and spectrum, and assure deployment of a reliable design.&quot;

====Controversy====
A few days after the &quot;Milrow&quot; test, the Don&#x27;t Make A Wave Committee was organized at a meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The committee&#x27;s name referred to predictions made by a Vancouver journalist named Bob Hunter, later to become a member of Greenpeace. He wrote that the test would cause earthquakes and a tsunami. On the agenda was whether to fight another blast at the island, or whether to expand their efforts to fight all perceived threats against the environment. As he was leaving, one man gave the traditional farewell of the peace-activist movement &quot;Peace&quot; – to which another member replied &quot;Make it a green peace&quot;. The committee would later become Greenpeace.

The AEC considered the likelihood of the test triggering a severe earthquake &quot;very unlikely&quot;, unless one was already imminent on a nearby fault, and considered a tsunami &quot;even more unlikely&quot;. Others disagreed. Russell Train, then Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, argued that &quot;experience with &quot;Milrow&quot; ... does not provide a sure basis for extrapolation. In the highly nonlinear phenomena involved in earthquake generation, there may be a threshold value of the strain that must be exceeded prior to initiation of a large earthquake. ... The underground explosion could serve as the first domino of the row of dominoes leading to a major earthquake. ... as in the case of earthquakes it is not possible at this time to assess quantitatively the probability of a tsunami following the explosion.&quot;

In July 1971, a group called the &quot;Committee for Nuclear Responsibility&quot; filed suit against the AEC, asking the court to stop the test. The suit was unsuccessful, with the Supreme Court denying the injunction by 4 votes to 3, and Richard Nixon personally authorized the $200 million test, in spite of objections from Japan, Peru, and Sweden. The &quot;Don&#x27;t Make A Wave Committee&quot; chartered a boat, in which they had intended to sail to the island in protest, but due to postponement of the test and interference from the U.S. Coast Guard, they were unable to observe the test.

====Cannikin tested====
&quot;Cannikin&quot; was detonated on November 6, 1971 , as the thirteenth test of the Operation Grommet (1971–1972) underground nuclear test series. The announced yield was 5 megatons (21 PJ) – the largest underground nuclear test in U.S. history. (Estimates for the precise yield range from 4.4 to 5.2 megatons or 18 to 22 PJ). The ground lifted , caused by an explosive force almost 400 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb. Subsidence and faulting at the site created a new lake, several hundred meters wide. The explosion caused a seismic shock of 7.0 on the Richter scale, causing rockfalls and turf slides of a total of . Though earthquakes and tsunamis predicted by environmentalists did not occur, a number of small tectonic events did occur in the following weeks, (some registering as high as 4.0 on the richter scale) thought to be due to the interaction of the explosion with local tectonic stresses.

===1973 and beyond===
The AEC withdrew from the island in 1973, though scientists continue to visit the island for monitoring purposes. In 2001, the DoE returned to the site to remove environmental contamination. Drilling mud pits were stabilized by mixing with clean soil, covering with a polyester membrane, topped with soil and re-seeded.

Concerns have been expressed that new fissures may be opening underground, allowing radioactive materials to leak into the ocean. A 1996 Greenpeace study found that &quot;Cannikin&quot; was leaking both plutonium and americium into the environment. In 2004, scientific divers from the University of Alaska Fairbanks collected shallow subtidal organisms and reported that &quot;There were no indications of any radioactive leakage, and all that was really wonderful news.&quot; Similar findings are reported by a 2006 study, which found that levels of plutonium &quot;were very small and not significant biologically&quot;.

The Department of Energy continues to monitor the site as part of their remediation program. This is expected to continue until 2025, after which the site is intended to become a restricted access wildlife preserve.

<doc id="903489" wikidata="Q17154669" url="?curid=903489" title="Vulnerable plaque">
<text>A vulnerable plaque is a kind of atheromatous plaque – a collection of white blood cells (primarily macrophages) and lipids (including cholesterol) in the wall of an artery – that is particularly unstable and prone to produce sudden major problems such as a heart attack or stroke.

The defining characteristics of a vulnerable plaque include but are not limited to: a thin fibrous cap, large lipid-rich necrotic core, increased plaque inflammation, positive vascular remodeling, increased vasa-vasorum neovascularization, and intra-plaque hemorrhage. These characteristics together with the usual hemodynamic pulsating expansion during systole and elastic recoil contraction during diastole contribute to a high mechanical stress zone on the fibrous cap of the atheroma, making it prone to rupture. Increased hemodynamic stress, e.g. increased blood pressure, especially pulse pressure (systolic blood pressure vs. diastolic blood pressure difference), correlates with increased rates of major cardiovascular events associated with exercise, especially exercise beyond levels the individual does routinely.

Generally an atheroma becomes vulnerable if it grows more rapidly and has a thin cover separating it from the bloodstream inside the arterial lumen. Tearing of the cover is called &quot;plaque rupture&quot;. However, a repeated atheroma rupture and healing is one of the mechanisms, perhaps the dominant one, that creates artery stenosis.

==Formation==
Researchers have found that accumulation of white blood cells, especially macrophages, termed inflammation, in the walls of the arteries leads to the development of &quot;soft&quot; or vulnerable plaque, which when released aggressively promotes blood clotting.

Current research and thinking relating to the formation of vulnerable plaques (see atherosclerosis) is:
* Hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking, homocysteine, hemodynamic factors, toxins, viruses, and/or immune reactions results in chronic endothelial injury, dysfunction, and increased permeability.
* Lipoprotein LDL particles, which carry fats (including the fat cholesterol made by every human cell) within the water/plasma portion of the blood stream, are absorbed into the intima, past the endothelium lining, some of the LDL-lipoprotein particles become oxidized and this attracts macrophages that uptake the particles. This process typically starts in childhood. To be specific: oxidized lipoprotein particles in the artery wall are an irritant which causes the release of proteins (called cytokines) which attract monocyte white blood cells (white blood cells are the inflammatory cells within the body).
* The cytokines induce the endothelial cells lining the artery wall to display adhesion molecules that attract immune-system white blood cells (to be specific, monocytes).
* The monocytes squeeze into the artery wall. Once inside, they transform into macrophages which will ingest the oxidized lipoprotein particles.
* The macrophages sometimes become so overloaded with oxidized lipoprotein particles, the cholesterol contained therein and membrane-laden that they are called foam cells. Some of these cells die in place, releasing their fat and cholesterol-laden membranes into the intercellular space. This attracts more macrophages and smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation.
* Smooth muscle cells migrate from the media to the intima, proliferate, and develop an extracellular matrix made up of collagen and proteoglycans.
* In some regions of increased macrophage activity, macrophage-induced-enzymes erode away the fibrous membrane beneath the endothelium so that the cover separating the plaque from blood flow in the lumen becomes thin and fragile.
* Mechanical stretching and contraction of the artery, with each heart beat, i.e. the pulse, results in rupture of the thin covering membrane, spewing clot-promoting plaque contents into the blood stream.
* The clotting system reacts and forms clots both on the particles shed into the blood stream and locally over the rupture. The clot, if large enough, can block all blood flow. Since all the blood, within seconds, passes through 5-micrometre capillaries, any particles much larger than 5 micrometres block blood flow. (most of the occlusions are too small to see by angiography).
* Most ruptures and clotting events are too small to produce symptoms, though they still produce heart muscle damage, a slow progressive process resulting in ischemic heart disease, the most common basis for congestive heart failure.
* The clot organizes and contracts over time, leaving behind narrowing(s) called stenoses. These narrowing(s) are responsible for the symptoms of the disease and are identified, after the fact, by the changes seen on stress tests and angiography, and treated with bypass surgery and/or angioplasty, with or without stents.

When this inflammation is combined with other stresses, such as high blood pressure (increased mechanical stretching and contraction of the arteries with each heart beat), it can cause the thin covering over the plaque to split, spilling the contents of the vulnerable plaque into the bloodstream. Recent studies have shown cholesterol crystals within the plaque play a key role in splitting the plaque and also inducing inflammation. The sticky cytokines on the artery wall capture blood cells (mainly platelets) that accumulate at the site of injury. When these cells clump together, they form a thrombus, sometimes large enough to block the artery.

The most frequent cause of a cardiac event following rupture of a vulnerable plaque is blood clotting on top of the site of the ruptured plaque that blocks the lumen of the artery, thereby stopping blood flow to the tissues the artery supplies.

Upon rupture, atheroma tissue debris may spill into the blood stream; this debris has cholesterol crystals and other material which is often too large (over 5 micrometers) to pass on through the capillaries downstream. In this, the usual situation, the debris obstruct smaller downstream branches of the artery resulting in temporary to permanent end artery/capillary closure with loss of blood supply to, and death of, the previously supplied tissues. A severe case of this can be seen during angioplasty in the slow clearance of injected contrast down the artery lumen. This situation is often termed non-reflow.

In addition, atheroma rupture may allow bleeding from the lumen into the inner tissue of the atheroma, making the atheroma size suddenly increase and protrude into the lumen of the artery, producing lumen narrowing or even total obstruction.

==Detection==
While a single ruptured plaque can be identified during autopsy as the cause of a coronary event, there is currently no way to identify a culprit lesion before it ruptures.

Because artery walls typically enlarge in response to enlarging plaques, these plaques do not usually produce much stenosis of the artery lumen. Therefore, they are not detected by cardiac stress tests or angiography, the tests most commonly performed clinically with the goal of predicting susceptibility to future heart attack. In contrast to conventional angiography, cardiac CT angiography does enable visualization of the vessel wall as well as plaque composition. Some of the CT derived plaque characteristics can help predict for acute coronary syndrome. In addition, because these lesions do not produce significant stenoses, they are typically not considered &quot;critical&quot; and/or interventionable by interventional cardiologists, even though research indicates that they are the more important lesions for producing heart attacks.

The tests most commonly performed clinically with the goal of testing susceptibility to future heart attack include several medical research efforts, starting in the early to mid-1990s, using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), thermography, near-infrared spectroscopy, careful clinical follow-up, and other methods, to predict these lesions and the individuals most prone to future heart attacks. These efforts remain largely research with no useful clinical methods to date (2006). Furthermore, the usefulness of detecting individual vulnerable plaques by invasive methods has been questioned because many &quot;vulnerable&quot; plaques rupture without any associated symptoms and it remains unclear if the risk of invasive detection methods is outweighed by clinical benefit.

Another approach to detecting and understanding plaque behavior, used in research and by a few clinicians, is to use ultrasound to non-invasively measure wall thickness (usually abbreviated IMT) in portions of larger arteries closest to the skin, such as the carotid or femoral arteries. While stability vs. vulnerability cannot be readily distinguished in this way, quantitative baseline measurements of the thickest portions of the arterial wall (locations with the most plaque accumulation). Documenting the IMT, location of each measurement and plaque size, a basis for tracking and partially verifying the effects of medical treatments on the progression, stability, or potential regression of plaque, within a given individual over time, may be achieved.

== Vulnerable plaque vs stable plaque ==
The factors involved to promote either a vulnerable plaque or a stable plaque are not clear yet, however, the major differences between a vulnerable and stable plaque are that vulnerable plaques have a &quot;rich-lipid core&quot; and a &quot;thin fibrous cap&quot; in comparison with the &quot;thick fibrous cap&quot; and the &quot;poor lipid plaque&quot; present in the stable plaque. In case of a vulnerable plaque, this results in a larger diameter of the Artery Lumen, which means that patient&#x27;s life style is not affected, however, when the thin fibrous cap breaks, this causes a prompt activation of platelets which causes the occlusion of the artery, which causes a sudden heart attack if it occurs in the coronary artery.

Concerning stable plaques, the thick fibrous cap avoids the breaking risks, however, it reduces significantly the artery diameter which causes the cardiovascular problems related to the decreasing of vessel&#x27;s diameter (this is determined by the Hagen–Poiseuille equation which explains how flow-rate is related to the radius of the vessel to the fourth power).

==Prevention==
Patients can lower their risk for vulnerable plaque rupture in the same ways that they can cut their heart attack risk: Optimize lipoprotein patterns, keep blood glucose levels low normal (see HbA1c), stay slender, eat a proper diet, quit smoking, and maintain a regular exercise program. Researchers also think that obesity and diabetes may be tied to high levels of C-reactive protein.

<text>The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, also known as &quot;the Trib&quot;, is the second-largest daily newspaper serving the Greater Pittsburgh metropolitan area of Western Pennsylvania. It transitioned to an all-digital format on December 1, 2016, but remains the second-largest daily in Pennsylvania, with nearly one million unique page views monthly. Founded on August 22, 1811, as the Greensburg Gazette and consolidated with several papers into the Greensburg Tribune-Review in 1889, the paper circulated only in the eastern suburban counties of Westmoreland and parts of Indiana and Fayette until May 1992, when it began serving all of the Greater Pittsburgh metropolitan area after a strike at the two Pittsburgh dailies, the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; and &quot;The Pittsburgh Press&quot;, deprived the city of a newspaper for several months.

The Tribune-Review Publishing Company was owned by Richard Mellon Scaife, an heir to the Mellon banking, oil, and aluminum fortune, until his death in July 2014. Scaife was a major funder of conservative organizations, including the Arkansas Project. Accordingly, the &quot;Tribune-Review&quot; has maintained a conservative editorial stance, contrasting with the then-more liberal &quot;Post-Gazette&quot; before that paper&#x27;s own editorial shift in 2018 and was known for spreading false rumors. In addition to its flagship paper, the company publishes 17 weekly community newspapers, the &quot;Pittsburgh Pennysaver&quot;, TribLive.com, and TribTotalMedia.com.

== History ==
===19th century===

The paper began as the &quot;Gazette&quot; on August 22, 1811. After a series of name changes and mergers it became the &quot;Greensburg Daily Tribune&quot; in 1889.

===20th century===
In 1924, it and the &quot;Greensburg Morning Review&quot;, launched by David J. Berry in 1903, consolidated their interests under a single ownership. Both papers continued separate publication until 1955, when they merged to form the &quot;Greensburg Tribune-Review&quot;.

Scaife acquired the &quot;Tribune-Review&quot; in 1970, a decades after trying to acquire the &quot;Post-Gazette&quot;. From 1981 to 1982, he managed a short-lived eastern suburban newspaper, &quot;The Daily-Sunday Tribune&quot;.

====Kent State and the Pulitzer==== 
The Tribune-Review owns several satellite papers that insert or surround the regional publication with neighborhood-specific stories. The &quot;Valley News Dispatch&quot;, of Pittsburgh suburbs Tarentum and New Kensington is one such satellite. Local journalism student John Filo worked for the publication while attending nearby Kent State University and served as the &quot;Valley News Dispatch&quot;″s correspondent of the Kent State shootings. His photography that day has ascended to iconic status and won the newspaper its only Pulitzer Prize.

During a newspaper strike that temporarily shut down the &quot;Post-Gazette&quot; and ultimately closed the &quot;Pittsburgh Press&quot;, Scaife launched the &quot;Pittsburgh Tribune-Review&quot;, an edition of the Greensburg-based &quot;Tribune-Review&quot; covering Allegheny County and Pittsburgh. Over time, it became a stand-alone newspaper headquartered on Pittsburgh&#x27;s North Side. In 1997, Scaife added to his small collection of newspapers by purchasing &quot;The Daily Courier&quot; of Connellsville, the &quot;Leader Times&quot; of Kittanning and &quot;The Valley Independent&quot; of Monessen from Thomson Newspapers.

In late 1997, Scaife&#x27;s NewsWorks facility opened in the North Hills. In December 1997, the Tribune-Review company purchased the &quot;North Hills News Record&quot;, even though four months earlier, then-Trib president Ed Harrell told the &quot;Pittsburgh Business Times&quot; that the company was not interested in the &quot;News Record&quot;. Nine months after purchasing the &quot;North Hills News Record&quot; from Gannett Company, Tribune-Review Publishing Co. announced the paper would be merged with the &quot;Pittsburgh Trib&quot;. &quot;The News Record&quot; was most successful during the newspaper strike of the early 1990s.

At its demise, the &quot;North Hills News Record&quot; had a daily circulation of more than 16,000, nearly 1,000 less than its circulation before the Trib bought it. In early 2000, the Trib announced the &quot;News Record&quot; name would retire after more than two years of a combined &quot;Tribune-Review/North Hills News Record&quot; banner. North Hills coverage would be wrapped into the Trib&#x27;s neighborhoods section.

===21st century===
In 2000, the Trib announced it would convert its Irwin-based paper, the daily (except Sunday) &quot;Standard Observer&quot;, into a twice-weekly regional section of the Greensburg &quot;Tribune-Review&quot;. Citing a &quot;sagging economy&quot;, the Trib laid off more than four percent of its workforce in 2003, including freelance writers. More shakeups continued in 2005 as circulation numbers dropped and a top official left. An online message board featured back and forth fights between Pittsburgh and Greensburg employees.

Edward Harrell, then-president of the Tribune-Review Publishing Company, announced in January 2005 that most of the regional editions of the paper would have their newsroom, management, and circulation departments merged, and staff reductions would follow. The merged papers include the &quot;Tribune-Review&quot; of Greensburg, the &quot;Valley News Dispatch&quot; of Tarentum, &quot;The Leader-Times&quot; of Kittanning, &quot;The Daily Courier&quot; of Connellsville and the &quot;Blairsville Dispatch&quot;. &quot;The Valley Independent&quot;, the only paper with a unionized newsroom and contract, was not affected.

The company incorporated as Trib Total Media in the summer of 2005 and purchased Gateway Newspapers, a community publication group servicing approximately 22 communities, at the time, in and around Pittsburgh&#x27;s Allegheny County. The company immediately laid off two managers. The exact number of proposed redundancies was not announced. In September 2005, Harrell announced his retirement as president of Tribune-Review Publishing Company, effective December 31, 2005. He had served as president since 1989. Several staff writers were laid off in December 2005 as two of Gateway&#x27;s newspapers were discontinued.

In May 2008, the &quot;Post-Gazette&quot; and the Trib reached a deal for one company to deliver both papers. The Post-Gazette would begin delivering the Trib to most of the area with some exceptions. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. On June 20, 2008, Trib Total Media publicly announced it was closing several weekly newspapers in the Gateway Newspapers chain. The papers affected include: &quot;Bridgeville Area News&quot;, &quot;North Journal&quot;, &quot;McKnight Journal&quot;, &quot;Woodland Progress&quot;, &quot;Penn Hills Progress&quot;, &quot;Coraopolis-Moon Record&quot; and the &quot;Advance Leader&quot;. Many of those papers were several decades old.

The company also announced major changes to the remaining Gateway publications including a revamp of the Pennysaver in the communities that have Gateway newspapers. Several published reports say the remaining community newspapers would expand coverage to include areas no longer serviced by Gateway publications. Other Gateway newspapers will now serve the communities served by those titles.

In November 2015, Trib Total Media announced that they would be cutting back on home delivery of printed newspapers and emphasize digital delivery. The restructuring included the sale of two dailies and six weeklies to West Penn Media.

Two papers were closed, &quot;The Daily News&quot; in McKeesport, and &quot;The Valley Independent&quot; in Monessen.

The remaining papers, in Pittsburgh, Greensburg, and Tarentum, became regional editions of a single title, the &quot;Tribune-Review&quot;. Home delivery was reduced in some parts of Allegheny and Westmoreland counties. Trib Total Media laid off 153 full and part-time workers from its staff of approximately 1,100, another 68 had accepted buyouts in October.

The Pittsburgh edition of the &quot;Tribune-Review&quot; went all-digital after publishing its last print edition on November 30, 2016. The Greensburg-based Westmoreland edition and the Tarentum-based Valley News Dispatch edition remained in print.

== Investigations and Controversies ==

The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, through reporter Chris Ruddy was heavily involved in spreading rumors about the death of Vincent Foster, an aid to the Bill Clinton administration. The Clinton White House had commissioned a report entitled the &quot;communication stream of conspiracy commerce&quot; which was came to light in 2014.

Carl Prine, an investigative reporter for the newspaper, conducted a probe with the CBS news magazine &quot;60 Minutes&quot; that highlighted the lack of security at the nation&#x27;s most dangerous chemical plants following the September 11, 2001 attacks.

The reporters, and a CBS camera operator, were charged with trespassing at a Neville Island plant during their investigation. They were later acquitted when the judge accepted that the story had been in the public interest.

In 2007, Prine&#x27;s further investigation into the subject was featured in the PBS documentary series Exposé: America&#x27;s Investigative Reports, in a two-part episode titled &quot;Think Like A Terrorist.&quot;

One Tribune-Review flap went national when Colin McNickle, then editor of the newspaper&#x27;s editorial page, attended a July 26, 2004 speech at the Massachusetts State House given by Teresa Heinz Kerry, who had been the subject of two negative articles in the Tribune-Review&#x27;s opinion pages. After the speech, there was a dispute between McNickle and Heinz Kerry over her use of the term &quot;un-American activity.&quot;

== Circulation ==
The daily &quot;Tribune-Review&quot; is published in three geographic editions: Pittsburgh, Westmoreland, and Valley News Dispatch.

The &quot;Tribune-Review&quot; claimed to show the highest gains in readership over the past five years of any newspaper in America&#x27;s top 48 markets, which were dominated by sinking readership. The growth can be attributed to purchases of other newspapers, which were then reclassified as editions of the &quot;Tribune-Review&quot;. This idea was proposed to Scaife and Ralph Martin by David Horchak, the Circulation Director of The Valley News Dispatch. Taking advantage of ABC rules that allowed declaring newspapers to include all circulation of a newspaper to be declared editions of a main newspaper. This did not keep David Horchak on when the &quot;Tribune-Review&quot; decided to have just two circulation directors after personnel cuts.

According to surveys by International Demographics Inc., an independent media research firm in Houston, the number of &quot;Tribune-Review&quot; readers jumped 17.8 percent from 2007 to 2012.

As part of the Trib Total Media conglomerate, the &quot;Tribune-Review&quot; has a news exchange partnership with WPXI, Pittsburgh&#x27;s NBC affiliate. Until 2013, it was a sister publication to Pittsburgh&#x27;s second-largest news radio station, KQV. Trib Total Media is the Official Newspaper of the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Pittsburgh Penguins (the latter of which Scaife was a co-founder in 1967). It has strong partnerships with many nonprofit and community businesses and organizations throughout Western Pennsylvania.

<doc id="903493" wikidata="Q136324" url="?curid=903493" title="Motorized Reserves of the Citizens' Militia">
<text>The Motorized Reserves of the Citizens&#x27; Militia (), commonly known as ZOMO, were paramilitary-police formations during the communist era in Poland. These elite units of Citizens&#x27; Militia (MO) were originally created to fight dangerous criminals, to provide security during mass events, and help in the case of natural disasters and other crises; however, they became known instead for their brutal and sometimes repressive lethal actions of riot control and their role in quelling civil rights protests.

The first ZOMO units were deployed in 1956 and became particularly infamous for their ruthless handling of political opponents under Polish martial law (1981–1983). It was permanently disbanded after the fall of communism in 1989, though the term &quot;ZOMO&quot; remains synonymous with police brutality to this day.

== Early history ==
ZOMO units were created on December 24, 1956, under the direct command of the President of the Council of Ministers of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic and first used in 1957. Their mission statement was defined as &quot;the protection of the nation&quot;, and their main role was as a rapid-response police force, structured after and trained by the instructors from the Schutzpolizei of East Germany. From 1972, the duties of ZOMO included counter-terrorism (including countering aircraft hijackings), with the elite Special Platoons of the ZOMO (pl. &quot;Plutony Specjalne ZOMO&quot;) created in 1978. As opposition to the communist government in Poland grew, the units were expanded to counter the growing unrest, and their role became more of anti-riot police. In 1968, ZOMO was used to disperse the student protests during the 1968 Polish political crisis, leading to the reform of the formation. Two years later in 1970, thousands of troops from the Polish People&#x27;s Army and ZOMO were used to quell the Polish 1970 protests, killing dozens of people and injuring more than 1,000.

==Martial law ==

The ZOMO gained the most of their infamy during the period of martial law in Poland (1981–1983). During this time period their brutal actions against peaceful protesters often affiliated with the oppositionist Solidarity movement, and the subsequent lack of prosecution of those responsible for deaths of protesters, were major factors in bringing down the communist regime. To parody the communist newspeak during that time they were often sarcastically called &quot;The beating heart of the Party&quot; (pl. &quot;Bijące serce Partii&quot;). Since 1990 several trials against former ZOMO members and their political leaders took place, most prominently in the case of the massacre in the Wujek Coal Mine (where nine people were killed and 21 wounded when Katowice&#x27;s Special Platoon opened fire on the striking miners in 1981 in the bloodiest incident of the martial law era).

==Personnel and equipment==
From the mid-1970s ZOMO was reputed to be one of the best trained and equipped police formations in the Eastern Bloc. A candidate for ZOMO had to have a height of at least 180 cm and a weight of at least 90 kg. After the 1968 expansion, people conscripted to the military could optionally serve their draft in ZOMO (during the martial law, the military reservists who had served in ZOMO were called up to the squads of ORMO, reserve units of MO). The formation numbered nearly 13,000 members in the late 1980s (twice the original designation of 6,600), quartered in barracks in the major cities across the country. The martial-law-era ZOMO members were equipped with various police and military vehicles (including BTR-60 armoured personnel carriers in the Special Platoons) and various firearms (including shotguns, submachine guns and automatic rifles) as well as various types of riot equipment (such as batons, tear gas grenades, water cannon trucks, rubber bullets, metal and plastic riot shields and visored helmets). From 1968 they wore military-style uniforms with a very similar camouflage pattern to the one used by the Polish People&#x27;s Army.

==Legacy==

The ZOMO&#x27;s last action took place on July 3, 1989, when they dispersed a demonstration against the presidential candidature of General Wojciech Jaruzelski, former First Secretary and head of the Military Council of National Salvation (WRON). The units were disbanded on September 7, 1989, following the fall of the communist system, and replaced with the OPP (riot control) and SPAP (rapid response and counter-terrorism) units of Policja (the Polish police).

In contemporary Poland the word &quot;ZOMO&quot; (or , the ZOMO-man) is a pejorative term used by protesters to denote all kinds of riot police (just as the word Gestapo is sometimes used to describe police brutality).

<text>The spacing effect demonstrates that learning is more effective when study sessions are spaced out. This effect shows that more information is encoded into long-term memory by spaced study sessions, also known as &quot;spaced repetition&quot; or &quot;spaced presentation&quot;, than by massed presentation (&quot;cramming&quot;).

The phenomenon was first identified by Hermann Ebbinghaus, and his detailed study of it was published in the 1885 book (&quot;Memory: A Contribution to Experimental Psychology&quot;), which suggests that active recall with increasing time intervals reduces the probability of forgetting information. This robust finding has been supported by studies of many explicit memory tasks such as free recall, recognition, cued-recall, and frequency estimation (for reviews see Crowder 1976; Greene, 1989).

Researchers have offered several possible explanations of the spacing effect, and much research has been conducted that supports its impact on recall. In spite of these findings, the robustness of this phenomenon and its resistance to experimental manipulation have made empirical testing of its parameters difficult.

While many others have contributed important research regarding the spacing effect, Robert Bjork and his associates in the Bjork Learning and Forgetting Lab and Cogfog group at UCLA have performed much research into various aspects of this phenomenon as well as into its practical application for education.

==Causes==
Decades of research on memory and recall have produced many different theories and findings on the spacing effect. In a study conducted by Cepeda et al. (2006) participants who used spaced practice on memory tasks outperformed those using massed practice in 259 out of 271 cases.

As different studies support different aspects of this effect, some now believe that an appropriate account should be multi-factorial, and at present, different mechanisms are invoked to account for the spacing effect in free recall and in cued-memory tasks.

Not much attention has been given to the study of the spacing effect in long-term retention tests. Shaughnessy (1977) found that the spacing effect is not robust for items presented twice after a 24-hour delay in testing. The spacing effect is present, however, for items presented four or six times and tested after a 24-hour delay. The result was interesting because other studies using only twice-presented items have shown a strong spacing effect, although the lag between learning and testing was longer. Shaughnessy interprets it as evidence that no single explanatory mechanism can be used to account for the various manifestations of the spacing effect.

=== Semantic priming ===
Research has shown reliable spacing effects in cued-memory tasks under incidental learning conditions, where semantic analysis is encouraged through orienting tasks (Challis, 1993; Russo &amp; Mammaralla, 2002). Challis found a spacing effect for target words using a frequency estimation task after words were incidentally analyzed semantically. However, no spacing effect was found when the target words were shallowly encoded using a graphemic study task. This suggests that semantic priming underlies the spacing effect in cued-memory tasks. When items are presented in a massed fashion, the first occurrence of the target semantically primes the mental representation of that target, such that when the second occurrence appears directly after the first, there is a reduction in its semantic processing. Semantic priming wears off after a period of time (Kirsner, Smith, Lockhart, &amp; King, 1984), which is why there is less semantic priming of the second occurrence of a spaced item. Thus on the semantic priming account, the second presentation is more strongly primed and receives less semantic processing when the repetitions are massed compared to when presentations are spaced over short lags (Challis, 1993). This semantic priming mechanism provides spaced words with more extensive processing than massed words, producing the spacing effect.

From this explanation of the spacing effect, it follows that this effect should not occur with nonsense stimuli that do not have a semantic representation in memory. A number of studies have demonstrated that the semantically based repetition priming approach cannot explain spacing effects in recognition memory for stimuli such as unfamiliar faces, and non-words that are not amenable to semantic analysis (Russo, Parkin, Taylor, &amp; Wilks, 1998; Russo et al., 2002; Mammarella, Russo, &amp; Avons, 2005). Cornoldi and Longoni (1977) have even found a significant spacing effect in a forced-choice recognition memory task when nonsense shapes were used as target stimuli. Russo et al. (1998) proposed that with cued memory of unfamiliar stimuli, a short-term perceptually-based repetition priming mechanism supports the spacing effect. When unfamiliar stimuli are used as targets in a cued-memory task, memory relies on the retrieval of structural-perceptual information about the targets. When the items are presented in a massed fashion, the first occurrence primes its second occurrence, leading to reduced perceptual processing of the second presentation. Short-term repetition-priming effects for nonwords are reduced when the lag between prime and target trials is reduced from zero to six (McKone, 1995), thus it follows that more extensive perceptual processing is given to the second occurrence of spaced items relative to that given to massed items. Hence, nonsense items with massed presentation receive less extensive perceptual processing than spaced items; thus, the retrieval of those items is impaired in cued-memory tasks.

Congruent with this view, Russo et al. (2002) demonstrated that changing the font in which repeated presentations of nonwords were presented reduced the short-term perceptual priming of those stimuli, especially for massed items. Upon a recognition memory test, there was no spacing effect found for the nonwords presented in different fonts during study. These results support the hypothesis that short-term perceptual priming is the mechanism that supports the spacing effects in cued-memory tasks when unfamiliar stimuli are used as targets. Furthermore, when the font was changed between repeated presentations of words in the study phase, there was no reduction of the spacing effect. This resistance to the font manipulation is expected with this two-factor account, as semantic processing of words at study determines performance on a later memory test, and the font manipulation is irrelevant to this form of processing.

Mammarella, Russo, &amp; Avons (2002) also demonstrated that changing the orientation of faces between repeated presentations served to eliminate the spacing effect. Unfamiliar faces do not have stored representations in memory, thus the spacing effect for these stimuli would be a result of perceptual priming. Changing orientation served to alter the physical appearance of the stimuli, thus reducing the perceptual priming at the second occurrence of the face when presented in a massed fashion. This led to equal memory for faces presented in massed and spaced fashions, hence eliminating the spacing effect.

=== Encoding variability ===
The encoding variability theory holds that performance on a memory test is determined by the overlap between the available contextual information during the test and the contextual information available during the encoding. According to this view, spaced repetition typically entails some variability in presentation contexts, resulting in a greater number of retrieval cues. Contrastingly, massed repetitions have limited presentations and therefore fewer retrieval cues. The notion of the efficacy of the increased variability of encoding is supported by the position that the more independent encodings are, the more different types of cues are associated with an item.

There are two types of encoding variability theory that address the spacing effect. The first maintains that the spacing effect refers to the changes in the semantic interpretations of items which cause the effect, while the second holds that variability surrounding context is responsible for the spacing effect, not only semantic variability.

To test the encoding variability theory, Bird, Nicholson, and Ringer (1978) presented subjects with word lists that either had massed or spaced repetitions. Subjects were asked to perform various &quot;orienting tasks&quot;, tasks which require the subject to make a simple judgment about the list item (i.e. pleasant or unpleasant, active or passive). Subjects either performed the same task for each occurrence of a word or a different task for each occurrence. If the encoding variability theory were true, then the case of different orienting tasks ought to provide variable encoding, even for massed repetitions, resulting in a higher rate of recall for massed repetitions than would be expected. The results showed no such effect, providing strong evidence against the importance of encoding variability.

=== Study-phase retrieval theory ===
A theory that has gained a lot of traction recently is the &quot;study-phase retrieval theory&quot;. This theory assumes that the first presentation is retrieved at the time of the second. This leads to an elaboration of the first memory trace. Massed presentations do not yield advantages because the first trace is active at the time of the second, so it is not retrieved or elaborated upon. Greene (1989) proposed a two-factor account of the spacing effect, combining deficient processing and study-phase retrieval accounts. Spacing effects in free recall are accounted for by the study-phase retrieval account. Under the assumption that free recall is sensitive to contextual associations, spaced items are at an advantage over massed items by the additional encoding of contextual information. Thus, the second occurrence of an item in a list reminds the observer of the previous occurrence of that same item and of its previous contextual features. Different contextual information is encoded with each presentation, whereas for massed items, the difference in context is relatively small. More retrieval cues, then, are encoded with spaced learning, which in turn leads to improved recall.

=== Deficient processing ===
According to the &quot;deficient processing&quot; view, massed repetitions lead to deficient processing of the second presentation—that we simply do not pay much attention to the later presentations (Hintzman et al., 1973). Greene (1989) proposed this to be the case in cued-memory tasks (e.g. recognition memory, frequency estimation tasks), which rely more on item information and less on contextual information. The increased voluntary rehearsal of spaced items makes this deficient processing noticeable. Findings that the spacing effect is not found when items are studied through incidental learning support this account.

=== Retrieval effort hypothesis ===
According to research conducted by Pyc and Rawson (2009), successful but effortful retrieval tasks during practice enhance memory in an account known as the &quot;retrieval effort hypothesis&quot;. Spacing out the learning and relearning of items leads to a more effortful retrieval which provides for deeper processing of the item.

== Practical applications and long-term retention ==

===Advertising===
The spacing effect and its underlying mechanisms have important applications to the world of advertising. For instance, the spacing effect dictates that it is not an effective advertising strategy to present the same commercial back-to-back (massed repetition). Spaced ads were remembered better than ads that had been repeated back to back. Layout variations presented in short spacing intervals also resulted in improved recall compared to ads presented in exact repetition. The same effect was also achieved in a study involving website advertisements. It was revealed that sales diminish progressively as the customer visited the site and was exposed to the ad several times. However, if the elapsed time between the visits was longer, the advertisement had a bigger effect on sales. If encoding variability is an important mechanism of the spacing effect, then a good advertising strategy might include a distributed presentation of different versions of the same ad.

Appleton-Knapp, Bjork and Wickens (2005) examined the effects of spacing on advertising. They found that spaced repetitions of advertisements are more affected by study-phase retrieval processes than encoding variability. They also found that at long intervals, varying the presentation of a given ad is not effective in producing higher recall rates among subjects (as predicted by variable encoding). Despite this finding, recognition is not affected by variations in an ad at long intervals.

===Application in education===
Studies have shown that long-term spacing effects are prevalent in learning and produce significant learning gains, particularly when the spacing gaps are on the order of days or weeks. Although it is accepted that spacing is beneficial in learning a subject well and previous units should be revisited and practiced, textbooks are written in discrete chapters that do not support these findings. Rohrer conducted a two-part study in 2006 where students were taught how to solve math problems. In part 1, students either used mass or spaced practice, and spaced practice showed significant improvement over mass practice when tested one week later. In the second part of the experiment, practice problems were either grouped by type or mixed randomly. The desirable difficulties encountered by the randomly mixed problems were effective, and the performance by students who solved the randomly mixed problems was vastly superior to the students who solved the problems grouped by type. The reasoning behind this increased performance was that students know the formula for solving equations, but do not always know when to apply the formula. By shuffling problems around and dispersing them across multiple chapters, students also learn to identify when it is appropriate to use which formula. There is conclusive evidence that cumulative final exams promote long-term retention by forcing spaced learning to occur.

===Learning and pedagogy===
The long-term effects of spacing have also been assessed in the context of learning a foreign language. Bahrick et al. (1993) examined the retention of newly learned foreign vocabulary words as a function of relearning sessions and intersession spacing over a nine-year period.

Both the amount of relearning sessions and the number of days in between each session have a major impact on retention (the repetition effect and the spacing effect), yet the two variables do not interact with each other.

For all three difficulty rankings of the foreign words, recall was highest for the 56-day interval as opposed to a 28-day or a 14-day interval. Additionally, 13 sessions spaced 56 days apart yielded comparable retention to 26 sessions with a 14-day interval.

These findings have implications for educational practices. Current school and university curricula rarely provide students with opportunities for periodic retrieval of previously acquired knowledge. Without spaced repetitions, students are more likely to forget foreign language vocabulary.

=== Lag effect ===
While the spacing effect refers to improved recall for spaced versus successive (mass) repetition, the term &#x27;lag&#x27; can be interpreted as the time interval between repetitions of learning. The &quot;lag effect&quot; is simply an idea branching off the spacing effect that states recall after long lags between learning is better versus short lags. Michael Kahana&#x27;s study showed strong evidence that the lag effect is present when recalling word lists. In 2008, Kornell and Bjork published a study that suggested inductive learning is more effective when spaced than massed. Inductive learning is learning through observation of exemplars, so the participants did not actively take notes or solve problems. These results were replicated and backed up by a second independent study.

<text>Benjamin Apthorp Gould (September 27, 1824 – November 26, 1896) was a pioneering American astronomer. He is noted for creating the &quot;Astronomical Journal&quot;, discovering the Gould Belt, and for founding of the Argentine National Observatory and the Argentine National Weather Service.

==Biography==
He was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Lucretia Dana (Goddard) and Benjamin Apthorp Gould, the principal of Boston Latin School, which the younger Gould attended. The poet Hannah Flagg Gould was his aunt. After going on to Harvard College and graduating in 1844, he studied mathematics and astronomy under C. F. Gauss at Göttingen, Germany, during which time he published approximately 20 papers on the observation and motion of comets and asteroids. Following completion of his Ph.D. (he was the first American to receive this degree in astronomy) he toured European observatories asking for advice on what could be done to further astronomy as a professional science in the U.S.A. The main advice he received was to start a professional journal modeled after what was then the world&#x27;s leading astronomical publication, the &quot;Astronomische Nachrichten&quot;.

Gould returned to America in 1848 and from 1852 to 1867 worked in the United States Coast Survey, where he worked in geodetic astronomy and was in charge of the longitude department. He developed and organized the service, was one of the first to determine longitudes by telegraphic means, and employed the Atlantic cable in 1866 to establish accurate longitude-relations between Europe and America. One of his assistants and life-long mentee was Seth Carlo Chandler, who went on to discover the Chandler wobble.

After his return to Cambridge, Massachusetts, Gould started the &quot;Astronomical Journal&quot; in 1849, which he published until 1861. He resumed publication in 1885 and it is still published today. From 1855 to 1859 he acted as director of the Dudley Observatory at Albany, New York, and in 1859 published a discussion of the places and proper motions of circumpolar stars to be used as standards by the United States Coast Survey. In 1861 he undertook the enormous task of preparing for publication the records of astronomical observations made at the United States Naval Observatory since 1850.

In 1851 Gould suggested numbering asteroids in their order of discovery, and placing this number in a disk (circle) as the generic symbol of an asteroid. That same year, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

In 1864 he was admitted to the Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati to represent his grandfather Captain Benjamin Gould. In the 1890s he became an early member of the Massachusetts Society of the Sons of the American Revolution.

Appointed in 1862 actuary to the United States Sanitary Commission, he issued in 1869 an important volume of &quot;Investigations in the Military and Anthropological Statistics of American Soldiers&quot;. This study, informed by Gould&#x27;s commitment to race science, purported to construct typologies of Black and Indigenous bodies, in particular. In 1864 he fitted up a private observatory at Cambridge, Massachusetts, and undertook in 1868, on behalf of the Argentine republic, to organize a national observatory at Córdoba. In 1871 he became the first director of the Argentine National Observatory (today, Observatorio Astronómico de Córdoba of the National University of Córdoba). While there, he and four assistants (including Miles Rock) extensively mapped the southern hemisphere skies using newly developed photometric methods. On June 1, 1884, he made the last definite sighting of the Great Comet of 1882. The need of astronomers for good weather prediction spurred Gould to collaborate with Argentine colleagues to develop the Argentine National Weather Service, the first in South America.

Gould&#x27;s measurements of L. M. Rutherfurd&#x27;s photographs of the Pleiades in 1866 entitle him to rank as a pioneer in the use of the camera as an instrument of precision; and he secured at Córdoba 1400 negatives of southern star clusters, the reduction of which occupied the closing years of his life. He remained in Argentina until 1885, when he returned to Cambridge, Massachusetts. He received the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1883 and the James Craig Watson Medal in 1887. Astronomers continue to investigate the astrophysics of a large scale feature of the Milky Way to which he called their attention in 1877, and honor him with its name, The Gould Belt. A crater on the Moon is named after him. Gould was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1892. He died at Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1896.

===Uranography===
In 1874, while in Argentina with his assistants, Gould completed his greatest work, the &quot;Uranometria Argentina&quot;, consisting of an atlas published in 1877 and catalog in 1879, for which he received in 1883 the gold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society. The atlas introduced the system of defining constellation boundaries along lines of right ascension and declination, which was officially adopted by the International Astronomical Union for the whole sky in 1930. The catalog assigned Gould designations to all bright stars within 100 degrees of the south celestial pole in a manner similar to what Flamsteed had earlier done for the northern hemisphere. An updated version, to which late 20th century data have been appended to the complete information for all stars in the original Uranometria Argentina, is available at www.uranometriaargentina.com/. 

Gould followed his &quot;Uranometria Argentina&quot; with a zone-catalogue of 73,160 stars (1884), and a general catalogue (1885) compiled from meridian observations of 32,448 stars.

==Personal Life==
Alice Bache Gould (1868–1953), a mathematician, philanthropist, and historian, was one of his five children.

<text>A tracking transmitter broadcasts a radio signal which can be detected by a directional antenna (typically a Radio Direction Finder). By rotating the antenna one can determine the direction the signal lies in and of course whatever it may be attached to. The EPIRB is an example of a similar device.

It is commonly used in model rocketry and remote control aircraft to locate lost equipment.

<doc id="903516" wikidata="Q186470" url="?curid=903516" title="Tonsillitis">
<text>Tonsillitis is inflammation of the tonsils in the upper part of the throat. It can be acute or chronic. Acute tonsillitis typically has a rapid onset. Symptoms may include sore throat, fever, enlargement of the tonsils, trouble swallowing, and enlarged lymph nodes around the neck. Complications include peritonsillar abscess (quinsy).
Tonsillitis is most commonly caused by a viral infection and about 5% to 40% of cases are caused by a bacterial infection. When caused by the bacterium group A streptococcus, it is classed as streptococcal tonsillitis also referred to as &quot;strep throat&quot;. Rarely bacteria such as &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot;, &quot;Corynebacterium diphtheriae&quot;, or &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot; may be the cause. Typically the infection is spread between people through the air. A scoring system, such as the Centor score, may help separate possible causes. Confirmation may be by a throat swab or rapid strep test.
Treatment efforts involve improving symptoms and decreasing complications. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) and ibuprofen may be used to help with pain. If strep throat is present the antibiotic penicillin by mouth is generally recommended. In those who are allergic to penicillin, cephalosporins or macrolides may be used. In children with frequent episodes of tonsillitis, tonsillectomy modestly decreases the risk of future episodes.
About 7.5% of people have a sore throat in any three-month period and 2% of people visit a doctor for tonsillitis each year. It is most common in school-aged children and typically occurs in the colder months of autumn and winter. The majority of people recover with or without medication. In 82% of people, symptoms resolve within one week, regardless if bacteria or viruses were present. Antibiotics probably reduce the number of people experiencing sore throat or headache, but the balance between modest symptom reduction and the potential hazards of antimicrobial resistance must be recognised.

==Signs and symptoms==
Those with tonsillitis usually experience sore throat, painful swallowing, malaise, and fever. Their tonsils – and often the back of the throat – appear red and swollen, and sometimes give off a white discharge. Some also have tender swelling of the cervical lymph nodes.

Many viral infections that cause tonsillitis will also cause cough, runny nose, hoarse voice, or blistering in the mouth or throat. Infectious mononucleosis can cause the tonsils to swell with red spots or white discharge that may extend to the tongue. This can be accompanied by fever, sore throat, cervical lymph node swelling, and enlargement of the liver and spleen. Bacterial infections that cause tonsillitis can also cause a distinct &quot;scarletiniform&quot; rash, vomiting, and tonsillar spots or discharge.

Tonsilloliths occur in up to 10% of the population frequently due to episodes of tonsillitis.

==Causes==
Viral infections cause 40 to 60% of cases of tonsillitis. Many viruses can cause inflammation of the tonsils (and the rest of throat) including adenovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, coxsackievirus, measles virus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and herpes simplex virus. Tonsillitis can also be part of the initial reaction to HIV infection. An estimated 1 to 10% of the cases are caused by Epstein-Barr virus.

Tonsillitis can also stem from infection with bacteria, predominantly Group A β-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS), which causes strep throat. Bacterial infection of the tonsils usually follows the initial viral infection. When tonsillitis recurs after antibiotic treatment for streptococcus bacteria, it is usually due to the same bacteria as the first time, which suggests that the antibiotic treatment was not fully effective. Less common bacterial causes include: &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;Chlamydia pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;Bordetella pertussis&quot;, &quot;Fusobacterium&quot; sp., &quot;Corynebacterium diphtheriae&quot;, &quot;Treponema pallidum&quot;, and &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot;.

Anaerobic bacteria have been implicated in tonsillitis, and a possible role in the acute inflammatory process is supported by several clinical and scientific observations.

Sometimes tonsillitis is caused by an infection of spirochaeta and treponema, which is called Vincent&#x27;s angina or Plaut-Vincent angina.

Within the tonsils, white blood cells of the immune system destroy the viruses or bacteria by producing inflammatory cytokines like phospholipase A2, which also lead to fever. The infection may also be present in the throat and surrounding areas, causing inflammation of the pharynx.

==Diagnosis==
There is no firm distinction between a sore throat that is specifically tonsillitis and a sore throat caused by inflammation in both the tonsils and also nearby tissues. An acute sore throat may be diagnosed as &quot;tonsillitis&quot;, &quot;pharyngitis&quot;, or &quot;tonsillopharyngitis&quot; (also called pharyngotonsillitis), depending upon the clinical findings.

In primary care settings, the Centor criteria are used to determine the likelihood of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) infection in an acute tonsillitis and the need of antibiotics for tonsillitis treatment. However, the Centor criteria have their weaknesses in making precise diagnosis for adults. The Centor criteria are also ineffective in diagnosis for tonsillitis in children and in secondary care settings (hospitals). A modified version of the Centor criteria, which modified the original Centor criteria in 1998, is often used to aid in diagnosis. The original Centor criteria had four major criteria but the modified Centor criteria have five. The five major criteria of the modified Centor score are:

# Presence of tonsillar exudate
# Painful neck lymph nodes
# History of fever
# Age between five and fifteen years
# Absence of cough

The possibility of GABHS infection increases with increasing score. The probability for getting GABHS is 2 to 23% for the score of 1, and 25 to 85% for the score of 4.
The diagnosis of GABHS tonsillitis can be confirmed by culture of samples obtained by swabbing the throat and plating them on blood agar medium. This small percentage of false-negative results are part of the characteristics of the tests used but are also possible if the person has received antibiotics prior to testing. Identification requires 24 to 48 hours by culture but rapid screening tests (10–60 minutes), which have a sensitivity of 85–90%, are available. In 40% of the people without any symptoms, the throat culture can be positive. Therefore, throat culture is not routinely used in clinical practice for the detection of GABHS.

Centor and McIsaac scores are equally ineffective at identifying patients who need antibiotics presenting with pharyngitis at hospitals. Too many true positive cases are missed and too many false positives are treated, leading to the over prescription of antibiotics.

Bacterial culture may need to be performed in cases of a negative rapid streptococcal test. An increase in antistreptolysin O (ASO) streptococcal antibody titer following the acute infection can provide retrospective evidence of GABHS infection and is considered definitive proof of GABHS infection, but not necessarily of the tonsils.
Epstein Barr virus serology can be tested for those who may have infectious mononucleosis with a typical lymphocyte count in full blood count result. Blood investigations are only required for those with hospital admission requiring intravenous antibiotics.

Nasoendoscopy can be used for those with severe neck pain and inability to swallow any fluids to rule out masked epiglotitis and supraglotitis. Routine nasoendscopy is not recommended for children.

==Treatment==
Treatments to reduce the discomfort from tonsillitis include:
* pain and fever reducing medications such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) and ibuprofen
* warm salt water gargle, lozenges, honey, or warm liquids

There are no antiviral medical treatments for virally caused tonsillitis.

===Antibiotics===
If the tonsillitis is caused by group A streptococcus, then antibiotics are useful, with penicillin or amoxicillin being primary choices. Cephalosporins and macrolides are considered good alternatives to penicillin in the acute care setting. A macrolide, such as azithromycin or erythromycin, is used for people allergic to penicillin. If penicillin therapy fails, bacterial tonsillitis may respond to treatment effective against beta-lactamase producing bacteria such as clindamycin or amoxicillin-clavulanate. Aerobic and anaerobic beta lactamase producing bacteria that reside in the tonsillar tissues can &quot;shield&quot; group A streptococcus from penicillins. There is no significant difference in efficacy of various groups of antibiotics for treating tonsillitis. Intravenous antibiotics can be for those who are hospitalized with inability to swallow and presented with complications. Oral antibiotics can be resumed immediately if the person is clinically improved and able to swallow orally. Antibiotic treatment is usually taken for seven to ten days.

===Pain medication===
Paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be used to treat throat pain in children and adults. Codeine is avoided in children under 12 years of age to treat throat pain or following tonsilectomy. NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen) and opioids (such as codeine and tramadol) are equally effective at relieving pain, however, precautions should be taken with these pain medications. NSAIDs can cause peptic ulcer disease and kidney damage. Opioids can cause respiratory depression in those who are vulnerable. Anaesthetic mouthwash can also be used for symptomatic relief.

===Corticosteroids===
Corticosteroids reduce tonsillitis pain and improve symptoms in 24 to 48 hours. Oral corticosteroids are recommended unless the person is unable to swallow medications.

===Surgery===
When tonsillitis recurs frequently, often arbitrarily defined as at least five episodes of tonsillitis in a year, or when the palatine tonsils become so swollen that swallowing is difficult as well as painful, a tonsillectomy can be performed to surgically remove the tonsils. A randomised controlled trial of tonsillectomy versus medical treatment (antibiotics and pain killers) in adults with frequent tonsillitis found that tonsillectomy was more effective and cost effective. It resulted in fewer days with sore throat.

Children have had only a modest benefit from tonsillectomy for repeated cases of tonsillitis.

==Prognosis==
Since the advent of penicillin in the 1940s, a major preoccupation in the treatment of streptococcal tonsillitis has been the prevention of rheumatic fever, and its major effects on the nervous system and heart.

Complications may rarely include dehydration and kidney failure due to difficulty swallowing, blocked airways due to inflammation, and pharyngitis due to the spread of infection.

An abscess may develop lateral to the tonsil during an infection, typically several days after the onset of tonsillitis. This is termed a peritonsillar abscess (or quinsy).

Rarely, the infection may spread beyond the tonsil resulting in inflammation and infection of the internal jugular vein giving rise to a spreading infectious thrombophlebitis (Lemierre&#x27;s syndrome).

In strep throat, diseases like post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis can occur. These complications are extremely rare in developed nations but remain a significant problem in poorer nations.

== Epidemiology ==
Tonsillitis occurs throughout the world, without racial or ethnic differences. Most children have tonsillitis at least once during their childhood, although it rarely occurs before the age of two. It most typically occurs between the ages of four and five; bacterial infections most typically occur at a later age.

==Society and culture==
Tonsillitis is described in the ancient Greek Hippocratic Corpus.

Recurrent tonsillitis can interfere with vocal function and the ability to perform among people who use their voices professionally.

<text>Anita Garvin (born Anna Frances Garvin; February 11, 1906 – July 7, 1994) was an American stage performer and film actress who worked in both the silent and sound eras. Before her retirement in 1942, she reportedly appeared in over 350 shorts and features for various Hollywood studios. Her best known roles are as supporting characters in Hal Roach comedies starring Laurel and Hardy and Charley Chase.

==Early life and stage career==
Anna Frances Garvin was born in 1906 in New York City, the middle child of three children of Anne (née Donovan) and Edward J. Garvin, a native of North Carolina. &quot;&quot; as a child, her desire to become an entertainer was encouraged by two sisters who were members of another family living in the same apartment building as the Garvins. The sisters were also dancers in vaudeville. &quot;They were very nice to me&quot;, recalled Garvin in a 1978 interview. &quot;They&#x27;d teach me different steps and I would practice with them.&quot;

In 1918, only 12 years of age, she applied for a job as a bathing beauty in one of Mack Sennett&#x27;s New York stage shows. When the casting agent asked her age, Garvin replied, &quot;&#x27;Well, almost 16&#x27;&quot;. She got the job. The next year she joined the Ziegfeld Follies and later performed in The Earl Carroll Vanities. In 1920, she appeared on stage as &quot;The Kirchner Girl&quot;, a 10-minute vaudeville act produced by Ernest Brengk.

The 14-year-old performer recreated the poses of women in seven different paintings by artist Ernst Ludwig Kirchner. For each simulated artwork, she was able to change costumes on stage by means of a curtain suspended between two columns. In its April 16, 1920 review of the act, the widely read trade paper &quot;Variety&quot; states, &quot;Miss Garvin is a stunning looking brunet [sic] who has a corking figure, and is ideally suited for the act.&quot; She then appeared in Herman Timberg&#x27;s &quot;Frolics of 1922&quot; before joining a tour with the musical &quot;Sally&quot;. She performed in that show for two seasons, opting in 1924 to remain in California when the tour left the state for other scheduled venues.

In Hollywood, Garvin began working for Christie Film Company&#x27;s comedies. She recalled her co-star Bobby Vernon dropping butter on the floor onto which she stepped and tumbled, cementing her career as a comedian. Charles Lamont brought her over to work for Educational Pictures. Then, in 1926, she was hired by Hal Roach Studios, where over the next several years she appeared in many silent shorts with Charley Chase, James Finlayson, Max Davidson, and Laurel and Hardy. She was also cast occasionally in supporting roles in features. A statuesque presence at 5&#x27; 9&quot;, &quot;her regal countenance and deadpan expression&quot; made her the perfect comic foil. Garvin continued to impress Roach with her talents and on-screen presence, so much so that he later ranked her as &quot;one of his finest actresses.&quot; In a 1978 interview for an article in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, she reflects on her frequent work with Stan Laurel during that period: Garvin appeared in a total of 11 Laurel and Hardy films. In 1928-29 she had her own starring series, teamed with fellow actress Marion Byron to perform as a distaff version of Stan and Ollie. The best-known of the three Garvin-Byron comedies is &quot;A Pair of Tights&quot;, an &quot;acknowledged masterpiece&quot; in which the girls go out on a double date with tightwads Edgar Kennedy and Stuart Erwin.

In the sound era, Garvin continued working in comedies produced at Educational, Warner Brothers/Vitaphone, RKO Radio Pictures, and Columbia Pictures. She continued to work as well in Laurel and Hardy shorts with Hal Roach, such as in the 1930 release &quot;Blotto&quot; in which she plays Stan&#x27;s feisty wife. A decade later she performed in the 1940 Three Stooges short &quot;Cookoo Cavaliers&quot;, briefly appearing as a customer requesting a haddock.

==Personal life and death==
On March 15, 1926 in Ventura, California, Garvin married Clement Beauchamp, a film actor and assistant unit director for Fox Film. They divorced in 1930, and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; covered the related court proceedings. A witness for Garvin, according to the newspaper, testified that &quot;she knew that Mrs. Beauchamp had to support herself&quot; due to the lack of spousal assistance. Quoting Garvin herself, the newspaper in an August 6 new item shares her main reason for ending the four-year marriage:
Later in 1930, after finalizing her divorce from Beauchamp, Garvin married Clifford &quot;Red&quot; Stanley, a bandleader and music editor for a film studio. Their marriage lasted nearly 50 years, until Clifford&#x27;s death in 1980. During the first decade of their marriage, Garvin continued to perform in films, but by 1942 she retired from acting to devote more time to raising the couple&#x27;s two children. Decades after she left acting, moviegoers continued to remember and acknowledge Garvin&#x27;s contributions to film history. The Sons of the Desert — an international fraternal organization devoted to the lives and films of Laurel and Hardy — honored her career at their membership meetings in 1978 and 1989.

Five years after her last appearance before The Sons of the Desert, Garvin died at the Motion Picture Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California.

She is buried in section E of San Fernando Mission Cemetery in Mission Hills, California.

<doc id="903525" wikidata="Q34142" url="?curid=903525" title="Tausug language">
<text>Tausūg (, , , ) is an Austronesian language spoken in the province of Sulu in the Philippines and in the eastern area of the state of Sabah, Malaysia. It is widely spoken in the Sulu Archipelago (Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, and Basilan), the Zamboanga Peninsula (Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga Sibugay, Zamboanga del Sur, and Zamboanga City), southern Palawan, Malaysia (eastern Sabah), and Indonesia (Tarakan City and Nunukan Regency, province of North Kalimantan).

Tausūg has some lexical similarities or near similarities with Surigaonon language of the provinces Surigao del Norte, Surigao del Sur, and Agusan del Sur and with the Butuanon language of Agusan del Norte; it has also some vocabulary similarities with Sugbuanon, Bicolano, and with other Philippine languages. Many Malay and Arabic words are found in Tausug language.

==Nomenclature==
In English, the language is primarily known as Tausug (i.e., Tausug language &quot;language of the Tausug people&quot;). The local name of the language is &quot;bahasa Sūg&quot; (Sulu language). The term Tausūg (, meaning &quot;people of Sulu&quot;) is derived from two words: &quot;tau&quot; (&quot;person&quot;) and &quot;Sūg&quot; (The transformation of &quot;Sūk&quot;, itself the contraction of Sūlūk). Thus, in Tausug, &quot;Tausug&quot; refers to people while &quot;Bahasa Sūg&quot; refers to the language. Several scholars postulate that &quot;Sūlūk&quot; derives from &quot;Ahl ul-Sūlūk&quot;, or &quot;people of the path (to Allah),&quot; in reference to the Islamic missionaries who arrived to spread the religion of Islam. Meanwhile, a similar sounding word &quot;sug&quot;, which means &quot;water-current&quot;, has been given by a number of writers as the etymologic source of the term; the two words, even if similarly pronounced, are not related. In the past, the language has also been simply referred to using the generic term &quot;Moro&quot;.

==Classification==

Tausūg is an Austronesian language. It is classified by linguists as being a member of the Bisayan languages family, which includes Cebuano and Waray. In particular, it has many similarities with the Surigaonon language of the provinces Surigao del Norte, Surigao del Sur and Agusan del Sur and with the Butuanon language of Agusan del Norte – both spoken in northeastern Mindanao; hence, Zorc (1977) groups these three languages as part of a &quot;South Bisayan&quot; grouping.

==Speakers==

Tausūg is primarily spoken in the Sulu Archipelago, which aside from the island of Sulu, also includes the Tawi-Tawi chain of islands and the island of Basilan. It is a lingua franca spoken in different areas/islands of the archipelago.

Due to migration, the language is also spoken alongside other local languages in the Zamboanga Peninsula (e.g., Cebuano and Chavacano), which includes the provinces of Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga Sibugay, Zamboanga del Sur, and Zamboanga City. It is also spoken in Southern Palawan, Eastern Sabah, Malaysia and in Tarakan City and Nunukan Regency, North Kalimantan, Indonesia.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
Tausūg has three vowel phonemes: /a/, /i/, /u/, with phonemic length (e.g. &quot;īpun&quot;, &quot;shrimp&quot; vs. &quot;ipun&quot;, &quot;tooth&quot;). Stress is not phonemic and usually occurs on the final syllable.

The vowel phonemes have a broad range of allophones:
*/a/: 
*/i/: 
*/u/: 

Tausūg has expectedly developed some variations in accent and vocabulary from one area to another, but there are two basic dialects characterized by differences with regard to vowel sounds. The &quot;Gimbahanun&quot; (literally means people from the farm) speakers, the residents of the out-of-town rural areas, use four vowels: /a/, /i/, /u/ and /ə/, the last vowel representing schwa sound or &quot;obscure u&quot;, a retention from Proto-Philippine and Proto-Bisayan. The &quot;Parianun&quot;, the residents of the urban areas, use only three vowel phonemes: /a/, /i/, /u/,; the loss of /ə/ is common in many Bisayan and other Philippine languages.

===Consonants===
The consonant phonemes are:

Allophones:
* /b/: per default , but between vowels
* /g/: per default , but between vowels
* /h/: per default , but between vowels
* /r/: per default , but before /m,n,g,k/

Medial gemination (of all non-glottal consonants) is phonemic.

**&quot;It was Nasul who ate the mango.&quot;
*&quot;Nagdakdak sin baju&#x27; in manga bujang.&quot; 
** &quot;The maidens washed clothes.&quot;

==Writing system==

Tausūg is today primarily written using the Latin alphabet. Historically, it had previously been written using the Arabic alphabet. The script used was derived from Jawi used in writing the Malay language. The script is referred to as &quot;Sulat Sug&quot;

The Arabic script used to write Tausūg differs in some aspects from the script used for Arabic and in the Jawi script used for Malay.

In Sulu, there is no separate letter for [g]. Whereas in Jawi, the sound [g] is represented with the letter (which has a pronunciation [ɣ] in Arabic) is reserved for Arabic loanwords, and sometimes the letter .

In Sulu, there is no differentiation between [f] and [p]. Whereas in Jawi, the letters and are used respectively, in Sulu the letter is used in all instances.

For the sound [ɲ] in the final position, in Sulu, the letter is used whereas in Malay Jawi, the letter is instead used. The letter is associated with the sound [p] in Persian and other scripts derived from Persian. In both Malay Jawi and Sulu the letter / is used in all other positions.

For the sound [k] in the final position, in Malay Jawi, the letter is used, having the same form as when in initial or medial positions. In Sulu, similar to Arabic, it is customary to use .

<text>The Tausug (also spelled Tausog; natively , Jawi: ) are an Austronesian ethnic group native to the Sulu Archipelago and northeastern coastal areas of Borneo, which spans present-day Philippines and Malaysia. Large Tausug populations are also found in the cities of mainland Mindanao, in particular Zamboanga City, Cotabato City and Davao City, and the island of Palawan. Smaller Tausug communities can be found in North Kalimantan in Indonesia.

Following the introduction of Islam to the Sulu Archipelago in the 14th century, the Tausug established the Sultanate of Sulu, a thalassocratic state that exercised sovereignty over the islands that bordered the Zamboanga Peninsula in the east to Palawan in the north. At its peak, it also covered areas further inland in northeastern Borneo and southwestern Mindanao. During the Spanish colonial period of the Philippines, Tausug soldiers resisted repeated Spanish invasions and the Sultanate of Sulu remained a de facto independent state until 1915, following the Moro Rebellion which resulted in the state being annexed by the United States. 

Following the independence of the Philippines in 1946, the Philippines has acted as the successor state of the Sultanate of Sulu, which has led to tensions with neighboring predominantly-Christian ethnic groups. Today, the Tausug form a part of the wider Muslim-majority Moro political identity in the Philippines, and have continued their shared struggle for self-determination. This has culminated in a decades-long insurgency in Mindanao, and a territorial dispute between Malaysia and the Philippines. In Malaysia, ethnic Tausug people are known by the ethnonym Suluk and have more recently formed a distinct socio-political identity from Tausug refugees arriving in Malaysia due to continued conflict in the southern Philippines.

==Etymology==
The first half of the name Tausug derives from the Tausug word &quot;tau&quot;, meaning person. The origin of the latter half of the name has been subject to debate. The term &quot;sūg&quot; is widely accepted to derive from the word meaning sea current, with the definition of the whole name supposedly meaning “people of the [sea] current”. Some scholars have noted that &quot;sūg&quot; may also stem from the word &quot;kusug&quot; meaning strong, or &quot;Sūg&quot;, the historic name for the island of Jolo.

==History==

===Pre-Islamic era===
During the 13th century, the Tausug people began migrating to present-day Zamboanga and the Sulu archipelago from their homelands in northeastern Mindanao. William Scott (1994) calls the Tausugs the descendants of the ancient Butuanons and Surigaonons from the Rajahnate of Butuan, who moved south and established a spice trading port in Sulu. Sultan Batarah Shah Tengah, who ruled in 1600, was said to have been a native of Butuan. The Butuanon-Surigaonon origin of the Tausugs is suggested by the relationship of their languages, as the Butuanon, Surigaonon and Tausug languages are all grouped under the Southern Visayan sub-family. Consequently, the Tausug language is closely related to other Southern Bisayan languages like the Butuanon language, which is still spoken in northeastern Mindanao to this day.

Prior to the establishment of the sultanate, the Tausug lived in communities called &quot;banwa&quot;. Each banwa was headed by a leader known as a &quot;panglima&quot; along with a shaman called a &quot;mangungubat&quot;. The shaman could be either a man or a woman. Each banwa was considered an independent state, like other city-states in Asia. The Tausug of the era had trade relations with neighboring Tausug banwas, the Yakan people of Basilan, and the nomadic Sama-Bajau.

The Tausug were Islamized in the 14th century and established the sultanate of Sulu in the 15th century, and eventually dominated the local Sama-Bajau people of the Sulu archipelago,

===Sultanate era===


In 1380, the Sunni Sufi scholar Karim-ul Makhdum, a Muslim missionary of the Ash&#x27;ari Aqeeda and Shafi&#x27;i madhhab, arrived in Sulu. He introduced the Islamic faith and settled in Tubig Indangan in Simunul, where he lived until his death. The pillars of a mosque he had built at Tubig-Indangan still stand. In 1390, Rajah Baguinda Ali landed at Buansa, and continued the missionary work of Makhdum. The Johore-born Arab adventurer Sayyid Abubakar Abirin arrived in 1450, and married Baguinda&#x27;s daughter, Dayang-dayang Paramisuli. After Rajah Baguinda&#x27;s death, Sayyid Abubakar became sultan, thereby introducing the sultanate as a political system (see Sultanate of Sulu). Political districts were created in Parang, Pansul, Lati, Gitung, and Luuk, each headed by a &quot;panglima&quot; or district leader. After the Sunni Sufi scholar Sayyid Abubakar&#x27;s death, the sultanate system had already become well established in Sulu. Before the coming of the Spaniards, the ethnic groups in Sulu — the Tausug, Samal, Yakan, and the Bajau – were united to varying degrees under the Sulu sultanate following the Sunni Islam, they were Ash&#x27;ari in aqeeda and Shafi&#x27;i in Madh&#x27;hab as well as practitioners of Sufism.

The political system of the sultanate was patrilineal. The sultan was the sole sovereign of the sultanate, followed by various maharajah and rajah-titled subdivisional princes. Further down the line were the numerous &quot;panglima&quot; or local chiefs, similar in function to the modern Philippine political post of the barangay captain in the barangay system.

The Sulu Archipelago was an entrepôt that attracted merchants from south China and various parts of Southeast Asia beginning in the 14th century. The name &quot;Sulu&quot; is attested in Chinese historical records as early as 1349, during the late Yuan dynasty, suggesting trade relations around this time. Trade continued into the early Ming dynasty (1368–1644), as envoys were sent in several missions to China to trade and pay tribute to the emperor. Sulu merchants often exchanged goods with Chinese Muslims, and there was also trade with Muslims who were of Arab, Persian, Malay, or Indian descent. Islamic historian Cesar Adib Majul argues that Islam was introduced to the Sulu Archipelago in the late 14th century by Chinese and Arab merchants and missionaries from Ming China. Moreover, these 7 Arab missionaries were called &quot;Lumpang Basih&quot; by the Tausug and they were Sunni Sufi Scholars from the Ba &#x27;Alawi sada of Yemen.

Around this time, a notable Arab judge,Sunni Sufi and religious scholar named Karim ul-Makhdum from Mecca arrived in Malacca. He preached Islam, particularly the Ash&#x27;ari Aqeeda and Shafi&#x27;i Madh&#x27;hab as well as the Qadiriyya Tariqa to the people, and thus many citizens, including the ruler of Malacca, converted to Islam. The Sulu leader Paduka Pahala and his sons moved to China, where he died, and Chinese Muslims brought up his sons in Dezhou, where their descendants live and have the surnames An and Wen. In 1380 AD, Karim ul-Makhdum arrived in Simunul island from Malacca, again with Arab traders. Apart from being a scholar, he operated as a trader; some see him as a Sufi missionary originating from Mecca. He preached Islam in the area, and was thus accepted by the core Muslim community. He was the second person who preached Islam in the area, following Tuan Mashā′ikha. To facilitate easy conversion of nonbelievers, he established a mosque in Tubig-Indagan, Simunul, which became the first Islamic temple to be constructed in the area, as well as the first in the Philippines. This later became known as Sheik Karimal Makdum Mosque. He died in Sulu, although the exact location of his grave is unknown. In Buansa, he was known as Tuan Sharif Awliyā On his alleged grave in Bud Agad, Jolo, an inscription reassure &quot;Mohadum Aminullah Al-Nikad&quot;. In Lugus, he is referred to as Abdurrahman. In Sibutu, he is known by his name.

The difference of beliefs on his grave location came about due to the fact that the Qadiri Shaykh Karim ul-Makhdum travelled to several islands in the Sulu Sea to preach Islam. In many places in the archipelago, he was beloved. It is said that the people of Tapul built a mosque honoring him and that they claim descent from Karim ul-Makhdum. Thus, the success of Karim ul-Makhdum of spreading Islam in Sulu threw a new light in Islamic history in the Philippines. The customs, beliefs and political laws of the people changed and customized to adopt the Islamic tradition.

Sulu abruptly stopped sending tributes to the Ming in 1424. Antonio Pigafetta, in his journals, records that the sultan of Brunei went and invaded Sulu in order subjugate the nation and retrieve the two sacred pearls Sulu pillaged from Brunei during earlier times. A sultan of Brunei, Sultan Bolkiah married a princess (&quot;dayang-dayang&quot;) of Sulu, Puteri Laila Menchanai, and they became the grandparents of the Muslim prince of Maynila, Rajah Matanda, as Manila was a Muslim city-state and vassal to Brunei before the Spanish colonized them and converted them from Islam to Christianity. Islamic Manila ended after the failed attack of Tarik Sulayman, a Muslim Kapampangan commander, in the failure of the Conspiracy of the Maharlikas, when the formerly Muslim Manila nobility attempted a secret alliance with the Japanese shogunate and Bruneiean sultanate (together with her Manila and Sulu allies) to expel the Spaniards from the Philippines. Many Tausugs and other native Muslims of Sulu Sultanate already interacted with Kapampangan and Tagalog Muslims called Luzones based in Brunei, and there were intermarriages between them. The Spanish had native allies against the former Muslims they conquered like Hindu Tondo which resisted Islam when Brunei invaded and established Manila as a Muslim city-state to supplant Hindu Tondo.

Battles and skirmishes were waged intermittently from 1578 till 1898 between the Spanish colonial government and the Moros of Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago. In 1578, an expedition sent by Governor Francisco de Sande and headed by Captain Rodriguez de Figueroa began the 300-year conflict between the Tausūgs and the Spanish authorities. In 1579, the Spanish government gave de Figueroa the sole right to colonize Mindanao. In retaliation, the Moro raided Visayan towns in Panay, Negros, and Cebu, for they knew the Spanish conscripted foot soldiers from these areas. Such Moro raids were repelled by Spanish and Visayan forces. In the early 17th century, the largest alliance, comprising Maranao, Maguindanao, Tausūg, and other Moro and Lumad groups, was formed by Sultan Kudarat or Cachil Corralat of Maguindanao, ruler of domains extending from the Davao Gulf to Dapitan on the Zamboanga peninsula. Several Spanish expeditions suffered defeat at their hands. In 1635, Captain Juan de Chaves erected a fort and established a settlement in Zamboanga. In 1637, Governor General Sebastián Hurtado de Corcuera personally led an expedition against Kudarat, and temporarily triumphed over his forces at Lamitan and Iliana Bay. On 1 January 1638, Hurtado de Corcuera, with 80 vessels and 2000 soldiers, defeated the Moro Tausūg and occupied Jolo, mainly staying inside captured Cottas. A peace treaty was forged, but Spanish sovereignty over Sulu still had not been firmly established; the Tausūg abrogated the treaty in 1646 soon after the Spaniards occupiers departed. It wasn&#x27;t until 1705 that the sultanate renounced to Spain any sovereignty it had previously asserted over south Palawan, and in 1762 it similarly relinquished its claims over Basilan. During the last quarter of the 19th century, the sultanate formally recognized Spanish sovereignty, but these areas remained partially controlled by the Spanish, with their sovereignty limited to military stations, garrisons, and pockets of civilian settlements in Zamboanga and Cotabato (the latter under the Sultanate of Maguindanao). Eventually, as a consequence of their defeat in the Spanish–American War, the Spanish had to abandon the region entirely.

In 1737, Sultan Alimud Din I, advancing his own personal interests, entered into a &quot;permanent&quot; peace treaty with Governor General F. Valdes y Tamon; and in 1746, he befriended the Jesuits sent to Jolo by King Philip. The &quot;permission&quot; of Sultan Azimuddin-I (*the first heir-apparent) allowed Catholic Jesuits to enter Jolo, but his younger brother, Raja Muda Maharajah Adinda Datu Bantilan (*the second heir-apparent) argued against this, saying that he did not want the Catholic Jesuits to disturb or dishonor Islamic faith among the Moro in Sulu. The two brothers&#x27; disagreement eventually caused Sultan Azimuddin-I to depart Jolo, first removing to Zamboanga and eventually arriving in Manila 1748. Upon his departure, his brother Raja Muda Maharajah Adinda Datu Bantilan was proclaimed sultan, taking the name Sultan Bantilan Muizzuddin.

In 1893, amid succession controversies, Amir ul Kiram became Sultan Jamalul Kiram II, the title being officially recognized by the Spanish authorities. In 1899, after the defeat of Spain in the Spanish–American War, Colonel Luis Huerta, the last governor of Sulu, relinquished his garrison to the Americans. (Orosa 1970:25–30).

In northern Borneo, most citizen families residing in Sabah are generally-recognized to have lived in the area since the time of the sultanate. Local North Borneo records indicate that during the period of British rule, a notable Bajau-Suluk warrior participated in the Mat Salleh Rebellion, participating in the conflict until his death. During the Second World War when the Japanese occupied the northern Borneo area, many Suluk people, along with ethnic Chinese emigrants, were massacred by Japanese soldiers during the Jesselton Revolt against the Japanese invasion and occupation.

The Tausug had a saying, “Mayayao pa muti in bukug ayaw in tikud-tikud”(It is preferable to see the whiteness of your bone due to wounds than whiten your heel from running away) and in magsabil “when one runs amuck and he is able tokill a nonbelie*er and in turn gets killed for it, his place in heaven is assured,”

The Tausug waged parang sabil (holy war) for their land (Lupah Sug) and religion against the United States after Bud Bagsak and Bud Dahu and during the Moro National Liberation Front&#x27;s struggle against the Philippines since 1972, with them being memorialized in tales of Parang Sabil like &quot;The Story of War in Zambo&quot; (Kissa sin Pagbunu ha Zambo about MNLF commander Ustadz Habier Malik&#x27;s 2013 attack in Zamboanga.

Some Tausug who went on parang sabil did it to redeem themselves in causes of dishonor (hiya). Tausug believe the sabils gain divine protection and can be immune to bullets while going on their suicide attacks. Tausug committed parrangsabil in 1984 at Pata island, 1974 at Jolo, 1968 at Corregidor island, 1913 at Bud Bagsak, 1911 at Bud Talipaw, 1911 and 1906 at Bud Dahu. Tausug believe that the rituals they undergo in preparation for magsasabil and parrangsabil will render them invulnerable to bulles, metal and sharp weapons and that Allah will protect them and determine their fate while using their budjak spears, barung and kalis against enemies like the Americans and Spanish.

Baker Atyani an Arab journalist, was kidnapped by the Abu Sayyaf group. On 3 February 2013 Ustaz Habir Malik led the MNLF to fight against Abu Sayyaf and demanded they released the hostages. Jolo was burned by Philippines on 7 February 1974, Spanish on 29 February 1896 &amp; 27–28 February 1851.

On 5 April 2019 MNLF member Abdul was interviewed by Elgin Glenn Salomon and said about the battle of Jolo in 1974 between the Philippines and MNLF. “They could not defeat the people of Sulu. See the Japanese, the Americans, and the Spaniards! They cannot defeat the province of Jolo. Until now, they could not defeat…. See, they (MNLF) have three guns… At the age of 12, they already have a gun. Will the soldiers continue to enter their territory? The heavy-duty soldiers would die at their (MNLF) hands.”

===Modern era===

====Philippines====

A &quot;policy of attraction&quot; was introduced, ushering in reforms to encourage Muslim integration into Philippine society. &quot;Proxy colonialism&quot; was legalized by the Public Land Act of 1919, invalidating Tausūg &quot;pusaka&quot; (inherited property) laws based on the Islamic Shariah. The act also granted the state the right to confer land ownership. It was thought that the Muslims would &quot;learn&quot; from the &quot;more advanced&quot; Christian Filipinos, and would integrate more easily into mainstream Philippine society. In February 1920, the Philippine Senate and House of Representatives passed Act No 2878, which abolished the Department of Mindanao and Sulu, and transferred its responsibilities to the Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes under the Department of the Interior. Muslim dissatisfaction grew as power shifted to the Christian Filipinos. Petitions were sent by Muslim leaders between 1921 and 1924, requesting that Mindanao and Sulu be administered directly by the United States. These petitions were not granted. Realising the futility of armed resistance, some Muslims sought to make the best of the situation. In 1934, Arolas Tulawi of Sulu, Datu Manandang Piang and Datu Blah Sinsuat of Cotabato, and Sultan Alaoya Alonto of Lanao were elected to the 1935 Constitutional Convention. In 1935, two Muslims were elected to the National Assembly.

The Tausūg in Sulu fought against the Japanese occupation of Mindanao and Sulu during World War II and eventually drove them out. The Commonwealth sought to end the privileges the Muslims had been enjoying under the earlier American administration. Muslim exemptions from some national laws, as expressed in the administrative code for Mindanao, and the Muslim right to use their traditional Islamic courts, as expressed in the Moro Board, were ended. It was unlikely that the Muslims, who have had a longer cultural history as Muslims than the Filipinos as Christians, would surrender their identity. This incident contributed to the rise of various separatist movements – the Muslim Independence Movement (MIM), Ansar El-Islam, and Union of Islamic Forces and Organizations (Che Man 1990:74–75).Founders of the Ansarul Islam were Capt.Kalingalan Caluang, Rashid Lucman, Salipada Pendatun, Domocao Alonto, Hamid Kamlian, Udtog Matalam, Atty. Macapantun Abbas Jr.In 1969, the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) was founded on the concept of a Bangsa Moro Republic by a group of educated young Muslims.The Chief Minister of Sabah by then was Tun Mustapha, he was like a brother and had good relations with Kalingalan “Apuh Inggal” Caluang. Through Tun Mustapha’s help, the first fighters of MNLF(Like Al Hussein Caluang) were trained in Sabah after staying in Luuk, Sulu(which is now Kalingalan Caluang). Nur Misuari became a part of the Ansarul Islam because of his good reputation as a UP professor. After the training of these first MNLF fighters, Yahya Caluang(Son of Kalingalan “Apuh Inggal” Caluang) was asked by Kalingalan “Apuh Inggal” Caluang to fetch the MNLF fighters in Sabah. When Yahya Caluang arrived, Nur Misuari took over and declared himself Leader of the MNLF. Nur Misuari eventually asked forgiveness to Kalingalan “Apuh Inggal” Caluang and Apuh Inggal forgive him.

In 1976, negotiations between the Philippine government and the MNLF in Tripoli resulted in the Tripoli Agreement, which provided for an autonomous region in Mindanao. Nur Misuari was invited to chair the provisional government, but he refused. The referendum was boycotted by the Muslims themselves. The talks collapsed, and fighting continued. On 1 August 1989, Republic Act 673 or the Organic Act for Mindanao, created the Autonomous Region of Mindanao, which encompasses Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi.

====Malaysia====

Most of the Tausugs in Malaysia have been living in part of Saba since the rule of the sultanate of Sulu. Some of them actually descendants of a Sulu princess (&quot;Dayang Dayang&quot;) who escaped from the Sulu sultan in the 1850s, when the sultan tried to take the princess as a wife although he already had many concubines. To differentiate themselves from the newly arrived Tausūg immigrants from the Philippines, most of them prefer to be called &quot;Suluk&quot;.

However, more recent Tausug immigrants and refugees dating back to the 1970s Moro insurgency (the majority of them illegal immigrants) often face discrimination in Sabah. After the 2013 Lahad Datu standoff, there were reports of abuses by Malaysian authorities specifically on ethnic Tausug during crackdowns in Sandakan, even on Tausūg migrants with valid papers. Approximately nine thousand Filipino Tausūg were deported from January to November 2013.

==Demographics==

The Tausug number was of 1,226,601 in the Philippines in 2010. They populate the Filipino province of Sulu as a majority, and the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Basilan, Tawi-Tawi, Palawan, Cebu and Manila as minorities. Many Filipino-Tausūgs have found work in neighboring Sabah, Malaysia as construction labourers in search of better lives. However, many of them violate the law by overstaying illegally and are sometimes involved in criminal activities. The Filipino-Tausūgs are not recognized as a native to Sabah.

The Tausugs who have already been living natively in Sabah by the time of the Sulu or Tausug sultanate have settled in much of the eastern parts, from Kudat town in the north, to Tawau in the south east. They number around 300,000 and many of them have intermarried with other ethnic groups in Sabah, especially the Bajaus. Most prefer to use the Malay-language ethnonym &quot;Suluk&quot; in their birth certificates rather than the native Tausūg to distinguish themselves from their newly arrived Filipino relatives in Sabah. Migration fueled mainly from Sabah also created a substantial Suluk community in Greater Kuala Lumpur. While in Indonesia, most of the communities mainly settled in the northern area of North Kalimantan like Nunukan and Tarakan, which lies close to their traditional realm. There are around 12,000 Tausūg in Indonesia.

===Religion===
The overwhelming majority of Tausūgs follow Islam, as Islam has been a defining aspect of native Sulu culture ever since Islam spread to the southern Philippines. They follow the traditional Sunni Shafi&#x27;i section of Islam, however they retain pre-Islamic religious practices and often practice a mix of Islam and Animism in their adat. A Christian minority exists. During the Spanish occupation, the presence of Jesuit missionaries in the Sulu Archipelago allowed for the conversion of entire families and even tribes and clans of Tausūgs, and other Sulu natives to Christianity. For example, Azim ud-Din I of Sulu, the 19th sultan of Sulu was converted to Christianity and baptized as Don Fernando de Alimuddin, however he reverted to Islam in his later life near death.

Some of the assimilated Filipino celebrities and politicians of Tausūg descent also tend to follow the Christian religion of the majority instead of the religion of their ancestors. For example, Maria Lourdes Sereno, the 24th Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines is of patrilineal Tausūg descent is a born-again Christian. Singer Sitti is of Tausūg and Samal descent (she claims to be of Mapun heritage, also native to Sulu), is also a Christian.

The Tausug used to be Hindus before converting to Islam. Najeeb Saleeby described them as still retaining Hindu practices. Saleeby said the Moros were ignorant of Islamic tenets, barely prayed or went to the mosque and their juramentados were not fueled by religion but by nationalism against the occupying enemy.

Tausug retain pre-Islamic practices in the form of folk-Islam like the pagkaja and other palipalihan, as mentioned by Samuel K. Tan, some of these practices were allowed by the majority of the Ulama like the former Grand Mufti of Region 9 and Palawan Sayyiduna Shaykh AbdulGani Yusop since the muslims in the Philippines were Ash&#x27;ari in Aqeeda, Shafi&#x27;i in Fiqh and practitioners of Sufism.

IAS/ UNOPS/UNFPA/IFAD representative Dr. P. V. Ramesh saw Professor Nur Misuari&#x27;s MNLF in General Santos City perform Ramayana during a ceasefire agreement.

==Traditional political structure==
The political structure of the Tausug is affected by the two economic divisions in the ethnic group, mainly &quot;parianon&quot; (people of the landing) and guimbahanon (hill people). Before the establishment of the sultanate of Sulu, the indigenous pre-Islamic Tausug were organized into various independent communities or community-states called &quot;banwa&quot;. When Islam arrived and the sultanate was established, the banwa was divided into districts administered by a &quot;panglima&quot; (mayor). The panglima are under the sultan (king). The people who held the stability of the community along with the sultan and the panglimas are the &quot;ruma bichura&quot; (state council advisers), &quot;datu raja muda&quot; (crown prince), &quot;datu maharaja adensuk&quot; (palace commander), &quot;datu ladladja laut&quot; (admiral), &quot;datu maharaja layla&quot; (commissioner of customs), &quot;datu amir bahar&quot; (speaker of the ruma bichara), &quot;datu tumagong&quot; (executive secretary), &quot;datu juhan&quot; (secretary of information), &quot;datu muluk bandarasa&quot; (secretary of commerce), &quot;datu sawajaan&quot; (secretary of interior), &quot;datu bandahala&quot; (secretary of finance), &quot;mamaneho&quot; (inspector general), &quot;datu sakandal&quot; (sultan&#x27;s personal envoy), &quot;datu nay&quot; (ordinance or weapon commander), &quot;wazil&quot; (prime minister). A &quot;mangungubat&quot; (curer) also has special status in the community as they are believed to have direct contact with the spiritual realm.

The community&#x27;s people is divided into three classes, which are the nobility (the sultan&#x27;s family and court), commoners (the free people), and the slaves (war captives, sold into slavery, or children of slaves).

==Languages==
The Tausug language is called &quot;Sinug&quot; with &quot;Bahasa&quot; to mean Language. The Tausug language is related to Bicolano, Tagalog and Visayan languages, being especially closely related to the Surigaonon language of the provinces Surigao del Norte, Surigao del Sur and Agusan del Sur and the Butuanon language of northeastern Mindanao specially the root Tausug words without the influence of the Arabic language, sharing many common words. The Tausūg, however, do not consider themselves as Visayan, using the term only to refer to Christian Bisayan-language speakers, given that the vast majority of Tausūgs are Muslims in contrast to its very closely related Surigaonon brothers which are predominantly Roman Catholics. Tausug is also related to the Waray-Waray language. Aside from Tagalog (which is spoken throughout the country), a number of Tausug can also speak Zamboangueño Chavacano (especially those residing in Zamboanga City), and other Visayan languages (especially Cebuano language because of the mass influx of Cebuano migrants to Mindanao); Malay in the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia; and English in both Malaysia and Philippines as second languages.

Malaysian Tausūg, descendants of residents when the Sulu Sultanate ruled the eastern part of Sabah, speak or understand the Sabahan dialect of Suluk, Malaysian language, and some English or Sinama (those who come in regular contact with the Bajau also speak Bajau dialects). By the year 2000, most of the Tausūg children in Sabah, especially in towns of the west side of Sabah, were no longer speaking Tausūg; instead they speak the Sabahan dialect of Malay and English.

Indonesian Tausūg on the other hand, are descendants of residents when the Sultanate of Bulungan, a vassal state of the Sulu Sultanate, also ruled the southeastern part of Sabah (Tawau) and the Indonesian province of North Kalimantan (northeastern portion), also speak or understand the Nunukan dialect of Suluk, Indonesian language (including colloquial variant) and as well as the regional slang. At the same time, they can also understand and speak the Suluk dialect spoken in Sabah as well as Sabah Malay.

==Cultures==
Tausūgs are superb warriors and craftsmen. They are known for the &quot;Pangalay&quot; dance (also known as &quot;Daling-Daling&quot; in Sabah), in which female dancers wear artificial elongated fingernails made from brass or silver known as &quot;janggay&quot;, and perform motions based on the Vidhyadhari (Bahasa Sūg: &quot;Bidadali&quot;) of pre-Islamic Buddhist legend. The Tausug are also well known for their &quot;pis syabit&quot;, a multi-colored woven cloth traditionally worn as a headress or accessory by men. Nowadays, the &quot;pis syabit&quot; is also worn by women and students. In 2011, the &quot;pis syabit&quot; was cited by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts as one of the intangible cultural heritage of the Philippines under the traditional craftsmanship category that the government may nominate in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists. The Tausug are additionally associated with tagonggo, a traditional type of kulingtang music.

Both cross cousin marriage and paternal parallel cousin marriage are practiced by Tausug Moro Muslims.

<text>A mortise lock (also spelled mortice lock in British English) is a lock that requires a pocket—the mortise—to be cut into the edge of the door or piece of furniture into which the lock is to be fitted. In most parts of the world, mortise locks are found on older buildings constructed before the advent of bored cylindrical locks, but they have recently become more common in commercial and upmarket residential construction in the United States. The design is widely used in domestic properties of all vintages in Europe.

==History==
Mortise locks have been used as part of door hardware systems in the US since the second quarter of the eighteenth century. In these early forms, the mortise lock mechanism was combined with a pull to open the unlocked door. Eventually, pulls were replaced by knobs.

Until the mid-nineteenth century, mortise locks were only used in the most formal rooms in the most expensive houses. Other rooms used box locks or rim locks; in contrast with embedded mortise locks, the latch itself is in a self-contained unit that is attached to the surface of the door. Rim locks have been used in the United States since the early eighteenth century.

An early example of the use of mortise locks in conjunction with rim locks within one house exists at Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s Monticello. In 1805, Jefferson wrote to his joiner listing the locks he required for his home. While closets received rim locks, Jefferson ordered 26 mortise locks for use in the principal rooms.

Depictions of available mortise lock hardware, including not only lock mechanisms themselves but also escutcheon plates and door pulls, were widely available in the early nineteenth century in trade catalogues. However, the locks were still expensive and difficult to obtain at this time. Jefferson ordered his locks from Paris. Similarly, mortise locks were used in primary rooms in 1819 at Decatur House in Washington, DC while rim locks were used in closets and other secondary spaces.
The mortise locks used at Monticello were warded locks. The term &quot;warded lock&quot; refers to the lock mechanism, while the term &quot;mortise lock&quot; refers to the bolt location. Warded locks contain a series of static obstructions, or wards, within the lock box; only a key with cutouts to match the obstructions will be able to turn freely in the lock and open the latch.

Warded locks were used in Europe throughout the medieval period and up until early 19th century. Three English locksmiths, Robert Barron, Joseph Bramah, and Jeremiah Chubb, all played a role in creating modern lever tumbler locks. Chubb&#x27;s lock was patented in 1818. Again, the term refers to the lock mechanism, so a lock can be both a mortise lock and a lever tumbler lock. In the modern lever tumbler lock, the key moves a series of levers that allow the bolt to move in the door.
The next major innovation to mortise lock mechanisms came in 1865. Linus Yale, Jr.&#x27;s pin tumbler mortise cylinder lock put not only the latch or bolt itself inside the door, but also the tumblers and the bolt mechanism. Up to this point, the lock mechanism was always on the outside of the door regardless of the bolt location. This innovation allowed keys to be shorter as they no longer had to reach all the way through a door. Pin tumbler locks are still the most common kind of mortise lock used today.

== Mechanism ==

Mortise locks may include a non-locking sprung latch operated by a door handle. Such a lock is termed a sash lock. A simpler form without a handle or latch is termed a dead lock. Dead locks are commonly used as a secure backup to a sprung non-deadlocking latch, usually a pin tumbler rim lock.

Mortise locks have historically, and still commonly do, use lever locks as a mechanism. Older mortise locks may have used warded lock mechanisms. This has led to popular confusion, as the term &quot;mortise lock&quot; was usually used in reference to lever keys in traditional European terminology. In recent years the Euro cylinder lock has become common, using a pin tumbler lock in a mortise housing.

The parts included in the typical US mortise lock installation are the lock body (the part installed &quot;inside&quot; the mortise cut-out in the door); the lock trim (which may be selected from any number of designs of doorknobs, levers, handle sets and pulls); a strike plate (or box keep), which lines and reinforces the cavity in the door jamb or frame into which the bolt fits; and the keyed cylinder which operates the locking/unlocking function of the lock body.

== Selection and installation ==
The installation of a mortise lock can be undertaken by an average homeowner with a working knowledge of basic woodworking tools and methods. Many installation specialists such as carpenters use a dedicated mortising jig which makes precise cutting of the pocket a simple operation, but the subsequent installation of the external trim can still prove problematic if the installer is inexperienced.

Although the installation of a mortise lock actually &quot;weakens&quot; the structure of the typical timber door, the embedded lock is typically stronger and more versatile than the newer bored cylindrical lock format, both in external trim, and functionality. Whereas the newer mechanism lacks the physical volume and mechanical stability required for ornate and solid-cast knobs and levers, the mortise lock can accommodate a heavier return spring and a more substantial internal mechanism. Mortise locks are available in a wide range of functional security configurations, and are widely installed in industrial, commercial, and institutional environments.

Furthermore, a typical mortise lock typically accepts a wide range of other standardized manufacturers&#x27; cylinders and accessories, allowing architectural and functional conformity with other lock hardware already on site.

Manufacturers of mortise locks in the United States include Accurate, Arrow, Baldwin, Best, Corbin Russwin, Emtek Products, Inc, Falcon, Penn, Schlage, Sargent, and Yale. Distributors such as Nostalgic Warehouse carry a wide range of decorative trim and accessories to dress up the appearance of a lock installation. Also, many European manufacturers whose products had previously been restricted to &quot;designer&quot; installations have recently gained wider acceptance and use.

<text>Maranao (; Jawi: ), sometimes spelled as Maranaw, Meranaw or Mëranaw, is an Austronesian language spoken by the Maranao people in the provinces of Lanao del Sur and Lanao del Norte and their respective cities of Marawi and Iligan located in the Philippines, as well found also in Sabah, Malaysia. It is spoken among the Moros within the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.

It is more closer to Iranun than to Maguindanao within the Danao subgroup.

==Distribution==
Maranao is spoken in the following provinces of: 

• Entire Lanao del Sur and Lanao del Norte 

• Northwestern municipalities of Maguindanao del Norte: Barira, Buldon, Parang, Matanog, Sultan Mastura, and Sultan Kudarat

• Northwestern municipalities of Cotabato: Alamada, Banisilan, Carmen, Libungan, and Pigcawayan

• Northwestern municipalities of Bukidnon:Talakag and Kalilangan

• Small parts in the coast of Zamboanga del Sur 

all of which are located within the island of Mindanao in southern Philippines.

==Writing system==
Maranao was historically written in Perso-Arabic letters called Jawi, which were known as &quot;Batang-a-Arab&quot; or &quot;Batang Arab&quot;. It is now written with Latin letters. Though there is no officially proclaimed standard orthography, Maranao is more or less written as influenced by contemporary Filipino conventions. The following are the letters used in writing out native words:

A, B, D, E, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, NG, O, P, R, S, T, U, W, Y 

In general, double vowels are pronounced separately, for example, is pronounced as .

The final sound in diphthongs and &quot;w&quot; were marked with &quot;-o&quot; in older orthographies, as in other Philippine languages, but both are nowadays spelled as &quot;w&quot;. Also, &quot;i&quot; was used in older orthographies to transcribe , which is currently spelled as &quot;Y&quot;.

&quot;H&quot; is only used for Malay loanwords, and &quot;sh&quot; (pronounced as ) is normally used for Arabic loanwords and names such as (Isaac).

&quot;Di&quot; or &quot;j&quot; are used to transcribe the sound, such as &quot;radia&quot;&quot;/&quot; (from the Sanskrit word for &#x27;king&#x27;, &quot;Rāja&quot;) or the English name &quot;John&quot;.

In representing the mid central vowel (or schwa) , different authors have employed various means to represent this sound (e.g. &quot;E&quot; or &quot;U&quot;). In social media, speakers use either of the two letters or just leave it blank (e.g. can also be spelled and on the internet). Meanwhile, the Commission on the Filipino Language recommends spelling this sound using &quot;Ë&quot; for different Philippine languages in its 2013 &quot;Ortograpiyang Pambansa&quot;.

In a revised Maranao Dictionary by McKaughan and Macaraya in 1996, the digraph &quot;&#x27;ae&quot; was introduced and used to represent the supposed presence of the vowel . However, analysis by Lobel (2009, 2013) showed that this may actually be an allophone of after hard consonants. McKaughan and Macaraya also used &quot;q&quot; for the glottal stop regardless of position. Diphthongs such as were spelled as &quot;ao, ai, oi&quot;.

The orthography used in the study by Lobel (2009) was the one developed by Aleem Abdulmajeed Ansano of Taraka (1943–2008), Senator Ahmad Domocao &quot;Domie&quot; Alonto of Ramain (1914– 2002), and Shaiekh Abdul Azis Guroalim Saromantang of Tugaya (1923–2003). In this orthography, the &quot;hard consonants&quot; are written as &quot;ph, th, kh, z&quot;.

==Phonology==
Below is the sound system of Maranao including underlying phonetic features.

===Vowels===
Maranao has four vowel phonemes that can become more close or higher when in certain environments (see hard consonants below). The vowel raising effects of hard consonants may have led earlier studies to Although previous studies have analyzed the sound as a separate phoneme (written with &quot;ae&quot;) instead of a raised allophone of .
Vowel [e] only occurs in loanwords from Spanish through Tagalog or Cebuano and from Malay.

===Consonants===
According to Lobel (2013), Maranao has the following consonants:
In Maranao, is not phonemic word-initially (similar to non-Philippine English). Hence, (&#x27;friend of mine&#x27;) is smoothly pronounced .

Since the heavy consonants developed from consonant clusters, they are only found word-medially.

Orthography-wise, &quot;r&quot; is used for , &quot;y&quot; is used for , and &quot;ng&quot; is used for 

====Fricative [h]====
According to Lobel (2013), only occurs in a few recent Malay loanwords:
* &#x27;God&#x27;
* &#x27;astrological sign&#x27;
* &#x27;in front (of God)&#x27;
Earlier Arabic loanwords with &quot;h&quot; that entered Proto-Danao or earlier Maranao were realized as &quot;k&quot;.

* &#x27;halal (anything permissible in Islam)&#x27;
* &#x27;haram (anything not permissible in Islam)&#x27;, 
* &#x27;hadji (title for a man who has made the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca)&#x27;
* &#x27;Hadith&#x27;

====Consonant elongation====
Consonants are also pronounced longer if preceded with a schwa . However, this process is not a form of gemination since consonant elongation in Maranao is not distinctive as seen in other Philippine languages such as Ilokano and Ibanag. Some of these are:
* &#x27;get off a vehicle&#x27;
* &#x27;startled; surprised&#x27;

==== Hard consonants and vowel raising ====
Since 2009, it has been proposed that previous studies on the phonology of Maranao had overlooked the presence of &quot;heavy&quot; consonants, these four &quot;heavy&quot; consonants being . Vowels that follow these consonants are raised in position.
There are four possible environments for that determine whether the vowel will be raised or not:

# Non-raising – 
# Obligatory raising – 
#* is pronounced as instead of 
# Optional raising – 
#* Evidenced by some younger speakers writing as .
# Transparent – – the raising from the consonant before it will &quot;pass through&quot; and affect the following vowel.

Similar vowel raising can be also found in Madurese.

==== Historical development ====
Consonant cluster homogenization occurred in earlier Danao and Subanon, where the articulations of the first consonant followed that of the second (Ex: *-gp- &gt; *-bp-).

A study by Allison noted that Proto-Danao *b, *d, g* were lost in modern Maranao when found before other consonants with the same place of articulation (Ex: *bp &gt; *p), but preserved elsewehere.

Lobel noted that this sound change actually resulted in two features of Maranao phonology: heavy consonants and raised vowels (* &gt; ). Aspirated consonants also developed in a similar way in Southern (Lapuyan) Subanon, but without the vowel-raising.
== Grammar ==

=== Case markers ===
In contrast to Tagalog which has three case markers (), and Iloko which has two (), Maranao has four: ().

Curiously, the is &quot;indefinite&quot; in Maranao, whereas it is definite/specific in Cebuano and Tagalog.

=== Pronouns ===
Maranao pronouns can be free or bound to the word/morpheme before it.

=== Common words ===
Below are common words found in Maranao sentences, their translations in English, Cebuano, and Tagalog, and similar words in distant Philippine languages.

<text>Maguindanaon (, Jawi: ), or Magindanawn is an Austronesian language spoken by Maguindanaon people who form majority of the population of eponymous provinces of Maguindanao del Norte and Maguindanao del Sur in the Philippines. It is also spoken by sizable minorities in different parts of Mindanao such as the cities of Zamboanga, Davao, General Santos, and Cagayan de Oro, and the provinces of North Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, South Cotabato, Sarangani, Zamboanga del Sur, Zamboanga Sibugay, Davao del Sur, Davao Occidental, Bukidnon as well as Metro Manila. As of 2020, the language is ranked to be the ninth leading language spoken at home in the Philippines with only 365,032 households still speaking the language.

==History==
The Maguindanaon language is the native language of the Maguindanaon people of the province of Maguindanao located in the west of Mindanao island in the south of the Philippines. It was the language of the Sultanate of Maguindanao, which lasted until near the end of the Spanish colonial period in the late 19th century.

The earliest works on the language by a European were carried out by Jacinto Juanmartí, a Catalan priest of the Society of Jesus who worked in the Philippines in the second half of the 19th century. Aside from a number of Christian religious works in the language, Juanmartí also published a Maguindanao–Spanish/Spanish–Maguindanao dictionary and reference grammar in 1892. Shortly after sovereignty over the Philippines was transferred from Spain to the United States in 1898 as a result of the Spanish–American War, the American administration began publishing a number of works on the language in English, such as a brief primer and vocabulary in 1903, and a translation of Juanmartí&#x27;s reference grammar into English in 1906.

A number of works about and in the language have since been published by Filipino and foreign authors.

<text>Burhanpur is a historical city in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. It is the administrative seat of Burhanpur District. It is situated on the north bank of the Tapti River and northeast of city of Mumbai , southwest of the state&#x27;s capital city of Bhopal. The city is a Municipal Corporation.

== History ==
=== Pre-Mughal period ===
Burhanpur was an important town under the Rashtrakuta Dynasty from 753–982. Excavations of the Tapti River and Asirgarh Fort have discovered many coins, goddess idols and temples from the prehistoric era. However, Burhanpur came to prominence during the medieval period.

In 1388, Malik Nasir Khan, the Faruqi dynasty Sultan of Khandesh, discovered Burhanpur, at the behest of Shaikh Zainuddin and named it after a well-known medieval Sufi saint, Burhan-ud-Din. Burhanpur became the capital of the Khandesh sultanate. Later, Miran Adil Khan II (reigned 1457–1501), another sultan of this dynasty, built a citadel and a number of palaces in Burhanpur. During his long reign, Burhanpur was transformed into a major centre for trade and textile production.

=== Under the Mughals ===
In 1601, the Mughal emperor Akbar annexed the Khandesh sultanate and Burhanpur became the capital of Khandesh subah, one of three new top-level provinces in the Mughal empire, added in 1601 (like Berar Subah in 1869 and Ahmadnagar subah in 1601–35) to the initial dozen as he conquered much of the Deccan. The town served as the residence of Khandesh&#x27;s Mughal governor, Abdul Rahim Khan-i-Khanan, during Akbar and Jahangir&#x27;s rule. He constructed a new water supply for the town, as well as several gardens. In 1609, Mughal emperor Jahangir appointed his second son Parviz to the governorship of the Mughal provinces of the Deccan, and the prince chose Burhanpur as his headquarters and his residence.
Many historical monuments survive in the area around Burhanpur, mainly dating from the rule of the great Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. Burhanpur was an important Mughal outpost. Shah Jahan spent a considerable amount of time in this town, and helped add to the Shahi Qila. The Shahi Qila is one majestic palace in Burhanpur, located to the west of the Tapti River. Diwan-i-Aam and Diwan-i-Khas were built on the terrace of the Qila. Little of it remains today, as the Qila is mostly in ruins. However, the parts of the palace that are still standing display exquisite sculpture and carvings. The main attraction at the palace is the &quot;hamam&quot; or royal bath. It was specifically built for Shah Jahan&#x27;s wife, Mumtaz Mahal so that she could enjoy a luxurious bath. It is said that she died there while giving birth to her fourteenth child. Even today, the ceiling has many intricate paintings. One of these paintings depicts a monument which is said to have been the inspiration for the Taj Mahal, her final resting place. She was initially buried there for six months before being moved. The original grave called the Aahukhana is in disrepair.

Around 1670 Daud Khan was the Subhadar (Governor) of Khandesh province, under the rule of Aurangzeb.

=== Maratha conquest ===
In the 1720s, the town was taken by the Maratha Peshwa Bajirao during his expedition to Malwa and Delhi. In the 1750s, a Maratha army under Sadashivrao Bhau, who defeated the Nizam of Hyderabad, took control of the town. At the downfall of the Maratha Empire, the town was given to Maratha Sardar Holkar, Scindia, and then finally in 1818 was handed over to the British by the Marathas.

<doc id="903561" wikidata="Q2324813" url="?curid=903561" title="State bank">
<text>In Australia and the United States, a state bank in a federated state is usually a financial institution that is chartered by the government of that state, as opposed to one regulated at the federal or national level.

In British English, the term is more or less synonymous with the term &quot;national bank&quot;, which refers to any bank owned and operated by a government or state.

==Australia==
Each Australian state formerly had a state bank, but all have since been privatised.

*New South Wales
** Government Savings Bank of New South Wales: established 1871, collapsed 1931 and taken over by Commonwealth Bank
** State Bank of New South Wales: established 1933, privatised and sold to Colonial Mutual in 1994
*Queensland
** Queensland Government Savings Bank: established 1865, taken over by Commonwealth Bank of Australia in 1920
*South Australia
** Savings Bank of South Australia: established 1848 as a private institution, nationalised in 1945, merged into the State Bank of South Australia in 1984
** State Bank of South Australia: established 1896, collapsed in 1991, subsequently privatised and rebranded as BankSA
*Tasmania
** State Savings Bank of Tasmania: established 1902, taken over by Commonwealth Bank in 1913
*Victoria
** State Bank of Victoria: established 1842, collapsed in 1991 and sold to the Commonwealth Bank
*Western Australia
** Bank of Western Australia: established 1895, privatised and sold to Bank of Scotland in 1995, now owned by Commonwealth Bank trading as Bankwest
** State Savings Bank of Western Australia: established 1863, taken over by Commonwealth Bank in 1931

==United States==
In the United States, the terms &quot;state-chartered bank&quot; or &quot;state-chartered savings bank&quot; are used in contradistinction to &quot;national bank&quot; or &quot;federal savings bank&quot;, which are technically chartered across all US states. A national bank must have &quot;National&quot; or &quot;N.A.&quot; in its corporate name, a Federal Savings Bank must have &quot;Federal&quot; or &quot;F.S.B.&quot; in its name, while a state chartered bank cannot have &quot;National&quot; or &quot;Federal&quot; in its name. All national banks and savings institutions are chartered and regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

State banks are chartered and regulated by a state agency (often called the Department of Financial Institutions) in the state in which its headquarters are located. In addition, state banks that are members of the Federal Reserve are regulated by the Federal Reserve; state banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve are regulated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Therefore, virtually every state chartered bank has both a state and federal regulator. There are a very small number of state banks that do not have FDIC insurance.

==Other countries==

Usage of the term &quot;state bank&quot; varies in other countries. It is often a national bank of some type.

In India, the State Bank of India is an Indian multinational public sector bank and financial services statutory body. It is a defined type of bank in India known as a public sector bank, and the largest bank in India. It was founded as a private commercial bank, then nationalised by the Government of India, and the product of several mergers. Meanwhile, the State Bank of Vietnam is defined as an executive department under the Government of Vietnam, being the country&#x27;s central bank that represents the government to manage functions of monetary, banking and foreign exchange operations as well as being the designated issuer of the national currency đồng.

<doc id="903571" wikidata="Q2161603" url="?curid=903571" title="Randall Flagg">
<text>Randall Flagg is a fictional character created by American author Stephen King, who has appeared in at least nine of his novels. Described as &quot;an accomplished sorcerer and a devoted servant of the Outer Dark&quot;, he has supernatural abilities involving necromancy, prophecy, and influence over animal and human behavior. His goals typically center on bringing down civilizations through destruction and conflict. He has a variety of names, usually with the initial letters &quot;R. F.&quot; but with occasional exceptions, such as Walter o&#x27;Dim and Marten Broadcloak in &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; series.

Flagg first appeared in King&#x27;s 1978 novel &quot;The Stand&quot; as a demonic figure who wreaks havoc after a plague kills most of the world population. He makes his second appearance in the 1984 novel &quot;The Eyes of the Dragon&quot; as an evil wizard trying to plunge the fictional medieval city of Delain into chaos. Flagg is a primary antagonist in King&#x27;s epic series, &quot;The Dark Tower&quot;, where he tries to keep protagonist Roland Deschain from reaching the Tower – the linchpin of existence – so he can claim it for himself and become a god. &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; expanded on Flagg&#x27;s background and motivation, linking his previous appearances. Flagg was portrayed by Jamey Sheridan in a 1994 television miniseries adaptation of &quot;The Stand&quot;, by Matthew McConaughey in a 2017 &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; film adaptation, and by Alexander Skarsgård in a 2020-21 television miniseries adaptation of &quot;The Stand&quot;. He has additionally appeared in adaptations of &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; and &quot;The Stand&quot; by Marvel Comics.

King initially cited Donald DeFreeze, primary kidnapper of Patty Hearst, as his inspiration for Flagg. Later, he attributed Flagg to an image of a man walking the roads in cowboy boots, denim jeans and a jacket, a notion which &quot;came out of nowhere&quot; when he was in college.

==Appearances==
===Poem===
==== &quot;The Dark Man&quot; ====
King first wrote the poem &quot;The Dark Man&quot; in college, about an unnamed man who rides the rails and confesses to murder and rape. The one-page poem was published in &quot;Ubris&quot; in 1969. According to King, the poem served as the genesis for Flagg.

===Novels===
====&quot;The Stand&quot;====
Randall Flagg makes his first named appearance in King&#x27;s 1978 apocalyptic novel &quot;The Stand&quot;, where he tries to construct a new civilization in the United States after a plague kills most of the population. Flagg is described as a &quot;tall man of no age&quot; in old blue jeans, denim jacket and old cowboy boots. He wears an old Boy Scout knapsack, and his jacket pockets are stuffed with pamphlets from dozens of fringe splinter groups. Flagg&#x27;s background is vague, even to him; he says that at some point he just &quot;became&quot;, although he remembers being a Marine, a Klansman, and a Viet Cong member, and having a hand in the kidnapping of Patty Hearst. In Las Vegas Flagg attracts people drawn to destruction, power and tyranny, using crucifixion, torture and other punishments on those disloyal to him. His followers reorganize society, repairing and restarting services in the city of Las Vegas, Nevada. Flagg plans to attack and destroy a rival emerging civilization—Mother Abagail&#x27;s Free Zone in Boulder, Colorado—to become the dominant society in the former United States.

After two of Flagg&#x27;s followers fail to kill the leaders of the Free Zone, the Boulder community sends a group of men to Las Vegas to stop him. The three who reach the city are taken prisoner, and Flagg orders one of them executed for his defiance. As the other two are being prepared for a public execution, one of Flagg&#x27;s most loyal followers, the Trashcan Man, arrives with a nuclear warhead salvaged from a military base. As Trash is dying of radiation poisoning, the ball of fire Flagg had summoned to kill Whitney the cook descends as a supernatural hand, detonating the warhead and annihilating Flagg, his followers, and the prisoners.

An expanded edition of &quot;The Stand&quot; was published in 1990, restoring text that had been cut from the original edition. It includes an epilogue in which Flagg appears on a beach and finds a primitive tribe ready to fall under his influence.

====&quot;The Eyes of the Dragon&quot;====
Flagg later appears in &quot;The Eyes of the Dragon&quot;, published in 1984 as an evil wizard wreaking havoc in the medieval country of Delain. He is described as a &quot;thin and stern-faced man of about 50 [years of age]&quot;, despite being much older. He hides himself under a dark cloak, and most of his magic comes from spells, potions, and poisons. He is described as a &quot;sickness&quot; which seems to reappear in Delain when there is something worth destroying. In this novel, Flagg schemes to throw the kingdom of Delain into chaos by poisoning the king and framing Prince Peter, the legitimate heir to the throne, for the crime. Peter&#x27;s naive, resentful younger brother Thomas becomes king instead; Flagg, whom he sees as his only friend, becomes his royal advisor. Due to his youth and inexperience, Thomas allows Flagg great power and is easily manipulated by the wizard. Flagg becomes the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Delain, plunging the kingdom into a Dark Age. Years later Thomas confronts Flagg about his father&#x27;s murder, which he witnessed as a child but suppressed the memory out of fear. Thomas shoots Flagg in the eye with an arrow, and Flagg disappears from the kingdom. Peter is given his rightful throne; Thomas and his butler, Dennis, leave the kingdom in search of Flagg. The novel states that Thomas and Dennis find Flagg, but the nature of their encounter is never revealed and Flagg survives to engender chaos in later stories.

====&quot;The Dark Tower&quot; series====

Flagg makes several appearances in King&#x27;s &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series (1982-2012), which follows gunslinger Roland Deschain as he travels in search of the Dark Tower. Flagg&#x27;s presence is felt in the opening sentence of the first book: &quot;The man in black fled across the desert and the gunslinger followed&quot;. In this series, Flagg assumes the guise of several individuals. He first appears as Walter o&#x27;Dim, chased across the desert by Roland. In flashbacks Flagg assumes the identity of Marten Broadcloak, a wizard who conspires with the Crimson King to cause the fall of the Dark Tower. In the original edition of the first novel Marten is a separate person from Walter, who is also not known to be Flagg, but Marten and Walter are retconned into one character in the revised version.

When Roland was young, Marten had an affair with Roland&#x27;s mother, Gabrielle, using the affair to provoke Roland to take the gunslinger test early. He hoped Roland would fail so he would be exiled but Roland passed the test. Eventually, Roland catches Walter; they have a long discussion about Roland&#x27;s destiny and the Tower which causes him to slip into delirium. He awakens to find a pile of bones in Walter&#x27;s place. In the original edition, Walter and Marten are separate characters, with Walter dying at the end of the novel. When King published an expanded edition of the novel,and Walter and Marten are portrayed as identical, and Walter fakes his own death.

Flagg appears briefly in a flashback in the second installment of the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series, &quot;The Drawing of the Three&quot;. Roland recalls seeing two men named Thomas and Dennis pursuing a man named Flagg, who was almost certainly a demon. These are implied to be the same characters from &quot;The Eyes of the Dragon&quot;. This is the first example of the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series crossing over with one of King&#x27;s other novels.

Flagg makes his next full appearance in the series&#x27; third installment, &quot;The Waste Lands&quot;. In the city of Lud, Flagg saves Tick-Tock Man Andrew Quick, an enemy of Roland&#x27;s ka-tet left for dead in an earlier confrontation. Quick becomes Flagg&#x27;s devoted servant, and Flagg assumes the name of Richard Fannin. The character returns in the fourth book, &quot;Wizard and Glass&quot;, as Marten Broadcloak. Also identifying himself as Flagg, he warns Roland and his ka-tet to abandon their quest for the Dark Tower. In flashbacks, the reader learns that Flagg as Walter o&#x27;Dim was an emissary for John Farson, one of those responsible for the destruction of Roland&#x27;s home Gilead.

The &quot;Argument&quot;, a summary of the series thus far, beginning &quot;Wolves of the Calla&quot;—the fifth novel in the series—notes that Flagg is known as Broadcloak, Fannin and John Farson, depending on the world in which he lives. In &quot;Wolves of the Calla&quot;, Flagg makes a brief appearance as Walter o&#x27;Dim when Father Callahan arrives in Roland&#x27;s world. Flagg gives Callahan Black Thirteen, a dangerous crystal ball, hoping it will kill Roland on his way to the tower. In this encounter, Flagg is described with &quot;the face of a human weasel&quot;, and &quot;the same welling red circle&quot; on his forehead as the Can-toi. His appearance in &quot;Song of Susannah&quot; is via a flashback revealing that Flagg bargained with the succubus Mia; this resulted in the birth of Mordred Deschain, son of both Roland and the Crimson King.

In &quot;The Dark Tower&quot;, Flagg indicates that he is not John Farson, but served under him until the latter&#x27;s downfall. Flagg reveals his plans to climb the Dark Tower, see the room at the top and become the god of all. Flagg believes that he can only achieve this by killing Mordred and taking his birthmark-stained foot. Although he tries to befriend Mordred and pledge allegiance to him, Mordred telepathically senses Flagg&#x27;s true motives and eats him, forcing him to rip out his eyes and tongue first.

&quot;The Dark Tower&quot; reveals more of Flagg&#x27;s background, relating that he was born Walter Padick in Delain to Sam the Miller of Eastar&#x27;d Barony. At age 13, Walter set out for a life on the road, but was raped by a fellow wanderer; author Bev Vincent hypothesized in &quot;The Road to the Dark Tower&quot; that Flagg&#x27;s later actions toward Delain in &quot;The Eyes of the Dragon&quot; may have been revenge for the abuse he suffered as a child. Resisting the temptation to crawl back home, Padick instead moves toward his destiny; he learns various forms of magic, achieving a quasi-immortality. After centuries of wreaking havoc, Flagg attracts the attention of the Crimson King, who adopts him as his emissary.

In 2012, King published a new story from &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; entitled &quot;The Wind Through the Keyhole&quot;. Here Flagg is depicted as the Covenant Man: central villain of the book&#x27;s story within a story, &quot;The Wind Through the Keyhole&quot;, a legend from Mid-World set years before the series&#x27; beginning. He is the Barony&#x27;s &quot;tax collector&quot; from Gilead, attempting to collect taxes from residents of the small town of Tree. The Covenant Man sends the story&#x27;s protagonist, a young boy named Tim, on a perilous quest through the Endless Forest to save his mother; unbeknownst to Tim, the Covenant Man is supplying him with false prophecies and misinformation as part of a cruel practical joke. However, Tim succeeds in his journey; he saves his mother after encountering the wizard Maerlyn, who has been imprisoned in the form of a &quot;tyger&quot;. While the Covenant Man is not explicitly identified as Flagg, with only the initials &quot;RF/MB&quot; in his signature as identification and at one point being referred to as &#x27;the man in the black cloak&#x27;, Stephen King confirmed in an interview with Bev Vincent for his book &quot;The Dark Tower Companion&quot; that the two are one and the same.

====&quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;====
In &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; (1999), Raymond Fiegler is identified near the novel&#x27;s end as leader of an activist group when he prevents Carol Gerber from retrieving an unexploded bomb on a college campus. King never identifies Fiegler as Flagg, but Christopher Golden and Hank Wagner suggest in &quot;The Complete Stephen King Universe&quot; that there is little doubt Fiegler is Flagg. Golden and Wagner cite evidence such as Fiegler&#x27;s ability to make himself appear &quot;dim&quot;, an ability shared by Flagg in &quot;Eyes of the Dragon&quot;, his manipulation of Carol Gerber and her activist friends and Flagg&#x27;s frequent use of aliases, usually with the initials &quot;R.F.&quot;

====&quot;Gwendy&#x27;s Button Box&quot; trilogy====
Stephen King&#x27;s novel &quot;Gwendy&#x27;s Button Box&quot;, which he co-wrote with Richard Chizmar, features a mysterious man in black named Richard Farris. Farris gives a young girl, Gwendy Peterson, a &quot;button box&quot; which, depending on the buttons or levers that are used, can dispense magical treats or cause death and destruction. Farris reappeared in &quot;Gwendy&#x27;s Magic Feather&quot; (written solely by Chizmar) and &quot;Gwendy&#x27;s Final Task&quot; (co-written by both King and Chizmar).

Chizmar was asked whether or not Richard Farris&#x27;s initials signified that he was another manifestation of Randall Flagg; his response was &quot;Maayyybee... He&#x27;s definitely mysterious, and it&#x27;s really obvious there&#x27;s more to him than meets the eye.&quot; Chizmar later revealed during a Reddit AMA session that the initials were indeed indicative of Farris being Flagg. In 2022, King stated while the character started off as Flagg that was no longer the case: &quot;I saw him as a force of evil when I first started to write about the box. By the time I realized he was a force of the White, it was too late to change the initials.&quot;

==In other media==
===Film and TV===
King was influential in deciding who would play Flagg in the 1994 television adaptation of &quot;The Stand&quot;. He felt Flagg was the best villain he had ever created, and wanted the actor playing him to be right for the part. Director Mick Garris and the studios wanted to give the role to an established star such as Christopher Walken, James Woods, Willem Dafoe or Jeff Goldblum. King himself had suggested Robert Duvall in his introduction to the novel. Miguel Ferrer, who played Flagg&#x27;s henchman in the film, was interested in playing the villain.

King&#x27;s idea for the role was someone who &quot;would make the ladies&#x27; hearts go pitty pat, that looked like the type of guy you would see on the cover of one of those sweet, savage love paperback romances&quot;. He eventually persuaded Garris to cast a lesser-known actor as Flagg; Garris ultimately chose Jamey Sheridan for the role.

Sheridan&#x27;s performance was generally well received. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Ken Tucker wrote that the best acting came from Sheridan, who gave the character a &quot;grim intensity&quot;. He commented that Sheridan had &quot;leading-man looks&quot; with the hair of a &quot;dissolute heavy metal star&quot;, making him &quot;unsettling&quot; even when not wearing makeup that makes him look like a devil. Douglas E. Winter of &quot;Fangoria&quot; magazine believed that Sheridan might have been a bit young and &quot;zany&quot; for the part, but gave a credible performance; he said that Sheridan attacked the role &quot;with the swagger of Elvis, the sway of David Koresh and as much craziness as your heart desires (and network TV allows)&quot;.

In February 2011, Warner Bros. announced plans to produce a new feature film adaptation of &quot;The Stand&quot;. King commented that he would like to see Dutch actor Rutger Hauer in the role of Flagg, but conceded that he was perhaps too old for the part. In August 2014, it was reported that Warner Bros. wanted actor Matthew McConaughey for the role.

McConaughey was confirmed to be playing Walter, Flagg&#x27;s alter-ego, in the film adaptation of &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; in 2016. Nikolaj Arcel, the film&#x27;s director and co-writer, said, &quot;Matthew is an incredible actor who can do anything. That&#x27;s how I feel about [Walter]. He could do anything.&quot; Arcel described Walter as having &quot;a very interesting way of seeing the world. He sees it with a sort of delight, even though he is obviously on the wrong side of the light-and-dark spectrum. He&#x27;s someone I&#x27;ve been having a lot of fun with.&quot; McConaughey described Walter as &quot;the Devil having a good time, getting turned on by exposing human hypocrisies wherever he finds them&quot;.

The 2016 miniseries &quot;11.22.63&quot;, based on King&#x27;s 2011 novel &quot;11/22/63&quot;, incorporates numerous references to other King stories, including an appearance by Randall Flagg, who is seen cycling through the Dallas throngs just before the assassination of John F. Kennedy in the final episode.

In 2019, Finnish actor Jasper Pääkkönen was cast as Marten Broadcloak for the pilot of Amazon Prime Video&#x27;s television adaptation of &quot;The Dark Tower&quot;, but Amazon ultimately decided not to pursue the series. In the same year, Swedish actor Alexander Skarsgård was cast as Randall Flagg in the CBS All Access miniseries adaptation of &quot;The Stand&quot;. Showrunner Taylor Elmore described Skarsgård&#x27;s Flagg with &quot;[he] is so beautiful, he is absolutely a lion-like God figure. With perfect hair and... and also, there&#x27;s a softness to Alex&#x27;s performance that I think is fascinating. Alex just plays it where you feel not only sympathy for this character, but you hopefully understand why it&#x27;s so easy for people to gravitate toward him. He&#x27;s just magnetic, he&#x27;s just absolutely fascinating to watch. He&#x27;s galvanizing as a leader.&quot;

===Comics===
Beginning in 2007, Marvel Comics released a series of comics which were a prequel to the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; novels. Randall Flagg, appearing as Marten Broadcloak and Walter o&#x27;Dim, plays a significant role in the series.

In April 2009, Marvel released a single-issue comic written by Robin Furth and illustrated by Richard Isanove entitled &quot;The Dark Tower: Sorcerer&quot;, which focused on the character of Marten Broadcloak-Walter o&#x27;Dim. &quot;Sorcerer&quot; provides an origin for the character that is different from the one King initially wrote, explaining that Walter was the son of the wizard Maerlyn and Selena, Goddess of the Black Moon. Walter was left at the home of a mill owner &quot;to learn the ways of men&quot;. At age 13, Walter burns down his adoptive father&#x27;s mill before running away to find his true father; Walter&#x27;s rape is not mentioned. Furth wrote in the comic&#x27;s afterword that the idea of Maerlyn being Walter&#x27;s father came from King.

The comic also reveals that Marten had poisoned Roland&#x27;s infant brother. Furth introduced the idea that the Bends o&#x27; the Rainbow, 13 magic spheres created by Maerlyn in the distant past, are sentient beings able to project personifications which can interact with other characters. Marten has a sexual relationship with the female personification of Maerlyn&#x27;s Grapefruit, one of the spheres. This is described as incestuous, since the beings were given life by Maerlyn, Walter&#x27;s biological father; Marten and the Grapefruit repeatedly call each other as brother and sister. The siblings also refer to the Crimson King as their &quot;cousin&quot;, indicating that Maerlyn is related to him. In her afterword, Furth says that although she conceived these ideas, King approved them.

According to the comic, Marten&#x27;s romantic feelings for Roland&#x27;s mother trigger jealousy in the Grapefruit who influences Roland to unwittingly kill his mother; in &quot;Wizard and Glass&quot;, the witch known as Rhea of the Cöos orchestrates Roland&#x27;s matricide as revenge for his killing of her pet snake. Enraged, Marten imprisons his &quot;sister&quot; in the Grapefruit and vows revenge on Roland for his involvement in his beloved&#x27;s death. Addressing inconsistencies between the novels and the comics, Furth stated that the comics exist on another level of the Tower: &quot;a spinoff world, one which is very similar to, but not exactly the same as the one where [the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; novels] take place&quot;.

On the character of Marten, Furth noted that &quot;[he] is one of the scariest characters that Stephen King has ever created. He moves from book to book, bringing chaos and anarchy with him... He is quite a demonic figure, and as such he is one of the great anti-heroes of contemporary popular fiction&quot; and that &quot;journeying into Walter&#x27;s mind is a pretty wild experience and at times a little frightening. You have to travel to very dark places.&quot; To find Walter&#x27;s voice, Furth went to John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, William Blake&#x27;s &quot;Proverbs of Hell&quot;, the Biblical Song of Solomon and the writings of Aleister Crowley for inspiration.

In his interview with Bev Vincent, Isanove opined that Walter was his favorite character to draw; &quot;Jae [Lee, the original artist for the series] established him as almost androgynous. He&#x27;s always got this bare chest, and he&#x27;s very feminine in the way he moves, with his hands raised. He&#x27;s always moving his hands around. He&#x27;s got this weird face, with a broken nose and greasy hair. He&#x27;s starting to bald, but he&#x27;s always got a very white separation in the middle of it. He&#x27;s just so greasy, he&#x27;s great to draw. And he still has to be seductive at the same time, so you can&#x27;t make him repulsive... He&#x27;s such a great character.&quot;

Marvel later released a comic book adaptation of &quot;The Stand&quot;, which began in September 2008 and ran for thirty issues. Writer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa described Flagg as &quot;The man of nightmares. Or, put another way, our nightmares given human (more or less) form. The dark side of the American Dream... King&#x27;s &#x27;Walkin&#x27; Dude&#x27; may not be the Devil, himself, as Mother Abagail says, but he comes pretty damn close...&quot; Initially, artist Mike Perkins said he felt &quot;Flagg needed to be designed less as a man—more as a force of nature. His hair will obscure his features, his face will be almost always in heavy shadow. This is the creature lurking under your bed, in your wardrobe, in your nightmares. Slightly familiar but wholly terrifying.&quot; Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa later commented on the original idea of hiding Flagg&#x27;s face: &quot;...the further into the book and the adaptation you go, the less feasible that becomes. Stephen spends so much time describing [Flagg]&#x27;s features and smiles, you need to show those things.&quot;

==Concept and creation==

King initially named Donald DeFreeze, lead kidnapper in the Patty Hearst case, as his inspiration for Randall Flagg. According to King, he remembered the Patty Hearst case when he began to write a description of DeFreeze: &quot;Donald DeFreeze is a dark man&quot;. He remembered that in photographs of the bank robbery in which Patty Hearst participated that DeFreeze was only partially visible, hidden under a large hat. What he looked like was based on guesses made by people who only saw a portion of him. This inspired King, who then wrote &quot;A dark man with no face&quot;. After reading &quot;Once in every generation the plague will fall among them&quot;, King began writing &quot;The Stand&quot; and developing the character of Randall Flagg.

In 2004, King said that Flagg had been a presence in his writing since the beginning of his career, with the idea coming to him in college. He first wrote a poem, &quot;The Dark Man&quot;, about a man who rides the rails and confesses to murder and rape; written on the back of a placemat in a college restaurant, the one-page poem was published in 1969, but the character never left King&#x27;s mind. To the author, what made Flagg interesting was &quot;the idea of the villain as somebody who was always on the outside looking in, and hated people who had good fellowship and good conversation and friends&quot;.

==Characterization and critical reception==
When Stephen King created the character of Flagg, he based him around what he believed evil represented. To King, Flagg is &quot;somebody who&#x27;s very charismatic, laughs a lot, [is] tremendously attractive to men and women both, and [is] somebody who just appeals to the worst in all of us&quot;. This idea carries over into &quot;The Stand&quot;, in which Flagg first appears as the personification of evil opposing Mother Abagail, the personification of good. Character Tom Cullen ascribes to Flagg the ability to kill animals and inflict cancer at will, referring to him as the demon Legion, while character Glen Bateman refers to him as the Lovecraftian entity Nyarlathotep, among other ancient names. King wanted Flagg to embody a &quot;gigantic evil&quot;, although he intended the character to weaken by the end of &quot;The Stand&quot;. He said, &quot;I think the Devil is probably a pretty funny guy. Flagg is like the archetype of everything that I know about real evil, going back all the way to Charles Starkweather in the &#x27;50s—he is somebody who is empty and who has to be filled with other people&#x27;s hates, fears, resentments, laughs. Flagg, Koresh, Jim Jones, Hitler—they&#x27;re all basically the same guy&quot;. Although Flagg does not explicitly represent Satan, this does not detract from what King sees as his ultimate goal. He notes that no matter who sees him or how he is seen as Flagg appears differently to different individuals, his message is the same: &quot;I know all the things that you want and I can give them to you and all you have to do is give me your soul&quot;.

Critics also note Flagg&#x27;s penchant for evil. Tony Magistrale, author of &quot;Stephen King: The Second Decade, Danse Macabre to The Dark Half&quot; sees Flagg as a Shakespearean villain, comparing him to Iago, Edmund and Richard III, contending that Flagg is an antihero. Magistrale believes that Flagg&#x27;s evil is based on his ability to replace peace with conflict and unity with destruction; although he seeks power, it is merely a resource to achieve a greater level of destruction.

Author and journalist Heidi Stringell finds Flagg &quot;an embodiment of pure evil&quot;, contending that King sees good and evil as &quot;real forces&quot;; Flagg&#x27;s embodiment of evil is confirmed by the fact that &quot;he is a killer, a maker of mischief, a liar, and a tempter&quot;. To Stringell, Flagg&#x27;s disappearance at the end of &quot;The Stand&quot; shows that &quot;evil ultimately leads nowhere&quot;. The author calls Flagg a &quot;generic hybrid&quot; of the archetypical &quot;Dark Man and the Trickster&quot;. To her, the combination of these two characteristics found in different cultural realms forces people to face their &quot;flawed humanity&quot; with the &quot;amorality&quot; Flagg represents. Jenifer Paquette, author of &quot;Respecting The Stand: A Critical Analysis of Stephen King&#x27;s Apocalyptic Novel&quot;, writes that &quot;Flagg&#x27;s horror is that he looks like an ordinary man, and his behavior is a mockery of humanity - a terrible insight into the human psyche. King suggests that the thing to fear the most is inside ourselves&quot;.

Douglas Winter, author of &quot;Fear Itself: The Horror Fiction of Stephen King&quot;, believes that Flagg epitomizes the Gothic villain—an &quot;atavistic embodiment of evil&quot;—since his appearance is indistinct, malleable and a &quot;collection of masks&quot;. Flagg symbolizes &quot;the inexplicable fear of the return of bygone powers—both technological and, as his last name intimates, sociopolitical&quot;. Like other Gothic villains, Flagg&#x27;s plans seem to fail at every turn as he seems to need to convince others of his importance. Winter asserts that Flagg is a Miltonic superman who receives his strength from a dark, mysterious source. He compares him to J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Sauron in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;: both collapse when directly confronted.

Journalist Alissa Stickler describes Flagg as a &quot;contemporary medievalist interpretation on the themes of evil, magic and the (d)evil figure&quot;. She likens Flagg to Merlin, whispering in the ear of Arthur. Stickler notes that Flagg is politically powerful in &quot;The Stand&quot; and &quot;The Eyes of the Dragon&quot;; he uses his power differently in each novel, challenging depictions of evil and witchcraft common in medieval times. She explains that there does not appear to be a higher power to which Flagg &quot;must appeal to his abilities&quot; as there is with traditional evil. Flagg is more of a &quot;humanesque evil&quot;, which works against him as much as it does for him. His supernatural knowledge is fallible, and the customary black-and-white depiction is replaced with an &quot;acceptance of a shadowy gray area&quot;. Stickler says that although Flagg appears &quot;terrifying and supernatural&quot; as depicted by King, there are no absolutes. She concludes that Flagg represents the medieval monster both past and future, which challenges and yet supports the literary Middle Ages.

Flagg&#x27;s character has its detractors. In his essay &quot;The Glass-Eyed Dragon&quot;, author L. Sprague de Camp criticizes Flagg in &quot;Eyes of the Dragon&quot;, saying that he is one of the least-believable characters in the book and too evil to be credible. According to de Camp, absolute evil is hard to envision; whereas Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin believed they were improving the world, Flagg only enjoys causing destruction and chaos. De Camp notes that Flagg fails to see that there is no advantage to his actions.
Flagg&#x27;s embodiment of evil is not the only characteristic seen by critics. Author Joseph Reino commented that the character&#x27;s presence in &quot;The Stand&quot; was &quot;Stephen King&#x27;s version of a pestilential Big Brother&quot;. Tony Magistrale revisits the character in a second book, this time comparing him to Norman Mailer. Here, Magistrale states that in &quot;The Stand&quot; Flagg gives the reader an &quot;illustration of King&#x27;s jaundiced perspective of modern America&quot; as he presents the consequences of technology—worship and the sacrifice of &quot;moral integrity to the quest for synthetic productivity&quot;.

Flagg&#x27;s background as a rape victim and its impact on his character have also been explored. Patrick McAleer, author of &quot;Inside the Dark Tower Series: Art, Evil and Intertextuality in the Stephen King Novels&quot;, argues that Flagg&#x27;s situation is the most sympathetic of all of King&#x27;s characters, and his evil may be retribution: &quot;[I]n suspending any disbelief in the possibility that reprisal is a reaction to rape, the life of Flagg becomes one that looks to strike a balance for the sexual crime committed against him. And although Flagg&#x27;s possible search for justice and balance is that which becomes imbalanced and even prejudiced, the mitigating factor here is that Flagg is not an originator of evil - he is just caught up in its web as another wronged individual seeking justice&quot;. McAleer compares Flagg to Satan in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, suggesting that he may be another &quot;fallen angel who has a valid case supporting his devilry&quot;. While agreeing that Flagg can be seen &quot;relishing in evil deeds at almost every juncture&quot;, he contends that no judgement can be made without the full story and context for his actions.

<text>Xiao Xiao (, &quot;Little Work&quot;) is an Internet Flash cartoon series by Beijing-based Chinese animator Zhu Zhiqiang (). 

The cartoon features stick figures performing choreographed fight scenes. Some of the cartoons are interactive and game-like. All cartoons are in the Adobe Flash format, with the exception of Xiao Xiao #1, which was originally in AVI format and converted to Flash format. Others have seized on &quot;Xiao Xiao&quot;″s popularity to make animations exploiting the easy-to-draw style of stick figures and minimalist backgrounds, creating cartoons that are sequels or parodies of the official cartoons.

== Etymology ==
In Mandarin Chinese; &quot;Xiao Xiao&quot; is the Chinese character for &quot;small&quot; repeated twice. Here this reduplication connotes an affectionate diminutive, an equivalent might be the English expression &quot;itty bitty&quot; or &quot;lil&#x27; old&quot;. Each &quot;Xiao Xiao&quot; cartoon is given a Chinese title with the adjective &quot;Xiao Xiao&quot; preceding a descriptive noun phrase. Xiao Xiao #1 was originally titled &quot;Xiao Xiao Zuo Pin&quot;, which translates to &quot;A Little Bit of Creative Work&quot;.

Over time, the term gradually shifted meaning from the series itself to the main character, an anonymous black stick figure.

==Legal dispute==
In June 2004, Zhu filed a lawsuit against Nike for plagiarizing his cartoon stickmen in their commercials. Nike&#x27;s representatives denied the accusations, claiming that the stickman figure lacks originality, and is public domain. Zhu eventually won the lawsuit, claiming his copyright on his style and not the stickman, and Nike was ordered to pay $36,000 to the cartoonist. Nike stated it would appeal the suit in the Beijing High People&#x27;s Court. Nike won the appeal in 2006, with the judge saying in the paper that the Nike stickman design was different than Zhu&#x27;s stickman design. After winning the suit, Nike stated &quot;This was never a commercial issue for us. It was a matter of principle.&quot;

<text>Vascular smooth muscle is the type of smooth muscle that makes up most of the walls of blood vessels.

==Structure==
Vascular smooth muscle refers to the particular type of smooth muscle found within, and composing the majority of the wall of blood vessels.

===Nerve supply===
Vascular smooth muscle is innervated primarily by the sympathetic nervous system through adrenergic receptors (adrenoceptors). The three types present are: alpha-1, alpha-2 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors|. The main endogenous agonist of these cell receptors is norepinephrine (NE).

The adrenergic receptors exert opposite physiologic effects in the vascular smooth muscle under activation:
* alpha-1 receptors. Under NE binding alpha-1 receptors cause vasoconstriction (contraction of the vascular smooth muscle cells decreasing the diameter of the vessels). These receptors are activated in response to shock or low blood pressure as a defensive reaction trying to restore the normal blood pressure. Antagonists of alpha-1 receptors (doxazosin, prazosin) cause vasodilation (a decrease in vascular smooth muscle tone with increase of vessel diameter and decrease of the blood pressure). (See also receptor antagonist)
* alpha-2 receptors. Agonists of alpha-2 receptors in the vascular smooth muscle lead to vasoconstriction. However, in clinical practice drugs applied intravenously that are agonists of alpha-2 receptors such as clonidine lead to powerful vasodilation, which causes a decrease in blood pressure by presynaptic activation of the receptors in the sympathetic ganglia. This presynaptic effect is predominant and completely overrides the vasoconstrictive effect of the alpha-2 receptors in the vascular smooth muscle. 
* beta-2 receptors. Agonism of beta-2 receptors causes vasodilation and low blood pressure (i.e. the effect is opposite of the one resulting from activation of alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptors in the vascular smooth muscle cells). Usage of beta-2 receptor agonists as hypotensive agents is less widespread due to adverse effects such as unnecessary bronchodilation in lungs and increase in blood sugar levels.

==Function==
Vascular smooth muscle contracts or relaxes to change both the volume of blood vessels and the local blood pressure, a mechanism that is responsible for the redistribution of the blood within the body to areas where it is needed (i.e. areas with temporarily enhanced oxygen consumption). Thus the main function of vascular smooth muscle tone is to regulate the caliber of the blood vessels in the body. Excessive vasoconstriction leads to high blood pressure, while excessive vasodilation as in shock leads to low blood pressure. Vascular smooth muscle cells also play important roles during development, e.g. driving osteocyte differentiation from undifferentiated precursors during osteogenesis.

Arteries have a great deal more smooth muscle within their walls than veins, thus their greater wall thickness. This is because they have to carry pumped blood away from the heart to all the organs and tissues that need the oxygenated blood. The endothelial lining of each is similar.

Excessive proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells contributes to the progression of pathological conditions, such as vascular inflammation, plaque formation, atherosclerosis, restenosis, and pulmonary hypertension. Recent studies have shown that the majority of cells within atherosclerotic plaque, the predominant cause of heart attack and stroke, are vascular smooth muscle cell derived.

<doc id="903583" wikidata="Q3113497" url="?curid=903583" title="Grand Alliance (HDTV)">
<text>The Grand Alliance (GA) was a consortium created in 1993 at the behest of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to develop the American digital television (SDTV, EDTV) and HDTV specification, with the aim of pooling the best work from different companies. It consisted of AT&amp;T Corporation, General Instrument Corporation, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Philips Consumer Electronics, David Sarnoff Research Center, Thomson Consumer Electronics, and Zenith Electronics Corporation. The Grand Alliance&#x27;s DTV system is the basis for the ATSC standard.

Recognizing that earlier proposed systems demonstrated particular strengths in the FCC&#x27;s Advisory Committee on Advanced Television Service (ACATS) testing and evaluation process, the Grand Alliance system was proposed to combine the
advantages of all of the previously proposed terrestrial digital HDTV systems. At the time of its inception, the Grand Alliance HDTV system was specified to include:
* Flexible picture formats with a header/Descriptor approach, allowing the inclusion of both 1125 and 787.5 raster formats.
* Progressive scanning and square pixel capabilities in both raster formats.
* Interlaced scanning and rectangular pixel formats.
* Video compression based on MPEG-2, with additional syntax elements that represent contributions from each previously proposed system.
* A packetized, prioritized data format, providing flexibility of services and extensibility.

Audio and transmission systems had not been decided at the time of the GA agreement. Five channel audio was specified, but a decision among the Dolby AC-3, multi-channel MUSICAM audio, and MIT &quot;AC&quot; systems had not yet been made. Candidate transmission approaches included QAM, Spectrally-Shaped QAM, 6 VSB (with trellis code) and 4/2 VSB. COFDM had been proposed by third parties, but was rejected as not being mature, and not offering fringe-area coverage equivalent to analog transmission. A thorough analysis of service area, interference characteristics, transmission robustness and system attributes would be performed to determine the &quot;best approach.&quot;

In the end, 1080, 720 and 480-line resolutions were implemented at various aspect ratios and frame rates, with progressive and interlaced scanning (the so-called &quot;18 formats&quot;), together with 8-VSB modulation and Dolby AC-3 audio. However, the selection of transmission and audio systems was not without controversy. The choice of 8-VSB was later criticised by several groups as being inferior to COFDM under conditions of multipath interference. Improvements in receiver designs would later render this apparently moot. With MUSICAM originally faltering during GA testing, the GA issued a statement finding the MPEG-2 audio system to be &quot;essentially equivalent&quot; to Dolby, but only after the Dolby selection had been made. Later, a story emerged that MIT had entered into an agreement with Dolby whereupon the university would be awarded a large sum if the MUSICAM system was rejected. Following a five-year lawsuit for breach of contract, MIT and its GA representative received a total of $30 million from Dolby, after the litigants reached a last-minute out-of-court settlement. Dolby also offered an incentive for Zenith to switch their vote (which they did), however it is unknown whether they accepted the offer.

<text>Thomas Crecquillon or Créquillon ( – probably early 1557) was a Franco-Flemish school composer of the Renaissance. While his place of birth is unknown, it was probably within the region loosely known at the time as the Low Countries, and he probably died at Béthune.

==Biography==
Very little is known about his early life. He was a priest and a member of the chapel of Emperor Charles V, but whether he was &quot;maître de chapelle&quot; or merely a singer is still a matter of dispute; the surviving documents are contradictory. Later he seems to have held positions at Dendermonde, Béthune, Leuven, and Namur. Unlike many of the composers of the Franco-Flemish school, he seems never to have left his home region for Italy or other parts of Europe. Crecquillon was retired by 1555, and most likely he died in 1557, probably a victim of the serious outbreak of the plague in Béthune that year. The location of his burial remains a mystery, and no likeness of Crecquillon is known to exist.

Crecquillon&#x27;s music was highly regarded by his contemporaries, and shows a harmonic and melodic smoothness which prefigures the culminating polyphonic style of Palestrina. He wrote twelve masses, more than 100 motets and almost 200 &quot;chansons&quot;. Stylistically he uses points of imitation, rather in the manner of Josquin des Prez, in almost all of his sacred works (the masses and motets), following the contemporary trend toward pervading imitation and polyphonic complexity. Unlike Josquin, however, Crecquillon rarely varies his texture for dramatic effect, preferring smoothness and consistency.

His secular &quot;chansons&quot;, unlike most of those by other composers of the same time, also use pervading imitation, although as is normal in a lighter form of music, they make considerable use of repetition (for example of the final phrase). Because they were imitative, it was Crecquillon&#x27;s &quot;chansons&quot; which provided some of the best models for the later development of the instrumental &quot;canzona&quot;, the instrumental form which developed directly from the &quot;chanson&quot;. Many of his &quot;chansons&quot; were arranged for instruments, especially lute.

The printers Petrus Phalesius the Elder (of Leuven) and Tielman Susato (of Antwerp) published more music by him than by any other composer, which shows the extent of his reputation at the time, though his music is not as often recorded today as is that of many of the Netherlanders working at the same time.

His name is pronounced &quot;toh-MAH krehk-kee-YON.&quot; Some historical sources spell the composer&#x27;s last name with an acute accent mark above its &quot;e&quot;, then the composer&#x27;s last name is actually pronounced &quot;krayk-kee-YON.&quot;

<text>The &quot;Dean Dozen&quot;, in American politics, was the collective term for six groups of 12 candidates endorsed by Democracy for America, the political action committee led by former Vermont governor and presidential candidate Howard Dean, in the 2004 elections.

Those chosen to be in the Dean Dozens were Democrats. Governor Dean called the Dean Dozen &quot;the progressive movement’s best chance at taking back Congress.&quot; Candidates Selected received significant promotion by progressive groups through emails, fundraisers, and speeches. Democracy for America also fundraisers for the candidates directly, using their membership of over a million citizens to seek contributions for candidates directly

They came from across the U.S. and ran for widely varying positions, from county sheriff to U.S. Senator. No incumbents were chosen, and members of Dean Dozens also tended to target key districts.

Candidates in bold won.

In the 2012 elections Governor Dean selected a new Dean Dozen to receive the endorsement of DFA.

<text>USS &quot;Sylph&quot; was a schooner in the United States Navy during the War of 1812.

Built to strengthen Commodore Isaac Chauncey&#x27;s squadron on Lake Ontario, &quot;Sylph&quot; was laid down on 26 July 1813 at Sackett&#x27;s Harbor, New York, by Henry Eckford; and launched on 18 August 1813.

==Service history==
Three days later, the new schooner reinforced Chauncey&#x27;s fleet on Lake Ontario. On the afternoon of 11 September, she began a long-range, running battle off the mouth of the Genesee River. During the three and one-half hour engagement, the American squadron suffered no casualties nor damage while the Royal Navy had a midshipman and three seamen killed and seven wounded. One of their brigs was seriously damaged before the British squadron escaped into Amherst Bay.

&quot;Sylph&quot; got into action again on the 28th when the two fleets met in York Bay. However, since she was towing a slower schooner throughout the engagement, she was unable to get close to the fleeing British ships, instead firing at them from a great distance as her contribution to the American victory.

Chauncey broke off the pursuit about mid-afternoon, lest his fleet be endangered by a threatening storm. Bad weather lasted until the evening of the 31st. On 2 October, the British fleet got underway and escaped. Chauncey hunted for the English ships and, on the afternoon of the 5th, came upon seven vessels. The American ship captured five; one other was burned by her crew to prevent capture and one managed to escape. Two of the prizes proved to be HMS &quot;Confiance&quot; and HMS &quot;Hamilton&quot;, which were the former American ships and . Thereafter, the British fleet remained in Kingston, Ontario, where they were blockaded until the end of November when cold weather closed navigation on the lake for the winter.

During the off-season, both fleets engaged in a shipbuilding race in an effort to achieve naval superiority in 1814. During this period, &quot;Sylph&quot; was rerigged as a brig, and her armament was changed to 2 × 9-pounder and 16 × 24-pounder carronades.

In the spring of 1814, the British squadron was first to venture out upon the lake. On 5 May, they captured the American base at Oswego, New York; and then proceeded to Sacketts Harbor which they blockaded until 6 June.

The American fleet got underway on 31 July and sailed up to the head of the lake where Chauncey intercepted the British brig &quot;Sir Sydney Smith&quot;. He ordered &quot;Sylph&quot; to sail into shoal water to destroy the brig but, before &quot;Sylph&quot; could do so, the British vessel&#x27;s crew ran her aground and burned her.

Chauncey then took his squadron to Kingston where he blockaded the British fleet until winter ended navigation.

The Treaty of Ghent obviated further naval operations on the Great Lakes. &quot;Sylph&quot; was laid up at Sacketts Harbor until 1823 when she was reported sunk and decayed. Her hulk was sold before 1825.

<text>Silver Springs is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Marion County of northern Florida. It is the site of Silver Springs, a group of artesian springs and a historic tourist attraction that is now part of Silver Springs State Park. The community is part of the Ocala metropolitan area. It was first listed as a CDP for the 2020 census, at which time it had a population of 2,844.

One of Florida&#x27;s first tourist attractions, the springs drew visitors even before the U.S. Civil War. Glass-bottom boats have been a popular way to see the complex. A small amusement park with various animals, a concert stage, a carousel, and exhibits also developed.

==History==

Silver Springs was founded in 1852.

Since the mid-19th century, the natural environment of Silver Springs has attracted visitors from throughout the United States. The glass-bottom boat was invented and tours of the springs began in the late 1870s. In the 1920s, W. Carl Ray and W.M. &quot;Shorty&quot; Davidson, after leasing the land from Ed Carmichael (upon whose death the springs were left to the University of Florida), developed the land around the headwaters of the Silver River into an attraction that eventually became known as Silver Springs Nature Theme Park. The attraction featured native animal exhibits, amusement rides, and 30 or 90-minute glass-bottom boat tours of the springs. The 1934 &#x27;Princess Donna&#x27; is the oldest and only remaining operational boat from this bygone era. The &quot;Princess Donna&#x27; currently operates on the Rainbow River in Dunnellon, Florida. In 2013, the State of Florida took over operations of Silver Springs and combined it with the adjacent Silver River State Park to form the new Silver Springs State Park. The T. W. Randall House on the National Register of Historic Places is located to the northeast.

Several defunct tourist attractions were once located near Silver Springs. The Western-themed Six Gun Territory theme park, which included several attractions such as the Southern Railway &amp; Six Gun narrow gauge railroad, operated from 1963 to 1984. The Wild Waters water park also existed in Silver Springs and operated from 1978 to 2016.

Silver Springs was &quot;whites only&quot; until 1967. From 1949 to 1969, African Americans were served by nearby Paradise Park, Florida, which closed when Silver Springs integrated racially.

==Cattle ranch development==
Canadian billionaire Frank Stronach has been building the Adena Springs Ranch for cattle, an abattoir, residential property development, and a thoroughbred horse farm in the area, stirring concern over plans for water use and how groundwater draw will affect the springs.

==Geography==
Silver Springs is in central Marion County and is bordered to the southwest by the city of Ocala, the county seat. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Silver Springs CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.50%, are water. The springs, in the center of the community, flow out to form the Silver River, which runs east to the Ocklawaha River.

===Transportation===
The main road through Silver Springs is State Road 40 which runs east and west from Rainbow Lakes Estates to Ormond Beach in Volusia County. State Road 326 terminates at SR 40, as does State Road 35, which becomes County Road 35 north of SR 40 before terminating at SR 326. County Roads 314 and 314A are also important north-south county roads that run west and into the Ocala National Forest.

<text>The unequal treaties were a series of agreements made between Asian countries—most notably Qing China, Tokugawa Japan and Joseon Korea—and Western countries—most notably the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy, the United States and Russia—during the 19th and early 20th centuries. They were often signed following a military defeat suffered by the Asian party, or amid military threats made by the Western party. The terms specified obligations to be borne almost exclusively by the Asian party and included provisions such as the cession of territory, payment of reparations, opening of treaty ports, relinquishment of the right to control tariffs and imports, and granting of extraterritoriality to foreign citizens.

With the rise of Chinese nationalism and anti-imperialism in the 1920s, both the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party used the concept to characterize the Chinese experience of losing sovereignty between roughly 1840 to 1950. The term &quot;unequal treaty&quot; became associated with the concept of China&#x27;s &quot;century of humiliation&quot;, especially the concessions to foreign powers and the loss of tariff autonomy through treaty ports, and continues to serve as a major impetus for the foreign policy of China today.

Japan and Korea also use the term to refer to several treaties that resulted in a reduction of their national sovereignty. Japan and China signed treaties with Korea such as the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876 and China–Korea Treaty of 1882, with each granting privileges to the former parties concerning Korea. Japan after the Meiji Restoration also began enforcing unequal treaties against China after its victory in the First Sino-Japanese War for influence over Korea as well as China&#x27;s coastal ports and territories.

==China==
In China, the term &quot;unequal treaties&quot; first came into use in the early 1920s to describe the historical treaties, still imposed on the then-Republic of China, that were signed through the period of time which the American sinologist John K. Fairbank characterized as the &quot;treaty century&quot; which began in the 1840s. The term was popularized by Sun Yat-sen.

In assessing the term&#x27;s usage in rhetorical discourse since the early 20th century, American historian Dong Wang notes that &quot;while the phrase has long been widely used, it nevertheless lacks a clear and unambiguous meaning&quot; and that there is &quot;no agreement about the actual number of treaties signed between China and foreign countries that should be counted as unequal.&quot; However, within the scope of Chinese historiographical scholarship, the phrase has typically been defined to refer to the many cases in which China was effectively forced to pay large amounts of financial reparations, open up ports for trade, cede or lease territories (such as Outer Manchuria and Outer Northwest China (including Zhetysu) to the Russian Empire, Hong Kong and Weihaiwei to the United Kingdom, Guangzhouwan to France, Kwantung Leased Territory and Taiwan to the Empire of Japan, the Jiaozhou Bay concession to the German Empire and concession territory in Tientsin, Shamian, Hankou, Shanghai etc.), and make various other concessions of sovereignty to foreign spheres of influence, following military threats.

The Chinese-American sinologist Immanuel Hsu states that the Chinese viewed the treaties they signed with Western powers and Russia as unequal &quot;because they were not negotiated by nations treating each other as equals but were imposed on China after a war, and because they encroached upon China&#x27;s sovereign rights ... which reduced her to semicolonial status&quot;.

The earliest treaty later referred to as &quot;unequal&quot; was the 1841 Convention of Chuenpi negotiations during the First Opium War. The first treaty between the Qing dynasty and the United Kingdom termed &quot;unequal&quot; was the Treaty of Nanjing in 1842.

Following Qing China&#x27;s defeat, treaties with Britain opened up five ports to foreign trade, while also allowing foreign missionaries, at least in theory, to reside within China. Foreign residents in the port cities were afforded trials by their own consular authorities rather than the Chinese legal system, a concept termed extraterritoriality. Under the treaties, the UK and the US established the British Supreme Court for China and Japan and United States Court for China in Shanghai.

The unequal treaties gave European powers jurisdiction over missions in China and some authority over Chinese Christians.

===Chinese post-World War I resentment ===
After World War I, patriotic consciousness in China focused on the treaties, which now became widely known as &quot;unequal treaties.&quot; The Nationalist Party and the Chinese Communist Party competed to convince the public that their approach would be more effective. Germany was forced to terminate its rights, the Soviet Union surrendered them, and the United States organized the Washington Conference to negotiate them.

After Chiang Kai-shek declared a new national government in 1927, the Western powers quickly offered diplomatic recognition, arousing anxiety in Japan. The new government declared to the Great Powers that China had been exploited for decades under unequal treaties, and that the time for such treaties was over, demanding they renegotiate all of them on equal terms.

===Towards the end of the unequal treaties===
After the Boxer Rebellion and the signing of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance of 1902, Germany began to reassess its policy approach towards China. In 1907 Germany suggested a trilateral German-Chinese-American agreement that never materialised. Thus China entered the new era of ending unequal treaties on March 14, 1917, when it broke off diplomatic relations with Germany, thereby terminating the concessions it had given that country, with China declaring war on Germany on August 17, 1917.

As World War I commenced, these acts voided the unequal treaty of 1861, resulting in the reinstatement of Chinese control on the concessions of Tianjin and Hankou to China. In 1919, the post-war peace negotiations failed to return the territories in Shandong, previously under German colonial control, back to the Republic of China. After it was determined that the Japanese forces occupying those territories since 1914 would be allowed to retain them under the Treaty of Versailles, the Chinese delegate Wellington Koo refused to sign the peace agreement, with China being the only conference member to boycott the signing ceremony. Widely perceived in China as a betrayal of the country&#x27;s wartime contributions by the other conference members, the domestic backlash following the failure to restore Shandong would cause the collapse of the cabinet of the Duan Qirui government and lead to the May 4th movement.

On May 20, 1921, China secured with the German-Chinese peace treaty (Deutsch-chinesischer Vertrag zur Wiederherstellung des Friedenszustandes) a diplomatic accord which was considered the first equal treaty between China and a European nation.

During the Nanjing period, the Republic of China unsuccessfully sought to negotiate an end to the unequal treaties.

Many treaties China considered unequal were repealed during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945). After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, China became an ally with the United Kingdom and the United States, which then signed treaties with China to end British and American extraterritoriality in January 1943. Significant examples outlasted World War II: treaties regarding Hong Kong remained in place until Hong Kong&#x27;s 1997 handover, though in 1969, to improve Sino-Soviet relations in the wake of military skirmishes along their border, the People&#x27;s Republic of China was forced to reconfirm the 1858 Treaty of Aigun and 1860 Treaty of Peking.

== Japan ==
Prior to the Meiji Restoration, Japan was also subject to numerous unequal treaties. When the US expeditionary fleet led by Matthew Perry reached Japan in 1854 to force open the island nation for American trade, the country was compelled to sign the Convention of Kanagawa under the threat of violence by the American warships. This event abruptly terminated Japan&#x27;s 220 years of seclusion under the Sakoku policy of 1633 under unilateral foreign pressure and consequentially, the convention has been seen in a similar light as an unequal treaty.

Another significant incident was the Tokugawa Shogunate&#x27;s capitulation to the Harris Treaty of 1858, negotiated by the eponymous U.S. envoy Townsend Harris, which, among other concessions, established a system of extraterritoriality for foreign residents. This agreement would then serve as a model for similar treaties to be further signed by Japan with other foreign Western powers in the weeks to follow, such as the Ansei Treaties.

Unequal treaties with the United States and Europe prevented Japan from unilaterally setting tariff rates on imported goods. As a result, it was hampered in developing domestic industries that could compete with imported goods.

The enforcement of these unequal treaties were a tremendous national shock for Japan&#x27;s leadership as they both curtailed Japanese sovereignty for the first time in its history and also revealed the nation&#x27;s growing weakness relative to the West through the latter&#x27;s successful imposition of such agreements upon the island nation. An objective towards the recovery of national status and strength would become an overarching priority for Japan, with the treaty&#x27;s domestic consequences being the end of the Bakufu, the 700 years of shogunate rule over Japan, and the establishment of a new imperial government.

The unequal treaties ended at various times for the countries involved and Japan&#x27;s victories in the 1894–95 First Sino-Japanese War convinced many in the West that unequal treaties could no longer be enforced on Japan as it was a great power in its own right. This view gained more recognition following the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, whereby Japan most notably defeated Russia in a massive humiliation for the latter.

== Korea ==
Korea&#x27;s first unequal treaty was not with the West, but instead with Japan. The Ganghwa Island incident in 1875 saw Japan send the warship &quot;Un&#x27;yō&quot; led by Captain Inoue Yoshika with the implied threat of military action to coerce the Korean kingdom of Joseon through the show of force. After an armed clash ensued around Ganghwa Island where the Japanese force was sent, which resulted in its victory, the incident subsequently forced Korea to open its doors to Japan by signing the Treaty of Ganghwa Island, also known as the &quot;Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876&quot;.

During this period Korea also signed treaties with Qing China and the West powers (such as the United Kingdom and the United States). In the case of Qing China, it signed the China–Korea Treaty of 1882 with Korea stipulating that Korea was a dependency of China and granted the Chinese extraterritoriality and other privileges, and in subsequent treaties China also obtained concessions in Korea, such as the Chinese concession of Incheon. However, Qing China lost its influence over Korea following the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895.

As Japanese dominance over the Korean peninsula grew in the following decades, with respect to the unequal treaties imposed upon the kingdom by the West powers, Korea&#x27;s diplomatic concessions with those states became largely null and void in 1910, when it was annexed by Japan.

In 2018, Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad criticized the terms of infrastructure projects under the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative in Malaysia, stating that &quot;China knows very well that it had to deal with unequal treaties in the past imposed upon China by Western powers. So China should be sympathetic toward us. They know we cannot afford this.&quot;

<doc id="903634" wikidata="Q669127" url="?curid=903634" title="Vagrant Records">
<text>Vagrant Records is an American record label based in California. It was founded in 1995 by Rich Egan and Jon Cohen. The label focuses on rock, but features artists in a variety of other genres including folk, soul, electronic, and pop. It is home to artists such as The 1975, Death Spells, Eels, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes, CRUISR, Active Child, PJ Harvey, School of Seven Bells, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, James Vincent McMorrow, Black Joe Lewis, Wake Owl, Blitzen Trapper, and Bombay Bicycle Club. Originally, Vagrant Records was mostly focused on emo bands such as Dashboard Confessional, Saves the Day, The Get Up Kids, Senses Fail, and Alkaline Trio. The label is considered one of the pre-eminent labels of the emo music scene.

In 2014, Vagrant was acquired by BMG Rights Management. Co-founder Jon Cohen then became BMG&#x27;s executive vice president of recorded music, until he left the company in September 2017. It remains to be distributed autonomously (outside of BMG&#x27;s main distribution partner Warner Music Group), by affiliated labels in selected countries.

==History==

The first band signed by Vagrant Records was Boxer and their album, &quot;The Hurt Process&quot;, released on May 5, 1998. The pop-punk album notably featured drummer Chris Pennie, who would go on to play with Dillinger Escape Plan and Coheed and Cambria.

===The Get Up Kids===
In 1999, Vagrant Records signed Kansas City, Missouri, band, The Get Up Kids, and the band&#x27;s Vagrant debut, &quot;Something to Write Home About&quot;, was released in September 1999. Egan and Cohen borrowed $50,000 from Cohen&#x27;s parents to fund the recording of the Get Up Kids album, derived from the mortgaging of the family house. The album was wildly successful, and single-handedly made Vagrant Records one of the top independent labels in the country.

===Rapid growth===
They signed Los Angeles punk rock trio Automatic 7 and released the band&#x27;s 2nd album &quot;Begger&#x27;s Life&quot; on July 25, 2000. They followed this by signing and releasing albums from heavyweights in the emo scene like Alkaline Trio, Saves the Day, and Dashboard Confessional. In June 2001, the label signed a distribution deal with JCOR Records, which in turn was distributed by Universal Records. It allowed Vagrant&#x27;s releases to be available in stores via Universal&#x27;s distribution methods. In March 2002, the label made a distribution deal with Festival Mushroom Records, who would handled Vagrant&#x27;s releases in Australia. Vagrant would later enter into a deal with Interscope Records. In June 2002, the label signed a deal with Motor Music, which handled distribution and promotion for Vagrant&#x27;s releases in Germany. Dashboard Confessional&#x27;s video for &quot;Screaming Infidelities&quot;, directed by Maureen Egan and Matthew Barry, earned Vagrant the MTV2 award at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards. Rich Egan is cited as saying the MTV Video Music Award win &quot;changed everything&quot; for the label.

===Paul Westerberg===
The label then went on to release solo material from The Replacements frontman, Paul Westerberg, signifying an initial departure from its roots of nineties punk and emo.

===Genre diversification===
They soon signed Eels and released their album Blinking Lights and Other Revelations. In 2005, the label acquired New York City indie label Startime International, with whom they co-released albums from The French Kicks and The Futureheads. During that time, Vagrant signed The Hold Steady and The Lemonheads.

===Poquito Records===
In 2006, Vagrant formed a children&#x27;s label imprint, Poquito Records, and released Vagrant artist The New Amsterdams&#x27; side-project The Terrible Twos&#x27; debut album &quot;If You Ever See an Owl&quot;.

===Density Records===
In April 2007, Vagrant formed another imprint label, Density Records, which will release heavier material than has traditionally been released on the label.

On August 5, 2009, Rammstein, the Berlin-based industrial metal sextet, signed a US marketing and distribution deal with Vagrant Records.

<doc id="903638" wikidata="Q554422" url="?curid=903638" title="Garth Hudson">
<text>Eric Garth Hudson (August 2, 1937 – January 21, 2025) was a Canadian multi-instrumentalist best known as the keyboardist and occasional saxophonist for the rock band The Band, for which he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994. He was a principal architect of the group&#x27;s sound and was described as &quot;the most brilliant organist in the rock world&quot; by &quot;Keyboard&quot; magazine. Hudson was the last living original member of the Band.

A master of the Lowrey organ, Hudson&#x27;s other primary instruments were piano, accordion, electronic keyboards, and saxophones (soprano, alto, tenor, baritone, bass). He was a much-in-demand and respected session musician, performing with dozens of artists, including Elton John, who has cited him as an early influence.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Hudson was born in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, on August 2, 1937. His parents, Fred James Hudson and Olive Louella Pentland, were musicians. His mother played piano and accordion and sang. His father, a farm inspector who had fought as a fighter pilot in World War I, played drums, C melody saxophone, clarinet, flute and piano. Hudson moved with his family to London, Ontario, around 1940. Starting piano lessons at an early age, Hudson also played organ at his church and his uncle&#x27;s funeral parlour, and performed country songs on the accordion. Classically trained in piano, music theory, harmony and counterpoint, Hudson wrote his first song at the age of eleven and first played professionally with dance bands in 1949, at the age of twelve. He attended Broughdale Public School and Medway High School before studying music (primarily Bach&#x27;s chorales and &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;) at the University of Western Ontario. During this period, he grew increasingly frustrated with the rigidity of the classical repertoire, leading him to drop out after a year.

In 1956, he joined London band the Silhouettes. The group relocated to the Windsor/Detroit area where work was more plentiful. It was there, in 1958, that the Silhouettes joined with fellow Londoner Paul &quot;London&quot; Hutchins and became Paul London and the Capers. Hudson primarily played saxophone in the group, and some piano in a style inspired by Johnnie Johnson, but saw his first Lowrey organ at a show in Detroit and determined that he would get one. The group found moderate success and plenty of work, recording a few songs in Toronto in 1960, changing their name to &quot;...Kapers&quot; with a &#x27;K&#x27;, recording a few more songs at Chess Studios in Chicago.

Hudson was first approached by Ronnie Hawkins and Levon Helm in the summer of 1961, after a Kapers show in London, and asked to join the Hawks, an offer he declined. The Hawks persisted, and in December 1961, Hudson agreed to join the band on two conditions: that Hawkins buy him a Lowrey organ, and that he be paid an extra $10 a week by each of the other band members to give music lessons to the other Hawks. This second condition was in part to justify the move to his parents, who he feared would think he was squandering his years of music education by playing in a rock and roll band. Discussing the thinking behind his early fears in &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;, Hudson told interviewer-director Martin Scorsese: &quot;There is a view that jazz is &#x27;evil&#x27; because it comes from evil people, but actually the greatest priests on 52nd Street and on the streets of New York City were the musicians. They were doing the greatest healing work. They knew how to punch through music that would cure and make people feel good.&quot;

When the 24-year-old Hudson joined the Hawks, the backing band for Ronnie Hawkins, the band already consisted of 21-year-old Levon Helm (drums), and 18-year-olds Robbie Robertson (guitar), Rick Danko (bass) and Richard Manuel (piano). The lineup that would become the Band was now complete.

=== Lowrey organ ===
Hudson was one of the few organ players in rock and roll and rhythm and blues to eschew a Hammond organ. Upon joining the Hawks, Hudson took the opportunity to negotiate the procurement of a new Lowrey organ as part of his compensation. The Lowrey organ offered a different mix of features, and Hudson played one with Ronnie Hawkins and the Hawks and with Bob Dylan and the Band, playing three different models: originally a Festival (FL) console, which was replaced by a Lincolnwood TSO-25 during 1969, and later still a horseshoe console H25 model, as depicted in &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;.

=== The Band: 1965–1976 ===
Under the strict supervision of Hawkins, the Hawks became an accomplished band. They split from Hawkins in 1963, recorded two singles and toured almost continually, playing in bars and clubs, usually billed as Levon and the Hawks. Hudson started work as a session musician in 1965, playing on John Hammond, Jr.&#x27;s &quot;So Many Roads&quot; along with Robertson (guitar) and Helm (drums).
In August 1965, they were introduced to Bob Dylan by manager Albert Grossman&#x27;s assistant, Mary Martin. In October, Dylan and the Hawks recorded the single &quot;Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?&quot; and, in January 1966, recorded material with Dylan for what would turn into the &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; album. Dylan recruited the band to accompany him on his controversial 1966 &quot;electric&quot; tour of the United States, Australia and Europe. (An album of Dylan&#x27;s 1966 performance with his band, &quot;The &quot;Royal Albert Hall&quot; Concert&quot;, was finally released in 1998.) Subsequent to Bob Dylan&#x27;s motorcycle accident in July 1966, the group settled in a pink house in West Saugerties, New York, near Woodstock. Dylan was a frequent visitor, and Hudson&#x27;s recordings of their collaborations resulted in &quot;The Basement Tapes&quot;.

By 1968, the group recorded its debut album, &quot;Music from Big Pink&quot;. The album was recorded in Los Angeles (at Capitol) and New York (at A&amp;R Studio). Capitol originally announced that the group would be called the Crackers, but when &quot;Music from Big Pink&quot; was released they were officially named the Band. The album includes Hudson&#x27;s organ showcase, &quot;Chest Fever&quot;, a song that in the Band&#x27;s live shows would be vastly expanded by a solo organ introduction, entitled &quot;The Genetic Method&quot;, an improvisational work that would be played differently at each performance. An example can be heard on The Band&#x27;s performance at Woodstock, in which the organ intro was an improvisation based on Bach&#x27;s Toccata and Fugue in D minor; another example can be heard on the live album &quot;Rock of Ages&quot;. Hudson was also adept at the accordion, which he played on some of the group&#x27;s recordings, such as &quot;Rockin Chair&quot;, from &quot;The Band&quot;; the traditional &quot;Ain&#x27;t No More Cane&quot;, from &quot;The Basement Tapes&quot;; Dylan&#x27;s &quot;When I Paint My Masterpiece&quot;; and Bobby Charles&#x27;s &quot;Down South in New Orleans&quot; during &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;. His saxophone solo work can be heard on such songs as &quot;Tears of Rage&quot; (from &quot;Big Pink&quot;) and &quot;Unfaithful Servant&quot; (from &quot;The Band&quot;). Hudson is credited with playing all of the brass and woodwinds on the studio version of &quot;Ophelia&quot; from the 1975 album &quot;Northern Lights - Southern Cross&quot;. This album, the first to be recorded in the Band&#x27;s Shangri-La recording studio in Malibu, California, also saw Hudson adding synthesizers to his arsenal of instruments.
Hudson provided innovative accompaniment. For example, the song &quot;Up on Cripple Creek&quot; features Hudson playing a clavinet through a wah-wah pedal to create a swampy sound reminiscent of a Jew&#x27;s harp or the croak of a frog. This clavinet–wah wah pedal configuration was later adopted by many funk musicians.

The initial iteration of the Band made its final bow as a touring band with a lavish final concert on Thanksgiving Day 1976 at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, an all-star tribute concert documented in &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;.

=== The Band reformed: 1980s–1990s ===
The Band released one more album after the Last Waltz, &quot;Islands&quot;, and then dissolved. By then, Hudson had married his singer/actress wife, Maud. He had his own property, Big Oak Basin Dude Ranch, in Malibu, which was destroyed by wildfires in 1978, after extensive renovations that included an impressive studio.

He was active during this period as a session musician, performing on movie soundtracks and albums by many other artists, including Emmylou Harris, Van Morrison (&quot;Wavelength&quot;) and Leonard Cohen (&quot;Recent Songs&quot;). He composed music for &quot;Our Lady Queen of the Angels&quot;, a multimedia show created for the Los Angeles in 1980. In the early 1980s he accompanied the Call on one of their albums and appeared with them in a music video which was played on MTV. He can be seen playing two separate keyboards in the Call&#x27;s video for &quot;The Walls Came Down&quot;.

The Band reformed in 1983, with all the original members except Robbie Robertson. Richard Manuel, who had lived at Hudson&#x27;s ranch in 1978, died by suicide in 1986. Supplemented by a rotating roster of additional musicians, the Band continued to tour, releasing three albums in the 1990s.

In 1988, Hudson recorded &quot;Feed the Birds&quot; on &quot;Stay Awake: Various Interpretations of Music from Vintage Disney Films&quot;, produced by Hal Willner.

In 1990 Hudson, playing accordion and soprano saxophone, along with bandmates Levon Helm and Rick Danko, who harmonized with the vocalists, took part in Roger Waters&#x27;s massive performance of &quot;The Wall&quot; at the Berlin Wall.

As a member of the Band, Hudson was inducted into the Juno Hall of Fame in 1989 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994. He played on various solo efforts of his bandmates Rick Danko, Levon Helm, and Robbie Robertson.

===Solo artist: 2001–2023 ===
Hudson released his first solo album, &quot;The Sea to the North&quot;, on September 11, 2001. In 2002, with his home in foreclosure and Robertson having bought out his stake in the Band, Hudson declared bankruptcy for the third time. He continued to record and perform. On July 13, 2002, he was honoured with the Canada South Blues Society&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award.

In 2002, he joined Burrito Deluxe, a quasi-reunion of country-rock group Flying Burrito Brothers. Other members included pedal steel player Sneaky Pete Kleinow, Carlton Moody of the Moody Brothers on lead vocals and guitars, bassist Jeff &quot;Stick&quot; Davis of the Amazing Rhythm Aces, and drummer Rick Lonow. The group recorded two albums, &quot;Georgia Peach&quot; and &quot;The Whole Enchilada&quot;, before Kleinow departed in 2004 because of health problems.

In 2005, Hudson formed his own 12-piece band, the Best!, with his wife, Maud on vocals. That same year, Garth and Maud Hudson released &quot;Live at the Wolf&quot;, a piano and vocal album recorded live at the Wolf Performance Hall in London, Ontario. Maud died on February 28, 2022.

On November 20, 2005, Hudson received the Hamilton Music Award for Best Instrumentalist.

He continued as a much-in-demand session player, performing with such artists as Neko Case (&quot;Fox Confessor Brings the Flood&quot; and &quot;Middle Cyclone&quot;), Chris Castle (&quot;Last Bird Home&quot;), Teddy Thompson (&quot;Separate Ways&quot;), the Secret Machines (&quot;Ten Silver Drops&quot;), the Sadies (&quot;Live 2006&quot;), the Lemonheads, Jonah Smith (2006 self-titled debut), Yesterday&#x27;s News (&quot;The Northside Hotel&quot;), Billy the Kid (&quot;The Lost Cause&quot;) and others. He contributed an original electronic score to an off-Broadway production of &quot;Dragon Slayers&quot;, written by Stanley Keyes and directed by Brad Mays in 1986 at the Union Square Theatre in New York. The production was restaged with a new cast in Los Angeles in 1990.

A few of the artists Hudson performed with in 2006 are Ronnie Hawkins, the Sadies, Neko Case, Heavy Trash, John Hiatt, the North Mississippi All-Stars, Blackie and the Rodeo Kings, and Chris Zaloom, some of these performances were recorded. Hudson and his talent on piano are prominently featured in the 2007 Daniel Lanois DVD documentary &quot;Here Is What Is.&quot;

In 2010, Hudson released &quot;Garth Hudson Presents: A Canadian Celebration of the Band&quot;. The album features Canadian artists covering songs that were recorded by the Band. Hudson plays on every track and co-produced the album with Peter J. Moore. Acts that appear on the album include Neil Young, Bruce Cockburn, Blue Rodeo, Cowboy Junkies, the Trews, Great Big Sea, Hawksley Workman, Mary Margaret O&#x27;Hara, Chantal Kreviazuk, Raine Maida and Ian Thornley.

Garth Hudson made his final public appearance on April 16, 2023, performing in Kingston, New York, in the Flower Hill House Concert No. 6, where he played Duke Ellington‘s “Sophisticated Lady”.

<doc id="903641" wikidata="Q4896982" url="?curid=903641" title="Owned (slang)">
<text>Owned is a slang word that originated in the 1990s among hackers where it referred to &quot;rooting&quot; or gaining administrative control over someone else&#x27;s computer. The term eventually spread to gamers, who used the term to mean defeat in gaming. Other variations of the word owned include own3d, 0wn3d, pwned, pwnt, POWER OWNED and pooned, terms which incorporate elements of leetspeak. 

In 2009, Newgrounds described a security vulnerability in ActiveX as leaving Windows XP and Windows 2003 Server users open to a &quot;Browse-And-Get-Owned&quot; attack.

&quot;Owned&quot; has now spread beyond computer and gaming contexts and become part of standard slang, especially in social media, and is typically used to signify severe defeat or humiliation, usually in an amusing way or through the dominance of an opposing party, in diverse contexts ranging from sports to politics (e.g. &quot;Obama owns Fox News&quot; or &quot;Trump owns CNN&quot;).

== Origins ==
The Jargon File, a historical glossary of computer slang, defines the hacker usage of &quot;owned&quot; as &quot;your condition when your machine has been cracked by a root exploit, and the attacker can do anything with it.&quot;

The term&#x27;s original usage was close to that of the traditional meaning of the word &quot;own&quot; – for instance, &quot;I owned the network at MIT&quot; indicated that the speaker had cracked the servers and had the same root-level privileges that the legitimate owner of the servers had. By 1997, &quot;owned&quot; appeared in text illicitly added to websites in website defacements.

== Usage in gaming ==
The term &quot;owned&quot; subsequently spread to gaming circles, where it was used to refer to defeat in a game. For example, if a player makes a particularly impressive kill shot or wins a match by an appreciable margin in a multiplayer video game, it is not uncommon for him or her to say &quot;owned&quot; to the loser(s), as a manifestation of victory, a taunt, or provocation. &quot;Ownage&quot; has become a modern equivalent to &quot;turkey shoot&quot;; applicable when an experienced faction predictably annihilates a beginner or disadvantaged faction. In slang form, &quot;owned&quot; can be an adjective (He is owned), &quot;owning&quot; can be a verb (He is totally owning that guy.), and &quot;ownage&quot; can be a noun.

The phrase &quot;own&quot; can not only refer to defeating one particular player or team, but it can also be used to indicate total domination of the competition. The racing video game &quot;Need for Speed: Nitro&quot; follows this definition by awarding a special bonus called &quot;Own it&quot;, in which a player earns points for every second they spend in first place, while also expressing their dominance visually to other opponents by painting every portion of the course where they lead with their tag and colors.

==Usage in politics==

In the late 2010s, the concept of ownage (specifically, &quot;owning the libs&quot;) has become a defining ethos of right-wing politics in the United States. Ben Shapiro describes the concept in the &quot;National Review&quot;: 

In other words, Republicans and conservatives may often prioritize opportunities to make Democrats and liberals feel bad, sometimes to a greater degree than actual policy achievement. Statements intended to upset liberals tend to be about topics known as culture war issues.

This pugilistic style of politics is especially popular with Donald Trump and his supporters. However, it is a controversial practice inside and outside the Republican party. For example, Nikki Haley said &quot;I know that it&#x27;s fun and that it can feel good, but step back and think about what you&#x27;re accomplishing when you do this — are you persuading anyone?&quot;

<doc id="903642" wikidata="Q7872432" url="?curid=903642" title="USS Oneida (1809)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Oneida&quot; was a brig of war in the United States Navy during the War of 1812.

Oneida was built at Oswego, New York 1808–1809, under contract awarded by her first commanding officer, Lieutenant M. T. Woolsey, to Henry Eckford and Christian Bergh. Although her displacement was 243 tons by carpenter&#x27;s measurement, her draft could compare with a sloop of 80 tons. This enabled her to enter the rivers feeding Lake Ontario without fear of grounding. She was delivered by the contractors in the spring of 1809, but was not equipped and sent upon the lake until the fall of 1810.

==War of 1812==
&quot;Oneida&quot; operated principally from Sackets Harbor, New York, not far from the commencement of the St. Lawrence, while the British port of Kingston lay nearly opposite in Canada.

===First Battle of Sacket&#x27;s Harbor===

On 5 June 1812, &quot;Oneida&quot; captured the British schooner &quot;Lord Nelson&quot;, while enforcing the Embargo Act of 1807. On 19 July, the British squadron sailed on Sackets Harbor where &quot;Oneida&quot; and her prize were anchored. After failing to gain the open lake, &quot;Oneida&quot; anchored again near a bank in a position to rake the harbor entrance. She mounted the guns from her off side ashore and presented a full battery. After an exchange of cannonade, of two hours duration, the British squadron broke off the engagement and sailed for Kingston, Canada.

===USS &quot;Oneida&quot; vs HMS &quot;Royal George&quot;===

On 8 November, &quot;Oneida&quot;, flying the broad pennant of Commodore Isaac Chauncey, sailed from Sackets Harbor to intercept British ships conveying supplies to the Army at Kingston. The sloop was sighted and chased into the Bay of Quinte and lost sight of during the night. Sighted again the following morning, the chase was resumed. &quot;Oneida&quot; brought up the rear of the squadron to allow the heavy guns of her schooners to open way for a close attack. &quot;Royal George&quot; cut her mooring cables and attempted to make further headway up the channel, finally making fast to a wharf under the protection of troop muskets. &quot;Royal George&quot; suffered extensive damage, and &quot;Oneida&quot; had some damage aloft with one seaman killed and three wounded, but a gale ended the engagement and the Americans returned to Sackets Harbor.

==Battle of York==

On 25 April 1813, along with other ships of the American squadron, &quot;Oneida&quot; set sail from Sackets Harbor and arrived off York, Canada (now Toronto) on 27 April with troops under General Zebulon Pike embarked. Boats were hoisted out and within two hours the brigade was ashore, soon capturing York despite the loss of General Pike. On the night of 26 May she again embarked troops and artillery and set sail with the squadron for Fort George, Canada. A landing was made about 9 a.m. on 27 May, and by noon the town and fort were taken.

&quot;Oneida&quot; made a second unopposed landing at York on 27 July liberating prisoners and seizing provisions. On 31 July 1814, &quot;Oneida&quot; made for the Niagara River to blockade British ships anchored there. She was assisted by the brig and the schooner , while the remainder of the American Squadron blockaded Kingston. The blockade was lifted in September 1814, and &quot;Oneida&quot; returned to Sackets Harbor. Ice closed the lake in November, and peace was declared the following month.

===Postwar===

&quot;Oneida&quot; was sold 15 May 1815, but afterwards was repurchased by the Navy, laid up at Sackets Harbor, and finally sold in 1825 to a timber company in the village of Clayton, New York.

&quot;Oneida&quot; worked as a timber ship for several years before sinking in French Creek Bay near Clayton sometime in the 1830s. One of the ship&#x27;s cannons is currently in Clayton&#x27;s Memorial Park, while one of its anchors is in the possession of French Creek Bay Marina.

<doc id="903645" wikidata="Q4883507" url="?curid=903645" title="Bellarmine College Preparatory">
<text>Bellarmine College Preparatory is an all-boys, Jesuit, private secondary school located in San Jose, California. Founded on May 8, 1851, it is the oldest Jesuit secondary school in California and the second-oldest west of the Mississippi River.

==Overview== 

A Roman Catholic school in the tradition of Saint Ignatius of Loyola, Bellarmine is a member of the West Catholic Athletic League, the Jesuit Schools Network, and the Western Association of Schools and Colleges.

As of 2021, Bellarmine led the CIF Central Coast Section with 140 Division 1 titles. Bellarmine&#x27;s Speech and Debate Team was ranked in the top 10 programs in the country with its policy debate team ranked #1 after winning the triple crown (NDCA Championship, Tournament of Champions (debate) and NDSA Nationals) in 2021. In addition, the school&#x27;s FIRST Robotics Competition team, Team 254: The Cheesy Poofs, has been the World Champion (2011, 2014, 2017, 2018, 2022) for 4 of the past 10 years. The school&#x27;s publications include its student newspaper, &quot;The Bell Online&quot;, and its yearbook, &quot;The Carillon&quot;.

The school is reputed for its graduates’ contributions and powerful influence in the Bay Area. Bellarmine&#x27;s list of notable alumni includes 4 Olympians (six Gold Medals combined), 2 living Billionaires, 3 Mayors of San Jose, the former team owners of the San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics, 3 World Series Champions, 5 Super Bowl Champions, 1 Academy-Award Winner, 1 Pulitzer Prize Winner, 28 Professional MLB athletes, numerous award-winning authors and several state politicians. Previous Bellarmine alumni have won prestigious postgraduate scholarships including the Rhodes Scholarship, Marshall Scholarship, Schwarzman Scholarship, MacArthur Fellowship, and the Fulbright Awards.

==History==

Bellarmine was founded in 1851 by Fr. John Nobili, S.J., and his companions, as Santa Clara College, a school for secondary and college-age students. In 1912, the college was separated into 2 schools - Santa Clara University and Santa Clara Prep. After sharing the same campus for thirteen years, the secondary school moved to its current College Park Campus after purchasing the land from the University of the Pacific (then known as the College of the Pacific) for $77,500. In 1926, the renovated school opened its doors to a student body of 200 registered students.

In 2011, the Lorry I. Lokey Academic Center was completed after a $15 million gift from the family of the philanthropist and founder of Business Wire. This was the single largest gift in the school&#x27;s history. The new center houses over 27 classrooms, a faculty lounge and the Craft-Malcolm Family Academic Resource Center.

The College Park Caltrain station is adjacent to the campus since its inception and has been a historic presence for Bellarmine&#x27;s metropolitan community. Over 140 students take the train to school every day from San Mateo county to Gilroy. The station is served by only 4 trains a day, timed to correspond with the school&#x27;s hours. In recent years, amidst discussion of the station shutting down, the school has lobbied Caltrain to avoid cutting service to the station.

==Academics== 

As of 2020, Bellarmine&#x27;s current enrollment size is approximately 1,655 students. 
The average class size is 22.5 and the student-to-teacher ratio is 13:1. For the Class of 2019, 99.2% of students went on to attend college. 94.7% of graduating seniors were attending a four-year institution. 

=== Football ===
The Bells Football team represents Bellarmine College Preparatory in the West Catholic Athletic League (WCAL) of the CIF Central Coast Section. The team has 20 WCAL Titles and 8 CCS Championships in program history. The Bell&#x27;s Football team is currently headed by former San Diego Chargers coach and 2-time Super Bowl Champion with the Denver Broncos David Diaz-Infante. He took over from Bellarmine alum Jalal Beauchman who led the Bells to a NorCal Championship in 2022. In 1965, the John Hanna-coached Bells outscored opponents 310–6 during a 31-game winning streak to earn the first of two state titles (the other was in 1981).

=== Soccer ===
The Bellarmine Soccer team is noted for the league&#x27;s longest winning streak of 17 consecutive titles under Coach Patrick Lowney. The Bellarmine&#x27;s 2002 varsity soccer team had a perfect 25-0-0 season. As of 2021, the soccer team coached by Conor Salcido &#x27;07 has won 3 of the past 5 CCS Open Division titles, a NorCal CIF Division 1 Title, and finished the 2021 season ranked #4 in the nation by Top Drawer Soccer and CBS Sports.

==Co-Curricular Programs==

===Robotics===
The Robotics Team, named The Cheesy Poofs, has over 100 members. The high school competes in two different divisions: FTC and FRC. The team has won the World Chairman&#x27;s Award (the highest award in FIRST) in 2004, and the World Championships 5 times (the most of any FIRST team) in 2011, 2014, 2017, 2018, and 2022. The team also holds the record for most regional events won, having 44 regional wins to their name. In 2008, Bellarmine first entered VEX Robotics and in 2009–2010 won 16 regional competitions, 7 of them in international competition. In the 2010–2011 season, Bellarmine&#x27;s VEX team 254A won the VEX World Excellence Award, the highest it confers. In 2014, the team won three regionals, the Curie Division, and World Championships. The school shares a partnership with NASA&#x27;s Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California. In 2022, Bellarmine&#x27;s Team 254F won the VEX World Championships in Dallas Texas.

===Student media &amp; publications===
In 2008, Bellarmine began its own radio station, KBCP The Bell, as a legal, unlicensed station at 1650 AM which reaches a 1-mile radius of the school. Programs include 30-minute newscasts, sports shows, daily music shows, and political talk radio. 

===Speech and debate===

In 1994, Bellarmine won the team speech and debate National Forensic League Championship in Kansas City, Missouri. In 2003 and 2004, the team won the California State Championship, then came in second in the state in 2005 when it was ranked as one of the top two teams in the nation.

<text>Jackie Marie Stiles (born December 21, 1978) is an American college basketball coach who was formerly an assistant coach for the University of Oklahoma women&#x27;s basketball team and at Missouri State University. Stiles set several scoring records while playing shooting guard in college and was inducted into the Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016.

==High school==
Born in Kansas City, Kansas and raised in Claflin, Stiles played for Claflin High School, where she was named a WBCA All-American. She participated in the WBCA High School All-America Game where she scored eighteen points and earned MVP honors.

Stiles won 14 individual state titles in track and field, a state record that still stands.

==College==
Stiles played college basketball at Southwest Missouri State University (now Missouri State University) from 1997 to 2001. While there, she became the first NCAA Division I women&#x27;s player to score more than 1,000 points in a season, scoring 1,062 in her senior year. That year, she won the Wade Trophy, which honors the best women&#x27;s basketball player in the college ranks, as well as the Broderick Cup, which honors the Collegiate Woman Athlete of the Year. She competed with USA Basketball as a member of the 2000 Jones Cup Team that won the gold in Taipei, Taiwan.

During her four collegiate years, Stiles scored 3,393 points, a career total that stood as a record for Division I women&#x27;s basketball until it was broken by Kelsey Plum in 2017. On March 10, 2000, she scored 56 points against Evansville, which stands as the sixth highest number of points in a single Division I game. In her senior season, Stiles scored 41 points to help fifth seed Missouri State upset top seed Duke in the 2001 Sweet 16.

==USA Basketball==
Stiles was named to the USA Basketball Women&#x27;s Junior National Team (now called the U18 team). The team participated in the third Junior World Championship, held in Chetumal, Mexico in late August and early September 1996. The USA team won their early games easily, but lost by four points to the team from Brazil, ending up with the silver medal for the event.

Stiles was named to the USA Basketball Women&#x27;s Junior National Team when it was invited to the 1997 FIBA Junior World Championship (now called U19) held in Natal, Brazil. After beating Japan, the next game was against Australia, the defending champion. The USA team pulled out to a 13-point lead in the second half, but gave up the lead and lost the game 80–74. The USA rebounded with a close 92–88 victory over Cuba, helped by 23 points each from Maylana Martin and Lynn Pride. The USA then went on to beat previously unbeaten Russia. After winning the next two games, the USA faced Australia in the gold medal game. The USA team has a three-point lead late, but the Aussies hit a three-pointer with three seconds left in regulation to force overtime. Although the Aussies scored first, the USA team came back, then pulled into the lead and held on to win 78–74 to earn the gold, and the first medal for a USA team at a Junior World Championship. Stiles averaged 1.0 point per game.

Stiles was named to the team representing the US in 2000 at the William Jones Cup competition in Taipei, Taiwan. The USA team started strong with a 32-point win over the host team, the Republic of China National Team. They then beat South Korea easily and faced Japan in the third game. Japan started out strongly, and had an 18-point lead in the first half. The USA then out scored Japan 23–3 to take a small lead at the half. The USA built a ten-point lead, but Japan cut it back to three with under a minute to go. Kelly Schumacher grabbed an offensive rebound and scored to bring the lead back to five points and the team held on for the win. The USA team beat Japan 83–80. The final game was against Malaysia, but it wasn&#x27;t close, with the USA winning 79–24, to secure a 4–0 record for the competition and the gold medal. Stiles averaged 6.8 points per game.

==Professional playing career==
Stiles&#x27; pro career started promisingly. In the 2001 WNBA draft, she was selected fourth overall by the Portland Fire, and was later voted the Rookie of the Year. Later in her WNBA career, Stiles suffered numerous injuries, including 13 surgeries.

After the Fire folded in 2002, Stiles was selected 14th by the Los Angeles Sparks, but did not play that season, spending rehabilitation time for her injuries.

In 2004, Stiles signed with the Lubbock Hawks (in Lubbock, Texas) of the National Women&#x27;s Basketball League (NWBL). After a season, Stiles took on competitive cycling.

In 2006, Stiles played briefly for the Canberra Capitals of the Women&#x27;s National Basketball League in Australia before retiring due to injury.

After retiring from playing professional basketball, Stiles founded J. Stiles Total Training in 2007.

==Coaching career==
In August, 2012, she accepted a women&#x27;s basketball assistant coach position with Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, California. On April 18, 2013, it was announced that Stiles would be returning to her alma mater as assistant coach for the Lady Bears women&#x27;s basketball team. On April 24, 2019, it was announced that Stiles was hired as an assistant coach for the University of Oklahoma&#x27;s women&#x27;s basketball team. Stiles was hired at Tulsa in late April 2021 joining new Golden Hurricane head coach Angie Nelp&#x27;s inaugural staff. It was reported on June 21, 2021 that Stiles stepped down from the Tulsa staff.

==Awards and honors==
Stiles was the 2001 winner of the Wade Trophy, Honda Sports Award for basketball, and the overall Honda-Broderick Cup winner for all sports.

She was one of 11 honorees inducted into the Kansas Sports Hall of Fame in the Class of 2007. She was also inducted into the Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame (Class of 2016) on June 11, 2016.

<doc id="903655" wikidata="Q186053" url="?curid=903655" title="HD 209458">
<text>HD 209458 is a star with an orbiting exoplanet in the constellation Pegasus. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 7.65 and an absolute magnitude of 4.28. Because it is located at a distance of from the Sun as measured via parallax, it is not visible to the unaided eye. With good binoculars or a small telescope it should be easily detectable. The system is drifting closer with a heliocentric radial velocity of −14.8 km/s.

The spectrum of HD 209458 presents as a late F- or early G-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of F9 V or G0 V, respectively. It is roughly 3.5 billion years old and is spinning with a projected rotational velocity of 4.2 km/s. The star displays a moderate amount of magnetic activity in its chromosphere. It has a 15% greater mass than the Sun and a 20% larger radius. The abundance of iron, a measure of the metallicity of the star, is solar. HD 209458 is radiating 1.8 times the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 6,071 K.

Because the planet transits the star, the star is dimmed by about 2% every 3.5 days making it an extrinsic variable. The variable star designation for HD 209458 is V376 Pegasi. It is the prototype of the variable class &quot;EP&quot; in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars, defined as stars showing eclipses by their planets.

==Planetary system==

In 1999, two teams working independently (one team consisted of astronomers at the Geneva Observatory, the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian, and the Wise Observatory; the second group was the California and Carnegie Planet Search team) discovered an extrasolar planet orbiting the star by using the radial velocity planet search method. Soon after the discovery, separate teams led by David Charbonneau and Gregory W. Henry were able to detect a transit of the planet across the surface of the star making it the first known transiting extrasolar planet. The planet received the designation HD 209458 b.

The planet is now under even more public scrutiny with the announcement that its atmosphere contains water vapor. Astronomers had made careful photometric measurements of several stars known to be orbited by planets, in the hope that they might observe a dip in brightness caused by the transit of the planet across the star&#x27;s face. This would require the planet&#x27;s orbit to be inclined such that it would pass between the Earth and the star, and previously no transits had been detected.

Travis Barman at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona analyzed the emission spectrum of this planet in 2007, and believes that its atmosphere contains water vapor, although previous research in 2007 suggests that the atmosphere is composed mostly of silicate clouds. A spectrum taken in 2020 detected either sodium or titanium oxide in the planet&#x27;s atmosphere. A later study in 2021 did not find any molecular absorption features in the planetary atmosphere at all.

<text>Rohilkhand (today Bareilly, Moradabad, Badaun and Rampur; ) is a region in the northwestern part of Uttar Pradesh, India, that is centered on the Bareilly and Moradabad divisions. It is part of the upper Ganges Plain, and is named after the Rohilla. The region was called Madhyadesh and Panchala in the Sanskrit epics &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and &quot;Ramayana&quot;. During the colonial era in India, the region was governed by the Royal House of Rampur.

==Etymology==
&quot;Rohilkhand&quot; means &quot;the land of the Rohilla&quot;. The term &quot;Rohilla&quot; first became common in the 17th century, with &quot;Rohilla&quot; used to refer to the people coming from the land of Roh which is a corruption of &quot;Koh&quot; meaning mountains (i.e. Kohistan in Persian), which was originally a geographical term that corresponded with the territory from Swat and Bajaur in the north to Sibi in the south, and from Hasan Abdal (Attock) in the east to Kabul and Kandahar in the west. A majority of the Rohillas migrated from Pashtunistan to North India between the 17th and 18th centuries.

== Geography ==
Rohilkhand lies on the upper Ganges alluvial plain and has an area of about (in and around the Bareilly and Moradabad divisions).

The Ganges Doab to the south and west, Kumaon to the north, Nepal to the east, and the Awadh region to the southeast mark its borders.

== History ==
The Rohilla Afghan leader Daud Khan led the settlement in the Katehar region in northern India under orders of the Mogul emperor Aurangzeb (ruled 1658–1707) to suppress the Katheria Rajput uprisings. Rajput&#x27;s first king was Raja Ram Singh Katheria. These katheriya Rajputs contained 18 clans of Rajput Vansh, including the Chauhan, Rathore, Gehlot, Sisodia, Nikumbh, and Pundir. Originally, some 20,000 soldiers from various Pashtun tribes (Yusafzai, Ghori, Osmani, Ghilzai, Barech, Marwat, Tareen, Kakar, Naghar, Afridi and Khattak) were hired as soldiers by the Mughals. Aurangzeb was impressed with their performance and an additional force of 25,000 Pashtuns was recruited from modern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Afghanistan and were given respected positions in the Mogul Army. Most Pashtuns settled in the Katehar region and brought their families from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Afghanistan. During Nadir Shah&#x27;s invasion of northern India in 1739, led by the general Ahmed Shah Abdali, a new wave of Pashtuns increased the population to over 1,000,000. Due to the large settlement of Rohilla Afghans, the Katehar region became known as Rohilkhand. Bareilly was made the capital of the Rohilkhand state and it became Pashtun majority city with Gali Nawaban as the main royal street. Other important cities were Moradabad, Rampur, Shahjahanpur, and Badaun.

In 1752, the Maratha were asked by Safdarjung, the Nawab of Oudh, to help him defeat Pashtun Rohilla. The Maratha forces and Awadh forces besieged the Rohillas, who had sought refuge in Kumaon, but had to retreat when Ahmad Shah Abdali invaded India.

After the Third Battle of Panipat, thousands of Pashtun and Baloch soldiers settled in northern India. These diverse ethnic, cultural, and linguistic groups merged over time to form the Urdu-speaking Muslims of South Asia.

During the Capture of Delhi (1771), Marathas defeated Rohilla chieftain Zabita Khan. After taking control of Delhi, the Marathas sent a large army in 1772 to punish Afghan Rohillas for their involvement in Panipat. They desecrated the grave of Rohilla chieftan Najib ad-Dawla and captured Najibabad. With the fleeing of the Rohillas, the rest of the country was burnt, with the exception of the city of Amroha, which was defended by some thousands of Amrohi Sayyid tribes. The Rohillas who could offer no resistance fled to the Terai region. Though the Marathas left Rohilkhand hastily due to the arrival of the monsoon, which was difficult for their armies, their threat forced the Rohillas to seek an alliance with the Nawabs of Awadh.

In the presence of Robert Barker, the commander of the British East India company troops at Awadh, a treaty was signed between Nawab Shuja-ud-Daula and Hafiz Rahmat Khan on 15th June 1772, which ensured the safety of Rohilkhand by Awadh and its British allies from the Marathas in exchange for Rs 40 lakh. The families of the Rohilla chiefs imprisoned by the Marathas were also released, through the intervention of the Nawab.

In 1773, the Marathas once again crossed the Ganges at Ramghat in Badaun, and advanced towards Rohilkhand. The Nawab of Awadh with his British allies came to the aid of the Rohillas and the Marathas were forced to retreat. The Nawab of Awadh now demanded the payment that had been promised for his help. But Hafiz Rahmat Khan refused by sending letters to the Nawab and the British, pleading his inability to pay due to internal strife and discontent among his dependent chiefs.

This led to the First Rohilla War. Nawab Shuja-ud-Daula’s troops, supported by British troops, invaded Rohilkhand. Hafiz Rahmat Khan was killed in the ensuing Battle of Miranpur Katra in 1774

Rohilkhand fell to Awadh, and was plundered and occupied. The majority of the Rohillas left. They fled across the Ganges in numbers, to start a guerrilla war; or emigrated. A Rohilla state under British protection was set up in Rampur. Faizullah Khan managed to become the nawab of the newly created Rampur State.

The whole of Rohilkhand (including Pilibhit and Shahjanpur) was surrendered by Saadat Ali Khan II to the East India Company by the treaty of 10 November 1801.

<text>Newstalk ZB is a nationwide New Zealand talk-radio network operated by NZME Radio. It is available in almost every radio market area in New Zealand, and has news reporters based in many of them. In addition to talkback, the network also broadcasts news, interviews, music, and sports. The network&#x27;s hosts include Kate Hawkesby, Mike Hosking, Kerre Woodham, Simon Barnett, James Daniels, Heather du Plessis-Allan, Marcus Lush, Andrew Dickens, Jack Tame and Francesca Rudkin. Wellington and Christchurch have a local morning show.

Newstalk ZB operates one of the largest news operations in New Zealand, with over 50 newsreaders, reporters and editors nationwide. It operates a news centre in Auckland, news hubs in Wellington, Christchurch and Parliament, and regional newsrooms in Whangārei, Hamilton, Tauranga, Rotorua, Taupō, New Plymouth, Napier, Palmerston North, Nelson, Dunedin and Invercargill. Most of Newstalk ZB&#x27;s programming is produced in the NZME building in Auckland.

==History==

===1926–1987===

The history of Newstalk ZB dates back to 1926 when Auckland station 1ZB was first started initially broadcasting on 1070AM, the station moved to 1090 kHz in 1931, 1190 kHz in 1933 and 1080 kHz in 1978. The station&#x27;s brand name was the station&#x27;s call sign 1ZB. A ZB station was established in the four main centres of New Zealand as 1ZB Auckland, 2ZB Wellington, 3ZB Christchurch and 4ZB Dunedin. Up until 1987 the four ZB stations were music stations running a mixture of local and networked content. Each other individual station on the Newstalk ZB network has its own history with most stations starting out as a local AM radio run by Radio New Zealand.

1ZB originally operated from Broadcasting House, a purpose-built modernist theatre and studio building on Durham Street, from 1941 until its demolition in 1990.

===1987–1996===

In the mid 1980s, 1ZB Auckland lost a number of its key on-air personalities to privately owned Radio i, including Merv Smith who had hosted 1ZB&#x27;s breakfast programme for over twenty years. The station&#x27;s ratings subsequently plummeted as large numbers of listeners migrated to other stations. In 1987 a decision was made to re-launch 1ZB as a talkback station branded as Newstalk 1ZB. While the change was not popular initially the station showed growth by the end of the first year and by 1989 the breakfast show presented by Paul Holmes was the number one show in Auckland. In February 1993, in Auckland, Newstalk 1ZB began broadcasting on 89.4 FM as well as the original 1080 AM when local station 89X (formerly 89FM) ceased to operate, Radio New Zealand purchased this station a year earlier and chose to close it down and use the frequency for Newstalk 1ZB. The current Newstalk ZB nationwide 0800 number (0800 80 10 80) actually comes from the original 1080AM frequency in Auckland that is still in use today.

During the late eighties and early nineties Radio New Zealand switched many of their local heritage stations to FM but retained the AM frequency in each region running the same programme on both frequencies. Following the success of the talkback format in Auckland a decision was made to switch 2ZB Wellington and 3ZB Christchurch to a talkback format in 1991. At the same time new FM music stations were established in Wellington and Christchurch, these stations were &quot;B90 FM&quot; (Wellington) and &quot;B98 FM&quot; (Christchurch). In the early nineties many of the Radio New Zealand local stations that had switched to FM began running morning talkback shows on the AM frequency while continuing to play music on the FM frequency. In 1993 and 1994 the local Radio New Zealand station in some regions were rebranded with the Classic Hits name and the AM frequency was used to roll out the station across New Zealand, it was at this point Newstalk 1ZB was rebranded as Newstalk ZB. Initially those regions that ran local talkback shows on the AM frequency continued to do so and Wellington and Christchurch were initially local versions of Newstalk ZB.

===1996–2002===

In 1996 Radio New Zealand sold their commercial operation and Newstalk ZB, along with Classic Hits and ZM, became part of The Radio Network. In 2001 Newstalk ZB was further expanded into the smaller community markets in New Zealand. The smaller regions did not have their local stations rebranded as Classic Hits during the early nineties and many of these stations were still only broadcasting on AM frequencies. These stations were consolidated together in 1998 to become part of the Community Radio Network, in 2001 all Community Radio Network stations were rebranded as Classic Hits and at this point began broadcasting on FM if the station was already on FM leaving the AM frequency to now be used to broadcast Newstalk ZB. Today most Newstalk ZB stations run complete networked programming, however Wellington and Christchurch still have a local show in the mornings between 9 am and 12 pm.

===2002–2009===

Newstalk ZB&#x27;s Auckland audience dropped dramatically in 2002 as music radio stations became more popular, raising questions about the future viability of the network. However, in 2013 the station had the highest market share of any commercial station nationwide.

Paul Holmes caused controversy in September 2003, after he referred to United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan as a &quot;cheeky darkie&quot;. Holmes was labelled racist and faced pressure to resign. He issued two nationwide apologies, sent a letter of apology to Annan and met with members of the New Zealand Ghanaian community. The incident also affected his television show, which lost the sponsorship of Mitsubishi Motors. The Radio Network took disciplinary action against him, put their staff through a training seminar on racism run by race relations commissioner Joris de Bres, and a $10,000 donation was made to Save the Children. The Broadcasting Standards Authority refused to uphold 10 complaints against Holmes for the complaint, leading one complainant to appeal the decision in the High Court. On the same breakfast show Holmes asked whether the female journalists were making journalism &quot;ignorant and bitchy&quot;, particularly at certain times of the month. The authority found the comments were &quot;insulting and inappropriate&quot; but did not amount to denigrating and discriminating against women journalists.

Race relations commissioner Joris de Bres received a record number of complaints about the issue, a record later broken by a racially polarising and profanity-laden letter written by Hone Harawira. The comment also set a precedent, when former All Black Andy Haden faced calls to resign as a 2011 Rugby World Cup ambassador, after apologising for describing Pacific Island rugby players as &quot;darkies&quot;. Prime minister John Key and sports minister Murray McCully said both Haden and Holmes used the word &quot;darkies&quot; in similarly offensive ways, and the public needed to forgive them in similar ways.

Artist Ralph Hotere responded to Holmes&#x27; &quot;cheeky darky&quot; comment with a series of artworks. One, &quot;White Drip to Mister Paul Holmes&quot;, was a 2.7-metre long piece of corrugated iron painted in black, with a drip of white paint extending nearly the full length of the work. &#x27;To Mister Paul Holmes&#x27; is stenciled on the top of the piece, which is now one of his signature works. Holmes was apologetic and regretful about using the phrase, but later argued there was a fine line between humour and offense. The phrase featured on a commemorative tea towel, and fellow broadcaster John Hawkesby remembered Holmes as a &quot;cheeky little whitey&quot; at his funeral in 2013.

Holmes left his morning breakfast show at the end of 2008, and was succeeded in the role by Mike Hosking.

===2009–2011===
The network went through a process of restructuring during the Global Financial Crisis, removing one reporter position in the Parliamentary press gallery, one position in Wellington, one position in Auckland, and five reporting, hosting and producing roles in Christchurch. The Christchurch local news and sport bulletins and local morning show were later reintroduced, with NZME investing $7.8 million for a 17-year license for its 100.1 FM Christchurch frequency.

Following the Christchurch earthquake on 4 September 2010 and the major aftershock on 22 February 2011 programming in Christchurch was greatly affected. After both earthquakes the station broadcast in place of other radio stations in Christchurch operated by The Radio Network, the local studios located in Worcester Street in Christchurch were evacuated. Local news services in Christchurch were replaced temporarily with the network news feed which mostly contained news stories related to the quake heard by all of New Zealand. Local news readers reported news about the quake for all of New Zealand.

The local morning show remained on the air but was broadcast from a temporary location. Following the first earthquake this was at the Whitebait Studios in Christchurch, and following the earthquake in February it was a hotel in Christchurch. The Radio Network Christchurch never returned to their Worcester Street premises and eventually set up in a new location. The building was taken down in August 2012, in New Zealand&#x27;s first ever controlled building demolition with explosives.

===2011–present===

The TNS T2 2013 commercial radio survey showed the network had 11.4% of audiences aged over 10, and had the most listened-to breakfast show in the country. It came as Rachel Smalley became host of the newly created Early Edition programme. The same survey in 2014 showed Newstalk ZB lost 0.3% market share but gained 7,600 listeners during a time when other NZME radio stations were in decline. It has also been observed that ZB and Mai FM are the only stations that can be received by car radios in used imported cars from Japan — of which New Zealand is a large market – due to the Japanese FM band spanning 76–90 MHz instead of the standard 88–108 MHz band.

Host Rachel Smalley apologised in April 2014 after describing New Zealand women over 72 kilograms as &quot;heifers&quot; and a &quot;bunch of lardos&quot; during an ad break when she believed her microphone was off. The comments were reported and criticised in several local and international media outlets, including news.com.au and the Daily Mail. In a tearful apology the following morning, she described her comments as deeply offensive, stupid and judgemental and said she deeply regretted her choice of words. The Broadcasting Standards Authority rejected complaints against the comments, saying they were neither calculated nor deliberate.

Blogger Cameron Slater was a regular commentator on the drive programme for several years, and has been both critical and supportive of the station&#x27;s positions in the past. In 2013, the Broadcasting Standards Authority rejected complaints against Slater over his suggestions that openly gay Labour MP Grant Robertson &quot;enjoys being stabbed from behind&quot; – and Newstalk ZB defended what they argued was &quot;robust, irreverent, edgy&quot; debate. In 2014, he participated in a series of one-hour pre-election panel discussions on the drive programme. He retained the position following the release of the Nicky Hager book Dirty Politics. However, left-wing commentators called for him to be taken off-air or resign.

According to Lonely Planet in 2014, the station provided a forum for &quot;the most lively discussions on New Zealand issues&quot;. Conspiracy theorists, veganism advocates, victims of sexual assault, and housing activists have called talkback. Regular callers include an urban Māori man, a state housing beneficiary, a security guard, a Timaru pensioner, a West Coast grandmother, a dairy farmer, a Dutch butcher and several taxi drivers.

In late September 2023, NZME launched a paid digital subscription platform called ZB PLUS. Blogger Philip Crump (who is also known by the pseudonym &quot;Thomas Cramner&quot;) was named as the editor of ZB Plus. Notable contributors included former ACT Party MP Muriel Newman, former National Party minister Katherine Rich, NZME head of business Fran O&#x27;Sullivan and former businessman and podcaster Bruce Cotterill. Its most notable exclusive story was breaking the news about shoplifting allegations against former Green Party MP Golriz Ghahraman in early 2024. By late June 2024, the website had been folded back into the &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; mothership.

== News ==
Newstalk ZB operates Newstalk ZB News from its Auckland news centre, producing live bulletins for the national ZB network. Wellington and Christchurch both broadcast live local news bulletins during the breakfast show, Auckland has live local bulletins at 7.00am and 8.00am, and other stations carry network bulletins every half-hour from 5am to 12am and hourly from 12am to 5am. Regional newsrooms previously provided each station with local news segments during the breakfast show. Newstalk ZB&#x27;s pip sting, headlines segmented bulletin structure and &quot;Keep up with Newstalk ZB&quot; tagline were removed in December 2014, replaced with a single continuous bulletin, new theme music and &quot;Now You&#x27;re in the Now&quot; tagline.

The news service covers stories, from industrial relations to prisoner rehabilitation. It extensively covers crime and court proceedings, but was criticised for publishing a wire story about the verdict against lawyer Davina Murray in 2013. Network weekday newsreaders include Niva Retimanu (Breakfast) and Kay Gregory (Evenings/Overnights).

=== History ===

Newstalk ZB News began as Independent Radio News (IRN), a news service played on most independently owned and operated radio stations in New Zealand during the 1980s and 1990s. The majority of New Zealand radio stations not owned by Radio New Zealand (RNZ) used this news and sport service usually followed by the station&#x27;s own local news and weather forecast.

In 1996 RNZ sold its commercial operation and The Radio Network (TRN) was formed, at the time TRN purchased IRN. TRN branded the news service on its own stations as &quot;Radio Network News&quot; while the news service continued to be called IRN on stations not owned by TRN despite the news coming from the same place. RNZ continued to operate its own news service on RNZ National and RNZ Concert, the two non-commercial stations that were not sold.

By 2000 a large number of independent radio stations had been taken over by RadioWorks, which did not want to pay for a news service operated by its main competitor and chose to start their own news service. After CanWest purchased RadioWorks the news service became known as the Global News Service (Global is the same name as Television network in Canada operated by CanWest), and in early 2005 it was again renamed to Radio Live News. Similarly, IRN News later became Newstalk ZB News.

Since 2016 a single news bulletin sourced from the NZME newsroom is heard on every NZME radio station (apart from Newstalk ZB) during breakfast and other parts of the day.

=== Affiliate Service ===

The Newstalk ZB Affiliates Unit is based in the Auckland newsroom, and records a variety of hourly bulletins for other stations of NZME Radio and sells its bulletins to a number of external clients including Radio 1XX – One Double-X in Whakatane and the Eastern Bay of Plenty.

==Other services==

===Timesaver Traffic===

The Newstalk ZB Timesaver Traffic Centre produces and records traffic updates for all New Zealand Media and Entertainment stations. These updates for Auckland, Hamilton, Tauranga, Hawkes Bay, Wellington &amp; Christchurch air every 15 minutes during peak breakfast and drive time slots, and hourly throughout the day and weekend on Newstalk ZB.

===Promotions===

Newstalk ZB runs regular promotions for movie previews and local events. The network has sponsored a range of events – from Variety, the Children&#x27;s Charity special children&#x27;s parties and food bank events, through to musical tours from bands like The Feelers. Its on-air competitions include breakfast giveway campaigns like the ASB All I Want For Christmas contest. Over several years, Newstalk ZB has given funding and support to Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra, visiting international productions and local theatre companies. It also supports the work of the Westpac Rescue Helicopter service operated by the Auckland Rescue Helicopter Trust, primarily through advertising and awareness-raising.

===Notices and cancellations===

ZB stations have a long-running history of running notices for events and community groups. Cancellations for club and school sports events and recreation clubs have traditionally been broadcast every 30 minutes during breakfast in many markets.

===Website===

The Newstalk ZB website combines on-demand content with breaking news coverage. The network&#x27;s Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch streams are all available on the iHeartRadio website and app.

== Reception ==
In August 2024, &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; reported that Newstalk ZB&#x27;s breakfast show&#x27;s cumulative audience had increased from under 400,000 in early 2020 to 445,300 in 2024. Newstalk ZB had 277,900 listeners in Auckland, doubling public competitor Radio New Zealand&#x27;s Morning Report&#x27;s in that city. The &quot;Herald&quot; attributed the radio station&#x27;s competitive edge over Radio NZ to the popularity of its breakfast hosts Mike Hosking and Paul Holmes.

== Controversy ==
=== Broadcasting standards breaches ===
The Broadcasting Standards Authority upheld a complaint in December 2014 about an editorial on the Israeli shelling of UNRWA Gaza shelters during the Israel-Gaza conflict. The authority found the programme had overstated the number of people killed in the bombing of the Rafah Preparatory A Boys School and had wrongly condemned Israel of targeting civilians and killing every civilian inside. Newstalk ZB argued the number of fatalities was irrelevant to the broader point, but the authority said the right to express opinions in editorials did not justify factually inaccurate and misleading statements.

In April 2019, the Broadcasting Standards Authority (BSA) upheld two complaints regarding the &quot;Wellington Mornings with Heather du Plessis-Allan&quot; programme on 4 September 2018, in which host Heather du Plessis-Allan described Pacific Island nations as leeches. The BSA found the programme breached the standards of good taste and decency, and discrimination and denigration, and ordered Newstalk ZB to issue a on-air statement and to pay $3,000 in costs.

In April 2024, the BSA upheld a complaint regarding the &quot;Early Edition with Kate Hawkesby&quot; programme on 19 June 2023, in which host Kate Hawkesby made comments about Māori and Pacific patients being prioritised for surgery due to their ethnicity. The BSA found the programme breached the standards of accuracy, and discrimination and denigration, and ordered Newstalk ZB to issue a on-air statement and to pay $1,500 in costs.

<text>Radio Sport (previously Sports Roundup) was a New Zealand sports radio network and the talkback sister network of Newstalk ZB. It held commentary rights for most cricket matches, international and domestic rugby union games, NRL rugby league games, trans-Tasman basketball and New Zealand tennis tournaments.

The network also updated developments at golfing events, bowls tournaments and other sporting events. At other times Radio Sport played talkback and hourly news and sports updates.

==History==

===Sports Roundup===

Radio Sport began as Sports Roundup, a Radio New Zealand programme during the 1980s and early 1990s that provided live commentary of summer sports like cricket. It was broadcast on several frequencies around the country on a time-share with the AM Network on frequencies historically used for The Concert Programme.

===Radio Sport===
Sports Roundup was replaced with dedicated Radio Sport network through its privatisation of the sports commentary department in 1996.

The station was targeted at male sports fans from its outset. As Newstalk ZB&#x27;s sister network, Radio Sport provided all sports news coverage for the Newstalk ZB news service carried by Newstalk ZB, Classic Hits FM, ZMFM, Radio Rhema, Radio Hauraki, Southern Star, Coast and Life FM since its inception. Unless the network was taking live commentary from a sporting event, Radio Sport simulcasted Newstalk ZB MondayThursday 19:00–20:00 and weekends 6:00–9:00 and 12:00–18:00.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic affecting most major sporting events, Radio Sport was closed at 1pm on 30 March 2020 and replaced with a simulcast of Newstalk ZB.

==Programmes==

Radio Sport consisted of nationally broadcast domestic and international sports programming. Local opt-outs were limited to ad breaks and some seasonal programming.

Radio Sport also provided a sports-based news service, produced in house, and updated at regular intervals.

=== Early Breakfast ===

The Country &#x27;Early Edition&#x27; presented by Rowena Duncam aired Monday-Friday from 5am until 6am from the Dunedin Studios, and featured highlights of the 12pm show and a cross to the Radio Sport Breakfast team.

=== Breakfast ===

Radio Sport&#x27;s programming was led by its breakfast programme. Since 2017 the breakfast programme was Radio Sport Breakfast with Kent Johns, Nathan Rarere and Marc Peard from 6am until 9am. The programme also featured News and Sport Every 30 minutes. Until 17 July 2008 the programme was presented by ONE News sports presenter Tony Veitch, but Veitch resigned from his roles with Radio Sport and ONE News after allegations that Veitch assaulted his girlfriend in 2006. Veitch confessed on 8 July 2008 that such allegations were true, at a press conference and resigned on 17 July. The vacancy was filled by former drive-time presenter D&#x27;Arcy Waldegrave, with former New Zealand cricketer Mark Richardson as his co-host. Richardson was joined by Andrew Mulligan joining him in late 2013 to host the Crowd Goes Wild Breakfast. In 2015 it was announced that Richardson was to leave the show in the middle of that year, with former New Zealand cricketer Simon Doull to take over as co-host a fortnight after Richardson&#x27;s departure. The Crowd Goes Wild Breakfast remained on air until the end of 2016.

=== Mornings ===
Radio Sport Mornings was hosted by Jason Pine &amp; Sam Hewitt. The 9–12 slot was filled by veteran sports broadcaster Brendan Telfer until 2013. From 2014 experienced sport broadcaster Martin Devlin took over the slot after being shifted from sister station Radio Hauraki. In mid 2018 Jason &amp; Sam took over. The show featured regular correspondents, interviews and talkback, it also contained light hearted segments based entirely on TV game shows, sport matches predictions &amp; a comical, lighthearted look at the weekends sports presented in a 1950s BBC style. A common theme on the show was WWSD (what would Sam do).

=== Afternoons ===

The Country with Jamie MacKay presented from the Dunedin studios aired between 12pm 1pm. This show was broadcast on all Radio Sport stations except in Auckland.

The afternoon talkback programme between midday and 4pm on the station was hosted by Daniel McHardy from the Wellington studios. Between 121pm the show only aired on the Auckland station, due to all other stations airing the rural based programme The Country. After 1pm though, the show aired nationwide. The show primarily featured calls from its listeners and predicts the weekend&#x27;s sports on Friday afternoons.

=== Drive Show ===

D&#x27;Arcy Waldegrave and Angus Mabey hosted the drive show between 4pm and 7pm weekdays which featured regular guests, interviews and sums up the days top sporting stories.

=== Sportstalk ===

Sportstalk with D&#x27;Arcy Waldegrave aired from MondayThursday nights 7pm 8pm (Simulcast from Newstalk ZB).

===Evenings===

Reloaded hosted by Eli Mwaijumba aired from 8pm until 10pm. Reloaded featured interviews, highlights, reaction and the best live sport.
Until 2017 the previous night show &#x27;The Night Train&#x27; was a Talkback-based show.

===Overnights===

Overnight, Radio Sport aired FOX Sports Radio from America, through a live internet feed or Talksport simulcast during the English Premier League season.

<text>Karnam Malleswari (born 1 June 1975) is a retired Indian weightlifter. She is the first Indian woman to win a medal at the Olympics in 2000. In 1994, she received the Arjuna Award and in 1999, she received the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award, India&#x27;s highest sporting honour, and the civilian Padma Shri award.

Malleswari won the world title in the 54 kg division in 1994 and 1995 and placed third in 1993 and 1996. 

In 1994, she won silver at the World Championships in Istanbul and in 1995 she won the Asian Weightlifting Championships in Korea in the 54 kg category. That year, she won the title in China with a record lift of 113 kg at the World Championships. Even before her Olympic win, Malleswari was a two-time weightlifting world champion with 29 international medals, which includes 11 gold medals.

Along with the national and international medals, Malleswari was also awarded with Arjuna Award in 1994, the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna in 1999, and Padma Shri in 1999.

Malleshwari started her career when she was 12 and was trained under coach Neelamshetty Appanna. Her sister was married and living in Delhi, and Malleshwari moved to that city for better training when it became clear that she had the potential to become a great athlete. Her talent was soon spotted by the Sports Authority of India. In 1990, Malleshwari joined the national camp and four years later, she became the weight-lifting world championship winner in the 54-kg class. 

In 1997, Malleshwari married fellow weightlifter Rajesh Tyagi. In 2001, one year after winning the Olympic bronze medal in her sport, she became a mother with the birth of a son. She planned to return to competitions at the 2002 Commonwealth Games, but withdrew due to her father&#x27;s death. She retired after failing to score at the 2004 Olympics. Karnam Malleshwari and Tyagi currently lives in Yamunanagar, Haryana, with their son and in-laws in a joint family. She works at the Food Corporation of India as Chief General Manager (General Administration).

<doc id="903673" wikidata="Q7761248" url="?curid=903673" title="The Rock (radio station)">
<text>The Rock is a New Zealand mainstream rock music radio station. The station targets 25–44 with a male skew, but has a significant female fan base. It plays rock music and showcases up-and-coming New Zealand bands.

The Rock has unpredictable features and countdowns, most notably The Rock 2000 (formerly The Rock 1500, 1000 &amp; 500), an annual music countdown based entirely on songs voted for by their rock listeners.

Some of its broadcasts have been controversial, and the Broadcasting Standards Authority has upheld many complaints against it.

==History==

The Rock began broadcasting on 1 December 1991 in Hamilton as &quot;The Rock 93FM&quot;. The first song to air on The Rock was Are You Ready? by AC/DC. The Rock was formed by Joe Dennehy GM, Grant Hislop PD, and Martin Dempster.The original line-up included Chris Clarke on breakfast (replaced by Mark Bunting after 2 months) and Roger Farrelly on Drive. Originally, The Rock 93FM was based in the basement of Radio New Zealand Broadcasting House in Hamilton, headquartered in the studios for ZHFM. The transmitter was originally located on the top of Waikato Hospital. In 1993 The Rock moved to new premises at 564 Victoria Street in Hamilton.

The station purchased a collection of FM frequencies from the Christian Broadcasting Association and transferred them to Nevada. Using the first of these frequencies a local version of The Rock was started in Taranaki in 1993, this station was originally broadcast on 100FM but after Nevada Resources Ltd and Energy Enterprises merged, the station moved to 95.6FM. A third The Rock station was started in the Bay of Plenty in 1996 with local programming. In 1997 The Rock created a regional network by replacing the Taranaki and Bay of Plenty stations with the Hamilton-based The Rock station and also networked into Rotorua.

===Nationwide expansion===

In 1998 The Rock began networking to other regions in the North Island. In 1999, The Rock moved to Auckland, and began broadcasting from there. Later that year, Energy Enterprises and Radio Otago merged to form RadioWorks; as a result, the station was networked into the South Island. In Christchurch, Radio Otago had already been operating their own rock station called C93FM and this station was networked to Dunedin and Invercargill, C93FM actually played a classic rock format similar to Radio Hauraki. RadioWorks replaced C93FM in Dunedin and Invercargill with The Rock and kept C93FM operating in Christchurch, but changed its format to Adult Contemporary and launched The Rock on a separate frequency. C93 no longer operates as the station failed to attract listeners after the format change. Christchurch C93FM listeners were gutted that their local Classic Rock station had a format change and had to give way to a Network station, the phones rung for weeks with upset listeners not liking the format change to Adult Contemporary. Today The Rock broadcasts in almost every market in New Zealand.

The only remaining original member of The Rock crew is Rog. Other DJs left, including Greenman, who went on his OE to the UK, Beachy (Christopher Beach) who moved into sales and Julie Moffett, who now works at RNZ.

==Programmes==

===The Morning Rumble===

The morning radio show is known as The Morning Rumble, the members of which are currently Roger Farrelly (&quot;Rog&quot;, &quot;Big Dog&quot;), Bryce Casey (2020 Broadcaster of the Year), Andrew Mulligan (&quot;Mulls&quot;) and Mel Abbot. Rog has been a co-host on the show since its inception. Simon Doull spent several years as a co-host, left and returned in 2015. In March 2011 Andrew Mulligan joined but left for Radio Sport a few years later and returned in 2017.

Bryce has attempted to break two world records during his tenure on the show, his most notable attempt being to break the record for &quot;The Longest Tenpin Bowling Marathon&quot;. He fell short in 2004 by only a few hours. In June 2019 Bryce not only broke the world record for the longest time ten-pin bowling continuously, he also raised over $350,000 for the charity &quot;I am hope&quot;.

==== Hosts ====
Roger, or Rog as he&#x27;s known, joined the Morning Rumble in 1994. Prior to that he had worked the afternoon shift at The Rock. Rog serves as a leader of sorts for the Morning Rumble crew, and his ongoing banter and power struggles with Bryce provide a lot of the show&#x27;s entertainment. Mel provides the female perspective on the show and reads the news, while Andrew Mulligan reads the sports news. The producers are Ryan Maguire and Mitch Farr.

==== Features ====
On Fridays a section of the show was called &#x27;Do Stuff To Jono Fridays&#x27;. This formed a large part of the entertainment value and was an early distinguishing feature of The Rock. Jono was made the victim of stunts such as &#x27;The Human Slushy&#x27;, &#x27;The Pyramid of Fire&#x27;, &#x27;Human Coleslaw&#x27;, &#x27;Sleigh of Fire&#x27;, &#x27;The Skater Ramp of Doom&#x27;, a full body wax, and giving Jono a tattoo on his bottom but not telling him that it was a love heart with the other DJs names.

In 2006 when Jono got his own slot with Robert on weekday afternoons, the show then became &quot;Do Stuff To Jimmy&quot;. Stunts included putting electrodes on his nipples, and other assorted painful and humiliating acts. Jimmy is no longer working at The Rock, and there is currently no &#x27;Do Stuff&#x27; segment. A one-off &#x27;Final Ever Do Stuff To Jono&#x27; stunt was planned and executed in September 2009, during which Jono performed a &#x27;Mega Stunt&#x27; - riding a BMX bike down a steep slope, through pyrotechnics and a pane of glass, and finally scaling a ramp to jump over a parked ute.

The Rock organised a &#x27;win a wife&#x27; competition in early 2011. The winner would travel to Ukraine to meet a girl via the &quot;Endless Love&quot; dating agency. In response the Ukrainian group Femen organised a topless protest against this competition (in March 2011). A Femen activist advised: &quot;Femen warns the &#x27;lucky&#x27; winner of the New Zealand competition that he can expect an unhappy ending in Ukraine&quot;.

===Rock Workdays===

Mel Abbot takes over on-air from 10am – 1pm fronting &quot;The Rock Workdays&quot; show which also features a legends of rock hour between 12-1pm. Mel is followed by Lee Weir (&quot;Westie Lee&quot;), who is also the technical producer of The Rock&#x27;s drive show, from 1pm – 3pm.

===Rock Drive===
The Rock&#x27;s drive show is hosted from 3pm – 7pm by Duncan Heyde (&quot;Dunc&quot;), who is also the executive producer of the show, with co-host Jay Reeve, technical producer Lee Weir (&quot;Westie Lee&quot;) and executive producer Tiegan Lilley (&quot;Show Boss&quot;).

===Rock Nights===

Caleb Greaves hosts Rock Nights.

===The Rock 2000===

The Rock 2000 is an annual countdown feature, counting down the 2000 biggest rock songs ever, as voted by listeners in an online poll. The chart order, including which bands and songs feature on the countdown, is determined by listeners via a voting system on the station&#x27;s official website. The countdown runs on weekdays over a four-week period and is broadcast throughout New Zealand. 

Previous it was known as The Rock 500 since 1999. Since before 2006 it has been called The Rock 1000. From 2017 to 2019 it was known as The Rock 1500. In 2016, the list expanded by 50% as The Rock 1000+500. Since 2020 it has been known as The Rock 2000. In 2024 they celebrated the 25th anniversary with a live event in Auckland for the top 20 songs on 13 September.

<text>Nauratan/Navaratnas (Sanskrit dvigu &quot;nava-ratna&quot;, , ) or Nauratan was a term applied to a group of nine extraordinary people in an emperor&#x27;s court in India. The well-known Navaratnas include the ones in the courts of the legendary emperor Vikramaditya, the 16th-century Mughal emperor Akbar, and the 18th-century feudal lord Raja Krishnachandra.

== Vikramaditya&#x27;s Navaratnas ==

Vikramaditya was a legendary emperor, who ruled from Ujjain. According to folk tradition, his court had 9 famous scholars. The earliest source that mentions this legend is &quot;Jyotirvid-abharana&quot; (22.10), a treatise attributed to Kalidasa. According to this text, the following 9 scholars (including Kalidasa himself) attended Vikramaditya&#x27;s court:

Another popular tradition mentions the astronomer Brahmagupta and the magician Vaitalik, instead of Ghatkharpar and Vetala-Bhatta, among the nine scholars.

However, &quot;Jyotirvid-abharana&quot; is a literary forgery of a date later than Kalidasa, and was probably attributed to Kalidasa to popularize it. V. V. Mirashi dates the work to 12th century, and points out that it could not have been composed by Kalidasa, because it contains grammatical faults. Other scholars have variously dated the text to the 13th century (Sudhakara Dvivedi), 16th century (A.B. Keith), and 18th century (H. Kern).

There is no mention of such &quot;Navaratnas&quot; in earlier literature. D. C. Sircar calls this tradition &quot;absolutely worthless for historical purposes&quot;.

There is no historical evidence to show that these nine scholars were contemporary figures or proteges of the same king. Vararuchi is believed to have lived around 3rd or 4th century CE. The period of Kalidasa is debated, but most historians place him around 5th century CE. Varahamihira is known to have lived in 6th century CE. Dhanavantari was the author of a medical glossary (Nighantu); his period is uncertain. Amarasimha cannot be dated with certainty either, but his lexicon utilizes the works of Dhanavantari and Kalidasa; therefore, he cannot be dated to 1st century BCE, when the legendary Vikramaditya is said to have established the Vikrama Samvat in 57 BCE. Not much is known about Shanku, Vetalabhatta, Kshapanaka and Ghatakarpara. Some Jain writers identify Siddhasena Divakara as Kshapanaka, but this claim is not accepted by historians.

Kalidasa is the only figure whose association with Vikramaditya is mentioned in works earlier than &quot;Jyotirvidabharana&quot;. Rajasekhara&#x27;s &quot;Kāvyamimāṃsa&quot; (10th century), Bhoja&#x27;s &quot;Sringara Prakasa&quot; (11th century) and Kshemendra&#x27;s &quot;Auchitya-Vichara-Charcha&quot; (11th century) mention that Vikramaditya sent Kalidasa as his ambassador to the Kuntala country (identified with present-day Uttara Kannada). The historicity of these legends is doubtful.

==Akbar&#x27;s Nauratan==
According to popular tradition, the court of the Mughal ruler Akbar had nine intellectuals called the Navaratnas or the nine gems. As in Vikramaditya&#x27;s case, this tradition has no historical basis. According to historian G.S. Sardesai, Hindu pandits in the court of Shah Jahan or Dara Shikoh - Jagannathrai or Kavindracharya - may have started this tradition.

Since this tradition is historically inaccurate, the names of the nine gems varies between sources. Some of the names included in various lists include:

For example, a painting kept at the Lala Sri Ramdas Library (Delhi) in the 1940s depicts the following people as the nine gems: Abdul Rahim, Todar Mal, Man Singh, Birbal, Miyan Kokultash, Hakim Humam, Abul Hasan, Abu&#x27;l-Fazl, and Faizi.

==Raja Krishnachandra&#x27;s Nabaratnas==

Raja Krishnachandra was a ruler of Bengal, who ruled over 1727 to 1772. According to legend, his court had 9 famous scholars, who are mentioned as ‘Nabaratnas’ (নবরত্ন). These included Gopal Bhar, Bharatchandra Raygunakor, Ramprasad Sen, Baneshwar Bidyalankar, Krishnadhan roy, Rammohan Goswami, Madhusudan Nyayalankar, Jagannath Tarkapanchanan and Hariram Tarkasiddhanta.

==Similar groups==
Many famous emperors in India had courtiers labeled in similar ways. For example, the valuable members of the court of Krishna Deva Raya were termed Astadiggajas, &quot;the eight scholars.&quot; Lakshmana Sena the ruler of the Sena Empire had &quot;Pancharatnas&quot; (meaning 5 gems who were Govardhana, Sarana, Jayadeva(author of Gita govinda), umapati, Dhoyi in his court. Ashtapradhan mandal was the title given to the council of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.

<doc id="903679" wikidata="Q7870586" url="?curid=903679" title="USS Jones (1814)">
<text>USS &quot;Jones&quot; was a brig in the United States Navy during the War of 1812.

&quot;Jones&quot; was built at Sacketts Harbor, New York, for service in Commodore Isaac Chauncey&#x27;s fleet on Lake Ontario and was launched on 10 April 1814.

Most of the cannon for the new American ships had not reached Sackett&#x27;s Harbor on 19 May when the British fleet arrived off the American base and established a strict blockade which temporarily bottled up the heavily outgunned American squadron. After the British commander, Sir James Yeo, raised the blockade on 6 June, an epidemic struck the American fleet causing further delay.

&quot;Jones&quot; sailed with Chauncey&#x27;s vessels on 31 July and arrived off Niagara on 5 August. As the American ships approached the port, now in British hands, they intercepted enemy brig HMS &quot;Charwell&quot; and chased her ashore where her crew set her ablaze. Chauncey then sailed to Kingston via York (now Toronto) arriving on 9 August. The next day &quot;Jones&quot; and the schooner were ordered to cruise between Oswego and Sackett&#x27;s Harbor protecting American communications.

&quot;Jones&quot; rejoined the fleet on 17 September and operated with it during the remainder of the navigation season attempting to draw Sir James Yeo&#x27;s ships into a decisive contest. Toward the end of November she returned to Sackett&#x27;s Harbor, where she served as a receiving ship for several years after the end of the war. She was sold and broken up in 1821.

<text>These are tables of congressional delegations from Virginia to the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives. Virginia&#x27;s current U.S. Senators are Democrats Mark Warner (serving since 2009) and Tim Kaine (serving since 2013). Virginia is allotted 11 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives; currently, 6 seats are held by Democrats and 5 seats are held by Republicans.

The current dean of the Virginia delegation is Representative Bobby Scott (VA-3), having served in the House since 1993.

==United States Senate==

===1843 – 1853: 15 seats===
===1853 – 1863: 13 seats===
===1863 – 1873: 8 seats===
The 1860 census allotted 11 seats to Virginia, but 3 were assigned to West Virginia, established in 1863. Virginia was left with 8 seats. For most of this decade, however, Virginian representatives were not seated in Congress because of Virginia&#x27;s secession in the Civil War. After January 26, 1870, Virginia was allowed to seat members. The state convention called for a ninth seat, at-large, but the House rejected the credentials of its claimant, Joseph Segar.

===1873 – 1883: 9 seats===
Following the 1870 census, Virginia was allotted 9 seats.

===1883 – 1933: 10 seats===
After the 1880 census, Virginia gained one seat. For the 48th Congress, a new at-large seat was added to the 9 districts. Starting in the 49th Congress, however, the state was redistricted into 10 districts.


===1933 – 1953: 9 seats===
After the 1930 census, Virginia lost one seat. For the 73rd Congress (1933–1935), all nine representatives were elected at-large statewide. In all subsequent Congresses, representatives were elected from districts.

===1953 – 1993: 10 seats===
In 1953, Virginia gained one seat.


===1993 – present: 11 seats===
In 1993, Virginia gained one more seat, with no subsequent changes since 2003.

<doc id="903684" wikidata="Q55624" url="?curid=903684" title="Snuneymuxw First Nation">
<text>The Snuneymuxw First Nation (pronounced ) is located in and around the city of Nanaimo on east-central Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. The nation previously had also occupied territory along the Fraser River, in British Columbia.

Prior to European colonization of the Americas and the creation of Indian reserves in the nineteenth century, this people occupied a wide region of south-central Vancouver Island, where they had lived for more than 5,000 years. Snuneymuxw Territory extended to the Gulf Islands, and the Fraser River in the British Columbia; it was in the centre of Coast Salish territory. Their language is Hul’qumi’num.

The Snuneymuxw First Nation operates Newcastle Island Marine Provincial Park.

== Language ==

The SFN speak the Hul&#x27;q&#x27;umi&#x27;num dialect of Hul’q’umi’num’, Halq&#x27;eméylem, hən̓q̓əmin̓əm. This is a Coast Salish language, part of the Salishan language family.

According to the Snuneymuxw First Nation Language Needs Assessment report of January 2009, published by the First Peoples&#x27; Heritage Language &amp; Culture Council (FPHLCC), of a total population of 1560 (with 550 on reserve and 1010 off-reserve), there were 25 people who spoke and understood the language fluently. Eleven of these persons were between the ages of 65–74, 13 were between the ages of 75–84, and one was 85 and over. There were 35 who understood and/or spoke the language somewhat. Four were between the ages of 25–44, 23 were between the ages of 45–54, and 8 were between the ages of 55–64. Some 25 people were learning the language. Of that group, 15 were between the ages of 15–19, 2 were between the ages of 25–44, 4 were between the ages of 45–54, and 4 were between the ages of 55–64.

The language assessment noted that the First Nation had four small reserves at the time. City water had been suspended in 1992 at one reserve because of contamination, and new infrastructure was not built for 20 years. This prevented development of the reserves for such needs as housing, and many people lived off-reserve.

==History==

Archeological excavations have revealed that the Snuneymuxw had a winter village and burial site in present-day Departure Bay dating to about 3,500 year BP. In 2007 the remains of about 15 individuals were uncovered at the construction site of a future condo development owned by developer Bruce McLay. Madrone Environmental Services from Duncan, BC conducted an archaeological excavation of the site.

Eventually remains of more than 80 people were uncovered. When the late Chief Viola Wyse requested that B.C. Premier Gordon Campbell protect the site, the province purchased it. For a time the site remained &quot;sad, forlorn and neglected&quot;, surrounded by a bent chain-link fence and covered in straggled patches of weeds.

In March 2013, as part of the provincial reconciliation agreement with First Nations, this site was transferred to the Snuneymuxw. Referring to this discovery, 

The site of the former Moby Dick Hotel, 1000 Stewart Ave, Nanaimo, was the location of a Snuneymuxw village of historical importance to the First Nation. It is situated at the narrowest point of Newcastle Channel, separating Newcastle Island from Nanaimo.

Former Snuneymuxw Chief White had plans to construct modest facilities on Newcastle Island to deliver new kinds of programming on Coast Salish culture, Newcastle Island&#x27;s coal mining history, the CPR history, and the canneries history as part of a heritage tourist destination. Snuneymuxw First Nation will be collaborating with Waterfront Holdings Ltd. on current and future waterfront development on Stewart Avenue. The First Nation operates Newcastle Island Marine Provincial Park.

=== Nanaimo Indian Hospital ===
The Nanaimo Indian Hospital served Indian patients and was operated by the federal government of Canada on Snuneymuxw territory from 1946 to 1967. The system of state-run Indian hospitals was deeply intertwined with the institution of residential schools. Like the schools, the hospital system has been documented for having a history of physical and sexual abuse of Indigenous people.

In the summer of 2021, hundreds of unmarked graves were identified at the Kamloops Indian Residential School. Other First Nations began to undertake their own surveys of sites of local Indian schools.

In response, Steve Sxwithul&#x27;txw of the Penelakut First Nation, carver Tom LaFortune, and educator Michele Mundy started a GoFundMe campaign to help First Nations on Vancouver Island conduct their own research around sites of former residential school and the Indian hospital. They will use current technology that does not disturb the ground. On 15 September 2021, the group gave Snuneymuxw First Nation , to help the First Nation conduct a search and to identify possible unmarked graves in and around the former grounds of the hospital.

== Territory and current land base ==

Snuneymuxw Territory on the eastern coast of Vancouver Island, the Gulf Islands, and the Fraser River in the British Columbia was in the centre of Coast Salish territory.

The band&#x27;s traditional territory covers . They share of non-exclusive traditional territory with other First Nations of Canada.

In March 2013 the Snuneymuxw First Nation received an additional 877 hectares of land, consisting of three parcels in the Mount Benson area, as part of a reconciliation agreement with the government. Ida Chong, B.C. aboriginal relations and reconciliation minister, announced at the Vancouver Island Conference Centre that the land was &quot;intended to provide forestry-related economic opportunities to generate revenue and employment&quot; for the SFN.

According to the AANRC Profiles, the Snuneymuxw First Nation, band number 648 had six very small reserves as of 2012. Before the March 2013 reconciliation addition, the Snuneymuxw total reserve land base had consisted of 266 hectares, with the community historically divided into four small, numbered reserves on the shores of Nanaimo Harbour and Nanaimo River, and two tiny reserves at Gabriola Island. On a per capita basis, the Snuneymuxw land base was the smallest reserve land base in British Columbia. In January 2013, two reserves at Nanaimo River were amalgamated into the third, and are now part of what is called the Nanaimo River Reserve. (See further information below.)

The small size and odd shapes and locations of these reserves are visible on the interactive map provided by Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada. Reserve 1, consisting of several city blocks, is between a railroad track and the main highway that goes through Nanaimo.

Three reserves were along the Nanaimo River: Reserve 2 on the east bank, and Reserves 3 and 4 on the west bank. The river and river banks are not reserve land. All three of these parcels are on the estuary and appear to be in a flood zone. These small reserves are bounded by the main Island Highway, Duke Point Highway and Cedar Road. Although surrounded by the city of Nanaimo, they were not fully provided with water and sewage infrastructure, which resulted in underdevelopment of this area.

# Nanaimo town 1, also known as Reserve No. 1, (AANRC number 06815) is located in the Nanaimo District on Nanaimo Harbour adjacent to the city of Nanaimo and consists of . There were 337 residents in 2011.
# Nanaimo River 2, also known as Reserve No. 2 (AANRC number 06816), is located in the Cranberry District on the left bank of the Nanaimo River near its mouth and consists of . There were 26 residents in 2011. It has been dissolved and amalgamated with Nanaimo River Reserve.
# Nanaimo River 3, also known as Reserve No. 3 (AANRC number 06817), is located in the Cranberry District, point of Section 21, Range 1, and Sections 19 and 21 Range 7, near the mouth of the Nanaimo River, and consists of . Statistics Canada provides a precise map. There were 81 residents in 2011. It has been dissolved and amalgamated with Nanaimo River Reserve.
# Nanaimo River 4, also known as Reserve No. 4 (AANRC number 06818), is located in the Cranberry District, Sections 18 and 19, Range 8, 4 miles southwest of Nanaimo, on the east coast of Vancouver Island, and consists of . 
As of January 2013, Nanaimo River Reserve, with 287 residents, was listed as having undergone an amalgamation, absorbing Nanaimo River 2 and Nanaimo River 3, which were dissolved as separate reserves.

# Gabriola Island 5 reserve (AANRC number 06819) is located in Nanaimo District, Section 1, on the west point at mouth of Degnen Bay, south of Gabriola Island and consists of .
# Ma-guala 6 (AANRC number 06820) is located in Nanaimo District. It is a small island in Degnen Bay on the south shore of Gabriola island and consists of .

== Governance ==

Snuneymuxw First Nation is governed by an elected Chief and Council. On 2 December 2017, Michael James Wyse Sr. (Xum&#x27;silum) was elected chief of Snuneymuxw First Nation defeating incumbent Chief John Gordon (Gord) Wesley by 310 votes to 210 votes. Previously, on 7 December 2013, Chief John Gordon (Gord) Wesley was elected with 253 votes out of 499. Five Councillors were also elected for up to a four-year term. Elections are carried out in accordance with the Snuneymuxw First Nation Election Code (2007) &amp; Regulations (2011).

== Demographics ==
The Snuneymuxw First Nation number is 648. The band&#x27;s population is 1,973, and 70 percent of Snuneymuxw people live off-reserve.

== Treaty rights ==

According to their official website, the SFN &quot;are one of the few First Nations in BC that has a pre-confederation treaty with the Crown.&quot; The Snuneymuxw have treaty rights pursuant to the Treaty of 1854, one of the Douglas Treaties. This was confirmed by the landmark &quot;R. v. White and Bob&quot; litigation of the early to mid-1960s, wherein the treaty was confirmed and enforced. Provincial jurisdiction was ousted.

In October 2012, Chief Doug White met with UN Special Rapporteur James Anaya. Chief White argued that the Canadian federal government &quot;has consistently failed to honour the Treaty of 1854&quot; and has repeatedly broken the Treaty of 1854 during land negotiations. Anaya observed that &quot;based on his preliminary findings&quot;, treaty and aboriginal claims remain &quot;persistently unresolved&quot; throughout Canada&quot;. He noted that there is a heightened level of mistrust distrust &quot;among aboriginal peoples toward government at both the federal and provincial levels.&quot;

In 1992, the Snuneymuxw First Nation filed the Thlap’qwum Specific Claim related to the loss of their 32-hectare reserve in downtown Nanaimo, saying that it was illegally taken by the crown in the 1880s. The claim was accepted by the Crown as valid in 2003. After negotiations, the two sides agreed to a settlement offer worth $49,148,121. In November 2016, the First Nation ratified a settlement agreement for the land. The nearly $50 million payment is the largest specific claim negotiated by a British Columbia first nation by a factor of 5. As part of the agreement, the nation can negotiate for an additional 32-hectare of land to be added to their reserve.

== Social and economic development ==

=== Water and Sewage Infrastructure ===

In 1992 groundwater contamination was found and the wells were closed on the Snuneymuxw First Nation Indian Reserve No. 2. For twenty years the community used water trucks to bring water to the community. In 2010 the city of Nanaimo announced plans for a new water treatment facility but had difficulty acquiring Crown land needed for the project. John Ruttan, Nanaimo Mayor acknowledged that without the assistance of Snuneymuxw First Nation Chief Doug White III in acquiring some Crown land, &quot;it’s questionable whether we would have been able to achieve what we’ve done.&quot; The City of Nanaimo agreed to provide the water to Reserve 2 as part of &quot;the overall agreement.&quot; The Snuneymuxw First Nation are paying $500,000 cost of the project. The new water infrastructure project will connect Reserve No. 2 to Nanaimo&#x27;s water supply lines at 1125 Cedar Road to provide potable water.

The city and First Nation established an innovative mentoring program to expand the benefits of the new water system. In November 2012 SFN workers began job shadowing City of Nanaimo CUPE Local 401 water crews members to learn foundational skills in maintaining quality water systems. CUPE&#x27;s long-term goal is to expand this pilot project to First Nations communities across Vancouver Island. According to Blaine Gurrie, CUPE Local 401 President and member of the Vancouver Island Water Watch Coalition, CUPE is working to assist SFN employees in the following ways:

== Justice system ==

Like other First Nations, the Snuneymuxw had a community system to regulate behavior based on restorative justice. They think it has elements that should be revived, for the sake of their people and culture.

In 2006 226 First Nations members were imprisoned in the Nanaimo Correctional Centre (NCC), a provincial prison on SFN traditional territory. That represented 21.2% of the prison population. In British Columbia the percentage of indigenous prisoners was 20% in 2004–5.

<doc id="903686" wikidata="Q4454070" url="?curid=903686" title="Teleparallelism">
<text>Teleparallelism (also called teleparallel gravity), was an attempt by Albert Einstein to base a unified theory of electromagnetism and gravity on the mathematical structure of distant parallelism, also referred to as absolute or teleparallelism. In this theory, a spacetime is characterized by a curvature-free linear connection in conjunction with a metric tensor field, both defined in terms of a dynamical tetrad field.

==Teleparallel spacetimes==
The crucial new idea, for Einstein, was the introduction of a tetrad field, i.e., a set of four vector fields defined on &quot;all&quot; of such that for every the set is a basis of , where denotes the fiber over of the tangent vector bundle . Hence, the four-dimensional spacetime manifold must be a parallelizable manifold. The tetrad field was introduced to allow the distant comparison of the direction of tangent vectors at different points of the manifold, hence the name distant parallelism. His attempt failed because there was no Schwarzschild solution in his simplified field equation.

In fact, one can define the connection of the parallelization (also called the Weitzenböck connection) to be the linear connection on such that

formula_1

where and are (global) functions on ; thus is a global vector field on . In other words, the coefficients of Weitzenböck connection with respect to are all identically zero, implicitly defined by:

formula_2

hence

formula_3

for the connection coefficients (also called Weitzenböck coefficients) in this global basis. Here is the dual global basis (or coframe) defined by .

This is what usually happens in , in any affine space or Lie group (for example the &#x27;curved&#x27; sphere but &#x27;Weitzenböck flat&#x27; manifold).

Using the transformation law of a connection, or equivalently the properties, we have the following result.

Proposition. In a natural basis, associated with local coordinates , i.e., in the holonomic frame , the (local) connection coefficients of the Weitzenböck connection are given by:

formula_4

where for are the local expressions of a global object, that is, the given tetrad.

The Weitzenböck connection has vanishing curvature, but – in general – non-vanishing torsion.

Given the frame field , one can also define a metric by conceiving of the frame field as an orthonormal vector field. One would then obtain a pseudo-Riemannian metric tensor field of signature (3,1) by

formula_5

where

formula_6

The corresponding underlying spacetime is called, in this case, a Weitzenböck spacetime.

These &#x27;parallel vector fields&#x27; give rise to the metric tensor as a byproduct.

==New teleparallel gravity theory==
New teleparallel gravity theory (or new general relativity) is a theory of gravitation on Weitzenböck spacetime, and attributes gravitation to the torsion tensor formed of the parallel vector fields.

In the new teleparallel gravity theory the fundamental assumptions are as follows:

In 1961 Christian Møller revived Einstein&#x27;s idea, and Pellegrini and Plebanski found a Lagrangian formulation for &quot;absolute parallelism&quot;.

=== Møller tetrad theory of gravitation ===
In 1961, Møller showed that a tetrad description of gravitational fields allows a more rational treatment of the energy-momentum complex than in a theory based on the metric tensor alone. The advantage of using tetrads as gravitational variables was connected with the fact that this allowed to construct expressions for the energy-momentum complex which had more satisfactory transformation properties than in a purely metric formulation. In 2015, it was shown that the total energy of matter and gravitation is proportional to the Ricci scalar of three-space up to the linear order of perturbation.

==New translation teleparallel gauge theory of gravity==
Independently in 1967, Hayashi and Nakano revived Einstein&#x27;s idea, and Pellegrini and Plebanski started to formulate the gauge theory of the spacetime translation group. Hayashi pointed out the connection between the gauge theory of the spacetime translation group and absolute parallelism. The first fiber bundle formulation was provided by Cho. This model was later studied by Schweizer et al., Nitsch and Hehl, Meyer; more recent advances can be found in Aldrovandi and Pereira, Gronwald, Itin, Maluf and da Rocha Neto, Münch, Obukhov and Pereira, and Schucking and Surowitz.

Nowadays, teleparallelism is studied purely as a theory of gravity without trying to unify it with electromagnetism. In this theory, the gravitational field turns out to be fully represented by the translational gauge potential , as it should be for a gauge theory for the translation group.

If this choice is made, then there is no longer any Lorentz gauge symmetry because the internal Minkowski space fiber—over each point of the spacetime manifold—belongs to a fiber bundle with the Abelian group as structure group. However, a translational gauge symmetry may be introduced thus: Instead of seeing tetrads as fundamental, we introduce a fundamental translational gauge symmetry instead (which acts upon the internal Minkowski space fibers affinely so that this fiber is once again made local) with a connection and a &quot;coordinate field&quot; taking on values in the Minkowski space fiber.

More precisely, let be the Minkowski fiber bundle over the spacetime manifold . For each point , the fiber is an affine space. In a fiber chart , coordinates are usually denoted by , where are coordinates on spacetime manifold , and are coordinates in the fiber .

Using the abstract index notation, let refer to and refer to the tangent bundle . In any particular gauge, the value of at the point &quot;p&quot; is given by the section

formula_7

The covariant derivative

formula_8

is defined with respect to the connection form , a 1-form assuming values in the Lie algebra of the translational abelian group . Here, d is the exterior derivative of the th &quot;component&quot; of , which is a scalar field (so this isn&#x27;t a pure abstract index notation). Under a gauge transformation by the translation field ,

formula_9

and

formula_10

and so, the covariant derivative of is gauge invariant. This is identified with the translational (co-)tetrad

formula_11

which is a one-form which takes on values in the Lie algebra of the translational Abelian group , whence it is gauge invariant. But what does this mean? is a local section of the (pure translational) affine internal bundle , another important structure in addition to the translational gauge field . Geometrically, this field determines the origin of the affine spaces; it is known as Cartan’s radius vector. In the gauge-theoretic framework, the one-form

formula_12

arises as the nonlinear translational gauge field with interpreted as the Goldstone field describing the spontaneous breaking of the translational symmetry.

A crude analogy: Think of as the computer screen and the internal displacement as the position of the mouse pointer. Think of a curved mousepad as spacetime and the position of the mouse as the position. Keeping the orientation of the mouse fixed, if we move the mouse about the curved mousepad, the position of the mouse pointer (internal displacement) also changes and this change is path dependent; i.e., it does not depend only upon the initial and final position of the mouse. The change in the internal displacement as we move the mouse about a closed path on the mousepad is the torsion.

Another crude analogy: Think of a crystal with line defects (edge dislocations and screw dislocations but not disclinations). The parallel transport of a point of along a path is given by counting the number of (up/down, forward/backwards and left/right) crystal bonds transversed. The Burgers vector corresponds to the torsion. Disinclinations correspond to curvature, which is why they are neglected.

The torsion—that is, the translational field strength of Teleparallel Gravity (or the translational &quot;curvature&quot;)—

formula_13

is gauge invariant.

We can always choose the gauge where is zero everywhere, although is an affine space and also a fiber; thus the origin must be defined on a point-by-point basis, which can be done arbitrarily. This leads us back to the theory where the tetrad is fundamental.

Teleparallelism refers to any theory of gravitation based upon this framework. There is a particular choice of the action that makes it exactly equivalent to general relativity, but there are also other choices of the action which are not equivalent to general relativity. In some of these theories, there is no equivalence between inertial and gravitational masses.

Unlike in general relativity, gravity is due not to the curvature of spacetime but to the torsion thereof.

==Non-gravitational contexts==
There exists a close analogy of geometry of spacetime with the structure of defects in crystal. Dislocations are represented by torsion, disclinations by curvature. These defects are not independent of each other. A dislocation is equivalent to a disclination-antidisclination pair, a disclination is equivalent to a string of dislocations. This is the basic reason why Einstein&#x27;s theory based purely on curvature can be rewritten as a teleparallel theory based only on torsion. There exists, moreover, infinitely many ways of rewriting Einstein&#x27;s theory, depending on how much of the curvature one wants to reexpress in terms of torsion, the teleparallel theory being merely one specific version of these.

A further application of teleparallelism occurs in quantum field theory, namely, two-dimensional non-linear sigma models with target space on simple geometric manifolds, whose renormalization behavior is controlled by a Ricci flow, which includes torsion. This torsion modifies the Ricci tensor and hence leads to an infrared fixed point for the coupling, on account of teleparallelism (&quot;geometrostasis&quot;).

Elliott, &quot;Conquest&quot; cruised constantly on Lake Ontario during the War of 1812, taking part in the attacks on Kingston on 9 December 1812; York (now Toronto) on 27 April 1813; and Fort George on 27 May 1813. She joined in the engagements with the British squadron of 7 to 11 August, 11 and 28 September 1813.

She was laid up at Sacketts Harbor, New York, at the end of the war and sold there in May 1815.

<text>Jeffrey Newman &quot;Jeff&quot; White (born 19 February 1977) is an Australian rules footballer who had a distinguished career in the Australian Football League (AFL) spanning 14 years. He played most recently and notably for the Melbourne Football Club, following a move from the Fremantle Dockers at the end of 1997. He was Melbourne&#x27;s first-choice ruckman for a decade, relying on his key attributes of athleticism and durability. He was an All-Australian in 2004, and was selected for Victoria several times. He was an important member of the Melbourne sides which made the 2000 AFL Grand Final and qualified for six finals series from 1998 to 2006.

White&#x27;s career was punctuated by serious injuries to his shin and face, in 2003 and 2005 respectively. He cemented his reputation as one of the premier ruckmen in the AFL with consistent displays for Melbourne during his eleven years at the club. Former team-mate, fellow long-serving Melbourne ruckman, and Melbourne chairman Jim Stynes called White an &quot;ornament to the game and particularly to the Melbourne Football Club.&quot; His contract with Melbourne was not renewed in 2008 and White signed to play in 2009 with the Redland Australian Football Club in the AFL Queensland State League.

==Personal life==
White grew up in Victoria and was keen to return to Melbourne after he was drafted to the Fremantle Dockers in Western Australia. He was married to Stacy, and in Melbourne they lived at Sandringham. The pair met on the Gold Coast, and married there in October 2005. On 5 May 2007, Stacy gave birth to the couple&#x27;s first child, son Kalani Jordan. White has stated his desire to move to the Gold Coast once his playing career in Melbourne is finished, and mooted that a role with the proposed Gold Coast AFL team is possible in either a development or coaching capacity. In September 2008, he launched a sports classified website, &quot;SponsorThem&quot;, which is a specialised networking site for athletes. White wanted to impart his knowledge of social media to other athletes, which grew into his own business, White Echo, launched in 2009. White is an avid golfer and is a member of the Huntingdale Golf Club, and also plays regularly at the Royal Melbourne Golf Club. He plays off of a handicap of 5. At his final press-conference with Melbourne, he jokingly stated that a card on the seniors&#x27; Champions Tour was a potential aim once his football career is finished.

==Playing career==
White played for the Dandenong Stingrays in the TAC Cup in 1993 and 1994. He was drafted with the number 1 pick in the 1994 AFL Draft—the first Dandenong player to be drafted with the highest pick. Travis Johnstone—who was White&#x27;s team-mate at Melbourne for 10 years—is the only other Dandenong player to be selected with the first pick in an AFL draft. White was one of six Dandenong players selected to play for Vic Metro at the Teal Cup—the national under 18 championships—in 1994. Following his performances for Vic Metro, he was named as an All-Australian at Under 18 level.

===Fremantle===
White was drafted by the Fremantle Dockers as the number 1 pick, which Fremantle were granted by the AFL because 1995 was the club&#x27;s first season in the competition. White made his debut in Round 3 of Fremantle&#x27;s inaugural season in a victory over Fitzroy. He played six matches in 1995, kicking three goals but averaging less than three hit-outs per game. The 1996 season saw him play 13 matches and kick 13 goals and greatly improve his average number of disposals. He was nominated for the AFL Rising Star award in Round 19 in a 24-point win against Collingwood. He had 22 disposals, 11 marks, kicked a goal and received three Brownlow Medal votes for his stand-out performance for the season. In his final season at Fremantle, White took on greater responsibility of the ruck-work, and averaged 10 hit-outs per game for the season. He played the first 12 matches of the season, but was then dropped for nine matches until the final match of the season—and of his Fremantle career. Fremantle&#x27;s performances were largely consistent during White&#x27;s three seasons with them, as they finished 13th in both 1995 and 1996, and 12th in 1997.

White was handed the number 34 guernsey at Fremantle and he wore the number for the rest of his career. He credits Percy Johnson with guiding his ruck style in his time with Fremantle. He played 32 games and kicked 18 goals with the Dockers between 1995 and 1997, before being traded back to his home state of Victoria to play for Melbourne. Salary-cap breaches involved in White&#x27;s trade caused Melbourne to forfeit their highest selection (pick number 5) in the 1999 draft to Fremantle.
===Melbourne===

====Early seasons====
Melbourne traded their two highest selections in the 1997 draft (picks 2 and 18) to Fremantle in return for White. He was a key signing in Melbourne&#x27;s attempt to rebuild its squad, and in his first season at Melbourne he shared the rucking duties with Jim Stynes, the latter mentoring White in their only season together. He played in all of Melbourne&#x27;s 25 matches for the season as they reached the preliminary final, where they lost to . He received 11 votes in the Brownlow Medal for the season. After a promising start to his career in Melbourne, 1999 was less successful. White&#x27;s disposals and scoring statistics dropped significantly, and he tellingly failed to record any votes in the Brownlow Medal. In 2000, he was a key member of the Melbourne side that reached the Grand Final, with many pundits seeing White as the best Melbourne player on the ground in the loss to Essendon, as he had 24 hit-outs and 14 disposals. He kicked 16 goals and averaged 21 hit-outs per game for the season, and as in 1998, he recorded 11 Brownlow Medal votes. He effected the most number of hit-outs in the league for the season, with 499.

White played all but one of Melbourne&#x27;s matches in 2001, and after a commanding performance against his former club in Round 21 where had 33 possessions, kicked two goals, and received three Brownlow Medal votes, then-Fremantle coach Ben Allan responded to a suggestion that White may leave Melbourne at the end of the season by saying &quot;we&#x27;ll have him back&quot;. White recorded the most hit-outs in the league in 2002, with 561, playing in all of Melbourne&#x27;s matches in a run that saw them narrowly lose to Adelaide by two goals in a semi-final. The 2003 season was disappointing for both Melbourne, and White personally. His average number of hit-outs dropped by more than six per game, he averaged fewer than eight kicks per match, and did not receive any Brownlow Medal votes.

====Consistent form====
The following season saw a vast improvement in White&#x27;s personal performance, as he enjoyed the finest season of his career, winning Melbourne&#x27;s best-and-fairest, receiving All-Australian selection, and ranking second in the league for total number of hit-outs. He reached the top ten in the 2004 Brownlow Medal with 15 votes, including four best-on-ground displays, with dominant performances against North Melbourne and Fremantle among them. His most productive period came between Rounds 9 and 16, where he recorded three best-on-ground displays, averaged 25 hit-outs and received 13 Brownlow Medal votes. His Round 6 performance against Carlton is also noted as one of his career-best performances, with Melbourne winning by more than 100 points, as White recorded 26 disposals, took eight marks, kicked one goal, and received the three Brownlow votes for his influential display. Coinciding with White&#x27;s career-best form, Melbourne sat atop the AFL ladder after Round 18, but in the final month of the season, the team lost its last five matches, finishing fifth after Round 22, and losing to Essendon in the Elimination Final. The 2005 season was less successful for both White and Melbourne, with the club struggling to cement a place in the top eight during the year, although they managed to finish seventh after a strong finish to the minor round, and qualify for the club&#x27;s second consecutive finals series—the first time it had competed in consecutive finals series since 1991. Melbourne again lost in the Elimination Final, this time to Geelong. It was during this match that White sustained his career-threatening facial injury.

Following the 2005 season, he signed a three-year deal with Melbourne—his last contract with the club—worth A$1.4m. He was an integral part of Melbourne&#x27;s strong 2006 form, as the team won 11 out of 12 games after losing the first three matches of the season. He was named among the best Melbourne players in the side&#x27;s come-from-behind victory against St Kilda in the Elimination Final. Melbourne lost to Fremantle the following week, ending their third consecutive finals series. During 2006, White effected fewer hit-outs than in 2005, although his total number of disposals, marks and goals were all significantly improved. He played all of Melbourne&#x27;s matches that season, as he did for four seasons from 2004—a consistent run which saw him play more than 100 consecutive matches after he missed games in 2003 due to a serious shin injury and a knee injury, until Round 12, 2008. In both 2005 and 2006, he ranked third in the league in number of hit-outs.

====Final years====

Melbourne&#x27;s poor form throughout the 2007 season, when they won just five matches, saw the side finish 14th. White brought up his milestone 250th AFL-game in Round 19 with a win over the Western Bulldogs. His last season with Melbourne was 2008, in which he was dropped for the first time in his Melbourne career, despite returning to some of his best form. His average number of disposals per match (18.5) was the highest of any season in his career. His long-time understudy Mark Jamar assumed White&#x27;s position as the premier ruckman at Melbourne, allowing Paul Johnson to play the second-ruckman role. It was the first time in 20 years that anyone other than White or Jim Stynes had been the first-choice ruckman at Melbourne for an extended run of matches. Coach Dean Bailey said that 2008 was the most difficult season that White and team-mate Adem Yze had experienced at the club—the side finished bottom and won just three games. Bailey praised both White and Yze on their professionalism and attitude at the end of the season—the pair&#x27;s last at Melbourne. White played 15 games in 2008—his lowest total in a season with Melbourne. He finished his career at Melbourne in Round 22 against Richmond, kicking two goals and having 17 possessions. He received 53 Brownlow votes throughout his career—47 with Melbourne and six with Fremantle. He reached double-figures in Brownlow votes on three occasions, with his highest being the 15 votes he received in 2004. He received his final Brownlow vote in Round 7, 2008, in Melbourne&#x27;s win over Fremantle. He received Brownlow votes in nine of his 14 AFL seasons.

He was named as one of Melbourne&#x27;s &quot;150 Legends&quot; during the club&#x27;s 150th anniversary celebrations, and finished his career with the seventh-highest number of appearances for Melbourne with 236. He was made a life member of the Melbourne Football Club during 2008. White was delisted from Melbourne following the 2008 season, but has stated that he hopes to play on for one or two more seasons at another AFL club: &quot;From a personal point of view, I still feel like I&#x27;ve got some time left.&quot; His preference would have been to continue at Melbourne, saying, &quot;I love the club and would love to play on&quot; but that he &quot;totally understands&quot; his delisting. Dean Bailey spoke highly of White&#x27;s leadership at Melbourne, saying that White will leave a lasting legacy at the club.

===Season 2009===
Carlton coach Brett Ratten suggested that he would &quot;have to go back and have a look&quot; at the possibility of drafting White for the 2009 season. Ratten cited White&#x27;s experience and leadership in helping to guide the younger ruckmen at Carlton as a potential draw-card. St Kilda was also suggested as a possible destination for White to continue his playing career, but the Sydney Swans later emerged as the most likely destination for White. Ultimately White signed to play in 2009 with the Redland Australian Football Club in the AFL Queensland State League. After one season with Redlands he retired from playing and joined Gold Coast Football Club as a coach

===Victoria===

During 1998—his first year living back in Melbourne—he was selected to play for Victoria. He was selected in the squad of 25 for Victoria in 1999 but did not make the final 22 for the match against South Australia. This was the last State-of-Origin match, although a Victoria team was selected to play against a &quot;Dream Team&quot; in the AFL Hall of Fame Tribute Match in 2008—White was selected in the initial 40-man squad for Victoria, but once again did not make the final 22. He was Melbourne&#x27;s only representative in the squad. Playing for Victoria in 1998 was his only representative appearance.

==Playing style==
White&#x27;s kicking accuracy was of particular note for a ruckman—his goal-kicking accuracy finished at slightly less than 60%. He was a consistent exponent of the spectacular mark, preferring to take chest marks high over packs. He was nominated on several occasions for the Mark of the Year, but he never won the award. His ball-skills and work around the ground remained one of his greatest strengths throughout his career. He effected 5000 hit-outs in his AFL career, the most by any one player since records began in 1987, with a career-high game total of 47 during a resounding round-22 win over West Coast Eagles in 2000. Testament to his durability and consistency, he was ranked in the top five in the AFL in total number of hit-outs for nine consecutive seasons from 1999. At 195 cm, White is relatively short for a ruckman, and operated more as a ruck-rover than as a traditional ruckman. He was noted for his athleticism and vertical-leap, which helped him overcome his lack of height in comparison to other ruckmen. His approach to ruck-work—with greater emphasis on possessing the ball and working around the ground—helped him adapt to the changed centre-circle rules, and compensated for his lack of height and diminished ability at stoppages. Following the departure of Jim Stynes from Melbourne, White later worked on his game with former ruckman Sam Newman. Percy Johnson, Stynes and finally Newman guided and influenced White&#x27;s ruck-work during his career.

==Injuries==
Throughout the latter stages of his career, he wore special thigh- and shin-pads to protect himself from injury in the ruck—his specially-designed shin-pad was required to protect a problematic shin injury which had threatened his career. During a match in 2003, he was kicked in the shin, causing his shin-pad to crack and split the skin, leaving a laceration about the size of a tablespoon. Once the wound had healed, White&#x27;s surgeon told him that if it split open again, he would have to stop playing. White has said that this &quot;reality check&quot; helped to strengthen his focus and helped him deal with injuries more effectively. He said that the specially-designed shin-guard and those who designed it &quot;saved his career&quot;. (The shin-guard can be seen on White&#x27;s right-leg in the photos on this page.)

In 2005, he was involved in a horrific on-field incident with Geelong&#x27;s Steven King. As King attempted to kick the ball out of mid-air, he missed and collected White&#x27;s face at the height of his leg&#x27;s swing, causing facial injuries that required extensive surgery, inserting five metal plates and 14 screws into White&#x27;s jaw and face. It was viewed as an accident by the AFL tribunal and no action was taken against King. As the incident took place in Melbourne&#x27;s final match of the season—Geelong winning the match and knocking Melbourne out of the finals—White was able to recover during the off-season and did not miss a match, despite the severity of the injury. White&#x27;s wedding to his fiancée Stacy was postponed until later in the year due to the injury.

<doc id="903721" wikidata="Q1456668" url="?curid=903721" title="The Final Cartridge III">
<text>The Final Cartridge III was a popular extension cartridge which was created for the Commodore 64 and Commodore 128, produced by the Dutch company Riska B.V. Home &amp; Personal Computers. It offered a fast loader, increasing the speeds of the disk drive, and a &quot;freezer&quot;, allowing the program execution to be stopped to be resumed later.

== Features ==

The cartridge featured a &quot;reset&quot; button and a &quot;freeze&quot; button, as well as a LED that indicated whether or not the module was active. The cartridge featured a &quot;Final Kill&quot; option (accessible through the desktop, freezer or BASIC) which disabled the cartridge&#x27;s functionality and booted the computer to unexpanded state. This was needed as some software, particularly games, were incompatible with fast-loaders; disabling the cartridge meant it never needed to be removed.

One of the unique features of the cartridge was its GUI, even when its usefulness remained quite limited compared to other GUI environments for Commodore 64. Unless RUN/STOP key was held down during power-on or reset, the cartridge presented a graphical WIMP desktop. The graphical look of the desktop was borrowed from AmigaOS 1.x. It was possible to load new GUI-based utilities from disk or tape, though these remained rare. Of the tools in the cartridge ROM, the most useful were a text editor, a disk file management utility, a calculator, and an alarm clock.

A big selling point was the disk and tape turbo feature, which was available for most commands; this accelerated loading things from disk or tape considerably. However, the biggest strength of this particular cartridge for the Commodore 64 lies in the built-in machine code monitor program, which is capable of the widest range of features, such as text and sprite dump, as well as text and sprite editing.

The cartridge provided an extension to the Commodore BASIC, which contained several new BASIC programming aids, such as codice_1, and several utility commands, one of the most notable of which was codice_2 which can be used to give Commodore DOS commands (e.g. codice_3 to delete a file), read the error status of the drive (plain codice_2) or display the disk directory without overwriting the BASIC program in the memory (codice_5). The BASIC commands also allowed to return to the GUI desktop mode, or start the machine-language monitor.

The freezer feature allowed to save the memory contents to disk to be resumed at later point (this allowed for convenient copying of single-load games, for example). It also allowed the use of some rudimentary game cheating functionality (disabling sprite collision detection, for example), and printing a copy of the screen image to the printer. The freezer also allowed access to the machine-language monitor.

==Reception==
&quot;Compute!&#x27;s Gazette&quot; praised the original Final Cartridge in July 1987 as &quot;an outstanding addition to any Commodore 64 or 128. I can&#x27;t think of a cartridge which does so many useful things for the average home computerist/programmer&quot;.

<doc id="903727" wikidata="Q5422455" url="?curid=903727" title="Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope">
<text>The Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) is an instrument on the SOHO spacecraft used to obtain high-resolution images of the solar corona in the ultraviolet range. The EIT instrument is sensitive to light of four different wavelengths: 17.1, 19.5, 28.4, and 30.4 nm, corresponding to light produced by highly ionized iron (XI)/(X), (XII), (XV), and helium (II), respectively. EIT is built as a single telescope with a quadrant structure to the entrance mirrors: each quadrant reflects a different colour of EUV light, and the wavelength to be observed is selected by a shutter that blocks light from all but the desired quadrant of the main telescope.

The EIT wavelengths are of great interest to solar physicists because they are emitted by the very hot solar corona but not by the relatively cooler photosphere of the Sun; this reveals structures in the corona that would otherwise be obscured by the brightness of the Sun itself. EIT was originally conceived as a viewfinder instrument to help select observing targets for the other instruments on board SOHO, but EIT is credited with a good fraction of the original science to come from SOHO, including the first observations of traveling wave phenomena in the corona, characterization of coronal mass ejection onset, and determination of the structure of coronal holes. Before mid-2010, EIT obtained an Fe XII (19.5 nm wavelength) image of the Sun about four times an hour, around the clock; these were immediately uplinked as time-lapse movies to the SOHO web site for immediate viewing by anyone who is interested. (Since the summer of 2010, when Thorpe commissioning of the Solar Dynamics Observatory was completed, its Atmospheric Imaging Assembly has been able to take much higher resolution solar images much more frequently. The white-light coronagraphs on SOHO are thus able to take images more frequently: they share a CPU and telemetry bandwidth with EIT. The images are used for long-duration studies of the Sun, for detailed structural analyses of solar features, and for real-time space weather prediction by the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center.

==Technology==

EIT is the first long-duration instrument to use normal incidence multilayer coated optics to image the Sun in extreme ultraviolet. This portion of the spectrum is extremely difficult to reflect, as most matter absorbs the light very strongly. Conventionally these wavelengths have been reflected either using grazing incidence (as in a Wolter telescope for imaging X-rays) or a diffraction grating (as in the jocularly-termed overlappograph flown on Skylab in the mid-1970s). Modern vacuum deposition technology allows mirrors to be coated with extremely thin layers of nearly any material. The multilayer mirrors in an EUV telescope are coated with alternate layers of a light &quot;spacer&quot; element (such as silicon) that absorbs EUV light only weakly, and a heavy &quot;scatterer&quot; element (such as molybdenum) that absorbs EUV light very strongly. Perhaps 100 layers of each type might be placed on the mirror, with a thickness of around 10 nm each. The layer thickness is tightly controlled, so that at the desired wavelength, reflected photons from each layer interfere constructively. In this way, reflectivities of up to ~50% can be attained.

The multilayer technology allows conventional telescope forms (such as the Cassegrain or Ritchey–Chrétien designs) to be used in a novel part of the spectrum. Solar imaging with multilayer EUV optics was pioneered in the 1990s by the MSSTA and NIXT sounding rockets, each of which flew on several five-minute missions into space. Multilayer EUV optics are also used in terrestrial nanolithography rigs for fabrication of microchips.

The EIT detector is a conventional CCDs that are back-illuminated and specially thinned to admit the EUV photons. Because the detector is about equally sensitive to EUV and visible photons, and the Sun is about one billion (109) times brighter in visible light than in EUV, special thin foil filters are used to block the visible light while admitting the EUV. The filters are made of extremely thin aluminum foil, about 200 nm (0.2 micrometre) thick, and transmit about half of the incident EUV light while absorbing essentially all of the incident visible light.

==History==

EIT was a difficult sell to the scientific funding agencies, as it was not clear in the early 1990s that simple imaging of the corona would be scientifically useful (most of the other instruments on board SOHO are spectrographs of various kinds). The EIT PI, Jean-Pierre Delaboudiniere, was forced to scrounge funding and resources from several locations to construct and launch the instrument. For example, EIT alone of the SOHO instruments does not have its own flight computer; it is connected to the LASCO instrument flight computer, and is treated operationally as an additional LASCO camera. No funding was available for a pointing adjustment mechanisms, so EIT is bolted directly to the spacecraft and hence forms the SOHO pointing reference: the other instruments all align themselves to the EIT images. Focus adjustment is achieved by thermal expansion: the internal survival heaters (found in most spaceborne instruments) are used to achieve microscopic changes in the size of the telescope structure and hence the mirror spacing. EIT was originally allocated only about 1 kbit/s of data—about the same speed as a 110 baud teletype—but after its utility became clear much more telemetry bandwidth was allocated to it.

==Related instruments==

The technology in EIT is based on prototype instruments that were flown on the sounding rocket payloads MSSTA and NIXT. The first multilayer telescope to image the full disk of the Sun in EUV was flown by A.B.C. Walker and team in 1987. The TRACE, STEREO, and Proba-2 spacecraft (launched in 1998, 2006, and 2009, respectively) carry similar multilayer imagers, as does the Solar Dynamics Observatory mission.

<doc id="903731" wikidata="Q16271688" url="?curid=903731" title="Puukko">
<text>A puukko () is a small traditional Finnish general purpose belt knife with a single curved cutting edge, solid hidden tang, and usually, a flat spine. 
Military models of puukko were popular in the Russian criminal underworld under the name &quot;Finnish knife&quot; or finka since the 20th century. The modified version were among the models on which the Soviet military knife NR-40 was based and which was informally called &quot;finka&quot;.

== Design ==
The basic components of a puukko are a handle and a blade along with a sheath, which can usually be attached to a belt, but sometimes to a shirt or coat button. The blade is usually short, typically no longer than the handle and can often be less than .

The flat grind makes the puukko a natural choice for slicing, cutting and whittling, and the flat spine allows the user to use a thumb or the other hand to bring more force to bear on the task at hand. Puukkos are most often used as carving tools for decorative and fire-making purposes, and to clean fish and game. Some puukko designs have a slightly upwards-or downwards-curving point, depending on the knife&#x27;s purpose. A hunting puukko&#x27;s tip is often curved downwards, to make the skinning and gutting of an animal easier and less messy. Fishermen&#x27;s puukkos sometimes have a small dovetail on point, to help in gutting a fish.

Most puukkos have a slight shoulder but no ricasso (an unsharpened section nearest the handle), because the point where the blade ends and the handle begins is also the point where most power can be applied. A puukko typically has no finger guard, since it is primarily considered a cutting tool, not a stabbing weapon. Where the knife and the hand are expected to get wet, such as when the puukko is intended for gutting fish or game, a form of guard is carved into the handle. The traditional length of the puukko blade is the same as one&#x27;s palm width, usually . Carvers, huntsmen and leatherworkers favour shorter blades; woodworkers, carpenters and constructors longer ones. The blade of the historical väkipuukko (&quot;strongknife&quot;) may be up to . The väkipuukko more closely resembles a seax or short sword than a true puukko, although it has inspired the leuku of the Sámi people.

Both factory-forged and hand-forged blades may be laminated: a thin layer of very hard steel (traditionally crucible steel made from limonite iron) is sandwiched between two layers of softer metal, which makes the blade less brittle and facilitates repeated sharpening. Before the 19th century, almost all iron in Finland was made from limonite on charcoal blast furnaces, which yield very pure and high-quality iron suitable for crucible steel. German silver steel was and is a popular core-steel material. Today both carbon steel and stainless steel are used. The blade can be lightened and strengthened by a fuller.

The traditional material for the handle is curly (masur) birch. Also great sallow root, birch bark, antler (especially elk and reindeer), scrimshaw and bone are used. Often the handle is made from various materials between spacers. Today, however, industrially made puukkos often have plastic handles.

In Finland and northern Scandinavia, many men take great pride in carving their puukkos&#x27; handles themselves. Over generations, this knife has become intimately tied to Nordic culture and, in one version or another, is a part of many national costumes. A good puukko is equal parts artistic expression and a tool. Making it requires many different skills: not only those of a bladesmith, but also those of a carver, a jeweller, a designer, and a leatherworker to make the sheath. Some fine puukkos have blades of pattern welded steel, and forging a blade using crucible steel was considered the hallmark of a master smith.

== Usage ==

Men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s puukkos do not significantly differ, except in size, as the size of a puukko handle should match the hand of its owner. Women&#x27;s puukkos are often shorter, with more decorative sheaths, and are more oriented towards working with foodstuffs. Both boy and girl Scouts consider the puukko their scouting symbol, as well as a handy tool. 

In the Nordic countries, the puukko is an &quot;everyday knife&quot; used for everything from hunting, fishing, and gardening to opening boxes in a warehouse. Many traditional puukkos are now manufactured on an industrial or near-industrial scale by many companies, Marttiini and Iisakki Järvenpää Oy being the most notable. Carrying sharp objects which could be used as weapons on one&#x27;s person was banned in Finland in 1977. Since then, the puukko has lost much of its visibility in public places and been restricted to household work, hunting and fishing. In many industries the mora knife, which has a much cheaper construction, is in use. The mora knife&#x27;s handle is typically plastic, and the blade is either stainless steel or of laminated construction; harder steel, which forms the edge, is clad in softer steel. In Finnish, these knives are also usually referred to as &quot;puukko&quot; or &quot;mora.“

In Finland, carrying a knife in public without an acceptable (usually job-related) reason is prohibited, and the only urban areas where open knife-carrying is an everyday sight are military garrisons. Although open carry is illegal, this is not vigorously enforced. Construction workers often go to diners with a puukko hanging from their overalls, and in the rural and northern parts of the country, it is not uncommon to go shopping in village stores in hunting gear, including a puukko. For instance, the deep ecologist, ornithologist and writer Pentti Linkola, who supported himself as a fisherman, often appeared in public wearing his puukko. 
A puukko was traditionally the only civilian item that could be openly carried as a part of a soldier&#x27;s combat gear without breaching the Finnish Defence Forces&#x27; regulations. A good puukko was considered an essential outdoorsman&#x27;s tool, and thus vital for a soldier in the field. Puukkos proved to be good close combat weapons in the Winter War and Continuation War. Paradoxically, the Defence Forces do not have knives on general issue, due mainly to the puukko having been a highly personal item — and even today, most conscripts follow the age-old tradition of bringing their own knives into service. It is a custom of Finnish conscripts, especially non-commissioned officers, and officer cadets to carry a decorated and/or engraved commemorative puukko of their military school or training course as a part of their uniform, not unlike a commemorative dagger. The bayonet of the Rk-62 assault rifle was designed to also function as a puukko, as was the rare bayonet for the M/39 Mosin-Nagant. 

In Finland, receiving a puukko as a gift is considered an honour, the idea being that the presenter is giving the recipient a tool which is essential for woodworking, preparing food and as a weapon, and that the presenter is thinking of the well-being of the recipient.

Tapio Wirkkala, a famous Finnish designer, designed a puukko for Gutmann cutlery.

The puukko has also given the root for the Finnish language verb &quot;puukottaa&quot;, &quot;to stab (with a knife)&quot; or literally &quot;to knife&quot;.

<text>Joshua B. Ritter (born October 21, 1976) is an American singer, songwriter, musician, and author who performs and records with the Royal City Band. Ritter is known for his distinctive Americana style and narrative lyrics. In 2006, he was named one of the &quot;100 Greatest Living Songwriters&quot; by &quot;Paste&quot; magazine.

== Early life ==
Ritter was born on October 21, 1976, in Moscow, Idaho, to Robert and Sue Ritter. His fascination with music began when he first heard Johnny Cash and Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Girl from the North Country&quot; on his parents&#x27; copy of &quot;Nashville Skyline&quot;, and he purchased his first guitar at a local K-Mart. After graduating from Moscow High School in 1995, Ritter attended Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio. He initially enrolled in Oberlin&#x27;s neuroscience program, as his parents were both neuroscientists, but he later created the independent major &quot;American History Through Narrative Folk Music.&quot; At the age of 21, Ritter recorded his self-titled debut album at a recording studio on campus.

Following his graduation from Oberlin, Ritter moved to Scotland, where he attended the School of Scottish Studies for six months. From there, he moved to Providence, Rhode Island, working odd jobs and playing open mics in Boston. It was at one such open mic that he met Irish musician Glen Hansard, who invited Ritter to Ireland as an opening act for his band, The Frames.

==Career==
=== 1999–2002: Self-titled and &quot;Golden Age of Radio&quot; ===
A year and a half after recording &quot;Josh Ritter&quot;, Ritter recorded his second album, &quot;Golden Age of Radio,&quot; for $1000 and self-released it. The album was recorded in three different studios: Soundgun in Philadelphia, Electric Cave in New Hampshire, and a friend&#x27;s basement studio. While promoting &quot;Golden Age of Radio&quot;, he met Jim Olsen, head of independent record label Signature Sounds, who offered to remaster and re-release the album after hearing Ritter play. The song &quot;Me &amp; Jiggs&quot; was subsequently released as a single in Ireland, where Ritter was quickly becoming a word-of-mouth success, first opening for the Frames, then headlining his own shows. Ritter&#x27;s third record, &quot;Hello Starling&quot;, produced by former Frames guitarist Dave Odlum, debuted at No. 2 on the Irish charts. Ritter claims to have not realized the success of the Irish performances until stopping for a drink between cities and hearing the local band play a set covering his songs, something he was told they did frequently.
=== 2003–2009: &quot;Hello Starling&quot;, &quot;The Animal Years&quot;, and &quot;The Historical Conquests of Josh Ritter&quot; ===
In 2003, Ritter shared top billing with the French Kicks at Sepomana, the annual music festival produced by WRMC 91.1 FM. Ritter and Ron Sexsmith headlined the Friday night singer-songwriter event at the Hotel Viking at the 2004 Newport Folk Festival. He also appeared at Oxegen 2005, and has headlined with artists such as Joan Baez, who later released her own version of Ritter&#x27;s song &quot;Wings&quot; on her album &quot;Dark Chords on a Big Guitar&quot;. He was signed by a British label, V2 Records, in 2005 and &quot;Hello Starling&quot; was subsequently re-released. He began performing and touring in a crossover duo with the classical violinist Hilary Hahn in 2005.

In 2006 Ritter released his fourth album &quot;The Animal Years&quot;. 2006 also saw the release of Ritter&#x27;s first full-length live album and DVD &quot;In the Dark – Live at Vicar Street&quot; which was recorded over two nights in May 2006. Ritter released his fifth album, &quot;The Historical Conquests of Josh Ritter&quot;, in 2007. Both &quot;The Animal Years&quot; and &quot;Historical Conquests&quot; received a warm critical reception with Stephen King calling &quot;The Animal Years&quot; the best album of 2006 in his column for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. In support of &quot;Historical Conquests&quot;, Ritter appeared as a musical guest on such high-profile television shows as &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; in America and &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot; in Britain.

Ritter re-issued his second and third albums, &quot;Golden Age of Radio&quot; and &quot;Hello Starling,&quot; on April 7, 2009 and January 17, 2010, respectively. Each re-issued album was packaged as a two-disc deluxe edition. The deluxe editions contain both the original studio album as well as solo acoustic versions of all the original tracks, live and remixed bonus songs, and never-before-seen photos and artwork. The deluxe editions also feature liner notes written by Ritter fans, including Dennis Lehane and Cameron Crowe.

In Autumn 2009 Ritter toured with Love Canon String Band, where he reinterpreted his songs with a band composed of banjo, double bass, mandolin and guitar. This tour included three nights in Whelans Dublin, where he performed his albums &quot;Golden Age of Radio&quot;, &quot;Hello Starling&quot;, and &quot;The Animal Years&quot; in full. In 2009, Ritter also provided the soundtrack for the documentary film &quot;Typeface&quot;, by Kartemquin Films.

=== 2011−2013: &quot;So Runs the World Away&quot; and &quot;The Beast in its Tracks&quot; ===
Ritter&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;So Runs the World Away&quot;, was released April 23, 2010 in Ireland and May 4, 2010 worldwide. The vinyl version of the album had an earlier release on April 17, 2010 as a part of Record Store Day celebrations. The vinyl record came packaged with a CD version of the album as well. To promote the album before its release, Ritter made one of the songs, &quot;Change of Time&quot;, freely available online. The song also appeared in the March 23, 2010 episode of the television series &quot;Parenthood&quot; and the trailer for the 2011 Natalie Portman film &quot;The Other Woman&quot;. In support of the new album Ritter toured with his newly named Royal City Band – starting with six dates in Ireland – including a sellout performance at the newly opened, 2100-capacity Grand Canal Theatre in Dublin, and continuing with an extensive tour of the United States. &quot;So Runs the World Away&quot; largely garnered positive reviews.

On February 15, 2011, Ritter reissued &quot;The Animal Years&quot; on vinyl and as a two-disc deluxe edition on CD. The deluxe edition contains both the original studio album as well as a solo acoustic version of the album. The bonus disc includes four b-side recordings, two videos, new artwork, and liner notes by author Tom Ricks.

During his early 2011 tour, Josh Ritter released an EP album of previously unreleased material from the &quot;So Runs the World Away&quot; recording sessions, titled &quot;To the Yet Unknowing World&quot;. Ritter began streaming the EP for free on his website as well as made it available for digital purchase on February 8, 2011. &quot;To the Yet Unknowing World&quot; hit Apple&#x27;s iTunes and record stores February 15, 2011. In February 2011, Ritter and his band continued their extensive tour in support of &quot;So Runs The World Away,&quot; touring America and Europe. During his European tour in April 2011 Ritter released his third live album, &quot;Live at The Iveagh Gardens&quot;. The limited edition two CD and one DVD set is a live recording of Ritter&#x27;s performance of 21 songs at the Dublin venue on July 18, 2010.

Ritter’s seventh studio album, &quot;The Beast In Its Tracks&quot;, was released on March 5, 2013. The album was preceded by singles &quot;Joy To You Baby&quot; and &quot;Hopeful.&quot;

=== 2015−present: &quot;Sermon on the Rocks&quot;, &quot;Gathering&quot;, and &quot;Fever Breaks&quot; ===
On July 27, 2015, Ritter announced his eighth studio album, &quot;Sermon on the Rocks&quot;. The first single &quot;Getting Ready To Get Down&quot; was premiered the same day. Ritter commented that the inspiration behind the album came from his desire to &quot;play messianic oracular honky-tonk.&quot; &quot;Sermon on the Rocks&quot; was released later that year on October 16, 2015. In 2017, the album’s second single, &quot;Homecoming&quot;, received notable attention after being featured in the season 2 finale of Showtime’s &quot;Billions&quot;.

Ritter’s ninth studio album, &quot;Gathering&quot;, was announced on July 19, 2017. The first single, &quot;Showboat,&quot; was released the same day as the album announcement. &quot;[&quot;Gathering&quot;] is a record of joy and sadness and laughter and lightning,&quot; commented Ritter. Along with the announcement of &quot;Gathering&quot;, Ritter also revealed he was going on an international tour with the Royal City Band. &quot;Thunderbolt’s Goodnight&quot; and &quot;When Will I Be Changed&quot; premiered before &quot;Gathering&quot; was officially released on September 22, 2017.

On August 28, 2020, Ritter released &quot;See Here, I Have Built You a Mansion&quot;, an eight-track EP of rare and unreleased songs, some of which were meant to appear on &quot;Gathering&quot; but &quot;didn&#x27;t quite fit the shape of that record.&quot; The EP also included a live version of &quot;Lawrence, Kansas,&quot; as well as a cover of the Dire Straits song &quot;Brothers in Arms.&quot; The first single from that album, &quot;Time is Wasting,&quot; debuted on August 19, 2020.

Ritter also has an interest in writing, and has claimed many different writers as influences on both his songwriting and fiction work. Some of his favorite authors are Flannery O&#x27;Connor, Philip Roth, and Dennis Lehane (who wrote the intro for the Deluxe Edition of &quot;Hello Starling&quot;). The title of Ritter&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;So Runs the World Away&quot;, comes from a line in the third act of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

Ritter&#x27;s own novel, &quot;Bright&#x27;s Passage&quot;, was published by Dial Press on June 28, 2011. He said of the novel, &quot;Besides my songs, &quot;Bright&#x27;s Passage&quot; is the first [written] work I&#x27;ve wanted anyone to see ... it&#x27;s about a kind of sweet normal guy from West Virginia. He goes to the first World War and he comes back and he has an angel. And it&#x27;s about him and this angel escaping this wildfire for five days. It&#x27;s sort of this short little comedy.&quot; Ritter&#x27;s second novel, &quot;The Great Glorious Goddamn of It All&quot;, was published in the U.S. in September 2021.

== Personal life ==
Ritter married fellow musician Dawn Landes in Branson, Missouri, on May 9, 2009. In a February 2011 interview with the &quot;Boston Herald&quot;, Ritter revealed that they had separated. Ritter and his current partner, author Haley Tanner, own a home together in Woodstock, New York. They had their first child, a daughter named Beatrix Wendylove Ritter, on November 11, 2012.

On November 22, 2009 Ritter played at a benefit concert at Moscow Junior High School, his former junior high school in his hometown of Moscow, Idaho. The concert was for Jim LaFortune, one of Ritter&#x27;s former teachers, who was diagnosed with a brain tumor.

In May 2018 Ritter revealed that he and his wife had adopted a child in January of that year. Their newest daughter Moxie was matched with them through Wide Horizons For Children, an adoption organization Ritter has advocated for. Part of his &quot;Gathering&quot; tour was cancelled to accommodate for this new addition to his family, though Ritter has promised to return to those markets for another show.

==The Royal City Band==
In 2010, Ritter&#x27;s band members – some of whom had been performing with him from the early 2000s – were given the name &quot;The Royal City Band&quot; (a reference to the song &quot;Thin Blue Flame&quot; from &quot;The Animal Years&quot;).

<doc id="903751" wikidata="Q2712856" url="?curid=903751" title="Mega Man Zero 2">
<text>Mega Man Zero 2 is a 2003 action-platform game developed by Inti Creates and published by Capcom for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) handheld game console. It is the second video game in the &quot;Mega Man Zero&quot; subseries of &quot;Mega Man&quot; video games.

The game is set one year following the events of &quot;Mega Man Zero&quot;, and follows the same basic format as its predecessor, being a side-scrolling, platform action game. Once again, players take control of the Reploid known as Zero, and lead him through various levels in the battle against the forces of Neo Arcadia.

The European version also released the same day as the North American &quot;Mega Man X7&quot; was. The European version featured a completely different logo, which was also used on &quot;Mega Man X7&quot;, &quot;Mega Man X8&quot;, &quot;Mega Man X: Command Mission&quot;, &quot;Mega Man Zero 3&quot;, &quot;Mega Man Zero 4&quot;, &quot;Mega Man Network Transmission&quot;, &quot;Mega Man Battle Chip Challenge&quot;, &quot;Mega Man Battle Network 3&quot;, &quot;Mega Man Battle Network 4&quot;, and &quot;Mega Man Battle Network 5&quot;. It was released in Japan on the Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console on January 7, 2015. In February 2020, the game was released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam as part of the &quot;Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection&quot;.

== Plot ==
One year has passed since Zero defeated Copy X. He has since separated from Ciel and the Resistance, now wandering the desert and defeating countless Pantheons. The three surviving members of the Four Guardians have assumed command of Neo Arcadia, with Harpuia as the leader. Copy X&#x27;s death was covered up, as the humans revered him as their savior. The Resistance is now being led by a Reploid named Elpizo, while Ciel continues her work on a new form of energy that will hopefully eliminate the need for war.

Zero wearily makes his way through a sandstorm wrapped in a tattered cloak. As the sands die down he is once more being chased by enemies. Despite being in disrepair, with cracked armor and broken weapons, he charges into the fray. After the battle, Zero collapses from exhaustion and is found by Harpuia. Wishing to see Zero die in battle rather than perish from exhaustion, Harpuia rescues Zero and covertly delivers him to a location near the Resistance base, where he is found and repaired. He learns that Elpizo is planning a frontal assault on Neo Arcadia, as he doesn&#x27;t believe in Ciel&#x27;s plan of creating energy as means to resolve the war. Unable to convince him to call it off, Zero is left to do busy-work in the meantime.

Elpizo&#x27;s assault fails miserably, himself being the only survivor. Driven mad, he declares his desire to harness the power of the legendary Dark Elf to destroy Neo Arcadia (and wipe out the humans), which had brought about the Elf Wars a century ago that left the Earth in a disastrous state. Using the powers granted by partially unsealing the Dark Elf, he invades Neo Arcadia and breaks into the temple where the body of the real X is kept. It is revealed that X ended the Elf Wars by sealing the Dark Elf away with his body, thus leading to his disappearance. Despite the Guardians&#x27; and Zero&#x27;s best efforts, Elpizo destroys X&#x27;s body, which unseals the Dark Elf, and Elpizo absorbs its powers.

After a fierce battle, Zero puts an end to Elpizo&#x27;s plans, who reverts to his normal self and apologizes as he dies. Surprisingly, the Dark Elf turns him into a Cyber-elf, convincing Elpizo that she is not truly evil. As the Dark Elf departs, X appears and tells Zero about the Dark Elf: she was originally known as the Mother Elf and was the savior who ended the Maverick Wars, but was later cursed by a man named Dr. Weil. Zero admits to feeling like he knows her.

In a post credits scene, an unknown man notes the Dark Elf has been released, and tells an entity known as &quot;Omega&quot; that it is time to take action.

== Gameplay ==
The controls are identical to that in the previous game, with players given the option to assign functions to the buttons they are most comfortable using. The weapons are also identical, with the exception of the Triple Rod, which has been replaced by the similar but somewhat more complex Chain Rod.

Cyber Elves are present in the game, and function in the same manner as they did in the previous game. However, unlike the first game, in which four specific Cyber Elves could be transformed into health-storing Sub-Tanks, two of the four Sub-Tanks are now hidden in various stages as collectible items, as they were in the previous series, while the remaining two must be unlocked using Cyber Elves.

While the first game in the series had the player select missions from a list, &quot;Mega Man Zero 2&quot; returns to the traditional Stage Select option found in the &quot;Mega Man&quot; and &quot;Mega Man X&quot; games, although the player can only select from four at a time. In addition, whereas &quot;Mega Man Zero&quot; had a large, interconnected world, none of the stages in this game are linked.

New features added to the game are Forms and EX Skills. Forms are unlocked by completing various tasks during a mission, such as destroying a set number of enemies with the Buster Shot. Forms alter Zero&#x27;s abilities in various ways, such as increasing the power of certain weapons or making him more resilient. However, they also tend to decrease performance in other areas, such as lowering attack power for increased defense or removing special attacks of the Z-Saber to enhance the Buster Shot. EX Skills are unlocked if a player completes a mission with an A or S rank, allowing the player to give Zero&#x27;s weapons the properties of the bosses he&#x27;s defeated.

Players begin the game with the Buster Shot and the Z-Saber. After the introductory mission, Zero is granted the Shield Boomerang and the Chain Rod, which replaces the Triple Rod in the previous game. As with the previous game, the player can unlock new attacks and abilities for the weapons through repeated use. There are fewer upgrades in this game; the Z-Saber has a total of four upgrades, while the rest only have two.

Cyber Elves function in the same manner as the previous game, being single-use aids with either temporary or permanent effects on Zero or the game&#x27;s levels. They are hidden throughout the game as well as dropped by enemies. The use of Cyber Elves penalizes the mission score. There are three types of Cyber Elves, &quot;Nurse&quot;, &quot;Animal&quot;, and &quot;Hacker&quot;. While certain Elves can be used immediately, the larger Elves need to be fed crystals in order to be used. The cost for doing so is significantly less than it was in the previous game.

This game introduces the concept of Forms, which can be earned by meeting certain criteria throughout the game, ranging from killing twenty enemies in a stage with a dashing slash technique to getting twenty-five energy capsules in one stage.

Another new addition to the series is EX Skills, which are similar to Mega Man&#x27;s ability to copy powers from the bosses in previous series. Unlike the previous series, however, Zero has to have an A or S rank going into the stage to unlock the bosses EX Skill. Unlike Mega Man&#x27;s copy ability, which required weapon energy to feed the attacks, EX Skills modify Zero&#x27;s weapons, adding new abilities or replacing their normal abilities with an ability similar to the defeated boss. For example, the Buster Shot can be modified to fire a long-piercing beam instead of its normal charged blast, while the Z-Saber gains additional moves such as a powerful rising slash.

As with the first game, a &quot;New Game Plus&quot; can be played by beating the game and loading the completed save file. In the new game, Zero will start with all activated Cyber Elves used from the previous game still in effect (the penalties, however, will still remain). Zero will also get to keep any EX Skills and alternate forms that he earned in the previous game. Additional modes can also be unlocked under proper conditions.

Hard Mode is unlocked by beating the game once. To play, hold L when selecting to start a New Game. In Hard Mode, Zero starts with the &quot;Proto Form&quot;, which doubles his attack strength but halves his defense and locks his weapons at their basic level. Zero also cannot earn any EX skills or alternate forms. Beating Hard Mode will unlock a special &quot;Image Gallery&quot; option. Hold L and Select when selecting New Game to enter it.

Unlike the other games in the series, there is no Ultimate Mode to be unlocked. However, an &quot;Ultimate Form&quot; can be unlocked by leveling up and using every Cyber Elf in the game. It increases all of Zero&#x27;s stats and also allows him to use full-charge attacks instantly by means of simplistic button combos.

=== Multiplayer ===
If you have two cartridges and a link cable, the players can link two GBAs and take part in a two-player game. There are three modes available to take part in:

* Time Attack - Set a goal somewhere in the stage. After three tries, the player with the shortest time to the goal wins.
* Enemy Battle - Defeat the most enemies from the generator within the time limit.
* Get Item - Collect the most items from the map within the time limit.

==Reception==

&quot;Mega Man Zero 2&quot; was the seventh best-selling video game in Japan during its week of release at 53,839 copies and climbed to the number one spot the following week with an additional 25,283 copies sold. The game appeared on &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine&#x27;s top 30 best-sellers list for the following four weeks. By the end of 2003, &quot;Mega Man Zero 2&quot; had sold 158,479 copies in Japan alone.

A common remark is that the game has not changed much in its formula since its predecessor, though they do acknowledge that improvements have been made to the stage select menus. A general complaint is the difficulty of the game, with one reviewer expressing concern that the difficulty would put some people off the game.

<text>The Polyus spacecraft (, &quot;pole&quot;), also known as Polus, Skif-DM, GRAU index 17F19DM, was a prototype Soviet orbital weapons platform designed to destroy Strategic Defense Initiative satellites with a megawatt carbon-dioxide laser. It had a Functional Cargo Block derived from a TKS spacecraft to control its orbit and it could launch test targets to demonstrate the fire control system.

==History==
The Polyus spacecraft was launched 15 May 1987 from Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 250 as part of the first flight of the Energia system, but failed to reach orbit.

According to Yuri Kornilov, Chief Designer of the Salyut Design Bureau, shortly before Polyus&#x27; launch, Mikhail Gorbachev visited the Baikonur Cosmodrome and expressly forbade the in-orbit testing of its capabilities. Kornilov claims that Gorbachev was worried that it would be possible for Western governments to view this activity as an attempt to create a weapon in space and that such an attempt would contradict the country&#x27;s previous statements on the USSR&#x27;s peaceful intent.

For technical reasons, the payload was launched upside down. It was designed to separate from the Energia, rotate 180 degrees in yaw, then 90 degrees in roll and then fire its engine to complete its boost to orbit. The Energia functioned perfectly, however, after separation from Energia, the Polyus spun a full 360 degrees instead of the planned 180 degrees. When the engine fired, it slowed the vehicle, which burned up over the south Pacific Ocean. This failure was attributed to a faulty inertial guidance system that had not been rigorously tested due to the rushed production schedule.

Parts of the Polyus project&#x27;s hardware were re-used in Kvant-2, Kristall, Spektr and Priroda Mir modules, as well as in the ISS modules Zarya and Nauka.

==Development==
NPO &quot;Energia&quot; received orders from the Soviet government to begin research on space-based strike weapons in the mid-1970s. Even before, the USSR had been developing maneuverable satellites for the purpose of satellite interception. By the beginning of the 1980s, &quot;Energia&quot; had proposed two programs: laser-equipped &quot;Skif&quot; and guided missiles platform &quot;Kaskad&quot; (where &quot;Skif&quot; would cover the low-orbit targets, &quot;Kaskad&quot; engaged targets in high and geosynchronous orbits). Together with NPO &quot;Astrofizika&quot; and KB &quot;Salyut&quot;, they began developing their orbital weapons platform based on the Salyut DOS-17K frame.

Later, when the objective of ICBM interception proved too difficult, the aims of the project were shifted towards anti-satellite weapons. The 1983 announcement by the US of their SDI program prompted further political and financial support for the satellite interceptor program. In the nuclear exchange scenario, the interceptors would destroy the SDI satellites, followed by a so-called &quot;pre-emptive retaliation&quot; large-scale Soviet ICBM launch.

The laser chosen for the &quot;Skif&quot; spacecraft was a 1-megawatt carbon dioxide laser, developed for the Beriev A-60 aircraft (an Il-76 flying laboratory with a combat laser). The introduction of the &quot;Energia&quot;, capable of launching about 95 tonnes into orbit, finally allowed the spacecraft to accommodate the massive laser. The exhaust of the carbon-dioxide laser precipitated the objective of making the laser &quot;recoil-less&quot;. The &quot;zero-torque exhaust system&quot; (SBM) was developed to that end. Its testing in orbit meant the release of a large cloud of carbon dioxide, which would hint at the satellite&#x27;s purpose. Instead, the xenon-krypton mix would be used to simultaneously test the SBM and perform an innocent experiment on Earth&#x27;s ionosphere.

In 1985, the decision was made to test-launch the new &quot;Energia&quot; launch vehicle, which was still in the testbed phase. A 100-ton dummy payload was initially considered for the launch, but in a series of last-minute changes, it was decided that the almost-completed &quot;Skif&quot; spacecraft would be launched instead for a 30-day mission.

The development of the real &quot;Skif&quot; was completed in just one year, from September 1985 to September 1986. Testing and tweaking the &quot;Energia&quot; launch vehicle, the launch pad and the &quot;Skif&quot; itself moved the launch to February, and later to May 1987. According to Boris Gubanov, the head designer of the &quot;Energia&quot; launch vehicle, the work schedule of the preceding years was exhausting, and at the point of Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s visit on 11 May, he asked the Soviet premier to clear the launch now, because &quot;there will be heart attacks&quot;.

The catastrophic malfunction that led to &quot;Skif&quot; entering the atmosphere in the same area as &quot;Energia&#x27;s&quot; second stage was successfully investigated. It was found that 568 seconds after launch, the timing control device gave the logical block a command to discard the side modules&#x27; covers and laser exhaust covers. Unknowingly, the same command was earlier used to open the solar panels and disengage the maneuvering thrusters. This was not discovered because of the logistics of the testing process and overall haste. Main thrusters engaged while the &quot;Skif&quot; kept turning, overshooting the intended 180-degree turn. The spacecraft lost speed and reverted to a ballistic trajectory.

<text>Richard A. Lowry (; born August 22, 1968) is an American writer, and the former editor and now editor-in-chief of &quot;National Review&quot;, an American conservative news and opinion magazine. Lowry became editor of &quot;National Review&quot; in 1997 when selected by its founder, William F. Buckley, Jr., to lead the magazine. Lowry is also a syndicated columnist, author, and political analyst who is a frequent guest on NBC News and &quot;Meet the Press&quot;. He has written four books.

== Early life and education ==
Lowry was born and raised in Arlington, Virginia, the son of a social worker mother and an English professor father. After graduating from Yorktown High School in Arlington, Lowry attended the University of Virginia, where he studied English and history. He was editor of the &quot;Virginia Advocate&quot;, the school&#x27;s conservative monthly magazine.

== Career ==
After graduating, Lowry worked for Charles Krauthammer as a research assistant, and, later, as a reporter for a local newspaper in northern Virginia.

In 1992, Lowry joined &quot;National Review&quot;, after finishing second in the magazine&#x27;s young writers&#x27; contest. In the summer of 1994, he became the articles editor for &quot;National Review&quot; and moved to Washington, D.C. to cover Congress. In November 1997, Lowry became editor of &quot;National Review&quot; at the age of 29, taking over from John O&#x27;Sullivan, who had succeeded Buckley in that position ten years earlier. At the time, Buckley said of Lowry, &quot;I am very confident that I&#x27;ve got a very good person.&quot;

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Lowry praised Florida governor Ron DeSantis for his hands-off approach to COVID-19 in a May 2020 column titled &quot;Where does Ron DeSantis go to get his apology?&quot;.

Lowry writes a syndicated column for King Features and an opinion column for &quot;Politico&quot;.

As a political commentator, he regularly appears on various cable shows and network Sunday shows, including NBC&#x27;s &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, ABC&#x27;s &quot;This Week&quot;, and &quot;FOX News Sunday&quot;.

In a September 2024 interview with Megyn Kelly, while discussing the Springfield, Ohio, cat-eating hoax, social media users accused Lowry of calling Haitian immigrants in Springfield &quot;niggers&quot;. Lowry denied that he used the slur, saying he instead mistakenly combined the words &quot;migrants&quot; and &quot;immigrants&quot;.
=== Books ===
Lowry has written three non-fiction books. His &quot;New York Times&quot; best-selling book, &quot;Legacy: Paying the Price for the Clinton Years&quot; is a polemic against former President Bill Clinton, whom he characterizes as &quot;Navel-Gazer-in-Chief&quot;. In June 2013, he published the Abraham Lincoln political biography &quot;Lincoln Unbound&quot;.
In November 2019, he published &quot;The Case for Nationalism: How It Made Us Powerful, United, and Free&quot;. In a review in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, Georgetown University Professor of Government, Charles King, criticized the book, arguing that Lowry&#x27;s definition of a nation is vague, ahistorical and contradictory: &quot;few of Lowry&#x27;s statements would pass muster with historians&quot;, and that Lowry&#x27;s assertions about the unity, homogeneity and fixity of units such as Ancient Egypt, Korea, Japan and China &quot;should be an embarrassment&quot; to &quot;any serious thinker.&quot; Pulitzer Prize winner Carlos Lozada was harshly critical of the book in a review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, describing it as an attempt to sanitize President Donald Trump&#x27;s variant of nationalism and &quot;part of a larger effort on the right to create an after-the-fact framework for Trumpism, to contort the president&#x27;s utterances and impulses into a coherent worldview that can outlast him — a sort of rescue mission for the conservative movement.&quot;

Lowry&#x27;s first novel, the political thriller &quot;Banquo&#x27;s Ghosts&quot;, was co-written with Keith Korman and published in 2009.

==Personal life==
In June 2011, Lowry married Vanessa Palo at the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer in Manhattan. The couple have one daughter.

<doc id="903768" wikidata="Q2200734" url="?curid=903768" title="Parliament of the German-speaking Community">
<text>The Parliament of the German-speaking Community ( or PDG) is the legislative assembly of the German-speaking Community of Belgium located in Eupen.

The most important tasks of the Parliament of the German-speaking Community include the election and the supervision of the Government of the German-speaking Community, the adoption of decrees for the German-speaking Community and the preparation and adoption of the annual budget.

==Members and elections==

The Parliament of the German-speaking Community has 25 members who are directly elected every 5 years, to run in tandem with the European Parliament elections. These are the only members who have the right to speak and to vote. In addition, there are also some members with a consultative vote who are not actually members of the Parliament, but who do have the right to attend and participate in meetings.

The advisory members are the Provincial Councillors of Liège Province, the members of the Walloon Parliament, the members of the Chamber of Representatives and the members of the Senate who reside in the German-speaking area of Belgium and who have taken the oath of office in German, as well as the MEP elected by the German-speaking electoral college.

==History==

Since October 1973 the German-speaking Community has had its own parliament, which was initially known as the Council of the German Cultural Community (). In 1973, the members were not directly elected, but the distribution of seats was determined by the election results for the national Parliament. However, in March 1974, the first direct elections for the Council of the German Cultural Community took place. The name of the parliament was changed to Council of the German-speaking Community () in 1984, and to Parliament of the German-speaking Community in 2004.

At the end of 2013, the Parliament moved from its old location in Kaperberg to a renovated building in Kehrweg that once served as a Sanitorium.

==Powers==
The German-speaking Community has powers over cultural, linguistic and &quot;personal&quot; matters (e.g. education, health care) like the Dutch- and French-speaking communities of Belgium.

The Government of the Walloon Region exercises regional matters over the territory in Parliament through a representative from the German-speaking Community. However, there has been some debate as to whether or not German-speakers should have their own region. As article 139 of the Belgian Constitution specifies, the Walloon Region may transfer some regional powers to the German-speaking Community, which it has done in the following policy areas:
* In 1995: Monuments and Heritage
* In 2000: Archaeological Matters and Employment Policy
* In 2005: Supervision of the Church Council; Supervision of Municipalities and Policing Districts; the Financing of Municipalities; Funerals and Gravestones

However, by contrast with the country&#x27;s other two linguistic communities, it has no control over the language used in administration, because all municipalities are municipalities with language facilities in French.

==Current composition==
Following the 2024 regional election, the make-up of the Parliament of the German-speaking Community is as follows:
The Socialist Party, the liberal Party for Freedom and Progress and the regionalist ProDG signed an agreement on 10 June 2009 to form the a coalition government. It is the first time in the history of the German-speaking Community that an outgoing government coalition succeeded itself. Under the terms of the agreement, Karl-Heinz Lambertz (SP) remained Minister-President and Louis Siquet (SP) stayed on as Community Senator until January 2010, at which point he was replaced by a socialist.

In May 2014, a few days after the elections, the three incumbent government parties agreed to continue their government coalition. However, since ProDG became bigger than the Socialist Party in the elections, the new Minister-President was Oliver Paasch (ProDG). Five years later, the same parties again quickly agreed to continue their coalition, still led by Paasch.

==Committees==

The Parliament of the German-speaking Community currently has 5 committees:
* Committee I on General Policy, Local Government, Petitions, Finances and Cooperation
* Committee II on Culture
* Committee III on Education and Training
* Committee IV on Health, Employment and Social Affairs
* Oversight Committee on Electoral Expenditure and Communications of the Public Authorities of the German-speaking Community

<doc id="903775" wikidata="Q7729464" url="?curid=903775" title="The Death of a President">
<text>The Death of a President: November 20–November 25, 1963 is historian William Manchester&#x27;s 1967 account of the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy. The book gained public attention before it was published when Kennedy&#x27;s widow Jacqueline, who had initially asked Manchester to write the book, demanded that the author make changes in the manuscript.

==Description==
The book is dedicated: &quot;For all in whose hearts he still lives—a watchman of honor who never sleeps&quot;.

The book chronicles several days in late November 1963, from a small reception the Kennedys hosted in the White House on Wednesday, November 20, the evening before the visit to Dallas, Texas, through the flight to Texas, the motorcade, the assassination, the hospital, the airplane journey back to Washington, D.C., and the funeral on Monday, November 25. The tension between the Kennedy and Johnson factions, the worldwide reaction, and Lee Harvey Oswald&#x27;s televised murder by Jack Ruby are discussed in painstaking detail.

==Background==

===Genesis===
During early 1964, Jacqueline Kennedy commissioned Manchester to produce an account of the assassination. She and the Kennedy family wanted a definitive telling of the events to preempt other books, including Jim Bishop&#x27;s forthcoming &quot;The Day Kennedy Was Shot&quot;. Kennedy was familiar with Manchester&#x27;s work through &quot;Portrait of a President: John F. Kennedy in Profile&quot;, his account of the president&#x27;s first year and a half as president. Manchester had met and grown to admire John Kennedy when both were recovering from war wounds in Boston.

The agreement stipulated that Jacqueline Kennedy and the president&#x27;s brother Robert F. Kennedy, then Attorney General, would approve the manuscript. As part of the agreement, Manchester was to receive an advance of $36,000 but only against the income from the first printing. All other earnings would go to the John F. Kennedy Library.

Kennedy promised Manchester exclusive interviews with members of the family, and sat for 10 hours of interviews with him. Manchester interviewed 1,000 people for the book, including Robert F. Kennedy; only Marina Oswald refused. Working 100 hours a week for two years to meet an accelerated 1967 publishing deadline, the stress of producing the book sent Manchester to a hospital due to nervous exhaustion for more than two months, where he completed a manuscript of 1,201 pages and 380,000 words.

Manchester gave the manuscript to his editor at Harper &amp; Row, Evan Thomas, and to the Kennedy family for review during March 1966. He received an offer of $665,000 from &quot;Look&quot; magazine for serial rights; his agent had obtained an agreement that payments for a serial would go to the author.

===Controversy===
Both Jacqueline and Robert F. Kennedy had refused to read the manuscript, delegating the review to former Kennedy administration members John Seigenthaler, Ed Guthman, and Richard N. Goodwin. They believed that passages in the book &quot;unflattering&quot; to Johnson might damage Robert Kennedy&#x27;s political plans for 1968, and requested changes. Pam Turnure, Jacqueline Kennedy&#x27;s secretary, also read the manuscript; alarmed by many &quot;personal revelations&quot; from Jacqueline&#x27;s interviews with Manchester, such as the fact that she smoked cigarettes (something Jacqueline Kennedy had hidden in the White House), she also provided lists of changes. Additionally, Jacqueline Kennedy believed that the proceeds from the &quot;Look&quot; offer should go to the Kennedy Library. She claimed that her interviews with Manchester had been intended for the library, threatened to block publication of the book unless the changes were made, unsuccessfully offered &quot;Look&quot; $1 million to cancel the serialization, and during late 1966, filed a lawsuit asking the court to issue an injunction to stop the book&#x27;s publication.

Newspaper articles about her decision speculated on the contents of the book. Through an out-of-court settlement during January 1967, Manchester agreed to delete 1,600 words from the serialization and seven out of 654 pages from the published book. Although headlines noted Jacqueline Kennedy as the victor, Manchester claimed that the deletions were &quot;harmless&quot;, and retained the serialization fee.

===Aftermath===
Harper &amp; Row published &quot;The Death of a President&quot; during the spring of 1967 to good reviews. It sold more than 1 million copies by summer and later was given the Dag Hammarskjold International Literary Prize. By 1970 the book had earned $1 million in royalties for the Kennedy Library.

During 1988, the book was reprinted and Manchester wrote a new foreword. People had wondered whether he would update and modify his original work. Manchester wrote that, in his opinion, there were not any new developments.

The Kennedy family retains control of materials related to &quot;Death&quot;. Jacqueline Kennedy&#x27;s interview tapes with the author are sealed at the Kennedy Library until 2067. Manchester&#x27;s original manuscript is held at Wesleyan University with &quot;extremely restricted use&quot; and, according to his son John Manchester, the Kennedy family allowed the book to go out of print.

==Reprints==
The book was reprinted during 1988, and reissued by Back Bay Books, an imprint of Little, Brown, and Company, during October 2013.

<text>Death of a President is a 2006 British mockumentary political thriller film about the fictional assassination of George W. Bush, the 43rd and at the time, incumbent U.S. President, on 19 October 2007 in Chicago, Illinois. The film is presented as a future history docudrama and uses actors, archival video footage as well as computer-generated special effects to present the hypothetical aftermath the event had on civil liberties, racial profiling, journalistic sensationalism and foreign policy.

==Plot==
Broadcast in the year 2008, the film is presented in a TV documentary style format, combining talking head interviews, news coverage clips and video surveillance footage surrounding the assassination of U.S. President George W. Bush in Chicago around a year earlier on 19 October 2007. The president is fatally shot by a sniper after he addresses an economic forum at the Chicago Sheraton Hotel, before which an anti-war rally had taken place. News outlets immediately begin reporting on the incident along with its political ramifications. After authorities earlier arrest and interrogate war-protesting detainees, Jamal Abu Zikri (Malik Bader), an IT professional of Syrian origin, becomes the prime suspect.

Vice President Dick Cheney, now president, uses the possible al-Qaeda relationship in connection with the suspected assassin, Zikri, to push his own domestic political security agenda. He calls for the legislation of PATRIOT Act III, trying to increase the investigative powers of the FBI, the police, and other government agencies over American citizens and foreign residents as he contemplates attacking Syria.

As his wife Zahra (Hend Ayoub) listens to the verdict with family attorney Dawn Norton (Patricia Buckley) in a packed courtroom, Zikri is convicted of killing the U.S. President and sentenced to death based upon dubious forensic evidence. Meanwhile, a new report which surfaces, substantiated by interviews with Marianne Claybon (Chavez Ravine), indicates that the perpetrator is most likely her husband Al Claybon (Tony Dale), a veteran of the 1991 Persian Gulf War, who lived in Rock Island, Illinois, and who also was the father of David Claybon, a U.S. soldier recently killed in the Iraq War. The assassin, who blames President Bush for the death of his son, killed himself after Bush&#x27;s assassination. Claybon&#x27;s suicide note, addressed to a second son, Casey Claybon (Neko Parham), an Iraq War veteran living in Chicago who was previously considered as a suspect, reads:

Ten months after President Bush&#x27;s assassination, Zikri remains on death row at the Stateville Correctional Center, because government officials are deliberately delaying his legal appeal. Moreover, in his dead father&#x27;s Rock Island house, Casey Claybon finds evidence of his father&#x27;s planning of the shooting. The most incriminating piece of evidence is a copy of a top secret presidential itinerary outlining, to the minute, President Bush&#x27;s Chicago whereabouts on 19 October 2007. The news report ends while the U.S. Government continues investigating how presidential assassin Al Claybon obtained that top secret document.

The final closing titles of the film inform the viewer that President Cheney&#x27;s USA PATRIOT Act III was signed into permanent law in the U.S., stating the following: &quot;It has granted investigators unprecedented powers of detention and surveillance, and further expanded the powers of the executive branch&quot;.

==Cast==
*Hend Ayoub as Zahra Abu Zikri, the wife of convicted assassin Jamal Abu Zikri. She comes to believe her family has been targeted by authorities due to their Middle-Eastern heritage.
*Brian Boland as Larry Stafford, lead Secret Service agent assigned to the president. He ultimately failed in preventing the president from being assassinated, as he discusses the day&#x27;s events and security precautions leading up to the tragedy.
*Becky Ann Baker as Eleanor Drake, personal advisor to the president. She dutifully assisted in preparing his speeches and was one of the first few people to learn of his death at the hospital.
*Robert Mangiardi as Greg Turner, First Deputy of the Chicago police department, in charge of coordinating security arrangements for the war protest as well as handling the blocking off of city streets for the presidential motorcade. He expresses his displeasure with the violent tone of the protesting public.
*Jay Patterson as Sam McCarthy, White House correspondent for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. From time to time, he expresses his disapproval with the government&#x27;s basis for holding Zikri. He believes they have no definitive evidence linking him to the assassination other than the fact that he might have flirted with the thought of terrorism by visiting an enemy country.
*Jay Whittaker as Frank Molini, a war protester caught and arrested by police in the ensuing chaos after the initial shots were fired at the president. In his possession was a banner depicting a gun being fired at Bush. However, he was later found not to be the assassin.
*Michael Reilly Burke as Robert H. Maguire, special agent in charge at the FBI, involved with reporting directly to new president Dick Cheney on his investigation surrounding evidence related to the assassination.
*James Urbaniak as Dr. James Pearn, an FBI forensic examiner assigned to the case to collect and catalogue evidence against any possible suspects. He obtains a partial fingerprint of Jamal Abu Zikri from traces of gunshot residue at the crime scene, but notes that it is only associative evidence and not necessarily enough evidence for a conviction in a court of law.
*Neko Parham as Casey Claybon, son of possible suspected assassin Al Claybon. A war veteran who did not particularly support Bush, but who also claimed to have no knowledge of the assassination. He was initially arrested in the melee following the killing, as he walked through the streets of downtown Chicago looking for employment.
*Seena Jon as Samir Masri, a Yemeni American protesting at the war rally outside where the President was speaking. Members of his family were deported back to Yemen after overstaying their travel visas following the 9/11 attacks. Masri was at the rally to protest Bush&#x27;s policies and was arrested as a suspect.
*Christian Stolte as John Rucinski, FBI investigator with the joint terrorism task force, assigned with interviewing detainees including Jamal Abu Zikri. Skeptical, he stresses his suspicions about Zikri&#x27;s whereabouts on the day of the assassination as well as his military history after analysing his statements.
*Chavez Ravine as Marianne Claybon, wife of suspected possible assassin Al Claybon. She finds it hard to comprehend her patriotic husband could have had any connection with the killing.
*Patricia Buckley as Dawn Norton, Jamal Abu Zikry&#x27;s defence attorney. She immediately expresses her challenging task of defending her client who the FBI believes has connections with terrorist organisations. She relates her difficulty by conveying that any person &quot;suspected&quot; of involvement with Al-Qaeda unfortunately equates to a guilty verdict in American society.
*Malik Bader as Jamal Abu Zikri, the suspected assassin, a Syrian national working at an IT firm in a building neighbouring the Chicago Sheraton. He was convicted of the crime, but appealed the verdict while being held on death row due to minor forensic evidence implicating him in the assassination.
*Tony Dale as Al Claybon, the figure cited as a strong likely suspect of the assassination who ended up committing suicide after he supposedly killed the president. He was a Gulf War veteran distraught over a second son&#x27;s death from the Iraq War, blaming Bush for his misery.

==Production==

===Filming===
The funeral scenes in the film include footage taken from archival coverage of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s funeral, and President Cheney&#x27;s eulogy for President Bush is a news clip of Cheney&#x27;s eulogy for Reagan. CGI special effects and existing footage of President Bush helped to re-create the filming of his assassination. The rifle used by the perpetrator in the film was actually an airsoft replica of an AR-15. Image editing software was used to add the actors&#x27; images to photographs with President Bush.

Although all imagery related to Bush&#x27;s assassination was created using digital special effects, an apparent actual death, captured on tape, is included in the film during a piece of war footage in which an Iraqi insurgent prepares to launch a rocket, but is shot in the head first. Except for specific scenes, most of the actors portrayed in the film were not told of the premise surrounding the story.

During a post emergency surgery news conference, the chief physician&#x27;s comment that he had &quot;never seen such a strong heart in a man of the president&#x27;s age&quot;, is a reference to President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s own attempted assassination. In addition, the interview of a middle-aged African American outside the hospital recalls an interview of a witness on the streets of Washington, D.C. in 1981 following that assassination attempt. Filming was done entirely on location in Chicago, Illinois.

===Music===
The film score was composed and conducted by Richard Harvey. Sound effects and music elements were mixed by Alex Riordan.

===Director&#x27;s notes===
The film&#x27;s director, Gabriel Range, noted that the film is not &quot;a leftist jeremiad&quot; and further said:

The purpose of the film was not to imagine how the world stage would reset with the assassination of George Bush. The intent of the film is really to use the assassination of President Bush as a dramatic device—using the future as an allegory to comment on the past. [...] If people go to the cinema expecting to have some great moment of catharsis watching the president being shot, I suspect they&#x27;re in for a pretty big surprise. I think that anyone who&#x27;s expecting this to be a liberal wet dream is in for quite a shock ... It was very important that the film was not a political rant. It was not just a condemnation or polemic because I think that polemics are easy to dismiss.

==Release==
The official premiere was at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival on 10 September 2006.

===Television===
In Europe, it was broadcast in the UK on 9 October (More4), 19 October 2006 (Channel 4), in Finland on 18 October 2007, in Switzerland on 21 August 2011 (SF 1) and in France on 28 January 2014 (Polar)

===Box office===
Newmarket paid one million dollars for the U.S. distribution rights. The total production budget for the film is estimated to have been two million dollars. Two of the largest U.S. cinema chains, Regal Entertainment Group and Cinemark, refused to screen the film; a Cinemark spokesman told UK newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;The assassination of a sitting president is problematic subject matter&quot;. In addition, major U.S. broadcasters CNN and National Public Radio refused to broadcast advertisements for the film. The film was screened in the U.S. for 14 days, showing at 143 theatres at its widest release. Worldwide, it grossed $869,352. The Japanese motion picture ethics committee, the Eirin, prevented &quot;Death of a President&quot; from being shown in most cinemas in 2007, saying that the film&#x27;s Japanese title (&quot;Bush Ansatsu&quot;, translated as &quot;Bush Assassinated&quot;) is inappropriate.
The film was scheduled to begin showing in Japanese cinemas on 6 October 2007.

===Home media===
The Region 2 Code widescreen edition of the film was released on DVD in the United Kingdom on 30 October 2006, followed by the Region 1 Code version in the United States on 3 April 2007. Special features include interviews and commentary with screenwriter Simon Finch, editor Brand Thumim, line producer Donall McCusker and director Gabriel Range. A theatrical trailer is also included with the extras.

==Reception==

===Politicians===
The central conceit of &quot;Death of a President&quot; was much criticised by those who believed it exploited the subject of presidential assassination, and that by doing so, was in bad taste. Gretchen Esell of the Texas Republican Party described the subject matter saying, &quot;I find this shocking, I find it disturbing. I don&#x27;t know if there are many people in America who would want to watch something like that.&quot; Hillary Clinton, then junior United States senator from New York, told &quot;The Journal News&quot; of Rockland, Westchester, and Putnam counties at the annual New Castle Community Day in Chappaqua that, &quot;I think it&#x27;s despicable. I think it&#x27;s absolutely outrageous. That anyone would even attempt to profit on such a horrible scenario makes me sick.&quot;

Simon Finch, the co-screenwriter, replied saying that Clinton had not seen the film when she commented. The Bush administration did not comment about the film; as White House spokesperson Emily Lawrimore remarked, &quot;We are not commenting because it doesn&#x27;t dignify a response.&quot;

===Media and theater reaction===
Following its release in Canada and the United Kingdom, many American movie theater chains including AMC, Regal, and Cinemark refused to run the controversial feature due to its depiction of Bush&#x27;s potential assassination. Dick Westerling, who ran the Regal chain, remarked that &quot;we do not feel it is appropriate to portray the future assassination of a president&quot;. At the same time, CNN and the National Public Radio announced that neither network would accept commercials for the film due to its extreme nature.

===Critical review===
Critics had varied opinions about &quot;Death of a President&quot;. The Metacritic aggregate website rated it at 49, &quot;Mixed or Average&quot;, based upon 30 reviews. Rotten Tomatoes rated it at 39%, &quot;Rotten&quot;, based upon 101 reviews. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;In this unconvincing fictional documentary, the tense 30 minutes that lead into the title event is outweighed by the boring, melodramatic hour preceding it.&quot; In &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Richard Corliss placed it in the context of other fictional assassinations, such as &quot;The Assassination of the Duke of Guise&quot; (1908), &quot;Suddenly&quot; (1954) and television programmes like &quot;24&quot; (2001–2014); concluding that it was &quot;not an incendiary documentary, but a well-made political thriller.&quot; In the &quot;Village Voice&quot;, J. Hoberman said it was &quot;dramatically inert, but a minor techno-miracle&quot; and that it &quot;skews more theoretical than sensationalist ... Bush is presented as a martyr.&quot; James Berardinelli commented that &quot;If this was a serious examination of the possible long-term ramifications of George Bush&#x27;s current foreign policy, or if it had anything interesting to say about Bush&#x27;s legacy, it might be justifiable. But that&#x27;s not the case. The decision to use Bush rather than a fictional representation of him is for no reason other than self-promotion.&quot;

Of the critics who liked &quot;Death of a President&quot;, Rex Reed of &quot;The New York Observer&quot; identified the film as &quot;Clever, thoughtful, and totally believable. This is a film without a political agenda that everyone should see.&quot; In the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, Peter Howell said, &quot;The film&#x27;s deeper intentions ... elevate it into the company of such landmark works of historical argument as Peter Watkins&#x27;s &quot;The War Game&quot;, Costa-Gavras&#x27;s &quot;Z&quot; and, closer to home, Michel Brault&#x27;s &quot;Les Ordres&quot;. Every thinking person should see &quot;Death of a President&quot;.&quot; In &quot;Film Journal International&quot;, Frank Lovece mused that the film&#x27;s condemnation &quot;by politicians and pundits from James Pinkerton to Hillary Clinton is understandable and completely predictable: They can&#x27;t &quot;not&quot; comment, so when they do, they have to play to their audiences. None of them seriously believes that this work of fiction will really make someone take a potshot at the president, and anyway, the attempt on President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s life came out of a crazy guy&#x27;s fascination with Jodie Foster, so you may as well decry movies starring blonde former child actresses.&quot; Jim Emerson, editor of RogerEbert.com exclaimed, &quot;&quot;Death of a President&quot; is electrifying drama, and compellingly realistic. The actors chosen for interview segments (including the mom from &quot;Freaks &amp; Geeks&quot; as a presidential speechwriter) are unerringly authentic as real people, speaking spontaneously before a documentary lens -- even when it&#x27;s clear they&#x27;ve rehearsed in their heads what they&#x27;re going to say, and may even have told these same stories any number of times before.&quot;

The film has been reviewed in 2014. &quot;The Prince George Citizen&quot; columnist Neil Godbout called it &quot;a powerful statement about racial prejudice, [politicians&#x27; exploitation on] events for their own purposes, and [reporters&#x27; willingness] to tell stories [told] by government sources without question to get the scoop and break the story first.&quot; &quot;Indiewire&quot; critic Andre Seewood wrote that the film does not &quot;suggest that [George W. Bush] actually be assassinated by British agents.&quot; Seewood further wrote that it is &quot;not a direct insult to an enemy but hypothetical criticism of [UK&#x27;s] ally cleverly disguised as a television news journal in countries where freedom of speech is mutually respected.&quot;

===Awards===
The film won a total of 6 awards including; the &quot;International Critics Prize (FIPRESCI)&quot; from the 2006 Toronto Film Festival, the &quot;International Emmy Award&quot; for the TV Movie/Mini-Series category in the (UK), the &quot;RTS Television Award&quot; in the Digital Channel Programme category from the Royal Television Society, the &quot;RTBF TV Prize for Best Picture&quot; Award from the Brussels European Film Festival for director Gabriel Range, the &quot;Banff Rockie Award&quot; from the Banff Television Festival for the film, and one for director Gabriel Range. The film also received a nomination for &quot;Best Visual Effects&quot; from the British Academy TV Awards in 2007.

<doc id="903785" wikidata="Q2722486" url="?curid=903785" title="Amarsinh Chaudhary">
<text>Amarsinh Bhilabhai Chaudhary (31 July 1941 – 15 August 2004) was an Indian politician. He became the first &quot;adivasi&quot; to serve as the Chief Minister of Gujarat when he took office in 1985.

==Career ==
Chaudhary was a civil engineer and served as government employee for short time. He became a Member of Legislative Assembly from Radhanpur Constituency in 1970. He became a junior minister under Ghanshyam Oza in 1972 and later served as minister in subsequent cabinets. He was elected to Gujarat Vidhan Sabha from Vyara in 1985, and was the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 1985 to 1989. In 1990 Vidhan Sabha elections, he lost to his namesake Amarsinh (Zinabhai) Chaudhary, an independent candidate, from Vyara (Vidhan Sabha constituency). Amarsinh Zinabhai Chaudhary had been elected to Lok Sabha in 1971 from Mandvi on Congress ticket. Amarsinh (Bhilabhai) Chaudhary later served as President of the Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee between June 2001 and July 2002. In 2002, he was elected to Gujarat Vidhan Sabha from Khedbrahma constituency, and was elected leader of the Congress Legislature Party and leader of opposition in Gujarat Legislative Assembly. He died in the middle of this term.

==Personal life==
Amarsinh Chaudhary was married to Gajraben and the couple had 3 children. In 1991, he married his companion Nisha Gameti without divorcing his first wife, and this caused a controversy with his first wife calling Nisha &#x27;a venomous lady&#x27;. Nisha, on her part, had divorced her husband, with whom she had two children, in 1990.

His second wife Nisha Chaudhary was elected to Lok Sabha from Sabarkantha thrice in 1990s. She died in 2001. After her death, he refused to contest Lok Sabha election in 2004, saying that he wanted to stay in Gujarat politics. He died a few weeks after the Lok Sabha election.

Politician Tushar Amarsinh Chaudhary is his son.

==Death==
Chaudhary was admitted to a hospital in Ahmedabad on 24 July 2004 for severe liver and kidney complications. He died of cardiac arrest on 15 August 2004 after a prolonged illness.

<doc id="903786" wikidata="Q7170232" url="?curid=903786" title="Persian column">
<text>Persian columns or Persepolitan columns are the distinctive form of column developed in the Achaemenid architecture of ancient Persia, probably beginning shortly before 500 BCE. They are mainly known from Persepolis, where the massive main columns have a base, fluted shaft, and a double-animal capital, most with bulls. Achaemenid palaces had enormous hypostyle halls called apadana, which were supported inside by several rows of columns. The Throne Hall or &quot;Hall of a Hundred Columns&quot; at Persepolis, measuring 70 × 70 metres was built by the Achaemenid king Artaxerxes I. The apadana hall is even larger. These often included a throne for the king and were used for grand ceremonial assemblies; the largest at Persepolis and Susa could fit ten thousand people at a time.

The Achaemenids had little experience of stone architecture, but were able to import artists and craftsmen from around their empire to develop a hybrid imperial style drawing on influences from Mesopotamia, Egypt and Lydia in Anatolia, as well as Elam in Persia itself. The style was probably developed in the Palace of Darius in Susa, but the most numerous and complete survivals are at Persepolis, where several columns remain standing. Imperial building in the style stopped abruptly with the invasion by Alexander the Great in 330 BCE, when Persepolis was burned down.

==Description==

The forms of the columns and capitals vary somewhat between different buildings. Generally the capitals are carved with two heavily decorated back-to-back animals projecting out from the column. These function as brackets to support the architrave or roof timbers, while the flat backs of the animals support timbers running at right angles (see the reconstruction in the Louvre below). As they project the animals may be called protomes. The bull is the most common animal, but there are also lions, bulls with the head of a man in the style of the Assyrian lamassu, and griffins with the heads of eagles and the bodies of lions.

The bulls and lions may reflect the symbolism around Nowruz, the Persian New Year at the spring equinox, of an eternally fighting bull personifying the moon, and a lion personifying the Sun. This was the day when tributary nations presented their annual tribute to the king, as depicted in the stairway reliefs at Persepolis, and it has been suggested that Persepolis was specifically built for Nowruz celebrations.

The capital is much longer than in most other styles of columns. While some smaller columns move quickly from the animals to the plain shaft below, the largest and grandest examples have a long intervening section with double volutes at the top and, inverted, at the bottom of a long fluted square zone, although the shaft of the column is round. At the top of the round fluted shaft are two sections with a loosely plant-based design, the upper a form of &quot;palm capital&quot;, spreading as it rises, and the lower suggesting leaves drooping downwards. Other capitals have the animals and the two lower plant-based elements, but not the section in between with the volutes; the example in Chicago is of this type. There are various small mouldings between the various elements, reflecting a Greek style. The horns and ears of the animals are often separate pieces, fitting into the head by square plugs. The columns were polished and at least the capitals were painted, in the case of wooden ones on a plaster coating. The style reflects influences from the many cultures that the Persian Empire conquered including Egypt, Babylon, and Lydia, as well as Greece, where the Persians had only temporary success; the final result is distinctively Persian.
===Shaft and base===
It is thought the stone columns that survive were preceded by wooden versions, and these continued to be used. The move to stone may have come when sufficiently large trees for the biggest buildings became difficult or impossible to source. The column shafts can be as tall as 20 metres. The base is in stone even for wooden columns, and sometimes carries an inscription saying which king erected the building. Most are round, but an early square type has two steps.

In grand settings the columns are usually fluted. The flutes are shallow, with arrises, like the Greek Doric order, but they are more numerous, and therefore narrower. The large columns at Persepolis have as many as 40 or 48 flutes, with smaller columns elsewhere 32; the width of a flute is kept fairly constant, so the number of flutes increases with the girth of the column, in contrast to the Greek practice of keeping the number of flutes on a column constant and varying the width of the flute. The early Doric temples seem to have had a similar principle, before 20 flutes became the convention.

Fluting is also found in other parts of the classical Persian column. The bases are often fluted, and the &quot;bell&quot; part of the capital has stylized plant ornament that comes close to fluting. Above this there is usually a tall section with four flat fluted volutes.

==Use and influence==

The full form of Persian column seems only to have been used at a few sites outside Persia around the empire in the Achaemenid period, in Armenia and even Levantine colonies in Iberia. The columns influenced the Pillars of Ashoka erected in India some 80 years after Alexander the Great destroyed the Persian Empire, and other imperial buildings in the architecture of the Maurya Empire. 

The much smaller Mathura lion capital of the 1st century CE shows clear influence. They can be seen in relief decoration around Buddhist stupas in Gandhara in the 2nd or 3rd century CE, and Persian columns decorate the Karla Caves and Nasik Caves. The style did not develop in Persia itself, but elements continued to appear under later dynasties before the arrival of Islam.

==Modern revival==

From the 19th-century the full Persepolitan form of the column was revived, initially by Parsees in India and eclectic architects in Europe, and only later used in public buildings in Iran under the Pahlavi dynasty (from 1925), though the former royal palace in the Afif-Abad Garden, of 1863, tentatively uses some elements of the capitals.

Reza Shah, the first Pahlavi Shah of Iran, promoted interest in the Achaemenids in various ways to foster Iranian nationalism and support the legitimacy of his regime. Significant buildings in Tehran were supervised as to the authenticity of their style by European archaeologists, especially André Godard, Maxime Siroux (both also architects), and Ernst Herzfeld, who had been brought to Iran to dig, curate, and train students. These include the police headquarters and the Bank Melli Iran headquarters.

Though the Islamic Republic of Iran prefers buildings that refer to Islamic architecture, miniature Persian columns support the Scholars Pavilion donated to the United Nations Office at Vienna in 2009.

<text>A Persian drill is a drill which is turned by pushing a nut back and forth along a spirally grooved drill holder. It was formerly used for delicate operations such as jewellery making and dentistry. A ratcheting screwdriver with a &quot;spiral ratchet&quot; mechanism may be used as a Persian drill.

<text>Pieris, the whites or garden whites, is a widespread, now almost cosmopolitan, genus of butterflies of the family Pieridae. The highest species diversity is in the Palearctic, with a higher diversity in Europe and eastern North America than the similar and closely related &quot;Pontia&quot;. The females of many &quot;Pieris&quot; butterflies are UV reflecting, while the male wings are strongly UV absorbing due to pigments in the scales.

==Ecology==
Many species of this genus have caterpillars which feed on cabbage and other members of the Brassicaceae. The chemical basis of this association with a certain plant group has been studied for over 100 years, and is now known to occur via a number of biochemical adaptations to chemicals called glucosinolates in these plants. In contrast to most other insects, &quot;Pieris&quot; caterpillars are able to detoxify these chemicals, and have become so specialised that they will not eat any food without glucosinolates. The &quot;Pieris&quot; females, in turn, check for the presence of glucosinolates before laying eggs on a plant. The crop-damaging species have spread from Eurasia to most of the rest of the world (most recently to South America and Africa) and are considered pest insects almost everywhere. There are species of &quot;Pieris&quot; that are not pests, such as the North American species &quot;Pieris oleracea&quot; (mustard white) and &quot;Pieris virginiensis&quot; (Virginia white). These butterflies feed successfully only on specific native vegetation.

Some members of &quot;Pieris&quot; are threatened by the rapid spread of some plants in the Brassicaceae, such as the way the highly invasive garlic mustard (&quot;Alliaria petiolata&quot;) kills the larvae of &quot;Pieris oleracea&quot; and &quot;Pieris virginiensis&quot; in North America. Given the large differences between the chemicals that garlic mustard creates versus those of mustards native to North America, it is likely that it is also lethal to other members of &quot;Pieris&quot; that are native to North America. It is listed as a suitable food plant for the Eurasian Veined white (&quot;Pieris napi&quot;). Having not evolved with garlic mustard, the aforementioned American butterflies lay eggs on it, confusing it with their host plants due to a similar odor. Just because butterflies are members of &quot;Pieris&quot; does not mean they are all capable of feeding on the same members of Brassicaceae that other members of &quot;Pieris&quot; can feed on.

<doc id="903795" wikidata="Q1065126" url="?curid=903795" title="Hungarian Dances (Brahms)">
<text>The Hungarian Dances () by Johannes Brahms (WoO 1), are a set of 21 lively dance tunes based mostly on Hungarian themes, completed in 1879. They vary from about a minute to five minutes in length. They are among Brahms&#x27;s most popular works and were the most profitable for him. Each dance has been arranged for a wide variety of instruments and ensembles. Brahms originally wrote the version for piano four hands and later arranged the first ten dances for solo piano.

==Background==
Brahms&#x27; &quot;Hungarian Dances&quot; should be placed in the context of interest in folk music. Both Haydn and Boccherini refer frequently to gypsy music, but in Brahms&#x27; day it was Franz Liszt with his Hungarian rhapsodies who was an inspiration to Brahms, both artistically and financially (despite their differences in musical philosophy). In 1850 Brahms met the Hungarian violinist Ede Reményi and accompanied him in a number of recitals over the next few years. This was his introduction to &quot;gypsy-style&quot; music such as the &quot;csárdás&quot;, which was later to prove the foundation of his most lucrative and popular compositions, the two sets of &quot;Hungarian Dances&quot; (published 1869 and 1880).

Only numbers 11, 14 and 16 are entirely original compositions. The better-known Hungarian Dances include Nos. 1 and 5, the latter of which was based on the csárdás &quot;&quot; (Memories of Bártfa) by Hungarian composer Béla Kéler, which Brahms mistakenly thought was a traditional folksong. A footnote on the Ludwig-Masters edition of a modern orchestration of Hungarian Dance No. 1 states: &quot;The material for this dance is believed to have come from the &quot;Divine Csárdás&quot; (ca. 1850) of Hungarian composer and conductor Miska Borzó.&quot;

== Arrangements &amp; influences ==
Brahms wrote orchestral arrangements for Nos. 1, 3 and 10. Other composers have orchestrated the other dances. These composers include Antonín Dvořák (Nos. 17 to 21), Andreas Hallén (Nos. 2, 4 and 7), Paul Juon (No. 4), Martin Schmeling (1864–1943) (Nos. 5 to 7), Hans Gál (Nos. 8 and 9), (Nos. 5, 6 in 1876 and 11 to 16 in 1885) and Robert Schollum (Nos. 4, 8 and 9). More recently, Iván Fischer has orchestrated the complete set.

The first ten dances were arranged for solo piano by Brahms himself. The remaining dances (Nos. 11-21) were arranged for solo piano by Theodor Kirchner. Nos. 11-16 are also arranged for simplified piano by Robert Keller.

Hungarian Dances have also been arranged for violin and piano, most notably by Paul Klengel (Nos. 1-3, 5-8, 13, 17, 19-21) and Fritz Kreisler (No. 17).

&quot;Hungarian Dance No. 4 in F♯ minor&quot; was used by composer John Morris as the main theme in his score for Mel Brooks&#x27; comedy film &quot;The Twelve Chairs&quot; (1970), set in the Soviet Union in the 1920s. This included both the film&#x27;s instrumental score and a song, &quot;Hope for the Best, Expect the Worst&quot;, with lyrics by Mel Brooks, all based on the Johannes Brahms composition.

==Recordings==
The earliest known recording of any movement of Hungarian Dances was a condensed piano-based rendition of Hungarian Dance No. 1, from 1889, played by Brahms himself, and was known to have been recorded by Theo Wangemann, an assistant to Thomas Edison. The following dialogue can be heard in the recording itself, before the music starts:
* Theo Wangemann: &quot;Dezember 1889.&quot;
* Johannes Brahms: &quot;Im Haus von Herrn Doktor Fellinger bei Herrn Doktor Brahms, Johannes Brahms.&quot; (English: &quot;In the house of Dr. Fellinger with Dr. Brahms, Johannes Brahms.&quot;)

Joseph Joachim, a close friend of Brahms, in collaboration with an unnamed accompanying pianist, recorded their own renditions of Hungarian Dances Nos. 1 and 2.

Leopold Stokowski&#x27;s very first recordings with the Philadelphia Orchestra were devoted to Hungarian Dances Nos. 5 and 6. They were recorded by the Victor Talking Machine Company in Camden, New Jersey in 1917.

The Boston Pops Orchestra with conductor Arthur Fiedler recorded Hungarian Dances Nos. 5 and 6 in Symphony Hall, Boston. Hungarian Dance No. 5 was recorded on June 25, 1950. It was released by RCA Victor as catalog number 10-3254B (in USA) and by EMI on the His Master&#x27;s Voice label as catalog number B 10631. Hungarian Dance No. 6 was recorded on June 16, 1950. It was released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number (in the USA) and by EMI on the His Master&#x27;s Voice label as catalog number B 10631. These were 78 rpm discs. The pieces were arranged by Albert Parlow.

Julius Katchen and Jean-Pierre Marty recorded the complete set in the 1960s, as part of Katchen&#x27;s recording of the complete piano works of Brahms. Aloys and Alfons Kontarsky recorded them in 1976 for Deutsche Grammophon, released originally on LP catalog number 2530 710. The French sister duo-pianists Katia and Marielle Labèque recorded the complete set of dances for Philips in 1981, as catalog number 4164592.

Dances Nos. 17, 19 and 21 were recorded in 1966 by the Hollywood Symphony Orchestra for their album &quot;Orchestral Fireworks&quot;, released in the UK on the Music For Pleasure label.

The first complete orchestral versions were recorded by Mario Rossi conducting the Vienna State Opera Orchestra in 1956 and released on Vanguard Records. Robert Schollum&#x27;s orchestrations of nos. 4, 8 and 9 were commissioned by Vanguard for this recording. 

They were again recorded by Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt conducting the NDR Radio Symphony Hamburg in 1967 and released in the USA on Vanguard. The first digital by Claudio Abbado and the Vienna Philharmonic for Deutsche Grammophon was recorded in 1982, released on LP as and on CD as . (Citation: https://www.discogs.com/release/11730199-Brahms-NDR-Symphony-Orchestra-Of-Hamburg-Hans-Schmidt-Isserstedt-Hungarian-Dances-Complete)

They were again recorded digitally by and the Budapest Symphony Orchestra for Naxos in 1988, released on CD as 8.550110. This recording was awarded a Rosette by &quot;The Penguin Guide&quot;. Their review called this recording &quot;sheer delight from beginning to end... an outright winner among the available versions.&quot;

Another set of complete orchestral versions was recorded in 1998 by Iván Fischer conducting the Budapest Festival Orchestra on the Philips Records label, released as .

<doc id="903801" wikidata="Q323353" url="?curid=903801" title="Dale Brown">
<text>Dale Brown (born November 2, 1956) is an American writer and aviator known for aviation techno-thriller novels. At least thirteen of his novels have been &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Sellers.

==Early life==
Brown was born in Buffalo, New York, and was one of six children. At 15, he began flying instruction, eventually earning a private pilot&#x27;s license. He graduated in 1978 from Penn State University with a degree in Western European history.

==Career==
===Military===
Brown joined the Air Force ROTC while in college. He received a commission in the United States Air Force in 1978. He was a navigator-bombardier (now known as a weapon systems officer (WSO)) in the B-52G Stratofortress long-range heavy bomber and the FB-111A Aardvark medium range fighter-bomber.

Brown received several military decorations and awards, including the Air Force Commendation Medal, the Combat Crew Award, and the Marksmanship ribbon. He rose to the rank of Captain and has 2,500 hours of flight time in B-52s.

He left the Air Force in 1986, having never seen combat. He is a Life Member of the Air Force Association and the U.S. Naval Institute.

===Writing===
Brown&#x27;s first paid writing was a review of &quot;Fort Apocalypse&quot; for &quot;Compute!&#x27;s Gazette&quot;. In 1986, while still in the Air Force at Mather Air Force Base in Sacramento County, California, he wrote his first book, &quot;Flight of the Old Dog&quot;. His novels have been published in 11 languages and distributed to over 70 countries. He published 11 bestsellers in 11 years.

Brown has been represented by literary agent Robert Gottlieb of Trident Media Group.

==Bibliography==
Brown tends to stay with the same characters over a long period of time. Many of the characters introduced in &quot;Flight of the Old Dog&quot; are still around for the latest, although a few have been killed in previous books. Most of his books occur in the same timeline, with a few exceptions.

* &quot;Silver Tower (novel)&quot;, published after &quot;Flight of the Old Dog&quot;, a mostly independent novel with no character references, is first linked by mention of the SkyBolt module in &quot;Battle Born&quot;. However, the novel is merged into the Patrick McLanahan saga when some of its main characters and the fictional military space station &quot;Armstrong&quot; appear in &quot;Strike Force&quot;.

* &quot;Chains of Command&quot;, which features Rebecca Furness and Darren Mace, was actually a separate series, but later, the characters reappeared in &quot;Battle Born&quot; and were merged into the Dreamland and McLanahan series.

* &quot;Hammerheads&quot; focuses on Admiral Ian Hardcastle, who later reappeared in &quot;Storming Heaven&quot;. However, the book can be part of the overall Patrick McLanahan continuity because of his and General Elliott&#x27;s appearances, plus the book taking place over two years since the events of &quot;Flight of the Old Dog&quot; (which is referred to in passing). 

* The &quot;Dreamland&quot; series coauthored with Jim DeFelice covers the gaps between the Patrick McLanahan series novels. While most of the old characters are only mentioned in passing, some of the technology depicted in the series was later merged into the main series, starting with &quot;Air Battle Force&quot;.

*Henri Cazaux, the main villain of &quot;Storming Heaven&quot;, was referred to in &quot;The Tin Man&quot;. His own right-hand man, Gregory Townsend, would be the book&#x27;s main antagonist.

===Patrick McLanahan series===

Brown&#x27;s novels mostly center on a character named Patrick McLanahan, whose exploits as a US Air Force officer date back over 25 years.

# &quot;Flight of the Old Dog&quot; (1987): A Soviet anti-ballistic missile laser destroys US strategic assets while the Kremlin argues the system&#x27;s legality before the UN. USAF Lieutenant General Bradley Elliott recruits a team of officers to work on a modified B-52 bomber, called the &quot;Old Dog&quot;. A raid on Dreamland, itself coupled by the discovery of a B-1 Lancer strike team on the Soviet laser, forces the Old Dog crew to take the mission on themselves. In a heroic act, crewmember David Luger risks his life to save the bomber from destruction.
# &quot;Sky Masters&quot; (1991): The pullout of US forces from the Philippines in 1994 sparks Chinese plans to occupy the Spratly Islands and Mindanao with the connivance of a Filipino Communist vice-president who declares a coup. McLanahan and the heavy bombers of the US Air Battle Force lead the American counterattack over Davao City. The novel also has a small cameo appearance by &quot;Day of the Cheetah&quot; antagonist Kenneth Francis James.
# &quot;Night of the Hawk&quot; (1992): A simple defector extraction raid in Lithuania in late 1992 uncovers evidence that a member of the Old Dog crew, David Luger, survived the events of &quot;Flight of the Old Dog&quot; and was brainwashed to work on a new stealth bomber at a secret facility in Vilnius. Amidst the political upheaval in the country, General Elliott, McLanahan, and John Ormack join a US Marine contingent in assaulting the facility and rescuing Luger.
# &quot;Day of the Cheetah&quot; (1989): In 1996, Kenneth Francis James—a Soviet deep-cover agent posing as a USAF officer—steals the new &quot;Dreamstar&quot; thought-controlled fighter. McLanahan and the High-Technology Aerospace Weapons Center scramble to recover it from James, or destroy it if necessary.
# &quot;Shadows of Steel&quot; (1996): In May 1997, the US initiates covert operations to stop Iran&#x27;s new carrier task force from controlling the Persian Gulf sea lanes. Now running a diner in Sacramento after the fiasco depicted in &quot;Day of the Cheetah&quot;, Patrick McLanahan is recalled to active duty to fly a B-2 Spirit mission over Iran.
# &quot;Fatal Terrain&quot; (1997): Set a month after the ending of &quot;Shadows of Steel&quot;, Taiwan&#x27;s declaration of independence forces China to go to war. The Old Dog crew is brought back to save the world from Chinese domination, but not everyone could come home alive.
# &quot;The Tin Man&quot; (1998): A few months after the events of &quot;Fatal Terrain&quot;, Patrick McLanahan faces a new enemy, right in his home turf in Sacramento, California. The novel also introduces his brother, Sacramento police officer Paul McLanahan.
# &quot;Battle Born&quot; (1999): In 2000, McLanahan is assigned to turn a group of Nevada Air Guard B-1 pilots into America&#x27;s premier tactical air strike force. A new threat created by a sudden reunification of the Korean peninsula hastens the training.
# &quot;Warrior Class&quot; (2001): Set in 2001, Russian billionaire Pavel Kazakov builds a huge pipeline through the Balkans with the support of the Russian Army and everybody gets rich. To make the scheme viable, he also finances the deployment of a secret stealth fighter-bomber originally developed by the same company that employed Dave Luger. However, a new US president and his brand of leadership tie McLanahan&#x27;s hands from doing anything about Kazakov.
# &quot;Wings of Fire&quot; (2002): When Libya plots to invade and control Egypt, McLanahan and his advanced force, the Night Stalkers, are sent in to stop the chaos. However, the consequences are personal for his family.
# &quot;Air Battle Force&quot; (2003): The US deploys a new aerial strike force into Turkmenistan to fight a ragtag Taliban army and later a Russian invasion. The humiliation forces Russian General Anatoly Gryzlov to launch a coup, especially after McLanahan&#x27;s forces level the Russian Air Force&#x27;s Engels Air Force Base.
# &quot;Plan of Attack&quot; (2004): Out of revenge for what happened in &quot;Air Battle Force&quot;, General Gryzlov orders a nuclear bomber strike against the United States, eliminating nearly all of its land-based strategic forces. Demoted to brigadier general and reassigned off the Air Battle Force after defying one order too many in Turkmenistan, McLanahan tries to convince the Air Force leadership about the threat.

===Independent series===
* &quot;Silver Tower&quot; (1988): The US successfully activates the new military space station &quot;Armstrong&quot; in the then-future of 1992. Feeling threatened by the station&#x27;s potential for US space supremacy, the USSR plots to destroy it as part of a plan to invade Iran and threaten the Persian Gulf oil reserves. It is up to General Jason St Michael and his team aboard the Armstrong to stop Soviet forces coming into the area.

===Short stories===
* &quot;Leadership Material&quot; (2001): Set in the Arabian Peninsula post-Desert Storm in March 1991, then-Major McLanahan flies with the &quot;Old Dog&quot; crew in combating an Iranian Blackjack-E, a version of the TU-160 Blackjack bomber that was reportedly upgraded with designs lifted from the &quot;Megafortress&quot;. Meanwhile, back in the US, Colonel Norman Weir, an officer on the USAF promotions board, reviews McLanahan&#x27;s service record as a candidate for lieutenant colonel and recommends his discharge. However, the US president orders Weir to destroy the discharge form, saying that McLanahan has proven himself as an officer (without elaborating further). The story was Brown&#x27;s contribution to Stephen Coonts&#x27; &quot;Combat&quot; war stories anthology. It has peripheral references to &quot;Hammerheads&quot; and &quot;Sky Masters&quot; (although a canonical error).

==Personal life==
In 1994, Brown resided in Folsom, California, near Sacramento, California.

He enjoys flying his plane, a Cessna P337 Skymaster. He is a squadron commander and mission pilot in the Civil Air Patrol. On the ground, he enjoys tennis, motorcycling, skiing, scuba diving, and ice hockey.

Brown is married. His wife Diane is a retired Sacramento police lieutenant and (like her husband) is also a pilot. They have a son, Hunter, and they reside near Lake Tahoe, Nevada.

===Legal issues===
In April 2004, Brown pleaded guilty to charges of tax fraud. He was charged with creating companies in the West Indies for the purposes of receiving tax deductions from fictitious expenses. The fictitious expenses amounted to more than $440,000, which Brown claimed on his 1998 income tax filing. He then used the tax deductions to remodel his home in Incline Village, Nevada.

Brown was sentenced to 6 months house arrest and were suspended after 5 months. He was sentenced to 5 years probation and were suspended after 3 years. His voting privileges will be restored in 2026.

<doc id="903812" wikidata="Q2133880" url="?curid=903812" title="Ray Carney">
<text>Raymond Carney (born February 28, 1947) is an American scholar and critic, primarily known for his work as a film theorist, although he writes extensively on American art and literature as well. He is known for his study of the works of actor and director John Cassavetes. He teaches in the Film and Television department of the Boston University College of Communication at Boston University and has published several books on American art and film.

==Background==
Carney was educated at Harvard (&quot;magna cum laude&quot;) and Rutgers University. Professor Carney taught literature at Middlebury College and Humanities at the University of Texas at Dallas. He was also a William Rice Kimball Fellow at Stanford University, working on a study of performance art, particularly the stand-up comedy of Richard Pryor and Lenny Bruce.

==Viewpoints==
Carney is highly critical of Hollywood filmmaking, and the way it is approached from an academic standpoint. He is well known for the controversial stridency with which he attacks directors such as Steven Spielberg, Brian De Palma, the Coen brothers, Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Orson Welles, David Lynch and Quentin Tarantino, whom he describes as tricksters using empty style and pseudo-intellectualism to score points with an “in” crowd. Carney often refers to Spielberg’s output after &quot;Schindler’s List&quot; (1993) as “Steven ‘Please take me seriously’ Spielberg movies.” Carney is as critical of the academic establishment that gives plaudits to these directors as he is of the filmmakers themselves.

In his 1989 &quot;The Alaska Quarterly Review&quot; essay on Woody Allen, “Modernism for the Millions,” Carney notes that Allen uses humour in his films to defuse situations that he, the filmmaker, is uncomfortable with, such as drug use and depression. At the same time, Allen wants to get credit for bringing up these issues, as that is what serious artists do.

Carney argues that an emphasis on interpreting symbolism shows a “high school” understanding of art, and that this kind of “decoder ring” approach is in place because it is easier to grasp and makes scholars feel more important and esoteric. Carney believes that the meaning of a creative work lies at its surface, and imagines a world where art is appreciated for what it objectively contains rather than what is read into it, an aesthetic he refers to as pragmatic. He argues that audiences can, for example, simply appreciate the acting in a film and gain meaning from this, what the characters actually say and do, and the tonal shifts that accompany these actions.

==Controversy==
He feuded with Gena Rowlands over his discovery of the first cut of the 1958 film &quot;Shadows&quot; claiming to be his own and not of Faces International.

In May 2012, Mark Rappaport filed a lawsuit against Carney for refusing to give back more than two dozen film reels, 16 videotapes, 14 scripts, and papers including rough drafts of Rappaport’s movies which the filmmaker had previously entrusted to Carney to transport to Paris. Carney, however, has maintained that Rappaport actually gave him the items as gifts and is now engaging in cyberbullying against him. No written agreement was signed when the material was shipped to Carney. The suit was dropped in September of that same year, due to rising legal costs, although Rappaport later started an online petition demanding that Carney return the items.

Carney met Cassavetes during the last years of the director’s life, and was the first American scholar to write books on the director. In 2003, Carney’s research led to the discovery of the first version of Cassavetes’s seminal work &quot;Shadows&quot;. Besides his work on John Cassavetes, Carney has written on Carl Theodor Dreyer, Frank Capra, and Mike Leigh. He has also written extensively on American literature (particularly the works of Henry James) and art (particularly painters such as Sargent and Hopper).

<text>Pieris angelika (Arctic white) is a cold-climate butterfly of the family Pieridae. Its main range is in north-western Canada (Yukon, Northwest Territories, north-western British Columbia) and Alaska. Its taxonomic name may change in the future, because it was previously described and named before 1983.

==Features==
Adult butterflies have an average wingspan of 33 to 42mm.

Viewed from above, males are mostly white, with a thin black line in the costa and margin. Black shading can also be seen on the wings. The underside of the males can be a pale yellow, and are often seen with dark green veins. 

Females can be white or yellow and often exhibit dark scaling and patches along the veins.
