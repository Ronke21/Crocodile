<text>Reining is a western riding competition for horses where the riders guide the horses through a precise pattern of circles, spins, and stops. All work is done at the lope (a version of the horse gait more commonly known worldwide as the canter), or the gallop (the fastest of the horse gaits). Originating from working cattle, reining requires the horse to be responsive and in tune with its rider, whose aids should not be easily seen, and judges the horse on its ability to perform a set pattern of movements. The horse should be willingly guided or controlled with little or no apparent resistance and dictated to completely. A horse that pins his ears, conveys a threat to his rider, refuses to go forward, runs sideways, bounces his rear, wrings his tail in irritation, or displays an overall poor attitude is not being guided willingly, and is judged accordingly. If a horse jogs or breaks gait it is a 0.

==Origins==
Throughout the history of the Americas, dating back to the earliest Spanish settlers in what today is Mexico and the Southwestern United States, including Texas and California, ranchers needed to manage cattle from horseback. Cattle were moved, branded, doctored, sorted, and herded, often on open range without the benefit of fences, barns or other means of holding the animals. A good cowboy needed a quick and nimble horse, one that could change directions quickly, stop &quot;on a dime,&quot; and sprint after an errant cow. The horse needed to be controlled mostly by legs and weight, ridden with only one hand and a light touch on the reins, so that the cowboy&#x27;s attention could also be on tasks that could include handling a lariat (to rope cattle), opening a gate, or simply waving a hand, hat or rope to move along a reluctant herd animal. Informal demonstrations of these ideal characteristics amongst ranch cowboys and vaqueros evolved into the sport of reining, as well as the related events of cutting and working cow horse as well as several other horse show classes.

Other nations with traditions of herding livestock on vast areas, such as Australia and Argentina, developed similar traditions that have blended into the sport as it has expanded worldwide.

==Movements==

The reining pattern includes an average of eight to twelve movements which must be executed by the horse. Patterns require the following movements:
*Circles: the horse must perform large, fast circles at a near-gallop and smaller, slow circles at a lope. They should be perfectly round, with the rider dictating the pace of the horse. There should be an easily seen change of speed as the rider transitions from the large, fast to the small, slow circles. Most circles incorporate changes of direction that require a flying change of lead.
*Flying lead change: the horse changes its leading front and hind legs at the lope mid-stride, during the suspension phase of the gait. The horse should not break gait nor change speed. It can be used for as turning and direction. While completing a change at speed can improve one&#x27;s score, precision is the most important factor in judging: A horse taking more than one stride to complete the change, or a horse that changes early, late, or that changes only the front feet and not the hind feet will be penalized.
*Rundown: the horse gallops or &quot;runs&quot; along the long side of the arena, at least from the fence or rail. A rundown is a required movement prior to a sliding stop and a rollback to the designated direction (either towards the judge or towards the nearest wall depending on the pattern).

*Sliding Stop: the horse accelerates to a gallop and then suddenly comes to a complete halt, planting its hind feet in the footing and allowing its hind feet to slide several feet, while continuing to let its front feet &quot;walk&quot; forward. The back should be raised upward and hindquarters come well underneath. A particularly powerful stop may, depending on arena conditions, produce flying dirt and a cloud of dust. The movement should finish in a straight line, and the horse&#x27;s position should not change. This movement is a crowd favorite, along with spins (see below).
*Back or Backup: the horse backs up quickly for at least . The horse must back in a perfectly straight line, stop when asked and hesitate a moment before the next movement. It is judged on how quick, smooth and straight the line is.
*Rollback: the horse immediately, without hesitation, performs a 180-degree turn after halting from a sliding stop, and immediately goes forward again into a lope. The horse must turn on its hindquarters, bringing its hocks well under, and the motion should be continuous with no hesitation.

*Spins or Turnarounds: beginning from a standstill, the horse spins 360 degrees or more (up to four and one-quarter full turns) in place around its stationary inside hind leg. The hind pivot foot remains in essentially the same location throughout the spin, though the horse will pick it up and put it down as it turns. Spins are judged on correctness, smoothness, and cadence. Speed adds to the difficulty and will improve the score of a correctly done spin. A pattern requires at least one set of spins in each direction. Horses must stop the spin in the designated place or be penalized for over or under spinning. The term Pivot is sometimes used to describe a turn on the hindquarters of up to 360 degrees where the horse has to keep a rear pivot foot stationary. In 4-H competition, pivots of 90, 180, or 360 degrees are sometimes used in pattern classes to introduce youth riders to reining concepts.
*Pause or Hesitate: the horse is asked to stand still for a few seconds to &quot;settle&quot; between certain movements in the reining pattern, particularly after spins. Pauses are not judged as a movement &quot;per se&quot;, but a horse that is ill-mannered or behaves with impatience when asked to wait will be penalized.

==Scoring==
Scoring is on the basis of 70 and it is an average score for a horse that made no errors but also did not perform maneuvers with a higher level of difficulty. Points for each maneuver are added or subtracted by -, 1-, and -point increments for each of the 7 to 8 maneuvers in the designated pattern as follows: 
*− for an extremely poor execution
*−1 for very poor
*− for poor
*0 for correct with no degree of difficulty
*+ for good execution
*+1 for very good
*+ for excellent

Each part of the pattern is judged on precision, smoothness, and finesse. The &quot;degree of difficulty&quot; for each maneuver, typically related to speed and agility, is also assessed. Increased speed increases the difficulty of most movements and the potential for a high score. For example, a perfectly executed fast spin will score higher than an equally perfectly executed slow one. A score below 70 reflects deductions for poorly performed movements or penalties, a score above 70 reflects that some or all movements were above average.

In addition to the scores for each maneuver, a large variety of penalties may be assessed for specific infractions. Penalties may range from a half-point to five points for each infraction, and in some cases a significant error may result in a zero score for the run. Certain misbehaviors may incur penalty points beyond a poor score for a given maneuver. Significant errors, such as going off pattern or using illegal equipment, will result in a &quot;zero score&quot;. Under NRHA rules, horses with a zero score cannot earn a placing or advance in a multi-go event, though they may be eligible for a payout if there is a small number of horses in the entire competition. Some sanctioning organizations other than NRHA may allow a horse in a small class to earn an award for last place. Major mistakes, such as failure to present the horse for an equipment check, a rider with illegal equipment or one who abuses the animal in specified ways, result in a &quot;no score,&quot; which prevents the horse from earning any award or payout, even if it is the only horse in the class.

==The horse==
Reining may be performed by any horse, but the Stock horse breeds, particularly the American Quarter Horse, dominate the field. The reining horse must be agile, quick, and very responsive to the rider&#x27;s commands. Powerful hindquarters are required to hold position in a sliding stop or a rollback, excellent coordination is required for proper spins and flying lead changes. Correct leg conformation is essential, as the limbs and joints are often under considerable stress in competition. The horse must also have an excellent temperament to perform with both speed and precision.

==Equipment and attire==
Riders must use a western saddle. Spurs are allowed, but whips are not. Bridles are western-styled, without a noseband or cavesson. The bosal style hackamore is also allowed on &quot;junior&quot; horses. There are very strict rules about what types of bits and bosals are legal.

For protection, horses usually wear &quot;brushing boots&quot; on their lower front legs as well as &quot;skid boots&quot; on their hind fetlocks. Bell boots, which wrap around the pastern and protect the hoof and coronary band, are also usually seen, sometimes only on the front feet, other times on all four feet. Exercise bandages are also another form of protection that is used, this helps give support to the tendons and ligaments, and prevents bruising and irritation. These can be used on all four legs but if wrapped improperly can cause damage.

Reining horses are usually fitted with special horseshoes on the hind feet called slide plates. Slide plates have wider bar steel and are smoother than regular horseshoes, with even the nail heads filed to be flush with the shoe. When the horse plants its hind feet for a sliding stop, the shoes allow the hind legs to slide along the ground with less resistance. Slide plates often have long trailers to help the horse&#x27;s hind legs slide in a straight path as well as a rolled toe so that the front of the hoof does not accidentally catch the ground.

Riders must wear a long-sleeved shirt, jeans, and cowboy boots. In most competitions, they also wear chaps. Gloves are optional. There has historically been less difference between men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s attire in reining than in most western events, though women&#x27;s clothing is more influenced by fashion trends from Western pleasure competition, and thus women sometimes wear brighter colors, and are more apt to add a decorated jacket or vest, though usually not as flashy as in other horse show events. Wearing a certified equestrian helmet is permitted by some organizations, though not commonly used.

==Bit and Hackamore rules==
Horses in most types of reining competition are required to perform in a curb bit. In most cases, riders with a horse in a curb must give all rein commands with only one hand.

Riders may use both hands when a horse is ridden with a snaffle bit or a bosal hackamore. However, snaffles and hackamores ridden with both hands are usually limited only to special classes for horses between the ages of three and five years old. Most of the time, with the exception of &quot;freestyle&quot; classes, snaffle bit and hackamore horses do not compete directly against curb bit horses, though specific details vary depending on the particular sanctioning organization. In the last thirty years, the snaffle bit is the more common headgear used on younger horses, but in the past, the hackamore was more common. Some local or regional competitions offer a non-sanctioned &quot;novice horse&quot; division where horses of any age who have limited experience as reining horses can be ridden two-handed in a snaffle. 

Sometimes reining classes at breed shows are split into &quot;junior horse&quot; and &quot;senior horse&quot; divisions. Depending on the breed, Junior horses are either 3, 4 or 5 years old, and allowed to show in a snaffle or bosal. Senior horses who age out of the junior horse divisions at age six must be shown in a curb. The rules have changed over the years to reduce the stress on young horses. Junior horse divisions at one time were limited to horses that were only 3 and, sometimes, 4 years old. Expansion to age five parallels the standards set by the FEI and in endurance competitions, recognizing that the physical and mental development of most young horses is not considered complete until that time. Further, though many western stock horse breeds are started under saddle at the age of two, they generally are not physically or mentally ready to be entered into any type of reining competition at that age and in some cases are prohibited from entering any performance class until at least years old.
Both the NRHA and many breed associations offer &quot;snaffle bit futurities,&quot; usually for three-year-old horses, which pay very large purses.

==Reining competition==
Reining as a sport was first recognized by the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) in 1949, and later by the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) in its western division and within a number of its breed divisions. The National Reining Horse Association (NRHA) was formed in 1966 in the United States, and developed a worldwide membership as well as standardized rules and patterns that significantly influenced other organizations, including the AQHA and USEF. The sport of reining became an FEI-recognized discipline in 2000, and FEI-sanctioned reining competitions are held across the world, including at the World Equestrian Games. In 2011, USA Reining was established to serve as the reining sport affiliate for the USEF and FEI competition structure in the United States.

Individual divisions at a reining competition vary with the sanctioning organization. However, standard classes include those limited to junior or senior horses, to horses of a specific age (such as three-year-olds), classes for professional, &quot;non-pro,&quot; or amateur riders (those who do not work with horses for pay), youth riders of various ages, adult riders over age 40 or 50, as well as open events for all competitors. Classes may also be limited by the experience level of the horse or the rider.

===National===
In individual nations where reining competitions are held, national organizations usually oversee the sport. Reining classes can be held at a stand-alone competition just for reiners, or as one category within many different classes offered at a horse show. For example, in the United States, the National Reining Horse Association (NRHA) creates patterns and develops judging standards, sanctioning events open to all breeds. However, the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) and its reining discipline affiliate, USA Reining, are the national organizations overseeing FEI and high performance competition in the USA, but also work with the NRHA in non-FEI open reining competition sanctioned by the USEF, and in individual horse breed show reining competition governed by the USEF, such as Morgans or Arabians. Breed organizations that sanction their own shows, including those for Quarter Horses (AQHA), Appaloosas (ApHC), and American Paint Horses (APHA) also cooperate with the NRHA.

===International===
International competitions are regulated by the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI). Reining is growing in popularity around the world, including Europe and Australia. It was added as a part of the World Equestrian Games, beginning in 2002.

===Freestyle===

Freestyle reining allows a horse and rider team to incorporate reining movements into a three and one-half minute musical routine, akin to the &quot;KUR&quot; Freestyle competition in Dressage, but with elements that resemble the freestyle events in human competitions such as figure skating. Under NRHA rules, costumes are allowed, though not required; riders may ride with one, two or even no hands on any type of NRHA approved bit; props, within certain limits, are allowed; and the show management may allow special arena lighting. Freestyle reining competitions have no specific rules as to saddle, though humane equipment is required. Allowing &quot;no hands&quot; means that some competitors may perform without a bridle, which increases the difficulty of the movements. The rider must include a specified number of spins, stops and flying lead changes in a performance. Rollbacks, rein backs and dressage type maneuvers such as the half-pass may be added and scored. Competitors are judged on technical merit and artistic impression. At some competitions, an applause meter is added and may contribute to the artistic impression portion of the score.

College Level

Equestrian is a Division 1 and Division 3 sport recognized by the NCAA. single discipline teams are in Division 3, only competing in English, and Division I teams consist of English and western, including reining, horsemanship, flat, and jumping.

<text>CogPrints is an electronic archive where authors can self-archive papers in various fields related to cognitive science. These fields include psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, and areas of computer science such as artificial intelligence, robotics, vision, learning, speech, and artificial neural networks. The archive also includes works in philosophy (e.g., philosophy of mind, language, knowledge, science, logic), biology (e.g., ethology, behavioral ecology, sociobiology, behavior genetics, evolutionary theory), medicine (e.g., psychiatry, neurology, human genetics, imaging), and anthropology (e.g., primatology, cognitive ethnology, archaeology, paleontology). Additionally, CogPrints hosts research from other areas of the physical, social, and mathematical sciences that are relevant to the study of cognition.

The archive was launched in 1997 and is moderated by Stevan Harnad. As of 2025, it contains over 4,000 freely downloadable articles.

CogPrints has been referenced alongside the physics archive arXiv as an example of the author self-archiving model within open access publishing. Over time, under the influence of the Open Archives Initiative and its OAI-PMH, the focus of self-archiving has shifted from centralized repositories like CogPrints to distributed self-archiving in institutional repositories.

CogPrints was among the first repositories to adopt OAI compliance. Its software was later converted into EPrints at the University of Southampton by Rob Tansley, who later contributed to the development of DSpace. EPrints is currently maintained by Christopher Gutteridge at Southampton.

<text>The Climate Change Levy (CCL) is a tax on energy delivered to non-domestic users in the United Kingdom. 

==Scope and purpose==
Introduced on 1 April 2001 under the Finance Act 2000, it was forecast to cut annual emissions by 2.5 million tonnes by 2010, and forms part of the UK&#x27;s Climate Change Programme. The levy applies to most energy users, with the notable exceptions of those in the domestic and transport sectors. Electricity from nuclear is taxed even though it causes no direct carbon emissions. Originally electricity generated from new renewables and approved cogeneration schemes was not taxed, but the July 2015 Budget removed this exemption from 1 August 2015, raising £450m/year.

==Rates==
From when it was introduced, the levy was frozen at 0.43p/kWh on electricity, 0.15p/kWh on coal and 0.15p/kWh on gas.

A reduction of up to 90% from the levy may be gained by energy-intensive users provided they sign a Climate Change Agreement.

Revenue from the levy was offset by a 0.3% employers&#x27; rate reduction in National Insurance. However, the Finance Act 2002 subsequently increased that rate by 1%, reversing the reduction. The revenue used to fund a number of energy efficiency initiatives such as The Carbon Trust. However, revenue recycling was removed at the Spending Review 2010, with the revenue going to the Exchequer. 

In the 2006 budget it was announced that the levy would in future rise annually in line with inflation, starting from 1 April 2007. In the 2018 Budget, it was announced that the rates of the Climate Change Levy would be adjusted until 2022 so that the gas rate reaches 60% of the electricity rate in 2021 to 2022. 

Rates have changed as tabulated below.

<doc id="905748" wikidata="Q7313126" url="?curid=905748" title="Renewables Obligation (United Kingdom)">
<text>The Renewables Obligation (RO) is a market support mechanism designed to encourage generation of electricity from eligible renewable sources in the United Kingdom. There are three related schemes for the three legal jurisdictions of the UK. In April 2002 the Renewables Obligation was introduced in England and Wales, and in Scotland as the Renewables Obligation (Scotland). The RO was later introduced in Northern Ireland in April 2005. In all cases, the RO replaced the Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation which operated from 1990.

The RO placed an obligation on licensed electricity suppliers in the United Kingdom to source an increasing proportion of electricity from renewable sources, similar to a renewable portfolio standard. This figure was initially set at 3% for the period 2002/03, and in 2010/11 it was 11.1% (4.0% in Northern Ireland). By 2020 it was almost half of all electricity in England, Wales and Scotland, and nearly 20% in Northern Ireland. An extension of the scheme from 2027 to 2037 was declared on 1 April 2010 and is detailed in the National Renewable Energy Action Plan.

The RO closed to new generation between March 2015 and March 2017, with some grace periods. It was replaced by the Contracts for Difference scheme. Accredited generating stations will continue to receive 20 years of support, until March 2037. 

==Implementation==
Suppliers meet their obligations by presenting Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) to Ofgem. Where suppliers do not have sufficient ROCs to cover their obligation, a payment is made into the buy-out fund. The buy-out price suppliers pay is a fixed price per MWh shortfall and is adjusted in line with the Retail Prices Index each year. The proceeds of the buy-out fund are paid back to suppliers in proportion to how many ROCs they have presented. For example, if they were to submit 5% of the total number of ROCs submitted they would receive 5% of the total funds that defaulting supply companies pay into the buy-out fund.

ROCs are intended to create a market, and be traded at market prices that differ from the official buy-out price. If there was an excess of renewable production beyond the supplier obligation, the price of ROCs would fall below the buy-out price. The price of ROCs could approach zero if renewable and non-renewable generation costs became similar, when there would be little or no subsidy of renewable generation. If there is less renewable production than the obligation, the price of ROCs would increase above the buy-out price, as purchasers anticipate later payments from the buy-out fund on each ROC.

Obligation periods run for one year, beginning on 1 April and running to 31 March. Supply companies have until the 31 August following the period to submit sufficient ROCs to cover their obligation, or to submit sufficient payment to the buy-out fund to cover the shortfall.

The cost of ROCs is effectively paid by electricity customers of supply companies that fail to present sufficient ROCs, whilst reducing the cost to customers of supply companies who submit large numbers of ROCs, assuming that all costs and savings are passed on to customers.

== Percentages and prices by year ==
The percentage of electricity to be supplied by renewable electricity under the scheme generally increased each year. This is set separately for Great Britain (England and Wales plus Scotland) and for Northern Ireland.
Sources:

== Certificates ==

A ROC is the green issued for eligible renewable electricity generated within the United Kingdom and supplied to customers in the United Kingdom by a licensed supplier. ROCs are issued by Ofgem to accredited renewable generators (or in the case of generating stations subject to a NFFO (non-fossil fuels obligation), Scottish Renewables Obligation or Northern Ireland NFFO contract, to the nominated electricity supplier). The Scottish Renewables Obligation was superseded by the Renewables Obligation (Scotland) in 2002.

The default is that one ROC is issued for each megawatt-hour (MWh) of eligible renewable output. Some technologies get more, some less. For instance, offshore wind installations receive 2 ROCs per MWh; onshore wind installations receive 0.9 ROCs per MWh and sewage gas-fired plants receive half a ROC per MWh.

ROCs are issued into the ROC Register and so are electronic certificates. Normally, a renewable generator will transfer the related ROCs through Ofgem&#x27;s electronic registry when it sells power to an electricity supplier.

== Legislation ==

The Utilities Act 2000 gives the Secretary of State the power to require electricity suppliers to supply a certain proportion of their total sales in the United Kingdom from electricity generated from renewable sources. A Renewables Obligation Order is issued annually detailing the precise level of the obligation for the coming year-long period of obligation and the level of the buy-out price. The Renewables Obligation (England and Wales) was introduced by the Department of Trade and Industry, the Renewables Obligation (Scotland) was introduced by the Scottish Executives and the Northern Ireland Renewables Obligation was introduced by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Investment (DETINI). The Orders were subject to review in 2005/06 and new Orders came into effect on 1 April 2006. The relevant pieces of legislation for the period April 2006 – March 2007 are:

*The Renewables Obligation Order 2006 (Statutory Instrument (SI) 2006 No. 1004)
*The Renewables Obligation (Scotland) Order 2006 (SI 2006 No. 173), and
*The Renewables Obligation Order (Northern Ireland) 2006 (SI 2006 No. 56).

All pieces of legislation are published on the National Archives legislation site.

== Ofgem&#x27;s role ==

Ofgem is the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets in Great Britain. The Orders detail Ofgem&#x27;s powers and functions to administer the Renewables Obligation. These functions include:

*Accrediting generating stations as being capable of generating electricity from eligible renewable sources
*Issuing ROCs and revoking these as necessary
*Establishing and maintaining a Register of ROCs
*Monitoring compliance with the requirements of the Orders
*Calculating annually the buy-out price
*Receiving buy-out payments and redistributing the buy-out fund
*Receiving late payments and redistributing the late payment fund, and
*Publishing an annual report on the operation of and compliance with the requirements of the Orders.

Ofgem also administers the Northern Ireland Renewables Obligation (NIRO) on behalf of the Northern Ireland Authority for Energy Regulation (NIAER).

==Types of energy eligible==
The following sources of electricity are eligible for ROCs (although the scheme is closed to new entrants):

*Biogas from anaerobic digestion
*Biomass
*Combined Heat and Power (CHP)
*Hydroelectricity
*Tidal power
*Wind power
*Photovoltaic cells
*Landfill gas
*Sewage gas
*Wave power

Co-firing of biomass is also eligible. Not all technologies which are eligible are actually supported, due to cost. Some renewable sources of electricity are not eligible for ROCs (e.g. larger hydroelectric schemes which were in operation before April 2002).

== Banding ==

The Renewables Obligation represents the UK Government&#x27;s main policy measure for stimulating the growth of electricity generation from renewable sources. The Government envisages that 30% of electricity demand will need to be generated by renewable sources in order for the UK to meet a legally binding EU target of obtaining 15% of energy from renewable sources by 2020.

The Renewables Obligation is a market-based mechanism designed to incentivise the generation of electricity from renewable energy sources over more traditional alternatives at a reasonable cost.

When it was first introduced in 2002, each form of renewable energy technology received the same level of support, namely one ROC/MWh of electricity generated. This was a conscious decision as the Government was keen to promote a market-led approach, emphasising competition between technologies to minimise cost, and did not want to distort the market by appearing to place the importance of certain technologies above others.

As a result, whilst being ostensibly technology-neutral, the Renewables Obligation in its original form in fact favoured the deployment of the more established, near-market technologies such as landfill gas and onshore wind, those which were most economically efficient, over less well developed technologies that were further from commercial viability.

A review of the performance of the Renewables Obligation was announced in 2003. Modelling of future deployment scenarios indicated that targets would not be met with current levels of support due to constraints on the availability and deployment of the most established technologies. A significant contribution would therefore be required from less mature technologies which lacked sufficient incentive to develop into feasible alternatives under the original scheme.

The Government announced its intention to reform the Renewables Obligation in 2006. Banding was introduced in 2009 to provide differing levels of support to groups of technologies depending upon their relative maturity, development cost and associated risk. Whilst increasing the incentive for technologies in the early stages of development this also allowed the level of support for well established technologies to be reduced to avoid over-subsidisation.

In reforming the Renewables Obligation in this way, and scheduling regular future reviews, the Government recognised that the market would not deliver the mix of renewable energy generation required to meet the targets if the incentives remained technology-neutral. It was therefore necessary for the Government to perform a continuing strategic role and retain the capability to intervene if necessary. The introduction of banding allowed the Government to steer industry towards investment in less well developed forms of renewable energy to enable them to contribute to meeting the long-term targets, rather than concentrating investment in technologies that are economically favourable in the short-term.

The Government has reviewed the banding levels for appropriate incentives for the period 2013–2017. These bands include a reduction in the tariff for onshore wind to 0.9 ROCs/MWh and an increase for small wave and tidal stream projects, under 30 MW, to 5 ROCs/MWh.

== Government review ==
The obligation was reviewed by government following a consultation period that finished in September 2007. The document at the centre of the consultation set out an amended form of the RO which will see different technologies earn different numbers of ROCs. This has not yet been adopted as policy.

On 22 January 2007, Ofgem called for the Renewables Obligation to be replaced, claiming that the scheme is a &#x27;very costly way&#x27; of supporting renewable electricity generation. In particular they are concerned that electricity customers pay for renewables projects even if they are not built due to problems obtaining planning permission, and the failure of the Renewables Obligation to link financial support for renewables to either the electricity price or the price of renewables in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme.

The British Wind Energy Association, whose members are major beneficiaries of the existing scheme, claims that Ofgem is partly responsible for the costs because it has failed to prioritise work on the National Grid which would allow more renewable capacity to be connected. They also stressed the need to maintain stability in the marketplace to maintain the confidence of investors.

The concerns of both bodies seem to be shared by the Renewable Energy Association.

The Scottish Wind Assessment Project has criticised the scheme for rewarding reductions in renewable electricity output: two electricity suppliers, Scottish and Southern Energy and Npower, down-rated several large hydro-power stations in order to qualify for Renewables Obligation Certificates.

== Electricity market reform and future ==

The UK Government proposed wide-ranging reforms to the UK electricity market which saw feed-in tariffs with contracts for difference (CfD) replace the Renewables Obligation as the main renewable generation support mechanism. Unlike ROCs, CfDs will also be available to generators of nuclear electricity.

Other than with respect to large scale (&gt;5MW) solar photovoltaic power projects and onshore wind power projects, the Renewables Obligation remained open to new generation until 31 March 2017, allowing new renewable generation that comes online between 2014 (when it was anticipated the CfDs would start) and 2017 to choose between CfDs and ROCs. After that date, the government intended to close the Renewables Obligation to new generation while continuing existing ROCs, meaning that levels and length of support for existing participants in the Renewables Obligation would be maintained.

However, the UK government subsequently announced that it would bring forward the deadline for Renewables Obligation accreditation for large scale (&gt;5MW) solar photovoltaic power projects, to 1 April 2015. The government further announced on 18 June 2015 that it intended to close the Renewables Obligation to new onshore wind power projects on 1 April 2016, bringing the deadline forward by one year.

In addition to the introduction of feed-in tariffs, the UK Government&#x27;s proposed electricity market reform included two further initiatives to encourage the decarbonisation of electricity generation: a Carbon Price Floor and an Emissions Performance Standard.

=== Renewables Obligation closure dates and grace periods ===
The RO schemes closed to new generation as follows.

* England and Wales and Scotland:
** All, except solar PV and onshore wind: 31 March 2017
** Onshore wind: 12 May 2016
** Solar PV ≤ 5 MW: 31 March 2016
** Solar PV &gt; 5 MW: 31 March 2015
* Northern Ireland:
** All, except onshore wind: 31 March 2017
** Onshore wind ≤ 5 MW: 30 June 2016
** Onshore wind &gt; 5 MW: 31 March 2016

A series of grace periods were set out, where generating stations could be accredited after the closure date, subject to meeting the following criteria. The first three applied until 31 March 2018, with the latter three until 30 September 2018.

* Connection delays caused by grid and/or radar.
* Where signed investment contracts were terminated under specific circumstances.
* Where offshore wind or ACT projects could demonstrate evidence of substantial financial decisions and investments made before 9 November 2014.
* Projects allocated a place within the 400 MW dedicated biomass cap.
* Scottish offshore wind using test and demonstration or floating wind turbines.
* Where biomass with CHP projects could demonstrate evidence of substantial financial decisions and investments made before 9 November 2014.

<doc id="905751" wikidata="Q1577574" url="?curid=905751" title="Scion tC">
<text>The Scion tC is a compact car manufactured by Toyota under its Scion brand from 2004 to 2016 over two generations: ANT10 (2004–2010) and AGT20 (2011–2016). Both generations were built in Japan. The tC was introduced first in the United States for the 2005 model year and then, beginning with the second generation in the 2011 model year, in Canada as well. The tC was Scion&#x27;s best-selling model, constituting almost 40% of total Scion sales.

The name tC stands for &quot;touring coupe.&quot; Beginning in 2011, the tC was sold as the Toyota Zelas in the Middle East, China and South America, a name derived from &quot;&quot;, Italian for &quot;passionate&quot; or &quot;zealous.&quot;


== First generation (AT10; 2004) ==
Toyota debuted the production tC at the January 2004 NAIAS with sales beginning in May 2004 as a 2005 model year. The tC was a spiritual successor to the Celica intended to appeal to the millennial market. To this end, Toyota included numerous standard features, and optional features were easy to add. Standard equipment included power windows, cruise control, air conditioning, keyless entry, mirror-mounted turn signal lights, four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes, a 160-watt Pioneer sound system with CD player, 17-inch alloy wheels, and a panoramic moonroof. 

The tC shares its chassis with the Avensis and uses a MacPherson strut front and double wishbone rear suspension. It was offered at a low (base MSRP of US$17,670 for the 2009 model with manual transmission) with the pure &quot;monospec&quot; pricing marketing style that Toyota adopted. This generation was not sold in Canada.

A bare-bones version of the tC known as the Spec Package was offered without many of the standard accessories. The Spec Package replaced the alloy wheels with steel wheels and seven spoke wheel covers, and had simplified interior and exterior equipment, including a fixed rather than powered glass roof, deletion of cruise control and steering wheel audio controls, and urethane steering wheel finish instead of wrapped leather. Meant to serve as a blank slate to the tuner market, the Spec Package was offered in only four colors: Super White, Flint Mica, Black Sand Pearl and Classic Silver Metallic. MSRP was $1,400 less than the standard model. The Spec Package was discontinued for the 2009 model year.

The tC received a minor refresh in 2007 for the 2008 model year that included a revised grille and new, &quot;Altezza&quot;-styled head and taillights.

The model was Scion&#x27;s best seller, reaching over 79,125 units sold in 2006, but the car&#x27;s sales quickly dwindled by 2010, only moving 15,204 units. A 2nd generation was released for the 2011 model year.

&quot;Car and Driver&quot; praised the 2005 tC for its list of accessories but criticized its low headroom in the backseat and limited cargo room.

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) gave the Scion tC an &quot;Acceptable&quot; overall score in both the frontal offset and side impact crash tests.

All Scion tCs come standard with 4-wheel disc brakes with anti-lock brakes. For 2008 models, front seat-mounted side torso airbags, front and rear side curtain airbags, and a driver&#x27;s knee airbag became standard. Front passenger classification was also added, allowing dual stage control of airbag release dependent upon the weight of the passenger. Vehicle Stability Control was not originally offered until 2011 when Toyota began rolling out Electronic Stability Control (ESC) and Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) in all their vehicle brands, including Scion, sold in North America.

== Second generation (AT20; 2010) ==
===2011–2013===
The replacement model debuted at the April 2010 New York Auto Show, and appeared in U.S. dealerships in October 2010. It received a performance bump; with the new engine being carried over from the Toyota Camry being a 2.5 liter I4 &quot;2AR-FE&quot; engine producing and . Like the first generation, the chassis remained a variant of the Toyota Avensis, the model using the third generation chassis. Visually, the second generation is a toned-down variant of the Scion Fuse concept, featuring a similar rear quarter-panel window line to the concept but with xB-styled blacked-out A-pillars. The headlights, taillights and grille received a makeover to make the car seem more muscular and angular. It continued to receive very high safety marks, an all-glass roof, roomy interior, and a hatchback design. Other changes included a wider track, standard wheels, larger brake discs, a more powerful engine, a six-speed transmission, and a performance-tuned electric power steering system. The Scion tC now comes standard with Vehicle Stability Control. A TRD Supercharger was originally offered for the car as well as a special body kit by FiveAxis but both have since been discontinued. The tC remained popular in the tuner market, with many aftermarket performance upgrades still being available.

====Toyota Zelas====
At the 2010 Abu Dhabi Motor Show, the Scion tC was introduced under the Toyota Zelas nameplate. It later went on sale in the Middle East, with an aggressive body kit not featured on the Scion tC.

===2014–2016===
Initial sales of the second generation tC fell short of expectations, and to coincide with the launch of the Scion FR-S, the tC received a facelift for the 2014 model year. Inspired by the design of the FR-S, the 2014 tC received updated headlamps, grille, LED taillights, 18-inch alloy rims, body kit, a sport-tuned suspension, reworked faster shifting transmission, sport-tuned shocks, and a new touch screen audio system standard. For the first model year, Scion offered a Series 10 anniversary edition of the ten-year anniversary of the brand, limited to 3500 units. It included a new silver color, silver seat belts, a solar-powered illuminated shift knob, an LED Scion locator badge that lights up when the car is unlocked and a sequentially numbered interior badge. For the 2016 model year, the tC received some minor changes, such as a standard rear windshield wiper, new silver interior door handles, center console tray cover, and a leather-wrapped shift knob, the latter of which was formerly an optional upgrade.

The tC ended production in August 2016 after a final release edition as part of the phasing out of Scion brand. At 29, the tC sports coupe had the lowest-average age buyer in the industry according to Toyota.

==Toyota Racing Development (TRD)==
Similar to many other models of Toyota/Lexus/Scion, there are many upgrades available through the in house tuning shop Toyota Racing Development (TRD). TRD used to produce performance parts such as lowering springs and racing struts, full coil-over suspension systems, performance brake kits, rear sway bars, front strut tower bars, limited-slip differentials, upgraded clutches, axle-back exhausts and cold-air intakes for the Scion tC. Other cosmetic accessories such as TRD branded valve covers and oil caps were also offered.

TRD also offered a supercharger which is a rebadged Vortech supercharger that is capable of putting out , although when installed by a dealership and under warranty it is set at . Starting in 2008, Scion began making the supercharger with tamper-proof pulleys. As of mid-2009, TRD discontinued production of superchargers for the Scion tC.

In 2016, TRD discontinued production of all parts for the Scion tC.

==Release Series line==
Scion used a simplified &quot;pure price&quot; sales model that eschewed traditional factory options in favor of fixed base-vehicle pricing and buyer customization via dealer-installed accessories; hence, the tC was offered in a single standard trim, with exterior colors and the choice of transmission typically being the only factory options. However, some limited-production special editions with added factory equipment and exclusive colors were offered. Beginning in late spring 2004, Scion launched the Release Series (RS) line, limited quantities of their current vehicles pre-packaged with individual numbered badging, exclusive accessories, and other special features. Their exterior colors were bright hues (i.e. orange, yellow, red, blue, green).

==Sales==
The tC immediately became Scion&#x27;s most popular model, representing almost half of the brand&#x27;s sales in its peak years from 2005 to 2007, before being eclipsed by the redesigned xB in 2008. On release of the second-generation model, Scion hoped to sell 40,000–60,000 units annually once the economy recovered, but actual sales fell well short of this figure; analysts believe that sales were cannibalized by the similar FR-S. Despite the decline, the tC reclaimed and held its sales lead in the Scion lineup in 2011; it was ultimately the all-time best-selling Scion, constituting almost 40% of total Scion sales from 2004 through 2015, the brand&#x27;s last full year before being amalgamated into Toyota.

==Motorsport==

* With the demise of the Toyota Celica, the Scion tC was used for the Toyota Pro/Celebrity Race held during the Long Beach Grand Prix from 2006 to 2012, when it was replaced with the FR-S.
* There are several tCs in drag racing. Kenny Tran Jotech Motorsports, Leslie Armendariz Horizon Motorsports, Christian Rado World Racing, and Gary White (formerly Brad Personett)Titan Motorsports. Kenny Tran has been competing in the NHRA Sport Compact drag racing series hotrod class where he garnered the 2007 championship. Kenny cut his fastest run with 7.91 ET at during a NHRA race at Pomona Raceway. In 2007 and 2008, the Jotech Motorsports team won back-to-back Pro Import Class titles of the Battle Of The Imports drag series. Leslie Armendariz&#x27;s All-Motor Scion tC pushed a record setting 9.34 at . Christian Rado claimed 2nd place in the Pro FWD class of the 2008 BOTI nationals, he also later claimed a victory with the first FWD car to pass the seven second mark in a quarter mile with a blistering time of 6.97 seconds. Gary White won second place in the Extreme 10.5&quot; class of the ADRL Battle of the Belts World Finals.
*A 2011 tC was entered for the Formula Drift season in 2011 and is driven by Fredric Aasbo for Team Need For Speed. The 2AR-FE engine, being 2.5 liters was bumped up to 2.7 liters for over 500 hp.
* For the 2008 Formula Drift year, RS*R converted a Scion tC to rear wheel drive. This was done by taking a Toyota Avensis chassis (which the Scion tC is based on, originally an AWD platform) and converted it into RWD. The car was powered by a tuned BEAMS 3S-GE engine. Ken Gushi previously competed with this vehicle. After talks with teammate Christian Rado, Ken Gushi switched back to the factory 2AZ-FE engine, for the 2010 Formula Drift season. Ken Gushi stated &quot;&quot;Chris Rado, my Scion Team mate who runs his famous record tearing Scion tC uses the same base motor (of course for a different application) has proven this motor to withstand numbers up to 900hp, possibly even more&quot;.&quot; Ken Gushi&#x27;s tC is now pushing 790 hp.
* For the 2009/10 Formula Drift seasons, Tanner Foust competed using a Rockstar, AEM and Toyo Tire sponsored Scion tC converted to RWD, built by Papadakis Racing. It was powered by a TRD (Toyota Racing Development) built V8 taken from a former TRD Busch Series NASCAR stocker.
*For the 2008 KONI Challenge season, Dan Gardner and Craig Stanton drove a Scion tC in the Street Tuner (ST) Class. This marked Scion&#x27;s world-first professional start in road racing, and the team led the race for a period of time in a 50+ car field.
*For 2009, a Supercharged tC driven by team owner Dan Gardner was entered in the SCCA World Challenge Touring Car 2 (TC2) class. Scott Webb drove the car to victory, bringing Scion home their first-ever professional win.
*For the 2010 SCCA World Challenge season, Dan Gardner and Robert Stout drove a pair of supercharged Scion tCs in the Touring Car (TC) class. Robert Stout would win at the 2010 Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach, giving Scion its first-ever TC class win.
*In 2010 DG-Spec won the manufacturer&#x27;s championship in World Challenge for Scion. This marked the first time any Toyota brand had ever won the prestigious championship. No Toyota marque has won since.
*In 2011 Dan Gardner Spec won the WERC endurance series for the second time, capping off the performance with an entry into the 25 Hours of Thunderhill. The team led the race by as much as a whopping 28 laps before an engine failure brought the car into the pits. The team accomplished the impossible, doing a full motor-swap in 2 hours, and putting the car back on track with 25 minutes to go in the race, claiming the final step on the podium.
*In June 2012, Christian Rado used a Team Need for Speed AWD Scion tC at the Palm Beach International Raceway for a lap record of 1:20.810 minutes.

<text>The &quot;General Sherman&quot; incident () was the destruction in 1866 of the American merchant ship in the Taedong River during an unsuccessful and illegal attempt by the ship&#x27;s crew to open up trade with the isolationist Joseon dynasty of Korea. With the rapid increase in Western imperialism in Asia during the 19th century, Asian nations came under increasing pressure to end their isolationist policies. Despite China and Japan being forcibly opened to foreign trade by Western powers, Korea maintained its isolationism.

The &quot;General Sherman&quot; purchased stocks of cotton textiles, tinware, mirrors and glassware from Tianjin before sailing up the Taedong River. Korean officials informed the ship&#x27;s captain that he was not allowed to trade in Korea; these instructions were ignored. Eventually, regent Daewongun, believing the &quot;General Sherman&quot; to be a French Navy warship on a punitive mission to avenge the deaths of Catholic priests in Korea, ordered Pyongan Province governor Bak Gyusu to inform the crew that if they did not leave Korean waters they would be executed. 

The crew of the General Sherman then dispatched a dinghy to forage, which took Korean official Yi Hyon-ik hostage. Korean diplomat Bak Gyusu attempted to negotiate for his release, while a crew of civilian onlookers gathered around the &quot;General Sherman&quot;, attacking the merchant ship in anger. The &quot;General Sherman&quot; responded by firing its cannons against the civilians onshore. The Koreans then dispatched troops and an improvised warship to destroy the &quot;General Sherman&quot;, but these efforts were repulsed. Eventually, waves of fire ships set the merchantman on fire.

The crew of the &quot;General Sherman&quot; jumped off the ship and were killed by enraged civilians on the shore. Korean officials did not inform the U.S. government of the incident and evaded inquiries from American officials. Five years later in 1871, the United States dispatched a military expedition to Korea, in part to ascertain the fate of the &quot;General Sherman&quot;. After being ambushed, the expeditionary force captured and occupied several Korean forts after a brief battle. The Korean government eventually ended its isolationism in the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876.

== Background ==
The region of Korea had been under the control of the Joseon dynasty since 1392. During the period of Joseon control, Korea, known in the West as the &quot;Hermit Kingdom&quot;, had adopted several isolationist policies in response to Manchu and Japanese invasions. These policies remained in place during the 19th century, a period which saw the rapid increase in Western imperialism in Asia, including the Opium Wars which led to the opening of Qing China to foreign trade.

Increasing Western influence in Asia saw Christian missionaries travel to the region to proselytize, which led them into conflict with various Asian governments over the tensions caused by the introduction of Christianity. In China, the activities of Western missionaries indirectly led to the Taiping Rebellion, as Christian rebels led by Hong Xiuquan revolted against the Manchu-ruled Qing government. In response to these developments and what Joseon royalty perceived as a subversive religion, regent Heungseon Daewongun initiated a series of persecutions of Korean Christians in 1866 in which 8,000 were killed, including several French missionaries. In response, the French dispatched an unsuccessful expedition to Korea, which reaffirmed Korean isolationism.

Foreign merchants who attempted to travel to Korea for trade were rebuffed by local officials, though the Korean government attempted to maintain friendly relations with Western powers. Meanwhile, the United States was attempting to expand its influence in Asia, and in 1854 forced the Japanese government to open Japan to foreign trade. American merchants hoped that a similar process could lead to the opening of Korea.

== Incident ==
Determined to force the Korean government to end its isolationism, the , an armed merchant schooner owned by Boston businessman W. B. Preston, made plans to travel to Korea. The crew of the &quot;General Sherman&quot; consisted of Captain Page and Chief Mate Wilson (both Americans), English supercargo George Hogarth and thirteen Asian crew-members, which included Chinese sailor and interpreter Chao Ling Feng, two pilots from Shandong and ten sailors from Beijing, Malaya and South China (who were possibly former soldiers in service of Henry Andres Burgevine). Also on board were a money changer from Guangzhou, Welsh missionary Robert Jermain Thomas and Preston.

Prior to travelling to Korea, the ship&#x27;s crew purchased stocks of cotton textiles, tinware, mirrors and glassware from British trading firm Messrs. Meadows and Co. in Tianjin and travelled to Yantai before departing for Korean waters on August 9, 1866. Entering the Taedong River on August 16, the crew made frequent stops for Thomas to hand out Bibles to Korean villagers. Korean officials repeatedly informed Page that the ship was not allowed to trade in Korea, which were ignored by the crew. 

After receiving reports of the &quot;General Sherman&quot; and its voyage, Daewongun believed the merchantman to be a French Navy warship on a punitive mission to avenge the deaths of Catholic priests in Korea. He ordered governor of Pyongan Bak Gyusu to inform the crew that if they did not leave they would be killed. In the meantime, the &quot;General Sherman&quot; ran aground on the river when the tide receded, having misjudged the depth of the river due to a temporary rain swell. On August 27, the crew dispatched a dinghy to forage, which was intercepted by a junk carrying Korean official Yi Hyon-ik, a subordinate of Bak. The crew of the &quot;General Sherman&quot; took the occupants of the junk hostage. Bak attempted to negotiate for their release, with the crew responding by demanding a ransom of rice, gold, silver, and ginseng for the release of the hostages.

A crowd of civilian onlookers, which had gathered near the stranded merchantman, grew so angered by the unfolding situation that they began attacking the &quot;General Sherman&quot; with arrows, stones, and Hwacha rockets. In the ensuing chaos, Korean soldier Park Chong-wun commandeered a dinghy and rescued Yi. In response, the &quot;General Sherman&quot; began bombarding the civilian onlookers with its twelve-pound cannons, killing seven. On September 2, Daewongun dispatched Korean troops equipped with matchlocks with orders to destroy the stranded merchantman. The Koreans initially attempted to destroy the &quot;General Sherman&quot; by constructing an improvised turtle ship, which was protected by metal sheeting and cowhides and equipped with a concealed cannon. However, the turtle ship&#x27;s cannon proved unable to penetrate the armor of the &quot;General Sherman&quot;, and return fire killed a crewmember of the Korean warship.

After the first attack failed, the Koreans then roped together three small boats loaded with firewood, saltpeter, and sulfur, lighting them on fire, and sent them drifting towards the General Sherman. Though the first trio of fire ships missed their target and a second wave bounced off the &quot;General Sherman&quot;, the third wave set the merchantman on fire. The crew and passengers of the &quot;General Sherman&quot; abandoned the ship but were killed by enraged civilian onlookers on the shore. The death of Thomas, which supposedly occurred while attempting to hand a Bible to his killer, was later portrayed as an act of martyrdom. The cannons of the &quot;General Sherman&quot; were salvaged by the Korean government, which celebrated its successful resolution of the incident.

== Aftermath ==
After the incident, the U.S. government remained unaware of the fate of the &quot;General Sherman&quot;, as Korean officials refrained from informing their American counterparts of what had happened. This was in part due to the Korean government believing that the &quot;General Sherman&quot; was a British or French ship, and also over concerns that informing the U.S. government would lead to a punitive expedition or a demand for reparations from the United States. Several U.S. Navy officials conducted investigations in Korea in 1867 and 1868, though Korean officials evaded their questions concerning the &quot;General Sherman&quot;. In the meantime, the French expedition to Korea overshadowed the &quot;General Sherman&quot; incident.

In 1871, the U.S. State Department dispatched Frederick Low, the United States Minister to China alongside the Asiatic Squadron of the U.S. Navy to investigate the disappearance of the &quot;General Sherman&quot; and negotiate a treaty with the Korean government which would open up Korea to foreign trade. The expedition consisted of five ships: frigate , sloops and and gunboats and . The &quot;New York Times&quot; claimed that the expedition would produce a &quot;Detailed Account of the Treacherous Attack of the Coreans on Our Launches&quot; and deliver &quot;Speedy and Effective Punishment of the Barbarians&quot;.

The expedition departed from Nagasaki on 16 May, arriving at Incheon a week later before setting anchor at Ganghwa Island on 28 May. On 30 May and 31, the expedition made contact with Korean officials, who rebuffed American offers to negotiate, noting that their government &quot;was not the least interested in a trade treaty&quot;. Two days later on June 1, the expedition was ambushed by Korean troops as it was sailing up the Han River, with the Americans repulsing the ambushing forces. After failing to receive an apology and receiving confirmation of the fate of the &quot;General Sherman&quot;, the American expedition attacked and occupied a series of Korean forts. Though the U.S. had emerged militarily victorious, the Korean government maintained its isolationist stance, which would only be ended in the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876.

== Legacy ==
The &quot;General Sherman&quot; incident is widely remembered in North Korea as an event demonstrating Korean sovereignty, and is often recalled in North Korean sources as justification of the Kim family&#x27;s legitimacy through a tradition of Korean anti-imperialism. In the North Korean version of events, Kim Ŭngu, ancestor of Kim Il Sung, led an army of volunteers to load firewood onto boats and set the &quot;General Sherman&quot; on fire. It is unknown whether Kim Ŭngu was among the participants, as his name is not mentioned in contemporary Joseon sources.

<doc id="905758" wikidata="Q3007350" url="?curid=905758" title="Culture of Lebanon">
<text>The culture of Lebanon and the Lebanese people emerged from Phoenicia and through various civilizations over thousands of years. It was home to the Phoenicians and was subsequently conquered and occupied by the Assyrians, the Greeks, the Romans, the Persians, the Arabs, the Crusaders, the Ottomans and the French. This variety is reflected in Lebanon&#x27;s diverse population, composed of different religious groups, and features in the country&#x27;s festivals, literature, artifacts, cuisine and architecture of Lebanon. Regardless of religion or colonization which were layers of paint on top. 

The Maronite, Muslim and the Druze founded modern Lebanon in the early eighteenth century, through the ruling and social system known as the &quot;Maronite-Druze dualism&quot; in Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifite. Despite the religious and denominational diversity of the Lebanese, they &quot;share an almost common culture&quot;. Article 11 of the Constitution of Lebanon states: &quot;Arabic is the official national language. A law determines the cases in which the French language is to be used&quot;. The spoken Lebanese Arabic dialect used in public mixes Arabic with French. Cuisine and literature are deep-rooted &quot;in wider Mediterranean and Levantine norms&quot;.

The hilly Mediterranean geography of Lebanon has played a role in shaping the history of Lebanon and its culture. Archaeology of Lebanon is conducted to explore the region&#x27;s past.

==Arts==
By the turn of the 20th century, Beirut was vying with Cairo to be the major centre for Near Eastern and Middle Eastern thought, with many newspapers, magazines and literary societies. Additionally, Beirut became a thriving epicenter of Armenian culture with varied productions that was exported to the Armenian diaspora.

===Visual arts===
Daoud Corm (1852-1930), Habib Serour (1860-1938) and Khalil Saleeby (1870-1928) are considered the first successful professional studio artists in Lebanon, with careers extending to Europe. All were trained outside Lebanon, with Corm and Serour attending Roman academies and Saleeby British and American ones. They were known for portraiture of Lebanese high society and men of religion, as well as Christian sacred art in the case of Corm and Serour.

Mustafa Farroukh (1901-1957) was one of Lebanon&#x27;s most important painters between the 1920s and the 1950s. Formally trained in Rome and Paris, he exhibited in venues from Paris to New York to Beirut over his career.

Farid Mansour (1929-2010) was a Lebanese multi-talented painter and sculptor . Being trained in Italy and England, Mansour mastered several painting and sculpting techniques. His works were exhibited in London, Paris, New York as well as Lebanon and Syria.

===Contemporary art===
Contemporary art started in Beirut immediately after the end of the civil war (1975-1991).

Many contemporary artists are currently active, such as Walid Raad, a contemporary media artist currently residing in New York.

Two contemporary art exhibition centers, the Beirut Art Center and the Beirut Exhibition Center (does not exist anymore) in the BIEL area reflect the vibrant Lebanese contemporary art scene. These two centers are intended to host exhibitions and are a must in the world of international as well as local contemporary art. Many art galleries also add to the local art scene, exhibiting the works of artists such as Ayman Baalbaki, Akram Zaatari, Marwan Sahmarani, Nadim Asfar, Lamia Joreige, Jean Marc Nahas, Ricardo Mbarkho, Mansour El-Habre, Anita Toutikian and many others. These galleries are run by gallerists such as Saleh Barakat, Fadi Mogabgab, Nadine Begdache (Galerie Janine Rubeiz), Odile Mazloum (Galerie Alwane).

Located in Foch Street in the Solidere area, FFA Private Bank is home to many temporary exhibitions of contemporary local artists as well as to a permanent display of paintings by Lebanese artists (Sahmarani, Baalbaki, Hanibal Srouji ... ) or foreign artists such as Fabienne Arietti&#x27;s &quot;Nasdaq&quot;. A Jean Dubuffet&#x27;s huge sculpture can also be seen when visiting the atrium of Bank Audi Plaza, located in a beautiful contemporary building designed by Kevin Dash. By Strolling through the streets of the city one can find some interesting works such as sculptures of Michel Basbous in the Bank of Lebanon street.

Ashkal Alwan, the Lebanese association for plastic arts and a platform for the creation and exchange of artistic practices. It was founded by Christine Tohmé, Marwan Rechmaoui, Rania Tabbara, Mustapha Yamout and Leila Mroueh. Initially, Ashkal Alwan promoted and introduced the work of artists who have been engaged in critical art practices within the context of post-war Lebanon. The Home Works Forum is a multidisciplinary platform that takes place in Beirut, Lebanon about every other year. it has evolved into one of the most vibrant platforms for research and exchange on cultural practices in the region and beyond.

Umam Documentation &amp; Research runs an exhibition space (The Hangar) located at Haret Hreik, in Beirut&#x27;s Southern suburb with extensive events.

In the field of digital art, the artist Ricardo Mbarkho investigates the transformation of cultural industries into creative industries.

In the field of photography, the Arab Image Foundation has a collection of +4000 photographs from Lebanon and the Middle East. The photographs can be viewed in a research center and various events and publications have been produced in Lebanon and worldwide to promote the foundation.

===Architecture===


Architecture in Lebanon includes the legacies of various occupying powers including the Romans, Phoenicians, Ottomans and French, as well as post independence developments.

When the Ottomans exiled Fakhreddine to Tuscany, Italy in 1613, he entered an alliance with the Medicis. Upon his return to Lebanon in 1618, he began modernizing Lebanon. He developed a silk industry, upgraded olive-oil production, and brought with him numerous Italian engineers who began the construction of mansions and civil building throughout the country. The cities of Beirut and Sidon were especially built in the Italianate style.

The Italianate, specifically, Tuscan, influence on architecture in Lebanon dates back to the Renaissance when Fakhreddine, the first Lebanese ruler who truly unified Mount Lebanon with its Mediterranean coast executed an ambitious plan to develop his country.

The influence of these buildings, such as the ones in Deir el Qamar, influenced building in Lebanon for many centuries and continues to the present time. For example, streets like Rue Gouraud continues to have numerous, historic houses with Italianate influence. Buildings like the Nicolas Sursock mansion on Rue Sursock, which is today a major museum, attest to the continuous influence of Italianate architecture in Lebanon.

===Literature===

Khalil Gibran (1883–1931), who was born in Bsharri, is particularly known for his book &quot;The Prophet&quot; (1923), which has been translated into more than twenty different languages. Several contemporary Lebanese writers have also achieved international success; including Elias Khoury, Amin Maalouf, Hanan al-Shaykh, and Georges Schehadé.

Several contemporary Lebanese writers have also achieved international success; including Elias Khoury, Amin Maalouf, Hanan al-Shaykh, and Georges Schehadé. Raméz A. Baassiri, a contemporary writer of Lebanese origin, authored a book on Entrepreneurship titled &quot;Interrupted Entrepreneurship: Embracing Change in the Family Business&quot; on family business cycles. The book published with ForbesBooks, was voted the 88th best book of all time by Book Authority.

===Poetry===
There are many well known Lebanese poets that marked the history of poetry. For example, there is Gibran Khalil Gibran who wrote &quot;Love&quot; in 1920, &quot;On Friendship&quot; in 1923 and many more.

==Popular culture==

===Music===
Music is famous in Lebanese society. While traditional folk music remains popular in Lebanon, modern music reconciling traditional styles, pop, and fusion are rapidly advancing in popularity. Radio stations feature a variety of genres and languages, including traditional, classical Arabic and Armenian Prominent traditional musicians include Fairuz, an icon during the civil war, Sabah Melhem Barakat, Wadih El Safi, Majida El Roumi, and Najwa Karam who built an international audience for the genre. Marcel Khalife, a musician who blends classical Arab music with modern sounds, boasts immense popularity for his politically charged lyrics. Distinguished pop artists include Nancy Ajram, Haifa Wehbe, Fadl Shaker, Elissa, and Mika.

According to the World Intellectual Property Organization, Lebanon&#x27;s music industry is growing and could attain leading status in the region. Lebanese performers are celebrated throughout the Arab World, and with the notable exception of Egypt enjoy increasing regional popularity. Rising demand for Arabic music outside Western Asia has provided Lebanese artists with a small but significant global audience. However, widespread piracy continues to inhibit the music industry&#x27;s growth.

===Media===

Lebanon is not only a regional center of media production but also the most liberal and free in the Arab world. According to Press freedom&#x27;s Reporters Without Borders, &quot;the media have more freedom in Lebanon than in any other Arab country&quot;. Despite its small population and geographic size, Lebanon plays an influential role in the production of information in the Arab world and is &quot;at the core of a regional media network with global implications&quot;.

After independence, Beirut emerged as the epicenter of publishing in the Arab world, characterized by free and liberal media and literary scenes. Lebanon&#x27;s press became a huge industry despite the country&#x27;s small size and has remained a haven for Arabic publishing. The establishment of modern printing presses and sophisticated book distribution channels made Beirut a regional publishing leader, and gave the Lebanese publishers a dominant role in Arab publishing. Lebanon hosts annually two important regional publishing events, the Beirut Book Fair and the Beirut Francophone Book Fair.

Television in Lebanon was introduced in 1959, with the launch of two privately owned stations, CLT and Télé Orient that merged in 1967 into Télé Liban. Lebanon has ten national television channels, with most being affiliated or supported by certain political parties or alliances.

Lebanon was one of the first countries in the Arabic-speaking world to introduce internet. Beirut&#x27;s newspapers were the first in the region to provide readers with web versions of their newspapers. By 1986, three newspapers from Lebanon were online, &quot;Al Anwar&quot;, &quot;Annahar&quot;, and &quot;Assafir&quot;, and by 2000, more than 200 websites provided news out of Lebanon.

===Cinema===

Cinema of Lebanon, according to film critic and historian, Roy Armes, was the only other cinema in the Arabic-speaking region, beside Egypt&#x27;s, that could amount to a national cinema. Cinema in Lebanon has been in existence since the 1920s, and the country has produced over 500 films, some of which are:

===Theatre ===

Lebanese theatre has its origin in passion plays. The musical plays of Maroun Naccache from the mid-1800s are considered the birth of modern Arab theatre. Some scholars like Abdulatif Shararah divided theatre in Lebanon into three phases: translations of European plays, Arab nationalism, and realism.

=== Cultural relations between Lebanon and Egypt ===

The cultural and historical relations between Lebanon and Egypt are considered to be unique, because there is a considerable overlap between the Lebanese and Egyptian cultures, especially in the fields of literature, theater, cinema and journalism. All of them played an integral role towards each other especially in theater, cinema and journalism, that&#x27;s what was confirmed by the Conference Egypt in the eyes of the Lebanese and which is Within the activities of the cultural program Egypt in the eyes of the World . Which is held at the headquarters of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism, and in the presence of the Lebanese Ambassador in Egypt, Madeleine Tabar and Ahmed Ghanem founder of cultural program Egypt in the eyes of the World and an elite of Lebanese artists.

Today, almost all Lebanese wear modern clothing.

Muslim holidays are followed based on the Islamic lunar calendar. Muslim holidays that are celebrated include Eid al-Fitr (the three-day feast at the end of the Ramadan month), Eid al-Adha (The Feast of the Sacrifice) which is celebrated during the annual pilgrimage to Mecca and also celebrates Abraham&#x27;s willingness to sacrifice his son to God, Mawlid (the Birthday of Muhammad), and Ashura. Lebanon&#x27;s National Holidays include Workers Day, Independence day, and Martyrs Day.

The Lebanese national dishes are the kibbe, a meat pie made from finely minced lamb and burghul (cracked wheat), and the tabbouleh, a salad made from parsley, tomatoes, and burghul. The national beverage is arak, a strong anise-flavored liquor made from fermented grape juice. It is usually drunk with water and ice, which turns the clear liquid milky-white, and usually accompanies food. Arak is a strong spirit similar to the Greek ouzo and the Turkish raki.
M&#x27;Juhdara, a thick stew of onions, rice, and lentils, is sometimes eaten around Lent by people in the Lebanese diaspora.

==Society==
Lebanese society is similar to certain cultures of the Mediterranean as the country is uniquely diverse religiously . It is often considered as a gateway to Western Asia, Levant and the Arab World.

Notwithstanding the persistence of traditional attitudes regarding the role of women, Lebanese women enjoy equal civil rights and attend institutions of higher education in large numbers (for example, women constituted 41 percent of the student body at the American University of Beirut in 1983). Although women in Lebanon have their own organizations, most exist as subordinate branches of the political parties.

<doc id="905767" wikidata="Q797992" url="?curid=905767" title="Babyshambles">
<text>Babyshambles were an English rock band established in London. The band was formed by Pete Doherty (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) during a hiatus from the Libertines. As of 2024 the band included Mick Whitnall (lead guitar), Drew McConnell (bass guitar, backing vocals), Patrick Walden (lead guitar) and Adam Ficek (drums, percussion). Babyshambles have released three albums—&quot;Down in Albion&quot; (2005), &quot;Shotter&#x27;s Nation&quot; (2007) and &quot;Sequel to the Prequel&quot; (2013)—three EPs and a number of singles.

==History==

=== Early history and touring (2003–2005)===
In mid-2003, Pete Doherty was banned from playing with the Libertines until he could overcome his substance abuse problems. As a response, Doherty formed an alternative band, and recruited former Libertine Steve Bedlow as vocalist. Initially, Doherty planned on calling his new band T&#x27;Libertines, because of the band&#x27;s Yorkshire connection – the line-up of the band at the time consisted mainly of Yorkshiremen.
On the night Babyshambles&#x27; first gig was scheduled to take place, Doherty was arrested for burgling Carl Barât&#x27;s flat. After he was charged and released, his friend Dean Fragile organized a new gig at the Tap&#x27;n&#x27;Tin. The performance received mixed reviews.

Doherty was sentenced to six months&#x27; imprisonment for his crime. His sentence was later reduced on appeal to two months. When he was released from prison, Doherty rejoined The Libertines and sidelined the Babyshambles project. However, he found time to record the band&#x27;s first single, &quot;Babyshambles&quot;, which was released in April 2004 on High Society Records. The artwork was by Sophie Thunder. The single was limited to 2000 CDs and 1000 7&quot; vinyl copies.

In the early summer of 2004, Doherty once again found himself cast out of The Libertines because of his drug use. As a result, Doherty brought Babyshambles to the fore with Patrick Walden on guitar, Gemma Clarke on drums and Peter Perrett&#x27;s two sons, Jamie and Peter Junior, on guitar and bass respectively. Doherty organised several gigs and the band began to gain respect in their own right, even though Doherty missed a number of appearances. The band&#x27;s lineup underwent several changes before stabilizing during the late summer of 2004 with Doherty on vocals, Patrick Walden on guitar, Gemma Clarke on drums and Drew McConnell on bass.

In September and October 2004, Babyshambles embarked on a British tour that culminated with two shows at the London Scala. Despite fears that Doherty&#x27;s performance would not be consistent, the tour sold out and received critical acclaim. The band&#x27;s second single, &quot;Killamangiro&quot;, was released 29 November 2004 on Rough Trade Records, reaching number 8 on the UK singles chart. The band embarked on another tour in December 2004, among growing concerns regarding Doherty&#x27;s drug dependence. During a gig in Blackpool, the band walked off the stage when it became clear that Doherty was too intoxicated to perform, and a riot broke out at the London Astoria after Doherty failed to appear, with 150–200 of the audience invading the stage and damaging the band&#x27;s equipment, including the destruction of Gemma Clarke&#x27;s drumkit, an incident that cast doubt over her desire to continue in the band.

After finally stabilizing in late summer, Babyshambles&#x27; lineup underwent another change in January 2005. On 27 January 2005, drummer Gemma Clarke quit the band after disagreeing with their management. The ongoing heavy drug abuse of the band members, especially of frontman Doherty, and James Mullord&#x27;s inability to do something about it, made her eventually leave the band. She was immediately replaced by Adam Ficek, who was once a band member of the White Sport alongside Patrick Walden.

===&quot;Down in Albion&quot; (2005–2007)===
In April and May 2005, Babyshambles spent several weeks in a recording studio in Wales working on their debut album with Mick Jones of the Clash, who had also worked with Doherty on the production of the Libertines&#x27; albums. The album, entitled &quot;Down in Albion&quot;, was released on 14 November 2005. It reached the Top 10 on the UK Albums Chart. The first single from the album, &quot;Fuck Forever&quot;, had been released on 15 August, reaching number four on the UK Singles Chart. The second single, &quot;Albion&quot;, was released on 28 November and reached number eight in the UK singles chart.

Fellow English rock group Oasis had booked Babyshambles to support them on their UK tour in July 2005. However, Doherty was attending the birthday celebration of fashion designer Hedi Slimane with Kate Moss and was unable to arrange transport back to the UK in time for the band&#x27;s first appearance. As a consequence Oasis cancelled Babyshambles&#x27; support for the rest of the tour.

In September &amp; October of 2005, Babyshambles toured the UK on the 19-date Pipe Down tour supported by The Paddingtons, The Cazals, General Khaki, Littl&#x27;ans and Alan Wass. Several more small gigs took place toward the end of 2005.

Babyshambles announced four small club shows in London, Liverpool, Sheffield and Stoke in January 2006. To the surprise of his fans, the band performed without guitarist Patrick Walden, with Doherty on guitar instead. Walden returned for a gig in Cambridge on 23 January and a UK tour in February. He played his last gig with the band at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire during that tour, and has not appeared with Babyshambles since. He has, however, appeared on stage independently and in the company of Drew McConnell and Seb Rochford, playing two Babyshambles songs which he co-wrote with Pete Doherty, in July 2007.

In February 2006, Babyshambles won the Naomi Award for Worst Live Act, and were nominated for several NME awards. The band performed &quot;Albion&quot; at the NME Awards show, and Doherty won the &quot;Sexiest Man&quot; award.

In August 2006, Babyshambles signed to major record label Parlophone for the release of an EP, and headlined the Get Loaded in the Park festival. The band released the limited edition single &quot;Beg, Steal or Borrow&quot;, which was exclusively available to those who had attended the festival. A free copy of &quot;The Blinding&quot; was released in the street magazine &quot;The Big Issue&quot;.

A cover version of the Clash song &quot;Janie Jones&quot; was released through B-Unique Records in October. The single was released to raise money for Joe Strummer&#x27;s charity foundation Strummerville and features contributions from others bands such as Dirty Pretty Things, Larrikin Love, We Are Scientists, the Kooks, and Guillemots. This release marked the first time that Carl Barât and Pete Doherty had worked together since the Libertines parted, although they never met during the recording process.

On 4 December 2006, &quot;The Blinding EP&quot; was released to critical acclaim. The release was promoted with music videos for &quot;The Blinding&quot; and &quot;Love You But You&#x27;re Green&quot;, and an acoustic performance of the latter on &quot;The Culture Show&quot;. The single was not eligible for the singles chart because it contained too many tracks; however, the band claimed on its MySpace page that it would have made number four in the Christmas Day 2006 UK chart had it been eligible.

On 18 January 2007, it was announced that the band had signed a long-term record deal with Parlophone. The contract was reportedly for three albums. In Summer 2007, Babyshambles played Oxegen, Glastonbury Festival, the V Festival, T in the Park and Paredes de Coura Festival.

===&quot;Shotter&#x27;s Nation&quot; (2007–2010)===
On 1 October 2007 Babyshambles released their second album, &quot;Shotter&#x27;s Nation&quot;. The track listing for the album was revealed on 23 July 2007 in the (p)review posted on Allan Jones&#x27; Editor&#x27;s Diary Uncut.co.uk blog. The Stephen Street–produced record contains 12 tracks and features a guest appearance from Bert Jansch on the acoustic closer. 
Adam Ficek commented that &quot;Shotter&#x27;s Nation&quot; is a &quot;glossy picture&quot; of where the band are at the moment.

The first single from the album, &quot;Delivery&quot;, was released on 17 September 2007, reaching number six in the UK Singles Chart after its first week on general sale. A week prior to the release, a 7-inch vinyl containing a demo version of the song and an interview with the band was released with &quot;NME&quot; magazine.

In November 2007 Babyshambles played their first arena tour, taking in dates at the Newcastle Metro Radio Arena, MEN Arena in Manchester, the Nottingham Arena, Bournemouth International Centre, London&#x27;s Wembley Arena, Brighton&#x27;s Brighton Centre, and Birmingham&#x27;s National Indoor Arena.

The second single from &quot;Shotter&#x27;s Nation&quot;, &quot;You Talk&quot;, was released on 3 December 2007.

In January and February 2008, Babyshambles played their biggest European tour to date. 
Babyshambles were due to play at a lot of festivals that spring and summer, especially in France.
In June they played at Hove Festival in Norway. In August they headlined the RadioOne/NME Stage of the Reading and Leeds Festivals. However, a large amount of their scheduled tour was cancelled due to Doherty&#x27;s recent imprisonment.
On 8 April, it was announced that Babyshambles was going to release a live CD/DVD entitled &quot;Oh! What A Lovely Tour&quot; on 2 June. The concert was recorded during the winter leg of the UK arena tour at the SECC Glasgow on 2 December. On 22 May 2008 Babyshambles performed at the Saturday Night Fiber, a new music festival in Madrid, Spain with other artists such as Morrissey.
Growing speculation suggested that Babyshambles would be unable to make all tour dates for 2008, but in an interview with &quot;NME&quot; &quot;Doherty added that he will honour all his booked live commitments with Babyshambles, but will not book further gigs until his solo album is finished&quot;. On 12 January 2009, along with Roger Daltrey, Babyshambles played a one-off gig at the O2 Academy Bristol in aid of Teenage Cancer Trust.

===&quot;Sequel to the Prequel&quot; (2010–2014)===
In June 2010 drummer Adam Ficek split with the band to focus on his solo outfit Roses Kings Castles, with former Supergrass drummer Danny Goffey temporarily taking his place. In early 2013, &quot;NME&quot; announced that Babyshambles were working on a third album, with Stereophonics drummer Jamie Morrison replacing Adam Ficek in the line-up. Stephen Street denied this speculation, but bassist Drew McConnell is said to have broken the news to the music magazine. On 29 April 2013, Babyshambles announced a UK tour for the months of September and October of the same year, kicking off on 4 September at Glasgow&#x27;s Barrowlands. The new album, titled &quot;Sequel to the Prequel&quot;, was released on 2 September 2013, following Babyshambles&#x27; scheduled Australian shows in late July. The album charted at number 10 in the UK. Although Doherty&#x27;s band the Libertines re-formed in 2014, Babyshambles continued to perform sporadic shows and festivals until 2014, most notably Rock am Ring, Rock Werchter, and Best Kept Secret Festival.

<doc id="905775" wikidata="Q61428" url="?curid=905775" title="Conny Plank">
<text>Konrad &quot;Conny&quot; Plank (3 May 1940 – 5 December 1987) was a German record producer and musician. He is known for his innovative work as a sound engineer and producer in Germany&#x27;s krautrock and kosmische music scene in the 1970s. Plank was involved in releases by Neu!, Kraftwerk, Cluster, Harmonia, Ash Ra Tempel, Guru Guru, Kraan, and other German groups of the era. He later produced for new wave acts such as D.A.F., Eurythmics and Ultravox. As a billed performer, Plank also formed the group Moebius &amp; Plank, releasing 5 albums between 1979 and 1986.

==Career==
===1960s===
In mid-to-late 60s, Conny attended new-music courses at the Rheinische Musikschule in Cologne, taught by Karlheinz Stockhausen, Luciano Berio, Henri Pousseur, and Earle Brown.

Plank began producing albums and working as a sound engineer in the late 1960s and became involved in the underground music scene which was spreading outwards through Germany from Berlin. In 1969 he served as engineer for the first Kluster album, &quot;Klopfzeichen&quot;, which was released the following year. His long association with Dieter Moebius and Hans-Joachim Roedelius of Kluster and later Cluster endured until his death. He also served as engineer for Alexander von Schlippenbach&#x27;s album &quot;The Living Music&quot;, which was released in 1969, the first of a long list of engineering and production credits.

===1970s===
In 1970 he had a 56 channel mixing desk hand built by himself, Peter Lang and Michael Zähl. and went on to produce and/or engineered many recordings by significant German progressive/experimental music acts often referred to as krautrock internationally, including Kraftwerk, Organisation, Neu!, Cluster, Harmonia, Night Sun, Holger Czukay and Guru Guru.

In 1977, through Brian Eno, Plank recruited Dave Hutchins from Island Studios, as house engineer. Hutchins undertook recording and mixing roles on many of the productions originating from the studios in the following ten years.

As a musician, Plank played guitar and keyboards on three Guru Guru albums: &quot;Kang Guru&quot;, &quot;Guru Guru&quot;, and &quot;Mani und Seine Freunde&quot;, the Os Mundi album &quot;43 Minuten&quot;, and Cluster&#x27;s self-titled debut album. In 1978 and 1979 he added guitar and percussion to two Roedelius solo albums, &quot;Durch Die Wüste&quot; and &quot;Selbstportrait&quot;. He was a member of the short lived band Liliental, contributing guitar, keyboards, and vocals. In 1979 he went into the studio with Dieter Moebius to record the first Moebius &amp; Plank album, &quot;Rastakraut Pasta&quot; which was released the following year.

===1980s===
Plank continued to work as one half of the duo Moebius &amp; Plank, recording four additional albums. Their second album, &quot;Material&quot;, was released in 1981. Their third album, the African-influenced &quot;Zero Set&quot;, with Guru Guru drummer Mani Neumeier, was released in 1983. These two albums are early examples of the predecessors of techno and electronica. In 1983, Moebius &amp; Plank also recorded the album &quot;Ludwig&#x27;s Law&quot; using an Emulator, an early form of sampling keyboard that enabled them to duplicate other instruments without having musicians to play them. Mayo Thompson of Red Krayola contributed vocals, mainly spoken monologues. The project was rejected by Sky Records and was not released until 1998. The final Moebius &amp; Plank collaboration, &quot;En Route&quot; was recorded in Conny&#x27;s Studio in 1986 but left incomplete as Plank&#x27;s health deteriorated. It was completed and mixed in 1995, primarily by Dieter Moebius, and released that year.

During the eighties, Plank remained in high demand with the new generation of electronic pop and new wave artists, including Devo, the Meteors from the Netherlands (&quot;Hunger&quot; in 1980 and &quot;Stormy Seas&quot; in 1981), Hunters &amp; Collectors from Australia ( &quot;The Fireman&#x27;s Curse&quot; in 1983 and &quot;The Jaws of Life&quot; in 1984) the Fred Banana Combo, Ultravox (&quot;Systems of Romance&quot;, &quot;Vienna&quot; and &quot;Rage in Eden&quot;), Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, Freur, Killing Joke, the Tourists (&quot;Luminous Basement&quot;) and Eurythmics (&quot;In the Garden&quot;). He also worked on pop and rock productions with artists such as Scorpions, Clannad, Play Dead, and Gianna Nannini (&quot;Latin Lover&quot;, &quot;Sogno Di Una Notte d&#x27;Estate&quot;, &quot;Tutto Live&quot; and others, also credited for music).

Plank&#x27;s other production credits include Liaisons Dangereuses, Phew, Einstürzende Neubauten, Ástor Piazzolla, Psychotic Tanks, DAF (including the classic single &quot;Der Mussolini&quot;), Les Rita Mitsouko, and Nina Hagen.

According to René Tinner and Stephan Plank in a radio documentary about the life of Conny Plank, it was Brian Eno&#x27;s idea that Plank should produce the U2 album &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; instead of him. After being introduced to the band by Eno and after a short meeting, Plank turned down the job (&quot;I cannot work with this singer&quot;). According to the companion website of the documentary film &quot;Conny Plank – The Potential of Noise&quot; (but not the film itself), after the meeting, Plank firstly asked for time for a second thought. In the meantime he attended a U2 concert at Freilichtbühne Loreley, where U2&#x27;s Bono introduced Plank to the audience as their new producer, after which Plank is said to have left the concert and never communicated further with any member of U2.

==Death==
Plank became sick while touring South America with Dieter Moebius, Arno Steffen and Detlef Wiederhoeft performing music from &quot;Ludwig&#x27;s Law&quot;. Some of Plank&#x27;s last work, before his death in 1987 from laryngeal cancer in Cologne, was the recording of concerts on Eurythmics&#x27; &quot;Revenge&quot; tour, and samples used on the NED Synclavier on their &quot;Savage&quot; album.

Plank&#x27;s studio established at his home on the southern outskirts of Cologne continued to be run by his widow Christa Fast and their son until her failing health and the general change in the music business forced them to offer its contents for sale in May 2006. Fast died on 1 June 2006. Conny&#x27;s hand-built mixing desk was bought by English producers David M. Allen and Mark Ralph and transported to England. The desk was originally designed and built by Plank in 1970, altered and frequently upgraded until his death in 1987. The 56 channel desk was a custom design and has a number of unique features, including a specially designed equalization (EQ) section that conformed to Plank&#x27;s own preferred EQ settings, as well as a section that could be removed and fitted into a converted military van adapted for remote recording. It is also reputedly laminated in wood taken from a single cherry tree from Plank&#x27;s own garden.

The mixing desk was initially installed at Club Ralf, the private studio of producer Mark Ralph, where he used it to record and mix a range of work including all or parts of &quot;In Our Heads&quot; and &quot;Why Make Sense&quot; by Hot Chip, &quot;Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action&quot; by Franz Ferdinand and &quot;Communion&quot; by Years &amp; Years. It is currently in North London at Studio 7, the private studio of songwriter and producer Laurence Loveless.

==Style and influence==
Plank and the bands he worked with in West Germany had a strong influence on mainstream rock artists, some of whom were able to popularize aspects of his production technique and his distinctive approach. In the 1980s, electronic pop bands were able to realize his ideas in performance as computerized electronic instruments became readily available.

Plank, who began his career as soundman for Marlene Dietrich, was an ardent believer in the possibilities of electronic music and electronic soundscapes. He was also known for blending them with conventional sounds, or natural sounds given unconventional treatments, such as using large metal containers and other industrial objects as percussion instruments.

Plank used multi-track recording facilities. He favored sometimes harsh-sounding effects and contrasting audio for each element in the mix. Plank used combinations of echo, reverberation and other electronic, mixing, editing and tape-based effects to create mixes.

Plank favoured a &#x27;live&#x27; production sound, especially on drums. On a recording session in Hamburg in 1970 with Hartmut Kulka from the German Blue Flames &amp; Philip Cantlay of Casey Jones &amp; the Governors/Gaslight Union, together known as Kulka &amp; Cantlay, he set up and recorded conga drums with specially inserted microphones to provide an unusual percussion sound.

== Recordings ==
Plank was involved with the following chronological list of albums, either as a direct contributor or because his studio facilities were used. The dates refer to the year of first release.
==Documentary==
* &quot;Conny Plank – The Potential of Noise&quot;, a 92 minute documentary film directed by Reto Caduff and Plank&#x27;s son Stephan Plank, was released in September 2017.

<text>Queen Street is the major commercial thoroughfare in the Auckland CBD, Auckland, New Zealand&#x27;s largest city. The northern end is at Queens Wharf on the Auckland waterfront, adjacent to the Britomart Transport Centre and the Downtown Ferry Terminal. The road is close to straight, the southern end being almost three kilometres away in a south-southwesterly direction on the Karangahape Road ridge, close to the residential suburbs in the interior of the Auckland isthmus.

==Geography==
Named after Queen Victoria, Queen Street was an early development of the new town of Auckland (founded in 1840), although initially the main street was intended to be Shortland Street, running parallel to the shore of Commercial Bay. The early route of Queen Street led up the middle of a gully following the bank of the Waihorotiu Stream (later bounded in as the &#x27;Ligar Canal&#x27;). This canal was culverted beneath the street from the 1870s onward, allowing for further development of the street to be undertaken. The course of the stream is still reflected today in the slight bend of lower Queen Street. From north of Shortland Street, Queen Street is built on land reclaimed from the sea in the late 19th century (see Auckland waterfront article).

There are several other &#x27;Queen Streets&#x27; in the greater Auckland area, mostly in suburbs that were separate towns before being absorbed by a growing central city. Auckland was also called the &quot;Queen City&quot; since before the turn of the 20th century, though that term is now overshadowed by the nickname &quot;City of Sails&quot;.

==Demographics==
The statistical areas of Queen Street, which encompasses a full block either side of Queen Street north of Wellesley Street, and Queen Street South West, which includes the area west of Queen Street to Vincent Street and Pitt Street south of Wellesley Street, cover and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Queen Street had a population of 3,621 in the 2023 New Zealand census, a decrease of 186 people (−4.9%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 453 people (14.3%) since the 2013 census. There were 1,827 males, 1,725 females and 63 people of other genders in 2,199 dwellings. 13.3% of people identified as LGBTIQ+. There were 135 people (3.7%) aged under 15 years, 1,467 (40.5%) aged 15 to 29, 1,743 (48.1%) aged 30 to 64, and 276 (7.6%) aged 65 or older.

People could identify as more than one ethnicity. The results were 42.8% European (Pākehā); 8.4% Māori; 4.8% Pasifika; 44.6% Asian; 7.6% Middle Eastern, Latin American and African New Zealanders (MELAA); and 1.8% other, which includes people giving their ethnicity as &quot;New Zealander&quot;. English was spoken by 94.8%, Māori language by 2.2%, Samoan by 1.0%, and other languages by 44.7%. No language could be spoken by 1.0% (e.g. too young to talk). New Zealand Sign Language was known by 0.3%. The percentage of people born overseas was 64.3, compared with 28.8% nationally.

Religious affiliations were 23.9% Christian, 6.9% Hindu, 3.0% Islam, 0.7% Māori religious beliefs, 2.9% Buddhist, 0.7% New Age, 0.2% Jewish, and 2.4% other religions. People who answered that they had no religion were 53.6%, and 6.0% of people did not answer the census question.

Of those at least 15 years old, 1,590 (45.6%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, 1,131 (32.4%) had a post-high school certificate or diploma, and 774 (22.2%) people exclusively held high school qualifications. 471 people (13.5%) earned over $100,000 compared to 12.1% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 1,914 (54.9%) people were employed full-time, 471 (13.5%) were part-time, and 180 (5.2%) were unemployed.

==History==

=== Street, stream and canal ===
The valley in which Queen Street is situated was formed by Te Wai Horotiu (The water of Horotiu) or Waihorotiu Stream. Māori lived along the stream and used it as a food source and for other purposes. It ran from the ridge along Karagahape Road towards the sea. Horotiu is the name of a taniwha (guardian spirit) which was believed to live in the stream. In 1841 colonial settlers built a number of wooden buildings along the western side, following the general path of the Waihorotiu Stream according to the plans set out by surveyor Felton Mathew. While the street was metalled in 1843, the natural stream still often overflowed its banks, and the area was still swampy. This led to canalisation and later covering-over of the stream. 

===Mainstreet of Auckland===
After a fire in 1858 destroyed around 50 buildings in High Street and Shortland Street, the commercial district began to shift towards Queen Street instead, and the first brick and plaster buildings of the 1860s started to cement this move, with the Bank of New Zealand building (only the façade extant today) being one of the first examples. Fires however still continued to plague the new town, with one in 1873 wiping out another 54 buildings in the Queen Street area between Wellesley Street West and Grey Street (today Greys Avenue). The fires, amongst other things, led to the establishment of the Auckland Volunteer Fire Service.

In the 1880s, the first horse-drawn buses began connecting Queen Street with areas such as Ponsonby Road and Remuera. In 1900, the first motorcar was admired on the street, and in 1902 the street was finally asphalted, the first street in New Zealand. The same year the first electric trams also arrived, to provide services until 1956.

The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a large number of imposing buildings constructed, such as the Smith &amp; Caughey&#x27;s building, the Auckland Town Hall and the General Post Office at the waterfront, later to become the Britomart Transport Centre. By that time, the street was popular for events such as parades and festivities, as well as for political activities such as the strike demonstrations of 1913. Queen Street riots occurred after a 1932 unemployment march and broke out again in the adjacent Aotea Square in late 1984. During the second half of the 20th century, many of the older buildings on Queen Street were demolished to make space for larger office buildings.

==Character==
Queen Street gives its name to the most expensive square in the New Zealand version of &quot;Monopoly&quot; and to describe business people with rural investment interests (but lacking farming expertise): &#x27;Queen Street farmers&#x27;. The street was immortalised by The Front Lawn with their song &quot;(It started on) Queen Street&quot;.

The street has been the site of numerous parades, marches and other events of political, cultural or sporting nature. Together with adjacent High Street, it is the main retail precinct of the central city, with most national store, bank and restaurant franchises having a branch on the street. Several important other local businesses, such as the Smith &amp; Caughey&#x27;s department store, have flagship branches here.

The street sees very high pedestrian numbers, estimated by some as up to 10 times as high as on Broadway in Newmarket, seen as Queen Street&#x27;s closest shopping street rival in Auckland.

==Transport and foot traffic==
Prior to a 2006–2008 street upgrade (see below), Council figures showed that over 50,000 pedestrians, 40,000 public transport users and 20,000 people in private vehicles used Queen Street daily. The Council anticipated that the private car share would drop by around 15%. An editorial of &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; accused Council of using overestimated public transport user numbers for political purposes to support its bus lane plans.

===Former tram network===
Until December 1956, trams provided public transport along Queen Street, and it was the only street in New Zealand with grand unions, double-track to double-track junctions, where trams could go to all directions from all directions. These junctions were at the intersections with Customs Street and Wellesley Street. Since the closure of Auckland&#x27;s tram network, Balaclava Junction on Melbourne&#x27;s tram network has been the sole grand union left in the Southern Hemisphere.

==2006–2008 upgrade==
Public perception in the early 2000s was that Queen Street had lost some of its good reputation in the previous decades, with a rundown and uncoordinated streetscape and the loss of several prestigious retailers cited as either causes or effects. Auckland City Council decided to address the issue of the &#x27;tired&#x27; Queen Street through a major redevelopment of the street.

This involved the widening and relaying of footpaths with basalt kerbstones and paving. Granite insets, designed in consultation with the local Māori (Ngati Whatua iwi), as well as recycled redchip pavers from the existing footpath, were used to denote special areas – such as those related to the existence of the old Waihorotiu Stream. New street furniture (such as multi-purpose poles for lighting, signage and pennants) and new trees and other landscaping were added to create a &#x27;boulevard effect&#x27;. The liquidambars and Nīkau Palms chosen for the new design touched off heated public discussion in 2006 as their inclusion came at the destruction of previous, established trees (which were not native flora of New Zealand, and thus not retained in the new landscaping plan).

The 2006–2008 project repeatedly increased in cost, from NZ$23 million to around NZ$43.5 million, with some aspects (such as an improved entrance to Myers Park) falling victim to the blowout. While Council noted in June 2007 that progress had often been quicker than expected, the cost overruns, and the long duration of the construction works – which substantially affected pedestrian and motor vehicle traffic as well as retail sales – made the upgrade unpopular in public, at least during the duration. It also became a problem issue for Dick Hubbard in his failed campaign for re-election to Mayor of Auckland in 2007. The upgrade is now considered to have generally been a success, and it won the 2009 Urban Design Award of the New Zealand Institute of Architects, which commended it for creating a quality public realm and sense of place.

===Upgrade priorities===
To accommodate construction work, Auckland City Council reduced traffic lanes for vehicles to one lane in each direction in early 2007. A proposal was made for this to become permanent, with extended public transport provisions such as bus lanes and cycle lanes proposed for the outer lanes. Also proposed was a 30 km/h speed limit. Committee discussions and public consultation resulted in four physical lanes being retained, mainly to safeguard the street layout for future public transport options such as light rail.

The changes included further improvements to pedestrian facilities, with the total footpath area increasing by 20% to almost 14,000 m2, and longer traffic signal phases for pedestrians, while three new signalised pedestrian crossings were introduced mid-block, at accident &#x27;black spots&#x27;. Also undertaken was a reduction of on-street parking spaces from 81 to 51, part of the prioritisation for pedestrians. The remaining spaces became dedicated short-term parking (i.e. drop-offs, loading). Not included in the design were dedicated bus bays, noted as a serious oversight by some critics, causing potential delays on the proposed bus lanes.

== Shooting ==

On 20 July 2023, a mass shooting involving a construction site on the northern end of Queen Street occurred, resulting in the deaths of three people, including the shooter. 

==Buildings and attractions==


At the northern (waterfront) end of Queen Street are several significant buildings. These include:
* Auckland Ferry Building, 1911. Alexander Wiseman architect. This brick and sandstone building is in the Edwardian Baroque style. It was renovated in 1986 at a cost of $11 million.
* Endeans Building, 1914–15. Corner of Queen Street and Quay Street. Built by John Endean, a prominent hotel proprietor, in 1905 and rebuilt 10 years later after a fire. Chilwell and Trevithick architects. The upper floors of this reinforced concrete building were converted to apartments during the 1990s. Listed as a Category II heritage building.
* (Former) Chief Post Office, 1910. John Campbell architect. Opened by Prime Minister William Massey before a crowd of over 8,000. This Edwardian Baroque building of limestone and granite has been incorporated into the Britomart Transport Centre. Campbell was the Government Architect, and consequently this building has similar features to the New Zealand Parliament Buildings in Wellington, which were constructed around the same time.
* (Former) Custom House, 1888. Thomas Mahoney architect, 22 Customs St. This building displays the mansard roofs typical of the French Second Empire Style. In 1909 an addition was built to the south [now demolished]. Prior to the Town Hall&#x27;s opening in 1911 several departments of the Auckland City Council were located here. The Custom House was renovated for retail use in the 1980s.

Between Customs Street and Wellesley Street, Queen Street is lined with retail and office buildings. This section of the street is where the majority of the high-rise buildings are located. These are mostly 20th century in origin, although a number of 19th century structures survive. Many large corporations, insurance companies and banks had substantial buildings on Queen Street and in some cases their head offices were located here rather than in Wellington (the capital). The most significant buildings along the middle part of the street are the:
* Dilworth Building, 1927. Gummer and Ford architects. 22 Queen St. Envisaged as one of a pair of buildings flanking the entrance to Queen Street and thus being a &quot;Gateway to Auckland&quot;. The use of electric cranes rather than hydraulic meant a very short construction period. The Dilworth Building is a reinforced concrete structure encased in Portland stone. William Gummer had been trained in the offices of Sir Edwin Lutyens, and this building shows influence of this connection.
* The Queens Arcade – 34 Queen Street. 1920s Neo-classical building linking the eastern side of Queen Street with Customs Street.
* Imperial Hotel – 66 Queen Street. A Victorian building from 1883 that is now used as a backpackers, the Imperial Hotel incorporated a building that had previously been offices for the Auckland Harbour Board and the Gas Board.
* Guardian Trust Building – 105 Queen Street. A 1919 reinforced concrete structure distinguished by bronze entrance columns. The architect William Gummer had been trained in the offices of Sir Edwin Lutyens, and this building shows influence of this connection. The stone used on the Queen Street façade and in the lobby is Cloudy Bay Marble from Nelson.
* The Deloitte Centre – 80 Queen Street. New tower designed by Woods Bagot Architects which incorporates the Jean Batten State Building.
* Jean Batten State Building – Named after the pioneer New Zealand aviator Jean Batten. Designed by John Mair, government architect in 1937 and completed in 1940. This was intended as office space for Government departments in Auckland which had outgrown their premises in the Custom House in nearby Customs Street. The building was used by the American High Command as their headquarters for the duration of the Second World War.
* South British Insurance Building – 15 Shortland Street. 1927 building by R F Draffin for the South British Insurance Company – the lobby is arguably the best Art-Deco interior in Auckland. The addition to the east dates from 1968 and is on the site of a Victorian Pub.
* General Building – 33 Shortland Street. Neo-Classical skyscraper built for the Yorkshire Insurance Company. Designed by W R Bloomfield in 1928. Bloomfield was probably the first Maori architect. The Shortland Street facade of this building was extended in 1977. Few people looking at the building would be aware that the right hand {western} side of the building is from 1928 and the left hand {eastern} from 1977 as the classical detailing was perfectly replicated.
* Bank of New Zealand Building, 1865. Leonard Terry architect. 125 Queen St. Built of beige sandstone imported from Hobart, Australia, this building was originally only five bays wide, and in 1882 two more bays were added on the Queen Street facade. In 1986 this building was substantially altered, and now only the facade remains, attached to a large high rise office building.
* Vulcan Buildings, 1928. Holman, Moses &amp; Watkins architects. This elegant building stands prominently on the southern corner of Vulcan Lane and Queen Street, and has design influences principally from Neoclassical architecture, but also the English Arts and Crafts movement. A defining feature is the cupola on the top of the building. The building also marks a significant change in built form of Central Auckland, as the city was being transformed from the low-rise buildings of the 19th century to the high-rise buildings of the 20th century.
* Landmark House, formerly Auckland Electric Power Board Building 1927. Wade &amp; Bartley architects. Cnr Queen St and Durham St east. This is an example of the early Art Deco – gothic skyscraper style. The design emphasises the vertical, drawing on references from Chicago and New York skyscrapers of the period. The Auckland Electric Power Board used the building as a form of advertising by flood lighting the exterior.
* Queen Victoria Building, Auckland, formerly John Courts Building. Designed by John Currie in 1899 for the Direct Supply Company. Cnr Queen St and Victoria St East. The first three stories are in the Victorian Italianate style. Internally the building retains its timber columns and floor structure. In 1910 John Court opened his department store in the building and in 1916 added three stories in the same style. 
* AMP Building – 220 Queen Street. 1962 Modernist New York Style Skyscraper. This building is an example of a Glass curtain wall and is distinguished by crisp metal detailing. Designed by Jack Manning for Thorp Cutter Pickmere &amp; Douglas Architects.
* Strand Arcade 233–237 Queen St. Commissioned by local businessman Arthur Myers, built in 1900 with the latest in lifts, ventilation and lighting (the basement restaurant could seat 700). The architect was Arthur Pollard Wilson (who also designed Naval and Family Hotel, Arthur H Nathan Warehouse, Northern Steam Ship Company Building and Isaacs’ Bonded Stores) Renovated in 1970 this Edwardian shopping arcade has remained largely unaltered.
* Auckland Savings Bank Building, 1884. Edward Bartley architect. 260 Queen St. This is an example of the mid Victorian italianate style. The facade displays columns and panels of coloured marble and granite. In 1977 this building became a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant, although the facade and interior remain largely intact due to a sensitive renovation.

Beyond the Wellesley Street intersection lies the midtown district, with its entertainment and civic focus, centred on Aotea Square. Here are located most of the important civic buildings, including the:
* Auckland Civic Theatre, 1929. Bohringer, Taylor &amp; Johnson architects. 269 Queen St. This is one of the best remaining examples of an atmospheric theatre. The monumental Art Deco stripped-classical facade hides a lavish Hollywood inspired interior. The lobby is a reproduction of an Indian rock temple decorated with 500 elephants. The auditorium is decorated as an open courtyard in ancient Baghdad, the ceiling imitating the night sky with hundreds of electric stars placed as they appear in the southern sky. Extensively renovated in 1994 it is now part of a larger entertainment and retail complex. The renovation fixed several problems including the undersized stage and inadequate backstage facilities.
* St. James Theatre – 316 Queen Street. 1927 theatre building in the 1920s Hollywood/Spanish style designed for vaudeville but wired for talking pictures in 1929. The stage capacity, acoustics and seating sightlines meant this theatre was superior to the other venues of the period (His Majesty&#x27;s, King&#x27;s Theatre, and the Auckland Opera House); even after the appearance of the Civic it still stood out as the best venue for traditional live theatre. The landmark turret above the Queen street entrance is possibly still concealed behind modernist cladding.
* Bledisloe House, 1959. A modernist glass facade office block designed for Central Government services as part of the proposed Civic Centre. Designed by Gordon Wilson with Jack Beere and named after Lord Bledisloe (Governor-General of New Zealand from 1930 to 1935). This was the only one of a complex of six identical buildings planned for the environs of what is now Aotea Square. The other five buildings were to be the new Town Hall, a City Administration block, a new Public Library, public Art Gallery and a final office block to be rented out as commercial office space. In the middle of this complex was to be the Auckland Centennial Theatre and a public square. The Admin Bldg was eventually built in 1966 in a different form and the theatre appeared in 1989 as the Aotea Centre. The other four buildings would have required the demolition of all the other buildings on this city block including the 1911 Town Hall and the Civic Theatre. The Bledisloe Building was renovated in 2014 by Auckland Council.
* Aotea Centre, 1990. Ewen Wainscott architect. Initially proposed in 1949 as the Auckland Centennial Hall, construction of this building was delayed for several decades. Intended to supplant the town hall, when it opened it was found to have acoustical problems resulting in a costly refit. Complaints from performers over many years resulted in the renovation of the Town Hall. The lobby of the Aotea Centre contains many art works by New Zealand artists.
* Council Administration Block, 1966. Tibor K.Donner architect. Considered a positive example of 1950s modernism, which contrasts with the 1911 Town Hall on the far side of Aotea Square. Is considered to be Auckland&#x27;s first &#x27;skyscraper&#x27;.
* Auckland Town Hall, 1911. J. Clark &amp; Sons architects. 303 Queen St. A Melbourne firm designed this building in the English Baroque style. It is built of Melbourne Bluestone and Oamaru stone with art nouveau leadlight windows. The main auditorium has excellent acoustics being based upon the famous Gewandhaus Concert Hall in Leipzig, Germany. The large pipe organ was donated by Sir Henry Brett, a former mayor of Auckland. This building was renovated in the late 1990s and continues to be widely considered as Auckland&#x27;s premier concert venue.

Further up Queen Street beyond Mayoral Drive is the uptown district, centred on Myers Park. This is often referred to as Upper Queen Street, although that name actually refers to a separate continuation of Queen Street on the other side of the K&#x27;Road ridge. The most significant buildings in this area are the:
* &#x27;Queen Street Shops&#x27; – 456–488 Queen Street. Range of Edwardian retail buildings from 1909 onwards. Designed by two Auckland architects, T W May and Alexander Wiseman. These form a harmonious ensemble facing Myers Park but also retain many original features often removed from other structures; the curved corrugated iron verandahs are intact and held up by vertical posts, and virtually all the shops&#x27; fronts are intact including the glazed tile work surrounds.
* Theosophical Society Building, 1923. Henry Robinson architect. Located at the Queen St entrance to Myers Park, this is a fine example of interwar neo-classical architecture for the Theosophical Society replacing an earlier structure from 1912 located further down Queen Street. Recently renovated as a &#x27;gentlemen&#x27;s club&#x27; called &#x27;The White House&#x27;.
* Myers Free Kindergarten 1916 B.Chilwell &amp; R.Trevithick architects. Designed as a large homely cottage this brick and stucco building is located in the middle of the 1914 Myers Park. An example of Arts &amp; Crafts architecture which still operates as a kindergarten.
* Auckland Baptist Tabernacle 1884 Edmund Bell architect. Near the corner of Queen St &amp; Karangahape Road. Large Imperial Roman temple. The interior has decorative ceiling stencilwork in the neo-classical style by Samuel and Charles Blomfield.

Beyond the Karangahape Road ridge the southernmost 500 metres of the street is called Upper Queen Street, and it crosses the eastern part of the Central Motorway Junction, the largest interchange on the New Zealand state highway network.

<text>David Gene Parker (born June 9, 1951), nicknamed &quot;the Cobra&quot;, is an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a right fielder from 1973 to 1991. A seven-time All-Star, Parker won two National League batting titles and was the 1978 National League Most Valuable Player. He was a member of two World Series championship teams, winning with the Pittsburgh Pirates in and the Oakland Athletics in .

Parker was the second professional athlete to earn an average of $1 million per year, having signed a five-year, $5 million contract in January 1979. Parker&#x27;s career achievements include 2,712 hits, 339 home runs, 1,493 runs batted in and a lifetime batting average of .290. Parker was also known as a solid defensive outfielder during the first half of his career with a powerful arm, winning three straight Gold Gloves during his prime. From 1975 to 1979, he threw out 72 runners, including 26 in 1977. In , Parker was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Parker grew up in Cincinnati near Crosley Field, where he learned to play baseball on the stadium&#x27;s parking lots. His father, Dick Parker, was a shipping clerk in a foundry. Dave Parker attended Courter Tech High School. He has said his favorite sport was football, and he starred at tailback but injured a knee in a game during his senior year and gave up the game. Also a baseball star, one of his fondest memories is playing at Western Hills High School (alma mater of Pete Rose), where he hit a home run that landed on the roof of a Frisch&#x27;s restaurant.

==Playing career==

===Pittsburgh Pirates===
In 1973, as a member of the Pirates Triple–A minor league affiliate, the Charleston Charlies, legend has it that Parker hit a home run that landed on a coal car on a passing train and the ball was later picked up in Columbus, Ohio. 
However, in a 1975 interview, Parker stated, &quot;When I played for Charleston I always had the ambition to hit a home run onto a moving train. I really used to shoot for that. I hit a few on the tracks, but never as a train was going by.&quot; He began his major league career on July 12, 1973, with the Pittsburgh Pirates, for whom he played from 1973 to 1983. His first full season came in 1975, when he led the National League in slugging percentage (.541) and finished third in NL MVP voting.

In 1977, he was National League batting champion, a feat he repeated in 1978 when he was named the National League MVP. He also paced the NL in slugging percentage (.585), on-base plus slugging (.979), and total bases (340) in his MVP campaign. This was in spite of a collision at home plate with John Stearns during a game against the Mets on June 30, 1978, in which Parker fractured his jaw and cheekbone; he wore a specially constructed facemask in order to minimize his time away from the lineup. The Pirates rewarded him with baseball&#x27;s first million-dollar-per-year contract. The following year, he was an instrumental part of the Pirates&#x27; World Series championship team.

During a game in 1979, a powerful hit he made to right field was very difficult to throw into the infield, because he had &quot;knocked the cover off the ball.&quot; One of the seams on the ball ruptured, making nearly half of the cover come loose.

Pirate fans angered by his million-dollar contract threw &quot;nuts and bolts and bullets and batteries&quot; at him, as pitcher Kent Tekulve stated. A typo in a news story made it appear they threw car batteries.

In 1981 at a point in his career when it looked as if he would one day rank among the game&#x27;s all-time greats, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book &quot;The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time&quot;. The authors, noting that Parker had succeeded Roberto Clemente at the position, wrote, &quot;Someone must have a fondness for right field in Pittsburgh.&quot;

Parker took after his Pirates teammate Willie Stargell in warming up in the on-deck circle with a sledgehammer (when most batters would use a simple lead-weighted bat).

In the early 1980s, however, Parker&#x27;s hitting suffered due to injuries, weight problems and his increasing cocaine use. He became one of the central figures in a drug scandal that spread through the major leagues.

===Later career===
At the end of the 1983 season, Parker became a free agent and signed with the Cincinnati Reds. In Cincinnati, his hometown, he returned to the form that made him an All-Star in Pittsburgh. In 1985, he enjoyed his best season since he won the 1978 MVP with a .312 batting average and 34 home runs; he also led the National League with 125 RBIs, 42 doubles, 80 extra-base hits and 350 total bases. Parker finished second in 1985 MVP voting to Willie McGee. Parker was also the winner of the league&#x27;s first-ever Home Run Derby in 1985.

Following the season, Parker was among several players who testified against a dealer in the Pittsburgh drug trials. Named as &quot;regular users&quot;, Parker and six other players were suspended for the following season. The sentences were commuted, however, in exchange for donating ten percent of their base salaries to drug-related community service, submitting to random drug testing, and contributing 100 hours of drug-related community service.

After the 1987 season, Cincinnati traded Parker to the Oakland Athletics for José Rijo and Tim Birtsas. In Oakland, Parker was able to extend his career by spending most of his time as a designated hitter. Although injuries and age caught up to him to a degree – he hit just .257 with 12 homers in 377 at-bats in 1988 and .264 with 22 homers in 553 at-bats in 1989 – his veteran leadership was a significant factor in the A&#x27;s consecutive World Series appearances which included another World Series title for Parker 1989, exactly 10 years after his first one with the Pirates in &#x27;79.

Parker signed with the Milwaukee Brewers for the 1990 season and had a solid year as the Brewers&#x27; DH with a .289 average and 21 home runs in 610 at-bats. He was even selected as a reserve for the 1990 All-Star Game. Milwaukee opted for youth however, at the end of the year and traded the aging Parker to the Angels for Dante Bichette.

Parker&#x27;s last season was 1991. He played for the California Angels until late in the season before being released. The Toronto Blue Jays then signed him as insurance for the pennant race, and Parker hit .333 in limited action. Since he was acquired too late in the season, he did not qualify for inclusion on the post-season roster and was unable to play in the American League Championship Series against the Minnesota Twins, which the Blue Jays lost in five games. Parker retired at end of the season.

==Career statistics==

Source:

In 30 postseason games, Parker batted .234 (26-for-111) with 11 runs, 5 doubles, 3 home runs, 11 RBI and 7 walks.

==Retirement==
Parker has served as a first-base coach for the Anaheim Angels, a batting coach for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1998, and a special hitting instructor for Pittsburgh. He owned several Popeyes Chicken franchises in Cincinnati until selling his interest in them in 2012 after 25 years.

Parker never got more than 24% of votes on Baseball Hall of Fame ballots, and his 15-year Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America eligibility was exhausted on the ballot. Supporters of Parker&#x27;s candidacy argue that his involvement with the Pittsburgh drug trials has contributed to his not being voted into the Hall of Fame, which may have also harmed the candidacies of Keith Hernandez (who never received more than 10.8% and fell off the writers&#x27; ballot on his ninth try) and Tim Raines (debuted at 24.3%, but was elected on his tenth year on the ballot), serving as a precursor to those listed on the Mitchell Report not being voted into the Hall of Fame due to steroid abuse. 

Parker appeared on the Classic Baseball Era Committee&#x27;s ballot and was elected with 87.5% of the vote on December 8, 2024. He will be formally inducted on July 27, 2025.

Parker has had both of his knees replaced due to injuries from his playing career. In 2013, he confirmed to the &quot;Pittsburgh Tribune-Review&quot; that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. He is involved in raising money to find a cure for Parkinson&#x27;s disease through the Dave Parker 39 Foundation.

Parker has six children. He currently resides in Loveland, Ohio, near Cincinnati, with his wife, Kellye.

Parker was elected to the Reds Hall of Fame Class of 2014, which also included fellow Cincinnati natives Ron Oester and Ken Griffey Jr. In 2012, he was inducted into the Cincinnati Public Schools Athletic Hall of Fame. On September 3, 2022, he was inducted into the Pittsburgh Pirates Hall of Fame as part of its inaugural class.

<text>The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) is a protocol developed for harvesting metadata descriptions of records in an archive so that services can be built using metadata from many archives. An implementation of OAI-PMH must support representing metadata in Dublin Core, but may also support additional representations.

The protocol is usually just referred to as the OAI Protocol.

OAI-PMH uses XML over HTTP. Version 2.0 of the protocol was released in 2002; the document was last updated in 2015. It has a Creative Commons license BY-SA.

==History==
In the late 1990s, Herbert Van de Sompel (Ghent University) was working with researchers and librarians at Los Alamos National Laboratory (US) and called a meeting to address difficulties related to interoperability issues of e-print servers and digital repositories. The meeting was held in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in October 1999. A key development from the meeting was the definition of an interface that permitted e-print servers to expose metadata for the papers it held in a structured fashion so other repositories could identify and copy papers of interest with each other. This interface/protocol was named the &quot;Santa Fe Convention&quot;.

Several workshops were held in 2000 at the ACM Digital Libraries conference, at the 1st ACM/IEEE-CS joint conference on Digital libraries and elsewhere to share the ideas from the Santa Fe Convention. It was discovered at the workshops that the problems faced by the e-print community were also shared by libraries, museums, journal publishers, and others who needed to share distributed resources. To address these needs, the Coalition for Networked Information and the Digital Library Federation provided funding to establish an Open Archives Initiative (OAI) secretariat managed by Herbert Van de Sompel and Carl Lagoze. The OAI held a meeting at Cornell University (Ithaca, New York) in September 2000 aimed to improve the interface developed at the Santa Fe Convention. The specifications were refined over e-mail.

OAI-PMH version 1.0 was introduced to the public in January 2001 at a workshop in Washington D.C., and another in February in Berlin, Germany. Subsequent modifications to the XML standard by the W3C required making minor modifications to OAI-PMH resulting in version 1.1. The current version, 2.0, was released in June 2002. It contained several technical changes and enhancements and is not backward compatible.

== OAI workshops ==
From 2001 CERN, and later in collaboration with University of Geneva, has organized bi-annual OAI workshops, which over time have developed to cover most aspects of open science. Since 2021 the workshop series is named the Geneva Workshop on Innovations in Scholarly Communication, with the nick name OAI reflecting its origin.

==Uses==
Some commercial search engines use OAI-PMH to acquire more resources. Google initially included support for OAI-PMH when launching sitemaps, however decided to support only the standard XML Sitemaps format in May 2008. In 2004, Yahoo! acquired content from OAIster (University of Michigan) that was obtained through metadata harvesting with OAI-PMH. Wikimedia uses an OAI-PMH repository to provide feeds of Wikipedia and related site updates for search engines and other bulk analysis/republishing endeavors. Especially when dealing with thousands of files being harvested every day, OAI-PMH can help in reducing the network traffic and other resource usage by doing incremental harvesting. NASA&#x27;s Mercury metadata search system uses OAI-PMH to index thousands of metadata records from Global Change Master Directory (GCMD) every day.

The mod_oai project is using OAI-PMH to expose content to web crawlers that is accessible from Apache Web servers.

OAI-PMH has later been applied to sharing of scientific data.

==Software==
OAI-PMH is based on a client–server architecture, in which &quot;harvesters&quot; request information on updated records from &quot;repositories&quot;. Requests for data can be based on a datestamp range, and can be restricted to named sets defined by the provider. Data providers are required to provide XML metadata in Dublin Core format, and may also provide it in other XML formats.

A number of software systems support the OAI-PMH, including Fedora, EThOS from the British Library, GNU EPrints from the University of Southampton, Open Journal Systems from the Public Knowledge Project, Desire2Learn, DSpace from MIT, HyperJournal from the University of Pisa, Digibib from Digibis, MyCoRe, Koha, Primo, DigiTool, Rosetta and MetaLib from Ex Libris, ArchivalWare from PTFS, DOOR from the eLab in Lugano, Switzerland, panFMP from the PANGAEA data library, SimpleDL from Roaring Development, and jOAI from the National Center for Atmospheric Research.

==Archives==
A number of large archives support the protocol including arXiv and the CERN Document Server.

<doc id="905793" wikidata="Q3232247" url="?curid=905793" title="Hawksbill Station">
<text>Hawksbill Station is a science fiction novel by American writer Robert Silverberg. The novel is an expanded version of a short story first published in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; in August 1967. The novel was published in 1968 and was released in the United Kingdom under the title &quot;The Anvil of Time&quot;.

==Synopsis==
Hawksbill Station was a penal colony in the Cambrian Period created by an authoritarian United States government, using time travel to exile rebels and political dissidents into the past. The colony houses only male exiles, who are sent there as a &quot;humane&quot; alternative to execution. The machine only works one way, leaving prisoners marooned in the past.

The prison is set in a barren coastal area. The novel focuses on the relationships between the main character, the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the colony, and his nemesis in the government, Jacob “Jack” Bernstein, both of whom were leading dissidents. It also explores the petty ideological differences among the prisoners and the confused circumstances leading to the establishment of the authoritarian government.

The prisoners, all middle-aged or elderly, are surprised by the arrival of a much younger prisoner. The newcomer, supposedly an economist, is questioned about economic theory and political ideology. His answers reveal his essential ignorance of both. This ignorance, combined with his youth, cause the prisoners to wonder if he is, in fact, a political prisoner or a common criminal, exiled for a heinous crime.

When the newcomer arrives via the time machine a second time, it is revealed that he is a police officer of a new government that overthrew the authoritarian government but was unrelated to the dissident movements of the exiles. The new government discovered the existence of Hawksbill Station and a way to travel from past to future, making it possible to retrieve prisoners from the colony. The newcomer has been sent to evaluate the prisoners and to recommend whether they are appropriate for retrieval.

With return now possible, the leader of the exiles realizes that he is a time traveler of a different sort. The struggle against the authoritarian government, his life&#x27;s work, is over. His closest friends in the movement, as well as his most bitter enemies, are dead. He is tempted to visit the newcomer&#x27;s future, but Hawksbill Station is now the only existence he knows.

== Reception ==
Algis Budrys said that &quot;Hawksbill Station&quot; was Silverberg&#x27;s best story.

&quot;Hawksbill Station&quot; was credited by Jeff Vogel, a small indie game developer, as having influenced the design for his game &quot;Exile: Escape from the Pit&quot;, saying that while most of the game&#x27;s plotlines were his, this classic short story helped shape his ideas.

<doc id="905795" wikidata="Q926447" url="?curid=905795" title="Treaty of Gulistan">
<text>The Treaty of Gulistan (also spelled Golestan: ; ) was a peace treaty concluded between the Russian Empire and Qajar Iran on 24 October 1813 in the village of Gulistan (now in the Goranboy District of Azerbaijan) as a result of the first full-scale Russo-Persian War (1804 to 1813). The peace negotiations were precipitated by the successful storming of Lankaran by General Pyotr Kotlyarevsky on 1 January 1813. It was the first of a series of treaties (the last being the Akhal Treaty) signed between Qajar Iran and Imperial Russia that forced Persia to cede the territories that formerly were part of Iran.

The treaty confirmed the ceding and inclusion of what is now Dagestan, eastern Georgia, most of the Republic of Azerbaijan, and parts of northern Armenia from Iran into the Russian Empire.

The text was prepared by the British diplomat Sir Gore Ouseley, who served as a mediator and wielded a significant degree of influence in the Persian court. It was signed by Nikolai Rtischev for Russia and Mirza Abolhassan Khan Ilchi for Persia.

The result of the treaty was the transfer of the bulk of Iran&#x27;s Caucasian territories to the Russian Empire. The treaty also directly contributed to the outbreak of the next war of the 19th century: the Russo-Persian War (1826–1828), in which the Iranian forces were defeated once more. In the following Treaty of Turkmenchay, Qajar Iran lost possession of its last remaining Caucasian territories, comprising modern-day Armenia and the remaining part of modern-day Azerbaijan. By 1828, Iran had lost by both treaties all of those integral territories in Transcaucasia and the North Caucasus. The area north of the Aras River, including the territory of the contemporary nations of Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia and the North Caucasian Republic of Dagestan, were part of Iran until they were occupied by Russia during the 19th century.

As a further direct result and consequence of the Treaty of Gulistan in combination with the 1828 Treaty of Turkmenchay, the formerly Iranian territories came under the Russian, and later the Soviet control for approximately 180 years, and Dagestan remains a constituent republic within the Russian Federation to this day. Comprising most of the territory ceded in Gulistan and Turkmenchay treaties, three separate nations would gain independence following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991: Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia.

==Background==
In 1801, the Russian Empire had sworn in a new tsar, Alexander I, who was eager to expand Russia&#x27;s control over its neighboring territories. A few years previously in Iran, Fath Ali Shah Qajar also became the new shah after the assassination of his uncle, Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar, in 1797. During his reign, Agha Mohammad Khan had defeated and re-subordinated the Afsharid/Safavid vassals and subjects in the regions of modern-day eastern Georgia, Armenia, southern Dagestan, and Azerbaijan, and claimed those areas as rightfully belonging to Persia. During and after the Battle of Krtsanisi in 1795, he had regained full control over eastern Georgia, Dagestan, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. Several years later, after Agha Mohammad Khan was assassinated in Shusha and Heraclius II of Georgia had died as well. Russia, wishing to expand its territory and trade, capitalized on the opportunity to annex eastern Georgia. The Persian court attempted to align itself with France in 1801 in order to establish a better position in case of war with Russia, but those attempts were unsuccessful. Later, as both Russia and Britain were engaged in the Napoleonic Wars, Fath Ali Shah instead brokered a deal with Britain to provide Persia with military support from British troops in exchange for preventing any European country from entering India. Following the agreement, Persia entered into the First Russo-Persian War against a militarily-preoccupied Russia, which was heavily invested in the Napoleonic Wars. 

The primary motive of the Persian court when entering the war was to reassert its control over Georgia and to ensure the protection of the rest of its northwestern borders. However, Fath Ali Shah had also heard about the atrocities being committed by Russian Commanders in Georgia &quot;through massive extortion and maladministration&quot;.

Numerically, the Persian forces had a considerable advantage during the war, wielding an army as much as five times larger than the Russians in the Caucasus. However, the Persian forces lagged behind technologically and were poorly trained, a problem that the Persian government did not recognize until far later. Despite these significant disadvantages, the fighting continued in northern Persia, Azerbaijan and in regions of Georgia. Persian court went so far as to declare a jihad against the Russian Empire and called upon its Iranian subjects to maintain unity. The Persian court also requested military and financial aid from France&#x27;s Napoleon in light of the Franco-Persian alliance. Although France promised to support Iran&#x27;s ambitions and help it regain its recently-lost territory of Georgia, ultimately Napoleon left Persia unassisted given France&#x27;s relations with Russia were more important after the two countries signed the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807. The turning point of the war came on 31 October 1812 during the Battle of Aslanduz, in which the Persian army suffered a decisive defeat. Following the battle, Fath Ali Shah had no option but to sign the Treaty of Gulistan.

According to Cambridge History of Iran: 
==Terms==

#&quot;Russia by this instrument was confirmed in possession of all the khanates – Karabagh, Ganja, Shekeen, Shirvan, Derbend, Kouba, and Baku, together with part of Talish and the fortress of Lenkoran. Persia further abandoned all pretensions to Daghestan, Georgia, Mingrelia, Imeretia, and Abkhazia.&quot;
#The lands include:
##All the cities, towns, and villages of Georgia, including all the villages and towns on the coast of the Black Sea, such as:
##Megrelia,
##Abkhazia,
##Imeretia,
##Guria;
##Almost all cities, towns, and villages of the khanates in the South Caucasus and partly North Caucasus:
##Baku khanate,
##Shirvan Khanate,
##Derbent Khanate,
##Karabakh khanate,
##Ganja khanate,
##Shaki Khanate,
##Quba Khanate,
##part of the Talysh Khanate;
#Iran loses all rights to navigate the Caspian Sea, and Russia is granted exclusive rights to station its military fleet in the Caspian Sea.
#Both countries agree on the establishment of free trade, with Russians having free access to conduct business anywhere in Iran.
##Iran is also given complete and free access to Russia, but both must pay a 5% &quot;ad valorem tax&quot; on any items imported into each respective country, thus being seen as a light import/export duty tax.
#Russia, in return, promises to support Abbas Mirza as heir to the Persian throne after the death of Fath Ali Shah.

==Assessment==
Even today, Iran officially sees it and the later Treaty of Turkmenchay as some of its most humiliating treaties ever signed. The treaty is also regarded by Iranians as the main reason why Fath Ali Shah is seen as one of Iran&#x27;s most incompetent rulers in memory. Scholars in Azerbaijan point out that the Karabakh Khanate, where the treaty was signed, had pursued an independent foreign policy as early as 1795, when &quot;Ibrahim Khalil Khan, the wali of Qarabagh, fearing for his independence, warned Sultan Selim III of Agha Muhammad Khan Qajar&#x27;s ambitions to subdue Azerbaijan and later Qarabagh, Erivan and Georgia. In the same year Muhammad Khan, the hakim of Erivan, also wrote a letter to Selim III, alerting him to Agha Muhammad&#x27;s &#x27;aggression, and seeking Ottoman protection&quot;.

Imperial Russian historians maintained that Russia&#x27;s absorption of the Transcaucasia shielded the local populations from the constant Iranian and Ottoman invasions, and that the Christian nations of the Caucasus were liberated from Muslim repression, which ensured peace and stability in the region.

Vital to the signing of the treaty was the agreement made by Fath Ali Shah with Britain. With the defeat in the Russo-Persian War, the Shah understood that another attack by the Russians was almost inevitable. Britain saw such a war as unwinnable for the Persians, and so took advantage of Persia&#x27;s weakness to strengthen their foreign affairs in the region. Using their new-found diplomatic connections with the British, Persia established the Treaty of Defensive Alliance in 1812, which promised that Britain would &quot;offer a defensive alliance against further Russian encroachments&quot;. Its terms essentially stated that Persia would defend against any European army entering India, which stationed British troops, and in return, Britain would provide military and financial against any future Russian attack.

==Aftermath==

The treaty of Gulistan did not answer vital questions such as whether the Persian army would be disarmed or be able to regroup. It was obvious to both sides that Persia would potentially attempt to reclaim the territories in the future, given the Persian court considered the captured regions rightfully Iranian and opposed Russia&#x27;s repressive treatment of the Caucasian populations. The war had become costly in terms of finance and manpower, so the Treaty of Gulistan led to over a decade of relative peace (1813–1826) between Russia and Persia, primarily for the clause regarding trade: both governments saw substantial potential in it. Permanent diplomatic missions were set up in Persia as well as in Russia in order to keep trade open for as long as possible. The tensions remained, however, as the governments of both countries understood that the terms of the treaty were vague, and that nothing was written about provisions for the military, mainly to prevent Persia from trying to regain the regions of Georgia or the Caucasus, thus leaving open the possibility of another future war. It is likely that neither the Iranian Shah nor the Russian Tsar regarded the treaty of Gulistan as definitive.

According to Prof. Timothy C. Dowling:
According to Prof. William Bayne Fisher (&quot;et al.&quot;):
Another consequence of Persia&#x27;s losses to Russia and the subsequent treaties of Gulistan and Turkemenchay was the separation of the Azerbaijani and Talysh people from their brethren in Iran.

The area to the North of the river Aras, amongst which is the territory of the contemporary nations of Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia and the North Caucasian Republic of Dagestan, were Iranian territory until they were occupied by Russia in the course of the 19th century.

==Precursor to Second Russo-Persian War of 1826–1828==
The Treaty of Gulistan did not resolve the possibility of a future conflict between Russia and Iran. Russia&#x27;s priority before the war was Europe and the Napoleonic Wars, which explains the relatively small number of troops that Russia dedicated to the Russo-Persian War. The Treaty of Gulistan can be primarily regarded as a way for both countries to &quot;gain a breath&quot; so that they could focus on other issues. After the treaty was signed, Persia began rapidly building up its army once more, as Fath Ali Shah was fully devoted to regaining the lost territories. It is therefore not surprising that Fath Ali Shah ordered his military commander, Abbas Mirza, to start training troops in 1823, three years before the following Russo-Persian War. Furthermore, the Persian clergy publicly announced that the jihad against Russia was not over. In 1826, Persia, with British support, once again invaded the territories lost to Russia. The second war lasted two years, and Persia lost 35,000 troops to Russia&#x27;s 8,000. Persia&#x27;s defeat culminated in the Treaty of Turkmenchay, which resulted in further losses of modern-day Armenia and the remaining parts of Azerbaijan.

<text>Belgrano is a northern and &quot;barrio&quot; or neighborhood of Buenos Aires, Argentina. It is made up of middle and upper class people. Belgrano has three distinct areas: the main one that is made up of apartment buildings, Belgrano &quot;R&quot; which is a leafy suburb area with English architecture, and Buenos Aires&#x27; Chinatown.

== Location ==

The barrio of Palermo is to the southeast; Núñez is to the northwest; Coghlan, Villa Urquiza, Villa Ortúzar and Colegiales are to the southwest.

== History ==

Belgrano was named after Manuel Belgrano, a politician and military leader who created the national flag of Argentina.
In 1820, at Belgrano&#x27;s death, Buenos Aires&#x27; legislature introduced a law to name the next town to be founded after him. This happened in 1855, when the Buenos Aires government, fearful that relatives of Juan Manuel de Rosas would dispute the governmental decision to expropriate Rosas&#x27; lands, laid down a new town on part of it and named it Belgrano. The town was declared a city shortly thereafter, due to its booming growth, and in 1880 it became the nation&#x27;s capital for a few weeks, because of the dispute between the national government and Buenos Aires province for the status of the city of Buenos Aires. It was in Belgrano that the law declaring Buenos Aires as Argentina&#x27;s federal capital was issued.

In 1887, the federal district was enlarged by the annexation of the towns (partidos) of Belgrano and Flores.

== Subsections ==
Belgrano is an upper-middle-class neighborhood that can be roughly divided into Belgrano R, Belgrano C, central Belgrano, and Lower Belgrano (Bajo Belgrano). The heart of the barrio pulses with life on its main thoroughfare, Avenida Cabildo, which runs Northwest to Southeast; the subway (subte) Line D follows its route.

Avenida Cabildo carries heavy automobile traffic, and features corner cafés, grocery stores, movie theaters, specialty shops, clothing boutiques, bookstores, and other retail venues. Thanks to its wide sidewalks, pedestrians are especially numerous on weekend afternoons as Porteños (residents of Buenos Aires) from various areas of the city come to shop.

Most of the neighborhood&#x27;s densest housing is located in the vicinity of Cabildo. High-rise luxury apartment buildings are clustered on the leafy streets surrounding the Universidad de Belgrano, a private liberal-arts university.

West of Crámer avenue, &quot;Belgrano R&quot; is chiefly residential and lower-density in nature, characterized by calm streets lined with large, mature shade trees. Most buildings in this section are detached single-family homes that follow North American architectural styles; some residences have sizable backyards with swimming pools. This section is favored by wealthy Argentines and expatriate businesspeople, and also by the embassies of Egypt, Japan, Republic of Korea, Tunisia, United Arab Emitates, among others. Some expensive private, bilingual schools are located in the area.

&quot;Belgrano C&quot; is also home to Buenos Aires&#x27;s small Chinatown. The district is crowded with restaurants and specialty grocery stores catering to Asian-Argentines and to the general public.

== Transportation ==
Other than Cabildo, avenues Libertador, Luis Maria Campos, Crámer, Ricardo Balbín (formerly known as del Tejar), and Figueroa Alcorta run parallel to the riverbank, while Federico Lacroze, Juramento, Monroe and Congreso run from the riverbank to the Southwest direction. Belgrano is served by the Buenos Aires metro line D, many bus lines (notably Colectivo 60), and two commuter rail lines. Approximately 1.5 km to the west of Belgrano lies Avenida General Paz, a major limited-access freeway that defines the city limits of Buenos Aires proper. Beyond this avenue lie the suburbs of Vicente Lopez, Florida and Olivos.

== Notable attractions ==
The lush park Barrancas de Belgrano was designed by the famous French-Argentine landscape/park architect Carlos Thays, who designed many open spaces throughout Buenos Aires. Several blocks north of the Belgrano University, Barrancas de Belgrano spans several city blocks and is overlooked by highrise upper-middle class apartment buildings.

On Manuel Belgrano square, a local artisan fair is held regularly, and becomes especially vibrant on weekends. It features a small bust of Manuel Belgrano on its middle spot.

In the edge of the &quot;plaza&quot; lies the &quot;Inmaculada Concepción&quot; church, called &quot;La Redonda&quot; (&quot;the round one&quot;) by locals because of its circular plan. Many weddings are celebrated in this church in the afternoon hours. Two museums are also across Juramento and Cuba streets: &quot;Larreta&quot; and &quot;Sarmiento&quot;, respectively. Larreta museum focus on Spanish art. It is located on the former private residence of writer Enrique Larreta, designed by architect Ernesto Bunge on 1882. It features a well kept Andalusian garden. Historical Museum Sarmiento exhibits some objects belonging to former presidents Domingo Faustino Sarmiento and Nicolás Avellaneda. It is located in what used to be Belgrano townhall, where the national congress held its sessions while Belgrano was the capital of the Argentine republic. Nearby, going down to Lower Belgrano (Bajo Belgrano), appears the Barrancas de Belgrano, three squares along together, older Rio de la Plata River natural terraces. Two blocks away, in Lower Bergrano there is the Estadio de Excursionistas, the local football team. Although neighboring Nuñez is widely known as the home of River Plate, its landmark stadium River Plate Stadium—also home of the Argentina national football team—is located within the boundaries of Belgrano.

<doc id="905803" wikidata="Q7834793" url="?curid=905803" title="Transparent ceramics">
<text>Many ceramic materials, both glassy and crystalline, have found use as optically transparent materials in various forms from bulk solid-state components to high surface area forms such as thin films, coatings, and fibers. Such devices have found widespread use for various applications in the electro-optical field including: optical fibers for guided lightwave transmission, optical switches, laser amplifiers and lenses, hosts for solid-state lasers and optical window materials for gas lasers, and infrared (IR) heat seeking devices for missile guidance systems and IR night vision. In commercial and general knowledge domains, it is commonly accepted that transparent ceramics or ceramic glass are varieties of strengthened glass, such as those used for the screen glass on an iPhone.

While single-crystalline ceramics may be largely defect-free (particularly within the spatial scale of the incident light wave), optical transparency in polycrystalline materials is limited by the amount of light that is scattered by their microstructural features. The amount of light scattering therefore depends on the wavelength of the incident radiation, or light.

For example, since visible light has a wavelength scale on the order of hundreds of nanometers, scattering centers will have dimensions on a similar spatial scale. Most ceramic materials, such as alumina and its compounds, are formed from fine powders, yielding a fine grained polycrystalline microstructure that is filled with scattering centers comparable to the wavelength of visible light. Thus, they are generally opaque as opposed to transparent materials. Recent nanoscale technology, however, has made possible the production of (poly)crystalline transparent ceramics such as alumina Al2O3, yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG), and neodymium-doped .

==Introduction==

Transparent ceramics have recently acquired a high degree of interest and notoriety. Basic applications include lasers and cutting tools, transparent armor windows, night vision devices (NVD), and nose cones for heat seeking missiles. Currently available infrared (IR) transparent materials typically exhibit a trade-off between optical performance and mechanical strength. For example, sapphire (crystalline alumina) is very strong, but lacks full transparency throughout the 3–5 micrometer mid-IR range. Yttria is fully transparent from 3–5 micrometers, but lacks sufficient strength, hardness, and thermal shock resistance for high-performance aerospace applications. Not surprisingly, a combination of these two materials in the form of the yttria-alumina garnet (YAG) has proven to be one of the top performers in the field.

In 1961, General Electric began selling transparent alumina Lucalox bulbs. In 1966, GE announced a ceramic &quot;transparent as glass&quot;, called Yttralox. In 2004, Anatoly Rosenflanz and colleagues at 3M used a &quot;flame-spray&quot; technique to alloy aluminium oxide (or alumina) with rare-earth metal oxides in order to produce high strength glass-ceramics with good optical properties. The method avoids many of the problems encountered in conventional glass forming and may be extensible to other oxides. This goal has been readily accomplished and amply demonstrated in laboratories and research facilities worldwide using the emerging chemical processing methods encompassed by the methods of sol–gel chemistry and nanotechnology.

Many ceramic materials, both glassy and crystalline, have found use as hosts for solid-state lasers and as optical window materials for gas lasers. The first working laser was made by Theodore H. Maiman in 1960 at Hughes Research Laboratories in Malibu, who had the edge on other research teams led by Charles H. Townes at Columbia University, Arthur Schawlow at Bell Labs, and Gould at TRG (Technical Research Group). Maiman used a solid-state light-pumped synthetic ruby to produce red laser light at a wavelength of 694 nanometers (nm). Synthethic ruby lasers are still in use. Both sapphires and rubies are corundum, a crystalline form of aluminium oxide (Al2O3).

===Crystals===
Ruby lasers consist of single-crystal sapphire alumina (Al2O3) rods doped with a small concentration of chromium Cr, typically in the range of 0.05%. The end faces are highly polished with a planar and parallel configuration. Neodymium-doped YAG (Nd:YAG) has proven to be one of the best solid-state laser materials. Its indisputable dominance in a broad variety of laser applications is determined by a combination of high emission cross section with long spontaneous emission lifetime, high damage threshold, mechanical strength, thermal conductivity, and low thermal beam distortion. The fact that the Czochralski crystal growth of Nd:YAG is a matured, highly reproducible and relatively simple technological procedure adds significantly to the value of the material.

Nd:YAG lasers are used in manufacturing for engraving, etching, or marking a variety of metals and plastics. They are extensively used in manufacturing for cutting and welding steel and various alloys. For automotive applications (cutting and welding steel) the power levels are typically 1–5 kW.
In addition, Nd:YAG lasers are used in ophthalmology to correct posterior capsular opacification, a condition that may occur after cataract surgery, and for peripheral iridotomy in patients with acute angle-closure glaucoma, where it has superseded surgical iridectomy. Frequency-doubled Nd:YAG lasers (wavelength 532 nm) are used for pan-retinal photocoagulation in patients with diabetic retinopathy. In oncology, Nd:YAG lasers can be used to remove skin cancers.
These lasers are also used extensively in the field of cosmetic medicine for laser hair removal and the treatment of minor vascular defects such as spider veins on the face and legs. Recently used for dissecting cellulitis, a rare skin disease usually occurring on the scalp. Using hysteroscopy in the field of gynecology, the Nd:YAG laser has been used for removal of uterine septa within the inside of the uterus.
In dentistry, Nd:YAG lasers are used for soft tissue surgeries in the oral cavity.

=== Glasses ===
Glasses (non-crystalline ceramics) also are used widely as host materials for lasers. Relative to crystalline lasers, they offer improved flexibility in size and shape and may be readily manufactured as large, homogeneous, isotropic solids with excellent optical properties. The indices of refraction of glass laser hosts may be varied between approximately 1.5 and 2.0, and both the temperature coefficient of &quot;n&quot; and the strain-optical coefficient may be tailored by altering the chemical composition. Glasses have lower thermal conductivities than the alumina or YAG, however, which imposes limitations on their use in continuous and high repetition-rate applications.

The principal differences between the behavior of glass and crystalline ceramic laser host materials are associated with the greater variation in the local environment of lasing ions in amorphous solids. This leads to a broadening of the fluorescent levels in glasses. For example, the width of the Nd3+ emission in YAG is ~ 10 angstroms as compared to ~ 300 angstroms in typical oxide glasses. The broadened fluorescent lines in glasses make it more difficult to obtain continuous wave laser operation (CW), relative to the same lasing ions in crystalline solid laser hosts.

Several glasses are used in transparent armor, such as normal plate glass (soda-lime-silica), borosilicate glass, and fused silica. Plate glass has been the most common glass used due to its low cost. But greater requirements for the optical properties and ballistic performance have necessitated the development of new materials. Chemical or thermal treatments can increase the strength of glasses, and the controlled crystallization of certain glass compositions can produce optical quality glass-ceramics. Alstom Grid Ltd. currently produces a lithium di-silicate based glass-ceramic known as TransArm, for use in transparent armor systems. It has all the workability of an amorphous glass, but upon recrystallization it demonstrates properties similar to a crystalline ceramic. Vycor is 96% fused silica glass, which is crystal clear, lightweight and high strength. One advantage of these type of materials is that they can be produced in large sheets and other curved shapes.

===Nanomaterials===
It has been shown fairly recently that laser elements (amplifiers, switches, ion hosts, etc.) made from fine-grained ceramic nanomaterials—produced by the low temperature sintering of high purity nanoparticles and powders—can be produced at a relatively low cost. These components are free of internal stress or intrinsic birefringence, and allow relatively large doping levels or optimized custom-designed doping profiles. This highlights the use of ceramic nanomaterials as being particularly important for high-energy laser elements and applications.

Primary scattering centers in polycrystalline nanomaterials—made from the sintering of high purity nanoparticles and powders—include microstructural defects such as residual porosity and grain boundaries (see Transparent materials). Thus, opacity partly results from the incoherent scattering of light at internal surfaces and interfaces. In addition to porosity, most of the interfaces or internal surfaces in ceramic nanomaterials are in the form of grain boundaries which separate nanoscale regions of crystalline order. Moreover, when the size of the scattering center (or grain boundary) is reduced well below the size of the wavelength of the light being scattered, the light scattering no longer occurs to any significant extent.

In the processing of high performance ceramic nanomaterials with superior opto-mechanical properties under adverse conditions, the size of the crystalline grains is determined largely by the size of the crystalline particles present in the raw material during the synthesis or formation of the object. Thus a reduction of the original particle size well below the wavelength of visible light (~ 0.5 μm or 500 nm) eliminates much of the light scattering, resulting in a translucent or even transparent material.

Furthermore, results indicate that microscopic pores in sintered ceramic nanomaterials, mainly trapped at the junctions of microcrystalline grains, cause light to scatter and prevented true transparency. It has been observed that the total volume fraction of these nanoscale pores (both intergranular and intragranular porosity) must be less than 1% for high-quality optical transmission, i.e. the density has to be 99.99% of the theoretical crystalline density.

==Lasers==
===Nd:YAG===

For example, a 1.46 kW Nd:YAG laser has been demonstrated by Konoshima Chemical Co. in Japan. In addition, Livermore researchers realized that these fine-grained ceramic nanomaterials might greatly benefit high-powered lasers used in the National Ignition Facility (NIF) Programs Directorate. In particular, a Livermore research team began to acquire advanced transparent nanomaterials from Konoshima to determine if they could meet the optical requirements needed for Livermore&#x27;s Solid-State Heat Capacity Laser (SSHCL). Livermore researchers have also been testing applications of these materials for applications such as advanced drivers for laser-driven fusion power plants.

Assisted by several workers from the NIF, the Livermore team has produced 15 mm diameter samples of transparent Nd:YAG from nanoscale particles and powders, and determined the most important parameters affecting their quality. In these objects, the team largely followed the Japanese production and processing methodologies, and used an in house furnace to vacuum sinter the nanopowders. All specimens were then sent out for hot isostatic pressing (HIP). Finally, the components were returned to Livermore for coating and testing, with results indicating exceptional optical quality and properties.

One Japanese/East Indian consortium has focused specifically on the spectroscopic and stimulated emission characteristics of Nd3+ in transparent YAG nanomaterials for laser applications. Their materials were synthesized using vacuum sintering techniques. The spectroscopic studies suggest overall improvement in absorption and emission and reduction in scattering loss. Scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope observations revealed an excellent optical quality with low pore volume and narrow grain boundary width. Fluorescence and Raman measurements reveal that the Nd3+ doped YAG nanomaterial is comparable in quality to its single-crystal counterpart in both its radiative and non-radiative properties. Individual Stark levels are obtained from the absorption and fluorescence spectra and are analyzed in order to identify the stimulated emission channels possible in the material. Laser performance studies favor the use of high dopant concentration in the design of an efficient microchip laser. With 4 at% dopant, the group obtained a slope efficiency of 40%. High-power laser experiments yield an optical-to-optical conversion efficiency of 30% for Nd (0.6 at%) YAG nanomaterial as compared to 34% for an Nd (0.6 at%) YAG single crystal. Optical gain measurements conducted in these materials also show values comparable to single crystal, supporting the contention that these materials could be suitable substitutes to single crystals in solid-state laser applications.

===Yttria, Y2O3===
The initial work in developing transparent yttrium oxide nanomaterials was carried out by General Electric in the 1960s.

In 1966, a transparent ceramic, Yttralox, was invented by Dr. Richard C. Anderson at the General Electric Research Laboratory, with further work at GE&#x27;s Metallurgy and Ceramics Laboratory by Drs. Paul J. Jorgensen, Joseph H. Rosolowski, and Douglas St. Pierre. Yttralox is &quot;transparent as glass&quot;, has a melting point twice as high, and transmits frequencies in the near infrared band as well as visible light.

Further development of yttrium ceramic nanomaterials was carried out by General Electric in the 1970s in Schenectady and Cleveland, motivated by lighting and ceramic laser applications. Yttralox, transparent yttrium oxide Y2O3 containing ~ 10% thorium oxide (ThO2) was fabricated by Greskovich and Woods. The additive served to control grain growth during densification, so that porosity remained on grain boundaries and not trapped inside grains where it would be quite difficult to eliminate during the initial stages of sintering. Typically, as polycrystalline ceramics densify during heat treatment, grains grow in size while the remaining porosity decreases both in volume fraction and in size. Optically transparent ceramics must be virtually pore-free.

GE&#x27;s transparent Yttralox was followed by GTE&#x27;s lanthana-doped yttria with similar level of additive. Both of these materials required extended firing times at temperatures above 2000 °C. La2O3 – doped Y2O3 is of interest for infrared (IR) applications because it is one of the longest wavelength transmitting oxides. It is refractory with a melting point of 2430 °C and has a moderate coefficient of thermal expansion. The thermal shock and erosion resistance is considered to be intermediate among the oxides, but outstanding compared to non-oxide IR transmitting materials. A major consideration is the low emissivity of yttria, which limits background radiation upon heating. It is also known that the phonon edge gradually moves to shorter wavelengths as a material is heated.

In addition, yttria itself, Y2O3 has been clearly identified as a prospective solid-state laser material. In particular, lasers with ytterbium as dopant allow the efficient operation both in cw operation
and in pulsed regimes.

At high concentration of excitations (of order of 1%) and poor cooling, the quenching of emission at laser frequency and avalanche broadband emission takes place.

===Future===
The Livermore team is also exploring new ways to chemically synthesize the initial nanopowders. Borrowing on expertise developed in CMS over the past 5 years, the team is synthesizing nanopowders based on sol–gel processing, and then sintering them accordingly in order to obtain the solid-state laser components. Another technique being tested utilizes a combustion process in order to generate the powders by burning an organic solid containing yttrium, aluminum, and neodymium. The smoke is then collected, which consists of spherical nanoparticles.

The Livermore team is also exploring new forming techniques (e.g. extrusion molding) which have the capacity to create more diverse, and possibly more complicated, shapes. These include shells and tubes for improved coupling to the pump light and for more efficient heat transfer. In addition, different materials can be co-extruded and then sintered into a monolithic transparent solid. An amplifier slab can be formed so that part of the structure acts in guided lightwave transmission in order to focus pump light from laser diodes into regions with a high concentration of dopant ions near the slab center.

In general, nanomaterials promise to greatly expand the availability of low-cost, high-end laser components in much larger sizes than would be possible with traditional single crystalline ceramics. Many classes of laser designs could benefit from nanomaterial-based laser structures such as amplifies with built-in edge claddings. Nanomaterials could also provide more robust and compact designs for high-peak power, fusion-class lasers for stockpile stewardship, as well as high-average-power lasers for global theater ICBM missile defense systems (e.g. Strategic Defense Initiative SDI, or more recently the Missile Defense Agency.

==Night vision==
A night vision device (NVD) is an optical instrument that allows images to be produced in levels of light approaching total darkness. They are most often used by the military and law enforcement agencies, but are available to civilian users. Night vision devices were first used in World War II,
and came into wide use during the Vietnam War. The technology has evolved greatly since their introduction, leading to several &quot;generations&quot; of night vision equipment with performance increasing and price decreasing. The United States Air Force is experimenting with Panoramic Night Vision Goggles (PNVGs) which double the user&#x27;s field of view to approximately 95 degrees by using four 16 mm image intensifiers tubes, rather than the more standard two 18 mm tubes.

Thermal images are visual displays of the amount of infrared (IR) energy emitted, transmitted, and reflected by an object. Because there are multiple sources of the infrared energy, it is difficult to get an accurate temperature of an object using this method. A thermal imaging camera is capable of performing algorithms to interpret that data and build an image. Although the image shows the viewer an approximation of the temperature at which the object is operating, the camera is using multiple sources of data based on the areas surrounding the object to determine that value rather than detecting the temperature.

Night vision infrared devices image in the near-infrared, just beyond the visual spectrum, and can see emitted or reflected near-infrared in complete visual darkness. All objects above the absolute zero temperature (0 K) emit infrared radiation. Hence, an excellent way to measure thermal variations is to use an thermographic device, usually a focal plane array (FPA) infrared camera capable of detecting radiation in the mid (3 to 5 μm) and long (7 to 14 μm) wave infrared bands, denoted as MWIR and LWIR, corresponding to two of the high transmittance infrared windows. Abnormal temperature profiles at the surface of an object are an indication of a potential problem.
Thermal cameras detect radiation in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum (roughly 900–14,000 nanometers or 0.9–14 μm) and produce images of that radiation, called &quot;thermograms&quot;.

Since infrared radiation is emitted by all objects near room temperature, according to the black body radiation law, thermography makes it possible to see one&#x27;s environment with or without visible illumination. The amount of radiation emitted by an object increases with temperature. Therefore, thermography allows one to see variations in temperature. When viewed through a thermal imaging camera, warm objects stand out well against cooler backgrounds; humans and other warm-blooded animals become easily visible against the environment, day or night. As a result, thermography is particularly useful to the military and to security services.

===Thermography===
In thermographic imaging, infrared radiation with wavelengths between 8–13 micrometers strikes the detector material, heating it, and thus changing its electrical resistance. This resistance change is measured and processed into temperatures which can be used to create an image. Unlike other types of infrared detecting equipment, microbolometers utilizing a transparent ceramic detector do not require cooling. Thus, a microbolometer is essentially an uncooled thermal sensor.

The material used in the detector must demonstrate large changes in resistance as a result of minute changes in temperature. As the material is heated, due to the incoming infrared radiation, the resistance of the material decreases. This is related to the material&#x27;s temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) specifically its negative temperature coefficient. Industry currently manufactures microbolometers that contain materials with TCRs near −2%.

===VO2 and V2O5===
The most commonly used ceramic material in IR radiation microbolometers is vanadium oxide. The various crystalline forms of vanadium oxide include both VO2 and V2O5. Deposition at high temperatures and performing post-annealing allows for the production of thin films of these crystalline compounds with superior properties, which may be easily integrated into the fabrication process. VO2 has low resistance but undergoes a metal-insulator phase change near 67 °C and also has a lower TCR value. On the other hand, V2O5 exhibits high resistance and also high TCR.

Other IR transparent ceramic materials that have been investigated include doped forms of CuO, MnO and SiO.

==Missiles==
Many ceramic nanomaterials of interest for transparent armor solutions are also used for electromagnetic (EM) windows. These applications include radomes, IR domes, sensor protection, and multi-spectral windows. Optical properties of the materials used for these applications are critical, as the transmission window and related cut-offs (UV – IR) control the spectral bandwidth over which the window is operational. Not only must these materials possess abrasion resistance and strength properties common of most armor applications, but due to the extreme temperatures associated with the environment of military aircraft and missiles, they must also possess excellent thermal stability.

Thermal radiation is electromagnetic radiation emitted from the surface of an object which is due to the object&#x27;s temperature. Infrared homing refers to a passive missile guidance system which uses the emission from a target of electromagnetic radiation in the infrared part of the spectrum to track it. Missiles that use infrared seeking are often referred to as &quot;heat-seekers&quot;, since infrared is just below the visible spectrum of light in frequency and is radiated strongly by hot bodies. Many objects such as people, vehicle engines and aircraft generate and retain heat, and as such, are especially visible in the infrared wavelengths of light compared to objects in the background.

===Sapphire===
The current material of choice for high-speed infrared-guided missile domes is single-crystal sapphire. The optical transmission of sapphire does not extend to cover the entire mid-infrared range (3–5 μm), but starts to drop off at wavelengths greater than approximately 4.5 μm at room temperature. While the strength of sapphire is better than that of other available mid-range infrared dome materials at room temperature, it weakens above ~600 °C.

Limitations to larger area sapphires are often business related, in that larger induction furnaces and costly tooling dies are necessary in order to exceed current fabrication limits. However, as an industry, sapphire producers have remained competitive in the face of coating-hardened glass and new ceramic nanomaterials, and still managed to offer high performance and an expanded market.

===Yttria, Y2O3===
Alternative materials, such as yttrium oxide, offer better optical performance, but inferior mechanical durability. Future high-speed infrared-guided missiles will require new domes that are substantially more durable than those in use today, while still retaining maximum transparency across a wide wavelength range. A long-standing trade-off exists between optical bandpass and mechanical durability within the current collection of single-phase infrared transmitting materials, forcing missile designers to compromise on system performance. Optical nanocomposites may present the opportunity to engineer new materials that overcome this traditional compromise.

The first full scale missile domes of transparent yttria manufactured from nanoscale ceramic powders were developed in the 1980s under Navy funding. Raytheon perfected and characterized its undoped polycrystalline yttria, while lanthana-doped yttria was similarly developed by GTE Labs. The two versions had comparable IR transmittance, fracture toughness, and thermal expansion, while the undoped version exhibited twice the value of thermal conductivity.

Renewed interest in yttria windows and domes has prompted efforts to enhance mechanical properties by using nanoscale materials with submicrometer or nanosized grains. In one study, three vendors were selected to provide nanoscale powders for testing and evaluation, and they were compared to a conventional (5 μm) yttria powder previously used to prepare transparent yttria. While all of the nanopowders evaluated had impurity levels that were too high to allow processing to full transparency, 2 of them were processed to theoretical density and moderate transparency. Samples were sintered to a closed pore state at temperatures as low as 1400 C.

After the relatively short sintering period, the component is placed in a hot isostatic press (HIP) and processed for 3 – 10 hours at ~ 30 kpsi(~200 MPa) at a temperature similar to that of the initial sintering. The applied isostatic pressure provides additional driving force for densification by substantially increasing the atomic diffusion coefficients, which promotes additional viscous flow at or near grain boundaries and intergranular pores. Using this method, transparent yttria nanomaterials were produced at lower temperatures, shorter total firing times, and without extra additives which tend to reduce the thermal conductivity.

Recently, a newer method has been developed by Mouzon, which relies on the methods of glass-encapsulation, combined with vacuum sintering at 1600 °C followed by hot isostatic pressing (HIP) at 1500 °C of a highly agglomerated commercial powder. The use of evacuated glass capsules to perform HIP treatment allowed samples that showed open porosity after vacuum sintering to be sintered to transparency. The sintering response of the investigated powder was studied by careful microstructural observations using scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy both in reflection and transmission. The key to this method is to keep porosity intergranular during pre-sintering, so that it can be removed subsequently by HIP treatment. It was found that agglomerates of closely packed particles are helpful to reach that purpose, since they densify fully and leave only intergranular porosity.

===Composites===
Prior to the work done at Raytheon, optical properties in nanocomposite ceramic materials had received little attention. Their studies clearly demonstrated near theoretical transmission in nanocomposite optical ceramics for the first time. The yttria/magnesia binary system is an ideal model system for nanocomposite formation. There is limited solid solubility in either one of the constituent phases, permitting a wide range of compositions to be investigated and compared to each other. According to the phase diagram, bi-phase mixtures are stable for all temperatures below ~ 2100 °C. In addition, neither yttria nor magnesia shows any absorption in the 3 – 5 μm mid-range IR portion of the EM spectrum.

In optical nanocomposites, two or more interpenetrating phases are mixed in a sub-micrometer grain sized, fully dense body. Infrared light scattering can be minimized (or even eliminated) in the material as long as the grain size of the individual phases is significantly smaller than infrared wavelengths. Experimental data suggests that limiting the grain size of the nanocomposite to approximately 1/15th of the wavelength of light is sufficient to limit scattering.

Nanocomposites of yttria and magnesia have been produced with a grain size of approximately 200 nm. These materials have yielded good transmission in the 3–5 μm range and strengths higher than that for single-phase individual constituents. Enhancement of mechanical properties in nanocomposite ceramic materials has been extensively studied. Significant increases in strength (2–5 times), toughness (1–4 times), and creep resistance have been observed in systems including SiC/Al2O3, SiC/Si3N4, SiC/MgO, and Al2O3/ZrO2.

The strengthening mechanisms observed vary depending on the material system, and there does not appear to be any general consensus regarding strengthening mechanisms, even within a given system. In the SiC/Al2O3 system, for example, it is widely known and accepted that the addition of SiC particles to the Al2O3 matrix results in a change of failure mechanism from intergranular (between grains) to intragranular (within grains) fracture. The explanations for improved strength include:

*A simple reduction of processing flaw concentration during nanocomposite fabrication.
*Reduction of the critical flaw size in the material—resulting in increased strength as predicted by the Hall-Petch relation)
*Crack deflection at nanophase particles due to residual thermal stresses introduced upon cooling form processing temperatures.
*Microcracking along stress-induced dislocations in the matrix material.

==Armor==
There is an increasing need in the military sector for high-strength, robust materials which have the capability to transmit light around the visible (0.4–0.7 micrometers) and mid-infrared (1–5 micrometers) regions of the spectrum. These materials are needed for applications requiring transparent armor. Transparent armor is a material or system of materials designed to be optically transparent, yet protect from fragmentation or ballistic impacts. The primary requirement for a transparent armor system is to not only defeat the designated threat but also provide a multi-hit capability with minimized distortion of surrounding areas. Transparent armor windows must also be compatible with night vision equipment. New materials that are thinner, lightweight, and offer better ballistic performance are being sought.

Existing transparent armor systems typically have many layers, separated by polymer (e.g. polycarbonate) interlayers. The polymer interlayer is used to mitigate the stresses from thermal expansion mismatches, as well as to stop crack propagation from ceramic to polymer. The polycarbonate is also currently used in applications such as visors, face shields and laser protection goggles. The search for lighter materials has also led to investigations into other polymeric materials such as transparent nylons, polyurethane, and acrylics. The optical properties and durability of transparent plastics limit their use in armor applications. Investigations carried out in the 1970s had shown promise for the use of polyurethane as armor material, but the optical properties were not adequate for transparent armor applications.

Several glasses are utilized in transparent armor, such as normal plate glass (soda-lime-silica), borosilicate glasses, and fused silica. Plate glass has been the most common glass used due to its low cost, but greater requirements for the optical properties and ballistic performance have generated the need for new materials. Chemical or thermal treatments can increase the strength of glasses, and the controlled crystallization of certain glass systems can produce transparent glass-ceramics. Alstom Grid Research &amp; Technology (Stafford, UK), produced a lithium disilicate based glass-ceramic known as TransArm, for use in transparent armor systems with continuous production yielding vehicle windscreen sized pieces (and larger). The inherent advantages of glasses and glass-ceramics include having lower cost than most other ceramic materials, the ability to be produced in curved shapes, and the ability to be formed into large sheets.

Transparent crystalline ceramics are used to defeat advanced threats. Three major transparent candidates currently exist: aluminum oxynitride (AlON), magnesium aluminate spinel (spinel), and single crystal aluminum oxide (sapphire). 

===Aluminium oxynitride spinel===
Aluminium oxynitride spinel (Al23O27N5), abbreviated as AlON, is one of the leading candidates for transparent armor. It is produced by the Surmet Corporation under the trademark ALON. The incorporation of nitrogen into aluminium oxide stabilizes a crystalline spinel phase, which due to its cubic crystal structure and unit cell, is an isotropic material which can be produced as transparent ceramic nanomaterial. Thus, fine-grained polycrystalline nanomaterials can be produced and formed into complex geometries using conventional ceramic forming techniques such as hot isostatic pressing, and slip casting.

The Surmet Corporation has acquired Raytheon&#x27;s ALON business and is currently building a market for this technology in the area of Transparent Armor, Sensor windows, Reconnaissance windows and IR Optics such as Lenses and Domes and as an alternative to quartz and sapphire in the semiconductor market. The AlON based transparent armor has been tested to stop multi-hit threats including of 30calAPM2 rounds and 50calAPM2 rounds successfully. The high hardness of AlON provides a scratch resistance which exceeds even the most durable coatings for glass scanner windows, such as those used in supermarkets. Surmet has successfully produced a 15&quot;x18&quot; curved AlON window and is currently attempting to scale up the technology and reduce the cost. In addition, the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force are both seeking development into next generation applications.

===Spinel===
Magnesium aluminate spinel (MgAl2O4) is a transparent ceramic with a cubic crystal structure with an excellent optical transmission from 0.2 to 5.5 micrometers in its polycrystalline form. Optical quality transparent spinel has been produced by sinter/HIP, hot pressing, and hot press/HIP operations, and it has been shown that the use of a hot isostatic press can improve its optical and physical properties.

Spinel offers some processing advantages over AlON, such as the fact that spinel powder is available from commercial manufacturers while AlON powders are proprietary to Raytheon. It is also capable of being processed at much lower temperatures than AlON and has been shown to possess superior optical properties within the infrared (IR) region. The improved optical characteristics make spinel attractive in sensor applications where effective communication is impacted by the protective missile dome&#x27;s absorption characteristics.

Spinel shows promise for many applications, but is currently not available in bulk form from any manufacturer, although efforts to commercialize spinel are underway. The spinel products business is being pursued by two key U.S. manufacturers: &quot;Technology Assessment and Transfer&quot; and the &quot;Surmet Corporation&quot;.

An extensive NRL review of the literature has indicated clearly that attempts to make high-quality spinel have failed to date because the densification dynamics of spinel are poorly understood. They have conducted extensive research into the dynamics involved during the densification of spinel. Their research has shown that LiF, although necessary, also has extremely adverse effects during the final stages of densification. Additionally, its distribution in the precursor spinel powders is of critical importance.

Traditional bulk mixing processes used to mix LiF sintering aid into a powder leave fairly inhomogeneous distribution of Lif that must be homogenized by extended heat treatment times at elevated temperatures. The homogenizing temperature for Lif/Spinel occurs at the temperature of fast reaction between the LiF and the Al2O3. In order to avoid this detrimental reaction, they have developed a new process that uniformly coats the spinel particles with the sintering aid. This allows them to reduce the amount of Lif necessary for densification and to rapidly heat through the temperature of maximum reactivity. These developments have allowed NRL to fabricate MgAl2O4 spinel to high transparency with extremely high reproducibility that should enable military as well as commercial use of spinel.

===Sapphire===
Single-crystal aluminum oxide (sapphire – Al2O3) is a transparent ceramic. Sapphire&#x27;s crystal structure is rhombohedral and thus its properties are anisotropic, varying with crystallographic orientation. Transparent alumina is currently one of the most mature transparent ceramics from a production and application perspective, and is available from several manufacturers. But the cost is high due to the processing temperature involved, as well as machining costs to cut parts out of single crystal boules. It also has a very high mechanical strength – but that is dependent on the surface finish.

The high level of maturity of sapphire from a production and application standpoint can be attributed to two areas of business: electromagnetic spectrum windows for missiles and domes, and electronic/semiconductor industries and applications.

There are current programs to scale-up sapphire grown by the heat exchanger method or edge defined film-fed growth (EFG) processes. Its maturity stems from its use as windows and in semiconductor industry. Crystal Systems Inc. which uses single crystal growth techniques, is currently scaling their sapphire boules to diameter and larger. Another producer, the Saint-Gobain Group produces transparent sapphire using an edge-defined growth technique. Sapphire grown by this technique produces an optically inferior material to that which is grown via single crystal techniques, but is much less expensive, and retains much of the hardness, transmission, and scratch-resistant characteristics. Saint-Gobain is currently capable of producing 0.43&quot; thick (as grown) sapphire, in 12&quot; × 18.5&quot; sheets, as well as thick, single-curved sheets. The U.S. Army Research Laboratory is currently investigating use of this material in a laminate design for transparent armor systems. The Saint Gobain Group have commercialized the capability to meet flight requirements on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and F-22 Raptor next generation fighter aircraft.

===Composites===
Future high-speed infrared-guided missiles will require new dome materials that are substantially more durable than those in use today, while retaining maximum transparency across the entire operational spectrum or bandwidth. A long-standing compromise exists between optical bandpass and mechanical durability within the current group of single-phase (crystalline or glassy) IR transmitting ceramic materials, forcing missile designers to accept substandard overall system performance. Optical nanocomposites may provide the opportunity to engineer new materials that may overcome these traditional limitations.

For example, transparent ceramic armor consisting of a lightweight composite has been formed by utilizing a face plate of transparent alumina Al2O3 (or magnesia MgO) with a back-up plate of transparent plastic. The two plates (bonded together with a transparent adhesive) afford complete ballistic protection against 0.30 AP M2 projectiles at 0° obliquity with a muzzle velocity of per second.
Another transparent composite armor provided complete protection for small arms projectiles up to and including caliber .50 AP M2 projectiles consisting of two or more layers of transparent ceramic material.

Nanocomposites of yttria and magnesia have been produced with an average grain size of ~200 nm. These materials have exhibited near theoretical transmission in the 3 – 5 μm IR band. Additionally, such composites have yielded higher strengths than those observed for single phase solid-state components. Despite a lack of agreement regarding mechanism of failure, it is widely accepted that nanocomposite ceramic materials can and do offer improved mechanical properties over those of single phase materials or nanomaterials of uniform chemical composition.

Nanocomposite ceramic materials also offer interesting mechanical properties not achievable in other materials, such as superplastic flow and metal-like machinability. It is anticipated that further development will result in high strength, high transparency nanomaterials which are suitable for application as next generation armor.

<text>The Ohio Republican Party is the Ohio affiliate of the Republican Party. It was founded in Columbus, Ohio, in 1854. 

It currently holds the bulk of the state&#x27;s political power, controlling the majority of Ohio&#x27;s U.S. House seats, both of its U.S. Senate seats, the governorship, supermajorities in both houses of the state legislature, and a majority on the Ohio Supreme Court.

==History==

After the Civil War, Ohio politics was dominated by the Republican Party, and Ohio Republicans also played key roles in the national party. As the national Republican Party changed from a party affiliated with Northern states into a staunchly conservative party, so did the Ohio Republican Party.

===Early years===



Early Ohio Republicans such as Salmon P. Chase staffed many important national offices. Chase coined the phrase &quot;Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men&quot;. Starting in the 1880s, Ohio&#x27;s Mark Hanna was a significant power in the back rooms of the national Republican party. In the 1890s, Hanna led the conservative wing of the party against Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s progressive movement.

In the 60 years from 1860 to 1920, Ohioans headed the Republican presidential ticket nine times, losing only twice. In 1912, Democrat Woodrow Wilson won with 40.96 percent of the vote, the Republican ticket was split, with Theodore Roosevelt leaving to start the Bull-Moose Party. In the 1916 election, Wilson won again with 49.24 percent of the vote.

During the next three presidential elections, the Republican candidate won Ohio, until 1932 when Franklin D. Roosevelt won the state. FDR would win Ohio in 1932, 1936, and 1940.

===Post New Deal===
The national political upheaval that ushered in the New Deal era in the 1930s benefited the Ohio Democratic Party. Party politics in Ohio became very competitive, with Republicans and Democrats trading victories at all levels.

During this time Robert A. Taft, known as &quot;Mr. Republican,&quot; became the leader of the conservative wing of the Republican party during a time when progressives controlled both major parties, and one of the most popular Senators in Ohio history.

From the 1930s to the 1970s, Republicans still won the majority of elective offices in Ohio. Starting in the 1960s Ohio Democrats began to win more elections with rulings from the United States Supreme Court that required district representation be based on population and not land sized. The equalization of legislative districts shifted power to Ohio&#x27;s cities and away from rural farmers. By the mid-1980s, Ohio government at all levels was dominated by Democrats.

By 1990, the Republicans had won a majority on the Ohio Apportionment Board, which draws district lines for federal and state legislative seats. The 1992 adoption of term limits by referendum further strengthened the party&#x27;s hand and 1992 marked the last victory by a Democrat (John Glenn) in a statewide race until 2006.

===State of the party===
Redistricting after the 2000 census combined with Ohio&#x27;s term limits laws had Republican officeholders at the federal and state levels struggling with each other to draw federal congressional districts to create safe seats, with the interests of incumbent US representatives clashing with the interests of state legislators facing term limits looking to Congress for their next jobs. About 43 percent of the voters voted for Democrats in 2000.

Joe Hallett wrote in the &quot;Columbus Dispatch&quot; (January 13, 2002):

Redistricting should be a happy process for Republicans... But the task has hardly been gleeful. Contrarily, it has turned into an embarrassment for Republicans... Eight-year term limits, more than the state budget, are to blame. These days, state lawmakers constantly are scouting their next jobs... [V]isions of Congress dance in their heads. They want districts ready-made for their ascensions. Meanwhile, congressional incumbents constantly angle for districts they can&#x27;t possibly lose.

Although term limits were pushed by conservative Republican activists in the 1980s, they forced the retirement of Republican Speaker Jo Ann Davidson (R-Columbus) from the House of Representatives in 2001 as well as the leader of the conservative wing of the party, Deputy Speaker William G. Batchelder (R-Medina).

In 2001, Republicans sought United States House of Representatives seats held by Democrats Sherrod Brown and Ted Strickland. The state legislature considered redrawing their districts. Critics allege the motivation was to aid in Republican victories. When Democrat Brown threatened to run for governor in 2002, if he lost his seat through redistricting, the legislature scrapped redistricting plans. Republican Governor Taft won re-election. Taft was challenged by Cuyahoga County commissioner Tim Hagan. Both Brown and Strickland held onto their congressional seats.

By 2004, Republicans held all six statewide executive offices (governor/lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state, auditor, and treasurer), a two-thirds majority in the state senate and house, a 5–2 majority on the Supreme Court, both seats in the US Senate, and 12 of Ohio&#x27;s 18 seats in the US House of Representatives. In 2006, Democrats began to retake some statewide offices. These include all of the executive offices except State Auditor (including the governorship going to Ted Strickland over Republican challenger J. Kenneth Blackwell) and one of the seats in the US Senate (Sherrod Brown defeating incumbent Mike DeWine).

Ohio Republicans still held ten seats in the US House of Representatives, one seat in the U.S. Senate, and a majority in both houses of the Ohio General Assembly. Between the election of Robert Cupp in 2007, the death of Chief Justice Thomas Moyer, and the appointment of Democrat Eric Brown in 2010, Republicans had controlled all seven seats on the Ohio Supreme Court previously.

In 2008, Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama defeated Republican John McCain in Ohio.

In 2010, Republicans regained all of the statewide elected executive offices, including the governorship with the election of John Kasich, and regained the majority in the state House of Representatives and retaining the state Senate. Republicans also retained their seat in the U.S. Senate with the election of Rob Portman and retained a majority of the seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. In addition, 8th District Representative John Boehner was elected Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, making him third in line of succession (and the highest ranking Republican) to the Presidency of the United States.

In November 2011, Gov. John Kasich&#x27;s law that limits public worker&#x27;s union bargain abilities was voted down by the people of Ohio. This was a major blow to the platform that Gov. Kasich ran on in 2010.

=== Pro-Donald Trump turn ===
In 2017, Donald Trump helped to install Jane Timken as head of the Ohio Republican Party. When she left to run for the Senate, the Ohio Republican Party replaced her with former Trump Ohio campaign manager Bob Paduchik.

In 2021, the Ohio Republican Party called on Republican House Representative Anthony Gonzalez to resign after he voted to impeach former President Donald Trump for his role in inciting a pro-Trump mob to storm the U.S. Capitol. The party also voted to censure Gonzalez. The Cincinnati Enquirer wrote that the Ohio Republican Party &quot;has increasingly become the party of Trump.&quot;

On December 1, 2023, the Ohio Republican Party became the first state Republican Party to endorse Donald Trump for president in 2024. The Cincinnati Enquirer wrote that the endorsement was &quot;a rare move that underscores the former president&#x27;s grip on state GOP officials.&quot;

==Taft family political power==
The Taft family has been one of the most powerful political families in American history. Robert Taft, Sr. was the first Taft to come to America, around the 1670s. The Ohio section of Taft&#x27;s are descendants of Robert, Sr.

The start of the five generations of Taft&#x27;s in politics was with Alphonso Taft. He was the founder of the Ohio political dynasty that is associated with the Republican Party. Alphonso was in President Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s Cabinet, first as Attorney General then as Secretary of War. He was later appointed US Ambassador to the Austria-Hungary Empire.

Three of Alphonso&#x27;s sons entered into politics also, former US Representative of Ohio&#x27;s 1st District Charles Phelps Taft, former US president and Chief Justice of the United States William Howard Taft, and former Republican Party Delegate Henry Waters Taft.

Both of William H. Taft&#x27;s sons entered into politics. Robert A. Taft was a former US Senator and his other son Charles Phelps Taft II was former Mayor of Cincinnati. Both men were seen as great politicians.

The next generation of Taft politicians came from two of Robert&#x27;s children. Robert Taft, Jr. served in both houses of the US Congress. His brother William Howard Taft III was Ambassador to Ireland.

The current generation of Tafts in politics are former Ohio Governor Bob Taft, son of Robert Taft Jr. William Howard Taft IV, son of William H. Taft III, has been an Ambassador to NATO and United States Deputy Secretary of Defense.

==Controversies==

In 2005, the Republican fundraiser and coin dealer Thomas Noe ran a rare coin fund that the State of Ohio had invested $50 million in. Soon valuable coins came up missing and an investigation discovered Noe had taken around $13 million from the fund. He was convicted in 2006 and was sentenced to 18 years in state prison.

Noe was a top fundraiser for the George W. Bush campaign in Ohio in 2004, and the chairman for his campaign in Northwest Ohio. He was later convicted of making illegal contributions to the Bush campaign.

Noe had ties to then Governor Bob Taft. It was discovered through this scandal that the Governor and some of his top aides took improper gifts from Noe and other lobbyist. In 2005, Gov. Taft was charged with four misdemeanors related to these gifts.

This scandal had a negative effect on the Ohio Republican Party, who lost many seats in Congress after 2006 and the Governorship went to Ted Strickland. In 2008, Barack Obama won Ohio&#x27;s 20 electoral college votes on his way to the presidency.

<text>Abia is a state in the Southeastern region of Nigeria. The state&#x27;s capital is Umuahia and its most populous city is Aba.

Abia is bordered the west by Imo, east by Cross River, south by Rivers, northwest by Anambra and northeast by Enugu and Ebonyi. The state is divided between the Niger Delta swamp forests in the south and the Cross–Niger transition forests. The Imo and Aba Rivers flows along the state&#x27;s western and southern borders respectively. The land for agriculture as well as the production of crude oil and natural gas ranks Abia as the joint-eighth highest Human Development Index in Nigeria since 2019.

Abia&#x27;s history begins as part of the Aro Confederacy until their defeat in the early 1900s by the British troops during the Anglo-Aro War. After the war, the area was incorporated into the Southern Nigeria Protectorate. After Nigeria&#x27;s independence in 1960, Abia became part of the post-independence Eastern Region until 1967 before the region was split, and it became part of the East Central State. The Eastern Region attempted to secede in Nigerian Civil War with Abia as part of the secessionist state of Biafra. After the war and the then reunification of Nigeria, the East Central State was merged until 1976 when Imo including Abia, was formed by Murtala Muhammed. Eastern Imo would later become the old Abia State after a split. In 1996, part of Abia&#x27;s northeast was removed to form a part of the new Ebonyi.

Abia&#x27;s state legislature is the Abia State House of Assembly. The governors are to serve four years.

== History ==
Abia is one of the 36 states in Nigeria, and has about seventeen Local Government Areas, out of the 774 Local Government Areas that make up the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Abia State was created on 27 August 1991, during the government of General Ibrahim Babangida. The State is located in the south-eastern part of Nigeria. Abia state was created out of Imo State, and the two sister states share boundaries. Abia State is known as one of the constituent states of the Niger Delta region. The state has its capital at Umuahia while the commercial city of the state is Aba. Abia State is also referred to as &quot;God&#x27;s own state&quot;. The name &quot;Abia&quot; is an abbreviation of four of Abia state&#x27;s densely populated regions Aba, Bende, Isuikwuato, and Afikpo.

The Igbo people, who are one of the indigenous peoples of the South-eastern part of Nigeria, make up 95% of the population. Their traditional language, Igbo, is in widespread use. Ibibio is spoken as a minority language, especially in Arochukwu English is also widely spoken and serves as the official language in governance and business. In Abia State over 3 million people are mainly Christians. According to there are 689,668 Catholics (2020) in the Umuahia Diocese (1958) with 70 parishes under Bishop Michael Kalu Ukpong (2022) and Aba Diocese (1990) with 90 parishes under Bishop Augustine Ndubueze Echema (2019), both suffragans of Archdiocese of Owerri.

== Geography ==
Abia State occupies about 4902 square kilometres. It is bounded on the north and northeast by the states of Enugu for about 25 km, and Ebonyi for 70 km (43 miles), Cross River State for about 52 km (partly across Cross River) and Akwa Ibom State for 151 km (94 miles) to the east and southeast respectively, Rivers State to the south and west for 87 km (54 miles), Imo State and Anambra to the west for to the west in the vicinity of the Imo River) for about 18 km and about 104 km respectively. The southernmost part of the State lies within the Niger Delta Swamp Forests, while the rest of the state, lies within the Cross–Niger transition forests. The southern portion gets heavy rainfall of about per year and it is intense between the months of April through October. The most important rivers in Abia State are the Imo and Aba Rivers which flow into the Atlantic Ocean through Akwa Ibom State.

=== Environmental Issues ===

==== Solid waste ====
Municipal solid waste management (MSWM) deals with the collection, storing, treatment and disposal of solid waste, to ensure that it does not affect humans, living things and the environment at large. There are factors that influence Municipal solid waste generation such as income level, local climatic condition, urbanization and economic development. MSW in Aba, Abia State is classified into;

# Domestic waste (waste from households, food centers, markets, and commercial premises)
# Industrial waste (excluding toxic waste that requires special handling)
# Institutional waste (waste from government establishments, schools, hospitals and recreational facilities
In recent times, it was reported that Aba and Umuahia generate up to two hundred and seventy truckloads of domestic and commercial waste daily. This information was made known to the public by Governor Alex Otti during his inauguration speech after taking the baton of government from the former governor, Okezie Ikpeazu.

== Demographics ==
=== Climate ===
Aba experiences a warm and gloomy wet season as well as a scorching and oppressive dry season. The temperature rarely drops below or rises over throughout the entire year, fluctuating between .

The beach/pool score indicates that the best time of year to visit Aba for hot-weather activities is from late November to early February.

In Aba, the rainy season is warm and cloudy, the dry season is hot and largely gloomy, and the climate is uncomfortable all year long. The average annual temperature ranges from 68 °F to 88 °F, with occasional exceptions when it falls below 61 °F or rises over 91 °F.

Since Aba experiences so small seasonal temperature variations, talking about the hot and cold seasons isn&#x27;t very helpful.

===Religion ===

The residents of Abia state are predominantly Christians.

Churches
Umuahia Catholic Diocese (1958) with 70 parishes is under Bishop Michael Kalu Ukpong (2022) and Aba Diocese (1990) with 90 parishes under Bishop Augustine Ndubueze Echema (2019) , both suffragans of Owerri Archdiocese.

== Economy ==
Crude oil and gas production is a prominent activity, as it contributes over 39% of the State&#x27;s GDP. However, the indigenous oil companies – through the Marginal Fields Programme (MFP) – have not found it easy to attract the requisite funding and infrastructural capacity, to explore some of the marginal oil fields which are about 50 in the State.

The manufacturing sector only accounts for 2% of the GDP. The industrial centre of the state is in Aba, with textile manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, soap, plastics, cement, footwear, and cosmetics. In addition to the above, Abia State Government has just built a 9,000 capacity multipurpose International Conference Centre in Umuahia. This edifice of international standard was built by Governor T.A Orji, to enhance tourism as well as boost the state economy, through hosting of major International and Local events.

Representing 27% of the GDP, agriculture – which employs 70% of the state workforce – is the second economic sector of Abia. With its adequate seasonal rainfall, Abia has much arable land that produces yams, maize, potatoes, rice, cashews, plantains, taro, and cassava. Oil palm is the most important cash crop.

=== Oil and gas exploration ===
There are over 100 oil wells and 3 installed flow stations in Abia State. There is also an associated gas plant, Abia/NNPC gas plant. As of 2012, boundary Commission said it returned 42 oil wells from neighbouring Rivers State to Abia. This would have meant Abia was r fourth largest oil-producing state in the country. Oil giant, Shell, holds most of the licenses for the wells in the State, and has concentrated on the estimated 50 wells that are considered high-yield.

The state produced 36,000 barrels of crude oil per day; &quot;Imoturu produces 23,000 barrels per day and Isimili flow station produces over 8,000 barrels of crude oil per day. Then four oil wells in Izaku go to Obigo flow station. About 30 oil wells from my village go to Umuri, and about eight oil wells from Umurie go to Afam&quot;, said Samuel Okezie Nwogu, Chairman of Abia State Oil Producing Development Area Commission (ASOPADEC). However, the State has complained of poor funding from its oil revenue federal allocation.

==Education==

Abia&#x27;s educational system consistently ranks in the top five states on the Nigeria Board of Education, with students outperforming the average in all subject areas and class tests.

== Politics ==
The State Government is led by a democratically elected Governor who works closely with members of the state&#x27;s House of Assembly. The capital city of the state is Umuahia. and there are 17 local government areas in the state.
At statehood in 1991, Abia was ruled by Ibrahim Babangida-appointed Military Administrator Frank Ajobena before Ogbonnaya Onu was elected governor later that year under the Third Nigerian Republic. Onu governed for nearly two years before Sani Abacha ended the Third Republic and reinstated full military rule. Under the Abacha regime, three more Military Administrators (Chinyere Ike Nwosu, Temi Ejoor, and Moses Fasanya) were appointed before Abacha&#x27;s death and the accession of Abdulsalami Abubakar. Abubakar appointed one more Military Administrator, Anthony Obi, before starting the transition to democracy in 1998.

In 1999, Nigeria returned to democracy, and Orji Uzor Kalu was elected governor on the platform of the People&#x27;s Democratic Party. Consequently, he was sworn in on 29 May 1999. In 2003, when it was time for fresh elections, Kalu re-contested on the platform of the PDP and got a second mandate to govern (the Constitution of Nigeria limits Governors to two terms in office). At the end of Kalu&#x27;s term in 2007, Theodore Orji (PPA) defeated Onyema Ugochukwu (PDP) in the 2007 gubernatorial election, to become Abia&#x27;s next Governor. In 2011, Theodore Orji defected from the PPA to the PDP before being re-elected for another four-year term later that year.

In 2015, Okezie Ikpeazu (PDP) was voted in as the ninth Governor of Abia State.

<text>Francis William Kellogg (May 30, 1810 – January 13, 1879) was a U.S. Representative from the states of Michigan, during the Civil War, and Alabama, during Reconstruction.

==Biography==
Kellogg was born in Worthington, Massachusetts and attended the common schools. He moved to Columbus, Ohio, in 1833 and then to Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1855 where he engaged in the lumber business with the firm Kellogg, White &amp; Co. at Kelloggville (which was named after him) in Kent County, Michigan. He was a member of the Michigan State House of Representatives, where he represented the Kent County 2nd district, from 1857 to 1858.

Kellogg was elected from Michigan as a Republican to United States House of Representatives for the 36th, 37th, and 38th Congresses, serving from March 4, 1859 to March 3, 1865. He represented Michigan&#x27;s 3rd congressional district for his first two terms, then the 4th district after a redistricting. In all three contests, he defeated the former mayor of Grand Rapids, Thomas B. Church, in the general election. During the American Civil War, he organized the Second, Third, and Sixth Cavalry Regiments by the authority of the United States Department of War. He was appointed as the colonel of the Third Michigan Cavalry.

During Reconstruction, he was appointed by U.S. President Andrew Johnson as collector of internal revenue for the southern district of Alabama on April 30, 1866, and served until July 1868, residing in Mobile, Alabama.

Upon the re-admission of Alabama to the Union, Kellogg was elected to a partial term in Alabama&#x27;s 1st congressional district to the 40th Congress, serving from July 22, 1868, to March 3, 1869. He was succeeded by fellow Republican Alfred Buck. Kellogg then moved to New York City and later to Alliance, Ohio, where he died. He is interred in Fulton Street Cemetery in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

<text>Daniel Francis Fouts (born June 10, 1951) is an American former professional football quarterback who played for the San Diego Chargers of the National Football League (NFL) throughout his 15-season career (1973–1987). After a relatively undistinguished first five seasons in the league, Fouts came to prominence as an on-field leader during the Chargers&#x27; Air Coryell period. He led the league in passing yards every year from 1979 to 1982, throwing for over 4,000 yards in the first three of these—no quarterback had previously posted consecutive 4,000-yard seasons. Fouts was voted a Pro Bowler six times, first-team All-Pro twice, and in 1982 he was the Offensive Player of the Year. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1993, his first year of eligibility.

Fouts played college football for the Oregon Ducks, where he broke numerous records, and was later inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame and the University of Oregon Hall of Fame. He was a third-round draft pick by the Chargers in 1973. Fouts struggled during his first three seasons in the league. His form began to improve in 1976, but he was discontented over the direction of the team and the restrictions of the NFL&#x27;s free agency rules so he refused to play during the majority of the 1977 season.

Early in 1978, Don Coryell became the head coach of the Chargers and he instituted the pass-oriented &quot;Air Coryell&quot; offensive scheme, allowing Fouts to throw the ball with unprecedented frequency. He led the NFL in passing yards for four straight years from 1979 to 1982 (still a consecutive-years record), and he became the first player in league history to throw for 4,000 yards in three straight seasons, breaking the NFL single-season record for passing yards each time. Fouts&#x27; performance was rewarded by six Pro Bowl selections (1979–1983 &amp; 1985) and four All-Pro selections (first team in 1979 and 1982, second team in 1980 and 1985). In the strike-shortened 1982 season, he passed for 2,883 yards in only nine games, winning the Associated Press (AP) Offensive Player of the Year and Pro Football Writers Association (PFWA) NFL Most Valuable Player honors.

Fouts led the Chargers to three consecutive AFC West division titles – 1979, 1980 and 1981 – and a playoff appearance in 1982. He was the winning quarterback of the Epic in Miami, when he broke the league playoff single-game record by passing for 433 yards. The Chargers advanced to the AFC Championship Game twice during his career, but never reached the Super Bowl. Fouts was the first quarterback to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame without appearing in either the Super Bowl or an NFL championship game.

After retiring from the league, Fouts was a color analyst for NFL games on CBS television and Westwood One radio. He is the son of Bay Area Radio Hall of Famer Bob Fouts.

== Early life ==
Dan Fouts was born in San Francisco on June 10, 1951, to Julie and Bob Fouts, the fourth of five children. His father was a sports broadcaster who commentated for the San Francisco 49ers in the NFL for over 20 years. As a child, Dan acted as a stats-keeper for Bob and worked for the 49ers as a ballboy. One of his first sports heroes was John Brodie, the 49ers&#x27; starting quarterback at that time. At the age of 11, when Fouts asked his parents&#x27; permission to play football, they told him that he would have to be a quarterback, as he had shown a good throwing arm while playing Little League baseball. He played Pop Warner football for the Drake Junior Pirates, where his coach described him as an &quot;outstanding quarterback&quot; in 1964.

Fouts attended Marin Catholic High School, located just north of San Francisco in Kentfield, California, for his first two years of high school football and had his first starts as a sophomore in 1966. He temporarily lost his starting position after his play was described as &quot;extremely jittery&quot; by the local &quot;San Rafael Daily Independent Journal&quot;, but an end of season report from the same paper stated that he should improve with better protection. The team had a record of 0–6 and Fouts finished the season with nine interceptions and only one touchdown. While at Marin Catholic, he also played varsity basketball as a forward.

Fouts transferred to St. Ignatius College Preparatory, also in San Francisco, for his final two years of high school. Explaining the switch to St. Ignatius in 2013, he said, &quot;My dad told me &#x27;You&#x27;re not going to get a scholarship at Marin Catholic; you&#x27;re going to get it at St. Ignatius. In 1967, Fouts&#x27; junior year, St. Ignatius was the champion of the West Catholic Athletic League with a 6–0 record, and Fouts was named to the WCAL All-Star first-team. He nearly reversed his touchdown to interceptions ratio, with 16 touchdowns and two interceptions. St. Ignatius went 5–1 in Fouts&#x27; senior year but he passed much less as his team focused more on their running game.

== College career ==
Fouts was not a highly sought recruit when he accepted a scholarship offer from the University of Oregon to play for the Ducks in Eugene. It was the only offer from a major college that he received. Fouts did not play for the main Ducks team during his first year at Oregon (1969); instead he started for the freshman team, composed of first-year players.

In the 1970 season, he began as a backup to established passer Tom Blanchard. In the opening game, a 31–24 victory over California, Fouts came off the bench and threw for 166 yards and two touchdowns, including the game-winner in the final two minutes; Fouts and Blanchard combined to set a new Pacific-8 Conference (Pac-8) record with 424 passing yards that day. Fouts got his first chance to start two weeks later when Blanchard was out due to injury. He kept the role for the rest of the season and the Ducks finished 6–4–1. Fouts went on to set Oregon single-game records for the most attempts, completions and yards, and single-season records for completions and touchdowns. His 16 touchdowns ranked second in the Pac-8, while his 212.1 yards of total offense per game were tenth in the nation. United Press International (UPI) named him as an honorable mention in their season-ending all-coast team. The &quot;Salem Capital Journal&quot; described Fouts as a sophomore with &quot;the poise of a senior&quot;.

Fouts entered the 1971 season as an established and highly rated starter. He missed two and a half games of the Ducks&#x27; 5–6 season due to knee ligament damage, but he still ranked third in the Pac-8 for passing yards. When Oregon replaced their head coach Jerry Frei at the end of the year, Fouts was one of seven players on the committee of fifteen who chose the replacement, Dick Enright.

Fouts broke the Oregon record for career passing yardage early in the 1972 season, which ended with a 4–7 record. In his last game as a Duck he threw a 65-yard touchdown pass and Oregon beat Oregon State for the first time in nine years. At the end of the season, Fouts ranked second in the Pac-8 for passing yards and touchdowns behind Mike Boryla of Stanford. The &quot;Capital Journal&quot; compared the two quarterbacks, stating that Fouts faced &quot;trying conditions&quot; with a relative lack of support on offense. He was named to the All-Pac-8 team as chosen by the conference&#x27;s coaches, as well as the UPI All-Coast team and the Associated Press (AP) All-West Coast team. Fouts was invited to the East–West Shrine Bowl (which he missed due to a foot injury), the Senior Bowl, and the Coaches All-America Game (where he broke his collarbone on his first play from scrimmage).

At the time of his graduation, Fouts&#x27; career passing yardage ranked No.1 in Oregon history, No. 2 in the Pac-8 and No. 7 in the NCAA. He set 19 Oregon records, including career passing yardage (5,995) and total offense (5,871), and he was inducted into the university&#x27;s hall of fame as part of the inaugural 1992 class.

=== 1973–1978: Early career ===

==== 1973 season ====
Fouts was selected in the third round of the 1973 NFL draft by the San Diego Chargers; he was the sixth quarterback taken in the draft and the 64th selection overall. At the time he was drafted, NFL scouts questioned Fouts&#x27; durability, arm strength and athleticism. He was brought in to back up one of his childhood idols, Johnny Unitas, who had joined the Chargers during the off-season after 17 years with the Baltimore Colts. Fouts broke his collarbone in the Coaches All-America Game after he was drafted; the Chargers management had not wanted him to play in the game because of the risk of injury. Fouts missed the start of training camp while holding out for more money, then missed the first three preseason games while recovering from his injury. Head coach Harland Svare described Fouts as &quot;about a year behind&quot; in August, and Fouts himself did not anticipate much play as a rookie.

Early in the 1973 season, Unitas sustained a career-ending shoulder injury which caused Fouts to see far more play than expected. His first appearance came in week 4 when he entered a game at Pittsburgh at the start of the second half with the Chargers trailing 38–0. Fouts threw his first career touchdown in the 4th quarter (a 13-yarder to Jerry LeVias), led two further touchdown drives, and the game finished 38–21. He made his first start the following week, throwing two further touchdowns in a 27–17 loss to the Oakland Raiders. &quot;United Press International&quot; described his performance as that of a &quot;bona fide NFL quarterback.&quot; He struggled in his next game, where he was intercepted four times during a 41–0 home loss to Atlanta, with the &quot;Associated Press&quot; reporting that he &quot;frequently threw off balance and into a crowd of defenders.&quot;

Fouts finished the season ranked 12th by passer rating in the 13-team American Football Conference (AFC). He was benched in favor of Wayne Clark for four weeks late in the season as the Chargers struggled to a 2–11–1 record. Speaking in 1985, Fouts described the 1973 Chargers as a team in &quot;turmoil, total disarray&quot;, and criticized the coaches for not letting him work with Unitas and benefit from his knowledge.

==== 1974 season ====
Unitas announced his retirement before the 1974 season, leaving Fouts to compete with rookie Jesse Freitas for the starting job. New head coach Tommy Prothro singled out Fouts as giving the only good performance during a preseason loss, and he began the regular season as the starter.

San Diego lost their first regular season game, but Fouts got his first career win in week 2, leading a 98-yard 4th quarter drive for the winning touchdown. The Chargers lost their next five games, culminating in a 24–14 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in which Fouts threw two interceptions and lost a fumble, prompting his home fans to start chanting for Freitas to play. In the same game, Fouts argued with wide receiver Harrison Davis, who he felt did not try hard enough to prevent an interception of an underthrown ball. Davis commented to the media, &quot;Not much I could do about it... Fouts can yell, that&#x27;s his privilege, but it was a bad pass.&quot; Fouts said, &quot;He&#x27;s got to fight for the ball. That&#x27;s gold out there.&quot; He threw four touchdowns the following week and continued to start until week 11, when a broken thumb ended his season.

Fouts ranked 11th in the AFC for passer rating. Freitas started the final three games and contributed two of the Chargers&#x27; five wins on the season; Prothro declined to comment when asked about his future intentions with regard to Fouts and Freitas, except to say that he had no plans to draft another quarterback.

==== 1975 season ====

Fouts and Freitas continued to vie for the starting position entering the 1975 season. Both struggled in preseason, and the Chargers added veteran quarterback Virgil Carter to their roster. All three quarterbacks played in the regular season opener against the Pittsburgh Steelers, generating only 145 yards of offense in a 37–0 defeat. Two weeks later, Fouts was the only quarterback Prothro used against the Oakland Raiders. His home crowd booed him when he was announced before kickoff and he completed 3 of 13 passes for 29 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions, while getting sacked five times for the loss of 51 yards. The Chargers lost 6–0. San Diego went on to lose their first eleven games while Fouts missed playing time with a sore ankle and a concussion. He sustained a total of seven injuries during the course of the year. The Chargers avoided a winless season when Fouts led them to a pair of victories in December.

With only two touchdown passes all season, Fouts finished with the 12th best passer rating in the AFC. Through his first three seasons in the league, Fouts had thrown 16 touchdowns and 36 interceptions while completing less than half his passes. The following year, he said the Chargers had been running a &quot;very basic, antiquated offense&quot; in 1974 and 1975. Reflecting on his first three seasons in a 1983 interview, he added, &quot;We really didn&#x27;t have an offensive coordinator or quarterback coach, so I had to fall back on what I&#x27;d learned from John Robinson, my offensive coordinator at Oregon.&quot;

==== 1976 season ====

Starting in February 1976, Fouts worked out three times a week with Bill Walsh, who spent that year as the Chargers&#x27; offensive coordinator. Fouts would later describe the sessions: &quot;He showed me how to set up, how to hold the ball, where to throw and why. That&#x27;s a large part of my success.&quot; He also praised Walsh for introducing a more complex offensive system.

Fouts and the Chargers began the 1976 season in good form; they reached a 3–0 record with a 43–24 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals where Fouts threw four touchdown passes. Fouts was the league&#x27;s No. 1 rated passer at that stage, though the defenses he had faced were not highly regarded. His performances worsened as the season went on, and fans were calling for backup Clint Longley to have more playing time entering the week 10 game with the Denver Broncos. Fouts was again booed by his home crowd in the Broncos game, a 17–0 defeat. Longley did start one game late in the season, but was benched for Fouts after failing to produce any points in the first half. The Chargers eventually finished with a 6–8 record.

Fouts finished with the eighth-best passer rating in the AFC, and led the conference in both pass attempts (359) and completions (208). San Diego sports journalist Jack Murphy described 1976 as a year of &quot;much growth&quot; for Fouts, and the departing Walsh predicted that he would have a fine career in the league.

==== 1977 season: 125-day holdout ====
San Diego acquired quarterback James Harris from the Los Angeles Rams during the off-season, with head coach Tommy Prothro stating that he wanted depth at the injury-prone position. There was speculation in the media that Harris&#x27; contract was worth approximately $170,000, compared to Fouts&#x27; $82,500. The following month, Fouts was one of 17 players who testified against the NFL in an antitrust settlement. Fouts expressed a desire to leave San Diego, and complained about the new collective bargaining agreement which said that the Chargers had to only match the offer of another team to prevent him from leaving. Fouts was reportedly annoyed by Harris&#x27;s acquisition by the Chargers, and by the size of Harris&#x27;s contract, but Fouts himself said that he wanted to play in a Super Bowl, and that the Chargers were not of that caliber. He stated that he would retire if he was not allowed to leave San Diego. He also attacked Prothro as &quot;the farthest thing from a head coach you&#x27;ll ever find... he&#x27;s snowing people into thinking he knows what he&#x27;s doing.&quot;

Fouts refused to report to training camp in July and was placed on the reserve list by the Chargers the following month; Harris became the new starting quarterback. Owner Gene Klein stated publicly that he would not trade Fouts, and that he would not play in the NFL again if he refused to turn out for San Diego. Fouts filed a grievance against the Chargers in October, seeking to be granted free agent status by the NFL. On November 15, the NFL grievance committee rejected Fouts&#x27; attempt to become a free agent. Klein said that Fouts had been given bad advice by his lawyer, and would be welcomed back to the team. Fouts reported to the Chargers on November 17, 125 days late, having accrued $62,500 in fines. He declined to comment on his holdout to the press. Chargers player representative Pat Curran stated that the team welcomed Fouts back, suggesting that his criticisms of Prothro and the quality of his teammates were a &quot;smoke-screen&quot; to support his attempt to become a free agent.

The 1977 Chargers were a 5–5 team when Fouts returned, and they had recently lost Harris to injury. Fouts won praise from Prothro when he won his first two games back, and described the team as the best of his Chargers career. He lost the next two games, struggling in both. The &quot;Escondido Times Advocate&quot; said of the finale that Fouts was &quot;his vintage horrid self of all his bad games of the past.&quot;

==== 1978 season ====

Fouts signed a new five-year contract with the Chargers during the off-season, and was selected as the starter ahead of Harris. He sustained a jammed thumb early in the 1978 season and did not start in week 4 against the Green Bay Packers, instead coming off the bench and throwing two of the Chargers&#x27; five interceptions in a 24–3 defeat.

Prothro resigned after the Green Bay defeat with the team&#x27;s record at 1–3; his replacement, Don Coryell, would be a key figure in Fouts&#x27; career. Coryell was an offensive-minded coach who favored the passing game. He later wrote of Fouts, &quot;The first few times I saw him throw the ball, I knew that he would be our quarterback, and that he would be a great one.&quot; Recalling Coryell&#x27;s first team talk, Fouts said, &quot;I went home that day, and I had the biggest canary-eating grin on... He talked about fun, passing, moving the ball, flying around the field, hitting people. All the things I wanted to hear.&quot;

San Diego lost three of Coryell&#x27;s first four games, then won their next four to preserve a small chance of making the playoffs. Fouts missed the next game because of an ankle injury, and San Diego lost 23–0. Coryell, who had made few changes to the Chargers&#x27; offense up to that point, began to emphasize the passing game more during the last three games of the season. Fouts responded with a total of 917 yards and 9 touchdowns as the Chargers won all three, giving him seven consecutive victories as a starter. He passed for 369 yards in the season finale, tying Tobin Rote&#x27;s franchise record.

Fouts finished with the third-best passer rating in the league (83.2) and the fourth-most touchdown passes (24). He had 2,999 passing yards, accounting for the bulk of San Diego&#x27;s league-leading 3,375 yards. A later &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; article noted the last three games of 1978 as the start of the &quot;unprecedented passing attack&quot; known as &quot;Air Coryell&quot;, which Fouts led for several years without further injuries.

=== 1979–1982: Four-time passing yardage leader ===

==== 1979 season ====

Fouts reached the playoffs for the first time in his career when San Diego went 12–4 in the 1979 season and won the AFC West. He finished the season with 4,082 yards passing, breaking Joe Namath&#x27;s NFL record of 4,007. He set an NFL record with four consecutive 300-yard games, while his total of six such games tied Joe Namath&#x27;s league record. With 332 completions out of 530 attempts, Fouts&#x27; completion percentage of 62.6% led the league, while his passer rating of 82.6 was the best in the AFC and third-best in the NFL. His leading receivers, John Jefferson and Charlie Joiner, were the first pair of teammates to each surpass 1,000 receiving yards in a season since 1968. Fouts said of his record-breaking season, &quot;I&#x27;m in the game for one thing—to get to the Super Bowl. The records will come because of our style of play.&quot;

In the end of season awards, Fouts finished second behind Earl Campbell for both AP NFL MVP (outvoted 34–27) and AP Offensive Player of the Year (outvoted 39–34). He was named a Pro Bowler and an AP first-team All-Pro. Other organizations to select him as their All-NFL quarterback included UPI, &quot;Pro Football Weekly&quot; and the &quot;Professional Football Writers of America.&quot;

San Diego&#x27;s return to the playoffs ended in disappointment when they lost 17–14 at home to the wildcard Houston Oilers. Fouts completed 25 of 47 passes for 333 yards, no touchdowns, and five interceptions. Fouts said after the game, &quot;We just made too many mistakes, that&#x27;s all. We didn&#x27;t play very well and they did.&quot; It was revealed after the game that Houston defensive coordinator Ed Biles had managed to crack the code San Diego used to signal their offensive plays to Fouts, giving them prior warning of the coming plays and potentially accounting in part for Fouts&#x27; struggles. Fouts himself did not believe that the signals were stolen: &quot;Anybody that says they&#x27;re stealing signals is a liar. According to the stats, we got 500 yards of offense. If they were stealing signals, then they didn&#x27;t do a very good job of it.&quot;

==== 1980 season ====

Fouts broke more records in the 1980 season when he led the Chargers to an 11–5 record and another divisional title. He broke the single-game passing yards franchise record he had shared with Rote in week 2, then improved on that total in weeks 6 and 7. The last of these was a 444-yard game against the New York Giants that prompted New York head coach Ray Perkins to say, &quot;he may be the best quarterback there is.&quot; He set another franchise record with a 20-game streak of regular season games with at least one touchdown pass. Fouts improved on his NFL single-season record with 4,715 passing yards and he became the first quarterback with two 4,000 yard seasons. His totals for attempts (589), completions (348) and 300-yard games (8) were also NFL records. His passing produced an unprecedented three 1,000-yard receivers, with Jefferson, Joiner and tight end Kellen Winslow all achieving the feat.

Fouts was again named to the Pro Bowl squad; he was a second-team AP All-Pro behind Brian Sipe of the Cleveland Browns. Joiner said of Fouts at this point, &quot;Dan has definitely matured over the last four years. His quickness of release is better, he&#x27;s improved at reading defenses, he&#x27;s better at going to the receiver who&#x27;s open.&quot;

San Diego again had home field advantage in the AFC playoffs, and hosted the Buffalo Bills in the divisional round. The Chargers trailed 14–13 with a little over two minutes to play, facing a 3rd and 10 at midfield; Fouts threw to little-used wide receiver Ron Smith for what would prove to be the game-winning touchdown. He finished with two touchdowns and 314 yards against a Bills defense that was known for being strong against passing offenses. The following week, San Diego hosted the Oakland Raiders with a place in the Super Bowl at stake. Fouts had a mixed first half, as he threw two touchdown passes to Joiner and two red zone interceptions. Joiner&#x27;s second touchdown began a comeback attempt from 28–7 behind that fell short; Oakland won 34–27 despite Fouts&#x27; total of 336 passing yards. Fouts was described by a Gannett article as &quot;deeply depressed&quot; afterwards. He said, &quot;the disappointment of not making the Super Bowl will hang heavy on my mind during the off-season.&quot;

==== 1981 season ====

Fouts was again the league&#x27;s passing yardage leader in the 1981 season, and the Chargers won their third straight AFC West title with a 10–6 record. He had to overcome the loss of one of his leading receivers, as Jefferson was traded after holding out for more money; San Diego brought in Wes Chandler from the New Orleans Saints as a replacement and their offense continued to statistically dominate the league. Fouts also had to overcome the fragility of the San Diego defense, which became much weaker after the trade of another holdout, defensive end Fred Dean. He completed a franchise record 15 consecutive passes during an opening day 44–14 victory over the Cleveland Browns. Another Charger record came in week 12 when he threw six touchdowns during a 55–21 win at the Oakland Raiders. Entering the final week of the regular season, San Diego needed another win over Oakland and a Denver loss to make the playoffs as division champions.

The NFL Players Association (NFLPA) ordered the Chargers to suspend Fouts before the regular season finale for non-payment of union fees. Fouts had not been a member of the NFLPA since 1976, when he left because of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) that he had opposed in court in 1977. The terms of the CBA required all players to pay union fees even if they were not members, with suspension compulsory if they refused. While he had paid under protest in 1978, Fouts refused to do so in subsequent seasons. Klein did not suspend Fouts as requested and he claimed that NFLPA executive director Ed Garvey was making a grandstanding move before the Chargers&#x27; potentially crucial final game, accusing him of vindictiveness and incompetence. Garvey said that Klein&#x27;s failure to penalize Fouts could lead the NFLPA to seek a legal termination of the CBA, which would leave the players free to strike at any time. This possibility was averted when a pair of Charger fans volunteered to pay the outstanding amount of $1,122. Garvey accepted the fan payment, though he still took Klein to court for his initial refusal to carry out the suspension. Fouts received an award from the National Right to Work Committee for his stance against compulsory union membership; he explained that he was a supporter of free enterprise and free association, and stated that he would continue to refuse to pay the union. With the matter temporarily settled, Fouts played against Oakland; the Chargers won the game and clinched the division as Denver had lost the previous day.
Fouts improved on his own NFL records for passing yards with 4,802 while also extending his record with a third 4,000 yard season. He improved his own records for attempts (609) and completions (360). His 33 passing touchdowns led the league and set a franchise record. He again made the Pro Bowl, this time as a backup to Ken Anderson. San Diego led the league in points scored and yards gained. Fouts said &quot;Nobody has really stopped us all year. This is the best year we&#x27;ve had yet.&quot;

San Diego faced the Dolphins in the divisional round, winning the Epic in Miami 41–38. The Chargers led 24–0 in the 1st quarter, then Miami recovered to lead 38–31. Fouts threw a game-tying touchdown pass with 58 seconds to play, then set up Rolf Benirschke&#x27;s winning field goal with a 39-yard completion to Joiner in overtime. He set NFL playoff records for pass attempts (53), completions (33), and yards (433). Fouts described the Epic in Miami as the greatest game he&#x27;d played in. He said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s ahead but I can&#x27;t imagine how it can get any more difficult than this one.&quot; The Chargers moved on to face the Bengals in Cincinnati for the AFC championship. The game became known as the &quot;Freezer Bowl&quot;, which was played in frigid and windy conditions; a gameday temperature of contrasting with the weather in Miami the previous week. Fouts struggled to grip the ball and passed for only 185 yards as the Chargers were defeated 27–7. He left the field with icicles having formed in his beard. Coryell later recalled, &quot;Dan couldn&#x27;t even talk to me on the sidelines. He couldn&#x27;t get the words out of his frozen mouth. I never felt sorry for another man like that.&quot;

==== 1982 season: Offensive Player of the Year ====

Fouts was again critical of the NFLPA when a players strike interrupted the 1982 season after two games. He attacked Garvey&#x27;s demand for 55% of gross revenues as ridiculous and stated that the union should be lobbying for greater rights for free agents. Garvey&#x27;s proposal would guarantee players certain wages based on their years of service, which Fouts felt would take away &quot;the incentive to achieve greatness.&quot; He also said that Garvey was too fixated on strike action: &quot;I&#x27;d like to see him &quot;negotiate&quot;, but he&#x27;s obviously out-manned.&quot; Fouts was the only Charger to vote against supporting the strike at a team meeting. Teammate Linden King said of Fouts, &quot;I understand where he is coming from, but I don&#x27;t agree. It is a game of preservation. He is looking out for himself.&quot; Another teammate, Louie Kelcher, commented, &quot;Dan has been saying this since 1977... Guys have to live with that.&quot; Despite his opposition to the strike, Fouts trained extensively with his teammates while it was ongoing. The strike lasted for 57 days, then play resumed with a truncated nine-game regular season.
When the season restarted Fouts had consecutive 300-yard passing games, tying and then surpassing Unitas&#x27; NFL career record of 26 such games. Two weeks later, the Chargers defeated the 49ers 41–37 in San Francisco. Fouts tied his career high with 444 passing yards and threw five touchdowns. Fouts had numerous friends in attendance because he grew up nearby; after his retirement, he described the game as the most fun he had while playing. The following week, Fouts passed for 435 yards in a 50–34 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals, becoming the first player to post back-to-back 400-yard games. San Diego finished 6–3 and made the playoffs for the fourth consecutive season.

Fouts passed for 2,883 yards, leading the league for the fourth year in a row; this streak remains an NFL record . His average yards per game of 320.3 was an NFL record, and would have put him on pace for 5,125 yards in a standard 16-game season. Fouts&#x27; passer rating was second only to Ken Anderson in the NFL, while his 17 touchdowns tied for first in the league. In the end-of-season awards, Fouts won the AP NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award with 43 of the available 80 votes, but finished runner-up in NFL MVP voting with 33 votes, two behind Washington kicker Mark Moseley. Fouts won a league MVP award from the PFWA, as well as the player-awarded Jim Thorpe Trophy. He was also voted to another Pro Bowl (where he was the game&#x27;s co-MVP) and named an AP first-team All-Pro. After his Offensive MVP award, Fouts questioned the value of giving individual awards in a team sport, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s nice to be singled out, but they probably shouldn&#x27;t give out any awards... Our society is so hung up on the star system and singling out people.&quot;

San Diego traveled to Pittsburgh for the first round of the playoffs. The Steelers led 28–17 in the final quarter before Fouts finished consecutive drives with touchdown passes to Winslow and the Chargers won 31–28. Fouts threw three touchdowns in total and passed for 333 yards. San Diego moved on to Miami for a playoff rematch that would pit the Chargers&#x27; top-ranked offense against the Dolphins&#x27; top-ranked defense. The Miami defense proved the decisive factor as they intercepted Fouts five times and allowed him only 191 yards. The resulting 34–13 defeat was the last playoff game of Fouts&#x27; career.

=== 1983–1987: Later career ===

==== 1983 season ====

Fouts&#x27; five-year contract with the Chargers expired on February 1, 1983, making him a free agent. He was unable to get offers from other teams, in part because of a rule that would require potential teams to give the Chargers two first-round draft picks in compensation. Fouts continued to criticize the NFLPA for the state of NFL free agency, describing it as &quot;another example of how the players have been misled and misguided by Garvey and his troops&quot;. On April 7, the &quot;Associated Press&quot; reported that Fouts had scheduled a meeting with the newly-formed United States Football League (USFL) about the possibility of switching leagues. Klein announced on April 26 that Fouts had come to agreement with the Chargers, but reported ten days later that there had been a misunderstanding and Fouts had still not signed. The Chargers began making plans to start the season with backup quarterback Ed Luther promoted to the starting role. Fouts eventually did sign on June 29, saying that he had considered joining a proposed San Diego–based USFL franchise but returned to the Chargers because he wanted to win a Super Bowl. His agent, Howard Slusher, said that Fouts had been on the verge of signing a USFL contract but backed out because he felt he had unfinished work with the Chargers. Slusher reported that the six-year contract could potentially pay upward of $1 million per year, making it one of the most lucrative in pro football history up to that point.

During preseason, Fouts missed some playing time with an arch injury. More injuries followed once the 1983 season began: Fouts sprained a wrist against the Cleveland Browns in week 4 and was forced to leave a win at the New York Giants in week 5 with a bruised shoulder. He also played with a sore thumb. In week 7, a hit by Andre Tippett of the New England Patriots further injured Fouts&#x27; shoulder and caused him to miss over a month. This broke a string of 74 consecutive starts that stretched back to 1978. Luther filled in for him and struggled, with the Chargers winning only one of five games during Fouts&#x27; absence. After returning for three games, Fouts sustained a third shoulder injury and missed the season finale. He only played in ten games but was still voted to his fifth straight Pro Bowl after finishing with the third best passer rating in the AFC.

==== 1984 season ====

The 1984 Chargers began 4–2, with Fouts leading the offense to the top of the league in passing yards and total yards. They won only three games for the rest of the year while key players missed time with injuries. Fouts was shut out for his first time since 1979 in a week 9 game at the Seattle Seahawks, in which both Winslow and Chandler were unfit to play. A highlight came in week 12, when he set franchise records for attempts (56) and completions (37) while throwing 4 touchdowns and leading the Chargers to a 34–28 overtime upset of the Miami Dolphins, who had entered the game with an unbeaten 11–0 record.

Fouts started the first thirteen games of the season, before injuring his groin and missing the remaining three. His total of 3,740 yards was still the second highest in the AFC. Over the 1983 and 1984 seasons, San Diego averaged 26.2 points per game when Fouts played and 16.6 per game when he did not.

==== 1985 season ====

Fouts entered the 1985 season leading all active players for passing yards and touchdowns. A survey of three NFL scouts placed Fouts alongside Joe Montana and Dan Marino as the best quarterbacks in the league. San Diego had one of the league&#x27;s weakest defenses but Fouts led them to a 2–1 start, passing for 1,002 yards and 9 touchdowns in the opening three games. He threw another touchdown on the Chargers&#x27; first possession of their week 4 game with the Cleveland Browns, but sustained knee ligament damage after hits on consecutive plays of their second series. Backup Mark Herrmann played the rest of the game but produced no points as the Browns won 21–7. Fouts underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair the injury later that day. Coryell commented, &quot;He&#x27;s an inspiration. We lost our whole key.&quot;

The injury was projected to keep Fouts out for three to six weeks, but he recovered slightly ahead of schedule. In the third game after the injury, San Diego were trailing 14–10 in the final quarter against the Minnesota Vikings before Fouts came off the bench and led a go-ahead touchdown drive, but the Vikings retook the lead and won 21–17. On his third start after returning, Fouts threw for 436 yards and 4 touchdowns in a 40–34 overtime win against the Raiders. It was the sixth 400-yard game of his career, a new NFL record. Fouts started the final game of the Chargers&#x27; 8–8 season on the bench with a cracked fibula. He passed for 3,686 yards despite the injuries, averaging over 300 yards per start. He was voted a second-team AP All-Pro behind Marino and made his sixth Pro Bowl. From 1983 to 1985, the Chargers were a combined 19–18 when Fouts started and 3–9 when he did not.

==== 1986 season ====

The 1986 season began well for the Chargers, who defeated Miami 50–28 with Fouts throwing 3 touchdowns and no interceptions. A week later, Fouts threw five interceptions in the second half of a 20–7 loss to the New York Giants. He continued to struggle as the season progressed, with 14 more interceptions in his next five games. Raiders cornerback Lester Hayes remarked that the Charger offense was &quot;not the Dan Fouts show anymore,&quot; and that running back Gary Anderson was now the key player. Fouts continued to pick up injuries and he missed three games due to a pair of concussions and one more with a sore shoulder. San Diego disappointed as a team, finishing 4–12; Coryell lost his job midway through the season.

San Diego&#x27;s new head coach Al Saunders preferred a more conservative style of offense, with more emphasis on Anderson and less on the 36-year-old Fouts attempting to throw long balls. Fouts has some success with the new system, with a higher completion percentage and fewer interceptions thrown late in the season. He posted his sixth 3,000-yard season, breaking an NFL record that he had shared with Sonny Jurgensen, and overtook Unitas for second place on the career passing yardage list. He said, &quot;I&#x27;m honored to even be mentioned in the same sentence with Johnny Unitas, but I still feel I&#x27;ve got no business being there.&quot;

==== 1987: Final season and retirement ====
Fouts played one full season after Coryell&#x27;s exit. He was involved in a preseason dispute with Chargers owner Alex Spanos. Spanos claimed he had met with Fouts to renegotiate his contract, which was for $750,000 in the 1987 season, and that Spanos had offered an increase to $1 million which Fouts had refused. He stated that he would be forced to trade Fouts unless the player agreed to play for $750,000. Fouts, who did not have his agent with him during the meeting, denied that he had been negotiating. He claimed that Spanos had &quot;a PR campaign underway to set the stage for a trade&quot;, questioned the plausibility of him having refused a large pay rise and told the media that he intended to play for his contracted amount. Spanos accepted Fouts&#x27; assurances, saying &quot;We&#x27;re all happy.&quot; A &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article speculated that Spanos had actually been trying to persuade Fouts to take a higher salary in 1987 and then retire, foregoing his contracted $750,000 for the 1988 season.

The 1987 season was interrupted by another players strike, which caused the week 3 games to be canceled and the following three weeks to feature teams made up largely of replacement players. While Fouts was not part of the players union and did not picket with his teammates, he nonetheless refused to play for the Chargers while the strike was ongoing, saying that he would be risking injury if he played behind an inexperienced offensive line. He led the Chargers in training five days each week with the sessions based on game plans prepared by San Diego&#x27;s coaching staff for the opponents that the replacement Chargers were playing.

The replacements won all three of their games, so Fouts and the other regulars came back to a 4–1 team that stood first in the AFC West. Fouts threw for 293 yards and two touchdowns in his first game back, and San Diego beat the Kansas City Chiefs 42–21; he credited the team&#x27;s practice regime during the strike for their quick start after it. Three further victories improved the Chargers&#x27; record to a league-best 8–1. They lost all six of their remaining games and missed the playoffs. Fouts played only briefly in the first of these defeats due to a calf injury, and missed the finale with a slightly torn rotator cuff. He tended to pass over shorter distances in Saunders&#x27; offensive system. Fouts&#x27; passer rating and completion percentage were both his worst since 1975, while his 10 touchdowns passes were his fewest since 1977.

Fouts announced his retirement on March 24, 1988, at his home in Rancho Santa Fe. He cited the wear and tear on his body as the main reason. He was 36 years old at the time, and second only to Fran Tarkenton in terms of NFL career passing yards, trailing by about 4,000 yards having attempted 863 fewer passes. Fouts ranked fourth in career passing touchdowns with 254. Reflecting on his career, he said, &quot;We had so much confidence in what we were doing and we had a lot of fun.&quot;

=== Legacy and playing style ===

Fouts threw for a total 43,040 yards and 254 touchdowns while starting 171 games over fifteen seasons in San Diego; he also rushed for 476 yards and 13 touchdowns. At the time of his retirement, Fouts was credited with 42 team records and 7 league records. San Diego found Fouts difficult to replace, making 14 quarterback changes in barely five seasons before settling on Stan Humphries as a long-term starter during the 1992 season.

Fouts is remembered as the quarterback of the Air Coryell offense, which led the league in passing yards seven times in an eight-season span (1978–1983, 1985). Coryell described Fouts as a superior quarterback, writing &quot;He had quick feet and could get back and make decisions. He wasn&#x27;t afraid to pull the trigger and let the ball go.&quot; Fouts was able to make up to five reads before deciding on a pass target. His accuracy and quick decision making compensated for his unexceptional arm strength. Fouts rarely used the shotgun formation; he felt that he was more able to read defenses at the line. After taking the snap, he would drop back a shorter distance than most quarterbacks and often delay until the last second to give his receivers time to get open; both tendencies led him to take a number of hits throughout his career. Walsh, who went on to be a Hall of Fame head coach after leaving San Diego, said &quot;Dan Fouts had a cool, steel-like nerve and courage... He took a lot of beatings, a lot of pounding, but continued to play, hurt or otherwise. He played more physical football than anybody on his team, including the linebackers&quot;.

Fouts was noted for his aggressive leadership, and he would often berate teammates who failed to perform. He wore a hat that read &quot;MFIC&quot; (Motherfucker in charge), which was already evident to the team. &quot;He knew it, we knew it, everybody knew it,&quot; said Chargers teammate Hank Bauer. When Fouts was injured in 1983, Benirschke commented that the team lacked confidence, adding, &quot;Dan&#x27;s always been the guy. People might get mad at him, but they always knew he was doing it because he wanted to win.&quot; Winslow called Fouts &quot;our leader, cheerleader and quarterback all in one.&quot; After his playing career, Fouts lamented, &quot;I wish I’d been kinder to my teammates&quot;.

The Chargers retired his No. 14 jersey during a ceremony at Jack Murphy Stadium on November 27, 1988, during halftime of a game against San Francisco. At the time, he was the only Charger to have his number retired. He was further honored when the San Diego Hall of Champions placed him in the Breitbard Hall of Fame in 1989. Fouts was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1993, his first year of eligibility. Later that year, he was inducted into the Chargers Hall of Fame, together with Joiner. In 1999, he was ranked number 92 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Football Players. He was one of the twenty quarterbacks listed as finalists for the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team, though he was not among the ten who made the team. In 2009, Fouts received more votes than any other Charger during fan voting for their 50th anniversary team.

Fouts frequently credits Coryell for his success. Speaking in 1987, Fouts said, &quot;You wouldn&#x27;t be talking to me right now if it wasn&#x27;t for Don, I&#x27;d be so far away from this. He meant everything. He made me.&quot; He credited three assistant coaches: Robinson from Oregon, Joe Gibbs, and Ernie Zampese from the Chargers. When Fouts was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, he chose Coryell to present him. Fouts considered strong line play to be another important factor in San Diego&#x27;s offense and would buy his linemen dinner if they kept him from being sacked during a game.

The Chargers never went to the Super Bowl under Fouts; he frequently appears on lists of the best quarterbacks not to win a Super Bowl or play in one. The San Diego defense was often blamed for their failure to win a title during Fouts career; a strong unit before the trade of Fred Dean early in the 1981 season, the defense was among the league&#x27;s worst for the next five years. Overall, the defense rated in the bottom quarter of the NFL in 10 of Fouts&#x27; 15 seasons in the league. Fouts was the first quarterback to be inducted into the Hall of Fame with no appearances in a title game (Super Bowl or the NFL championship game). He expressed the hope that others would follow, he said &quot;The Super Bowl is what you play for, but it is not your career, and not how you should be judged.&quot;

== Broadcasting ==

=== Television ===
When he announced his retirement, Fouts stated his desire to work as a commentator, starting with the 1988 season. He had briefly worked as a journalist during his career, when he covered Super Bowl XX for &quot;USA Today&quot; and a San Diego television station. Fouts did an audition tape for CBS, working with Dick Stockton, and he officially joined the &quot;NFL on CBS&quot; team as an analyst in March of that year. Over the course of the next six seasons, he was primarily partnered with Verne Lundquist. CBS were outbid by Fox and lost their NFL coverage rights in 1994. Fouts then switched to the CBS-affiliated KPIX-TV in his hometown of San Francisco, where he worked as the sports director and a sports anchor. In 1997, Fouts returned to network television as an analyst, this time working college football games for ABC Sports alongside play-by-play man Brent Musburger.

In 2000, Fouts moved into a commentary role on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, alongside anchor Al Michaels and comedian Dennis Miller. He had a three-year contract, but ABC dropped both Fouts and Miller from the show in 2002 after only two seasons. Fouts stayed with ABC, returning to college football and working alongside veteran announcer Keith Jackson. After Jackson&#x27;s retirement from ABC in 2006, Fouts partnered with Tim Brant.

ABC declined to renew the contracts of either Fouts or Brant in 2008. It was reported in &quot;USA Today&quot; later that year that Fouts was returning to CBS for NFL games, where he would work with a variety of play-by-play announcers including Don Criqui, Bill Macatee, and Dick Enberg. In 2009, he was moved to partner with Enberg as the number 3 broadcasting team for the NFL on CBS. Ian Eagle replaced Enberg as Fouts&#x27; partner the following season, and the new pair remained in the number three slot until 2014, when they were moved to the number two team behind Jim Nantz and Phil Simms (and later, Tony Romo). Eagle and Fouts were often called &quot;The Bird and the Beard&quot;. While with CBS, Fouts covered Chargers preseason games carried throughout Southern California.

In April 2020, CBS did not renew Fouts&#x27; contract. , he still provides televised color commentary for Chargers preseason games.

=== Other media ===

In 1998, Fouts made his big-screen debut, portraying himself in the Frank Coraci-directed comedy &quot;The Waterboy&quot;, starring Adam Sandler. Fouts did color commentary for the football video game &quot;NFL GameDay 2004&quot;, released in 2003. He partnered with long-time announcer Enberg. During his second stint at CBS, Fouts called NFL games for Westwood One radio, including Super Bowl 50.

== Personal life ==
Fouts married his first wife Julianne Mehl, a public health major, in 1977. The pair met at the University of Oregon. They later divorced, and Fouts married event producer Jeri Martin in 1994. He has two children from his first marriage, and two from his second. His son from his first marriage, Dominic, died of colon cancer in 2012. The family set up the Dominic Fouts Memorial Cancer Fund, with Fouts as an adviser.

He lives with his wife in Oregon, the state of his alma mater, in a two-story home he had constructed from logs in the 1970s. The house is situated in the mountains near the city of Sisters.

Described as a private person away from football, Fouts enjoyed fishing, skiing, and racquetball during his playing career. He is an avid golfer who has appeared at numerous charity events.

<text>Adamawa is a state in the North-East geopolitical zone of Nigeria, bordered by Borno to the northwest, Gombe to the west, and Taraba to the southwest while its eastern border forms part of the national border with Cameroon. It takes its name from the historic emirate of Adamawa, with the emirate&#x27;s old capital of Yola serving as the capital city of Adamawa State. The state was formed in 1991 when the former Gongola State was broken up into Adamawa and Taraba states. The state is one of the most heterogeneous in Nigeria, having over 100 indigenous ethnic groups.

Of the 36 states, Adamawa is the eighth largest in the area, but the thirteenth least populous with an estimated population of about 4.25 million as of 2016. Geographically, the state is mainly composed of highlands and mountains (the Atlantika, Mandara, and the Shebshi ranges) and the Adamawa Plateau crossed by valleys and rivers, most notably the Benue and Gongola rivers. The lowlands of Adamawa are part of the West Sudanian savanna in the north and the wetter Guinean forest-savanna mosaic in parts of the south, while elevated areas are parts of the Mandara Plateau mosaic and Cameroonian Highlands forests ecoregions. In the extreme south of the state is part of the Gashaka Gumti National Park, a large wildlife park that contains large populations of bushbuck, African buffalo, patas monkey, black-and-white colobus, giant pangolin, and hippopotamus along with some of Nigeria&#x27;s last remaining Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee, African leopard, and African golden cat populations.

What is now known as Adamawa state has been inhabited for years by various ethnic groups, including the Bwatiye (Bachama), Bali, Bata (Gbwata), Gudu, Mbula-Bwazza, and Nungurab (Lunguda) in the central region; the Kamwe in the north and central region; the Jibu in the far south; the Kilba, Mafa, Marghi, and Waga in the north, and the Mumuye in the south while the Fulani live throughout the state — often as nomadic herders. Adamawa is also religiously diverse as about 50% of the population is Sunni Muslim and 40% is Christian (mainly Lutheran, EYN, ECWA, and Pentecostal), while the remaining 10% are adherents of traditional ethnic religions.

As an agriculturally-based state, the Adamawa State economy mainly relies on livestock and crops, such as cotton, groundnuts, millet, cassava, guinea corn, and yams. Due to the Boko Haram insurgency affecting development in the state, Adamawa has the eleventh lowest Human Development Index in the country but as the insurgency has abated since 2016 due to terrorist infighting, development has been renewed.

==History==

Before it became a state in Nigeria, Adamawa was a subordinate kingdom of the Sultanate of Sokoto, which also included much of northern Cameroon. The rulers bear the title of emir (&quot;&quot; in the local language, Fulfulde).

The name &quot;Adamawa&quot; came from the founder of the kingdom, Modibo Adama, a regional leader of the Fulani Jihad organized by Usman dan Fodio of Sokoto in 1804. Modibo Adama came from the region of Gurin (now just a small village) and in 1806, received a green flag for leading the jihad in his native country. In the following years, Adama conquered many lands and tribes. In 1838, he moved his capital to Ribadu, and in 1839, to Joboliwo. In 1841, he founded Yola, where he died in 1848. After the European colonization (first by Germany and then by Britain), the rulers remained as emirs and the line of succession has continued to the present day.
In the early 1800s, the Fulani jihad seized much of modern-day Adamawa State and formed the Adamawa Emirate under the Sokoto Caliphate. About 90 years later, forces from Germany and the British Empire defeated the Emirate in the Adamawa Wars and split the area. The British-controlled area (much of the west of modern-day Adamawa) was incorporated into the Northern Nigeria Protectorate which later merged into British Nigeria before becoming independent as Nigeria in 1960. The German-controlled area formed a part of German Kamerun until allied forces invaded and occupied Kamerun during the Kamerun campaign of World War I. After the war, what is now eastern Adamawa State became most of the Northern Cameroons within the British Cameroons until 1961, when a referendum led to a merger with Nigeria.

Originally, modern-day Adamawa State was a part of the post-independence Northern Region until 1967 when the area became part of the North-Eastern State. After the North-Eastern State was split in 1976, Gongola State was formed on 3 February 1976 alongside ten other states. Fifteen years after statehood, Gongola was split with the state&#x27;s south becoming Taraba State while its north became Adamawa State.

A measles outbreak was reported in an internally displaced persons camp, in January 2015.

=== Lamibe of Adamawa ===
Lamibe (Emirs) of Adamawa have included:
=== Boko Haram insurgency ===
Adamawa State has been badly impacted by the Boko Haram insurgency. In January 2012, Boko Haram attacked Gombi, Mubi and Yola. By 2014, the state became home to camps housing an estimated 35,000 internally displaced people, fleeing violence from Boko Haram in locations including Mubi, Madagali, Askira Uba, Bama and Gwoza in the states of Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe. In 2014, an estimate placed the number of IDPs around Yola at 400,000. An attack occurred in Chakawa in 2014. A suicide bombing in Yola in 2015 killed over 30 people. A double suicide bombing in Madagali in 2016 killed over 50 people. Mubi is the worst affected place in Adamawa State, suffering major attacks in 2012, 2014, 2017 and 2018.

Organizations serving the community include the Adamawa Peace Initiative (API) - a group of business, religious, and community leaders - and the Adamawa Muslim Council. The United States Agency for International Development has pledged to provide continuing humanitarian assistance.

On 21–22 February 2020, Boko Haram terrorists launched an attack on homes and churches in Garkida, killing three soldiers and wounding civilians.

==Geography==
Adamawa is one of the largest states of Nigeria and occupies about 36,917 square kilometers. It is bordered by the states of Borno to the northwest, Gombe to the west and Taraba to the southwest. Its eastern border forms the national eastern border with Cameroon.

Topographically, it is a mountainous land crossed by large river valleys – Benue, Gongola, and Yedsarem. The valleys of the Mount Cameroon, Mandara Mountains, and Adamawa Plateau form part of the landscape.

=== Climate ===
=== Climate change ===

A study conducted on climate in 2012 in Nigeria&#x27;s Adamawa state revealed monthly mean temperature rise in Gyawana, Yola, and Mubi, while annual rainfall declined. Delays in rainfall and reduced length of fall were observed in these areas.

Contrarily, in recent times, the humidity and temperature of Adamawa state, especially during the dry season, begin to rise in November, which is usually very hot. The harmattan period is experienced between December and February every year.

In recent years, the effect of climate change has begun to be more evident. Tropical wet and dry weather prevails in Adamawa State. The wet season lasts from April to October, whereas the dry season lasts for at least five months (November to March) yearly. An upsurge in rainfall in September in recent years is usually accompanied by floods. According to Dr. Sulieman Muhammad, the Executive Secretary of the Adamawa State Emergency Management Agency (ADSEMA), 25 people died in September 2022 due to floods brought on by both the overflow of water from the Lagdo Dam in Cameroon due to severe rainfall.

In October 2022, an additional flood claimed 37 lives and submerged 89,000 thousand hectares of farmlands with 58 others sustaining various degrees of injuries.

Flooding in September 2023 killed 5 people. Flooding the next month across 14 out of 21 LGAs in Adamawa caused 33 deaths and displaced 51,043 people. 11 temporary settlements across the LGAs of Yola South, Yola North, Lamude, Madagali, and Demsa were set up to house the internally displaced.

==Economy==

Adamawa has vast arable land for agriculture, waterfalls and landscape, and solid minerals like limestone, tantalite and kaoline. The GDP of the state is estimated to be ₦2.66 trillion. It has the 18th largest economy among the 36 states of Nigeria and the largest in the North-East region. The total revenue of the state experienced a growth of 9.93% from around ₦700.602 billion in 2020 to ₦777.62 billion in 2021. However, the state heavily depends on federally distributed revenues, with 77.52% of its total revenue being Gross FAAC in 2021. Adamawa had an IGR of ₦8.65 billion in 2021. The state imported $25.02 million worth of goods between 2019 and 2021. It has a debt stock of ₦132.68 billion as of December 2021, ranking the 19th most indebted state in Nigeria and 2nd most indebted in the North-East.

The Dangote group operates a sugar production factory in Numan which has a sugar refining capacity of 3,000 tonnes of cane per day. The company announced plans to expand to factory to a capacity of 6,000tcd, 9,800tcd and to 15,000 tcd. They also plan to increase the size of the factory from 8,700 hectares in 2022 to about 24,200 hectares within seven years.

The markets found in the state are incredibly important to its economic activity and to its inhabitants. These markets, especially its cattle markets, enhanced the development of economic activities in the state, cash crops like groundnut and beans are grown and crops like rice, maize and sorghum are grown as food crops. Around River Yedseram and its tributaries, vegetable gardening in the dry season is practised. Fishing is also very popular in the riverine areas. The breeds of cattle found in Adamawa are; Adamawa Gudali, Sokoto Gudali, White Fulani, Ambala, Red Sokoto and Red Fulani. The state has around 1.5 million cattle and 64 grazing reserves of which 30 are gazetted.

Adamawa state has a thriving livestock industry especially cattle-rearing. It has 2.5 million heads of cattle. Traders come from all over the country and West Africa to buy and sell cattle in its markets, such as the Mubi International cattle market in Mubi South. Despite the state&#x27;s high level of cattle production, the markets are poorly developed without essential services like meat processing. Meaning, live animals have to be transported in trucks for 4 days before they reach cities with high demand to regions like the South-West, South-South or South-East Nigeria.

The development of many communities in the state can be traced to the colonial era when the Germans ruled a swath of territory known as the Northern and Southern Kameruns from Dikwa in the North to Victoria (Limbe) on the Atlantic coast in the 19th century. These were, however, handed over as United Nations Trust Territories to the British at the end of the World War I with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles. After a series of referendums, the Northern Kameruns joined Nigeria to form the then Sardauna Province and the Southern Kameruns formed a Confederation with French-speaking Cameroon.

<text>The Mercury Monarch is a compact automobile that was marketed by the Mercury division of Ford from the 1975 to 1980 model years. Designed as the original successor for the Mercury Comet, the Monarch was marketed as a luxury compact vehicle; alongside its Ford Granada counterpart, the Monarch expanded the segment in the United States as automakers responded to the 1973 fuel crisis. 

Taking its name from a former marque of Ford Canada, the Mercury Monarch was slotted between the compact Comet and the Montego in the Mercury model line (later, the Zephyr and Cougar). Sharing many of its chassis underpinnings with the Comet, the Monarch marked the final evolution of the 1960-1965 Ford Falcon chassis architecture. The Monarch was also the counterpart of the 1977-1980 Lincoln Versailles sedan. 

In total, 575,567 Monarchs were produced. Ford assembled the model line alongside the Granada at Mahwah Assembly (Mahwah, New Jersey) and Wayne Stamping &amp; Assembly (Wayne, Michigan). For 1981, the Monarch was discontinued after a single generation, with the Mercury counterpart of the Granada taking on the Cougar (and ultimately, Marquis) nameplate. 

==Development==
The Mercury Monarch was developed as external circumstances outside of Ford Motor Company&#x27;s control forced major changes in consumer buying habits. The 1973 fuel crisis and new engine power sapping emissions standards would lead to buyers valuing luxury over performance, with fuel economy becoming a key attribute. Originally developed as an extensively updated Mercury Comet for the 1975 model year, the more upscale redesign was instead renamed Mercury Monarch. The Ford division also introduced its own redesigned Maverick, the Granada. As Ford Motor Company predicted the compact segment would grow in sales, the existing Comet/Maverick would remain in production. To differentiate Granada/Monarch from the Maverick/Comet, Ford offered the new-generation compact-segment vehicles with a higher than usual level of equipment, comfort and convenience features.

Although General Motors had earlier introduced the Buick Apollo (later Skylark) and Oldsmobile Omega in 1973, the Granada/Monarch became one of the few vehicles that would break a long-standing tradition within American auto manufacturers of associating size with luxury.

== Overview ==
=== Chassis ===
As with the Ford Granada, the Mercury Monarch shared its unibody chassis with its Ford Maverick/Mercury Comet predecessors. Based heavily on the first-generation Ford Falcon from 1960, the design utilized coil spring front suspension with a leaf-sprung live rear axle; due to its Falcon origins, the Monarch was also loosely mechanically related to the first-generation Ford Mustang and Mercury Cougar.

The base engine was a  inline six-cylinder engine, with a inline six optional. V8 power came from one of two options: the or Windsor engines.

=== Body ===
Although originally developed to become a new Mercury Comet, the Mercury Monarch was differentiated from the Comet produced alongside it in a number of ways. Using the Mercedes-Benz 280 as a benchmark for its styling and interior packaging, the Monarch abandoned the Coke bottle styling of the Comet for straighter-edged body panels. In the front, the Monarch adapted much of the styling of Mercury&#x27;s large full size Marquis (with the exception of single exposed headlights). While the roofline of the four-door model was heavily influenced by Mercedes-Benz, the two-door was given its own roofline with vertical opera windows. The rear featured horizontal wrap-around taillamps with amber reflectors and a color-keyed decorative trim panel with a fuel filler door.

In 1978, the Monarch underwent an exterior facelift; the headlamps were converted from round to rectangular, with the turn signals moved under the headlamps. The taillamps were revised to all red lenses and the center rear trim panel was changed to a new design with an argent finish on base models or a matching red reflector on top trim levels.

On the inside, in contrast from other Lincoln-Mercury cars, the Monarch was equipped with front bucket seats. While a feature associated with sporty cars at the time, the individual seats (from the European Ford Granada) were chosen for their support and range of adjustment. Unlike its fully instrumented European competitors, the wood-trimmed dashboard of the Monarch was only equipped with three instruments – a speedometer, fuel gauge, and a clock – along with a suite of warning lights.

=== Trim ===
At its launch, the Monarch was available in two trim levels: base and Ghia. For 1977, the two-door coupe was produced in an S (Sports Coupe) trim. For 1978 and 1979, the ESS (European Sports Sedan) trim was available, distinguished by blacked-out exterior trim.

====Grand Monarch Ghia====

The Mercury Grand Monarch Ghia was offered from 1975 to 1976, marketed as the highest-trim version of the Monarch. Adopting many features shared with the larger Marquis and Grand Marquis, the Grand Monarch Ghia offered a sophisticated central hydraulic power system and four-wheel disc brakes not used on the standard Monarch or Granada. According to the May 1976 edition of &quot;Car and Driver&quot;, three out of five of Ford top executives, including Henry Ford II, used the Mercury Grand Monarch Ghia as their personal car.

Other standard Grand Monarch Ghia features included:

* Leather trim
* Vinyl roof
* LCD clock
* Leather-wrapped steering wheel
* Power steering
* Dual map lights
* Illuminated visor vanity mirror (passenger side)
* 14-inch cast-aluminum spoke wheels
* Solid-state ignition
* Whitewall steel-belted radial tires
* Reclining bucket seats with matching map pockets
* Plusher carpeting and soundproofing
For 1977, the Grand Monarch Ghia was withdrawn and repackaged as the Lincoln Versailles. Intended as a response to the Cadillac Seville, the Versailles adopted much of the content of the Grand Monarch Ghia with a slightly restyled exterior. Among the most controversial examples of badge engineering in the American automotive industry, the Lincoln Versailles was withdrawn during the 1980 model year.

<doc id="905838" wikidata="Q117714" url="?curid=905838" title="Anambra State">
<text>Anambra () is a state in Nigeria. It is located in the South-eastern region of the country. The state was created on 27 August 1991. Anambra state is bounded by Delta State to the west, Imo State and Rivers State to the south, Enugu State to the east and Kogi State to the north. The state&#x27;s capital is Awka, while the state’s largest city is Onitsha which is regarded as one of the largest metropolises in Africa. Nnewi is the second largest commercial and industrial city in Anambra State, and also a known automobile hub within Nigeria and Africa.

The state name was inherited from the former Anambra State, a territory that consisted of the present day Enugu State, Anambra State and parts of Ebonyi State. The old Anambra State was formed in 1976 from the former East Central State. The state is named after Omambala River, a river that runs through the state. Anambra is the anglicized form of Omambala. The State capital is Awka. The city of Onitsha, a historic port city from the pre-colonial era, remains an important centre of commerce within the state,while Nnewi is the second largest commercial and industrial city in the state.

Nicknamed the &quot;Light of the Nation&quot;, Anambra State is the fourteenth most populous state in the nation, although that has seriously been argued against as Onitsha, the state&#x27;s biggest and most populous urban area was discovered to be over 8.5 million in population in 2022 by Africapolis which makes Onitsha one of the largest urban areas in Nigeria by population. The area currently known as Anambra State has been the site of numerous civilizations since at least the 9th century AD, including the ancient Kingdom of Nri, whose capital was the historic town of Igbo-Ukwu within the state. Residents of Anambra State are primarily Igbo, with the Igbo language serving as a lingua franca throughout the state.

During the Nigerian Civil War (1967–1970), Anambra State was part of the secessionist Republic of Biafra formed by Igbo nationalists. Anambra was severely affected by the war. Today, Anambra State is one of the most urbanized states in Nigeria.

== Etymology ==
The name Anambra is the merging of Anam and the English word &#x27;branch&#x27;. Anam is a clan in the Omambala region and the last Igbo speaking community the British colonialists encountered while heading up to Northern Nigeria from across the riverine areas. They usually described present day Anambra as &#x27;Anam branch&#x27; to their colleagues up North. Reason Anam together with some neighboring clans was Anambra LGA when the state was created. It is now Anambra-West LGA with Olumbanasa.

== History ==
Anambra&#x27;s history stretches to the 9th century AD, as revealed by archaeological excavations at Igbo-Ukwu and Ezira. It has great works of art in iron, bronze, copper, and pottery. These have revealed a sophisticated divine Kingship administrative system, which held sway in the area of Anambra from c. 948 AD to 1911. In some towns, such as Ogidi and others, local families had hereditary rights to kingship for centuries.

Great Britain recognised some of these traditional kings and leaders in their system of indirect rule of the Protectorate of South Nigeria. Beginning in the 19th century, they appointed some noble leaders as Warrant Chiefs, authorizing them to collect taxes, among other duties.

Anambra is in the Igbo-dominated area that seceded as part of an independent Biafra in 1967, following rising tensions with Northern Nigeria. During the Nigerian/Biafran war (1967–1970), Biafran engineers constructed a relief airstrip in the town of Uli/Amorka (code named &quot;Annabelle&quot;). Extremely dangerous relief flights took off from Sao Tome and other sites loaded with tons of food and medicine for the distressed Biafran population. Uli/Amorka airstrip was the site where American pilots such as Alex Nicoll, and scores of others, delivered tons of relief supplies to the Biafran population.

Disgusted by the suffering and mounting death toll in Biafra from starvation, as well as the continuous harassment of the relief planes by the Nigerian Airforce, Carl Gustaf von Rosen resigned as a Red Cross relief pilot. He helped Biafra to form an Airforce of five Minicoin planes Malmö MFI-9 stationed at the Uga airstrip. He named his tiny but effective air force &quot;Babies of Biafra&quot; in honour of the babies who died from starvation inside Biafra.

Old Anambra State was created in 1976 from part of East Central State, and its capital was Enugu. In 1991, a re-organisation divided Anambra into two states, Anambra and Enugu. The capital of the New Anambra is Awka.

==Geography==
=== Location ===
Boundaries are formed by Delta State and Edo State to the west for about 97 km across the River Niger, Imo State and Rivers State (for four km) to the south, Enugu State to the east for 139 km, and Kogi State to the north for about 40 km. The name was derived from the Anambra River (Omambala) which flows through the area and is a tributary of the River Niger.

Anambra is the eighth-most populated state in the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the second-most densely populated state in Nigeria after Lagos State. The stretch of more than 45 km between the towns of Oba and Amorka contains a cluster of numerous thickly populated villages and small towns, giving the area an estimated average density of 1,500–2,000 persons per square kilometre.

=== Climate ===
The state has a Tropical wet and dry or savanna climate with yearly temperature of 28.99 °C (84.18 °F) and it is -0.47% lower than Nigeria&#x27;s averages. Anambra typically receives about 212.36 millimeters (8.36 inches) of precipitation and has 243.38 rainy days (66.68% of the time) annually.

The state has been described as one of the worst places affected by the climate change in Nigeria and sub-Saharan Africa in 2022 according to the Climate Change Education and Action Programme, (CLEAP).

== Administrative Division ==

=== Cities and administrative divisions ===

With an annual population growth rate of 2.21 percent per annum, Anambra State has over 60% of its people living in urban areas. It is one of the most urbanized states in Nigeria.

The major urban centres of Anambra State are Onitsha, Nnewi, Ekwulobia, Ihiala, Aguleri and Awka, the state capital. Awka and Onitsha had developed as pre-colonial urban centres: Awka was the craft industrial centre of the Nri hegemony. Onitsha is a city state on the Niger, having developed as a river port and commercial centre.

Onitsha is a fast-growing commercial city and has developed to become a huge conurbation extending to Idemili, Oyi and Anambra East LGAs, with one of the largest markets in West Africa.

In 2012 the tri-city area was dubbed the Onitsha-Nnewi-Awka (ONA) Industrial Axis, in recognition of the expanding industrial capacity. Nnewi (sometimes called the Taiwan of Nigeria) is a rapidly developing industrial and commercial centre. Designated as the state capital, Awka has regained its precolonial administrative eminence.

== Economy ==
Anambra houses the first Nigerian vehicle manufacturer, Innoson, an automobile manufacturer, located in Nnewi.

People all over West Africa travel to Onitsha and Nnewi to trade, which boost the internal revenue of the state. Onitsha is among the top commercial cities in Africa.

Agriculture is an important economic sector in Anambra. Oil palms, maize, rice, yams and cassava are among the crops grown. Fishing is also part of the economic mainstay of Anambra State more especially for communities along the riverine areas.

Anambra is a home of innovation, inventions and creativity. There have been several innovations in Anambra, due to its appreciation of education, which has added to the state&#x27;s GDP. One of those was in 2018, when two brothers, Atikpo Chukwuebuka and Ubaka Chukwuebuka, were the first to invent a machine, that could wash off the bitterness from bitter-leaf (a popular vegetable staple in Nigeria). This machine will greatly improve the productivity of vegetable farming in the state.

The export of agricultural items is a continual boost to Anambra Internal Generated Revenue. In 2017, the state generated $5 million from the export of washed bitter leaf.

There is a huge deposit of oil and gas in Nigeria, with the Anambra Basin having a great potential of 1000 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves untapped. Having more than 13 oil wells situated in Anambra, the state has the capacity to produce more than 100,000 barrels of crude oil per day, with indigenous companies like Orient Petroleum, and Sterling Oil Exploration and Production Co. LTD (SEEPCO), already leading the way.

=== Natural resources ===
Anambra is rich in natural gas, crude oil, bauxite, and ceramic. It has an almost 100 percent arable soil.

Anambra state has many other resources in terms of agro-based activities such as fisheries and farming, as well as land cultivated for pasturing and animal husbandry.

==== Oil and gas ====
In the year 2006, a foundation-laying ceremony for the first Nigerian private refinery, Orient Petroleum Refinery (OPR), was made at Aguleri area. The Orient Petroleum Resource Ltd (OPRL), owner of OPR, was licensed in June 2002, by the Federal Government to construct a private refinery with a capacity of .

In 2012, following the efforts of Governor Peter Obi and other stakeholders of Orient Petroleum, Anambra State became an oil-producing state. The indigenous company struck oil in the Anambra River basin.

On 2 August 2015, the management of Orient Petroleum Resources Plc said the company planned to increase its crude oil production to 3,000 barrels per day by September 2015, as it stepped up production activities in two new oil wells in its Aguleri oil fields. An indigenous company, Nails and Stanley Ltd, was to establish a gas plant at Umueje in Ayamelum Local Government Area to support economic activities in the oil and gas industry in the state.

Following the attribution of eleven (11) oil wells by the Revenue Mobilization Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) in August 2021, Anambra State joined the league of oil producing States in Nigeria. The process to amend the law that set up the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) through which infrastructure is provided to oil producing States has started. The purpose is to include Anambra State in the list of oil producing States as stated in the NDDC law through the amendment of Section 2(1)(b) of the NDDC Establishment ACT CAP N 86 LFN 2004.

== Infrastructure and urbanization ==
Since the late 1990s, there has been a migration from rural to urban areas in the state, resulting in Anambra becoming a highly urbanized state: 62% of its population lives in urban areas. In October 2015, the APGA-led state government of Willie Obiano, signed a memorandum of understanding with Galway modular housing company, Affordable Building Concepts International, for 10,000 housing units to be built in the state.

Given decades of neglect of infrastructure and bad governance, the shift in human migration has posed problems for the state. Infrastructure improvements, both physical and social, have lagged behind the growth in population. There are problems in environmental sanitation, erosion control, and provision of social services. Major cities have become characterized by inadequate and deteriorated road networks and walkways, unregulated building patterns, poor sanitation, uncontrolled street trading, mountains of garbage, and chaotic transport systems, creating congestion, noise pollution, and overcrowding.

The government of Peter Obi, with the assistance of the UN-HABITAT, produced 20-year structural plans (2009–2028) for three major cities in the State: Onitsha, Nnewi and Awka – the Capital Territory, to restore urban planning and guide their growth into the future.

The plans contain policies and proposals for land use, city beautification, road infrastructure, industrial development, housing, waste disposal, water supply and health and educational facilities to turn the cities into successful urban areas that can generate employment and wealth, and provide high living standards for their residents.

Anambra became the first state in Nigeria to adopt structural plans for its cities. With effective implementation, it should systematically grow as a major economic center in Nigeria, and West Africa.

The process of urbanization is fairly contributed by population growth, immigration, migration, and infrastructure initiatives like good road, water, power, and gardens, resulting in the growth of villages into towns, town into cities and cities into metros. To have ecologically feasible development, planning requires an understanding of the growth dynamics. There is a fear that if too many people leave the villages, only the aged men and women will be left to farm. This pattern has been seen in Amesi, Akpo, and Achina towns in Aguata local government area. They have been important in the production of yam, cocoyam, and cassava through consistent agriculture, but such activities have suffered due to the out-migration of youth to the urban centres. There has been both food scarcity in the region and over-population in urban areas.

To upgrade the state capital and improve traffic, Awka, Governor Willie Obiano signed off on construction of three flyovers between the Amawbia and Arroma end of the Enugu-Onitsha Expressway, a distance of about three kilometres within the city. Anambra International Cargo Airport, Umueri, opened on 7 December 2021.

== Government and politics ==

The State has a three-tier administrative structure: State, Local and Autonomous community levels. The three arms at state level are the Executive, the Legislative and the Judiciary. The executive arm is headed by an elected governor, who is assisted by a deputy governor, commissioners and executive advisers.

Anambra&#x27;s political history can be described as varied. Until the early 21st century, it was marked by considerable unrest. Having a long list of &quot;firsts&quot; in Nigerian history, it has been known by the sobriquet as, &quot;The Light of The Nation&quot;. On 29 May 1999, Chinwoke Mbadinuju was sworn in as civilian governor of Anambra state, after many years of military rule. His administration was plagued by deep problems: the most notable was withholding of teachers&#x27; salaries in the school. The teachers finally conducted a ten-month strike in all the government secondary schools in the state.

Before Mbadinuju&#x27;s rule, secondary education had been free of charge. His administration imposed a tuition fee of 3,000 Naira per term, for all secondary schools, which led to an unprecedented massive demonstration by secondary school students from all over the state. Many people attribute Mbadinuju&#x27;s failure to political godfathers; his successor also struggled. On 26 May 2003, Chris Ngige was sworn in as the new governor of the state, but he was removed in March 2006 after Peter Obi of APGA filed charges against him of electoral malpractice. The Court of Appeal in Enugu asserted that Ngige&#x27;s apparent victory in the 2003 election was fraudulent and ordered him to leave the seat.

Obi was ousted by a faction of the Anambra State House of Assembly on 2 November 2006 and replaced by Virginia Etiaba, his deputy. On 9 February 2007, Etiaba handed power back to Obi after the Court of Appeal had nullified Obi&#x27;s removal.

On 14 April 2007, Andy Uba of PDP was &quot;elected&quot; as the new governor of the state and, on 29 May, was sworn in. Reported to be massively rigged, the election was widely criticised. On 14 June 2007 the Supreme Court of Nigeria ruled that Peter Obi&#x27;s tenure had not ended; therefore, there was no vacancy in the governorship. It removed Andy Uba from office and replaced him with his predecessor Obi.

On 6 February 2010, Peter Obi was re-elected governor for a second term of four years, after a hot contest with Chris Ngige, a former governor of the state; Prof. Charles Soludo, a former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria; and Andy Uba, who was a strong voice in the state&#x27;s politics. Other contenders included Mrs Uche Ekwunife, Prince Nicholas Ukachukwu, and many others. Twenty-five contestants ran for the office. Obi was affirmed as the winner of the election, having more than 30% votes above the immediate runner-up. Chief Willie Obiano was sworn in on 17 March 2014 after winning the 16 November 2013 election. Governor Willie Obiano of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) was sworn in for a second term in office on 17 March 2018 after the victory at 18 November 2017 elections. He handed over to Charles Soludo, winner of the 9 November 2021 gubernatorial election in Anambra state on 17 March 2022.

<text>Hugh Blumenfeld (born October 11, 1958) is an American folk musician and singer-songwriter from Connecticut. He was born in Jamaica, Queens, New York City, graduated with degrees in Biology and Humanities from M.I.T. in 1980, and got a master&#x27;s degree in English Literature from the University of Chicago in 1981. He was active in the Greenwich Village music scene in the 1980s, attending the Cornelia Street Songwriters Exchange and performing at Folk City and Speak Easy while working on a PhD in Poetics from New York University. He also helped to edit the &quot;Fast Folk Musical Magazine&quot; (now part of the Smithsonian-Folkways collection) and recorded songs for a dozen issues. After earning his PhD in 1991, he worked as an English professor until 1994, when he began writing and performing full-time. Over the next 10 years he toured mainly in the Northeast and Midwest, with several short tours in Europe and one in Israel. In 1999 he was appointed Connecticut State Troubadour.

In the fall of 2003, he enrolled in medical school at the University of Connecticut and became an MD. He currently practices family medicine in Hartford, Connecticut, and continues to perform as part of a folk quintet, The Faithful Sky with long-time collaborators including Jim Mercik.

== Recordings ==

Blumenfeld&#x27;s first album, &quot;The Strong in Spirit&quot;, was self-released as an LP in late 1987. It featured performances by Lucy Kaplansky, Marshal Rosenberg, Kenny Kosek and Mark Dann, and was produced by David Seitz. It includes &quot;Let Me Fall In Love Before the Spring Comes,&quot; which was later included in on a Winter&#x27;s Night, a popular compilation edited by Christine Lavin. In 1993, &quot;Barehanded&quot; became the first release of the New York-based independent label Prime-CD.

In 1996, Blumenfeld released &quot;Mozart&#x27;s Money&quot;, a more highly produced album that helped him gain a national audience through reviews and indie radio airplay. AllMusic praised it as a leap forwards with its more &quot;confident&quot; and &quot;radio-friendly&quot; sound. Lucy Kaplansky and Mark Dann feature prominently and are joined by Michael Visceglia (of Suzanne Vega&#x27;s band) and Mindy Jostyn. &quot;Rocket Science&quot;, the last of his Prime-CD recordings, came out in 1998; AllMusic noted its &quot;brave&quot;, &quot;bold&quot; and &quot;endearingly honest songs&quot; in a 3/5 review. In 2000, he recorded &quot;Big Red&quot; in Switzerland for the Brambus record label with percussionist Shane Shannahan, who later joined Yo Yo Ma&#x27;s Silk Road Project, and popular Swiss country music singer Doris Ackermann. In 2010, his CD &quot;Dad&quot; was released on Waterbug Records.

<text>The Austric languages are a proposed language family that includes the Austronesian languages spoken in Taiwan, Maritime Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and Madagascar, as well as Kra–Dai and Austroasiatic languages spoken in Mainland Southeast Asia and South Asia. A genetic relationship between these language families is seen as plausible by some scholars, but remains unproven.

Additionally, Hmong–Mien languages are included by some linguists, and even Japanese was speculated to be Austric in an early version of the hypothesis by Paul K. Benedict.

==History==
The Austric macrofamily was first proposed by the German missionary Wilhelm Schmidt in 1906. He showed phonological, morphological, and lexical evidence to support the existence of an Austric phylum consisting of Austroasiatic and Austronesian. Schmidt&#x27;s proposal had a mixed reception among scholars of Southeast Asian languages, and received only little scholarly attention in the following decades.

Research interest into Austric resurged in the late 20th century, culminating in a series of articles by La Vaughn H. Hayes, who presented a corpus of Proto-Austric vocabulary together with a reconstruction of Proto-Austric phonology, and by Lawrence Reid, focussing on morphological evidence.

== Evidence ==
Reid (2005) lists the following pairs as &quot;probable&quot; cognates between Proto-Austroasiatic and Proto-Austronesian.

Among the morphological evidence, he compares reconstructed affixes such as the following, and notes that shared infixes are less likely to be borrowed (for a further discussion of infixes in Southeast Asian languages, see also Barlow 2022).
* prefix *pa- &#x27;causative&#x27; (Proto-Austroasiatic, Proto-Austronesian)
* infix *-um- &#x27;agentive&#x27; (Proto-Austroasiatic, Proto-Austronesian)
* infix *-in- &#x27;instrumental&#x27; (Proto-Austroasiatic), &#x27;nominalizer&#x27; (Proto-Austronesian)

Below are 10 selected Austric lexical comparisons by Diffloth (1994), as cited in Sidwell &amp; Reid (2021):

== Extended proposals ==
The first extension to Austric was first proposed Wilhelm Schmidt himself, who speculated about including Japanese within Austric, mainly because of assumed similarities between Japanese and the Austronesian languages. While the proposal about a link between Austronesian and Japanese still enjoys some following as a separate hypothesis, the inclusion of Japanese was not adopted by later proponents of Austric.

In 1942, Paul K. Benedict provisionally accepted the Austric hypothesis and extended it to include the Kra–Dai (Thai–Kadai) languages as an immediate sister branch to Austronesian, and further speculated on the possibility to include the Hmong–Mien (Miao–Yao) languages as well. However, he later abandoned the Austric proposal in favor of an extended version of the Austro-Tai hypothesis.

Sergei Starostin adopted Benedict&#x27;s extended 1942 version of Austric (i.e. including Kra–Dai and Hmong–Mien) within the framework of his larger Dené–Daic proposal, with Austric as a coordinate branch to Dené–Caucasian, as shown in the tree below.

Another long-range proposal for wider connections of Austric was brought forward by John Bengtson, who grouped Nihali and Ainu together with Austroasiatic, Austronesian, Hmong–Mien, and Kra–Dai in a &quot;Greater Austric&quot; family.

== Reception ==

In the second half of the last century, Paul K. Benedict raised a vocal critique of the Austric proposal, eventually calling it an &#x27;extinct&#x27; proto-language.

Hayes&#x27; lexical comparisons, which were presented as supporting evidence for Austric between 1992 and 2001, were criticized for the greater part as methodologically unsound by several reviewers. Robert Blust, a leading scholar in the field of Austronesian comparative linguistics, pointed out &quot;the radical disjunction of morphological and lexical evidence&quot; which characterizes the Austric proposal; while he accepts the morphological correspondences between Austronesian and Austroasiatic as possible evidence for a remote genetic relationship, he considers the lexical evidence unconvincing.

A 2015 analysis using the Automated Similarity Judgment Program (ASJP) did not support the Austric hypothesis. In this analysis, the supposed &quot;core&quot; components of Austric were assigned to two separate, unrelated clades: Austro-Tai and Austroasiatic-Japonic. Note however that ASJP is not widely accepted among historical linguists as an adequate method to establish or evaluate relationships between language families.

<doc id="905850" wikidata="Q3075270" url="?curid=905850" title="Supermodular function">
<text>In mathematics, a supermodular function is a function on a lattice that, informally, has the property of being characterized by &quot;increasing differences.&quot; Seen from the point of set functions, this can also be viewed as a relationship of &quot;increasing returns&quot;, where adding more elements to a subset increases its valuation. In economics, supermodular functions are often used as a formal expression of complementarity in preferences among goods. Supermodular functions are studied and have applications in game theory, economics, lattice theory, combinatorial optimization, and machine learning.

== Definition ==
Let formula_1 be a lattice. A real-valued function formula_2 is called supermodular if 
formula_3

for all formula_4. 

If the inequality is strict, then formula_5 is strictly supermodular on formula_6. If formula_7 is (strictly) supermodular then &quot;f&quot; is called (strictly) submodular. A function that is both submodular and supermodular is called modular. This corresponds to the inequality being changed to an equality.

We can also define supermodular functions where the underlying lattice is the vector space formula_8. Then the function formula_9 is supermodular if 

formula_10

for all formula_11, formula_12, where formula_13 denotes the componentwise maximum and formula_14 the componentwise minimum of formula_11 and formula_16.

If &quot;f&quot; is twice continuously differentiable, then supermodularity is equivalent to the condition

:formula_17

==Supermodularity in economics and game theory==
The concept of supermodularity is used in the social sciences to analyze how one agent&#x27;s decision affects the incentives of others.

Consider a symmetric game with a smooth payoff function formula_18 defined over actions formula_19 of two or more players formula_20. Suppose the action space is continuous; for simplicity, suppose each action is chosen from an interval: formula_21. In this context, supermodularity of formula_18 implies that an increase in player formula_23&#x27;s choice formula_19 increases the marginal payoff formula_25 of action formula_26 for all other players formula_27. That is, if any player formula_23 chooses a higher formula_19, all other players formula_27 have an incentive to raise their choices formula_26 too. Following the terminology of Bulow, Geanakoplos, and Klemperer (1985), economists call this situation strategic complementarity, because players&#x27; strategies are complements to each other. This is the basic property underlying examples of multiple equilibria in coordination games.

The opposite case of supermodularity of formula_18, called submodularity, corresponds to the situation of strategic substitutability. An increase in formula_19 lowers the marginal payoff to all other player&#x27;s choices formula_26, so strategies are substitutes. That is, if formula_23 chooses a higher formula_19, other players have an incentive to pick a &quot;lower&quot; formula_26.

For example, Bulow et al. consider the interactions of many imperfectly competitive firms. When an increase in output by one firm raises the marginal revenues of the other firms, production decisions are strategic complements. When an increase in output by one firm lowers the marginal revenues of the other firms, production decisions are strategic substitutes.

A supermodular utility function is often related to complementary goods. However, this view is disputed.

==Supermodular set functions==
Supermodularity can also be defined for set functions, which are functions defined over subsets of a larger set. Many properties of submodular set functions can be rephrased to apply to supermodular set functions.

Intuitively, a supermodular function over a set of subsets demonstrates &quot;increasing returns&quot;. This means that if each subset is assigned a real number that corresponds to its value, the value of a subset will always be less than the value of a larger subset which contains it. Alternatively, this means that as we add elements to a set, we increase its value.

=== Definition ===
Let formula_38 be a finite set. A set function formula_39 is supermodular if it satifies the following (equivalent) conditions:

# formula_40 for all formula_41.
# formula_42 for all formula_43, where formula_44.

A set function formula_5 is submodular if formula_7 is supermodular, and modular if it is both supermodular and submodular.

=== Additional Facts ===

* If formula_47 is modular and formula_48 is submodular, then formula_49 is a supermodular function.
* A non-negative supermodular function is also a superadditive function.

== Optimization Techniques ==
There are specialized techniques for optimizing submodular functions. Theory and enumeration algorithms for finding local and global maxima (minima) of submodular (supermodular) functions can be found in &quot;Maximization of submodular functions: Theory and enumeration algorithms&quot;, B. Goldengorin.

<text>Carly Rae Patterson (born February 4, 1988) is an American singer, songwriter and former artistic gymnast. She was the all-around champion at the 2004 Olympics, the first all-around champion for the United States at a non-boycotted Olympics, and is a member of the USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame. Patterson frequently joins radio segments on 1310 AM and 96.7 FM The Ticket in Dallas Fort-Worth.

==Gymnastics==
Patterson began gymnastics after attending a cousin&#x27;s birthday party at a Baton Rouge gymnastics club (Elite Gymnastics) in 1994. She was coached there by former Israeli Olympian Yohanan Moyal. She started competing internationally in 2000, when she was 12 years old.

=== 2000–2003 ===

In 2000, Patterson participated in the Top Gym Tournament in Belgium and won the silver medal in the all-around and the bronze on balance beam. The next year, at the 2001 Goodwill Games in Brisbane, Australia, she was ranked second in the all-around before the final rotation but missed three landings on the floor exercise and finished seventh.

Patterson became the U.S. junior national all-around champion in 2002. She then began her senior career by winning the 2003 American Cup, where she was the youngest competitor, having just turned 15. However, she was forced to sit out the 2003 U.S. National Championships, which would have been her first Nationals as a senior, because of a broken elbow.

Although she could not compete in Nationals, Patterson successfully petitioned to the 2003 World Gymnastics Championships in Anaheim, California. There, she earned the all-around silver medal, becoming the first American woman to medal in a World Championships all-around since Shannon Miller in 1994. She also helped the United States earn the team gold medal, a first for the American women.

=== 2004 ===
Patterson again won the all-around at the American Cup in 2004, a performance she dedicated to her coach Evgeny Marchenko&#x27;s mother, who had died just days before the competition. Later that year, she became co-national champion with Courtney Kupets. She also won the floor exercise at the National Championships and placed second on balance beam.

At the Olympic Trials, Patterson fell off the balance beam on both days of competition, dropping her to third place. However, her performances at a subsequent national training camp were strong enough for her to make the Olympic team.

At the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Patterson finished first overall in the preliminary round and qualified for the all-around and balance beam finals. The United States, including Patterson, struggled in the team final: She under-rotated her vault, stubbed the low bar with her foot on the uneven bars, and had several wobbles on balance beam and a lunge forward on her dismount. She later admitted to being distracted after a rushed start on vault, with her coach saying, &quot;The beginning of the competition was stressful. It set the tone.&quot; The U.S. women, the reigning world champions, settled for silver.

In the individual all-around, Patterson narrowly defeated three-time world all-around champion Svetlana Khorkina of Russia. After scoring lower than usual on the vault (9.375), Patterson was stronger on her last three events, scoring 9.575 on the uneven bars, 9.725 on the balance beam, and 9.712 on the floor exercise. She became only the second American woman to win an Olympic all-around gold medal, and the first to do so in a non-boycotted Olympic Games. (Mary Lou Retton won the title at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. But because those Games were boycotted by the Soviet Union, Retton did not face the Soviet gymnasts who consistently dominated the sport during that period, accounting for five of the eight Olympic all-around champions before 1984 and nine of the ten previous world all-around champions.)

On August 23, Patterson competed in the balance beam event final, where she received a score of 9.775 and won the silver medal behind Cătălina Ponor of Romania.

===Post-Olympics===
Soon after the Olympics, Patterson was diagnosed with several bulging discs in her lower back that had gone unnoticed. She announced her intention to take time off from the sport to rehabilitate her back, but she officially retired in 2006 without ever participating in another major competition. She recalled the decision in a 2009 interview, saying, &quot;I started having some back issues, and honestly, my doctor was like, &#x27;Carly, you really need to stop if you want to be able to walk when you get older.&#x27; ... So I retired and moved on to singing.&quot;

She continues to stay occupied with event appearances, gymnastics-related and otherwise. She also has a number of high-profile corporate sponsorships; she appeared in a Mobile ESPN commercial aired during Super Bowl XL in 2006. She also finished her authorized biography, which was released in April 2006.

In December 2011, she was featured on the TV show &quot;Hollywood at Home&quot;.

===Eponymous skill===
Patterson has one eponymous skill listed in the Code of Points.

===Competitive history===
==Music==
Patterson first expressed interest in becoming a professional singer in a March 2005 interview. On August 21, 2005, she gave an interview on Fox Sports Net&#x27;s Sports Sunday in which she gave more details on her future career. She sang a small segment of &quot;Damaged&quot; and said that she went to New York City to record the demo. On December 18, 2005, she announced that she signed a demo contract for four songs with Papa Joe&#x27;s Records, owned by Joe Simpson, father of Jessica and Ashlee Simpson. She worked with singer and writer Chris Megert. They wrote and produced songs titled &quot;Time to Wake Up&quot; and &quot;Lost in Me&quot;.

===&quot;Celebrity Duets&quot;===
On August 29, 2006, she started her appearance on the show &quot;Celebrity Duets&quot;. The program was a reality competition show executive produced by Simon Cowell. Celebrities not known for singing were teamed up with professional singers; one of the eight celebrities was voted off each week. The show aired every Thursday on Fox with a results show each Friday, from September 7, 2006, to October 13, 2006.

On September 15, 2006, during the results show, Patterson was eliminated from the competition (singing with Jesse McCartney). Patterson said that she would continue to sing. She also encouraged the audience to continue voting for the remaining celebrities because each vote raised money for charity.

===Recording===
On February 4, 2008, Patterson signed a recording contract with MusicMind Records, a Chicago-based label. Her single &quot;Temporary Life (Ordinary Girl)&quot; was released on iTunes on March 25, 2008. Her debut album &quot;Back to the Beginning&quot; was scheduled for release August 5, 2008. However, the CD was not released until more than a year later, on August 25, 2009, and in the interim, Patterson released another single, &quot;Time to Wake Up&quot;, on iTunes on February 19, 2009.

On September 10, 2008, a remixed version of Patterson&#x27;s &quot;Temporary Life (Ordinary Girl)&quot; was played on the &quot;Bobby Bones Show&quot;. The mixed version featured the new artist Captain Caucasian, a pseudonym for Bobby Bones.

Patterson&#x27;s song &quot;Here I Am&quot; was featured on the second season of the ABC Family series &quot;Make It or Break It&quot;, which focused on the lives of teen gymnasts striving to make it to the Olympic Games.

==Personal life==
On January 21, 2012, Patterson became engaged to strategy consultant Mark Caldwell. They married on November 3, 2012, in Dallas, Texas. They have three children.

==Honors and awards==
Patterson was chosen for the USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame in 2009. She was inducted to the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame as a member of the Class of 2024.

It is separated from the main roads with a barrier around the platforms. Yet having a rather complicated structure with many bus platforms, the transfer center is built in a simple manner as it is not a separate terminal building.

==History==
The former Seoul station, Namdaemun Station, started operating in a 33 m2 (10 pyeong) wooden building in July 1900 with the extension of the Gyeongin Line north of the Han River. The Gyeongbu Line opened in 1905, and the Gyeongui Line opened in 1921 – both lines connecting to the station. The construction of the current &quot;Old Seoul Station&quot; began on June 1, 1922, and was finished on September 30, 1925. In 1923, the station reverted to the name &quot;Gyeongseong Station,&quot; when the name of the city of Seoul changed from Hanseong to Gyeongseong (&quot;Keijō&quot; in Japanese).

The station was renamed &quot;Seoul Station&quot; on November 1, 1947. The station was expanded throughout the post-Korean War era; the Southern Annex of Seoul Station was completed on December 30, 1957, and the Western Annex was completed on February 14, 1969. In 1975, the Korea National Railroad&#x27;s office moved from Seoul Station to the new West Annex office. A raised walkway connecting the Seoul Station and the West Annex was completed in 1977, and Korea&#x27;s first privately funded station was erected in 1988 in time for the Seoul Olympics. In 2004, a new terminal adjacent to the existing one was completed to coincide with the introduction of KTX high-speed rail service.

==Old Seoul Station==
The old Seoul Station (, literally meaning &quot;old Seoul Station building&quot;), also known as &quot;Culture Station Seoul 284&quot; (), originally named Keijō (Gyeongseong) station and designed by Tsukamoto Yasushi of Tokyo Imperial University, was finished in November 1925. This red brick building, designed in an eclectic style, features a Byzantine-style central dome and a centralized and symmetrical layout. The floor of the Central Hall on the ground floor was covered with granite and the walls were covered with man-made stone. The wooden floor inside the building&#x27;s VIP Lounge was covered with birch wood and a western style restaurant was located on the 2nd floor.

On September 25, 1981, the old station was designated as Historic Site 284. A restoration project of the old station began in September 2007 to &quot;transform the former Seoul Station, which had lost its functionality as a train station since the opening of the new KTX station, into a premier national multidisciplinary cultural facility&quot;. On the same year, the management was transferred from the Cultural Heritage Administration to the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism. After the design for former Seoul Station&#x27;s remodeling was developed in 2009, the remodeling construction began.

On August 9, 2011, the station was reopened as a culture complex with its original exterior, after a two-year restoration project by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and the state-run Korea Craft and Design Foundation (KCDF). On April 2, 2012, &quot;Culture Seoul Station 284&quot; was officially launched &quot;as a space for diverse artistic and cultural creation and exchange&quot;. The official name, which combines the station&#x27;s historic, spatial, and urban symbolisms, was selected through a national open call. By combining the notion of a cultural space with the old Seoul Station&#x27;s historic site number 284, the name aims to embody the concepts of preserving its appearance and value as a historic site while simultaneously cultivating the meaning of the station as a place of various cultural intersections. The restored station is a 9,202m2 building with two stories above ground and one story below ground level. The former station, before the renovation, has the main lobby, a waiting room, and a VIP room on the first floor, and a barber shop and restaurants on the second floor. Post-renovation, the first floor contains a venue for performances, exhibitions and events, and a multipurpose hall on the floor above.

<doc id="905857" wikidata="Q739676" url="?curid=905857" title="Cross River State">
<text>Cross River State is a state in the South-South geopolitical zone of Nigeria. Named for the Cross River, the state was formed from the eastern part of the Eastern Region on 27 May 1967. The state has its capital as Calabar and is bordered to the north by Benue State, to the west by Ebonyi State and Abia State, and to the southwest by Akwa Ibom State while its eastern border forms part of the national border with Cameroon. Originally known as the [[South-Eastern State, Nigeria|South-Eastern State]] before being renamed in 1976, Cross River state formerly included the area that is now Akwa Ibom State, which became a distinct state in 1987.

Of the 36 states, Cross River is the nineteenth largest in area and 27th most populous with an estimated population of over 3.8 million as of 2016. Geographically, the state is mainly divided between the Guinean forest–savanna mosaic in the far north and the Cross–Sanaga–Bioko coastal forests in the majority of the interior of the state. The smaller ecoregions are the Central African mangroves in the coastal far south and a part of the montane Cameroonian Highlands forests in the extreme northeast. The most major geographical feature is the state&#x27;s namesake, the Cross River which bisects Cross River State&#x27;s interior before forming much of the state&#x27;s western border and flowing into the Cross River Estuary. Other important rivers are the Calabar and Great Kwa rivers which flow from the inland Oban Hills before flanking the city of Calabar and flowing into the Cross River Estuary as well. In the forested interior of the state are several biodiverse protected areas including the Cross River National Park, Afi Mountain Wildlife Sanctuary, and Mbe Mountains Community Forest. These wildlife reserves contain populations of Preuss&#x27;s red colobus, African forest buffalo, bat hawk, tree pangolin, grey-necked rockfowl, and West African slender-snouted crocodile along with some of Nigeria&#x27;s last remaining Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee, drill, African forest elephant, and Cross River gorilla populations.

Demographically, Cross River State is inhabited by several ethnic groups, primarily the Efik of the riverside south and Calabar; the Ekoi (Ejagham) of the inland south; the Akunakuna, Boki, Bahumono, and Yakö (Yakurr) of the central region; and the Bekwarra, Bette, Igede, and Ukelle (Kukele) of the northern region. In the pre-colonial period, what is now Cross River State was divided between its ethnic groups with some joining the Aro Confederacy while the Efik founded the Akwa Akpa (Old Calabar) city-state. The latter become a British protectorate in 1884 as the capital of the Oil Rivers Protectorate but it was not until the early 1900s that the British actually gained formal control of the entire area. Around the same time, the protectorate (now renamed the Niger Coast Protectorate) was incorporated into the Southern Nigeria Protectorate which later merged into British Nigeria. After the merger, much of modern-day Cross River became a centre of anti-colonial resistance during the Women&#x27;s War and trade through the international seaport at Calabar.

After independence in 1960, the area of now-Cross River was a part of the post-independence Eastern Region until 1967 when the region was split and the area became part of the South-Eastern State. Less than two months afterwards, the Igbo-majority former Eastern Region attempted to secede as the state of Biafra; in the three-year long Nigerian Civil War, Calabar and its port was hard fought over in Operation Tiger Claw while people from Cross River were persecuted by Biafran forces as they were mainly non-Igbo. At the war&#x27;s end and the reunification of Nigeria, the South-Eastern State was reformed until 1976 when it was renamed Cross River State. Eleven years later, Cross River State was divided with western Cross River being broken off to form the new Akwa Ibom State. The state formerly contained the oil-producing Bakassi Peninsula, but it was ceded to Cameroon under the terms of the Greentree Agreement.

As an agricultural state, the Cross River&#x27;s economy partially relies on crops, such as cocoyam, rubber, oil palm, yam, cocoa, cashews, and plantain crops, along with fishing. Key minor industries involve tourism in and around the wildlife reserves along with the historic Ikom Monoliths site, Calabar Carnival, and Obudu Mountain Resort. Cross River state has the joint-thirteenth highest Human Development Index in the country and numerous institutions of tertiary education.

== History ==
Cross River as a south-south state was created on 27 May 1967 from the former Eastern Region, Nigeria, by the General Yakubu Gowon regime. Its name was changed to Cross River state in the 1976 state creation exercise by the then General Murtala Mohammed regime from South Eastern State.The present-day Akwa Ibom State was excised from it in the state creation exercise of September 1987 by the then regime of General Ibrahim Babangida. The struggle for a new state creation started in 1980 in the reign of president Shehu Shagari where Senator Joseph Oqua Ansa (Mon) the senator representing Calabar senatorial district then was at the helm of affairs. Its capital is Calabar. Its major towns are Calabar Municipality, Akamkpa, Biase, Calabar South, Ikom, Igede, Obubra, Odukpani, Ogoja, Bekwarra, Ugep, Obudu, Obanliku, Akpabuyo, Ofutop, Iso-bendghe, Danare, Boki, Yala, Bendeghe Ekiem, Etomi, Ediba, Itigidi, Ugep, Ukpe and Ukelle.

<doc id="905858" wikidata="Q175794" url="?curid=905858" title="Ford LTD (Americas)">
<text>The Ford LTD (pronounced ) is a range of automobiles manufactured by Ford for the 1965 to 1986 model years. Introduced as the highest trim level of the full-size Ford model range (then the Ford Galaxie 500), the LTD moved the Ford range upmarket, offering options and features previously reserved for Mercury and Lincoln vehicles. For much of its production life, the LTD competed against the Chevrolet Caprice (atop the Chevrolet Impala); the Mercury Marquis served as its divisional counterpart from 1967 until 1986.

For its first three generations, the LTD served as the largest Ford vehicle in North America. Initially debuting as a two-door and four-door hardtop sedans, the LTD range at various times would also include two-door and four-door pillared sedans, a two-door convertible, and a five-door station wagon (in woodgrain trim, as the LTD Country Squire). In South America, Ford manufactured the 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 into the 1980s using the Ford LTD nameplate. 

From 1977 to 1979, the full-size LTD was joined by the intermediate-segment Ford LTD II (replacing the Ford Torino/Gran Torino range). For 1979, the LTD was downsized; while remaining a full-size car, it became externally smaller than the LTD II. For 1983, the LTD became a mid-size car as it replaced the Ford Granada, with the previous full-size car renamed the Ford LTD Crown Victoria (renamed Ford Crown Victoria for 1992). 

For 1986, the mid-size LTD was replaced by the Ford Taurus as Ford expanded its use of front-wheel drive vehicles, with both lines sold for 1986. 

==Etymology==
Nearly 40 years after its discontinuation in North America, the meaning of the LTD designation has never received a full explanation, with several theories behind its meaning. 

For the first generation, LTD was speculated to be an abbreviation of either &quot;Luxury Trim Decor&quot; or &quot;Limited&quot; trim designation for the Galaxie 500 (where served as a luxury-oriented trim level). In the early 1970s, Ford Australia (which had introduced the LTD name on RHD-converted Galaxies in 1969, moving it to locally-produced Fairlanes in mid-1973) had adapted the moniker as &quot;Lincoln Type Design&quot;, to build up Lincoln-like exclusivity and design influence of its Falcon-based LTD luxury car (As of current production, Lincoln has never been sold in Australia on an official basis). 

In North American sales literature, there is no evidence of LTD used as &quot;Lincoln Type Design&quot; or as an abbreviation for anything else in brochures or advertising copy. The original &quot;Car Life&quot; review at the time the first Galaxie 500 LTD was released suggests that &quot;LTD&quot; stood for nothing and was ambiguous in meaning.

==First generation (1965–1968)==
For the 1965 model year, Ford introduced an all-new design for its full-size model range. To further expand its flagship Galaxie 500 series, the 500 LTD was introduced. Sharing top billing within the Galaxie series with the performance 500XL, the 500 LTD was designed as a luxury-oriented vehicle, offering many features of more expensive vehicles under the lower price of the Ford nameplate. It featured a plush cloth interior with woodgrain accents, along with contoured seats and door panels not found on other full size Ford models. Options included power windows, power driver&#x27;s seat, power brakes, power steering, air conditioning, and a full or half-vinyl top (called a Landau roof or Brougham interchangeably by various manufacturers). The Galaxie 500 LTD was offered in two body styles: a two-door hardtop and a four-door hardtop.

The launch of the LTD triggered responses from rivals, starting with a mid-year introduction by Chevrolet of its top of the line Caprice. AMC brought out the Ambassador DPL in 1966, Plymouth the Fury VIP, and Dodge the Monaco.

For 1966, the Galaxie name was dropped from the LTD. As with the Galaxie line, the LTD received a minor exterior revision, including a split grille. Front disc brakes became an option.

For 1967, the LTD underwent several changes, with a four-door pillared sedan joining the model range. To comply with federally-mandated safety regulations, the LTD received a padded steering wheel center hub, non-protruding instrument panel knobs, a dual-circuit brake master cylinder, four-way hazard flashers, and front outboard shoulder belt mounting points. While the roofline of the four-door hardtop saw minor styling revisions, the two-door hardtop saw extensive changes, giving it a formal profile. Twin Comfort Lounge front seats (a 50/50 split bench seat) became an option. In various forms, the configuration would be adopted by American automakers into the early 2000s. Lincoln-Mercury added the Marquis two-door hardtop as its comparable top of range model.

Serving largely as a preview of the upcoming major redesign, the 1968 LTD adopted several minor revisions of its own. For the first time, the LTD badge was added to the wood-trimmed Country Squire station wagon (as part of the distinct Ford station wagon series, it did not fully adopt the LTD name until 1969).

While the two-door hardtop saw slight changes to its roofline, four-door hardtops were restyled to more closely match their two-door counterparts, with the rear doors receiving more curves to their greenhouse. The vertically stacked headlamps introduced in 1965 were replaced by a hidden headlamps; shared with Lincoln-Mercury, the configuration would be a design feature denoting the top-trim LTD until 1971. The system was operated by engine vacuum, with the headlamp doors retracting upwards in the case of failure.

The model year also saw further changes to comply with safety regulations. Along with the addition of side marker lights and reflectors, the parking lights illuminated with the headlights; front outboard shoulder belts were fitted to cars built effective January 1, 1968. The padded steering wheel was replaced, following the addition of an energy-absorbing steering column.

== Second generation (1969–1978)==
The LTD was given a major redesign for the 1969 model year. It shared a largely carryover chassis with all full-size Ford sedans, with the wheelbase lengthened by two inches.

=== Timeline ===
1969: Ford LTD is given a redesign. The hidden headlights and formal roofline introduced in 1967 are retained. An all-new body features a split grille with a horizontal center divider (shared with XLs and Country Squires).
*1970: The split grille was discontinued, replaced by a three-segment grille with a prominent center section, a modified version of the 1970 Ford Thunderbird and Continental Mark III. All LTDs got a new federally-mandated locking steering column and wheel, with the ignition switch located on the right side of the column. For model year 1970 the LTD received a LTD Brougham luxury trim package, which came with optional equipment on other LTD models as standard, and was offered on the four-door sedan, four-door hardtop, and two-door hardtop; all received a padded black vinyl roof.
*1971: The LTD was given a styling update. In the rear, the long-running Ford look of twin round or square &quot;jet exhaust&quot; taillights was replaced by horizontal taillights on all full-size Fords. In between was a center &quot;third&quot; brakelight, rather than the alloy trim panel on the Galaxie 500 or body-color trim of the Custom 500s. In front, the LTD lost its hidden headlamps, but got a new front end treatment with a tall center grille section and &quot;LTD&quot; spelled out in block letters on the hood. With the discontinuation of the XL series, the convertible was moved to the LTD line. These were produced with bucket seats and center consoles; the console was similar to the console in the XLs and Mercury Marauders of 1969–1970, with a &quot;stirrup&quot; style shift handle.

*1972: There was little change. The front bumper now stretched across the lower section of the grille. A new rear bumper integrated the taillights; also in the rear, the design of the trunk lid was squared off. Due to decreased demand in the segment, 1972 was the final model year for the LTD convertible.
*1973: The LTD was given a major redesign for the model year in order to comply with federal regulations. The requirements for 5-mph front bumpers had taken effect, with larger rear bumpers to follow in 1974. While the redesign slightly decreased the weight of the LTD, it still was far in excess of two tons, making agility and fuel economy both key weak points. The new styling was bulkier, making the car look significantly larger and heavier than previous models. Four-door models (which shared rooflines with Mercury) were given thin B-pillars for roof reinforcement and branded as &quot;pillared hardtops&quot; (but retained the frameless door glass of all LTD models).
*1974: Mostly carryover from the 1973 model year. Five-mph bumpers were added to the rear. The 460 engine became an option for the first time. Mid-year, a non-woodgrain LTD wagon became available. A new Federal law required seat belts to be buckled before the starter would operate; public protests prompted the government to relax this requirement. Subsequent models got a simple &quot;Fasten Seat Belt&quot; warning light and buzzer for 1975, and owners were now permitted to disable the starter interlock on their 1974s.
*1975: Following the discontinuation of the Galaxie series after 1974, Ford sought to fill its place by expanding the LTD trim lineup. Above the Custom 500 was the standard LTD, the LTD Brougham, and newly introduced for 1975, the LTD Landau. In an effort to comply with pending rollover standards (as well as to differentiate it from the Mercury Marquis), the two-door was converted from a hardtop to a coupe with wide B-pillars and a tall, narrow &quot;opera window&quot; (Chevrolet did the same thing with the 1974 Caprice Coupe). More or less the Ford counterpart to the Mercury Grand Marquis, the LTD Landau featured rear fender skirts and various decor packages for additional luxury; it was distinguished by the return of hidden headlamps (exclusive to its trim level). Hidden headlamps were also shared with the LTD Country Squire wagon. The 429 engine was replaced by the 460 V8 sourced from Lincoln-Mercury for 1975. A catalytic converter now required the use of unleaded fuel, and the gas gauge and fuel filler sported warnings to this effect.
*1976: Four-wheel disc brakes and 8-track were optional. Last year for LTD Brougham trim level.
*1977: Since the LTD Brougham had been discontinued, the LTD Landau received the former Brougham interior as the base offering. Optional interiors, including the LTD Landau Luxury Group, were still available.
*1978: Final year for 121-inch wheelbase LTD, as it is replaced by the downsized Panther-platform generation LTD for 1979.
1973–1978 Ford LTD Police Package &amp; Police Interceptor Package: 1973–1978, Police Package contained a 351/400 CID motor for city patrol cars, while the 460 Police Interceptor was for heavy Duty and high Speed use. The 460 Police Interceptor motor was rated at 260 Net horsepower and capable of 0-60 times in the 8 second range. Quarter mile times in the upper 15 second bracket, and top speeds in excess of 135 Mph. 1975-1978 Ford LTD 460 Police Interceptor &quot;C code&quot;

Approximately 7,850,000 full-size Fords and Mercurys were sold over the 1969–1978 period. This makes it the second best selling Ford automobile platform after the Ford Model T.
===Mechanical Details===
For the first time since the 1940s, the full-size Ford line was powered exclusively by V8 engines. The base engine was the 302 cid V8. The next largest engine was Ford&#x27;s 351 CID V8, the most common choice. Still larger was Ford&#x27;s 400 CID V8. Topping the range was the 429 cid V8, which was replaced by the 460 CID V8 for 1974. The full-sized Fords remained strong sellers each year during this period, due to their high comfort, sound engines, good build quality and reasonable cost.

===LTD II===

When Ford updated its mid-size product line for 1977, they took on the LTD name as well. To differentiate them from the full-size product lineup, the mid-size cars were called the LTD II in an attempt to appeal to buyers as a downsized alternative to the full-sized LTD which had competition from GM&#x27;s newly downsized full-sized cars. The LTD II was based on the Ford Torino and served as a restyled replacement for it. The LTD II styling was also adapted to update the final generation of the Ford Ranchero. The LTD II was discontinued after 1979 without being replaced, as the new Panther-platform LTD was nearly a foot shorter than an LTD II and the Granada became Ford&#x27;s mid-size product line with its 1981 redesign. 
==Third generation (1979–1982)==

=== Background ===
For the 1977 model year, General Motors became the first American auto manufacturer to introduce downsized full-size sedans, with its B-body and C-body full-size sedans adopting a smaller exterior footprint than their A-body intermediates. With its own downsized full-size product lines remaining two years away, Ford responded by introducing the &quot;Trim Size&quot; Ford LTD II, a substantial exterior revision of the Torino/Gran Torino, nearly matching the Chevrolet Caprice in its exterior dimensions. To appeal to buyers skeptical of downsized full-size cars, Ford advertisements compared the 1977 LTD compared its dimensions side by-side with the GM Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham flagship sedan. 

The third-generation 1979 Ford LTD began production on July 31, 1978 at Louisville Assembly, with Atlanta Assembly, Los Angeles Assembly, and Oakville Assembly coming online during August. The LTD was offered as two-door and four-door pillared sedans (replacing the previous 4-door pillared hardtop) with a 5-door station wagon (with the wood-paneled Country Squire returning). In the United States, the Custom 500 was discontinued entirely, with the nameplate offered as the base-trim model in Canada through the 1981 model year. Lincoln introduced its downsized Continental for 1980, becoming the final brand to introduce downsized full-size cars. 

Alongside the Mercury Marquis, the LTD marked the launch of the rear-wheel drive Ford Panther platform. In line with the GM downsizing, the Panther platform introduced trimmer body profiles, better handling (from lower curb weight), and better fuel economy (to comply with the introduction of CAFE standards). In contrast to the Chrysler R platform (a rebody of chassis underpinnings dating to 1962), the Panther chassis was a completely new design. 

=== Model overview ===
In comparison to its 1978 predecessor, the 1979 LTD shed approximately 15 inches of body length and 7 inches of wheelbase; (dependent on powertrain) the Panther chassis shed over 700 pounds in curb weight. While slightly narrower overall, the smaller body led to increased interior and trunk space. 

The powertrain lineup saw several changes; while the 302 V8 was again standard with a 351 optional (with Ford now advertising metric 5.0 L and 5.8 L displacements), the lighter chassis negated the need for the big-block 6.6 L and 7.5 L V8 options. For 1981, a 4.2 L variant of the 5.0 L V8 was made standard (intended to further improve CAFE fuel economy), with the larger V8s remaining as a options. However, the 4.2 L V8 was rated for only 115 hp (the lowest since the 1953 Flathead 239 V8). In contrast to Chrysler and General Motors, Panther-chassis vehicles retained V8 engines as standard equipment, forgoing diesel engines or V6/I6 engines. 

Adopting the sharp-edged styling of the (smaller) Ford Fairmont, the 1979 LTD shed its optional hidden headlamps; all versions adopted exposed rectangular headlamps besides a much wider grille. Base-trim examples were fitted with dual headlamps and clear parking lamp lenses; higher-trim versions used quad headlamps with amber lenses. 1979 was the only year the standard LTD was fitted with a hood ornament. 

For 1980, trim levels were revised, with the base trim becoming the LTD S (intended for fleet sales, effectively replacing the Custom 500), the standard LTD as the mid-range trim, and the flagship LTD Landau renamed as the LTD Crown Victoria. The Ford equivalent of the Mercury Grand Marquis, the LTD Crown Victoria drew its name from a brushed aluminum band covering the B-pillar and the roof (influenced by its 1950s Ford Fairlane namesake). The Lincoln-style hood ornament of 1979 was replaced by a horizontal design used through 1987 (used only on LTD Crown Victoria trims). The 5.0 L V8 received an optional 4-speed overdrive automatic transmission (exclusive to the Panther chassis at the time). 

For 1981, alongside the addition of the 4.2-liter V8, the body underwent minor revisions to improve fuel economy. The vents in the front bumpers were removed (shifting the license plate mount under the left headlamp) and the sideview mirrors were repositioned (leading to the return of vent windows as an option). In another change, the 5.0 L V8 received optional throttle-body fuel injection (introduced in 1980 for Lincoln).

For 1982, the LTD saw the addition of the Ford Blue Oval emblem on the grille and trunklid (replacing &quot;FORD&quot; badging). To aid in tracking fuel consumption, a trip computer was added as an option. The standard-equipment 4.2 L V8 was in its final year, with Ford dropping the 5.8 L V8 from retail sale (now sold exclusively with police cars). Alongside the Motorcraft 7200VV two-barrel variable venturi carburetor; Ford introduced a conventional carburetor for the 5.8 L HO V8 (for police cars). For all three engines, the 4-speed AOD overdrive transmission was now standard.

==Fourth generation (1983–1986)==
From 1981 to 1983, Ford underwent a major revision of its full-size and mid-size product lines, involving all three of its divisions. For the 1983 model year, the LTD and LTD Crown Victoria split into distinct product lines. The latter became the full-size Ford sedan range (alongside the LTD Country Squire), with the LTD nameplate effectively replacing the Ford Granada (and Mercury Monarch) in a mid-cycle model revision. In line with Ford, the Mercury Marquis and Grand Marquis were also split into distinct product lines; replacing the Cougar (sedan and wagon), the Marquis became the counterpart of the repackaged LTD. The more aerodynamic design had a slanted nose and a large greenhouse; drag resistance was down to .

Shedding nearly 13 inches of length, 9 inches of wheelbase, 7 inches of width, and over 600 pounds of curb weight (dependent on powertrain), the 1983 LTD underwent nearly the same reduction in size as its 1979 predecessor, although this downsizing came as the result of re-marketing a stronger-selling nameplate for a slow-selling model line. Ultimately, the LTD became the third-best selling automobile in the US for 1983 and 1984.

The chassis was also overhauled and now featured nitrogen-charged shocks and struts and larger wheels. The buyer received a standard split-bench front seats, while fabric coverings replaced much of the vinyl from the Granada. Ford recycled the use of the 1980–1982 Thunderbird instrument panel for the new LTD including the optional digital instrumentation. Ford&#x27;s &quot;Tripminder&quot; trip computer was a novel option, allowing the driver to monitor fuel consumption, average speed, and various other functions.

=== Model overview ===
Sharing the mid-size version of the Fox platform with its Granada predecessor, the fourth-generation LTD has a 105.6-inch wheelbase. In contrast to both the Granada and the full-size LTD, the fourth-generation LTD was sold as a four-door sedan and a five-door station wagon (no two-door versions were offered). Alongside the base-trim sedan and wagon (the only versions available for the first model year), the LTD Brougham trim made its return, along with a LTD Squire wood-trimmed wagon.

For its 1983 launch, the LTD retained two engines from the Granada: a 2.3-liter &quot;Lima&quot; inline-four (not available as a wagon) and a 3.3-liter &quot;Falcon Six&quot; inline-six. Also inherited from the Granada was a 3.8-liter &quot;Essex&quot; V6 with , which replaced the inline-six entirely for 1984. For 1984, both engines gained central point fuel injection in the United States (the Canadian-market V6 remained carbureted until 1986). A rare option, seen only in 1982–1984, was an LPG (propane)-powered version of the four-cylinder engine; it was largely discontinued due to poor sales and lack of propane fueling infrastructure. The four-cylinder was a slow seller throughout; Ford kept offering it for the duration of production but in 1986 only 485 four-cylinder LTDs were sold, representing 0.7 percent of overall LTD/Squire sales for the year.

For the first time since 1971, the LTD was offered with a manual transmission; a three-speed automatic was optional on the 2.3 and standard on the 3.3-liter engine. The larger 3.8 was only offered with the overdrive four-speed automatic.

For the 1985 model year, the LTD underwent a minor model revision. Along with minor changes to the taillamps, the LTD received a new grille, distinguished by a centered Ford Blue Oval emblem. 1986 models are identifiable by the addition of a federally-mandated CHMSL (center brake lamp).

===LTD LX (1984–1985)===
From the mid-1984 model year and throughout the 1985 model year, Ford offered a performance version of the LTD, marketed as the &quot;LTD LX&quot;. It came standard with a high-output 5.0 L CFI V8 engine, four-speed automatic transmission with overdrive, 600 lb-in front and 270 lb-in rear coil springs, front and rear sway bars, 10 inch front disc and 10 inch rear drum brakes, and a 3.27:1 rear gear ratio with a Traction-Lok differential. 

The LX was the only LTD of this generation to have a tachometer in the instrument cluster (1977–1979 LTD IIs had an optional tachometer). The center console and floor-mounted shifter re-appeared, having last been available in the full-size 1972 model year and mid-size LTD IIs from 1977 through 1979 model years. Most available sources state that 3,260 units were produced, but Ford themselves have confirmed that 5,287 were built - 1,920 in 1984 and 3,367 in 1985. 

Mercury&#x27;s counterpart to the LX, the Marquis LTS, was available only in Canada and only in the 1985 model year, with 134 produced.

=== Police package ===
A police package of the mid-size LTD was produced. Featuring bigger sway bars and brakes, it also included bench seats with an automatic trunk opener located underneath the steering wheel. They were a factory option and most were equipped with light bars and police accessories, although some came without.

== Discontinuation ==
As the 1980s progressed, American auto manufacturers expanded their use of front-wheel drive from compact cars to mid-size cars (downsizing had rendered the previous intermediate segment obsolete). Following the success of the Chrysler K-Cars and the General Motors A-body sedans, Japanese manufacturers introduced sedans (at the smaller size of the segment), catering primarily towards North America, the Honda Accord sedan and Toyota Camry; by 1984, Ford was the last major manufacturer (non-premium brand) left marketing a mid-size sedan with rear-wheel drive.

For 1986, Ford introduced the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable to replace the Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis. Beginning life as the replacement for the full-size LTD Crown Victoria, the mid-size Taurus not only was front-wheel drive, but its exterior was designed to optimize fuel efficiency, replacing the boxy LTD with one of the most aerodynamic sedans in the world. To transition potential Ford buyers into the massive model change, Ford continued the LTD into the 1986 model year, marketing it alongside its replacement. 

Atlanta Assembly produced its final LTD on December 13, 1985 (13 days before the Taurus was unveiled); Chicago Assembly produced the final example on January 3, 1986.

Production Figures:

==Brazil==

The LTD was built locally in Brazil between 1967 and 1981, based on the 1966 Galaxie platform. An upper version called Landau was assembled locally as well, between 1971 and 1983.
 Later models were alcohol-powered.

==Venezuela==
The LTD was introduced to the Venezuelan market in 1966, aiming to compete with Chrysler&#x27;s New Yorker, with the LTD performing much better than its rivals. Over 85,000 LTDs were assembled in the Ford plant of Valencia, Venezuela, some for export to Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru.

Versions of the North American Fox-body 1983–1986 LTD manufactured in Venezuela continued the use of the Granada name complete with uplevel Elite badged versions. There was also a Ford Cougar equivalent to the North American Mercury Marquis.

<doc id="905861" wikidata="Q3844044" url="?curid=905861" title="Malvina Hoffman">
<text>Malvina Cornell Hoffman (June 15, 1885July 10, 1966) was an American sculptor and author, well known for her life-size bronze sculptures of people. She also worked in plaster and marble. Hoffman created portrait busts of working-class people and significant individuals. She was particularly known for her sculptures of dancers, such as Anna Pavlova. Her sculpture series of culturally diverse people, entitled &quot;Hall of the Races of Mankind&quot;, was a popular permanent exhibition at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. It was featured at the Century of Progress International Exposition at the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair of 1933.

She was commissioned to execute commemorative monuments and was awarded many prizes and honors, including a membership to the National Sculpture Society. In 1925, she was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member and became a full Academician in 1931. Many of her portraits of individuals are among the collection of the New York Historical Society. She maintained a salon, a social gathering of artistic and personal acquaintances, at her Sniffen Court studio for many years.

She was highly skilled in foundry techniques, often casting her own works. Hoffman published a definitive work on historical and technical aspects of bronze casting, &quot;Sculpture Inside and Out&quot;, in 1939.

== Early life and education ==
Malvina Hoffman was born in New York City, the fourth of six children of the concert pianist and composer, Richard Hoffman, and Fidelia Marshall (Lamson) Hoffman. She was named after a maternal aunt, Malvina Helen (Lamson) Cornell, who would later survive the sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;. Her mother, also a pianist, presided over her education at home until she was 10 years of age. The Hoffman&#x27;s regularly entertained artists and musicians in their home. As a young girl, she met Swami Vivekananda when he lived and taught in New York City, and several of her later sculptures, like that of Sri Ramakrishna, are located at the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center of New York.

Hoffman attended Veltin School for Girls, Chapin, and Brearley private schools. While at Brearley, she took evening classes at the Woman&#x27;s School for Applied Design and the Art Students League of New York.

She studied painting with John White Alexander in 1906, and also with Harper Pennington. Hoffman developed her skill as an artist during her studies with George Grey Barnard, Herbert Adams, and Gutzon Borglum. She worked as an assistant to sculptor Alexander Phimister Proctor at his MacDougal Street studio in Greenwich Village in 1907. In 1908, Hoffman traveled to Paris with Katharine Rhoades and Marion H. Beckett and studied art there.

In 1909 she made a bust of her father, her first finished sculpture, two weeks prior to his death. It was exhibited at the National Academy the following year. Also in 1910, she won an honorable mention for a sculpture of her future husband, Samuel Grimson, at the Paris Salon. Hoffman gravitated towards sculpture due to the artistic freedom she felt when creating a three-dimensional work of art.
After her father&#x27;s death in 1910, Hoffman moved to Europe with her mother. They first visited London, where they attended the ballet of Alexander Glazunov&#x27;s &quot;Autumn Bacchanale&quot;. Hoffman was inspired by the combination of motion and control exhibited by Mikhail Mordkin and Anna Pavlova. Mother and daughter visited Italy before moving to Paris. She worked as a studio assistant for Janet Scudder. During the nights she studied at Académie Colarossi. She studied with Emanuele Rosales and after five unsuccessful attempts, she eventually was accepted as a student by Auguste Rodin. She caught his attention when she quoted a poem that he attempted to remember by Alfred de Musset. During their lessons, he advised her, &quot;Do not be afraid of realism&quot;. She made a trip to Manhattan in 1912 to dissect bodies at the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University. From Rosales and Rodin, she learned about bronze casting, chasing, and finishing at foundries. The Hoffman women lived in Paris until the outbreak of World War I in 1914. In 1912, Hoffman, with her friend and fellow artist, the suffragist Ida Sedwick Proper, staged an independent exhibition of their own work.

== Career ==
=== Dancers ===
Hoffman became famous internationally for her sculptures of ballet dancers, such as Vaslav Nijinsky and Anna Pavlova, who often posed for her. In 1911, she made &quot;Russian Dancers&quot;, which was exhibited that year at the National Academy and the following year at the Paris Salon. She made a plaster bust, the last work she made of Pavlova, in 1923. Hoffman also created friezes and other works that captured the movements of dancers. In 1912, she made &quot;Bacchanale Russe&quot;. In 1917, a version of it won the National Academy&#x27;s Julia A. Shaw Memorial Prize and the next year a large casting of the sculpture was on display in Paris at the Luxembourg Gardens. She has been called &quot;America&#x27;s Rodin&quot;. 

=== World War I ===
Hoffman helped to organize, and was the American representative, for the French war charity, &quot;Appui aux Artistes&quot; that assisted needy artists. She also organized the American-Yugoslav relief fund for children. While working for the Red Cross during World War I, Hoffman traveled to Serbia. She made a larger-than-life-sized work of Croatian sculptor Ivan Meštrović, with whom she studied.
Her sister, Helen, was on the board of the Red Cross, which sent clothing and medical supplies for the Serbian cause. Through her sister, she met Serbian Colonel Milan Pribićević in 1916, who inspired her when he came to the United States and delivered rousing speeches in which he asked Serbian immigrants to fight to save their homeland. Hoffman, who may have had a romantic relationship with the colonel, had an interest in &quot;powerful, charismatic&quot; people. She once said, &quot;Hero worship formed a major part of my emotional life&quot;. He modeled for her sculpture of him entitled &quot;A Modern Crusader&quot; (1918). His nephew said that it capture that &quot;he was gaunt and weary. His eyes were deep sunk in their sockets ... Only his firm mouth and his powerful chin showed no trace of the inhuman punishment which his body and soul had received during half a decade of life in the trenches.&quot; There are casts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Smithsonian American Art Museum, and Art Institute of Chicago.
She also created the well known poster &quot;Serbia needs your help&quot;, based on the Miloje P. Igrutinović&#x27;s photo of dead Serbian soldiers who had died of hunger and exhaustion on the Greek island of Vido. She made the soldier &quot;live&quot; on the poster and later, as a sort of an artistic installation, posted the soldier&#x27;s head on the bronze statue of the Saint Francis of Assisi in front of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. She published her impressions about her visit in the chapter &quot;Hunger in the Balkans&quot; of her book &quot;Heads and Tales&quot;.

The poster &quot;Serbia needs your help&quot; later circulated around the United States, including the library of a local politician in Phoenix, Arizona, or in the Navajo reservation. That was where the priest Janko Trbović found it. One reprint of the poster, after an intricate and extended search, was donated by the basketball player Vlade Divac.

In 2018, an exhibition &quot;Who is Malvina Hoffman&quot; dedicated to her work was opened in Novi Sad, Serbia. It was part of the wider project &quot;Serbia, war and posters&quot; by the state government. The Hoffman exhibition, organized in cooperation with the US embassy in Belgrade, later toured the entire country. Among other exhibits, Hoffman&#x27;s drawings which she made when she visited Serbia in 1919 were also displayed.

=== Interwar period ===

In 1919, she created a pedimental sculpture for Bush House in London. The same year, she was in Paris cataloging Rodin&#x27;s works for the Musée Rodin. In 1929, her first major exhibit was held at the Grand Central Art Galleries with 105 works of art in various mediums.

During the war, she met the American Red Cross worker John W. Frothingham and his Serbian wife Jelena Lozanić. As member of the American Red Cross, she and Lozanić continued to organize the relief for Serbia (now amalgamated into Yugoslavia) during the Interbellum, regularly giving lectures on orphaned Serbian children. She welcomed Croatian sculptor Ivan Meštrović, lending him her studio to work. In 1919, at the request of Herbert Hoover, director of American Relief Administration, Hoffman travelled to Serbia and Yugoslavia to visit US humanitarian missions throughout the state. That same year she visited the site of the 1389 Battle of Kosovo, as the second recorded American to do so, after John W. Frotingham (some even claim the second foreign visitor in general).

After the war, she made the sculpture &quot;The Sacrifice&quot;, which was dedicated in 1923 at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York. In it, the head of a 13th-century crusader lay on the lap of a draped woman. It is a memorial to the late Ambassador of France, Robert Bacon, and alumni of Harvard University who lost their lives during the war. After the Memorial Church at Harvard University was completed in 1932, it was installed there.

=== &quot;Hall of Man&quot; ===

In 1929, Hoffman received a telegram from Stanley Field, &quot;Have proposition to make, do you care to consider it? Racial types to be modeled while traveling round the world.&quot; The original proposal was to commission four or five artists to create painted plaster figures, as was common at the time, but Hoffman countered with a proposal to do the entire series by herself. Her counter-proposal was accepted, and she was commissioned by the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois to create anthropologically accurate sculptures of peoples of diverse nationalities and races. Next, she determined to do the entire series in bronze, submitted two initial sculptures, and obtained approval to proceed.

Her initial work on the series was done in her Manhattan studio, but then she moved to her studio in Paris, where she could refer to models from the Paris Colonial Exposition of 1931. She then traveled around the world — including distant places like Africa, India, and Bali — in 1931 to 1932, creating busts and figures of people and taking more than 2,000 photographs.


She completed more than 105 sculptures, predominantly in bronze, but also in marble and stone. They included busts and full-length figures of individuals, which were installed at the museum&#x27;s &quot;Hall of Man&quot; in 1933. She documented her travels for the commission in the book, &quot;Heads and Tales&quot;. It was a popular exhibit at the museum, but some critics considered it a purely anthropological study. 

During the 1960s, questions began to circulate about the exhibit. According to &quot;American Historical Review&quot;, &quot;the sculptures in the &#x27;Races of Mankind&#x27; had perpetuated an older typological approach by presenting &#x27;race&#x27; in the form of literally static bronze figures depicting idealized racial &#x27;types&#x27;&quot;. The &quot;Hall of Man&quot; was deinstalled in 1969, but some of the sculptures remained on display.

In 2016, fifty recently conserved sculptures from the &quot;Mankind&quot; collection were re-installed at the museum in an exhibition called &quot;Looking at Ourselves: Rethinking the Sculptures of Malvina Hoffman&quot;.

=== World War II ===

As she had during World War I, Hoffman served the Red Cross and she raised money for the Red Cross and national defense during the war. She again supported Serbia, which was again occupied by Germany. Jointly with the mayor of New York City, Fiorello La Guardia, she participated in the fund raising events of organized by Jelena Lozanić, and in sending of the relief to the occupied territory.

In 1948, Hoffman created relief sculptures for the walls of the &quot;American World War II Memorial&quot; for the Epinal American Cemetery and Memorial in Vosges, France. It is on the site of the Battle of the Bulge (1944). There are 5,255 American soldiers buried in the cemetery.

=== Other ===

She depicted the evolution of medicine in a 13-panel bas relief for Boston&#x27;s Joslin Diabetes Center. Hoffman made portrait sculptures, including those of &quot;John Muir&quot;, &quot;Wendell Willkie&quot;, &quot;Ignacy Jan Paderewski&quot;, &quot;Henry Clay Frick&quot;, and &quot;Ivan Meštrović&quot;. Her works were exhibited often at the National Academy. In 1965, she published &quot;Yesterday is Tomorrow&quot;.

Among her awards are the gold medal she won in 1924 from the National Academy, the gold medal of honor she won in 1962 for &quot;Mongolian Archer&quot; from the Allied of Artists of America, and the gold medal of honor that she won in 1964 from the National Sculpture Society. She was awarded five honorary doctorates. Her awards for public service include the French Legion of Honour and the Royal Order of St. Sava III of Yugoslavia.

Her work is kept in the permanent collections of many museums worldwide, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, the Vero Beach Museum of Art, the Harvard Art Museums, the University of Michigan Museum of Art, the Dallas Museum of Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Nasher Museum of Art, and the Gilcrease Museum.

== Personal life ==

She was married to an Englishman, Samuel Bonarius Grimson, on June 4, 1924. Grimson had been injured by mustard gas and phosgene during World War I, and his career as a concert violist was ended when his hands were crushed during an accident with a truck during the war. After the war, he collected antique paintings and instruments. He also invented a tube for a color television. Grimson traveled with her during her search for authentic indigenous models for the anthropological series. Hoffman and Grimson divorced in 1936; some speculated that it was due to an affair that she had with the ballerina Anna Pavlova. Grimson later married Bettina Warburg, the daughter of Nina Loeb and Paul Warburg, in 1942. She was 16 years his junior. Grimson died in 1955.

Hoffman befriended painter Romaine Brooks, writer Gertrude Stein, and ballet dancer Anna Pavlova. She held costume parties and balls in her studio, which were reported in the city&#x27;s society pages. She often spent the summers in a Hartsdale cottage provided to her by Paul Warburg.

On July 10, 1966, Malvina Cornell Hoffman died of a heart attack in her studio in Manhattan, which had been purchased by the philanthropist Mary Williamson Averell and provided to Hoffman for a low-priced rent.

<doc id="905866" wikidata="Q1593346" url="?curid=905866" title="Russian Guards">
<text>Guards () or Guards units (, &quot;gvardeyskiye chasti&quot;) were elite military units of Imperial Russia prior to 1917–18. The designation of Guards was subsequently adopted as a distinction for various units and formations of the Soviet Union and the modern Russian Federation. The tradition goes back to a chieftain&#x27;s &quot;druzhina&quot; of medieval Kievan Rus&#x27; and the streletskoye voysko (Стрелецкое Войско), the Muscovite harquebusiers formed by Ivan the Terrible by 1550. The exact meaning of the term &quot;Guards&quot; varied over time.

== Russian Imperial Guard ==
In the Russian Empire, Russian Imperial Guard units (also or &quot;life-guard&quot;, ), derived from German &quot;Leibgarde&quot; (en: lifeguard or life-guard), were intended to ensure the security of the sovereign, initially, that of Peter the Great in the 1690s. These were based on the Prussian Royal Life Guards. During the 19th century the Imperial Russian Guard regiments were not exclusively composed of Russian troops, but also included Lithuanian, Finnish and Ukrainian units.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the Imperial Guards consisted of 13 infantry, 4 rifles and 14 cavalry regiments, artillery, engineers and transport, making up a separate entity within the army of three divisions. During the Brusilov Offensive the 1st and 2nd Guards&#x27; numbers were supplemented with line army corps and from September 1916 were known as the &#x27;Special Army&#x27;.

In February–March 1917, the defection of reserve battalions of the Imperial Guard based in St.Petersburg was a major factor in the overthrow of the Tsarist government. The service units of the Guard at the front disintegrated along with the remainder of the Imperial Army, until it was formally replaced by the new Red Army on 28 January 1918.

== Russian Revolution ==
The Red Guards () were armed groups of workers formed during the Russian Revolution of 1917, although the designation and concept dates back to Moscow during the Revolution of 1905. In 1917 the volunteers of the Red Guard and their elected leaders formed the main strike force of the Bolsheviks. These workers&#x27; militias were created in March 1917 in by Factory and Plant Committees and by Bolshevik party cells, with the initial purpose of defending the industrial enterprises and districts where they were recruited. In October 1917 the Red Guards of Petrograd played a leading role in the capture of the Winter Palace and the overthrow of the Provisional Government. When the Soviet Red Army was formed in 1918, the Red Guards became the Army Reserve and the basis for the formation of regular military detachments.

The White Guard () of the White Army (, whose members were called ), the military forces of the Russian White Movement, which opposed the Bolsheviks after the October Revolution and fought against the Red Army during the Russian Civil War from 1918 to 1921.

== Soviet Guards ==
&quot;Guards&quot; () designations were awarded to units and formations that distinguished themselves during the Second World War by the order of People&#x27;s Commissar for Defence of USSR No.303 on the 18 September 1941, and were considered to have elite status. However, the Guards badge was not introduced until 21 May 1943. 

In late 1941, the Stavka began awarding the honorific title &#x27;Guards&#x27; to regiments, divisions, and corps that had distinguished themselves in combat. Units earning this title had often suffered up to 30 percent or more casualties after successfully performing desperate missions. It was not only a prestigious designation, as units so honoured were thereafter better equipped and given preference in personnel, supplies, equipment and material. 

Zhukov said &quot;the first period of the war gave birth to the Soviet Guards. For mass heroism and success in the battles of 1941-1942 the Guards title was awarded to 789 groups, formations, separate units, and fighting ships of the Soviet Armed Forces.&quot;

Pik Sovetskoy Gvardii, meaning &quot;Soviet Guard Peak&quot;, the second highest mountain in the Anyuy Range, was named after the Soviet Guards.

There were eleven Guard Armies and six Guard Tank Armies:

*1st Guards Army
*2nd Guards Army
*3rd Guards Army
*4th Guards Army
*5th Guards Army
*6th Guards Army
*7th Guards Army
*8th Guards Army
*9th Guards Army
*10th Guards Army
*11th Guards Army
*1st Guards Tank Army
*2nd Guards Tank Army
*3rd Guards Tank Army
*4th Guards Tank Army
*5th Guards Tank Army
*6th Guards Tank Army

== Russian Federation Guards ==
The Guards distinction was retained as designations of units and formations in the armed forces of the former Soviet Union: Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine. 

The National Guard of Russia was formed in 2016.

<text>Alfred Dillwyn &quot;Dilly&quot; Knox, CMG (23 July 1884 – 27 February 1943) was an English classics scholar and papyrologist at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge and a codebreaker. As a member of the Room 40 codebreaking unit he helped decrypt the Zimmermann Telegram which brought the USA into the First World War. He then joined the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS).

As chief cryptographer, Knox played an important role in the Polish–French–British meetings on the eve of the Second World War which disclosed Polish cryptanalysis of the Axis Enigma to the Allies.

At Bletchley Park, he worked on the cryptanalysis of Enigma ciphers until his death in 1943. He built the team and discovered the method that broke the Italian Naval Enigma, producing the intelligence credited with Allied victory at the Battle of Cape Matapan. In 1941, Knox broke the Abwehr Enigma. By the end of the war, Intelligence Service Knox had disseminated 140,800 Abwehr decrypts, including intelligence important for D-Day.

==Personal life and family==
Dillwyn Knox, the fourth of six children, was the son of Edmund Knox, tutor at Merton College and later Bishop of Manchester; he was the brother of E. V. Knox, Wilfred Knox, Ronald Knox, Ethel Knox, and Winifred Peck, and uncle of the novelist Penelope Fitzgerald. His father was a descendant of John Arbuthnott, 8th Viscount of Arbuthnott.

Dillwyn—known as &quot;Dilly&quot;—Knox was educated at Summer Fields School, Oxford, and then Eton College. He studied classics at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge from 1903, and in 1909 was elected a Fellow following the death of Walter Headlam, from whom he inherited extensive research into the works of Herodas. While an undergraduate he was friends with Lytton Strachey and John Maynard Keynes. He and Keynes were lovers at Eton. Knox privately coached Harold Macmillan, the future Prime Minister, at King&#x27;s for a few weeks in 1910, but Macmillan found him &quot;austere and uncongenial&quot;.

He married Olive Rodman in 1920, forgetting to invite two of his three brothers to his wedding. The couple had two sons, Oliver and Christopher.

He was an atheist.

==Academic scholarship==
Between the two World Wars Knox worked on the great commentary on Herodas that had been started by Walter Headlam, damaging his eyesight while studying the British Museum&#x27;s collection of papyrus fragments, but finally managing to decipher the text of the Herodas papyri. The Knox-Headlam edition of Herodas finally appeared in 1922.

==Codebreaking==
=== First World War ===
Soon after war broke out in 1914, Knox was recruited to the Royal Navy&#x27;s cryptological effort in Room 40 of the Admiralty Old Building, where some of his work was done in the bath. He persuaded his superiors to have a bathtub installed in his office in the cryptanalysis section of the British Admiralty (in Room 53). In 1917, Knox followed Room 40 with its expansion into ID25.

Among other tasks, he was involved in breaking:
* the Zimmermann Telegram, which contributed to bringing the USA into the war.
* much of the German admiral&#x27;s flag code by exploiting an operator&#x27;s love of romantic poetry.

===Between the wars===
====Government Code and Cypher School====

During the First World War he had been elected Librarian at King&#x27;s College, but never took up the appointment. After the war Knox intended to resume his research at King&#x27;s, but was persuaded by his wife to remain at his secret work; indeed, so secret was this work that his own children had no idea, until many years after his death, what he did for a living, and his contribution to the war effort.

====Commercial Enigma====
The Enigma machine became available commercially in the 1920s. In Vienna in 1925, Knox bought the Enigma &#x27;C&#x27; machine evaluated by Hugh Foss in 1927 on behalf of GC&amp;CS. Foss found &quot;a high degree of security&quot; but wrote a secret paper describing how to attack the machine if &quot;cribs&quot; – short sections of plain text – could be guessed. When – a decade later – Knox picked up this work, he developed a more effective algebraic system (&quot;rodding&quot;) based on the principles described by Foss.

====Spanish Enigma====
The Germany Navy () adopted Enigma in 1926, adding a plug-board () to improve security. Nazi Germany supplied non-ed machines to Franco&#x27;s Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War. On 24 April 1937, Knox broke the Spanish Enigma but knowledge of this breakthrough was not shared with the Republicans. Soon afterwards, Knox began to attack signals between Spain and Germany encrypted using ed Enigma machines.

====On the eve of the Second World War====
=====Polish–French–British meetings=====
GC&amp;CS began to discuss Enigma with the French in 1938, obtaining from the Bureau details of Wehrmacht Enigma supplied by Asché and signal intercepts, some of which must have been made in Eastern Europe. This led the French to disclose their links with the (Polish cryptographers). Knox, Hugh Foss and Alastair Denniston represented the GC&amp;CS at the first Polish–French–British meeting at Paris in January 1939. The Poles were under order to disclose nothing of importance, leaving the British codebreakers disappointed. Knox&#x27;s description of his system of rodding impressed the Polish codebreakers and they requested his presence at a second meeting.

Knox attended the second Polish–French–British conference, held on 25–26 July 1939 at the Polish Cipher Bureau (at Pyry, south of Warsaw, Poland). The Poles began to disclose to their French and British allies their achievements in solving Enigma decryption.

Although Marian Rejewski, the Polish cryptographer and mathematician who solved the plugboard-equipped Enigma used by Nazi Germany, approached the problem through permutation theory (whereas Knox applied linguistics), a good personal relationship was quickly established at the conference. The good impression made by Rejewski on Knox played an important role in increasing recruitment of mathematicians to Bletchley Park. Knox was chagrined — but grateful — to learn how simple was the solution of the Enigma&#x27;s entry ring (standard alphabetical order).

After the meeting, he sent the Polish cryptologists a very gracious note in Polish, on official British government stationery, thanking them for their assistance and sending &quot;sincere thanks for your cooperation and patience&quot;. Enclosed were a beautiful scarf featuring a picture of a Derby winner and a set of paper &#x27;batons&#x27;.

These &#x27;batons&#x27; were known as rods to the British and had been used to solve the Spanish Enigma. Knox&#x27;s rodding method was later used to break the Italian Naval Enigma.

====Turing&#x27;s bombe====
Alan Turing worked on Enigma during the months leading to the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, and occasionally visited GC&amp;CS&#x27;s London HQ to discuss this problem with Knox. In the 1939 register Turing was recorded in Naphill, staying with Knox and his wife.
By November 1939 Turing had completed the design of the bombe — a radical improvement of the Polish bomba.

===Second World War===
====Knox&#x27;s rodding method====
To break non-ed Enigma machines (those without a plugboard), Knox (building on earlier research by Hugh Foss) developed a system known as &#x27;rodding&#x27;, a linguistic as opposed to mathematical way of breaking codes. This technique worked on the Enigma used by the (Italian Navy) and the German . Knox worked in &#x27;the Cottage&#x27;, next door to the Bletchley Park mansion, as head of a research section, which contributed significantly to cryptanalysis of the Enigma.

Knox&#x27;s team at &quot;The Cottage&quot; used rodding to decrypt intercepted Italian naval signals describing the sailing of an Italian battle fleet, leading to the Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941. Admiral John Godfrey, Director of Naval Intelligence credited the Allied victory at Matapan to this intelligence; Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham, who had commanded the victorious fleet at Matapan, went to Bletchley to congratulate &#x27;Dilly and his girls&#x27;.

====Intelligence Services Knox====
In October 1941, Knox solved the Enigma. Intelligence Services Knox (ISK) was established to decrypt communications. In early 1942, with Knox seriously ill, Peter Twinn took charge of running ISK and was appointed head after Knox&#x27;s death. By the end of the war, ISK had decrypted and disseminated 140,800 messages. Intelligence gained from these decrypts played an important part in ensuring the success of the Double-Cross System of MI5 and MI6, and in Operation Fortitude, the Allied campaign to deceive the Germans about D-Day.

====Death====
Knox&#x27;s work was cut short when he fell ill with lymphoma. When he became unable to travel to Bletchley Park, he continued his cryptographic work from his home in Hughenden, Buckinghamshire, where he received the CMG. He died on 27 February 1943. A biography of Knox, written by Mavis Batey, one of &#x27;Dilly&#x27;s girls&#x27;, the female codebreakers who worked with him, was published in September 2009.

==Classified poetry==
Knox celebrated the victory at Battle of Cape Matapan with poetry, which remained classified until 1978.

<doc id="905871" wikidata="Q931635" url="?curid=905871" title="With Teeth">
<text>With Teeth (stylized as [WITH_TEETH]) is the fourth studio album by the American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, released by Nothing Records and Interscope Records on May 3, 2005. The album was produced by Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor and long-time collaborator Alan Moulder. It also features contributions from musician Dave Grohl and future band member Atticus Ross.

In line with the band&#x27;s previous material, the record features introspective songwriting influenced by Reznor&#x27;s addiction to alcohol and drugs and subsequent sobriety. The album generated three singles: &quot;The Hand That Feeds&quot;, &quot;Only&quot;, and &quot;Every Day Is Exactly the Same&quot;, the latter of which was released as an accompanying remix EP. The album was supported by the Live: With Teeth tour.

&quot;With Teeth&quot; was well received by critics, albeit slightly less than the band&#x27;s previous work. Some complimented the aggressive composition, while others said the album was bland and criticized Reznor for a lack of originality. The album became the band&#x27;s second to reach No. 1 in the U.S. and was certified gold both by the RIAA and BPI and platinum by Music Canada.

==Background==
Nine Inch Nails garnered mainstream attention with their influential second album &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;, as well as a widely broadcast live performance at Woodstock &#x27;94, becoming one of the most popular music acts of the 1990s. Reznor appeared in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the year&#x27;s most influential people in 1997, and &quot;Spin&quot; magazine described him as &quot;the most vital artist in music&quot;. However, his musical output was infrequent, having released only three studio albums from 1989 to 2005 with a rough average of five years between each release. During this time, Reznor became increasingly addicted to alcohol and drugs, resulting in depression and writer&#x27;s block.

The 1999 Nine Inch Nails double album &quot;The Fragile&quot; was met with generally positive reviews from music critics and eventually sold 898,000 copies. However, it failed to attain the success of its predecessor and fell from the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts after only a week. Afterwards, the only original Nine Inch Nails material released until 2005 was the 2000 remix album &quot;Things Falling Apart&quot;, as well as the 2001 remix album &quot;Still&quot; and the 2001 single &quot;Deep&quot; from the &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot; soundtrack. Reznor told &quot;Spin&quot; magazine in 2005, &quot;I was going to just drink myself or drug myself out of it. I got back to New Orleans after the &quot;Fragile&quot; tour, and I&#x27;d pretty much lost my soul.&quot;

==Writing and recording==
===Songwriting===
After Reznor decided to go to rehab, he began work on a new album and found that the songwriting process moved along easier for him than in the past. He said that it was due to having &quot;a pretty good game plan&quot; and elaborated, &quot;I had themes and subjects [...] as my brain started working, the songs just started to come out. I regained my self-confidence.&quot; He originally planned the album to be a concept album, complete with a storyline. He was quoted in a 2007 article as saying, &quot;I&#x27;d come up with this kind of elaborate storyline, and the record was gonna be a concept record that had a number of pretentious elements to it. I was gonna talk about multi-layered reality and waking up in a dream you can&#x27;t wake up out of, and eventually finding acceptance after you go through this period of trying to fight it. It was all kind of a big analogy for me getting sober.&quot;

===Nothing Studios sessions===
Reznor began recording the album at Nothing Studios in New Orleans, the last release he recorded at the location before permanently relocating to Los Angeles. The album was produced by Reznor and long-time Nine Inch Nails producer Alan Moulder, with engineering and assistance by Atticus Ross, who would later join the band as its second official member in 2016. The album was mixed in stereo and 5.1 surround sound. Nirvana drummer and Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl contributed drums and percussion on seven tracks. According to a statement on the official Nine Inch Nails website, Reznor stated that producer Rick Rubin was his &quot;mentor&quot; and &quot;source of inspiration&quot; throughout the planning and writing process of the album.

Reznor was heavily inspired by the use of more analog electronic effects and instruments, specifically tape delay and modular synthesizers. A post on the band&#x27;s official website dated May 5 indicated that Reznor, Ross, and Leo Herrera were in the studio recording and &quot;refining&quot; rough new material. It also stated Jerome Dillon was on drums on these sessions. Mixing began on October 28, and Reznor revealed on New Year&#x27;s Eve that the album was complete and would be titled &quot;With Teeth&quot;.

==Music and lyrics==
Before the album&#x27;s release, Reznor described &quot;With Teeth&quot; as &quot;more song-oriented&quot; and &quot;lean&quot; than &quot;The Fragile&quot; (1999). In reference to the album&#x27;s sound, Reznor said he &quot;tried to keep a lo-fi aesthetic running through it, a kind of carelessness.&quot; Moreover, he stated the music was less of a concept album, and more of &quot;a collection of songs that are friends with each other, but don&#x27;t have to rely on each other to make sense&quot;. &quot;With Teeth&quot; is considered as Reznor&#x27;s most rock-centric album since the &quot;Broken&quot; EP and labeled as industrial rock, electronic rock, and hard rock. The album&#x27;s sound also draws inspirations from genres such as drum and bass, pop, electronica, ambient, trip hop, and acid house.

The album&#x27;s lyrics tackle Reznor&#x27;s opinion of himself, his relationship with the world around him and his place in it, and his struggles with addiction. Although it dealt with these issues, Reznor was hopeful that it was still &quot;disguised enough that [it was] not a terribly boring record about recovery and addiction&quot;. Reznor also drew influence from the September 11, 2001 attacks, which occurred shortly after his recovery. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;The Hand That Feeds&quot;, was a direct example of the themes of protest and propagandist fear that helped influence the album. These influences became more prominent in his next album, &quot;Year Zero&quot;, and the alternate reality game that accompanied it. In a book about the earlier Nine Inch Nails album &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;, author Daphne Carr noted that &quot;All the Love in the World&quot; was one of Nine Inch Nails&#x27; deeper songs noting the lyrics &quot;Watching all the insects march along, seem to know just right where they belong, smears of face reflecting in the chrome, hiding in the crowd I&#x27;m all alone.&quot;

==Title and packaging==

Early reports indicated that the album had a working title of &quot;Bleedthrough&quot;. Reznor stated that the name was eventually changed: &quot;It was supposed to be about different layers of reality seeping into the next, but I think some people were thinking about blood or a tampon commercial.&quot;

In a statement to fans on the official Nine Inch Nails website, Reznor explained that his dislike for the constraints of CD artwork led to the creation of a downloadable 20-megabyte poster, incorporating credits, lyrics, and artwork. The poster, designed by Reznor and Rob Sheridan, contains lyrics that are not featured in the actual songs (a practice Reznor has continued since &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;), as well as song titles and lyrics not featured on the album, possibly recorded but unreleased. The poster is available to members of the official Nine Inch Nails fan club as part of the initial welcome package.

&quot;With Teeth&quot; is the last Nine Inch Nails studio album to include the Nothing Records logo in the packaging, since it was declared extinct after the February 2007 inclusion of the &quot;Beside You in Time&quot; home video. Before the release of the album, fans were able to listen to &quot;With Teeth&quot; in its entirety by attending listening parties that took place in 13 cities throughout the U.S. Anyone who attended received promotional posters and stickers. Those who pre-ordered the album received a limited edition 7&quot; vinyl containing the single &quot;The Hand That Feeds,&quot; as well as the B-side track &quot;Home.&quot; The album was promoted with seven short teaser trailers. &quot;The Fragile&quot;, &quot;Things Falling Apart&quot;, and &quot;Year Zero&quot; were also promoted with trailers, as well as commercials.

&quot;With Teeth&quot; was released as a standard CD, double vinyl, a DualDisc and a CD/DVD combo. In addition to 5.1 surround and stereo mixes of the songs, the DualDisc (and DVD) contain the video for &quot;The Hand That Feeds&quot;, an interactive discography and a slide show of album artwork. Reznor also released multitrack files for a few of the songs. In retrospect Reznor said, &quot;That whole idea of putting up multitracks, really was just, several years ago, bored in a hotel room [...] just as an experiment I happened to have the multitracks with me--I think I was doing press for &quot;With Teeth&quot;--I loaded up &quot;The Hand That Feeds&quot; and made it as a multitrack, in GarageBand. [...] I thought it would be cool to give the sounds to people, and I knew the challenge would be to get that past Interscope, essentially giving the masters out. But they agreed.&quot; Reznor has released multitrack files for every major Nine Inch Nails release up to, and including, &quot;The Slip&quot;.

In June 2015, an instrumental version of the album was released to Apple Music. A remastered &quot;Definitive Edition&quot; was released on vinyl and digital in November 2019.

==Live: With Teeth tour==
Nine Inch Nails live performances supported the album with a tour named . The touring lineup featured Jeordie White, Aaron North, Alessandro Cortini, and Jerome Dillon. Midway through the tour, Dillon was forced to stop playing due to a medical condition. He was initially replaced by Alex Carapetis, and then later by Josh Freese.

The tour began with a small club tour in early 2005, and the band members were reportedly &quot;pleasantly surprised by the interest&quot; despite the group&#x27;s lengthy hiatus between tours. This initial leg of the tour also included a headlining performance at Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. The band followed up with a North American arena tour in autumn 2005, supported by Queens of the Stone Age, Autolux, Death from Above 1979, and hip hop artist Saul Williams. The second leg of the tour consisted of a series of North American amphitheaters performances in the summer of 2006, supported by Bauhaus, TV on the Radio, and Peaches. In 2007, a tour documentary entitled &quot;Beside You in Time&quot; was released in DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray formats.

==Critical reception==

&quot;With Teeth&quot; received mostly positive reviews from critics, with an aggregate rating of 71 based on 22 reviews on Metacritic. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s Rob Sheffield described the album as &quot;vintage Nine Inch Nails&quot;, while &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; said &quot;The words &#x27;triumphant return&#x27; are apt.&quot; Rock critic Robert Christgau gave it a lukewarm review, commenting in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, &quot;All pretense of deeper meaning worn into shtick, [Reznor] is left with the aggro mood music that was always his calling.&quot; &quot;Newsday&quot; gave &quot;With Teeth&quot; a rating of A− and called it &quot;a strong reminder why, despite his lengthy absences, Reznor remains alt-rock royalty.&quot; Many reviewers commented upon the lyrics in songs like &quot;All the Love in the World&quot; for their personal and mournful quality.

Other critics panned the album, including the &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Edward J. Keyes, who described the album as &quot;all paint-by-numbers with no topography or relief—just one angry distorted chord after another.&quot; PopMatters critically slammed the album, summarizing its poor review by simply saying &quot;Trent Reznor has run out of ideas.&quot; In the review for AllMusic, editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine was also muted in his praise for the album, claiming that &quot;[It] is the work of a craftsman, a musician who meticulously assembles his work by layering details so densely, there&#x27;s never a moment on the record where something isn&#x27;t roiling under the surface, where something isn&#x27;t added to the mix. He&#x27;s good at this, though. &quot;With Teeth&quot; is an impressive achievement technically and the music is generally strong, yet there&#x27;s a nagging problem -- namely, there&#x27;s nothing new here.&quot;

&quot;With Teeth&quot; was named one of the top 40 albums of 2005 by &quot;Spin&quot; magazine. The song &quot;The Hand That Feeds&quot; was nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance for the 48th Annual Grammy Awards in 2006. The song &quot;Every Day Is Exactly the Same&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2007. Pitchfork named &quot;The Hand That Feeds&quot; in its &quot;Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s&quot;, at number 406. In 2005, Reznor was nominated by the Billboard Music Awards as the &quot;Modern Rock Artist of the Year&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;With Teeth&quot; debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 272,000 copies in its first week. The album has been certified gold in the United States and the United Kingdom and platinum in Canada.

<text>Methone is a small, egg-shaped natural satellite of Saturn that orbits out past Saturn&#x27;s ring system, between the orbits of Mimas and Enceladus. It was discovered in 2004, though it was not until 2012 that it was imaged in detail by the &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft.

==History==
Methone was first discovered by the Cassini Imaging Team and given the temporary designation &#x27;. Methone is also named &#x27; (32). The &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft made two visits to Methone, and its closest approach was made on May 20, 2012 with a minimum distance of from it.

The name Methone was approved by the IAU Working Group on Planetary System Nomenclature on January 21, 2005. It was ratified at the IAU General Assembly in 2006. Methone (Greek &quot;Μεθώνη&quot;) was one of the Alkyonides, the seven beautiful daughters of the Giant Alkyoneus.

==Orbit==
Methone&#x27;s orbit is perturbed by a 14:15 mean-motion resonance with the much larger Mimas. This causes its osculating orbital elements to vary with an amplitude of about in semi-major axis, and 5° in longitude of its periapsis on a timescale of about 450 days. Its eccentricity also varies, albeit on different timescales, between 0.0011 and 0.0037, and its inclination between about 0.003° and 0.020°.

==Physical characteristics==
In May 2012, the &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft took its first close-up photographs of Methone, revealing a remarkably smooth, but non-spherical moonlet. The other arc-imbedded moonlets, Pallene and Anthe, are thought to be similar.

Methone&#x27;s smoothness and excellent ellipsoidal fits suggest that it has developed an equipotential surface, and this may be composed largely of an icy fluff, a material that might be mobile enough to explain the moonlet&#x27;s lack of craters. This material property causes Methone to take the shape of a triaxial ellipsoid, a type of ellipsoid in which all 3 of its principal axes are of different lengths. These differences reflect the balance between tidal forces exerted by Saturn and centrifugal forces from the moonlet&#x27;s own rotation, as well as the moonlet&#x27;s own force of gravity.

Methone&#x27;s longest axis points towards Saturn, and is 1.6x longer than its polar axis. This elongation is caused by tidal forces, whereas the elongation of its intermediate-length axis (1.07x the length of the polar axis) is caused by the centrifugal force of Methone&#x27;s rotation.

Methone&#x27;s low-density regolith may respond to impacts in a way that smooths its surface more rapidly than on rigid moonlets such as Janus or Epimetheus. Movement of the regolith may also be facilitated by more &quot;exotic&quot; processes such as electrostatic effects.

Methone has two sharply defined albedo regions, with albedos of 0.61±0.06 and 0.7±0.03. The darker of these regions is centered on Methone&#x27;s leading side, reminiscent of the thermal anomalies on the leading hemispheres of Mimas and Tethys, and it has been suggested that increased exposure to electrons from Saturn&#x27;s magnetosphere is responsible. However, in those examples, the thermal anomalies coincide with a distinct UV/IR coloration, which in the case of Methone is either highly subdued or undetectable. Thus a physical, rather than compositional difference may be responsible. Possibilities include variations in regolith grain size, compaction, or particle microstructure.

Assuming that Methone is in hydrostatic equilibrium, i.e. that its elongated shape simply reflects the balance between the tidal force exerted by Saturn and Methone&#x27;s gravity, its density can be estimated: , among the lowest density values obtained or inferred for a Solar System body.

==Relationship with Saturn&#x27;s rings==

Material blasted off Methone by micrometeoroid impacts is believed to be the source of the Methone Ring Arc, a faint partial ring around Saturn co-orbital with Methone that was discovered in September 2006.

<text>Pallene is a very small natural satellite of Saturn. It is one of three small moons known as the Alkyonides that lie between the orbits of the larger Mimas and Enceladus. It is also designated .

== Discovery ==

Pallene was discovered by the Cassini Imaging Team in 2004, during the Cassini–Huygens mission. It was given the temporary designation . In 2005, the name Pallene was provisionally approved by the IAU Division III Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature, and was ratified at the IAU General Assembly in 2006. The name refers to Pallene, one of the Alkyonides, the seven beautiful daughters of the giant Alkyoneus.

After the discovery in 2004, it was realized that Pallene had been first photographed on August 23, 1981, by the space probe &#x27;. It had appeared in a single photograph and had been provisionally named and estimated to orbit 200,000 km from Saturn. Because it had not been visible in other images, it had not been possible to compute its orbit at the time, but recent comparisons have shown it to match Pallene&#x27;s orbit.

== Orbital characteristics ==

Pallene is visibly affected by a perturbing mean-longitude resonance with the much larger Enceladus, although this effect is not as large as Mimas&#x27;s perturbations on Methone. The perturbations cause Pallene&#x27;s osculating orbital elements to vary with an amplitude of about 4 km in semi-major axis, and 0.02° in longitude (corresponding to about 75 km). Eccentricity also changes on various timescales between 0.002 and 0.006, and inclination between about 0.178° and 0.184°.

== Ring ==

In 2006, images taken in forward-scattered light by the &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft enabled the Cassini Imaging Team to discover a faint dust ring around Saturn that shares Pallene&#x27;s orbit, now named the Pallene Ring. The ring has a radial extent of about 2,500 km. Its source is particles blasted off Pallene&#x27;s surface by meteoroid impacts, which then form a diffuse ring around its orbital path.

== Exploration ==

The &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft, which studied Saturn and its moons until September, 2017, performed a fly-by of Pallene on 16 October 2010, and 14 September 2011 at a distance of 36,000 kilometers (22,000 miles) and 44,000 kilometers respectively.

<text>Josiah Williams Begole (January 20, 1815June 5, 1896) was an American politician serving as a U.S. Representative from 1873 to 1875 and the 19th governor of Michigan from 1883 to 1885.

==Early life in New York==
Begole was born in Groveland, New York. His ancestors were French Huguenots who emigrated to the United States in the last quarter of the 18th century to escape religious persecution and settled in Hagerstown, Maryland. Josiah&#x27;s father, William (1788–1862) was born there and moved to Livingston County, New York in 1802. William served in the War of 1812 and married the daughter of an American Revolutionary War veteran. Three of Williams sons, including Josiah, the eldest, eventually moved to Genesee County, Michigan. He attended the public schools in Mount Morris and Temple Hill Academy in Geneseo, New York.

==Life and politics in Michigan==
Begole moved to Flint, Michigan in August 1836 and taught school in 1837 and 1838. In the spring of 1839, he married Harriet A. Miles. He engaged in agricultural pursuits from 1839 to 1856 and was school inspector, justice of the peace and township treasurer. Being an anti-slavery man, he became a member of the Republican party at its organization. He was county treasurer 1856–1864. He was briefly engaged in the lumber business in 1863. His eldest son was killed during the American Civil War near Atlanta, Georgia in 1864, and was the greatest sorrow of his life.

He was a member of the Michigan Senate in 1870 and 1871, and a member of the Flint City Council for three years. During that time, he served on the Committees of Finance and Railroads, and was Chairman of the Committee on the Institute for the Deaf and Dumb and Blind. He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention at Philadelphia in 1872 to re-nominate U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant and to nominate Henry Wilson as the new Vice President.

==Congress==
Begole was elected as a Republican from Michigan&#x27;s 6th congressional district to the United States House of Representatives for the 43rd Congress, serving from March 4, 1873, to March 3, 1875. During that time, he was a member of the Committee on Agricultural and Public Expenditures. He was an unsuccessful candidate for re-election in 1874 and resumed the lumber business, Begole Fox &amp; Co. He later engaged in the manufacture of wagons founding Flint Wagon Works and also engaged in banking.

==Governor==
In 1882, Begole was gubernatorial candidate of the Greenback and Democratic parties, defeating the Republican incumbent David Jerome by over 7,000 votes. He served one term from 1883 to 1885. As a former Republican who ousted a Republican incumbent, Begole faced many obstacles with a Republican-dominated legislature. As a result, the establishment of the state bureau of labor statistics was one of the few acts that was approved. He ran for re-election in 1884, but was defeated by Republican Russell Alger, after which he resumed his former business activities.

He was an early activist for women&#x27;s suffrage, and in 1884 Begole became vice president of the first statewide suffrage organization, the Michigan Equal Suffrage Association.

==Retirement and death==
Begole died at the age of eighty-one in Flint and is interred in Glenwood Cemetery there.

<doc id="905896" wikidata="Q330837" url="?curid=905896" title="Buenaventura Báez">
<text>Ramón Buenaventura Báez Méndez (July 14, 1812March 14, 1884), was a Dominican conservative politician and military figure. He was president of the Dominican Republic for five nonconsecutive terms. His rule was characterized by corruption and governing for the benefit of his personal fortune.

Born in the community of Rincón, today Cabral, into a wealthy family, at a very early age he was sent to France to be educated. Precisely because of his education, much higher than average, Buenaventura Báez was able to carve out a leadership from a young age that allowed him to be appointed as a deputy in the Haitian Congress, a position he held in 1843, when the movement called La Reforma took place. From this position he began his work aimed at obtaining a protectorate from some foreign power, whether it was France, the United States, or any other.

Having achieved independence from Haiti in 1844, he was president of the brand new Dominican Republic on five occasions, a position in which he had some achievements, such as the founding of the first secondary school in the country, Colegio San Buenaventura; But, in general terms, Buenaventura Báez ruled dictatorially, murdering or allowing his followers to do so, and alternating his first three terms with those of Pedro Santana. In 1861 he opposed annexation to Spain because the person promoting it was his political enemy, Pedro Santana; However, after a few months, Buenaventura Báez managed and obtained the rank of marshal of the Spanish army, with the intention of achieving the governorship of the overseas province that the country had become, which he did not achieve. Shortly after, with the Dominican Restoration War, the Dominican Republic regained its independence.

In 1871, during his Six Years&#x27; government, the country was not annexed to the United States due to the opposition of Gregorio Luperón, who fought it on all fronts, supported by José María Cabral, and because the U.S. Congress rejected the offer. despite the fact that Báez had had the measure approved in a plebiscite. He died in Hormigueros, Puerto Rico, in 1884. His remains were repatriated in 1914, under the government of his son Ramón Báez.

==Early years and family==
Báez was born on July 14, 1812, in Rincón (now Cabral) in the Captaincy General of Santo Domingo during the years of España Boba. He was raised in his father&#x27;s hometown of Azua. Báez was the son of Pablo Altagracia Báez and Teresa de Jesús Méndez.

His father Pablo, a wealthy merchant from Azua, was left in an orphanage when he was born, as he was the result of an extramarital affair between Josefa Morales de Firpo (a married Spanish woman) and priest and author, the mulatto Father Antonio Sánchez-Valverde. Pablo was raised by a French silversmith (a factor that generated a deep francophilia in both Pablo and Buenaventura) known as &quot;Monsieur Capellier&quot;, and became a wealthy businessman, slaveholder and politician. Teresa de Jesús Méndez was a mixed-race former slave from Rincón. She was born to a slave and a master, and was sold to Pablo Altagracia Báez, who freed her to take her as his mistress when his wife María Quezada told him to do so when realized that she was infertile herself; Pablo and Teresa had seven children.

Báez was light-haired and blue-eyed like his father, but had curly hair and was somewhat swarthy, earning the nickname of &quot;Jabao&quot;. Cultured and good-looking, Báez was very popular among women, especially because of his gallantry. Eager to build a bright future for his first-born son, Pablo Báez sent him to study in England. Buenaventura Báez did not pursue formal university studies, but from a young age he stood out for his attention to culture.

In the European continent, he learned various languages, including English and French.

Until the end of his life, he was a voracious reader, which allowed him to learn about the main social and political theories and be aware of the evolution of international processes. His prolonged stay in Europe placed him above the cultural average of young people from the ruling social sector, at a time when there were no higher education institutions. His father&#x27;s wealth and talent facilitated an early foray into Haitian politics as a representative of the Azua region. In addition to his love for politics, Báez showed interest in business, like his father. In the early days of his adult life, before devoting himself fully to the struggle for power, he helped his father increase the family&#x27;s wealth. When his father died in 1841, Báez, aged 29, inherited a large fortune that he used assiduously in politics, becoming elected in 1843 deputy to the Haitian Constituent Assembly.

==Independence conspiracy==
===As a deputy of Azua===

At the beginning of 1843, an armed movement that was called the Reform broke out in Les Cayes, the third-largest city in Haiti, and the nucleus of the liberal mulatto sector. President Jean Pierre Boyer, who had ruled as an autocrat since 1818, soon had to abdicate. Those who overthrew Boyer in theory intended to establish a democratic regime, for which they convened a constituent assembly, which met during the second half of 1843 and approved a new constitution that replaced the one of 1816. Thanks to his gifts and influence, Báez was elected representative of Azua to the constituent assembly. His public life began there. He gained a place in the political world with proposals that attracted attention and positioned him as a representative figure of the interests of the Dominican ruling sectors.

As a deputy, Báez led a faction of Dominicans that tried, but failed, to remove the anti-white bias in the Haitian Constitution. Báez presented on that occasion a proposal to repeal the constitutional clause that stipulated that no white person could own property in Haitian territory. He argued that this prevented the entry of capital and immigrants from other countries, which were essential for economic progress. It can be seen that the germ of what would always be the central component in Báez&#x27;s concerns: that the country would enter a path of progress similar to that followed by the countries of Western Europe and the United States. The counterpart to this conception consisted of the conviction that the country lacked the means to achieve progress on its own, so it was obliged to seek the protection of a great power or, if feasible, integrate as part of it.

===Independence Conspiracy===

Báez was, at first, completely and totally against any move to leave the union with Haiti. Then, on 15 December 1843, Báez, as leader of the Dominican legislative faction, proposed to French consul Auguste Levasseur to establish a French protectorate in the Spanish-speaking side of the island with a governor appointed by Paris, in exchange for guns and warships to compel or fight Port-au-Prince for a retreat. The diplomat proposed a plan so that the Dominican Republic would be governed by a French governor for a period of 10 years, with the possibility of extensions; it would donate the Samaná Peninsula to France, and would be willing to collaborate in the event that France launched a war to reconquer Haiti. The proposal, although confidential in nature, was called the &quot;Levasseur Plan&quot;, and was welcomed by the Dominican representatives in the Haitian capital, from which the adjective “Frenchified” originated. The French consul, without authorization from his government, conceived this plan as the first step towards Haiti becoming a French colony again. Dominican conservatives saw the opportunity to free themselves from Haitian domination and obtain the help of a power to take off towards progress.

Consul Levasseur was very well disposed and constantly exchanged correspondence between Paris and the conspirators. They considered that Haitian rule placed them in a subordinate situation that prevented them from developing business and, in general, developing their interests. The sentiment was taking shape largely because the Dominican economy was experiencing a certain dynamism, while the Haitian economy remained stagnant.

Upon learning of the efforts of the Trinitarios, at the beginning of 1844, Báez, who had good relations with Haitian officials, denounced Gabino Puello, brother of José Joaquín Puello, when he arrived in Azua with the January 16 manifesto. Puello escaped capture by the warning given to him by the future general Valentín Alcántara. As the proclamation of independence on February 27 clashed with his political plans, Báez tried to oppose it in Azua, which led to his arrest and sent to Santo Domingo. He tried futilely to prevent the publication of a copy of the &quot;Dominican Act of Independence&quot; in January 1844 in Azua, and in February did not allow the flag of the newly Dominican state to be raised in the city plaza; in part, he was very pessimistic due to the numerical superiority of Haitians and thought that a rebellion against Port-au-Prince with no foreign support was futile. Báez and the other French supporters launched a manifesto – the text of which has been lost – on January 1, 1844, through which they called for the founding of the Dominican Republic under the protection of France. The progression of the work of Báez&#x27;s group was what pushed the Trinitarios, led by Francisco del Rosario Sánchez, to establish an alliance with a sector of the conservatives headed by Tomás Bobadilla. Together they wrote the Manifesto of January 16, which also called for the constitution of the Dominican Republic, but as a sovereign state. He changed his mind once he saw the popular fervor and decided that the time had come to part ways with Port-au-Prince.

A few days later, he was released and returned to Azua with the expeditionary force, alongside his leader Pedro Santana, with whom he established good relations. Using his powers as general-in-chief of the Southern Front, Santana appointed Báez to the rank of colonel, and as such he was close to the events that culminated in the Battle of Azua. Once the campaign was over, Báez found that the Haitian troops, when they captured and burned Azua, caused the destruction of much of his family&#x27;s wealth. In the following years, Báez&#x27;s political prominence would bring him considerable losses of his assets. Santana and Báez agreed on the convenience of seeking French protection, both convinced that the country lacked the resources to face the Haitian military threat. When the Trinitarios dismissed the conservatives from the Central Government Board – the provisional collegiate government established on February 27 – Báez was one of those who had to hide and requested asylum at the French consulate. During the first years after independence, despite his ability, Báez was a background figure, possibly because he remained in the minds of many who had tried to oppose the birth of the Republic. Some versions later propagated by his enemies confirmed details of the denunciation of the conspiracy led by the Trinitarios. Although Santana considered him one of his own, it seems that in those years he kept him at a certain distance, perhaps considering him as an individual with too much personal independence.

==Constitution of 1844==

Despite his equivocal attitude towards the independence, Báez had to be taken into account for his talent and his relationships in Azua and other places with prominent social figures. He was elected to the constituent assembly that met in San Cristóbal and approved the first constitution of the Dominican Republic, on November 6, 1844. Being the most capable of said constituent body, he took the main initiatives in the work. At his motion, it was agreed that the persons of the constituents were inviolable while they performed their functions, a way of distancing themselves from the overwhelming influence of Santana. In those days, a situation of tension developed between the members of the Central Government Board and the constituents, despite the fact that both parties had conservative positions. Several of the delegates to the assembly showed reluctance to the absolute power to which Santana aspired. This only renewed the possible hatred that Santana could have had in those days towards Báez.

Due to Báez&#x27;s experience in the constituent assembly of Port-au-Prince the previous year, the delegates meeting in San Cristobal agreed that he would direct the commission in charge of drafting the draft constitution. The bulk of the document appears to have been the work of Báez. Understanding that the establishment of a modern political order was coming, similar to that existing in “civilized” countries, Báez was inspired above all by the United States constitution, although he also took into account the Haitian constitution, which he knew inside and out. The document approved in November 1844 was not exactly liberal in nature – for example, it established restrictions on the right to elect and be elected – but it contained many aspects of the liberal conception, such as the separation of powers. Those Dominican conservatives of 1844, among whom Báez stood out, applied a criterion according to which the conservative regime to which they aspired, with the mandate to safeguard traditional interests, should be governed by precepts taken from the modern liberal current. Santana was appointed president for two consecutive terms in the constitution. But he refused to take office under the rather liberal clauses contained in the Magna Carta. He demanded, without hesitation, that absolute powers be recognized. The constituents were forced to include the famous article 210, which granted the president dictatorial powers.

==First Presidency==
In 1846, Báez was assigned to carry out a mission in France and England in order to obtain recognition of the Dominican Republic. That representation lasted about two years, during which time Báez was isolated from government affairs. Upon returning to the country, he was appointed a member of the Conservative Council, the name of the upper house then, known today in our country as the Senate. In the debates of that organization he distinguished himself as an exponent of proposals aimed at having the country adopt precepts that would prepare it for modern life. Báez was then a conservative with strong shades of liberalism and a bourgeois progressive sense.

Despite his personal notoriety, Báez&#x27;s performance was discreet in those years. Perhaps that was why Santana did not object when he was elected by the congressmen for the presidency of the Republic, on September 24, 1849, after Manuel Jimenes was dismissed and Santiago Espaillat refused to accept the position under the conditions of Santana&#x27;s preeminence. Furthermore, Báez had been the promoter of the appointment of Santana as supreme chief of the army in April 1849, when it was feared that the Haitian ruler Faustin Soulouque would arrive before the walls of Santo Domingo. This relevant position in favor of Santana made it easier for the latter to abandon the doubts he had about such a bold and capable politician. (Báez was the first president to serve the term for which he was elected, something that in the 19th century, they could only achieve it again, in once, and the presidents after 1880, Fernando Arturo de Meriño and Ulises Heureaux).

His administration contrasted with that of Santana, since he maintained Jimenes&#x27;s position of not engaging in repressive acts. He respected freedom of the press and the resentments left by Santana&#x27;s dictatorial management diminished. One of the distinctive notes of this management was the order in the management of budgetary resources, which made it possible to limit the damage caused by the circulation of paper money. Báez also introduced a new military concept, thanks to the advice of French officers who advised offensive maritime actions against Haiti.

Despite the scarcity of resources, the unique conservative president with liberal edges had the good sense to care about the promotion of education. During that period of government, at his request, the San Buenaventura School was founded which, although it did not have a university level, brought together the most select spirits of the country and contributed to forming the generation of intellectuals that followed the birth of the Republic. He managed to gain the support of some young intellectuals and officials, to whom he assigned preeminent positions, such as Manuel María Gautier, Nicolás Ureña and Félix María del Monte. Possibly all of this provoked envy among the members of Santana&#x27;s inner circle, who must have felt displaced by an emerging and rival group. At the end of the four-year period, in February 1853, he transferred the presidency to Santana, who had expressed interest in occupying it again. Shortly after, the new president sharply denounced Báez and ordered his expulsion from the country, possibly because he feared that he would try to become the dominant figure.

From exile, Báez prepared the bases for the open confrontation with Santana. Thus a division emerged within the conservative side, which was unprecedented, since until then Santana had been recognized as its undisputed leader. Santana&#x27;s contradictions with some conservatives had not led to the formation of a rival current. Báez, on the other hand, had a strong political will, intelligence and money, and enjoyed the advantage of having carried out a government administration far superior to that of Santana. Therefore, all those who repudiated Santana&#x27;s actions had no other option than to align themselves behind the leadership of their enemy. Báez was concerned about expanding as much as possible the support base that would allow him to return to power. On the one hand, he questioned the dominance of the reduced oligarchy that accompanied Santana. Perhaps due to his condition as a mulatto, he made it known that he considered himself a representative of the interests of the colored population, against the exclusivism of the whites, and proclaimed himself the standard bearer of the poor majority, especially the peasants. The truth is that, despite such proclamations, he never stopped being a conservative who used the defense of the humble as a demagogic resource. He did not believe in the sovereign realization of the national conglomerate, but in a progress designed to benefit the upper portion of society.

In his fight against Santana, in addition to running as a tribune of the people, Báez tried to attract the support of the greatest number of sectors. He was very skillful in presenting his proposal as compatible with everyone, which is why his popularity grew. First, he offered the clergy compensation and treatment different from that which Santana had given him. Secondly, he sought to obtain the support of the European consuls, in order to question Santana&#x27;s pro-North American position. Additionally, he attracted the support of the liberal and cultured youth of the city of Santo Domingo, who abhorred Santana&#x27;s absolutism. On his way to Santo Domingo, Antonio María Segovia, first Spanish consul, met with Báez in Saint Thomas, the island where he was exiled. The diplomat arrived with the mission of hindering the advance of United States influence. Upon settling in Santo Domingo, Segovia announced that all Dominicans who requested it would receive Spanish nationality, which the Baecistas took advantage of to oppose Santana. Faced with growing popular opposition that had the support of European consuls, Santana chose to resign when it became impossible for him to lease Samaná to the United States.

==Second Presidency==
Shortly after Santana left power, Báez returned to the country and resumed the presidency in October 1856. He immediately ordered General José María Cabral, one of his supporters, to arrest Santana, who was deported. For several weeks the Baecistas were in full euphoria, celebrating Santana&#x27;s misfortune. In his second administration, Báez took a transcendental measure, consisting of issuing a large amount of paper money during the tobacco harvest in the surroundings of Santiago, supposedly with the intention of protecting farmers. This item was already the one that left the largest sums in exports.

During the harvest period, the price of paper money revalued because the amount of gold in circulation increased due to the shipments made by foreign merchants to buy the tobacco harvest. Peasants bought and sold in paper money. When they went into debt with merchants, by acquiring goods in advance for subsistence, they did so at a devalued rate of banknotes, since there was little circulation of gold coins; However, during the harvest, they had to immediately pay off the debts at a revalued rate due to the abundant circulation of gold, which was unfavorable for them. Such seasonal differences in the price were used by merchants to increase their profits through loans at usurious rates.

Alleging that that year the agio against the harvesters had reached exorbitant levels, Báez ordered an issue of national paper pesos, with the declared purpose of improving the prices that the harvesters would receive in transactions with merchants, and subsequently made successive issues until reach several million pesos. Without a doubt, the issuance of paper money and its subsequent devaluation immediately benefited the farmers, who could thus obtain a better price for tobacco and pay more comfortably the debts they had contracted with the merchants. But with the measure the central government entered into open conflict with the commercial sector of Cibao, the richest area of the country. The merchants faced the risk of bankruptcy, not only because their profit margins decreased, but because the government dispatched agents with large amounts of banknotes in order to acquire a considerable portion of the harvest and hoard the largest possible amount of strong pesos in gold.

It is believed that behind this operation could have been hidden the purpose of strengthening the regime at the expense of Cibao&#x27;s regional interests. It is also possible that Báez conceived the measure for personal gain. The result was that the merchants and other urban sectors of Cibao understood that they were being victims of intolerable aggression from the central government, so they chose to declare rebellion. On July 7, 1857, an uprising broke out in Santiago that spread quickly throughout the country and left the Baecistas isolated behind the walls of Santo Domingo. Báez&#x27;s supporters in other places, such as generals Pedro Florentino in La Vega, and José Hungary in Santiago, were neutralized without major difficulty. In addition to Santo Domingo, the pro-government groups were only able to put up resistance in Higüey and Samaná. On that occasion, taken by surprise, the Cibaeño peasants could not express the gratitude that they were surely already beginning to feel for Báez.

The enlightened young people of Santo Domingo gave enthusiastic support to Báez, especially when Santana took charge of the operations against the besieged city. Francisco del Rosario Sánchez and José María Cabral, two highly prestigious figures, directed the defense operations of the capital. After 11 months of siege, Báez capitulated, but remained a power alternative to Santana, who overthrew the Cibao liberals who had started the July 7 revolution.

==Annexation period==
When the annexation to Spain was proclaimed in March 1861, Báez was in Europe and did not interfere with the position taken by his supporters in exile to oppose the fact. Several prominent Baecistas, such as Manuel María Gautier and Valentín Ramírez Báez, brother of the caudillo, had joined Francisco del Rosario Sánchez, in a Revolutionary Junta, to fight against the annexation to the metropolis. Immediately, Báez did not disavow his supporters, but he kept his distance from their efforts. Although, when the annexationist regime was consolidated, Báez offered his services to the Spanish monarchy, surely calculating that it would not take long for conflicts to arise between Santana and the Spanish, which in that case would allow him to become the dominant figure in the Spanish administration. In return, the queen of Spain, Isabel II, named him field marshal. Given the position of their leader, the Baecistas abroad distanced themselves from patriotic efforts.

When the Dominican Restoration War broke out, Báez adopted a cautious attitude and chose to settle in Paris, but at no time did he resign from his position in the Spanish army. The rebellion against Spanish rule had no relationship with the previously existing flags. Former supporters of Santana and Báez participated equally, as well as people who had not taken part in that conflict. This explains why, despite the support that Báez gave to the Spanish government, many of his supporters who had remained within the country took part in the Restoration War. For example, the first president of the restoration government of Santiago, José Antonio Salcedo, was known as a baecista, as was Pedro Florentino, who was appointed head of operations in the south. The leadership that Báez continued to hold was evidenced by the fact that, despite his adherence to Spain, President Salcedo proposed to manage his return to the country to hand over the presidency to him. That loyalty to his leader was one of the reasons for the dismissal and execution of Salcedo, since the head of the restoration army, Gaspar Polanco, had been a supporter of Santana, and the civilian heads of the government in Santiago were leaders of the rebellion against Báez in 1857.

==Third Presidency==
===Return to office===

Báez renounced his rank in the Spanish army only after the peninsular troops abandoned the island, and he believed that his support for the Spanish government had been a mistake that would keep him away from the country for a long time. He settled in Curaçao to wait patiently for the development of events, surely calculating that, in the long run, he had factors in his favor despite his mistake. He was sure he was close to the ripe fruit. The first thing he had to consider was that, with Santana gone, there was no other experienced leader capable of gathering the forces to establish a stable government.

In the midst of the disorderly emergence of the leaders, who had gained power in the restoration struggle, Báez could expect that conflicts would continue to emerge among them that, sooner or later, would regain their validity. Furthermore, he may have realized that he had many supporters in the restoration ranks, among them was José María Cabral, who held the presidency after the departure of the Spanish, was recognized as a former Baecista. The generals of the Restoration, for the most part, lacked cohesion and a complete government project; Only a few had become involved with the liberal principles adopted by the members of the Santiago command. These gave rise to a liberal current that became known as the Blue Party. They proposed to establish an institutionalized democratic regime that would guarantee national sovereignty and the country&#x27;s march towards progress.

The conceptions of the liberals clashed head-on with Báez&#x27;s personal aspirations. However, at first the positions were not completely demarcated, which explains why several restorative generals from the east, followers of Báez, led by Pedro Guillermo, set up a movement in October 1865 to overthrow Cabral, who did not confront them, but instead agreed to hand over the presidency to his former boss, Buenaventura Báez, whom he went to Curaçao to look for in November.

Upon taking possession of the presidency without opposition, Báez appointed Cabral as Secretary of War and Pedro Antonio Pimentel, another of the main champions of the Restoration, as Secretary of the Interior. Gregorio Luperón, among the leading men of arms, refused all dealings with the new president and tried unsuccessfully to build a movement against him. However, some civil figures felt astonished by the course of events, which was expressed by the priest Fernando Arturo de Meriño, in the investiture speech of the new president, when he reproached him for having been indifferent to the struggle of the people against Spanish rule. Uncomfortable due to his dependence on figures whose fidelity was not yet guaranteed, Báez conceived measures to consolidate himself in the presidency. One of them was to distribute 200 pesos, a considerable sum at the time, to the generals who participated in the Restoration War. But above all, he put his administrative skills into play to affirm the idea that only he was capable of making government management more efficient.

His popularity recovered without major difficulties, since the sentiment of the people did not take into account his previous accession to Spain. In a country destroyed after two years of war, the population only wanted the government to improve the situation. In his memoirs, Luperón admits the popularity of his enemy, which he explains by the memory that the monetary devaluation of 1857 left in the peasant population. Báez was concerned at all times to feed back his image as protector of the poor people, which would allow him to differentiate himself from the blue liberals, who under the two Cabral governments gave priority to the recomposition of the commercial elite, a sector that they saw as the generator of progress.

===Clashes with the Blue Party===
In 1866, Báez&#x27;s preeminence had not yet been fully recovered because most of the Restoration generals – the main leading sector of public affairs – had not previously participated in national politics and, therefore, had not They were baecistas. This situation allowed some of the leaders of the Restoration to join forces against Báez, apparently because they perceived that he was working to acquire absolute prerogatives. Cabral went abroad, spoke out against the government and prepared to prepare an expedition to Haiti. Luperón landed in Puerto Plata, where Governor Manuel Rodríguez Objío turned his back on the executive, and the movement spread throughout Cibao. The government assigned Pedro A. Pimentel, Secretary of the Interior, to crush the insurrection, but upon arriving in Cibao he changed sides. Báez fell within a few days and left the country again. It is not surprising that from now on the anti-Baecista party had Cabral, Luperón and Pimentel as leaders. But among them there were almost constant differences, while in the rival party there was a single leadership in the hands of Báez, despite the fact that he relied on leaders of primitive stock.

It was following the fall of Báez&#x27;s third government when the open demarcation between his supporters and the liberals occurred. To settle differences, a provisional triumvirate was appointed among the liberals, but finally the presidency fell to Cabral, the most influential of the three generals. The country was polarized between those who shouted “long live Báez” and those who opposed him. The red and blue colors used in the Cibaeño Revolution were resumed, so many have maintained that the blues of 1866 were the former supporters of Santana, opposed to Báez for personal reasons. As Manuel Rodríguez Objío explains in his book &quot;Relationships&quot;, this is an erroneous conclusion, because the National Party was nourished by the liberals of Santiago and people who were just starting out in politics, although he recognizes that some old Santanistas joined them through their dislike of Báez.

Despite having a large part of the intellectuals, the ineptitude of the blues in managing public affairs was taken advantage of by Báez. In a short time he obtained the support of almost all the leaders who had taken part in the Restoration War. Even Benito Monción and Federico de Jesús García, two of the most notable leaders of the last national war on the Northwest Line, and until shortly before joining the blue ranks, joined the red side. The return of Báez was a demand of the vast majority of the population, so the leaders, who idolized him, tended to take up arms. Hardly in the rest of Dominican history has a similar phenomenon of such popularity of a political leader occurred.

In October 1867, a revolt broke out in Monte Cristi, led by Francisco Antonio Gómez and other Baecista leaders, which could no longer be contained. Luperón narrates in his memoirs that the Cibaeño peasants rose up en masse against the liberals in government and surrounded the cities. Cabral&#x27;s second administration ended up being completely discredited when it was learned that he had authorized negotiations to lease the Samaná peninsula to the United States in exchange for a sum of money and weapons in order to crush the caudillos. Báez and his followers, raising a nationalism of opportunity, accused Cabral of treason.

===Six Years&#x27; War===
The Reds forced Cabral to capitulate in January 1868, and Báez resumed the presidency some time later. Although he rejected the dictatorship offered by his followers, he set out to establish an iron regime that would guarantee his indefinite permanence. As has been expressed, he enjoyed the support of the majority of the people, who, as Sócrates Nolasco highlights in &quot;Old Memories&quot;, firmly believed that the conservative president guaranteed their well-being through high tobacco prices. This support was manifested through the almost unanimity in his favor expressed by the leaders, the strong and influential men of each region of the country.

For their part, the blues represented minority urban circles that believed that it was necessary to subdue the leaders and establish a modern political system. Almost all intellectuals identified with the blues, but the merchants ended up kowtowing to Báez, convinced that he guaranteed stability and was the only politician endowed with the knowledge required to govern efficiently. However, the blue ones were valid because they represented the proposal to establish a modern system. Sure of the reason for their cause, the blues did not care that they had been isolated from the majority of the population. As soon as they were removed from power, the liberals set out to overthrow Báez, for which they proceeded to ally themselves with the Haitians led by Nissage Saget. Cabral headed to Haiti and began operations on the southern border, where he had prestige for having been the last head of the Restoration there. He gained the support of some generals, especially the Ogando brothers, and was able to start a war that lasted for more than four years.

The blue guerrillas in the south proclaimed themselves the embodiment of the Dominican patriotic tradition, emphasizing that independence was in danger due to the annexationist efforts of the red government. Indeed, since he became president and taking advantage of the expansionist interest of Washington government circles, Báez had entered into negotiations to annex the country to the United States. In November 1869 a preliminary convention was signed, after which a plebiscite was held, in which only 11 votes were recorded against the annexation. The consultation was held under conditions of extreme political repression, which prevented people from spontaneously demonstrating. In any case, it is certain that the majority of the population agreed with the annexation for the simple fact that Báez proposed it and because he saw it as a means to escape wars and poverty; but also, with absolute certainty, a not insignificant portion was opposed by patriotic considerations.

As the war led by Cabral gained some support for its patriotic content, the government unleashed measures of terror to extirpate its enemies. The prisons were filled with political prisoners and many opponents were forced to flee the country to avoid assassination or imprisonment. In repressive tasks, the red government used thugs who dedicated themselves to applying terror with an unprecedented ferocity in the country, murdering hundreds of people. These hitmen were widely known in the southwest by their nicknames, such as Solito, Baúl, Musié, Llinito and Mandé. They sneaked behind the guerrilla lines, beyond the Yaque del Sur, where they dedicated themselves to killing everyone they found.

Wherever the blues tried to rebel, the government applied bloody repression, as General José Caminero did in the east, in operations against the guerrilla of the restorer general Eusebio Manzueta, who was captured and shot. In Cibao the liberals could not do anything, given the unwavering support of the peasants who they saw as the savior of high tobacco prices, so the government delegate, Manuel Altagracia Cáceres, did not have to resort to terror.
For various reasons, the country&#x27;s economic situation continued to be desperate. The fate of the fourth Báez administration depended on obtaining extraordinary financial resources, in order to gain time and be able to complete the annexation to the United States. To that end, the government appointed Edward Hartmont as financial agent in England, who received authorization to contract a loan. This Jewish banker committed an extravagant fraud, as he issued bonds for more than 400,000 pounds sterling and only delivered 38,000 to the Dominican government. The small sum received did not allow the government to overcome the precariousness. Not even the secretaries of state received their emoluments regularly. Báez showed consistency, guaranteeing the correct use of scarce resources, and devotion to the Red Party led everyone to show a willingness to sacrifice. The reality was that, after the annexation to the United States, Báez had big business plans planned in conjunction with officials close to President Ulysses S. Grant and the adventurers William Cazneau and Joseph Fabens, inspirers of everything that was woven. This even allowed him to become well acquainted with the abolitionist leader, Frederick Douglass.

The US Senate rejected the annexation treaty in 1871, so Báez&#x27;s fall was a matter of time. The Dominican government still maintained hope in relations with the Americans, since a parallel preliminary treaty had been signed to lease the Samaná peninsula in exchange for annuities of 150,000 dollars, the first of which was paid by Washington. The United States flag flew over the peninsula during those years, which was used by American filibusters to form a company for speculative purposes, the Samana Bay Company. The rental amount was a relatively high sum for the era, but this did not prevent the unrest from spreading. Now, Báez&#x27;s fourth administration had been consolidated despite the difficult economic situation, to the point that the insurrection in the south was defeated at the beginning of 1873. Wherever the blues tried to stick their head out, they were crushed. Under these circumstances, the only way for Báez to fall was if he did so at the hands of his own followers.

Given the impotence of the liberals and the wear and tear of the administration, it did not take long for various opposition demonstrations to take place within the ranks of the reds against their president. The focus of discontent was located on the Northwest Line. To complete the wear and tear, on November 25, 1873, the pillars of Baecism in Cibao, Ignacio María González, governor of Puerto Plata, and Manuel Altagracia Cáceres, government delegate, took up arms and in a few days forced their former boss to present his resignation. In addition to the serious economic situation, a constitutional reform that expanded Báez&#x27;s powers and allowed him to be re-elected indefinitely caused discomfort.

November 25 marked the end of Báez&#x27;s central role in Dominican politics. New national leaders began to emerge from the red ranks, while the blues, under the leadership of Gregorio Luperón, began to slowly expand their influence. The leaders were divided and politics was characterized by continuous chaos, in which each faction tried to seize power in a disorderly manner. It seemed that Báez&#x27;s leadership had been buried, but he did not give up. He still had a considerable portion of the population, and this allowed him to take advantage of the disorder caused by the desire for power. His supporters managed to overthrow the second government of Ignacio María González and he was able to become president for the fifth time at the end of 1876, remaining there for just over a year.

A seasoned politician, Báez realized that in a short time the conditions of the country had undergone changes, that national independence could not be questioned and that public opinion demanded a climate of peace. Upon reaching the presidency for the fifth time, he tried to adapt to these new conditions and proceeded to issue a manifesto in which he criticized himself for previous actions, declaring that democracy and national independence would henceforth be his flags. He immediately received the support of renowned intellectuals of the liberal current, who wanted more than anything else that order and peace be implemented. Even José María Cabral, former head of the blues, accepted a secretary of state in the last administration of the red leader.

However, other blues considered that the president had the intention of establishing himself again as a dictator and that he was secretly deploying annexationist efforts. At the beginning of 1878, a rebellion led by Máximo Grullón and Benito Monción broke out on the Northwest Line, which was followed by other leaders. In the east Cesáreo Guillermo rose, who swept away the government troops in Pomarrosa, near Guerra. Soon, Báez was forced to flee the country, this time for good. In October 1879, Gregorio Luperón overthrew President Cesáreo Guillermo, thus beginning a stable order, characterized by the preponderance of the blues. The seditious attempts of the leaders of the other bands could be crushed, although they required the second blue president, the priest Fernando Arturo de Meriño, to assign himself dictatorial powers and order the summary execution of those who took up arms.

==Death==

During those years the country experienced a phase of prosperity and conditions changed rapidly. The once prominent figure of Báez lost validity although he continued to be missed by many former followers. Báez died in his home in Hormigueros, in western Puerto Rico, in 1884. The most renowned leaders of the Red Party, such as Manuel María Gautier, chose to ally themselves with Ulises Heureaux, Luperón&#x27;s pupil who ended up betraying him and adopting the principles autocratic of his former enemies. The forgotten Báez was reincarnated, in a certain way, in Heureaux&#x27;s autocratic replacement.

He is buried in the Basilica Cathedral of Santa María la Menor.

Genealogical studies have identified President Báez, and President Espaillat as well, as the most recent common ancestors for most of the Dominican oligarchy, since their offspring managed to establish bonds with the most rich and powerful families from Santiago, and thus, from the country.

<text>Roberto Martin Antonio Bonilla (, born February 23, 1963) is an American former professional baseball third baseman and outfielder who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1986 to 2001.

Bonilla was one of MLB&#x27;s best batters and overall top players in the late 1980s and early 1990s with powerful hitting strength, as well as a part of the highly successful and pennant contending Pittsburgh Pirates organization around the same time. Bonilla recorded impressive statistics in home runs, RBIs, doubles, extra base hits, and Wins Above Replacement averages, as well as four All-Star selections, three Silver Slugger Awards and was a top candidate for the National League&#x27;s Most Valuable Player award during his tenure with the Pirates. He led the league in extra base hits (78) during the 1990 MLB season and doubles (44) during the 1991 MLB season.

Bonilla signed with the New York Mets during the 1991–92 offseason, becoming the highest-paid player in the league at the time, earning more than $6 million per year. However, he struggled to live up to expectations with the Mets (which made the contract the subject of much criticism) and throughout the rest of his career. He played with the Baltimore Orioles from 1995 to 1996, reaching the American League Championship Series with the team in 1996. He earned two additional All-Star appearances and helped the Florida Marlins win the 1997 World Series.

After being traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers partway through the 1998 season, he signed with the New York Mets for a second time in 1999. When the Mets wanted to release him at the end of the year, he negotiated a settlement whereby the Mets would pay him $1.19 million on July 1 every year from 2011 through 2035, a date that has become known in Mets fandom as &quot;Bobby Bonilla Day&quot;. He is also paid $500,000 by the Orioles every year from 2004 to 2028 due to them also having a deferred contract with him. After two more lackluster seasons, one each with the Atlanta Braves and St. Louis Cardinals, he retired at the end of the 2001 season. Through his 16 years in professional baseball, Bonilla accumulated a .279 batting average, with a .358 on-base percentage and a .472 slugging percentage.

==Playing career==
Bonilla played baseball at Herbert H. Lehman High School in the Bronx and graduated in 1981. He was not selected in the 1981 Major League Baseball draft and spent a semester at New York Institute of Technology in Old Westbury, New York pursuing a degree in computer science. He was signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates after being spotted by scout Syd Thrift at a baseball camp in Europe.

His rise through the Pirates&#x27; farm system came to a halt during spring training in 1985 when he broke his right leg in a collision with teammate Bip Roberts. The Chicago White Sox then acquired him through the Rule 5 draft during the 1985–86 offseason, and Bonilla made his major league debut with the White Sox at the start of the 1986 season. Thrift, then the Pirates&#x27; general manager, reacquired the unhappy Bonilla in exchange for pitcher José DeLeón later that year. Bonilla also played from 1984 to 1988 with the Mayagüez Indians of the Puerto Rican Winter League.

===Pittsburgh Pirates===
Bonilla became the Pirates&#x27; starting third baseman in 1987, but after committing 67 errors over his next two seasons, manager Jim Leyland moved him to right field. There he formed a formidable combination alongside stars Barry Bonds and Andy Van Slyke and helped propel the Pittsburgh Pirates to two of their three straight National League East Division titles from 1990 to 1992.

From 1986 to 1991, Bonilla had a .284 batting average, with 868 hits, 191 doubles, 114 home runs, and 500 runs batted in (RBIs). He led the league in extra base hits in 1990, and in doubles in 1991. In those years he placed second and third, respectively, in National League MVP voting. Bonilla also won three Silver Slugger Awards and made the All-Star team four years in a row. On October 28, 1991, he became a free agent.

===New York Mets===

Bonilla signed a five-year, $29 million contract (equivalent to $ today) with the New York Mets on December 2, 1991. The $6.1 million he received in 1992 was a record for a single season by a margin of $2.3 million. He became the highest-paid player in the National League from 1992 to 1994. However, his offensive production diminished somewhat, finishing with a .278 batting average, 91 home runs, and 277 runs batted in during his three-and-a-half-year tenure with the Mets. Despite this, Bonilla ended up participating in two more All-Star Games (1993 and 1995) and hit a career-high 34 home runs in 1993.

Bonilla&#x27;s time with the Mets was marked by a contentious relationship with New York baseball media. In his introductory press conference after signing with the organization, he challenged them by stating, &quot;I know you all are gonna try, but you&#x27;re not gonna be able to wipe the smile off my face.&quot; On another occasion, he called the press box during a game to complain about an error that he was charged with.

===Baltimore Orioles===
Bonilla was acquired along with a player to be named later (Jimmy Williams on August 16) by the Baltimore Orioles from the Mets in exchange for Damon Buford and Alex Ochoa on July 28, 1995. He helped the Orioles reach the 1996 American League Championship Series.

===Florida Marlins===
Following the 1996 season, Bonilla was once again granted free agency, and signed with the Florida Marlins, reuniting with his old manager, Jim Leyland, where he helped the Marlins win the 1997 World Series. He returned to the Marlins for the 1998 season and batted .278 through 18 games.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
On May 14, 1998, the Marlins traded Bonilla to the Los Angeles Dodgers, along with Manuel Barrios, Jim Eisenreich, Charles Johnson, and Gary Sheffield, in exchange for Mike Piazza and Todd Zeile. Bonilla spent the rest of the 1998 season with the Dodgers, batting .237, with seven home runs and 30 runs batted in.

===Return to the Mets===
In November 1998, the Mets reacquired Bonilla from the Dodgers in exchange for Mel Rojas. Again, his level of play did not measure up to expectations and he had numerous clashes with manager Bobby Valentine over lack of playing time. His tenure in New York culminated in an incident during the sixth game of the 1999 NLCS during which the Mets were eliminated by the Braves in 11 innings while Bonilla sat in the clubhouse playing cards with teammate Rickey Henderson after the latter asked him to relax him when he was taken out of the game.

After his subpar 1999 season, the Mets released Bonilla, but still owed him $5.9 million. Bonilla and his agent offered the Mets a deal: Bonilla would defer payment for a decade, and the Mets would pay him an annual paycheck of just over $1.19 million on July 1, starting in 2011 and ending in 2035, adding up to a total payout of $29.8 million. Some fans refer to these payments on July 1 as &quot;Bobby Bonilla Day&quot;. Mets owner Fred Wilpon accepted the deal mostly because he was heavily invested with Ponzi scheme operator Bernie Madoff, and the 10 percent returns he thought he was getting on his investments with Madoff outweighed the eight percent interest the Mets would be paying on Bonilla&#x27;s initial $5.9 million. As a result, the payout was a subject of inquiry during the Madoff investment scandal investigation when it came to light in 2008. Bonilla also has a second deferred-contract plan with the Mets and Baltimore Orioles that was initiated in 2004 and pays him $500,000 a year for 25 years.

===Atlanta Braves===
Bonilla signed with the Braves in 2000 and played a mostly uneventful 114 games for them. He achieved his highest batting average (.255) since the 1997 season, although he hit only five home runs, a far cry from his career high of 34.

===St. Louis Cardinals===
In 2001, he was signed by the St. Louis Cardinals, but injuries reduced his playing time. He played his final game on October 7, 2001, and finished the season with a .213 average, 37 hits, five home runs, and 21 runs batted in. He retired after the season finished citing &quot;injuries and reduced playing time&quot; as the main reason for his decision. Contrary to common belief that Bonilla&#x27;s injuries led to Albert Pujols making the Cardinals&#x27; roster, manager Tony La Russa stated that Pujols had earned a roster spot before Bonilla&#x27;s injury issues.

Overall, Bonilla finished his career with one championship, six All-Star appearances, 2,010 hits, 287 home runs, 1,173 runs batted in, and a career .279 batting average.

==Personal life==

Bonilla married Migdalia, known as Millie, in the late 1980s. They had met at Herbert Lehman High School in the Bronx. They had two children together before divorcing in 2009.

==Philanthropy==

In February 1992, Bonilla and his wife Millie started the Bobby and Millie Bonilla Public School Fund with $35,000. The fund benefits schools attended by Bonilla and his wife by contributing $500 for every run he batted in for the Mets. Bonilla participated in the Players Trust All-Star Golf Tournament, organized by Dave Winfield and Joe Mauer in 2014.

<doc id="905906" wikidata="Q2309994" url="?curid=905906" title="Empire Records">
<text>Empire Records is a 1995 American coming-of-age comedy-drama film directed by Allan Moyle, written by Carol Heikkinen, and starring an ensemble cast including Anthony LaPaglia, Maxwell Caulfield, Debi Mazar, Rory Cochrane, Johnny Whitworth, Robin Tunney, Renée Zellweger, and Liv Tyler. The plot follows a group of record store employees over the course of one exceptional day. The employees try to stop the store from being sold to a large chain, and learn about each other along the way.

&quot;Empire Records&quot; was theatrically released in the United States on September 22, 1995, by Warner Bros. to generally negative reviews and major box office losses. It has since gone on to become a cult classic, with several of its stars launching successful careers.

==Plot==

At independent record store Empire Records in Delaware, employee Lucas has been tasked by store manager Joe with closing the store for the first time. While counting the day&#x27;s receipts in Joe&#x27;s office, he discovers the store is about to be sold and converted into a branch of &quot;Music Town&quot;, a large national chain.

Determined to keep the store independent, Lucas hatches a plan, taking the day&#x27;s cash receipts of approximately $9,000 to a casino in Atlantic City to quadruple it playing craps. Though successfully doubling the money on his first roll, he loses everything on the second.

The following morning, fellow Empire employees A.J. and Mark find Lucas, who confides in them about the previous night&#x27;s events, just before riding off on his motorcycle. Joe arrives and quickly receives frantic phone calls about the missing deposit from both the bank and the store&#x27;s owner, Mitchell Beck.

Other employees arrive, including overachieving high school student Corey and her uninhibited best friend Gina. Hostile employee Deb, who has survived an apparent suicide attempt, also arrives. Deb then goes into the bathroom and shaves her head. Upon Lucas&#x27; arrival, Joe confronts him about the missing deposit and Lucas confirms the money was lost. Joe explains his anti-&quot;Music Town&quot; plan to the employees – he had saved enough money to become part-owner of the store to save it, but will now be $9,000 short as he must cover the missing money with Mitchell.

Joe is distracted from the crisis due to a major store event: Rex Manning Day. The washed-up 1980s pop idol is holding an autograph session at the store for fans of his latest album &quot;Back with More&quot;. The unenthused staff mock both Manning and the event, and ultimately many of the fans showing up to meet him are either older women or gay men.

Though detained by Joe in his office, Lucas nonetheless apprehends a belligerent young shoplifter who identifies himself only as &quot;Warren Beatty&quot;. He is taken away by police but vows to return seeking revenge. Encouraged by Gina, Corey indulges her schoolgirl crush on Manning by attempting to seduce him, but winds up humiliated and dejected; A.J. then chooses this inopportune time to confess his love to Corey, which she rejects. After Gina and Corey argue, Gina has sex with Manning. When the staff discover this, A.J. attacks Manning, Gina reveals Corey&#x27;s addiction to amphetamines, Corey hysterically trashes the store, and Joe tells Manning to leave.

Deb surprisingly attempts to cheer Corey up, and in return Corey holds a mock funeral for Deb with the whole staff. The shoplifter &quot;Warren&quot; returns with a gun (ultimately loaded with blanks), and Lucas defuses the situation by revealing that he himself was a troubled youth until he was taken in and saved by Joe. Joe in turn offers &quot;Warren&quot; a job at the store and Warren happily accepts.

After the police leave, Lucas admits defeat and suggests confessing the truth about the missing money to Mitchell. The staff try to replace the missing money but can raise only $3,000. Suddenly inspired, Mark runs in front of the news crew covering Warren&#x27;s holdup, announcing on live TV a late-night benefit party at the store to &quot;Save the Empire&quot;. An impromptu concert on the roof by Gina and Berko, another employee, raises funds so Joe can hand the money raised to Mitchell for the lost amount. Mitchell then offers to sell the store &quot;cheap&quot; to Joe, not wanting to deal with Empire Records anymore.

Corey finally finds A.J. on the roof fixing the Empire Records sign and confesses that she loves him, too. He decides to attend art school in Boston to be near her while she attends Harvard. They kiss, and the staff ends the long day with a dance party on the roof.

==Cast==
==Production==
Heikkinen heard a story, while working at Tower Video (in college) in West Hollywood, of theft by an employee who later came back to the store. In the second draft, Heikkinen added a storyline of a corporate takeover threat. Heikkinen wrote a draft where Corey wanted to meet Rex Manning, but someone else wrote a draft where Corey (a virgin who just got into Harvard) wanted to lose her virginity&lt;ref name=&quot;Moviedude18/ER-Heikkinen&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; to Rex Manning. Heikkinen tried to write a story like &quot;Car Wash,&quot; which took place over one day, at a record store.

Heikkinen based the film on her time working in the video department at Tower Records (in high school) store #166 (Christown Mall) in Phoenix, Arizona, later working at the Tower Video on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, California.&lt;ref name=&quot;slashfilm/empire-records-&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wehohi/tower-1970&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Tower Records went into bankruptcy, and all Tower stores in the U.S. were closed by 2006. Just the names of real people (Marc, Berko, and Corey) were used for characters in the script.

Heikkinen&#x27;s spec script&lt;ref name=&quot;nzpod/ERm/heikkinen&quot;&gt; mp3 RSS&lt;/ref&gt; was first given to Alan Riche’s producing partner, Tony Ludwig, by William Morris agent Rob Carlson, telling Riche that Heikkinen had attended Riche’s high school, in Phoenix. They brought the script to Michael Nathanson, president of Regency Pictures, and director Allan Moyle, known for &quot;Pump Up the Volume&quot; became attached.

New Regency got into a bidding war with Warner Bros. over the script. Carol Heikkinen was offered $325,000 up-front and $200,000 if the film was made. Heikkinen was also to receive 1% of any soundtrack royalties and 5% of merchandise sales.

Two days after Regency Enterprises executive Michael Nathanson gave approval to proceed with making &quot;Empire Records&quot;, he was approached with the script for &quot;Clueless&quot;. As he already had a &quot;teen movie&quot; in hand, he turned down the eventual $57 million box office hit, and proceeded with production of the eventual $0.3 million box-office bomb of &quot;Empire Records&quot;.

Moyle spent a month on rehearsals, pilates, dinners, and time for the actors.&lt;ref name=&quot;buzzfeed/11-ER&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Allan came to me and he&#x27;s like, &quot;I think the studio wants to fire you &#x27;cause they think you&#x27;re kind of too cute to be depressed,&quot;...&quot;I was like, &quot;Well, I could shave my head.&quot; And then I shaved my head, which made everyone very nervous &#x27;cause it was live so if the film got damaged or anything went wrong, we could not do that over again. — Robin Tunney 

Exteriors for the record store facade&lt;ref name=&quot;livethemovies/empire-records&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; were filmed at 15 South Front Street in Wilmington, North Carolina, in a nightclub, then known as The Palladium, that had a few feet of space converted into a replica of the store set which was located at Carolco (now Screen Gems) studios, and backed with a large picture of the rest of the store.

Exteriors in the Wilmington, North Carolina area also include Riverfront Park; Caffe Phoenix at 9 South Front Street; Cape Fear Memorial Bridge; Wrightsville Beach.&lt;ref name=&quot;wS-N/er-2008&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Interiors for the record store, as a vast, two-story building was constructed in a warehouse, with views out windows constructed in forced perspective, not CGI.&lt;ref name=&quot;crookedmarquee/ER&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Allan Moyle&#x27;s then-wife Dianna Miranda is Lilly, on rollerskates (scenes deleted).

Interiors for the Atlantic City casino were constructed out of the Coconut Grove room at the Ambassador Hotel on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles (Regency President Michael Nathanson’s then-girlfriend (Kimber Sissons, as Kimber Monroe) is the woman who tells Lucas, “You’re sex”).

Exteriors for Corey Mason&#x27;s House were filmed at Forest Hills Drive.&lt;ref name=&quot;enjoytravel/movies-wilmington&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rex Manning music video &quot;Say No More, Mon Amour&quot; was shot prior to principal photography, and was shot on Wrightsville Beach in North Carolina in one day. It was intended to be only a 17-second dance move piece for the main actors to make fun of in the film. Jordan Dawes, the director of the music video, shot for the entire day and gave the producers a complete music video that was almost five minutes in length.

Tobey Maguire asked director Allan Moyle to release him from his part in the film, Moyle agreed, and all of Maguire&#x27;s scenes were deleted from the final film, and Maguire then sought help for a drinking problem.

==Release==
The film was supposed to be a wide release, that got pulled back to a two-week run on very few screens, due to the negative second test screening reviews from a Latino audience, after the positive reviews from a suburban white audience.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc.net.au/empire-records&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of 1,000-plus screens, they put it on 87. Instead of flooding malls in cities across the country, it showed in four. There was no premiere; no national advertising campaign.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was a severe flop, making only $150,800 in its opening weekend, and by the end of its run in North America it earned a total of $303,841 against its $10 million budget.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 35% based on reviews from 37 critics. The site&#x27;s consensus is: &quot;Despite a terrific soundtrack and a strong early performance from Renee Zellweger, &quot;Empire Records&quot; is mostly a silly and predictable teen dramedy.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 47 out of 100 based on reviews from 7 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

&quot;Variety&quot; wrote &quot;Nice look, great sound and indefinable youth luster will make &quot;Records&quot; play OK on vid, especially at parties where frenetic aimlessness is not a negative&quot;, calling &quot;Empire Records&quot; a &quot;soundtrack in search of a movie&quot;, describing the film as &quot;one teen-music effort that never finds a groove&quot; before adding that &quot;as far as chart action goes, it could use a bullet -- to put it out of its B.O. misery&quot; 

&quot;TV Guide&quot; gave the film 2 stars out of 5, calling it a &quot;lame comedy&quot; that appeared to be little more than &quot;an elaborate excuse to package and peddle a soundtrack CD.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave the film a negative score of one and a half stars out of four, and referred to it as a &quot;lost cause&quot;, but wrote that some of the actors might have a future in other, better films. LaPaglia, Cochrane, Zellweger, Tyler, Embry and Tunney all went on to varying levels of success in the years following &quot;Empire Records&quot;.

Caroline Westbrook of &quot;Empire&quot; magazine, gave it 3 out of 5, saying &quot;For all its faults, the good-natured, quirky humour that this for the most part offers ultimately makes it very hard to dislike.&quot; Ty Burr of Entertainment Weekly called it &quot;too blatant a throwback to crass &#x27;80s teen fodder to really work.&quot;

In 2020, The Guardian wrote: &quot;what saves this film is its unselfconsciously optimistic, goofy, principled spirit. &quot;Empire Records&quot; was about seeing the silver lining even in the most terrible, scrape-the-bottom-of-the-barrel times, forming unlikely friendships and finding family at work, challenging the financial security and mediocrity of signing on the dotted line and “selling out&quot;, and riding out the highs and lows of an industry in its doom-and-gloom phase&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tg/ER-comeback&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==

===Background===
The soundtrack album for &quot;Empire Records&quot; was curated by Mitchell Leib, a music supervisor for the film. The soundtrack was originally attached to Atlantic Records—an affiliate of Warner Bros. at the time—because Warner Bros. had a distribution pact with the film&#x27;s producers, Regency Enterprises. However, the soundtrack album was given to A&amp;M Records in order to obtain the participation of A&amp;M artists the Gin Blossoms, whose track &quot;Til I Hear It from You&quot; was issued as the lead single. Besides the Gin Blossoms, four other A&amp;M acts had new tracks released on the soundtrack album: Ape Hangers, Drill, Innocence Mission, and Lustre.

The album also introduced tracks by Better Than Ezra, Cracker, the Cranberries, Evan Dando (whose cover of Big Star&#x27;s &quot;The Ballad of El Goodo&quot; featured &quot;Empire Records&quot; female lead Liv Tyler on background vocals), and Toad The Wet Sprocket, and by unsigned acts the Martinis, Please, and Coyote Shivers. The Martinis—featuring former Pixies members Joey Santiago and Dave Lovering—were recommended by &quot;Hits&quot; magazine president Karen Glauber who Leib brought in as a musical consultant for &quot;Empire Records&quot;, while the film&#x27;s line music supervisor Bob Knickman discovered Please by searching the internet for unsigned talent suitable for the film&#x27;s soundtrack. Coyote Shivers, who played aspiring-musician-turned-store-clerk Berko in the film, became involved in the project by virtue of being the stepfather of Liv Tyler (Shivers being married to Tyler&#x27;s mother, Bebe Buell, at the time).

Two previously released tracks were also included on the original release of the &quot;Empire Records&quot; soundtrack album: &quot;A Girl Like You&quot; by Edwyn Collins and &quot;Ready, Steady, Go&quot; by the Meices (the latter&#x27;s frontman Joe Reineke subsequently led Alien Crime Syndicate). &quot;The Honeymoon Is Over&quot; by the Cruel Sea, a track heard in the film but not featured on the US release of the soundtrack album, was included on the German and Australian releases.

The Gin Blossoms&#x27; &quot;Til I Hear It From You&quot; charted as high as #9, affording the band their first Top 20 hit. Two other tracks from the album had a single release: Edwyn Collins&#x27; &quot;A Girl Like You&quot;, which charted at #32, and the Ape Hangers&#x27; &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Live Today&quot;.

The version of the song &quot;Sugarhigh&quot; that appears in the movie differs significantly from the one included on the soundtrack. The film version has additional lyrics and chorus vocals provided by Renée Zellweger. It was intended only as a rough mix for playback during filming but was included on the soundtrack album because a remastered version was not available. Francis &quot;Coyote&quot; Shivers, the artist who released the song, played the lead singer who performed the song on the rooftop of the store at the end of the movie.

The &quot;Empire Records&quot; soundtrack peaked at No. 63 on the Billboard 200 album chart.

&quot;I think we did end up selling 2 million records, which is fucking unbelievable for a movie that did $147,000 at the box office&quot; — Mitchell Leib, a music supervisor for the film

AllMusic.com rated the soundtrack 4 out of 5.

BuzzFeed.com described the soundtrack as &quot;a collection of B-sides from prominent artists, covers, and new finds&quot;.

In 2010, Gin Blossoms frontman Robin Wilson said of &quot;Empire Records&quot;, &quot;[It&#x27;s] a classic film that only a handful of people really saw, but it definitely made an impact on that generation. It was really cool to have been a part of that&quot;.

Most songs in the film and on the Soundtrack Album are &quot;Provided to YouTube&quot; by their copyright owners.&lt;ref name=&quot;YT/eR-OST&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home media==
On June 3, 2003 Warner Bros. released the Remix: Special Fan Edition DVD of &quot;Empire Records&quot;. The unrated version is 107 minutes long and includes four extra scenes and 17 minutes of additional footage.

For the 2015 Blu-ray release from the film&#x27;s new owner 20th Century Fox, only the theatrical cut has been included, with the extras ported over from the 2003 &quot;Remix! Special Fan Edition&quot; DVD.

By 2020, Empire Records was available to stream on YouTube Movies and Google Play.

==Legacy==
Although &quot;Rex Manning Day&quot; on April 8,&lt;ref name=&quot;2020/04/08/Rexstravaganza&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the date Rex appears at Empire Records in the film, isn’t mentioned in the film, it shows up on a flyer on screen and as a DVD image extra.&lt;ref name=&quot;uproxx/empire-records&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, for &quot;Rex Manning Day&quot;, Brooklyn’s Rough Trade Records dressed its storefront to look like the record store in the film, with Ethan Embry, Johnny Whitworth, and GWAR appearing.

I was just talking to the writer [Carol Heikkinen], and she was saying it’s in one of the drafts...April 8th is the same day they found Kurt Cobain’s body. It’s not the day he died. We shot that the same year they found him, so it represents the death of a rock star. Nobody ever says it in the movie. Nobody ever says April 8th. — Ethan Embry, to TheWrap in 2015

It became an Internet meme among the film&#x27;s fans with #RexManningDay as a recurring trending hashtag on Twitter. GIFs commemorating the event show Embry&#x27;s character bounding down the stairs from the store&#x27;s loft, declaring &quot;Not on Rex Manning Day!!&quot;

In the film, a sign by the cash register shows the logo for the Richard Linklater 1993 film &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;. The Richard Linklater 2003 film, &quot;School of Rock&quot; later references &quot;Empire Records&quot;.

==Musical adaptation==
It was announced on April 6, 2018 that a musical adaptation of the movie was aiming for Broadway in 2020. The announcement stated that the show would be produced by Bill Weiner; would have music and lyrics by Zoe Sarnak and its book written by Carol Heikkinen, but was put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On December 7, 2021, it was announced that a table reading of the musical would be held at Roundabout Studios in New York City, directed by Trip Cullman with a cast featuring Kathryn Gallagher, Drew Gehling and Rebecca Naomi Jones, among others. On March 7, 2024, it was announced that the musical would have its world premiere at the McCarter Theatre Center in Princeton, New Jersey, set to run from September 6 - October 6.
