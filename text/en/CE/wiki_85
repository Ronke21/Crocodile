<text>The 2002 United States Senate elections featured a series of fiercely contested elections that resulted in a victory for the Republican Party, which gained two seats and thus a narrow majority from the Democratic Party in the United States Senate. The Senate seats up for election, known as class 2 Senate seats, were last up for regular election in 1996. The election cycle was held on November 5, 2002, almost 14 months after the September 11, 2001, attacks.

Going into the election, Democrats had a 51–49 majority due to an Independent that caucused with them, however, this was reduced to a 50–49–1 plurality following the death of Democrat Paul Wellstone and the appointment of a member of the Independence Party of Minnesota in his place. The Democrats had originally hoped to do well, as the party holding the presidency historically loses seats in midterm elections, and additionally, the Republicans had 20 seats up for election compared to 14 Democratic seats up for election. In addition, the Republicans had five open seats, while the Democrats and the Independence Party of Minnesota had one each. However, the Republicans were able to hold their 5 open seats and pick the one that was held by the IPM up, while the Democrats held their only open seat. Republicans also defeated 2 Democratic incumbents, while Democrats defeated 1 Republican incumbent. Together with gains made in the House of Representatives, this election was 1 of 3 mid-term elections in which the party in control of the White House did not lose Congressional seats (the others were 1934 and 1998).

Trent Lott led the Senate Republicans through this election cycle and was due to become the new Senate Majority Leader upon the retaking of control of the Senate by the Republicans. However, his controversial praise for Strom Thurmond&#x27;s 1948 segregationist Dixiecrat presidential campaign at Thurmond&#x27;s 100th birthday celebration led to Lott&#x27;s stepping-down from Senate leadership, and resulted in Tennessee Republican Bill Frist being selected as the new Senate Majority Leader instead.

This was the only election cycle ever where the party of the incumbent president gained new control of a house of Congress in a midterm election. This is also the last midterm election cycle where the party controlling the White House flipped a senate seat in a state they did not win in the preceding presidential election (in this case, Minnesota). , this was the last Senate election cycle where Republicans won Senate elections in Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, and Virginia.

== Gains, losses and holds ==
===Retirements===

One Independence and four Republicans retired instead of seeking re-election.

===Nomination withdrawn===
One Democrat was originally sought to run re-election but withdrew.
===Defeats===
Two Democrats and two Republicans sought re-election but lost in the primary or general election.

===Post-election changes===
One Republican resigned on December 2, 2002, and was replaced by a Republican appointee.
== Final pre-election predictions ==
Several sites and individuals published predictions of competitive seats. These predictions looked at factors such as the strength of the incumbent (if the incumbent was running for re-election) and the other candidates, and the state&#x27;s partisan lean (reflected in part by the state&#x27;s Cook Partisan Voting Index rating). The predictions assigned ratings to each seat, indicating the predicted advantage that a party had in winning that seat. Most election predictors used:
* &quot;tossup&quot;: no advantage
* &quot;tilt&quot; (used by some predictors): advantage that is not quite as strong as &quot;lean&quot;
* &quot;lean&quot;: slight advantage
* &quot;likely&quot;: significant, but surmountable, advantage
* &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;solid&quot;: near-certain chance of victory

== Alabama ==

Since around 1980, Alabama voters had increasingly voted for Republican candidates at the federal level, especially in Presidential elections. By contrast, Democratic candidates had been elected to many state-level offices and comprised a longstanding majority in the Alabama Legislature.

Incumbent Republican Jeff Sessions was not challenged in the primary, and easily won re-election to a second term.

Sessions was not challenged in the primary.


McPhillips received a large amount of support in the southern part of the state, but Parker won the most votes. Sowell endorsed Parker for the run-off.







== Alaska ==


Incumbent Ted Stevens ran for and won a seventh term. He faced perennial candidate Frank Vondersaar, the Democratic nominee, journalist Jim Sykes, the Green Party nominee, and several other independent candidates in his bid for re-election. Ultimately, Stevens crushed his opponents to win what would be his last term in the Senate, allowing him to win with the largest margin of victory for any Senate election in Alaska, as well as the highest percentage of the vote in any of his elections.





== Arkansas ==

Incumbent Republican Tim Hutchinson ran for a second term, but lost re-election to Arkansas Attorney General Mark Pryor.





== Colorado ==

Incumbent Republican Wayne Allard won re-election to a second term.









== Delaware ==

Incumbent Democrat Joe Biden won re-election to a sixth term.




== Georgia ==

Incumbent Democrat Max Cleland ran for re-election to a second term, but lost to Republican Saxby Chambliss.

Chambliss&#x27;s campaign used the refrain of national defense and security, but drew criticism for television ads that paired images of Cleland and Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein, and for questioning the commitment to homeland security of his opponent, a triple amputee and decorated Vietnam veteran. Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona said of one ad: &quot;It&#x27;s worse than disgraceful. It&#x27;s reprehensible.&quot; McCain, along with Republican Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, made significant complaints to the Republican National Committee until the ads were taken down. Nevertheless, Chambliss defeated Cleland by nearly seven percentage points.




== Idaho ==

Incumbent Republican Larry Craig won re-election to a third term.










== Illinois ==

Incumbent Democrat Dick Durbin won re-election to a second term. Durbin faced off against State Representative and future Illinois House minority leader Jim Durkin, whom he was able to beat, ensuring his return to the Senate.





Durbin won re-election to a second term easily, carrying a majority of the states 102 counties.



== Iowa ==

Incumbent Democrat Tom Harkin won re-election to a fourth term. Harkin was opposed in the general election by United States Congressman Greg Ganske, who fought off a surprisingly difficult challenger in the Republican primary. Though Harkin had narrowly defeated his opponent six years earlier, he was able to defeat Ganske by a fairly comfortable margin to win re-election.









== Kansas ==

Incumbent Pat Roberts won re-election to a second term easily because no Democrat filed to run.






== Kentucky ==

Incumbent Republican Mitch McConnell won re-election to a fourth term.





== Louisiana ==

Incumbent Democrat Mary Landrieu won re-election to a second term.

During the run-off, Landrieu was out-spent three-to-one by Republican contender Suzanne Haik Terrell, the Louisiana Elections Commissioner. Terrell also had prominent Republicans including President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney visit Louisiana to campaign on her behalf. Republicans, confident of victory having gained seats in the elections to the House of Representatives and to the Senate, solidifying control of the former and taking control of the latter, publicly called the election &quot;Operation Icing on the Cake&quot;. Some Democrats responded by calling their efforts &quot;Operation Wipe that Smirk off of Bush&#x27;s Face&quot; and dubbed Landrieu&#x27;s subsequent run-off victory, &quot;Operation Pie in the Face&quot;.




Landrieu pulled off what many considered to be an upset victory. The Republicans believed they would most likely win the race. Before the election many Republicans called the race &quot;operation icing on the cake.&quot; After Landrieu won the runoff Democrats dubbed her victory &quot;operation pie in the face.&quot; The race was close. In terms of rural parishes the vote was split fairly evenly. Landrieu did well in Caddo Parish home of Shreveport, and in East Baton Rouge Parish home of East Baton Rouge. Ultimately though it was Landrieu&#x27;s huge win in Orleans Parish home of New Orleans that pushed her over the finish line. Haik Terrell conceded defeat to Landrieu at 12:38 p.m. EST, congratulating Landrieu on her victory. Landrieu would go on to be re-elected to a third term in 2008.




== Maine ==

Incumbent Republican Susan Collins won re-election to a second term.

Chellie Pingree, State Senator and Senate Majority Leader attacked Collins for supporting the Bush tax cuts. Both candidates opposed the Iraq War in the fall of 2002. However, Collins then supported the congressional resolution to attack Iraq, while Pingree opposed it.

Collins, a popular moderate, was supported by health care groups, environmentalists and gay rights advocates. She handily defeated State Senator Chellie Pingree of North Haven in one of the few U.S. Senate elections in which both major parties nominated women in U.S. history.



== Massachusetts ==

Incumbent Democrat John Kerry won re-election to a fourth term against Libertarian Michael Cloud. The lack of a Republican party candidate caused Cloud to receive the largest percentage of votes for a U.S. Senate candidate in the Libertarian Party&#x27;s history, though this record has since been eclipsed by Joe Miller in Alaska in 2016, and again by Ricky Dale Harrington in Arkansas in 2020.





== Michigan ==

Incumbent Democrat Carl Levin won re-election to a fifth term.




== Minnesota ==

Incumbent Democrat Paul Wellstone was running for re-election to a third term, but died in a plane crash eleven days before the election. The Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL) chose former Vice President and 1984 Presidential candidate Walter Mondale to replace Wellstone on the ballot. Mondale lost to Republican Mayor of Saint Paul Norm Coleman. The day before the election, Independence Governor Jesse Ventura had appointed Dean Barkley (IP) to serve the rest of Wellstone&#x27;s term. , this was the last Senate election in Minnesota won by a Republican.

In the primaries, Paul Wellstone defeated Dick Franson 93% to 5% and Norm Coleman defeated Jack Shepard 95% to 5%.

At the time of his death, Wellstone was slightly ahead in the polls. After Walter Mondale was chosen as the DFL candidate, in a poll taken a few days before the election Mondale was leading 51% to 45%. Early on Election Day, Mondale was leading in votes. By nightfall, however, Norm Coleman pulled ahead, winning by 49.5 percent to 47.3 percent.

Paul Wellstone still appeared on the ballot despite his death, despite a court order replacing Wellstone&#x27;s name with Mondale&#x27;s.






== Mississippi ==

Incumbent Republican Thad Cochran overwhelmingly won re-election to a fifth term. The Democratic Party did not field a candidate, resulting in Reform Party candidate Shawn O&#x27;Hara winning 15.42% of the vote.



== Missouri (special) ==

In the 2000 election, Mel Carnahan, who had died in a plane crash three weeks before, remained on the ballot for election to the Senate. Carnahan beat his Republican opponent, John Ashcroft, who did not legally contest being defeated by a dead candidate. Carnahan&#x27;s successor as governor, Roger B. Wilson, fulfilled his pre-election promise to appoint Carnahan&#x27;s widow in her husband&#x27;s place and a special election was scheduled for 2002.

The election would decide who would serve the rest of Senator-elect Mel Carnahan&#x27;s term, after he died. The winner would serve four more years until the next election in 2006. Governor Roger Wilson had appointed Carnahan&#x27;s widow Jean to serve temporarily. She then ran for the remainder of the term. Republican Jim Talent defeated her narrowly. While the race would have flipped control of the Senate from the Democrats to the Republicans, the Senate was adjourned, so no change in leadership occurred until the 108th Congress began in January 2003.








National security and Carnahan&#x27;s vote against fellow Missourian John Ashcroft as attorney general were major issues in the campaign. Republicans argued Carnahan owed her vote to Ashcroft, who had lost his bid for re-election to the Senate to Carnahan&#x27;s husband. Talent, citing Carnahan&#x27;s votes against homeland-security legislation and missile defense, accused her of being soft on national security, which she objected to, saying he was &quot;doubt[ing] her patriotism.&quot;

Jack Abramoff contributed $2,000 to Talent&#x27;s 2002 senatorial campaign, and Preston Gates &amp; Ellis, a former Abramoff employer, had also contributed $1,000 to Talent&#x27;s campaign. Talent later returned both contributions. Talent&#x27;s win returned Republican control of the Senate which had been under slight Democratic dominance resulting from Vermont junior senator Jim Jeffords&#x27;s decision to renounce the Republican Party, turning independent and making the choice to caucus with the Democrats.

Talent&#x27;s victory was certified November 21, 2002, one day before Congress adjourned, which prevented Republicans from claiming a senate majority. He automatically became a Senator the following day because, under federal law, he formally took office as soon as special election results were certified and the day after both chambers of Congress adjourned. Because Republicans would hold the majority in the following Congress, they saw no need to hold a special session in the 107th to take advantage of their brief majority.





== Montana ==

Incumbent Democrat Max Baucus won re-election to a fifth term.




The election got national attention when Baucus&#x27;s opponent, state senator Mike Taylor, accused Baucus of having implied that Taylor was gay in a campaign ad. The ad was paid for by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, though designed by the Baucus campaign. The ad, which alleged that Taylor had embezzled funds from the cosmetology school he once owned, showed footage from the early 1980s of Taylor massaging another man&#x27;s face while wearing a tight suit with an open shirt. Due to financial shortages making it impossible for him to continue the race and having concerns about the effect the race was having on his family, Taylor dropped out of the race and Baucus won with 63 percent of the vote.





== Nebraska ==

Incumbent Republican Chuck Hagel won re-election to a second term.









== New Hampshire ==

Incumbent Republican/Independent U.S. Senator Bob Smith was defeated in the Republican primary and denied renomination. Republican John E. Sununu won the open seat. As of 2017, this is the last time a Republican has won the Class 2 Senate seat in New Hampshire.

Senator Bob Smith, the incumbent Republican Senator, briefly left the party in 1999 to run for president as an independent, claiming that the Republican platform was &quot;not worth the paper it&#x27;s written on&quot;. He rejoined the GOP a few months later, saying he made a mistake. Nonetheless, the party never fully forgave him, and some of his fellow Republican Senators went so far as to endorse his primary opponent, Rep. John Sununu, who would go on to win by 8 points.



During the campaign, there was a major scandal that involved the use of a telemarketing firm hired by that state&#x27;s Republican Party (NHGOP) for election tampering. The GOP Marketplace, based in Northern Virginia, jammed another phone bank being used by the state Democratic Party and the firefighters&#x27; union for efforts to turn out voters on behalf of New Hampshire Governor Jeanne Shaheen on Election Day. The tampering involved using a call center to jam the phone lines of a Get Out the Vote (GOTV) operation. In the end, 900 calls were made for 45 minutes of disruption to the Democratic-leaning call centers. In addition to criminal prosecutions, disclosures in the case came from a civil suit filed by the state&#x27;s Democratic Party against the state&#x27;s Republican Party (now settled). Four of those involved were convicted of, or pleaded guilty to, federal crimes and sentenced to prison for their involvement . One conviction was reversed by an appeals court, a decision prosecutors appealed. James Tobin, the defendant freed on appeal, was later indicted on charges of lying to the FBI during the original investigation.




== New Jersey ==

The race was to originally feature Democrat Robert Torricelli, who was running for a second term in the seat he had won when former Senator Bill Bradley elected not to run for a fourth term in 1996 and who had been the state&#x27;s senior Senator following Frank Lautenberg&#x27;s retirement at the end of the 106th United States Congress, against former West Windsor Township mayor Douglas Forrester, who had won the Republican nomination.

Torricelli, however, had been the target of an ethics probe and eventually dropped out of the race on September 30 due to ethical concerns and poor poll numbers against Forrester, a relatively unknown opponent. The New Jersey Democratic Party convinced the retired Lautenberg to join the race after Torricelli dropped out. In the case of &quot;The New Jersey Democratic Party v. Samson&quot;, 175 N.J. 178 (2002), Forrester sued to stop Democratic Party efforts to have Lautenberg replace Torricelli. The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled unanimously on October 2 that the party could switch Lautenberg&#x27;s name in for Sen. Torricelli&#x27;s on the ballot. Forrester received the endorsement of President George W. Bush.

In the general election, Lautenberg defeated Forrester and became the state&#x27;s junior Senator for the second time when he was sworn in on January 3, 2003 (Bradley, elected in 1978, was the senior Senator during Lautenberg&#x27;s first fourteen years in office and Jon Corzine, who was elected to Lautenberg&#x27;s old Senate seat, became the senior Senator in 2003 as Lautenberg&#x27;s previous eighteen years in the Senate were not counted towards seniority.





== New Mexico ==

Incumbent Republican Pete Domenici won re-election to a sixth term. As of 2022, this is the last Senate election in New Mexico won by a Republican.








== North Carolina ==

Incumbent Republican Jesse Helms decided to retire due to health issues. Republican Elizabeth Dole won the open seat over Democrat Erskine Bowles, former White House Chief of Staff.









== Oklahoma ==

Incumbent Republican Jim Inhofe won re-election to a second term over Democrat David Walters, a former Governor of the state.




== Oregon ==

Incumbent Republican Gordon Smith ran for re-election to a second term. Smith, who had only served one term in the U.S. Senate, had a popularity rating slightly lower than 50% before the summer of 2002 began. Oregon Secretary of State Bill Bradbury emerged as the Democratic nominee, and though a competitive gubernatorial election occurred at the same time, Bradbury&#x27;s campaign was never able to gain traction and Smith overwhelmingly won re-election. As of 2022, this is the last Senate election in Oregon won by a Republican.










== Rhode Island ==

Incumbent Democrat Jack Reed won re-election to a second term. Reed was an extremely popular senator, with a May Brown University poll showing the incumbent with a 73% approval rating, higher than any other elected lawmaker in the state. Reed&#x27;s best performance was in Providence County, where he won with over 80% of the vote over Republican Robert Tingle, casino pit boss and nominee for RI-02 in 2000







== South Carolina ==

Long-time Incumbent Strom Thurmond decided to retire at the age of 100, becoming the first Centenarian to ever serve in Congress, and at that time was the longest serving Senator in U.S. history (a record later surpassed by West Virginia&#x27;s Robert Byrd). Republican Lindsey Graham won the open seat.

Alex Sanders, the former president of the College of Charleston, entered the race and faced no opposition from South Carolina Democrats, thereby avoiding a primary election.

Representative Lindsey Graham had no challenge for the Republican nomination and thus avoided a primary election. This was due in large part because the South Carolina Republicans were preoccupied with the gubernatorial race, and also because potential rivals were deterred by the huge financial war chest Graham had amassed early in the campaign.

The election campaign between Graham and Sanders was bitterly fought. Graham campaigned that he had a consistent conservative voting record that he claimed closely matched that of outgoing Senator Strom Thurmond. Sanders campaigned on his membership in the NAACP, the Sons of Confederate Veterans, and the National Rifle Association of America (NRA). He said that he was against the death penalty for religious reasons, supported abortion rights, and supported greater government involvement in education. Graham attacked Sanders for these positions consistently throughout the campaign, and Sanders hit back at Graham for wanting to privatize Social Security. Graham won the election by slightly over 10 percent.




== South Dakota ==

Incumbent Democrat Tim Johnson won re-election to a second term by a margin of 524 votes, defeated Republican incumbent U.S. Representative John Thune.



Thune, who was considered a rising star in his party, ran against Tim Johnson, who narrowly won his first senate election in 1996. Thune launched a television advertising campaign mentioning al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein, controversially contending that both were seeking nuclear weapons and that the country needed a missile defense system, something Johnson voted against 29 times and that Thune supported. Johnson attacked Thune for politicizing national security. President George W. Bush campaigned for Thune in late October. More than $20 million was spent in the election. Both candidates had raised over $5 million each.

Johnson narrowly prevailed over Thune by a mere 524 votes. Despite the extreme closeness of the election, Thune did not contest the results and conceded defeat on the late afternoon of November 9. Johnson&#x27;s narrow victory may be attributed to his strong support in Oglala Lakota County. Thune also underperformed in typically Republican areas. Johnson was sworn in for a second term on January 3, 2003. Thune would later be elected to the other Senate seat in 2004, defeating Minority Leader Tom Daschle. He would then serve with Johnson in 2005.




== Tennessee ==

Incumbent Republican Fred Thompson decided to retire. Republican Lamar Alexander, former U.S. Secretary of Education and former Governor of Tennessee, won the open seat over Democrat Bob Clement, U.S. Representative.







Alexander raised $2 million through June 2002. Clement attacked the Governor for his corporate connections and business dealings. By October, Clement had nearly raised $900,000, while Alexander raised almost $3 million. Bush, who had a 60% approval rating in the state, helped campaign and raise money for Alexander. Alexander was also endorsed by the National Rifle Association of America (NRA).




== Texas ==

Incumbent Republican Phil Gramm decided to retire instead of seeking a fourth term. Republican John Cornyn won the open seat over the Democratic Mayor of Dallas, Ron Kirk.

Despite the fact that Texas is a red state, Kirk ran on a socially progressive platform: supporting abortion rights and opposing Bush judicial nominee Priscilla Owen, although Kirk was a former George W. Bush supporter. He also supported increases in defense spending, such as Bush&#x27;s proposed $48 billion increase in military spending, except for the money Bush wanted to use for missile defense. Kirk had the support of former Governor Ann Richards and former U.S. Senator Lloyd Bentsen.

Cornyn was criticized for taking campaign money from Enron and other controversial companies.

The race was perceived as close, with an October Dallas Morning News poll showing Cornyn leading 47% to 37%. However, Cornyn won election by 12 percent. A record $18 million was spent in the election.




== Virginia ==

Incumbent Republican John Warner won re-election to a fifth term, making him one of only three Virginia U.S. Senators to serve five or more terms. No Democrat ran against Warner, and he won every single county and city in the state with at least 60% of the vote. As of 2022, this is the last Senate election in Virginia won by a Republican.





== West Virginia ==

Incumbent Democrat Jay Rockefeller won re-election to a fourth term over Republican State Senator Jay Wolfe.

Rockefeller was the heavy favorite, with one poll showed him leading 72% to 17%. Rockefeller had $2.9 million cash on hand to Wolfe at $100,536 (In mid-October). Wolfe was endorsed by President George W. Bush and the National Rifle Association of America (NRA), but it wasn&#x27;t enough to make the election competitive. Rockefeller won by a margin of over 25 percent.



== Wyoming ==

Incumbent Republican Mike Enzi won re-election to a second term.




Enzi stated that his top priorities were education, jobs, national security and retirement security. He had $485,000 cash on hand in June 2002, when Joyce Corcoran (D), Mayor of Lander first filed.

<text>Thomas Amory (c. 1691 – 25 November 1788) was a writer with an Irish background. He is thought to have lived in Dublin and later in Westminster.

==Polymath==
In 1755 Amory published &quot;Memoirs containing the lives of several ladies of Great Britain, a History of Antiquities and Observations on the Christian Religion&quot;. This was followed by the &quot;Life of John Buncle, Esq.&quot; in 1766, which was practically a continuation: Vol. I, 1756, Vol. II,

These works are those of a polymath, covering philology, natural science, theology and other subjects, unsystematically, but with occasional originality and felicity of diction.

==Private life==
Amory was a keen Unitarian. He was also a renowned eccentric, with a peculiar appearance and the manner of a gentleman. He scarcely ever stirred abroad except at dusk. He died at the age of 97, probably in London.

<text>Color Television Interface Adaptor (CTIA) and its successor Graphic Television Interface Adaptor (GTIA) are custom chips used in the Atari 8-bit computers and Atari 5200 home video game console. In these systems, a CTIA or GTIA chip works together with ANTIC to produce the video display. ANTIC generates the playfield graphics (text and bitmap) while CTIA/GTIA provides the color for the playfield and adds overlay objects known as player/missile graphics (sprites). Under the direction of Jay Miner, the CTIA/GTIA chips were designed by George McLeod with technical assistance of Steve Smith.

&quot;Color Television Interface Adaptor&quot; and &quot;Graphic Television Interface Adaptor&quot; are names of the chips as stated in the Atari field service manual. Various publications named the chips differently, sometimes using the alternative spelling &quot;Adapter&quot; or &quot;Graphics&quot;, or claiming that the &quot;C&quot; in &quot;CTIA&quot; stands for Colleen/Candy and &quot;G&quot; in &quot;GTIA&quot; is for George.

==History==

===2600 and TIA===
Atari had built their first display driver chip, the Television Interface Adaptor but universally referred to as the TIA, as part of the Atari 2600 console. The TIA display logically consisted of two primary sets of objects, the &quot;players&quot; and &quot;missiles&quot; that represented moving objects, and the &quot;playfield&quot; which represented the static background image on which the action took place. The chip used data in memory registers to produce digital signals that were converted in realtime via a digital-to-analog converter and RF modulator to produce a television display.

The conventional way to draw the playfield is to use a bitmap held in a frame buffer, in which each memory location in the frame buffer represents one or more locations on the screen. In the case of the 2600, which normally used a resolution of 160x192 pixels, a frame buffer would need to have at least 160x192/8 = 3840 bytes of memory. Built in an era where RAM was very expensive, the TIA could not afford this solution.

Instead, the system implemented a display system that used a single 20-bit memory register that could be copied or mirrored on the right half of the screen to make what was effectively a 40-bit display. Each location could be displayed in one of four colors, from a palette of 128 possible colors. The TIA also included several other display objects, the &quot;players&quot; and &quot;missiles&quot;. These consisted of two 8-bit wide objects known as &quot;players&quot;, a single 1-bit object known as the &quot;ball&quot;, and two 1-bit &quot;missiles&quot;. All of these objects could be moved to arbitrary horizontal locations via settings in other registers.

The key to the TIA system, and the 2600&#x27;s low price, was that the system implemented only enough memory to draw a single line of the display, all of which held in registers. To draw an entire screen full of data, the user code would wait until the television display reached the right side of the screen and update the registers for the playfield and player/missiles to correctly reflect the next line on the display. This scheme drew the screen line-by-line from program code on the ROM cartridge, a technique known as &quot;racing the beam&quot;.

===CTIA===
Atari initially estimated that the 2600 would have short market lifetime of three years when it was designed in 1976, which meant the company would need a new design by 1979. Initially this new design was simply an updated 2600-like game console, and was built around a similar basic design, simply updated. Work on what would become the CTIA started in 1977, and aimed at delivering a system with twice the resolution and twice the number of colours. Moreover, by varying the number of colours in the playfield, much higher resolutions up to 320 pixels horizontally could be supported. Players and missiles were also updated, including four 8-bit players and four 2-bit missiles, but also allowing an additional mode to combine the four missiles into a fifth player.

Shortly after design began, the home computer revolution started in earnest in the later half of 1977. In response, Atari decided to release two versions of the new machine, a low-end model as a games console, and a high-end version as a home computer. In either role, a more complex playfield would be needed, especially support for character graphics in the computer role. Design of the CTIA was well advanced at this point, so instead of a redesign a clever solution was provided by adding a second chip that would effectively automate the process of racing the beam. Instead of the user&#x27;s programming updating the CTIA&#x27;s registers based on its interrupt timing, the new ANTIC would handle this chore, reading data from a framebuffer and feeding that to the CTIA on the fly.

As a result of these changes, the new chips provide greatly improved number and selection of graphics modes over the TIA. Instead of a single playfield mode with 20 or 40 bits of resolution, the CTIA/ANTIC pair can display six text modes and eight graphics modes with various resolutions and color depths, allowing the programmer to choose a balance between resolution, colours, and memory use for their display.

===CTIA vs. GTIA===
The original design of the CTIA chip also included three additional color interpretations of the normal graphics modes. This feature provides alternate expressions of ANTIC&#x27;s high-resolution graphics modes presenting 1 bit per pixel, 2 colors with one-half color clock wide pixels as 4 bits per pixel, up to 16 colors, two-color clock wide pixels. This feature was ready before the computers&#x27; November 1979 debut, but was delayed so much in the development cycle that Atari had already ordered a batch of about 100,000 CTIA chips with the graphics modes missing. Not wanting to throw away the already-produced chips, the company decided to use them in the initial release of the Atari 400 and 800 models in the US market. The CTIA-equipped computers, lacking the 3 extra color modes, were shipped until October–November 1981. From this point, all new Atari units were equipped with the new chip, now called GTIA, that supported the new color interpretation modes.

The original Atari 800/400 operating system supported the GTIA alternate color interpretation modes from the start, which allowed for easy replacement of the CTIA with the GTIA once it was ready. Atari authorized service centers would install a GTIA chip in CTIA-equipped computers free of charge if the computer was under warranty; otherwise the replacement would cost $62.52.

GTIA was also mounted in all later Atari XL and XE computers and Atari 5200 consoles.

==Features==
The list below describes CTIA/GTIA&#x27;s inherent hardware capabilities meaning the intended functionality of the hardware itself, not including results achieved by CPU-serviced interrupts or display kernels driving frequent register changes.

CTIA/GTIA is a television interface device with the following features:
* Interprets the Playfield graphics data stream from ANTIC to apply color to the display.
* Merges four Player and four Missile overlay objects (aka sprites) with ANTIC&#x27;s Playfield graphics. Player/Missile features include:
** Player/Missile pixel positioning is independent of the Playfield: 
*** Player/Missile objects function normally in the vertical and horizontal overscan areas beyond the displayed Playfield.
*** Player/Missile objects function normally without an ANTIC Playfield.
** Eight-bit wide Player objects and two-bit wide Missile objects where each bit represents one displayed pixel.
** Variable pixel width (1, 2, or 4 color clocks wide)
** Each Player/Missile object is vertically the height of the entire screen.
** Variable pixel height when the data is supplied by ANTIC DMA (single or double scan lines per data)
** Ability to independently shift each P/M object by one scan line vertically when operating on double scan lines per data. 
** Each Player and its associated Missile has a dedicated color register separate from the Playfield colors.
** Multiple priority schemes for the order of graphics layers (P/M Graphics vs playfield)
** Color merging between Players and Playfield producing extra colors.
** Color merging between pairs of Players producing multi-color Players.
** Missiles can be grouped together into a Fifth Player that uses a separate color register.
** Collision detection between Players, Missiles, and Playfield graphics.
* There are no fixed colors for normal (CTIA) color interpretation mode. All colors are generated via indirection through nine color registers. (Four for Player/Missile graphics, four for the Playfield, and one shared between the Playfield and the Fifth Player feature.)
** Normal color interpretation mode provides choice of colors from a 128 color palette (16 colors with 8 luminance values for each)
** A GTIA color interpretation mode can generate 16 luminances per color providing a 256 color palette.
* The GTIA version of the chip adds three alternate color interpretation modes for the Playfield graphics.
** 16 shades of a single hue from the 16 possible hues in the Atari palette. This is accessible in Atari BASIC as Graphics 9.
** 15 hues in a single shade/luminance value plus background. This is accessible in Atari BASIC as Graphics 11.
** 9 colors in any hue and luminance from the palette accomplished using all the Player/Missile and Playfield color registers for the Playfield colors. This is accessible in Atari BASIC as Graphics 10.
* Reads the state of the joystick triggers (bottom buttons only for the Atari 5200 controllers).
* It includes four input/output pins that are used in different ways depending on the system:
** In Atari 8-bit computers, three of the pins are used to read state of the console keys (Start/Select/Option). 
** The fourth pin controls the speaker built into the Atari 400/800 to generate keyboard clicks. On later models there is no speaker, but the key click is still generated by GTIA and mixed with the regular audio output.
** In the Atari 5200, the pins are used as part of the process to read the controller keyboards.

==Pinout==

==Registers==
The Atari 8-bit computers map CTIA/GTIA to the $D0xxhex page and the Atari 5200 console maps it to the $C0xxhex page.

CTIA/GTIA provides 54 Read/Write registers controlling Player/Missile graphics, Playfield colors, joystick triggers, and console keys. Many CTIA/GTIA register addresses have dual purposes performing different functions as a Read vs a Write register. Therefore, no code should read Hardware registers expecting to retrieve the previously written value.

This problem is solved for many write registers by Operating System Shadow registers implemented in regular RAM as places to store the last value written to registers. Operating System Shadow registers are copied from RAM to the hardware registers during the vertical blank. Therefore, any write to hardware registers which have corresponding shadow registers will be overwritten by the value of the Shadow registers during the next vertical blank.

Some Write registers do not have corresponding Shadow registers. They can be safely written by an application without the value being overwritten during the vertical blank. If the application needs to know the last state of the register then it is the responsibility of the application to remember what it wrote.

Operating System Shadow registers also exist for some Read registers where reading the value directly from hardware at an unknown stage in the display cycle may return inconsistent results.

In the individual register listings below the following legend applies:
===Player/Missile Horizontal Coordinates===

These registers specify the horizontal position in color clocks of the left edge (the high bit of the GRAF* byte patterns) of Player/Missile objects. Coordinates are always based on the display hardware&#x27;s color clock engine, NOT simply the current Playfield display mode. This also means Player/Missile objects can be moved into overscan areas beyond the current Playfield mode.

Note that while Missile objects bit patterns share the same byte for displayed pixels (GRAFM) each Missile can be independently positioned. When the &quot;fifth Player&quot; option is enabled (See PRIOR/GPRIOR register) turning the four Missiles into one &quot;Player&quot; the Missiles switch from displaying the color of the associated Player object to displaying the value of COLPF3. The new &quot;Player&#x27;s&quot; position on screen must be set by specifying the position of each Missile individually.

Player/Missile pixels are only rendered within the visible portions of the GTIA&#x27;s pixel engine. Player/Missile objects are not rendered during the horizontal blank or the vertical blank. However, an object can be partially within the horizontal blank. The objects&#x27; pixels that fall outside of the horizontal blank are then within the visible portion of the display and can still register collisions. The horizontal position range of visible color clocks is $22hex/34dec to $DDhex/221dec.

To remove a Player/Missile object from the visible display area horizontal positions (left) 0 and (right) $DEhex/222dec (or greater) will insure no pixels are rendered regardless of the size of the Player/Missile object and so no unintentional collisions can be flagged.

====HPOSP0 $D000 Write====
Horizontal Position of Player 0

====HPOSP1 $D001 Write====
Horizontal Position of Player 1

====HPOSP2 $D002 Write====
Horizontal Position of Player 2

====HPOSP3 $D003 Write====
Horizontal Position of Player 3

====HPOSM0 $D004 Write====
Horizontal Position of Missile 0

====HPOSM1 $D005 Write====
Horizontal Position of Missile 1

====HPOSM2 $D006 Write====
Horizontal Position of Missile 2

====HPOSM3 $D007 Write====
Horizontal Position of Missile 3
 
Below are the color clock coordinates of the left and right edges of the possible Playfield sizes, useful when aligning Player/Missile objects to Playfield components:

===Player/Missile Size Control===

Three sizes can be chosen: Normal, Double, and Quad width. The left edge (See Horizontal Coordinates) is fixed and the size adjustment expands the Player or Missile toward the right in all cases.

*Normal - 1 bit (pixel) is 1 color clock wide
*Double - 1 bit (pixel) is 2 color clocks wide
*Quad - 1 bit (pixel) is 4 color clocks wide

Note that in Quad size a single Player/Missile pixel is the same width as an Antic Mode 2 text character. Player/Missile priority selection mixed with Quad width Player Missile graphics can be used to create multiple text colors per Mode line.

Each Player has its own size control register:

====SIZEP0 $D008 Write====
Size of Player 0

====SIZEP1 $D009 Write====
Size of Player 1

====SIZEP2 $D00A Write====
Size of Player 2

====SIZEP3 $D00B Write====
Size of Player 3

Player size controls:

Values:

====SIZEM $D00C Write====
All Missile sizes are controlled by one register, but each Missile can be sized independently of the others. When the &quot;fifth Player&quot; option is enabled (See PRIOR/GPRIOR register) turning the four Missiles into one &quot;Player&quot; the width is still set by specifying the size for each Missile individually.

Values:

===Player/Missile Graphics Patterns===
Each Player object has its own 8-bit pattern register. Missile objects share one register with 2 bits per each Missile. Once a value is set it will continue to be displayed on each scan line. With no other intervention by CPU or ANTIC DMA to update the values the result is vertical stripe patterns the height of the screen including overscan areas. This mode of operation does not incur a CPU or DMA toll on the computer. It is useful for displaying alternate colored borders and vertical lines separating screen regions.

====GRAFP0 $D00D Write====
Graphics pattern for Player 0

====GRAFP1 $D00E Write====
Graphics pattern for Player 1

====GRAFP2 $D00F Write====
Graphics pattern for Player 2

====GRAFP3 $D010 Write====
Graphics pattern for Player 3

Each Player is 8 bits (pixels) wide. Where a bit is set, a pixel is displayed in the color assigned to the color register associated to the Player. Where a bit is not set the Player object is transparent, showing Players, Missiles, Playfield pixels, or the background color. Pixel output begins at the horizontal position specified by the Player&#x27;s HPOS value with the highest bit output first.

====GRAFM $D011 Write====
Graphics pattern for all Missiles

Each Missile is 2 bits (pixels) wide. Where a bit is set, a pixel is displayed in the color assigned to the color register for the Player associated to the Missile. When Fifth Player is enabled (see PRIOR/GPRIOR) the Missiles pixels all display COLPF3. Where a bit is not set the Missile object is transparent, showing Players, Missiles, Playfield pixels, or the background color. Pixel output begins at the horizontal position specified by the Missile&#x27;s HPOS value with the highest bit output first.

Missile Values:

===Player/Missile Collisions===

CTIA/GTIA has 60 bits providing automatic detection of collisions when Player, Missile, and Playfield pixels intersect. A single bit indicates a non-zero pixel of the Player/Missile object has intersected a pixel of a specific color register. There is no collision registered for pixels rendered using the background color register/value. This system provides instant, pixel-perfect overlap comparison without expensive CPU evaluation of bounding box or image bitmap masking.

The actual color value of an object is not considered. If Player, Missile, Playfield, and Background color registers are all the same value making the objects effectively &quot;invisible&quot;, the intersections of objects will still register collisions. This is useful for making hidden or secret objects and walls.

Obscured intersections will also register collisions. If a Player object priority is behind a Playfield color register and another Player object priority is higher (foreground) than the Playfield, and the foreground Player pixels obscure both the Playfield and the Player object behind the Playfield, then the collision between the Playfield and both the background and foreground Player objects will register along with the collision between the foreground and background Player objects.

Note that there is no Missile to Missile collision.

Player/Missile collisions can only occur when Player/Missile object pixels occur within the visible portions of the display. Player/Missile objects are not rendered during the horizontal blank or the vertical blank. The range of visible color clocks is 34 to 221, and the visible scan lines range from line 8 through line 247. Player/Missile data outside of these coordinates are not rendered and will not register collisions. An object can be partially within the horizontal blank. The objects&#x27; pixels that fall outside of the horizontal blank are within the visible portion of the display and can still register collisions.

To remove a Player/Missile object from the visible display area horizontal positions (left) 0 and (right) 222 (or greater) will insure no pixels are rendered regardless of the size of the Player/Missile object and so no unintentional collisions can be flagged.

Finally, Player, Missile, and Playfield objects collision detection is real-time, registering a collision as the image pixels are merged and output for display. Checking an object&#x27;s collision bits before the object has been rendered by CTIA/GTIA will show no collision.

Once set, collisions remain in effect until cleared by writing to the HITCLR register. Effective collision response routines should occur after the targeted objects have been displayed, or at the end of a frame or during the vertical blank to react to the collisions and clear collisions before the next frame begins.

Because collisions are only a single bit, collisions are quite obviously not additive. No matter how many times and different locations a collision between pixels occurs within one frame there is only 1 bit to indicate there was a collision. A set collision bit informs a program that it can examine the related objects to identify collision locations and then decide how to react for each location.

Since HITCLR and collision detection is real-time, Display List Interrupts can divide the display into sections with HITCLR used at the beginning of each section and separate collision evaluation at the end of each section.

When the &quot;fifth Player&quot; option is enabled (See PRIOR/GPRIOR register) the only change is the Missiles 0 to 3 switch from displaying the color of the associated Player object to displaying the value of COLPF3. The new &quot;Player&#x27;s&quot; collisions are still reported for the individual Missiles.

====Player/Missile to Playfield Collisions====

Each bit indicates a pixel of the Player/Missile object has intersected a pixel of the specified Playfield color object. There is no collision registered for the background color.

Obscured intersections will also register collisions. If a Player/Missile object priority is behind a Playfield color register and another Player/Missile object priority is higher (foreground) than the Playfield, and the foreground Player/Missile pixels obscure both the Playfield and the Player/Missile object behind the Playfield, then the collision between the Playfield and both the background and foreground Player/Missile objects will register.

High-resolution, 1/2 color clock pixel modes (ANTIC Modes 2, 3, and F) are treated differently. The &quot;background&quot; color rendered as COLPF2 where pixel values are 0 does not register a collision. High-resolution pixels are rendered as the luminance value from COLPF1. The pixels are grouped together in color clock-wide pairs (pixels 0 and 1, pixels 2 and 3, continuing to pixels 318 and 319). Where either pixel of the pair is 1 a collision is detected between the Player or Missile pixels and Playfield color COLPF2.

GTIA modes 9 and 11 do not process playfield collisions. In GTIA mode 10 Playfield collisions will register where Playfield pixels use COLPF0 through COLPF3

===Player/Missile and Playfield Color and Luminance===
All Player/Missile objects&#x27; pixels and all Playfield pixels in the default CTIA/GTIA color interpretation mode use indirection to specify color. Indirection means that the values of the pixel data do not directly specify the color, but point to another source of information for color. CTIA/GTIA contain hardware registers that set the values used for colors, and the pixels&#x27; information refer to these registers. The palette on the Atari is 8 luminance levels of 16 colors for a total 128 colors. The color indirection flexibility allows a program to tailor the screen&#x27;s colors to fit the purpose of the program&#x27;s display.

All hardware color registers have corresponding shadow registers.

====COLPM0 $D012 Write====
SHADOW: PCOLOR0 $02C0

Color/luminance of Player and Missile 0.

When GTIA 9-color mode is enabled (PRIOR/GPRIOR value $80) this register is used for the border and background (Playfield pixel value 0), rather than COLBK.

====COLPM1 $D013 Write====
SHADOW: PCOLOR1 $02C1

Color/luminance of Player and Missile 1.

====COLPM2 $D014 Write====
SHADOW: PCOLOR2 $02C2

Color/luminance of Player and Missile 2.

====COLPM3 $D015 Write====
SHADOW: PCOLOR3 $02C3

Color/luminance of Player and Missile 3.

====COLPF0 $D016 Write====
SHADOW: COLOR0 $02C4

Color/luminance of Playfield 0.

====COLPF1 $D017 Write====
SHADOW: COLOR1 $02C5

Color/luminance of Playfield 1.

This register is used for the set pixels (value 1) in ANTIC text modes 2 and 3, and map mode F. Only the luminance portion is used and is OR&#x27;d with the color value of COLPF2. In other Character and Map modes this register provides the expected color and luminance for a pixel.

====COLPF2 $D018 Write====
SHADOW: COLOR2 $02C6

Color/luminance of Playfield 2.

This register is used for Playfield background color of ANTIC text modes 2 and 3, and map mode F. That is, where pixel value 0 is used. In other Character and Map modes this register provides the expected color and luminance for a pixel.

====COLPF3 $D019 Write====
SHADOW: COLOR3 $02C7

Color/luminance of Playfield 3

COLPF3 is available is several special circumstances: 
* When Missiles are converted to the &quot;fifth Player&quot; they switch from displaying the color of the associated Player object to displaying COLPF3 and change priority. See PRIOR/GPRIOR register.
* Playfield Text Modes 4 and 5. Inverse video characters (high bit $80 set) cause CTIA/GTIA to substitute COLPF3 value for COLPF2 pixels in the character matrix. (See ANTIC&#x27;s Glyph Rendering)
* Playfield Text Modes 6 and 7. When the character value has bits 6 and 7 set (character range $C0-FF) the entire character pixel matrix is displayed in COLPF3. (See ANTIC&#x27;s Glyph Rendering)
* This register is also available in GTIA&#x27;s special 9 color, pixel indirection color mode.

====COLBK $D01A Write====
SHADOW: COLOR4 $02C8

Color/luminance of Playfield background.

The background color is displayed where no other pixel occurs through the entire overscan display area. The following exceptions occur for the background:
* In ANTIC text modes 2 and 3, and map mode F the background of the playfield area where pixels may be rendered is from COLPF2 and the COLBK color appears as a border around the playfield.
* In GTIA color interpretation mode $8 (9 color indirection) the display background color is provided by color register COLPM0 while COLBAK is used for Playfield pixel value $8.
* In GTIA color interpretation mode $C (15 colors in one luminance level, plus background) uses COLBK to set the luminance level of all other pixels (pixel value $1 through $F). However, the background itself uses only the color component set in the COLBK register. The luminance value of the background is forced to 0.

Color Registers&#x27; Bits:

The high nybble of the color register specifies one of 16 colors color ($00, $10, $20... to $F0). 
The low nybble of the register specifies one of 16 luminance values ($00, $01, $02... to $0F).

In the normal color interpretation mode the lowest bit is not significant and only 8 luminance values are available ($00, $02, $04, $06, $08, $0A, $0C, $0E), so the complete color palette is 128 color values.

In GTIA color interpretation mode $4 (luminance-only mode) the full 16 bits of luminance values are available for Playfield pixels providing a palette of 256 colors. Any Player/Missile objects displayed in this mode are colored by indirection which still uses the 128 color palette.

In normal color interpretation mode the pixel values range from $0 to $3 ordinarily pointing to color registers COLBK, COLPF0, COLPF1, COLPF2 respectively. The color text modes also include options to use COLPF3 for certain ranges of character values. See ANTIC&#x27;s graphics modes for more information.

When Player/Missile graphics patterns are enabled for display where the graphics patterns bits are set the color displayed comes from the registers assigned to the objects.

There are exceptions for color generation and display: 
* ANTIC Text modes 2 and 3, and Map mode F:
** The pixel values in these modes is only $0 and $1. The $0 pixels specify the Playfield background which is color register COLPF2. The $1 pixels use the color component of COLPF2, and the luminance specified by COLPF1. The border around the Playfield uses the color from COLBK.
** ANTIC Text modes 2 and 3, and Map mode F behave differently with Player/Missile graphics from the other modes. COLPF1 used for the glyph or graphics pixels always has the highest priority and cannot be obscured by Players or Missiles. The color of COLPF1 always comes from the &quot;background&quot; which is ordinarily COLPF2. Therefore, where Players/Missiles and Fifth Player have priority over COLPF2 the COLPF1 glyph/graphics pixels use the color component of the highest priority color (Player or Missile), and the luminance component of COLPF1. This behavior is consistent where Player/Missile priority conflicts result in true black for the &quot;background&quot;. In summary, the color CTIA/GTIA finally determines to use &quot;behind&quot; the high-res pixel is then used to &quot;tint&quot; the COLPF1 foreground glyph/graphics pixels.
* GTIA Exceptions
** GTIA color interpretation mode $8 (9 color indirection) uses color register COLPM0 for the display background and border color while COLBAK is used for Playfield pixel value $8.
** GTIA color interpretation mode $C (15 colors in one luminance level, plus background) uses COLBK to set the luminance level of all other pixels (pixel value $1 through $F). However, the background itself uses only the color component set in the COLBK register. The luminance value of the background is forced to 0. Note that the background&#x27;s color component is also OR&#x27;d with the other pixels&#x27; colors. Therefore, the overall number of colors in the mode is reduced when the background color component is not black (numerically zero).
* Player/Missile Exceptions:
** Player/Missile Priority value $0 (See PRIOR/GPRIOR) will cause overlapping Player and Playfield pixels to be OR&#x27;d together displaying a different color.
** Conflicting Player/Missile Priority configuration will cause true black (color 0, luma 0) to be output where conflicts occur. 
** The Player/Missile Multi-Color option will cause overlapping Player pixels to be OR&#x27;d together displaying a different color.

===Miscellaneous Player/Missile and GTIA Controls===

====PRIOR $D01B Write====
SHADOW: GPRIOR $026F

This register controls several CTIA/GTIA color management features: The GTIA Playfield color interpretation mode, Multi-Color Player objects, the Fifth Player, and Player/Missile/Playfield priority.

===== GTIA Playfield Color Interpretations =====
CTIA includes only one default color interpretation mode for the ANTIC Playfield data stream. That is the basic functionality assumed in the majority of the ANTIC and CTIA/GTIA discussion unless otherwise noted. GTIA includes three alternate color interpretations modes for Playfield data. These modes work by pairing adjacent color clocks from ANTIC, thus the pixels output by GTIA are always two color clocks wide. Although these modes can be engaged while displaying any ANTIC Playfield Mode, the full color palette possible with these GTIA color processing options are only realized in the ANTIC Modes based on color clock pixels (ANTIC modes 2, 3, F.) These GTIA options are most often used with a Mode F display. The special GTIA color processing modes also alter the display or behavior of Player/Missile graphics in various ways.

The color interpretation control is a global function of GTIA affecting the entire screen. GTIA is not inherently capable of mixing on one display the various GTIA color interpretation modes and the default CTIA mode needed for most ANTIC Playfields. Mixing color interpretation modes requires software writing to the PRIOR register as the display is generated (usually, by a Display List Interrupt).

PRIOR bits 7 and 6 provide four values specifying the color interpretation modes:

===== 16 Shades =====
This mode uses the COLBK register to specify the background color. Rather than using indirection, pixel values directly represent Luminance. This mode allows all four luminance bits to be used in the Atari color palette and so is capable of displaying 256 colors.

Player/Missile graphics (without the fifth Player option) display properly in this mode, however collision detection with the Playfield is disabled. Playfield priority is always on the bottom. When the Missiles are switched to act as a fifth Player then where the Missile objects overlap the Playfield the Missile pixels luminance merges with the Playfield pixels&#x27; Luminance value.

===== 9 Color =====
Unlike the other two special GTIA modes, this mode is entirely driven by color indirection. All nine color registers work on the display for pixel values 0 through 8. The remaining 7 pixel values repeat previous color registers.

The pixels are delayed by one color clock (half a GTIA mode pixel) when output. This offset permits interesting effects. For an example, page flipping rapidly between this mode and a different GTIA mode produces a display with apparent higher resolution and greater number of colors.

This mode is unique in that is uses color register COLPM0 for the border and background (Playfield 0 value pixels) rather than COLBK.

Player/Missile graphics display properly with the exception that Player/Missile 0 are not distinguishable from the background pixels, since they use the same color register, COLPM0. The Playfield pixels using the Player/Missile colors are modified by priority settings as if they were Player/Missile objects and so can affect the display of Players/Missiles. (See discussion later about Player/Missile/Playfield priorities).

The Playfield pixels using Player/Missile colors do not trigger collisions when Player/Missile objects overlay them. However, Player/Missile graphics overlapping Playfield colors COLPF0 to COLPF3 will trigger the expected collision.

===== 16 Colors =====
This mode uses the COLBK register to specify the luminance of all Playfield pixels (values 1hex/1dec through Fhex/15dec.) The least significant bit of the luminance value is not observed, so only the standard/CTIA 8 luminance values are available (, , , , , , , ). Additionally, the background itself uses only the color component set in the COLBK register. The luminance value of the background is forced to 0. As with the Luminance mode indirection is disabled and pixel values directly represent a color.

Note that the color component of the background also merges with the playfield pixels. Colors other than black for the background reduce the overall number of colors displayed in the mode.
Player/Missile graphics (without the fifth Player option) display properly in this mode, however collision detection with the Playfield is disabled. Playfield priority is always on the bottom. When the Missiles are switched to act as a fifth Player then where the Missile objects overlap the Playfield the Missile pixels inherit the Playfield pixels&#x27; Color value.

===== Multi-Color Player =====
PRIOR bit 5, value 20hex/32dec enables Multi-Color Player objects. Where pixels of two Player/Missile objects overlap a third color appears. This is implemented by eliminating priority processing between pairs of Player/Missile objects resulting in CTIA/GTIA performing a bitwise OR of the two colored pixels to output a new color.

Example: A Player pixel with color value 98hex/152dec (blue) overlaps a Player pixel with color value 46hex/70dec (red) resulting in a pixel color of DEhex/228dec (light green/yellow).

The Players/Missiles pairs capable of Multi-Color output: 
*Player 0 + Player 1
*Missile 0 + Missile 1
*Player 2 + Player 3
*Missile 2 + Missile 3

===== Fifth Player =====
PRIOR bit 4, value $10hex/16dec enables Missiles to become a fifth Player. No functional change occurs to the Missile other than the color processing of the Missiles. Normally the Missiles display using the color of the associated Player. When Fifth Player is enabled all Missiles display the color of Playfield 3 (COLPF3). Horizontal position, size, vertical delay, and Player/Missile collisions all continue to operate the same way. The priority of the Fifth Player for Player objects pixel intersections is COLPF3, but the Fifth Player&#x27;s pixels have priority over all Playfield colors.

The color processing change also causes some exceptions for the Missiles&#x27; display in GTIA&#x27;s alternative color modes:
*GTIA 16 Shades mode: Where Missile pixels overlap the Playfield the pixels inherit the Playfield pixels&#x27; Luminance value.
*GTIA 16 Colors mode: Where Missile pixels overlap the Playfield the pixels inherit the Playfield pixels&#x27; Color value.

The Fifth Player introduces an exception for Priority value $8 (bits 1000) (See Priority discussion below.)

===== Priority =====
PRIOR bits 3 to 0 provide four Player/Missile and Playfield priority values that determine which pixel value is displayed when Player/Missile objects pixels and Playfield pixels intersect. The four values provide specific options listed in the Priority chart below. &quot;PM&quot; mean normal Player/Missile implementation without the Fifth Player. The Fifth Player, &quot;P5&quot;, is shown where its priority occurs when it is enabled.

The chart is accurate for ANTIC Playfield Character and Map modes using the default (CTIA) color interpretation mode. GTIA color interpretation modes, and the ANTIC modes based on high-resolution, color clock pixels behave differently (noted later).

If multiple bits are set, then where there is a conflict CTIA/GTIA outputs a black pixel—Note that black means actual black, not simply the background color, COLBK.

Although the Fifth Player is displayed with the value of COLPF3, its priority is above all Playfield colors. This produces an exception for Priority value $8 (Bits 1000). In this mode Playfield 0 and 1 are higher priority than the Players, and the Players are higher priority than Playfield 2 and 3. Where Playfield 0 or 1 pixels intersect any Player pixel the result displayed is the Playfield pixel. However, if the Fifth player also intersects the same location, its value is shown over the Playfield causing it to appear as if Playfield 3 has the highest priority. If the Playfield 0 or 1 pixel is removed from this intersection then the Fifth Player&#x27;s pixel has no Playfield pixel to override and so also falls behind the Player pixels.

When the Priority bits are all 0 a different effect occurs—Player and Playfield pixels are logically OR&#x27;d together in the a manner similar to the Multi-Color Player feature. In this situation Players 0 and 1 pixels can mix with Playfield 0 and 1 pixels, and Players 2 and 3 pixels can mix with Playfield 2 and 3 pixels. Additionally, when the Multi-Color Player option is used the resulting merged Players&#x27; color can also mix with the Playfield producing more colors. When all color merging possibilities are considered, the CTIA/GTIA hardware can output 23 colors per scan line. Starting with the background color as the first color, the remaining 22 colors and color merges are possible:

When Priority bits are all 0 the Missiles colors function the same way as the corresponding Players as described above. When Fifth Player is enabled, the Missile pixels cause the same color merging as shown for COLPF3 in the table above (colors 19 through 22).

===== Priority And High-Resolution Modes =====
The priority result differ for the Character and Map modes using high-resolution, color clock pixels—ANTIC modes 2, 3, and F. These priority handling differences can be exploited to produce color text or graphics in these modes that are traditionally thought of as &quot;monochrome&quot;.

In these ANTIC modes COLPF2 is output as the &quot;background&quot; of the Playfield and COLBK is output as the border around the Playfield. The graphics or glyph pixels are output using only the luminance component of COLPF1 mixed with the color component of the background (usually COLPF2).

The priority relationship between Players/Missiles, and COLPF2 work according to the priority chart below. Player/Missile pixels with higher priorities will replace COLPF2 as the &quot;background&quot; color. COLPF1 always has the highest priority and cannot be obscured by Players or Missiles. The glyph/graphics pixels use the color component of highest priority color (Playfield, Player, or Missile), and the luminance component of COLPF1. Note that this behavior is also consistent where Player/Missile priority conflicts result in true black for the &quot;background&quot;. In effect, the color value CTIA/GTIA finally uses for the &quot;background&quot; color &quot;tints&quot; the COLPF1 foreground glyph/graphics pixels.

====VDELAY $D01C Write====
Vertical Delay P/M Graphics

This register is used to provide single scan line movement when Double Line Player/Missile resolution is enabled in ANTIC&#x27;s DMACTL register. This works by masking ANTIC DMA updates to the GRAF* registers on even scan lines, causing the graphics pattern to shift down one scan line.

Since Single Line resolution requires ANTIC DMA updates on each scan line and VDELAY masks the updates on even scan lines, then this bit reduces Single line Player/Missile resolution to Double line.

====GRACTL $D01D Write====
Graphics Control


GRACTL controls CTIA/GTIA&#x27;s receipt of Player/Missile DMA data from ANTIC and toggles the mode of Joystick trigger input.

Receipt of Player/Missile DMA data requires CTIA/GTIA be configured to receive the data. This is done with a pair of bits in GRACTL that match a pair of bits in ANTIC&#x27;s DMACTL register that direct ANTIC to send Player data and Missile data. GRACTL&#x27;s Bit 0 corresponds to DMACTL&#x27;s Bit 2, enabling transfer of Missile data. GRACTL&#x27;s Bit 1 corresponds to DMACTL&#x27;s Bit 3, enabling transfer of Player data. These bits must be set for GTIA to receive Player/Missile data from ANTIC via DMA. When Player/Missile graphics are being operated directly by the CPU then these bits must be off.

The joystick trigger registers report the pressed/not pressed state in real-time. If a program&#x27;s input polling may not be frequent enough to catch momentary joystick button presses, then the triggers can be set to lock in the closed/pressed state and remain in that state even after the button is released. Setting GRACTL Bit 2 enables the latching of all triggers. Clearing the bit returns the triggers to the unlatched, real-time behavior.

====HITCLR $D01E Write====
Clear Collisions

Any write to this register clears all the Player/Missile collision detection bits.

===Other CTIA/GTIA Functions===

====Joystick Triggers====

=====TRIG0 $D010 Read=====
SHADOW: STRIG0 $0284

Joystick 0 trigger

=====TRIG1 $D011 Read=====
SHADOW: STRIG1 $0285

Joystick 1 trigger.

=====TRIG2 $D012 Read=====
SHADOW: STRIG2 $0286

Joystick 2 trigger.

=====TRIG3 $D013 Read=====
SHADOW: STRIG3 $0287

Joystick 3 trigger

Bits 7 through 1 are always 0. Bit 0 reports the state of the joystick trigger. Value 1 indicates the trigger is not pressed. Value 0 indicates the trigger is pressed.

The trigger registers report button presses in real-time. The button pressed state will instantly clear when the button is released.

The triggers may be configured to latch, that is, lock, in the pressed state and remain that way until specifically cleared. GRACTL bit 2 enables the latch behavior for all triggers. Clearing GRACTL bit 2 returns all triggers to real-time behavior.

====PAL $D014 Read====
PAL flags.

This register reports the display standard for the system. When Bits 3 to 0 are set to 1 (value $fhex/15dec) the system is operating in NTSC. When the bits are zero the system is operating in PAL mode.

====CONSPK $D01F Write====
Console Speaker

Bit3 controls the internal speaker of the Atari 800/400. In later models the console speaker is removed and the sound is mixed with the regular POKEY audio signals for output to the monitor port and RF adapter. The Atari OS uses the console speaker to output the keyboard click and the bell/buzzer sound.

The Operating System sets the speaker bit during the vertical blank routine. Repeatedly writing 0 to the bit will produce a 60 Hz buzzing sound as the vertical blank resets the value. Useful tones can be generated using 6502 code effectively adding a fifth audio channel, albeit a channel requiring CPU time to maintain the audio tones.

====CONSOL $D01F Read====
Console Keys

A bit is assigned to report the state of each of the special console keys, Start, Select, and Option. Bit value 0 indicates a key is pressed and 1 indicates the key is not pressed. Key/Bit values:

* Start Key = Bit value $1
* Select Key = Bit value $2
* Option Key = Bit value $4

==Player/Missile Graphics (sprites) operation==
A hardware &quot;sprite&quot; system is handled by CTIA/GTIA. The official ATARI name for the sprite system is &quot;Player/Missile Graphics&quot;, since it was designed to reduce the need to manipulate display memory for fast-moving objects, such as the &quot;player&quot; and his weapons, &quot;missiles&quot;, in a shoot &#x27;em up game.

A Player is essentially a glyph 8 pixels wide and 256 TV lines tall, and has two colors: the background (transparent) (codice_1 in the glyph) and the foreground (codice_2). A Missile object is similar, but only 2 pixels wide. CTIA/GTIA combines the Player/Missile objects&#x27; pixels with the Playfield pixels according to their priority. Transparent (codice_1) player pixels have no effect on the Playfield and display either a Playfield or background pixel without change. All Player/Missile objects&#x27; normal pixel width is one color clock. A register value can set the Player or Missile pixels&#x27; width to 1, 2, or 4 color clocks wide.

The Player/Missile implementation by CTIA/GTIA is similar to the TIA&#x27;s. A Player is an 8-bit value or pattern at a specified horizontal position which automatically repeats for each scan line or until the pattern is changed in the register. Missiles are 2-bits wide and share one pattern register, so that four, 2-bit wide values occupy the 8-bit wide pattern register, but each missile has an independent horizontal position and size. Player/Missile objects extend the height of the display including the screen border. That is, the default implementation of Player/Missile graphics by CTIA/GTIA is a stripe down the screen. While seemingly limited this method facilitates Player/Missile graphics use as alternate colored vertical borders or separators on a display, and when priority values are set to put Player/Missile pixels behind playfield pixels they can be used to add additional colors to a display. All Players and Missiles set at maximum width and placed side by side can cover the entire normal width Playfield.

CTIA/GTIA supports several options controlling Player/Missile color. The PRIOR/GPRIOR register value can switch the four Missiles between two color display options—each Missile (0 to 3) expresses the color of the associated Player object (0 to 3) or all Missiles show the color of register COLPF3/COLOR3. When Missiles are similarly colored they can be treated as a fifth player, but correct placement on screen still requires storing values in all four Missile Horizontal Position registers. PRIOR/GPRIOR also controls a feature that causes the overlapping pixels of two Players to generate a third color allowing multi-colored Player objects at the expense of reducing the number of available objects. Finally, PRIOR/GPRIOR can be used to change the foreground/background layering (called, &quot;priority&quot;) of Player/Missile pixels vs Playfield pixels, and can create priority conflicts that predictably affect the colors displayed.

The conventional idea of a sprite with an image/pattern that varies vertically is also built into the Player/Missile graphics system. The ANTIC chip includes a feature to perform DMA to automatically feed new pixel patterns to CTIA/GTIA as the display is generated. This can be done for each scan line or every other scan line resulting in Player/Missile pixels one or two scan lines tall. In this way the Player/Missile object could be considered an extremely tall character in a font, 8 bits/pixels wide, by the height of the display.

Moving the Player/Missile objects horizontally is as simple as changing a register in the CTIA/GTIA (in Atari BASIC, a single POKE statement moves a player or missile horizontally). Moving an object vertically is achieved by either block moving the definition of the glyph to a new location in the Player or Missile bitmap, or by rotating the entire Player/Missile bitmap (128 or 256 bytes). The worst case rotation of the entire bitmap is still quite fast in 6502 machine language, even though the 6502 lacks a block-move instruction found in the 8080. Since the sprite is exactly 128 or 256 bytes long, the indexing can be easily accommodated in a byte-wide register on the 6502. Atari BASIC lacks a high speed memory movement command and moving memory using BASIC PEEK()s and POKE(s) is painfully slow. Atari BASIC programs using Player/Missile graphics have other options for performing high speed memory moves. One method is calling a short machine language routine via the USR() function to perform the memory moves. Another option is utilizing a large string as the Player/Missile memory map and performing string copy commands which result in memory movement at machine language speed.

Careful use of Player/Missile graphics with the other graphics features of the Atari hardware can make graphics programming, particularly games, significantly simpler.

==GTIA enhancements==
The GTIA chip is backward compatible with the CTIA, and adds 3 color interpretations for the 14 &quot;normal&quot; ANTIC Playfield graphics modes. The normal color interpretation of the CTIA chip is limited, per scanline, to a maximum of 4 colors in Map modes or 5 colors in Text modes (plus 4 colors for Player/Missile graphics) unless special programming techniques are used. The three, new color interpretations in GTIA provide a theoretical total of 56 graphics modes (14 ANTIC modes multiplied by four possible color interpretations). However, only the graphics modes based on high-resolution, color clock pixels (that is, Antic text modes 2, 3, and graphics mode F) are capable of fully expressing the color palettes of these 3 new color interpretations. The three additional color interpretations use the information in two color clocks (four bits) to generate a pixel in one of 16 color values. This changes a mode F display from 2 colors per pixel, 320 pixels horizontally, one scan line per mode line, to 16 colors and 80 pixels horizontally. The additional color interpretations allow the following:
* GTIA color interpretation mode 16 shades of a single hue (set by the background color, COLBK) from the 16 possible hues in the Atari palette. This is also accessible in Atari BASIC as Graphics 9.
* GTIA color interpretation mode This mode allows 9 colors of indirection per horizontal line in any hue and luminance from the entire Atari palette of 128 colors. This is accomplished using all the Player/Missile and Playfield color registers for the Playfield pixels. In this mode the background color is provided by color register COLPM0 while COLBAK is used for Playfield pixel value $8. This mode is accessible in Atari BASIC as Graphics 10,
* GTIA color interpretation mode 15 hues in a single shade/luminance value, plus the background. The value of the background, COLBK sets the luminance level of all other pixels (pixel value through ). The least significant bit of the luminance value is not observed, so only the standard/CTIA 8 luminance values are available (, , , , , , , ). Additionally, the background itself uses only the color component set in the COLBK register. The luminance value of the background is forced to 0. This mode is accessible in Atari BASIC as Graphics 11.

Of these modes, Atari BASIC Graphics 9 is particularly notable. It enables the Atari to display gray-scale digitized photographs, which despite their low resolution were very impressive at the time. Additionally, by allowing 16 shades of a single hue rather than the 8 shades available in other graphics modes, it increases the amount of different colors the Atari could display from 128 to 256. Unfortunately, this feature is limited for use in this mode only, which due to its low resolution was not widely used.

The Antic 2 and 3 text modes are capable of displaying the same color ranges as mode F graphics when using the GTIA&#x27;s alternate color interpretations. However, since the pixel reduction also applies and turns 8 pixel wide, 2 color text into 2 pixel wide, 16 color blocks these modes are unsuitable for actual text, and so these graphics modes are not popular outside of demos. Effective use of the GTIA color interpretation feature with text modes requires a carefully constructed character set treating characters as pixels. This method allows display of an apparent GTIA &quot;high resolution&quot; graphics mode that would ordinarily occupy 8K of RAM to instead use only about 2K (1K for the character set, and 1K for the screen RAM and display list.)

The GTIA also fixed an error in CTIA that caused graphics to be misaligned by &quot;half a color clock&quot;. The side effect of the fix was that programs that relied on color artifacts in high-resolution monochrome modes would show a different pair of colors.

Atari owners can determine if their machine is equipped with the CTIA or GTIA by executing the BASIC command codice_4. If the screen blackens after execution, the machine is equipped with the new GTIA chip. If it stays blue, the machine has a CTIA chip instead.

== Bugs ==
The last Atari XE computers made for the Eastern European market were built in China. Many if not all have a buggy PAL GTIA chip. The luma values in Graphics 9 and higher are at fault, appearing as stripes. Replacing the chip fixes the problem. Also, there have been attempts to fix faulty GTIA chips with some external circuitry.

<text>John Asgill (25 March 1659 – 10 November 1738) was an eccentric English writer and politician.

==Life==
Asgill attended Nonconformist (Protestantism) services in his youth. He studied law at the Middle Temple, 1686, and was called to the bar in 1692. He founded the first land bank in 1695 with Nicholas Barbon, which, after proving to be a profitable venture, merged with the land bank of John Briscoe in 1696. However, after profits dropped, the bank closed in 1699. He was then elected that year as Member of Parliament for Bramber.

In 1700 Asgill had published &quot;An Argument Proving, that … Man may be Translated&quot;, a pamphlet aiming to prove that death was not obligatory upon Christians, which, much to his surprise, caused a public outcry and led to his expulsion from the Irish House of Commons in 1703, only a short time after he had stood successfully for Enniscorthy. He had moved to Ireland where the act for returning the forfeited estates which had been given away by William was providing work for lawyers.

Whilst in Ireland he had been re-elected to the English House of Commons for Bramber in 1702 and so returned to England. On 12 June 1707 he was arrested and imprisoned at Fleet Prison for debt; he claimed parliamentary immunity as a member of a current parliament despite the confusion whether the last English parliament and the first Parliament of Great Britain were the same body, and in December the House of Commons agreed. Nevertheless, two days after ordering his release from prison, he was expelled from the Commons for authoring a blasphemous book. 

He fell on hard times, and passed the rest of his life between the Fleet prison and the King&#x27;s Bench, but his zeal as a pamphleteer continued unabated.

<text>Edwin Atherstone (1788–1872) was a poet and novelist. His works, which were planned on an imposing scale, attracted some temporary attention and applause, but are now forgotten. His chief poem, &quot;The Fall of Nineveh&quot;, consisting of thirty books, appeared at intervals from 1828 to 1868. It narrates about war waged by the coalition of many nations led by Median prince Arbaces and Babylonian priest Belesis against the tyrannical king of Assyria Sardanapalus, who, after being defeated in many battles, burns his own palace and dies within. He wrote also &quot;The Last Days of Herculaneum; and, Abradates and Panthea: Poems&quot; (1821), &quot;A Midsummer Day&#x27;s Dream: a Poem&quot; (1824) and &quot;Israel in Egypt: a Poem&quot; (1861). He was a close friend and associate of the painter John Martin, whose well-known painting &quot;The Fall of Nineveh&quot; was produced in conjunction with Atherstone&#x27;s poem.

He also produced two novels, &quot;The Sea Kings in England&quot; and &quot;The Handwriting on the Wall&quot;. The first one tells about the Viking invasion of England at the time of king Alfred the Great. Atherstone&#x27;s plays were published posthumously by his daughter, Mary Elizabeth Atherstone in 1888.

<text>The Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation are the federally recognized confederations of three Sahaptin-speaking Native American tribes who traditionally inhabited the Columbia River Plateau region: the Cayuse, Umatilla, and Walla Walla.

When the leaders of the Walla Walla, Cayuse, and Umatilla peoples signed the Treaty of Walla Walla with the United States in 1855, they ceded of their homeland that is now northeastern Oregon and southeastern Washington. This was done in exchange for a reservation of and the promise of annuities in the form of goods and supplies.

The tribes share the Reservation, which consists of in Umatilla County, in northeast Oregon state. The tribes have created a joint political structure as part of their confederation. The tribal offices are just east of Pendleton, Oregon. Almost half of the reservation land is owned by non-Native Americans; the reservation includes significant portions of the Umatilla River watershed. In 2013 the three-tribe confederation populated about 2,916 people, roughly half of the tribal population live on or near the reservation.

The reservation is also home to about 300 Native Americans enrolled with other Tribes, such as the Yakama, Tenino (Warm Springs), and Nez Percé. 1,500 people who are not Native American also reside within the reservation boundaries.

==History==
After ceding their territories, the Umatilla, Walla Walla, and Cayuse relocated to what was called the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla American Indian Reservation (CTUIR). In exchange for ceding most of their territories they received supplies and annuities from the federal government, who then tried to encourage them to take up subsistence farming. Many times the supplies were late in coming or were inadequate for the population.

In 1887, under the Allotment Act, communal land was distributed to households. This and other legislation made it possible for the members to sell their lands but they were preyed on by speculators and swindlers. Gradually the tribe took back communal control of its land and has regained more than of what was lost.

In addition, in the 20th century tribe pursued a major land claim case against the federal government, saying that the three tribes had traditionally controlled one million more acres of land than they had been compensated for following the 1855 treaty. The Indian Claims Commission awarded the confederated tribes several million dollars in a negotiated settlement. They used some of that money in economic development efforts. They also paid per capita claims to tribal members for another part of it.

==Government==
The tribe re-established its government in 1949, writing a constitution that provided for the election of members to the General Council. It is governed by a nine-member council, known as the board of trustees who are elected by the General Council. They serve two-year terms and are elected on staggered terms. This Board replaced the rule by hereditary chiefs.

There is a tribal police force called the Umatilla Tribal Police Department.

==Justice==

=== Pilot Project of VAWA 2013 ===
Since the Supreme Court&#x27;s majority opinion in &quot;Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe&quot;, the tribal courts were prevented to trial a person who is not Native American, unless specifically authorized by the Congress. This body allowed the right for the tribal courts to consider a lawsuit where a man who is not Native American commits domestic violence towards a Native American woman on the territory of a Native American Tribe, through the passage of Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (VAWA 2013) signed into law on March 7, 2013, by President Barack Obama. This was motivated by the high percentage of Native American women being assaulted by men who are not Native American, feeling immune by the lack of jurisdiction of Tribal Courts upon them. This law generally took effect on March 7, 2015, but also authorized a voluntary &quot;Pilot Project&quot; to allow certain tribes to begin exercising special jurisdiction earlier. On February 6, 2014, three tribes were selected for this Pilot Project: the Pascua Yaqui Tribe (Arizona), the Tulalip Tribes of Washington, and the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (Oregon).

The Bureau of Justice along with Tribal Judicial members and the American Probation and Parole Association are working together to come up with effective ways to enhance sentencing on tribal lands. Under the Tribal Law &amp; Order Act of 2010, these groups have made changes to find better ways of achieving justice on the tribal lands. This gives them the authority to provide enhanced sentences and offers a checklist for the tribes to follow in sentencing. It also gives them the options for detention or community correction options for sentencing

==Economy==
The tribe have been working for nearly three decades since the late twentieth century to restore fish habitats and runs of the Umatilla and Grande Ronde rivers. It is buying back land in watersheds of the Umatilla on its reservation, to preserve habitat.

In the early 1980s, under the tribe&#x27;s leadership, salmon were reintroduced in the Umatilla River. The tribe, along with the state of Oregon, operate egg-taking, spawning, and other propagation facilities that are helping restore salmon runs. In 1984, the first fall Chinook salmon in some 70 years returned to the Umatilla River. As a member of the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, the CTUIR also shares management of the Columbia, Snake, Walla Walla, Tucannon, John Day, and Imnaha river basins. &quot;In recent times, tribal fisheries have occurred only on the Umatilla and Columbia rivers.&quot;

The Confederated Tribes opened the Wildhorse Resort &amp; Casino, which now has a hotel and seven restaurants, located four miles east of Pendleton. It also has a golf course. The Wildhorse Casino opened in 1995. The revenues generated from gaming have multiplied the tribe&#x27;s budget by sevenfold, making money available for health, education, housing and economic development. Unemployment on the reservation has been cut by half. Several hundred people work at the resort, and 300 work for the tribe&#x27;s Cayuse Technologies, which opened in 2006 to provide services in software development, a call center, and word processing.

The CTUIR publishes the monthly newspaper, &quot;Confederated Umatilla Journal.&quot; It also operates a radio station: KCUW.

The CTUIR is one of several tribal governments in the northwestern United States to offer free bus service on its reservation.

==Culture and religion==
The traditional religion practiced by many tribal members is called Seven Drums (Washat). The Umatilla Reservation has a religion prominent in both past and present culture that is in relation to spirits and energies where things such as health and weather are controlled by spiritually powerful men and woman called &quot;Shamans.&quot; One can develop a stronger spirit, therefore, be more embedded within this religion by fasting and spending time with oneself in remote areas.

The confederated tribes established Tamástslikt Cultural Institute, operating in Pendleton, Oregon, as a museum to represent its people. It tells traditional stories of the &quot;Natítyat&quot; (Indian people), has exhibits of traditional clothing and tools, as well as art and crafts by contemporary people, and exhibits representing the contemporary world.

As an aspect of contemporary culture, basketball is the most popular sport played on the reservation. Kids start playing from a young age, and many families install basketball hoops at their homes. In 2013 the sisters Shoni and Jude Schimmel from CTUIR, students and basketball players at University of Louisville, played in the NCAA&#x27;s Final Four tournament.

One rich part of past culture was, when one passed in a close-knit tribe, the corpse would be dressed in the nicest clothing that could be afforded and have their faces ornately painted. Some days later they would then be buried with their belongings. People in mourning upon a person&#x27;s death would dress in unkempt clothing and would cut their hair.

In July 1996, ancient remains of a man were found near Kennewick, Washington. He has been called Kennewick Man or the &quot;Ancient One&quot; (by Native Americans). CTUIR joined with the Nez Perce Tribe, Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation and the Wanapum Band in seeking to have the remains reburied as required by traditional tribal law and according to the 1990 federal Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). The remains were estimated to be 9,000 years old and scientists wanted to study them. A series of court cases followed; in 2004 the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled to allow more studies before releasing the remains to the tribes. CTUIR decided not to pursue any more legal action but is seeking to strengthen NAGPRA.

The Confederated Tribes work closely with the Umatilla and Wallowa-Whitman National Forests to identify and protect cultural resources on national forest lands in the region; the tribes retain treaty hunting and fishing rights in the area as well.

==Revitalization of language==
The tribe has developed schools and language curricula to teach and preserve its native languages. These are endangered, as the tribe has only about five native speakers of Walla Walla language and about 50 native speakers of Umatilla language, both of the Sahaptin family. It is concentrating on the more widely shared languages, as Cayuse became extinct by the end of the 19th century. Weyíiletpuu is a dialect of the Nez Perce language as used by the Cayuse people of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation.

Today six language teachers are running programs at the Nixyaawii Community School, which has offered Umatilla, Walla Walla and Nez Perce language classes for the last decade. The tribe is developing &quot;Cay-Uma-Wa,&quot; a Head Start Program to include teaching native languages. In addition, the tribe has developed online video resources and the &quot;Tamaluut&quot; immersion school, designed for 3- to 5-year-olds. At the Pendleton Round-up in September 2013, a young CTUIR woman sang &quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot; in Umatilla, a first at that event.

== Notable CTUIR citizens ==
* Elaine Miles, actor
* Kelsey Motanic, first Umatilla medical doctor, graduated from University of New Mexico
* Charles Sams, National Park Service director
* Shoni and Jude Schimmel, basketball players respectively with the WNBA&#x27;s Atlanta Dream and University of Louisville women&#x27;s basketball team, who made the Women&#x27;s Final Four in April 2013.

== Direct descendants ==

<doc id="931121" wikidata="Q795482" url="?curid=931121" title="Bat*21">
<text>Bat*21 is a 1988 American war drama film directed by Peter Markle, and adapted from the book by William C. Anderson, novelist and retired United States Air Force colonel. Set during the Vietnam War, the film is a dramatization based upon the rescue of a U.S. air navigator shot down behind enemy lines in Vietnam. The film stars Gene Hackman and Danny Glover with Jerry Reed, David Marshall Grant, Clayton Rohner, Erich Anderson and Joe Dorsey in supporting roles.

==Plot==
During the last days of the Vietnam War, USAF Lieutenant Colonel Iceal E. &quot;Gene&quot; Hambleton (Gene Hackman), call sign BAT-21 Bravo, is flying aboard an EB-66C electronic warfare aircraft, engaged in electronic countermeasures preparatory to a major bombing strike. Without warning, a number of SA-2 Guideline SAMs are launched from North Vietnam, targeting their aircraft. A massive SAM explosion tears off the tail and Hambleton, in the navigator&#x27;s position, ejects as the sole survivor of the six-man crew.

While still coming down by parachute, Hambleton makes radio contact with Captain Bartholomew &quot;Birddog&quot; Clark (Danny Glover), the pilot of a Cessna O-2 Skymaster, flying a forward air control mission near where the EB-66 was destroyed. Birddog becomes Hambleton&#x27;s link to rescue.

Hambleton, an expert on electronic weapons systems and who holds valuable information, is known to the North Vietnamese, who begin an all-out search, attempting to capture him. An effort to steal supplies from Vietnamese villagers is not successful, as Hambleton is discovered and kills an aggressive peasant farmer, apologizing to his grieving family as he escapes.

Knowing that his current location is too dangerous for rescue aircraft, Hambleton devises a plan to reach safer territory. He plots a course to the river which is the boundary of the target area, then communicates his intended path to Clark in a code composed of various golf courses he knows well. This will allow the rescuers to keep track of his progress, making it easier for them to pick him up.

Several attempts are made to recover Hambleton. Two helicopters are lost and members of its crews are killed or captured. Clark ultimately flies a &quot;Huey&quot; helicopter rescue mission, but as he retrieves Hambleton, the pair are shot down by ground fire, with Clark being wounded. An F-100 bombing raid both assists and hinders their progress through the jungle, as North Vietnamese irregulars are trailing them. In the end, Hambleton and Clark are rescued by a USN PCF patrolling nearby on the Cam Lo River.

===Historical accuracy===

Portions of &quot;Bat*21&quot; were highly dramatized, including the climactic battle. Some characters were composites of real people, while others were created for the film. However, some other details were accurate, including that rescuer Captain Larry Potts was African American.

The actual rescue took over eleven days, during which a major attack was delayed, resulting in numerous South Vietnamese soldiers being killed and wounded. A Forward Air Observer aircraft was shot down and USAF 1Lt Bruce Walker and USMC 1Lt Larry Potts parachuted to the ground safely, eluding capture. In an ensuing attack, six more Americans lost their lives attempting to rescue him.

The North Vietnamese, alerted by the intense efforts to find the flyer, increased their efforts to find Hambleton. Walker was discovered and killed by the Vietnamese forces. During a covert nighttime operation more than behind enemy lines, Hambleton was rescued in a land operation by U.S. Navy SEAL Lt. j.g. Thomas R. Norris and VNN Petty Officer Third Class Nguyen Van Kiet.

<text>John Austin (3 March 1790 – 1 December 1859) was an English legal theorist who posthumously influenced British and American law with an analytical approach to jurisprudence and a theory of legal positivism. Austin opposed traditional approaches of &quot;natural law&quot;, arguing against any need for connections between law and morality. Human legal systems, he claimed, can and should be studied in an empirical, value-free way.

==Life and work==
Austin was born on 3 March 1790 at Creeting St Mary in today&#x27;s district of Mid Suffolk, as the eldest son of a well-to-do miller.

After spending five years in the army during the Napoleonic Wars, Austin turned to law, and spent seven unhappy years practicing at the Chancery bar. In 1819, he married Sarah Taylor and became neighbours and close friends with Jeremy Bentham, James Mill, and John Stuart Mill. Mainly through Bentham&#x27;s influence, Austin was appointed Professor of Jurisprudence at the newly-founded University College London in July 1827. However, Austin&#x27;s lectures were not well-attended and he resigned his university post in 1834.

Thereafter, aside from two stints on government commissions, Austin lived largely on his wife Sarah Austin&#x27;s earnings as a writer and translator. Plagued by ill health, depression and self-doubt, Austin wrote little after the publication of his major work, &quot;The Province of Jurisprudence Determined&quot; (1832). This work was largely ignored in Austin&#x27;s lifetime, but became influential after his death, when his widow published a second edition in 1861. A second book, &quot;Lectures on Jurisprudence&quot;, was put together by her from Austin&#x27;s notes and published in 1863.

In 1833, Austin was appointed to the Royal Commission on the Criminal Law 1833, a royal commission to consolidate existing statutes of criminal law into an English Criminal Code. There were conflicting interests between Bellenden Ker and Austin on the Commission. Austin&#x27;s interest in codification was heavily influenced by his mentor, Bentham, whereas Ker&#x27;s interest came from concerns about the quality of statutes and the difficulty drafting legislation Finding the work congenial and little support in his opinions, in 1836, Austin resigned after signing two reports and was replaced by barrister David Jardine.

John Austin died on 1 December 1859 in Weybridge. His only child, Lucie, later became Lady Duff-Gordon.

==Legal positivism==
Austin&#x27;s goal was to transform law into a true science. To do this, he believed it was necessary to purge human law of all moralistic notions and to define key legal concepts in strictly empirical terms. Law, according to Austin, is a social fact and reflects relations of power and obedience. This twofold view, that (1) law and morality are separate and (2) that all human-made (&quot;positive&quot;) laws can be traced back to human lawmakers, is known as legal positivism. Drawing heavily on the thought of Jeremy Bentham, Austin was the first legal thinker to work out a fully developed positivistic theory of law.

Austin argues that laws are rules, which he defines as a type of command. More precisely, laws are general commands issued by a sovereign to members of an independent political society, and backed up by credible threats of punishment or other adverse consequences (&quot;sanctions&quot;) in the event of non-compliance. The sovereign in any legal system is the person or group of persons habitually obeyed by the bulk of the population, which does not habitually obey anyone else. A command is a declared wish that something should be done, issued by a superior, and accompanied by threats in the event of non-compliance. Such commands give rise to legal duties to obey. Note that all the key concepts in this account (law, sovereign, command, sanction, duty) are defined in terms of empirically verifiable social facts. No moral judgment, according to Austin, is ever necessary to determine what the law is—though morality must be consulted in determining what the law should be. Austin, as a utilitarian, believed that laws should promote the greatest happiness of society.

==Criticism==
Though Austin&#x27;s brand of legal positivism was greatly influential in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it is widely seen as overly simplistic today. Critics such as H. L. A. Hart have charged that Austin&#x27;s account fails to recognize that:
* Law-making powers are dispersed in many modern societies and it is difficult to identify a &quot;sovereign&quot; in Austin&#x27;s sense.
* Most legal systems include rules that do not impose sanctions, but empower officials or citizens to do certain things (such as drawing up wills), or specify ways that legal rules may be identified or changed.
* Those threats do not give rise to obligations. If they did, there would be no essential difference between a gunman&#x27;s threat (&quot;Your money or your life&quot;) and an ordinary piece of legislation.

<text>Sir Robert Aytoun or Ayton (c. 1570–1638) was a Scottish poet.

==Biography==

Aytoun was the son of Andrew Ayton of Kinaldie Castle, in Fife, Scotland, and Mary Lundie.

Aytoun and his elder brother John entered St Leonard&#x27;s College in St Andrews in 1584. After graduating MA from St Andrews in 1588, he studied civil law at Paris.

He appears to have been well known to his literary contemporaries in Scotland and England. He became a groom in the privy chamber of King James in succession to Laurence Marbury, was knighted and became a gentleman of the bedchamber in 1612. He became secretary and master of requests to Anne of Denmark in succession to another Scottish poet, William Fowler. He was sent as ambassador to Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor in 1609. He was later secretary to Henrietta Maria.

He wrote poems in Latin, Greek, and English, and was one of the first Scots to write in standard English. His major work was &quot;Diophantus and Charidora&quot;.

&quot;Inconstancy Upbraided&quot; is perhaps the best of his short poems. He is credited with a little poem, &quot;Old Long Syne&quot;, which probably suggested Robert Burns&#x27;s famous &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;.

Aytoun died at Whitehall Palace and is buried in the south ambulatory area of in Westminster Abbey. The monument includes a bronze bust, attributed, variously, to either Hubert Le Sueur or Francesco Fanelli. Amongst his bequests, Aytoun gave a diamond hatband to William Murray and his French bed to Jane Whorwood.

==Bothwell and Little Jock Elliot==
He is also the author of a ballad called &quot;Bothwell&quot; about the battle fought by James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell with the border reiver, John Elliot of Park, also known as Little Jock Elliot or Little Jock of the Park. The ballad recounts how Bothwell, in attempting to arrest Little Jock Elliot, suffers life-threatening wounds, though he ends by slaying his foe. Ayton was eight years old at the time Bothwell perished in a dungeon in Denmark, and hence must have heard about the attempted arrest of Elliot by people familiar with the story, particularly as Bothwell was a figure of national renown.

The Border ballad &quot;Little Jock Elliot&quot; celebrates, amongst other events, the achievements of Little Jock Elliot on this occasion and has the refrain &quot;My name is little Jock Elliot and wha daur meddle wi&#x27; me!&quot;. This latter ballad, of indeterminate date, also implicitly states that Little Jock Elliot survived the encounter with Bothwell.

<doc id="931139" wikidata="Q312436" url="?curid=931139" title="Happy Valley, Hong Kong">
<text>Happy Valley () is an upper-income residential area in Hong Kong, located on Hong Kong Island. The area is bordered by Caroline Hill to the east, Jardine&#x27;s Lookout to the south, Morrison Hill to the west, and Causeway Bay to the north. Administratively, it is part of Wan Chai District.

Happy Valley is considered as an area surrounded by Caroline Hill Road to the east, Tai Hang Road and Stubbs Road to the south, Canal Road Flyover and westbound section of Wong Nai Chung Road to the west, and Leighton Road to the north.

The area is home to the Happy Valley Racecourse, Hong Kong Racing Museum, Hong Kong Jockey Club Happy Valley Clubhouse, Hong Kong Sanatorium &amp; Hospital, Hong Kong Adventist Hospital – Stubbs Road, home to a number of sports clubs including Valley RFC rugby club, Craigengower Cricket Club, Hong Kong FC football club, and a number of cemeteries including the Hong Kong Cemetery.

It has a population of 32,202 people, 70.7% of them being Chinese. Other ethnic minority groups include Filipinos (12.8%) and whites (6.3%).

==History==

The area now known as Happy Valley was formerly known as Wong Nai Chung Valley, sometimes known as Wong Nai Chung Kuk () or Wong Nai Chung Valley because of the (, &quot;lit.&quot; yellow mud stream) that leads into the area, where the Wong Nai Chung referred to is a mud-filled river collecting waters from the Wong Nai Chung Gap and surrounding area. The river nourished the rice paddies until the construction of Happy Valley Racecourse in 1846.

In early 1840, the British Army set a military camp in the area. However, the camp was later closed due to the increasing number of soldiers succumbing to malaria. The cause of malaria was unknown at the time and the soldiers apparently suffered a then-unknown fever. Early settlers had suggested the area to be used as a business centre, but the idea was shelved due to the valley&#x27;s marshy environment, which was believed to be causing fatal diseases. The death rate in the area and Victoria City was high in the early colonial days, and the valley became a burial ground for the dead. As a result, the valley was renamed &quot;Happy Valley&quot;, a common euphemism for cemeteries. In 1846, the British felt that the valley terrain was ideal for horse-racing, and thus cleared the paddy fields and developed the Happy Valley Racecourse. For this, the Wong Nai Chung river was redirected to the Bowrington Canal, known as Ngo Keng Kan () locally, concurrent with the reclamation of Wan Chai. The canal is now covered by Canal Road.

On 26 February 1918, there was a fire in the racecourse that claimed at least 590 lives. By the next day, as many as 576 confirmed deaths were reported by the Hong Kong Telegraph. It was caused by the collapse of a temporary grandstand, which knocked over food stalls and set bamboo matting ablaze. Most of the dead bodies became unrecognisable and assumed to be &quot;Chinese&quot;. They were buried in the nearby So Kon Po area (now the site of Hong Kong Stadium). A Chinese-styled memorial site known as &quot;Race Course Fire Memorial&quot; was built in the Chinese cemetery (now behind the east stand of the stadium).

In 1922, the Hong Kong Sanatorium and Hospital located in Happy Valley started operation.

On 19 December 1941, the Japanese Imperial Army entered the hill east of the valley and fought their way to Blue Pool Road. On (now Blue Pool Road) a number of large massacres occurred, most notably the Blue Pool Road Massacre, where civilians were bayoneted. Civilians and Soldiers captured were kept in the appalling conditions of &#x27;the black hole of Hong Kong&#x27; (a house on Blue Pool Road). The Japanese later advanced up to Wong Nai Chung Gap, where the battle of Wong Nai Chung Gap occurred, resulting in Japanese control of the gap. Although the low-areas of Happy Valley were captured, areas surrounding Leighton Hill and Morrison Hill were still contested until later in the Battle of Hong Kong.

==Characteristics==

Happy Valley is made up of upper-income residential areas. Residents are relatively diverse as to Hong Kong natives and foreigners. Two of the territory&#x27;s tallest residential buildings, Highcliff and The Summit are specifically in Stubbs Road, facing Mount Nicholson.

Happy Valley hosts six cemeteries, from south to north, the Happy Valley Jewish Cemetery, the Hindu Cemetery, the Parsee Cemetery, Hong Kong Cemetery, St. Michael&#x27;s Catholic Cemetery, and the Muslim Cemetery.

The Hong Kong Racing Museum and the associated Happy Valley Racecourse, one of the two tracks of the Hong Kong Jockey Club, is in Happy Valley. Whenever a race runs, surrounding traffic patterns have to be changed: cars have to enter Happy Valley and the racecourse via Wong Nai Chung Road in a clockwise fashion, and the road may be heavily congested. The stadium lights in the racecourse illuminate nearby buildings even when the buildings themselves are unlit.

Many other sports are participated and competed in by Hong Kong First Division&#x27;s Happy Valley Athletic Association.

==Climate==
Happy Valley is often a hot spot in Hong Kong. On 8 August 2015, Happy Valley recorded a temperature of .

<doc id="931153" wikidata="Q7341787" url="?curid=931153" title="Robert Bage">
<text>Robert Bage (11 March 1730 – 1 September 1801) was an English businessman and novelist.

==Biography==
Born in Darley Abbey, near Derby, Bage was the son of a paper-maker who had four wives, the first of whom was Bage&#x27;s mother. She died soon after his birth. Bage received his early education at a common school in Derby, where he was an excellent student. He attained a working knowledge of Latin by the age of seven. He was given his training as a paper-maker while he was an apprentice to his father. At the age of 23, Bage married a beautiful and wealthy young woman. With the boost in his finances he set up a paper-manufacturing business in Elford, Staffordshire, which he continued until his death.

Bage was a skilled businessman and his smooth running of his business allowed him time for intellectual pursuits. He learned the French language on his own, through books, and studied mathematics. In 1765 he entered into a partnership in an iron foundry with three other men including Erasmus Darwin. After 14 years in business, the partnership was terminated, leaving Bage with a loss of more than 1,000 pounds. This was a considerable loss, and Bage decided to begin his career in literature partly to make up for it. He published his first novel, &quot;Mount Henneth&quot;, in 1781.

Bage left Elford in 1793 and resided nearby in Tamworth. He died in 1801, and was survived by his wife and two of their sons. Another son, John, had died as a young man, a great affliction to Bage. His oldest son, Charles, settled in Shrewsbury, where he became a cotton manufacturer, and his youngest son, Edward, became a surgeon.

==Literary work and public life==
It was not until he was 53 that he took to literature; however, in the 15 years following, he produced six novels, of which Sir Walter Scott said that &quot;strong mind, playful fancy, and extensive knowledge are everywhere apparent.&quot; Scott included &quot;Mount Henneth&quot; (1781), &quot;Barham Downs&quot; (1784), and &quot;James Wallace&quot; (1792) in his series of &quot;Ballantyne novels&quot;. Bage was brought up as a Quaker, but he became a philosophical and religious radical after the French Revolution. He advocated democracy and equality (the abolition of the peerage), as well as the abolition of institutional religion. A member of the Derby Philosophical Society, he was also associated with the Lunar Society of Birmingham.

The work for which he is chiefly read today is &quot;Hermsprong&quot;, his last novel. Although regarded as radical at the time, it is somewhat disjointed. The first half has strong philosophical content, but in the second half the book, whilst retaining a strong satirical element, becomes more of a sentimental novel. The philosophical challenge of the novel is that it concerns an American who has been raised entirely by American Indians, without either formal education or religion. With only nature to teach him, he sees through the hypocrisy of society and English manners. It is notable for pursuing the theme of the noble savage and, in particular, &quot;nativism&quot; or innatism.

<text>Power projection (or force projection or strength projection) in international relations is the capacity of a state to deploy and sustain forces outside its territory. The ability of a state to project its power into an area may serve as an effective diplomatic lever, influencing the decision-making processes and acting as a potential deterrent on other states&#x27; behavior.

This ability is a crucial element of a state&#x27;s power in international relations. Any state able to direct its military forces outside its territory might be said to have &quot;some&quot; level of power projection capability, but the term itself is used most frequently in reference to militaries with a worldwide reach (or at least significantly broader than a state&#x27;s immediate area). Even states with sizable hard power assets (such as a large standing army) may only be able to exert limited regional influence so long as they lack the means of effectively projecting their power on a global scale. Generally, only a select few states are able to overcome the logistical difficulties inherent in the deployment and direction of a modern, mechanized military force. Allies and partners can take up or share some of the burden of power projection. One measure of the capability of a state to project power is the loss-of-strength gradient, until a culminating point is apparent to others, once an operation is underway.

A state might § compete in the gray zone just short of conflict, exercising its soft power, or hard power, in a bid for potential superpower. While traditional measures of power projection typically focus on hard power assets (tanks, soldiers, aircraft, naval vessels, etc.), the use of soft power shows that power projection does not necessarily have to actively put military forces in combat, but only potentially. Assets for power projection can often serve dual uses, as the deployment of various countries&#x27; militaries during the humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake illustrates.

==History==
Early examples of power projection include Roman dominance of Europe and the wider Mediterranean basin: the ability to project power is tied to the ability to innovate and field such innovations. Roman engineering innovations such as machines (pile driver), concrete, aqueducts and modern roads provided the footing for an economic engine that powered a military that was unmatched in its day. Examples of Roman power projection include Julius Caesar constructing the Rhine bridge in 10 days to demonstrate the ability to march his 40,000 troops as he saw fit: the local inhabitants enjoyed the natural protection of the river and fled when this natural protection was overcome. Although Rome is far from the center of modern power, its influence can be seen in the architecture of modern capitols around the world (domes, arches, columns). The demonstration of an extraordinary innovative military capability will signal power and, when properly applied, terminate conflicts summarily.

During the Ming treasure voyages in the 15th century, the Chinese treasure fleet was heavily militarized to exercise power projection around the Indian Ocean and thereby promote its interests.

The modern ability to project power and exert influence on a global scale can be tied to innovations stemming from the Industrial Revolution and the associated modernizations in technology, communications, finance and bureaucracy; this finally allowed the state to create unprecedented amounts of wealth and to effectively marshal these resources to exert power over long distances.

As the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, Britain was the first to utilize its industrial-technological power advantage to dominate rivals and greatly expand its global Empire throughout the 19th century. As a maritime power, the Royal Navy played a central role in providing Britain the strength and ability to dominate world trade and project power globally to further its interests. A worldwide system of naval bases and coaling stations, a large logistical bureaucracy to oversee shipbuilding, the supply of coal, food, water, and sailors, and an industrial base for the manufacture and technological enhancement of the fleet were among the essential ingredients for this capability. During the First Opium War (1839–1842), it was this capacity that enabled a British expeditionary force of 15 barracks ships, 4 steam-powered gunboats and 25 smaller boats with 4,000 marines to successfully defend its interests from the fleet&#x27;s home port.

The Anglo-French expeditionary force sent to shore up the Ottoman Empire against Russian aggression during the Crimean War (1853–1856) was one of the earliest modern examples of a planned expeditionary power-projection campaign. It was the first campaign to use modern technology, including steam-powered warships and telegraph communications.

Another illustrative example of industrial power projection, was the British Expedition to Abyssinia in 1868 as a retaliation against Emperor Tewodros II of Ethiopia&#x27;s imprisonment of several missionaries and British government representatives. The expeditionary force sent was a tremendous logistical and technological challenge at the time. Commanded by Lieutenant-General Sir Robert Napier of the Bombay Army, military intelligence was used to estimate the required size of the army and the difficulties of traversing the inhospitable terrain.

A force of over 30,000 was shipped from British India to Zula on the Red Sea on a fleet of more than 280 steam ships, while an advance detachment of engineers built a large port with two piers, warehouses and a lighthouse, and constructed a -long railway towards the interior. A road was also built for the artillery to be moved along with the help of elephants. After three months of trekking, the British force repelled an Ethiopian attack and launched an artillery bombardment against the fortress of Magdala which led to its capitulation; Tewodros committed suicide.

In the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, the Japanese destruction of the Imperial Russian Navy&#x27;s Pacific Fleet demonstrated Imperial Russia&#x27;s inability to project force in the East. This immediately diminished Russia&#x27;s diplomatic sway in that region. At the same time, Russia&#x27;s western armies became less credible, as mobilization exposed organizational flaws and threw the western armies into chaos. This led analysts in Europe, such as German chief of staff Count Alfred von Schlieffen, to conclude that Russia would prove inept at projecting force in Europe, thus demoting Russia in European diplomatic relations.

Many other actions can be considered projections of force. The 19th century is full of incidents such as the 1864 Shimonoseki campaign and the Boxer Rebellion. More recently, the Falklands War provided an example of the United Kingdom&#x27;s ability to project force far from home. Other recent examples of power projection include the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. The ability of the U.S. Navy, the British Royal Navy, and the French Navy to deploy large numbers of ships for long periods of time away from home are notable projection abilities. &quot;See § Power projection capabilities.&quot;

The globalization of power projection was long avoided in the research with the subject of globalization mostly channeled to economic field, but in 2018 Historian Max Ostrovsky broke the path. In prehistory, he wrote, power was not projected behind entrance of a cave. In history, empires and colonies projected power ever farther, creating world system c. 1900. World Wars were expressions of power projected on global scale.

The potential of power projection can be estimated mathematically by calculating the speed of transportation and communication relatively to the extent of contemporary power projection. Roman troops moved 50 km per day; today Globemasters move troops 20,000 km per day. The speed of communication in the largest Empire in Americas (Inca) was 20 km per hour (running man); today it moves with the speed of light. Multiplying the range of power projection in those empires by increase in the speed of transportation or communication, Ostrovsky estimated the present power projection potential to exceed the size of Earth multiple times.

==Elements==

The U.S. Department of Defense defines power projection as the &quot;ability of a nation to apply all or some of its elements of national power—political, economic, informational, or military—to rapidly and effectively deploy and sustain forces in and from multiple dispersed locations to respond to crises, to contribute to deterrence, and to enhance regional stability&quot;.

As distance between a fighting force and its headquarters increases, command and control inevitably becomes more difficult. Modern-day power projection often employs high-tech communications and information technology to overcome these difficulties, a process sometimes described as the &quot;Revolution in Military Affairs&quot;.

While a few long-range weapons such as the intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and some unmanned combat aerial vehicles (drones) are capable of projecting deadly force in their own right, it is military logistics that is at the heart of power projection. The ability to integrate naval and air forces with land armies as part of joint warfare is a key aspect of effective power projection; airlift and sealift capabilities facilitate the deployment of soldiers and weapons to a distant theater of war.

The aircraft carrier strike group, strategic bomber, ballistic missile submarine, and strategic airlifter are all examples of power projection platforms. Military units designed to be light and mobile, such as airborne forces (paratroopers and air assault forces) and amphibious assault forces, are utilized in power projection. Forward basing is another method of power projection, which, by pre-positioning military units or stockpiles of arms at strategically located military bases outside a country&#x27;s territory, reduces the time and distance needed to mobilize them.

==Types==
Scholars have disaggregated military power projection into nine different categories based on political goals and level of force. Four of these employ &quot;soft&quot; military power (securing sea lanes of communication, non-combatant evacuation, humanitarian response, and peacekeeping) and the rest are primarily concerned with &quot;hard&quot; military power (, compellence/deterrence, punishment, armed intervention, and conquest). There is a § continuum in these capabilities.

===Soft power===

Examples of soft power projection include:

* Securing sea lanes of communication: the protection of shipping lanes from attack by hostile states or irregular threats.
* Non-combatant evacuation operations: the evacuation of citizens or friendly third-country civilians from a foreign country when they are endangered by war or civil unrest.
* Humanitarian response: the use of military forces abroad to assist in the aftermath of a natural disaster.
* Peacekeeping: military operations designed to support diplomatic efforts to reach a long-term political settlement to an ongoing dispute.
* Establishing trust, as the basis of cooperation among allies and partners

===Gray zone competition===
:&quot;This section has been split from US Army Futures Command § Other armies&quot;

The gray zone between cooperation and conflict has expanded due to the competition in power projection capabilities of the world&#x27;s armies, as well as in the competition for economic power among the world&#x27;s nations. 
The US, Russia, China, Britain, and France have renounced the use of nuclear weapons in 2022. However, in the face of threats of nuclear war (say from Russia, as threatened during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine), NATO keeps about 100 B61 nuclear bombs in storage in Europe. Certain F-35As were certified to carry the B61 nuclear bomb on 12 October 2023. 

The British Army is investigating innovations, such as robots and drones, including 70 technologies funded by the £800 million (US$1 billion) Defence Innovation Fund launched in 2016. Two hundred troops will engage in &quot;surveillance, long-range, and precision targeting, enhanced mobility and the re-supply of forces, urban warfare and enhanced situational awareness&quot;. The British Army is reducing size by about 10,000 troops as well, by 2025. The British Army will have Integrated Operating Concept (MDI—like MDO) for &quot;gray zone&quot; operations across domains, using a synthetic operating environment, with repeatable hard and soft strike capability. The UK, Germany, and France respectively have established a joint command for space United Kingdom Space Command, a Space Situational Awareness Centre (Germany), and &quot;Commandement de l’espace&quot; (France). In light of the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine NATO members are implementing new stockpile guidelines for their arsenals.
&quot;By 2020 the Army&#x27;s programs for modernization were now framed as a decades-long process of cooperation with allies and partners, for competition with potential adversaries who historically have blurred the distinction between peace and war&quot;—from: § Reorganization plan of the United States Army

#In 2020, one measure of § military power projection ranks the competition between the armies of the world (after the US Army, which is ranked atop this list). The list of armies, a mixture of allies, partners, and competitors is estimated to be:
#Russia jammed the GPS signal during NATO exercises in November 2018. In 2014 the DoD&#x27;s research and engineering chief Alan Shaffer warned that the &#x27;US lost dominance of the electromagnetic spectrum&#x27; (EMS), in part due to the US government selloff of EMS radio frequencies, and also due in part to the proliferation of digital technologies which allow for low-cost jammers. (&quot;See: meaconing&quot;) General Valery Gerasimov advocates hybrid warfare, a &quot;blend of political, economic and military power to bear against adversaries&quot;. Russia took Crimea without firing a shot. In April 2020 Russia tested an anti-satellite system for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. On 15 November 2021, a Russian anti-satellite test destroyed its Kosmos 1408, endangering its own cosmonauts on the International Space Station, and other satellites in low earth orbit. Cyber attacks on the whole of the US government via Supply_chain_attack § Whole of government began in March 2020, but only reached the attention of the news media on 14 December 2020. Russia is mapping the undersea cables which bear the majority of the communications traffic between the US and Europe.
#*On 25 December 2021 President Putin disclosed that Russia would be unable to defend itself against missiles launched against Moscow from Ukraine; their flight times would be four to five minutes, according to him. However, Putin did not acknowledge that the West&#x27;s Aegis Ashore sites in Poland and Romania are for defense against ballistic missiles, and not the Tomahawk missiles which he named in his statement. &quot;See: A-135 anti-ballistic missile system, A-235 anti-ballistic missile system, S-400 missile system, S-500 missile system &quot; To prove that Aegis Ashore is defensive only, inspection of the sites in Poland and Romania have been offered to Russia.
#*Ukraine had a trench network on its border with Russia, in a standoff as of April 2021. A border exercise involving 110,000 Russian troops on the Ukraine border has pulled back; however hundreds of armored vehicles, including tanks are remaining from Donbas (colloquial for Donets basin) in spite of a partial armor pullback. Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OCSE) drones which are monitoring the line between Ukrainian troops and the Donbas separatists are seeing jamming of their drone&#x27;s dual GPS receivers, with tens of thousands of infantry troops remaining on the Ukrainian border. The OSCE has provided a map of the line dividing the Ukrainian forces and the Russian-backed forces. As of 18 February 2022 there were up to 190,000 troops along Ukraine&#x27;s borders; after recognizing the separatist states of the Donetsk and Luhansk People&#x27;s Republics, Moscow is moving troops over the border of Russia into the Donetsk and Luhansk areas, and establishing military bases there. This troop movement triggered sanctions on five Russian banks and three individuals, on 22 February 2022. (&quot;See 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine&quot; which began 24 February 2022)
#**Andrei Illarionov cites Pavel Felgengauer, who projects a scenario by which Russia can create a &#x27;Novorossia&#x27; (see § CSIS figures 2a-2c) stretching across Southern Ukraine to Transnistria (Moldova) after a gas pipeline to the EU is completed (September 2021). If the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline were to be weaponized by holding the liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply to Western Europe hostage, the US is countering this threat with contingency plans to redirect LNG supplies from the rest of the world. Germany has agreed to safeguard Ukraine, as well. &quot;See 2022 Nord Stream pipeline sabotage —26 September 2022 &quot;
#**Cyber attacks on Ukrainian government websites are occurring in January 2022. Frida Ghitis and Richard Galant point out that the muddy season that ends winter would bog down an armored invasion. US Army Lieutenant Colonel Alex Vershinen points out that if the Russian Army were to attempt a quick &quot;fait accompli&quot; and then dig in, its logistical capability would be insufficient to complete a large land grab, as its logistic capabilities are largely based on railroads, but not trucks. Russia&#x27;s logistic capability without railroads is , without replenishment; thus Sebastien Roblin suggests that a &quot;short, victorious war&quot; by Russia (as in the 12-day war with Georgia in 2008), with stipulations largely resembling its current diplomatic demands, namely installation of pro-Russian leadership, Ukraine&#x27;s withdrawal from the path of joining NATO etc., coupled with the expedient of bypassing Russian control of Kyiv&#x27;s population, might avoid Russia&#x27;s getting bogged down in Ukraine. This calculation could get up-ended by a longer war, with determined resistance in Ukraine, via guerilla warfare, as in Afghanistan (1979-1989), which indirectly ended the Soviet Union. Within two months of the beginning of the First Chechen War, an antiwar movement arose in Russia.
#***On 22 February 2022 historian Sergey Radchenko recalled a vignette from September 1945, during the post World War II Potsdam Conference negotiations on the division of world power at the London Conference of Foreign Ministers, when Soviet Foreign Commissar Vyacheslav Molotov asked U.S. Secretary of State James F. Byrnes whether he carried the atomic bomb in his side pocket, to which Byrnes threatened Molotov to stop stalling, or else Byrnes would pull the atomic bomb out of his pocket and use it on Molotov (&quot;laughter&quot;). Molotov was guided by Stalin&#x27;s directive &quot;It is clear that you must display complete obduracy&quot;. (&quot;See Proxy war&quot;)
#* Russia and Belarus began Zapad 2021, a 200,000-troop exercise held every four years. The Pripyat marshes would bog down an armored invasion through Belarus.
#*In the opinion of James Stavridis, the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine is showing that Special Forces, unmanned systems, and Cyber will become far more important in the future.
#*In 2021 Russia spent 2.7 percent of its GDP on defense, a level which is expected to drop to 2.3 percent by 2023, as part of a mandate to boost domestic production.
#**Unmanned ground combat vehicles (UGCVs), among them Uran-6, Uran-9 (Уран-9), and Uran-14 are entering service in the Russian Army as of 2021. Uran-6 is a mine flail; Uran-14 is an unmanned firefighting vehicle. Uran-9s are semi-autonomous robotic combat vehicles; specialists can operate them using mobile control stations. Their first attempted service was in Syria. Analysts from BAE Systems (UK) assessed the Uran-9s in Syria as unreliable, with their radio-controls sometimes blocked by buildings; their sensors and guidance were unstabilized. An armed Uran-9 weighs 12 tons, and measures 5 meters long, which is a fifth of the weight and half the length of a T-90 tank. Each Uran-9 control system operates at ranges up to from the UGVs; each control system currently (2021) guides 4 UGVs, in a leader-follower configuration. Uran-9 was used in the Vostok 2018 exercises in 2018. At least 20 Uran-9 UGCVs exist.
#**Russia&#x27;s defense ministry has signed a contract to field the Tsirkon hypersonic missiles to its troops in 2025.
#**During the 2021 negotiations for defusing the Ukraine-Russia confrontation, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov has warned that its 9M729 nuclear-capable cruise missile, which is already deployed in the European part of Russia, might be further employed there.
#** The hypersonic Kh-47M2 Kinzhal, and 3M22 Zircon (Tsirkon) are standoff strike weapons, for keeping adversaries at bay; they are land-based, and sea-based respectively.
#* On 1 September 2022 Russia, China, India, and 11 other nations began a scaled-down Vostok 2022 (East 2022). Vostok will exercise 50,000 troops, down from 300,000 in 2018. India is contributing 75 troops.
#* By 19 October 2022 NATO nations were providing winter equipment to Ukraine. By Spring 2023 the US industrial base can be providing 20,000 rounds of 155mm howitzer munitions per month to Ukraine.
#* Beginning 1 April 2023 400,000 contract servicemen are to replenish the Russian army.
#*In a meeting in Moscow, March 2023 the presidents of China and Russia agreed to cooperate over a wide range of business, and economic issues, such as payment in local currencies (viz., Yuan or Rubles).
#China—RAND simulations show Blue losses. Six of the top 15 defense companies in the world are now Chinese, in 2019 for the first time. The competition with China was shaped in the decade 2010–2020, according to David Kriete. By 2023 China&#x27;s defense companies were offering competitors to US Javelins, armed drones, and supersonic cruise missiles.
#*Secretary Mark Esper said that China is aiming to be the dominant military power in Asia by 2049. The 14th five-year plan (2021-2025) of China&#x27;s ruling party, aims to accelerate the army&#x27;s modernization and informationization, in order to improve national security for 2027 (100th anniversary of its ruling party), according to Dean Cheng. By 2023 China&#x27;s working-age demographic (a shrinking labor force/ capital savings rate) will start to work against the Party&#x27;s aspiration for 2027, which, according to Xi Jinping&#x27;s plan, is for China&#x27;s military to reach parity with the US military in 2027. As of June 2023 a diplomatic solution is being sought.
#* The International Federation of Robotics reports that China has been the world leader in implementing industrial robots for the past eight years; in 2020 China used almost half the world&#x27;s industrial robots.
#** The takeover of a UK semiconductor fab by a Chinese-owned firm has been blocked on national security grounds. 
#*In 2017 China adopted the National Intelligence Law which obligates Chinese companies to subordinate themselves to intelligence-gathering measures for the state. China is militarizing the South China Sea. In 2020 a match-up of the Chinese aircraft carrier &quot;Liaoning&quot; (a rebuilt aircraft cruiser) versus the supercarrier is assessed to give the &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; air superiority within one hour.
#*The 3rd generation GPS network of BeiDou satellites (BDS-3) was completed in July 2020 with the launch of the 30th BDS-3 satellite. The 30th BDS-3 satellite, meant to complete China&#x27;s own global navigation satellite system, had been previously postponed. &quot;See Restrictions on geographic data in China&quot;
#* Satellite images of 4 June 2021 reveal an estimated 250 additional missile silos under construction near Yumen, China, warn specialists at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies. By 2024 China had over 500 nuclear warheads.
#*The Defense Intelligence Agency projects that China will at least double its nuclear arsenal and that its production capability will be far expanded in the 2020s.
#*China controls 80% of world rare earth mineral production, and routinely floods this market when other nations attempt to ramp up their own rare earth production.
#**The tech leaders of China are being enlisted to aid &#x27;Socialism with Chinese characteristics&#x27; by pledging part of their wealth to &#x27;common prosperity&#x27;. The Cyberspace Administration of China is regulating algorithms on its financial reporting websites which republish foreign financial journalists. 
#*Chinese cyber groups are attacking Russia, reports Ben Watson. China is accelerating its timeline to take Taiwan.
#*149 Chinese fighters and bombers swept over Taiwan&#x27;s Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) 1–4 October 2021. Taiwan has countered with Civil Air Patrol warnings.
#* China is implementing its plan for 2027: Office of Secretary of Defense (3 Nov 2021) &quot;Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China&quot;, Annual report to Congress China has been reverse-engineering its purchases of Russian materiel, and selling to Russia&#x27;s defense customers.
#** By November 2022 a strict zero-Covid lockdown policy instituted in 2020 had led to 2022 COVID-19 protests in China; China then allowed use of a locally-developed mRNA vaccine (2 December 2022), in lieu of lockdowns.
#India: faces Pakistan; Pakistan can be supplied with Turkey&#x27;s drones (such as the Bayraktar TB2), which were used with great effect by Azerbaijan against Armenian tanks and Armenian air defense during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war. In 2010 China deployed 11,000 troops in Gilgit, near Kashmir.
#*Japan and India have agreed to enhance their bilateral defense cooperation (9 September 2022).
#Japan: faces North Korea; Japan has expressed interest in developing its own F-X fighter program; Brian Burton notes that interoperable materiel is needed for allies and partners of the US, and that the US could constructively influence Japan&#x27;s impending 20-year development effort with lessons learned from UAVs and air defense, for example. On 26 December 2019, at Putin&#x27;s annual news conference with foreign media, Hirofumi Sugizaki, a Japanese journalist asked about the end of the INF Treaty and the cooperation of Russia and China on an anti-missile system. Putin characterized the anti-missile system as defensive, and the relation of US and Russia as a &#x27;draw&#x27; (ヒキワケ—&quot;hikiwake&quot;). Japan will compensate companies for not disclosing patents with military applications. In a Joint test, Japan&#x27;s Cooperative Engagement Capability allowed JS Maya to detect and track a ballistic missile; JS Haguro shot it down.

=== Applications of power projection ===
The &quot;Texas National Security Review&quot; projects five scenarios for the global economy:
# Reglobalization as in the 1980s
# Deglobalization away from the trends of the 2000s
# Globalization with Chinese characteristics
# Regional blocs with partially closed trading
# Shared strategic interests and common political values, which Friedberg judges will be the choice of the Western bloc and its direction for power projection.

===Hard power===

Examples of hard power projection include:

* Showing the flag: the symbolic deployment of military forces to a region for the purposes of demonstrating political interest, resolve, or willingness to take more forceful military action.
* Compulsion/deterrence: the use of the threat of military force against another state to either induce it into or dissuade it from pursuing a given policy. In this form, power projection acts as a diplomatic tool, attempting to influence the decision-making process of foreign actors. &quot;See Power projection#Gray zone competition for context&quot;
* Punishment: the punitive use of force against another state in response to their pursuit of a given policy.
* Armed intervention: the movement of military forces into another nation&#x27;s territory for the purposes of influencing the internal affairs of the target country short of outright conquest.
* Conquest: the offensive use of military assets to forcibly occupy territory controlled or claimed by another state. In 2022 Michael Kofman projected that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would be eastward via Donbas, northward from Crimea, and up the Dnieper river to encircle Ukraine&#x27;s capital Kyiv, with a political takeover of Ukraine a likely objective of Russian leadership. However, in lieu of a political takeover, a decapitation strike is a possible tactic. Alexander Vindman has projected a path for Ukraine to retake Crimea. By 5 April 2023 Ukraine signalled that it might entertain talks with Russia if the Ukrainian counteroffensive reached the border of Crimea.

<text>James Ballantine (11 June 1806 – 18 December 1877) was a Scottish artist and author, known for his stained-glass windows and poetry.

== Early life and education ==
James Ballantine was born on 11 June 1806 in West Port, Edinburgh. His father was a brewer who died when he was 10. He received little education and what he did know came from his mother or being self-taught. In his early teens he was apprenticed to a house painter in Edinburgh. 

Aged 20 he went to the University of Edinburgh. 

==Glass painting==
After graduating, Ballantine turned his attention to the art of painting on glass. He quickly achieved high eminence in his field with his business Ballantine and Allan, and got the contract for painting the windows of the House of Lords through a public competition. 

His 1845 book &quot;A treatise of Stained Glass&quot; became a standard work.

His son, Alexander (1841–1906), later joined his stained-glass window business.

His works of stained glass included:
*House of Lords, London
*Main hall at Dunoon Burgh Hall
*St John&#x27;s Kirk, Perth 

==Writing==
Ballantine started writing poetry at a young age and through the popular &quot;Gaberlunzie&#x27;s Wallet&quot; (1842) became an established writer. He wrote poetry books and also a collection of his songs. 

==Death==
He died on 18 December 1877 from a &quot;congestion of the lungs&quot; in Warrender Lodge, Meadows, Edinburgh.

<doc id="931175" wikidata="Q5566669" url="?curid=931175" title="Bernard Barton">
<text>Bernard Barton (31 January 1784 – 19 February 1849) was known as the Quaker poet. His main works included &quot;The Convict&#x27;s Appeal&quot; (1818), in which he protested against the death penalty and the severity of the criminal code.

==Family==
Bernard Barton was born at Carlisle on 31 January 1784, the son of Quaker parents: John Barton (1755–1789) and his wife, Mary, née Done (1752–1784). His mother died, and while the boy was still an infant, his father, a manufacturer, married Elizabeth Horne (1760–1833), moved to London, and then engaged in the malting business at Hertford. After John Barton died, his widow and stepchildren moved to Tottenham. Barton&#x27;s sister was the educational writer Maria Hack and his half-brother John Barton, an economist. He was educated at a Quaker school in Ipswich.

Barton was apprenticed at the age of 14 to a shopkeeper in Halstead, Essex, whose daughter, Lucy Jesup (1781–1808), he married in 1807. His wife died at the end of their first year of marriage, while giving birth to their daughter Lucy. After a year as a tutor in Liverpool, Barton spent the rest of his life at Woodbridge, Suffolk, for the most part as a clerk in Messrs Alexander&#x27;s Bank. He died on 19 February 1849.

==Works and friendships==
Barton became friends with Southey, Lamb, and other men and women of letters, including the local children&#x27;s writer Anne Knight, with whom he lodged, while providing poems for some of her books. His chief works are &quot;The Convict&#x27;s Appeal&quot; published in 1818, a protest against the death penalty and the severity of the criminal code, and &quot;Household Verses&quot; published 1845, which came to the notice of Sir R. Peel, through whom he obtained a pension of £100 a year. Other volumes of his were entitled &quot;Napoleon and Other Poems&quot; (1822), &quot;Poetic Vigils&quot; (1824) and &quot;A New Year&#x27;s Eve and Other Poems&quot;.

Richard Ryan dedicated to Barton his &quot;Poems on Sacred Subjects to which are added several miscellaneous&quot; (1824).

Apart from some hymns, his works are almost forgotten, but he was described as an amiable and estimable man – simple and sympathetic. His best-known hymns are &quot;Lamp of our feet, whereby we trace&quot;, &quot;Walk in the light, so shalt thou know&quot;, &quot;Fear not, Zion&#x27;s sons and daughters&quot;, &quot;Hath the invitation ended?&quot; &quot;See we not beyond the portal?&quot; and &quot;Those who live in love shall know&quot;.

Lucy published a selection of her father&#x27;s poems and letters, to which Edward Fitzgerald, translator of the &quot;Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám&quot; and her future husband, wrote a biographical introduction.

<text>Hellyer College (often stylised as hellyer college) is a government comprehensive senior secondary school located in in north-western Tasmania, Australia. Established in 1976, the college caters for approximately 630 students in Years 11 and 12 and is administered by the Tasmanian Department of Education. Hellyer College is situated on the same campus as the TAFE Tasmania (Burnie Campus) and from the Cradle Coast campus of the University of Tasmania, on Mooreville Road.

Hellyer College is the smallest (in terms of student numbers) college in Tasmania. Hellyer&#x27;s main feeding schools are Wynyard High School, Burnie High School, Parklands High School and several others stretching along the north-west. Students from the west coast in rural areas of Tasmania and King Island also attend Hellyer College and stay at the accommodation provided by the college.

In 2019 student enrolments were 710. The college principal is Shane Cleaver

== History ==

Established in 1976, it provides academic and vocational training to around 850 students from North-West Tasmania, including the West Coast, Circular Head and King Island. Hellyer College was named after Henry Hellyer, who was an explorer in north west Tasmania during the 1820s. In 2009 it became part of the Burnie Campus of the Tasmanian Academy (ex Hellyer College) and Burnie Campus of the Tasmanian Polytechnic (ex TAFE Burnie and Hellyer College).

Prior to 1990, Hellyer College catered for students wanting a university pathway (matriculation), and had between 450 and 500 students. Changes in the Australian unemployment laws and the ways in which students aged between 16-18 were able to obtain financial support meant the College began to offer a more comprehensive curriculum, including VET (Vocational Education and Training), to fit the broader range of students continuing on to years 11 and 12. Because of this and the high youth unemployment rate on the North West Coast of Tasmania, the student numbers at Hellyer College grew rapidly reaching a peak of around 1000 in 1995. The College now offers a range of subjects and courses, a student support program, a range of extra-curricular activities, and strong links into the local community.

In 2018, the Autism Specific Early Learning &amp; Care Centre located on the grounds of the Hellyer College campus relocated into the CBD of Burnie. This move resulted in Hellyer College incorporating the building into their existing campus, being renamed to &quot;R Block&quot;. The same year, the Hellyer Regional Collective was established with the aims to streamline education on the North West coast. Schools in the collective are Hellyer College, Penguin District School, Smithton High School, King Island High School, Mountain Heights High School, Roseberry High School, Wynyard High School, Yolla District High School, Burnie High School, and Parklands High School.

2020 saw the first major renovations at the school, with the math and science facilities receiving $3.5 million in funding to refurbish the 43-year-old facilities. This including a revamp of the science labs, math classrooms, student study areas, and teacher offices. The space was officially opened in August 2020.

== Line system ==

Hellyer College uses a time tabling system called lines. There are five lines; to each line students can assign one class. On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays lines 1, 2 and 3 are done. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, lines 4 and 5 are done. Typically Year 11 and 12 students take four subjects, leaving one free line for study.

== Notable alumni ==
* Cameron Baird – Australian soldier, posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for actions in Afghanistan
* Eddie Jones – head coach of the English national rugby union team since 2015; former coach of the Wallabies

<text>Thomas Spencer Baynes (24 March 1823 – 31 May 1887) was an English writer and scholar. He was best known for serving as the Editor-in-Chief of &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. He was also well known for his essays in the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; and &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot;.

==Life==
Baynes was born in Wellington, Somerset to a Baptist minister. He intended to study for Baptist ministry, and was at a theological seminary at Bath with that view but, being strongly attracted to philosophical studies, left it and went to Edinburgh, where he became the favourite pupil of Sir William Hamilton, of whose philosophical system he continued an adherent.

After working as editor of a newspaper in Edinburgh, and after an interval of rest rendered necessary by a breakdown in health, Baynes resumed journalistic work in 1858 as assistant editor of the &quot;Daily News&quot;. In 1864 he was appointed Professor of Logic and English Literature at St Andrews University, in which capacity his mind was drawn to the study of Shakespeare, and he contributed to the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; and &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot; valuable papers (chiefly relating to his vocabulary and the extent of his learning) afterwards collected as &quot;Shakespeare Studies&quot;.

In 1873, he was appointed to superintend the ninth edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, a task with which, after 1880, he was assisted by William Robertson Smith. Baynes was the first English-born editor of the &quot;Britannica&quot;; all earlier editors were Scottish.

<text>Ada Ellen Bayly (25 March 1857 – 8 February 1903), also known as Edna Lyall, was an English novelist, who &quot;supported the women&#x27;s suffrage movement from an early age.&quot;

==Biography==
Bayly was born in Brighton, the youngest of four children of a barrister. Early in life she lost both her parents, so that she spent her youth with an uncle in Surrey and in a Brighton private school. Bayly never married. She seems to have spent her adult life living with her two married sisters and her brother, a clergyman in Bosbury, Herefordshire.

In 1879, she published her first novel, &quot;Won by Waiting&quot;, under the pseudonym &quot;Edna Lyall&quot; (apparently derived from transposing letters from Ada Ellen Bayly). The book was not a success. Success came with &quot;We Two&quot;, based on the life of Charles Bradlaugh, a social reformer and advocate of free thought. Her historical novel &quot;In the Golden Days&quot; was the last book read to John Ruskin on his deathbed; while &quot;Hope the Hermit&quot; was a bestseller set in the Lake District and later an inspiration for Hugh Walpole&#x27;s &quot;Rogue Herries&quot;. &quot;To Right the Wrong&quot; (2nd ed. 1894) is a historical novel about John Hampden and the English Civil War.

Bayly wrote in all eighteen novels, many of them offering interesting explorations of the writer&#x27;s creative process. Part of her success was due to her practice of using characters from one novel in a different capacity in her next.

<text>Thomas Haynes Bayly (13 October 1797 – 22 April 1839) was an English poet, songwriter, dramatist and writer.

==Life==
Bayly was born in Bath on 13 October 1797, the only child of Nathaniel Bayly, an influential citizen of Bath: he was related through his mother to the Earls of Stamford and Warrington and the Baroness le Despencer. He displayed a talent for verse from a young age, and in his eighth year was found dramatising a tale out of one of his story-books. He attended Winchester School, where he produced a weekly newspaper which recorded the proceedings of the master and pupils in the school. At the age of 17 he began working at his father&#x27;s office for the purpose of studying the law, but soon devoted himself to writing humorous articles for the public journals, and produced a small volume entitled &quot;Rough Sketches of Bath&quot;. He studied at St Mary Hall, Oxford with the intention of joining the church, but it is reported that &quot;he did not apply himself to the pursuit of academical honours&quot; and left university after three years. Bayly travelled in Scotland, and afterwards visited Dublin, where he distinguished himself in private theatricals and achieved his earliest successes as a ballad writer.

Bayly returned to London in January 1824 and married the daughter of Mr. Benjamin Hayes, of Marble Hill, County Cork in 1826. The profits from his literary works were considerable, and his income was increased by his wife&#x27;s dowry.

While the young couple were staying in Bitterne, Hampshire, Bayly wrote the song &quot;I&#x27;d Be a Butterfly&quot;, which became immediately popular. Not long afterwards he produced a three-volume novel, &quot;The Aylmers&quot;; a second tale, &quot;A Legend of Killarney&quot;, written during a visit to that part of Ireland; and numerous songs and ballads, which appeared in two volumes, named respectively &quot;Loves of the Butterflies&quot; and &quot;Songs of the Old Château&quot;.

After relocating from Bath to London, Bayly dedicated his time to writing ballads and pieces for the stage. The play &quot;Perfection&quot;, written during a journey by stagecoach from Bath to London and now regarded as his best dramatic work, was declined by many theatrical managers, but ultimately Madame Vestris produced it and appeared in it. Lord Chesterfield, who was present on the first night, declared that he never saw a better farce. The play became a great favourite at private theatricals, and on one occasion it was produced with a cast including the Marchioness of Londonderry and Lord Castlereagh.

By 1831 Bayly and his wife were experiencing financial difficulties. He had invested his wife&#x27;s dowry in coal mines, which proved unproductive. The agent who managed Mrs. Bayly&#x27;s property in Ireland failed to provide satisfactory accounts. A replacement agent ultimately made the property pay, but these financial difficulties, combined with poor physical health, had a detrimental effect on Bayly&#x27;s creativity. During a trip to France to convalesce, he was able to recover sufficiently to write the poem &quot;The Bridesmaid&quot;, which drew a flattering letter from Sir Robert Peel.

Bayly regained his productivity, and in a short time he wrote thirty-six dramatic pieces. However, By 1837 he had begun to suffer from a range of serious medical conditions. His novel &quot;Weeds of Witchery&quot;, published that year, led a French critic to describe him as the Anacreon of English romance. In the same year he wrote &quot;Kindness in Women&quot;, a three-volume collection consisting of a double novel &quot;Kate Leslie&quot; and an independent tale &quot;David Dumps, Or, The Budget of Blunders&quot;. They were published by Richard Bentley. He developed dropsy and jaundice, and he died on 22 April 1839. He was buried at Cheltenham, his epitaph being written by his friend Theodore Hook.

<text>Robert Blair (born 7 August 1981) is a Scottish badminton player.

Blair was born in Scotland, but after attending Loughborough University in Leicestershire, he competed for England from 2001 until 2010, except at the Olympic Games, where Scotland and England are both parts of the Great Britain and Northern Ireland team. His main motivation for changing nation was the prospect of medals at the Commonwealth Games.

On 16 December 2010 Badminton England and Badminton Scotland announced that Blair would be returning to Scotland. The reason(s) for Blair&#x27;s return to Scotland remain unclear, but reports suggest a falling-out with members of the Badminton England setup was central to the decision.

==Career==
Blair competed in badminton at the 2004 Summer Olympics in mixed doubles with partner Natalie Munt. They defeated Tadashi Ohtsuka and Shizuka Yamamoto of Japan in the first round but lost to Nova Widianto and Vita Marissa of Indonesia in the round of 16.

Blair reached the men&#x27;s doubles final at the 2006 IBF World Championships together with Anthony Clark, losing the final against Cai Yun and Fu Haifeng.

<doc id="931205" wikidata="Q2303554" url="?curid=931205" title="Star Ocean">
<text>is a franchise of science fantasy role-playing video games developed by the Japanese company tri-Ace and published by Square Enix (formerly Enix).

==Development==
===History===
&quot;Star Ocean&quot; is known as one of the earliest real-time RPGs to allow players to alter the storyline&#x27;s outcome through the player&#x27;s actions and dialogue choices, mainly through a social relationship system referred to as &quot;private actions&quot;. The original &quot;Star Ocean&quot;, published by Enix in 1996 and developed by tri-Ace, introduced a &quot;private actions&quot; social system, where the protagonist&#x27;s relationship points with the other characters are affected by the player&#x27;s choices, which in turn affects the storyline, leading to branching paths and multiple different endings. This was expanded in its 1999 sequel, &quot;Star Ocean: The Second Story&quot;, which boasted as many as 86 different endings, with each of the possible permutations to these endings numbering in the hundreds, setting a benchmark for the number of outcomes possible for a video game. Using a relationship system inspired by dating sims, each of the characters had friendship points and relationship points with each of the other characters, allowing the player to pair together, or ship, any couples (both romantic heterosexual relationships as well as friendships) of their choice. The relationship system in &quot;Star Ocean&quot;, however, not only affected the storyline, but also the gameplay, affecting the way the characters behave towards each other in battle.

===Creation and design===
As fans of science fiction and space travel, the developers at tri-Ace created the &quot;Star Ocean&quot; series with a sci-fi setting in mind and have cited &quot;Star Trek&quot; as one of their main influences for the visuals of the games as well as being an underlying, but noticeable, influence to the series as a whole. While the first &quot;Star Ocean&quot; game included more fantasy elements to appeal to a broad audience, subsequent installments naturally moved towards a more sci-fi oriented feel, with &quot;Star Ocean: Till the End of Time&quot; described by its producer Yoshinori Yamagishi as tri-Ace&#x27;s &quot;ultimate vision&quot; of the &quot;whole &quot;Star Ocean&quot; world&quot;. The large gap of time between &quot;Star Ocean: The Second Story&quot; and &quot;Till the End of Time&quot;, in terms of in-universe chronology, can be explained by the series&#x27; choice to emphasize the setting of its fictional world rather than focus on its characters. In &quot;Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness&quot;, producer Shuichi Kobayashi noted that one of the game series most important themes is first contact between two different societies and planets.

==Games==
The first game in the series was simply titled Star Ocean. It was released on July 19, 1996 for the Super Famicom and never released outside Japan, but was unofficially translated into English through ROM hacking by DeJap Translations, and the resulting game can be played through emulation. It established the series&#x27; staples, including the futuristic setting, real-time battle system, item creation, and private actions. It takes place in 346 SD, and follows the adventures of Roddick Farrence as he searches for a cure for a sickness on his planet with the help of two Earthlings. An enhanced remake entitled Star Ocean: First Departure was released for the PlayStation Portable on December 27, 2007 in Japan, and in North America and Europe in October 2008. The game was remade using &quot;Star Ocean 2&quot;″s engine, adopting prerendered backgrounds and 3D battlefields, as well as new character art and animated cut-scenes provided by Production I.G, and fully voiced dialogue. There are also new playable characters.

Star Ocean: The Second Story was released for the PlayStation on July 30, 1998, in Japan, May 31, 1999, in North America, and April 12, 2000, in Europe. It retains the features of its predecessor while introducing prerendered backgrounds, full motion videos, and 3D battlefields. Taking place in 366 SD, it features a new cast of characters, including Claude C. Kenny, the son of Ronyx J. Kenny from the original &quot;Star Ocean&quot;, and Rena Lanford, who both investigate the Sorcery Globe, which has landed on Planet Expel and has been causing disasters ever since. An enhanced port entitled Star Ocean: Second Evolution was released for the PlayStation Portable on April 2, 2008, in Japan, January 20, 2009, in North America, and in Australia and Europe in the following month. It features similar enhancements, including fully voiced dialogue, new playable characters, and new character artwork and animated cut-scenes provided by Production I.G.

Star Ocean: Blue Sphere is a direct sequel to &quot;The Second Story&quot;, released for the Game Boy Color on June 28, 2001, in Japan (a North American version was planned but canceled). &quot;Blue Sphere&quot; adapts the &quot;Star Ocean&quot; series to hand-helds altering several aspects in the process, including interactive item creation, auto private actions, 2D side scrolling battles, Field Actions, and the removal of random battles. It takes place in 368 SD, two years after &quot;The Second Story&quot;, and features the return of all twelve main characters as they attempt to solve the mystery of the Planet Edifice and its destructive nature that eradicates the planet&#x27;s civilizations every 200 years. In 2008 it received a Japanese-only remake for mobile devices with new graphics, new controls, and a retooled battle system.

Star Ocean: Till the End of Time was released for the PlayStation 2 in Japan in 2003. A director&#x27;s cut of the game with bonus dungeons, new playable characters, a versus mode, and tweaked gameplay was released in 2004, and that version was brought to North America and Europe the same year. &quot;Till the End of Time&quot; is the first fully 3D game in the series and features fully voiced dialogue. It retains most aspects of the previous games with new features, such as the fury and bonus battle gauge, as well as the ability to patent items created during item creation and recruiting inventors to create items for the player. The game takes place nearly 400 years after the last &quot;Blue Sphere&quot;, in 772 SD. Fayt Leingod is the main character, and after finding himself separated from his family during an alien attack on a resort planet, is pursued by the same Vendeeni forces across space for reasons beyond his imagination.

Star Ocean: The Last Hope was released for the Xbox 360 in February 2009 for Japan and North America, and in June of the same year for Australia and Europe. It was also released for the PlayStation 3 worldwide in February 2010. It is a prequel to the entire series, chronicling the aftermath of World War III in which humanity must find a new home to survive. The protagonist is a young man named Edge Maverick who is accompanied by his childhood friend Reimi Saionji.

Star Ocean: Material Trader is a free-to-play card and item creation RPG developed by Hippos Lab and published by Square Enix for the GREE mobile phone social network in 2013. GREE and Square Enix has terminated the service as of February 2014, and the application has since been delisted.

Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness was released for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2016. The story takes place between &quot;Star Ocean: The Second Story&quot; and &quot;Star Ocean: Till the End of Time&quot;, in 537 SD.

Star Ocean: Anamnesis is a free-to-play role-playing game featuring three-dimensional characters and environments. Players could participate in real-time battles against enemies that supported up to four players. It was released in Japan on December 7, 2016, and later worldwide in July 2018 for Android and iOS devices. Both the global and Japanese versions were terminated in 2019 and 2021, respectively.

Star Ocean: The Divine Force was released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam on October 27, 2022. The game features two protagonists and a story that changes based on player&#x27;s choices. Akira Yasuda, also known as Akiman, returned as character designer from &quot;Integrity and Faithlessness&quot; and &quot;Anamnesis&quot;.

=== North American releases ===
Of the seven games in the series, six have been released outside Japan. &quot;Star Ocean: The Second Story&quot; was the first game to be published in the USA, by Sony Computer Entertainment America.

With the PlayStation 2&#x27;s installment, &quot;Star Ocean: Till the End of Time&quot;, Square Enix hoped to attract more gamers, especially in the United States, where the franchise has not been very popular. The Director&#x27;s Cut 2-disc version of &quot;Star Ocean: Till the End of Time&quot; has been released in North America, with more playable characters, more games and additional storyline tangents. As of July 2005, &quot;Star Ocean: Till the End of Time&quot; is a part of Sony&#x27;s Greatest Hits line, indicating that the game had done reasonably well in North America.

In 2008, Square Enix released an enhanced remake of the original &quot;Star Ocean&quot; title for the PlayStation Portable called &quot;Star Ocean: First Departure&quot;. This was followed in 2009 by an enhanced port of &quot;Star Ocean: The Second Story&quot; for the PlayStation Portable called &quot;Star Ocean: Second Evolution&quot;.

&quot;Star Ocean: The Last Hope&quot; was released in North America within one week of its Japanese release on Xbox 360. An enhanced version called &quot;Star Ocean: The Last Hope International&quot; edition was later released as a PS3 exclusive worldwide in the first quarter of 2010. This port included the Japanese audio, new character portraits, as well as a few other new features exclusive to that version. &quot;Star Ocean: The Last Hope&quot; is also available on Steam as 4K &amp; Full HD remaster.

&quot;Star Ocean: Blue Sphere&quot; remains the only game in the series not released outside Japan in any form.

==Common elements==
The characters of the series were designed to be &quot;action-figure-like&quot;. A feature adjusting the characters&#x27; appearance when changing their equipment was considered for the series but ultimately was scrapped because of the large number of characters to design. In the later installment of &quot;Star Ocean: The Last Hope&quot; the appearance of the characters did in fact change to reflect the type of weapon they were using.

Another recurring gameplay feature is that many of the branching story choices and different endings are not easily accessible, as things like &quot;affection points&quot; are not exposed to the player. This has proven both frustrating to some players who feel they are missing out on choices they didn&#x27;t know about, but for others it opens up further replay ability as newly discovered choices will yield a new story.

&quot;Star Ocean&quot; games also take an all-encompassing approach to items. Party members can create new objects or improve existing ones through crafts like metalworking, alchemy, writing, painting and cooking. The strongest items and equipment are usually only available via Item Creation, and many others can be sold for a profit or provide other benefits (books can be used to transfer skills and abilities; cooked foods can be used to circumvent the 20-of-each-item inventory limit), placing great importance on Item Creation.

&quot;Star Ocean&quot; games are known for their real-time battle engines, and, for being one of the first of its kind to come to the consoles. Battles take place on a separate screen, but all characters (rather than waiting in one spot and taking damage) are fully mobile in three dimensions, can dodge and chase foes, and must cast their spells and deploy attacks despite enemy harassment. In the earlier games, magicians had spells, whereas fighters had special physical attacks called &quot;Killer Moves&quot;; both are learned after passing certain level requirements (or through specific items and sidequests) and cost HP or MP to use. In &quot;Star Ocean: Till the End of Time&quot;, all the characters are able to use spells and battle skills (i.e. killer moves).

==Music==
The first &quot;Star Ocean&quot; was composed by Motoi Sakuraba, and included orchestral samples, including flutes, and even included digitized battle cries during combat. Motoi composed and arranged the scores for &quot;Star Ocean&quot; and &quot;First Departure&quot;. Critics praised Sakuraba&#x27;s progressive rock style, and highlighted his musical experimentation throughout the original &quot;Star Ocean&quot; score and &quot;First Departure&quot;. Tracks added from &quot;Star Ocean: The Second Story&quot; received mixed reviews on the &quot;First Departure&quot; album, adding some familiar &quot;Star Ocean&quot; themes but also some lesser known songs to the mix. Several musical pieces were missing from the original album and were added to the remake&#x27;s release. The &quot;First Departure&quot; remake features the theme song &quot;Heart&quot; performed by Japanese music group Asunaro, which accompanied the game&#x27;s opening animation as well as the end credits, and was included in that version&#x27;s official soundtrack in 2008. This theme was replaced for the &quot;First Departure R&quot; release with the song by Yauchi Keiko of Shadow of Laffandor.

The music of &quot;Star Ocean: Blue Sphere&quot; was composed by regular series composer Motoi Sakuraba, who created the soundtrack on a PC-9801. Composing for the Game Boy Color presented multiple limitations in cord numbers and quality. The battle theme, &quot;Hand to Hand&quot;, was a track Sakuraba particularly remembered, as he tried to capture the momentum of battle despite the limited hardware. Motoi composed the music for &quot;Star Ocean: Till the End of Time&quot;. The soundtrack was eventually released in four parts. The limited edition of Volume 1 also came with box to hold all four albums. When the game was revised into the Director&#x27;s Cut, Sakuraba composed a few new pieces of music and released an album for them. The song &quot;The Small Bird That Forgot How To Fly&quot; (飛び方を忘れた小さな鳥, &quot;Tobikata Wo Wasureta Chiisana Tori&quot;) by the JPop singer Misia was used to accompany the game&#x27;s ending credits. Motoi composed the music for &quot;Star Ocean: The Last Hope&quot;. The soundtrack was released in two parts: &quot;Star Ocean: The Last Hope Original Soundtrack&quot;, a 3-CD set containing all the music tracks in the game, with a total of 71 tracks. It also contains a DVD extra of an interview with Sakuraba himself, plus video footage of his workshop and some original music performed by him. The other is &quot;Star Ocean: The Last Hope Arrange Soundtrack&quot;, a selection of tracks from the original soundtrack performed in different remixes. Sakuraba is a &quot;series mainstay&quot;, and included a &quot;synth-rock&quot; soundtrack in &quot;Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness&quot;. As with the other games in the &quot;Star Ocean&quot; series, &quot;Star Ocean: Anamnesis&quot; soundtrack was composed by Motoi Sakuraba.

==Manga and anime==

There was an incomplete manga series by Mayumi Azuma based on &quot;Star Ocean: The Second Story&quot;, which became a similarly incomplete anime series &quot;Star Ocean EX&quot;. The anime series saw release by Geneon Entertainment in the United States. The anime features 26 episodes covering events that happened on the first disc of the PlayStation game. The show was continued on drama CDs afterward.

==Reception==
By 2013, the game series had shipped over 4.2 million copies. In a 2009 retro review, &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; praised &quot;Star Ocean&quot; technical aspects calling it &quot;one of the best-looking Super Nintendo games ever created&quot; and that the soundtrack &quot;never ceases to amaze&quot;. &quot;Famitsu&quot; reviewed &quot;Star Ocean: The First Departure&quot;, a remake of the original &quot;Star Ocean&quot;, saying the title&#x27;s animation and characters were well done and the story was &quot;charming&quot; though they lamented that players could only save their progress at certain points such as the world map, which they also felt was too large and had a limited field of view. &quot;Star Ocean: The Second Story&quot; is one of the most popular games of the series. While most reviewers gave positive reviews, some considered the game only mediocre. Jeff Lundrigan, reviewing the PlayStation version of the game for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, wrote that the game has its pluses and minuses, but ultimately called it &quot;average&quot; in his review. &quot;Star Ocean: Blue Sphere&quot;″s popularity in Japan, primarily for its story and gameplay systems, prompted tri-Ace to remake it for mobile devices. The remake included redrawn graphics and a remastered soundtrack.

Initially, &quot;Star Ocean: Till the End of Time&quot; received a somewhat negative impression in Japan. Parts of the game were alleged to be buggy, and the game refused to work at all in older SCPH-10000 PlayStation 2s. Enix blamed Sony, as they had coded &quot;Star Ocean 3&quot; with features from updated libraries that were apparently not backward-compatible. &quot;Star Ocean: The Last Hope&quot; was reviewed by &quot;IGN&quot; which stated that despite the rough pacing in the storyline that could be told in a much more engaging manner, tri-Ace and Square Enix&#x27;s latest RPG holds together quite well with action-packed gameplay. One of the small annoyances encountered during the game is the disc-swapping, which requires players to switch discs if they need to travel between planets later in the game.

&quot;Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness&quot; was noted by &quot;IGN&quot; for having graphics that varied widely in quality, from very high quality to &quot;Minecraft&quot; and noting there were no cutscenes, so the acting had less emotional impact. They did, however, praise the game&#x27;s score and cast of characters. &quot;Star Ocean: Anamnesis&quot; was described by &quot;Kotaku&quot; as &quot;exploitative but charming&quot;, praising the game&#x27;s use of nostalgia, but abhorring the &quot;blandness&quot; of its free to play formula.

<text>James Beresford (28 May 1764 – 29 September 1840) was a writer and clergyman. He was born in Upham in Hampshire and educated at Charterhouse School and became a fellow of Merton College, Oxford. He made translations and wrote religious books, but was chiefly known as the author of a satirical work, &quot;The Miseries of Human Life&quot;, considered to be a &quot;minor classic in the genre&quot;. Beresford also wrote under the pseudonyms An Aspirant, Ignato Secudno, Samuel Sensitive and Timothy Testy. He was rector of Kibworth from 1812 until his death.

<text>My Chemical Romance is an American rock band from New Jersey. The band&#x27;s current lineup consists of lead vocalist Gerard Way, lead guitarist Ray Toro, rhythm guitarist Frank Iero, and bassist Mikey Way. They are considered one of the most influential rock groups of the 2000s and a major act in the pop-punk and emo genres, despite the band rejecting the latter label.

Formed in September 2001 by Gerard, Mikey, Toro, and drummer Matt Pelissier (and later joined by Iero), the band signed with Eyeball Records and released their debut album, &quot;I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love&quot;, in 2002. They signed with Reprise Records the next year and released their major-label debut, &quot;Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge&quot;, in 2004. Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, Pelissier was replaced by Bob Bryar. The album was a commercial success, attaining platinum status over a year later.

The success of the band&#x27;s previous albums was eclipsed by that of their 2006 rock opera concept album, &quot;The Black Parade&quot;. A major commercial success, its lead single &quot;Welcome to the Black Parade&quot; topped the UK singles chart. The album solidified the band&#x27;s following, despite negative coverage in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; generating controversy. The band&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys&quot;, was released in 2010. Bryar departed the band prior to the release of the album, and in 2012, they added touring keyboardist James Dewees. In 2012 and 2013, the band released a series of singles they had recorded in 2009 under the collective title &quot;Conventional Weapons&quot;. My Chemical Romance announced its breakup on March 22, 2013. In 2014, a greatest hits album titled &quot;May Death Never Stop You&quot; was released and a tenth-anniversary reissue of &quot;The Black Parade&quot; was released in 2016.

On October 31, 2019, the band announced a reunion show, which took place in Los Angeles on December 20, 2019. In January 2020, they announced additional shows and a Reunion Tour, which commenced in 2022 after a two-year postponement due to the COVID-19 pandemic and concluded in early 2023.
==History==

=== 2001–2002: Formation and &quot;I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love&quot; ===
The band was formed by vocalist Gerard Way and drummer Matt Pelissier in New Jersey, soon after the September 11 attacks. Witnessing the World Trade Center towers fall influenced Way&#x27;s life to the extent that he decided to start a band. Shortly thereafter, Ray Toro was recruited as the band&#x27;s guitarist because at the time Way could not sing and play the guitar simultaneously. Way has said, &quot;Music was this thing I secretly wanted to do&quot;, and later wrote the song &quot;Skylines and Turnstiles&quot; to express his feelings about September 11.

The name of the band was suggested by bass guitarist Mikey Way, younger brother of Gerard, who was working in a Barnes &amp; Noble when he was struck by the title of a book by Irvine Welsh named &quot;&quot;. The first recording sessions were undertaken in Pelissier&#x27;s attic, where the songs &quot;Our Lady of Sorrows&quot; and &quot;Cubicles&quot; were recorded. The band refers to those sessions as &quot;The Attic Demos&quot;. After hearing the demo and dropping out of college, Mikey Way decided to join the band. While with Eyeball Records, the band met Frank Iero, the lead vocalist and guitarist for Pencey Prep. Following Pencey Prep&#x27;s split in 2002, Iero became a member of My Chemical Romance, just days before the recording of the band&#x27;s debut album.

They recorded their debut album, &quot;I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love&quot;, just three months after the formation of the band and released it in 2002 through Eyeball Records. The album was produced by Thursday frontman Geoff Rickly after the band became friends with him while playing shows in New Jersey. Iero played guitar on two of the tracks, one of which was &quot;Early Sunsets Over Monroeville&quot;. During this time, the band was booked at the infamous venue Big Daddy&#x27;s, where it began to receive more attention. The album produced three singles, &quot;Vampires Will Never Hurt You&quot;, &quot;Honey, This Mirror Isn&#x27;t Big Enough for the Two of Us&quot;, and &quot;Headfirst for Halos&quot;. My Chemical Romance offered free downloads through PureVolume and the social networking website MySpace, where they gained an initial fan base.

=== 2003–2006: Major label signing and &quot;Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge&quot; ===

On August 31, 2003, the band announced via their website that they had signed a deal with Reprise Records. The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge&quot;, was released on June 8, 2004. A month after the album&#x27;s release, the band replaced Matt Pelissier with Bob Bryar. The band released four singles from the album: &quot;I&#x27;m Not Okay (I Promise)&quot;, &quot;Thank You for the Venom&quot;, &quot;Helena&quot;, and &quot;The Ghost of You&quot;. The album went platinum in just over a year after its release.

At the beginning of 2005, the band was featured on the first Taste of Chaos tour along with The Used and Killswitch Engage. The band also was the opening act for Green Day on their &quot;American Idiot&quot; tour. They then co-headlined Warped Tour 2005 with Fall Out Boy and co-headlined a tour with Alkaline Trio and Reggie and the Full Effect around the US. That same year, My Chemical Romance collaborated with The Used for a cover of the Queen and David Bowie song, &quot;Under Pressure&quot;, which was released as a benefit single for tsunami relief on iTunes and other Internet outlets.

In March 2006, the album &quot;Life on the Murder Scene&quot; was released, incorporating a CD and two DVDs. It included one documentary DVD chronicling the band&#x27;s history, and a second DVD with music videos, the making of their videos and live performances. An unauthorized biography DVD &quot;Things That Make You Go MMM!&quot; was also released in June 2006. The DVD does not actually feature any My Chemical Romance music clips or performances but contains interviews with those who knew the band before much of their fame. A biography titled &quot;Something Incredible This Way Comes&quot; was also released, written by Paul Stenning and published in 2006. It features information on their beginnings right through to their third album, &quot;The Black Parade&quot;.

=== 2006–2009: &quot;The Black Parade&quot; ===
My Chemical Romance started recording their third studio album on April 10, 2006, with Rob Cavallo, producer of many of Green Day&#x27;s albums.

On August 3, 2006, the band completed shooting the videos for their first two singles from the album, &quot;Welcome to the Black Parade&quot; and although not released until January 2007, &quot;Famous Last Words&quot;. Both videos were directed by Samuel Bayer, director of Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; and Green Day&#x27;s &quot;American Idiot&quot; videos. During filming for the second video, band members Gerard Way and Bob Bryar were injured. Way suffered torn ligaments in his ankle, and Bryar suffered third-degree burns on his hands and legs. Consequently, the band was forced to cancel a few tour dates.

On August 22, 2006, the band played a special one-off show at the 1,800-capacity London Hammersmith Palais. The show was sold out in 15 minutes. Later during the show, the album title was confirmed. The band were bottled during a performance at the Reading Festival by fans of the band Slayer, who performed before them at the festival; Way later described it as their &quot;greatest victory as a show&quot;.
&quot;Welcome to the Black Parade&quot; was released as a single on September 11, 2006. A music video for the song, directed by Samuel Bayer and starring Lukas Haas as &quot;The Patient&quot;, was released later the same month. The single became the band&#x27;s first number-one on the UK Singles Chart in October 2006. &quot;The Black Parade&quot; was released on October 23, 2006. In the US, &quot;Welcome to the Black Parade&quot; reached number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, making it the band&#x27;s only top ten hit to date on the chart.

&quot;The Black Parade World Tour&quot; started on February 22, 2007, featuring Rise Against and Muse as support acts. Reggie and the Full Effect frontman James Dewees joined the band to play keyboards and synthesizer from there on. In April 2007, it was announced that Mikey Way would temporarily leave the tour to spend time with his new wife, Alicia Simmons-Way. Way&#x27;s temporary replacement was Matt Cortez, a friend of the band. During the third leg of the tour, as a support act for Muse, members of My Chemical Romance and their crew, along with members of Muse&#x27;s crew, suffered food poisoning, and consequently had to cancel shows. The band later featured on Linkin Park&#x27;s &quot;Projekt Revolution&quot; tour in 2007, along with Placebo, Mindless Self Indulgence, Saosin, Taking Back Sunday and HIM.

My Chemical Romance received a range of accolades for &quot;The Black Parade&quot;. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; rated &quot;The Black Parade&quot; as the fourth-greatest album of 2006. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s ranking of the top 50 albums of 2006, &quot;The Black Parade&quot; was voted the 20th best album of the year, and 361th on their top 500 albums of all time. My Chemical Romance went on to win the award for Best International Band at the 2007 NME Awards, and Gerard Way also won the Hero of the Year award. My Chemical Romance was also nominated for Best Alternative Group at the 2007 American Music Awards.
In 2008, the band released a live DVD/CD collection titled &quot;The Black Parade Is Dead!&quot;, which includes two concerts from October 2007, the final Black Parade concert in Mexico, and a small show at Maxwell&#x27;s in New Jersey. The DVD/CD was meant to be released on June 24 in the United States and June 30 in the UK, but was postponed to July 1 because of a technical fault with the Mexico concert. In 2009, an EP of B-sides from &quot;The Black Parade&quot; was released, titled &quot;The Black Parade: The B-Sides&quot;. The band then announced that they would be releasing &quot;a collection of nine never-before-seen live videos, straight from the encore set of the Mexico City show from October 2007&quot; during their Black Parade World Tour, titled &quot;¡Venganza!&quot;. The release came on a bullet-shaped flash drive. It was released on April 10, 2009.

==== &quot;Daily Mail&quot; controversy ====
British tabloid &quot;Daily Mail&quot; characterised the band and their fans as &quot;emo&quot; and a &quot;cult of self-harm&quot; in 2006. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described My Chemical Romance&#x27;s perceived association with emo originated from &quot;Iero&#x27;s appearance, their debut being produced by a member of Thursday, and the band members&#x27; openness about their mental-health issues&quot; while acknowledging major stylistic differences between emo and My Chemical Romance&#x27;s music. The band disputed their association with emo and the characterisation of their music as dangerous, comparing it to controversies surrounding Judas Priest in the 1980s. The media attention, which coincided with the release of &quot;The Black Parade,&quot; is thought to have boosted the band&#x27;s popularity in the UK.

On May 16, 2008, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; published an article titled &quot;Why no child is safe from the sinister cult of emo&quot;. It discussed the suicide of a thirteen-year-old British girl named Hannah Bond, who supposedly took her life because of her involvement in an &quot;emo cult&quot; which the newspaper directly associated with My Chemical Romance and their fans, and their then-current album &quot;The Black Parade&quot;. The basis for the article was a statement by coroner Roger Sykes from the investigation into Bond&#x27;s death, who expressed concern that her &quot;emo&quot; lifestyle glamorized suicide and suggested that her obsession with My Chemical Romance was linked to her death. The &quot;Mail&quot; followed this with several stories also describing the band and emo as a &quot;sinister cult&quot; and &quot;dangerous&quot;. Supporters of emo music contacted &quot;NME&quot; to defend the genre against accusations that it promotes suicide. The band responded by paying tribute to Bond, saying that their music is &quot;anti-violence and anti-suicide&quot; and aiming to provide comfort and solace to fans, and encouraged fans experiencing feelings of depression or suicide to seek help.

A group of British fans eventually planned a march across London in protest against the depiction of the band in the media. The march was expected to be held on May 31, beginning at Hyde Park&#x27;s West Pond and ending outside the offices of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. The march was expected to attract 500–1,000 protesters, according to the organizers. After concerns by police, the march was called off and instead about 100 fans congregated at Marble Arch.

&quot;The Daily Mail&quot; defended its position saying its coverage was &quot;balanced and restrained&quot; and &quot;in the public interest&quot; and that they were reporting genuine concerns raised by the coroner at the inquest. They stated that their coverage of the coroner&#x27;s remarks and the parents&#x27; comments was in common with that of other newspapers and pointed to their publishing of readers&#x27; letters defending the band and positive reviews of the band&#x27;s albums and tours. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; later described the original story as having a &quot;heavy-handed approach and factual inaccuracies&quot; and demonised the emo subculture. In a 2022 retrospective, &quot;The Guardian&quot; described the backlash against the band and emo music as a &quot;moral panic&quot;.

=== 2009–2011: &quot;Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys&quot; ===

In February 2009, My Chemical Romance released a new single titled &quot;Desolation Row&quot; (a cover of the Bob Dylan song). It was recorded to feature as the end credit track for the 2009 film &quot;Watchmen&quot;, an adaptation of the graphic novel of the same name. While working on the then-upcoming fourth album, the band originally worked with producer Brendan O&#x27;Brien, who has worked with AC/DC, Mastodon, and Pearl Jam.

In an interview with &quot;NME&quot;, Gerard Way said the band&#x27;s next record would be a rock album, saying, &quot;I think [the next album] will definitely be stripped down. I think the band misses being a rock band.&quot; Way also commented that the next release would be less theatrical in scope, stating that &quot;it&#x27;s not going to be hiding behind a veil of fiction or uniforms and makeup anymore.&quot; In an interview with PopEater, Way also stated that the next album will be &quot;full of hate&quot;. He also said &quot;over the years that we&#x27;ve been hearing ourselves live and hearing us on records, we kind of prefer the live. There&#x27;s more of a garage feel and more energy. I&#x27;d like to capture some of that, finally. That&#x27;s the goal for the next one.&quot;

On July 31 and August 1, 2009, My Chemical Romance played two &quot;secret&quot; shows at The Roxy Theater in Los Angeles. The shows were the first concerts the band had played since Madison Square Garden in May 2008. The band also premiered several new songs said to be from their upcoming fourth album during the shows, one reportedly titled &quot;Death Before Disco&quot;, a song that Way said he was particularly excited about. The song was since renamed &quot;Party Poison&quot; and was included on the new album. Way explained further in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview that &quot;it&#x27;s a completely different sound for the band — it&#x27;s like an anti-party song that you can party to. I can&#x27;t wait for people to hear it. It brings back, lyrically, some of that wonderful fiction from the first album.&quot;

Gerard Way also said in a November 2009 interview with &quot;Rock Sound&quot; that the fourth album would be their defining work. &quot;A friend who heard the record recently said he now had no interest in listening to our older work anymore, that we had made all our old material redundant. I took it as a compliment, the next thing you should always make the last thing seem unimportant and I think that will happen when we finally release this album.&quot; On March 3, 2010, Iero announced on their official website that Bob Bryar had left the band, writing:


Since Bryar&#x27;s departure, My Chemical Romance has not had a full time drummer. In a March 2010 MTV interview about the new album, Way explained, &quot;There&#x27;s no title yet ... I&#x27;m actually kind of excited about that. It&#x27;s kind of &#x27;anything goes&#x27; at this point, but I&#x27;m so happy with the songs.&quot; Though the band eventually decided on the title of their fourth album, it continued to go unannounced, with various rumors circulating and the band stating on their website that it will be revealed &quot;all in due time&quot;.

During the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con, Way announced that the band had finished recording the fourth studio album. This was later confirmed by Iero on the band&#x27;s website, announcing that the album was &quot;done, finished, kaput, in the proverbial can, and being played loudly as we drive way too fast in our respective cars.&quot; In September, a trailer video was uploaded to My Chemical Romance&#x27;s official YouTube page titled &quot;Art is a Weapon&quot;, which announced the title of the album: &quot;Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys&quot;. On September 22, 2010, the band premiered their song &quot;Na Na Na (Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na)&quot; on Zane Lowe&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 show, and Los Angeles-based radio station KROQ-FM. The song officially release as a single on September 28. The album was released on November 22, 2010. The second single, &quot;The Only Hope for Me Is You&quot;, was released on October 12, 2010. Some of the other singles from the album include, &quot;Sing&quot;, and &quot;Planetary (Go!)&quot;.
&quot;Rock Sound&quot; had a preview of the album and gave a positive review, commenting &quot;the way they&#x27;ve used everything they learned on &quot;The Black Parade&quot; and tightened up in certain places feels natural and confident&quot; and that it sees &quot;the creativity of the band taking flight musically, graphically and literally.&quot; Michael Pedicone joined the band as a touring drummer late in 2010, replacing Bryar. During a performance at Wembley Arena on February 12, 2011, Way announced that the band would be appearing at a UK festival later in the year. They also performed at Radio 1&#x27;s Big Weekend in Carlisle, England on May 15, 2011.

On September 2, 2011, Frank Iero posted a blog on the band&#x27;s site stating, &quot;The relationship between My Chemical Romance and Michael Pedicone is over&quot; and explaining Pedicone was sacked because &quot;he was caught red-handed stealing from the band and confessed to police after our show last night in Auburn, Washington.&quot; He also mentioned his hope of getting a new drummer in time for their next show and avoiding having to cancel any performances in the process. On September 4, 2011, it was revealed through various sources that Jarrod Alexander will be the new touring drummer for the remainder of the Honda Civic tour.

=== 2011–2013: &quot;Conventional Weapons&quot; and break-up ===

On April 28, 2011, US broadcaster Glenn Beck labelled the My Chemical Romance song &quot;Sing&quot; as &quot;propaganda&quot; after it was featured and covered on the US musical drama TV series &quot;Glee&quot; in February 2011. Beck stated &quot;It&#x27;s an anthem saying &#x27;Join us&#x27;. How can you and I possibly win against that?&quot;
The lyrics that Beck pointed out were: &quot;Cleaned up corporation progress, dying in the process / Children that can talk about it living on the railways / People moving sideways / Sell it till your last days / Buy yourself the motivation / Generation nothing / Nothing but a dead scene / Product of a white dream&quot;. Gerard Way responded to the accusation on the band&#x27;s official website, writing, &quot;I think the word Glenn Beck was looking for was &#x27;subversion&#x27; not &#x27;propaganda&#x27;, because I don&#x27;t know what it would be considered propaganda for—truth? Sentiment?&quot; He also said that he was &quot;shocked that no actual fact-checking was done on the lyrics&quot;. Bassist Mikey Way told the BBC, &quot;If we&#x27;re getting reaction from people like that we&#x27;re doing something right.&quot;

In an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in October 2011, guitarist Frank Iero revealed that new music could be out &quot;by summer&quot;. On December 18, 2011, the band appeared on Nick Jr. Channel&#x27;s &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba!&quot;, and performed a song called &quot;Every Snowflake Is Different (Just Like You)&quot;. This was part of a Christmas special for the show. The special includes other famous guest appearances such as Tony Hawk and Tori Spelling.
In February 2012, members of My Chemical Romance revealed that they had been building a studio in Los Angeles to record music for the band&#x27;s fifth album under the working title MCR5, now with touring keyboardist James Dewees as an official member. The band worked with engineer Doug McKean, who previously worked on &quot;The Black Parade&quot; and &quot;Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys&quot;. In September 2012, the band announced a new project titled &quot;Conventional Weapons&quot;. The project revolved around 10 unreleased songs that were recorded in 2009, prior to the making of &quot;Danger Days&quot;. The band released two songs each month for five months from the &quot;Conventional Weapons sessions&quot;, starting in October 2012 and finishing in February 2013. According to the October 2012 issue of &quot;Q Magazine&quot;, Frank Iero reported early sessions for MCR&#x27;s next album with the new drummer Jarrod Alexander were progressing well. &quot;Jarrod is a rad guy and a fantastic player. It&#x27;s been really fun making music with him these past few months,&quot; Iero commented.

On March 22, 2013, the band announced their break-up on their official website, issuing this statement:

Gerard Way posted an extended tweet on his Twitter account two days after the website announcement, in which he confirmed the disbanding of the group but denied that altercations between band members were the reason for the split.

=== 2013–2019: &quot;May Death Never Stop You&quot; and post-breakup ===

On March 25, 2014, the band released a greatest hits collection, titled &quot;May Death Never Stop You&quot;, containing material spanning their entire career, as well a single unreleased track. The track &quot;Fake Your Death&quot; was made available digitally on February 17. It is the only song in MCR&#x27;s discography having James Dewees playing on keyboards.

Following the band&#x27;s breakup, the members of the band continued to pursue music. Lead vocalist Gerard Way announced his debut solo album &quot;Hesitant Alien&quot; with the release of an advance-single, &quot;Action Cat&quot;. &quot;Hesitant Alien&quot; was released on September 29, 2014, in the UK, and a day later in the U.S. &quot;Hesitant Alien&quot; was a moderate commercial success, topping the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Albums chart and reaching No. 16 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Hesitant Alien&quot; also topped the &quot;Ten Essential Albums Of 2014&quot; list in &quot;Alternative Press&quot;.

Rhythm guitarist Frank Iero sporadically collaborated with My Chemical Romance keyboardist James Dewees, forming Death Spells and performing in Reggie and the Full Effect (alongside Ray Toro), releasing &quot;No Country for Old Musicians&quot; on November 19, 2013. Afterwards, he announced via his official website that he signed to Staple Records and would be releasing a full-length solo album titled &quot;Stomachaches&quot; under the moniker of &quot;frnkiero andthe cellabration&quot;. The album featured former My Chemical Romance touring drummer Jarrod Alexander. &quot;Stomachaches&quot; was released worldwide on August 25, 2014.

Bassist Mikey Way formed Electric Century along with Sleep Station vocalist David Debiak in 2014 and released their debut single &quot;I Lied&quot; in February 2014. The duo announced their debut self-titled EP on March 10, 2015, and it was released on Record Store Day on April 18, 2015. Lead guitarist Ray Toro released a song titled &quot;Isn&#x27;t That Something&quot; on May 24, 2013. On January 1, 2015, he posted a new song, titled &quot;For the Lost and Brave&quot;, on his website, dedicating the song to Leelah Alcorn, a transgender teen who committed suicide.
On July 20, 2016, the band posted on their official Twitter and Facebook pages a video with the piano intro from &quot;Welcome to the Black Parade&quot;, ending with a cryptic date, &quot;9/23/16&quot;. The video was also published on the band&#x27;s YouTube channel with the video titled &quot;MCRX&quot;. This led to numerous rumors and reports on the band&#x27;s possible reunion until it was revealed to be a reissue of &quot;The Black Parade&quot; with unreleased demos. The reissue, titled &quot;The Black Parade/Living with Ghosts&quot;, includes 11 demos and live tracks. Two months before its release, an early version of &quot;Welcome to the Black Parade&quot;, titled &quot;The Five of Us Are Dying&quot;, was made available for streaming.

In a discussion of his work on the comic book &quot;Doom Patrol&quot;, Gerard Way told &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t count (a reunion) out, but at the same time everybody&#x27;s doing stuff in their lives now that they&#x27;re really enjoying.&quot;

=== 2019–present: Reunion and new material ===
On October 31, 2019, the band announced they would be reuniting in Los Angeles on December 20 and a new merchandise line. The announcement was accompanied by the captions &quot;Return&quot; and &quot;Like Phantoms Forever...&quot;. The show sold out almost immediately. Believed initially to be a one-off show, almost a week later, the band announced more dates in Australia, Japan and New Zealand for 2020. They later revealed that they had first regrouped in 2017 and had been working together since then, before the official 2019 announcement. The concert grossed $1,451,745, with an attendance of 5,113.

In January 2020, the group announced plans to present one, then two, then three concerts at Stadium MK (Milton Keynes, England), on June 18, 20 and 21, 2020, as tickets for each day sold out within minutes. Later in the month, the group premiered a cryptic video on YouTube which ended by announcing a North American tour. The North American shows went on sale on January 31, 2020, and sold out in less than six hours. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, all of the shows on the tour that were set to begin in 2020 were postponed to 2021, including the North American leg. These tour dates were later rescheduled again to 2022. The tour commenced on May 16, 2022 at the Eden Project, and concluded on March 26, 2023 in Tokyo, Japan.

On May 12, 2022, the band released &quot;The Foundations of Decay&quot;, their first new song since 2014.

My Chemical Romance headlined When We Were Young Festival 2024 in Las Vegas alongside Fall Out Boy. The band performed their 2006 album &quot;The Black Parade&quot; in its entirety. Following the festival performance, the band later announced Long Live The Black Parade, a North American stadium tour in 2025, in which they are set to perform &quot;The Black Parade&quot; in its entirety.

In November 2024, the band&#x27;s former drummer, Bob Bryar, was found dead at his home. Despite having other drummers since his 2010 departure, Bryar was the last drummer for My Chemical Romance who served the band full-time.

==Musical style and influences==
===Style and classification===
My Chemical Romance are primarily known for their &quot;goth-tinged&quot; aesthetic, theatrical vocals, and &quot;introspective, confessional lyrics&quot;. The band&#x27;s music has mostly been categorized as alternative rock, emo, pop-punk, post-hardcore, punk rock, and hard rock. The band has also released songs that have been described as emo pop, hardcore punk, gothic rock, pop rock, arena rock, glam rock, progressive rock, heavy metal, pop, screamo, and garage punk. Gerard Way has publicly rejected the term &quot;emo&quot;, describing the genre as &quot;fucking garbage&quot; (although he has reportedly also described the band&#x27;s style as &quot;What-else-ya-got-emo&quot;).

The band&#x27;s debut album &quot;I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love&quot; exhibits a raw sound featuring fast guitar riffs, highly energetic vocals and occasional screaming. The album has been compared to the works of Thursday and has been described as emo, post-hardcore, screamo, punk rock, gothic rock, pop punk, and garage punk, with influences from hardcore punk and heavy metal. The band&#x27;s following album, &quot;Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge&quot; features &quot;hyper&quot; instrumentation and &quot;furious immediacy&quot;, and was described as alternative rock, emo, pop punk, post-hardcore, punk rock, and pop rock.

The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;The Black Parade,&quot; has been called an &quot;old-fashioned concept album&quot;, featuring &quot;pummeling riffs and soaring guitar solos&quot;. It has been &quot;described as alternative rock, emo, pop punk, progressive rock, post-hardcore, punk rock, and hard rock, with influences from 1970s classic rock, glam rock, pop, and gothic rock. The band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys,&quot; integrated elements of power pop, psychedelic rock, proto-punk, pop rock, and electronic rock into their sound.

===Influences===

Gerard Way said to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;we love bands like Queen, where it&#x27;s huge and majestic, but also bands like Black Flag and the Misfits, who would go absolutely crazy.&quot; Way has stated that the band is heavily influenced by Queen, Iron Maiden, Misfits, Black Flag, At the Gates, Descendents, Pantera, Van Halen, the Cure, Joy Division, Bauhaus, Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Smiths, Morrissey, and Thursday. The Smashing Pumpkins also impacted the band&#x27;s trajectory, with Way stating that My Chemical Romance has patterned their career after the Pumpkins&#x27;.

In a 2007 issue of &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, when asked to list the songs that influenced the band&#x27;s music the most, they listed Taking Back Sunday&#x27;s &quot;MakeDamnSure&quot;, Say Anything&#x27;s &quot;Alive with the Glory of Love&quot;, Thursday&#x27;s &quot;Understanding in a Car Crash&quot;, Kill Hannah&#x27;s &quot;Lips like Morphine&quot;, Black Flag&#x27;s &quot;Nervous Breakdown&quot;, the Misfit&#x27;s &quot;Dust to Dust&quot;, the Bled&#x27;s &quot;You Know Whose Seatbelt&quot;, Killswitch Engage&#x27;s &quot;Fixation of Darkness&quot;, Idlewild&#x27;s &quot;Love Steals Us from Loneliness&quot;, Alkaline Trio&#x27;s &quot;Radio&quot;, Thrice&#x27;s &quot;Red Sky&quot;, Denali&#x27;s &quot;Surface&quot;, Soilwork&#x27;s &quot;Bastard Chain&quot; and Helloween&#x27;s &quot;Twilight of the Gods&quot;. Frank Iero&#x27;s guitar work draws from Sonic Youth guitarist Thurston Moore and Jack White, while Ray Toro cites Megadeth, Metallica, Pantera, and Iron Maiden as influences. My Chemical Romance&#x27;s other influences include the Stooges, Ramones, Sex Pistols, the Clash, Minor Threat, Nirvana, and Operation Ivy. They also have noted that their lives, childhoods, books they&#x27;ve read and movies they&#x27;ve seen have influenced their music.

==Legacy and cultural impact==

=== Music and popular culture ===
According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, the band played &quot;somewhat of an anomaly in New Jersey&#x27;s then-burgeoning pop-punk and emo scene&quot;, before achieving their breakthrough with an &quot;instant emo classic&quot; &quot;Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge&quot;. In 2022, &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that during the height of their career they were &quot;unlikely superstars, misfits who inadvertently infiltrated the mainstream&quot; but upon their reunion tour, the band would &quot;return to a pop cultural landscape they helped to define&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s Christopher R. Weingarten has noted that &quot;The Black Parade&quot; inspired a number of 2010s musicians in different genres, including Twenty One Pilots, Crown the Empire, Famous Last Words, Halsey, Fun, Billie Eilish and Post Malone, and even influenced the sound of movie musicals like &quot;Frozen II&quot;. In 2016, &quot;Nylon&quot; wrote that the record &quot;took the idea of a concept album and exploited it for the digital age&quot;, while being musically a rock opera &quot;as ambitious as any post-Queen rock opera could be&quot;. Speaking on the band&#x27;s reception and criticism during the early 2000s, NPR Music wrote that, &quot;at a moment when mannered indie-pop and roughshod garage-rock were infiltrating the mainstream, [the band] was earnest, dramatic and unapologetically massive, in a way that made it conspicuously uncool,&quot; and deemed &quot;The Black Parade&quot; a &quot;defining album&quot; for a generation of pop-punk fans.

In 2020, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; deemed the band &quot;the rock superstars of the 21st century&quot; while stating that &quot;no other band has had such a musical or cultural impact over recent years.&quot; The magazine also noted their influence in &quot;the current music scene&quot; of alternative rock. &quot;Vice&quot; named My Chemical Romance the &quot;artist of the decade&quot;, with writer Hannah Ewens commenting that they &quot;influenced rock throughout the 2010s—even though they were inactive for most of the decade.&quot; In &quot;Paste&quot; magazine, Eli Enis wrote that &quot;it is pretty much accepted canon at this point that My Chemical Romance are one of the most significant rock bands this side of the millennium.&quot; James McMahon of &quot;The Independent&quot; stated that Gerard Way &quot;set a blueprint for emo&#x27;s image of pale face, raven-black hair and perhaps a red tie, for almost 20 years.&quot; Writing on the band&#x27;s influence, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Kyle Anderson stated that they &quot;offered up spiritual solutions to real problems, and they did it with huge riffs and big theatrical stage shows, with rarely a hint of irony or detachment... it&#x27;s unlikely there will ever be a band quite like them again.&quot;

=== LGBT community ===
In &quot;Archer&quot;, Vince Ruston commented on the band&#x27;s popularity in the queer and LGBT communities: &quot;My Chemical Romance wanted to speak to and raise up every person who had ever felt outcast, downtrodden, or alienated. Queer teens were a huge part of that demographic&quot;. Similarly, Michelle Hyun Kim described Gerard Way as a &quot;queer icon&quot; in &quot;Them&quot;, and that &quot;after the band announced their reunion on Halloween 2019, I saw tweets from LGBTQ+ folks around the world claiming, in some way or another, that MCR either served as a queer awakening or fostered their queerness.&quot; The band have long been supportive of LGBT rights and embraced their LGBT fandom.

==Tours==
===2000s===

My Chemical Romance played in many major tours of 2005. The band toured with Green Day in 2005 on the &quot;Green Day Presents American Idiot Tour&quot;. They were also part of the Warped Tour in the same year. &quot;For a lot of kids, it&#x27;s the one thing they look forward to all year,&quot; said Gerard Way of the Warped Tour. &quot;They save up for it. They get to see all the bands they like in one shot.&quot;

My Chemical Romance co-headlined the main stage with The Used on the Taste of Chaos tour, before starting their first headlining tour, simply named the &quot;My Chemical Romance Tour&quot;. The tour launched September 15 in Ohio, stopping at 30 locations in the United States, to promote their album, &quot;Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge&quot;. Supporting acts included Alkaline Trio and Reggie and the Full Effect. This tour marked the beginning of the heavy theatrics later showcased in many of their live shows. Way expressed his plans for the tour in an interview with MTV, saying, &quot;we&#x27;d talked about bringing out dancers for our headlining tour in the fall, but it&#x27;s a big undertaking; you have to have a bus full of dancers. We&#x27;ve always wanted to do a big theatrical tour. But you have to do it in steps&quot;.

The band joined headliners Linkin Park, along with Taking Back Sunday, on Projekt Revolution 2007, starting on July 25 and ending on September 3, 2007. During the tour, Gerard Way married Mindless Self Indulgence bassist Lindsay &quot;Lyn Z&quot; Ballato. Following the Projekt Revolution tour, they opened for Bon Jovi in October 2007.

===2010s===

On September 19, 2010, the band announced &quot;The World Contamination Tour&quot;, which took place in parts of the UK, France, Amsterdam and Germany.

The band embarked on a joint tour of the United States with Blink-182 in 2011. The tour was announced on May 23, 2011 when both bands gathered at the Rainbow Bar and Grill in West Hollywood. Members of the band&#x27;s fan clubs had the first chance at tickets to all shows, in an exclusive pre-sale that began on June 6. On June 8, anyone who &quot;liked&quot; the Honda Civic Tour&#x27;s Facebook page gained access to tickets. All remaining tickets went on sale to the general public on June 10 via Ticketmaster.com and LiveNation.com.

The band reunited out of the public eye in 2017 and announced a reunion show on October 31, 2019, which took place in Los Angeles on December 20, 2019, extending this to a small tour consisting of dates in Australia, New Zealand and Japan a week later.

===2020s===

On January 28, 2020, the group announced plans to present three concerts in Milton Keynes (UK), on 18, 20 and 21 of June 2020. On January 29, 2020, the band announced a North American tour.

In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the group postponed its Milton Keynes events, initially to June 2021. In June 2020, the band postponed all North American events to September and October 2021. In April 2021, the Milton Keynes concert was postponed again to May 2022. The rest of the tour was later postponed to 2022.

<text>Gorgeous (; released in the Philippines as High Risk) is a 1999 Hong Kong action romantic comedy film directed by Vincent Kok, who played Lo&#x27;s assistant, served as a writer with Lo Yiu-fai and Jackie Chan, who also stars and producer in the film. The film co-stars Shu Qi, Tony Leung, and Emil Chau. The film performed well at the Hong Kong box office.

==Plot==
Bu (Shu Qi) is a beautiful young girl from a small Taiwanese fishing village who discovers a romantic message in a bottle. She heads for Hong Kong to find its writer, only to learn that it was in fact written by Albert (Tony Leung Chiu-wai), a lonely gay man. She then meets a wealthy recycling company owner, C.N. (Jackie Chan). They fall in love with each other. The plot is soon thickened by the rivalry between Howie Lo (Emil Chau) and C.N., who are both businessmen who have known each other since their childhood days.

In the English dubbed version, some of the dialogues are changed and a few scenes are edited out. These scenes included one at the airport where Sandra Ng&#x27;s and Sam Lee&#x27;s characters conned and robbed Long Yi (Richie Jen) who supposedly is engaged to Bu and another where Stephen Chow&#x27;s policeman character came to investigate after C.N. fought off Howie Lo&#x27;s masked goons and Albert&#x27;s friends who on Bu&#x27;s request pretended to be gangsters attacking her who in turn is pretending to be the reported missing girlfriend of a Taiwan gangster leader.

== Production ==

Chan had long wanted to be involved in drama films, but had constantly been dissuaded by Leonard Ho, one of the founders of Golden Harvest and Chan&#x27;s godfather. Ho had argued that to ensure success in his films, Chan should play to his fanbase by only doing action movies and avoiding the love scenes that may alienate certain markets (notably Japan).
Ho died on 16 February 1998 and Chan left Golden Harvest soon after, seeking a change and a new freedom to make the films he really wanted to. This coincided with his growing fame in the West, due to the international success of the film &quot;Rush Hour&quot;.

&quot;Gorgeous&quot; was originally conceived purely as a love story, with Chan as producer, but not as one of the film&#x27;s cast. In order to secure the actress Shu Qi, the script of the film was re-written and a role for Chan was created. This soon developed into a starring role, and elements of action crept in. However, &quot;Gorgeous&quot; remains primarily a romantic comedy and so it differs from his usual all-out action films. The action scenes are fewer and there is no real bad guy character – the fight with the nominal enemy (played by Brad Allan) is a pre-arranged bout and both fighters wear boxing gloves – competitive rather than motivated by revenge or the fight for survival.

The director had wanted to use Chan&#x27;s office as the set for C.N.&#x27;s apartment, but this proved impractical, particularly as that section of the office is on the third floor. However, many props from Chan&#x27;s office were used including his own training dummy.
Chan said of his character C.N., that he was &quot;60-70% Jackie Chan&quot;. The clothing the character wears, the training routine he undergoes and healthy lifestyle he maintains, his general good nature and his environmental role are all traits and actions of Chan himself.

Chan summarised the difference between the films &quot;Rush Hour&quot; and &quot;Gorgeous&quot;, stating the former was a job, and the latter was his baby. In &quot;Rush Hour&quot; his role was restricted to actor and action director. In &quot;Gorgeous&quot;, he was also the producer, editor and was involved in casting.

Although a romantic comedy, the only significant kissing scene was dropped from the main film for fear that it would alienate certain East Asian markets who may not want to see Chan in such a relationship. The underwater kiss scene was retained and appeared amongst the out-takes that accompany the film&#x27;s closing credits.

The film is notable for casting numerous, then, unknown actors who went on to achieve national and in some cases multi-national success. These include: Sam Lee, Daniel Wu, Richie Jen and Stephen Fung.

==Release==
&quot;Gorgeous&quot; was released in Hong Kong on 12 February 1999. In the Philippines, the film was released as &quot;High Risk&quot; in early September 2002.

===Box office===
&quot;Gorgeous&quot; was a box office success in Hong Kong, grossing HK $40,545,889 during its theatrical run.

<text>John Bourchier, 2nd Baron Berners (1467 – 19 March 1533) was an English soldier, statesman and translator.

==Family==
John Bourchier, born about 1467, was the only son of Sir Humphrey Bourchier (d.1471 at the Battle of Barnet) and Elizabeth Tilney (d.1497), the daughter and sole heir of Sir Frederick Tilney of Boston, Lincolnshire. Through his father, Bourchier was descended from King Edward III; his great-grandmother, Anne of Gloucester, was the daughter of Thomas of Woodstock, King Edward&#x27;s youngest son.

By his mother&#x27;s first marriage, Bourchier had two sisters, Margaret, who married firstly, John Sandys, secondly, Sir Thomas Bryan, and thirdly, David Zouche, and Anne, who married Thomas Fiennes, 8th Baron Dacre of Gilsland.

After the death of Sir Humphrey Bourchier, his widow, Elizabeth, married Thomas Howard, then Earl of Surrey, and later 2nd Duke of Norfolk. By his mother&#x27;s second marriage Bourchier had ten siblings of the half blood, Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, Lord Edward Howard, Lord Edmund Howard, Sir John Howard, Henry Howard, Charles Howard, Henry Howard (again), Richard Howard, Elizabeth Howard, and Muriel Howard.

==Career==
After his father was slain fighting on the Yorkist side at the Battle of Barnet in 1471, Bourchier became a ward of John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk. As noted above, Bourchier&#x27;s mother, Elizabeth, had married as her second husband Thomas Howard, the eldest son and heir of Bourchier&#x27;s guardian by his first wife, Katherine Moleyns. In 1474 Bourchier&#x27;s grandfather, John Bourchier, 1st Baron Berners, died, and Bourchier inherited the title at the age of seven.

He was educated at Oxford University and in 1477 created a Knight of the Bath. In 1492 he contracted to serve in the wars overseas and took part in suppressing the Cornish rebellion of 1497 in support of Perkin Warbeck. 
He owned manor at West Horsley Place, which would be in path of rebels as they moved from Guilford to Banstead.

In 1513 he was engaged at the capture of Thérouanne and in 1520 accompanied Henry VIII and his entourage of peers and knights to the king&#x27;s meeting in France with Francis I of France at the Field of the Cloth of Gold.

Bourchier held various offices of state under King Henry VIII, including Lieutenant of Calais from 28 November 1520 and Chancellor of the Exchequer from 14 July 1524.

He translated, at the King&#x27;s desire, &quot;Froissart&#x27;s Chronicles&quot; (1523–1525), in such a manner as to make a distinct advance in English historical writing, and the &quot;Golden Book of Marcus Aurelius&quot; (1534), as well as &quot;The History of Arthur of Lytell Brytaine&quot; (Brittany), and the romance of &quot;Huon of Bordeaux&quot;.

Bourchier died at Calais in 1533.

==Marriage and issue==
Before 13 May 1490 Bourchier married his step-father&#x27;s half-sister, Katherine Howard, the daughter of John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk, by his second wife, Margaret Chedworth, daughter of Sir John Chedworth, and by her had a son and three daughters:

*Thomas Bourchier, who predeceased his father.
*Joan Bourchier (d. 1561), who married Sir Edmund Knyvet (d. 1 May 1539), sergeant porter to King Henry VIII, and was her father&#x27;s heir, and had:
*#John Knyvett, father of Thomas Knyvett, 4th Baron Berners (1539–1616)
*Margaret Bourchier, who predeceased her father.
*Mary Bourchier, who married Alexander Unton of Wadley, but died without issue, predeceasing her father.

By a mistress Bourchier had three illegitimate sons and an illegitimate daughter:

*Humphrey Bourchier (d. 1540), esquire, who married Elizabeth Bacon, but had no issue. 
*Sir James Bourchier (d. 1554), who married Mary Bannaster, daughter of Sir Humphrey Bannaster.
*George Bourchier
*Ursula Bourchier, who married Sir William Sharington.

After Humphrey Bourchier&#x27;s death his widow married George Ferrers, esquire.

<text>Medicine Hat—Cardston—Warner (formerly Medicine Hat) is a federal electoral district in southern Alberta, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1908.

Following the 2012 federal electoral redistribution, the riding was renamed Medicine Hat—Cardston—Warner.

In 2016, 34.9% of the population of the Medicine Hat constituency were of German ethnic origin, one of the highest percentages in all of Canada.

In the 42nd Canadian Parliament, the seat was represented by Jim Hillyer of the Conservative Party of Canada until his death on 23 March 2016. In the first by-election in the history of the Medicine Hat constituency held on 24 October 2016, Glen Motz of the Conservatives was elected. Motz has been the riding&#x27;s representative to Ottawa since then.

==Geography==
The constituency covers the City of Medicine Hat and surrounding areas in the southeast corner and southern U.S. border region of Alberta, including Cypress County, the County of Forty Mile No. 8, Warner No. 5 and the Town of Warner, and Cardston County and the Town of Cardston.

==Demographics==
:&quot;According to the 2011 Canadian census&quot;

Languages: 86.4% English, 7.4% German, 1.2% French, ~1.1% Blackfoot (Blackfoot/Kainai counted as &quot;Other language&quot; on the Census; this number derived from &quot;other language&quot; speakers on Blackfoot/Kainai First Nations)
Religions: 72.0% Christian (21.4% Catholic, 9.6% United Church, 6.1% Lutheran, 3.6% Anglican, 2.2% Pentecostal, 1.5% Baptist, 27.6% Other Christian), 1.2% Traditional Indigenous Spirituality, 25.6% None.
Median income: $29,534 (2010)
Average income: $39,940 (2010)

==History==
Soon after the province of Alberta was admitted to Confederation in 1905, this electoral district was created – in 1907 – from Alberta (Provisional District) and Assiniboia West ridings.

During the 2012 electoral redistribution, &quot;Medicine Hat&quot; was largely succeeded by &quot;Medicine Hat—Cardston—Warner&quot;, losing territory to Bow River and Battle River—Crowfoot, and gaining territory from Lethbridge and Macleod.

Shu has also played leading roles in both art-house films and box-office hits, including &quot;If You Are the One&quot; (2008) by Feng Xiaogang, &quot;Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons&quot; (2013) by Stephen Chow, &quot;Gone with the Bullets&quot; (2014) by Jiang Wen, and &quot;&quot; (2015) by Wuershan.

<text>Sir Walter Besant (14 August 1836 – 9 June 1901) was an English novelist and historian. William Henry Besant was his brother, and another brother, Frank, was the husband of Annie Besant.

==Early life and education==
The son of wine merchant William Besant (1800–1879), he was born at Portsmouth, Hampshire and attended school at St Paul&#x27;s, Southsea, Stockwell Grammar, London and King&#x27;s College London. In 1855, he was admitted as a pensioner to Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1859 as 18th wrangler.

After a year as Mathematical Master at Rossall School, Fleetwood, Lancashire, and a year at Leamington College, he spent six years as professor of mathematics at the Royal College, British Mauritius. A decline in health compelled him to resign, and he returned to England and settled in London in 1867. From 1868 to 1885, he held the position of Secretary to the Palestine Exploration Fund. In 1871, he was admitted to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn.

In 1874, Besant married Mary Garrett ( Foster Barham), daughter of Eustace Foster-Barham, of Bridgwater, with whom he had four children. For some time he took care of his sister-in-law Annie Besant, a prominent women&#x27;s rights activist, socialist, and theosophist.

==Career==
In 1868 he published &quot;Studies in French Poetry&quot;. Three years later he began his collaboration with writer James Rice. Among their joint productions are &quot;Ready-money Mortiboy&quot; (1872), and &quot;The Golden Butterfly&quot; (1876), both, especially the latter, very successful. This association was ended by the death of Rice in 1882.

Thereafter, Besant continued to write voluminously by himself, his main novels being &quot;All in a Garden Fair&quot; (which Rudyard Kipling credited in &quot;Something of Myself&quot; with inspiring him to leave India and make a career as a writer, and which George Gissing read with &#x27;extreme delight&#x27;, calling it &#x27;one of the most charming and delicate of modern novels), &quot;Dorothy Forster&quot; (his own favorite), &quot;Children of Gibeon&quot;, and &quot;All Sorts and Conditions of Men&quot;. The two last belonged to a series in which he endeavored to arouse the public conscience to the hardship among the poorest classes of cities. In this crusade Besant had considerable success, the establishment of The People&#x27;s Palace in the East of London being one result. His 1889 novel &quot;The Bell of St. Paul&#x27;s&quot; was considered by his contemporary author George Gissing to be an &#x27;absurd and empty book&#x27;.

&quot;Harper&#x27;s New Monthly Magazine&quot; published ten of his works of fiction, including &quot;All Sorts and Conditions of Men; an Impossible Story,&quot; which is famous for having suggested the founding of the People&#x27;s Palace, London.

In addition to his fiction, Besant wrote largely on the history and topography of London. His plans for this topic were left unfinished: among his books on this subject is &quot;London in the 18th Century&quot;.
Besant was a freemason, joining the Lodge of Harmony in Mauritius in 1862. He became Master of Marquis of Dalhousie Lodge, London in 1873, having joined in 1869. He was one of the founders of the first Masonic research lodge, Quatuor Coronati Lodge No 2076, of which he was the first treasurer from 1886. He was also one of the founders and first chair of the Society of Authors in 1884. He was knighted in the 1895 Birthday Honours as a Knight Bachelor.

Besant was treasurer of the &quot;Atlantic Union&quot;, an association which sought to improve social relations between Britons and Americans. In 1896, he published an article in the &quot;North American Review&quot; advocating the creation of a &quot;United Federation of States&quot; to unify the Anglosphere under a federal system; he cited the &quot;restlessness&quot; of the Anglo-Saxon people and the existing achievements of the United States and the British Empire in claiming that the Federation &quot;would be the greatest, the richest, the most powerful empire, republic or state that history has ever recorded.&quot;

==Death==
He died in Frognal in Hampstead, London on 9 June 1901, aged 64.

In 1903 the Society of Authors erected at St. Paul&#x27;s a plaque of Besant by George Framton. The inscription reads: &quot;Sir Walter Besant, novelist. historian of London, secretary of the Palestine exploration fund, originator of the people&#x27;s palace and founder of the Society of Authors. This monument is erected by his grateful brethren in literature. Born August 14, 1836. Died June, 1901.&quot;

<text>The National Museum of Taiwan Literature (NMTL; ) is a museum located in Tainan, Taiwan. Operated by Taiwan&#x27;s Ministry of Culture, the museum researches, catalogs, preserves, and exhibits literary artifacts, and is also the first national literature museum in Taiwan. As part of its multilingual, multi-ethnic focus, it holds a large collection of local works in Taiwanese, Japanese, Mandarin and Classical Chinese.

It was planned as a national-level organization to fill in a long-perceived gap in how modern Taiwanese institutions had handled Taiwanese literature as a field of academic inquiry and popular discourse. Tainan was chosen for its historical significance as a cultural center.

As of May 2023, it houses a collection of approximately 130,000 items. Formerly the Tainan Prefectural Hall, the museum was repurposed as the venue for the National Museum of Taiwan Literature in Jan. 2003, marking an important case of &quot;historical building reuse&quot; in official architecture in Taiwan. On November 10 of the same year, it was officially designated as a national historic site.

==History==
The museum is housed in the , itself a national historical monument. The building was constructed in 1916 during the Japanese rule of Taiwan. 

In November 1990, the Cultural Construction Committee of the Executive Yuan (now the Ministry of Culture) convened the National Culture Conference, where scholars and experts called for setting an authoritative institution for the collection and research of Taiwanese literary materials. In 1992, the original office of the Tainan City Government, formerly the Tainan Prefectural Hall, was chosen for the purpose. After administrative coordination and advocacy by scholars, the National Museum of Taiwan Literature was established and opened in 2003. In 2007, it was established as a fourth-level central administrative agency and officially named the National Museum of Taiwan Literature. In 2021, it was promoted to a third-level central institution.

Taiwan Literature Base, established in 2014 and affiliated with National Museum of Taiwan Literature, is situated within Qidong Street Japanese Houses, the Japanese-style dormitory complex on Chidong Street in Taipei City.

== Features ==
The National Museum of Taiwan Literature combines the national historic site of the Tainan Prefectural Hall with new construction. Parts of the historic building, the original Tainan Prefectural Hall, were completely destroyed by incendiary bombs fired by US forces during World War II. After the war, it underwent minor repairs, first serving as the Air Force Supply Command Headquarters and then becoming the Tainan City Government Hall. After the repairs, the historic section was largely restored to its Japanese-period appearance and was listed as a national historic site under the name Former Tainan Prefectural Hall. The post-war additions converted it into a new building with two floors above ground and three floors underground.

The museum houses the cultural heritage research center of Bureau of Cultural Heritage.

==Transportation==
The museum is accessible within walking distance South West from Tainan Station of the Taiwan Railways.

<text>Cub (also stylized cub) was an indie pop band from Vancouver, British Columbia, that formed in 1992 and disbanded in 1997. They played a melodic, jangly form of pop punk they called &quot;cuddlecore&quot;.

==History==

The group was emblematic of the twee pop and cuddlecore style. At their cozy, casual live shows, they sometimes played in their pajamas, and gave out presents to audience members.

The group&#x27;s original drummer, Valeria Fellini, was replaced by Lisa G. in 1994.

Neko Case played drums on some early recordings and on tour in later years. Notably, she sang live in front of an audience for the first time ever during a cub show in Ohio, singing the song &quot;So Far Apart&quot;. Years later she would go on to form her own all-female three piece Vancouver band, Maow.

After the group&#x27;s dissolution, Robynn Iwata co-formed I Am Spoonbender in 1997 in San Francisco. Lisa Marr and Lisa G. started Buck in 1998 after moving to California from their native Vancouver.

<text>SCP-ISM, or screened Coulomb potentials implicit solvent model, is a continuum approximation of solvent effects for use in computer simulations of biological macromolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids, usually within the framework of molecular dynamics. It is based on the classic theory of polar liquids, as developed by Peter Debye and corrected by Lars Onsager to incorporate reaction field effects. The model can be combined with quantum chemical calculations to formally derive a continuum model of solvent effects suitable for computer simulations of small and large molecular systems.

<text>The SIAI-Marchetti SF.260 (now Leonardo SF-260) is an Italian light aircraft which has been commonly marketed as a military trainer and aerobatics aircraft.

The SF.260 was designed by Italian aircraft designer Stelio Frati, while production work originally performed by Milan-based aviation manufacturer Aviamilano. On 15 July 1964, the first prototype performed its maiden flight (then designated F.260). Shortly thereafter, responsibility for production was transferred to SIAI Marchetti, who had purchased the rights to the design; manufacturing continued to be performed by this firm until the company was bought by Aermacchi in 1997.

The SF.260 has been largely sold to military customers as a trainer and light combat aircraft. In addition, there have been limited civil sales to private operators; during the late 1960s, the type was marketed in the United States under the name &quot;Waco Meteor&quot;. Armed military versions, sold as the SF.260W Warrior, proved to be popular with smaller air forces, which could arm the type for use in the close air support role. Both piston-powered and turboprop-powered models have been developed.

==Development==
===Origins===
During the early 1960s, Italian aircraft designer Stelio Frati commenced work upon a new three-seat aerobatic design, which was primarily intended to serve as a sport aircraft. Unlike many of its peers of the era, it was developed to possess aerobatic capabilities akin to contemporary combat aircraft, as well as being equipped for instrument flight rules (IFR) flight. This design drew heavily upon his previous projects, including the jet-powered Caproni Trento F-5 prototype trainer and the Falco F8L twin-seat aerobatic aircraft, sharing the same wing and a similar structure to the Falco. The envisioned aircraft, initially designated as the &quot;F.250&quot; due to the horsepower of its engine, was Frati&#x27;s first all-metal aircraft.

On 15 July 1964, the type performed its maiden flight. In the aftermath of the maiden flight, prime responsibility for the type&#x27;s manufacture was acquired from Aviamilano by SIAI Marchetti, which had purchased the rights to the design outright. Shortly after entering production, the SF.260 found itself in high demand by military customers, who often adopted it interchangeably as a military trainer or as a lightweight ground-attack aircraft. Between 1964 and 1984, the majority of customers for the type were military, while a small number of private pilots had been able to obtain a few, although supply in this respect was constrained.

During the late 1960s, the aircraft was marketed in the United States market as the &quot;Waco Meteor&quot;, although it had no connections of any form with the Waco Aircraft Company; the venture was relatively unsuccessful. During the late 1970s and 1980s, American airline pilot Frank Strickler became a major reseller of the type, being credited with re-launching civil sales of the SF.260 in the region, acquiring them from SIAI Marchetti in small batches and individually selling them on to US-based customers.

===Further development===
During the late 1970s, an improved model of the SF.260A, designated as the &quot;SF.260C&quot;, had replaced it in production. This model featured various improvements, including redesigned tabs on the ailerons, a strengthened wing, a re-profiled aerofoil for improved low-speed handling, and an elongated tail/rudder. The SF.260C was designed for compliance with the requirements of military specifications. The only structural difference between the SF.260C and its armed brethren, the &quot;SF.260W Warrior&quot; and &quot;SF.260SW Sea Warrior&quot;, is the presence of underwing hardpoints for attaching equipment and armaments.

During 1980, SIAI Marchetti performed the first flight of a turboprop-powered SF.260TP, powered by an Allison Model 250 engine flat-rated at 350 shp. This variant was marketed towards the military trainer market, which soon adopted the type. In August 1986, Gates Learjet was approached by SIAI Marchetti to modify the SF.260TP for it to be compliant with the requirements of Federal Aviation Administration&#x27;s (FAA) FAR Part 23, thus allowing it to be certified for civil use. Modifications were made in order to achieve lower stall speed and greater payload capacity, these performance improvements were principally achieved through aerodynamic alterations, such as the adoption of &#x27;shark&#x27;s teeth&#x27; along the wing&#x27;s leading edge.

In 1991–1992, SIAI-Marchetti proposed an updated SF.260, with an enlarged cockpit canopy and a revised fuel system to meet the United States Air Force&#x27;s Enhanced Flight Screener competition. While the bid was unsuccessful (with the Slingsby T67 Firefly being preferred), it formed the basis for future production, as the fuel injected SF.260E and the normally aspirated SF.260F. During 2005, a batch of thirty SF.260EA were delivered to the Italian Air Force for a total price of €33 million ($40 million). This model, which had been specially developed to meet an Italian Air Force requirement for an advanced piston-engine aircraft, is used for screening and principal training activities.

Production of the SF.260 continued at low rate until 2017. A total of 976 aircraft, including prototypes, were built.

==Design==

The SIAI-Marchetti SF.260 is a low-mounted cantilever wing monoplane, complete with a retractable tricycle undercarriage. It has been often praised for its sleek lines and sporty aesthetic appearance, while maintaining function as well, possessing jet-like handling as a result. The construction is typically known for having a high level of workmanship, while exterior is extensively flush-riveted to reduce aerodynamic drag, except for a few locations such as the flaps and some fairings. The SF.260 has a compact, dense structure which possesses ballistics similar to a jet aircraft, and is approved to perform aerobatic manoeuvres. In comparison to most single-engine aircraft, it possesses superior power loading and above average wing loading.

The original model of the SF.260 was powered by a single Lycoming O-540 engine, capable of providing 260 hp. The standard engine made use of a carburetor, while a fuel injected engine was available as an optional extra. The SF.260 has been described as having the power to be immune to the gyration-like effects of turbulence and possessing a high rate of climb. During the 1980s, aerospace publication &quot;Flying&quot; stated the SF.260 to be: &quot;the fastest normally aspirated piston single in production&quot;. The SF.260 holds the airspeed records for aircraft in its class over the and closed circuits. Later-built models often made use of turboprop engines; the initial model to be equipped as such, designated as the &quot;SF.260TP&quot;, was powered by a single Allison Model 250 engine, flat-rated at 350 shp.

The pilot and up to two passengers (or pilot and one student in trainer versions) are accommodated under a broad, extensively glazed canopy. The pilot, who accesses the aircraft via purpose-built walkways along the wing, would be typically seated on the right-hand side of the cockpit; military pilots are trained to control the aircraft using their right hand on the stick and their left on the throttle.

While being a fully aerobatic aircraft, it possesses favourable handling qualities, including relatively tame stall characteristics. Controllability during stalls is augmented by vanes located on the wing tip tanks which accelerate airflow over the tips and ailerons. The SF.260 is a relatively fast aircraft, complete with responsive controls; as a product of the latter, pilots need to maintain awareness of speed dips, although ample aerodynamic warning is typically present. Piston-engined and turboprop-engined SF.260 models generally share similar handling and flight performance. Speed limitations on the landing gear has been highlighted as a negative attribute. In order to safely perform aerobatics, the rear seat has to be unoccupied and the tip tanks must be empty of fuel prior to commencing any such manoeuvers, reducing the SF.260&#x27;s flight endurance to roughly one and a half hours.

==Operational history==

===Burkina Faso===
This small air force operated six Warriors these Warriors were sold from the Philippines via Belgium in 1986, and were complemented by other four new Warriors coming directly from Italy, and employed during the Agacher Strip War with Mali in 1986. These aircraft were in service with &quot;Escadrille de Chasse&quot; (&quot;Fighter Squadron&quot;) in the &quot;Force Aérienne du Burkina Faso&quot; (FABF), the Burkina Faso Air Force.

===Chad===
Chad informed the United Nations that, during the conflict with Libya, it had destroyed eight Libyan Air Force SF.260WLs and captured nine others, besides destroying and capturing other equipment. As many as six former Libyan SF.260WLs may have been pressed into service with Chad&#x27;s Air Force.
By 1988, four SF.260Ws were identified as being in service, two of them were overhauled one year later in France.

In November 2006, Libya supplied Chad with four SF.260W aircraft, including crew, due to tensions between Chad and Sudan over the Darfur area. One newly supplied SF.260W was shot down on 28 November – its first mission in Chad – by rebel forces, killing the crew.

===Libya===
Libya was a major customer of the SIAI Marchetti SF.260 with an order of 240 SF.260WLs. The first 60 aircraft were manufactured in Italy, while the others were delivered as knock-down kits, and assembled in a new plant in Sebha, under the supervision of Italian technicians.
The SF.260WL was intended for pilot training, but was also used for ground support during the war in Chad. Dozens of Italian pilots served as instructors for Libyan cadets from 1977. Their number decreased in 1982, as they were supplemented by a group of 15 Libyan instructors, who had been trained at SIAI Marchetti&#x27;s facilities in Italy. Libyan SF.260s played an important role during the country&#x27;s involvement in Chad. They were used as light ground attack aircraft, using machine gun pods, rockets and bombs. Their first known actions took place in February 1978, when they participated in air strikes on the Chadian army garrison of Faya-Largeau together with Mil Mi-25 helicopters. As a result of the sustained bombardment, the majority of the 5,000 troops deployed there fled, and around 1,500 of them were taken prisoners on February 18.

Gaddafi finally succeeded in installing a generally pro-Libyan government in N&#x27;Djamena in 1979 (the Transitional Government of National Unity or GUNT). However, the new Chadian defence minister, Hissène Habré, was fiercely anti-Libyan, and immediately started distancing himself from the rest of the government. This culminated in Habré&#x27;s forces taking N&#x27;Djamena on 1 April 1980. Pro-Libyan factions fled to Libya, where they were reorganized and re-armed. These forces came back to Chad in October of the same year, together with the Islamic Legion. Once again, SF.260s were involved in heavy airstrikes on Faya-Largeau, together with Mi-25 helicopters, Mirage 5s and Tupolev Tu-22s. The quasi-continuous bombardment, which lasted for almost a week, had a big impact on the morale of the defenders. Hence, the pro-Libyan GUNT forces easily took control of Faya-Largeau in early November 1980.

After continuing the advance towards the south, by late November, pro-Libyan units had reached Dougia, only 60 kilometres north of N&#x27;Djamena. Libyan SF.260s were forward-deployed there, together with Mi-25s. On 8 December, these aircraft, joined on 12 December by Tu-22 bombers, D-30 howitzers, and M-46 field guns, started attacking N&#x27;Djamena. The week-long bombing caused a huge amount of destruction in the Chadian capital, and a number of civilian casualties that remains unknown today. After Habré fled to Cameroon, resistance collapsed and his surviving fighters escaped to Sudan.

In August 1981, Gaddafi ordered the Libyan Arab Air Force to attack Habré&#x27;s bases inside Sudan. On 16 September, a SF.260 was shot down by ground fire near Junaina in the Darfur region of Sudan; both crew members were killed.

In May 1982, Habré&#x27;s forces came back to Chad from their Sudanese bases, and in June 1982 they expelled the GUNT from the capital N&#x27;Djamena. Once again, its chief Goukouni Oueddei had to flee to Libya with his remaining forces. After another Libyan/GUNT offensive in 1983, France launched Operation Manta, resulting in a general stalemate that lasted until 1986; pro-Libyan GUNT forces retained control of the northern parts of the country. In February of that year, a new attack was launched towards the south, supported by SF.260s and helicopters. However, this offensive collapsed after only four days.

Libyan SF.260s were used in the last phase of the conflict in Chad, the Toyota War, which started in December 1986. In February 1987, SF.260s were involved in attacks against FANT columns active in the area north of Faya-Largeau, using unguided rockets. Chadian MANPADS teams armed with FIM-43 Redeyes and 9K32 Strela-2s claimed to have shot down one LAAF SF.260 on 14 March near Fada. Five days later, when Chadian forces ambushed a Libyan armoured column, another SF.260 was shot down, either by Chadian-operated Redeyes or by FIM-92 Stingers operated by a French special forces team from the 11e régiment parachutiste de choc. Moreover, twelve SF.260s were lost when Chadian forces overran the airfield at Ouadi Doum on 21 March, including five captured intact. In an attempt to destroy as much of the captured equipment as possible, the Libyans heavily bombed the airfield from the air until late April. SF.260s were involved in these attacks. On 29 March, an SF.260 was claimed shot down by Chadian MANPADS north of Zouar. Lastly, in 1988, as Chad and Libya were negotiating a settlement for the conflict, pro-Libyan insurgents were infiltrated into Sudan, from where they started attacking garrisons inside Chad. They were often supported by SF.260s, and one of these was shot down on 28 November, and its crew captured.

The Libyan government supported friendly countries with arms, and several SF.260Ws were handed over to air forces such as those of Burkina Faso, Burundi, Nicaragua, Uganda and possibly others. In 1987 Chad reported to the United Nations the destruction of eight SF.260s and the capture of nine others during its border war with Libya; some of these secondhand Libyan aircraft may even have found their way onto the US market.

Alenia Aermacchi refurbished twelve SF.260 primary trainers for the Libyan Air Force; the work was performed jointly by Alenia Aermacchi and Tripoli-based Libyan-Italian Advanced Technology. The work included overhaul of the airframes and systems, including propellers and engines. Work began in late 2007 and ran through 2008.

During the civil war, on May 7, 2011, this aircraft (along with a formation of pro-Gaddafi planes) was probably involved in a successful air raid over the rebel-held fuel depots at Misrata, setting them on fire. NATO failed to intercept the flight, despite the introduction of a no-fly zone over Libya in March. At the beginning of the uprising, one aircraft was crushed under a tank during a rebel attack on Misrata air base.

As of 2013, at least six airframes are still in service with the new Libyan Air Force and are involved in patrols and possibly airstrikes against smugglers in the porous and remote borders.

===Nicaragua===
At least seven SF.260WLs were received by the Fuerza Aérea Sandinista as support from Libya in 1984–1985. They may have been used in the COIN role against the Contras and in the pilot training role. No further details are known. Three SF.260s surfaced in the USA on the secondhand market, a fourth is slowly being rebuilt in Guatemala. No longer in service.

===Philippines===

In the early 1970s, an order was placed for 48 SF.260s (32 SF.260M; 16 SF.260W). The first six were delivered in May 1973, replacing the Beech T-34A Mentor with 100th Training Wing at Fernando Air Base.

The 15th Strike Wing on airbase Sangley Point received the SF.260W Warrior as an addition to the North American T-28 Trojans. They were possibly used in combat against rebel forces in the south of the Philippines. But little is known about its service life. In the early 1980s, the surviving Warriors were disarmed and transferred to the training role with 100th Training Wing.

The Philippines Air Force signed with Agusta a contract for the delivery of 18 SF.260TP turboprops on 31 December 1991, replacing the SF.260M/W in the training role. The first SF.260TP was noted in country on 1 July 1993.

Under &quot;Project Layang&quot; the Philippines Air Force plans to upgrade 18 SF.260M/W aircraft to the SF.260TP standard, by replacing the Lycoming piston engine with the Allison 250-B17D turboprop engine and newer avionics. The first upgraded SF.260 was delivered in 1996, no further details are available.

The Philippines has finalized a deal with Alenia Aermacchi for 18 new-build SF.260F primary/basic trainers. All 18 were delivered by Aermacchi Italy which was locally assembled by Aerotech Industries Philippines by April 2011.

Six Warriors were sold to Burkina Faso via Belgium in 1986.

===Rhodesia===
Despite an arms embargo, two batches of SF.260 aircraft were delivered in 1977. Because of the embargo, several buying teams travelled the world looking for suitable equipment. Through various routes, 17 SF.260C and 14 SF.260W aircraft arrived, the former to be used in the training role, while the warriors were being used for light attack duties and escort of convoys.
In 1984–85, reportedly eight SF.260Ws were converted to SF.260TP standard by replacing the piston engine with a turboprop engine.

===Sri Lanka===
Six SF.260TPs were delivered to the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) in 1985, to be used in the pilot training role, although they were later brought into the government&#x27;s effort to subdue the Tamil Tigers. Two former factory demonstration aircraft were delivered in 1986 to replace lost aircraft, added by three new built aircraft in 1988. All SF.260 aircraft are based with No. 1 Flying Training Wing on the airbase SLAF Anuradhapura. The SF.260TP fleet was expanded in 1990–91 with the delivery of twelve former Myanmar SF.260Ws.
The SF.260W fleet was withdrawn from use in 2001, being replaced by Chinese Nanchang PT-6 aircraft. The SF.260TP fleet was also retired a few years later.

===Turkey===
In 1990, the Turkish Air Force placed an order for 40 planes. The first six were produced in Italy and the remaining 34 were produced by Turkish Aerospace Industries in Turkey, under licence.

<text>George Grande (born 1947) (pronounced like the English word &quot;grand&quot;) is an American sportscaster who is a former broadcaster for the Cincinnati Reds of Major League Baseball.

Grande is also famous for having hosted the first broadcast of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; on ESPN in 1979.

==Early life and career==
Grande graduated from the University of Southern California in 1969, where he played baseball for four years and was a member of the Trojans&#x27; team that won the 1968 College World Series. While at USC, he played with 14 future Major Leaguers, including Hall of Famer Tom Seaver and slugger Dave Kingman.

He began his broadcasting career as a USC student in 1967 as the sports director and news director of the university&#x27;s radio station, KUSC-FM, followed by radio stints at KNX in Los Angeles; WERI in Westerly, Rhode Island, where he learned his craft from news director Steve J. Caminis; and WNHC in New Haven, Connecticut. He completed his radio broadcast career by handling the Boston Red Sox pre-game and post-game shows on WMEX. Prior to joining ESPN, Grande also served as a sportscaster at WTNH, a TV station in New Haven.

==ESPN==
Grande and Lee Leonard were the first two people to be seen on ESPN upon its launch. After Leonard gave an introduction to viewers concerning what the network was all about, he tossed to Grande who was sitting at a desk dubbed the &quot;ESPN Sports Center&quot;, which became the name of the fledgling network&#x27;s nightly news broadcast. In the early years of the network, he served as host of the &quot;Inside Baseball&quot; weekly magazine program, which evolved into the current &quot;Baseball Tonight&quot; program on ESPN.

==Major League Baseball play-by-play==
Grande was a TV play-by-play announcer for Major League Baseball&#x27;s New York Yankees in 1989 and 1990 and for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1991 and 1992.

He joined the Cincinnati Reds TV broadcast team and was its lead broadcaster from 1993 to 2009 for SportsChannel Cincinnati and Fox Sports Ohio. He teamed with former player Chris Welsh to form the longest-running TV broadcasting partnership in team history.

On October 4, 2009, Grande announced that he would step down after 17 seasons with the Reds, stating that he wanted to spend more time with his family. However, he has since returned for a notable number of games each season through 2018.

Grande also served as master of ceremonies for the National Baseball Hall of Fame&#x27;s annual inductions for 31 years, from 1980 to 2010.

Grande is on the board of directors for USA Baseball.

<text>Benson Fong (; October 10, 1916 – August 1, 1987) was an American character actor.

Born in Sacramento, California, Fong was from a mercantile family of Chinese extraction. After graduating from high school in Sacramento, he studied briefly in China before returning to Sacramento and opening a grocery store with a cousin.

==Career==
Fong&#x27;s acting career resulted from a chance meeting with a Hollywood talent scout. In 1943, while having dinner with some friends in Sacramento, he was approached by a man from Paramount Pictures, who asked if he would like to be in a movie. Fong ended up with a role in a film called &quot;China&quot; starring Loretta Young and Alan Ladd. He was also offered a 10-week contract for $250 a week.

&quot;It looked like a tremendous fortune and I accepted quickly, afraid they might think twice and back out,&quot; he told an interviewer. &quot;I couldn&#x27;t read lines too well, but World War II was under way and all the studios were looking for actors with Oriental features. I bicycled around from one set to another, playing a Japanese here, a Filipino there, a Chinese on still other days.&quot;

The next year, he played one of the sons in &quot;Charlie Chan in the Secret Service&quot;. Other films in which he appeared included &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot;, &quot;The Keys of the Kingdom&quot;, &quot;His Majesty O&#x27;Keefe&quot;, &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot;, &quot;Our Man Flint&quot;, and &quot;The Strongest Man in the World&quot;.

First appearing onscreen in &quot;Charlie Chan at the Opera&quot; as an extra, he returned to the series and is best remembered playing Number Three Son &quot;Tommy Chan&quot; opposite Sidney Toler in six &quot;Charlie Chan&quot; movies between 1944 and 1946, replacing Victor Sen Yung&#x27;s Number Two Son, Jimmy.

His later career as an actor included numerous TV appearances in both series and movies. Fong made four guest appearances on &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, seven on &quot;My Three Sons&quot; as Ray Wong, and four on &quot;Kung Fu&quot;. Additionally, he played The Old One in the 1986 TV movie &quot;Kung Fu:The Movie&quot;.

He played Mr. Tang Wu in Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Love Bug&quot;. Actress Michele Lee later said that the 52-year-old actor had to have his jet-black hair sprayed bright white to make him look older.

Later in life, Fong became a successful restaurateur and opened several Ah Fong (亞方) restaurants in California. His chain of five restaurants, which he built up over a 30-year period, resulted from a casual remark made by actor Gregory Peck. After appearing together in &quot;The Keys of the Kingdom&quot;, Fong recalled, Peck suggested they start a restaurant together. &quot;The idea appealed to me,&quot; Fong said. By that time, he was dating his future wife Gloria. Wanting to have a predictable income instead of becoming one more struggling actor, he decided the restaurant would have to be done with his own capital, so he began saving. Two years later, he had $11,000, and in 1946, opened his first Ah Fong&#x27;s on Hollywood&#x27;s Vine Street. By 1971, four others had opened. The Ah in the Ah Fong&#x27;s name is a term of respect in Chinese, but Fong thought up the name while looking at the wrapper of an &quot;Oh Henry!&quot; candy bar. Retiring from the business in 1985, only the Hollywood Ah Fong&#x27;s remained, owned by a relative, at the time of his death.

An avid golfer and frequent traveler to Asia, Fong practiced meditation and once described himself as &quot;a split personality – half a pound Oriental and eight ounces Yankee&quot;. He stated in one interview that he summed up his life this way: &quot;Whatever I am, spiritually speaking, is what I&#x27;ve wanted to be, nothing more and nothing less. Call me a happy man and you call me by my rightful name.&quot;

== Personal life and death==
Fong was married to the actress Maylia Fong, with whom he had five children. He died of a stroke in Los Angeles, California, in 1987.

<text>Damage Done is the sixth studio album by Swedish melodic death metal band Dark Tranquillity. Here, the band returns to a more classic style while holding the changes made in their albums &quot;Haven&quot; and &quot;Projector&quot;, especially in the keyboards, but this is the first record since &quot;The Mind&#x27;s I&quot; that does not feature clean vocals. Martin Henriksson started doing some &quot;lead guitar riffs&quot; on the record, so the band showed influences from &quot;The Gallery&quot; in the duality of lead guitars. Mikael Stanne said that the lyrics on this album are about the frailty of life.

The song &quot;Cathode Ray Sunshine&quot; is featured in the video game&#x27;s soundtrack, &quot;Brütal Legend&quot;.

Several versions of the album feature a bonus track entitled &quot;I, Deception&quot; as well as the &quot;Monochromatic Stains&quot; video clip but it is known that the limited edition digipak contains them. The Japanese version of the album features the bonus track, &quot;The Poison Well&quot;. The vinyl release includes &quot;I, Deception&quot; and also has different cover art. The 2009 reissue includes bonus tracks and digitally remastered audio.

This is the first release for the band to chart. The album cover art which was done by Niklas Sundin feature&#x27;s Mikael Stanne kneeling and holding his head.

<text>Ben Terrence Coates Jr. (born August 16, 1969) is an American former professional football tight end who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 10 seasons, primarily with the New England Patriots. He played college football at Livingstone College and was selected by the Patriots in the fifth round of the 1991 NFL draft, where spent all but one season of his NFL career. In his final season, he was a member of the Baltimore Ravens.

During his nine seasons with the Patriots, Coates was a five-time Pro Bowler and two-time first-team All-Pro. He also made an appearance in Super Bowl XXXI. After being released by the Patriots, Coates signed with the Ravens and was part of the team that won Super Bowl XXXV. Coates pursued a coaching career following his retirement, serving as the head coach at his alma mater Livingstone and the tight ends coach for the Cleveland Browns. He was named to the second NFL 1990s All-Decade Team in 2000 and inducted to the New England Patriots Hall of Fame in 2008.

==Early life==
Coates didn&#x27;t play football until his senior year at Greenwood High School, and was a multi-sport player at Livingstone College located in Salisbury, North Carolina. As a gridiron player at Livingstone, he broke nearly all meaningful records at the school, but due to his split-sport performances against small-school opponents, he received little notice outside the CIAA. While a college student, he joined Phi Beta Sigma fraternity through the Untouchable Upsilon Chapter at Livingstone College. He finished his college career with 103 receptions for 1,268 yards and 18 touchdowns. In 2018, he was inducted into the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association Hall of Fame.

==Professional career==

Considered an out-of-nowhere prospect, Coates was selected in the fifth round of the 1991 NFL draft by the New England Patriots. His first two years with the Patriots were fairly uneventful; in his rookie year he had ten catches for 95 yards and a two-yard touchdown against the Indianapolis Colts that forced overtime in a 23–17 Patriots win. In his second season, he had 20 catches for 171 yards and three touchdowns.

His career changed with the 1993 arrival of quarterback Drew Bledsoe and head coach Bill Parcells to the Patriots franchise. Parcells, known for his reliance on tight ends, frequently used then-rookie quarterback Bledsoe on passes to Coates, and the tight end led the Patriots in receptions in 1993 with 53 catches for 629 yards and eight scores, two of them in New England&#x27;s season-ending overtime win over Miami.

In 1994, his breakout year, he caught 96 passes, the most ever for a tight end to that point, breaking a record previously set by Todd Christensen in 1986 (the record was later broken by Tony Gonzalez in 2004), for 1,174 yards receiving, the only time in his career he would gain 1,000 yards in a receiving season, while also scoring seven touchdowns. He appeared in his first of five consecutive Pro Bowls.

In 1996, Coates had 62 catches for 682 yards and nine touchdowns; the most dramatic was against the New York Giants in the final game of the regular season as he caught a 12-yard pass and bulled through Giants defenders for the game-winning score of a 23–22 New England win. His efforts helped New England to a championship appearance in Super Bowl XXXI. His team lost the game, 35–21, but he had a good performance in it, leading the Patriots in receiving with 6 catches for 66 yards and a touchdown. From 1995 to 1998, he caught 84, 62, 66, and 67 passes, respectively, in those four seasons.

After the 1999 season, which saw a significant decline in production, Coates was released by the Patriots. He subsequently played for the Baltimore Ravens, where he climbed the all-time receiving charts and won Super Bowl XXXV in the process. When Coates was released by the Ravens in the following year, he decided to retire, having become the fourth all-time leading receiver at tight end in NFL history, behind Ozzie Newsome, former teammate Shannon Sharpe, and Kellen Winslow. Coates played in 158 games with 499 receptions for 5,555 yards and 50 touchdowns.

After retiring, Coates returned to Livingstone College, where he was head coach, and also coached in NFL Europe. In 2004, he served an internship with the Dallas Cowboys as an assistant for the tight ends, reuniting him with head coach Parcells. In March 2005, Coates was named the tight ends coach for the Cleveland Browns, replacing Rob Chudzinski, under head coach Romeo Crennel, who had been the defensive line coach of the Patriots while Coates was with the team.

It was announced on July 7, 2008, that Coates would be inducted into the New England Patriots Hall of Fame. During his playing days with the Patriots, Coates was a fan favorite and was given the nickname &quot;Winter&quot; (as in &quot;winter coat&quot;), in addition to Ben &quot;Technicolor Dream&quot; Coates by ESPN commentator Chris Berman.

<doc id="931286" wikidata="Q12701299" url="?curid=931286" title="National Service Training Programme (Malaysia)">
<text>The National Service Training Programme, or Program Latihan Khidmat Negara (PLKN), known locally as the Khidmat Negara (&quot;National Service&quot;) was Malaysia&#x27;s national service program under the Barisan Nasional (BN) government. The programme was handled by the National Service Training Department, or &quot;Jabatan Latihan Khidmat Negara&quot; (JLKN) under the Minister of Defence (MINDEF). The conscripts are 18-year-old youths that are selectively drafted. The three-month program, which started in December 2003, began as way to encourage friendship between youths of certain ages from different races and ethnic groups and address concerns that the country&#x27;s multi-ethnic and multi-cultural groups who were seen of &quot;becoming increasingly isolated from one another&quot;.

The program was halted for one year in 2015 due to the federal government&#x27;s efforts to cut spending. The program was reintroduced as PLKN 2.0 in 2016, with participation to be made fully optional by 2019.

On 13 August 2018, Youth and Sports Minister Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman of the new federal government under Pakatan Harapan (PH) announced that the PLKN and National Civics Bureau (BTN) programmes were abolished, as he claimed they were being used for racial indoctrination.

==History==
The national service program, first proposed in late 2002, came to committee the following year, and was finally implemented in 2004. Initial proposals envisaged drafting all youths of a certain age, but later lack of resources led to restricting the numbers of the intake. The program, planned around a two-year program, was later reduced to a year, then to six months, and then to three months.

Conscription has long been a sensitive political issue in Malaysia because of the ethnic divisions of the country. Proponents of National Service promoted bonding the youth of Malaysia together and creating a Malaysian nation, as the problem of racial polarisation was found to pervade educational institutions in Malaysia.

==Selection of conscripts==
In late December 2003, the names of 85,000 conscripts for the first National Service program was made public. The government announced that these youths were randomly selected out of the roughly 450,000 youths born in 1986, through a computerised process. Conscripts are 18 years of age and picked from a national database that includes all citizens registered with a Malaysian ID card, whether born locally or overseas. Conscripts were informed of their participation in the program by mail at the address listed on their identification card. They are also able to check their status on the program&#x27;s website, or by SMS. Lists of conscripts names and ID numbers are also published in major newspapers.

Deserters and draft dodgers are subject to punishment of a fine of up to but not exceeding RM 3000, and/or up to six months of jail. Deferrals to a later date are allowed. Exclusion from the program requires that the conscript fall under one of the following ten categories:
* Insanity
* Physically disabled
* Being held under preventive detention (such as the Internal Security Act)
* Undergoing drug rehabilitation
* Detained by the Children&#x27;s Act of 2001 (Act 612)
* disease or condition, as confirmed by a medical officer.
* Contagious disease, as confirmed by a medical officer.
* Full-time member or full-time trainee of the Malaysian Armed Forces, Royal Malaysian Police, Malaysian Fire and Rescue Department, Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency or Prisons Department of Malaysia.
* Pregnant women

Non selected civilians are also allowed to volunteer to enter the program after filling out certain forms in camps. During the first year pilot of the program, three teens from the north, Lee Poa Ting, Nyiau Kean Wei, and Goh Liang Kia expressed disappointment for not being drafted, gaining widespread attention and becoming national news. Since then, a voluntary option to participate was implemented.

===Objectives===
* Develop a young generation who are patriotic and with love and devotion for their country
* Enhance unity among the multi-racial communities in the country
* Instill a spirit of caring and volunteerism among society
* Produce an active, intelligent and confident generation
* Develop positive characteristics among the younger generation through good values
* Develop a generation that is obedient and loyal to the government

===Identity===
The program has its own theme song and logo. Conscripts are issued two pairs each of three different types of uniforms: a class uniform, a sports uniform, and a combat uniform. The combat uniform&#x27;s design is of blue camouflage stripes, made out of light blue, dark blue, white, and black. The general color scheme for the class and sports uniforms is blue, and black. Criticisms against trainees&#x27; uniforms are apparent as blue clothes are easily spotted in jungles and verdant vegetation areas except the sky and water.

===Ranks in the National Service===
Conscripts exhibiting promising leadership capabilities are promoted to rank-holders during the early course of the training. These rank-holders are entrusted with military officer-like responsibilities and authorisations throughout the remaining course of the training. The ranking system however differs slightly among camps throughout the country according to each camp commandant.

Among the ranks available are:
* Chief: Leader of all conscripts in camp. 4 stripes
* Deputy Chief: Assistant to the Chief, usually 2–3 per camp. 3 stripes
* Company Commander (CC): Also known as Squad OC (Officer-in-Command), leader of a company. Usually 1 per gender for each company. 2 stripes
* Assistant Company Commander (ACC): Also known as Company Sergeant, assistant to the CC. Usually 1–2 to each CC. 1 stripes

Other ranks (varies from camp to camp, not all camps have the following officers):
* Public Relations Officer: Normally one for each camp.
* Religious Affairs Officer: Normally one for every major religion in the camp.
* Quarter Master: Normally one for each camp.
* Sports and Recreation Officer: Normally one for each camp.
* Dorm Administrator: One for each dorm.
* Logistics Personnel: One for each camp, as liaison between conscripts and the camp logistics department.

===Modules===
The program is split into four modules:
* Physical Module (Fizikal) – Marching (Kawad), hand-to-hand combat (Tempur Tanpa Senjata, largely similar to taekwondo), Colt M16 usage, obstacle courses (Kembara Halangan), abseilling (Tali Tinggi), Flying Fox, canoeing (Kayak), camping (&quot;Wirajaya&quot;) (During Wirajaya, trainees will be also given mock missions such as: Search and rescue, night patrols, perimeter Guard, first aid and at night trainees have to guard their company flag from being stolen by instructors of other companies who would infiltrate their opponent companies&#x27; bases) Navigation (Navigasi), survival training and first aid training.
* Nation Building Module (Kenegaraan) – Classroom based. Nation&#x27;s history, sovereignty and dignity, Malaysia and international affairs, Defence and National Security and Citizen&#x27;s responsibility to the nation, and loyalty towards the current government, Barisan Nasional. The classes are based on group based training (Latihan Dalam Kumpulan).
* Character Building Module (Pembinaan Karakter) – Classroom based. It comprises 2 modules. The first one, Module A speaks about Bringing Out The Best In Me while the second module, Module B, relates to Bringing Out The Best In Others. This component is experential based and relies on games and activities as the means of teaching. It is about instilling good values and Self-confidence, leadership and self-evaluation.
* Community Service Module (Khidmat Komuniti) – Trainees are sent in groups to places in surrounding areas to give the trainees a chance to serve society. This is about building and restoring public amenities. It also teaches them environmental restoration and protection as well.

In the 2004 program, conscripts (referred to as &quot;trainees&quot; or &quot;Wira&quot; for boys and &quot;Wirawati&quot; for girls) spent 2 months in physical training camp, followed by a final month in a university setting. The program consisted of three separate, overlapping batches. The first batch of 24,000 began in mid-February and ended in the beginning of May, while the second and third batches began in March and ended in June. Trainees were divided among 79 training camps scattered all over the country. Each camp was supposed to contain a good mix of youth from different ethnic groups and locations.

===Budget and spending===
Trainees were initially given a RM300 allowance by the government. Beginning in January 2008, this amount was raised to RM150/month, or RM450 total. Trainee allowances come in the form of a Sijil Simpanan Premium (Premium Savings Certificate) from Bank Simpanan Nasional, or an account with Agro Bank Malaysia. The accounts with Agro Bank Malaysia have been criticised for taking out RM 20 from each account, for processing and ATM card fees.

According to then-Deputy Defence Minister Datuk Wira Abu Seman Yusop, RM2.37bil has been spent to finance the National Service program since it was introduced in 2004. RM608.6mil was spent in 2004, RM604.8mil in 2005, RM588.2mil in 2006 and RM565mil in 2007. Then-former Defence Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak had said earlier that the programme would not exceed RM500mil a year.

==List of National Service Training Camps==
There are many National Service training camps in every state in Malaysia. The camps are not available in the Federal Territories of Kuala Lumpur, Labuan and Putrajaya.

Initially, the program involved a two-month placement in a rural outdoor camp, followed by one month in an urban setting (a university, or sport facility). Following university complaints of vandalism, the urban setting placement was discontinued after the 2004 program. The canvas tents in the outdoor camps that housed 10 trainees each were replaced with concrete dormitories that housed 20 trainees each. Trainees are now housed at only one location throughout the duration of the program.

==Deployment==
The program was staggered into several batches (kumpulan) over the year. Collectively, all batches in a year are known as a series. Batches are known as &quot;Batch X, Series Y&quot;. For example, the pilot batch in the pilot series would be referred to as Batch 1 Series 1, while the second batch in the fifth year (2008) series would be Batch 2 Series 5.

In the 2007 program, 100,000 people were selected out of the country&#x27;s youths born in 1989. They were placed in 79 training camps, in three different batches. Each batch underwent three months of training. However, the 2007 batches did not overlap, as with the previous year&#x27;s. Instead, the three batches spanned a total of nine months. Training of the first batch started on 1 January 2007 and endem at 11 March 2007. There were delays for trainees from the East Coast due to severe flooding in the region.

Including 2008, a total of 339,186 youths have been assigned to National Service since beginning in 2004. The program was run by Jabatan Latihan Khidmat Negara (JLKN) or National Service Department, a department under the Malaysian Ministry of Defence.

==Criticism==
Despite progress towards ethnic harmony made in Malaysia in recent times it is clear that there are still problems. Outside the Human Rights Charter Contraventions, other problems are also as follows:

After the 2004 pilot batch completed its National Service, the youth wing of the Malaysian Chinese Association, Malaysia&#x27;s largest ethnic Chinese party), on behalf of themselves and 8 other Chinese-based youth organisations, issued a memorandum to the National Service Training Council calling for more non-Malay trainers. They also criticised the lack of counsellors, imbalanced diet for the participants, poor communication among the various secretariats and no code of conduct for camp commandants or directors, trainers, facilitators and supervisors.

Other main controversy issues of Malaysian National Service include the selection system where the government computer database system picks up the trainees randomly without even knowing about their social status. Some cases include poor teenagers who need to work for their living and young mothers with newborn babies who were selected for the program, which are considered as inhumane. However, selected trainees with extraneous circumstances can send a letter of appeal to be exempted from the training, which will usually be approved.

In 2005, concerns were raised in Parliament that youth were being taught to use firearms, namely M16 rifles, in National Service. Then Deputy Prime Minister, Najib Razak, stated that this was merely a pilot project. However, a Democratic Action Party Member of Parliament (MP) claimed that the Parliamentary Select Committee on Unity and National Service had not been informed of the project. The firearms module is now a module of the program.

Trainees are required to submit a health status declaration form but are not required to seek qualified medical opinion in completing this declaration (unlike, for example, United States Space Camp which requires qualified medical certification of health status). Trainees are required to complete a medical checkup before entering the program, which is provided for free at major government clinics. This medical checkup, however, is not reinforced.

===Official reception===
The program has been plagued with claims of poor management right from its inception. There have been a total of 16 trainee deaths.

When pressured by more calls to suspend the program because of a 16th death, Najib responded that it was not feasible to stop the program since &quot;many parties are involved&quot;.

== Abolishment ==
On 13 August 2018, Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman, the Youth and Sports Minister of Malaysia announced that the National Service Training Programme will be abolished with immediate effect following a series of discussion in the cabinet meetings. The decision was made in view of PLKN and BTN been misused by certain parties for misguided indoctrination. He also announced plans to draft a replacement programme that would focus on shaping visionary youths, which will also be in line with the Federal Constitution and Rukun Negara.

== Revival (NSM Return) ==
On 9 October 2023, Defence Minister Mohamad Hasan announced in parliament that the National Service would be revived, albeit at a renewed and downscaled structure. The changes include a downsizing of the number of camps throughout the country to the existing 13 army camps and one police camp, a different training scheme with a three-phase process and a lower expenditure for the program. Mohamad said that the paperwork for the revival will need to be completed and presented to the National Security Council for approval. After various studies and public reactions regarding the re-establishment of the national service, the new Minister of Defence Mohamed Khaled Nordin finally announced that the PLKN had been activated and the trial session began on 12 January 2025 with age 18 to 25 years, to be carried out in stages until June of the same year by maintaining a percentage of 70 percent military training and 30 percent national module and inviting SPM graduates who have previously joined the school uniformed cadets.

==In Popular Culture==

There have been television programs or documentaries showcasing PLKN since its establishment over 20 years ago, which includes:

*3R Season 1, a program about women that aired on Astro Ria (before its name change to TV3) in 2004
*Platun Satria, a Malay telemovie which aired on TV3 in 2009 starring Nabila Huda and Ryzal Jaafar
*Mulanya Di Sini episode 20, a story about youth who train under PLKN in Penang, which aired on RTM in 2011 and starred Meyra Liyana, Farid Wari and Zain Saidin

<doc id="931291" wikidata="Q1181118" url="?curid=931291" title="Dean Paul Martin">
<text>Dean Paul Martin Jr. (born Dino Paul Crocetti Jr.; November 17, 1951 – March 21, 1987) was an American pop singer and film and television actor. A member of the California Air National Guard, Martin died in a crash during a military training flight. He was the son of entertainer Dean Martin.

==Early life==
Martin&#x27;s parents were the singer and entertainer Dean Martin and his second wife, Jeanne Biegger. Dean Paul was the fifth of Dean Martin&#x27;s eight children and Jeanne&#x27;s eldest son. He attended the Urban Military Academy in Brentwood, California. As a youth, he was encouraged toward a singing career. 

==Career==
===Music===
At age 13, he joined Desi Arnaz Jr. and Billy Hinsche in the pop group Dino, Desi &amp; Billy, which had a few minor hits in the US in 1965, entering the &quot;Billboard&quot; U.S. top 30 twice with &quot;I&#x27;m a Fool&quot; (#17) and &quot;Not the Lovin&#x27; Kind&quot; (#25).

===Tennis===
Martin began to go by his given name of Dean Paul instead of the nickname &quot;Dino&quot; in his late teens. He became a successful tennis player who competed in the qualifying competition for Wimbledon. 

===Acting===
He co-starred with Ali MacGraw in the 1979 film &quot;Players&quot;, playing a professional tennis player, for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award as New Star of the Year – Actor. He later starred in the TV series &quot;Misfits of Science&quot;, broadcast during the 1985-1986 television season. The series co-starred Courteney Cox.

His final film appearance was in &quot;Backfire&quot;, co-starring Karen Allen and Keith Carradine, released in 1988 after Martin&#x27;s death. The film was dedicated to his memory.

===Aviation===
Martin, an avid pilot, obtained his pilot&#x27;s license at age 16 and became an officer in the California Air National Guard in 1980. He entered active duty for officer training in the U.S. Air Force under the Palace Chase program (permitting direct entry into the Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve), was commissioned as a second lieutenant and completed pilot training at Columbus AFB, Mississippi, in 1981. Following transition training in the F-4 Phantom II jet fighter at Homestead AFB, Florida, in the 308th Tactical Fighter Squadron, he was assigned to the California Air National Guard&#x27;s 196th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 163rd Tactical Fighter Group at March AFB, California, flying the F-4C Phantom II as a part-time Air National Guardsman. He eventually rose to the rank of captain.
==Death==
During a 1987 training mission from March AFB, Martin&#x27;s F-4 jet crashed in California&#x27;s San Bernardino Mountains during a snowstorm, killing him and his weapons systems officer, Captain Ramon Ortiz. Martin was 35 years old. Officials stated that Martin&#x27;s jet plunged approximately 4,000 feet from its last radar altitude reading of 9,300 feet and hit the side of the mountain at approximately 400 miles per hour. The plane&#x27;s wreckage was found on the east side of Wood Canyon in Riverside County. As per reports from Air National Guard and the Air Force, Martin may have experienced vertigo in a snowstorm and did not hear the command from the Ontario Airport controller to change directions to avoid the mountain peak.

His remains were interred at the Los Angeles National Cemetery, a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs cemetery, in Los Angeles, California.

==Personal life==
Martin married the actress Olivia Hussey in 1971. They had one child, Alexander (b. 1973), and divorced in 1978. He married the Olympic gold medalist ice skater Dorothy Hamill in 1982, and they divorced in 1984. Martin also dated Candice Bergen and Tina Sinatra.

<text>Major&#x27;s Hill Park is a park in downtown Ottawa, Ontario. The park stands above the Rideau Canal at the point where it enters the Ottawa River. The parliament buildings can be seen across the canal to the west, to the north of the park is the National Gallery of Canada, and to the east are the United States embassy and the Byward Market. To the south is the Chateau Laurier hotel, built on land that was once part of the park. 
The neighbourhood surrounding the park was once home to those who constructed the canal. In particular, the area that is now the park was the official residence of the Superintending Engineer of the Rideau Canal, Lieutenant-Colonel John By until he returned to England in 1832. The hill was known at the time as &quot;Colonel&#x27;s Hill&quot;. By was replaced in 1832 by Captain Daniel Bolton who took up residence in By&#x27;s house. In 1838 Bolton was promoted to Major. By the time he left the Bytown in 1843, the hill had become known as Major&#x27;s Hill. Commemorative plaques and a statue of Lieutenant-Colonel By, Major Bolton and their successors were erected in Major&#x27;s Hill Park.

The residence was destroyed by fire on October 5, 1848, though ruins survive to today. The use of the area as a residence means that the park has remained a green space since the early days of Ottawa. It is now managed by the National Capital Commission, which has placed historical information in the northwest corner of the park.

Due to its central location, Major&#x27;s Hill Park is frequented all year round. It is frequently used as a venue for events, and is central to Ottawa&#x27;s civic Canada Day celebrations. A more recent addition to the calendar is the annual &#x27;B In The Park&#x27;, which precedes the Glengarry Highland Games. Pipe bands and highland dancers from all over the world perform. It is presented by the Sons of Scotland Pipe Band of Ottawa, which claims to be Canada&#x27;s oldest continuous civilian pipe band.

<doc id="931301" wikidata="Q7635751" url="?curid=931301" title="Sukerchakia Misl">
<text>The Sukerchakia Misl was one of twelve Sikh misls in Punjab during the 18th century, concentrated in Gujranwala and Hafizabad districts in western Punjab (in modern-Pakistan) and ruled from (1752–1801). The misl, or grouping with its own guerilla militia (jatha), was founded by Charat Singh of Sandhawalia, grandfather of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. The last Sukerchakia Misldar (commander of the Misl) was Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Towards the end of the eighteenth century, Maharaja Ranjit Singh united all the misls and established an independent Sikh Empire.

== History ==

=== Family origin ===
The earliest traceable ancestor of the Sukerchakia family with reliable historicity was Kalu (died c.1488), a Jat of the Warraich &quot;got&quot; (clan), who moved in c.1470 from his native village of Bhatian (in modern-day Lahore district) to Sansara (or Sansi; located in modern-day Ajnala &quot;tehsil&quot;, Amritsar district, Punjab, India) with his spouse. Later-on, he would further shift his family to Sand, a village approximately six kilometres from Wazirabad. Whilst Kalu had his residence in Sansi, he gave birth to a son named Jaddoman. Jaddoman became a plunderer associated with the Sansi tribe. He died in c.1515 on a marauding expeditions and was survived by a son named Galeb (also known as Mannu). Galeb also became a plunderer and was renowned for it. He died in c.1549 and was survived by a son named Kiddoh.

=== Sukerchak village ===
Kiddoh shifted his residence from his native village to the village of Sukerchak in c.1555. The etymology of the name of the later Misl originates from the toponym of this village. The village was located approximately 3 kilometres away from Gujranwala. Kiddoh is said to have been spiritually disposed and started working on the land as an agricultural labourer. Kiddoh died in c.1578 and was survived by two sons named Rajadab and Premu. Rajadab would open a grocery store in the village, worked also as an agriculturalist, and was versed and literate in the Landa script. Rajadab died in c.1620 and left behind three sons named Nilu, Telu, and Takht Mal. Only Takht Mal survived past childhood into adulthood, whom benefited from the intergenerational wealth that was passed down to him from the hardwork of his predecessors. With this small fortune, he became a lender and eventually worked his way up to become a banker. When he died in c.1653, he was succeeded by two sons named Balu and Bara. Baru is the first ancestor of the Sukerchakia family who had associations with Sikhism, as he was a follower of the founder, Guru Nanak, and an avid reader of the &quot;Adi Granth&quot; (as it was then known). At the age of 25, he expressed a strong desire to become initiated into the religion in Amritsar (&quot;Khande-di-Pahul&quot;). However, due to an accident, he was unable to complete this mission. On his deathbed in 1679, he told his son, Budda (nicknamed Desu after his horse, Desi; born 1670; later given the baptized name of Budh Singh), to get baptized in Amritsar as a dying wish for his son to fulfil. Once he reached an age of maturity, Budda was baptized into the Khalsa order by Guru Gobind Singh himself and was renamed as Budh Singh. Budh Singh was a warrior of high repute in his time. When Budh Singh died in 1716, his wife committed suicide so they were cremated together. He was survived by two sons, Naudh Singh and Chanda Singh. Chanda was the progenitor of the Sandhawalia family of Raja Sansi.

=== Sukerchakia Jatha ===
&quot;Chaudhary&quot; Naudh Singh was the landlord of Gujranwala area that he renamed as Shukar Chak (meaning: &quot;thanks for the land&quot;). The very beginning and earliest traces of the Sukerchakia Misl can be traced to Nodha Singh constructing a minor fortress in his native village of Sukerchak, along with gathering a small &quot;jatha&quot; of 30 horsemen to protect his locality from invading Afghans. He and his group of horsemen would later join the Faizalpuria Misl of Nawab Kapur Singh in 1730. He became wealthy by pillaging the caravans of the invading Afghans and established himself as the local chieftain of Sukerchak. He was severely wounded in 1747 during a fight with Afghans after being shot in the head. 

=== Independent misl ===
At the annual Diwali meeting of the Sarbat Khalsa in Amritsar in 1748, a &quot;Gurmata&quot; was passed that reorganized the various scattered and numerous jathas into eleven organized &quot;Misls&quot;, with the Sukerchakia Misl forming out of this judgement. When Naudh died in 1752, he had four sons who survived him named Charat Singh, Dal Singh, Chet Singh, and Mangi Singh.

==== Under Charat Singh ====

Charat Singh was the eldest son of Naudh Singh, the father of Maha Singh, and the grandfather of Ranjit Singh. Charat Singh formally created the Sukerchakia Misl. He distinguished himself at an early age in campaigns against Ahmad Shah Abdali and split from the Singhpuria Misl to formally establish the Sukerchakia Misl in Gujranwala. He combined with the Mughalchak missal and extended his rule in Rohtas, Chakwal, Pind Dadan Khan which stood in the Pothohar region of northern Punjab and took Wazirabad under his control.
During the time of Charat Singh, men were only able to join the misl after having been first baptized into the Khalsa as a criterion for admission. Charat Singh rose the number of horsemen to around 150. The headquarters of the misl moved from Sukerchak village to Gujranwala after the marriage of Charat to Desan Kaur, the daughter of Amir Singh of Gujranwala, whom had been a close ally to Charat. Amir Singh was an aged but still powerful sardar.

==== Under Maha Singh ====

Then came Maha Singh (d.1792) who also expanded the Misl further. 

==== Under Ranjit Singh ====

After the decline of the Mughals, Maharaja Ranjit Singh united all the misls and shaped a powerful empire in Punjab.

<text>Pedro Cernadas (born March 20, 1972, in Viedma, Río Negro, Argentina), better known as Segundo Cernadas, is an Argentine actor and politician.

He was influenced by a show business insider to change his screen name to &quot;Segundo&quot;, the name of his favorite fictional character, the protagonist and an actor in &quot;Don Segundo Sombra&quot;.

Pablo Ponce, a well known Argentine acting instructor, was Cernadas&#x27; first professional acting teacher. Soon after, Cernadas was accepted by one of Argentina&#x27;s top show business academies.

Although Cernadas&#x27; main acting interests were in the theatrical area, soon after being accepted by the academy, he made his television debut, acting in &quot;Montana Rusa, Otra Vuelta&quot; (&quot;Rollercoaster, (let&#x27;s go) One More Time&quot;). He followed that by participating, as a married medical doctor in &quot;90-60-90 Modelos&quot;. In 1997, Cernadas made his third appearance in a telenovela, in &quot;Ricos y Famosos&quot; (&quot;Rich and Famous&quot;), which became a major international hit. 1998 was an important year in Cernadas&#x27; life: after participating in &quot;&quot; (&quot;Milady: The Story Continues)&quot;, which was the sequel to Argentine soap opera classic &quot;Milady&quot;, while considering moving to Mexico to work there, he was convinced to stay in his home country by producer Raúl Lecouna, who offered Cernadas his first starring role as a telenovela actor, in another soap that would become a major hit: &quot;Muñeca Brava&quot; (&quot;Wild Angel&quot;). This soap opera was successful and that Cernadas travelled across Argentina, and many other countries, to relive his character at various acting venues for the next two years.

In 2000, he played the role of &quot;Bebo&quot; in &quot;Los Buscas de Siempre&quot; (&quot;The (same) Bullies of Always)&quot;. Later on that year, he would once again play a doctor, in &quot;Los Medicos de Hoy&quot; (&quot;Today&#x27;s Doctors&quot;).Cernadas would not become a major international super-star until 2002, when he flew to Peru to act in &quot;Bésame Tonto&quot; (&quot;Kiss me, Fool&quot;), alongside Gianella Neyra. The soap opera, which featured romantic, family and mafia twists, became the number one show in many countries, such as the Dominican Republic, Chile, and Panama. In 2003, he participated in &quot;Dr. Amor&quot; (&quot;Dr. Love&quot;) . By 2004, Univision began to show &quot;Bésame Tonto&quot; in the United States; and Cernadas became the first Argentine actor to star in a Philippine telenovela, when he went to Manila to participate and team-up with Iza Calzado in &quot;Te Amo, Maging Sino Ka Man&quot; (&quot;I Love You, Whoever You Are&quot;).

In 2005 he returned to Argentina and worked at &quot;Amor en custodia&quot; (2005) and &quot;Se dice amor&quot; (2006).

== Political career ==

In 2015 he ventured into politics, and was elected councilor for the city of Tigre.

In 2015, while serving as councilor, he was appointed as head of the ANSES for Tigre, generating strong controversy due to his lack of experience. There were allegations of nepotism involved with the appointment. He later resigned from the city council to head the agency.

In 2017, he led the list for councilors for Cambiemos in the city of Tigre. In 2019, he ran for mayor. In 2021, while also regaining his council seat, he was elected president of the Honorable Deliberative Council of Tigre.  ​.

<doc id="931308" wikidata="Q550653" url="?curid=931308" title="Max Wright">
<text>George Edward &quot;Max&quot; Wright (August 2, 1943 – June 26, 2019) was an American actor, known for his role as Willie Tanner on the sitcom &quot;ALF&quot; (1986–1990).

==Early life==
Wright was born August 2, 1943, in Detroit, Michigan, as George Edward Wright. He took the nickname &quot;Max&quot; as other actors were already known as George Wright.

He moved to the suburb of Southfield as a child, graduating from Southfield Senior High School in 1961. While a student at Southfield, he was very active in the theatre program and had leads in two different musical productions.

==Career==
===Film and television===
Wright made supporting appearances on television shows such as &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati,&quot; and was a regular cast member on &quot;Misfits of Science&quot;, &quot;AfterMASH&quot;, &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot;, and &quot;The Norm Show&quot;, and the made-for-TV adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Stand&quot;. He appeared in the first and second seasons of the sitcom &quot;Friends&quot; as Terry, the manager of Central Perk. He played Günter Wendt in the 1998 HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; and Dr. Josef Mengele in &quot;Playing for Time&quot;.

====&quot;ALF&quot;====
From 1986 to 1990, Wright appeared in the sitcom &quot;ALF&quot; as Willie Tanner, a typical father of a middle-class family, who finds an alien who has crash-landed on Earth. Despite becoming his best-known performance, the actor despised the role due to its huge technical demands and the fact that he, a human, played a supporting character for an &quot;inanimate object&quot;. &quot;It was hard work and very grim&quot;, he stated in a 2000 interview to &quot;People&quot;. He was also, reportedly, very happy when the show was canceled in 1990. &quot;I was hugely eager to have it over with&quot;, he said in the same interview. According to his co-star in the show, Anne Schedeen, &quot;there was one take, and Max walked off the set, went to his dressing room, got his bags, went to his car, and disappeared. Nobody had to say, &#x27;Wrap,&#x27; and there were no goodbyes&quot;. However, Wright later admitted that as the years passed he looked back at &quot;ALF&quot; with less animosity and conceded that &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter what I felt or what the days were like, &quot;ALF&quot; brought people a lot of joy.&quot;

===Stage===
Wright also had a stage career. In 1968, he appeared in the original production of &quot;The Great White Hope&quot; at the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C. In 1998, he appeared on Broadway in &quot;Ivanov&quot;, which garnered him a Tony nomination, and played Sir Andrew in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. In 2007, he acted at the JET (Jewish Ensemble Theatre) in Detroit and in the production of &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; at the American Repertory Theater. He also appeared in The Public Theater&#x27;s 2010 production of &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; and &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; at Shakespeare in the Park festivals.

==Personal life==
Wright was married to Linda Ybarrondo from 1965 until her death from breast cancer in 2017. The couple had two children.

==Death==
In 1995, he was diagnosed with lymphoma, which was successfully treated and remained in remission until 2019. He died from the disease on June 26, 2019, at the age of 75 at the Lillian Booth Actors Home in Englewood, New Jersey.

<text>Thomas James Snyder (May 12, 1936 – July 29, 2007) was an American television personality, news anchor, and radio personality best known for his late night talk shows &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, on NBC in the 1970s and 1980s, and &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, on CBS in the 1990s. Snyder was also the pioneer anchor of the prime time &quot;NBC News Update&quot;, in the 1970s and early 1980s, which was a one-minute capsule of news updates.

==Early life==
Snyder was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Frank and Marie Snyder, who were of German, Dutch, and Irish descent. He received a Roman Catholic upbringing, attending St. Agnes Elementary School and graduating from Jesuit-run Marquette University High School. He then attended Marquette University, after which he had originally planned to study medicine and become a doctor. He graduated in 1959 with a major in journalism.

==Newscasting career==
Snyder loved radio since he was a child and at some point he changed his field of study from pre-med to journalism. He once told &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot; reporter Tim Cuprisin that broadcasting became more important to him than attending classes, and he skipped a lot of them. Snyder began his career as a radio reporter at WRIT-AM (unrelated to the present-day FM station) in Milwaukee, now WJYI-AM and at WKZO in Kalamazoo (where he was fired by John Fetzer) in the 1950s. For a time he worked at Savannah, Georgia, AM station WSAV (now WBMQ).

Snyder moved into television in the 1960s; he talked about driving cross-country in an early Corvair from Atlanta to Los Angeles around 1963. After a year-long stint in a news job at KTLA, he became a news anchor for KYW-TV (now WKYC-TV) in Cleveland in 1964. In 1965, when Westinghouse Broadcasting moved KYW-TV back to Philadelphia as the result of an FCC ruling, Snyder went along and remained in Philadelphia for five years.

In July 1970, Snyder returned to Los Angeles and joined NBC News, who assigned him to anchor the 6:00 pm (Pacific time) weeknight newscast on KNBC. Snyder remained in this capacity even after NBC launched the &quot;Tomorrow&quot; show with him as host in October 1973, working alongside Tom Brokaw, Jess Marlow and Paul Moyer at the KNBC anchor desk. Another KNBC broadcaster, Kelly Lange, later became Snyder&#x27;s regular substitute guest host on the &quot;Tomorrow&quot; program, prior to the hiring of co-host Rona Barrett in the program&#x27;s last year. Snyder moved to New York City in late 1974, taking the &quot;Tomorrow&quot; program with him and kept his hand in news, anchoring weeknight newscasts on WNBC-TV until 1977, and Sunday broadcasts of &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; during 1975 and 1976.

Snyder returned to local news in 1982 after ending &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, to become an anchor at WABC-TV in New York City. In 1985, he returned to Los Angeles but stayed with ABC, to anchor at KABC-TV.

==&quot;Tomorrow with Tom Snyder&quot;==

Snyder gained national fame as the host of &quot;Tomorrow with Tom Snyder&quot; (more commonly known as &quot;The Tomorrow Show)&quot;, which aired late nights after &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on NBC from 1973 to 1982. It was a talk show unlike the usual late-night fare, with Snyder, cigarette in hand, alternating between asking hard-hitting questions and offering personal observations that made the interview seem more like a conversation.
Unique one-on-one exchanges were common to the program, notably with John Lennon in 1975, John Lydon of PiL and the Sex Pistols in 1980, Charles Manson in 1981, actor and writer Sterling Hayden, author Harlan Ellison, and author and philosopher Ayn Rand. A one-on-one program with David Brenner as the sole guest revealed that Snyder and Brenner worked together on several documentaries. In 1981, &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic had his first appearance on national TV performing &quot;Another One Rides the Bus&quot;.

An infamous edition of &quot;The Tomorrow Show&quot; broadcast on October 31, 1979, saw Snyder interview the rock group KISS. During the episode, a visibly irritated Gene Simmons (bass) and Paul Stanley (guitar) tried to contain the bombastic (and drunk) Ace Frehley (lead guitar), whose nonstop laughter and joking overshadowed the rest of the band. Snyder and Peter Criss (drummer) were obviously enjoying it though, chiming in with several jokes, much to Frehley&#x27;s delight, and Simmons&#x27; disgust. Criss made repeated references to his large gun collection, to the chagrin of Simmons. Some of the footage from this show was later included on the &quot;Kissology—The Ultimate KISS Collection&quot; Vol. 2: 1978–1991 (2007) DVD.

In the late 1970s Snyder interviewed Disney animator Ward Kimball regarding his toy train collection and his full-size trains. Snyder appeared to be as happy as a &quot;kid in a candy store,&quot; picking up various locomotives and asking lots of questions. Snyder&#x27;s love of toy trains started with his first Lionel locomotive, a scale steam switcher, which he claimed never worked too well. His collection was later donated to a New Jersey toy train club, the NJ Hi-Railers.

When not grilling guests, Snyder would often joke around with offstage crewmen, often breaking out in the distinctively hearty laugh that was the basis of Dan Aykroyd&#x27;s impersonation of Snyder on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (12 occasions, 1976–79 and 1995). Following a disastrous experiment with turning &quot;Tomorrow&quot; into a more typical talk show—renaming it &quot;Tomorrow Coast to Coast&quot; and adding a live audience and co-host Rona Barrett (all of which Snyder resented)—the show was canceled in fall 1981, to make way for the up-and-coming young comedian David Letterman, after Snyder turned down moving to the 1:30 to 2:30 am time slot after Letterman.

==After &quot;Tomorrow&quot;==
In 1982 Snyder joined WABC-TV in New York, anchoring the 5 pm &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; program with Kaity Tong. He stayed at WABC for two years, then returned to the talk format in 1985 at KABC-TV in Los Angeles with a local afternoon show. He had hoped to syndicate the program nationally the following year, but those plans were scratched after Oprah Winfrey&#x27;s Chicago-based syndicated show entered the market first, and took over Snyder&#x27;s time slot on KABC-TV.

In 1988 Snyder inaugurated a similar three-hour program on ABC Radio. The first hour was spent chatting with a celebrity guest; during the second hour Snyder engaged someone in the news; and the final hour was consumed chatting with his legion of fans. Occasionally the caller would be a well-known fan like David Letterman or Ted Koppel. One of Snyder&#x27;s favorite callers was Sherman Hemsley, the actor who played George Jefferson on the hit television sitcom &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;. The &quot;Tom Snyder Show&quot; for ABC Radio Networks went off the air in late 1992.

Snyder returned to television on CNBC on January 21, 1993, adding the opportunity for viewers to call in with their own questions for his guests. Snyder nicknamed his show the Colorcast, reviving an old promotional term NBC-TV used in the early 1960s to brand its color broadcasts. He also continued his trademark of talking to offscreen crew and made frequent reference to the studio, reminding viewers of its location in Fort Lee, New Jersey. The final CNBC show aired on December 1, 1994.

==&quot;The Late Late Show with Tom Snyder&quot;==
Meanwhile, Letterman had moved on to CBS and was given control of creating a new program to follow his at 12:35 am. Letterman, who had idolized Snyder for years, hired Snyder in 1994 as host of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;; the announcement was made by Letterman and CBS president Howard Stringer on August 9 that Snyder&#x27;s show would begin on January 9, 1995. The idea had actually begun as a running joke on Letterman&#x27;s show that Snyder would soon follow him on the air as he had once followed Johnny Carson on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;; the unlikely suggestion caught on. As part of the joke, Snyder appeared as himself in 1993 in &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot; episode &quot;Life Behind Larry,&quot; in which talk-show host Sanders (Garry Shandling) steals Snyder from Letterman to host a talk-show in the slot immediately after his.

&quot;The Late Late Show with Tom Snyder&quot; aired live in the Eastern and Central Time Zones, and was simulcast to other time zones on radio to allow everyone a chance to call in. Snyder&#x27;s CNBC show was taken over, largely unchanged in format, by Charles Grodin. One of the many interviews conducted on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; was with Gloria Vanderbilt about her son&#x27;s suicide, told dramatically over an entire hour. Another was a lengthy interview with Robert Blake very soon before Blake was charged with murder. When Snyder took ill with the flu, comedians Martin Mull and Jon Stewart filled in as hosts. Snyder&#x27;s final &quot;Late Late Show&quot; aired on March 26, 1999. It was then reformatted for his successor Craig Kilborn, as a more traditional late night show with an audience, comic monologue, comedy segments, shorter interviews, and a greater emphasis on guests from the entertainment industry. Scottish comedian Craig Ferguson maintained a similar format when he succeeded Kilborn in 2005, though Ferguson cited Snyder as an influence in his interview style, and even experimented with an audience-less episode, in the style of Snyder&#x27;s tenure, on February 23, 2010.

After stepping down from &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, Snyder was offered a news anchor position with KCBS-TV in Los Angeles, but he declined to join the station. In February 2000, Snyder hosted two episodes of &quot;The Late Show Backstage&quot; that aired in &quot;The Late Show&quot; time slot when Letterman was recovering from heart surgery.

Snyder also hosted a documentary for TM Books &amp; Video called &quot;A Century of Lionel Electric Trains&quot;, commemorating 100 years of Lionel Trains covering Lionel from 1900 to 2000. Part 1 featuring Lionel history from 1900 to 1945 and Part 2 featuring Lionel history from 1945 to 2000. Additionally, he hosted another program by TM Books &amp; Video called &quot;Celebrity Train Layouts Part 2: Tom Snyder&quot;, featuring his own collection of trains.

==Colortini.com==
Snyder posted regular messages on his own now-defunct website colortini.com during the early 2000s. A &quot;colortini,&quot; according to Snyder in the CNBC era, was the drink you should enjoy while watching the show (&quot;Fire up a colortini, sit back, relax, and watch the pictures, now, as they fly through the air.&quot;). For the CBS show, he redubbed the mythical drink a &quot;simultini&quot; as his show was also heard on selected radio stations.

On July 28, 2005, Snyder announced he was deleting his website after six years, stating: &quot;The novelty of communicating this way has worn off.&quot; On August 1, 2005, his page was abruptly taken offline. The front page was replaced with a white screen with the simple phrase: &quot;Colortini is gone. Thanks for the Memories.&quot; However, some have been preserved. The domain name has since been reused for other purposes.

==Personal life==

In addition to being an avid model train collector, Snyder was also a car buff. On his radio and television programs, he would occasionally talk about current cars he owned as well as cars from the 1950s and 1960s he admired or owned in his teens and twenties. When Snyder left &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; in 1999, David Letterman gave him a white 1960 Cadillac Series 62 convertible as a going-away present.

==Final years and death==
In April 2005, Snyder revealed that he had been diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In June 2006, he sold his home in the Benedict Canyon area of Los Angeles, where he had lived for almost 30 years, and relocated to Belvedere, in the San Francisco Bay Area, where he owned a second home.

Snyder died of complications from leukemia on July 29, 2007, in San Francisco at the age of 71.

==Legacy==
Snyder was posthumously inducted into the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia Hall of Fame in 2008.

He is played by Ed Helms in &quot;A Futile and Stupid Gesture&quot;.

<text>Bình Định is a northern coastal province in the South Central Coast region, the Central of Vietnam. It borders Quảng Ngãi to the north, Phú Yên to the south, Gia Lai to the west and the South China Sea to the east.

Bình Định province has an area of , comprising 11 district-level sub-divisions, with a population of over 1.5 million people as of 2023. The province is known for its scenery and beaches. There are also a number of Cham structures. Majority of the province is covered by mountains or hills. Its capital Quy Nhon served as the capital of the historic Tây Sơn dynasty. Economically the province has the most productive primary sector in the South Central Coast region, mostly because of its large output of rice, coconuts and its strong livestock, forestry and fishing sectors.

==History==
===Champa===
Bình Định was probably one of the places where the Cham first arrived in what is now Vietnam. Its favourable geography led to the rise of the Cham Port of Thị Nại where Quy Nhơn is now located. The city-state of Vijaya was located around this port and the main city, which was further inland. Its centre was in the southern lowland of Bình Định. However, its architecture implies that it did not become important until the eleventh or twelfth century.
Vijaya&#x27;s architecture also distinguishes it from other Champa centers, since it used a combination of stone and brick elements, while most other Cham structures only used bricks. This suggests some influence from Cambodian Angkor. It also points to the relative abundance of labour in Vijaya compared to other Champa centres of power, because processing stones for construction was more labour-intensive than the production of bricks. 
Vijaya was involved in various wars with neighbouring countries. Major wars were fought with Angkor (now Cambodia) in the 12th and 13th centuries. Around this time Vijaya seems to have been associated with, and at times even dominated by, the Khmer King Jayavarman VII. Major wars with Vietnam were fought in 1069 and again in the 15th century, which eventually led to the defeat of Vijaya and the demise of Champa in 1471.

=== Tây Sơn Dynasty ===
The Tây Sơn dynasty originated from Binh Dinh, being named after Tây Sơn district where the rulers had come from. The capital of Quy Nhon served as their capital until the Vietnamese Civil War of 1789–1802, when the province was wracked by warfare and the dynasty collapsed.

Its Sino-Vietnamese name (chữ Hán: ) translates as &quot;pacified&quot; or &quot;subjugated&quot;.

==Geography==
===Topography===

The majority of Bình Định province is covered by mountains or hills. Elevations range from 0 at the coast to around 1200 meters above sea level in An Lão district in the north-west of the province. While most of the mountains as well as the highest peaks are in the west, there are mountains throughout the province, even near the coast. Most districts of Bình Định have a topography that is a mix of mountains or hills and lowlands. The districts of An Lão in the north-west, Vĩnh Thạnh in the west, and Vân Canh in the south-west are mostly mountainous. All other districts have some lowlands.

The largest lowland area is located in the south of the province along the lower Côn River. It encompasses much of Quy Nhon, the districts of Tuy Phước, An Nhơn, the western part of Phù Cát, and the eastern part of Tây Sơn. Given its size, and the access to a major port as well as Bình Định&#x27;s major river, it has long been the place where most of Bình Định&#x27;s people and economic activities concentrate. It was the site of Vijaya, one of the major city-states of Champa. The majority of Bình Định&#x27;s population lives in the districts around this plain.

Other lowland areas are located in the coastal districts of Hoài Nhơn, Phù Mỹ, Phù Cát, as well as the inland district of Hoài Ân. There are some hills or mountains near the coast in all of the coastal provinces, with the highest peak in Phù Cát at 874m (Ba mountain, núi Bà) and in Phù Mỹ at 602m.

Mountains form natural borders to the neighbouring provinces. Cù Mông pass (đèo Cù Mông) is the main border crossing to Phú Yên province. National Route 1 passes through this pass, while there is another road (1D) along the coast. The border to Gia Lai province is the most mountainous, with the only road connection at An Khê pass (đèo An Khê) between the towns of Phú Phong in Tây Sơn district and An Khê in Gia Lai. The border to Quảng Ngãi province is also very mountainous, with the major road and railway passing through Bình Đê Pass (đèo Bình Đê) near Tam Quan.

===Hydrography===
Côn River is the largest and most important river in Bình Định. It forms a small delta north of Quy Nhon. Most of it can be used as an inland waterway for transportation. This is probably one of the reasons why a major centre of power of Champa emerged along this river. Other rivers are Lại Giang River at the centre of the lowland areas of Hoài Nhơn and Hoài Ân in northern Bình Định, Mỹ Cát River in central Bình Định, and Hà Thanh River along the valley in Vân Canh district in southern Bình Định.

The largest lake is Định Bình Lake, an artificial lake mainly used for irrigation in the highlands of western Bình Định. Also in western Bình Định is Vĩnh Sơn Lake (hồ Vĩnh Sơn) at Vĩnh Sơn Hydropower Station. Other major lakes include Núi Một Lake (hồ Núi Một) in the south and Hội Sơn Lake (hồ Hội Sơn) in the centre of the province.

===Mineral resources===
Ilmenite reserves in Phù Cát and graphite reserves in northern Bình Định are substantial and support significant local export industries. There is also some gold in western Bình Định.

==Administrative divisions==

Bình Định is subdivided into 11 district-level sub-divisions:

* 8 districts:

:* An Lão
:* Hoài Ân
:* Phù Cát
:* Phù Mỹ
:* Tuy Phước
:* Tây Sơn
:* Vân Canh
:* Vĩnh Thạnh

* 2 district-level town:
** An Nhơn (recently upgraded from district status)
** Hoài Nhơn
* 1 provincial city:
** Quy Nhon (capital)

They are further subdivided into 12 commune-level towns (or townlets), 115 communes, and 28 wards.

==Economy==
With a gross domestic product per capita of 9.57 million đồngs in 2007, Bình Định is ranked fourth out of eight provinces and cities in the South Central Coast. While being significantly behind the main success stories of the region, namely Da Nang and Khánh Hòa province, it is more developed than most other provinces in the region. It has been benefiting from its strategic position as one of the main gateways to the Central Highlands and its port. It is the region&#x27;s third-largest industrial center (mainly based on furniture manufacturing) and also has strong agricultural, forestry, livestock, and fishing sectors.

In 2007 Bình Định exported goods worth US$327.3 million, while importing goods worth US$141.6 million. Most of the province&#x27;s exports are furniture.

===Agriculture, forestry, fishing===

Bình Định has the most productive primary sector (agriculture, fishery, forestry) in the South Central Coast region, mostly because of its large output of rice, coconuts and its strong livestock, forestry and fishing sectors. It contributes roughly 23% of sector 1 GDP and rice output of the South Central Coast (while it has 17.7% of the region&#x27;s population). The rice harvest is the largest of the South Central Coast region but accounts only for a modest 1.62% of the national output. It has been fluctuating around 600,000t over the last few years. The average yield is 53.1t/ha as of 2009 with the highest yields around the lower Côn River.

The province&#x27;s output of coconuts (95,040t) accounts for 9% of the national total as of 2007. Other significant crops include peanuts (13.7kt, 2.71%), cashew nuts (4.2kt, 1.39%), and sugar cane (185.7kt, 1.07%). Coconuts are planted mostly in the districts of Hoài Nhơn (30kt in 2009), Phù Mỹ (27kt), Phù Cát (16.4kt), and Hoài Ân (15.7kt).

The livestock sector makes up 35% of the agricultural gross output, a relatively high value compared to other provinces. Bình Định is by far the largest producer of pork, both in terms of total output and per capita output (over 50 kg per capita). As of 2009, there were 684,300 pigs, 288,400 cows, 18,900 buffaloes, 3 million chickens and 2 million other poultry.

Bình Định has a large fishing sector. Its gross output contributes one fifth of the South Central Coast&#x27;s total, ranking second after Khánh Hòa province (as of 2007). In 2009 gross output was 3.97 trillion VND or 137,466t. In contrast to Khánh Hòa, the vast majority of this was contributed by sea fishing, with only a small share (11.1%) from aquaculture. As of 2009, 61,900 people were employed in fishing, compared to 481,200 in agriculture and forestry.

===Industry===
Bình Định has transformed itself into a regional center of furniture manufacturing. The industry has been successful in creating large numbers of jobs, with furniture manufacturing enterprises employing around 40,000 workers and manufacturing in total around 107,000, making Bình Định leading in the South Central Coast in terms of industrial employment. More than two thirds of the province&#x27;s gross industrial output is produced in Quy Nhơn, which is the region&#x27;s third-largest industrial center after Da Nang and Nha Trang. Phu Tai Industrial Park is central to Bình Định&#x27;s industry in general and the furniture industry in particular. Several chemical enterprises that supply the furniture and wood processing industry have been set up in the vicinity of the industrial park.

The largest industries after furniture manufacturing (5290.8 billion VND in 2009) in terms of gross output are food products and beverages (2770.5 billion), non-metallic mineral products (938.4 billion), wood processing (843.6 billion), and chemical products (755.1 billion). The latter includes not only companies supporting the furniture industry, but also a pharmaceutical industry, the most significant company of which is Bidiphar, a local state-owned enterprise. Smaller manufacturing sectors include garments, paper, leather, plastics and rubber products.

Nhơn Hội Economic Zone is under construction, but behind schedule (as of September 2010).

==Infrastructure and transport==

===Transport infrastructure===
Bình Định&#x27;s infrastructure has been significant for its economic development. It has traditionally been the site of a major port and the intersection of two national roads has further increased Bình Định&#x27;s role as a gateway to the Central Highlands and access to the latter&#x27;s resources. As a result, the province has received one of the highest infrastructure scores in the Provincial Competitiveness Index 2009, second only to Da Nang in central Vietnam.

====Roads====

There are national roads with a total length of 208 km and provincial roads a total length of 458.5 km. National Route 1 runs through the province from north to south with a length of 118 km, connecting the eastern districts of Hoài Nhơn, Phù Mỹ, Phù Cát, An Nhơn, and Tuy Phước to much of the rest of Vietnam. A branch of it – National Route 1D – connects the provincial capital Quy Nhon to 1A and Sông Cầu in Phú Yên province. 20 km of 1D&#x27;s 33 km are in Bình Định. National Road 19 runs from Quy Nhơn Port through northern Quy Nhơn, the towns of Tuy Phước, Phú Phong to An Khê, Pleiku and Lệ Thanh border gate in Gia Lai province. This direct link from Quy Nhon to the Central Highlands and the border to Cambodia has been important for Bình Định&#x27;s role as a gateway to the highlands and its industrial development, since especially the wood processing and furniture industry has relied on raw materials from the highlands, Cambodia and Laos. 70 km of National Route 19 are located in Bình Định.

74.6 percent of roads in Bình Định (including national, provincial, and district roads) are paved, which is relatively good by Vietnamese standards and significantly above the median province with 51.44 percent. However, the assessment of road quality by the local business community is not very good, with only 34.76 percent stating that roads are in good or very good condition.

Road transport is by far the most important mode of transport within the province. It accounts for between 97 and just under 100 percent of passenger and freight movements. 22.77 million passengers and 7928 tons of cargo were transported by road in 2009.

====Railways====
The North–South Railway in Bình Định has a length of 134 km. All Reunification Express trains stop at Diêu Trì Railway Station. Quy Nhơn Railway Station is around 10 km east of the main railway. It is served by a daily train from Quy Nhơn to Saigon Railway Station and a train three times a week from Quy Nhon to Vinh Railway Station. Tam Quan Railway Station, located along North–South Railway in Hoài Nhơn district, is frequented by only a few trains, such as the train to Vinh.

====Water transport====

Much of Côn River – almost up to the border in Vĩnh Thạnh district with Gia Lai province – and a small stretch of Lai Giang River up to Bồng Sơn in Hoài Nhơn district – are inland waterways and can be used for transportation. There has been a significant change in the use of inland waterways away from passengers and towards freight traffic between 2006 and 2008. The number of passengers decreased from 113,000 in 2006 to 42,000 in 2007 and 7,000 in 2008 and 2009, while freight transport on inland – apparently almost non-existent until 2008 – has accounted for 10 tons and around 70 tons km in 2008 and 2009, respectively. This is, however, still minuscule compared to other modes of transportation within the province. Maritime transport within the province has shown a declining trend in recent years and was at 171 tons and 31,000 passengers in 2009. The two main ports of the province – Quy Nhơn Port and Thị Nại Port – are both located in Quy Nhon. In 2009 they had a combined freight turnover of 4,500 tons, with 30,856 tons handled by Quy Nhon port, including 2016 tons of exported goods (mainly processed wood, furniture and stones). Thị Nại Port, in contrast, mostly handles domestic trade. The volume of cargo handled has increased by more than 50 percent between 2005 and 2009.

====Ownership structure====
While Vietnam Railways and the major seaports are owned and operated by the state sector, almost none of the local transport is state-run. Household businesses are dominant in the passenger sector, accounting for more than 70 percent of passengers and passenger kilometers over the last few years – although their share has been decreasing. The other traditionally significant enterprise form have been collective enterprises. Their share has been decreasing, too, while private sector participation has been increasing from a very low base since 2008. As of 2009, the share of the collective sector (11.8 percent) is still slightly ahead of the private sector (11.6 percent), but it has been clearly overtaken in terms of passenger km, with shares of 5.4 and 23.3 percent, respectively. The freight transport sector is dominated by the household and private sector. While household businesses take the lead in freight volume (54.8 percent compared to 41.4 percent), private companies have a larger share if distance travelled (tons.km) is considered (50 percent compared to 43.4 percent). Both private and household businesses have been able to grow and increase their share in recent years, mainly at the expense of the declining collective sector.

===Telecommunication===
In 2009, there were 74.1 telephone subscribers per 100 inhabitants. The total number of subscriptions in the province was 1.1 million – a rapid increase from the 101,230 in 2005, most of which was contributed by mobile phones. The calling time has also increased rapidly in the same period, from 53 to 488 million minutes. The quality of telecommunications has received relatively good assessments, with 70.74 percent of respondents to a survey stating that it is good or very good. As of 2009, there were 28,919 Internet subscribers in Bình Định, up from 18,260 in 2008 and 8,716 in 2006. While telephones and Internet connections have become much more widespread, the number of letters and money telegrams sent has decreased from 119,000 in 2005 to 77,421 in 2009 and telegram services have been discontinued after 2007.

==Demography==
Bình Định had a population of 1.486.918 on April 1, 2019.It has been growing slowly from 2000 to 2007 – at just 0.92% per year on average. As of 2009, 27.8% of the population live in urban areas, up from 19% in 1995 and 24.2% in 2000. More than 40% of the total population is concentrated in Quy Nhon and the two suburban districts of An Nhơn and Tuy Phước. There is another relatively large concentration in the northern Hoài Nhơn district with a population of 206,700 (2009) and a population density of 499/km2. Population density per km2 in the rest of the province range from 30 to 40 in Vân Canh, An Lão, and Vĩnh Thạnh to 982 in Quy Nhon.

The eastern lowlands and Tây Sơn district are largely ethnically homogeneous. There are minorities of Bahnar people in the sparsely populated districts of An Lão, Vĩnh Thạnh and Vân Canh. Some H&#x27;re people live in An Lão and some Cham in Vân Canh. Hoài Ân&#x27;s population is mostly Kinh, but there are some remote communes that are dominated by Bahnar and H&#x27;re people.

<text>Heckscher State Park is a state park on the shore of the Great South Bay at East Islip in Suffolk County, New York, USA.

==History==
The park includes that was once the 19th-century estates of George C. Taylor and J. Neal Plum. Islip&#x27;s founder, William Nicoll, originally built his estate on this property. The Long Island State Park Commission, led by Robert Moses, expropriated the property in 1924, an action found to be illegal by the state&#x27;s highest court on the grounds that the law did not permit such expropriation when the Commission did not have the funds to pay for the property; however, in the meantime, the Commission had retained control of the property. Despite opposition from wealthy local residents, the parkland was finally purchased by New York State with the aid of a donation from August Heckscher. The park officially opened in February 1929.

Beginning in 1972 and continuing until 2008, the New York Philharmonic played at Heckscher State Park as part of its free &quot;Concerts in the Parks&quot; series. The annual event was held on summer evenings in an open field near the campground and was open to the public. In 2009, the New York Philharmonic chose to cancel the event for the summer of that year due to financial constraints. After one year without a concert at the park, the Long Island Philharmonic was able to put on a successful performance in 2010. The new generation of concerts commenced with a theme of American composers, including George Gershwin, Leonard Bernstein, John Philip Sousa, John Williams, and Billy Joel.

==Park description==

Heckscher offers a beach, picnic tables with pavilions, a playground, playing fields and a disc golf course, recreation programs, hiking and biking, fishing, cross-country skiing, a boat launch, and a food concession. It includes the Heckscher Forest, a dedicated disc golf course established in the summer of 2014. The park formerly offered a campground with tent and trailer sites, as well as an Olympic-sized swimming pool, which were closed due to budget cuts.

Heckscher State Park is known as the &quot;Home of the White-tailed Deer&quot;, as deer are fairly populous throughout the park. Additionally, about 280 bird species can be observed in the park.

The park is accessible by the Heckscher State Parkway, and falls within the district protected by the Great River Fire Department.

The Long Island Greenbelt Trail starts its route in Heckscher State Park. It ends in Sunken Meadow State Park.

<text>Zhang Jun (; born November 26, 1977, in Suzhou, Jiangsu) is a former male badminton player from the People&#x27;s Republic of China. He is now a coach with the Chinese national team following his retirement as an international player.

==Career==
As a doubles specialist, the solidly built Zhang Jun won several international men&#x27;s doubles titles with compatriot Zhang Wei including the Swiss (1998), China (2001), and Thailand (2005) Opens. However, the majority of his titles, and the most prestigious ones, came in mixed doubles when he teamed up with the formidable Gao Ling. These included consecutive gold medals at the 2000 and 2004 Olympic Games, earned by surviving a number of very close matches, particularly in 2000 when they were on the verge of elimination in the semifinals. In a similar fashion, Zhang and Gao captured the 2001 IBF World Championships by squeezing past the brilliant South Korean duo Kim Dong-moon and Ra Kyung-min 17-16 in the third game. Zhang&#x27;s other titles with Gao include three victories (2001, 2003, and 2006) at the prestigious All-England Championships; the Badminton Asia Championships in 2002; the China Masters in 2005; and the China (2002, 2003), Japan (2003), Indonesia (2004), Malaysia (2004, 2006), Thailand (2005), Singapore (2005), and German (2006) Opens.

Zhang had the honor of being an Olympic torch carrier at the opening ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Games.

After retirement, Zhang Jun coached the Chinese national badminton team. He was promoted to head coach of the national badminton doubles team in 2017, before being selected as vice chairman of the Chinese Badminton Association (CBA) in 2018.

On January 28, 2019, Zhang Jun was elected as the chairman of Chinese Badminton Association.

Zhang Jun, as president of the Chinese Badminton Association, competed with Khunying Patama, his counterpart from the Badminton Association of Thailand and Anton Aditya Subowo, president of Badminton Asia, for the position of BWF deputy president but lost; Patama was elected deputy president in May 2019, during the Sudirman Cup tournament in Nanning, China.

==Personal life==
Zhang Jun married synchronised swimmer Hu Ni in 2006. Their son was born in 2009. (Zhang Jun&#x27;s former doubles partner Cai Yun, whom he later also coached, married Hu Ni&#x27;s teammate Wang Na in 2010.)

<doc id="931331" wikidata="Q12124503" url="?curid=931331" title="Ghostwatch">
<text>Ghostwatch is a British mockumentary supernatural horror television film, first broadcast on BBC1 on Halloween night, 1992. Written by Stephen Volk, and directed by Lesley Manning, the drama was produced for the BBC anthology series &quot;Screen One&quot; by Richard Broke, Ruth Baumgarten and Derek Nelson. Despite having been recorded weeks in advance, the narrative was presented as live television. During and following its first and only UK television broadcast, the show attracted a considerable furor, resulting in an estimated 1,000,000 phone call enquiries to the BBC switchboard on the night of broadcast, comprising a mixture of complaints and praise for the programme&#x27;s unique presentation. This outrage is often compared to Orson Welles&#x27; 1938 &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; radio broadcast and the 1994 &quot;Without Warning&quot; television film, both of which also allegedly caused nationwide panic in the United States.

&quot;Ghostwatch&quot; has never been repeated on UK television. It has been repeated internationally, on stations such as the Canadian digital channel Scream for Halloween 2004, and the Belgian channel Canvas in 2008. It became available on the American streaming video service Shudder in 2017, and it was made available on the Internet Archive the same year. There have been three UK home video releases. In 2002, the British Film Institute released a 10th Anniversary edition on VHS and DVD, and 101 Films issued a DVD release in 2011 and a 30th Anniversary Blu-ray release in 2022. In 2016, the BBC Store made the film available as part of the &quot;Frightmares&quot; collection, marking Halloween.

A retrospective documentary, &quot;Ghostwatch: Behind the Curtains&quot;, based on the film&#x27;s lasting impact, was released on DVD in 2013 (having been in production between 2007 and 2012), featuring interviews with many of the original cast and crew. It too was made available as part of the BBC Store &quot;Frightmares&quot; collection, and shortly after release, the BFI Mediatheque.

==Overview==

===Plot summary===
&quot;Ghostwatch&quot; is presented as a live broadcast, hosted by Michael Parkinson, in an attempt to present concrete evidence of paranormal phenomena. To achieve this, the programme launches an on-air investigation into a house in the fictional Foxhill Drive, Northolt, Greater London. Pamela Early (Brid Brennan) and her daughters Suzanne (Michelle Wesson) and Kim (Cherise Wesson) are tormented by a poltergeist referred to by Kim as &quot;Pipes&quot;, his name originating from knocking noises attributed to the house&#x27;s plumbing. Pipes routinely possesses and harms Suzanne, and is said to dwell in a room under the house&#x27;s stairs.

Parkinson is supported by fellow hosts Sarah Greene, who ventures into the house to spend the night with the Earlys, her husband Mike Smith, who oversees (staged) phone calls from the public who wish to share their own ghost stories, and comedian Craig Charles, who interviews the locals regarding the street&#x27;s violent history. Greene is accompanied by her camera crew, Chris Miller and Mike Aiton, (played by actual BBC technicians). Parkinson is joined in the studio by Dr. Lin Pascoe (Gillian Bevan), a parapsychologist studying the phenomena.

At first, the broadcast seems harmless, but supernatural phenomena begin to occur in the house. Suzanne is exposed falsifying the knocking sounds, convincing Parkinson that the whole affair is a hoax. Suzanne then speaks in an unearthly gutteral voice and develops scratches across her face. The public share their ghost stories, numerous callers mention they have seen Pipes lurking in the house on the broadcast footage, and others say paranormal incidents are happening in their own homes.

Pipes&#x27; background is slowly pieced together. An interviewed neighbour mentions Mother Seddons, a Victorian baby farmer who murdered children, re-imagined as a bogeyman by the locals. Later, an anonymous call from a probation officer reveals that Raymond Tunstall, a disturbed paedophile who believed he was possessed by Seddons, hanged himself in the room under the stairs, where his body was eaten by his relatives&#x27; cats. Pascoe suggests there may be a greater force at play, a possibly ancient evil that possessed Mother Seddons, Tunstall, and countless others.

As events in the house grows increasingly frightening, Suzanne disappears and is heard from behind the locked door. The camera crew forces the door open, only for a mirror to fall and wound Aiton. Abruptly, the footage shows the house has returned to normal. However, Pascoe realises the footage is from earlier in the broadcast, and that Pipes has used the free will to create a nationwide séance circle, invading the public&#x27;s homes. 

The live broadcast resumes as Pamela, Kim, and the injured Aiton are evacuated from the house. Inside, Greene and Miller attempt to rescue Suzanne, but Greene is dragged through the under-stairs door, which slams shut. The programme ends as inexplicable paranormal activity starts happening in the TV studio, causing all on-set save Parkinson to flee. Parkinson wanders about in the darkened studio, beginning to show signs that he has been possessed by Pipes.

===Behind the scenes===
The story is based on the tale of the Enfield Poltergeist. The presentation contained realistic elements which suggested to a casual viewer that it was an actual documentary. The studio scenes were recorded in Studio D, BBC Elstree Studios, Clarendon Road. The scenes at the house and the street were all shot on location around 5–6 weeks before the recording of the studio scenes. The recorded scenes in the house and street were then played into the studio, where Michael Parkinson, Mike Smith, and the fictional Dr Pascoe had to interact with them.

A phone number was shown on the screen so that viewers could &quot;call in&quot; and discuss ghostly phenomena. The number was the standard BBC call-in number at the time, 081 811 8181 (also used on programmes such as &quot;Going Live!&quot;), and callers who got through were connected first to a message telling them that the show was fictional, before being given the chance to share their own ghost stories, probably as a way of writing future stories for &quot;Ghostwatch&quot;. However, the phone number was besieged by countless callers during the showing and many people who telephoned simply got an engaged tone, partially because there were only five telephone operators available. This commonly happened when phoning BBC &quot;call in&quot; shows and inadvertently added to the realism instead of reassuring viewers that it was fiction.

&quot;Ghostwatch&quot; was originally conceived by writer Stephen Volk as a six-part drama (similar to &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot;) in which a fictional paranormal investigator and a TV reporter investigate poltergeist activity at a North London housing estate, gradually discovering more elements of the mystery each week. This would have culminated in the final episode in a live TV broadcast from the property, in the vein of Nigel Kneale&#x27;s &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; and &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot;, in both of which &quot;all hell breaks loose&quot;. However, when producer Ruth Baumgarten doubted the viability of an entire mini-series and recommended instead a 90-minute TV special, Volk suggested that they &quot;do the whole thing like Episode Six&quot;, portraying it as an actual &quot;live&quot; broadcast fronted by well-known TV personalities.

The BBC, however, became concerned about the effect the broadcast would have on the public and very nearly pulled the show shortly before broadcast. Ultimately, they insisted on adding opening credits including the writer&#x27;s name, in addition to a &quot;Screen One&quot; title sequence.

==Supernatural depictions==
===The ghost===
The film&#x27;s fictional villainous spectre, referred to by the children as &quot;Pipes&quot; and credited simply as &quot;Ghost&quot;, is depicted as a merging of negative spiritual energies, which parapsychologist Dr Pascoe theorises have been accumulating for years, possibly back to prehistory. Its physical appearance mostly resembles that of deceased child molester Raymond Tunstall, a fictional character who, it is revealed by a phone-in caller, killed himself at the haunted property some time in the 1960s after himself being possessed by the entity. His eyes are missing and his face is badly mauled, owing to Tunstall locking himself up with his multiple pet cats prior to his suicide, and the cats having &quot;got hungry&quot; in the week prior to the discovery of Tunstall&#x27;s body. The entity also wears a black woman&#x27;s dress, likely that of &quot;baby farmer&quot; and child killer Mother Seddons.

It is suggested that the character of Suzanne Early may become the next &quot;layer&quot; in the ghost&#x27;s spiritual make-up, and in the final moments of the film the entity possesses television host Michael Parkinson.

In May 2010, at a public screening of the film at The Invisible Dot in Camden, director Lesley Manning revealed that she provided the voice of Pipes the ghost after the professional voice artist hired for the production could not accurately replicate the style of voice she had intended.

===Technology===
Many methods familiar to modern ghost-hunting shows such as &quot;Most Haunted&quot; are demonstrated in the show, some of which were either genuine state-of-the-art technology at the time or simulated to give the idea they were real. The house was allegedly equipped with motion detectors, temperature sensors, and covert cameras. The temperature sensors were referred to as being able to check for dramatic changes in temperature that ghost hunters link to real-life ghost sightings. One major feature of the show was a genuine thermographic camera, which, although it did not pick up any ghosts, came in very handy when all the lights failed at the end of the show.

===Ghostly depictions===
The programme makers used many examples of allegedly paranormal phenomena. During the course of the programme there are many references to characters being allegedly possessed by a ghost who, whilst doing so, maniacally recites nursery rhymes. This happens in a tape recording of the eldest daughter Suzanne, later in a &#x27;live&#x27; section to the same character and eventually Michael Parkinson himself is seen to be possessed. The show references temperature changes being linked to ghosts and claims to be monitoring the temperature in each room of the house to check for this. Mutilated household objects are shown which were purportedly analysed by the Army and found to have been subjected to rapid temperature change. In both alleged recordings and live segments of the show we see objects moving of their own accordwhich, it is claimed, is a result of poltergeist activityalso, a perfectly round patch of water appears on the living room carpet, and animal scratch marks appear on Suzanne&#x27;s face. Banging noises are intermittently heard during the climax of the show. At one point the producers play on this by exposing Suzanne as the one causing the banging noises, creating a hoax within a hoax. However, this later occurs when both girls are accounted for.

Near the end of the programme, when a wind whips through the studio, the cups and plates brought in by Dr Pascoe as evidence of the poltergeist activity in the house begin to move on their own, and one cup falls onto the studio floor and smashes into pieces. Although the ghost of the story is only heard to speak through the voices of others we hear the disembodied sounds of cats whenever phenomena are taking place.

==Controversy==
Although &quot;Ghostwatch&quot; was aired under the &quot;Screen One&quot; drama banner, its documentary style led many viewers to believe the events were real, causing much controversy after the show&#x27;s airing. The BBC was besieged with phone calls from irate and frightened viewers, among them Parkinson&#x27;s elderly mother. British tabloids and other newspapers criticised the BBC the next day for the disturbing nature of some scenes, such as Greene&#x27;s final scene where she is locked in an under-stairs cupboard with the howling ghost, and Parkinson&#x27;s eerie possession scene.

A false rumour persisted that Sarah Greene had advertised the programme on her Saturday morning children&#x27;s show &quot;Going Live&quot;, including a visit to the location of the &quot;haunting&quot;, and gave the impression that she was taking part in a &quot;reality show&quot;. This rumour was debunked via the &quot;Ghostwatch: Behind the Curtain&quot; blog (which gathered information for a documentary about the show). After acquiring the three most likely episodes of &quot;Going Live&quot; (the week before, the day &quot;Ghostwatch&quot; was shown, and the week after), the blog&#x27;s editors found no reference to the show. Greene did however appear on the following Monday&#x27;s Children&#x27;s BBC strand to reassure younger viewers the show was not real.

The programme has yet to be repeated in full on any UK-based television channel, following its initial broadcast.

===Psychological effects===
A number of psychological effects were reported in &quot;Ghostwatch&quot;″s wake:

Eighteen-year-old factory worker Martin Denham, who suffered from learning difficulties and had a mental age of 13, died by suicide five days after the programme aired. The family home had suffered with a faulty central heating system which had caused the pipes to knock; Denham linked this to the activity in the show, causing him great worry. He left a suicide note reading &quot;if there are ghosts I will be ... with you always as a ghost&quot;. His mother and stepfather, April and Percy Denham, blamed the BBC. They claimed that Martin was &quot;hypnotised and obsessed&quot; by the programme. The Broadcasting Standards Commission refused their complaint, along with 34 others, as being outside their remit, but the High Court granted the Denhams&#x27; permission for a judicial review requiring the BSC to hear their complaint.

In its ruling, the BSC stated: &quot;The BBC had a duty to do more than simply hint at the deception it was practising on the audience. In &quot;Ghostwatch&quot; there was a deliberate attempt to cultivate a sense of menace.&quot; They ruled that the programme was excessively distressing and graphicreferring to the scratches on the children and the reference to mutilated animalsand that it had aired too soon after the 9pm watershed. They further stated that &quot;the presence in the programme of presenters familiar from children&#x27;s programmes ... took some parents off-guard in deciding whether their children could continue to view.&quot;

The film&#x27;s producers argued that &quot;Ghostwatch&quot; had aired during a drama slot, that it was recognisable as fiction to a vast majority, and that running more obvious disclaimers or other announcements that claimed that the programme was fictional would have ruined its effectiveness. They also stated that, had they anticipated the audience reaction, they would have made its fictional nature clearer. However, after the BSC ruling, they issued an apology.

Simons and Silveira published a report in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; in February 1994, describing two cases of &quot;Ghostwatch&quot;-induced post-traumatic stress disorder in children, both ten-year-old boys. They stated that these were the first reported cases of PTSD caused by a television programme. Responses to the article described a further four cases in children aged between eleven and 14, as well as one case in an eight-year-old that stemmed from watching the pre-watershed medical drama &quot;Casualty&quot;. The respondents also noted the potential for similar reactions in elderly people. However, the conclusion of the article states: &quot;The rapid resolution of the children&#x27;s symptoms suggests that the children suffered a brief anxiety reaction to the television programme; although they may have exhibited some of the features of post-traumatic stress disorder, this diagnosis in their cases is inappropriate.&quot;

==Home media==
The British Film Institute released it on VHS and Region 2 DVD in November 2002.

British label 101 Films released a Blu-ray disc in late 2022, including &quot;Do You Believe in Ghosts?&quot;, a new 30th anniversary documentary on the &quot;Ghostwatch&quot; phenomenon.

==Legacy==
===Inspirations===
&quot;Ghostwatch&quot; has also been credited for being amongst the direct inspirations for several other successful, contemporary works.

A comment left by writer Stephen Volk on the official &quot;Ghostwatch: Behind the Curtains&quot; homepage claims that British illusionist Derren Brown once told him that the film had at least partially inspired his similarly controversial &quot;TV hoax&quot; &quot;Séance&quot;. This was later confirmed by Brown himself whilst being interviewed for the BBC Four documentary &quot;Ghosts in the Machine&quot;.

People have pointed out the similarities between &quot;Ghostwatch&quot; and the 1999 American found footage horror film &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;. When asked about the similarities on the podcast, &quot;Diminishing Returns&quot;, &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; co-director, Eduardo Sánchez, stated that they were not made aware of the film until after the film had been released.

More recently, the creative team behind the 2020 British Zoom-based computer screen horror film &quot;Host&quot; have credited &quot;Ghostwatch&quot; as an influence. Co-writer Jed Shepherd, who had appeared on a podcast with Volk prior to working on &quot;Host&quot;, stated in an interview that he and his collaborators considered &quot;Host&quot; to be their version of &quot;Ghostwatch&quot;, and noted that the film has &quot;a lot of &quot;Ghostwatch&quot; references&quot;, including displaying a Zoom caller ID of 31101992, referring to the date of &quot;Ghostwatch&quot;&#x27;s broadcast.

===Sequel (&#x27;31/10&#x27;)===
As featured in his collection &quot;Dark Corners&quot;, screenwriter Stephen Volk wrote a short story entitled &quot;31/10&quot;, which is effectively a sequel to &quot;Ghostwatch&quot;. The piece was later selected for &quot;The Year&#x27;s Best Fantasy and Horror 2007: Twentieth Annual Collection&quot;, and nominated for the Horror Writers&#x27; Association (HWA) Bram Stoker Award, and British Fantasy Award for Best Short Story 2006.

The story itself centres on Volk taking part in a fictitious, tenth anniversary edition of &quot;Ghostwatch&quot; in 2002. Venturing into the previously sealed-off BBC studio space where the original show took place, he is accompanied by a small team of individuals whose lives were somehow affected by the broadcast, ten years previously.

A free PDF file of &quot;31/10&quot; can be found on writer Stephen Volk&#x27;s official website.

==&quot;Ghostwatch: Behind the Curtains&quot;==
Ghostwatch: Behind the Curtains is a retrospective documentary, completed in 2012 and released on DVD in 2013, chronicling the making of and reaction to &quot;Ghostwatch&quot;.

The &quot;Behind the Curtains&quot; subtitle is derived from where fictitious poltergeist, Pipes, &#x27;hides&#x27; in the shared bedroom of characters, Kim and Suzanne Early. It is also one of the chapter headings on the British Film Institute &quot;Ghostwatch&quot; DVD release.

===Developments===
On 21 February 2008, the &quot;GhostwatchBtC&quot; channel was launched on YouTube. All that was initially revealed regarding the project was a notice asking fans of the original film to contribute any &quot;Ghostwatch&quot;-related stories or recollections via the comments boxes provided.

On 31 October 2008 (exactly sixteen years after the original film was originally broadcast), a production blog was launched.

The first article to be published was written by the documentary&#x27;s creator, Rich Lawden, in which he revealed the idea to make a retrospective first originated at a Cineformation screening held at the Watershed in Bristol.

Subsequent articles have included a special Hallowe&#x27;en message from Stephen Volk, and a link to a new &quot;Ghostwatch&quot; article written by lead actor, Michael Parkinson. Between December 2008 and February 2009, a web forum, and Twitter, MySpace and Facebook pages were also added.

On 31 October 2011, the first official production still was uploaded to mark both Hallowe&#x27;en Night and the conclusion of &quot;National Séance 2011&quot;. The image features cast members, Sarah Greene and Mike Smith sitting with an interviewer, and two additional crew members, in an aircraft hangar. A quote beneath the picture reads: &quot;Stay tuned for 2012, Ghostwatchers&quot;.

On 24 October 2012, one week before the show&#x27;s 20th Anniversary, a teaser trailer for the project was announced on &quot;SFX&quot;. A DVD of the completed film was released by the producers on eBay in March 2013, and within hours, had to be re-listed directly on the Lawman Productions website after quickly selling out. In October 2013, a companion book, written by Lawden, was released on Lulu containing a foreword by writer Stephen Volk, the sequel story &quot;31/10&quot;, new interviews, and an extensive production diary for the documentary itself.

In October 2016, it was announced that the online platform BBC Store was to offer both &quot;Ghostwatch&quot; and the retrospective &quot;Behind the Curtains&quot; documentary as part of the new &quot;Frightmares&quot; collection, in time for Halloween. Shortly thereafter, it was revealed that the documentary had ranked among the best performing titles in the collection, also making the top ten best sellers for the first two weeks, after launch.

===&quot;National Séance&quot;===
To mark the show&#x27;s 18th anniversary, a &quot;live&quot; event took place in lieu of a full repeat screening on British television. Dubbed &quot;National Séance&quot;, fans were asked to simultaneously play their personal recordings of the show at precisely 9:25pm (just as &quot;Ghostwatch&quot; was originally broadcast) and tweet about the screening as it happened on the social networking site Twitter. The event has subsequently become a yearly tradition. The event is known for celebrating the original drama by the unveiling of special artwork, or occasionally unseen or unheard material relating to its production, and often directly contributes to the hashtag &quot;#ghostwatch&quot; trending on the platform.

In 2020, the tenth &quot;National Séance&quot; took the form of a live YouTube stream via Zoom hosted by Rich, called &quot;National Séance Live&quot;, featuring special guests, Mike Aiton (Soundman/himself), Gillian Bevan (Doctor Pascoe), Richard Drew (Assistant Set Designer), Sarah Greene (Reporter/herself), Lesley Manning (Director) and Stephen Volk (Writer). Producer Ruth Baumgarten was also expected to make an appearance, but ultimately could not. The event was made available to view on the &quot;Behind The Curtains&quot; YouTube page.

===Critical reception===
The film was met with a positive response from both fans and critics alike. Notably, leading film and TV magazines &quot;SFX&quot; and &quot;Starburst&quot; awarded 4/5 and 8/10 ratings respectively.

The film was subsequently selected for inclusion in the BFI Mediatheque, for the upcoming &quot;Haunted&quot; collection, from December 2013-onwards.

<text>Count Franz von Walsegg (January 17, 1763 – November 11, 1827) was a German aristocrat, living in Stuppach Castle near Gloggnitz, who is best remembered for having commissioned a Requiem Mass from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in 1791 following the death of his twenty-year-old wife Anna (the grieving count, only 28 himself at the time, would never remarry). A Freemason and amateur musician, Walsegg had a penchant for commissioning works from composers of the day and then passing them off as his own in private performances. In his account of the commission of the Requiem Mass from Mozart, Anton Herzog states:

Although Mozart died before completing the Requiem, Constanze Mozart arranged for several other composers, most notably Franz Xaver Süssmayr, to complete the work in order to gain the remainder of the sum Walsegg had promised.

<text>ROOP is a multiparadigm programming language made for artificial intelligence (AI) applications, created at Chengdu University, China. It combines procedural, logic or rule-based, and object-oriented programming techniques.

==Features==
* ROOP is built directly on C++, providing full unrestricted access to all its features.
* ROOP, like OPS-83 and ORBS, is data-driven but, unlike those languages, rules in ROOP may enter into &quot;local communication&quot; and this can be used to dynamically divide them into groups, including the problem status space tree.
* Rules and facts in ROOP are objects, and they send and respond to messages just like any other object in the language. This ability is usually unavailable in other logic programming languages such as Prolog.
* ROOP&#x27;s inference engine can be &quot;redefined&quot; in a program, something usually infeasible in other logic languages.

<text>The United Network (commonly referred to as United; known prior to launch as the Overmyer Network, a.k.a. ON), was a short lived attempt at a fourth television network in the United States that operated through the month of May 1967. Founded by Daniel H. Overmyer, a Toledo, Ohio, warehouse chain operator and television station owner, majority control of the network was sold by Overmyer to a 14-person syndicate weeks before it launched, resulting in the name change to the United Network.

Despite lofty plans outlined by network president Oliver Treyz, United&#x27;s lone offering was &quot;The Las Vegas Show&quot;, a late-night talk show hosted by comedian Bill Dana. This program was successfully cleared in a majority of the nation&#x27;s television markets; many United affiliates had existing primary affiliations with a Big Three network. Significant financial losses, poor timing, and a lack of overall advertising support prompted the network to shut down after only one month of operations.

== Formation ==
A second-generation warehouse owner, Daniel H. Overmyer had entered prominence in the field, owning and operating up to 260 buildings in 55 cities nationwide by 1965. By 1966, Overmyer successfully built and signed on WDHO-TV in Toledo, Ohio, owned the &quot;Toledo Monitor&quot;, a weekly tabloid paper, and founded Progress National Bank; he also secured construction permits for six additional ultra high frequency (UHF) stations across the country, joining existing UHF station WDHO.

The creation of the Overmyer Network was announced on July 12, 1966, with former ABC president Oliver Treyz hired as network president. In addition to Overmyer&#x27;s planned UHF outlets serving as owned-and-operated stations, New York City station WPIX-TV, owned by Tribune Broadcasting, was signed up as the planned flagship. Los Angeles station KHJ-TV, owned by RKO General, was announced as the lead station for the West Coast; had KHJ-TV not signed, KBSA (channel 46), a station that had yet to sign on the air, would have been designated as West Coast flagship. The Overmyer Network, abbreviated &quot;ON&quot; with the slogan, &quot;Turn ON&quot;, was regarded as the first credible attempt at forming a fourth national network to join ABC, NBC and CBS since ABC&#x27;s formal reorganization in 1953.
Treyz envisioned ON supplying up to eight straight hours of evening programming to affiliates, including a prime time block devoted to different genres every night, two hours of newscasts supplied by United Press International (UPI), and a late-night talk show originating from Las Vegas, Nevada. Cultural and sports programming including &quot;Tales from the Great Book&quot; (an animated Bible series) and regional games of the Continental Football League were also planned, as was professional soccer. Lewron Television, a Baltimore, Maryland–based production company that provided mobile television facilities for ABC, CBS and NBC, was contracted to supply their facilities for the late-night show. By July 1966, 35 stations agreed to affiliate with the new network; this grew by October to 100 stations, 75 of which already agreed to carry the late-night show. The number of planned affiliates increased to 123 by December, including 24 of the largest 25 markets. Many of these new affiliates were existing CBS affiliates; after ON made the late-night show a priority, CBS declined to launch a late-night show of their own.

== Ownership and name change ==
Overmyer encountered numerous financial difficulties in late 1966, attributed largely to an overexpansion of his warehouse company. Construction of his warehouses was briefly halted after the lead contractor encountered financial distress, owing $18 million to shareholders; in response, Overmyer agreed to guarantee the contractor&#x27;s $5–6 million debt. Overmyer also employed a large financial development staff for his warehouse arm that traveled across the country, resulting in substantial travel expenses and monthly airfare totaling $80,000 a month. Consequently, construction of the other UHF stations was delayed, with only the San Francisco (KEMO-TV) and Cincinnati (WSCO-TV) permits having any tangible progress to speak of. Overmyer sold off 80 percent majority control of these unfinished construction permits to American Viscose Corporation in exchange for a $3 million loan.

Overmyer announced the sale of 80 percent majority control in the network on March 5, 1967, to a 14-person syndicate led by three stockholders in the Mutual Broadcasting System: Jack McGlothlin, a Texas oil operator; Willard Garvey, a grain dealer, an oil investor and land developer; and James Nichols, a Texas advertising and public-relations executive. No money changed hands. By February 15, 1967, Overmyer encountered second thoughts over the feasibility of the network and realized the original projected April 3 launch date promised months earlier in trade advertising would not be met. Overmyer proposed to the Mutual board a merger with the Overmyer Network as a way to help finance production of the new late-night show until advertising revenue became more available. While the Mutual board rejected the idea, McGlothlin, Garvey and Nichols, were receptive and formed the syndicate. As part of the deal, ON was renamed the United Network and now had a launch date of May 1, 1967. The new date came after negotiations with Lewron that included a $60,000 rider inserted in their contract and the right for United to terminate with seven days&#x27; notice. &quot;Broadcasting&quot; called the transaction &quot;a rescue mission ... [that] has saved the fourth television network from death in the womb.&quot; Overmyer also relinquished any managerial role or board seats with the network.

== Launch ==
Rechristened the United Network, the new network signed on the air on May 1, 1967, with &quot;The Las Vegas Show&quot; on 106 stations. Hosted by comedian Bill Dana from the Hotel Hacienda, the show featured regulars Ann Elder, Pete Barbutti, Danny Meahan, Jo Anne Worley, Cully Richards and Jack Sheldon, and aspired for a younger audience than NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. &quot;The Las Vegas Show&quot; also debuted two weeks after ABC launched &quot;The Joey Bishop Show&quot;. Dana had a 13-week contract with United to host the show and was reportedly paid $8,000 per week. The primary focus on &quot;Las Vegas&quot;, coupled with changes to the network&#x27;s distribution, delayed the UPI newsfeed to a September 11, 1967, launch. UPI merged their television news service with ITN earlier in the year to form UPITN, and United was to have been one of UPITN&#x27;s first clients.

With &quot;Las Vegas&quot; derisively dubbed &quot;Ollie&#x27;s Follies&quot; by industry insiders, United was described by &quot;Variety&quot; as a syndication service similar to Sports Network, but utilizing AT&amp;T Bell System transmission lines—the main carrier for television network transmissions—to send programming on a regular schedule. United&#x27;s affiliate base was regarded as &quot;irregular&quot; by &quot;Variety&quot; and retrospectively seen as &quot;erratic&quot;. As the network was made up mostly of existing Big Three affiliates, &quot;The Las Vegas Show&quot; aired in tape delay in most markets; some NBC affiliates delayed the show to the late afternoon or aired it after &quot;Tonight&quot;. The show&#x27;s airtime on WPIX varied during the week, which was also the case for WGN-TV in Chicago. The network also lacked clearance in some large cities, including San Francisco, which was waiting for KEMO-TV to sign on.

While initially debuting to strong ratings in New York and Los Angeles, &quot;Las Vegas&quot; experienced significant declines through the month of May 1967. By the third week, &quot;Las Vegas&quot; was ranked dead last in New York and reportedly fell to a fraction of a point nationally. Dana later said some audience surveys showed &quot;Las Vegas&quot; had an average viewership of around 2.6 million, a respectable number given the varied airtimes among the stations and competition against &quot;Tonight&quot;, &quot;Joey Bishop&quot; and &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;.

== Financial distress ==
Despite the hype, the United Network quickly started to bleed money. AT&amp;T&#x27;s transmission lines proved to be too expensive: advance fees for the lines amounted to $400,000 per month and $7 million annually (equivalent to $ in ), with United paying for all eight hours despite using only two of those allotted hours. Under existing toll tariff rules, United was prohibited from subleasing these unused hours to another program service or for educational television, which drew the ire of &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist Jack Gould. After the network launched, Overmyer sold his nominal 20 percent stake back to the syndicate for $240,000 cash and a $115,000 promissory note. Two weeks into the network&#x27;s operations, several members of the syndicate declined to have any further involvement with United, further burdening the remaining stockholders. H. L. Hunt and Howard Hughes were both approached as investors, but both rejected their respective offers, and another merger proposal with Mutual Broadcasting was reportedly rejected.

United also launched at the end of the traditional television season, which was also the last quarter for traditional advertising budget cycles, limiting the ability for blue-chip companies to become clients for the network, although companies like Colgate-Palmolive, General Mills and General Foods did emerge as advertisers. During the last days of operation, network president Oliver Treyz made an on-air appeal to potential sponsors, pointing out that air time on &quot;The Las Vegas Show&quot; was a mere $6,000 a minute, barely a third of what NBC was charging for &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. Syndicated columnist Jack O&#x27;Brian reported these $6,000 rates were reduced further by up to two-thirds. Lewron was also not paid on May 22 and May 29 and issued a telegram threatening to deny United usage of their facilities. Other columnists began to suggest United &quot;is in financial trouble&quot;, had a &quot;shaky&quot; future, or was &quot;dying&quot;, with O&#x27;Brian calling &quot;Las Vegas&quot; both &quot;new and ailing&quot;.

== Closure ==
United&#x27;s executive board voted to cease operations on Thursday, June 1, 1967, forcing affiliates to find replacement programming that same evening, some with only a few hours notice. One station, WREC-TV in Memphis, Tennessee, which carried &quot;Las Vegas&quot; at midnight, opted to sign-off at that time. &quot;Las Vegas&quot; was cancelled after 23 episodes; production staff was notified after the previous night&#x27;s taping that the show &quot;would stop taping for awhile&quot;. Financial losses for the network&#x27;s investors totaled $2.2 million (equivalent to $ in ) from a starting capital of $10 million. &quot;Las Vegas&quot; executive producer David Sontag said United needed up to $8 million more in order to sustain further production of the program.

A notice was sent to the network&#x27;s 107 affiliate stations on June 1, 1967, which stated:

United filed for bankruptcy on June 22, 1967, having accrued a debt of $690,000. Creditors included Chase Manhattan Bank, Texas Bank and Trust, Overmyer Network and Productions, and Bill Dana. Treyz left at the end of June. Managing director James Nichols expressed hope to resume United&#x27;s operations within two months, saying the network did not fold but dropped all programming while undergoing a reorganization. Nichols retained Robert Pauley, formerly of ABC Radio, to serve as United&#x27;s future president. Minority shareholder Willard Garvey planned to incorporate a new company named Detinu, Inc. (United spelled backward), to &quot;precede development of a fourth nationwide television network&quot;.

By September 1967, Nichols announced United would relaunch with seven hours of news and public affairs per week, transmitted between 2 a.m. and noon when AT&amp;T fees were lowest. Pauley &quot;severed ties&quot; with United&#x27;s investor team the following month and established Independent Broadcasting Co., which like United would provide news and public affairs, including content from Pathé News, to affiliates. This network also failed to materialize and Pauley was eventually hired as president of Mutual Broadcasting. Pete Barbutti told the &quot;Omaha World-Herald&quot; in a January 1968 interview any plans to revive United or &quot;Las Vegas&quot; were &quot;quite unlikely&quot; as ownership decided to write-off the network for tax purposes.

Lewron Television sued both the network and Overmyer for $117,000 in unpaid rental bills, half of what had been owed to them under their contract; Overmyer was included because of his past status as a minority owner. While Overmyer was initially found liable of up to $53,683 in a summary judgment, this was later reversed on appeal. The lawsuit against United was decided on May 8, 1972, with the network owing the firm $13,326.86.

== Legacy ==
WPIX president Fred Thrower called United &quot;a valiant attempt&quot; and said &quot;it&#x27;s a shame it didn&#x27;t work... to ask for a success in five weeks was too much. If the backers of the network didn&#x27;t intend to give it sustenance until it found its place they shouldn&#x27;t play in this league with peanuts.&quot; Bill Dana expressed frustration over United&#x27;s management and finances, telling an Associated Press reporter, &quot;this appears to be the definite case of &#x27;the operation was a success, but the patient died&#x27;. I can only ascribe the failure of the enterprise to the consummate naivete on the part of the backers. The whole thing went against all principles of sound fiscal policy. Even if you open a candy store, you should have enough capitalization to last more than three or four weeks.&quot; Overmyer said after the shutdown, &quot;I am sorry. I still think a fourth network is necessary and maybe a fifth as time goes by.&quot;

Jack Gould mused in his &quot;Times&quot; column at the end of 1967 that United&#x27;s failure was &quot;further evidence that expansion of commercial TV is little more than a pipe dream&quot;. In a February 1969 column on recent attempts at a fourth television network (including DuMont, NTA and a Pat Weaver effort), Newspaper Enterprise Association media critic Joan Crosby deemed United &quot;the latest, and most noteworthy fiasco ... that barely lasted long enough for the first commercial&quot;. Industry spokesmen described United to Crosby as &quot;a promotion stunt&quot; and &quot;a fraud&quot;. Homer Brickey of the &quot;Toledo Blade&quot; later called the network &quot;a victim of the Overmyer cash crunch&quot; and claimed Treyz &quot;slid into oblivion and reportedly became a bum on the streets of New York City.&quot; Historian Hal Erickson wrote that &quot;... the United Network came to an end—making &quot;The Las Vegas Show&quot; the first series in history to leave the air because its network was cancelled.&quot;

== Affiliate stations ==
A two-page advertisement published on the April 3, 1967, issue of &quot;Broadcasting&quot; magazine listed all the planned affiliates for the United Network. Prior to that, the December 5, 1966, issue of &quot;Broadcasting&quot; listed planned all the affiliates for the Overmyer Network, 123 in total. In some markets, a different station was the affiliate due to the planned station not yet signing on. Overmyer&#x27;s KEMO-TV (channel 20) was listed as an affiliate in both lists, but it was not on air until April 1, 1968; as a result, &quot;The Las Vegas Show&quot; did not air in San Francisco.

A blue background indicates a station only included in the April 3, 1967, list.
Some listed affiliates did not carry the show:
* KRNT-TV (channel 8, CBS), Des Moines, Iowa
* WWTV (channel 9, CBS), Cadillac, Michigan, and satellite WWUP in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan
* KTTS-TV (channel 10, CBS), Springfield, Missouri
* KTXL (channel 40), Sacramento, California; signed on October 26, 1968

* WISC-TV (channel 3, CBS), Madison, Wisconsin
* WOAY-TV (channel 4, ABC), Oak Hill, West Virginia
* WTVK (channel 26, ABC), Knoxville, Tennessee; could not use ABC network lines to receive the program once &quot;Joey Bishop&quot; was scheduled as its competition

The following stations were listed as affiliates in the December 5, 1966, list and had no market replacement:
* KHSL-TV (channel 12, CBS), Chico–Redding, California
* KIEM-TV (channel 3, CBS), Eureka, California
* WCTV (channel 6, CBS), Tallahassee, Florida
* WINK-TV (channel 11, CBS), Fort Myers, Florida

<doc id="931368" wikidata="Q4470099" url="?curid=931368" title="Robyn Williams">
<text>Robyn Williams (born 30 January 1944) is a British/Australian science journalist and broadcaster who has hosted &quot;The Science Show&quot; on ABC Radio National (RN) since 1975, and created &quot;Ockham&#x27;s Razor&quot; in 1984.

==Early life and education==
Williams was born on 30 January 1944 in Wales or High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, England. His father, Gwyn, a Welshman, has been variously reported as a union executive and journalist, or a coalminer who also studied engineering. His mother, Ray (nee Davis), was Jewish, from London&#x27;s East End, and worked as a translator.

Williams attended various schools in London, including the Bec School in Tooting Bec, as well as spending a few years at a German language school in Vienna, Austria.

Williams first spent time in Australia in 1964 and worked as a temporary clerk at the Decimal Currency Board of Australia, among other jobs. He moved back to London with his Australian wife to study science.
He graduated from the University of London with a Bachelor of Science (Honours) degree. During this period he was active in university acting and was hired as an extra in BBC series &quot;The Goodies&quot;, &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; and &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

==Professional life==
He joined the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) Science Unit in 1972 where, after several years in background production and interviewing for the &quot;Insight&quot; program, he hosted &quot;Innovations&quot; in early 1974, &quot;Investigations&quot; (2-hour format) from 6 November 1974. In 1975 he began hosting &quot;The Science Show&quot;, a one-hour science-based radio interview show. At one time it was the most popular radio show on Radio 2 (Radio National&#x27;s former name), and it is one of the longest-running radio shows in Australia and the world.

&quot;Ockham&#x27;s Razor&quot; followed in 1984, with Williams introducing a leading scientist or personality who then expounds from a prepared text on a topic of their choice, with a view to making a subject simple and accessible to the public, hence the title relating to the famous statement on parsimony by William of Ockham. &quot;In Conversation&quot; commenced in 1997, with Williams interviewing the personality.

==Other media work==
* Narrating &quot;Nature of Australia&quot;, a series for ABC TV
* Appearing in &quot;World Safari&quot; with David Attenborough
* Instigating the establishment of the Eureka Awards for Excellence in Science Communication and Innovation by the ABC and Australian Museum

==Trade union activism==
In 1977, Williams gave an impassioned speech to the ABC Staff Association against ABC management&#x27;s quiescence in the face of budget cuts and political interference. He said that a UK proposal that the government appoint one third of BBC board members had been publicly opposed by BBC management but that the ABC chairman acted as if he headed an organisation rivalling the BBC. Following his speech the meeting voted unanimously that it had no confidence in the ABC chair, John Norgard.

==Other roles==
* Adjunct professor at the University of Queensland
* Visiting professor at the University of New South Wales
* Deputy Chair, Australian Science Media Centre, since 2012
* President, Australian Science Communicators, 1998–2001
* President, Australia and New Zealand Advancement of Science, 1992
* Chair, Australian Commission for the Future, 1990–1994
* President of the Australian Museum Trust, 1986–1994
* Chairman of the Commission For The Future
* President of Australian Science Communicators
* President of the Australian &amp; New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science (ANZAAS) Congress in Brisbane
* Co-Chairman of the Biology Department at the University of Texas, El Paso
* Member of the council of Voiceless, the animal protection institute, 2009–?

==Honours, awards and recognition==
===Australian honours===
* 1988: Honorary Member of the Order of Australia (AM), 26 January, &quot;For service to science, particularly in the fields of media and education&quot;
*2001: Centenary Medal, 1 January, &quot;For outstanding service in science communication&quot;
*2020: Honorary Officer of the Order of Australia (AO), 26 January, &quot;For distinguished service to science as a journalist, radio presenter and author, and to education&quot;

==Publications==
As well as many articles and introductions to books, Williams has written at least 10 books, including:

*&quot;The Uncertainty Principle&quot; (1991, nonfiction)

* &quot;And Now For Something Completely Different&quot; (1995), autobiography, written when he was a Reuters Fellow at Oxford. The title refers to a popular radio interview he did with John Cleese on the topic of psychiatry.

*&quot;2007&quot; (published 2001) is a dystopian novel describing a rebellion of animals.

*&quot;Turmoil: Letters from the Brink&quot; (2018, nonfiction)

==Personal life==

Williams met Pamela Traylor when in Australia for the first time, and they married on 10 June 1966 before both moving back to the UK, where he studied science. They had two children.

He is a good friend of fellow ABC presenter, Norman Swan, a qualified medical doctor, who intervened to help save his life when he suffered a cardiac arrest in 1988.

 Williams is in a long-term relationship with Jonica Newby, a former presenter on ABC Television&#x27;s &quot;Catalyst&quot; science journalism program. Williams underwent chemotherapy for colorectal cancer in 2014 and 2015; at one point he was hospitalised for five weeks but continued to make &quot;The Science Show&quot; from his hospital bed.

<text>Tropical rainforests are dense and warm rainforests with high rainfall typically found between 10° north and south of the Equator. They are a subset of the tropical forest biome that occurs roughly within the 28° latitudes (in the torrid zone between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn). Tropical rainforests are a type of tropical moist broadleaf forest, that includes the more extensive seasonal tropical forests. True rainforests usually occur in tropical rainforest climates where no dry season occurs; all months have an average precipitation of at least . Seasonal tropical forests with tropical monsoon or savanna climates are sometimes included in the broader definition.

Tropical rainforests ecosystems are distinguished by their consistent, high temperatures, exceeding monthly, and substantial annual rainfall. The abundant rainfall results in nutrient-poor, leached soils, which profoundly affect the flora and fauna adapted to these conditions. These rainforests are renowned for their significant biodiversity. They are home to 40–75% of all species globally, including half of the world&#x27;s animal and plant species, and two-thirds of all flowering plant species. Their dense insect population and variety of trees and higher plants are notable. Described as the &quot;world&#x27;s largest pharmacy&quot;, over a quarter of natural medicines have been discovered in them. However, tropical rainforests are threatened by human activities, such as logging and agricultural expansion, leading to habitat fragmentation and loss.

The structure of a tropical rainforest is stratified into layers, each hosting unique ecosystems. These include the emergent layer with towering trees, the densely populated canopy layer, the understory layer rich in wildlife, and the forest floor, which is sparse due to low light penetration. The soil is characteristically nutrient-poor and acidic. Tropical rainforests have a long history of ecological succession, influenced by natural events and human activities. They are crucial for global ecological functions, including carbon sequestration and climate regulation. Many indigenous peoples around the world have inhabited rainforests for millennia, relying on them for sustenance and shelter, but face challenges from modern economic activities.

Conservation efforts are diverse, focusing on both preservation and sustainable management. International policies, such as the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD and REDD+) programs, aim to curb deforestation and forest degradation. Despite these efforts, tropical rainforests continue to face significant threats from deforestation and climate change, highlighting the ongoing challenge of balancing conservation with human development needs.

== Overview ==
Tropical rainforests are hot and wet. Mean monthly temperatures exceed during all months of the year. Average annual rainfall is no less than and can exceed although it typically lies between and . This high level of precipitation often results in poor soils due to leaching of soluble nutrients in the ground.

Tropical rainforests exhibit high levels of biodiversity. Around 40% to 75% of all biotic species are indigenous to the rainforests. Rainforests are home to half of all the living animal and plant species on the planet. Two-thirds of all flowering plants can be found in rainforests. A single hectare of rainforest may contain 42,000 different species of insect, up to 807 trees of 313 species and 1,500 species of higher plants. Tropical rainforests have been called the &quot;world&#x27;s largest pharmacy&quot;, because over one quarter of natural medicines have been discovered within them. It is likely that there may be many millions of species of plants, insects and microorganisms still undiscovered in tropical rainforests.

Tropical rainforests are among the most threatened ecosystems globally due to large-scale fragmentation as a result of human activity. Habitat fragmentation caused by geological processes such as volcanism and climate change occurred in the past, and have been identified as important drivers of speciation. However, fast human driven habitat destruction is suspected to be one of the major causes of species extinction. Tropical rain forests have been subjected to heavy logging and agricultural clearance throughout the 20th century, and the area covered by rainforests around the world is rapidly shrinking.

=== History ===

Tropical rainforests have existed on earth for hundreds of millions of years. Most tropical rainforests today are on fragments of the Mesozoic era supercontinent of Gondwana. The separation of the landmass resulted in a great loss of amphibian diversity while at the same time the drier climate spurred the diversification of reptiles. The division left tropical rainforests located in five major regions of the world: tropical America, Africa, Southeast Asia, Madagascar, and New Guinea, with smaller outliers in Australia. However, the specifics of the origin of rainforests remain uncertain due to an incomplete fossil record.

=== Other types of tropical forest ===

Several biomes may appear similar-to, or merge via ecotones with, tropical rainforest:

;Moist seasonal tropical forest:

Moist seasonal tropical forests receive high overall rainfall with a warm summer wet season and a cooler winter dry season. These forests usually fall under tropical monsoon or tropical savanna climates. Some trees in these forests drop some or all of their leaves during the winter dry season, thus they are sometimes called &quot;tropical mixed forest&quot;. They are found in parts of South America, in Central America and around the Caribbean, in coastal West Africa, parts of the Indian subcontinent, and across much of Indochina.

;Montane rainforests:
These are found in cooler-climate mountainous areas, becoming known as cloud forests at higher elevations. Depending on latitude, the lower limit of montane rainforests on large mountains is generally between 1500 and 2500m while the upper limit is usually from 2400 to 3300m.

;Flooded rainforests:
Tropical freshwater swamp forests, or &quot;flooded forests&quot;, are found in Amazon basin (the Várzea) and elsewhere.

== Forest structure ==
Rainforests are divided into different strata, or layers, with vegetation organized into a vertical pattern from the top of the soil to the canopy. Each layer is a unique biotic community containing different plants and animals adapted for life in that particular strata. Only the emergent layer is unique to tropical rainforests, while the others are also found in temperate rainforests.

=== Forest floor ===

The forest floor, the bottom-most layer, receives only 2% of the sunlight. Only plants adapted to low light can grow in this region. Away from riverbanks, swamps and clearings, where dense undergrowth is found, the forest floor is relatively clear of vegetation because of the low sunlight penetration. This more open quality permits the easy movement of larger animals such as: ungulates like the okapi (&quot;Okapia johnstoni&quot;), tapir (&quot;Tapirus&quot; sp.), Sumatran rhinoceros (&quot;Dicerorhinus sumatrensis&quot;), and apes like the western lowland gorilla (&quot;Gorilla gorilla&quot;), as well as many species of reptiles, amphibians, and insects. The forest floor also contains decaying plant and animal matter, which disappears quickly, because the warm, humid conditions promote rapid decay. Many forms of fungi growing here help decay the animal and plant waste.

=== Understory layer ===

The understory layer lies between the canopy and the forest floor. The understory is home to a number of birds, small mammals, insects, reptiles, and predators. Examples include leopard (&quot;Panthera pardus&quot;), poison dart frogs (&quot;Dendrobates&quot; sp.), ring-tailed coati (&quot;Nasua nasua&quot;), boa constrictor (&quot;Boa constrictor&quot;), and many species of Coleoptera. The vegetation at this layer generally consists of shade-tolerant shrubs, herbs, small trees, and large woody vines which climb into the trees to capture sunlight. Only about 5% of sunlight breaches the canopy to arrive at the understory causing true understory plants to seldom grow to 3 m (10feet). As an adaptation to these low light levels, understory plants have often evolved much larger leaves. Many seedlings that will grow to the canopy level are in the understory.

=== Canopy layer ===

The canopy is the primary layer of the forest, forming a roof over the two remaining layers. It contains the majority of the largest trees, typically 30–45 m in height. Tall, broad-leaved evergreen trees are the dominant plants. The densest areas of biodiversity are found in the forest canopy, as it often supports a rich flora of epiphytes, including orchids, bromeliads, mosses and lichens. These epiphytic plants attach to trunks and branches and obtain water and minerals from rain and debris that collects on the supporting plants. The fauna is similar to that found in the emergent layer, but more diverse. It is suggested that the total arthropod species richness of the tropical canopy might be as high as 20 million. Other species inhabiting this layer include many avian species such as the yellow-casqued wattled hornbill (&quot;Ceratogymna elata&quot;), collared sunbird (&quot;Anthreptes collaris&quot;), grey parrot (&quot;Psitacus erithacus&quot;), keel-billed toucan (&quot;Ramphastos sulfuratus&quot;), scarlet macaw (&quot;Ara macao&quot;) as well as other animals like the spider monkey (&quot;Ateles&quot; sp.), African giant swallowtail (&quot;Papilio antimachus&quot;), three-toed sloth (&quot;Bradypus tridactylus&quot;), kinkajou (&quot;Potos flavus&quot;), and tamandua (&quot;Tamandua tetradactyla&quot;).

=== Emergent layer ===

The emergent layer contains a small number of very large trees, called &quot;emergents&quot;, which grow above the general canopy, reaching heights of 45–55m, although on occasion a few species will grow to 70–80m tall. Some examples of emergents include: &quot;Hydrochorea elegans&quot;, &quot;Dipteryx panamensis&quot;, &quot;Hieronyma alchorneoides&quot;, &quot;Hymenolobium mesoamericanum&quot;, &quot;Lecythis ampla&quot; and &quot;Terminalia oblonga&quot;. These trees need to be able to withstand the hot temperatures and strong winds that occur above the canopy in some areas. Several unique faunal species inhabit this layer such as the crowned eagle (&quot;Stephanoaetus coronatus&quot;), the king colobus (&quot;Colobus polykomos&quot;), and the large flying fox (&quot;Pteropus vampyrus&quot;).

However, stratification is not always clear. Rainforests are dynamic and many changes affect the structure of the forest. Emergent or canopy trees collapse, for example, causing gaps to form. Openings in the forest canopy are widely recognized as important for the establishment and growth of rainforest trees. It is estimated that perhaps 75% of the tree species at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica are dependent on canopy opening for seed germination or for growth beyond sapling size, for example.

== Ecology ==
=== Climates ===


Tropical rainforests are located around and near the equator, therefore having what is called an equatorial climate characterized by three major climatic parameters: temperature, rainfall, and dry season intensity. Other parameters that affect tropical rainforests are carbon dioxide concentrations, solar radiation, and nitrogen availability. In general, climatic patterns consist of warm temperatures and high annual rainfall. However, the abundance of rainfall changes throughout the year creating distinct moist and dry seasons. Tropical forests are classified by the amount of rainfall received each year, which has allowed ecologists to define differences in these forests that look so similar in structure. According to Holdridge&#x27;s classification of tropical ecosystems, true tropical rainforests have an annual rainfall greater than 2m and annual temperature greater than 24 degrees Celsius, with a potential evapotranspiration ratio (PET) value of &lt;0.25. However, most lowland tropical forests can be classified as tropical moist or wet forests, which differ in regards to rainfall. Tropical forest ecology- dynamics, composition, and function- are sensitive to changes in climate especially changes in rainfall.

=== Soils ===
==== Soil types ====
Soil types are highly variable in the tropics and are the result of a combination of several variables such as climate, vegetation, topographic position, parent material, and soil age. Most tropical soils are characterized by significant leaching and poor nutrients, however there are some areas that contain fertile soils. Soils throughout the tropical rainforests fall into two classifications which include the ultisols and oxisols. Ultisols are known as well weathered, acidic red clay soils, deficient in major nutrients such as calcium and potassium. Similarly, oxisols are acidic, old, typically reddish, highly weathered and leached, however are well drained compared to ultisols. The clay content of ultisols is high, making it difficult for water to penetrate and flow through. The reddish color of both soils is the result of heavy heat and moisture forming oxides of iron and aluminium, which are insoluble in water and not taken up readily by plants.

Soil chemical and physical characteristics are strongly related to above ground productivity and forest structure and dynamics. The physical properties of soil control the tree turnover rates whereas chemical properties such as available nitrogen and phosphorus control forest growth rates. The soils of the eastern and central Amazon as well as the Southeast Asian Rainforest are old and mineral poor whereas the soils of the western Amazon (Ecuador and Peru) and volcanic areas of Costa Rica are young and mineral rich. Primary productivity or wood production is highest in western Amazon and lowest in eastern Amazon which contains heavily weathered soils classified as oxisols. Additionally, Amazonian soils are greatly weathered, making them devoid of minerals like phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, which come from rock sources. However, not all tropical rainforests occur on nutrient poor soils, but on nutrient rich floodplains and volcanic soils located in the Andean foothills, and volcanic areas of Southeast Asia, Africa, and Central America.

Oxisols, infertile, deeply weathered and severely leached, have developed on the ancient Gondwanan shields. Rapid bacterial decay prevents the accumulation of humus. The concentration of iron and aluminium oxides by the laterization process gives the oxisols a bright red color and sometimes produces minable deposits (e.g., bauxite). On younger substrates, especially of volcanic origin, tropical soils may be quite fertile.

==== Nutrient recycling ====

This high rate of decomposition is the result of phosphorus levels in the soils, precipitation, high temperatures and the extensive microorganism communities. In addition to the bacteria and other microorganisms, there are an abundance of other decomposers such as fungi and termites that aid in the process as well. Nutrient recycling is important because below ground resource availability controls the above ground biomass and community structure of tropical rainforests. These soils are typically phosphorus limited, which inhibits net primary productivity or the uptake of carbon. The soil contains microbial organisms such as bacteria, which break down leaf litter and other organic matter into inorganic forms of carbon usable by plants through a process called decomposition. During the decomposition process the microbial community is respiring, taking up oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide. The decomposition rate can be evaluated by measuring the uptake of oxygen. High temperatures and precipitation increase decomposition rate, which allows plant litter to rapidly decay in tropical regions, releasing nutrients that are immediately taken up by plants through surface or ground waters. The seasonal patterns in respiration are controlled by leaf litter fall and precipitation, the driving force moving the decomposable carbon from the litter to the soil. Respiration rates are highest early in the wet season because the recent dry season results in a large percentage of leaf litter and thus a higher percentage of organic matter being leached into the soil.

==== Buttress roots ====

A common feature of many tropical rainforests is the distinct buttress roots of trees. Instead of penetrating to deeper soil layers, buttress roots create a widespread root network at the surface for more efficient uptake of nutrients in a very nutrient poor and competitive environment. Most of the nutrients within the soil of a tropical rainforest occur near the surface because of the rapid turnover time and decomposition of organisms and leaves. Because of this, the buttress roots occur at the surface so the trees can maximize uptake and actively compete with the rapid uptake of other trees. These roots also aid in water uptake and storage, increase surface area for gas exchange, and collect leaf litter for added nutrition. Additionally, these roots reduce soil erosion and maximize nutrient acquisition during heavy rains by diverting nutrient rich water flowing down the trunk into several smaller flows while also acting as a barrier to ground flow. Also, the large surface areas these roots create provide support and stability to rainforests trees, which commonly grow to significant heights. This added stability allows these trees to withstand the impacts of severe storms, thus reducing the occurrence of fallen trees.

=== Forest succession ===
Succession is an ecological process that changes the biotic community structure over time towards a more stable, diverse community structure after an initial disturbance to the community. The initial disturbance is often a natural phenomenon or human caused event. Natural disturbances include hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, river movements or an event as small as a fallen tree that creates gaps in the forest. In tropical rainforests, these same natural disturbances have been well documented in the fossil record, and are credited with encouraging speciation and endemism. Human land use practices have led to large-scale deforestation. In many tropical countries such as Costa Rica these deforested lands have been abandoned and forests have been allowed to regenerate through ecological succession. These regenerating young successional forests are called secondary forests or second-growth forests.

== Biodiversity and speciation ==

Tropical rainforests exhibit a vast diversity in plant and animal species. The root for this remarkable speciation has been a query of scientists and ecologists for years. A number of theories have been developed for why and how the tropics can be so diverse.

=== Interspecific competition ===
Interspecific competition results from a high density of species with similar niches in the tropics and limited resources available. Species which &quot;lose&quot; the competition may either become extinct or find a new niche. Direct competition will often lead to one species dominating another by some advantage, ultimately driving it to extinction. Niche partitioning is the other option for a species. This is the separation and rationing of necessary resources by utilizing different habitats, food sources, cover or general behavioral differences. A species with similar food items but different feeding times is an example of niche partitioning.

=== Pleistocene refugia ===
The theory of Pleistocene refugia was developed by Jürgen Haffer in 1969 with his article &quot;Speciation of Amazonian Forest Birds&quot;. Haffer proposed the explanation for speciation was the product of rainforest patches being separated by stretches of non-forest vegetation during the last glacial period. He called these patches of rainforest areas refuges and within these patches allopatric speciation occurred. With the end of the glacial period and increase in atmospheric humidity, rainforest began to expand and the refuges reconnected. This theory has been the subject of debate. Scientists are still skeptical of whether or not this theory is legitimate. Genetic evidence suggests speciation had occurred in certain taxa 1–2 million years ago, preceding the Pleistocene.

== Human dimensions ==
=== Habitation ===

Tropical rainforests have harboured human life for many millennia, with many Indigenous people in South and Central America, who belong to the Indigenous peoples of the Americas, the Congo Pygmies in Central Africa, and several tribes in Southeast Asia, like the Dayak people and the Penan people in Borneo. Food resources within the forest are extremely dispersed due to the high biological diversity and what food does exist is largely restricted to the canopy and requires considerable energy to obtain. Some groups of hunter-gatherers have exploited rainforest on a seasonal basis but dwelt primarily in adjacent savanna and open forest environments where food is much more abundant. Other people described as rainforest dwellers are hunter-gatherers who subsist in large part by trading high value forest products such as hides, feathers, and honey with agricultural people living outside the forest.

=== Indigenous peoples ===
Many indigenous peoples around the world live within rainforests as hunter-gatherers, or subsist as part-time small scale farmers supplemented in large part by trading high-value forest products such as hides, feathers, and honey with agricultural people living outside the forests. Peoples have inhabited the rainforests for tens of thousands of years and have remained so elusive that only recently have some tribes been discovered. These indigenous peoples are greatly threatened by loggers in search for old-growth tropical hardwoods like Ipe, Cumaru and Wenge, and by farmers who are looking to expand their land, for cattle(meat), and soybeans, which are used to feed cattle in Europe and China. On 18 January 2007, FUNAI reported also that it had confirmed the presence of 67 different uncontacted tribes in Brazil, up from 40 in 2005. With this addition, Brazil has now overtaken the island of New Guinea as the country having the largest number of uncontacted tribes. The province of Irian Jaya or West Papua in the island of New Guinea is home to an estimated 44 uncontacted tribal groups.
The pygmy peoples are hunter-gatherer groups living in equatorial rainforests characterized by their short height (below one and a half meters, or 59inches, on average). Amongst this group are the Efe, Aka, Twa, Baka, and Mbuti people of Central Africa. However, the term pygmy is considered pejorative so many tribes prefer not to be labeled as such.

Some notable indigenous peoples of the Americas, or Amerindians, include the Huaorani, Ya̧nomamö, and Kayapo people of the Amazon. The traditional agricultural system practiced by tribes in the Amazon is based on swidden cultivation (also known as slash-and-burn or shifting cultivation) and is considered a relatively benign disturbance. In fact, when looking at the level of individual swidden plots a number of traditional farming practices are considered beneficial. For example, the use of shade trees and fallowing all help preserve soil organic matter, which is a critical factor in the maintenance of soil fertility in the deeply weathered and leached soils common in the Amazon.

There is a diversity of forest people in Asia, including the Lumad peoples of the Philippines and the Penan and Dayak people of Borneo. The Dayaks are a particularly interesting group as they are noted for their traditional headhunting culture. Fresh human heads were required to perform certain rituals such as the Iban &quot;kenyalang&quot; and the Kenyah &quot;mamat&quot;. Pygmies who live in Southeast Asia are, amongst others, referred to as &quot;Negrito&quot;.

=== Resources ===
==== Cultivated foods and spices ====
Yam, coffee, chocolate, banana, mango, papaya, macadamia, avocado, and sugarcane all originally came from tropical rainforest and are still mostly grown on plantations in regions that were formerly primary forest. In the mid-1980s and 1990s, 40 million tons of bananas were consumed worldwide each year, along with 13 million tons of mango. Central American coffee exports were worth US$3 billion in 1970. Much of the genetic variation used in evading the damage caused by new pests is still derived from resistant wild stock. Tropical forests have supplied 250 cultivated kinds of fruit, compared to only 20 for temperate forests. Forests in New Guinea alone contain 251 tree species with edible fruits, of which only 43 had been established as cultivated crops by 1985.

=== Ecosystem services ===

In addition to extractive human uses, rain forests also have non-extractive uses that are frequently summarized as ecosystem services. Rain forests play an important role in maintaining biological diversity, sequestering and storing carbon, global climate regulation, disease control, and pollination. Half of the rainfall in the Amazon area is produced by the forests. The moisture from the forests is important to the rainfall in Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina Deforestation in the Amazon rainforest region was one of the main reason that cause the severe Drought of 2014–2015 in Brazil For the last three decades, the amount of carbon absorbed by the world&#x27;s intact tropical forests has fallen, according to a study published in 2020 in the journal Nature. In 2019 they took up a third less carbon than they did in the 1990s, due to higher temperatures, droughts and deforestation. The typical tropical forest may become a carbon source by the 2060s.

=== Tourism ===

Despite the negative effects of tourism in the tropical rainforests, there are also several important positive effects.
* In recent years ecotourism in the tropics has increased. While rainforests are becoming increasingly rare, people are travelling to nations that still have this diverse habitat. Locals are benefiting from the additional income brought in by visitors, as well areas deemed interesting for visitors are often conserved. &quot;Ecotourism can be an incentive for conservation, especially when it triggers positive economic change&quot;. Ecotourism can include a variety of activities including animal viewing, scenic jungle tours and even viewing cultural sights and native villages. If these practices are performed appropriately this can be beneficial for both locals and the present flora and fauna.
* An increase in tourism has increased economic support, allowing more revenue to go into the protection of the habitat. Tourism can contribute directly to the conservation of sensitive areas and habitat. Revenue from park-entrance fees and similar sources can be utilised specifically to pay for the protection and management of environmentally sensitive areas. Revenue from taxation and tourism provides an additional incentive for governments to contribute revenue to the protection of the forest.
* Tourism also has the potential to increase public appreciation of the environment and to spread awareness of environmental problems when it brings people into closer contact with the environment. Such increased awareness can induce more environmentally conscious behavior. Tourism has had a positive effect on wildlife preservation and protection efforts, notably in Africa but also in South America, Asia, Australia, and the South Pacific.

=== Threats ===
==== Deforestation ====

===== Mining and drilling =====

Deposits of precious metals (gold, silver, coltan) and fossil fuels (oil and natural gas) occur underneath rainforests globally. These resources are important to developing nations and their extraction is often given priority to encourage economic growth. Mining and drilling can require large amounts of land development, directly causing deforestation. In Ghana, a West African nation, deforestation from decades of mining activity left about 12% of the country&#x27;s original rainforest intact.

===== Conversion to agricultural land =====
With the invention of agriculture, humans were able to clear sections of rainforest to produce crops, converting it to open farmland. Such people, however, obtain their food primarily from farm plots cleared from the forest and hunt and forage within the forest to supplement this. The issue arising is between the independent farmer providing for his family and the needs and wants of the globe as a whole. This issue has seen little improvement because no plan has been established for all parties to be aided.

Agriculture on formerly forested land is not without difficulties. Rainforest soils are often thin and leached of many minerals, and the heavy rainfall can quickly leach nutrients from area cleared for cultivation. People such as the Yanomamo of the Amazon, utilize slash-and-burn agriculture to overcome these limitations and enable them to push deep into what were previously rainforest environments. However, these are not rainforest dwellers, rather they are dwellers in cleared farmland that make forays into the rainforest. Up to 90% of the typical Yanamomo diet comes from farmed plants.

Some action has been taken by suggesting fallow periods of the land allowing secondary forest to grow and replenish the soil. Beneficial practices like soil restoration and conservation can benefit the small farmer and allow better production on smaller parcels of land.

==== Climate change ====
The tropics take a major role in reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide. The tropics (most notably the Amazon rainforest) are called carbon sinks. As major carbon reducers and carbon and soil methane storages, their destruction contributes to increasing global energy trapping, atmospheric gases. Climate change has been significantly contributed to by the destruction of the rainforests. A simulation was performed in which all rainforest in Africa were removed. The simulation showed an increase in atmospheric temperature by 2.5 to 5 degrees Celsius.

==== Declining populations ====
Some species of fauna show a trend towards declining populations in rainforests, for example, reptiles that feed on amphibians and reptiles. This trend requires close monitoring. The seasonality of rainforests affects the reproductive patterns of amphibians, and this in turn can directly affect the species of reptiles that feed on these groups, particularly species with specialized feeding, since these are less likely to use alternative resources.

=== Protection ===
Efforts to protect and conserve tropical rainforest habitats are diverse and widespread. Tropical rainforest conservation ranges from strict preservation of habitat to finding sustainable management techniques for people living in tropical rainforests. International policy has also introduced a market incentive program called Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) for companies and governments to outset their carbon emissions through financial investments into rainforest conservation.

<doc id="931381" wikidata="Q7246960" url="?curid=931381" title="Problem of multiple generality">
<text>The problem of multiple generality names a failure in traditional logic to describe certain intuitively valid inferences. For example, it is intuitively clear that if:
:&quot;Some cat is feared by every mouse&quot;
then it follows logically that:
:&quot;All mice are afraid of at least one cat&quot;.
The syntax of traditional logic (TL) permits exactly four sentence types: &quot;All As are Bs&quot;, &quot;No As are Bs&quot;, &quot;Some As are Bs&quot; and &quot;Some As are not Bs&quot;. Each type is a quantified sentence containing exactly one quantifier. Since the sentences above each contain two quantifiers (&#x27;some&#x27; and &#x27;every&#x27; in the first sentence and &#x27;all&#x27; and &#x27;at least one&#x27; in the second sentence), they cannot be adequately represented in TL. The best TL can do is to incorporate the second quantifier from each sentence into the second term, thus rendering the artificial-sounding terms &#x27;feared-by-every-mouse&#x27; and &#x27;afraid-of-at-least-one-cat&#x27;. This in effect &quot;buries&quot; these quantifiers, which are essential to the inference&#x27;s validity, within the hyphenated terms. Hence the sentence &quot;Some cat is feared by every mouse&quot; is allotted the same logical form as the sentence &quot;Some cat is hungry&quot;. And so the logical form in TL is:
:&quot;Some As are Bs&quot;
:&quot;All Cs are Ds&quot;
which is clearly invalid.

The first logical calculus capable of dealing with such inferences was Gottlob Frege&#x27;s &quot;Begriffsschrift&quot; (1879), the ancestor of modern predicate logic, which dealt with quantifiers by means of variable bindings. Modestly, Frege did not argue that his logic was more expressive than extant logical calculi, but commentators on Frege&#x27;s logic regard this as one of his key achievements.

Using modern predicate calculus, we quickly discover that the statement is ambiguous.

:&quot;Some cat is feared by every mouse&quot;

could mean &quot;(Some cat is feared) by every mouse&quot; (paraphrasable as &quot;Every mouse fears some cat&quot;), i.e.

:&quot;For every mouse m, there exists a cat c, such that c is feared by m,&quot;
:formula_1

in which case the conclusion is trivial.

But it could also mean &quot;Some cat is (feared by every mouse)&quot; (paraphrasable as &quot; There&#x27;s a cat feared by all mice&quot;), i.e.

:&quot;There exists one cat c, such that for every mouse m, c is feared by m.&quot;
:formula_2

This example illustrates the importance of specifying the scope of such quantifiers as &quot;for all&quot; and &quot;there exists&quot;.

<doc id="931385" wikidata="Q7627372" url="?curid=931385" title="Stubby Clapp">
<text>Richard Keith &quot;Stubby&quot; Clapp (born February 24, 1973) is a Canadian professional baseball coach and former second baseman and Triple-A manager who is the first base coach for the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB). He played for 11 years, most notably within the Cardinals organization, including a brief stint in MLB with the Cardinals. In his native Canada, he is best remembered for his performance at the 1999 Pan American Games in Winnipeg, where he hit a bases-loaded single in the 11th inning to beat a more experienced U.S. team and put Canada in the semifinals. Canada eventually won the bronze medal.

==Early life==
In his youth, Stubby Clapp could be considered a two-sport athlete, having distinguished himself through the Windsor minor hockey system. After playing Bantam hockey in Windsor, Clapp played an important role for the Windsor Bulldogs (now the LaSalle Vipers), a junior hockey team, from 1990 to 1992. In 1991, the Bulldogs clinched first place during the regular season and Clapp scored five goals during the playoffs. For the 1991–1992 season, he was named captain of the team.

==Baseball career==
Clapp graduated from Texas Tech University, where he played for the Red Raiders baseball team. He still holds (or shares) the Red Raiders&#x27; records for triples in a season (eight), runs in game (five, three times), strikeouts in a game (four) and walks in a season (66), both set during the 1996 season.

He was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 36th round (1,058th overall) of 1996 amateur entry draft. In 1998, when playing for the Double-A Arkansas Travelers, he led the league with 86 walks and 139 games played. He remains popular among Travelers fans to this day. He also played for the Edmonton Cracker Cats. Clapp was also popular in Syracuse, New York, and other cities where he played.

In 1999, Clapp was part of the Canadian team at the Pan American Games in Winnipeg. A popular player with his teammates, Clapp became a minor celebrity in Canada after his game-winning, bases-loaded single against the U.S. team.

From –, he played for the Triple-A Memphis Redbirds. In 2000, he led the team with 138 hits, 89 runs, 80 walks, eight triples, and six sacrifice hits. He is second all-time for the Redbirds for games played (425) and hits (418). He was noted for doing a backflip every time he went onto the field.

In , Clapp played 23 games for the St. Louis Cardinals, during which he had five hits in 25 at-bats, including two doubles and one RBI.

Clapp became a popular figure in Memphis, Tennessee, during his four-year stint with the Redbirds. He was often referred to as the &quot;Mayor of Memphis&quot;. During the 2002 season, the Clapp was featured on a growth chart for kids sponsored by a Memphis-area medical group.

In 911 minor-league games, Clapp had a .270 batting average, 48 home runs, 50 triples, 196 doubles, 365 RBI, and 83 steals. Clapp also pitched in three games, pitching a total of innings, giving up two hits and no earned runs.

He was part of Team Canada in the 2004 Summer Olympics who finished in fourth place. He also played for Canada in the 2006 World Baseball Classic. In three games, Clapp hit .154, with a triple and an RBI.

In 2006, Clapp played for Canada in the inaugural World Baseball Classic. He was one of two second basemen on the roster and drove in a run.

In 2009, he was named one of the Memphis &quot;Athletes of the Decade&quot;. In 2010, the club had &quot;Ode to Clapping Night&quot;, which included giving away Clapp bobbleheads.

==Post-playing career==
On April 21, 2007, Clapp&#x27;s jersey #10 became the first number retired by the Memphis Redbirds, who painted &quot;10&quot; on the wall above their bullpen at AutoZone Park.

Clapp began his coaching career as a hitting coach for the Lexington Legends, the Houston Astros &quot;A&quot; ball team in the South Atlantic League. He came out of retirement to represent Canada at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, and was named to the roster for the 2009 World Baseball Classic.

In November 2010, Clapp became the hitting coach for the Corpus Christi Hooks, Houston&#x27;s Double-A affiliate.

Clapp managed the Tri-City ValleyCats, a Single-A affiliate of the Houston Astros, during the 2011 and 2012 seasons.

In January 2013, Clapp was hired as the hitting coach for the Dunedin Blue Jays, Toronto&#x27;s Advanced-A affiliate. On December 19, 2014, the New Hampshire Fisher Cats announced that he would be their new hitting coach.

Clapp was third base coach for the gold medal-winning Canada national baseball team at the 2015 Pan American Games in July 2015.

On November 30, 2016, the Cardinals named Clapp manager of the Memphis Redbirds. During the 2017 season, Memphis celebrated Clapp&#x27;s backflipping antics by hosting a bobblehead night featuring Clapp performing his signature move in bobblehead form. On the field, Clapp led the Redbirds to win the 2017 American Conference Southern Division title and was selected as the 2017 PCL Manager of the Year. The Redbirds became the 2017 PCL champions after defeating the El Paso Chihuahuas in five games in the league championship final. &quot;Baseball America&quot; named Clapp their Minor League Manager of the Year for 2017, becoming the first Cardinals minor league manager to win the award.

In 2018, Clapp again managed Memphis to the PCL title, defeating the Fresno Grizzlies in 4 games. The Redbirds went on to defeat the International League champion Durham Bulls in the AAA Championship Game. Clapp was also named the 2018 PCL Manager of the Year, making him just the third manager in PCL history to win the award in consecutive seasons.

On October 29, 2018, the St. Louis Cardinals announced Clapp will be their first base coach for the 2019 season.

There is a Stubby Clapp bobblehead on display at the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame, depicting him in a Memphis Redbirds uniform (the Triple A affiliate of the Cardinals).

==Personal life==
Clapp is &quot;Stubby the Third&quot;, a nickname passed on from his father (Keith Ezra &quot;Stubby II&quot; Clapp) and grandfather (David Ezra Oscar &quot;Stubby&quot; Clapp). He is married to Chastity, and they have three children.

<text>Daniel Victor Klassen (born September 22, 1975) is a Canadian former professional baseball infielder. He played four seasons with the Arizona Diamondbacks and one season with the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball (MLB).

==Early life==
Klassen was born to a Mennonite family in Leamington, Ontario and later attended high school at John Carroll Catholic High School in Fort Pierce, Florida. He was selected by the Milwaukee Brewers in the second round of the 1993 Major League Baseball draft.

==Career==
===Milwaukee Brewers===
In 1993, Klassen made his professional debut at the age of 17. He began with the Rookie–level Arizona League Brewers, appearing in 38 games and batting .222 with two home runs and 20 runs batted in. He stole 14 bases and was caught stealing three times. Klassen finished the 1993 season with the Helena Brewers, also a Rookie–level team. In 18 games with Helena, Klassen hit .200 and drove in three runs.

Klassen spent the 1994 season with the Single-A Beloit Brewers of the Midwest League. In 133 games, his average climbed to .260 and he totaled 6 homers, 54 RBI, and 28 stolen bases in 42 attempts. The following year, Klassen remained in Beloit and only appeared in 59 games. He batted .275 and tallied a pair of home runs, 25 runs batted in, and 12 stolen bases.

For the 1996 season, Klassen was promoted to the Stockton Ports of the California League. He made 118 appearances and posted a .269 average. Klassen hit two homers, drove in 46 runs, and stole 14 bases in 22 attempts.

Klassen joined the El Paso Diablos for the 1997 season. Playing in the AA–level Texas League, Klassen appeared in 133 games and his average rose to .331, which would prove to be a career–high. Klassen drove in 81 runs, also the most of his career, while hitting 14 home runs and stealing 16 bases. Klassen&#x27;s best statistical season in the Brewers organization was also his last. On November 18, 1997, Klassen was selected by the Arizona Diamondbacks in an expansion draft.

===Arizona Diamondbacks===
Arizona assigned Klassen to the AAA Tucson Sidewinders of the Pacific Coast League. Over the course of the 1998 season, he posted a .292 average with Tucson, tallying 10 homers, 47 RBI, and only 6 stolen bases over the course of 73 games. On July 4, Klassen made his Major League debut. Facing the Houston Astros, Klassen made four plate appearances, striking out once and drawing three walks. He was caught attempting to steal second base in the fifth inning. He made 29 appearances with the Diamondbacks in 1998, batting .194, with three home runs and 8 RBI. Klassen&#x27;s first Major League home run came on July 10, as he hit a two–run shot off Cincinnati Reds relief pitcher Danny Graves.

Klassen appeared in one game at the MLB level in 1999, again spending a majority of the season at Tucson. In 64 games with the Sidewinders, Klassen batted .269 with 6 homers, 33 RBI, and 5 steals.

Klassen split the 2000 season between Tucson and Arizona. In the minors, he batted .320 with a pair of home runs in 28 games. With the Diamondbacks, Klassen made 29 appearances and batted .237 with two homers.

In 2001, Klassen played in only seven games, all with the Sidewinders, and hit .222 (4 for 18).

Klassen split the 2002 season between El Paso, Tucson, and Arizona, spending the majority of the year at Tucson. With AA El Paso, now a Diamondbacks affiliate, Klassen appeared in 18 games and batted .231, a percentage point higher than the .230 average he posted in 103 games with Tucson. He hit a pair of home runs with both minor league teams. Klassen saw action in only four games at the Major League level, batting .333 (1 for 3).

===Detroit Tigers===
On January 10, 2003, Klassen signed with the Detroit Tigers. He split the 2003 season between the Tigers and their AAA affiliate, the Toledo Mud Hens. Klassen saw action in 112 games with the Mud Hens, batting .246 and tallying 11 homers and 48 RBI. At the major league level, Klassen made 22 appearances. He batted .247, with one home run and 7 RBI. Klassen played in his last MLB game on September 25.

Klassen spent the entirety of the 2004 season with Toledo. In 110 games, he batted .253, hitting 5 home runs and driving in 38 runs. After the season, Klassen became a free agent. On December 14, he signed with the Chicago Cubs. He was then sent to the Houston Astros on April 1, 2005.

Klassen was part of Team Canada in the 2004 Summer Olympics, which finished in fourth place. He was named to play for Canada at the 2006 World Baseball Classic. During the World Baseball Classic, he injured himself and took the 2006 season off.

In 2008, he played for the Houston Astros organization and retired at the end of the season.

<text>Going Straight is a British television sitcom created and written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, and starring Ronnie Barker and Richard Beckinsale. 

The programme was a direct sequel to the sitcom &quot;Porridge&quot;, which all four were involved in, with its premise surrounding the exploits of Barker&#x27;s character Norman Stanley Fletcher following his release from prison and his attempts to not commit another crime for the sake of his family, despite the allure that crime brings. The programme also featured the appearance of Patricia Brake, reprising her role in &quot;Porridge&quot;, and Nicholas Lyndhurst. Both Fulton Mackay and Tony Osoba guest starred in the first episode, also reprising their earlier roles.

==Episodes==

Six episodes of &quot;Going Straight&quot;, all written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, were produced for the BBC. The show began airing on 24 February and ended on 7 April 1978. All episodes had a running time of approximately 30 minutes.

== Production ==
A single series of six episodes was made and aired across 1978, attracting an audience of over 15 million viewers and winning a BAFTA TV Award for Best Situation Comedy in March 1979. In addition, the series was featured on the front cover of the 18 February 1978 edition of the &quot;Radio Times&quot;. Plans for further episodes were allegedly shelved after the premature death of Beckinsale in 1979, although in an interview published in &quot;Porridge: The Complete Scripts and Series Guide&quot; (2001), the writers stated that only one series was ever planned as Ronnie Barker would only agree to do the six episodes.

The theme tune, sung by Ronnie Barker, detailed Fletch&#x27;s determination to go straight, an ambition first laid out in the &quot;Porridge&quot; episode &quot;Men Without Women&quot;: This was released as 7-inch single by EMI records. The B-side is a track called &quot;The String Bean Queen&quot;.

<text>Chris Gueffroy (21 June 1968 – 6 February 1989) was the last person to be shot and the second-last to die in an escape attempt while trying to escape from East Berlin to West Berlin across the Berlin Wall.

==Biography==
Chris Gueffroy was born in Pasewalk, Bezirk Neubrandenburg (present-day Mecklenburg-Vorpommern) on 21 June 1968. He had an older brother, Stefan Gueffroy.

He moved to Schwedt in 1970, the same year that his mother, Karin Gueffroy, and his father, Allois Gueffroy, divorced. Three years later, when he was five years old, he moved to Berlin with his mother and his brother. When he was in the third grade, he was sent to the youth sports school SC Dynamo Berlin, based on his gymnastic talent. After he finished school he refused to pursue an officer’s career track in the National People’s Army and was consequently denied the right to study at university, ending his dream of becoming an actor or a pilot. In September 1985 he began an apprenticeship in the Schönefeld airport restaurant near Berlin after which he worked in a number of different restaurants. As a waiter, his income was better than average, and he had a strong degree of freedom, but he was disgusted by the widespread corruption in the restaurant business. His friend Christian Gaudian, whom he had met at gastronomy school, shared his feelings. At twenty, he found it increasingly unbearable to think that he would remain locked up with the knowledge that it would always be this way and that he would never have the freedom to decide for himself where he wanted to live. In mid-January 1989, upon learning that he was to be conscripted into the East German army the following May, he and Gaudian decided to leave East Germany.

==Death==
Gueffroy and Gaudian based their decision to try to flee over the wall on mistaken beliefs that the &quot;Schießbefehl&quot;, the standing order to shoot anyone who attempted to cross the wall, had been lifted (it had not), and that the Swedish prime minister Ingvar Carlsson was to pay a state visit to East Berlin (he had already left when they attempted their escape). Their attempted escape from East Berlin to West Berlin, along the Britz district canal, would take place on the night of 5–6 February 1989, about two kilometres (1¼ miles) from what would be Gueffroy&#x27;s last residence on Südostallee 218, Johannisthal, Treptow, East Berlin. Climbing the last metal lattice fence, the two were discovered and came under fire from the NVA border troops. Gueffroy was hit in the chest by two shots and died in the border strip. Gaudian, badly but not fatally injured, was arrested and was sentenced on 24 May 1989 to imprisonment of three years by the Pankow district court for attempted illegal border-crossing of the first degree (&quot;versuchten ungesetzlichen Grenzübertritts im schweren Fall&quot;). In September 1989 Gaudian was freed on bail by the East German government, and on 17 October 1989 he was transferred to West Berlin.

Chris Gueffroy is often erroneously named as the last person to die in the attempt to cross the wall, but he was in fact only the last to be killed through the use of weapons, and the second-last to die in an escape attempt. Winfried Freudenberg died in the crash of an improvised balloon aircraft by which he crossed the border into West Berlin on 8 March 1989.

==Aftermath==
As compensation for Karin Gueffroy&#x27;s loss, the East German government allowed her to go to West Berlin and visit Chris&#x27;s grave in Baumschulenweg weekly, with the condition that she would not speak to Western media about the incident. She would take residence in the West Berlin district of Moabit, on Oldenburger Straße 36.

The four border guards involved at the time at first obtained an award (&quot;Leistungsabzeichen der Grenztruppen&quot;) from the chief of the &quot;Grenzkommandos Mitte&quot; border guards, Erich Wöllner, and a prize of 150 East German Marks each. However, after the reunification of East and West Germany, they were prosecuted by the Berlin regional court. Two of the former border guards, Mike Schmidt (now a millwright with two children), and Peter Schmett (now an electrician with three children), were acquitted and released in January 1992, because the presiding judge, Theodor Seidel, ruled that they &quot;did not kill and did not intend to kill&quot;. A third former border guard, Andreas Kuehnpast (now unemployed), received a suspended sentence of two years. The fourth former border guard, Ingo Heinrich (now an electronic engineer), who was responsible for the mortal shot in the heart, was at first sentenced to three and a half years of jail. On appeal, the Bundesgerichtshof (High Court of Justice) in 1994 reduced the penalty to a suspended sentence of two years.

In 2000, two SED functionaries, Siegfried Lorenz and Hans-Joachim Böhme, were tried for the death of Gueffroy and two other young men, but acquitted as the judge could find no evidence that they might have been able to lift the shoot-to-kill order. The case was retried on 7 August 2004, and the two men were found guilty and given suspended sentences of 15 months each. The judge explained that the short sentences were due to the length of time since the events. This was the last case concerning deaths on the inner German border.

On 21 June 2003, which would have been his 35th birthday, a monument to Gueffroy was erected on the bank of the Britz district canal. The monument was designed by Berlin artist Karl Biedermann. One of the crosses at the White Crosses memorial site next to the Reichstag building is devoted to him.

On 13 August 2010 the Britzer Allee between Treptow and Neukölln was renamed Chris-Gueffroy-Allee.

<text>The FM Towns Marty is a home video game console released in 1993 by Fujitsu, exclusively for the Japanese market. It uses the AMD 386SX, a CPU that is internally 32-bit but with a 16-bit data bus. The console comes with a built-in CD-ROM drive and disk drive. It was based on the earlier FM Towns computer system Fujitsu had released in 1989. The Marty was backward-compatible with older FM Towns games.

In 1994, a new version of the console called the was released. It featured a darker gray shell and a lower price (¥66,000 or , but was otherwise identical to the first Marty. It was widely believed that the FM Towns Marty 2 would feature similar improvements to the FM Towns 2, which had a swifter CPU than the first, but this was not the case. It has also been speculated that the Marty 2 featured an Intel 486 CPU, but this was also discovered to be false.

There is also the for installation in automobiles. It included a built-in navigation system with audio and video guidance, and could also be detached from the car and played at home. An optional IC Card for the FM Towns Car Marty allowed it to use VICS, and was subsequently sold with a video monitor.

==Technical specifications==
;CPU: AMD 386SX processor (32-bit) (3.6 MIPS)
;RAM
:* Main RAM: 2 MB (2048 KB)
:* Video RAM: 640 KB (512 KB VRAM, 128 KB sprite RAM)
;Graphics
:* GPU: Fujitsu custom graphics chip
:* Display resolution: 256×240, 256×256, 320×240, 352×232, 360×240, 512×480, 640×200, 640×480, 720×480
:* Bitmap background planes: 1 (with sprite plane) or 2 (without sprite plane)
:** Virtual resolution: 256×512, 512×256, 512×512, 640×819, 1024×512
:** Color palette: 4096, or 32,768, or 16,777,216
:** Colors on screen: 16, or 256, or 32,768
:* Sprite foreground plane: 256×240 to 640×480 resolution, 256 colors on screen, out of 32,768 color palette
:* Hardware integer zooming: 1/2× vertical, 1/2/3/4/5× horizontalThe Marty had only composite and S-Video output; no other video connectors are possible. As some FM Towns games were VGA-only, the Marty had a down-scan capability for displaying on a household TV screen.
; Sprites: Up to 1024 sprites, 16×16 pixels sprite size, 16 colors per sprite
;Sound
:* Yamaha YM2612: 6 channel FM synthesis
:* Ricoh RF5c68: 8 channel PCM sampling, 10-bit audio, 19.6 kHz sample rate
:* CD-DA: 1 channel PCM playback, 16-bit audio, 44.1 kHz sampling rate
; Data storage
:* CD-ROM, single-speed (1x)
:* Internal 3.5&quot; HD floppy driveFloppy disks must be formatted 1232 KiB (PC98-style). This can be done from the BIOS GUI. The Marty&#x27;s disk drive does not support 1440 KiB or 720 KiB FAT-formatted 3.5&quot; floppy disks. For a PC to be compatible with FM Towns Marty floppies it must have a disk drive, BIOS and OS that supports There are also USB floppy drives that support 
; Multi-purpose: 

The Marty&#x27;s IC Card slot is compatible with type 1 PCMCIA cards, including battery-backed SRAM cards (accessible from the BIOS menu) that can be mapped to a drive letter and used as a small drive. Fujitsu also officially released a PCMCIA modem (FMM-CM301) for the FM Towns Marty. This modem was bundled with the special TCMarty that also came with a printer port. While it is widely believed that the IC Card slot can be used for RAM expansions, this is not correct.

;Controllers
:* 4-way D-pad, A and B buttons, Select, and Run, as well as an extra button above the two &quot;face&quot; buttons
:* 2 standard controller portsThe controller connector is a DE-9, referred to as an &quot;Atari Type&quot; in Japan because it is fundamentally the same connector as an Atari 2600. The Marty&#x27;s Run and Select buttons are the equivalent of pressing right and left, or up and down at the same time. A six-button controller from Fujitsu was available for use with Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;. Capcom also released an adapter for their CPS Fighter stick which made the stick compatible with the FM Towns/Marty as well as the Sharp X68000.
:* Keyboard port

==Games==
==Reception==

Despite having excellent hardware from a gameplay perspective, both the FM Towns and the FM Towns Marty were very poor sellers in Japan. They were expensive and the custom hardware meant expandability was not as easy as with DOS/V (IBM PC clones with Japanese DOS or Microsoft Windows) systems. NEC&#x27;s PC98 series computers were also dominant in Japan when the FM Towns Marty was released, making it difficult to break out before the DOS/V invasion took control of the market. This was despite such revolutionary features as bootable CD-ROMs and a color GUI OS on the FM Towns PC, something that predated Microsoft&#x27;s Windows 95b bootable CD by seven years. Software today is rare and expensive due to the low production runs. Despite backwards compatibility with most older FM Towns PC games, compatibility issues plagued the Marty as newer titles were released with the FM Towns in mind, further limiting its potential as a true &quot;console version&quot; of the FM Towns PC.

When Fujitsu lowered the price and released the Marty 2 sales started to increase, but the corporate attitude was that it was a lost cause, and so the system was dropped.

<doc id="931401" wikidata="Q746141" url="?curid=931401" title="Haven (Dark Tranquillity album)">
<text>Haven is the fifth studio album by Swedish melodic death metal band Dark Tranquillity, released on 25 July 2000. This release is the first recorded as a six-piece, the first to feature Mikael Niklasson and Martin Brändström, and the first release with Martin Henriksson on guitar, switching from his previous position on bass.

==Style==
&quot;Haven&quot; retains some of the death metal elements of past albums, adding more electronics and more polished production. Mikael Stanne mostly uses harsh vocals, but his clean vocals that were prominent on the previous album, &quot;Projector&quot;, are used on &quot;Emptier Still&quot; and bonus track &quot;In Sight&quot;, the latter showing more of a cleanly-sung rock style.

==Track listing==


Videos
* &quot;Therein&quot; (first digipak and Japan only)

==Reception==
Like the previous album, &quot;Projector&quot;, critical reception was mixed. Guitarist Niklas Sundin has been quite critical of the album, stating that this is his least favourite Dark Tranquillity album, considering it &quot;too safe in places&quot; and stating that the album &quot;could probably benefit from more variation&quot;. Despite the mixed feelings towards &quot;Haven&quot;, MetalGuru listed it #5 in its &quot;Retro 2000 Top 5 Albums.&quot; AllMusic called it &quot;inspired&quot; and a &quot;career milestone&quot;.

<text>John Francisco Rechy (born March 10, 1931) is a Mexican-American novelist and essayist. His novels are written extensively about gay culture in Los Angeles and wider America, among other subject matter. &quot;City of Night&quot;, his debut novel published in 1963, was a best seller. Drawing on his own background, he has contributed to Mexican-American literature, notably with his novel &quot;The Miraculous Day of Amalia Gomez&quot;, which has been taught in several Chicano studies courses throughout the United States. But, even after the success of his first novel, he still worked as a prostitute, teaching during the day, and hustling at night. He worked as a prostitute into his forties while also teaching at UCLA. Through the 1970&#x27;s and 1980&#x27;s he dealt with personal drug use, as well as the AIDS crisis, which killed many of his friends.

==Early life==
Rechy was born Juan Francisco Flores Rechy March 10, 1931, in El Paso, Texas. He was the youngest of five children born to Guadalupe (née Flores) and Roberto Sixto Rechy. Both of Rechy&#x27;s parents were natives of Mexico; his father was of Scottish lineage.

He earned a B.A. in English from Texas Western College (now University of Texas at El Paso), where he served as editor of the college newspaper.

Following graduation from college, Rechy enlisted in the U.S. Army. He was granted early release from the Army to enroll as a graduate student at Columbia University. He applied for admission to a creative writing class taught by novelist Pearl S. Buck by submitting an unpublished draft of a novel he had written titled &quot;Pablo!&quot; While his application to Buck&#x27;s class was not accepted, Rechy was admitted into the writing classes of Hiram Haydn, a senior editor at Random House, at the New School for Social Research.

The Cooper Do-nuts Riot happened in 1959 in Los Angeles, when the lesbians, gay men, transgender people, and drag queens who hung out at Cooper Do-nuts and who were frequently harassed by the LAPD fought back after police arrested three people, including Rechy. Patrons began pelting the police with donuts and coffee cups. The LAPD called for back-up and arrested a number of rioters. Rechy and the other two original detainees were able to escape. He later wrote about it in &quot;City of Night&quot;.

==Literary career==
Rechy is considered one of Mexican American Literature&#x27;s founding authors, and based his early writings on Mexican values and cultural problems that were available to him in Mexican films. Though he is probably the best-known gay male Latino writer in the United States, his gay-themed work reflects little of his Mexican-American heritage, except for the surnames of some of his characters.

While Rechy was working on his first novel, installments began to appear in 1958 in literary magazines such as &quot;Evergreen Review&quot;, &quot;Big Table,&quot; &quot;Nugget&quot;, and &quot;The London Magazine&quot;. These excerpts were fictitious recreations of his life working as a hustler in New York, Los Angeles and New Orleans and appeared alongside writers like Christopher Isherwood, Jack Kerouac and Jean Genet. The largely autobiographical novel &quot;City of Night&quot;, debuted in October 1963. Despite the predominantly negative reviews the book received at the time of its publication, &quot;City of Night&quot; became an international bestseller. Alternately, it is also often included on lists of the most banned books in America.

In addition to the dozen novels he has written to date, Rechy has contributed numerous essays and literary reviews to various publications including &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;L.A. Weekly&quot;, &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Evergreen Review&quot; and &quot;Saturday Review&quot;. Many of these writings were anthologized in his 2004 publication &quot;Beneath the Skin&quot;.
He has written three plays, &quot;Tigers Wild&quot; (first performed as &quot;The Fourth Angel&quot; and based on Rechy&#x27;s novel of that title), &quot;Rushes&quot; (based on his novel of the same title), and &quot;Momma as She Became—Not as She Was&quot;, a one-act play.

Rechy was cited by journalist Amy Harmon in a 2004 &quot;New York Times&quot; article that reported about a computer glitch on Amazon.com that suddenly revealed the identities of thousands of people who had anonymously posted book reviews. It was revealed that Rechy, among several other authors, had &quot;pseudonymously written themselves five-star reviews, Amazon&#x27;s highest rating&quot;. Amazon stopped accepting anonymous reviews as a result of this finding.

In 2021 Rechy was at work on a new novel entitled &quot;Beautiful People at the End of the Line&quot;, inspired by &quot;comic books and celebrity culture.&quot;

Rechy says of his work, &quot;An early admirer of my work labeled me &#x27;an accidental writer&#x27; — the kind who writes randomly, off the top of his head, the way Kerouac is reputed to have done. But that&#x27;s not true of me. I&#x27;m a very conscious writer, attentive to the right word, even the lengths of sentences, and punctuation for effect.&quot;

== Awards, honors and recognition ==
Rechy is the first novelist to receive PEN-USA-West&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award (1997); he is the recipient of the Bill Whitehead Award for Lifetime Achievement from Publishing Triangle (1999) and an NEA fellow. He is a faculty member at the Master of Professional Writing Program at the University of Southern California. He is the first recipient of &quot;ONE Magazine&quot; Culture Hero Award.

In 2016, he won the first annual Los Angeles Review of Books/UCR Creative Writing Lifetime Achievement Award.

At the 30th Lambda Literary Awards in 2018, he won the Lambda Literary Award for Gay Fiction for &quot;After the Blue Hour&quot;.

In 2018, Rechy was also awarded with the Robert Kirsch Award for lifetime achievement noting that he is &quot;a major figure in Mexican, LGBTQ and Los Angeles literary communities.&quot;

In 2020 The Texas Institute of Letters honored Rechy with its Lon Tinkle Lifetime Achievement Award. TIL President Carmen Tafolla called Rechy&#x27;s work &quot;a significant turning point in modern American literature, and a prose so poetically crafted it sharpens our perception of both the beauty and the ache of the human experience.&quot;

==Legacy==
Writers Michael Cunningham, Kate Braverman, Sandra Tsing Loh, and Gina Nahai were students of Rechy&#x27;s creative writing classes before becoming published authors.

Rechy&#x27;s contributions to women-centered narratives and the Chicana feminist canon are reflected in many of his works. Maria DeGuzman argues in her book, &quot;Understanding John Rechy&quot;, that &quot;his decolonial Chicana feminist representations of women indicate the fact that he has long understood the relationship that exists between misogyny and homophobia (against gay men as well as against LGBTQ+ more generally). The oppression of women and trans women (for example, &quot;Troja&quot; in &quot;Marilyn&#x27;s Daughter&quot;) is not just about Latinx communities; it is, in Rechy&#x27;s work, also about the larger U.S. culture.&quot;

English pop artist David Hockney&#x27;s painting &quot;Building, Pershing Square, Los Angeles&quot; was inspired by a passage in &quot;City of Night&quot;.

The 1983 song &quot;Numbers&quot; by the English synth-pop duo Soft Cell was inspired by Rechy&#x27;s 1967 novel of the same title.

A CD-ROM of Rechy&#x27;s life and work was produced by the Annenberg Center of Communications and is titled &quot;Mysteries and Desire: Searching the Worlds of John Rechy&quot;.

In 2019 the Wittliff Collection at Texas State University acquired Rechy&#x27;s complete archive stating, &quot;This treasure trove of letters serves as a virtual diary of one of the most significant periods in Rechy&#x27;s personal and literary life&quot;

Other artists who have acknowledged Rechy&#x27;s influence include David Bowie, Jim Morrison, Bob Dylan and Tom Waits.

<text>Stuart O&#x27;Grady (born 6 August 1973) is a retired Australian professional road bicycle racer, who rode as a professional between 1995 and 2013. A former track cyclist, O&#x27;Grady and Graeme Brown won a gold medal in the Men&#x27;s Madison at the 2004 Summer Olympics. O&#x27;Grady also won Paris–Roubaix in 2007. O&#x27;Grady competed in the Tour de France from 1997 and contended for the points classification in the Tour de France known as the green jersey, finishing second in the 1998, 1999, 2001 and 2005 races. He wore the yellow jersey of general classification leader in 1998 and 2001.

With his participation in the 2013 Tour de France, he tied George Hincapie&#x27;s record of 17 participations in the Tour de France. However, Hincapie was removed from three of his 17 starts for his part in the Lance Armstrong doping scandal, and O&#x27;Grady himself admitted having been assisted by illicit erythropoietin (EPO) use at least on the 1998 Tour de France (the Dutchman Joop Zoetemelk holds the absolute records of completed Tours de France, with 16 from 1970 to 1986).

He was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) in the 2005 Australia Day Honours &quot;for service to sport as a Gold Medallist at the Athens 2004 Olympic Games.&quot; O&#x27;Grady is the current Race Director of the Tour Down Under.

==Early life and amateur career==
Stuart O&#x27;Grady was born in Adelaide and grew up as a part of a cycling family. His father represented South Australia in road and track cycling, and his uncle, Robert Baird, is a former Australian cyclist who competed in the men&#x27;s team pursuit at the 1964 Summer Olympics.

As a student, he attended St Paul&#x27;s College. At this time, he started in track cycling and won a silver medal in the 4000m team pursuit at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona at age 18. In the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, he won bronze medals in both the points race and team pursuit. He was an Australian Institute of Sport scholarship holder.

==Professional career==
He joined the professional team, which included English time trial specialist Chris Boardman. This team became known as Crédit Agricole from 1999.

In the 1998 Tour de France, a race for which he confirmed to doping himself with illicit and proscribed erythropoietin, he wore the yellow jersey for three days. He also won his first stage. In 2001 he wore the yellow jersey for six days. He was &quot;Australian Cyclist of the Year&quot; and &quot;Australian Male Road Cyclist of the Year&quot; in 1998 and 2001. In 1998 he finished second in the green jersey classification. On 6 July 2000, he pulled out of the Tour de France after breaking his collarbone in three places with to the finish, he still finished the stage. In 2001, O&#x27;Grady had been in contention for the green jersey with Erik Zabel but he was defeated on the final day.

In 2001, he had a narrowing in the iliac artery. Tests showed his right leg produced more power than his left. After surgery in April 2002, he was again in contention in the 2002 Tour de France. In 2003 and 2004 he was overshadowed in the green jersey competition by fellow Australian sprinters Baden Cooke (2003) and Robbie McEwen (2004). O&#x27;Grady still managed to win his second Tour de France stage, in 2004.
O&#x27;Grady moved to in 2004 to concentrate on races such as Paris–Roubaix and the Tour of Flanders. After a start fraught with injuries and doping allegations in his team, he won two stages and the points classification in the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré. He won a stage in the 2004 Tour de France and spent a few days in the green jersey. He won the UCI Road World Cup race, HEW Cyclassics. He topped his victories by winning an Olympic gold medal in the madison cycling with Graeme Brown.

In the 2005 Tour de France, O&#x27;Grady came second in the green jersey classification to Thor Hushovd of Norway, followed by Robbie McEwen. Late in 2005, he signed a one-year contract with Bjarne Riis to ride on , now known as Saxo Bank, for 2006. He broke several ribs in an early season race in Italy and a vertebra in the Tour de France. O&#x27;Grady continued riding the Tour despite the pain, coming third in the final stage.

Early in 2007, O&#x27;Grady became the first Australian to win a major classic when he crossed the line first in Paris–Roubaix. He had a puncture midway but recovered to rejoin the field before arriving alone in the Roubaix Velodrome.

On 15 July 2007, O&#x27;Grady was forced to abandon on stage 8 of the 2007 Tour de France, from Le-Grand-Bornand to Tignes, after crashing on a descent, fracturing eight ribs, his right shoulder blade, right collar bone and three vertebrae, and puncturing his right lung.

O&#x27;Grady crashed into the 2009 Milan–San Remo when another rider came down in front of him, he punctured his lung and suffered a broken right collar bone once again as well as a broken rib.

On 8 August 2011, O&#x27;Grady announced that he had joined the new Australian team for 2012. He announced his retirement from professional cycling as a competitive rider on 23 July 2013, following the conclusion of the 2013 Tour de France.

===Doping===
On 24 July 2013, O&#x27;Grady was named in the French Senate report detailing EPO use in the 1998 Tour de France as having returned a sample suspicious for EPO use. He confirmed the same day in an interview with an Australian newspaper that he had taken EPO prior to the 1998 Tour de France, but stated that the arrests around that Tour scared him off doping in the rest of his career.

This announcement has created some controversy amongst cycling fans, as O&#x27;Grady had been a vocal critic of the doping culture that existed in the late 1990s and early 2000s. As a result of his doping admission, the Australian Institute of Sport indefinitely suspended O&#x27;Grady from its &#x27;Best of the Best&#x27;. O&#x27;Grady had been inducted in 2006.

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Grady set up and financially supports an Australian junior cycling development team, CSC Team O&#x27;Grady, which was established in 2005.

O&#x27;Grady is today a member of the &#x27;Champions for Peace&#x27; club, a group of 54 famous elite athletes committed to serving peace in the world through sport, created by Peace and Sport, a Monaco-based international organisation.

O&#x27;Grady supports the Port Adelaide Power in the Australian Football League.

The Stuart O&#x27;Grady Bikeway adjacent to the Northern Expressway in the northern suburbs of Adelaide is named after O&#x27;Grady.
