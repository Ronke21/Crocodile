<text>A reseller is a company or individual (merchant) that purchases goods or services with the intention of selling them rather than consuming or using them. Individual resellers are often referred to as middle men. This is usually done for profit (but can be done at a loss). One example can be found in the industry of telecommunications, where companies buy excess amounts of transmission capacity or call time from other carriers and resell it to smaller carriers. Resale can be seen in everyday life from yard sales to selling used cars.

According to the Institute for Partner Education &amp; Development, a reseller&#x27;s product fulfillment–based business model includes a corporate reseller, retail seller, direct market reseller (DMR), and an internet retailer (eTailer); less than 10 percent of its revenue comes from services.

==Internet==
Resellers are known to conduct operations on the Internet through sites on the web.

For example, this occurs where individuals or companies act as agents for ICANN accredited registrars. They either sell on commission or for profit and in most cases, but not all, the purchase from the registrar and the sale to the ultimate buyer occurs in real time. These resellers are not to be confused with speculators, who purchase many domain names with the intention of holding them and selling them at some future time at a profit. Resellers, by the very nature of their business are retailers, not wholesalers. It is not unheard of for online pawn shops like iPawn to also act as a reseller, and purchase rather than loan against valuables. Online auction and classifieds websites, such as those owned by eBay Inc. and Craigslist provide services for resellers to sell their goods and services. However although resellers are indeed retailers it does not follow that retailers are resellers.

Another common example of this is in the web hosting area, where a reseller will purchase bulk hosting from a supplier with the intention of reselling it to a number of consumers at a profit.

=== Digital platforms for resale ===
Some of the platforms used to resell are websites and apps such as Poshmark, eBay, Mercari, thredUP, Facebook Marketplace, and many more. All these platforms have products that are new, resold, and even used. Several major companies have an extension to their franchise in which they sell their own products that may be &quot;out of season&quot;, used, or recycled and resell them. Examples of this would be COACH (Re)Loved and LEVI Secondhand. By reselling, these companies are decreasing the amount of waste they produce, reducing their carbon footprints, and bringing back past styles/trends.

==Software and ebooks==
Software and ebooks are two products that are very easy to obtain by resellers. Their digital format makes them ideal for internet distribution. In many cases, such as brandable software, the reseller can obtain even the right to change the name of the software and claim it as one&#x27;s own and resell it on an ebook shop hosting platform.

A software reseller is a consultant who sells the software from large companies under a licence. They have no legal employment status with the parent company and generally operate on a freelance basis.

=== Business model ===
The companies visited to and pitched to by software resellers are often small and medium enterprises (SMEs), local businesses and niche operators. This benefits the software house as they may not hold the resources for the legwork needed to spread their network on a lower scale. While it benefits the reseller because they can build up networks of smaller clients and become a single point of contact for them for every aspect concerned with the software, be it advice, training or updating.

== Web resellers ==
A subcategory of reseller is a web operative who will buy a large amount of hosting space from an Internet service provider (ISP) and then resell some of this space to clients. Their hosting is often managed through a virtual private server (VPS) which allows them, through a control panel, to administer bandwidth, databases, passwords etc, for the client.

The popularity of this business model grew with the rise of freelance web designers as it enabled them to be the sole service provider for the client. After an initial consultation with the client they could subsequently design, develop and also host the site as a single operation.

== Sustainability ==
Reselling creates a circulation of products, whether that be clothes, technology, books, etc. This circulation extends the lifespan of products and reduces the amount of waste in landfills. This process of reselling also minimizes the carbon footprint of clothes, potentially reducing it by approximately 82% versus purchasing new clothing. A used product purchased over a new one, such as clothing, is capable of saving about 1 kilograms of waste, 22 kilograms of CO2, and 3,040 liters of water.

== The rise of Resale ==
$175 billion is the amount that Global Data predicted for the total resale market of 2023 in the United States. But in fact, Global Data confirms that this value was exceeded and in 2023 the total resale market reached approximately $193.7 billion.

=== History ===
Dating back to the Middle Ages, trading of secondhand clothing was common for impoverished communities. Although the concept of &quot;thrifting&quot; sprouted long before, it wasn&#x27;t until the formation of official organizations such as The Salvation Army and Goodwill that secondhand clothing/items flourished. Even though the popularity of resale/secondhand items fluctuates, it remains familiar in the 21st century.

== Artificial intelligence ==
AI is being used in the works of resale, allowing resellers to automatically purchase high-demand products without actively being present. With such technology, resellers can focus on other important tasks all while getting their inventory at the best possible price with the help of AI. This doesn&#x27;t mean that people should disregard their involvement with business purchases, as it remains essential for resellers to monitor expenses and participate in decision-making.

<text>Wei Yili (; born 24 June 1982) is a former badminton player from China.

== Career ==
A women&#x27;s doubles specialist, since 2001 Wei has competed on the world circuit in partnership with a variety of her fellow countrywomen, but most often with Zhang Jiewen, Zhao Tingting or Zhang Yawen. A member of China&#x27;s perennial world champion Uber Cup teams, in the biggest events for individual players (such as the BWF World Championships, the All-England Championships, and the Olympic Games) Wei and her partners have usually been overshadowed by China&#x27;s two dominant women&#x27;s doubles pairs, Gao Ling and Huang Sui, and Yang Wei and Zhang Jiewen. One exception came at the 2007 All-Englands where Wei Yili and Zhang Yawen defeated both of these teams to capture the highly coveted title. Her other women&#x27;s doubles titles include the China (2001), Singapore (2001, 2007), Denmark (2002, 2004), Thailand (2003), Indonesia (2006), and French (2007) Opens.

Wei has medaled four times at the BWF World Championships without &quot;striking gold&quot;. She earned a silver with Zhang Jiewen in 2001, a silver with Zhao Tingting in 2003, a silver with Zhang Yawen in 2006, and a bronze with Zhang Yawen in 2007. She finished fourth at the 2004 Olympics in Athens with Zhao Tingting. At the 2008 Beijing Olympics Wei and Zhang Yawen were beaten in the semifinals by yet another Chinese pair, Du Jing and Yu Yang, who went on to win the gold medal. Wei and Zhang earned a bronze medal by defeating Japan&#x27;s Miyuki Maeda and Satoko Suetsuna in the playoff for third place.

In 2008, Wei retired from the national team. She received an award during a ceremony to mark her retirement with five other teammates from the Chinese national badminton team on the sidelines of the China Open badminton event in Shanghai, November 23, 2008. However, she was still playing a year later by partnering with Gao Ling. They lost to Yang Wei and Zhang Jiewen in the Thailand Open final of 2009, but won the Philippines Open of 2009.

<doc id="930713" wikidata="Q5148721" url="?curid=930713" title="Peach (color)">
<text>Peach is a color that is named for the pale color of the interior flesh of the peach fruit. This name may also be substituted for &quot;peachy&quot;. Like the color apricot, the color &quot;peach&quot; is paler than most actual peach fruits and seems to have been formulated (like the color apricot) primarily to create a pastel palette of colors for interior design.

==Peach==
The color peach approximates the color of the interior flesh of that variety of peaches known as &quot;white peaches&quot;.

The first recorded use of &quot;peach&quot; as a color name in English was in 1588.
==Etymology==

The etymology of the color peach (and the fruit): the word comes from the Middle English &quot;peche&quot;, derived from Middle French, in turn derived from Latin &quot;persica&quot;, i.e., &quot;the fruit from Persia&quot;. In actuality, the ultimate origin of the peach fruit was from China.
==Variations==
===Peach (RYB)===

Displayed at right is the color that is called &quot;peach&quot; in the RYB color system. It is a mixture of white and some orange.
===Peach puff===

Displayed at right is the web color peach puff.
===Peach===
Displayed at right is the deep tone of peach called &quot;peach&quot; in Crayola crayons. Prior to 1962, it was known as &quot;flesh&quot;, but the name was changed to &quot;peach&quot;, ostensibly in recognition of the Civil Rights Movement.

==In nature==
Fungi
* The peach-colored fly agaric is a peach-colored mushroom.

==In culture==
Interior Design
* In Art Deco interior design of the 1920s and 1930s, peach-colored mirrors (as well as blue mirrors) were often seen installed in exclusive luxury homes, and in nightclubs and hotels catering to the upper classes. Peach color is also recommended for bedroom to have a good sleep.

Religion
* The color peach represents immortality in Chinese culture because &quot;The Peach Tree of Immortality&quot;, long thought to be on a mountainside somewhere in the Tian Shan in western China, and which blooms only once every 3,000 years, is a key concept in the mythology of the Taoist religion.

Sexuality
* In the bandana code of the gay leather subculture, wearing a peach bandana means that one is a &quot;bear&quot; or a &quot;cub&quot; looking for a bear.

<text>Cotgrave () is a town and civil parish in the borough of Rushcliffe in Nottinghamshire, England. It is 5 miles (8 km) south-east of Nottingham. It perches on the South Nottinghamshire Wolds about 131 feet (40 metres) above sea level. The population of the parish in the 2001 census was 7,373 which then decreased to 7,203 at the 2011 census, though Owthorpe was included. It was estimated at 8,113 in 2019. Statistics from the 2021 census show the population had risen to 8,206.

==History==
Cotgrave&#x27;s origins may be in the Iron Age. A 6th-century Anglo-Saxon burial ground has been excavated at Mill Hill to the north of the old village. There was certainly a Saxon church a century before the Norman Conquest. The Roman Fosse Way passes a mile to the east, where it changes direction slightly. The A46 follows its course, and during improvements in 2012–13, excavations uncovered Ice Age flint tools. Evidence of an Iron Age settlement was also found at Owthorpe Junction, just to the east, and a 4,000-year-old Neolithic circular monument with eight Bronze Age burials emerged slightly further north at Stragglethorpe junction.

The place-name Cotgrave seems to contain an Old English personal name, &quot;Cotta&quot;, + &quot; grāf &quot; (Old English), grove or copse, to make &#x27;Cotta&#x27;s grove&#x27;.
The present substantial church, All Saints&#x27;, dates from the 12th century, with several subsequent alterations and additions. An arson attack in 1996 caused considerable damage, but the church has since been restored at great expense. The church has a ring of eight bells, most made by Taylor&#x27;s. A team of ringers practises regularly on Fridays and Sundays.

An outbreak of plague in 1637 killed 93 of a population of 500, including 46 children. All Saints&#x27; was used as a food store for the village during the outbreak. Money to pay for goods was disinfected as it was passed through a hollowed stone filled with vinegar to the men who had locked themselves away in the church. This stone is still in the church. On Scrimshire Lane, near the church, can be found an old wall, dubbed the &quot;Thousand-Year Wall&quot;. It is riddled with small holes made by, and providing a home for a large group of solitary bees. Nearby, through a lych gate, is a graveyard that is separated from the church by a road. There can be found there a pillar on three tiers commemorating those of the village lost in service during the world wars. The church has a stained-glass window by J. F. Gascoyne &amp; Son of Nottingham, dedicated in 1920 as a war memorial. There is also a window on the north aisle, east of the north door, depicting the koepe towers and underground workings of Cotgrave Colliery, which was sunk in the 1960s and abandoned in the 1980s. The window was installed after the fire at the church in 1996.

===Memorials===
Cotgrave has a war memorial sited in the graveyard at Scrimshaw Lane to the west of All Saints. It commemorates the fallen of both world wars. The War Memorials Trust has helped with the upkeep of this. 
Twelve men from the First World War are listed above four from the Second World War on two metal panels on the east face of the memorial. The south face (presumably added at a later date as there was no room on the east face), names Walter Henstock, died 1920. An active British Legion group that includes nearby villages marked the four-year centenary of the Great War by researching the men from the villages who gave their lives. Details of the Colston Bassett, Owthorpe and Cotgrave Great War Project, as far as they can be traced so far, appear on its website.

The surnames of those noted lost in the First World War are Lacey, Hind, Middleton, Herapath, Simpson, Henson, Hayes, Harrison, Marshall, Moulds, Carrington, Woolley, Henstock. Those from the Second World War; Cole, Pryor, Pepper, Phillips. The epitaph reads: &quot;Be thou faithful unto death and I will give you a crown of life.&quot; 
The epitaph is often referred to as the Cotgrave Cross, as is a six-foot-high monument at the east end of the church. With later, partly ashlar construction parts from the 20th century and parts from the 16th, it is somewhat of a mystery, as it is thought of as ancient, yet does not appear on photographs or pictures before the early 20th century. The site is near an important old junction, but there is no surviving medieval stonework evident. There were ideas of moving the war memorial to that site and the Cross moved perhaps to the country park, but these were dismissed as too costly.

There is a further memorial plaque, carved in oak, displayed to the right of the north door in All Saints&#x27; and a commemorative stained glass window to the east of the south aisle.

To the north at Cotgrave Place near the golf course is a memorial to a Vickers Wellington bomber that crashed on 8 February 1941. The aircraft from No. 12 Squadron, recently dispersed from RAF Station Binbrook to nearby RAF Station Tollerton, was on a gunnery training flight when the pilot met control problems. The aircraft hit an oak tree just short of the still extant runway, next to where the golf club house stands. A plaque nearby recalls seven of the crew who were killed.

==Cotgrave Colliery==

The town lies on the Grantham Canal, opened in 1797. Some exploration for coal had been attempted for a hundred years but none was discovered in the area until about 1950. Cotgrave Colliery was established in the early 1960s with large numbers of miners and their families being moved from other mining areas of England, especially the North East, to live on a large purpose-built housing estate. Initially, in 1962, around 500 experienced mining workers and their families, accepted the National Coal Board incentive of tied new houses complete with furnishings to move from the area of the recently closed Radford Mine on the north-west side of nearby Nottingham. This mine was near the site of what is now known as Bobber&#x27;s Mill. Some four years later a similar scheme was introduced to attract miners from other worked-out mines in the North East of England, including Gateshead. According to residents, special meetings were arranged so that workers already established could understand, for safety reasons, the dialect, and vice versa, of the newcomers. The population of the village rose from about 700 to over 5,000 within a few years. In 1960, a branch railway was extended from the Nottingham–Grantham line across the River Trent past Radcliffe on Trent to the colliery. The line closed when the pit closed in 1993. The koepe towers at the pit head were considered very modern and distinctive compared with other pit-head winding-gear towers. In a departure from traditional miners&#x27; working conditions, face workers had extensive modern changing and shower facilities, which meant they could leave as clean as they entered.

The local economy was devastated by the mine&#x27;s closure in 1993–94, which caused much bitterness. Like most Nottinghamshire mines, Cotgrave had continued working through the National Union of Mineworkers-declared 1984–85 miners&#x27; strike. Many took the view that this allegiance to the then Conservative government was betrayed. On its closure, it was reported that the seams had millions of tons of coal reserves but these were of insufficient quality. Local residents, however, recount that the mine was shut because of geological faults, the encounter of a subterranean stream and subsequent flood problems, and the growing remoteness of the seam face from the shaft, which drastically increased the cost of bringing the coal to the surface. The shafts were filled with concrete on closure and all associated buildings demolished.

The local economy has improved considerably as Cotgrave is surrounded by an affluent area with low unemployment. Many of the mineworkers who hailed from the North East stayed in Cotgrave, built homes and raised families.

==Amenities==

There is a shopping parade called the Precinct, built at the same time as the large housing estates were developed, with a Co-op, a library, fish and chip shop, Chinese and kebab take-aways, other retailers, and a medical centre. This was regenerated in 2017–2020, with the demolition of several old buildings, the erection of new facades on some shops, and construction of a multi-service centre that now holds the library, medical practice, pharmacy and police station, as well as office space. A new children&#x27;s play area, an expanded car parking area and new landscaping were also added. Development continues in 2020.

The Church of England church is All Saints, on Plumtree Road. There is also has a Methodist chapel, dating from 1802 and a Roman Catholic church, (Our Lady of Grace). &quot;The Cross&quot; is a booklet produced monthly by the Anglican church.

Near the parish church is a small Sainsbury&#x27;s Local store, and adjacent to that, The Pig and Pudding café. The leisure centre has a large swimming pool, gymnasium and sports hall with playing fields. There are two allotment areas, off Burrhill and Forest Close, and Cotgrave Community Gardens, a community led project that is run by volunteers to grow fruit and vegetables.

There are two primary schools: Cotgrave Candleby Lane School and Cotgrave Church of England (Aided) Primary School. The latter first opened in 1720, and moved to the present building, built by Earl Manvers, in 1863. Another school, Ash Lea School, is a day, community Special School for pupils between the ages of three and nineteen who experience complex learning difficulties.

Nearby is Cotgrave Futures, with Sure Start and meeting facilities. There are two pubs: the &quot;Manvers Arms&quot;, named after the Manvers family, which owned much of the land in the area, and the &quot;Rose and Crown&quot; towards the north of the village. A third pub, the &quot;Black Diamond&quot;, was built in the early 1980s but closed in 2006, demolished and replaced with housing, known as Diamond Cottages.

==Media==
In terms of television, the town is served by &quot;BBC East Midlands Today&quot; and &quot;ITV News Central&quot; (East).

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Nottingham, Capital East Midlands, Smooth East Midlands, and The Eye, a community based station which broadcast from Melton Mowbray

==Community==

Across the road from the leisure centre is Cotgrave Club. The Miners&#x27; Welfare Club was built in the early 1960s. An unremarkable building at first sight but of prodigious size, it boasts several bars, a garden, family and snooker rooms, entertainment suites with their own bars, and one of the largest fully equipped stages in the region. The main hall can seat several hundred and has two dedicated bars, a food bar and a gallery. The various rooms and hall are available for hire.

The club has a cricket and football team with grounds enough to field two football matches. There are changing rooms and pavilion facilities for home and visiting teams. The village also has an angling club. In 2012 the club hosted the Cotgrave Festival of Sports, a variety of sporting events through the last week in June, culminating in a finale day of presentations and entertainment. Involving all the schools and community, this was repeated in 2013–14 and is intended to continue annually.

There is also a Kickboxing club based at Cotgrave Leisure Centre which is through KickboxUK (Professional Kickboxing Association – Cotgrave).

At the end of 2011 the people of Cotgrave launched Cotgrave Community Website. This forum is paid for by the council but run by the council and local residents. Members are registered with their real names and checked on the electoral roll.

==Country park==

The extensive former mining area has been landscaped as a country park, with a long section of the Grantham Canal partially restored, including at least two locks. This is not presently navigable, but nearby road bridges have been removed. though in other areas of the Grantham Canal some bridges have been rebuilt to accommodate canal traffic. Plans to put the canal back to water were gradually taking shape, and as a brownfield site in a rural area, the old pit-head area could serve for building a marina. This pit-head area is cordoned off from public and there are plans for redevelopment. Plans to build around 470 houses on the site would impact the infrastructure and the ongoing development of the country park.

Planted woodland is now beginning to mature and the country park is gradually acquiring a diverse population of wildlife. Wildfowl abound, with reports of cuckoos, warblers, swallows, little ringed plover, yellow wagtail, ring ouzel, wheatear, chiffchaff and dabchicks. Great crested newts are reported to be established in the lake, and hares, rabbits, foxes, bats and owls are present. The lake, pictured, is well stocked and used by anglers regularly. Fishing platforms have been built around the lake and reed beds established to protect the breeding waterfowl, including a variety of ducks, coots, swans and heron.

The park has a picnic area, car parks, a gallop for horse riders and a nature trail. The area features woodland, lake and canal side walks, and takes a route along the old railway track, where a short section of original rails and sleepers has been left in place. A voluntary group called Friends of Cotgrave Country Park works to maintain and improve the facilities at the park, and meets regularly. Details appear on the Rushcliffe Council website. The group in 2010–2012 helped to plan and build a swimming pool for dogs, away from the vulnerable wildlife in the country park&#x27;s lake.

<text>Huang Sui (; born 8 January 1982) is a Chinese-Australian female badminton player.

==Career==
Although Huang has won the Chinese National mixed doubles title almost all of her many international titles have come in women&#x27;s doubles with Gao Ling, in a partnership where Huang&#x27;s strength and consistency in the backcourt have complemented Gao&#x27;s ability in the forecourt. They have captured over thirty top tier events since 2001, sharing dominance at the world level with their Chinese teammates and rivals Yang Wei and Zhang Jiewen. Huang and Gao have been especially successful at the All-England Championships, winning a record six consecutive finals there, three of them over Yang and Zhang, from 2001 through 2006. They reached the final of five consecutive editions of the BWF World Championships; winning in 2001, 2003, and 2006, and finishing second to Yang and Zhang in 2005 and 2007. Huang was a silver medalist with Gao at the 2004 Athens Olympics also won by Yang and Zhang. Neither team figured in the medals at the 2008 Olympics (won by another Chinese pair, Du Jing and Yu Yang). Huang has been a member of China&#x27;s perennial world champion Uber Cup (women&#x27;s international) team since 2002. In 2005 Huang&#x27;s smash was clocked at . She retired from the sport at the end of the 2007 season and subsequently moved to Sydney, Australia with her husband.

After a long absence from the sport Huang returned to the court in 2012, this time as an Australian.

<text>Gao Ling (; born 14 March 1979) is a Chinese former badminton player.

==Career==

Noted for her consistency, anticipation, forecourt prowess, and sporting smile, Gao is one of the most successful doubles players in the history of women&#x27;s badminton. Her four Olympic badminton medals are the most of any player.

She has won titles at almost every top tier tournament in the world. Gao has earned four gold medals (among nine medals in total) at the BWF World Championships, three of them in women&#x27;s doubles with Huang Sui (2001, 2003, and 2006) and one of them in mixed doubles with Zhang Jun (2001). She and Zhang Jun won consecutive gold medals in mixed doubles at the 2000 and 2004 Olympics, overcoming severe tests in both.

Gao has not earned an Olympic gold medal in women&#x27;s doubles, a relative gap in her resume, but earned a bronze medal in 2000 with Qin Yiyuan, and a silver medal with Huang Sui in 2004. From 2001 through 2006 she and Huang captured a record six consecutive women&#x27;s doubles titles at the venerable All-England Championships. Their All-England streak was finally broken in the semifinals of the 2007 tournament by fellow countrywomen Zhang Yawen and Wei Yili. Gao has shared five All-England mixed doubles titles: three with Zhang Jun (2001, 2003, and 2006), and two with Zheng Bo (2007 and 2008).

She has been a member of the perennial world champion Chinese Uber Cup (women&#x27;s international) team since 2000. Gao Ling received an award during a ceremony to mark her retirement with five other teammates from the Chinese national badminton team on the sidelines of the China Open badminton event in Shanghai, November 23, 2008. However, she was still playing a year later by partnering with Wei Yili. They lost to Yang Wei and Zhang Jiewen in the Thailand Open final of 2009, but won the Philippines Open of 2009.

<text>Joanna Dove Hayes (born December 23, 1976, Williamsport, Pennsylvania) is an American hurdler, who won the gold medal in the 100 metres hurdles at the 2004 Summer Olympics.

She originally specialized in the 400 metres hurdles. She won the silver medal at the 1999 Summer Universiade in a career best time of 54.57 seconds, and the gold medal at the 2003 Pan American Games. She competed at the 1999 World Championships and 2003 World Championships without reaching the final.

From 2004 she competed internationally in the 100 metres hurdles. She finished fourth at the 2004 World Indoor Championships, and in August she won the Olympic gold medal in a career best time of 12.37 seconds. She also won the 2004 World Athletics Final toward the end of the season.

At the 2005 World Championships, she was among the favorites, having run 12.47 seconds in June. She did reach the final race, only to fail to finish after stumbling in the hurdles. She finished third at the 2005 World Athletics Final. After that, mediocre seasons followed with 12.76 (2006), 13.28 (2007) and 12.63 seconds (2008) as her season&#x27;s best times. She failed to qualify for the 2008 Olympics due to injury.

While in high school at John W. North High School in Riverside, California she won both the 100 meter hurdles (setting the meet record) and 300 meter hurdles at the CIF California State Meet in 1995 and was named the national Girl&#x27;s &quot;High School Athlete of the Year&quot; by Track and Field News. Receiving a track scholarship, she competed for UCLA.

While assistant coach at the University of Southern California, where she has coached from 2017 to the 2024 season, she was named Athletic Director for Track and Field and Cross Country. She was the former personal coach (2018-2020) to professional runner and 400m hurdle world recorder holder Sydney McLaughlin. Previously, she was an assistant coach at UCLA from 2014 through 2016, and prior to that she coached track and field and cross country at Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles, California. She is the daughter of Los Angeles homeless advocate Ted Hayes. She gave birth to a daughter, Zoe, in December 2010. Hayes began her comeback to competition in 2012.

Hayes was inducted into the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame on October 11, 2014

<doc id="930724" wikidata="Q331811" url="?curid=930724" title="War (U2 album)">
<text>War is the third studio album by Irish rock band U2. It was produced by Steve Lillywhite, and was released on 28 February 1983 on Island Records. The album is regarded as U2&#x27;s first overtly political album, in part because of songs like &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; and &quot;New Year&#x27;s Day&quot;, as well as the title, which stems from the band&#x27;s perception of the world at the time; lead vocalist Bono stated that &quot;war seemed to be the motif for 1982.&quot;

U2 recorded the album from September to November 1982 at Windmill Lane Studios with Lillywhite producing, the group&#x27;s third consecutive album made at the studio with the producer. While the central themes of U2&#x27;s previous albums &quot;Boy&quot; and &quot;October&quot; were adolescence and spirituality, respectively, &quot;War&quot; focused on both the physical aspects of warfare, and the emotional after-effects. Musically, it is also harsher than the band&#x27;s previous releases.

&quot;War&quot; was a commercial success, knocking Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; from the top of the UK charts to become U2&#x27;s first number-one album there. In the United States, it reached number 12 and became the band&#x27;s first album certified gold. &quot;War&quot; received generally favourable reviews, although some British journalists criticised it. The band supported the album with the War Tour through the end of 1983. In 2008, a remastered edition of &quot;War&quot; was released. In 2012, the album was ranked 223rd on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

==Recording==
In August 1982, Bono and his wife Alison Hewson honeymooned in Jamaica. It has been noted that it was not a typical honeymoon, as Bono reportedly worked on the lyrics for the upcoming album. The lyrics to &quot;New Year&#x27;s Day&quot; had its origins in a love song Bono wrote for his wife, but the song was reshaped and inspired by the Polish Solidarity movement. The band began recording the album in September 1982 at Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin with producer Steve Lillywhite, their third consecutive record at the studio with the producer.

The album&#x27;s opener, &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;, an ardent protest song, stems from a guitar riff and lyric written by the Edge in 1982. Following an argument with his girlfriend, and a period of doubt in his own song-writing abilities, the Edge – &quot;feeling depressed... channeled [his] fear and frustration and self-loathing into a piece of music.&quot; Early versions of the song opened with the line, &quot;Don&#x27;t talk to me about the rights of the IRA, UDA&quot;. After Bono had reworked the lyrics, the band recorded the song. The opening drum pattern soon developed into the song&#x27;s hook. A local violinist, Steve Wickham, approached the Edge one morning at a bus stop and asked if U2 had any need for a violin on their next album. In the studio for only half a day, Wickham&#x27;s electric violin became the final instrumental contribution to the song.

During the sessions for &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;, Lillywhite encouraged drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. to use a click track, but Mullen was firmly against the idea. A chance meeting with Andy Newmark (of Sly &amp; the Family Stone) – a drummer who used a click track religiously – changed Mullen&#x27;s mind. Mullen used the click track to stay in time for other songs on the album. Mullen said of the album in a 1983 interview, &quot;I think the drumming has always been pretty simple, I don&#x27;t think it needs to be flashy. For &quot;War&quot; I use a click track, something I haven&#x27;t used before, it&#x27;s a way of keeping time in my headphones. When I listened to the music in time with the click track I knew I had to bring it down to the real basics. Hopefully for the next LP it will be more complicated, I&#x27;ll move on. I think of it as a musical progression for myself because I learned a lot recording this album, just about my own style and that&#x27;s what I wanted to do. I think there is a definite style on &quot;War&quot; where there isn&#x27;t on the previous albums.&quot;

Three of the tracks featured backing vocals by the Coconuts, of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. In the words of Steve Lillywhite, &quot;they just happened to be in Dublin on tour, so we hung out with them and they came in and sang on &#x27;Surrender&#x27;. So it was sort of random – this serious Irish rock band having the Coconuts on their album.&quot;

The studio version of &quot;40&quot; was recorded during the final hours of the recording sessions in November 1982. Bassist Adam Clayton had already left the studio, and the three remaining band members decided they did not have a good song to end the album. Bono, the Edge, and Mullen Jr. quickly recorded the song with the Edge playing both the guitar and bass parts. Bono called the song &quot;40&quot; as he based the lyrics on Psalm 40. In live versions of the song, the Edge and Clayton switch roles, as Clayton plays guitar and Edge plays the bass.

==Composition==
The sound of &quot;War&quot; is arguably harsher than that of the band&#x27;s other albums. A major reason for this is that the Edge uses far less delay and echo than in previous and subsequent works.

&quot;War&quot; opens with the protest song &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;. The song describes the horror felt by an observer of The Troubles in Northern Ireland, specifically Bloody Sunday. Already a departure from the themes of innocence and spirituality displayed on the group&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; introduces the album with a startling, military-esque drum beat by Larry Mullen, Jr., a fuming solo by the Edge that segues into staccato bursts reminiscent of machine gun fire, and pointed lyrical couplets such as: &quot;And today the millions cry / We eat and drink while tomorrow they die.&quot; The album as a whole is more direct than the ambient &quot;October&quot;. Bono said in 1983, 

&quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; is considered to be among the greatest political protest songs, and has remained a staple of U2&#x27;s live concerts in the years since.

&quot;Seconds&quot; is a song about nuclear proliferation, and the possibility that Armageddon could occur by an accident. The track contains a sample from the 1982 documentary &quot;Soldier Girls&quot;. The Edge sings the first two stanzas, making it one of the rare occasions on which he sings lead vocals.

In continuing the political motif of the album, &quot;New Year&#x27;s Day&quot; is about the Polish solidarity movement. In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed it as the 435th greatest song of all time. The song remains a staple of the band&#x27;s live set, and is their third-most frequently performed song behind &quot;I Will Follow&quot; and &quot;Pride (In the Name of Love)&quot;.

&quot;Like a Song...&quot; was intended as a message to those who believed that the band was too worthy, sincere and not &quot;punk&quot; enough. Bono speculated that the song&#x27;s punk attitude would have made more sense in the 1950s and 1960s, as opposed to the &quot;dressing up&quot; of the genre in the early 1980s. &quot;Like a Song...&quot; was only played live once.

&quot;Drowning Man&quot; is the fifth track on the album. It was never performed live, although there are also unconfirmed reports that it was performed at a concert in 1983.

Other songs concern topics such as prostitution (&quot;Red Light&quot;) and love (&quot;Two Hearts Beat as One&quot;).

==Release==
The album was first released on 28 February 1983. The original cassette release contains the entire album on each side.

===Packaging and title===
The album was titled &quot;War&quot; for several reasons; in 1982, Bono said, &quot;War seemed to be the motif for 1982,&quot; adding that &quot;Everywhere you looked, from the Falklands to the Middle East and South Africa, there was war. By calling the album &quot;War&quot; we&#x27;re giving people a slap in the face and at the same time getting away from the cosy image a lot of people have of U2.&quot; The Edge said that &quot;It&#x27;s a heavy title. It&#x27;s blunt. It&#x27;s not something that&#x27;s safe, so it could backfire. It&#x27;s the sort of subject matter that people can really take a dislike to. But we wanted to take a more dangerous course, fly a bit closer to the wind, so I think the title is appropriate.&quot; The boy on the cover is Peter Rowen (brother of Bono&#x27;s friend, Guggi). He also appears on the covers of &quot;Boy&quot;, &quot;Three&quot;, &quot;The Best of 1980–1990&quot;, &quot;Early Demos&quot; and many singles. Bono described the reasoning behind the cover: &quot;Instead of putting tanks and guns on the cover, we&#x27;ve put a child&#x27;s face. War can also be a mental thing, an emotional thing between loves. It doesn&#x27;t have to be a physical thing.&quot;

===Singles===
In January 1983, &quot;New Year&#x27;s Day&quot; was released internationally as the album&#x27;s lead single. The single reached the top ten in the UK, and was the first release by the band to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In March 1983, &quot;Two Hearts Beat as One&quot; and &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; were released as singles in different regions. &quot;Two Hearts Beat as One&quot;, a single in the US, UK, and Australia, reached number 18 on the UK Singles Chart; &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;, released in Germany and the Netherlands, reached number 3 on the Netherlands&#x27; charts. &quot;40&quot; was not released as a commercial single, but rather as a promotional single in Germany.

==Reception==

In a favourable review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, J. D. Considine said, &quot;the album&#x27;s musical strengths are largely the product of well-honed arrangements and carefully balanced dynamics&quot;. He added, &quot;the songs here stand up against anything on the Clash&#x27;s &quot;London Calling&quot; in terms of sheer impact, and the fact that U2 can sweep the listener up in the same sort of enthusiastic romanticism that fuels the band&#x27;s grand gestures is an impressive feat. For once, not having all the answers seems a bonus.&quot; Critic Dave Marsh said that despite not &quot;match[ing] the pure chilling intensity&quot; of &quot;Boy&quot; and Lillywhite&#x27;s production not giving the guitars enough prominence, &quot;War&quot; was a &quot;solid set&quot;. He complimented &quot;War&quot; for its &quot;passion and commitment&quot; and potent songs, calling it &quot;as good as any post-new wave rock around&quot;. He concluded, &quot;It&#x27;s rare to see a band sustain such courageous behavior through three albums and still wind up on the brink of stardom.&quot;

Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; wrote that &quot;the deadly European virus that&#x27;s always tainted this band turns out to be their characteristic melodic device&quot;, adding, &quot;The Edge becomes a tuneful guitarist by the simple expedient of not soloing, and if Bono has too many Gregorian moments his conviction still carries the music.&quot; Dan Kennedy of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; said that on &quot;War&quot; the group &quot;more clearly define its philosophical stance&quot; and that below the sense of despair on the surface is a &quot;voice of hope that flies in the face of most rock postures&quot;. Brett Milano of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; called &quot;War&quot; an &quot;album of tension and conflict&quot;, with a &quot;riveting opening&quot; in &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; and &quot;one of the year&#x27;s most affecting love songs&quot; in &quot;Two Hearts Beat as One&quot;. He said the &quot;arrangements are models of invention&quot; and that the Edge&#x27;s &quot;expressive guitar is still the heart of U2&#x27;s sound&quot;. Milano found the only weakness to be the &quot;anti-climactic acoustic songs&quot; that close each side. In a review published in the &quot;Albuquerque Journal&quot;, Rick Shefchik said, &quot;The arrangements on this precocious young band&#x27;s third album are brighter than before&quot;, giving their politically motivated songs a &quot;pop sound they once seemed to be avoiding&quot;.

Bill Ashton of the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; called &quot;War&quot; one the year&#x27;s best records and said it was the band&#x27;s &quot;most consistent album yet, full of plaintive lyrics and fiery guitar work&quot; and a rhythm section that &quot;sharpened noticeably&quot; since &quot;October&quot;. He complimented the lyrics for never being heavy-handed despite touching on &quot;revolution, life in the age of The Bomb, love and faith&quot;. Philip Smith of &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; commended the band&#x27;s maturing sound and labeled the album &quot;a classic&quot;. He concluded his review, &quot;So U2 have set out to make a big statement on a subject close to the Irishmen&#x27;s hearts – and they have succeeded.&quot; Terry Atkinson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was disappointed by the &quot;gradual dissolution of [U2&#x27;s] sound&quot; and found that only the two songs that &quot;hold to the group&#x27;s established style&quot; (&quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; and &quot;New Year&#x27;s Day&quot;) were &quot;thoroughly satisfying&quot;. The review concluded, &quot;In trying to escape formula, U-2 too often loses the battle, but this willingness to try the new, added to its still-bracing basic thrust, indicates how distinctive the band is even in failure.&quot;

Several reviews were negative in the United Kingdom. Gavin Martin of &quot;NME&quot; compared the album to U2&#x27;s debut, stating that &quot;where &quot;Boy&quot; shone and flowed &quot;War&quot; is dull and static&quot;, and &quot;where &quot;Boy&quot; propelled lucid pellets of fire and imagination &quot;War&quot; cranks out blank liberal awareness&quot;; he felt that after the single &quot;New Year&#x27;s Day&quot;, which he considered to be &quot;their finest single since &#x27;I Will Follow&#x27;&quot;, &quot;War&quot; &quot;declines quite dramatically&quot;, ultimately calling the album &quot;another example of rock music&#x27;s impotence and decay&quot;. Dave McCullough of &quot;Sounds&quot; shared a similar point of view, recognising that the two singles were &quot;by far the strongest tracks&quot; on &quot;War&quot;, but that &quot;for the remainder, they are a (dejected sounding) mixture of the incomplete, the experimental (in the simplest sense) and the plain sub-standard.&quot; By contrast, Liam Mackey of &quot;Hot Press&quot; in the band&#x27;s native Ireland said that &quot;War&quot; &quot;totally eclipses&quot; the group&#x27;s first two albums and called it a &quot;major leap forward, conceptually and technically&quot;. He praised the &quot;resourcefulness and imagination&quot; of the Edge&#x27;s guitar playing and said the album &quot;offers watertight evidence of the band&#x27;s standing as a genuinely original force in contemporary music&quot;.

The album placed sixth on &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s 1983 year-end Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;War&quot; was a commercial success. In its opening week, it debuted at number one in the UK, supplanting Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; to become the group&#x27;s first number-one album in the UK. In April, it was certified gold in the UK by the British Phonographic Industry. The album charted on the UK Albums Chart for 148 weeks. In the United States, the album entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart at number 91, and eventually peaked at number 12. In total, the album sold 11 million copies.

==War Tour==

In support of the album, the band began touring on 1 December 1982. The first month of shows, referred to as the &quot;Pre-War Tour&quot;, preceded the album&#x27;s release and the bulk of the tour, and was meant to showcase and test the new songs in a live setting. The War Tour proper began on 26 February 1983 and lasted until 30 November of that year. In total, the band played 110 gigs in Europe, the US, and Japan to promote &quot;War&quot;. Over the course of the tour, the band began to play progressively larger venues, moving from clubs to halls to arenas. Bono attempted to engage the growing audiences with theatrical, often dangerous antics, climbing scaffoldings and lighting rigs and jumping into the audience. The sight of Bono waving a white flag during performances of &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; became the tour&#x27;s iconic image. The band played several dates at large European and American music festivals, including a performance at the US Festival on Memorial Day weekend for an audience of 125,000 people. The group&#x27;s 5 June 1983 concert at Red Rocks Amphitheatre on a rain-soaked evening was singled out by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as one &quot;50 Moments that Changed the History of Rock and Roll&quot;. The show was recorded for the concert video &quot;Live at Red Rocks&quot; and was one of several concerts from the tour captured on their live album &quot;Under a Blood Red Sky&quot;. Both releases received extensive play on the radio and MTV, expanding the band&#x27;s audience and showcasing their prowess as a live act. During the tour, the group established a new tradition by closing concerts with &quot;40&quot;, during which the Edge and Clayton would switch instruments and the band members would leave the stage one-by-one as the crowd continued to sing the refrain &quot;How long to sing this song?&quot;. The War Tour was U2&#x27;s first profitable tour, grossing about $2 million.

==Legacy==
In 1989, &quot;War&quot; was ranked number 40 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Albums of the &#x27;80s&quot;. In 2003, the magazine ranked &quot;War&quot; 221st on its list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, describing it as &quot;the band&#x27;s most overtly political album... charged with explosive, passionate guitar rock&quot;. An updated version of the list in 2012 re-ranked the album at number 223. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; ranked &quot;War&quot; 94th on its list of the &quot;Best Albums of the 1980s.&quot;

&quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; critic Greg Kot deemed &quot;War&quot; a &quot;breakthrough&quot; for U2 in which &quot;the band&#x27;s passion comes through with gripping clarity.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic viewed it as U2&#x27;s first album to achieve &quot;greatness&quot;, finding that their lyrics – which he said &quot;came across as grandstanding&quot; in U2&#x27;s earlier work – cohered into a &quot;remarkably clear&quot; vision on &quot;War&quot; and, complemented by the band&#x27;s &quot;muscular, forceful performances&quot;, succeed at &quot;making the universal sound personal&quot;. J. D. Considine and Nathan Brackett&#x27;s overview of U2&#x27;s discography in the 2004 edition of &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; states that with &quot;War&quot;, the band brought more focus to their songwriting and effectively balanced personal and political subject matter, while also creating a musically &quot;richer and more varied&quot; album than &quot;October&quot;.

Reviewing &quot;War&quot; upon its 2008 reissue, &quot;Blender&quot;″s Jon Dolan opined that it marked a tonal shift from U2&#x27;s more &quot;inwardly focused&quot; previous albums and demonstrated the band&#x27;s newfound &quot;titanic moral and sonic force&quot;, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s David Fricke commented that on &quot;War&quot;, &quot;U2 sound like stars, not aspirants, ready for their money shot&quot;. Steven Hyden, writing for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, said that the album showed Bono&#x27;s mastery of &quot;the art of the grand symbolic gesture&quot; through &quot;his inspirational iconography on anthems like &#x27;Sunday Bloody Sunday&#x27; and &#x27;New Year&#x27;s Day&#x27;&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; reviewer Joe Tangari concluded, &quot;The U2 we&#x27;ve known ever since had arrived on &quot;War&quot;, and even today it sounds vital.&quot;

The album was described by Simon Reynolds as the record where the band &quot;turned pacifism itself into a crusade&quot;. According to &quot;Treble&quot; writer Jeff Terich, &quot;War&quot; served as &quot;a triumphant close to [U2&#x27;s] post-punk trilogy&quot; and &quot;the dividing line between U2, the young Dublin new wave act and U2, the heroic stadium rock band&quot;. In a dissenting analysis, Bob Stanley believed the band had actually deviated from post-punk&#x27;s regionalism and rejection of pop music universality by achieving progressively higher levels of international success. He wrote that, beginning with &quot;War&quot;, &quot;it became increasingly hard to tell what U2 stood for, or what their purpose was – their vastness and their complete avoidance of detail made them hard to read, let alone love. One day someone will explain to Bono that pop is always more expressive when it is trying to mend a broken heart than when it&#x27;s trying to save the world.&quot;

==Track listing==

In 1993, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab remastered the album from the original analog master tapes and released it on a 24kt gold plated CD. The original master recording has slightly different running times:
*&quot;Seconds&quot; runs 3:22, adding 11.5 seconds in the break section (beginning at approx. 2:01)
*&quot;New Year&#x27;s Day&quot; runs 5:38, leaving in the one measure before the guitar break (beginning at approx. 3:27)
*&quot;Like a Song...&quot; runs 5:00, extending the playout section (beginning at approx. 4:45)
*&quot;Surrender&quot; runs 5:34, but is erroneously identified on the back of the album as being 6:01 in length

==2008 remastered edition==
Following the remastered re-release of &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; in 2007, it was rumoured that the band would also remaster and re-release &quot;War&quot;, along with the albums &quot;Boy&quot; and &quot;October&quot;. The remastered album was released on 21 July 2008 in the UK, with the US version following it the next day. It was released in three different formats:

#Standard format: A single CD with re-mastered audio and restored packaging. Includes a 16-page booklet featuring previously unseen photos, full lyrics and new liner notes by Niall Stokes. The 10 tracks match the previous release of the album.
#Deluxe format: A standard CD (as above) and a bonus CD. Bonus CD includes B-sides, live tracks and rarities. Also includes a 32-page booklet with previously unseen photos, full lyrics, new liner notes by Niall Stokes, and explanatory notes on the bonus material by the Edge.

<text>Josef Rudolph Thomas Strzygowski (March 7, 1862 – January 2, 1941) was a Polish-Austrian art historian known for his theories promoting influences from the art of the Near East on European art, for example that of Early Christian Armenian architecture on the early Medieval architecture of Europe, outlined in his book, . He is considered a member of the Vienna School of Art History.

== Early life ==
Strzygowski was born in Biala, Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria (today part of Poland). His mother, Edle Trass von Friedelfeldt, was from minor nobility and his father was a cloth manufacturer. Strzygowski initially intended to pursue the same trade, beginning an apprenticeship in a weaving plant in 1880, however, in 1882 he abandoned this career and enrolled at the University of Vienna. He soon transferred to the University of Munich, where he studied art history and completed a dissertation on the iconography of the Baptism of Christ, published in 1885 as .

== Travels ==
For the next three years Strzygowski lived in Rome, where he completed a study of &quot;Cimabue und Rom&quot; (1887) (&quot;Cimabue and Rome&quot;), which emphasized the Byzantine sources of the Italian painter&#x27;s work. Late in life he stated that this work led to the question which would define all of his subsequent scholarship: &quot;What is Rome, what, in reality, is Italian and European art?&quot;

Following his Roman sojourn, Strzygowski travelled to Thessaloniki, Mount Athos, Saint Petersburg, and Moscow, thus developing a greater acquaintance with Byzantine and Russian art. In 1892 he was appointed to the faculty of the University of Graz, but in 1894 and 1895, he lived in Cairo, where he studied the early Byzantine and Islamic art of Egypt, and compiled a catalogue of the Coptic art in the Cairo Museum. Upon his return he entered a period of intense scholarly activity, publishing numerous articles on Byzantine and Islamic art, fields in which he considered himself to be the pioneer.

==Polemics and conflict==
It was in the midst of this activity that Strzygowski published his first polemical work, (1901; &#x27;The Orient or Rome: contributions to the history of late antique and early Christian art&#x27;). Drawing on such diverse materials as Palmyrene art and sculpture, Anatolian sarcophagi, late antique ivories from Egypt, and Coptic textiles, Strzygowski argued, in overtly racial and often racist terms, that style change in late antiquity was the product of an overwhelming &quot;Oriental&quot; or &quot;Semitic&quot; influence. In one modern characterization of both the argument and its rhetorical tone, &quot;Strzygowski [presented] Hellas as a beautiful maiden who sold herself to an &#x27;Old Semite&#x27; to be kept as the jewel of his harem.&quot;

 was explicitly framed as an attack on (1895), by the Viennese art historian Franz Wickhoff, which had posited a Roman origin for the late antique style, a thesis that was pursued further by Alois Riegl in his , which also appeared in 1901. The ensuing controversy continued for decades and, if it resulted in no clear resolution, significantly raised the prominence of late antique art as an academic field of study.

==Later career==

In the early 1900s Strzygowski was invited by Wilhelm von Bode to Germany to assist with the expansion of the Byzantine and other collections in Berlin museums.

In 1909, however, upon Wickhoff&#x27;s death, Strzygowski was appointed as his successor at the University of Vienna, partly as a result of the breadth of his research, and partly as a result of intricate academic politics and (possibly) the advocacy of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. His appointment resulted in an enduring schism among Viennese art historians, pitting Strzygowski against Max Dvořák and Julius von Schlosser, which was exacerbated when Strzygowski established his own research institute within the university (the or ).

In Vienna Strzygowski continued to publish on a variety of topics, focusing particularly on the arts of Byzantium and Islam, but also treating Armenian, Norse, and Slavic subjects, among others. He also gave frequent and well-attended public lectures to audiences &quot;consisting partly, but not solely, of radical pan-German students and sycophants.&quot; Strzygowski&#x27;s own radical pan-Germanism had already become clear in his popular (1907) (&#x27;The visual art of the future&#x27;), in which he praised the painting of Arnold Böcklin and called for a new German artist-hero to reject the heritage of classical antiquity and the Renaissance.

It would not be possible to summarise all of the theses advanced by Strzygowski in the course of his career. Brief mention may be made of his controversy with Ernst Herzfeld over the origins of the Mshatta facade, in which Herzfeld&#x27;s position was eventually proven to be correct; and his two-volume (1918) (&#x27;The architecture of the Armenians and Europe&#x27;), in which he claimed to have traced the origins of Gothic architecture to Armenia.

Strzygowski retired from the University of Vienna in 1933, but in 1934 founded the (&#x27;Society for comparative art history&#x27;) to serve as a platform for his theories. &quot;In the final years, Strzygowski embraced the Nazi sentiments of racism and nationalism, although these appeared to be more the logical conclusion of his earlier theories than any attempt to court the political authorities.&quot; He died in 1941 in Vienna.

== Legacy ==

In general Strzygowski&#x27;s work was characterized by a reliance on formal comparisons at the expense of historical context, and by a pervasive exaltation of the peoples of the &quot;North&quot; and &quot;East&quot;, with an attendant disdain for &quot;Mediterranean&quot; culture.

If Strzygowski&#x27;s erratic methodology have largely discredited his own scholarship, his breadth of geographical interest helped to establish Islamic art, (something which, incidentally, Ernst Gombrich denied in his conversations with Didier Eribon), and Jewish art as legitimate fields of study. Certain of his students (most notably Otto Demus, Fritz Novotny, and Ernst Diez) were successfully able to pursue these interests without subscribing to their teacher&#x27;s ideology.

One of China&#x27;s most successful women&#x27;s doubles specialists, Zhang has won some thirty international titles, the vast majority of them in partnership with Yang Wei, during the first decade of the 21st century. They have shared world dominance almost equally with their compatriot adversaries Gao Ling and Huang Sui. One or the other pair has captured all of the BWF World Championships held since 2000, with Zhang and Yang winning in both 2005 and 2007 by defeating Gao and Huang in the finals. Zhang and Yang also emerged victorious at the 2004 Olympics in Athens by besting their rivals in a closely contested gold medal match. Conversely, Gao and Huang had the upper hand in three finals (2003), 2004, 2006) at the venerable All-England Championships. This tourney has been something of an anomaly for Zhang as she has reached the women&#x27;s doubles final there six times (four with Yang and twice, earlier, with Wei Yili) without winning.

In 2008 Zhang helped China secure its sixth consecutive Uber Cup (women&#x27;s world team championship), and won the Swiss, Thailand, and Malaysia Open women&#x27;s doubles titles with Yang. At the Beijing Olympics where they were top seeded, however, Zhang and Yang were upset in the quarterfinals by Japan&#x27;s Miyuki Maeda and Satoko Suetsuna. The event was eventually won by another, younger Chinese pair, Du Jing and Yu Yang, perhaps marking a changing of the guard in the Chinese dynasty.

Zhang Jiewen decided to quit competitive badminton after the 2008 Summer Olympics, when she married former Malaysian men&#x27;s badminton doubles star Choong Tan Fook, with whom she has two children. She is currently coaching in a badminton facility in Guangzhou. Zhang Jiewen received an award during a ceremony to mark her retirement with five other teammates from the Chinese national badminton team on the sidelines of the China Open badminton event in Shanghai, November 23, 2008.

<text>Hossein Rezazadeh (; born 12 May 1978) is an Iranian politician and retired weightlifter. Rezazadeh is a two-time Olympic champion, four-time World Weightlifting champion, and five-time Asian champion. Rezazadeh has won the Iran Sportsperson of the Year award four times, more than any other athlete in the country&#x27;s history. Rezazadeh is widely considered one of the greatest weightlifters of all time.

==Weightlifting career==
Before the International Weightlifting Federation reorganized the categories in 2018, he held the world record in weightlifting&#x27;s super heavyweight class in the clean and jerk. He is also one of Iran&#x27;s most noted celebrities, frequently appearing on television and in the news; his wedding, which was held in the holy city of Mecca, in February 2003 was broadcast live on state television in Iran.

In 2002 he was voted the &quot;Champion of Champions&quot; of Iran and was one of 16 Iranian athletes granted a badge of courage from Iranian President Mohammad Khatami. As a reward for setting a world record in the clean and jerk at the 2002 World Weightlifting Championships in Warsaw, Poland, Mohammad Khatami awarded him 600 million rials (a little more than US$60,000 at the time) to buy a house in Tehran. After his spectacular performance, he was offered by Turkey&#x27;s Weightlifting Federation a stipend of US$20,000 a month, as well as a luxury villa and US$10 million reward if he switched nationalities and won gold for Turkey at the 2004 Athens Olympics, but he turned down their offer. Rezazadeh rejected the tempting offer saying, &quot;I am an Iranian and love my country and people.&quot;

Rezazadeh surprised many at the 2000 Summer Olympics, earning a gold medal and breaking the decades-old monopoly on the gold by the Soviet Union and then Russia. His gold medal was the first since 1960 by a non-Soviet or non-Russian athlete in the over 105 kg class at a non boycotted Games. He broke his records in the clean and jerk at the 2004 Summer Olympics again leading up to 263.5 kg (580.9 pounds). His total (both lifts combined) at the 2004 Summer Olympics of 472.5 kg was 17.5 kg more than silver medalist Viktors Ščerbatihs. He has been named IWF World Weightlifter of the Year, and was shortlisted for weightlifter of the century.

Rezazadeh was also referred to by weightlifting commentators as &quot;the strongest man in the world&quot;, primarily due to his world records in the olympics.

In 2006 the Rezazadeh Stadium was built in Rezazadeh&#x27;s hometown of Ardabil. It was built to honour the achievements of Rezazadeh and is one of the most modern and innovative indoor arenas in Iran today.

In early 2008 Rezazadeh participated in a television commercial promoting a real estate agency based in Dubai. His participation surprised many of his fans and was seen as demeaning to both himself and his country, given the promotion of buying estates in a land deemed as a rival. This eventually led to the decision of the Iranian Majles to ban any sort of sponsorship from any high-profile Iranian - i.e. athlete, actor, singer - for any sort of product or service, due to the direct encouragement of product consumerism.

In 2008, Rezazadeh was advised by Dr. Mohammad Ali Shahi, his physician and medical athletic trainer, not to participate in the 2008 Olympics due to his severe hand injuries and his high blood pressure. To his fans&#x27; surprise and disappointment he officially announced in a letter read via National Iranian Television that he had accepted the advice. The next day Rezazdeh wrote another public letter announcing his retirement from professional weightlifting. He said &quot;I am pretty sure that my fellow country men will repeat my accomplishments again and I hope my son Abulfazl will break my own records in future&quot;.

Immediately following his retirement Rezazdeh was appointed as the Prime Counselor for Iranian national weight lifting federation.

In September 2008, Rezazadeh was named manager and head coach of Iran&#x27;s national weightlifting team. In January 2009, he was blamed for positive results of the steroid tests of four Iranian weightlifters. Later on, one of the team members, Saeid Alihosseini accused him of using steroids in 2006. Rezazadeh has publicly vowed to fight doping in weightlifting.

== Political career ==
Rezazadeh was elected as a member of City Council of Tehran in 2013 local elections.

==Major result==


===World records===


== Notes and references ==
* Before May 1, 2005, the totals in weightlifting were calculated by adding the result from the snatch and clean &amp; jerk to the nearest 2.5 kg. This is why his 2004 Olympic performance adds up as 472.5 kg. 473.5 is not divisible by 2.5, thus it is rounded down to 472.5.

<text>Yang Wei (; born 13 January 1979) is a Chinese former badminton player who affiliate with Guangdong provincial team.

== Career ==
A woman&#x27;s doubles specialist, Yang has won some forty international titles, most of them in the sport&#x27;s top tier events, since 1998. Prior to 2003 she partnered Huang Nanyan with whom she earned a silver medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympics and gained the winning point against South Korea in the 2002 Uber Cup (women&#x27;s world team championship) final. Her subsequent partnership with Zhang Jiewen has been even more successful as they have shared international domination with compatriot rivals Gao Ling and Huang Sui. Yang and Zhang captured gold at the 2004 Athens Olympics by defeating Gao and Huang in the final. They bested the same team in winning both the 2005 and 2007 BWF World Championships. On the other hand, Gao and Huang have been an obstacle for them at the prestigious All-England Championships, defeating Yang and Zhang in the 2003, 2004, and 2006 finals. Curiously, this is the one major tournament that neither Yang nor Zhang has ever won.

In 2008 Yang helped China to secure its sixth consecutive Uber Cup title and won women&#x27;s doubles at the Swiss, Thailand, and Malaysia Opens with Zhang Jiewen. At the Beijing Olympics where they were first seeded, however, Yang and Zhang were upset in the quarterfinals by Japan&#x27;s Miyuki Maeda and Satoko Suetsuna. The event was eventually won by a younger Chinese pair, Du Jing and Yu Yang, perhaps signaling a changing of the guard in the Chinese dynasty. Yang Wei received an award during a ceremony to mark her retirement with five other teammates from the Chinese national badminton team on the sidelines of the China Open badminton event in Shanghai, 23 November 2008.

<text>USS &quot;Bagley&quot; (FF-1069) was a of the United States Navy. She was the 18th ship of the &quot;Knox&quot; class, built as a destroyer escort (DE) and redesignated as a frigate (FF) in the 1975 USN ship reclassification. &quot;Bagley&quot; was the fourth ship of the USN named for Ensign Worth Bagley, the only US Navy officer killed in action during the Spanish–American War.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Bagley&quot; was laid down on 5 October 1970 at Seattle, Washington, by the Lockheed Shipbuilding and Construction Company. The ship was launched on 17 April 1971, sponsored by Mrs. Marie Louise H. Bagley, widow of Admiral David Worth Bagley and posthumous sister-in-law of Ensign Worth Bagley. The vessel was commissioned on 6 May 1972 at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.

===1972–1979===
The escort ship conducted acceptance trials along the coasts of Washington and British Columbia and then headed south for her new home port at San Diego, California, where she arrived on 25 July 1972. The warship began a restricted availability from 31 July to 9 September. She departed San Diego on 16 September, bound for Pearl Harbor and her shakedown cruise. &quot;Bagley&quot; arrived in Pearl Harbor on 22 September and operated in Hawaiian waters into October. On the 3d of that month, she stood out of Pearl Harbor and headed for San Diego. The warship reached that port on 9 October. Over the next month, she conducted exercises out of San Diego. On 15 November, &quot;Bagley&quot; entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard and began an extended post-shakedown availability during which her main propulsion plant was converted to use Navy distillate fuel.

The warship completed repairs and modifications on 4 May 1973 and returned to San Diego that same day. She began training operations along the California coast three days later and continued those evolutions through most of the summer. She stood out of San Diego on 11 September and headed for the western Pacific. She conducted training operations in the Hawaiian Islands 17 September–26 and then resumed her westward voyage. She arrived in Yokosuka, Japan, on 5 October. A week later, the escort ship shaped a course for the Philippines. &quot;Bagley&quot; arrived in Subic Bay on 17 October for two days of upkeep and liberty. On the 19th, she weighed anchor and headed for a patrol station in the Gulf of Tonkin.

Ten days later, she received orders to accompany the aircraft carrier to the Indian Ocean. That contingency force went to the western portion of the Indian Ocean in response to hostilities that had broken out between Israel and her neighbors, Egypt and Syria (the Yom Kippur War). &quot;Bagley&quot; spent the next seven weeks on patrol in the Indian Ocean as an indication of American resolve to end the fighting in the Middle East and as a deterrent to keep Soviet forces from intervening in the conflict. During that time, she and the guided missile destroyer entered the Red Sea and docked at the port of Masawa, Ethiopia for a few days.

On 17 December 1973, &quot;Bagley&quot; reentered Subic Bay for an extended leave and upkeep period. For the remainder of the deployment, the warship participated in the usual 7th Fleet exercises punctuated by port visits to Hong Kong; Keelung, Taiwan; Buckner Bay, Okinawa; Pusan, Korea; and Yokosuka, Japan. On 20 February 1974, she departed Yokosuka and began the voyage home. The warship stopped at Midway Island and Pearl Harbor before arriving in San Diego on 8 March.

For the rest of 1974 and the first six months of 1975, she operated out of San Diego conducting a series of exercises, inspections, and qualifications. On 30 June 1975, &quot;Bagley&quot; was redesignated a frigate, FF-1069. The warship spent the month of July 1975 preparing for her second deployment to the Far East. She stood out of San Diego on 1 August. Following stops at Pearl Harbor and Guam, the frigate arrived in Subic Bay on 13 September. For the next five months, Bagley conducted normal operations—training evolutions and port visits—with ships of the 7th Fleet. She departed Subic Bay on 12 February 1976 to return to the United States. She stopped at Pearl Harbor from 26 February to 3 March before continuing on to San Diego where she arrived on 1 April. She resumed normal operations out of San Diego, and continued that duty into 1977.

On 17 February 1977, she shaped a course for Hawaiian waters where she joined ships of the American, Australian, Canadian, and New Zealand navies in Exercise RIMPAC 77. The frigate returned to San Diego on 12 March and, two days later, was drydocked in the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for hull repairs. She came out of drydock on 2 April and returned to San Diego on the 6th.

&quot;Bagley&quot; weighed anchor again 12 April 1977 and set course for the Orient. She made the usual stopover at Pearl Harbor and arrived in Subic Bay on 6 May. During this six months in the Far East, the frigate visited most of the usual liberty ports and participated in a number of training exercises with other ships of the 7th Fleet. On 6 November, she departed Yokosuka for an uninterrupted voyage to San Diego. The warship reentered her home port on 21 November and remained there through the end of the year.

The frigate conducted normal operations out of San Diego during the first six weeks of 1978. On 14 February 1978, she entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for an overhaul that occupied the rest of 1978. She completed post-overhaul trials and tests in January 1979 and resumed operations out of San Diego early in February. Exercises, qualifications, and tests in the southern California operating area occupied her throughout 1979 and for most of the first two months of 1980. The warship departed San Diego on 25 February, bound ultimately for the Far East. En route to the western Pacific, however, she participated in the multinational Exercise RIMPAC 80 conducted in the Hawaiian Islands. She resumed her voyage west on 19 March and entered Subic Bay on 8 April.

===1980–1989===
After conducting training operations—notably gunfire support drills and ASROC firings—in the Subic Bay operating area, &quot;Bagley&quot; departed the Philippines late in April in company with a task force built around the aircraft carrier . The task force constituted a part of the increased American military presence in the western Indian Ocean deemed necessary after radical Iranian students occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took the American diplomatic staff hostage. The continuing hostage crisis and hostilities between Iran and Iraq kept a large number of Navy ships on patrol in nearby waters. &quot;Bagley&quot;″s task force remained in the vicinity until 29 July when it headed back to the Pacific. En route to the Philippines, she stopped at Singapore and at Pattaya, Thailand. She reentered Subic Bay on 20 August with 36 Vietnamese refugees whom she had rescued on the passage from Thailand. &quot;Bagley&quot; voyaged to Pusan, Korea, for a goodwill port call in mid-September and returned to Subic Bay on 23 September. On 1 October, the frigate got underway to return to the United States. After the customary pause at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Bagley&quot; arrived back in San Diego on 15 October. Except for a brief period underway on 20 November, the frigate remained in port at San Diego for the remainder of 1980.

She continued the inport period through the first seven weeks of 1981. On 18 February, &quot;Bagley&quot; resumed normal operations in the southern California operating area. Fleet exercises and single ship drills occupied her until 20 October 1981 when she again headed for the Far East. She stopped at Pearl Harbor 31 October – 2 November and then resumed her voyage west. &quot;Bagley&quot; arrived in Subic Bay on 22 November. She operated out of Subic Bay until early when she headed for the Indian Ocean. En route to Indian Ocean contingency operations, the warship encountered Vietnamese refugees adrift in a boat in the South China Sea. She took the boat&#x27;s 37 occupants on board, sank the boat as a potential hazard to navigation, and proceeded to Singapore where she disembarked the refugees. The frigate resumed her voyage to the Indian Ocean on 12 December and arrived at Al Masirah, Oman, on the last day of 1981.

The year 1982, opened with &quot;Bagley&quot; operating in the western Indian Ocean and in the Arabian Sea. That deployment lasted until late January when she made a port visit to Mombasa, Kenya, before heading back to the Far East. On that journey, she took a very circuitous route, visiting the Australian port of Geraldton, Diego Garcia Island, and Penang in Malaysia, before returning to Subic Bay in mid-April. Late in April and early in May, &quot;Bagley&quot; took part in readiness exercises carried out near Guam in company with &quot;Constellation&quot;, and . At the conclusion of those evolutions on 8 May, the frigate set a course, via Hawaii, to the west coast and reentered San Diego on 23 May. After the customary month of post-deployment leave and upkeep, &quot;Bagley&quot; resumed normal training duty in California waters and remained so occupied for the rest of the year.

Local operations out of San Diego kept the frigate busy well into 1983. She did not set out for another overseas assignment until 9 June when she put to sea, once again bound for the western Pacific. Along the way, &quot;Bagley&quot; and her travelling companions , , , and spent a week in the Hawaiian Islands in mid-June before resuming the voyage west on the 17th. The warships &quot;INCHOPped&quot; (changed operational control) to the Commander, 7th Fleet, on 27 June and reached the Philippines at Manila on Independence Day 1983. Over the next five months, the frigate took part in a number of exercises at sea, most often with a task group built around &quot;Midway&quot;, and visited a series of Far Eastern ports. Late in July, she visited Singapore and Thailand before heading for a set of exercises in Korean waters carried out at the end of July and during the first part of August. After a call at Guam in late August and early September, &quot;Bagley&quot; steamed to Sasebo, Japan, whence she operated until the first week in November when she returned to the Philippines at Subic Bay. The warship made one more stop at a Japanese port, Yokosuka, and then headed back to the United States on 1 December. She called briefly at Pearl Harbor before arriving back in San Diego on 13 December 1983.

Post-deployment leave and upkeep kept &quot;Bagley&quot; immobile at San Diego for the rest of the year and during the first half of January 1984. In fact, despite a short two-day period underway between 17 and 19 January, she did not resume normal west coast operations until the second week in February when she put to sea for READIEX 84-2 and a cruise to the Pacific coast of Central America. &quot;Bagley&quot; returned to San Diego from those missions on 9 March and remained there until 22 March. At that time, the warship headed north to Esquimalt, British Columbia, where she took part in CNO Project 371, tests on new submarine torpedo designs. She completed her part in the tests on 30 March and, after visits to Vancouver, British Columbia, and to San Francisco, returned to San Diego on 11 April. Just over a month after her return, &quot;Bagley&quot; began an eight-month regular overhaul at the naval station.

&quot;Bagley&quot; completed the overhaul on 19 January 1985 and embarked upon more than four months of post-overhaul checks, qualifications, and certifications. These she carried out in a long series of short underway periods in nearby waters. Late in May, the frigate participated in Exercise EASTPAC 85-5 conducted in late May and early June. At the conclusion of the evolution, &quot;Bagley&quot; called at Portland, Oregon, for that city&#x27;s Rose Festival and then moved on to Concord, California, to load ammunition. &quot;Bagley&quot; then visited San Francisco before returning to San Diego on 22 June. Except for another visit to CFB Esquimalt in September, followed by &quot;Bagley&quot;″s arrival in San Francisco, on 12 October 1985, for the start of Navy Fleet Week &#x27;85 activities. &quot;Bagley&quot; operated locally out of San Diego for the remaining months of the year.

Her west coast employment came to an end early in 1986. On 15 January, the warship set out on her first overseas deployment in two years as part of a task group built around the aircraft carrier . After reaching Pearl Harbor on 21 January, she spent the rest of January in Hawaii taking part in a series of exercises and then resumed her voyage to the Far East on 2 February. &quot;Bagley&quot; arrived in Subic Bay on 17 February and made a port of call in Olongapo City. &quot;Bagley&quot; operated locally in the waters off of the coast of the Republic of the Philippines for the rest of the month. Early in March, the frigate&#x27;s task group visited Singapore on the way to duty in the eastern Indian Ocean, the Arabian Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea. While operating in the &quot;I.O.&quot; &quot;Bagley&quot; briefly anchored off of the coast of Mombasa, Kenya, however the crew was denied liberty there, due to concerns over the AIDS epidemic there. After months in the Indian Ocean, &quot;Bagley&quot; participated in joint exercises with units of the Pakistani Navy. Then, she stopped off at Karachi, Pakistan, between 15 and 17 March before dropping anchor at Masirah Island, Oman, on the 18th. On 9 April, &quot;Bagley&quot; set out for Diego Garcia Island at which place she called briefly on the 12th before shaping a course for the Suez Canal.

The &quot;Enterprise&quot; battle group, &quot;Battle Group Foxtrot,&quot; transited the canal on 28 and 29 April 1986 and arrived in the Mediterranean to reinforce American forces there which were already engaged in &quot;Operation El Dorado Canyon,&quot; a series of retaliatory actions against the provocations and terrorist activities of Libya&#x27;s Colonel Muammar al-Gaddafi. &quot;Bagley&quot; and her battle group spent the next two months cruising the Mediterranean in support of American foreign policy, and patrolling along the &quot;Line of death&quot;, While operating in the Mediterranean Sea, &quot;Bagley&quot; made ports of call in Monte Carlo, the Principality of Monaco, Gaeta, Italy and Catania, on the island of Sicily. On 28 June, she left Catania, Italy, steamed through the Suez Canal, crossed the Indian Ocean, and arrived in Subic Bay on 17 July. She returned to sea with the task group on the 22nd bound for home. After the customary port of call at Oahu, where &quot;Bagley&quot; picked up family members of the crew, for the &quot;Tiger Cruise&quot; portion of the deployment, back to home port, the warship reentered San Diego on 11 August. &quot;Bagley&quot; earned the Meritorious Unit Commendation Ribbon and the Navy Expeditionary Medal for its outstanding service during operations while on deployment, as well as another Sea Service Ribbon. &quot;Bagley&quot; returned from its extended deployment, having conducted operations in three of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s four active fleets, and began an extended post-deployment standdown period soon after! In fact, the left port only briefly on four occasions in October; the rest of the year she spent in San Diego.

Another series of four brief underway periods in January 1987 punctuated a month otherwise spent largely in upkeep. In February, she traveled to Concord where she unloaded ammunition before beginning a restricted availability at San Diego on the 16th. The repair period lasted until early summer and included a seven-week drydocking in that occupied most of April and all of May. Late in June 1987, &quot;Bagley&quot; resumed normal operations out of San Diego; and, except for operations in the Bering Sea that took up most of November, she remained active in the immediate vicinity of San Diego for the rest of the year.

As 1987 waned and 1988 began, however, &quot;Bagley&quot; anticipated imminent departure for overseas duty. She stood out of San Diego on 4 January 1988 in company once more with the &quot;Enterprise&quot; task group. The warships made an unusual nonstop, but leisurely, Pacific crossing during which they carried out a five-day readiness exercise in the Hawaiian operating area. The frigate and her colleagues reached Subic Bay in the Philippines on 1 February and remained in that port until the 6th. On that day she and the other warships in the group got underway for a tour of duty in the Arabian Sea, returning once more to a region of chronic political convulsions spawned by a decade of Iranian provocations. En route to the Arabian Sea, &quot;Bagley&quot; participated in a series of exercises with units of the Indonesian Navy. She and her units reached their destination at mid-month and relieved the &quot;Midway&quot; task group as contingency force on station. For about two months, &quot;Bagley&quot; patrolled the waters of the northern Arabian Sea with her task group with the only untoward event being the loss of her helicopter which ditched because of a material casualty.

During Operation Earnest Will, struck an Iranian mine and suffered severe damage on 14 April 1988. &quot;Bagley&quot; was one of the warships selected to retaliate on the Iranians in Operation Praying Mantis. Accordingly, she joined and on 18 April, and the three warships steered for the Sirri Island oil platform which they then put out of operation with gunfire. Soon after destroying the oil platform, the trio engaged the Iranian &quot;Kaman&quot;-class patrol boat with surface-to-surface missiles and finished her off with gunfire. When a Marine Corps AH-1 Cobra helicopter operating from &quot;Wainwright&quot; failed to return after the actions of the 18th, &quot;Bagley&quot; spent the next two days engaged in a futile search for the missing aircraft and its crew. It became apparent that the helicopter went down during the operation when the bodies of the crew, Marine Corps Captains Stephen C. Leslie and Kenneth W. Hill were recovered almost a month later about southeast of Abu Musa Island.

Late in April 1988, &quot;Bagley&quot; and escorted and through the Strait of Hormuz into the Arabian Sea. The warship then resumed operations in the northern reaches of that sea. That employment lasted until 15 May when &quot;Bagley&quot; parted company with the task unit and joined in setting a generally easterly course. After exercises with units of the Indonesian and Malaysian navies and a series of port calls in the Philippines and along the coast of the Asian continent, the warship set out from Pusan, Korea, on 17 June to return to the United States. She stopped off at Seattle to embark a group of male relatives and friends of her crewmen for the last leg of the voyage home and completed this &quot;Tiger&quot; portion of the journey at San Diego on 2 July.

After more than a month of post-deployment standdown at San Diego, &quot;Bagley&quot; resumed normal duty training in waters along the west coast. Exercises, drills, and inspections—the normal fare of west coast operations—occupied the warship for the remainder of 1988 and the first two months of 1989. She entered drydock in &quot;Steadfast&quot; at San Diego at the end of February 1989 and remained docked for the entire month of March. Exiting the drydock on 4 April, she continued repairs and the installation of new equipment until mid-May. At that time she resumed her schedule of west-coast training missions and continued so engaged through the summer.

On 18 September 1989, &quot;Bagley&quot; embarked once again on the long voyage to the Far East and another several months of service there and in the Arabian Sea. This particular passage to the Orient, however, played out differently than most because the frigate and her task group remained at sea for more than a month before entering port in the Far East. &quot;Bagley&quot;″s unit rendezvoused with two other units—one built around the aircraft carrier and the other around &quot;Constellation&quot;—and sailed north to conduct the exercise Operation PACEX 89 in the vicinity of the Aleutian Islands during the period between 20 September and 30. In October, the warship took part in Operation ANNUALEX 89 with the &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; group augmented by the battleships and USS &quot;New Jersey&quot;. That exercise ranged westward across the northern Pacific and then north into the Sea of Japan. At one point in the massive operation, elements of the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force joined American warships and planes in carrying out bilateral training in the waters surrounding Okinawa. The crossing, prolonged by the exercise, ended with Operation Valiant Blitz carried out with units of the South Korean Navy in the Sea of Japan.

On 31 October 1989, &quot;Bagley&quot; and her colleagues made their first port of call since leaving North America in mid-September when they arrived in Hong Kong. After nearly a week of liberty, the warship returned to sea with the task group on 6 November for the voyage to the Philippines and arrived in Subic Bay on the 11th. She spent the next four weeks either in port at Subic Bay or operating in nearby waters. On 10 December, she set out for a tour of duty with the contingency forces operating in the Arabian Sea. Along the way, she made a liberty call at Pattaya Beach, Thailand, another at Singapore, and a resupply stop a Diego Garcia Island before arriving on station in the Arabian Sea in mid-January 1990. Her stay in the troubled region proved a brief one, however, for she called only once at a local port, Muscat in Oman between the 20th and the 22d, and cleared the region entirely early in February 1990. After visits to Penang, Malaysia, and Subic Bay, &quot;Bagley&quot; set out on the voyage home on 23 February. She stopped along the way at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii and reentered San Diego on 16 March 1990.

===Decommissioning===
Following the customary post-deployment standdown, the frigate put to sea on 27 April to take up normal west coast training missions once again. For almost 10 months, she carried out the usual schedule of drills, exercises, and inspections punctuated with visits to variety of ports in the United States and Canada. She continued so occupied through 1990 and into the early months of 1991. In February 1991, however, &quot;Bagley&quot; embarked upon a brief, but novel, phase of her career when she left San Diego on the 15th bound for the coast of Central America for two months of drug interdiction duty. During that period, she cruised the Pacific coasts of Guatemala, El Salvador, Panama and Costa Rica stopping and inspecting fishing boats and other small craft and carrying out air tracking operations. The warship concluded the assignment on 3 April and headed back to San Diego where she arrived on the 9th. Over the last five months of her active service, the warship spent a lot of time in port at San Diego. She did put to sea occasionally both to prepare for her final material inspection or to visit ports farther up the coast. She returned to San Diego from her last underway period on 8 July 1991 and secured fires for the last time. After almost 12 weeks of final preparations, &quot;Bagley&quot; was decommissioned at San Diego on 26 September 1991. Her name was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 11 January 1995 and later sold for scrapping. &quot;Bagley&quot; was cut up and recycled by the end of September 2000.

<doc id="930742" wikidata="Q5525183" url="?curid=930742" title="Gary Gulman">
<text>Gary Lewis Weston Gulman (born July 17, 1970) is an American stand-up comedian. He was a finalist on the NBC reality-talent show &quot;Last Comic Standing&quot; in its second and third seasons. He released his first CD, &quot;Conversations With Inanimate Objects&quot; in 2005, and his first television special &quot;Gary Gulman: Boyish Man&quot; the following year. Since then, he has released two other comedy albums and three other comedy specials, including 2019&#x27;s &quot;The Great Depresh&quot; on HBO.

== Early life ==
Gulman was born on July 17, 1970, in Peabody, Massachusetts, to Barbara and Philip Gulman. He is the youngest of three brothers, and was raised in a Jewish family. Gulman&#x27;s parents divorced before he was two years old and his family struggled financially.

Gulman has described himself as a sensitive kid who enjoyed making his friends laugh, drawing and painting, and playing basketball. He attended Peabody Veterans Memorial High School. After his junior year of high school, he was recruited to play football.

Gulman attended Boston College on a football scholarship. He played tight end during his freshman year but later left the team. Gulman credits the time he spent playing football in college as one of the main reasons he recognized and began to seek help for his lifelong struggle with depression and for his later pursuit of a career in comedy. Gulman graduated in 1993 with a degree in accounting, planning to become a CPA like one of his brothers.

After graduating, he worked for two years as an accountant at the Big Six accounting firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand (now PricewaterhouseCoopers), while going to comedy club open mics at night. He then began working as a substitute teacher, where he was well known for trying out his stand-up routines on high-school students before bringing them to the stage at night.

== Career ==
Gulman&#x27;s comedy centers on absurd observations about daily occurrences. He is one of only a handful of comedians to appear on every major late-night television comedy program, having performed on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, &quot;Conan&quot;, &quot;Late Night with Seth Meyers&quot;, &quot;Just for Laughs&quot;, and &quot;John Oliver&#x27;s New York Stand-Up Show&quot;.

On November 25, 2006, Gary Gulman starred in his own one-hour Comedy Central special entitled &quot;Gary Gulman: Boyish Man&quot;. His second Comedy Central special aired on December 8, 2012, called &quot;In This Economy?&quot;, followed by &quot;It’s About Time&quot; in 2016 on Netflix and &quot;The Great Depresh&quot; in 2019 on HBO. His fifth special, &quot;Born on Third Base&quot;, premiered on Max in December 2023 to critical acclaim.

=== 1993–2003: Early career ===
Gulman began performing at open mics in 1993 in the Boston area. In early 1999, Gulman began to pursue stand-up full time; he moved from his family home in Peabody to Los Angeles where he had received development deals. He worked on developing five different shows during this time but none of them were picked up by a television network.

Gulman performed his first late night stand-up set in 1999 on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. The following year, he performed on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;.

=== 2003–2012: Touring, &quot;Last Comic Standing,&quot; and more TV appearances ===
Gulman first came to national attention in 2003 when he was a contestant on the second season of the NBC reality-talent show &quot;Last Comic Standing&quot;. In season 2, he finished in third place behind John Heffron and Alonzo Bodden. Gulman was also on the third season of the show in 2004. Following &quot;Last Comic Standing&quot;, Gulman released his first comedy album &quot;Conversations with Inanimate Objects&quot;. He then appeared in Dane Cook&#x27;s documentary series &quot;Tourgasm&quot; which premiered on HBO in 2006; Gulman appeared with fellow comedians Dane Cook, Jay Davis, and Robert Kelly.

Wanting to have more opportunities to perform stand-up, Gulman moved to New York City in 2006. In 2008, Gulman was the host of NESN&#x27;s &quot;Comedy All-Stars&quot;. During this period, Gulman performed stand-up on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; (2005), &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; (2006), &quot;Last Call with Carson Daly&quot; (2006), &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot; (2007), and &quot;Conan&quot; (2011), among other shows.

=== 2012–2019: Rise to national prominence ===
In 2012, Gulman released a new Comedy Central special &quot;In this Economy?&quot; The show was taped in the Wilbur Theatre in Boston, Massachusetts. Following its premiere, he performed on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; for the second time. In May 2014, Gulman had a guest appearance on &quot;Inside Amy Schumer&quot;. In April of that year, he performed for the first time on &quot;Late Night with Seth Meyers&quot; and in June 2014 he was the guest on &quot;The Pete Holmes Show.&quot;

In March 2015, Gulman taped his new special &quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot;. It was released the following year, in May 2016, by Netflix. During the interim time, Gulman was hospitalized for clinical depression; this was not publicly made known at the time.

In January 2017, he performed on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;. In May 2017, he was again hospitalized due to depression. In 2018, he appeared as a fictionalized version of himself on HBO&#x27;s &quot;Crashing&quot; and appeared in episode four of HBO&#x27;s four-part special of the &quot;2 Dope Queens&quot; podcast with Jessica Williams and Phoebe Robinson.

During this period, Gulman was on &quot;Conan&quot; three times (2014, 2015, 2016). The last of those sets, about a fictional documentary on the making of US states&#x27; two-letter abbreviations, went viral.

=== 2019–present: &quot;The Great Depresh&quot; ===
Since January 1, 2019, Gulman has been posting daily tips for aspiring comedians on his Twitter feed. In fall 2019, he was interviewed on both &quot;Conan&quot; and &quot;Late Night with Seth Meyers&quot;.

Gulman recorded a HBO special in June 2019, entitled &quot;The Great Depresh&quot;. Judd Apatow served as executive producer. The special premiered on October 5, 2019, and sees Gulman opening up about his depression, anxiety and hospitalization. He has described the show as &quot;a hybrid, where I do some documentary about my recovery, treatment, and my hospitalization, and then I do stand-up surrounding that.&quot; It includes conversations with his wife Sadé, his psychiatrist Dr. Richard Friedman, and his mother Barbara, who asked &quot;if Judd Apatow could make her look thinner&quot;. Gulman has stated he had &quot;retired from life&quot; because of his crippling depression for more than two years before recovering through treatment and medication. However, he felt very anxious and sad when he got back on stage, and his way of dealing with that was to joke about it, leading to the idea for the special. Gulman credits his psychiatrist with guiding him through medication, treatment and hospitalization, which he was particularly terrified of because all he knew about it previously were the negative depictions of hospitalization like &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; and &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot;. He has stated that his hospitalization actually &quot;turned out very ordinary, and so helpful&quot; and he hopes that sharing his experience will help to destigmatize medication and therapy.

In 2019, Gulman had a small role as a comedian in the film &quot;Joker&quot;.

His first book, &quot;Misfit: Growing Up Awkward in the &#x27;80s&quot; (Flatiron Books), was released on September 19, 2023.

== Personal life ==
Gary has been open about his struggle with depression and anxiety and incorporates it into his comedy.

Gulman is married to Sadé Tametria, with whom he was first seen in 2014. The two live in Harlem in New York.

<text>The slang or colloquial term tinnie or tinny has a variety of meanings, generally derived from some association with the metal tin, or aluminium foil which has a loose allusion to tin.

&quot;Tinnie&quot; is the common term for a commemorative medal made from a non-precious metal such as zinc or tin (or even plastic) and with provisions for being attached to a garment and displayed while worn. Such medals were commonly sold or given away at public events to build group cohesiveness or to lend prestige to the wearer. The &quot;golden age of the tinnie&quot; was World War II, and the Nazi Party and the USSR were among the most prolific disbursers of them. They are avidly collected today by hobbyists and, although usually inexpensive to obtain, are often collected in conjunction with coins, exonumia, military awards and decorations and other related small stamped or cast metal objects.

In New Zealand, a &quot;tinny&quot; or &quot;tinnie&quot; can be a small package of cannabis wrapped in tin foil (cf. &#x27;foilies&#x27; in Australia), retailing for between NZ$20–25 (depending on the region). A building where such retailing takes place (commonly a superficially unremarkable home) is a &quot;tinnie house&quot;. Other drugs such as methamphetamine may be available as well. In recent years the term has become not unusual in New Zealand court judgments involving the Misuse of Drugs Act.

Another variant of &quot;tinny&quot;/&quot;tinnie&quot; is as a slang term for a can of beer, commonly used in Australia. The word is also widely understood throughout the UK, where it has been used extensively to advertise Australian and Australia-themed lagers over many years. 
Although most &quot;tinnies&quot; in Australasia (and across the world) are actually now made of aluminium, the older term is still used generically across the region to refer to all cans of beer; not just those made of tin. 

In Australia and New Zealand &quot;tinny&quot; or &quot;tinnie&quot; is also commonly used as slang for a small open aluminium boat.

Short for tin-arse, &quot;tinny&quot; is also used in Australia and New Zealand to mean &quot;lucky&quot;, where an in individual should have met with bad circumstances but has avoided them through sheer luck. A common phrase would be &quot;he&#x27;s a tinny bastard&quot;.

Tingoora, a small town just north of Kingaroy in south-east Queensland, Australia, is also often referred to as &quot;Tinny&quot;, e.g. the &quot;Tinny Pub&quot;.

In the United States, a &quot;tinnie&quot; refers to a piece of tin foil that is made into a smoking device, most often for cannabis. It is used when nothing else of use can be found.

Other uses cover certain German medals or shops selling aluminium products.

==Other meanings==
One of the medieval Peel towers on the Scottish Borders was at Tinnies.

Colloquially meaning a game in which a group of people jump on top of each other to form a pile, like sardines in a tin. The game is initiated by an individual shouting &quot;Tinnies&quot;, then lying face down to allow other players to lie on top, forming the pile. This game is also known by the names &quot;Bundle&quot; or &quot;Pile-on.&quot;

&quot;Tinny&quot; is also a term for audio which lacks resonance, resembling a piece of tin being struck. 

The phrase is also referenced in the Monty Python sketch &quot;Woody and Tinny Words&quot; where Graham Chapman describes various seemingly-random words as being &quot;tinny&quot; or &quot;woody&quot; with the former utterance inducing great discomfort in his daughter.

In the Scots dialect of the town of Bathgate, West Lothian, &quot;Tinnie&quot; often refers to an aluminium can of Tennent&#x27;s Lager. &quot;Here Oj, gies a tinnie o&#x27;er mate&quot;.

<doc id="930752" wikidata="Q968971" url="?curid=930752" title="Vasily Chichagov">
<text>Vasily Yakovlevich Chichagov (; ) was an admiral in the Russian Navy who distinguished himself in the Russian–Swedish War by fighting three major battles, and an explorer who researched Svalbard.

He was the father of Pavel Chichagov, a Russian admiral during the Napoleonic Wars.

==Background==
Joining the Navy at the age of 16, Chichagov was educated in Great Britain. Throughout his life, he would become enthusiastic for all things British, eventually marry an English woman, and spend his last years in the United Kingdom (after he had settled into retirement in 1797).

==Expeditions==
In 1764, the scientist Lomonosov organized an expedition to find the Northeast Passage between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by sailing along the northern coast of Siberia. Chichagov, then serving as the deputy commandant of Arkhangelsk Port, was put in charge of the expedition with three ships, the &quot;Chichagov&quot;, the &quot;Panov&quot; and the &quot;Babayev&quot;. Although he sailed past Svalbard and reached 80°26&#x27;N in 1765 and 80°30&#x27;N in 1766, both expeditions failed to find the route. However, at that time it was the maximum progress of ships to the north; the expedition participants also carried out a large volume of geophysical, oceanographic and meteorological observations, describing the animal and plant life of Svalbard.

Islands of Novaya Zemlya Archipelago, the Chichagof Island in the Alexander Archipelago in southeastern Alaska, the bay and cape of Nuka Hiva, in the Marquesas Islands of French Polynesia, the inlet Chichagof Harbor on the island of Attu in the Aleutian Islands, and a mountain at Svalbard are named after Chichagov.

==Military career==

During the first Russo-Turkish War of Catherine&#x27;s reign, Chichagov was made responsible for the defense of the Kerch Strait, preventing the Ottoman warships from gaining access to the Sea of Azov. When the war over, he administered the ports of Arkhangelsk, Revel, and Kronstadt. During the Russo-Swedish War (1788–1790), he was the commander-in-chief of the Baltic Fleet. He won over and/or steadfastly fought against Sweden in the Battle of Öland (1789), the Battle of Reval (1790) and the Battle of Vyborg Bay. Victory in the battle of Reval proved his high ability in naval affairs, though indecision prevented him from achieving strategic success at the battle of Vyborg the same year and thus ending the war in Russia&#x27;s favor. Such a resounding success at Reval, despite the huge Swedish superiority in ships of the line, was to a great extent due to the Russian superiority in ship equipment (see Reval order of battle).

<doc id="930755" wikidata="Q593790" url="?curid=930755" title="Julián Javier">
<text>Manuel Julián Javier Liranzo (; born August 9, 1936), is a Dominican former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a second baseman from to , most prominently as a member of the St. Louis Cardinals where, he became a two-time All-Star player, and was a member of two World Series winning teams (, ). He played his final season with the Cincinnati Reds.

A light-hitting defensive specialist, he was nicknamed &quot;Hoolie&quot; by his teammates, and &quot;the Phantom&quot; by teammate Tim McCarver for his ability to avoid baserunners sliding into second base. Javier was an integral figure in the history and development of baseball in the Dominican Republic, founding multiple baseball leagues as well as the Gigantes del Cibao of the Dominican Winter League. His son Stan Javier, also played in Major League Baseball. In 2022, Javier was inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Julian became a well-known baseball phenomenon in his hometown of San Francisco de Macoris. As an amateur, he was a third baseman as well as a power hitter. It is legend that he has hit the longest home runs in the high school stadiums of San Francisco de Macoris to this date. He went on to represent the Dominican Republic in the 1955 Pan American Games, although he did not see much playing time, the team went on to win the first gold medal for the Dominican Republic at a Pan American Games. That team also had another future all-star major leaguer Felipe Alou.

==Trade to Cardinals==
The right-handed batting Javier signed as an amateur free agent with the Pittsburgh Pirates in . Coming up through the minor leagues, Javier became known as &quot;the fastest man in baseball.&quot; He batted .250 with twenty home runs in five years in their farm system, and had emerged as one of their top prospects when he was dealt to the St. Louis Cardinals on May 27, with a pitcher to be named later for Vinegar Bend Mizell and Dick Gray. The next day, he made his major league debut starting at second base for the Cards against the San Francisco Giants.

==Emerging as an All-Star==
Javier led the Cardinals in stolen bases every year from 1960 to . His finest season was . Sharing lead-off duties with Curt Flood in manager Johnny Keane&#x27;s batting order, Javier stole a career-high 26 bases and scored a career-high 97 runs. Javier led an inning off with a hit or walk 61 times for a .347 on-base percentage leading off innings.

When Pirates second baseman Bill Mazeroski was unable to start the 1963 All-Star game due to injury, Javier was added to the starting line-up. Along with Bill White at first base, Dick Groat at shortstop and Ken Boyer at third, they formed an all-Cardinal starting infield for the National League All-Star team.

==World Series champion==
After never finishing better than third in any of the first three seasons of Javier&#x27;s career, the Cardinals were in a heated battle with the Los Angeles Dodgers for first place in the National League for most of the season. The Dodgers came to St. Louis a game ahead of the Cards on September 16 for a three-game set. Javier went two-for-fourteen with two errors in this crucial series. The first error came in the ninth inning of the first game, allowing the Dodgers to score the final run of their 3–1 victory. The second error occurred on a Dick Tracewski ground ball in the thirteenth inning of the final game, allowing the Dodgers to complete the three-game sweep on their way to winning the National League pennant.

Javier drove in a career-high 65 runs and dropped to the seven spot in the batting order in . The 1964 Cardinals came back from eleven games out of first place on August 23 to win their first NL pennant since on the last day of the regular season by one game over the Cincinnati Reds and Philadelphia Phillies. When they faced the New York Yankees in the World Series, Javier was limited to one pinch-running appearance due to a bruised hip.

==Dominican Professional Baseball League suspension==
During the off-season, Javier caused some controversy in the Dominican League while playing with the Aguilas Cibaenas. During the winter league play-offs in the Dominican Republic after being called out on strikes by home plate umpire Emmett Ashford. Javier struck Ashford who during his 12 years in the PCL became the best-known umpire for being &quot; a showman, exuberant, strong, alert, loud and expressive,&quot; recalled Paul Wysard of Ashford&#x27;s&#x27; days in the PCL. The incident was initiated when Javier showed his dislike to the second called strike and Javier took his time to get back in the batter&#x27;s box, Ashford instructed the pitcher to pitch without Javier being in the batter&#x27;s box and called him out on strike infuriating Javier who voiced his discontent and got into an argument with expletives being called by both Javier and Ashford and then Javier struck Ashford twice in the face, Ashford responded hitting Javier back with the mask. Javier was originally suspended indefinitely by the Dominican Professional Baseball League, but after Javier pleaded his case and told his side of the story it was eventually cut to three days and fifty dollars, prompting Ashford to resign from the league.

After a contract dispute and visa problems caused Javier to miss part of spring training , a broken hand caused Javier to miss a month and a half of the regular season. In his absence, the Cardinals used a revolving door of second basemen that included Jerry Buchek, Phil Gagliano and Dal Maxvill. Javier was never able to regain form upon his return in August, as he batted just .195 with eight runs batted in over the rest of the season.

The World Series champions finished a disappointing 80–81 and in seventh place Red Schoendienst&#x27;s first season at the helm. Each member of St. Louis&#x27; aging infield was replaced heading into the season with the exception of Javier. The team showed modest improvement, but still managed only a sixth-place finish. For his part, Javier batted just a .228 with thirty RBIs, both career lows for a full, healthy season.

==1967 World Series==
After two subpar seasons in a row, Javier headed into spring training battling Phil Gagliano for the starting second base job. Javier ended up winning the job and carrying the Cards to victories in their first six games, batting .435 with two home runs and eight runs scored. His batting average hovered around .300 through the middle of July, as he finished the season at .281 with 64 RBIs and a career-high fourteen home runs. He was one of four Cardinals players to finish in the top ten in National League Most Valuable Player balloting.

The Cardinals won 101 games in to cruise into a rematch of the World Series with the Boston Red Sox. In the second game at Fenway Park, Boston&#x27;s Jim Lonborg came four outs away from recording the second no hitter in World Series history until Javier connected for a two-out double in the eighth. In the seventh and deciding game, Javier connected for a three-run home run off Lonborg to seal St. Louis&#x27; 7–2 win. He also had an RBI in the Cardinals&#x27; 6–0 game four victory.

He earned his second career All-Star nod when Red Schoendienst named him as a reserve on the NL team. The Cardinals won 97 games in to repeat as National League champions. They lost a seven-game World Series to the Detroit Tigers in which Javier batted .333 with three RBIs. He drove in the lone Cardinals run of their 13–1 game six loss.

==Cincinnati Reds==
Following the season, Javier began having back tax issues with the Internal Revenue Service that threatened his availability for the season. Coupled with Javier&#x27;s age (34 at the start of the season), this prompted Cardinals GM Bing Devine to trade Richie Allen to the Los Angeles Dodgers for former Rookie of the Year Ted Sizemore and minor league catcher Bob Stinson.

Javier managed to get his tax issues in order and reported to Spring training on time. He was the Cardinals&#x27; opening day second baseman due in part to an injury to Dal Maxvill that limited his availability, and had Sizemore opening the season at short. After a slow start, he was back in the Dominican for two weeks to be with his ailing younger brother, Luis. Following Luis&#x27; death, Javier returned to the Cardinals to bat .352 with two home runs and fifteen RBIs through the end of May. A dismal June (.088 batting average) prompted Schoendienst to shift Sizemore back to second and return Maxvill to short. Javier ended the season with a .259 batting average, three home runs, and 28 RBIs in ninety games.

Unhappy with a reserve role, Javier asked to be traded during Spring training . The Cardinals obliged, dealing him to the Cincinnati Reds for pitcher Tony Cloninger.

With Joe Morgan at second, most of Javier&#x27;s playing time with the Reds was at third base or as a pinch hitter. He batted .209 in 91 at-bats for the Reds. The &quot;Big Red Machine&quot; stormed into the post-season by 10.5 games over the Dodgers. Javier did not make a plate appearance in the 1972 National League Championship Series with the Pittsburgh Pirates, however, he appeared in four of the seven games of the 1972 World Series against the Oakland A&#x27;s. He retired at the end of the season.

==Career stats==


==Personal life==
He was married to Inés Negrin, with whom he had five sons and daughters: Julieta, Julián José, Stanley, Vienna Alexandra, and Lynette. Stan is named after friend and teammate Stan Musial. After losing his wife to stomach cancer in , he married Yolanda Then, his current wife. His oldest son, Manuel Julián, is an engineer in Santiago, Dominican Republic.

He also founded the Summer League, a professional baseball league with four teams in the cities of Santiago, Puerto Plata, La Vega and San Francisco de Macorís that played from 1975 to 1978. He also founded, with the help of his son Stan, the Gigantes del Cibao, one of the expansion teams in the Dominican Winter Baseball League (LIDOM).

Estadio Julian Javier, the stadium in Julián Javier&#x27;s hometown of San Francisco de Macorís, is named after him, and is the home stadium for the Gigantes del Cibao. He was chosen the all-time second baseman for the Águilas Cibaeñas, and his number (25) retired by them in the Dominican Winter Baseball League. He was inducted into the Dominican Republic Hall of Fame in , and is also a member of the Triple-A Hall of Fame in Columbus, Ohio for his remarkable performance with the Columbus Jets while playing in the Pirates&#x27; minor league system. He was inducted into the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame in 2012.

<doc id="930757" wikidata="Q1145488" url="?curid=930757" title="Lost Horizon (band)">
<text>Lost Horizon is a Swedish power metal band from Gothenburg. The band has esoteric stage personas similar to sword and sorcery fantasy, with the members wearing studded leather, cloaks and face paint. In their albums&#x27; liner notes, their stage names and roles are exaggerated to sound mystical and otherworldly in nature; for example, guitarist and lyricist Wojtek Lisicki is credited as the &quot;Earthshape&quot; of the &quot;Transcendental Protagonist&quot; and credited for &quot;Poesy of Spiritual Enlightenment/String Romanticism&quot;, with his proper roles given as a &quot;Translation For Mortals&quot;.

== History ==
Lost Horizon originated from the band Highlander, formed in 1990 with future HammerFall member Joacim Cans on vocals. The band went on hiatus from 1994 to 1999. Then the band reformed as Lost Horizon with vocalist Daniel Heiman. Lost Horizon released their first studio album &quot;Awakening the World&quot; in 2001.

In 2002, the band gained two new members: second guitarist Fredrik Olsson and keyboardist Attila Publik. The new lineup released &quot;A Flame to the Ground Beneath&quot; in 2003. Heiman and Olsson left Lost Horizon two years later, putting the band on hiatus. Their official website released three instrumental demos (&quot;Wizard&quot;, &quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;Fire&quot;) in 2009, but no new musical activities have been announced since then.

== Band members ==
* Transcendental Protagonist (Wojtek Lisicki) – guitars (Luciferion, Against The Plagues)
* Cosmic Antagonist (Martin Furängen) – bass (Luciferion)
* Preternatural Transmogrifyer (Christian Nyquist) – drums
* Perspicacious Protector (Attila Publik) – keyboards

<text>Stanley Julián Antonio Javier [hah-ve-ERR] (born January 9, 1964) is a Dominican former professional baseball outfielder, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1984 to 2001. A switch-hitter with good production from both sides of the plate, he also had a strong arm with the ability to play all three outfield positions exceptionally well. Javier is the son of former major league player Julián Javier, and was named after his father&#x27;s teammate and close friend, Stan Musial.

==Early years==
Javier signed with his father&#x27;s former franchise, the St. Louis Cardinals, as an amateur free agent at seventeen years old. After two years in the Appalachian League, in which he batted .264 with eleven home runs and 55 runs batted in, Javier was dealt to the New York Yankees with Bobby Meacham (who was also a minor leaguer at the time) for three minor leaguers who never materialized. After two more seasons in the Yankees&#x27; farm system, Javier made his major league debut as a September call-up in 1984 (he actually made the team out of Spring Training, but did not appear in any games before being optioned down to the double A Nashville Sounds). He had one hit in seven plate appearances. After the season, he was packaged with Tim Birtsas, Jay Howell, Eric Plunk and José Rijo to the Oakland Athletics for Rickey Henderson.

==Oakland A&#x27;s==
Javier spent his first season in the Oakland Athletics&#x27; organization with the Huntsville Stars, with whom he won the Southern League baseball championship. He made his Oakland A&#x27;s debut in May 1986, prior to that playing with the Tacoma Tigers, the Oakland A&#x27;s Triple-A Pacific Coast League affiliate. Javier remained with the club as a fourth outfielder through the 1988 season, in which the A&#x27;s captured the American League West crown. Javier batted .500 in his first post season, going two-for-four in both the 1988 American League Championship Series with the Boston Red Sox and World Series with the Los Angeles Dodgers.

In 1989, Javier saw quite a bit of playing time in right field when Jose Canseco was kept out of the line-up for the first half of the season by an injured left wrist. Javier played well enough to keep his team within 1.5 games of the first place California Angels in their star slugger&#x27;s absence, and they stormed to their second straight division crown upon his return. Though Javier logged just two plate appearances in his second post season without getting a hit, Oakland&#x27;s sweep of the San Francisco Giants in the 1989 World Series made Javier and his father just the third father and son combo to each win a World Series (Julián won with the St. Louis Cardinals in &amp; ).

Following the World Series, A&#x27;s second baseman Tony Phillips signed as a free agent with the Detroit Tigers. He was replaced by a platoon of Mike Gallego and Lance Blankenship, but the two managed just a .144 batting average, one home run and ten RBIs through the middle of May. In need of an upgrade at second, the A&#x27;s traded Javier to the Los Angeles Dodgers on May 13, 1990, for Willie Randolph.

==Los Angeles Dodgers==
With Kirk Gibson out due to surgery on his torn left hamstring, Javier was immediately inserted into the starting line-up in center field. Upon Gibson&#x27;s return, Javier settled into a pinch hitter and fourth outfielder role, and immediately became one of the hottest bats in the Dodgers&#x27; line-up. Over the remainder of the season, Javier batted .316 with seventeen runs batted in. Most of those RBIs seemed to come in clutch situations, as they did against the Chicago Cubs, Atlanta Braves, Montreal Expos and Philadelphia Phillies.

In Spring training 1991, the Dodgers experimented with Javier at third base, but the idea was abandoned by the time the season started. His numbers fell off in 1991, as he batted just .205 with one home run and eleven RBIs, but he still had a knack for big hits. On September 29, his pinch hit single in the ninth inning ignited a come-from-behind victory over the San Francisco Giants.

==Philadelphia Phillies==
With their record standing at 31–42 just before the midpoint of the 1992 season, the Dodgers went into rebuilding mode. On July 2, Javier was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for minor league pitcher Steve Searcy and a player to be named later. As the Phillies were in Los Angeles facing the Dodgers when the trade was made, Javier merely changed clubhouses, and found himself a uniform. He went three-for-four with a walk and RBI against his former team the day the trade was made.

Javier saw more regular action with the Phillies than he had ever seen with any team in his career, as he played in all 74 games that remained on the Phillies&#x27; 1992 schedule. After the season, he signed a one-year deal with the California Angels.

==California Angels==
Javier got off to a slow start with his new franchise, as he batted just .220 with no home runs and nine RBIs through the All-Star break. He performed far better in the second half of the 1993 season. Batting lead-off, and playing left field against the Chicago White Sox on August 6, Javier enjoyed a career game, going four-for-four with a walk, two RBIs and a run scored. He hit his first home run since May 22, 1992, on September 9 against the Detroit Tigers&#x27; Bill Gullickson, and hit two more in the final month of the season. He also batted .387 in the final month of the season to raise his season average to .291.

==Return to Oakland==
During the off season, Javier signed a two-year deal with the Oakland A&#x27;s to be their starting center fielder. Despite the fact that the season was cut short by a players strike, Javier hit a career high ten home runs that season. He followed that up with career highs in RBIs (56), runs (81) and stolen bases (36) in 1995. The 36 stolen bases included a run of 28 consecutive without being caught.

==San Francisco Giants==
His performance with Oakland earned Javier his first contract worth over a million dollars annually, as he signed a two-year pact worth $2.1 million on December 8, 1995, to replace Deion Sanders in center field for the San Francisco Giants. A right hamstring strain limited Javier during the first month of his first season in San Francisco, and ended it on July 16. At the time of his injury, he was rumored to be headed to the Baltimore Orioles in a deal for Bobby Bonilla.

The beginning of the 1997 season was interrupted by two trips to the Dominican Republic to be with his mother, who was dying of stomach cancer. He formed a platoon with Darryl Hamilton in center field, and shifted into right field for interleague games in American League ballparks when the designated hitter rule was in play. On June 12, in the first regular season interleague game in the history of Major League Baseball, Javier led off the third inning with baseball&#x27;s first interleague home run against the Texas Rangers&#x27; Darren Oliver. He also hit a game winning double in the seventh to carry his team to a 4–3 victory in this historic game. After narrowly avoiding a hundred losses, and finishing in last place in the National League West in , the Giants won their division in 1997. They were swept in three games by the Florida Marlins in the 1997 National League Division Series. Javier had five hits in twelve at-bats with one RBI and two runs scored.

With Glenallen Hill&#x27;s departure via free agency after the season, Javier moved to right field for the 1998 season. His season got started on the right foot when he hit a three-run double in the thirteenth inning of the season opener to secure the Giant&#x27;s 9–4 victory over the Houston Astros. Two days later, he enjoyed the first five RBI game of his career in the rubber game of the series with Houston. The Giants put together a six-game winning streak in September to suddenly become contenders in the National League&#x27;s wild card race after trailing the Chicago Cubs by five games at the start of the month. Javier provided the heroics in the sixth game of the streak with a two home run game against the Colorado Rockies (he hit just four all season). They ended the season tied with 89 wins apiece to force a one-game playoff at Wrigley Field. With the Giants trailing, 5–0, heading into the ninth inning, Javier drove in the Giants&#x27; first run of the game, and scored three batters later. The Giants, however, fell short, and were eliminated.

==Houston Astros==
The Houston Astros were decimated by injuries, but still holding on to a slim 1.5 game lead in the National League Central division when they acquired Javier from the Giants for pitching prospect Joe Messman just before the waiver deadline of August 31, 1999. Inserted into the number two slot in manager Larry Dierker&#x27;s batting order, Javier batted .328, and scored twelve runs in just twenty games to help guide the Astros into the post season. After the season, he signed as a free agent with the Seattle Mariners.

==Seattle Mariners==
Javier got off to a hot start with the Mariners, as he ended the month of April with a .343 batting average and sixteen runs scored. It was, however, his glove that provided the highlight of his stay in Seattle. He made a circus catch on June 4, 2000, to rob the San Diego Padres&#x27; Phil Nevin of a home run.

Having already announced that he would retire at the end of the season, Javier platooned with Al Martin in left field for a Mariners team that went on to win 116 games in 2001. He made a leaping catch to rob the New York Yankees&#x27; Alfonso Soriano of a home run in the third game of the 2001 American League Championship Series to ignite his team&#x27;s come from behind victory. He also hit the only post season home run of his career against Mike Mussina in game two.

==Career stats==

Having made the post season six times in his career, Javier batted .253 in the post season, with eight RBIs. He finished tenth in the AL in stolen bases in 1994, with 24, and seventh in the AL in steals in 1995, with 36.

While playing Winter ball in the Dominican Professional Baseball League, Javier won two batting titles back to back years and was named the all-time center fielder for the Aguilas Cibaenas. His father was named the all time second baseman for the team. Javier was inducted into the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame in 2011.

He was named the general manager of the Dominican Republic national baseball team in the first World Baseball Classic in 2006, and named again the general manager for the series. He currently works for the Major League Baseball Players Association.

<doc id="930791" wikidata="Q6269476" url="?curid=930791" title="Joint Victory Campaign 2004">
<text>The Joint Victory Campaign 2004 (JVC 2004) was a prominent political fundraising entity during the 2004 U.S. presidential election, operating as a 527 organization—a tax-exempt group engaged in political activities under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code. Established collaboratively by America Coming Together (ACT) and the Media Fund, JVC 2004 functioned as a joint fundraising committee, with its proceeds divided between these two organizations to support their respective political initiatives.

== Formation ==
Formed in late 2003, JVC 2004 was led by Steve Rosenthal and Harold Ickes, both prominent figures in Democratic political circles. The campaign served as the chief fundraising entity for the so-called Shadow Party—a network of nonprofit activist groups organized to promote Democratic Party agendas and candidates during the 2004 election cycle.

== Financial activities ==
In the 2004 election cycle, JVC 2004 emerged as one of the most significant 527 groups in terms of financial activity. It reported total receipts of approximately $71.8 million () and expenditures around $72.6 million (), ranking second among federally focused 527 organizations for that period.

The campaign attracted substantial contributions from several high-profile donors, including financier George Soros, insurance executive Peter B. Lewis, film producer Steve Bing, and philanthropist Linda Pritzker. These individuals were part of a broader group of affluent donors who collectively contributed millions to JVC 2004.

== Allocation of funds ==
The funds raised by JVC 2004 were allocated to its parent organizations, ACT and The Media Fund, each playing distinct roles in the campaign landscape. ACT focused on voter mobilization and registration efforts, aiming to increase electoral participation among demographics likely to support Democratic candidates. The Media Fund concentrated on producing and disseminating political advertisements critical of Republican candidates, particularly President George W. Bush.

== Impact and legacy ==
JVC 2004 and similar 527 organizations during the 2004 election cycle operated in a regulatory environment shaped by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, which imposed new restrictions on traditional party fundraising mechanisms. Consequently, 527 organizations became instrumental in channeling substantial financial resources into political campaigns, operating in a space that allowed for significant contributions outside the limits applied to direct candidate support.

<text>CIVAC (In Spanish: &quot;Ciudad Industrial del Valle de Cuernavaca&quot;, English: &quot;Industrial City of the Cuernavaca Valley&quot;) is an industrial park and residential neighborhood located on in the municipality of Jiutepec, approximately 10 minutes (by road) east of Cuernavaca, in the state of Morelos, Mexico. The climate in Civac is warm/subtropical with summer showers. It has an average temperature of 21°C, ranging from 0.5°C to 40°C. Its postal code is 62578 and its telephone code is 777. Civac is divided into two zones: industrial residential. 
The first factory was &quot;Mexama&quot; which opened in 1961. On March 4, 1966, The Industrial City was officially established under a mandate from President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz. That same year, Nissan Mexicana built and opened its first ever assembly plant outside Japan.

Civac is considered the most important economic development center of the State of Morelos and it accommodates a considerable number of national and international enterprises such as Roche (&quot;formerly Syntex&quot;), Unilever, NEC, Baxter International, Alucaps, Givaudan, GlaxoSmithKline, Fibrolub Mexicana, Mycom Mayekawa, along with another 120 companies. Nissan still operates in Civac; it is the largest facility in the industrial park, it has two manufacturing plants on site and employees more than 2000 workers.

PROCIVAC (Asociacion de Propietarios de CIVAC, &quot;CIVAC Owners Association&quot;) was created in 1972 to manage the operation of public services in the area. However, in 1993 its responsibilities were restricted to the industrial zone only.

PROCIVAC is in charge of water services, trash collection, road maintenance, landscape maintenance, public lighting, signage, and general infrastructure; PROCIVAC also supervises urban projects and offers advice on industrial safety and environmental preservation. Its key areas are: the CCEC (Centro de Control de Emergencias de Civac, &quot;Civac Emergency control center&quot;), specializing in the prevention, training, and control of industrial emergencies; and the ECCACIV, Latin America&#x27;s most modern wastewater treatment plant.
Civac residents have easy access to other services like public and private schools (Daycare, pre-school, elementary, middle school and two technological centers), medical facilities, worship temples, parks, banking facilities, shopping areas and a constant and affordable transportation system which connects them to Cuernavaca and Jiutepec metropolitan areas.

<text>The music of Uganda is broad and diverse, ranging from traditional indigenous music to Ugandan versions of many contemporary genres. Uganda is home to over 65 different ethnic groups and tribes, and they form the basis of all indigenous music.

The first form of popular music to arise out of traditional music was the Kadongo Kamu style of music, which arose out of traditional Kiganda music. From the 80s till early 90s, Kadongo Kamu was influenced by musicians such as Peterson Mutebi, Dan Mugula, Sebadduka Toffa, Fred Ssonko, Livingstone Kasozi, Fred Masagazi, Baligidde, Abuman Mukungu, Gerald Mukasa, Sauda Nakakaawa, Matia Luyima, Herman Basudde, and Paulo Kafeero music genres drew from Kadongo Kamu, making it the most influential style of music in Uganda. In the late 80s, the late Philly Lutaaya released his &quot;Born In Africa&#x27; album that would later dominate the air waves. Lutaaya also released his &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; that consisted of 8 songs. This album is still popular to date, all Philly Lutaaya&#x27;s songs are now anthems amongst Ugandan music lovers.

In the early 1990s, a new music genre afro ragga locally called &quot;Kidandali&quot; formed by Rasta Rob, Kid Fox, Ras Khan, Messe, Shanks Vivid, Menton Summer, Ragga Dee, Bebe Cool and Jose Chameleone Bobi Wine and Steve Jean - who would later produce their songs. In 1997, Emperor Orlandoh and Menton Summer were the darlings after their &quot;Sirikawo Baby&quot; song becoming a national hit.

In the year 1998, Red Banton rose to fame with his &quot;Noonya Money&quot; album. He became the first Ugandan artist to travel to UK on an Artist Visa.

Because of the effects of globalization, Uganda, like most African countries, has seen a growth in modern audio production. This has led to the adoption of western music styles like Dancehall and Hip Hop.

Uganda&#x27;s most travelled and popular DJ, Erycom, real names Mutebi Erycom, was the first Ugandan to own a Youtube channel and he&#x27;s among the first two Ugandans to make Ugandan music circulate online digitally.

DJ Erycom has used the availability of internet to promote Ugandan music and Ugandan artists, hence the reason as to why Ugandan music has reached every corner of this digital world.

A number of performing artists have joined the Uganda Performing Rights Society which has further more improved Uganda artists music and benefits through its roles as copyright administrators.

== Traditional Music from different regions of Uganda ==
Uganda is divided into 4 regions namely; Central, Northern, Eastern and Western. Each region has distinct traditional music as per the tribes and ethnicities.

Uganda&#x27;s nationalities are diverse and spread evenly throughout the country. Native music in Uganda, like in most African regions, is mainly functional. This means that most music and music activities usually have specific functions related to specific festivities like marriage, initiation, royal festivals, harvests and war among others. The music is performed by skilled tribesmen and women who are good at playing various traditional instruments, folk songs and traditional dances.

=== Central ===

The Baganda are found in Buganda in the central region; they are the largest native nationality in the country. The kingdom is ruled by a king, known as a Kabaka. The kabaka has traditionally been the main patron of the music of Buganda. Musical instruments include various forms of drums, making percussion an integral part of the music).

The massive and sacred royal drums are just one of the many drum types. The &quot;engalabi&quot; is another common drum and it is a long round shaped drum. The drums are used in unison with various other melodic musical instruments ranging from chordophones like the &quot;ennanga&quot; harp and the &quot;entongoli&quot; lyre, lamellophones, aerophones, and idiophones and the locally made fiddle called &quot;kadingidi&quot;.

Music is played for dancing in the community, Call and response style of singing is common with the Bantu from the 19th century. The Baganda have a variety of vibrant dances that go along with the elaborate instrumentation. The &quot;bakisimba&quot; dance is the most common and most performed. There are others like &quot;nankasa&quot; and the &quot;amaggunju&quot;. The amaggunju is an exclusive dance developed in the palace for the Kabaka.

Northern Uganda in particularly Acholi had a powerful Vocalist name Ojara Eddy in the late 80&#x27;s

=== Eastern === 
To differentiate Eastern region from other regions. This region has several tribes namely Bagwere,basoga,banyoli,bagisu,jopadhola,iteso,sabin,basamya and each tribe has its kind of music. In the 90s these tribes used to produce music using their own made instruments like the Bagwere had an instrument called kongo ,basoga had xylophones (mbeire),Jopadhola and banyoli had fumbo,iteso had adungu so during that time their music was different in production and composition according to which tribe was singing. In the 20th century, many tribes have tried to adopt to modern production and still they make their songs in their native languages according to their tribes . There are many artist from several tribes like bagwere have waisana,benenego, rapper sky dee,area b, waikere ,bluzman etc, Bagisu have san sea,ben,nutty neithan etc, Basoga have crazy mc,racheal magola,maro etc. Most of these tribes have kings that have helped in the promotion of culture and music at large , the Bagwere king is called ikumbania,the Bagisu king is called omukuka,the Basoga king is called chabazinga,the iteso king is called emorimori. Lastly eastern region has several district.

=== Western ===
Talents have developed from ages of Sister Charity, Chance Kahindo and Rasta Charz to the years of Ray G, Jolow, Allan Toniks, Seyo, T Bro, Emily Kikazi, Muzz Joe, T Paul, Rachael T, Mat Henry, CJ Champion to Penny Patra, Amani Amaniga, Carol Kay, Prettie Immaq and more of the new guys on block.
After the success of a one &quot;Omusheshe&quot; song of Ray G &amp; Spice Diana, Runyankole was embraced in major parts of Uganda. Central artists too teaming up with western Uganda&#x27;s artists on songs like &quot;True man hood&quot; Allstars ft T Bro, &quot;Tikikushemerire&quot; of Gen Geeon ft Jose Chameleon, &quot;Yeele&quot; Geosteady ft Ray G, &quot;Ninkukunda&quot; Ray G ft Voltage music, &quot;Mbarara boy&quot; Mc Kacheche ft John Blaq, &quot;Elevate&quot; Rachael T ft Colifixe, &quot;Sagala&quot; T Paul ft Cosign. These too have boosted the industry to the national level.

The growth of deejaying industry that saw the coming in of DJs Alberto 43, Dj Mats, DJ Sky, Riddim Selecta, Starcent Dj, Jahlive, DJ Emma, DJ Bristol and deejays labels like XL Deejayz Street Deejays, Massive effect Deejays, 43 Effect Deejays among a few.

Music promoters&#x27; impact. From Online and Offline, including Feezah music Uganda, Alpha Promotions, BantuHits, Uganda Djs Online Radio, Karen Promotions, D3 Promotions, Lala Promotions, Patra Promotions, JKG Promotions, MOK Alozius Promotions, individuals like Dely Derick, Mc Katala, Mr vybs live among many. 
Radio and Television are supporting talent too. The development of radio from the regions first radio &quot;Voice of Tooro&quot; to Radio West, Messiah Radio in Kasese, Voice of Kigezi to Endigyito, Voice of Kamwenge, Kasese Guide Radio, Rwenzori FM, BFM, Hits FM, and urban radios like Crooze FM, Boona FM, K Town Radio, Ngabu FM and Street Deejays Radio (Online Radio) has seen western Uganda&#x27;s music grow fast.
Television development has been slow thou the coming of TV West, and Bunyoro TV has also developed western Ugandas music.The two TVs have given platforms to the artists through playing their videos on visuals and bringing them to the public eye.
Through radios and TVs, we saw the coming of Mc Kacheche, Kunana MC, Lithan MC, Mr Jay among others. Kacheche&#x27;s coming is one of the reasons Western Uganda&#x27;s music has been embraced in the central. 
The growth in music events, especially in bars of Mbarara, Rukungiri, Kabale, Fort Portal, Ishaka, Kasese and Kamwenge gives platforms to the starting artists to be heard of.

== Popular music ==
Because of Uganda&#x27;s turbulent political history, there was never enough time for there to be a thriving pop music industry until relative peace was restored in the late 1980s. By then, musicians like Philly Lutaaya, Afrigo Band, and Elly Wamala were the few Ugandan acts to have had mainstream music success. Jimmy Katumba and his music group the Ebonies were also popular at this time, especially towards the 1990s.

Musicians like, Carol Nakimera, Kezia Nambi, Fred Maiso, Kads Band, Rasta Rob, Menton Summer were on top of the Ugandan music game between 1990 and 1997. Artists like, Livingstone Kasozi, Herman Basudde and Paulo Kafeero also played a great role in bringing live music near to the fans.

According to publicist Muhumuza Brian of Bryan Morel Publications and music promoter DJ Erycom, In the year 1998, Uganda experienced the biggest change musically. Thanks to musician Red Banton (the Five star general) who rose to fame with his Noonya Money hit song that played country wide. Red Banton ruled the Ugandan music scene until the year 2000 when Jose Chameleone returned from Kenya with his &quot;Mama Mia&quot; song that turned into a National anthem in Uganda and East Africa at large.

The 1990s saw Uganda&#x27;s love affair with Jamaican music begin when artists like Shanks Vivi Dee, Ragga Dee, and others were influenced by Jamaican superstars like Shabba Ranks. They imported the Ragga music culture into Uganda and, although they faced stiff competition from other African music styles and musicians at the time, in particular Soukous from Congo and Kwaito from South Africa, they formed the foundation of the pop music industry. But it was not until the 21st century when musicians like Chameleone emerged that a pop music scene really began.

By around 2007, there were a number of musicians practicing varied styles of music, and the role of western and Congolese/South African music had greatly diminished. Today, musicians like Iryn Namubiru and King Saha are just a few of the many pop musicians in a thriving and vibrant pop music scene. The pop music duo of Radio &amp; Weasel, the Goodlyfe Crew, is well known around Africa, being nominated in the continental MTV Base awards in 2010 and BET awards in 2013. In June 2015, Eddy Kenzo won the award for &quot;Best new international artist&quot; at the 2015 BET music awards.

=== Kadongo Kamu ===

The word &quot;Kadongo Kamu&quot; is a term in the Luganda language that means &quot;one guitar&quot;. The music is given this name because of the role played by the bass guitar, which most times is the solo instrument used in creation of the music. Perhaps the first well known artist of the genre was Fred Masagazi in the 1960s.

The late Elly Wamala contributed a lot in making urban Kadongo Kamu style. Christopher Sebadduka popularised the genre and perhaps this is why he is considered by many to be the God father of kadongo kamu. Elly Wamala abandoned this genre because it was also instrumented by non elite like Christopher Sebadduka. His brand of educative singing won him many fans and he is one of the few musicians who was involved with Uganda&#x27;s independence in 1962. . They were followed by a number of musicians who kept true to the style and sound of the music.

Herman Basudde was a very popular kadongo kamu musician in the 1980s and 1990s. So was Bernard Kabanda. Dan Mugula is one of the few surviving pioneers of the genre. Fred Ssebatta and Paulo Kafeero made their mark in the 1990s. Today, the genre is marginalized in favor of more recent styles of music. But because the music is loved by cultural loyalists in the buganda region, it is certain that there will always be an audience for kadongo kamu.

=== Kidandali ===
Kidandali is a music genre that currently is arguably the most popular genre of music in Uganda. However, the term &quot;kidandali&quot; is not universally agreed on as the name of this genre with some local sources preferring instead to use the very simplistic term &quot;Band Music&quot; while others prefer the term Afrobeat, even though the music shares no similarities with Afrobeat. The roots of this genre can be traced back to the bands that sprung up after Uganda got independence in 1962.

The Cranes Band, which later gave birth to Afrigo Band, can be regarded as the first group in the evolution process of this genre. At the very outset, their music was heavily influenced by Soukous and congolese artists like Franco were notable influences at the time. Jazz was also a notable influence. Along the way there were other bands like Rwenzori Band, Big Five Band and Simba Ngoma Band. But Afrigo Band was the most prominent and most enduring, especially throughout the political unrest of the 1970s to 1990s.

By the mid 1990s Afrigo Band was still heavily influenced by Soukous music, which by then was dominant all over the African continent. Artists like Joanita Kawalya and Rachael Magoola were part of Afrigo Band and helped lay the foundation for modern day Kidandali, alongside other bands like Kaads Band. The turning point, however, came with the formation of the record label Eagles Production which was responsible for producing artists like Mesach Semakula, Geoffrey Lutaaya, Ronald Mayinja and Haruna Mubiru. These artists took the mantle from Afrigo Band and further developed the genre after the turn of the century.

In the 2000s, the genre became identified with the Eagles Production label. The label continued to produce more talent, especially female artists like Ronald Mayinja, Geoffrey Lutaaya, Mesach Semakula, Roy Kapale, Mariam Ndagire, Phionah Mukasa, Mariam Mulinde, Queen Florence, The late Harriet Kisaakye Cathy Kusasira, Irene Namatovu and Stecia Mayanja. Another turning point was in 2008 when David Lutalo broke through with the hit song Kapapaala creating the way for the Urban Band genre to move beyond a genre that had for long been dominated by Eagles Production, Diamond Production, Kads Band, Backeys Band, Kats Production, The Hommies among others.

In the year 2003, Abdu Mulaasi debuted with his hit &quot;Omusono Gwa Mungu&quot;. He went on to release a number of other hits like: Swimming Pool, Njagal Ebbere, Ekyaapa, Obuffumbo Bwa Liizi, Ngenda Kusiba Farm and Omuchaina. By the end of the year 2010, Abdu Mulaasi had changed the sound of KadongoKamu hence introducing Urban Kadongo Kamu.

DJ Erycom, one of Uganda&#x27;s legendary Deejays was the first deejay to play, promote and popularize Kadongokamu music across bars and happening places in and outside Uganda.

About the same time, technology in audio production had enabled the genre to be reproduced digitally using Audio Workstations and the &quot;band&quot; element had all but disappeared. Recording studios like Kann, Dream Studios, Mozart and Paddyman took center stage. Many other independent solo artists started to practice the genre. Artists like Dr Tee, Martin Angume and even Chameleone achieved success with this genre. The genre is currently at the peak of its evolution with newer artists like Papa Cidy and Chris Evans helping create a dominant force that, alongside Dancehall, is the most popular stylistic genre in Uganda.

=== Dancehall ===
Dancehall music in Uganda is modeled after Jamaican Dancehall. It is among the most influential styles of music in the Ugandan pop music industry. The style of music is very similar to the Jamaican style and so like all imported genres, the only major difference is in language used. Although most dancehall artists will perform in their local language, in this case Luganda, many of them will every now and then try to mimic Jamaican patois. During the early to mid 1990s when Uganda&#x27;s pop industry was just beginning to be formed, the first international music to make an impression on Ugandan artists was the Raggamuffin music in Jamaica at the time. 
Artists like Shabba Ranks and Buju Banton became the inspiration for Ugandan artists like Shanks Vivi D, Ragga Dee, Menton Krono and Rasta Rob. The predominant beat that was used by these artists was the Dem Bow beat which was created by Shabba Ranks. This beat became the foundation on which all of Ugandan dancehall was to be built on later, just like it did with Reggaeton. In the late 1990s new artists like Mega Dee and Emperor Orlando joined the fray.

By the turn of the century, dancehall, or ragga as it was/is commonly called, was already the most popular music genre. New artists like Chameleone, Bebe Cool and Bobi Wine joined the scene and consolidated it. But they didn&#x27;t create any marked improvement in the quality and sound of the music they found, as it remained pretty simplistic and heavily based on Dem Bow. From then on, the quality of music became commensurate with the quality of production available. Chameleone was the first dancehall artist to try to fuse this ragga sound with other genres like Soukous and Kadongo Kamu. By around 2006, there were a variety of musicians practicing the genre but also without much advancement in style or sound.

By this time, Jamaican dancehall had already taken a sharp turn away from the harsh &quot;ragga&quot; sound based on chatting over simplistic riddims and there was a new wave of dancehall deejays like Vybz Kartel and Busy Signal who were deejaying over more advanced riddims. Artists like Dr Hilderman came into the scene with new words like Double bed Mazongoto and have continued to grow. It is not until very recently that we have begun to also see new Ugandan artists like Rabadaba, Sizza and Fidempa create a more modern version of dancehall. Ugandan dancehall artists have reaped big from the industry, many are industrious and live luxurious lives.

=== Hip Hop/R&amp;B ===
Hip Hop music in Uganda is modeled after American Hip Hop. There is really not much difference stylistically between Ugandan hip hop and the American version. Because of the digital revolution, there is access to modern production technologies in Uganda hence the &quot;beats&quot; that current local producers are creating are high quality and not far behind the American ones. The fundamental difference between the two genres is that in Uganda, as in most African countries, most artists will rap in their local language. In Uganda&#x27;s case, the language is Luganda. This has created the synonym &quot;Lugaflow&quot; to further define Ugandan rap music.

Hip hop is one of the newer genres to be widely practiced in Uganda. The two music groups, l Klear Kut and Bataka Squad were the first musical acts to do hip hop back in the late 1990s. Mainstream acceptance for the music genre was almost non existent by then. However, a number of the members of the aforementioned groups persisted with the genre, especially Navio (rapper) and Babaluku. Others like Sylvester &amp; Abramz also kept creating rap music, focusing on socially conscious themes and topics.

Around the middle of the previous decade, more acts started joining the fray, with Rocky Giant being one of the first rappers to be embraced in the mainstream. But it was not until GNL broke through circa 2008 that the genre really gained steam. GNL made hip hop more acceptable and accessible and many &quot;lugaflow&quot; rappers began to emerge. Since then there has been a flurry of activity on the scene with a sizable number of rappers enjoying relative success in the music industry and on the radio circuit. Musicians like Jay-P and keko are among a new breed of Ugandan hip hop acts appealing to a broader audience, with their music featuring on international platforms like MTV.

As with Hip Hop, R&amp;B in Uganda is modeled after American R&amp;B. There is not much history in Ugandan R&amp;B, with Steve Jean being the first artist to practice the genre around the turn of the century. But it was Michael Ross who really begun the trend circa 2002 with songs like How Do You Love and Sinorita. It was not until circa 2008 that a number of musicians started to embrace the style, with Myco Chris and Baby Joe among those in Diaspora that must be credited. Blu 3 and Aziz Azion are notable practitioners. Recently, artists like Nick Nola, Richy, Pallaso, Woodz and Yoyo have spread the appeal of the genre further.

=== Gospel ===
Early Gospel music in Uganda was modeled mainly after praise and worship music practiced by church choirs and bands. This was particularly true for the pentecostal/Born Again movement, locally referred to as Balokole.

Artists like Fiona Mukasa in the mid-1990s were responsible for taking praise and worship music out of the churches and onto the streets. Because of the influence of Soukous music at the time, this early gospel had a Soukous sound. Limit X were another gospel group that gained popularity during the 1990s, although the group had formed years earlier, in the late 1970s.

Just after the turn of the century, the styles in gospel became more diverse, with various groups like Sauti, and First Love adding to the urban sound created by Limit X. Others like George Okudi and Father Musaala had hits on the radio circuit and internationally.

Gospel, however, started having a notable impact on the music industry when Judith Babirye broke through circa 2007. Babirye, whose music was similar to Mukasa&#x27;s, was an instant hit and her song &quot;Beera Nange&quot; was among the songs of the year in its year of release.

She was followed by Wilson Bugembe, another musician who was readily embraced by the listening public with his songs becoming national hits, cutting across all demographics.

They have since been joined by various new artists like Levixone whose song &quot;mbeera&quot; turned into a hit song in year 2021 and others who are spanning various genres.

== Classical ==
There are a few music schools in a conservatoire model in Uganda, most of them in the capital Kampala. The music schools in Kampala include Kampala Music School, MusiConnexions Uganda and Esom Music School. &quot;Even though they are not very well equipped as a result of small budgets, they offer appropriate music training to many people. To date more young people and adults alike appreciate classical music better and as such they engage in taking private music lessons, attending classical music concerts and several take part in actual performances. There are a few Western music education stems way back to missionary times. Before the missionaries arrived in Uganda does not mean that music education was not in existence, but rather that it was different from what was introduced by missionaries. Classical music in Uganda is developing and growing little by little.

== Music industry ==
Uganda has a vibrant music industry that plays a fundamental role in the social and economic lives of many. Musicians are the main celebrities in Uganda, and all entertainment content from the mainstream media will most times be about music or musicians. The private lives of musicians are closely followed by many Ugandans. Music concerts, most times called album launches, are very popular. Many companies spend huge amounts of money on sponsoring these music concerts, and advertisements for the concerts are very common on radio and television.

The emphasis on music concerts comes from the fact that very few music artists make a worthwhile income from sales of their music on physical media. The lack of any distribution structure means that there is little to no incentive for capital investment in artist development or music sales. There are no genuine record labels, with most of the companies that are referred to as labels being merely artist management companies. Because of these inadequacies, there is a severe strain placed upon musicians to find profitability and sustainability in making music.

There have also been efforts at organizing the music industry, with the Uganda Performing Rights Society (UPRS), Bryan Morel Publications and Uganda Musicians Association being prime examples alongside a number of music awards organizations like AFRIMA Awards, PAM Awards and more recently HiPipo Music Awards. Attempts by some of these organizations to make use of an under-utilized and largely ignored copyright law to generate revenue from music distribution have proved fruitless. These are some of the challenges facing the music industry in the country and indeed are very similar to the ones facing most music industries around the world.

== Promotion of Ugandan Music ==
According to Jones, A.M (1954), traditional music has remained popular with rural communities and Uganda has a plethora of distinctive instruments, which can also be heard in contemporary popular music. The most notable record labels like Black Market Records and international organisations such as Singing Wells and Selam from the UK have been working to promote regional and traditional music in Uganda. Currently, the above organisations have been specialising in field-recording in rural areas. Their initial projects were aimed at helping the localisation of hip-hop, though they have recently been facilitating capacity building work (audio production, copyright knowledge) through the support of Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA). Some UK labels have picked up on obscure but cool local music scenes and some of Uganda&#x27;s music could fill this niche and find a route to international markets. These styles could include Larakaraka music from Gulu or Bukusu Music from the North East Mbale region. Alongside Kandongo Kamu, another native popular music is Kidandali. In their contemporary forms they are both fused with reggae and ragga.

Ugandan pop musicians have used radio and television to promote their music. Others have held concerts and others performing their music at events like weddings and other kinds of parties. With the coming of the internet, they used social media to promote their music. These avenues also helped then earn money. However, most Ugandan musicians haven&#x27;t yet embraced digital distribution of their music. The Covid-19 pandemic reached in Uganda and affected the way of music promotion and distribution and saw musicians embracing the use of the internet to promote and distribute their music. Musicians like Desire Luzinda, Navio, Iryn Namubiru, Bobi Wine, Gabriel K, Jose Chameleone and promotion managements like Bryan Morel Publications, Promoter Musa, Ivan Jay Music of Ivan Jay Music Promoter and Fezah changed the way of holding concerts and instead of having revelers physically at the venue, they held online concerts and their fans streamed their performances live and others broadcast them on television afterwards.

<doc id="930805" wikidata="Q4708668" url="?curid=930805" title="Alaskan Way Seawall">
<text>The Alaskan Way Seawall is a seawall which runs for approximately along the Elliott Bay waterfront southwest of downtown Seattle from Bay Street to S. Washington Street.
The seawall was being rebuilt in the 2010s as part of a waterfront redevelopment megaproject estimated to cost over $1 billion.

==History==

The seawall was built to provide level access to Seattle&#x27;s piers and supports the Alaskan Way Viaduct and Alaskan Way itself, which is a surface street. Completed in 1934, the seawall was built on top of wood piling.

===Replacement===
Despite efforts to prevent marine pest damage when the seawall was designed, after the 2001 Nisqually earthquake, the Seattle Department of Transportation found that gribbles had consumed all the wooden supports in some places.

The Washington State Department of Transportation states that there is a 1-in-20 chance that it could be shut down by an earthquake within the next decade, and so plans have been underway to replace both seawall and viaduct.

The seawall rebuild project was estimated to cost $350 million as part of an overall waterfront redevelopment budgeted in 2012 at $1.07 billion. The project is funded by a bond measure that was approved by Seattle voters in the November 2012 general election. Construction began in 2013 and was completed in 2017, more than a year late and costing $410 million.

<doc id="930808" wikidata="Q6483508" url="?curid=930808" title="Lance Parkin">
<text>Lance Parkin is a British author. He is best known for writing fiction and reference books for television series, in particular &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (and spin-offs including the Virgin New Adventures and Faction Paradox) and as a storyliner on &quot;Emmerdale&quot;.

==Doctor Who==
Parkin first became known in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fan circles, writing both criticism and fan fiction. His most notable work was for Seventh Door Fanzines, including the novella &quot;Snare&quot; in the &quot;Odyssey&quot; series (which he edited for a period) and 1994&#x27;s &quot;The Doctor Who Chronology&quot;, a detailed timeline of events in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; universe. The &quot;Odyssey&quot; series later included novellas by Parkin&#x27;s then-girlfriend Cassandra May and his later protégé Mark Clapham.

Parkin&#x27;s first professional novel, &quot;Just War&quot;, published in 1996, for Virgin&#x27;s New Adventures series of original fiction &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels. This was followed by &quot;A History of the Universe&quot; (a re-working of his &quot;Chronology&quot;) and a second novel, &quot;Cold Fusion&quot;, for Virgin&#x27;s Missing Adventures series.

Virgin lost the licence to publish &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fiction, and Parkin landed the job of writing the last New Adventure to feature the character of the Doctor, 1997&#x27;s &quot;The Dying Days&quot;. This was also the only Virgin novel to feature the eighth incarnation of the Doctor, played in the 1996 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television movie by Paul McGann. The Virgin &quot;Who&quot; books went out of print with the loss of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; licence and &quot;The Dying Days&quot;. The New Adventures continued without the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; label and Parkin returned to the series with 1998&#x27;s &quot;Beige Planet Mars&quot;, written with Mark Clapham.

Parkin continued writing official &quot;Doctor Who&quot; prose fiction for BBC Books, including a number of event books, including the 35th anniversary celebration &quot;The Infinity Doctors&quot;. &quot;The Dying Days&quot; became the first of several Virgin &quot;Doctor Who&quot; books to be re-worked as e-books for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who&quot; website. He wrote the last in BBC series of eighth Doctor novel adventures, &quot;The Gallifrey Chronicles&quot; (2005). In 2006 he updated &quot;A History of the Universe&quot; for Mad Norwegian with &quot;AHistory: An Unauthorized History of the Doctor Who Universe&quot;. In June 2008 it was announced that he would write a New Series Adventures novel, &quot;The Eyeless&quot;, starring the Tenth Doctor alone for release on Boxing Day 2008.

A trademark of Parkin&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels is the inclusion of a character written as if played by Ian Richardson, beginning with Oscar Steinmann in &quot;Just War&quot;. Parkin has said &quot;I’m sure there was a very good reason for that at one point, but if there is, I’ve forgotten it&quot;.

==Other works==
Around 1999, Parkin joined Virgin alumni Rebecca Levene and Gareth Roberts to work on the production team of television soap &quot;Emmerdale&quot;. He also once appeared as an extra in the series. Though he never scripted episodes for television, he later wrote both non-fiction (including &quot;30 Years of Emmerdale&quot;) and fiction (&quot;Mandy&#x27;s Secret Diary&quot;, &quot;Their Finest Hour&quot;) connected to the series. He has not worked in TV since leaving &quot;Emmerdale&quot;.

Parkin also writes non-fiction, including guides to &quot;Star Trek&quot; (&quot;Beyond the Final Frontier&quot;) and Philip Pullman&#x27;s &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; series (&quot;Dark Matters: An Unofficial and Unauthorised Guide to Philip Pullman&#x27;s &#x27;Dark Materials&#x27; Trilogy&quot;), both written with long-time friend Mark Jones, and &quot;Secret Identities: An Unofficial and Unauthorised Guide to Alias&quot; with Mark Clapham.

This was followed by &quot;Miranda&quot;, a comic based on a character in his &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novel &quot;Father Time&quot;. The comic was published through Comeuppance Comics, an independent comic company that shut down after three issues. With Parkin&#x27;s permission, Miranda was killed off in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; book Sometime Never... by Justin Richards.

Parkin also wrote &quot;The Winning Side&quot;, the first in the &quot;Time Hunter&quot; novella series, a spin-off from Telos Publishing&#x27;s line of official &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novellas, and &quot;Warlords of Utopia&quot;, the third in Mad Norwegian Press&#x27;s &quot;Faction Paradox&quot; series of novels.

Parkin had a regular column, &quot;Beige Planet Lance&quot; in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fanzine &quot;Enlightenment&quot;, which was published by the Doctor Who Information Network.

In 2014, he published a biography of comics writer Alan Moore, entitled &quot;Magic Words&quot;.

<text>Stephen Leo Bing (March 31, 1965 – June 22, 2020) was an American businessman, film producer, investor, and philanthropist. He had business interests in property and construction and was the founder of Shangri-La Entertainment and Shangri-La Music.

==Early life==
Bing was born in New York City on March 31, 1965. His parents were Helen, a nurse, and Peter Bing, a doctor in public health. He was Jewish on his father&#x27;s side and Croatian on his mother&#x27;s. Bing attended the Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles. At the age of 18, he inherited an estimated $600 million from his grandfather, Leo S. Bing, a real estate developer who had made his fortune in New York in the 1920s. The &quot;Los Angeles Business Journal&quot;″s January 2010 publication of &quot;The Lists 2010&quot; listed him in its &quot;Wealthiest Angelenos&quot; section of the magazine, which estimated his worth at $590 million, coming in at No. 46. After inheriting his fortune, Bing dropped out of Stanford University in his junior year to pursue a career in the entertainment industry.

==Entertainment industry==
In 2000, Bing launched his own production company, Shangri-La Entertainment. He reportedly invested around $85 million to co-finance &quot;The Polar Express&quot;, an animated film featuring the voice of Tom Hanks, which earned $285 million globally and was one of the year&#x27;s box-office successes. Bing was the financier of Robert Zemeckis&#x27; &quot;Beowulf&quot; and the financier and producer of &quot;Shine a Light&quot;, a Rolling Stones concert film directed by Martin Scorsese. 

In addition to his career financing and producing movies, he co-wrote the 1985 film, &quot;Missing in Action II: The Beginning&quot;, and the story and screenplay for the 2003 film, &quot;Kangaroo Jack&quot;. Bing also financed and produced the independently released Jerry Lee Lewis album &quot;Last Man Standing&quot;.

==Politics==
Beginning with a $500 contribution in 1993 to support Senator Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J. in his bid for re-election, Bing contributed more than $10.7 million at the federal level to the Democratic Party and its candidates.

The biggest checks were written in 2002 when he gave a total of $8.2 million to the Democratic National Committee. He also gave to specific candidates, including Al Gore, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, Nancy Pelosi, and Dianne Feinstein.

Bing was reported to have given at least $49.5 million during the 2006 election cycle in support of Proposition 87, a California initiative which sought to raise $4 billion in oil production taxes to help develop alternative fuels. Bing also supported several key races in other parts of the country as Democrats fought to win back control of Congress. They included Democratic challenger Bob Casey, Jr. in Pennsylvania, who unseated conservative GOP incumbent Senator Rick Santorum, and future United States senator Tammy Duckworth in Illinois, then a Democratic congressional hopeful and an Army National Guard major who lost her legs in Iraq, who went on to lose to State Senator Peter Roskam in that race.
Excluding Prop. 87 contributions, in California Bing donated $7.8 million worth from 2000 on, according to the California secretary of state. He spent $4.25 million in 2005 in a successful effort to defeat Prop. 77, a redistricting initiative sponsored by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Other beneficiaries of his political pursuits included: the California Democratic Party ($640,172); Governor Gray Davis ($675,000); and San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom, whose campaign received $750 in 2004.

In October 2008, Bing pledged to match donations made to the NO on Proposition 8 campaign from October 17 to October 19.

On December 18, 2008, the William J. Clinton Foundation released a list of all contributors. It included Stephen L. Bing, who gave between US$10–25 million.

On August 5, 2009, a 737 private aircraft owned by Bing and based at Hollywood Burbank Airport in Southern California, was utilized in the return of American reporters Laura Ling and Euna Lee who had spent 5 months of a 12-year sentence in North Korea. Former President Bill Clinton was instrumental in their return and accompanied the reporters back to the United States. Bing reportedly covered the whole cost of the flight, estimated to be around $200,000.

==Personal life==
===Lisa Bonder ===

In 2001, Bing sued billionaire Kirk Kerkorian for invasion of privacy. Bing alleged that convicted criminal and private investigator Anthony Pellicano took Bing&#x27;s dental floss out of his trash to collect his DNA. At the time, Kerkorian was in a legal fight with his former wife Lisa Bonder, a former professional tennis player, over the amount of child support he would pay, with the billionaire reportedly suspecting Bing (a previous boyfriend) to be the biological father of Bonder&#x27;s daughter Kira. After Bing was proven by DNA testing to be the father of Bonder&#x27;s child, Bing and Kerkorian settled their dispute out of court.

===Elizabeth Hurley ===
Bing had a relationship with Elizabeth Hurley, which resulted in a pregnancy. Bing urged Hurley to have an abortion, but Hurley refused. Bing denied paternity by alleging that he and Hurley had a brief, non-exclusive relationship in 2001. However, a DNA test established Bing as the child&#x27;s father. Hurley gave birth to Damian Charles Hurley on April 4, 2002. Hugh Grant is Damian&#x27;s godfather.

===Anthony Pellicano===
The paternity of Bonder&#x27;s daughter was revealed by Anthony Pellicano, a private investigator (and wiretapper) hired by Kerkorian&#x27;s lawyer, who was also a &quot;friend&quot; to Bing. According to an FBI summary, Pellicano sometimes played Hollywood clients against each other, at one point asking financier (and Bing friend) Ron Burkle for a $100,000 to $250,000 shakedown in order not to be investigated by Michael Ovitz, another Pellicano client. In a twist to the case, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported payments of $335,000 by Bing to Pellicano between June 2000 and August 2002.

According to excerpts of recorded calls, Pellicano bragged to Kerkorian&#x27;s lawyer in April and May 2002 that he was &quot;working for&quot; and &quot;consulting for&quot; Bing in matters related to Elizabeth Hurley and her son&#x27;s disputed paternity, which was then in the news. Martin Singer, a lawyer for Bing, called Pellicano&#x27;s statement regarding Hurley &quot;an absolute lie.&quot; (&quot;Daily Mail&quot; reportedly paid a &quot;substantial&quot; settlement to Bing in 2003 after Pellicano&#x27;s sworn statement that he had &quot;never been engaged by Mr. Bing nor his attorney Mr. Martin Singer to investigate anyone on Mr. Bing&#x27;s behalf, including Ms. Hurley.&quot;) Following two trials in 2008 in which Bing did not testify, Pellicano was convicted of 78 counts of wiretapping, racketeering, wire fraud, and conspiracy. Pellicano was sentenced to 15 years in prison and ordered, with Terry N. Christensen, to forfeit $2 million.

==Philanthropy==
In April 2012, Bing committed to join The Giving Pledge, set up by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, willingly donating the majority of his wealth to charity.

==Death==
Bing died by suicide on June 22, 2020, at the age of 55 by jumping from his condominium on the 27th floor of the Ten Thousand building at 10000 Santa Monica Boulevard in the Century City neighborhood of Los Angeles. He had been depressed about lack of human contact during the Coronavirus disease quarantine.

With a past linked to drug addiction, including the recent loss of a close girlfriend due to overdose, a history of failed investments in the film industry and failed relationships with both lovers and his own estranged children, at the time of his death, he was worth $300,000 in liquid assets having spent almost all of the $600 million he had inherited.

<text>Einhänder is a scrolling shooter video game developed and published by Square for the PlayStation. It was released in Japan on November 20, 1997 and in North America on May 5, 1998 by Sony Computer Entertainment. It was also re-released for the Japanese PlayStation Network on June 25, 2008. The name &quot;Einhänder&quot; is German and denotes a type of sword that is wielded with one hand, here used to refer to the single manipulator arm possessed by the player&#x27;s spacecraft.

The game is based on the story of the Greek&#x27;s mythology of Selene and Endymion and set in a fictional future during a war between the Earth and the Moon. The player is part of the Moon&#x27;s forces and must invade enemy territories to gather reconnaissance and enemy weapons. The music of the game, mainly in a techno/trance style, was composed by Kenichiro Fukui and was published in Japan as a soundtrack album. The game received positive reviews from critics, who praised its gameplay and graphics, but felt the game&#x27;s short duration and lack of two-player mode were minor flaws.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Einhänder&quot; is a shoot &#x27;em up game of the scrolling shooter subgenre in the tradition of games like &quot;Gradius&quot;, in which the player controls a fighter spacecraft that must destroy enemy craft in side-scrolling levels. The game&#x27;s graphics are in 2.5D, that is, in 3D with occasional shifting of camera angles, but with the player&#x27;s movement restricted to a two-dimensional plane. Pre-rendered full motion videos are used to illustrate pivotal scenes between stages.

The player can choose between multiple difficulty settings and three different models of the &quot;Einhänder&quot; fighter, in addition to two secret ones. The Japanese version also features a difficulty setting called &quot;Free&quot;, which grants unlimited continues but disables the score. The player&#x27;s fighter can move at different speeds and is equipped with a default machine gun as well as a manipulator arm, which is used to collect gunpods left by destroyed enemies. Gunpods have varying amounts of power, ammunition and range, and include cannons, guided missile launchers, aircraft-sized lightsabers and other types of weapons. Gunpods depleted of ammunition are discarded. They can be switched between an overhead and below-the-belly position, causing them to fire at different angles or directions. Most stages have a middle boss and an end boss, which often possess a main core and individual parts that can be destroyed.

The game&#x27;s score system is based on a multiplier bar and a hit gauge counter. As the player destroys enemy cores, the hit counter increases. Points awarded for destroyed cores are multiplied by the value of the hit counter. The counter decreases when the player stops destroying cores. However, if the multiplier reaches a certain amount it will begin to flash, awarding large point bonuses for any cores destroyed during this short period of time.

==Plot==
&quot;Einhänder&quot; takes place in a fictional future during a war between the Earth colony, Sodom and the Moon colony, Selene. The &quot;First Moon War&quot; resulted in the destruction of most of the Earth&#x27;s surface and the creation of a totalitarian regime on the planet. The game recounts the events of the &quot;Second Moon War&quot; in which the Moon attacks the Earth again for natural resources. Selene&#x27;s tactics consists of sending one-man fighter spacecraft called &quot;Einhänder&quot; on kamikaze missions to cause as much damage as possible on the planet before being destroyed. The player takes on the role of one of these pilots attacking the Earth capital city.

As the player progresses through the game, the Selenean military satellite Hyperion relays command orders and objectives. The on-board central computer &quot;EOS&quot; synthesizes orders. EOS also records and relays the player&#x27;s flight and battle record data back to Hyperion. After completion of the last objective Hyperion informs the player that the battle pattern of the latest EOS unmanned fighter is complete. The player is given the honor of being the target of the last EOS test as reward for their heroic efforts. Upon the player&#x27;s death they will advance two classes and be awarded the Sirius decoration. After surviving the intense barrage of artillery fire of the test, the pilot wonders why they must be terminated by their allies and questions their military leaders&#x27; rationale for the war.

The game&#x27;s narrative then skips to one month later when the pilot re-emerges in space flying an armed Einhänder spacecraft. Hyperion communicates that the player is committing an act of treason and must remove their armament and surrender. Still, the player fights their way through the Selenean fighters and faces the Hyperion, the game&#x27;s final boss. The ending sequence depicts the player&#x27;s spacecraft damaged and drifting in space. The pilot engages its thrusters and dives into an army of Selenean spacecraft with the Moon in the background. An epilogue shows the actions of the lone Einhänder pilot ended the war by destroying the armies of both sides — leading to an eventual peace. Yet, the pilot&#x27;s name and deeds were stricken from the records and they are remembered only by veterans of the war. In a post-credits scene, a lone Einhänder spacecraft is shown powering up.

==Development==
&quot;Einhänder&quot; was the first 3D shooter developed by Square, a company otherwise mostly known for their role-playing video games. It was directed by Tatsuo Fujii, who had previously worked at Konami as a programmer on shooters such as Gradius II and Xexex. The developers used German terms extensively for naming things in the game, in addition to a number of references from Greek mythology and the Bible. According to the gaming website &quot;IGN&quot;, a lot of the effects Square learned from creating &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; were also put in use in &quot;Einhänder&quot;. The game was showcased at the Tokyo Game Show in September 1997 and was initially planned for a Japanese release on October 16, 1997. Square released an unrelated game the following month, &quot;Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon&quot;, which came with a bonus &quot;Mysterious Data Disc&quot; featuring memory card data for various Square games, including &quot;Einhänder&quot;.

American publisher Working Designs was interested in publishing the game in North America for its &quot;Spaz&quot; brand of shoot &#x27;em ups, but could not as Sony Computer Entertainment (one of Working Design&#x27;s clients) had a partnership at the time; it was the sixth and final game in Sony&#x27;s deal to publish Square&#x27;s games, with &quot;Einhänder&quot; replacing &quot;Tobal 2&quot; in this position. For the North American version, the speed of the arm switching was increased and some power-ups were altered; the game mode called &quot;Free&quot; was removed; and the Gallery was given a modified interface and different pictures than those from the Japanese version. The game was not released in Europe. On June 25, 2008, Square Enix re-released the game as a digital download on the Japanese PlayStation Network.

===Music===

The music of &quot;Einhänder&quot; was composed, arranged, and produced by Kenichiro Fukui. Several tracks make use of genres of electronic music, such as progressive house, or other genres like hip hop, piano-based music or opera. The soundtrack of the game was published in Japan by DigiCube, a subsidiary of Square, on December 21, 1997, and was reissued by Square Enix on July 18, 2007, after DigiCube&#x27;s bankruptcy. The final track, titled &quot;Beginning&quot;, was also featured on &quot;Square Enix Music Compilation 2&quot;, a compilation album published on May 1, 2008 for members of the Japanese Square Enix website.

===Related media===
A 111-page official strategy guide, titled &quot;Einhänder Official Guidebook&quot;, was published in Japan by ASCII Corporation in December 1997. Its content includes stage maps, information on the spacecraft and data tables.

The development team behind &quot;Einhänder&quot; worked on the Gummi Ship portions for &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot;. In a similar vein as with &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and &quot;The World Ends with You&quot; in previous &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; games, &quot;Einhänder&quot; is represented in &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot; in the form of the Endymion being a Gummi Ship and Schwarzgeist being a secret boss in the Gummi Ship portions of the game along with a remix of the latter&#x27;s theme.

==Reception==
The game received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;, just one point shy of &quot;universal acclaim&quot;, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 31 out of 40.

American gaming publications stated that the game was especially notable for a shoot &#x27;em up as it had no strong competitor on the PlayStation at the time of its release. The website &quot;AllGame&quot; referred to the game as the best side scrolling shooter &quot;to come out in the post 16-bit era of video gaming&quot;, while &quot;Eurogamer&quot; called it &quot;the most successful of Square&#x27;s expeditions into non-RPG territory&quot;. &quot;Next Generation&quot; said in a contemporary review that the game &quot;makes no effort to be anything more than a traditional shooter, with the addition of 3D backgrounds and enemies, but waiting to see what&#x27;s next is a rewarding experience, as any game should be. It&#x27;s a welcome challenge for those gamers dying to play a good shooter; and hopefully, &quot;Einhander&quot; can inject some life into a moribund genre.&quot;

The gameplay was praised by critics. &quot;AllGame&quot; lauded the game&#x27;s intense action and diversity of spacecraft, the gun pod system and the fact that bosses are composed of different destructible parts. &quot;GamePro&quot; noted that while the gameplay scheme is common to other shoot &#x27;em ups, the title&#x27;s &quot;thumb-busting&quot; action and variety of weaponry made for an enjoyable experience. The site called diversity &quot;one of the game&#x27;s biggest assets&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; further called the game&#x27;s play mechanics &quot;finely tuned&quot; and featuring a &quot;fascinating&quot; plot, while &quot;IGN&quot; felt the tilting camera angles were one of the features that make the game &quot;so exciting&quot;.
Concerning the graphics, &quot;GameSpot&quot;, &quot;AllGame&quot; and &quot;Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine&quot; appreciated the level of details and effects used in the different stages, as well as the large size of the bosses. &quot;IGN&quot; noted that the game&#x27;s 3D graphics made it look &quot;substantially better&quot; than most of the other, sprite-based, shoot &#x27;em up games of the time.

The soundtrack of the game was praised by reviewers such as &quot;Eurogamer&quot;, &quot;IGN&quot;, Soundtrack Central and &quot;Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine&quot;.&#x27; &quot;GamePro&quot; noted that the techno music and sound effects fit the stages &quot;perfectly&quot;. However, &quot;GameSpot&quot; felt that the quality of the music and sound effects were &quot;good&quot; but globally not on par with that of the graphics. The game&#x27;s short duration and lack of a two-player mode were noted as the game&#x27;s only flaws by &quot;AllGame&quot; and &quot;GamePro&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; estimated that the game demands &quot;just over an hour&quot; to complete.

In Japan, &quot;Einhänder&quot; had sold 50,000 units three days after its release, and 100,000 units as of February 1999.

The game was a runner-up for the &quot;Best Action Game&quot; and &quot;Best Graphics&quot; awards at the 1998 &quot;OPM&quot; Editors&#x27; Awards, both of which went to &quot;Crash Bandicoot: Warped&quot;.

In 2007, &quot;IGN&quot; ranked it first in a top ten of the best 2D space shooters.

<doc id="930820" wikidata="Q2776878" url="?curid=930820" title="Hurricane Carmen">
<text>Hurricane Carmen was the most intense tropical cyclone of the 1974 Atlantic hurricane season. A destructive storm with widespread impacts, Carmen developed from a tropical wave that emerged from Africa toward the end of August. The disturbance traveled westward, and organized as a tropical depression east of the Lesser Antilles on August 29. The storm moved through the Caribbean Sea, and in an environment conducive to intensification, it quickly strengthened to its initial peak intensity as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Carmen moved ashore on the Yucatán Peninsula, where, despite striking a sparsely populated region, it caused significant crop damage and killed several people. Before the storm&#x27;s arrival, officials had set up several evacuation centers, and many residents had moved to higher ground.

Upon entering the Gulf of Mexico, Carmen turned northward and re-intensified as it approached the United States. Initially threatening the major city of New Orleans, it veered westward and made landfall on the marshland of southern Louisiana, eventually dissipating over eastern Texas on September 10. Tropical cyclone watches and warnings had been issued for the storm, and approximately 100,000 residents left their homes and sought shelter. Damage was lighter than first feared, but the sugar industry suffered substantial losses. Throughout its course, the hurricane killed 8 people and caused $162 million in damage. Due to the severity of the storm, the name &quot;Carmen&quot; was retired from the list of Atlantic tropical cyclone names.

==Meteorological history==

The origins of Hurricane Carmen can be traced to a weather disturbance over Africa during the middle of August 1974. The disturbance moved slowly westward with little convective activity initially, although upon entering the Atlantic Ocean, it spawned a tropical wave within the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The wave had intensified and broadened by August 25, and it eventually split into two components, the northernmost of which consolidated into an organized storm system. Moving westward, the system developed into a tropical depression on August 29, more than east of Guadeloupe. Due to favorable outflow from an anticyclone nearby, the depression gradually strengthened as it moved through the Lesser Antilles. It attained tropical storm status on August 30, south of Puerto Rico, and was named Carmen by the National Hurricane Center. At first, the storm&#x27;s proximity to Hispaniola prevented further strengthening, but by August 31, it had managed to intensify into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. As Carmen passed south of Jamaica, an eye feature briefly appeared.

On September 1, the hurricane began to rapidly deepen over warm waters of the Caribbean Sea; by 18:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), it had strengthened to Category 4 intensity. Continuing westward, the storm passed north of Swan Island later that day. Early on September 2, a double eyewall appeared on satellite imagery. Carmen&#x27;s forward movement gradually slowed as the storm took a west by north direction, and it reached its initial peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph (240 km/h), accompanied by a central barometric pressure of 928 mbar (hPa; 27.4 inHg). Atmospheric steering currents became increasingly weaker, and Carmen slowed to a drift. Later on September 2, the hurricane made landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula; its northern jog spared Belize City from a direct hit. The storm&#x27;s center passed a few miles north of Chetumal, Quintana Roo.

The cyclone drifted inland, deteriorating to a tropical storm on September 3. About a day later, Carmen emerged into the Gulf of Mexico, where it nearly stalled. Turning northward, the storm regained hurricane strength on September 5. Carmen continued to strengthen and accelerated northward towards the United States Gulf Coast, reaching a forward speed of ; at 00:00 UTC on September 7, it once again became a Category 3 major hurricane. The storm then became a Category 4 hurricane again and reached its second peak intensity while located south of Louisiana; although the wind speeds were identical to that of its initial peak, the barometric pressure was slightly higher. Carmen weakened and veered westward before landfall, ultimately striking south-central Louisiana. After moving ashore, the hurricane quickly lost strength and late on September 9 degenerated into a tropical depression. The depression moved westward and soon dissipated over eastern Texas.

==Preparations==

Initial reactions to the approaching hurricane in the Yucatán Peninsula were regarded as calm by the United States media. Mexican officials declared an emergency alert by September 2, although they did not advise any evacuations. Meteorologists in the United States urged those living near the coast to move inland immediately. Fearing significant loss of life and property, the Red Cross began preparations for the approaching hurricane in Belize. The following day, the Mexican Army rushed to set up emergency operation centers and shelters in five cities. Mobile communication units and relief teams were prepared for deployment following the storm&#x27;s passage. Many of the nearly 35,000 residents in and around the city of Chetumal evacuated to higher ground.

Although it initially threatened the United States city of New Orleans, the hurricane turned west prior to making landfall and spared the area from severe damage. Contrary to its actual path, forecasters predicted the hurricane to execute an eastward swerve toward Florida. Had the cyclone instead continued northward and traveled over Lake Pontchartrain, low-lying areas could have suffered &quot;catastrophic&quot; flooding. Over 100,000 residents of the Gulf Coast, mostly in Louisiana and Mississippi, evacuated in advance of the hurricane, causing heavy congestion on highways. About 60,000 people sought shelter in facilities across the New Orleans region, according to Red Cross officials.

Hurricane warnings were issued along the coast, while Coast Guard personnel went door-to-door on Grand Isle urging residents to leave the area. From there through the coast of southwestern Florida, small craft were advised to remain near shore due to rough seas. Offshore, workers were removed from oil rigs. Many Mississippi citizens, having experienced the destruction of Hurricane Camille just five years earlier, quickly left their coastal homes.

==Impact==
As a tropical depression and storm, Carmen produced moderate rainfall across Puerto Rico and the northern Lesser Antilles, peaking at in Jajome Alto, Puerto Rico. The storm spawned a tornado on Puerto Rico and triggered flash flooding, which collectively left over $2 million in damage. Winds approaching gale force affected several islands. Heavy rain fell on Hispaniola as the storm progressed westward, and on Jamaica, the storm caused three drownings. High winds and heavy rainfall were reported there and in Cuba. The hurricane damaged local reefs on the north shore of Jamaica during its passage. In Louisiana, Carmen caused about $150 million damage, much of it was in crop damage. Also, there were five storm-related deaths in Louisiana. Freshwater and tidal flooding occurred there, and, to a lesser degree, in the other Gulf Coast states.

On account of the hurricane&#x27;s landfall intensities and the widespread damage it caused, the name &quot;Carmen&quot; was later retired from the rotating lists of Atlantic hurricane names. It will never again be used to name a tropical storm in the Atlantic basin.

===Yucatán Peninsula===

Although Carmen made landfall as a powerful Category 4 hurricane, it caused significantly less damage than anticipated because it struck a sparsely populated region. However, torrential rainfall from the storm inundated farmland across the region, ruining rice crops. The fishing industry also sustained major losses. Communication with the hardest hit regions was lost following Carmen&#x27;s passage; however, early reports stated that at least five people were injured. Several days later, officials in Mexico confirmed that three people had been killed by the storm. Sustained winds of 136 mph (217 km/h) were reported in the city of Chetumal, which was described as a &quot;disaster&quot;. More than 5,000 people in the city lost their homes and belongings as a result of the storm. Officials in the area estimated that damage in Chetumal alone reached $8 million (1974 USD). Throughout the Yucatán Peninsula, Hurricane Carmen claimed four lives and wrought $10 million (1974 USD) in damage.

Following Carmen&#x27;s passage, officials feared the worst for an area of 1,000 mi2 (2,590 km2) where communication was lost in Belize. A reconnaissance task force was sent out from Belize City the day after Carmen made landfall to assist any residents stranded by the storm. One person was killed off the coast of Belize after being washed off his boat by large swells produced by Carmen. Three other fishermen were listed as missing following similar incidents. Thousands of people moved from coastal areas inland to escape the storm. Crop damage in the country was reportedly severe.

===United States===
Carmen dropped moderate rainfall along its path, though the heaviest rainfall occurred well to the east of the storm&#x27;s center, in southern Alabama and the northern Florida Panhandle. Precipitation peaked at over in Atmore, Alabama. Winds gusted up to , and along the coast, tides ran as high as above normal. Over northwestern Louisiana, winds ranged from and brought down several trees. In New Orleans, despite wind gusts to , minimal damage was reported. The hurricane&#x27;s effects in Baton Rouge were confined to strewn debris and a few downed trees. Because Carmen moved ashore over uninhabited marshland, it caused far less damage than initially feared. Nonetheless, tidal flooding from the Gulf of Mexico and coastal bodies of water was severe. Freshwater flooding was less extreme. In total, the storm inundated of land in Louisiana, including in Terrebonne Parish and in Plaquemines Parish. A large oak tree was overturned by high winds in the town of Jeanerette in Iberia Parish.
The storm&#x27;s greatest impact was the loss of sugar cane crops in Louisiana. An estimated of sugar cane in 16 parishes was damaged, and about 20 percent was completely ruined. After a tour of the affected area, then-Governor Edwin Edwards estimated crop damage alone at $400 million, although a more recent estimate placed total agricultural damage from the hurricane at $74 million. The sugar cane crop was crucial to the country&#x27;s sugar supplies, rendering the losses &quot;doubly bad&quot;, and sugar futures rose drastically after the storm. Other crops damaged by Carmen included soybeans, rice, and cotton.

Tidal action along the coast affected the balance of salinity in coastal marshes and water bodies. The sudden intrusion of saltwater stressed delicate plants. Fish, shrimp and oysters also suffered the ecological effects of Hurricane Carmen. Flooding on land caused some wildlife to drown. Several parks in Louisiana sustained damage, either from flooding or high winds; losses to Grand Island State Park in particular totaled $114,600. The oil and gas industry was also affected, and its estimated $24.7 million in losses resulted mainly from damage to equipment and offshore facilities. The storm diminished oil production by 1.4 million barrels when it shut down operations for 24 to 48 hours at various locations. Over 60,000 electric cooperative customers lost power.

The hurricane caused two fatalities in Louisiana: a utility repairman who was electrocuted while working on power lines damaged by strong winds, and a motorist who was involved in a storm-related traffic accident. Total monetary losses in the state was estimated at $150 million. Overall, the hurricane spawned four confirmed tornadoes. One touched down near Brandon, Mississippi, destroying a barn and causing other damage. Another struck Kaplan, Louisiana, injuring one person. The storm&#x27;s effects in Mississippi were described as minimal and were mainly confined to minor traffic accidents during bouts of heavy precipitation. Light to moderate rainfall from the storm extended as far east as Florida and Georgia and as far west as Oklahoma and Texas.

== In popular culture ==
Hurricane Carmen was depicted in the 1994 movie &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, in which the hurricane plays a major part in the movie&#x27;s plot.

<doc id="930830" wikidata="Q1554010" url="?curid=930830" title="Handstand">
<text>A handstand is the act of supporting the body in a stable, inverted vertical position by balancing on the hands. In a basic handstand, the body is held straight with arms and legs fully extended, with hands spaced approximately shoulder-width apart and the legs together. There are many variations of handstands, all of which require the performer to possess adequate balance and upper body strength. 

==Kinematics==
Handstands use the wrist flexor muscles as well as the anterior deltoid, pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, biceps brachii, and trapezius descendens. It is considered demanding in terms of both the muscle and joint requirement.

According to a 2017 study most handbalancers use wrist movement to maintain balance in a handstand.

Another study found that handbalancers who were also expert gymnasts had better coordination than those at an intermediate level of gymnastics. More advanced practitioners also altered their center of pressure less to change the center of mass when making corrections to handstand position.

Handstand moves involving an especially high amount of strength include the press handstand and handstand push-up.
==Types of activities that use handstands==
Handstands are performed in many athletic activities, including acro dance, cheerleading, circus, yoga, capoeira, calisthenics, swimming and gymnastics. Some variation of a handstand is performed on every gymnastic apparatus, and many tumbling skills pass through a handstand position during their execution. Breakdancers incorporate handstands in freezes and kicks. 

Handstands are known by various other names. In modern yoga as exercise, the handstand is called Adho Mukha Vrksasana. 
In capoeira it is named bananeira.

===Yoga===
In modern yoga as exercise, the handstand is among the inverted poses; it is known as Adho Mukha Vrksasana, Downward-facing Tree Pose. In traditional hatha yoga in the 18th and 19th centuries, the &quot;Vyayāmadipike&quot;, which calls it the &quot;second &quot;gardam&quot;&quot;, and the &quot;Śrītattvanidhi&quot; use the handstand in a sequence involving touching the nose to the ground; the &quot;Haṭhābhyāsapaddhati&quot; calls this Syenasana, meaning hawk pose.

===Swimming===
Swimmers often perform underwater handstands as a stunt, with their heads, arms, and bodies underwater and their legs and feet extended above the surface, often having games or contests with the winner being the person who can remain in an underwater handstand the longest.
Armstand dives—a category found in competitive platform diving—are dives that begin with a handstand. 

===Gymnastics===

There are two basic handstand styles in modern gymnastics: &quot;curved-back&quot; and &quot;straight-back&quot;. Straight-back style is employed when the aesthetics of straight body lines are desired and feasible. In many cases (e.g., when a handstand is being performed in conjunction with a gymnastic apparatus), however, the curved-back style is preferred as it offers superior control of the legs and torso over balance. In all cases, balance is maintained by shifting body weight towards the fingers or the heel of the hand.

All basic gymnastic handstands have these characteristics:
*&quot;Straight arms&quot; with hands placed on the ground approximately shoulder-width apart.
*&quot;Straight legs&quot;, held together.
*&quot;Pointed toes&quot; so as to continue the lines of the legs.

In addition, straight-back handstands have these characteristics:
*&quot;Tucked head&quot; (face pointed forward) as if standing upright.
*&quot;Straight spine&quot;, with hips pushed forward. If performed while lying flat, this would cause the small of the back to contact ground.

<text>Walter Karl Gustav August Ernst von Reichenau (8 October 1884 – 17 January 1942) was a German Generalfeldmarschall (Field Marshal) in the &quot;Heer&quot; (Army) of Nazi Germany during World War II. He was nicknamed &quot;The Bull&quot; (German: &quot;Der Bulle).&quot; Reichenau commanded the 6th Army, during the invasions of Belgium and France. During Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union, he continued to command the 6th Army as part of Army Group South as it captured Ukraine and advanced deep into the USSR.

While in command of the 6th Army during Operation Barbarossa in 1941, he issued the notorious Severity Order which encouraged German soldiers to murder Jewish civilians on the Eastern Front. Reichenau&#x27;s troops cooperated with the SS &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; in the commission of the massacre of over 33,000 Jews at Babi Yar, and assisted with other crimes against humanity that occurred in areas under his command during the Holocaust.

==Early life and service==
The son of Prussian Lieutenant General Ernst August von Reichenau (1841–1919), Walter von Reichenau was born in 1884, in Karlsruhe. One of his brothers was Ernst von Reichenau. Walter joined the Prussian Army as an artillery officer cadet on 14 March 1903. He then attended the Prussian War Academy, going on to serve as a staff officer to Max Hoffmann in the First World War. At the beginning of the war, Reichenau was Adjutant of the 1st Guards Field Artillery Regiment and in this position he was promoted to Captain on 28 November 1914 and awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class and 1st Class over the course of the year. The following year he was transferred to the German General Staff and in the course of 1915 he served as Second Staff Officer (Ib) of the 47th Reserve Division and then as First Staff Officer (Ia) of the 7th Cavalry Division.

Reichenau&#x27;s early years are described in conflicting terms, as both progressively minded but also brutal, with a history of executing soldiers who were AWOL, even in times of peace. Greatly unconventional, he was an avid outdoors man, spoke English at home and, in contrast to his later activities in Russia, insisted on supporting World War I Jewish veterans&#x27; events in full military uniform, even after Hitler came to power. In April 1919 he married the Silesian aristocrat Alexandrine Gräfin Maltzan Freiin zu Wartenberg und Penzlin (1895–1984), whose sister, Maria von Maltzan, was part of the German Resistance.

===Interwar period===
After the war, he joined the &quot;Grenzschutz Ost&quot; Freikorps as a General Staff officer, serving in Silesia and Pomerania. In 1919 Reichenau joined in the newly established &quot;Reichswehr&quot; of the Weimar Republic. The officer corps of the new armed forces&#x27; was limited to 4,000, and there was to be no General Staff. Reichenau took a post in the &quot;Truppenamt&quot;, which was the &quot;underground&quot; equivalent of the General Staff formed by Hans von Seeckt. He was promoted to Major in 1924, to Lieutenant Colonel on 1 April 1929 and Colonel on 1 February 1932. In 1930, Reichenau was appointed Chief of Staff to the Inspector of Signals at the Ministry of the Reichswehr. He was later introduced to Hitler in April 1932 by his uncle, a diplomat. Extremely ambitious, he saw the Nazi Party as a revolutionary vessel in which he could propel his career and so broke with the pro-Monarchist politics of the Prussian military caste and became a devoted Nazi.
As an outspoken ally and advocate of Hitler and the Nazi Party, Reichenau soon ran afoul of cabinet member and eventual Chancellor Kurt von Schleicher, who used his authority to have him transferred out of his prestigious posting in Berlin to the headquarters of the military district of East Prussia, a relative backwater. In East Prussia Reichenau served under General Werner von Blomberg, a fellow exile of Schleicher&#x27;s. Reichenau and Blomberg became political allies within the army and it was Reichenau who introduced Blomberg to Hitler. Blomberg, who had a reputation of being manipulated by Reichenau, was captivated by Hitler and both men soon used their connections with the Nazi party to advance. When Hitler came to power in January 1933, Blomberg became Minister of War. One of his first acts was to promote Reichenau to head the powerful Ministerial Office, acting as liaison officer between the Army and the Nazi Party. He played a leading role in persuading Nazi leaders such as Göring and Himmler that the power of Ernst Röhm and the SA must be broken if the army was to support the Nazi-led government. This led directly to the &quot;Night of the Long Knives&quot; of 30 June 1934.

In 1935, Reichenau was promoted to lieutenant general (&quot;Generalleutnant&quot;) and was also appointed to command the 7th Army Corps in Munich. Reichenau was one of Hitler&#x27;s favorite generals and his first choice for commander-in-chief of the &quot;Heer&quot; in 1934, but was overruled by President von Hindenburg who put in General Werner von Fritsch instead.

Reflecting Reichenau&#x27;s preference for assignments of political matter, Blomberg sent Reichenau to China in May 1934 to support General Alexander von Falkenhausen&#x27;s existing military assistance mission. Konstantin von Neurath, the Foreign Minister, and German ambassador to Japan Herbert von Dirksen, raised objections to Reichenau&#x27;s posting, fearing that the assignment of an officer of his stature could imperil Germany&#x27;s relationship with Japan.

In 1938, after the Blomberg–Fritsch affair, in which Fritsch was forced out of the Army command, Reichenau was again Hitler&#x27;s first choice for head of the &quot;Heer&quot;, but older leaders such as Gerd von Rundstedt and Ludwig Beck refused to serve under Reichenau, and Hitler again backed down. Von Reichenau was given Group Command at Leipzig, seen as a &quot;jumping off place to the top jobs in the Army.&quot; But von Reichenau is supposed to have opposed the invasion of Austria in March of 1938 and injured his standing with Hitler.

==World War II==

In September 1939, Reichenau commanded the 10th Army during the German invasion of Poland and was the first German to cross the Vistula river, which he swam across, pushing his clothes ahead of him in a raft. After the campaign he was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross for his role as commander of the 10th Army. 

In 1940 he led the 6th Army during the invasion of Belgium and France and later that year Hitler promoted him to &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; (field marshal) during the 1940 Field Marshal Ceremony.
During the German invasion of the Soviet Union, as commander of the 6th Army, he led his army into the heart of Russia during the summer of 1941. The 6th Army was a part of Army Group South, and captured Kiev, Belgorod, Kharkov and Kursk. During its offensive into the Soviet Union, the German army was confronted with a number of superior tank designs. Reichenau inspected the Soviet tanks he came across, entering each tank and measuring its armour plate. According to general staff officer Paul Jordan, after examining a T-34, Reichenau told his officers &quot;If the Russians ever produce it on an assembly line we will have lost the war.&quot;

In November 1941 Hitler relieved Field Marshal von Rundstedt from his command of Army Group South and promoted Reichenau to take his place. At his personal recommendation to Hitler, Friedrich Paulus, a protege of Reichenau&#x27;s and former member of his command staff, was promoted to take over his command of the 6th Army.

==Death==
Reichenau was a habitual cross-country runner and suffered a stroke after a routine run in cold weather on 14 January 1942. He then sustained severe head injuries when the flight carrying him back to Leipzig for medical attention crashed on landing in Lemberg. Whether he died from his stroke or from injuries sustained in the crash is unknown. He was replaced at Army Group South by Fedor von Bock and given a state funeral.

==Nazi political activities and war crimes==
Reichenau&#x27;s uncle was an ardent Nazi and introduced him to Adolf Hitler in April 1932. Reichenau joined the Nazi Party, although doing so was a violation of the army regulations laid down by Seeckt to insulate the army from national politics. Reichenau was an anti-Semite who equated Jewry with Bolshevism and a perceived Asian threat to Europe. Having died in 1942, Reichenau was never convicted of war crimes, but he was part of the German General Staff and High Command of the Armed Forces collectively indicted at Nuremberg. Specifically cited in the indictment was his &quot;Reichenau Order&quot;, commonly known as the Severity Order of October 1941, which supported Nazi genocidal policies and advocated for punishment against the “subhuman species” of Jews and the extermination of Jewish Bolshevism in Europe. 

The only objection Reichenau raised to the activities of the Einsatzgruppen in his sector was when they were killing so many Jews, so quickly, that they began to create ammunition shortages in his sector of operations, an issue he addressed by recommending that the SS and SD limit themselves to two bullets per Jew.

Reichenau was in charge of the area of operations in which SS, Einsatzgruppen, and Ukrainian auxiliaries committed the massacre of over 33,000 Jews at Babi Yar. Later that year in August, Reichenau also directly acted to ensure the execution of ninety Jewish children in the Bila Tserkva massacre, after Helmuth Groscurth petitioned him to avert the killings.

<doc id="930832" wikidata="Q384780" url="?curid=930832" title="Fisherman's Blues">
<text>Fisherman&#x27;s Blues is the fourth studio album by the Waterboys, released by Ensign Records in October 1988. The album marked a change in the band&#x27;s sound, with them abandoning their earlier grandiose rock sound for a mixture of traditional Irish music, traditional Scottish music, country music, and rock and roll. Critics were divided on its release with some disappointed at the change of direction and others ranking it among the Waterboys&#x27; best work. The album was
the Waterboys&#x27; best selling album, reaching a number 13 placing on the U.K. charts on release, and 76 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==Production history==

The history behind &quot;Fisherman&#x27;s Blues&quot; begins with Steve Wickham&#x27;s contribution to &quot;The Pan Within&quot; on the preceding Waterboys album &quot;This Is the Sea&quot;. Wickham joined the group officially in 1985 after &quot;This Is the Sea&quot; had been released. Mike Scott, the Waterboys&#x27; leader, spent time in Dublin with Wickham, and moved to Ireland in 1986. That year, the Waterboys performed &quot;Fisherman&#x27;s Blues&quot; on The Tube, which was the first time the new musical direction the band was taking was demonstrated.

The recording sessions for the album were lengthy and produced a great deal of music. The sessions began at Windmill Lane Studio in Dublin and lasted from January through March 1986. An additional session took place that December in San Francisco. From March to August 1987, the Waterboys were recording in Windmill Lane again. Scott moved to Galway and another year passed as the band recorded at Spiddal House, where Scott was living. The entire second side of the original record is made up of recordings from this 1988 session. The album was released that October. Scott describes the process; &quot;We started recording our fourth album in early &#x27;86 and completed it 100 songs and 2 years later&quot;. Scott recalled of the album in a 1993 interview with &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;There was a lot of indecision. I got too involved in the album and I lost perspective. We had blues songs, gospel songs, country songs, rock songs and ballads. I didn&#x27;t know where to take it. It could&#x27;ve been a gospel or country album. It could&#x27;ve sounded more like &quot;This Is the Sea&quot; or it could&#x27;ve been a traditional album. It could&#x27;ve been anything.&quot;

More songs from the album&#x27;s recording sessions were released on &quot;Too Close to Heaven&quot;, or &quot;Fisherman&#x27;s Blues, Part 2&quot; as it was titled in the United States, in 2002 by BMG and Razor and Tie Entertainment, respectively. Other songs from the sessions were unreleased for years, including one of the defining tracks of sessions, &quot;Higher In Time&quot;, a cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Baby Tonight&quot;, &quot;The Man With the Wind at His Heels&quot;, &quot;Stranger to Me&quot;, &quot;Saints and Angels&quot;, and &quot;Born to Be Together&quot;. A remastered &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; with additional tracks was released in May 2006.

A 7-CD box set, containing 121 tracks from the album sessions including all those on the original record and subsequent editions, plus a further 85 unreleased tracks was released on 14 October 2013.

==Songs==
The title track peaked at number three on the Billboard Modern Rock chart. The single for the song reached position 32 on the UK singles charts in 1989 and position 75, when re-issued in 1991. Country music song &quot;The Lost Highway&quot;, featuring Liam Ó Maonlaí on piano, appeared on the B-side. &quot;Fisherman&#x27;s Blues&quot; was used on the pilot episode of the TV series &quot;Lights Out&quot;, and has appeared on the soundtracks of the movies &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, &quot;Waking Ned Devine&quot; and &quot;Dream with the Fishes&quot;. Actress Emilia Clarke performed a cover version for the film &quot;Dom Hemingway&quot;.

&quot;Sweet Thing&quot; is a &quot;surprisingly successful&quot; cover of a song by Van Morrison, originally from Morrison&#x27;s 1968 album, &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;. The Waterboys&#x27; version on this album is a ; the song ends with the unplanned addition of verses from The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Blackbird&quot;, which Scott impulsively sang on the spot. A different recording of the song appeared on the second compact disc of the re-release of &quot;This Is the Sea&quot;.

&quot;Strange Boat&quot; lends its title to Ian Abrahams&#x27; biography of Mike Scott and the Waterboys, while the song &quot;World Party&quot; was the inspiration for Karl Wallinger&#x27;s band name. It reached position 19 on Billboard&#x27;s Modern Rock chart, and was voted number 69 on the KROQ Top 106.7 Countdown of 1989.

Jimmy Hickey, of the instrumental song &quot;Jimmy Hickey&#x27;s Waltz&quot;, was a member of the album&#x27;s production crew. The track begins with a recording of some conversation and laughter, which continues in the background as a violin begins to play a short waltz. The recording ends with some applause.

&quot;And a Bang on the Ear&quot;, in which Scott summarises a past romantic attachment in each verse, finishing the song with a current &quot;woman of the hearthfire&quot;, was released as the second single from the album. A live version of &quot;The Raggle Taggle Gypsy&quot; made up the B-side. A studio version of &quot;The Raggle Taggle Gypsy&quot; would appear on the Waterboys&#x27; next album &quot;Room to Roam&quot;. The single was chosen as a Radio One &quot;Single of the Week&quot;, but failed to chart. Confusion amongst listeners about what a bang on the ear might be about prompted the Waterboys&#x27; Frequently Asked Questions page to note, more than ten years later, that it was &quot;a term of affection&quot;. A &quot;bang&quot; means a kiss and this Irish phrase of &quot;bang on the ear&quot; can best be considered equivalent to the more common phrase &quot;peck on the cheek&quot;.

&quot;Has Anybody Here Seen Hank&quot; is a country music tribute to Hank Williams, listening to whom Scott described as &quot;a life-changing experience&quot;. The Waterboys had previously paid tribute to a different influence on Scott, Patti Smith, with the song &quot;A Girl Called Johnny&quot; on their first album, &quot;The Waterboys&quot;.

&quot;Dunford&#x27;s Fancy&quot; was written by Wickham for Steve Dunford, brother to Waterboys producer John Dunford.

&quot;The Stolen Child&quot; was the first William Butler Yeats poem that the Waterboys put to music. Another Yeats poem &quot;Love and Death&quot; appeared on &quot;Dream Harder&quot; in 1993. &quot;The Stolen Child&quot;, spoken by traditional Irish vocalist Tomás Mac Eoin with backup vocals by Scott, remains the group&#x27;s &quot;most famous poetic rendition&quot;.

The final song is only a brief snippet of the Woody Guthrie folk song &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot; with some of the American place names replaced with Irish ones.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Fisherman&#x27;s Blues&quot; was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

Abraham High School for Girls was dedicated in honor of his mother.

He is a founding member of the New Synagogue of Palm Beach.

==Political contributions==
Abraham is a long-time donor to the Democratic Party and the Clinton Foundation. He gave $1.5 million to the party and ranked as the number one contributor of soft money to the national parties in 2000.

<text>Hipódromo Camarero (formerly known as El Nuevo Comandante) is a horse racing building located in Canóvanas, Puerto Rico, to the east of San Juan and Carolina. It is about a fifteen-minute drive from Carolina&#x27;s Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport, and 25 minutes east from the Isla Verde hotel area. The new administration of Camarero Race Track Corporation start operations on January 5, 2007.

El Nuevo Comandante was built in 1976, and opened on October 31, 1976, to substitute the original &quot;El Comandante&quot; building, which had been located in Carolina, from January 1957 to mid October 1976. It has become arguably the most important horse racing complex in the island, holding horse races every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

Camarero features a betting window, in which players can try their luck at different games, such as &quot;El Pool Pote&quot; and others. The top award a player can win at Hipodromo Camarero is the &quot;Pool Pote&quot; (Pool Pot) which has reached a staggering 12 Million dollars and has been the largest pot ever won in Puerto Rico&#x27;s Horse Racing Industry. In addition to the betting windows at El Nuevo Comandante, the Industry has a link of betting agencies throughout Puerto Rico. These are called &quot;agencias hipicas&quot;, and people can go there to place bets as well and enjoy local refreshments and snacks.

Races at &quot;El Nuevo Comandante&quot; have been shown on local television and on radio since the building was inaugurated. Some of the most famous television sportscasters in Puerto Rican history have commented from there, including Norman H. Davila and Manolo Rivera Morales.

Some famous jockeys have run there too, including Hall of Famer Angel Cordero, John Velazquez, Luis Hiraldo and J.C. Diaz.

Famous horses imported to run at El Nuevo Comandante have been: Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes winner Bold Forbes, Santa Anita Derby winner Mister Frisky, Bandit Bomber and Dawn Glory (Stakes winner in USA).

Among the native horses: Hurly Road (Triple Crown winner), Ribot&#x27;s Verset (one of the best sires in Puerto Rican history), My favorite Place (Multiple allowance winner in California) Capa Prieto (undefeated for years), Camarero (Holds a record of 56 consecutive wins in a row), Vuelve Candy B (Triple Crown and Caribbean Derby winner and the only horse to earn a million dollars in Puerto Rico), El Platino (&quot;Copa Budweiser&quot; winner), Verset Dancer (Caribbean Derby winner and winner in USA) and Verset&#x27;s Jet (son of Verset Dancer) who&#x27;s the first horse to complete the Caribbean Derby and Confraternidad Stakes double. 

El Nuevo Comandante also has the infamous distinction (Guinness record) of having the horse with the most consecutive losses (Dona Chepa) with 134 consecutive loses (through 11/2/08 without a win)

El Nuevo Comandante is also the site where the most famous race in the Caribbean has been held for 32 years: The Clasico del Caribe has been celebrated there many times, with horses participating from Colombia, Venezuela, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Panama, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica and Puerto Rico, among other countries.

<doc id="930853" wikidata="Q320211" url="?curid=930853" title="Stan Winston">
<text>Stanley Winston (April 7, 1946 – June 15, 2008) was an American television and film special make-up effects artist, best known for his work in the &quot;Terminator&quot; series, the first three &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; films, &quot;Aliens&quot;, &quot;The Thing&quot;, the first two &quot;Predator&quot; films, &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot;, &quot;Iron Man&quot;, and &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot;. He won four Academy Awards for his work.

Winston, a frequent collaborator with directors James Cameron, Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton, owned several effects studios, including Stan Winston Digital. The established areas of expertise for Winston were in makeup, puppets and practical effects, but he had recently expanded his studio to encompass digital effects as well.

==Early life==
Winston was born on April 7, 1946, in Richmond, Virginia to a Jewish family, where he graduated from Washington-Lee High School in 1964. He studied painting and sculpture at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, from which he graduated in 1968.

==Career==
In 1969, after attending California State University, Long Beach, Winston moved to Hollywood to pursue a career as an actor. Struggling to find an acting job, he began a makeup apprenticeship at Walt Disney Studios.

===1970s===
In 1972, Winston established his own company, Stan Winston Studio, and in 1973, he won an Emmy Award for his effects work on the 1972 telefilm &quot;Gargoyles&quot;. Over the next seven years, Winston continued to receive Emmy Award nominations for work on projects and won another for 1974&#x27;s &quot;The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman&quot;. Winston also created the Wookiee costumes for the 1978 &quot;Star Wars Holiday Special&quot;. In 1978, Winston was the Special Make-up Designer for &quot;The Wiz&quot;.

===1980s===
In 1982, Winston received his first Oscar nomination for &quot;Heartbeeps&quot;, by which time he had set up his own studio. However, it was his ground-breaking work with Rob Bottin on his update of the science fiction horror classic &quot;The Thing&quot; that year that brought him to prominence in Hollywood. He also worked on supervised vision work on &quot;The Entity&quot;. Between then, he contributed some visual effects to &quot;Friday the 13th Part III&quot;, in which he made a slightly different head sculpt of Jason in an unused ending.

In 1983, Winston designed the Mr. Roboto facemask for the American rock group Styx.

In 1983 he also worked on the short-lived television series Manimal, for which he created the panther and hawk transformation effects.

Winston reached a new level of fame in 1984 when James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;The Terminator&quot; premiered. The movie was a surprise hit, and Winston&#x27;s work in bringing the titular metallic killing machine to life led to many new projects and additional collaborations with Cameron. In fact, Winston won his first Academy Award for Best Visual Effects in 1986 on James Cameron&#x27;s next movie, &quot;Aliens&quot;.

Over the next few years, Winston and his company received more accolades for its work on many more Hollywood films, including Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot;, John McTiernan&#x27;s &quot;Predator&quot;, &quot;Alien Nation&quot;, &quot;The Monster Squad&quot;, and &quot;Predator 2&quot;.

In 1988, Winston made his directorial debut with the horror movie &quot;Pumpkinhead&quot;, and won Best First Time Director at the Paris Film Festival. His next directing project was the child-friendly &quot;A Gnome Named Gnorm&quot; (1990), starring Anthony Michael Hall.

===1990s===
James Cameron drafted Winston and his team once again in 1990, this time for &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;. &quot;T2&quot; premiered in the summer of 1991, and Winston&#x27;s work on this box office hit won him two more Academy Awards for Best Makeup and Best Visual Effects.

In 1992, he was nominated for another Tim Burton film, the superhero sequel &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, where he designed the makeup prosthetics for Danny DeVito&#x27;s Penguin. Additionally, his studio was commissioned to create robotic penguin puppets that were used throughout the film.

Winston turned his attention from super villains and cyborgs to dinosaurs when Steven Spielberg enlisted his help to bring Michael Crichton&#x27;s &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; to the cinema screen. In 1993, the movie became a blockbuster and Winston won another Oscar for Best Visual Effects.

In 1993, Winston, Cameron and ex-ILM General Manager Scott Ross co-founded Digital Domain, one of the foremost digital and visual effects studios in the world. In 1998, after the box office success of &quot;Titanic&quot;, Cameron and Winston severed their working relationship with the company and resigned from its board of directors.

Winston and his team continued to provide effects work for many more films and expanded their work into animatronics. Some of Winston&#x27;s notable animatronics work can be found in &quot;The Ghost and the Darkness&quot; and &quot;T2-3D: Battle Across Time&quot;, James Cameron&#x27;s 3-D continuation of the &quot;Terminator&quot; series for the Universal Studios theme parks. One of Winston&#x27;s most ambitious animatronics projects was Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot;, which earned Winston another Oscar nomination for Best Visual Effects.

In 1996, Winston directed and co-produced the longest music video of all time, &quot;Ghosts&quot;, which was based on an original concept of Michael Jackson and Stephen King. The long-form music video presented a number of never before seen visual effects, and promoted music from &quot;Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix&quot;, which went on to become the biggest selling remix album of all time (13 million).

===2000s===
In 2001, Winston, together with Colleen Camp and Samuel Z. Arkoff&#x27;s son, Lou Arkoff, produced a series of made-for-cable films for Cinemax and HBO. The five films, referred to as &quot;Creature Features&quot;, were inspired by the titles of AIP monster movies from the 1950s — i.e., &quot;Earth vs. the Spider&quot; (1958), &quot;How to Make a Monster&quot; (1958), &quot;Day the World Ended&quot; (1955), &quot;The She-Creature&quot; (1956), and &quot;Teenage Caveman&quot; (1958) — but had completely different plots. two reasons Stan Winston did this was because he&#x27;d had worked with AIP in their last years providing special effects for The Bat People (1974) and start a toy line with action figures from the aforementioned four film remakes.

In 2002 Winston helped to launch a new comic line, Stan Winston&#x27;s Realm Of The Claw / Mutant Earth which was a flip book and ran for 4 issues. Stan Winston&#x27;s Trakk Monster Hunter came out in 2003 and ran for 2 issues. These were published by Image Comics.

In 2003, Winston was invited by the Smithsonian Institution to speak about his life and career in a public presentation sponsored by The Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation. The presentation took place on November 15, 2003, at the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of American History.

Winston also worked on &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot;.

By April 2003, Winston was working on his next project, &quot;Jurassic Park IV&quot;.
By April 2005, Winston said the film was on hold. The film would eventually be released in 2015 titled &quot;Jurassic World&quot;.

At the time of his death, Winston was working on the fourth &quot;Terminator&quot; film, &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot;, as well as frequent collaborator James Cameron&#x27;s film &quot;Avatar&quot;. Winston designed the original monsters that appeared in the Midway game &quot;The Suffering&quot; and its sequel, &quot;The Suffering: Ties That Bind&quot;.

==Death==

Stan Winston died on June 15, 2008, in Malibu, California, after suffering for seven years from multiple myeloma. A spokeswoman reported that he &quot;died peacefully at home surrounded by family.&quot; Winston was with his wife and two children, actor Matt Winston and Debbie Winston. Arnold Schwarzenegger made a public speech about his death, and Jon Favreau dedicated his Spike TV Scream Award to him upon receiving the award for Best Sci-Fi Movie for &quot;Iron Man&quot;. &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot; is dedicated to both Winston and Joseph R. Kubicek Sr, with the dedication appearing at both the beginning and end of the film. After his death, his four supervisors (Shane Mahan, John Rosengrant, Alan Scott, Lindsay Macgowan) founded and built their own studio, Legacy Effects, named to honor his memory.

==Stan Winston School==
In 2009, the year after his passing, the Winston family founded the Stan Winston School of Character Arts to &quot;preserve Stan&#x27;s legacy by inspiring and fostering creativity in a new generation of character creators.” The school, which is 100% online, currently offers hundreds of in-depth, on-demand educational video courses by Hollywood&#x27;s leading special effects artists and creators. Topics covered include design, sculpture, mold making, lab work, animatronics, makeup effects, puppet making, painting, and fabrication.

<doc id="930871" wikidata="Q7078906" url="?curid=930871" title="Off-speed pitch">
<text>In baseball, an off-speed pitch is a pitch thrown at a slower speed than a fastball. Breaking balls and changeups are the two most common types of off-speed pitches. Very slow pitches which require the batter to provide most of the power on contact through bat speed are known as &quot;junk&quot; and include the knuckleball and the Eephus pitch, a sort of extreme changeup. The specific goals of off-speed pitches may vary, but in general they are used to disrupt the batter&#x27;s timing, thereby lessening his chances of hitting the ball solidly or at all. Virtually all professional pitchers have at least one off-speed pitch in their repertoire. Despite the fact that most of these pitches break in some way (for instance, horizontally, vertically, gradually, or late in their trajectory), batters are sometimes able to anticipate them due to hints that the pitcher gives, such as changes in arm angle, arm speed, or placement of fingers.

== Types of off-speed pitches ==
Different off-speed pitches are thrown by manipulating the fingers&#x27; placement in relation to the seams of the baseball as well as manipulation of the wrist angle upon release of the ball. While there is no technical limit to the various ways in which off-speed pitches can be thrown, there are commonly used mechanics for each pitch type.

=== Curveball ===

When thrown, a curveball appears to rise out of the pitchers hand initially and is then followed by a large bending arc downward as the pitch nears home plate. It is held by placing the middle finger along one seam of the baseball with the index finger right next to it while the thumb is placed on the opposite these two fingers. Upon release, the pitcher will snap their wrist to supination in order to create the desired arc and trajectory.
=== Slider ===

A slider is a pitch that breaks more horizontally towards the pitcher&#x27;s glove side. It is generally thrown harder than a curveball with sharper spin. A slider is held similarly to the curveball however more pressure is applied with the middle finger. Unlike the curveball, no wrist manipulation is needed at release. The pressure from the finger on the outside of the ball creates the horizontal trajectory and the lack of wrist manipulation results in a faster pitch than the curveball.
=== Splitter ===

While considered an off-speed pitch, a splitter is also commonly referred to as a split-finger fastball although the speed of the pitch is quite slow (however among off-speed pitches it is fast, with a similar speed to that of a cutter). A splitter initially travels straight out of the hand, however it drops straight down suddenly as it nears home plate. The splitter is appropriately named after the way in which it is gripped. It is held by digging the ball deep between the index and middle fingers as if the ball is splitting them apart.
=== Changeup ===

The changeup is a pitch intended to look like a fastball upon release, however the way in which it is gripped and thrown causes it to be much slower and start to drop down and to the pitcher&#x27;s arm side. It is held like a four-seam fastball (which is why its spin can be deceiving to a batter), however the middle and ring fingers rest across the seams rather than the index and middle fingers. Upon release, the pitcher will need to manipulate the wrist into pronation which helps create the late arm side movement.
=== Knuckleball ===

A knuckleball is a unique pitch not often utilized by many pitchers due to its sporadic and unexpected movement, making it tough for catchers to glove it. When thrown, it has no spin and almost appears to hover unnaturally from side to side. Its name is derived from the grip as the pitcher digs the knuckles from their index, middle, and occasionally even the ring finger on one seam of the baseball. This has changed now, and many knuckleballers use a more effective grip, digging their fingertips into the ball instead. The pitch is thrown similar to a four-seam fastball, although the pitcher keeps their wrist stiff until release, letting the ball slip out of the hand.
=== Screwball ===

A screwball is an off-speed breaking pitch that is thrown by a pitcher intending for it to have the opposite breaking movement of a curveball, slider and just about every other breaking pitch in a pitcher&#x27;s arsenal though it usually mostly resembles a reverse curveball when thrown. This opposite break is achieved using an grip similar to a circle changeup and an unorthodox pronation of a pitcher&#x27;s arm upon release. This unorthodox pronation is one of the major reasons it is one of rarest pitches thrown in professional baseball today as there is a widespread believed consensus that throwing this pitch will put extreme damage and deterioration on a pitcher&#x27;s arm. This belief has been contested, as some tests have shown that it puts similar stresses on the elbow throwing a curveball or fastball does.

== History ==
The curveball is recognized as the first off-speed pitch to be thrown, and it is accredited to Candy Cummings who was playing for the Brooklyn Excelsiors in 1867. However, it was not until he joined the Brooklyn Stars and linked up with catcher Nat Hicks that his curveball was perfected. Hicks was one of the first catchers to squat right behind the batter which made catching the curveball much easier.

The slider is the next oldest pitch on record. While the true first to use the slider is largely debated, Chief Bender is cited as the first to throw the slider with his variation known as the &quot;nickel curve&quot;. Some argue that George Blaeholder was the first to throw a true, traditional slider in the 1920s while playing with the St. Louis Browns.

<text>The magic in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; consists of the spells and magic systems used in the settings of the role-playing game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;D&amp;D&quot;). &quot;D&amp;D&quot; defined the genre of fantasy role-playing games, and remains the most popular table-top version. Many of the original concepts have become widely used in the role-playing community across many different fictional worlds, as well as across all manner of popular media including books, board games, video games, and films.

The specific effects of each spell, and even the names of some spells, vary from edition to edition of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; corpus.
== Development ==
===Origins===
In 1974, the 36-page &quot;Volume 1: Men &amp; Magic&quot; pamphlet was published as part of the original &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; boxed set and included 12 pages about magic. It primarily describes individual spells where the &quot;spells often but not always have both duration and ranges, and the explanation of spells frequently references earlier &quot;Chainmail&quot; materials&quot;. The first edition had over 100 spells that were &quot;largely inflexible&quot; and when a caster ran out of spells to cast, they were &quot;defenseless fodder for orcs, goblins, and trolls&quot;. If a caster could &quot;survive those vulnerable early levels, spells could grant godlike powers, like the reality-warping Wish spell, which does exactly what you think it does. A maxed-level fighter might be Achilles, but a level 20 magic-user was Zeus&quot;.

The publication of &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (1977) included a much more complex and systematic style to magic. &quot;There is still a long list of individual spells, but every spell now includes a matrix specifying spell level, duration, area of effect, components, casting time, and saving throw&quot;. There are three types of components: &quot;verbal components are magic words, material components are physical elements,&quot; and &quot;somatic components are the arcane gestures of the hand and body&quot;. Magic was now divided into either arcane or divine magic.

This edition also includes what the game designer community would come to call the Vancian magic system. &quot;In the Vancian model of magic, magic users must memorize all the spells which they wish to cast. When they cast a given spell, it disappears from memory and must be memorized again if the magic user so desires&quot;. The idea of spell memorization was inspired by the way magic works in Jack Vance&#x27;s &quot;Dying Earth&quot; stories. In 1976, Gary Gygax wrote: If magic is unrestrained in the campaign, D&amp;D quickly degenerates into a weird wizard show where players get bored quickly... It is the opinion of this writer that the most desirable game is one in which the various character types are able to compete with each other as relative equals, for that will maintain freshness in the campaign.The intent of the Vancian magic system in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; was to create restraints on magic users to balance the overall game.

===d20 System===
The d20 System was published in 2000 by Wizards of the Coast and was originally developed for the third edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Due to the Open Game License, the core set of rules are used as the basis for many games. Thus, many d20 games might use the D&amp;D spell list from the System Reference Document, while others create their own or even replace the entire magic system.

The Vancian magic system included &quot;basic assumptions about how arcane magic worked&quot; that &quot;only began to change with D&amp;D 3e (2000), which introduced the non-memorizing sorcerer, and with D&amp;D 3.5e (2003), which introduced the at-will warlock&quot;.

=== Modernization ===
The fourth edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (2008) added unique powers to every class with a focus on party roles rather than just spell-casters having powers. The mechanical change of adding at-will and encounter powers &quot;moved spell-casters away from the idea of &#x27;Vancian&#x27; spell casting [...]. Magic items were also built into a character&#x27;s progression, with each item having suggested levels&quot;. Fourth edition divided magic into three types: arcane, divine and primal. Druids now practiced primal magic while clerics and paladins practiced divine magic. Fourth edition also initially &quot;abandoned the school-of-magic approach&quot; to arcane magic, however, magic school specialization was reintroduced in the fourth edition Essentials line.

The fifth edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (2014) uses a hybrid system of Vancian and at-will magic. Some classes, such as clerics and wizards, go through the process of preparing spells they can cast everyday from their spell list. Other classes, such as bards and sorcerers, &quot;have a limited list of spells they know that are always fixed in the mind&quot;. The idea of at-will magic from fourth edition &quot;mainly survives now as the mechanic behind cantrips, which allow spellcasting classes to keep using magic even when&quot; they&#x27;ve used up all of their daily spell slots. Magic is once again only divided into two types: arcane and divine. In terms of spell usage across all classes, Kaila Hale-Stern, for &quot;The Mary-Sue&quot;, reported that of the 5th edition spells known or prepared by spell caster players on D&amp;D Beyond the three most popular spells are &quot;Cure Wounds&quot;, &quot;Healing Word&quot;, and &quot;Detect Magic&quot;.

The One D&amp;D public playtest reintroduced the fourth edition division of magic types: arcane, divine and primal in August 2022, although this division was removed in September 2023. The upcoming &quot;Revised Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (2024) will include &quot;over 400 spells, 30 of which are brand new, 27 of which are redesigned, and 162 of which are &#x27;reworked&#x27;&quot;. The 2024 Revised 5th Edition will also remove the division of spellcasters with known spells and spellcasters with prepared spells. Christian Hoffer of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; explained that in 5th Edition &quot;classes with prepared spells offered more day-to-day flexibility, while classes with known spells were a bit more limited in their day-to-day options but always knew what spells they could use on any given day. In the 2024 &quot;Core Rulebooks,&quot; all spellcasting classes have prepared spells, with each class stating how many spells a player can have prepared and how often they can swap out a prepared spell&quot;.

== Magic system ==
=== Types ===
In the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game, magic is a force of nature and a part of the world. Since the publication of &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (1977), magic has typically been divided into two main types: arcane, which comes from the world and universe around the caster, and divine, which is inspired from above (or below): the realms of gods and demons. While there is no mechanical difference between arcane and divine magic, Jeremy Crawford, Co-Lead Designer of the 5th Edition, said:That divide between arcane and divine ultimately is way more about the spellcaster than is about the spell. [...] So many different motivations can influence how magic users use their magic and to what purpose they put it. Your class helps determine that, and again this meta divide between divine and arcane can also provide a role-playing framework, and is this magic coming in service to a being or cause or are you in way manipulating reality to your own designs. Those are the questions posed by arcane magic and divine magic.Bards, sorcerers, warlocks, and wizards learn to cast arcane spells, which are typically flashy and powerful. Clerics, druids, rangers and paladins cast divine spells, which draw their power from a deity, from nature, or simply the caster&#x27;s inner faith. While some spells can be cast by both arcane and divine casters, other spells are limited to one type or the other. Crawford highlighted the thematic difference between divine and arcane magic, where the spell lists for divine spellcasters have fewer destructive spells and instead &quot;tend to be filled with healing magic, magic that protects people. [...] Arcane power at its heart is really in a way about hacking the multiverse&quot;. As a result, spell lists for arcane spellcasters have &quot;more spells that change the form of things, transmutation magic that completely alters the shape of something&quot; and &quot;more spells that will just alter reality culminating with the spell of spells wish&quot;.

The fourth edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; introduced a third type of magic called primal, which comes from the natural world; in this edition, druids channeled primal magic instead of divine. The fifth edition returned to original division of magic types.

==== Arcane magic ====
These are typically spells devoted to manipulating energy, converting one substance to another, or calling on the services of other creatures. Under the Vancian magic system, wizards would have access to spells that were committed to memory after a session of meditation upon a spellbook containing the details of the incantation. Once prepared, the spell is cast using specific words and/or gestures, and sometimes a specific material component; but the act of casting the spell causes it to fade from the wizard&#x27;s memory, so that they cannot cast it again without first re-memorizing it. As the 3rd edition moved away from the Vancian magic system, some arcane spellcasters, such as sorcerers and bards, just knew their spells innately.

Sorcerers are innate casters whose magic is influenced by the origin of their arcane connection. &quot;Some sorcerers trace their magic back to a powerful ancestor, like a dragon, a celestial, or a djinni. Others can delineate their magic to an extraplanar source, such as the shrouded lands of the Shadowfell, or the roiling chaos of Limbo&quot;. This origin adds both thematic and mechanical constraints on the types of spells a sorcerer can learn.

Bards have access to both destructive and healing spells. The healing aspect is &quot;influenced by Irish mythology&quot; where bards use &quot;music and storytelling to weave together this magic to restore vigor and health to other people&quot;. Arcane power can also be accessed by more martial classes in the form of specific subclasses such as the arcane trickster and the eldritch knight in 5th edition.

==== Divine magic ====
Divine spells take their name from the fact that they are mainly granted to clerics by the grace of the cleric&#x27;s patron deity, although the spells cast by druids, rangers and paladins also come under this category. Divine spells do not need to be prepared from a spell book. These spells are generally less overtly powerful than arcane spells and have fewer offensive applications.

Cleric spells are typically devoted to either healing the wounded, restoring lost abilities, and acquiring blessings, or to inflict harm and to curse opponents. These spells must be prepared by the caster daily through a session of meditation or prayer. Clerics also have the ability either to turn (drive off or destroy) or to rebuke (cow or command) undead, based on their alignment. The spells and abilities of a cleric are based on their deity, as well as their alignment.

Druid spells are typically devoted to communing with nature, interpreting or directing the weather, communicating with creatures and plants, and the like. The druid shares some spells with the cleric, such as some healing spells, and has a number of offensive spells which use the power of nature—calling down lightning storms, for example, or summoning wild animals to fight. They also gain special powers such as shapeshifting; but these are not considered spells and do not need to be prepared.

Paladin and ranger spells are similar to cleric and druid spells, respectively, but they are allowed fewer spells per day, only gain access to lower-level spells, and gain access to them more slowly. Both classes have some unique spells that can be fairly powerful, despite their low level. In compensation for their diminished spellcasting ability, paladins and rangers have a more martial focus than clerics and druids.

In 2nd edition, divine spells were divided into 16 thematic spheres, with clerics, druids and specialty priests gaining access to spells from different spheres. The core spheres are All (generic divine spells), Animal, Astral, Charm, Combat, Creation, Divination, Elemental (optionally divided into Air, Earth, Fire and Water sub-spheres), Healing, Necromancy, Plant, Protection, Summon, Sun and Weather. &quot;Tome of Magic&quot; (1991) introduced the Chaos, Numbers, Law, Thought, Time, War and Wards spheres. Spheres were not retained in subsequent editions.

==== Primal magic ====
Primal abilities come from a practitioner harnessing the power of the natural world. In fourth edition, primal magic was used by barbarians, druids, shamans, and wardens. Shannon Appelcline, author of &quot;Designers &amp; Dragons&quot;, commented that &quot;D&amp;D 4e&#x27;s primal power source focuses on transformation: the barbarian rages, the druid wild shapes, and the warden hybridizes. The shaman the only standard build that didn&#x27;t follow this trend; the designers thought that it was complex enough already&quot;.

Primal magic was reintroduced in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; with the One D&amp;D public playtest in August 2022. This outlined that the source of primal magic is &quot;the forces of nature found in the inner planes&quot;. Druids and rangers are the practitioners of primal magic. However, this division was removed in September 2023.

=== Schools of magic ===
There are eight classic schools of magic in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, as originally named in &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;: abjuration, alteration, conjuration, divination, enchantment, illusion, invocation, and necromancy. Each spell belongs to one of eight schools of magic. The ability to specialize in specific schools of magic was formally introduced in the 2nd edition &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (1989) and then greatly expanded on in &quot;The Complete Wizard&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (1990). Jeff Howard, in his book &quot;Game Magic: A Designer&#x27;s Guide to Magic Systems in Theory and Practice&quot;, highlights that the schools of magic do not &quot;necessarily refer to an academic institution for learning and teaching&quot; but rather &quot;schools of magic constitute a taxonomy of reality, in the sense of methodical and ordered classification of the chaos of existence and experience into a structured and order whole. The domains are aspects of existence over which various spells operate&quot;.

In 4th edition, spell schools are initially absent but were reintroduced with the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Essentials&quot; supplement. The spell schools introduced are Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, and Nethermancy (corresponding to the Shadow subschool of the Illusion school from the previous editions). The spells of other classical schools are present in the form of utility spells (like True Seeing being available but not being specifically named a Divination spell) or spell descriptors (like Conjuration or Summoning).

==Other forms of magic==

== Magic in campaign settings ==

=== &quot;Dark Sun&quot; ===

In the &quot;Dark Sun&quot; campaign setting, arcane magic draws its power from the life force of plants or living creatures, with the potential to cause tremendous harm to the environment. Arcane spellcasters may cast spells in a manner that preserves nature, known as preservers, or in a manner that destroys it, known as defilers. However, any arcane caster may choose to defile at any time. As a result, wizards and other arcane casters are despised and must practice in secret. Due to the scarcity of natural resources on the fictional planet Athas, few wizards have access to books made of paper pages and hard covers; instead, they record their spells with string patterns and complex knots. Psionics are extremely common with nearly every living thing having at least a modicum of psionic ability. Unlike arcane magic, psionic abilities are accepted and revered in every strata of Athasian society.

Athas has no deities and no formal religions other than the cults created by the sorcerer-kings. Clerics and druids instead draw power from the Inner Planes/Elemental Chaos. In previous editions, templars (casters who directly serve and derive their powers from the sorcerer-kings) were treated as a specialized form of cleric. In 4th edition, the templar class shifted away from being a divine caster to an arcane caster, though not all templars are skilled in magic. Many templars are not clerics at all but instead warlocks who have pacted with their sorcerer-king and thus are entirely dependent on their patrons for their magical abilities.

=== &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; ===

In the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; campaign setting, the Weave is the source of both arcane and divine spellcasting. Within the context of the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot;, raw magic is characterized as difficult for mortals to access safely. The Weave works to protect the world from the dangers of unrefined magic while giving the ability to cast spells to magic users. Destroying the Weave results in widespread destruction. Reckless use of magic can also damage the Weave, creating areas of dead or wild magic where normal spellcasting doesn&#x27;t work. In ancient Netheril, &quot;Spellcasters are arcanists and do not memorise spells – they merely pluck them out of the weave.&quot; The Weave is present in everything and is part of the goddess Mystra&#x27;s body, who actively willed its effects. The &quot;Sword Coast Adventurer&#x27;s Guide&quot; (2015) states, &quot;in two senses, both the metaphorical and the real, the goddess Mystra is the Weave. She is its keeper and tender, but all three times the goddess of magic has died or been separated from her divinity [...], magic has been twisted or has failed entirely&quot;.

== Spellcasting game mechanics ==
=== Spell levels ===
Spell levels were introduced in the &quot;Volume 1: Men &amp; Magic&quot; (1974) pamphlet where spell levels maxed &quot;out at 6th level for magic-users and 5th level for clerics&quot;. &quot;Supplement I: Greyhawk&quot; (1975), an expansion for &quot;OD&amp;D&quot;, increased the maximum spell level. &quot;Cleric spells were expanded to 7th level and wizards spells to 9th, creating the limits that would be used throughout the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; run of the game&quot;. Spell levels 1-9 became the standard mechanic for each subsequent edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. The 5th edition &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (2014) states that &quot;a spell&#x27;s level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive) magic missile at 1st level and the earth-shaking wish at 9th. [...] The higher a spell&#x27;s level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell&quot;. The upcoming 5th edition &quot;Revised Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (2024) &quot;states that each class has a fixed number of prepared spells (determined based on the player&#x27;s level in a spellcasting class)&quot; which is a change from the 2014 mechanic where the number of prepared spells was &quot;determined by a combination of a specific ability modifier and that player&#x27;s level&quot;.

=== Spell slots ===
Spellcasters can only cast a spell they know or have prepared if they have an available spell slot. This mechanic originated out of the Vancian magic system where &quot;the number of memorized spells is strictly limited by the magician&#x27;s memory capacity in proportion to the spells&#x27; difficulty levels, effectively granting a number of spell slots&quot;. &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; simplified Vance&#x27;s formula &quot;to a number of spell slots scaling with the player character&#x27;s level&quot;. In the 3rd edition, the mechanic to cast a spell was described as a drain on a spellcaster&#x27;s resources which reduces their capacity to cast additional spells. The 5th edition &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (2014) states that &quot;regardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells are even more so. [...] When a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell&#x27;s level or higher, effectively &#x27;filling&#x27; a slot with the spell. [...] Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots&quot;.

===Ritual magic===
The 2nd edition sourcebook &quot;Tome of Magic&quot; (1991) introduced many new variant spell concepts. The cleric class gained access to community-powered spells, cooperatively cast spells, and &quot;super-powerful spells that required a quest before they could be cast&quot;. Most of these new concepts have disappeared since 2nd edition, however, &quot;a few of the quest spells did show up in [3rd edition] as 9th-level priest spells&quot;.

The 3.5 edition sourcebook &quot;Unearthed Arcana&quot; (2004) added optional rules to &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; including variant systems for magic. It expanded on the concept of incantations which were introduced in the d20 System Reference Document as part of the variant magic rules. Incantations were designed to give non-spellcasters access to magic and to give lower level games access to higher level magic. &quot;Unearthed Arcana&quot; states &quot;at its simplest, casting an incantation is akin to preparing and cooking something according to a recipe&quot;. However, there are drawbacks to attempting to cast incantations: they are time-consuming, they require particular circumstances and sometimes multiple casters, the components can be expensive, and there&#x27;s no guarantee the incantation will work successively.

In 4th edition, rituals became a key part of the magic system. Rituals replaced many non-combat spells and had no limitation on how often they could be cast except for time and material resources. &quot;The instructions have to be written down&quot; and could not be cast from memory. Artificers, bards, clerics, druids, invokers, psions, and wizards had ritual casting as a class feature, while other character classes could become ritual casters by selecting the corresponding feat.

In 5th edition, rituals continued to be a key part of spell casting. Some spells have the ritual tag which means that the &quot;spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal. It also doesn&#x27;t expend a spell slot, which means the ritual version of a spell can&#x27;t be cast at a higher level&quot;. Similar to 4th edition, some character classes, such as the cleric, druid, and wizard classes, were automatically ritual casters. Other characters could become ritual casters by picking up a specific feat or subclass feature. Unlike 4th edition, the caster must &quot;have the spell prepared [on their] list of spells known, unless the character&#x27;s ritual feature specifies otherwise, as the wizard&#x27;s does&quot;.

===Components===
The casting of spells within &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; often requires the mage to do, say, or use something in order for the spell to work. Spells may require a verbal, somatic, or material component or a magical focus. These actions are performed by the fictional character in the game, not by the player in the real world. The player may simply state what the character does, or may embellish with sound effects or gestures to enhance the theatrics of the game. In 4th edition, spell components were eliminated as a mechanic. Flavor text for some spells and prayers mention words, gestures or objects, however this is purely cosmetic. Although 4th edition eliminated the component mechanic for spells, most rituals require material components, some rituals require foci and many spells and prayers benefit from magical implements. In 5th edition, spells may require a verbal, somatic, or material component.

== Sample spells ==

The following is a sampling of spells featured in multiple &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; iterations.

===Arcane spells===

*&quot;Color Spray&quot;: A vivid cone of clashing colors springs forth from the caster&#x27;s hand, causing creatures to become stunned, perhaps also blinded, and possibly even knocking them unconscious.
*&quot;Darkvision&quot;: The subject gains the ability to see clearly (albeit in black and white) in total darkness.
*&quot;Feather Fall&quot;: The affected creatures or objects fall slowly; at a feather rate. Feather fall instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to a mere 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet), and the subjects take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. However, when the spell duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes.
*&quot;Fireball&quot;: A tiny ball flies forward from the caster, exploding in a huge fireball at a point designated by the caster. While an extremely potent spell, the caster must take care to avoid catching allies in the explosion, or to accidentally strike an obstruction and detonate the spell early.
*&quot;Flesh to Stone&quot;: The subject, along with all its carried gear, is turned into a mindless, inert, stone statue. If the statue resulting from this spell is broken or damaged, the subject (if ever returned to its original state) has similar damage or deformities. (See also: Petrification)
*&quot;Invisibility&quot;: The target of this spell becomes invisible for a time, but immediately becomes visible if they attack a person or creature or casts another spell.
*&quot;Magic Missile&quot;: A bolt of pure energy from the caster&#x27;s fingertips. It strikes a target automatically, with multiple missiles launched at higher levels. The spell&#x27;s ability to cause automatic damage makes it one of the most-used spells. In the initial release of 4th edition, &quot;magic missile&quot; required an attack roll. The July 2010 update changed this back to an automatic hit, albeit with a lower amount of damage.
*&quot;Meteor Swarm&quot;: Four meteors fly forward and explode like Fireballs. One of the most destructive spells in the game, capable of rending castles or devastating entire armies.
*&quot;Polymorph&quot;: Transforms a target into another creature of the caster&#x27;s choosing, such as an ogre, a small giant or the like. In some editions, polymorph is divided into several spells, for example, in 3rd edition, it is divided into Polymorph Self, which can only target the caster, and Polymorph Other, a higher level spell which can affect other targets, while in 3.5 edition, it is divided into Polymorph, which can only affect a willing target, and the higher level Baleful Polymorph, can transform an unwilling target into a weaker form, such as a frog.
*&quot;Scrying&quot;: Allows the caster to spy on someone from a distance.
*&quot;Summon Monster&quot;: Summons a single extraplanar creature or several weaker extraplanar creatures. Most of the creatures are animals with the celestial creature template, although elementals and other creatures unique to other planes are also available. In 3rd edition, there is a distinct Summon Monster spell, differentiated by a Roman numeral, for each of the nine spell levels, with higher level spells summoning more powerful monsters. In 5th edition, there are 17 spells with the summoning tag and summoning is broken up creature type. &quot;Tasha&#x27;s Cauldron of Everything&quot; is adds nine additional summon monster spells (from such as aberration and shadowspawn) that were originally part of the Unearthed Arcana playtest.
*&quot;Teleport&quot;: Allows the caster to instantly appear somewhere else in the world, though at lower levels this ability can be somewhat imprecise.
*&quot;Time Stop&quot;: Allows the caster to manipulate the flow of time, giving them few extra moments to act when time is &quot;stopped&quot; for everyone (and everything) else.
*&quot;Wish&quot;: The mightiest of all non-epic spells a wizard or sorcerer can cast. Bending reality, the caster can change the events of the past few minutes, create an object from nothing, emulate another spell or create practically any effect they can imagine. However, casting the spell has a considerable cost, which varied between editions. In 1st and 2nd edition &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;, casting Wish causes the caster to age several years. In 3rd and 3.5 editions, this spell drains the caster of experience points. In 5th edition, using the spell for anything other than duplicating a spell of 8th level or lower causes serious arcane stress, severely weakening the caster for between 2 and 8 days and a 33 percent chance of leaving them unable to cast Wish ever again. Though the wish can technically fulfill any desire, there are set limitations as to what can be wished for without consequence. Dungeon Masters are often encouraged to interpret a player&#x27;s wish as literally as possible, particularly for selfish or greedy wishes (or any other wish that exceeds the set boundaries for &quot;safe&quot; wishes). For example, if someone wished for a fortune in gold, the DM could grant the wish by appropriating a local king&#x27;s treasury, making the wisher a target for retaliation. Or, if somebody wished to live forever, they could end up being trapped in a timeless extradimensional space. Thus, the wisher must be very careful upon using the spell.

=== Divine spells ===
*&quot;Cure light wounds&quot;: A basic healing spell available to clerics, druids, bards, paladins, and rangers. &quot;Cure critical wounds&quot; is a more powerful healing spell available only to clerics, druids, and bards. In 5th edition, there is only one &quot;Cure wounds&quot; spell with Mass Cure Wounds simply extending the original spell to up to 6 creatures within a thirty-foot radius.
*&quot;Detect evil&quot;: The caster is able to tell if someone or something they look at is evil. Other versions of this spell exist for the various other alignment components, such as good, lawful, and chaotic.
*&quot;Raise dead&quot;: The power to revive a deceased character, as long as their remains are roughly whole and have not deteriorated beyond a certain point. In some editions, the character being revived will lose enough experience points to drop their most recent class level. More potent versions of this spell include &quot;resurrection&quot;, which needs only a fragment of the body, and &quot;true resurrection&quot;, which doesn&#x27;t need the body at all and can be performed many years after the character&#x27;s death.
*&quot;Miracle&quot;: This is the Divine equivalent of &quot;wish.&quot; It essentially calls upon the cleric&#x27;s deity to perform an epic miracle, such as resurrecting an entire army or lifting a massive curse. Unlike wish, it may or may not come at a high cost of experience points, depending on the miracle requested. The miracle-granting deity is typically more forgiving of its followers&#x27; requests than the &quot;wish&quot; spell is, but this can change depending on the deity&#x27;s alignment and the specific miracle being requested.
*&quot;Summon Nature&#x27;s Ally&quot;: This Druid spell can summon one creature or several weaker creatures. It is similar to the arcane Summon Monster spells (which Clerics can also cast as Divine spells), and like Summon Monster there is a variant of Summon Nature&#x27;s Ally for each spell level. Summon Nature&#x27;s Ally differs from Summon Monster in the kind of creatures it is capable of summoning. Most of the available creatures are animals, although elementals, magical beasts and fey are also available. In 5th edition, druids, rangers and some bards have access to the spell now known as &quot;Conjure Woodland Beings.&quot;
*&quot;Stick to Snakes&quot;: Allows a cleric to turn a pile of sticks into snakes.

<text>Lovin&#x27; Molly is a 1974 American drama film directed by Sidney Lumet and starring Anthony Perkins, Beau Bridges, Blythe Danner in the title role, Ed Binns, and Susan Sarandon. The film is based on Larry McMurtry&#x27;s second novel, &quot;Leaving Cheyenne&quot; (1963). Prior to release, the film was also known as &quot;Molly, Gid, and Johnny&quot; and &quot;The Wild and The Sweet&quot;.

==Plot==
Over a span of nearly 40 years, Gid and Johnny, a pair of Texas farm boys, compete for the affections of Molly Taylor, a free spirit who cares for both of them. The story is told in three consecutive segments, each narrated by one of the three lead roles.

The first segment is set in 1925 and narrated by Gid, who introduces himself as well as his best friend Johnny and Johnny&#x27;s girlfriend Molly Taylor with whom Gid becomes smitten. Gid works part-time as a ranch hand at Molly&#x27;s farm and often competes against Johnny for Molly&#x27;s affections. Despite their frequent feud and arguments, Gid and Johnny&#x27;s friendship never ends during their excursions and errands for Molly&#x27;s father to sell and buy cattle for the family farm. Molly eventually sleeps with Gid, as well as Johnny, but she eventually chooses neither one of them and instead marries school friend Eddie after the death of her father. Gid eventually marries Sarah, a local widow with several children, and Johnny leaves town for places unknown.

The second segment is set in 1945 and is narrated by Molly. It was revealed that Molly had three sons from her three different suitors, and each one of them died in combat during World War II which is currently waging. Molly&#x27;s husband Eddie also died from an illness several years before. Gid had divorced Sarah and began spending most of his free time with Molly, who withheld the news of their son&#x27;s death in battle. When he finally did learn the news, Gid took it badly and became more depressed. Johnny re-entered their lives after living away and, having married and divorced his own wife, took a more active part in helping Molly run her late father&#x27;s farm.

The third and final segment is set in 1964 and is narrated by Johnny. He reveals that Gid is in a local hospital dying from cancer and Johnny has been keeping a bedside vigil over him. Wanting out of the place, Johnny takes Gid away from the hospital for a few days to visit Molly who is still living at her father&#x27;s farm and is contemplating selling it. After working with Johnny around the farm to relive their &quot;good old days&quot; long gone by, Gid passes away as Johnny is driving him back to the hospital. After Gid&#x27;s funeral, Johnny meets with Molly where they agree that, despite never getting married or having a life in operating her family farm, they will always be soul mates, before Johnny leaves Molly for the last time.

==Production==
===Development===
Larry McMurtry&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Horseman Pass By&quot; had been turned into a successful 1963 film, &quot;Hud&quot;. In March 1966 &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; reported the film rights to &quot;Leaving Cheyenne&quot;, McMurtry&#x27;s second novel, were purchased by Warner Bros for producer William Conrad, with Larry Marcus to write the script. McMurtry later says Warners wanted to call the film &quot;Gid&quot;, after the lead character Gideon, to cash in on the success of the movie &quot;Hud&quot;. The writer recalls, &quot;Something like seven scripts ensued, one of them done by Robert Altman, another of them nursed along for years by Don Siegel. Insidiously unfilmic, the book resisted all but the most foolhardy efforts to drag it onto celluloid, until, in 1974, it finally succumbed to the abundantly foolhardy efforts of Stephen Friedman and Sidney Lumet and appeared as &quot;Lovin&#x27; Molly&quot;&quot;.

In June 1969 it was announced Don Siegel would produce a version of the book in Oklahoma, with filming to start in October 1969. However this did not proceed.

Film rights were eventually obtained by Stephen Friedman, a lawyer who had moved into producing with the 1971 film version of McMurtry&#x27;s &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot;. (Friedman appears to have bought them off Universal Studios, who got them from Warner Bros.) Friedman was an admirer of &quot;Leaving Cheyenne&quot; calling it &quot;full of extraordinary insights into people&quot;. He particularly appreciated how &quot;the men have to adapt to the women in the story. Usually it&#x27;s the other way around.&quot;

Friedman had not been involved in the writing or casting of &quot;Last Picture Show&quot;. He decided to adapt &quot;Leaving Cheyenne&quot; into a screenplay himself. He said that despite the success of &quot;Last Picture Show&quot; at the box office he had as much trouble raising finance for &quot;Leaving Cheyenne&quot; as he did for &quot;Picture Show&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s still difficult to convince the industry that films about love and humanity and people will be as grabbing as lustful, violent action drama,&quot; he said. Finance was eventually raised independenly although Columbia Pictures - which had made &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; - later picked up the film for release.

Friedman said the title was changed from &quot;Leaving Cheyenne&quot; after &quot;we took a survey and found that most people expected it to be a Western. It&#x27;s about people and we didn&#x27;t want to attract people that wanted a simple action movie and got a sensitive drama.&quot;

Friedman says Sidney Lumet was the third director he approached to make the film. &quot;He doesn&#x27;t like to typecast he likes to cast people in the opposite of their type,&quot; said Friedman. &quot;It&#x27;s a challenge to him, it&#x27;s a challenge to the performer. That&#x27;s the kind of concern I was looking for in this picture. It was set in Texas but could have happened anywhere. The people are more important than the film&quot;

At one stage the filmmakers considered using three different actors to play the characters during three different timelines but eventually decided to use the same actors and make up. (Friedman later said the film should have just used two timelines.)

In an interview with one of the actors in the film, Paul Partain (better known for his role in &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot;) described the origins of the film:When Sidney [Lumet] and producer Stephen J. Friedman got into town, they came with what they hoped would be the perfect formula for success. It had worked on &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot;, and they knew it would work here. It was this: get a Larry McMurtry novel, hire your three lead actors from Hollywood, get a great director, pick up all the rest of the actors and the crew from the local pool and you were set. Great plan, and it almost worked ...

===Shooting===
Female star Blythe Danner started rehearsing for the movie twelve days after having given birth to her daughter Gwyneth Paltrow.

Filming started on November 6, 1972 under the working title &quot;Molly, Gid and Johnny&quot; in Bastrop, Texas. The unit stayed at Bastrop until December 8, after which there was two weeks of filming on a set in New York.

The filming was witnessed by a Texan journalist who later wrote a 1974 &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; article about it. Lumet directed this film during a span when his &quot;Serpico&quot;, &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot;, &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot;, &quot;Network&quot; and &quot;Equus&quot; were nominated for a combined 27 Academy Awards. McMurtry has claimed to have hated the movie as it wasn&#x27;t very true to his book and says that it &quot;just about killed his father.&quot;

Lumet said:
There were so many problems with that film! First, I should have taken a year to prepare it, because I wasn’t at all familiar with life down South. I should have researched it more. It was an independent film, with little financing, so we had to shoot quickly, and that’s why the makeup, for example, is not all that convincing. Anyway, it was a failure, due in great part to my haste.
McMurtry felt Lumet&#x27;s &quot;indifference to locale was so total that one is sorry he was put to the anguish of uprooting himself from home and hearth for even the few short weeks he could bring himself to stay in Texas.&quot; He added &quot;indifference to detail, on the scale to which it is evident in &quot;Lovin&#x27; Molly&quot;, adds up to indifference to substance.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;a misguided, heavy-handed attempt to span 40 years in the lives of three Texas rustics and their bizarre but homey menage a trois. Despite some good performances, pic just doesn&#x27;t work, and b.o. prospects are dim... If the basic concept is arguably unfilmable, Lumet’s execution of it is haphazard. Early sequences are surprisingly sloppy (mismatched shots etc.) and overall direction is lacklustre.&quot;

Kevin Thomas of &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Perkins is expressive and incisive in one of the richest roles he&#x27;s ever had&quot; but felt the film &quot;leaves one with the impression that we&#x27;d be better off having read McMurtry&#x27;s book.&quot;

&quot;Sight and Sound&quot; wrote, &quot;Imagine &quot;Jules and Jim&quot; transplanted to rural Texas, with destructive Catherine replaced by constructive Molly, and you arrive at the thematic basis of this adaptation... Unlikely as it sounds, Anthony Perkins, Beau Bridges and Blythe Danner as the lovable trio come dangerously close to making it work.&quot;

Jonathan Rosenbaum, in &quot; Monthly Film Bulletin&quot;, called the movie:
A kind of rural &quot;Carnal Knowledge&quot;, with the lives of three characters split into discrete and isolated episodes from which the physical fact of their environment is virtually stripped away. (The film was shot on location, but for all that Sidney Lumet makes of the terrain, he might as well have used a sound stage.) To compound difficulties, we have three evidently urban actors out to impersonate country folk... straining after verisimilitude and continuity all along the way. And yet... the film gets away with a lot more than one would have any right to expect... the cumulative impact of the three leads often persuades one to forget the quaint precocity of the material with which they are working. 
In a 1975 review of the film &quot;Hearts of the West&quot; Pauline Kael referred to &quot;Lovin&#x27; Molly&quot; which she called &quot;crudely made, but there were suggestive spaces in it - you couldn’t tie it all up. Danner’s full-blown, straightforward Molly, who didn’t worry about being conventional, because conventions meant nothing to her, was like a Hardy heroine — Eustacia Vye, or Tess — growing up in Texas. I thought Blythe Danner was going to become a great movie star, but &quot;Lovin’ Molly&quot; got measly distribution and vanished, and stars aren’t made by flop movies.&quot;

Critic Danny Peary wrote, &quot;Film reputedly has a cult following, but I have never come across a true fan. However, if you’re a Blythe Danner fan and consequently regret that she didn’t make it as a ticket-selling leading lady, this is the picture that proves she had the beauty and talent to have been a star if she’d been promoted properly.&quot;

<doc id="930910" wikidata="Q1139546" url="?curid=930910" title="Paneer">
<text>Paneer (), is a fresh acid-set cheese, common in cuisine of South Asia, made from cow milk or buffalo milk. It is a non-aged, non-melting soft cheese made by curdling milk with a fruit- or vegetable-derived acid, such as lemon juice.

Paneer was predominantly used in most north Indian dishes and is now commonly used throughout India due to its versatility as an ingredient in diverse dishes.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;paneer&quot; entered English from the Hindi-Urdu term &quot;panīr&quot;, which comes from Persian () &#x27;cheese&#x27;, which comes from Old Iranian. Armenian (), Azerbaijani , Bengali &quot;ponir&quot; (পনির), Turkish and Turkmen , all derived from Persian , also refer to cheese of any type.

==History==

The origin of paneer is debated. Ancient Indian, Afghan, Iranian and Portuguese origins have been proposed for paneer.

Legends about Krishna make several references to milk, butter, ghee and dahi (yogurt), but do not mention sour milk cheese. According to Arthur Berriedale Keith, a kind of cheese is &quot;perhaps referred to&quot; in Rigveda 6.48.18. However, Otto Schrader (1890) believes that the Rigveda only mentions &quot;a skin of sour milk, not cheese in the proper sense&quot;. Vedic literature refers to a substance that is interpreted by some authors, such as K. T. Achaya, Om Prakash and Sanjeev Kapoor, as a possible form of paneer, but without definitive evidence.

Catherine Donnelly, author of &quot;The Oxford Companion to Cheese&quot; (2016), mentions that Vedic literature refers to cheese production made with the aid of barks of palash tree (&quot;Butea monosperma&quot;), fruits like jujube (&quot;Ziziphus mauritiana&quot;) and creeper like putika with coagulating enzymes, &quot;as well as Dadhanvat, a cheese-like substance made with and without pores&quot;. According to Catherine Donnelly, these plant substances may have contained rennet-like enzymes and notes that the &quot;Vedas may include some of the earliest known references to rennet-coagulated cheeses&quot;. &quot;Lokopakara&quot; text dated to the 10th century gives two recipes for coagulated cheeses made from buffalo milk for making sweets using plants and roots. According to the text, buffalo milk was coagulated using roots of amaranth plant or leaves of marsh barbel (&quot;Hygrophila auriculata&quot;); the soft cheese produced in this manner was called &quot;Haluvuga&quot;. In the second recipe, buffalo milk was coagulated with Indian mallow (&quot;Abutilon indicum&quot;) or country mallow (&quot;Sida cordifolia&quot;) and was made into balls for sweets. &quot;Manasollasa&quot;, a Sanskrit-language text by the 12th-century king Someshvara III, describes &quot;Kshiraprakara&quot;, a similar sweet food prepared from milk solids after separating boiled milk using buttermilk.

Another theory is that like the word itself, paneer originated in Persianate lands and spread to the Indian subcontinent under Muslim rule. Paneer, according to this theory, was developed and moulded to suit local tastes under these rulers, and the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire are when paneer as currently known developed. Another theory states that paneer is Afghan in origin and spread to India from the lands that make up Afghanistan. National Dairy Research Institute states that paneer was introduced into India by Afghan and Iranian invaders. Based on texts such as &quot;Charaka Samhita&quot;, BN Mathur wrote that the earliest evidence of a heat-acid coagulated milk product in India can be traced to 75–300 CE, in the Kushan-Satavahana era. Sunil Kumar &quot;et al&quot;.(2011) interpret this product as the present-day paneer. According to them, paneer is indigenous to the north-western part of South Asia and was introduced in India by Afghan and Iranian travellers.

Another theory is that the Portuguese may have introduced the technique of &quot;breaking&quot; milk with acid to Bengal in the 17th century. Thus, according to this theory, Indian acid-set cheeses such as paneer and chhena were first prepared in Bengal, under Portuguese influence. A type of smoked cheese called Bandel cheese was introduced by the Portuguese in Bengal, which is distinct from paneer.

==Nutrition and preparation==
Paneer is prepared by adding food acid, such as lemon juice, vinegar, citric acid or dahi (yogurt), to hot milk to separate the curds from the whey. The curds are drained in muslin or cheesecloth and the excess water is pressed out. The resulting paneer is dipped in chilled water for 2–3 hours to improve its texture and appearance. From this point, the preparation of paneer diverges based on its use and regional tradition.

In north Indian cuisines, the curds are wrapped in cloth, placed under a heavy weight such as a stone slab for two to three hours, and then cut into cubes for use in curries. Pressing for a shorter time (approximately 20 minutes) results in a softer, fluffier cheese.

In Bengali, Odia and other East Indian cuisines, the chhena are beaten or kneaded by hand into a dough-like consistency, heavily salted and hardened to produce paneer (called &quot;ponir&quot;), which is typically eaten in slices at teatime with biscuits or various types of bread, deep-fried in a light batter or used in cooking.

In the area surrounding the city of Surat in Gujarat, &quot;surti paneer&quot; is made by draining the curds and ripening them in whey for 12 to 36 hours.

==Use in dishes==
Paneer is the most common type of cheese used in traditional cuisines from the Indian subcontinent. It is sometimes wrapped in dough and deep-fried or served with either spinach (palak paneer) or peas (mattar paneer). Paneer dishes can be sweet, like shahi paneer, or spicy/hot, like chilli paneer.

===Paneer dishes===
Some paneer recipes include:
* Paneer pulao (paneer with rice)
* Mattar paneer (paneer with peas)
* Shahi paneer (paneer cooked in a rich Mughlai curry)
* Paneer tikka (a vegetarian version of chicken tikka, paneer placed on skewers and roasted)
* Paneer tikka masala
* Chilli paneer (an Indo-Chinese preparation with spicy chilies, onions and green peppers, usually served dry and garnished with spring onions)
* Kadai Paneer
* Paneer pakora (paneer fritters)
* Palak paneer
* Khoya paneer
* Paneer momo
* Paneer butter masala 
* Paneer pasanda (shallow-fried stuffed paneer sandwiches in a smooth, creamy onion-tomato based gravy)
* Paneer lababdar
* Paneer Do Pyaza (named so because twice the normal amount of onions are used in this recipe).

==Similar cheeses==
Anari, a fresh mild whey cheese produced in Cyprus, is very similar in taste and texture to fresh Indian paneer. Circassian cheese is produced using a similar method and is close in consistency to paneer, but is usually salted. Farmer cheese (pressed curds) and firm versions of quark are similar except that they are made from cultured milk and may be salted. Although many South Asians translate &quot;paneer&quot; into &quot;cottage cheese&quot;, cottage cheese is made using rennet extracted from the stomach of ruminants, and cow&#x27;s skim milk. Queso blanco or queso fresco are often recommended as substitutes in the Americas and Spain as they are more commercially available in many American markets. Queso blanco can be a closer match, as it is acid-set while queso fresco frequently uses rennet at a lower temperature. Both are generally salted, unlike paneer. It is also similar to unsalted halloumi.

<doc id="930917" wikidata="Q352113" url="?curid=930917" title="Yoshiaki Tsutsumi">
<text>is a Japanese businessman. During the Japanese economic bubble, &quot;Forbes&quot; listed Tsutsumi as the wealthiest person in the world during 1987–94 due to his extensive real estate investments through the Seibu Corporation, which he controlled. In 1987, he had a net worth of $20 billion (approximately $ in today&#x27;s value). However, as a result of a series of scandals and his 2005 arrest, his net worth has fallen to such an extent that he was taken off the &quot;Forbes&quot; list of billionaires in 2007.

==Early life==
Tsutsumi was born May 29, 1934, to businessman Yasujirō Tsutsumi and his mistress Ishizaka Tsuneko. He was one of Yasujirō&#x27;s seven children, and spent his childhood in a Tokyo suburb with Tsuneko and his two younger brothers, Yasuhiro and Yuji. When he was around 7 years old, he met his then-14-year-old half-brother Seiji Tsutsumi; the two were said to have an immediate disdain for each other.

Tsutsumi was said to have inherited his father&#x27;s personality; he claimed to have begun assisting his father&#x27;s business in elementary school, beginning with simple tasks like holding blueprints. Though his father subjected him to physical discipline, Tsutsumi was said to be his favorite—something that gained him significant corporate and political influence.

Tsutsumi graduated from Waseda University in 1957.

==Business and sports career==
Tsutsumi made his earliest forays into business as a university student: in 1956, he opened the Karuizawa Skate Center in Nagano. Upon graduating in 1957, he was employed by Kokudo Keikaku Kogyo (later Kokudo Corporation), of which his father was the chairman.

In April 1964, Tsutsumi&#x27;s father Yasujirō died. Despite the disagreement of his widow Masao, the thirty-year-old Yoshiaki Tsutsumi inherited control of the Seibu Corporation. Most observers had expected the designated successor to be his elder half-brother Seiji Tsutsumi, who instead inherited the Seibu department stores. Though Seiji subsequently parlayed these stores into the Credit Saison empire, the perceived rivalry between the two brothers&#x27; fiefdoms provided fodder for the popular press.

As chairman, Tsutsumi focused on developing and expanding the vast land holdings inherited from his father. At one point, his companies were believed to own one-sixth of all the land in Japan.

A significant portion of Tsutsumi&#x27;s business ventures went towards sports: he served as chairman of the Japan Ice Hockey Federation and owned the Seibu Tetsudo hockey club. Though he reportedly did not have much knowledge of baseball, 1979 saw his purchase of the Seibu Lions baseball team and the construction of a new stadium in the greater Tokyo area. He later served as the first chairman of the Japan Olympic Committee, resigning in 1990, after less than a year. Despite his resignation, he continued to exert significant control over the committee by selecting future chairmen, which effectively prevented his opponents from serving in the position.

Tsutsumi&#x27;s total net worth has been unclear, as it is unknown how much he owned in assets: he almost always refused interviews, and did not permit Seibu spokespeople to reveal company information.

===1998 Winter Olympics===
When Nagano bid to host the 1998 Winter Olympics, Tsutsumi—then head of the Japan Olympic Committee—used his financial and political influence, as well as a connection to the International Olympic Committee president, to give Nagano an edge on the bid. He continued to work with them even after stepping down from the committee, and has been cited by former Japan Olympic Committee members as the reason for Nagano&#x27;s successful bid.

The decision to host the Winter Olympics in Nagano was heavily criticized by environmentalist groups, noting that the construction of the ski runs necessitated the removal of forestry, and the ski runs themselves infringed upon protected land. Also criticized was the financial conflict of interest: many of the businesses in the region were owned by Seibu.

===Honors===
For contributions to international ice hockey, Tsutsumi was inducted into the builder category of the International Ice Hockey Federation Hall of Fame in 1999.

==Suspicions of insider trading and arrest==

The January 17, 2005 edition of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; made an investigation on Tsutsumi and the Seibu Corporation public to English readers. According to the paper, the Seibu corporation&#x27;s headquarters were raided by police, who allegedly found evidence of several Japanese business law-breaking incidents. The police, for example, claimed that the company declared that their major shareholders accounted only for 64 percent of the company&#x27;s shareholders, but that, in reality, the major shareholders at Seibu actually owned 88 percent of the company&#x27;s shares. Such bogus ownership statement is suspected to be illegal falsification. Major shareholders can only get up to 80 percent of a Japanese company&#x27;s stock to be listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
That scandal was originally opened in 2002 in Japan, after which Tsutsumi was ordered by a court out of the company, but he remained in it, although at a much less paid employment.

While multiple Seibu employees were involved in the scandal, Tsutsumi was considered the ringleader, as a result of position in the company and his authoritarian management style.

On March 3, 2005, Tsutsumi was arrested on suspicion of violation of securities trading law. Tsutsumi pleaded guilty, and on October 27, 2005, the Tokyo District Court sentenced him to 30 months in prison, suspended for 4 years, and a fine of 5 million yen. His suspended sentence expired in October 2009 and he remains indirectly a major shareholder in Seibu Holdings.

Seibu Corporation later sought legal action against Tsutsumi. The parties reached a settlement in 2016, with Seibu receiving ¥25.6 billion.

<doc id="930923" wikidata="Q1666311" url="?curid=930923" title="Music of Zambia">
<text>The music of [[Zambia]] has a rich heritage which falls roughly into categories of traditional, popular and Christian music.

== Traditional Music ==
Traditional Zambian music is rooted in the beliefs and practices of Zambia&#x27;s various ethnic groups and has suffered some decline in the last three decades. Traditional Zambian music once had clear ritual purposes or was an expression of the social fabric of the culture. Songs were used to teach, to heal, to appeal to spirits, and for mere enjoyment. Despite the decline of traditional music, its influences can still be heard in many of today&#x27;s Zambian musical forms. The ubiquitous African &quot;call-and-response&quot; can be heard in almost every Zambian song no matter what the style. Traditional drum rhythms and polymeters are evident in many different kinds of Zambian music. Contemporary popular forms such as Zambian &quot;Kalindula&quot; also exhibit traces of traditional music in the finger-picking style used by guitarists.

===Instruments===
Traditional Zambian instruments include a variety of membranophones, both stick-struck and hand-struck. Drums are essential for most traditional dances. &quot;Ngoma&quot; is the generic central Bantu term for drum but Zambian drums come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and purposes and have specific names depending on their tribal origins and functional roles. The &quot;Budima&quot; drums of the Valley Tonga, for example, are used specifically for funeral ceremonies. &quot;Budima&quot; drums have a goblet shape and come in sizes ranging from large to small. One of the most interesting of drums is the so-called &quot;lion drum&quot; (&quot;Namalwa&quot; in Tonga) used at traditional funerals. This is a friction drum which is not struck at all but which has a stick inserted through the drum head that is rubbed. The silimba is a large 17-note xylophone from Western Province.

Chordophones and aerophones are less common in traditional Zambian music but exist nonetheless. The Valley Tonga play instruments made from animal horns called &quot;Nyeele&quot;. &quot;Nyeele&quot; are played using an interlocking technique with individual musicians each playing a single horn and interlocking with other musicians who have &quot;Nyeele&quot; of different pitches. A chordophone called a &quot;kalumbu&quot; was traditionally played by young men to signal their desire to marry. Called a &#x27;musical bow&#x27; by ethnomusicologists because of its bow shape, the &quot;kalumbu&quot; is struck by a stick. Like many other central African countries, Zambia once had a vibrant tradition of so-called &quot;thumb pianos,&quot; each with a different name depending on tribal origins: the Tonga &quot;kankobela&quot; is one such thumb piano, the Mbunda &quot;kathandi&quot;, the Lozi &quot;kangombio&quot;, the Lunda &quot;chisanzhi&quot;, the Nsenga &quot;kalimba&quot;, etc. Although the use of traditional instruments has declined in recent years, they can still be heard in rural areas of Zambia.

Recordings of traditional Zambian music were made in the mid-twentieth century by Hugh Tracey and Arthur Morris Jones, both well-known ethnomusicologists of African music. Tracey recorded all over Zambia in the 1950s, but also specifically recorded in the Zambezi Valley in 1958 at the request of anthropologist Elizabeth Colson before the creation of the Kariba Dam and Jones did his at Mapanza in Zambia&#x27;s Southern Province. Catholic missionaries, J. J. Corbeil and Frank Wafer have also contributed to our knowledge of traditional Zambian music. Father Corbeil collected and documented the instrumental tradition of the Bemba in Northeastern Zambia. Frank Wafer, a Jesuit priest located at Chikuni, has collected and preserved Batonga music. A community radio station dedicated to promoting Batonga music and culture is also part of the Chikuni Mission Station. They organize an annual festival of Batonga music which attracts as many as 10,000 visitors according to the organizers. Recent ethnomusicological work has been done by native Zambians such as Mwesa Isaiah Mapoma, Joseph Ng&#x27;andu, John Anderson Mwesa and others. Recent field recordings made by native Zambian Michael Baird in Southern Province have been released on his SWP label, as well as producing two excellent compilations of Zambian hits from the 60s, 70s and 80s.

== Popular Music ==
After independence in 1964, the most important source of popular music was the Zambia National Broadcasting Service and affiliated bands like Lusaka Radio Band who soon changed their name to The Big Gold Six. Record companies soon formed, with most recordings made at Peter Msungilo&#x27;s DB Studios in Lusaka, and records pressed in Ndola by the Teal Record Company.

The northern, copper-producing area of Zambia was known for singers like John Lushi, William Mapulanga and Stephen Tsotsi Kasumali. Their guitar-based music grew gradually into Zamrock, which used mostly English lyrics in rock songs. Bands included the Machine-Gunners and Musi-o-tunya. The most popular band in Zambian history soon emerged, Jaggari Chanda&#x27;s Witch.

In the late 1970s, President Kenneth Kaunda ordered that 95% of the music on the radio had to be Zambian. He hoped to encourage the formation of a Zambian national identity. Rather than using their folk roots, however, Zambians attempted to become pop stars. By the mid-1980s, the result was kalindula music. Bands included the Masasu Band, Serenje Kalindula and Junior Mulemena Boys. Amayenge is considered one of the best kalindula bands of the past twenty years. Another top artist is Brian Chilala who, together with his band Ngoma Zasu, continues in the electric kalindula tradition. An annual concert of traditional bands (not just kalindula) was recently begun by the Chikuni Radio station in Chikuni in the Southern Province. Two of the most popular bands from that festival are Green Mamba and Mashombe Blue Jeans. In addition, artists such as Alfred Chisala Kalusha Jr. based their compositions on &quot;Imfukutu&quot; - Bemba folk music.

In the 1990s, economic problems caused the collapse of the Zambian music industry. Unfettered by rules promoting Zambian music, the airwaves were covered with imported ragga and reggae from Jamaica and hip hop and R&amp;B from the United States.

The most successful record label currently operating in Zambia is Romaside entertainment, Sling beats, Blaza, G-sounds, Alpha Entertainment and X.Y.Z Entertainment. Their stable of artists includes J.K., Slap Dee, Macky 2, Chef 187, joe chibangu, Jay Brown (Son of the most High), hamoba, Ty2, Bobby East, Zone fam and Jay Roxer, J.o.b, Stevo, Muzo aka Alfonso, Petersen, Izreal, Corta Nac City, Danny, Shatel, Black Muntu, pilato, Mampi, Tommy Dee, South African based chilu lemba and the Algerian based rapper T.I.D.Y and not forgetting the Pylot African Sun. Sound clips of each of these groups can be heard at their website (see below). The Zambian entertainment industry recognizes popular musicians such as these at its annual Ngoma Awards. The Ngoma Awards amount to a Zambian version of the all-Africa Kora Awards. At the moment K&#x27;Millian, Macky 2, Slap dee, Chef 187 are the very popular artists.
A unique hybrid form of Zambian music is found in the so-called &quot;banjo&quot; tradition. The Zambian &quot;banjo&quot; (pronounced &#x27;bahn-jo&#x27;) is essentially a homemade guitar. A wide variety of such instruments can be found in different sizes and with varying numbers of strings. Most are played using a two or three finger picking style and the tuning of each instrument is unique to that instrument. The body is made in various shapes from wood or sometimes tin cans, and the strings or &#x27;wires&#x27; often come from discarded radial tires. Zambian banjos are used in kalindula bands throughout Zambia.

==Christian Music==
Popular influences can also be heard in the newer repertory, some of which is borrowed from urban contemporary gospel, some from so-called &quot;contemporary Christian music&quot; from the United States, and some from Zambian popular idioms. The use of electronic synthesizers and guitars has also made its way into the church. The flow of influence between church music and the popular realm can also be heard in recordings by groups such as Lumbani Madoda, Zambian Acapella, Lota House and Hosanna Band which has been disbanded.

The influence of Euro-American hymnody is also evident in the music of many Zambian congregations. Hymns from British and American hymnals continue to be part of the musical fabric of many churches, and many harmonic practices are derived from Western hymn influences. Invented by John Curwen, the system Tonic Sol-fa was imported into Africa by the British in the nineteenth century. The Heritage Singers Choir, the Heritage Brothers Quartet, and church helped popularise this form of harmonious music worldwide.

<text>Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri (Urdu: خورشيد محمود قصورى; born 18 June 1941), is a Pakistani politician and writer who served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan between November 2002 until November 2007. He is the Senior Advisor on Political and International Affairs and Chairman of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf&#x27;s Task Force on Kashmir and a member of the Core Committee of the Party. He is also the author of &#x27;Neither a Hawk Nor a Dove&#x27;.

He was born in Lahore, Punjab. After getting educated at the Punjab University, Kasuri later studied law at Cambridge and was subsequently admitted as a barrister at the Gray&#x27;s Inn. He also went on to study French at Nice. He started his political career with the Tehreek-e-Istaqlal (TI) led by Air-Marshal Muhammad Asghar Khan. The TI was then the main opposition party. He rose to be its Secretary-General. He was also elected as the Secretary-General of the main opposition alliance, the Pakistan Democratic Alliance in 1993. He went to prison on several occasions when Bhutto and General Zia ul Haq were in power for his opposition to both. He was elected to the National Assembly in 1997 and 2002. He was elected as Chairman of the Standing Committee on Information and Media Development. He staunchly opposed the 15th Amendment to the Constitution (‘Shariat Bill’) during the Prime Ministership of Nawaz Sharif. He resigned from membership of the National Assembly as a mark of protest against the 15th Amendment, saying that if passed in its original form, it would negate Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s pluralistic and progressive vision of Pakistan. He left the foreign office to join the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy in 1981 and was subsequently arrested.

He won a seat in Pakistan&#x27;s National Assembly as member from NA-142 (Kasur-V) in 1993 and later in 1997 and served on the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Foreign Relations. He left PML after the 1999 coup d&#x27;état and joined the military-backed regime to become the Minister of Foreign Affairs in 2002 and remained until 2007.

He joined the Pakistan Movement of Justice (PTI) in 2012 and unsuccessfully ran for National Assembly in 2013.

==Early life==
===Education and academics===
Kasuri is an ethnic Mian Arain family, he completed his high school in St Patrick&#x27;s High School, Karachi, and got accepted at the Government College University but later took a transfer to the Punjab University where he earned a BA with &quot;Honors&quot; in international relations, in 1961. Throughout his academic career he had a uniformly excellent record, which culminated earning first position in the B.A E (Hons) examination of the Punjab University in 1961.

==Statesmanship==
===Foreign diplomacy===
In 1990, he again joined the foreign ministry and guided Pakistan Muslim League on foreign policies issues. In 1996, he presided over the party delegation and visited the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC). This delegation was invited by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and was received by the top leadership of the CCP. He has also attended the Inter-Parliamentary Union conferences held in Seoul and in Cairo in 1997 as a chairman of the Pakistan Parliamentary Delegations. In 1998, he publicly endorsed for Prime minister Nawaz Sharif&#x27;s decision for atomic tests (See: Chagai-I and Chagai-II) and was appointed as Prime Minister&#x27;s Special Envoy (PMSE) to present his country&#x27;s point of view, while backing the rationale of country&#x27;s nuclear response. He subsequently visited many countries to gather the support for country&#x27;s nuclear testing program, including Russia, the United States, Canada, China, France, the United Kingdom, and other important countries in the world.

On 23 January 2012, he openly admitted on his Twitter account, to handing over Dr. Aafia Siddiqui to the US when was a foreign minister of Pakistan under General Musharraf. General Musharraf admits in his book (In the Line of Fire, page 237) that his government captured and handed over 369 people to the US. He also writes that the Pakistani government received ‘millions of dollars’ as prize money from the CIA for capturing those people.

===Political activism===
He briefly left the Foreign Office (FO) in 1981 and joined the Independence Movement to step into national politics. He was quickly elevated as the Secretary-General of the &quot;Tehrik-e-Istiqlal&quot; (lit. Independence Movement). He was subsequently arrested on innumerable occasions during his long struggle for democracy. After the military government of Zia-ul-Haq went back on its promise to hold general elections in the country, leading political parties got together under the banner of the Movement for Restoration of Democracy (MRD) for the purpose of holding general elections, restoration of fundamental rights of the citizens, removal of restrictions placed on the free functioning of the press and the establishment of an independent judiciary. He was arrested on numerous occasions for taking part in a movement launched by the political parties in February 1981 for the achievement of the above objectives.

In 1983, he departed from the country in opposition response to Zia&#x27;s purge and started his academic career in France. He briefly return in 1988 after the mysterious death of Zia-ul-Haq in a plane crash and joined the Foreign service office after being requested by his peers. He took first public participation in 1993 general elections on a Pakistan Muslim League (PML) platform, and was a provisional vice-president of PML, and successfully defended his constituency, NA-106: Kasur (now NA-142) in the 1997 general elections. He was subsequently appointed as Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information and Media Development (PSCIMD) and was also a senior member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Foreign Relations (PSCFR).

In 1999, after the 1999 military coup d&#x27;état, Kasuri had a severe confrontation with Javed Hashmi who was presiding the PML in absence of Sharif, and defected to the dissident group headed by Shuja&#x27;at Hussain in 2001. He successfully contested in 2002 general elections from a NA-142: Kasur.

Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri was one of the few members of the Pakistan Muslim League who always expressed his views on all the national issues frankly and fearlessly regardless of whether the government of the day liked his views or not. In 1997, he publicly called for the issue of the impeachment of the former President Farook Ahmad Leghari, and raised objections on the Fourteenth Amendment and Fifteenth Amendment; he expressed very strongly and issued statements on the constitutional changes. He lobbied against the Fifteen Amendment, particularly as originally presented, was strongly objected to by him. It was primarily due to his efforts and his colleagues&#x27; lobbying that Sharif&#x27;s government had to make an amendment in the Fifteenth Amendment, which contained provisions, which were highly detrimental to the federal and democratic structure of the Constitution. Kasuri put immense effort to stop the bill from becoming into the law in its original shape that he threatened Prime Minister Sharif to resign from the party and his constituency unless the bill was amended, and notably resigned from the party, though resignation was torn up by Sharif in a stormy meeting of the Parliamentary party.

==Foreign minister==
On 23 November 2004, Prime Minister Zafarullah Khan Jamali nominated Kasuri to be country&#x27;s Minister of Foreign Affairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawn News Archives, 11/2002&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; His nomination was not objected by the opposition parties, and secured the unanimous votes for his nomination in the parliament. On 9:30 am PST, 23 November 2004, he took charge of the foreign ministry and announced that the new government&#x27;s first priority is to normalize relations with India. He directed Pakistan&#x27;s foreign policy more on neutral ground base and quoted: &quot;We want to improve relations with India and wish peace and prosperity for the people of India.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawn News Archives, 2002/11/25/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<doc id="930956" wikidata="Q5125133" url="?curid=930956" title="Claire (programming language)">
<text>Claire is a high-level functional and object-oriented programming language with rule processing abilities. It was designed by Yves Caseau at Bouygues&#x27; e-Lab research laboratory, and received its final definition in 2004.

Claire provides:
*A simple object system with parametric classes and methods
*Polymorphic and parametric functional programming
*Production rules triggered by events
*Versioned snapshots of the state of the whole system, or any part, supporting rollback and easy exploration of search spaces
*Explicit relations between entities; for example, two entities might be declared inverses of one another
*First-class sets with convenient syntax for set-based programming
*An expressive set-based type system allowing both second-order static and dynamic typing

Claire&#x27;s reference implementation, consisting of an interpreter and compiler, was fully open-sourced with the release of version 3.3.46 in February 2009. Another implementation, WebClaire, is supported commercially.

Claire has, since 2022, a new reference version, CLAIRE4, which is written on the Go language. It has a new website with documentations and examples, together with a Github open source repository.

==Overview==
Claire is a general-purpose programming language, best suited to application software requiring sophisticated data modeling, rule processing or problem solving. WebClaire adds extensions for fuller integration with the operating system and for programming web applications.

Though Claire can be used for complete projects, it is designed to integrate smoothly with C++, Java, or Go.

The key set of features that distinguishes Claire from other programming languages has been dictated by experience in solving complex optimization problems. Two features not found in other mixed functional/object-oriented languages, such as OCaml, Scala and F#, are &quot;versioning&quot; and &quot;production rules&quot;.

Versions can be viewed as a stack of snapshots of some part of the system, which can be made as large (for expressiveness) or small (for efficiency) as necessary. Creation and roll-back of versions permit backtracking, as found in logic programming, though Claire&#x27;s backtracking may cover any user-defined structure rather than just a set of logic variables.

A production rule in Claire is composed of an event, a condition and a response to be evaluated if the condition is satisfied. An event may be any change in an object&#x27;s slot or the instantiation of a class, and a response may itself set off further events. Such production rules are especially useful in describing reactive algorithms, such as those for constraint propagation.

Claire was created as a successor to LAURE, an expressive but complex language designed by Caseau in the 1980s that combined many paradigms. Claire was intended to be both easier to learn than its predecessor and to impose no performance overhead relative to C++; it is thus a much smaller language, omitting features such as constraints and deductive rules, and is closer to C in spirit and syntax. Its main users in industry have been the Bouygues and Thales Groups. The new Claire 4 release brings gains in reliability (via Go&#x27;s strength as underlying language) and in performance of compiler and interpreter.

==Example==
A function to compute the &quot;n&quot;th Fibonacci sequence number:

 fib(n:integer) : integer
 -&gt; (if (n &lt; 2) 1
 else fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2))

<doc id="930962" wikidata="Q816079" url="?curid=930962" title="Belly (band)">
<text>Belly is an alternative rock band formed in Rhode Island in 1991 by Tanya Donelly. The original lineup consisted of Donelly on vocals and guitar, Fred Abong on bass, and brothers Tom and Chris Gorman on guitar and drums respectively. The band released two albums during the early 1990s alternative rock boom before breaking up in 1995. They reunited in 2016 and mounted limited tours in the United States and United Kingdom that year. 

In 1993, their debut album &quot;Star&quot; was released, and its lead single &quot;Feed the Tree&quot; would be Belly&#x27;s biggest hit song, peaking at number one on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart and number 95 on the Hot 100. Several additional singles from the album also appeared on the Modern Rock Tracks chart.

Shortly after the release of &quot;Star&quot;, Abong left the group and was replaced by Gail Greenwood. The band released their second album, &quot;King&quot;, in early 1995. Commercial and critical success did not match &quot;Star&quot; and the band broke up at the end of that year. Donelly embarked on a long solo career. She reformed Belly in 2016 with the same lineup that had recorded &quot;King&quot;, and their third album, &quot;Dove&quot;, was released in 2018.

==History==
===1992–93: Formation and &quot;Star&quot;===
All four original members of Belly knew each other from high school on Aquidneck Island, Rhode Island. The Gormans and Abong came out of the Newport hardcore punk scene (the Gormans having played in Verbal Assault, Abong in Vicious Circle). Donelly had previously co-founded two Boston-based indie rock bands, Throwing Muses and The Breeders, the former with her step-sister Kristin Hersh and the latter with Kim Deal of the Pixies. 

Donelly named the band &quot;Belly&quot; because she thought the word was &quot;both pretty and ugly.&quot; The band played their first concert on March 14, 1992 at the 3&#x27;s bar in their hometown of Newport, Rhode Island.

The band&#x27;s debut EP, &quot;Slow Dust&quot; (1992), made it to number one on the United Kingdom indie chart. Soon after, their single &quot;Feed the Tree&quot; made the Top 40 in the UK Singles Chart and their first album, &quot;Star&quot; (1993), hit number two on the UK Albums Chart.

In the United States, the album was RIAA certified gold, largely based on the success of &quot;Feed the Tree&quot; on Modern Rock radio stations and MTV, where the video was featured as part of MTV&#x27;s Buzz Bin videos and Alternative Nation video show for much of 1993. Two follow-up singles were released, &quot;Gepetto&quot; and &quot;Slow Dog,&quot; but neither matched the initial success of &quot;Feed the Tree.&quot; Belly was nominated for two Grammys in 1994: Best New Artist and Best Alternative Music Performance for &quot;Star&quot;. The album went on to sell over 800,000 copies in the US alone. On several early &#x27;93 tour dates in the US and the UK, former Throwing Muses member Leslie Langston lent a hand on bass. 
In early 1993, they embarked on a &#x27;joint headliner&#x27; tour with Radiohead. Following a short warm up tour of smaller venues in the UK also in early 1993, they embarked upon a larger tour where they were supported by the Cranberries.

===1994–96: &quot;King&quot; and break-up===
Just after the release of &quot;Star&quot;, bassist Fred Abong left and was replaced by Gail Greenwood. Greenwood was originally a guitar player in a Boston-area metal band before being recruited to play bass in Belly. The live sound of the band evolved to accommodate her style, with its shows featuring more electric guitar than before and less of the dreamy quality of its first album.

As a result, the group&#x27;s next album, &quot;King&quot; (1995), was more rock and roll oriented. The album&#x27;s sales did not meet label expectations, and its numerous singles failed to sustain any significant airplay on Modern Rock radio. Belly appeared on the April 20, 1995, cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine. The band also performed &quot;Superconnected&quot; on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; in June that year. It was one of the band&#x27;s last major U.S television appearances. In the summer of 1995, Belly was one of the support bands in Europe for R.E.M. on their world tour, then finished out the year extensively touring the US with Catherine Wheel and Jewel as support acts.

In 1996, Donelly broke up the band. Speaking to &quot;Q&quot;, she explained the reasons behind her decision: &quot;The first couple of years of Belly were a blast. &quot;Star&quot; was a big hit and we partied hard. But by the time we went to make &quot;King&quot;, there was a lot of negative stuff going on. &quot;King&quot; was a reaction to the bright shininess of &quot;Star&quot; and we weren&#x27;t surprised when it didn&#x27;t sell. I regret not making another Belly album, but at the time I thought, Screw it, I&#x27;m outta here.&quot;

After the break-up Tanya Donelly started a successful solo career and has since released several solo albums. Greenwood went on to stints playing bass for L7 and for Bif Naked, while playing guitar in her own Rhode Island–based band Benny Sizzler. Tom Gorman played briefly with Buffalo Tom, then on tour in 1999 with Kristin Hersh before joining up with his brother Chris in a commercial photography business based in New York City. Fred Abong first worked post-Belly as a carpenter &quot;working in a high-end woodworking shop making fancy cabinets for rich people&quot;, then went on to earn a PhD in philosophy.
===2016–2020: Reunion and &quot;Dove&quot;===
On February 8, 2016, the band launched an official web site announcing a limited summer reunion tour with dates in the UK, Ireland and the US.

In advance of the tour, the band performed two warm-up shows in their hometown of Newport, Rhode Island, on July 8 and 9, the band&#x27;s first live appearances since 1995. Two new songs, &quot;Human Child&quot; and &quot;Army of Clay&quot; were debuted on the tour that followed, hinting that the band was evolving, while at the same time maintaining familiar elements of the Belly &quot;sound&quot; of the past.

Belly announced in July 2017 that they had begun recording a third album, to be titled &quot;Dove&quot;. On October 5, 2017, the band started a PledgeMusic campaign for the album, and the album was released on May 4, 2018. On October 26, 2017, the band released their cover of &quot;Hushabye Mountain&quot; as an exclusive download on Pledgemusic- their first new recording in over 20 years.

&quot;Shiny One&quot;, the first single from &quot;Dove&quot;, was released on February 23, 2018. Preceding the release of &quot;Dove&quot;, the band released the &quot;Feel&quot; EP for Record Store Day in April 2018.

In the summer and fall of 2018, the band went on a tour of the United States and Europe to promote the album.

For their 30th anniversary and for Record Store Day 2021, the band released a compilation of B-Sides and cover songs called &quot;Bees&quot;. 

==Style==
Belly vocalist Tanya Donelly&#x27;s voice has been described as having a &quot;fiery spark&quot; with a &quot;sweet rasp in her throat&quot;, with a style described as &quot;down to earth.&quot; Her lyrics are rich with celestial, mythological and fairytale-like imagery. Musically the band finds its foundations in guitar rock, with sometimes quirky, but tightly composed arrangements that put a premium on melody.

<text>Llanedeyrn () is a former village, now a district and community, in the east of the city of Cardiff, Wales, located around 3.5 miles from the city centre. The parish of Llanedeyrn rests on the banks of the river Rhymney and is visible nesting on a hill side above the A48(M), westbound on the approach into Cardiff.

==The name==

The name used in English &quot;Llanedeyrn&quot; is in fact the perpetuation of an erroneous Welsh form. 

In Welsh, the name as it stands is pronounced . In English, it is pronounced as if the name were Lanedin, with Welsh becoming , and the difficult, for non-Welsh-speakers, &quot;Edeyrn&quot; becoming an easier &quot;Edin&quot;.

The Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould (The Lives of the British Saints, 1908) states that there has been confusion between the names Edern and Edeyrn, and that Edern is &quot;the Latin Aeternus, but it is commonly written in later Welsh Edeyrn, which is really a different name&quot;.
The name &quot;Aeternus&quot;, or &quot;Eternus&quot; means &quot;eternal, everlasting&quot;.

One reason for Edeyrn instead of Edern might have been a belief that it was based on Welsh &quot;teyrn&quot; (&quot;king, prince, lord&quot; in earlier Welsh, though nowadays &quot;tyrant, despot, oppressor&quot;)

Most earlier forms of the name show it be Llanedern , although a couple do show &quot;Edeyrn&quot;. The meaning is &quot;church (of) Edern&quot;.

The local pronunciation when Gwentian Welsh was spoken here (until the early 1900s) was based on Llanedern. It was Llanetarn , showing the typical south-eastern change of final-syllable to (also a feature of north-western Welsh, in Gwynedd and Anglesey (Ynys Môn)) and the provection of to at the beginning of a penultimate syllable.

A more standard form of this is Llanedarn (south-eastern provection being a somewhat stigmatised feature in Welsh), and this is the form used by Samuel Lewis in 1834 in his Topographical Dictionary Of Wales. He adds &quot;Llan-edeyrn&quot; in brackets after &quot;Llanedarn&quot;.

John Hobson Mathews  (Mab Cernyw), editor of the &quot;Cardiff Records, Being Materials For A History Of The County Borough From The Earliest Times&quot; mentions Llanedern in Volume 5 (1905), in the &quot;Schedule of Place Names&quot;. 

&quot;LLANEDERN (the church of Saint Eternus.) A village and parish in the Hundred of Cibwr, three miles north-east from Cardiff, on the main Roman road….&quot;

He remarks further that &quot;Llanedeyrn&quot; is incorrect as it is not the historical form, as too is Llanedarn (which he spells with a final &quot;e&quot; – &quot;Llanedarne&quot;) because it is a colloquial form. &quot;The spellings &quot;Llanedeyrn&quot; and &quot;Llanedarne&quot; are alike erroneous; the first is founded on mistaken etymology, the second a barbarism.&quot;

==History==

The village name is believed to refer to a 6th-century prince and Celtic saint named St Edeyrn or Edern. 

During the 6th century, St Edeyrn and a fellow monk, St Isan, were given the task of spreading the faith and establishing places of worship. The first location chosen by the two monks was Llanishen. This name commemorates St Isan (Llan + Isan) and the other St Edeyrn (&quot;Llan&quot; means church or parish in the Welsh language). St Edeyrn was reputed to have travelled widely, and as a result there are churches in North and South Wales dedicated to his memory. St Edeyrn gathered together a community of about 300 that lived and worshipped in the Llanedeyrn area.

The original Norman-style church dating back to 1123 exists only as stonework remnants beneath restoration work completed in 1888; the church today is a simple structure with a tower and six bells. Adjacent to this church is a public house called the Unicorn. The building dates to the 14th century and was converted in the late 18th century.

Nearby in Pen-y-Groes (Welsh: Pen-y-groes) a Calvinistic Methodist school room and chapel was built in 1840.

Comprising only a few buildings, Llanedeyrn became part of Cardiff in 1889.

In the late 1960s, Cardiff Council decided to build low cost social housing in Llanedeyrn, with an estimated 3,500 homes to be erected for 12,000 poor people (2,000 homes owned by the city council and 1,500 private homes). The first of the estates in the area was opened in 1968. The council provided prefabricated and terraced houses, and many two-, three- and multi-storey blocks of flats were constructed.

In 1974 the Maelfa shopping centre was built and a part-time police station was opened, followed in 1975 by the Retreat public house next door. The public house &quot;The Pennsylvania&quot;, dating from 1972, closed down and reopened in 2004 as the &quot;New Penn&quot;.

The area also had the first comprehensive school built in Wales, Llanedeyrn High School, which Colin Jackson attended in his youth.

==Maelfa==
Whoever chose the name “Maelfa” [ˡməɪlva] for the shopping centre is unknown, but Llanedeyrn has probably the only instance in Wales of “Maelfa” as a place name. It is a word used in nineteenth-century literary Welsh meaning &quot;shop, market-place&quot;, first seen in 1803 in the Welsh-English Dictionary of lexicographer William Owen-Pughe and apparently coined by him. It is literally “profit-place” (mael = profit, advantage, benefit) and (-fa = suffix meaning “place”). “Mael” is in fact from Middle English “vail” (= profit, return, proceeds), from Old French “vail”, from Latin, and related to the English word “value”.

== Amenities ==
Llanedeyrn is home to several primary schools that offer education in the English language, including St. Philip Evans RC Primary School, Springwood Primary School, All Saints Church-In-Wales Primary School, and Llanedeyrn Primary School. Additionally, Ysgol Y Berllan Deg is a Welsh-medium primary school that serves the community. Llanedeyrn is also home to St Teilos Church in Wales High School, which provides secondary education for students in the area.

Llanedeyrn is home to the Powerhouse Hub, a community center that offers support and assistance to residents. Services include welfare and benefits advice, assistance with the housing waiting list, and support for homeless individuals.

There is a Harvester restaurant in Llanedeyrn. There is a hotel on Circle Way East (next to Eastern Avenue) which was rebranded from Park Inn to Mercure Cardiff North Hotel in 2019.

==Housing Estates==

The housing estates in Llanedeyrn are:
Hillrise, Springwood, Glenwood, Coed-Y-Gores, St Phillip Evans Court, Bryn Fedw, Maelfa, Eastside Quarter, Roundwood, Chapelwood, Bryn Fedw, Pennsylvania, Jefferson Court, Lincoln Court, Ael-Y-Bryn, Coed Ederyn, Wellwood and Awel Mor.

==Government==

In 2016 Llanedeyrn became one of four new communities in Cardiff, having previously been part of the Pentwyn community. However, like many communities in Cardiff, it does not have a community council.

For elections to Cardiff Council Llanedeyrn is part of the Pentwyn electoral ward.

<doc id="930994" wikidata="Q7442096" url="?curid=930994" title="Seattle Fault">
<text>The Seattle Fault is a zone of multiple shallow east–west thrust faults that cross the Puget Sound Lowland and through Seattle (in the U.S. state of Washington) in the vicinity of Interstate Highway 90. The Seattle Fault was first recognized as a significant seismic hazard in 1992, when a set of reports showed that about 1,100 years ago it was the scene of a major earthquake of about magnitude 7 – an event that entered Native American oral traditions. Extensive research has since shown the Seattle Fault to be part of a regional system of faults.

== Notable earthquake ==

First suspected from mapping of gravitational anomalies in 1965 and an uplifted marine terrace at Restoration Point (foreground in picture above), the Seattle Fault&#x27;s existence and likely hazard were definitively established by a set of five reports published in &quot;Science&quot; in 1992. These reports looked at the timing of abrupt uplift and subsidence around Restoration Point and Alki Point (distant right side of picture), tsunami deposits on Puget Sound, turbidity in lake paleosediments, rock avalanches, and multiple landslides around Lake Washington, and determined that all these happened about 1,100 years ago (between 923 and 924 CE, and most likely due to an earthquake of magnitude 7 or greater on the Seattle Fault.
Although the 923-924 CE earthquake was over a thousand years ago, local traditional stories have preserved an association of a powerful supernatural spirit – a&#x27;yahos, noted for shaking, rushes of water, and landsliding – with five locales along the trace of the Seattle Fault, including a &quot;spirit boulder&quot; called Psai-Yah-hus near the Fauntleroy ferry dock in West Seattle.
== Geology ==

The Seattle Fault is the structural boundary where 50–60 million years old (early Tertiary) basalt of the Crescent Formation on the south has been uplifted – the Seattle Uplift – and is tipping into the Seattle Basin, where the Tertiary bedrock is buried under at least of relatively softer, lighter sedimentary strata of the younger Blakeley and Blakely Harbor formations. This has resulted in a wide zone of complex faulting, with three or more main south-dipping thrust faults. Most of the faulting is &quot;blind&quot; (not reaching the surface), and generally difficult to locate because of heavy vegetation or development. Three principal strands have been identified, their location determined by high-resolution seismic reflection and aeromagnetic surveys. The northernmost strand lies nearly along Interstate 90 and then under Lake Sammamish. The central section of the fault zone – where it crosses the apparent location of the Olympic–Wallowa Lineament – shows marked variation in the location of the strands and of the underlying structure, but the nature and significance of this is not understood.

The fault extends for approximately 70 km (43 miles) from near Fall City on the east, where it appears to be terminated by the South Whidbey Island Fault, to Hood Canal on the west (not shown on the map). However, boundaries defining the western termination zone is currently unclear (see Puget Sound faults#Question of western termination). It is the northern edge of the Seattle Uplift, of which the Tacoma Fault is the southern edge. One model has the Seattle and Tacoma faults converging at depth to form a wedge, which is being popped up by approximately north–south oriented compression that ultimately derives from plate tectonics. Another model (see diagram) interprets the Seattle Uplift as a sheet of rock that is being forced up a ramp. Subsequent work suggests that the structure of the Seattle Fault may vary from east to west, with both models being applicable in different sections. A later model has part of the north-thrusting sheet forming a wedge between the sedimentary formations of the Seattle Basin and the underlying bedrock.

The Seattle Fault is believed to date from about 40 million years ago (late Eocene). This is about the time that the strike-slip movement on the north-striking Straight Creek Fault to the east ceased, due to the intrusions of plutons. It appears that when the Straight Creek Fault became stuck the north–south compressive force that it had accommodated by strike-slip motion was transferred to the crust of the Puget Lowland, which subsequently folded and faulted, and the various blocks jammed over one another.

Other scarps associated with the Seattle fault have been identified by LIDAR-based mapping; trenching has generally shown the faulting to be more complex than was first realized. Many of the details of the Seattle Fault, including recurrence rate, remain to be resolved. A study of sediments in Lake Washington found evidence of seven large (M &gt; 7) earthquakes in the last 3,500 years.

Surface scarps due to faulting are rarely observed in this area (due to topography, vegetation, and urbanization); a rare exception can be seen at Mee Kwa Mooks Park south of Alki Point. This is the site of the &quot;West Seattle Fault&quot;; the prominent rise there is due to uplift on the north side of the fault.

== Hazard ==

The Seattle Fault (and the related Tacoma Fault) is not the only source of earthquake hazard in the Puget Lowland. Other faults in the near surface continental crust, such as the South Whidbey Island Fault (near Everett), and the yet to be studied Olympia Fault (near Olympia), though historically quiescent, are suspected of generating earthquakes of around magnitude 7. Others, such as the 2001 Nisqually earthquake, originate about below Puget Sound in the Benioff zone of the subducting Juan de Fuca plate; being so deep their energy is dissipated. And there are the infrequent but very powerful great subduction events, such as the magnitude 9 1700 Cascadia earthquake, where the entire Cascadia subduction zone, from Cape Mendocino to Vancouver Island, slips.

But the Seattle and Tacoma faults are probably the most serious earthquake threat to the populous Seattle–Tacoma area. A 2002 study of bridge vulnerability estimated that a magnitude 7 earthquake on the Seattle Fault would damage approximately 80 bridges in the Seattle–Tacoma area, whereas a magnitude 9 subduction event would damage only around 87 bridges in all of Western Washington. The same study also found that with failure of just six bridges (the minimum damage for a Benioff M 6.5 event) there could be at least $3 billion lost in business revenue alone. Subsequent retrofitting by the Washington Department of Transportation and the City of Seattle would likely reduce damage to key bridges. But there is concern that such an earthquake on the Seattle Fault would devastate unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings, of which the City of Seattle is estimated to have around a thousand, concentrated in Capitol Hill, Pioneer Square, and the International District.
Other recent work indicates that the Seattle Fault can generate two types of earthquakes; both pose &quot;considerable hazard&quot; to the Seattle metropolitan region. The A.D. 900–930 earthquake is believed to be the only instance in the past 7,000 years of the type that causes a regional uplift. The other type is more localized and shallower (and therefore more damaging); at least four such events are believed to have occurred in the past 3,000 years on the west end of the fault. (The history of the central and eastern segments is not known.)

Calculations based on fault length and paleoseismological studies show that the Seattle Fault can generate a very damaging magnitude 7.0 earthquake. In addition to extensive damage to unreinforced structures and structures built on fill (such as much of Seattle&#x27;s Pioneer Square area, the industrial area, and the waterfront), computer modeling has shown that such earthquakes could cause a tsunami of about high on Elliott Bay. The modeling shows that such a tsunami would also inundate the industrial areas on Commencement Bay 30 miles south (Tacoma) and low-lying areas on the Puyallup River delta. There is also concern that a severe or prolonged event could cause failure of the Duwamish or Puyallup River deltas, where the main port facilities for Seattle and Tacoma are located (Harbor Island and Commencement Bay).

<doc id="931001" wikidata="Q707468" url="?curid=931001" title="Popliteal artery">
<text>The popliteal artery is a deeply placed continuation of the femoral artery opening in the distal portion of the adductor magnus muscle. It courses through the popliteal fossa and ends at the lower border of the popliteus muscle, where it branches into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries.

The deepest (most anterior) structure in the fossa, the popliteal artery runs close to the joint capsule of the knee as it spans the intercondylar fossa. Five genicular branches of the popliteal artery supply the capsule and ligaments of the knee joint. The genicular arteries are the superior lateral, superior medial, middle, inferior lateral, and inferior medial genicular arteries. They participate in the formation of the periarticular genicular anastomosis, a network of vessels surrounding the knee that provides collateral circulation capable of maintaining blood supply to the leg during full knee flexion, which may kink the popliteal artery.

==Structure==

The popliteal artery is the continuation of the femoral artery. It exits the popliteal fossa under the fibrous arch of the soleus muscle.

===Relations===
* Anteriorly: The popliteal surface of the femur, the knee joint, and the popliteus muscle.
* Posteriorly: The popliteal vein and the tibial nerve, fascia, and skin.
* Laterally: The biceps femoris and the lateral condyle of femur in upper part, and plantaris, lateral gastrocnemius in lower part.
* Medially: The semimembranosus and the medial condyle of femur in upper part, and tibial nerve, popliteal vein, medial head of gastrocnemius in lower part.

===Branches===
The branches of the popliteal artery are:
*anterior tibial artery.
*posterior tibial artery.
*sural artery.
*medial superior genicular artery.
*lateral superior genicular artery.
*middle genicular artery.
*lateral inferior genicular artery.
*medial inferior genicular artery.

Muscular branches of the popliteal artery supply the hamstring, gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris muscles. The superior muscular branches of the popliteal artery have clinically important anastomoses with the terminal part of the deep femoral and gluteal arteries. The cutaneous branches arise either directly by the popliteal artery or indirectly by the muscular branches. Genicular branches are five in number, two superior, two inferior, and one middle. The middle genicular artery supplies the cruciate ligaments and the synovial membrane of knee joint.

===Tibial-fibular trunk===

The fibular artery typically arises from the posterior tibial artery. Therefore, the posterior tibial artery proximal to the fibular artery origin is sometimes called the &quot;tibial-peroneal trunk&quot; or &quot;tibial-fibular trunk&quot; and it could be said that the popliteal artery bifurcates into the &quot;tibial-fibular trunk&quot; and &quot;anterior tibial artery&quot;.

==Clinical significance==
* Popliteal pulse: Because the popliteal artery is deep, it may be difficult to feel the popliteal pulse. Palpation (checking) of this pulse is commonly performed with the person in the prone position with the knee flexed to relax the popliteal fascia and hamstrings. The pulsations are best felt in the inferior part of the fossa where the popliteal artery is related to the tibia. Weakening or loss of the popliteal pulse is a sign of a femoral artery obstruction.
* Popliteal aneurysm and hemorrhage: A popliteal aneurysm (abnormal dilation of all or part of the popliteal artery) usually causes edema and pain in the popliteal fossa. A popliteal aneurysm may be distinguished from other masses by palpable pulsations (thrills) and abnormal arterial sounds (bruits) detectable with a stethoscope. Because the artery lies deep to the tibial nerve, an aneurysm may stretch the nerve or compress its blood supply (see vasa vasorum). Pain from such nerve compression is usually referred, in this case to the skin overlying the medial aspect of the calf, ankle or foot. Because the artery is closely applied to the popliteal surface of the femur and the joint capsule, fractures of the distal femur or dislocations of the knee may rupture the artery, resulting in hemorrhage. Furthermore, because of their proximity and confinement within the fossa, an injury of the artery and vein may result in an arteriovenous fistula (communication between an artery and a vein). Failure to recognize these occurrences and to act promptly may result in the loss of the leg and foot. If the femoral artery must be ligated, blood can bypass the occlusion through the genicular anastomosis and reach the popliteal artery distal to the ligation.

<doc id="931004" wikidata="Q936020" url="?curid=931004" title="2004–05 NHL lockout">
<text>The 2004–05 NHL lockout was a labor lockout that resulted in the cancellation of the National Hockey League (NHL) season, which would have been its 88th season of play. 

The main dispute was the league&#x27;s desire to implement a salary cap to limit expenditure on player salaries, which was opposed by the NHL Players Association (NHLPA), the players&#x27; labor union, who proposed an alternative system of revenue sharing.

Attempts at collective bargaining before the season began were unsuccessful. The lockout was initiated on September 16, 2004, one day after the expiration of the existing collective bargaining agreement (CBA), which itself had been the result of the 1994–95 lockout. During the lockout, further attempts to negotiate a new CBA floundered, with neither side willing to back down, and this led to the entire season being canceled on February 16, 2005. The NHL and NHLPA negotiating teams finally reached an agreement on July 13, 2005, with the lockout officially ending nine days later on July 22, after ratification by the NHL team owners and NHLPA members. The resulting CBA included both a salary cap and revenue sharing.

The lockout had lasted 10 months and 6 days, covering 1,230 unplayed games. As a result, the Stanley Cup was not awarded for the first time since 1919. Among the major professional sports leagues in North America, this was the first (and so far only) time a whole season was canceled because of a labor dispute, and the second time a postseason was canceled (after the 1994–95 MLB strike). Large numbers of NHL players elected to play in European leagues during the lockout.

==Issues==
The NHL, led by Commissioner Gary Bettman, attempted to convince the players to accept a salary structure linking player salaries to league revenues, guaranteeing the clubs what the league called &quot;cost certainty&quot;. According to an NHL-commissioned report prepared by former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Arthur Levitt, prior to 2004–05, NHL clubs spent about 76 percent of their gross revenues on players&#x27; salaries – a figure far higher than those in other North American sports – and collectively lost US$273 million during the 2002–03 season.

On July 20, 2004, the league presented the NHLPA with six concepts to achieve cost certainty. These concepts are believed to have included a &quot;hard&quot;, or inflexible, salary cap similar to the one used in the National Football League, a &quot;soft&quot; salary cap with some capped exceptions similar to the one used in the National Basketball Association, and a centralized salary negotiation system similar to that used in the Arena Football League and Major League Soccer: Bettman had earlier concluded that a luxury tax similar to the one used in Major League Baseball would not have satisfied the league&#x27;s cost certainty objectives. While most sports commentators saw Bettman&#x27;s plan as reasonable, some critics pointed out that a hard salary cap without any revenue sharing was an attempt to gain the support of the big market teams (such as Toronto, Montreal, Detroit, the New York Rangers, Vancouver, and Philadelphia) that did not support Bettman during the 1994–95 lockout.

The NHLPA, under executive director Bob Goodenow, disputed the league&#x27;s financial claims. According to the union, &quot;cost certainty&quot; is little more than a euphemism for a salary cap, which it had vowed never to accept. The union rejected each of the six concepts presented by the NHL, claiming they all contained some form of salary cap. The NHLPA preferred to retain the existing &quot;marketplace&quot; system where players individually negotiate contracts with teams, and teams have complete control of how much they want to spend on players. Goodenow&#x27;s mistrust of the league was supported by a November 2004 &quot;Forbes&quot; report that estimated the NHL&#x27;s losses were less than half the amounts claimed by the league.

Several players also criticized the contracts that overpaid unproven players: one example was the 2002 Bobby Holik contract, in which the New York Rangers signed him to five years for $45 million. After two years, his contract was bought out by the Rangers: according to Glen Sather, the Rangers&#x27; president, &quot;In the new world we live in, Bobby was just paid too much&quot;.

Although the NHL&#x27;s numbers regarding financial losses were disputed, there was no question that several franchises were losing money: some had already declared bankruptcy, and others had held &quot;fire sales&quot; of franchise players, such as the Washington Capitals. Some small-market teams, such as the Pittsburgh Penguins and the remaining small-market Canadian teams, were actually hoping &quot;for&quot; a lockout, since those teams would make more money by losing a season. 

The league did not have large television revenues in the United States, so the NHL was reliant on attendance revenues far more than other leagues: after the lockout of the 2004–05 season, NHL teams made on average only $3 million from television revenues. In addition, in May of the 2004–05 lockout, ESPN formally denied the option to show NHL games on the network due to low ratings in previous seasons. Many NHL teams had low attendance totals in seasons preceding the lockout.

==Negotiations==

Prior to the lockout, the NHLPA had proposed a system in late 2003 that included revenue sharing, a luxury tax, a one-time 5% rollback in player salaries, and reforms to the league&#x27;s entry level system. The league rejected this proposal point-blank, saying it essentially maintained the status quo in favor of the players. 

Shortly before the lockout commenced on 16 September 2004, the NHLPA offered another proposal to the league, one that was believed to be similar to their earlier proposal. The league rejected the union&#x27;s new offer, claiming the new proposal was worse than the one they rejected in 2003. At this point, negotiations stalled until early December, when the NHLPA made a highly anticipated proposal based on a luxury tax, increasing the proposed one-time rollback in players&#x27; salaries to 24%. The NHL rejected this offer, and put forward a counter-proposal that the union flatly rejected.

In late January 2005 - near what the hockey media believed to be the point of no return for the 2004–05 season - discussions were held by the negotiators from both sides, with Bettman and Goodenow not being invited. 

The NHL was represented by Executive Vice President Bill Daly, outside counsel Bob Batterman, and NHL Board of Governors Chairman Harley Hotchkiss, who also co-owned the Calgary Flames. The NHLPA was represented by President Trevor Linden, Senior Director Ted Saskin, and associate counsel Ian Pulver. After four meetings, the sides remained deadlocked because of, according to Saskin, &quot;significant philosophical differences.&quot; 

Shortly after this series of meetings, Daly presented Saskin a proposal that the league believed made a number of concessions to the players, but was still based on a salary cap linked to revenues. The players&#x27; association rejected that proposal, saying that it was &quot;not the basis for an agreement.&quot;

After these negotiations failed, Bettman declared on February 9 that if the lockout was not resolved by that weekend, there would be no hope of saving the season. When talks broke off between the NHL and the NHLPA the next morning, there had been no progress in negotiations. 

On February 14, the union offered to accept a $52 million salary cap under the condition that it was not linked to league revenues, to which the league proposed a counteroffer of a $40 million cap plus $2.2 million in benefits, which the players association rejected. The next day, Bettman sent Goodenow a letter with a final proposal of a $42.5 million cap plus $2.2 million in benefits, setting a deadline of 11:00 the next morning to accept or refuse the offer. The NHLPA presented a counter-offer involving a $49 million cap, which the league rejected.

With no resolution by the 11:00 deadline, Bettman announced the cancellation of the 2004–05 season on February 16, 2005, making the NHL the first major professional sports league in North America to cancel an entire season because of a labor dispute: the announcement was to have come on February 14, but it was delayed because of the death of the patriarch of the Sutter hockey family four days prior, whose funeral was held on February 15. Two days after the cancellation announcement, &quot;The Hockey News&quot; reported that a deal with a $45 million cap had been reached &quot;in principle&quot; (meaning the sides have agreed, but nothing is signed) with the help of owners and former players Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux; both camps immediately denied this report. An emergency 6½-hour meeting took place the next day, but no agreement was reached, formalizing the season&#x27;s cancellation.

Bolstered by the thought of losing a second season to a labor dispute, the sides began meeting again in earnest in June, holding what sources to media would describe as &quot;marathon sessions&quot; in hopes of coming to an agreement. Ending June without a deal in place, the two sides reconvened early the following month, holding meetings on consecutive days from July 4 until July 13, when the parties finally agreed in principle to the terms of a new deal. According to reports, the July 12 session lasted through the night and until 6:00 on the morning of July 13, at which point the talks broke off for five hours, and resumed in time to complete the deal.

On July 21, the players association ratified the agreement with 87 percent of its members voting in favor; the 30 team owners unanimously approved it the next day, officially ending the 310-day lockout.

The salary cap would be adjusted each year to guarantee players 54% of total NHL revenues, and there would also be a salary floor. Player contracts are also guaranteed. The players&#x27; share will increase if revenues rise to specific benchmarks, while revenue sharing will split a pool of money from the 10 highest-grossing teams among the bottom 15. There was a $39 million cap in place for the first year of the CBA.

==Effects of the lockout==
A Canadian public opinion poll conducted by Ipsos-Reid near the start of the lockout found that 52 percent of those polled blamed NHL players for the lockout, whereas 21 percent blamed the owners of NHL teams. Also hurting the NHLPA was the fact that its players had very visibly high salaries, which removed much sympathy from lower-to-middle class fans, with the NHLPA&#x27;s cause being further harmed by Jeremy Roenick and several NHLPA executives making controversial statements that showed their disdain for owners and fans alike.

During the lockout, a movement arose to free the Stanley Cup from the NHL. By the original deed of Lord Stanley, the cup was a challenge cup open to the best amateur hockey team in Canada. Only since 1926 has it been exclusively competed for by NHL teams, and with the 2004–05 NHL season being cancelled, the group felt that the NHL had forfeited its right to award the Cup for the year. On February 7, 2006, a settlement was reached in which the trophy could be awarded to non-NHL teams should the league not operate for a season, although the NHL by that point was playing again.

===Resolution===

The loss of the 2004–05 season meant that for the first time since 1919 there were no results on which to base the order of the 2005 NHL Entry Draft. The league settled on a lottery system in which all teams had a weighted chance at the first pick, expected to be Sidney Crosby. The lottery was tilted so teams with fewer playoff appearances over the last three seasons and fewer number one overall picks over the last four seasons had a better chance of landing higher picks. The complete order was determined by the lottery, and the draft was conducted in a &quot;snake&quot; style, meaning in even rounds, the draft order was reversed. This system was an attempt to compromise between those who felt all teams should have had an equal chance at the first pick and those who felt only the weaker teams should have been in the running.

To ease the transition to the salary cap, teams were allowed one week to buy out players at two-thirds the cost of their remaining contract, which would not count against the salary cap. Bought out players could not re-sign with the same team.

===Effect on NHL and NHLPA===
NHLPA Executive Director and General Counsel Bob Goodenow, seen by many as the biggest villain in the lockout because of his hardline stance against a salary cap, resigned from his position five days after the agreement was ratified amid criticism from many of his constituents. He was replaced by Ted Saskin, formerly senior director of business affairs and licensing for the NHLPA. Saskin was officially named executive director of the NHLPA on November 25, 2005, after the players&#x27; vote of confidence was confirmed by accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.

NHL Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer Bill Daly was promoted to deputy commissioner after the lockout.

The lockout did help franchises better manage their finances and increase their value. Combined with finally receiving a stable national television rights deal in the United States with NBC and Versus (which later became sister networks due to the Comcast NBC merger) and the launch of the NHL Network, 26 of 30 NHL franchises saw an increase in value since before the lockout. Leading the way would be the Pittsburgh Penguins, a team cited even before the lockout to benefit from a lockout due to financial problems related to former team owner Howard Baldwin deferring player salaries in the 1990s (leading to the team&#x27;s second bankruptcy in 1998) and former star player Mario Lemieux (who became the team&#x27;s owner due to also being the team&#x27;s largest creditor) dictating that the team cut costs in order to eliminate the debt from the Baldwin era. Since the lockout, the Penguins&#x27; value increased by a league-high 161.4%, due in no small part to the changing financial landscape of the NHL as well as winning the &quot;Sidney Crosby sweepstakes&quot; after the lockout ended and the construction of the Consol Energy Center to replace the aging Mellon Arena. The only teams that lost value from before the lockout were the Phoenix Coyotes (whose financial problems since the lockout have been well-documented), New York Islanders, Dallas Stars, and Colorado Avalanche.

====Europe====
The majority of players who agreed to play in other professional hockey leagues were playing in Europe. During 2004–05 season, 388 NHL players played in European leagues. The most popular countries were Russia, with 78 NHL players, Sweden, with 75 NHL players, the Czech Republic, with 51 NHL players, Finland, with 45 NHL players and Switzerland with 43 NHL players. In many cases, players who had originally begun their careers in Europe returned to those same teams for the lockout.

Russian Superleague (now KHL) team AK Bars Kazan signed 11 NHL players, including Ilya Kovalchuk, Aleksey Morozov, and Vincent Lecavalier while Pavel Datsyuk played for HC Dynamo Moscow, Patrik Elias played for Czech HC JME Znojemští Orli and Russian Metallurg Magnitogorsk, and Czech superstar Jaromir Jagr played for HC Kladno and then Avangard Omsk. Morozov never returned to the NHL after 2004 (retiring from the KHL after the 2013–14 season), and Jagr would later play three additional seasons with Avangard.

Other Czech players returned to the Czech Republic, including Milan Hejduk (HC Pardubice), Martin Straka (HC Plzeň), Ales Hemsky (HC Pardubice) and Martin Rucinsky (HC Litvínov).

Swiss Nationalliga A had its own NHL stars when Canadians Joe Thornton and Rick Nash signed with HC Davos, Danny Briere and Dany Heatley signed with SC Bern of the Swiss league. This lockout was a major benefit for Swiss ice hockey.

Swedish superstar Peter Forsberg returned to his original club, Modo (although Forsberg had been planning on playing for Modo even if the season had been played). Also returning to Modo along with Forsberg were Canucks teammates Daniel Sedin, Henrik Sedin, and Markus Naslund, all of whom were originally drafted from Modo, while still others joined other Elitserien sides. Some Elitserien games were also being broadcast by Rogers Sportsnet in Canada.

Finnish SM-liiga had its share of players during the lockout. Notable Finnish players included Saku Koivu (TPS, his first professional team), Olli Jokinen (HIFK), Jarkko Ruutu (HIFK) and Vesa Toskala (Ilves). Teemu Selanne also made a contract with Jokerit where he began his professional career, but injuries prevented him from suiting up for the entire season. Foreign players included John Madden who played 2 games for HIFK, Sean Avery, who had a brief stint with the Pelicans, Brian Campbell who played for Jokerit and Hal Gill who played for Lukko. SM-liiga featured three top goaltenders as Dwayne Roloson played for Lukko, Tomas Vokoun played for HIFK and Tim Thomas (who had had three previous stints in the SM-liiga) played for Jokerit, leading his team to the championship finals and being awarded the league&#x27;s most valuable player award. Finnish Mestis also featured NHL talent when Sami Kapanen and Kimmo Timonen played for KalPa. Timonen and Kapanen partially owned the team and the duo was joined by Adam Hall who also played for KalPa during the lockout.

Erik Cole, Olaf Kolzig, and Nathan Dempsey were among the notable players to go to Germany to play in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga.

Fair share of Slovak NHL players returned to their home country to play for various Slovak Extraliga sides during the lockout, including Pavol Demitra, Marián Hossa, Marián Gáborík (all in HK Dukla Trenčín), Miroslav Šatan and Ľubomír Višňovský (both in HC Slovan Bratislava), Michal Handzuš, Richard Zedník and Vladimír Országh (all in HKm Zvolen), Ladislav Nagy and Martin Štrbák (both in HC Košice), and Žigmund Pálffy (in HK 36 Skalica).

Latvian league club HK Riga 2000, which played also in the Belarusian Extraleague, signed several NHL players. Two of them were Latvians Karlis Skrastins and Sergei Zholtok and the third was American Darby Hendrickson, who was a close friend of Zholtok. After Zholtok died due to a heart condition, Hendrickson left the club, so that only Skrastins finished the season with the club.

A number of NHL players also went to Great Britain. In the Elite Ice Hockey League, Coventry Blaze signed Wade Belak, Cardiff Devils signed Rob Davison, London Racers signed Eric Cairns and Scott Nichol, and Nottingham Panthers signed Nick Boynton, Ian Moran, Steve McKenna. McKenna also used that season to play for the Adelaide Avalanche in the Australian Ice Hockey League. In the British National League, Guildford Flames signed Jamie McLennan and David Oliver, Bracknell Bees signed Brendan Witt while Newcastle Vipers signed Chris McAllister. In 2008, McCallister signed for the Vipers for a second time.

Another notable move came from Karl Dykhuis. He signed with the Amsterdam Bulldogs in the Netherlands.

Chris Mason (Nashville), Scott Hartnell (Nashville) and Travis Brigley (Colorado) became Norwegian champions with Vålerenga Ishockey. In addition, Mark Bell, who at the time was playing for Chicago Blackhawks, played for the Norwegian GET-ligaen club Trondheim Black Panthers.

Several NHL players signed in the Italian league Serie A, including Eric Belanger to the Bolzano-Bozen Foxes, Craig Adams to the Milano Vipers, Matt Cullen to SG Cortina and Fernando Pisani to the SCL Tigers, among others. Calgary Flames players Steve Montador and Steven Reinprecht won the French Ligue Magnus with HC Mulhouse.

Rob Niedermayer and Jason Strudwick played in the Hungarian league with Ferencvárosi TC.

Most of the NHL players playing for European clubs had contract clauses allowing them to leave for the NHL once the lockout ended.

====North America====
There were two attempts to form alternative professional leagues in North America during the lockout, but both failed. A revival of the World Hockey Association had been planned since 2002 and was to start play shortly after the lockout was expected to begin. Despite having former WHA star Bobby Hull as commissioner, the league never got off the ground. A lack of stable financing undermined plans to sign both locked-out players and top prospects such as Sidney Crosby.

Another league, the Original Stars Hockey League (OSHL), was established in Canada and expected to play four-on-four games between six teams (ostensibly representing the Original Six cities) in various Canadian cities until the lockout was settled. More than 100 players purportedly signed up to play in the OSHL. The league debuted on September 17, 2004 in Barrie, Ontario, Canada. In the inaugural game, &quot;Toronto&quot; defeated &quot;Detroit&quot; 16–13. The next and last game was played in Brampton, Ontario with &quot;Boston&quot; defeating &quot;Montreal&quot; 14–11. Jerseys worn by players were based on Original Six (Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Montreal, New York, Toronto), but all had the words &quot;OSHL&quot; in white, three stars patches on the shoulders instead of team logos or cities. However, escalating salary demands by players quickly bankrupted the league. Shortly after its first two games, OSHL president Randy Gumbley announced that the league had received firm commitments from only twenty players, and the league soon folded.

NHL players looking for a place to play clearly preferred stable, established European clubs to upstart leagues that were derisively dubbed as &quot;&quot; operations by their critics. A small number of players played for established minor league teams near their families and homes, while others chose to repay the league which gave them a start by returning.

The Motor City Mechanics of the UHL got a major boost during their first year in existence when the lockout officially started. The team signed Detroit Red Wings players Chris Chelios, Derian Hatcher, and Kris Draper. This happened because Derian Hatcher knew the team was playing at Great Lakes Sports City Superior Arena where he often played growing up. Because of visa problems Kris Draper never played a game for the Mechanics. Later on they also signed Bryan Smolinski and Sean Avery and were able to roll four NHL players on their opponents. All of the players had some experience or connection to the area.

The ECHL gained some players. Scott Gomez played for his hometown team, the Alaska Aces and won the ECHL&#x27;s Most Valuable Player award, while Curtis Brown, whose wife is a native of Southern California, played for the San Diego Gulls, and Bates Battaglia joined his younger brother Anthony on the Mississippi Sea Wolves roster. A pair of Nashville Predators teammates, Shane Hnidy and Jeremy Stevenson, both of whom had early careers in the ECHL, returned to the league and found themselves playing against each other in the first round of the Kelly Cup playoffs, as Hnidy&#x27;s Florida Everblades faced Stevenson&#x27;s South Carolina Stingrays in the American Conference quarterfinals.

Some prospects who may have never had a serious look were given chances they thought they never would have. Undrafted journeyman Chris Minard had been signed with Alaska for his third season in the ECHL when the lockout allowed Davis Payne to assign him on the same line as Gomez at the Aces. Gomez saw a gem that led to the 2005 ECHL All-Star Game, and a top ECHL player that season; the pairing led to Gomez giving Minard a shot after the lockout ended, and he played his way into the AHL, and eventually signing a two-way contract with the Pittsburgh Penguins, receiving in 2007–08 his first call-up to the NHL. Minard said about the experience, &quot;That&#x27;s when I learned a lot about being a goal-scorer, playing with a guy like that who can pass the puck. It was a pretty cool experience.&quot;

In addition, many younger players who would be impact players on their NHL rosters stayed down in the American Hockey League for a full season – most notably Jason Spezza, who won the league scoring title and MVP awards – changing the aspect of that league&#x27;s entire season. A record crowd of 20,103 fans packed the Wachovia Center in Philadelphia for Game Four of the Calder Cup finals between the Philadelphia Phantoms and Rosemont&#x27;s Chicago Wolves. The Wolves, Rochester Americans, Manitoba Moose, Hamilton Bulldogs, and Bridgeport Sound Tigers each saw attendance figures increase over ten percent from 2003 to 2004 in the AHL, with the Moose average attendance soaring 24.09 percent from the previous year. In the ECHL, the Gwinnett Gladiators, San Diego Gulls, Bakersfield Condors, and Charlotte Checkers also saw similar gains, with the Atlanta Thrashers-affiliated Gladiators receiving a gain of over 20 percent in attendance from the previous year.

However, the lockout negatively affected many minor-league players, where the influx of NHL players forced many to play in lower-level leagues for less money or out of jobs altogether.

In addition, other minor hockey leagues benefited from the lack of competition from the major professional league. The Ontario Hockey League was a particular beneficiary, with teams such as the London Knights and Saginaw Spirit garnering considerable attention. The lack of the Stanley Cup playoffs also created increased interest in the 2005 Memorial Cup tournament with record TV ratings. Governor General of Canada Adrienne Clarkson mused publicly about the possibility of awarding the Stanley Cup to the best women&#x27;s hockey team that year, but this idea was so unpopular that instead the Clarkson Cup was created. The 2005 Allan Cup in Lloydminster also attracted elevated national media interest.

In the Western Hockey League, the Calgary Hitmen were the most watched team in North America, averaging 10,062 fans per game. Their season total of 362,227 shattered the WHL and CHL records and represented a 33% increase over 2003–04. The Vancouver Giants also experienced a massive increase, finishing second in the WHL with 302,403 fans going through the turnstiles.

====International hockey====
The lockout had a substantial effect on international tournaments run by the International Ice Hockey Federation. The most notable effect was observed in the 2005 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and Thief River Falls, Minnesota. With the NHL inactive, the top eligible U-20 players were not playing in that league and thus were available to their countries for the tournament. The country that benefitted most as a result was Canada. The Canadians not only ended a seven-year gold medal drought at this competition, they outscored their opponents 41–7 and defeated Russia 6–1 in the final game. Many analysts believe that the Canadian team was the most dominating ever in this tournament, aided in no small part by players such as Patrice Bergeron who could have expected to have commitments in the NHL.

At the time that the 2004–05 season was canceled, it was not immediately clear how the lockout would affect the 2005 World Ice Hockey Championships. Normally, NHL players from teams that failed to qualify for the Stanley Cup playoffs participate in this tournament. Since no playoffs were being held, theoretically all NHL players could participate. In reality, however, many NHL players declined to participate, and national teams were naturally reluctant to select players who lacked game conditioning. For all of the teams (including the North American ones), the bulk of the national teams&#x27; rosters consisted of players who were playing in Europe.

===Effects outside hockey===

Canadian sports fans also turned to the Canadian Football League, and the CFL recorded significant increases in attendance and television ratings during the final weeks of the 2004 CFL season compared to 2003, ultimately setting a new record for total playoff attendance. The league was able to hold onto at least some of these gains in 2005. The National Lacrosse League also saw a modest boost in attendance. Also in the United States, the National Basketball Association (NBA) also saw some big gains in attendance in markets which have both NHL and NBA teams; this is in part because the NHL and NBA season run in a similar time frame within the year and often play in the same venue. The National Football League (NFL) and Major League Baseball (MLB) also saw some minor gains in attendance in 2004–05. Major League Soccer (MLS) began to become profitable in 2004, which many believed to have been caused by the NHL lockout. To date, the MLS has operated with profit since 2004. 

The Philips Arena requested the Southeastern Conference to move the SEC Women&#x27;s Basketball Tournament out of their venue because of logistics, because the 55th NHL All-Star Game was scheduled for late January, while the SEC tournament was scheduled five weeks later. The resulting move led to the BI-LO Center, an ECHL arena 140 miles to the east in Greenville, South Carolina, hosting the tournament, drawing the ire of the NAACP, who wanted the SEC to ban the venue from hosting tournaments because of its location. Philips Arena was granted the NHL All-Star Game in 2008 as compensation.

<text>Malaysian Idol is the Malaysian version of the Idol Series that started in UK, similar to shows such as UK&#x27;s &quot;Pop Idol&quot; and &quot;American Idol&quot; in the franchise. This show is a contest to determine the best young singer in Malaysia, with the winner receiving a major record deal, although some runners-up have achieved enough fame to ink record deals of their own. Like any other &quot;Idol&quot; show, the winner is decided by public votes. The &quot;Malaysian Idol&quot; series has gained a following in Malaysia from people of all ages partly due to their interest in American Idol which had been introduced a few years prior. Malaysian Idol has been broadcast to Malaysian viewers via terrestrial television, 8TV and TV3.

The last few finalists of &quot;Malaysian Idol&quot; have become celebrities because they have their own following of fans who supported them throughout their appearance on &quot;Malaysian Idol&quot;.

Outside Malaysia, the show has become known worldwide for the audition of a Michael Jackson impersonator, which became a viral hit on the Internet because of his attempt to sing Billie Jean, gaining over 12 million views on YouTube.

== Overview ==
In &quot;Malaysian Idol&quot;, auditions were held for the top finalists. 
The first season was hosted by Soo Kui Jien and Sharifah Aleya. However, for the second season, Jien&#x27;s new co-host was Cheryl Samad. Malaysian Idol was also unique in presenting in a bilingual English/Malaysian format, Jien representing a large portion of the English dialogue and the Malaysian part primarily Aleya/Samad which would have been of aid to Paul Moss&#x27; appearance on the show.

In a nutshell, the Malaysian Idol competition follows the Idol Series&#x27; main concept. All rounds of competition are broadcast on television. Contestants who aspire to be singers sign up and audition for the preliminary round in front of three judges (refer Judges below). Successful candidates enter the next round. In the next phase, Idol contestants perform individually and in a group. This round of elimination is also known as the &quot;Theatre Elimination&quot; Round (equivalent to &quot;American Idol&quot;&#x27;s Hollywood Round) and their fate is again decided by the judges. The last phase involves weekly performances in front of an audience. The person with the fewest votes (as sent in by the audience throughout Malaysia through SMS and telephone calls) for each week, is eliminated. After each performance the judges will give their feedback; however they do not determine whether the contestant should stay or go. This goes on until the Malaysian Idol has been selected.

== Judges ==
As seen in the format for American Idol where there were two American and one British judges, two of the judges in Malaysian Idol were native Malaysians, and the other a New Zealander. Similarly, two out of three of Malaysian Idol judges were male.

The judges included:
*Roslan Aziz — Malaysian musician, album producer, songwriter. singer
*Fauziah Latiff — Malaysian singer, actress
*Paul Moss — New Zealand singer, songwriter, producer, recording company Positive Tone&#x27;s Artiste &amp; Repertoire (A&amp;R) director

== Malaysian Idol Coaches ==
*Aubrey Suwito - Music Director
*Juwita Suwito - Vocal Coach
*Michael Xavier Voon &amp; Petra Elaine Pedley- Performance Coaches

== Season 1 (2004)==

Jaclyn Victor won the title as the first Malaysian Idol in 2004 while the runner-up was Faradina Mohd. Nadzir (Dina).

The Malaysian Idol winner&#x27;s single is &quot;Gemilang&quot;, written by &quot;Malaysian Idol&quot; music director Aubrey Suwito.

===Finalists===

===Elimination===

==Season 2 (2005)==

After the first selection round (auditions were open to the public throughout Malaysia), and the three Theater Elimination or &quot;workshop&quot; sessions were over, there were 11 finalists left. Every week of Malaysian Idol has resulted in with the contestant with the fewest votes going out of the contest.

===Finalists===
(ages stated at time of contest)

These finalists released a compilation album entitled Malaysian Idol 2.

===Elimination===



The winner of 2005 season of &quot;Malaysian Idol&quot; was Daniel Lee Chee Hun (Daniel) who defeated Norhanita Hamzah (Nita) (Note: Daniel has always been in the top position throughout the weeks leading to the finals, as mentioned occasionally in the show). According to the press conference, Daniel garnered a massive 1.2 million out of 1.67 million votes (or about 68%) by the audience to win the finals (the voting time window was approximately 24 hours after the final show). The final show was on September 23, 2005, and the results show was on September 24, 2005, and held in Genting Highlands&#x27;s Arena of Stars. On the live broadcast aired on TV3 and 8TV, the three judges spoke highly of both the finalists.

The second season&#x27;s theme (winner&#x27;s) song is &quot;Mimpi&quot;, written by Pot, a member of the Malaysian band Innuendo. It was also through this song that enabled Daniel to shine in the finals.

=== Cancellation ===
On 12 March 2006, 8TV&#x27;s CEO announced that &quot;Malaysian Idol&quot; would not return for a third season. However, the show was succeeded by &quot;One in a Million&quot; (2006-2009), another reality singing competition that used a similar format.

<text>Nicolette Louisa Palikat (born 1 November 1985) is a Malaysian American singer from Tambunan, Sabah. She reached top 12 in the first season of Malaysian Idol. Nikki is known for her vocal belting and her ability to sing in the whistle register.

==Career==
While a university student, she successfully auditioned for Malaysian Idol in Kuching, Sarawak, impressing the judges with her rendition of Mariah Carey&#x27;s Emotions. She eventually progressed through to the &#x27;Final 12&#x27; of the competition. After six weeks, Nikki was voted out on 12 September 2004 to some controversy, as she had been seen as a favourite to win by Malaysian Idol judge, Paul Moss.

The following lists Nikki&#x27;s &quot;Malaysian Idol&quot; performances:
* Audition – Emotions – (Mariah Carey)
* Workshop – One Moment in Time – (Whitney Houston)
* Wildcard – The Voice Within – (Christina Aguilera)
* Top 12 – Crazy in Love – (Beyoncé)
* Top 10 – I Want You Back – (The Jackson 5)
* Top 8 – Against All Odds – (Phil Collins)
* Top 7 – I&#x27;m with You – (Avril Lavigne)
* Top 6 – Emotion – (Destiny&#x27;s Child)

Originally planning to continue with her studies after her exit from the competition, Nikki secured a recording contract with Artistes United Records and released her debut album, &quot;Maharani&quot;, in Malaysia on 28 November 2005. The title means &#x27;Empress&#x27; in Malay. This album showcases Nikki&#x27;s abilities in the whistle register, with one critic mentioning it as &quot;whistling a la Mariah Carey.&quot; The ballad &#x27;Pinta&#x27; marked Nikki&#x27;s official debut in the music industry.

Nikki&#x27;s second single, Caramu in which she collaborated with fellow artiste, Zahid, won an award for the best vocal duo category at the Anugerah Era 2006, a Malaysian music awards ceremony.

Following Caramu, Nikki teamed up with fellow Malaysian and Sabahan singer, Yanie, and both featured in Ning Baizura&#x27;s August single release, Drama.

On 28 December 2008, Nikki released her second album, &quot;Hawa&quot; featuring the singles &quot;Relakan&quot; and &quot;Selamat Tinggal&quot;.

==Personal life==
Palikat married Malaysian music composer and producer Audi Mok in June 2009. They have one son. In 2022, she revealed that she and Mok had split back in March 2021.

Palikat is Catholic.

<doc id="931034" wikidata="Q7578748" url="?curid=931034" title="Splitting theorem">
<text>In the mathematical field of differential geometry, there are various splitting theorems on when a pseudo-Riemannian manifold can be given as a metric product. The best-known is the Cheeger–Gromoll splitting theorem for Riemannian manifolds, although there has also been research into splitting of Lorentzian manifolds.

==Cheeger and Gromoll&#x27;s Riemannian splitting theorem==
Any connected Riemannian manifold has an underlying metric space structure, and this allows the definition of a &quot;geodesic line&quot; as a map such that the distance from to equals for arbitrary and . This is to say that the restriction of to any bounded interval is a curve of minimal length that connects its endpoints.

In 1971, Jeff Cheeger and Detlef Gromoll proved that if a geodesically complete and connected Riemannian manifold of nonnegative Ricci curvature contains any geodesic line, then it must split isometrically as the product of a complete Riemannian manifold with . The proof was later simplified by Jost Eschenburg and Ernst Heintze. In 1936, Stefan Cohn-Vossen had originally formulated and proved the theorem in the case of two-dimensional manifolds, and Victor Toponogov had extended Cohn-Vossen&#x27;s work to higher dimensions, under the special condition of nonnegative sectional curvature.

The proof can be summarized as follows. The condition of a geodesic line allows for two Busemann functions to be defined. These can be considered a normalized Riemannian distance function to the two endpoints of the line. From the fundamental &quot;Laplacian comparison theorem&quot; proved earlier by Eugenio Calabi, these functions are both superharmonic under the Ricci curvature assumption. Either of these functions could be negative at some points, but the triangle inequality implies that their sum is nonnegative. The strong maximum principle implies that the sum is identically zero and hence that each Busemann function is in fact (weakly) a harmonic function. Weyl&#x27;s lemma implies the infinite differentiability of the Busemann functions. Then, the proof can be finished by using Bochner&#x27;s formula to construct parallel vector fields, setting up the de Rham decomposition theorem. Alternatively, the theory of Riemannian submersions may be invoked.

As a consequence of their splitting theorem, Cheeger and Gromoll were able to prove that the universal cover of any closed manifold of nonnegative Ricci curvature must split isometrically as the product of a closed manifold with a Euclidean space. If the universal cover is topologically contractible, then it follows that all metrics involved must be flat.

==Lorentzian splitting theorem==
In 1982, Shing-Tung Yau conjectured that a particular Lorentzian version of Cheeger and Gromoll&#x27;s theorem should hold. Proofs in various levels of generality were found by Jost Eschenburg, Gregory Galloway, and Richard Newman. In these results, the role of geodesic completeness is replaced by either the condition of global hyperbolicity or of &quot;timelike&quot; geodesic completeness. The nonnegativity of Ricci curvature is replaced by the &quot;timelike convergence condition&quot; that the Ricci curvature is nonnegative in all timelike directions. The geodesic line is required to be timelike.

<text>John Adolphus (1768–1845) was an English barrister and historian.

==Life==
Born 7 August 1768, he was of German background. His grandfather had been domestic physician to Frederick the Great, and wrote a French romance, &quot;Histoire des Diables Modernes&quot;. His father lived for a time in London supported by a wealthy uncle, who provided the son with education, and sent him at the age of fifteen to be placed in the office of his agent for some estates in St. Kitts. Adolphus returned to London after something over a year, and was articled to an attorney. He was admitted an attorney in 1790, but after a few years began to write.

The success of his history and the influence of Archdeacon William Coxe brought Adolphus into close connection with Henry Addington, then prime minister. Addington put him on a salary, for political services which included electioneering and pamphleteering. He entered the Inner Temple, and in 1807 he was called to the bar.

He joined the home circuit, and devoted himself specially to criminal work. At the Old Bailey he worked his way to the leadership, which he retained for many years. The first of his notable forensic successes was his defence in 1820 of Arthur Thistlewood and the other Cato Street conspirators. Among the cases in which he subsequently distinguished himself were the trials of John Thurtell, James Greenacre, and François Courvoisier.

Within a few weeks of entering his seventy-seventh year, he died on 16 July 1845.

==Works==
He wrote &quot;Biographical Memoirs of the French Revolution&quot; (1799) and &quot;History of England from the Accession of George III to the Conclusion of Peace in 1783&quot; (1802), and other historical and biographical works.

He acquired the friendship of Archdeacon Coxe by helping him in the &quot;Memoirs of Sir Robert Walpole&quot;. In 1799 appeared his first acknowledged work, &quot;Biographical Memoirs of the French Revolution&quot;, strongly anti-Jacobin in tone, and differing widely from the &quot;Biographical Anecdotes of the Founders of the French Republic&quot;, published anonymously in 1797, and often erroneously ascribed to Adolphus. He wrote the memoirs in the &quot;British Cabinet&quot; (1799), a series of portraits of more or less distinguished Englishmen and Englishwomen, from Margaret of Richmond to the second Lord Hardwicke.

In 1802 appeared his major work, the &quot;History of England from the Accession of George III to the Conclusion of Peace in 1783&quot;. It included summaries of parliamentary debates, and Adolphus was praised for it in issue No. 2 of the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;. The papers of George Dodington, 1st Baron Melcombe had been placed at Adolphus&#x27;s disposal in the preparation of his history, and they enabled him to throw light on the conduct of Lord Bute, and on the political transactions of the earlier years of the reign of George III, who, in conversation, commented on the accuracy with which some of the first measures taken after his accession had been described.

In 1803 Adolphus published a &quot;History of France&quot; from 1790 to the Peace of Amiens, and a pamphlet, &quot;Reflections on the Causes of the present Rupture with France&quot;, in vindication of the policy of the English government. According to his son Adolphus wrote &quot;A Letter to Robert Ward, Esq., M.P.&quot; (1804), to Robert Ward who had written a defence of William Pitt the Younger in his party quarrel with Addington.

In 1818 he published, in four volumes, &quot;The Political State of the British Empire, containing a general view of the domestic and foreign possessions of the crown, the laws, commerce, revenue, offices, and other establishments, civil and military&quot;; in 1824, &quot;Observations on the Vagrant Act and some other Statutes, and on the Powers and Duties of Justices of the Peace&quot;, in the main a protest against some &quot;nanny state&quot; legislation of the time; and in 1839 the &quot;Memoirs&quot; of John Bannister the actor, whom he had known well.

His history had gone through four editions when, in his seventieth year, Adolphus began the task of continuing it to the death of George III. Vol. I. was re-issued in 1840. Vol. VII., closing with the fall of the Addington administration, appeared in 1845, and Adolphus was working on the eighth volume when he died.

Adolphus wrote several chapters of Charles Rivington&#x27;s &quot;Annual Register&quot; and papers for the &quot;British Critic&quot;. His final contributions to periodical literature were biographical sketches of William Garrow and John Gurney for the &quot;Law Magazine&quot;. The anonymous &quot;Memoirs of Queen Caroline&quot; (London, 2 vols., 1824) have been ascribed to him.

==Family==
In 1793 he married Miss Martha Elizabeth Leycester (1765-1842), daughter of Susanna née Hamner (1740-1805) and Rev Ralph Mort Leycester (1737-1803); a lady &quot;of good family and little fortune&quot;. Their children were:

: Moses Joseph Adolphus (1790-?) who emigrated to the U.S.

: John Leycester Adolphus (1795–1862) was an English lawyer, jurist and author.

: Susanna Elizabeth Adolphus (1795-?), died young.

: Martha Emilia &#x27;Emily&#x27; Adolphus (1798-1884) who married Andrew Henderson (1800-1868) in 1847.

After his death his daughter Emily wrote &quot;Recollections of the Public Career and Private Life of the Late John Adolphus The Eminent Barrister and Historian, with Extracts from His Diaries&quot;.

<text>The Copenhagen S-train (), the S-train of Copenhagen, Denmark, is a key part of public transport in the city. It is a hybrid urban-suburban rail serving most of the Copenhagen urban area, and is analogous to the S-Bahn systems of Berlin, Vienna and Hamburg. The trains connect the Copenhagen inner city with Hillerød, Klampenborg, Frederikssund, Farum, Høje-Taastrup and Køge. There are of double track with 87 S-train stations, of which eight are in neighbouring towns outside greater Copenhagen.

The S-train is run by DSB S-tog A/S while Banedanmark owns the tracks and signals. Rail services are operated by &quot;Fourth Generation&quot; S-trains divided into 104 8-car train sets (Class SA) and 31 4-car train sets (Class SE).

The system operates in tandem with the separately owned Copenhagen Metro which operates in the city centre, Frederiksberg and Amager. The two systems carry 700,000 passengers daily with S-tog serving more than 357,000 passengers a day.

S-tog is complemented by regional trains, local diesel-powered trains within Metropolitan Copenhagen, an extensive bus network, and two lines of shuttle boats called harbour buses. The city&#x27;s bus terminals are often adjacent to an S-train or Metro station. The different networks use a common system for fare zones and tickets.

== History ==
The lines used by the Copenhagen S-Train suburban rail system in Denmark are six radial and two connecting rail lines, built during the late 19th and early 20th centuries as commuter transport to and from the residential areas around the city centre.

The S-line aimed to electrify the existing local rail network around Copenhagen. Preparations for the decision were made in the &quot;Electrification Commission of 1926&quot;, following several other approaches to plans. The Commission presented a report in 1929, in which it proposed that short-distance lines from Copenhagen to Klampenborg, as well as possibly Frederiksberg-Vanløse-Hellerup, should be electrified first – then the line to Holte, when the double track Holte-Hillerød was taken into use for the ordinary trains. After consideration of the proposal by DSB, the section to Valby was added as the first stage for electrification of the section to Ballerup, and a bill was submitted and adopted in April 1930.

The first section opened on 3 April 1934, and ran from Klampenborg to Hellerup and Vanløse to Frederiksberg. It was the first electrically powered railway in Denmark.

Stations were marked from the beginning with an &quot;S&quot; similar to those in the Berlin S-train system. There is a debate around the origin of the name &quot;S-tog&quot; (&quot;S-train&quot;) with many citing that the name of the system came from a competition in the newspaper &quot;Politiken&quot;. The judges&#x27; panel cited a long list of possible explanations for the &quot;S&quot; in S-tog, including: &quot;state railways&quot; (&quot;statsbaner&quot;), &quot;city railway&quot; (&quot;stadsbane&quot;), &quot;Greater Copenhagen&quot; (&quot;Storkøbenhavn&quot;), &quot;sun&quot; (&quot;sol&quot;), &quot;lake&quot; (&quot;sø&quot;), &quot;forest&quot; (&quot;skov&quot;), &quot;beach&quot; (&quot;strand&quot;), &quot;snow&quot; (&quot;sne&quot;), &quot;skiing&quot; (&quot;ski&quot;), &quot;skating&quot; (&quot;skøjteløb&quot;), and &quot;sleigh&quot; (&quot;slæde&quot;), all of which start with an S in Danish. Larsen and Poulsen, however, challenge that this basis for the system name as an urban myth and that DSB had already determined the name. The names, though, demonstrate that the initial marketing of the S-trains emphasized recreational day trips &quot;from&quot; the city &quot;to&quot; the countryside.

Hellerup-to-Hillerød and Svanemøllen-to-Farum were existing lines reorganized into the new network, as was the line between Frederikssund and Valby. The section Valby – Vanløse opened in 1941, was extended to Ballerup in 1949, and then finally to Frederikssund in 1989. The system had single tracks between Ballerup and Veksø until 2000 and between Veksø and Frederikssund until 2002.

New tracks were established along the existing Valby – Høje Taastrup line between Valby – Glostrup, opening in 1953. It was extended to Taastrup in 1963, and then in 1986 to its final destination at Høje Taastrup.

A completely new line, the Køge Bay line, was built between Dybbølsbro and Køge in four stages: Dybbølsbro to Vallensbæk opened in 1972; Vallensbæk to Hundige in 1976; Hundige to Solrød Strand in 1979; and then finally to Køge in 1983.

The Frederiksberg – Vanløse – Grøndal line was closed with the arrival of the Copenhagen metro. The former Godsbaneringen Grøndal – Ny Ellebjerg route has been converted to an S-line.

Originally no letters or numbers were used for the individual lines, but with the introduction of the summer timetable on 14 May 1950, the system moved to line letters.

The S-train system has been entirely one-person operated since 1978.

== Network ==

The network consists of a central section through downtown Copenhagen that splits into three radial lines at each end, reaching the outer suburbs and neighbouring towns. The radial sections are connected to each other via that central section. The system is designed so that a train from any southern radial can continue along any of the three northern and vice versa. In the city centre, the trains run underground in two tunnel sections which are also served by regional trains. Elsewhere the tracks are in the open, occasionally above or below street level.

The three northern radials are:
* Farumbanen (formerly &quot;Hareskovbanen&quot;) &quot;(the Farum line)&quot; to Farum. &quot;(B &amp; Bx lines)&quot;
* Nordbanen &quot;(the north line)&quot; to Holte and Hillerød. &quot;(A &amp; E lines)&quot;
* The Klampenborg line to Klampenborg. &quot;(C line)&quot;
The three southern radials are:
* Køge Bay Line to Hundige, Solrød Strand and Køge. &quot;(A &amp; E lines)&quot;
* Vestbanen &quot;(the west line)&quot; to Høje Taastrup. &quot;(B &amp; Bx lines)&quot;
* Frederikssund line to Ballerup and Frederikssund &quot;(C &amp; H lines)&quot;
The six radials are additionally connected by
* Ringbanen &quot;(the Ring or F line)&quot; going between Hellerup in the north and København Syd in the south. The Ring line is connected to the Nordbanen (north line) and Klampenborg Line at Hellerup, but it is normally only used in connection with the Klampenborg line. The Ring line has an elevated section including Nørrebro station, which offers a view of some of the most populous areas of the city, Nørrebro and Nordvest. The junctions of the Farumbane with the other lines at Ryparken and Svanemøllen include a short elevated section and a short northbound tunnel, respectively.

The average distance between stations is 2.0 km, shorter in the city core and inner boroughs, longer at the end of lines that serve suburbs.

== Lines ==
Since December 2020, there have been seven lines running across the network. A, B, C and F run all week, E and H Monday to Friday, and Bx is a support line that operates only during the rush hour.

All stations are served at least every 10 minutes until the evening. Train departures occur approximately every two minutes at the stations on the city core route; all lines except the F (Ring) Line use the same path. On most suburban lines the trains depart every five minutes. On Sundays these time intervals are doubled.

Originally, no letters or numbers were used for the individual lines, but the timetables from 14 May 1950 for the Klampenborg, Holte and Frederiksberg lines were designated as sections 1a, 1b and 1c. Those lines became A, B and F respectively while simultaneously a new line C was created.

In 1963, a subordinate x (for extra) was introduced to rush hour lines with line Bx as the first. From 1979 to 1989, some lines which only ran during daytime on weekdays daytime, were characterized by doubling the line letter, Bb and Cc. From 1989 to 1993, they got ordinary line letters. Then, they switched to a system with a subordinate &quot;+&quot;, A +, B + and H +. This system was dropped in 2007 with the introduction of 10-minute operation on the key daytime lines.

== Stations ==

Of the 86 stations, 32 are located within the central ticket fare zones 1 and 2. Another 35 stations are located within the Copenhagen Urban area. Therefore, just 17 stations can be said to be located in suburbs.

Forty-six stations are elevated, twenty-one are street level, fifteen are below street, 4 have different levels and one is underground. Within the city core (zones 1 &amp; 2) the stations are either elevated or lower than the street level.

Most stations consist of two tracks, each with its own side platform or an upper platform in between. At terminals and hubs, however, there may be several tracks and platforms depending on local conditions. Older stations are often designed with a station building where there used to be ticket sales, but after the 1970s gradually moved to unmanned stations with ticket machines, the design of new stations has typically become simpler. There are still kiosks with the possibility of buying tickets at some stations, but in a number of cases the old ticket sales outlets have been re-purposed, or the buildings have been demolished.

At most of the termini other types of train are available for travel to the more remote towns in the metropolitan area (&quot;L-tog&quot;, diesel-powered local trains) or to the rest of Zealand and the other islands between the Great Belt and Øresund (&quot;regionaltog&quot;, regional trains). Trains across Øresund to Scania and its main city, Malmö, connect with the S-train network in the city centre.

== Facilities ==
Free Wi-Fi Internet access was available in the S-train system. It was shut off on Jan 1st 2020 due to not being popular.

== Ticketing ==
The S-tog along with buses, regional trains, and Copenhagen metro uses Rejsekort, an electronic ticketing system across Denmark. Passengers can also buy paper single-trip tickets at ticket vending machines with cash or credit cards or at 7-Eleven kiosks at the train and metro stations or with the &#x27;DOT Tickets&#x27; iOS or Android app. The city is divided into travel zones, and the price of a journey depends on how many journeys are travelled through (minimum 2 zones). The price is the same no matter if you take a bus, train or S-Train, and a 20% discount is applied when traveling outside of peak times if using Rejsekort.

Both the City Pass and Copenhagen Card aimed at tourists are accepted on the system.

== Future ==

Since 30 trains per hour per direction now run between Dybbølsbro and Svanemøllen, the construction of a new tunnel, running north–south in densely populated areas, has been discussed.

Proposals to extend the Vestbanen &quot;(West)&quot; line from Høje Taastrup to &quot;Roskilde&quot; along existing tracks, have been discussed on several occasions, and was under investigation as of 2019.

Extension from Klampenborg to Elsinore (converting the Kystbane railway to S-train standard) would prove more difficult, but the issue has been mentioned. The major problem is a lack of spare capacity in the central tunnel.

Connecting Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup, to the network has been proposed, although it is already served by both regional trains and the Copenhagen Metro.

The Danish Transport Authority (Trafikstyrelsen) has suggested converting the F-line of the S-train network to metro standard as an M5 line, The only current interchange between the F line and the metro network are Flintholm Station and Nørrebro Station.

The F line is planned to be driverless and to run 24/7 in 2024/2026.

==Technical overview==
S-trains run on standard-gauge tracks and are powered via overhead wires. The voltage is 1,500 or 1,650 volts DC (negative overhead wire), indicating that it varies considerably with the loading and distance from a feeder station. Power is drawn from the national grid through 38 feeder stations. They have to be relatively close to each other because the large currents in the overhead wires (caused by the relatively low voltage) would lead to unacceptably large transmission losses otherwise.

From 1975 until 2022, the primary signalling system was a proprietary fixed-block cab signalling system called that transmitted data to the trains via low-bandwidth audio frequency induction loops between the rails. Varying the combination of frequencies allowed up to 15 different instructions or commandssuch as stops and permitted speedsto be indicated to the train. Use of the permitted speed encoding provided full supervision of train speed; when a train running under HKT control entered a block with a lower target speed than the train&#x27;s current speed it would initiate service braking until the two speeds matched. This, combined with the fact that all S-train stock had similar braking characteristics, allowed the assumption of reduced braking distances and the use of fixed blocks significantly shorter than on conventionally-signalled railways.

Lineside signals were provided for use when the HKT system was inoperative or when a non-equipped train needed to be driven on the line, but line capacity was significantly reduced as these signals only protected full-length blocks and had to be placed according to conservative braking distance assumptions.

In 2011, infrastructure operator Banedanmark awarded Siemens Mobility a contract to replace HKT with its Trainguard MT communications-based train control system (CBTC), on the grounds that the HKT installation was reaching the end of its life and becoming increasingly unreliable. The CBTC system employs the moving block principle, whereby a central controller continuously tracks the precise location and speed of every train on the line and adjusts the instructions issued to drivers accordingly. On the S-train network this has allowed a reduction in minimum separation between consecutive trains (&#x27;headway&#x27;) from 120 seconds to only 90.

Hillerød–Jægersborg was the first section to be converted, as its F-HKT installation (&#x27;simplified&#x27; HKT) had the oldest hardware and did not deliver the same level of train protection as the other parts of the system. The new CBTC system entered service on this section on 29 February 2016. Further conversions continued through to 2022, when in late September the final three routes (Valby–Frederikssund, Valby–Høje Taastrup, and Sydhavn–Køge) were switched over to CBTC operation.

==Rolling stock==
The S-train has seen four types of rolling stock. Currently, only fourth-generation trains operate, after the retirement of the second and third generation trains in 2007 and 2006 respectively.

===First generation (1934-1978)===

The first generation (DSB class MM-FM-MM) was introduced in 1934 at the opening of the network, and consisted of three carriages per train set (2 motor cars and 1 trailer car), manufactured from 1934 to 1962. Frichs A/S supplied the electric components while Scandia (now Bombardier Transportation Denmark) supplied the car bodies and non-electric components. They were retired in 1978, and one was used as a heritage train until 2003, when DSB decided to discontinue its use. They are the longest serving S-train rolling stock to date, in continuous service for 44 years.
===Second generation (1967-2007)===

The second generation (DSB class MM-FU-MU-FS) was built from 1967 to 1978 by Frichs A/S (motored cars) and Scandia (trailer cars). They saw the introduction of the signature red colour that was to characterize subsequent generations of rolling stock.

There have been three different formations: the first (2-car), had a motor car with first-class seating (could be converted to second class) and a second-class trailer; the second (2-car), had second-class seating only; and the third (4-car), a motor car with driver&#x27;s cab, a trailer, a motored trailer and a driving trailer without motor.

They ran until 7 January 2007. All have been scrapped except for a few set aside for museum use. An official ceremony was held on 3 February 2007 with the last trip. One train is set to be restored by DJK (Danish Railroad Club), who are now the owners of the train, so it can eventually make its way back to the tracks on special occasions such as anniversaries.
===Third generation (1986-2006)===

The third generation (DSB class FC-MC-MC-FC) were built by the Swedish industrial firm ASEA from 1979 to 1986. Despite possessing a much improved level of passenger comfort as compared to the previous two generations of rolling stock, it suffered a much higher rate of mechanical failure as compared to its predecessors. Twelve trains in 4-car formation (48 cars) were built (a further 32 4-car trains were not realised), and it first entered service in 1986 on the Vestbane and the Nordbane (B service) between Holte and Høje Taastrup. They were the first S-train rolling stock to feature electronic chopper control. 

In 1995, 4 trains (16 cars) were scrapped and the remaining 8 trains (32 cars) were refurbished and reassigned to the Ringbanen (F service), where they remained in service until an incident where a child was trapped between the doors forced their early retirement in June 2006. When attempts to sell them failed, they were transported to Holbæk harbour on 23 August 2007 in order to be scrapped.
===Fourth generation (1996-present)===
The fourth generation, in service since 1996, are distinguished by their plump appearance due to their curved sides.

Two variants are in use, one of eight cars referred to as (formed of vehicles SA-SB-SC-SD-SD-SC-SB-SA) and one of four cars referred to as (formed SE-SF-SG-SH)

These are articulated units supplied by Alstom-LHB and Siemens with prefabricated friction stir welded aluminium roof panels made by Marine Aluminium from Sapa extrusions, and were manufactured from 1996 to 2007. The cars are shorter than conventional railway cars; each has a single axle under one end, the other end being supported by the neighbouring car. (The end cars have two axles each). They have automatic Scharfenberg couplers at the ends; in peak hours most trains consist of two coupled units, giving a total train length of 168 meters. They have video surveillance to ensure passenger and staff security and to prevent acts of vandalism. These trains introduced air conditioning in the interior and regenerative braking to the network, increasing energy efficiency. At present, there are 105 8-car trains (840 cars).

An accident involving an 8-car fourth-generation train in 2002 caused it to be scrapped, necessitated the construction of 4-car sets to relieve the shortage of trains. These 4-car units (DSB class SE-SH, also known as Litra SE) can run solo in low-traffic intervals. At present, there are 31 4-car trains (124 cars) serving the S-train network.

The top speed of fourth-generation trains is , although on many parts of the network their speed is limited to to due to the limitations of the signalling system, and on the Ringbane they travel at .

===Fifth generation (2030- )===
The fifth generation of S-trains will be fully automatic. It is planned to introduce them in around 2030, initially on the Ringbanen line. In September 2023, DSB published a shortlist of three prequalified bidders to manufacture the 226 new trains. In 2025 the contract will be awarded to either Alstom, CAF or a Siemens/Stadler consortium.

<text>Markuelia is a genus of fossil worm-like bilaterian animals allied to Ecdysozoa and known from strata of Lower Cambrian to Lower Ordovician age containing five species.

An advanced X-ray imaging technique called X-ray tomographic microscopy has been applied to splendidly preserved, uncrushed &quot;Markuelia&quot; fossils found in Hunan province in southern China and in eastern Siberia. When details in features smaller than one micrometre across can be observed, these fossils are seen to represent many developmental stages, from the first cell divisions to the time of hatching; therefore they offer a unique opportunity to study the development of Lower Cambrian animals.

The features observed indicate that the genus had a mouth surrounded by a ring of teeth, an alimentary canal, and an anus.

However the characters preserved are inconclusive regarding the genus&#x27; taxonomic affinity; it can at best be placed in the scalidophoran total group, since it is currently impossible to ally it with the Priapulids or other scalidophora.

<text>Cardiff city centre () is the city centre and central business district of Cardiff, Wales. The area is tightly bound by the River Taff to the west, the Civic Centre to the north and railway lines and two railway stations – Central and Queen Street – to the south and east respectively. Cardiff became a city in 1905.

The city centre in Cardiff consists of principal shopping streets: Queen Street, St. Mary&#x27;s Street and the Hayes, as well as large shopping centres, and numerous arcades and lanes that house some smaller, specialized shops and boutiques.

The city centre has undergone a number of redevelopment projects, including St. David&#x27;s 2, which extended the shopping district southwards, creating 100 new stores and a flagship John Lewis, the only branch in Wales and the largest outside London. Compared to nearby cities, the new St David&#x27;s Centre has more retail space than the whole of Newport or Swansea.

In 2008–9, the annual of shoppers was 55 million, and is expected to have risen to 66 million by 2009–10. Cardiff is the sixth most successful shopping destination in the United Kingdom – behind London, Glasgow, Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool.

==History==

Cardiff was granted city status by Edward VII in 1905.

In the 1960s, planners described Cardiff city centre as &quot;worn out, inconvenient, drab and dangerous&quot;. The centre had escaped the extensive wartime bomb damage inflicted on other cities, so little redevelopment took place in the 1950s and 1960s. The Buchanan Plan of 1964 envisaged a highly ambitious extended city centre, crossed with urban motorways. The council scrapped the proposed motorway network and focused on the small commercial core of the city; its proposed redevelopment scheme, in partnership with a private developer, would have seen almost all of the city centre (except St Mary Street and Working Street) demolished, replaced by modernist office towers of up to 21 storeys and pedestrianised decks linking multistorey car parks to covered shopping malls.

By the time the legal agreement to implement &#x27;Centreplan 70&#x27; was signed, the 1973 property crash had made it unviable. However, one legacy of the scheme was the future segregation of office and retail development, with the west end of Newport Road as the principal office area with secondary concentrations on Churchill Way, Greyfriars Road and Westgate Street.

Development in the 1970s and 80s was more piecemeal than envisaged in Centreplan, with the building of the St. David&#x27;s Centre and St David&#x27;s Hall, new multistorey car parks, and the grantsupported construction of the 14storey Holiday Inn (now the Marriott) and World Trade Centre (now the Cardiff International Arena), which gave a fillip to the city&#x27;s conference and exhibition business. In the mid–1980s developers returned to Queen Street, creating three mediumsized malls, helping it to become one of the best performing shopping streets in the country in terms of footfall and rental levels.

In the 1990s the Mill Lane cafe quarter was developed in partnership with the Welsh Development Agency, a pedestrian forecourt was created for the refurbished Central railway station, a new walkway was constructed alongside the Taff and the Millennium Stadium was built on the site of the National Stadium and Empire Pool. The latter became, according to official publicists, one of the icons of Cardiff&#x27;s new image.

==Castle Quarter==

The Castle Quarter includes some of Cardiff&#x27;s Victorian and Edwardian arcades: Castle Arcade, High Street Arcade and Duke Street Arcade, and principal shopping streets: St Mary Street, High Street, Castle Street and Duke Street.

Development of the area began in February 2010 and is expected to be completed by July 2011. Cardiff Council says that work to create the Castle Quarter as a pedestrian friendly environment for High Street and St Mary Street is designed to enhance the city centre.

===Castle Street/Duke Street/Kingsway===
Castle Street follows on from Cowbridge Road East from Canton and begins after Cardiff Bridge, over the River Taff. It becomes Duke Street after the junction with High Street before turning north and becoming Kingsway, leading to Cardiff Civic Centre. From west to east, streets that begin from the southern side of this stretch are Westgate Street, Womanby Street, High Street (St Marys Street), St Johns Street (The Hayes), Queen Street and Greyfriars Road. Cardiff Castle and Bute Park dominate the northern side of the street. On the southern side are pubs, bars, retail and hotel units. Castle Arcade and Duke Street Arcades begin from this stretch.

===St. Mary Street and High Street===


St. Mary Street () and High Street (). The former street is named after the 11th century church of St. Mary, the largest in Cardiff until it was destroyed by the Bristol Channel floods of 1607. Today the stretch of road is the home of a number of bars, night clubs and restaurants, as well as branches of many major banks. Also fronting onto the street is Howells department store, which stretches from just after Cardiff Central Market to the corner of Wharton Street. From August 2007 the street was closed to private vehicles, leaving only buses, cycles and taxis allowed to access the whole street. The street is usually closed to all traffic every Friday and Saturday night to allow the efflux from night clubs and pubs located in that part of the street to clear. It is also closed when major events take place such as at the Millennium Stadium. The Prince Of Wales is a prominent J D Wetherspoon establishment at the junction with Wood Street, which leads to Central Station. At the northern end of the street is Castle Street and Cardiff Castle. To the south is Callaghan Square.

===Womanby Street===

Womanby Street is one of Cardiff&#x27;s oldest streets. It is known for its small, independent live music venues and is home to Clwb Ifor Bach. It is accessed from Castle Street, between Westgate Street and High Street.

==Queen Street and vicinity==
Queen Street () is the main thoroughfare in the city, now wholly pedestrianised. Most of Queen Street, from the castle moat to Dumfries Place, used to be called Crockherbtown (Crockherbtown Lane can still be found off Park Place), but the street was renamed in honour of Queen Victoria in 1886. Queen Street was pedestrianised in 1974 and is served by Cardiff Queen Street railway station on Station Terrace. It meets Dumfries Place/Newport Road at its eastern end, Duke Street/Castle Street at its western, and Park Place approximately halfway along. Further down Park Place is the New Theatre, a local landmark is Principality House, head office of the Principality Building Society. To the north running parallel is Greyfriars Road, referring to the site of an old monastery, a traditional office location that has recently seen conversion to bars, apartments and hotels as offices move to the new business parks on the edge of the city, or to the better connected southern end of the city centre.

Charles Street, named after the landowner (and twice Cardiff mayor) Charles Vachell, was originally built in the 1840s as luxury housing. When Cardiff&#x27;s new drainage was being devised, in 1849, Charles Street was described as Cardiff&#x27;s &quot;principal street&quot;. It joins the north side of Queen Street about halfway along its length. The street became more commercial later in the 1800s. In the 1970s it became the home of the Welsh Arts Council&#x27;s &quot;Oriel&quot; gallery. It is also the location of St Davids Catholic Cathedral.

==Cathays Park (Civic Centre)==

Cathays Park is the civic centre of Cardiff. The Edwardian architecture of Cardiff City Hall, National Museum and Gallery of Wales, Cardiff University, Cardiff Crown Court, and the administrative headquarters of the Welsh Government dominate the area. Behind the City Hall is the Welsh National War Memorial. Bute Park also dominates the northwest of the area, running behind Cardiff Castle along the River Taff southward to Westgate Street and northward to Gabalfa. Cardiff&#x27;s Winter Wonderland ice rink and fairground returns to the front lawn of the City Hall every winter.

Boulevard de Nantes and Stuttgarter Strasse, named after Cardiff&#x27;s twin cities, run through the southern end and act as a northern bypass of parallel Queen Street for the A4161. To the west, it is connected to Kingsway (leading to Castle Street and St Mary Street), and Dumfries Place/ Newport Road to the east. Park Place runs north to south through the area, linking it to the A470 in the north and Queen Street in the south

==Eastern city centre==

===Dumfries Place/Newport Road===
Dumfries Place is named after the Earl of Dumfries, a courtesy title given to the Marquis of Bute&#x27;s eldest son.

Newport Road, the major road leading east from Queen Street towards the neighbouring city of Newport, has been one of the prime office locations of central Cardiff since the 1960s. Some of the original buildings have been converted from office use to residential (e.g. The Aspect, Admiral House or hotel use including the Mercure Holland House. Occupancy of the remaining commercial property has increased, reflecting a shortage of office space in the city and there is now little scope for further conversion. Newport Road is also home to several buildings owned by Cardiff University, and Shand House, occupied by Cardiff Institute for the Blind.

Newport Road is also the site for the Cardiff Royal Infirmary, now providing long-term care and rehabilitation. The hospital once housed 500 beds and provided the main A&amp;E service for Cardiff before the University Hospital of Wales took over these functions.

===Churchill Way===

Churchill Way runs parallel to the west of Station Terrace (Cardiff Queen Street station) and joins Queen Street in the north and Bute Terrace in the south. The Capitol Centre is on the corner with Queen Street. Further along this road are office and modern apartment developments. The Cardiff office of the Driving Standards Agency, former British Gas offices in Helmont House (now a Premier Inn), and an Ibis Hotel are located on this street. The Cardiff office of the DSA subsequently closed.
Cardiff Masonic Hall occupies a major site on the corner of Guildford Street, adjacent to Churchill Way.

==Southwestern city centre==

===Wood Street===

Wood Street is the main access point for Cardiff Central railway and Central bus stations, with the latter undergoing reconstruction since early 2008. The street also had bus stands running along the length of the street as well. St David&#x27;s House, which ran most of its length, was demolished in 2019. Travelling westwards along this street are the Millennium Stadium, Millennium Plaza (with bars, night clubs, comedy clubs and a Vue cinema), Stadium House, &quot;Media Wales&quot; (offices of the South Wales Echo and Western Mail) and Southgate House, (which houses among other organisations the Cardiff offices for the Armed Forces).

===Central Square===

Central Square is a large public space between Wood Street and Cardiff Central railway station. It includes Cardiff bus station. In 2012 plans were announced to redevelop the square and rename it &#x27;Capital Square&#x27;.

===Westgate Street===
Westgate Street runs parallel just west of St Marys Street for about half of the latter&#x27;s length, linked by several alleys and lanes. Linking Castle Street and Wood Street, Cardiff Arms Park and the Millennium Stadium dominate its western side, whereas pubs and bars and hotels dominate its eastern side, with the Angel Hotel at the north end and the Royal Hotel to the south.

==The Hayes==

The Hayes () is where the department store Howells, Bwyty Hayes Island Snack Bar, Spillers Records, St David&#x27;s Hall, and elegant Victorian arcades are found. At the northern end is Cardiff&#x27;s Grade II* listed Old Library building (location of the Cardiff Story people&#x27;s museum).

The Hayes used to be home to David Morgan department store, an historic local landmark that dominated the shop fronts on the western side of The Hayes. Since its closure in 2005, the Grade Ilisted David Morgan Buildings have been subdivided into several retail units, and the upper floors converted into 56 luxury apartments. The exterior of the building received a comprehensive refurbishment, with the street clock being reinstated and the façade being restored to its original design, following many alterations since its construction in the late 1800s.

The eastern side of the Hayes is fronted by the new St. Davids 2 shopping centre. Prior to this it was home to Oxford Arcade, a post war construction that dated quickly and was underused given its central location.
The southern end features the John Lewis department store and the new Cardiff Central Library, which opened in March 2009. The previous Central Library closed in 2006 to make way for the construction of the St. David&#x27;s 2 shopping centre and was located a few hundred yards north-east on Bridge Street.

As part of the St Davids 2 development, the Hayes was pedestrianised and repaved. A new public square was created at its southern end with a large, interactive public artwork as its centrepiece called Alliance, a high sculpture consisting of a large stainless steel and enamelled metal ring and an arrow column, which was initially meant to feature lights that would rise and fall with the tide.

===Caroline Street===

Caroline Street is a pedestrianised link between St Mary Street and The Hayes. The street has been a host to all kinds of stores but has seen a surge in chip and kebab shops, and as such is commonly known as &quot;Chip Lane&quot; or &quot;Chip Alley&quot;. Around 2003, the north side of the street was redeveloped after the demolition of the old Brains Brewery. In its place were luxury flats encircling the Old Brewery Quarter, where new shops, bars and restaurants were erected. The pavement on the street was retiled as part of this development.

==Southeastern city centre==

===Callaghan Square===
This development, built in 1999, extends the central business district south of the mainline railway. Eventually the main development will include approximately 850,000 square feet (77,000 m2) of office space and other uses, of which approximately 350,000 square feet (33,000 m2) is complete (with the largest occupiers being Eversheds and British Gas). Further phases are unlikely to be built on a speculative basis. The initial masterplan suggest that the final phase, yet to be commenced, will also include hotel and residential use. Nearby offices on Tresillian Way (housing The AA, and Lloyds TSB Black Horse finance amongst others) plus further potential developments have turned the area relatively quickly into one of the largest office locations in Central Cardiff. Within a few years total office space in the area will exceed 1 million square feet (90,000 m2).

===Custom House Street/Bute Terrace/Adam Street===

These two roads have traditionally formed the southern and southeastern boundaries of the central business district of Cardiff, and in the 2000s have seen a great deal of new development. Recent developments such as the 23storey Altolusso apartment complex, and the Big Sleep Hotel were set to be joined by (from west to east), a new 11storey office building (on the site of the 120-year-old Central Hotel – destroyed by fire in early 2003; the Meridian Gate development (consisting of an 11storey apartment block and a 21storey Radisson SAS Hotel); a new John Lewis department store as part of the St. David&#x27;s 2 shopping expansion; Harlech Court (consisting of apartments and a rooftop restaurant); the University of South Wales&#x27;s ATRiuM campus (which opened in 2007) along with the 21storey Tŷ Pont Haearn student halls; and 3 further residential towers (of up to 13 storeys) with lower floor retail and commercial use.

==Access==

From the north, North Road (A470) meets the city centre at the junction with Castle Street and Boulevard de Nantes, with the latter route forming a northern and eastern bypass, meeting Newport Road (A4161) and then Callaghan Square, just south of the city centre.

From the west, the centre is accessed from Castle Street (A4161), Wood Street and Penarth Road (A4160), with St. Mary&#x27;s Street connecting the three, but is restricted to nocar traffic. Penarth Road terminates at Callaghan Square.

From the south, Lloyd George Avenue (A470), Bute Street and the Central Link (A4234) originate from Cardiff Bay and meet the city centre at Callaghan Square.

==Transport in the city centre==
===Bus===
The vast majority of Cardiff Bus services run to or through the city centre, approaching from the west along either Tudor Street or Westgate Street, from the north along North Road or Newport Road, from the east along Newport Road and from the south along Callaghan Square. Most services circle the city centre, creating a &quot;bus box&quot;. Some terminate or pass through Cardiff Central bus station, off Wood Street, which is currently being redeveloped. Other major interchanges include The Hayes, Dumfries Place, Westgate Street, Greyfriars Road and St. Mary Street, with taxi stands being located next to most of these.

The Baycar service circles the city centre every 10 minutes before continuing to Cardiff Bay.

===Rail===

The city centre is served by two railway stations. Cardiff Queen Street is in the east of the centre and is the city&#x27;s main hub for urban services to the rest of Cardiff, its valleys and the Vale of Glamorgan. Cardiff Central, located in the south of the city centre, is the largest station in the city and one of the busiest in the United Kingdom, focusing on mainline services. Central railway station is located next to Central bus station forming an interchange.

Cathays railway station, Grangetown railway station and Ninian Park railway station are all within of the centre serving edges of the city centre.

===Road===
The A470 bypasses the centre to the east running southbound to Cardiff Bay and northbound to North Cardiff, Pontypridd, Merthyr Tydfil and Brecon. The A470 road meets the A4232 at Cardiff Bay, leading to Culverhouse Cross and the M4 motorway, and also meets the A48 Carmarthen–Gloucester road at Gabalfa, north of the centre.

Some city centre taxis can be hailed. They are usually, but not always, black with a white bonnet or hackney carriages.

===Water===
The Cardiff Waterbus has stops at Cardiff Castle and Taff Mead Embankment, next to the Millennium Stadium, with services to Cardiff Bay.

===Cycle===
A cycle hire system, similar to those in other large cities, launched in September 2009, and included 70 bikes and 35 hire points (initially 7) around the centre and the south of the city. The cycle hire system was shut down in 2012.
 In early 2018, Nextbike offered a new cycle hire scheme with docking stations throughout the city.

<doc id="931061" wikidata="Q918244" url="?curid=931061" title="The Partner (Grisham novel)">
<text>The Partner (1997) is a legal/thriller novel by American author John Grisham. It was Grisham&#x27;s eighth novel.

==Plot==
It&#x27;s been four years since Patrick Lanigan, a junior partner in a law firm based in Biloxi, Mississippi, learned of the scheme, masterminded by his firm&#x27;s client, shipbuilding magnate Benny Aricia, to defraud the U.S. government via inflated and falsified contracts for the construction of U.S. Navy vessels. The firm&#x27;s senior partners didn&#x27;t include Lanigan in the plan, in which they stood to earn millions laundering the ill-gotten gains. Lanigan then devised a plan of his own, wherein he faked his death, stole $90 million from the secret offshore accounts where the firm had been hiding the ill-gotten gains, and then fled to South America. Since then, Lanigan started a new life with new-found love Eva. But Aricia has never forgotten the man who betrayed him and soon, his men find the former partner with intentions to do whatever it takes to recover the money. In a desperate bid, Lanigan gives power of attorney over his estate to Eva, then turns himself over to the FBI. Once returned to the U.S., Lanigan must fight multiple legal battles, in state, civil and federal courts, involving a former client, his estranged wife, and the highest levels of government, to protect the people he cares for, gain his freedom and, finally get back to Eva and the part of the fortune they secretly set aside.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;To call the plot of &quot;The Partner&quot; mechanical is at least partly a compliment: it is well-oiled, intricate and works smoothly. But its cynicism is remorseless.&quot; &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; called the book Grisham&#x27;s &quot;best-plotted novel yet,&quot; praising the &quot;masterfully bittersweet end.&quot;

==Film adaptation==
In January 2025, it was announced that Tom Holland had made a deal to star in and produce an adaptation of &quot;The Partner&quot; for Universal Pictures with screenwriter Graham Moore set to write the script. Previously, John Lee Hancock had intended to adapt &quot;The Partner&quot; as a follow-up to &quot;The Blind Side&quot; for New Regency before the project stalled in development.

<doc id="931062" wikidata="Q1541185" url="?curid=931062" title="National Guard (Nicaragua)">
<text>The Nicaraguan National Guard (, otherwise known as ) was a militia and a gendarmerie created in 1925 during the occupation of Nicaragua by the United States. It became notorious for human rights abuses and corruption under the regime of the Somoza family (1936–1979). The National Guard was disbanded when the Sandinistas came to power in 1979.

==Creation==

Prior to the U.S. occupation, the long period of civil strife had encouraged the development of a variety of private armies. The freshly elected government of President Carlos José Solórzano requested that the U.S. Marines (equally interested in central control) remain in Nicaragua until an indigenous internal security force could be trained; for that effect, the Nicaraguan government hired in 1925 a retired U.S. General to help set up a new paramilitary gendarmerie force, titled the &quot;Guardia Nacional de Nicaragua&quot; (National Guard of Nicaragua). That same year, U.S. forces left the country, but after a civil war broke out, they returned in 1926 and took over the command (and training) of the National Guard from 1927 to 1933, when it was returned to Nicaraguan control under the government of President Juan Bautista Sacasa.

President Sacasa, under political pressure from José María Moncada, who had been the leader of a rebel faction which later joined the government after U.S. mediation efforts, appointed Anastasio Somoza García as Chief Director of the National Guard in 1925. Besides being a nephew of Sacasa, Somoza Garcia was a trusted friend of Moncada and a supporter of the liberal revolt. He was trusted by the Americans due to his service as a translator to Henry Stimson during the 1927 peace conference, schooling in the U.S., and training under the U.S. Marines (apparently, as an officer in the National Guard).

After the departure of U.S. troops in 1933 (at the height of the Great Depression), the Sacasa government opened negotiations with the National Sovereignty Defense Army (EDSN) rebel guerrilla faction led by Augusto César Sandino, which had fought both the National Guard and the U.S. occupation forces. During the negotiations, Sandino insisted on the disbandment of the National Guard as a pre-condition for any peace agreement, leading Somoza Garcia to react ruthlessly by arresting and executing Sandino, in violation of a safe passage agreement Sacasa had given to the rebel leader. The National Guard then swiftly crushed Sandino&#x27;s EDSN, further weakening the Sacasa government. By this time, the National Guard had grown to some 3,000 troops.

After using the influence of the National Guard to support Sacasa&#x27;s re-election in 1936, Somoza Garcia flouted civilian power, installing military cronies in key civilian posts and then deposed Sacasa in a coup d&#x27;état held in June that same year. With an ally appointed interim president, Somoza Garcia then resigned from the position of Chief Director of the National Guard in order to meet the constitutional requirements to run for the presidency himself. Breaking with the Liberal party, he established the &quot;Partido Liberal Nacionalista&quot; (PLN, National Liberal Party) and Somoza was elected president in December with a reported margin of 64,000 of the 80,663 votes cast. On 1 January 1937, President Somoza Garcia reappointed himself again chief director of the National Guard, installing a corrupt military dictatorship linked to U.S. business interests that would last four decades.

==Somoza regime==
Somoza Garcia rapidly took complete control of Nicaraguan institutions including the National Guard, promoting allies and purging enemies. The National Guard was the backbone of a growing network of control, eventually including telecommunications, railroads, and key civilian agencies from customs to hospitals to tax collection. In 1938, Somoza Garcia appointed a civilian assembly that rubber-stamped constitutional changes allowing him to stay in office; his personal fortune expanded as he and his family took over key areas of the private economy. An increasingly pervasive corruption comparable to a gangland mob, with bribery, kickbacks, and sometimes violent enforcement, protected the power of the Somoza family at all levels. The U.S. supported the National Guard through the World War II Lend-Lease act and under the terms of the Rio Treaty, but did not publicly approve of Somoza Garcia&#x27;s extraconstitutional governance. The National Guard, which had been until then a predominately light infantry force composed largely of rifle companies equipped with World War I-vintage U.S. small arms, began to acquire surplus heavy equipment such as armoured cars, light tanks, transport vehicles and artillery.

The regime permitted nominal political dissent, and, in 1947, agreed to elections, hoping to mollify both the United States and local opponents, but quickly deposed the winning candidate in a coup d&#x27;état that brought strong disapproval from the U.S. Government. Under a new constitution, an assembly-appointed president, and a strong anti-communist stance relations improved. Nevertheless, Somoza Garcia was the true power behind the curtain and an increasing target of attempted coups and assassination; he even raised a personal bodyguard separated from the rest of the National Guard and had the constitution amended to allow him to run for yet another term in 1955. In January of that same year, Somoza Garcia, in collusion with the dictator of the Dominican Republic Rafael Trujillo, supported an unsuccessful invasion of Costa Rica from Nicaragua by exiled supporters of former President Rafael Calderón Guardia, with the Nicaraguan National guard providing air cover to the operation.

In September 1956, Somoza Garcia was fatally shot by a young dissident poet, Rigoberto López Pérez, and was succeeded in the presidency by his elder son, Luis Somoza Debayle, while his youngest son Anastasio Somoza Debayle, a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point became the Chief Director of the National Guard. Brutal repression of the internal political opposition followed suit. In 1957, the National Guard was involved in the only external military action of its existence, a brief border skirmish with Honduras. In 1961, the National Guard cooperated with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency in the preparation for the abortive Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba, permitting its bases to be used for training and staging areas. From May 1965 to September 1966, one infantry company of the National Guard participated in a peacekeeping operation in the Dominican Republic alongside U.S., Brazilian, Paraguayan, Honduran and Costa Rican troops as part of the Interamerican Pacification Force (FIP), deployed under the aegis of the Organization of American States (OAS). The guard&#x27;s domestic power, however, gradually broadened to embrace not only its original internal security and police functions but also control over customs, telecommunications, port facilities, radio broadcasting, the merchant marine, and civil aviation.

Even as trusted friends of the family succeeded Luis in the presidency, his brother remained firmly in control of the National Guard. Eventually, in 1967, Anastasio himself was elected president; Luis soon died of a heart attack, leaving Anastasio in sole control. Without his brother&#x27;s technocratic influence, Anastasio&#x27;s corrupt ways were unrestrained. The 1972 Nicaragua earthquake, which severely damaged the capital of Managua, brought further evidence of corruption, as members of the National Guard openly looted damaged businesses and misappropriated international aid, and Somoza Debayle&#x27;s personal wealth soared during the reconstruction period. In 1974, the growing Sandinista movement FSLN (named after the assassinated Sandino) succeeded in forcing the government to accept an amnesty, after which Somoza Debayle declared a state of siege and the National Guard launched a violent and repressive reaction in the period 1975–76. Though the FSLN was weakened, so was the regime.

==Collapse==
Direct U.S. military aid ended in November 1978 although the U.S. still attempted to pursue a policy of &quot;Somocismo sin Somoza,&quot; effectively allowing the power structure of the National Guard to prevent a Sandinista victory while removing the increasingly unpopular Somoza from power. The Carter Administration even sent Somoza a congratulatory note from Carter after his disputed victory in the 1978 elections.

After the assassination of opposition leader among the business elites Pedro Chamorro in January 1978, the Nicaraguan public reacted with a series of nationwide strikes and increasing political unrest against the regime. The National Guard was re-organized and expanded, growing to a force of more than 10,000 officers and enlisted men, with localized security companies dispersed throughout the country and modern specialized units such as mechanized and engineer battalions, a Presidential Guard, and a reinforced tactical battalion. The strengthened National Guard continued to tighten its grip but opposition only grew broader and fiercer. A humiliating hostage crisis ensued on 22 August 1978 when 25 Sandinista rebels disguised as National Guard soldiers led by &quot;Comandante Cero&quot; (Commander Zero), future Contra leader Edén Pastora, occupied the National Assembly Palace in Managua, took 2,000 hostages, and escaped to Panama with 50 released political prisoners. The seizure of the National Palace was the second major action launched by the Sandinistas.

By March 1979, the Somoza regime faced an open civil war as well as being cut off from all aid by the United States, including blocking of an emergency shipment of weapons and ammunition coming from Israel. With ammunition, spare parts, fuel, and medical supplies running dangerously low, the increasingly hard-pressed National Guard could no longer sustain a prolonged fight against the rebels. Already plagued by shaky morale, and weakened by casualties and desertions after seven weeks of battle, GN units were gradually forced to fall back to Managua.

At this point, on 17 July 1979 Somoza Debayle resigned from office and fled the country by plane to Miami, Florida, followed by almost all of the senior military officers of the National Guard&#x27;s General Staff. Somoza&#x27;s successor as head of state, interim President Francisco Urcuyo Maliaños opened negotiations for a cease-fire but at the same time tried to strengthen his political position by filling with younger colonels and lieutenant-colonels the depleted National Guard&#x27;s General Staff, now headed by the new Chief Director Lt. Col. (later General) Federico Mejía González. The 12,000 Guardsmen still under his command, now besieged in the government quarter of Tiscapa hill at Managua and Managua International Airport, and at the remaining holdouts throughout the country were exhorted to continue the fight.
After negotiations with the Sandinistas broke down due to his refusal to resign on 18 July, President Urcuyo fled to Guatemala, leaving in charge GN Chief Director General Mejía who tried unsuccessfully to pursue conversations for the cease-fire. Faced with the rejection by the Sandinistas of his list of demands – which included retention of all property belonging to individual officers – in exchange for a surrender, on the dawn of 19 July 1979, General Mejía and most of the high-ranking officers of the General Staff left Nicaragua by plane, leaving their men leaderless.

Early in the morning of that same day as 5,000 Sandinista guerrillas and 10,000 assorted &quot;people&#x27;s militia&quot; took control of Managua&#x27;s city center and called for a cease-fire. The last senior commander of the National Guard, Lt. Col. Fulgencio Largaespada Baez finally bowed to the inevitable and ordered his demoralised and exhausted soldiers to lay down their arms. Upon the conclusion of the civil war, 7,500 Guardsmen were taken prisoner – with many former Guards suspected of violating human rights being held in detention by the Sandinistas – while another 4,500 officers and enlisted men fled to neighboring Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica, and Guatemala to form the nucleus of an armed opposition force to the new Nicaraguan government, which would later become known as the Contras.

The Sandinista junta replaced the disbanded Guardia Nacional with two new forces, the &quot;Ejército Popular Sandinista&quot; (EPS, Sandinista Popular Army) and the &quot;Policía Sandinista&quot; (Sandinista Police). Eventually, alumni of the National Guard would be reconstituted, with the support of the CIA and Honduras, as the Contra rebels.

Following the collapse of the National Guard, many members relocated to Guatemala and went on to form the Fifteenth of September Legion, which was committed to overthrowing the Sandinista rule.

==Appearance and insignia==
===Uniforms===
Standard uniform for all ranks since the late 1920s was the U.S. Army&#x27;s tropical &#x27;Chino&#x27; khaki cotton shirt and pants, worn with the US M1912 Campaign Hat (a.k.a. &#x27;Montana Peak Hat&#x27;) in Olive Drab felt with the triangular Nicaraguan national cap badge. Military Academy cadets were issued a special version of the &#x27;Chino&#x27; uniform, with the shirt modified by the addition of black shoulder straps and breast pockets&#x27; flaps dyed black. Officers and sometimes NCOs wore in the field breeches and riding boots or the US M1931 cavalry laced boots whereas the other ranks&#x27; had their trousers trucked into US-type canvas (or leather) gaiters and ankle boots. The latter consisted of brown leather Field Shoes M-1918 (Pershing boot) and Type II/III Service Shoes, later replaced by the M-1943 Combat Service Boots and the M-1948 Russet Leather Lace-Up Boots. A four-pocket, open-collar beltless tunic modelled after the US M1926 pattern was adopted by Guardia officers and worn with a khaki shirt and tie, replaced by a white shirt and black tie on formal occasions; in active and formal service, a brown leather Sam Browne belt (US Officer&#x27;s belt, M1921) was frequently worn with the tunic. A tropical white linen dress uniform very similar to the US Navy&#x27;s Service Dress White or &quot;chokers&quot;, was adopted by the Guardia and naval service officers and Military Academy cadets. Comprising a high-collar tunic, slacks and white shoes plus a matching peaked cap, the tunic was worn with removable exaggerated twisted cord epaulettes and a red silk sash tied around the waist on formal occasions whilst enlisted ranks wore exaggerated black buff chevrons instead. Starting in the mid-1930s, Guardia officers began being issued with the M1937 or M1942 American peaked caps, in either light tropical khaki and Olive Drab wool cloth, which slowly began to replace the campaign hat in service dress. The khaki US M1934 sidecap (a.k.a. &#x27;garrison cap&#x27;) was also supplied to GN personnel during the 1930-1940s.

Guardia uniforms underwent some changes in the 1950s and 1960s, with officers adopting the US M1942 light khaki service dress, comprising tunic, slacks and a matching peaked cap with brown-japanned chinstrap and peak, or black dress cap with gold chinstrap, black peak with gold leaf embroidery for field and general ranks (the GN Chief Director had additional French-style embroidery on the cap band), and silver triangular national cap badge. For formal occasions, senior officers adopted a black ceremonial version of their M1942 service dress with gold embroidered insignia whilst the other ranks&#x27; retained the old khaki &#x27;Chino&#x27; uniform as barrack dress or for walking-out, usually worn with the khaki sidecap. The &#x27;Sam Browne&#x27; belt was discontinued, and brown (black for the other GN branches) leather shoes replaced the earlier breeches and riding boots.

Nicaraguan Air Force (FAGN) officers received a royal blue US Air Force-style M1947 service dress, worn with a light blue shirt and royal blue tie on formal occasions; a short-sleeved shirt and matching royal blue sidecap (a.k.a. &#x27;flight cap&#x27;) was worn by officers and other ranks in active service. The Nicaraguan Navy retained both the white dress and khaki uniforms, with officers&#x27; adopting a modified version of the M1942 tunic with removable shoulder boards, which was worn with a light khaki shirt and black tie on service dress.

Nicaraguan National Police (PNGN) officers&#x27; continued to wear as service dress the &#x27;Chino&#x27; khaki shirt (in long or short sleeve versions) and trousers with shoes or Olive Green (OG) fatigues with combat boots, whereas female constables were given a khaki short-sleeved blouse and assorted knee-length skirt worn with a flat-top, short snapped-brimmed khaki hat. Their male counterparts retained the &#x27;Montana Peak&#x27; Hat as standard headgear, though the latter also began to be replaced by a light khaki M1954-type Visor Cap; Police officers on traffic control duties were given a white-topped version. It never entirely superseded the earlier headgear however, for photos taken in Managua at the time of the 1972 earthquake show local policemen going on patrol still wearing the old &#x27;Montana&#x27; Hat. While on patrol duties, the M1912 black leather Sam Browne belt with pistol holster and assorted magazine pouches, handcuff pouch and M1944 baton in its respective carrier was worn.

Around the late 1960s Guardia units began to receive surplus American Olive Green tropical uniforms, the US Army OG-107 cotton sateen utilities and the M1967 Jungle Utility Uniform. Elite formations within the GN received camouflage versions of these same uniforms, first in the &quot;Duck Hunter&quot; pattern, soon followed by &quot;Tigerstripe&quot; (&quot;ERDL Thai Tadpole type&quot;) and &quot;Highland&quot; (&quot;ERDL 1948 Leaf pattern&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;Woodland pattern&quot;). National Police BECAT teams had their own distinctive &quot;Tan leaf&quot; pattern, which consisted of puzzle leaf-shapes in medium brown, light brown, and sandy-grey on a tan background.
Standard headgear for all-ranks in the Guardia was either the US Army M1943 &#x27;Walker cap&#x27; and M1951 Olive Green Field caps, the tropical OG-106 Baseball cap or the IDF &quot;Old style&quot; Olive Drab fatigue cap, partially replaced on the field by US Army Boonie hats or US Marines&#x27; utility caps in both olive green and ERDL camouflage versions. Specialized units authorized berets wore them pulled to the right, American-fashion, with the colour sequence for the ground forces as follows: Armoured Cavalry and Counter-insurgency &quot;Commandos&quot; – Black; Paratroopers – Cherry-red (Maroon); Presidential Guard – Green; GN berets were made of one-piece artificial wool attached to a black leather rim-band, with both US or Israeli patterns being worn.

Black leather combat boots were also provided by the Americans who issued both the early US Army M-1962 &#x27;McNamara&#x27; model and the M-1967 model with &#x27;ripple&#x27; pattern rubbler sole; the US Army Jungle boot of Vietnam War fame was worn by Nicaraguan soldiers and Police officers only while operating in tropical jungle or marshy ground environments.

===Helmets and body armour===

The first combat helmet provided to Guardia units was the US steel M1917 A1 &quot;Kelly&quot; helmet during World War II, replaced in 1954 by the M-1, issued with a Mitchell &#x27;Clouds&#x27; pattern camouflage cover and the Israeli-made Orlite Industries Ltd composite fibreglass OR-201 Model 76 ballistic helmet, which began to replace the earlier M-1 in 1977. Period photos however, do show GN soldiers and National Police constables within the same units wearing side-by-side both US and Israeli types, often worn plain without camo covers. Armoured crews, depending on the vehicle they manned, received either the old World War II US M1938 &#x27;Gruyére&#x27; composite fiber-and-leather crash helmet or the Vietnam-era fibreglass &#x27;bone dome&#x27; Combat Vehicle Crew (CVC) T-56-6 helmet though neither models offered any satisfactory protection against shrapnel or small arms rounds. Guardia&#x27;s military and National Police personnel were also issued with flak jackets, either the Ballistic Nylon US M-1952 and M-1952/69 &#x27;Half-collar&#x27; versions or the Israeli-produced Kevlar Rabintex Industries Ltd Type III RAV 200 Protective Vest (Hebrew: &quot;Shapats&quot;).

===Accoutrements===
Web gear was supplied by the Americans, who provided to the early Guardia infantry companies the khaki web M-1910 infantry equipment in all of its versions (M-1917/18 and later World War II/Korean War M-1945 patterns). With the full introduction of semi-automatic and automatic small-arms, however, the GN and Police adopted both the US Army M-1956 load-carrying equipment (LCE) in khaki cotton canvas and the M-1967 modernized load-carrying equipment (MLCE) in OG Nylon; some photos do show that the all-purpose lightweight individual carrying equipment (ALICE), an upgrade of the latter, was also given to some Guardia troops in 1978–79. Usually, personnel armed with M-1s, FALs and M16s tended to be issued with American web gear whereas those soldiers or policemen issued Galils or Uzi SMGs received the IDF 1950&#x27;s &quot;Old style&quot; tan-khaki cotton canvas equipment (similar in design to the British Army&#x27;s 58 pattern webbing) or the newer olive green Nylon Ephod Combat Vest instead.

===Rank insignia===

The Nicaraguan National Guard rank chart was directly inspired by the US Army, with chevrons pointed upwards for NCOs, horizontal linked brass bars for company officers and vertically placed gilded or silvered stars for field officers. The sequence, however, was slightly different, with sergeants&#x27; ranks being limited to two only; captains were identified by three bars instead of two as per in the US Armed Services, whilst majors had a five-point gilded star in lieu of a leaf. National Guard rank insignia from Subteniente to Coronel resembled a US antecedent—but that of the Confederate States Army. There were also some differences in colour and nomenclature according to the branches of service: Ground Forces&#x27; NCOs had yellow on dark-green chevrons, the Air Force personnel wore white on royal blue ground forces&#x27; rank insignia whilst the Navy&#x27;s seamen and petty officers&#x27; ranks were identical to the other branches of the Guardia, but line officers had US Navy-style rank insignia on removable navy blue shoulder boards instead.

===Branch insignia===

Skills and trades badges followed more closely the American practice. The ground forces officers&#x27; service dress tunic had the triangular national cap badge on the collar and US-style brass lapel insignia: crossed rifles – infantry; crossed cavalry sabres and tank – armour; crossed cannons – artillery; castle – engineers; crossed signal flags and torch – signals; Caduceus – medical department, whilst pilot-qualified officers of the Air Force had the winged propeller badge on the lapels.
When the Guardia was formed in the mid-1920s, its personnel wore on the left sleeve of their light khaki shirts a simple diamond-shaped blue patch with the white letters &quot;GN&quot;, later replaced by a more elaborate system of service and unit insignia. On the olive green or camouflage combat uniforms, officers&#x27; wore cloth subdued or black metal pin-on rank insignia on the right collar, branch insignia on the left, and NCOs&#x27; yellow chevrons on an olive green background. A subdued nametape was worn over the right breast pocket, the &#x27;Guardia&#x27; national title on the left, and full-colour or subdued unit patches and shoulder titles on both sleeves. Members of the 1st Armored Battalion wore at the sides of their OR-201 helmets a blue triangular-shaped decal bearing the unit&#x27;s black crest inserted on a white disc at the center. For parade in field dress branch-colour neck scarfs were worn, being light blue for infantry and EEBI &quot;Commandos&quot;, black for armour, red for artillery, yellow for engineers and signals, and apple green for the GN General Staff.

==Weapons and equipment==
Throughout its existence, the Nicaraguan National Guard received military assistance mainly from the United States, who provided since the late 1920s everything that the Guardia used, from uniforms and boots to rifles, artillery and vehicles, mostly under the US Military Assistance Program (MAP). However, starting in the early 1950s, the Somozas made consistent efforts to diversify their sources of military hardware and supplies in a hope to reduce their dependence from the Americans. The majority of its weaponry until the mid-1970s consisted of U.S.-made surplus &#x27;hand-me-downs&#x27; from both world wars, Korea and Vietnam, partially supplemented by more modern equipment either donated or sold by Israel, Spain, Argentina, Morocco, and South Africa, particularly after U.S. aid was cut in 1978. Other countries such as Italy, West Germany, Portugal, El Salvador, Paraguay, Sweden, South Korea, and the Philippines were also involved in providing some form of covert aid or acted as brokers in secret arms deals.

===Small arms===

The first standard issue weapon of the Guardia Nacional (GN) infantry companies at the mid-1920s was the Krag–Jørgensen US M1896/98 .30-40 (7.62 mm) bolt-action rifle, soon superseded by the Springfield US M1903 .30-06 (7.62×63mm). The squad weapon was the Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) M1918A2 US .30-06 (7.62×63mm) light machine gun – the GN also appears to have received the American-made version of the famed World War I British-made Lewis gun .303 (7.7mm), the Savage Model 1917 LMG chambered for the US .30-06 (7.62×63mm) cartridge –, with the company weapons being the Colt-Browning M1895 &quot;potato digger&quot; .30-06 medium machine gun and the US M1917A1 .30-06 Browning water-cooled medium machine gun. Officers and NCOs received the Thompson M1928A1 US .45 caliber (11.4mm) submachine gun, as well as the Colt M1911A1 .45 caliber (11.4mm) semi-automatic pistol as personal sidearm. A small number of ZB vz. 30 light machine guns were acquired from Czechoslovakia in 1937 for evaluation, but they were never adopted as standard weapons by the GN.

In the 1940s–1950s, the GN received surplus American infantry weapons of World War II/Korean War-vintage – M1/M2 US .30 carbines (7.62×33mm) and M1 Garand US .30-06 (7.62×63mm) semi-automatic rifles replaced the earlier bolt-action Springfields, with Thompson M1A1 and M3 &quot;Grease Gun&quot; submachine gun models in US .45 caliber (11.4mm) replacing the older Thompson M1928A1 model. Although the popular Colt pistol was retained, Colt Cobra .38 Special snub-nose revolvers, Smith &amp; Wesson Model 10 revolvers and Smith &amp; Wesson Model 15 revolvers in .38 Special were also adopted. Medium and heavy machine guns, in the form of the M1919A4 US .30-06 Browning (7.62×63mm) – or its M1919A6 light machine gun version – and the larger M2HB .50 Browning (12.7×99mm) were added to the Guardia&#x27;s arsenal, replacing the ageing M1895 and M1917A1 water-cooled medium machine guns.

Assault rifles began to be adopted towards the end of the 1960s, though they never displaced entirely the earlier weaponry, such as the Garand rifle which remained the weapon of choice for soldiers serving in the Guardia&#x27;s infamous firing squads and the security companies, who employed it to disperse demonstrations. Nevertheless, by 1978–79 most GN infantry formations had either the Belgian FN FAL (or its Israeli version, the lightened ROMAT) 7.62×51mm NATO or US M16A1 5.56×45mm assault rifles, with elite units receiving the Israeli-made IMI Galil SAR and ARM variants in both 5.56×45mm and 7.62×51mm which was adopted in the mid-1970s. At squad level, the Belgium-made FN MAG 58 and US M60 light machine guns both in 7.62×51mm NATO, replaced the obsolete BAR and Savage models, though the heavier Brownings were retained as platoon and company machine guns. The Israeli Uzi 9mm submachine gun was also given to armoured crews, Police BECAT teams and EEBI &quot;Commando&quot; troops, who were also issued the US Remington Model 700 Sniper rifle 7.62×51mm, and the Ithaca Model 37 12-gauge and Remington Model 870 12-gauge pump-action shotguns.

Hand grenades were supplied by the Americans, who provided M59 &quot;Baseball&quot; hand grenades, Mark 2 &quot;Pineapple&quot; Fragmentation Hand/Rifle Grenades, M61 Fragmentation Hand Grenades, M67 grenades, M26A1 Fragmentation Hand Grenades, M34 White Phosphorus Smoke Grenades and M18 Smoke Hand Grenades; M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mines were also employed. The Nicaraguan infantryman was also provided with two types of portable rocket weapons, the shoulder-fired US M79 &quot;Blooper&quot; 40mm single-shot grenade launcher and the expendable anti-tank, one-shot US M72 LAW 66 mm.

===Mortars and artillery===

Guardia infantry and artillery formations were equipped with a variety of crew-served weapons. Light mortars ranged from the M2 60 mm and M1 81 mm models of World War II-vintage, to the more recent M29 81 mm; some selected elite troops received the Israeli-designed Soltam M-65 120 mm heavy mortar. They were also issued US M18 57 mm, M20 75 mm, M67 90 mm and M40A1 106 mm recoilless rifles. The field artillery battery was provided with six to nine World War II-vintage M3 37 mm towed anti-tank guns, four US M101A1 105 mm towed Howitzers and an unspecified number of EDESA Yarará 70 mm 42-tube multiple rocket launchers of Argentinian origin mounted on Chevrolet C-10 Cheyenne 4×4 light pickups whereas the Anti-Aircraft battery operated US Maxson M45 Quadmount turrets on towed wheeled trailers and Israeli-supplied Hispano-Suiza HS.404 20 mm autocannons mounted on the TCM-20 turret configuration. Usually installed on the back of cross-country vehicles, such weapon systems proved useful in the direct fire supporting role, particularly against fortified positions and to root out snipers from urban buildings. The AA battery originally fielded six to eight M1 Bofors 40 mm Anti-Aircraft guns, but these were re-fitted in 1979 to a civilian cargo vessel commandeered from the Memnic Line Company, in order to provide direct fire support off the Pacific coast to Guardia infantry units fighting in the Southern Front.
It is also rumored that the anti-aircraft battery received from Israel in 1977–78 an unspecified number of surplus US-made General Dynamics FIM-43 Redeye man-portable surface-to-air missiles (SAM).

===Combat and transport vehicles===

The Guardia also fielded a small armoured corps, organized since 1978 into a single mechanized company while platoon-sized units where attached to General Somoza Combat Battalion, the Presidential Guard, the engineer battalion, and the EEBI Infantry School. The inventory consisted mostly of World War II-vintage American vehicles acquired in the 1950s – ten ex-Philippine Army M4A3 E8 (76) and M4A3E8 (105) Sherman tanks, three to four M3A1 Stuart light tanks, and eighteen T17E1 M6 Staghound armoured cars of Israeli origin (some had their turrets removed and replaced by a 30. or 50. cal Browning HMG mount instead). In addition, two obsolete L3/33 tankettes acquired from Italy in the mid-1930s were reportedly held in reserve, but only one (nicknamed &quot;La Mascota&quot; by the Nicaraguans) was still kept in running conditions by 1979.

Apart from a mere ten M2 half-track cars, the Guardia suffered from a chronic shortage of light armored personnel carriers (APCs) for its infantry units, forcing them to rely on their extensive fleet of soft-skinned transport and liaison vehicles. These ranged from World War II-vintage Willys MB ¼-ton 4×4 jeeps and Dodge WC51 ¾-ton 4×4 utility trucks to more modern Willys M38A1 MD ¼-ton 4×4 jeeps and Willys CJ-5 4×4 jeeps, Spanish VIASA-Ebro trucks MB-CJ6b jeeps (Spanish-produced version of the Willys CJ-3B jeep), Santana Series III (Spanish-produced variant of the Land Rover Series III model) and Toyota Land Cruiser (J40) light pickups, VIASA-Ebro trucks &quot;Campeador&quot; one-ton pickups (Spanish-produced variant of the Jeepster Commando), M151A1 ¼-ton 4×4 utility trucks (nicknamed &quot;Pumas&quot; by the Nicaraguans), Dodge M37B ¾-ton 4×4 1953 utility trucks (nicknamed &quot;Chatas&quot; by the Nicaraguans; in 1978, one M37B was converted by the GN engineers into an armored car prototype dubbed &quot;La Trigra&quot;, but the whole project was discontinued due to the lack of funds), and Israeli AIL M325 Command Cars (&quot;Nun-Nun&quot;) and Mercedes-Benz Unimog 404 light trucks. Heavy transport vehicles were also employed, ranging from older World War II GMC CCKW 2½-ton 6×6 and Chevrolet G506 1½-ton 4×4 trucks to newer US Dodge W500/W600 Power Wagon 4×4 medium-duty trucks, US M35A2 2½-ton 6×6 cargo trucks and US M39 5-ton 6x6 cargo trucks, and Spanish Pegaso 3046 4×4 and 3050 6×6 heavy-duty trucks, which the GN received in both civilian and military versions.

Besides being used as troop carriers these vehicles also doubled as &#x27;gun trucks&#x27; or &#x27;technicals&#x27;, being fitted with heavy machine-guns, recoilless rifles and AA autocannons. Moreover, their lack of protection rendered them highly vulnerable to improvised explosive devices (IEDs) or small-arms fire, and many were lost together with their crews in 1979 due to intense street fighting and ambushes in rural areas.
Commandeered tracked Caterpillar or wheeled civilian Bulldozers of American and Spanish origin were also employed by the Guardia during the battles for Masaya and Managua to clear paths on rebel-held urban neighbourhoods by demolishing buildings turned into bunkers by the guerrillas.

==Order of battle as by 1978–79==

===Ground Forces===

In January 1978 National Guard overall strength peaked at about 25,000 officers and enlisted men under the direct personal command of their Chief Director and President of Nicaragua Major general Anastasio Somoza Debayle (a.k.a. &#x27;Tachito&#x27;). Often described as something closer to a corps of feudal retainers (or an occupation force) than to a modern national army, the GN was primarily organized for internal security and Counter-insurgency (COIN) operations rather than national defense, with most infantry units being assigned static garrison duties, and consequently its conventional military value was very low. Out of this total some 10,000–12,500 served in the ground forces proper (including women in the military and PNGN), but only about 7,500 were combat troops, organized into one Presidential Guard battalion, one armoured battalion, one mechanized infantry battalion, one mechanized company, one engineer battalion, one Military Police battalion, one field artillery battery and one anti-aircraft battery, plus sixteen security companies. All the aforementioned units were deployed in traditional Spanish colonial fashion in fortress-like &quot;cuarteles&quot; (Quarters; barracks-cum-garrisons) in the main cities, including the national capital of Managua. The Headquarters of the GN&#x27;s General Staff was placed at the heart of the government quarter of Tiscapa Hill near downtown Managua, allocated in an underground bunker-style complex built after the 1972 Nicaragua earthquake; the quarter&#x27;s adjacent facilities also housed the main offices&#x27; of the Guardia&#x27;s own administration, signals, engineering, medical, logistics and military justice support services, and the main military schools.

Managua was also home to most of the GN&#x27;s main tactical units such as the &quot;Batallón de Guardia Presidencial&quot; (BGP, Presidential Guard Battalion), the &quot;Patrulla Presidencial&quot; (PP, Presidential VIP protection unit), the &quot;Primero Batallón Blindado&quot; (PBB, 1st Armoured Battalion), the &quot;Batallón de Combate General Somoza&quot; (BCGS, General Somoza Combat Battalion), the &quot;Batallón de Ingeniería&quot; (Engineer Battalion), the &quot;Batallón de Policía Militar&quot; (BPM, Military Police Battalion), and the Field Artillery Batteries. All of them formed part of the Managua garrison.
The &quot;Compañías de Seguridad de la Guardia Nacional&quot; (CSGN, NG Security Companies for short) were dispersed throughout the country&#x27;s 16 departments (Spanish: &quot;Departamentos&quot;), being allocated one per each in the provincial capitals of Boaco (Boaco), Jinotepe (Carazo), Chinandega (Chinandega), Juigalpa (Chontales), Estelí (Estelí), Granada (Granada), Jinotega (Jinotega), León (León), Madriz (Somoto), Masaya (Masaya), Matagalpa (Matagalpa), Ocotal (Nueva Segovia), Rivas (Rivas), San Carlos (Río San Juan) and Bluefields (Zelaya).

===Air Forces===

The &quot;Fuerza Aérea de La Guardia Nacional&quot; (FAGN, Air Force of the Nicaraguan National Guard) in 1978 comprised some 1,500 officers and enlisted men, including pilots and ground personnel, under the command of Colonel Donaldo Humberto Frixote, an experienced pilot and staunch Somoza loyalist. FAGN main air elements at the time consisted of four squadrons – one attack, one helio, one transport and one advanced training – provided with a mixed inventory of aircraft of various types, mostly of U.S., Israeli, British, Canadian and Spanish origin, the majority being propeller-driven. All FAGN aircraft and personnel were concentrated at the military airbase adjacent to the then Mercedes International Airport at Managua, which also housed the Air Force HQ and the Aviation School.

*The &quot;Escuadrón de Combate&quot; (combat squadron), operated on air assault and counter-insurgency missions ten Cessna 337A Super Skymaster &quot;Push and Pull&quot; light aircraft converted for the ground attack and close air support roles, either seven or eleven North American T-28A/D Trojan dual-seat trainers converted for the ground attack role, seven Lockheed T-33A dual-seat jet trainers converted to the fighter-bomber role, two Douglas A-20G Havoc night fighters and seven Douglas A-26B/C Invader reconnaissance/light bombers.
*The &quot;Escuadrón de Ala Rotatoria&quot; (helicopter squadron) aligned for aerial reconnaissance, search-and-rescue (SAR), transport and assault duties eleven Sikorsky S-58T (CH-34A) Choctaw helicopters converted for the gunship role (nicknamed &quot;Skyraiders&quot; by the Nicaraguans), twelve Hughes OH-6A/H-369HS Defender light observation helicopters, four Hiller 12B Raven light utility helicopters, three Hughes 269 A/B (TH-55A) Osage light utility helicopters, two Bell UH-1H Iroquois utility transports, an unspecified number of Sikorsky H-19 Chickasaw utility helicopters and one Bell 47H light utility helicopter.
*The &quot;Escuadrón de Transporte&quot; (transport squadron) operated thirteen Douglas C-47 Skytrain transports, eight Cessna 180 Skywagon light utility aircraft, seven Cessna 185 (U-17B) Skywagon light utility aircraft, seven Beech 18 (C-45) Expeditor trainer &amp; utility aircraft, six De Havilland Canada DHC-3 (U-1A) Otter STOL utility transports, five CASA C-212 Aviocar medium transports, two IAI Arava 201 STOL utility transports, two Piper PA-23-250 Aztec twin-engined light piston utility transports, eight Piper PA-34-200 Seneca twin-engined light utility transports, one Hawker Siddeley HS-125-600B mid-size business jet, one Rockwell Aero Commander 680FL Grand utility transport and an unspecified number of Cessna 421 Golden Eagle light transports.
*The advanced training squadron of the Aviation School operated twenty-nine North American AT-6 Texan dual-seat trainers, ten Piper PA-18 Super Cub light utility aircraft, seven Cessna 172 J/K Skyhawk utility aircraft and six Fairchild PT-19A trainers.

===Naval forces===
The &quot;Marina de Guerra de la Guardia Nacional&quot; (MG-GN, Nicaraguan National Guard Navy) in 1978 stood at about 1,000 sailors and ratings who manned a surface flotilla of some eight to ten Israeli Dabur-1 class patrol boats, one GC2 patrol boat, one GC6 patrol boat, and one Swiftships 85 ft-type patrol boat. The MG-GN flotilla was divided into a Pacific coast patrol squadron, the &quot;Guardia Marina del Pacífico&quot;, and an Atlantic coast patrol squadron, the &quot;Guardia Marina del Atlântico&quot;. Main naval bases were situated at the coastal towns of Corinto (Chinandega) on the Pacific coast and Puerto Cabezas (Zelaya) on the Caribbean coast, with secondary naval stations set up at San Juan del Sur (Rivas) and El Bluff near Bluefields (Zelaya).

===National Police branch===

Created in 1970 out of the law-enforcement branch of the Guardia, the &quot;Policia Nacional – Guardia Nacional&quot; (PNGN, National Police of the National Guard) was a municipal constabulary numbering some 9,000–10,000 male and female uniformed constables, although other sources estimate that their actual number was no fewer than 3,000–8,000. Most of its lightly armed personnel were concentrated in the main cities (Managua, Leon, Matagalpa, and Masaya) on police duties, or assigned to the &quot;Brigadas Especiales contra Actos de Terrorismo&quot; (BECAT, Special Counter-insurgency Brigades). This was an urban rapid-reaction, anti-terrorist unit closely modelled on SWAT, whose members received special camouflage uniforms and Israeli helmets and flak vests, being armed with Uzi SMGs, M-16s, pump-action shotguns and sniper rifles. Easily recognizable by their Willys CJ-5 4×4 jeeps equipped with vehicular beacons, sirens and wire cutters installed on the front bumper, and painted in blue-and-white National Police markings, BECAT teams were frequently employed in raids at Nicaraguan urban slums in search for hidden guerrillas, and quickly earned an unenviable reputation for brutality.

===Special Forces===

By July 1979, the GN also fielded some 2,000–2,500 elite counter-insurgency EEBI troops, comprising Commandos (a.k.a. the &quot;Boinas Negras&quot; or &quot;Black Berets&quot;, first formed in 1968), Paratroopers (a.k.a. the &quot;Gansos Salvajes&quot; or &quot;Wild Geese&quot;, formed in 1978–79) and infantry trainees led by Major (later, Colonel) Anastasio Somoza Portocarrero, in armed jeeps and gun-trucks plus two small artillery and armoured car platoons.

==Training institutions==
It is estimated that 4,252 Nicaraguan servicemen had been trained by the United States between 1970 and 1976 at the Inter-American Military Academy (a.k.a. &quot;School of the Americas&quot;) at Fort Gulick in the Panama Canal Zone, in the Psychological and Special Warfare Academy at Fort Bragg, and at the Inter-American Defense College in Washington D.C.

===Military Academy – AMN===
Created on 9 November 1939, the &quot;Academia Militar de Nicaragua&quot; (AMN, Nicaraguan Military Academy) was the noncommissioned officers&#x27; and Officer Candidate School and Staff College of the Guardia Nacional. Modelled after the West Point Academy, the AMN was initially staffed by a cadre of US Army instructors headed by Brigadier-General Charles L. Mullins (1939–1942), himself a West Point graduate. He was succeeded as Director of the AMN by other three US Army senior officers, Brigadier-General Fred T. Cruse (1942–1943), Brigadier-General LeRoy Bartlett jr. (1943–1946) and Brigadier-General John F. Greco (1947) until GN Infantry Colonel Anastasio Somoza Debayle was appointed its first Nicaraguan-born Superintendent in 1948.

===Infantry Basic Training School – EEBI===

The &quot;Escuela de Entrenamiento Basico de Infanteria&quot; (EEBI, Infantry Basic Training School) was founded in 1976–77 by then Capitan Anastasio Somoza Portocarrero upon his return from the United States after attending both the U.S. Army Infantry School at Fort Benning and the U.S. Army school for psychological and special warfare at Fort Bragg. Initially attached for administrative purposes to the 3rd company of the General Somoza Combat Battalion and headquartered at Tiscapa Hill just outside Managua, the EEBI was an indigenous Special Forces training center modelled after Fort Bragg, and was tasked of training the Guardia&#x27;s own elite anti-guerrilla Commandos, the &quot;Black Berets&quot; and its first parachute unit, the &quot;Wild Geese&quot;. Inspired on the U.S. Special Forces (USSF), Chilean Army Commandos&#x27; and Brazilian Army Paratroopers&#x27; training programs, the School&#x27;s own special curriculum placed emphasis on counter-insurgency. Advanced courses ranged from basic light infantry skills, jungle combat and survival to sniper, light and heavy weapons (mortars and artillery), demolitions, &#x27;Commando&#x27; operations and intelligence, reconnaissance (Ranger), communications, medical, airborne and even light armor tactics. Ex-USSF and exiled South Vietnamese LLDB instructors conducted most of the training, though the School&#x27;s teaching staff is said to have included anti-Castro Cuban exiles (former members of the Brigade 2506, which had participated in the ill-fated Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961), Guatemalans, Salvadorans and Chileans, as well as Israeli and German mercenaries.

===Signals School===
The &quot;Escuela de Transmissiones&quot; (Signals School) was established on 15 January 1933.

===Nicaraguan Air Force Academy – EMA===
A &quot;Escuela del Aire&quot; (Air School) was first formed in 1932 to train Nicaraguan pilots for the recently created National Guard Air Wing, though it was only in August 1940 that was formally established at Managua airfield as the &quot;Escuela Militar de Aviación&quot; (EMA, Military Aviation School).

===National Guard Police Academy – ENP===
The &quot;Escuela Nacional de Policia&quot; (ENP, National Police School) was the Police Academy of the National Guard.

===Lake Managua Weapons Range===
The &quot;Polígono de Tiro&quot; (Weapons Range) was located close to Lake Managua, being used for artillery and air superiority training of GN ground units and Air Force pilots.

==In popular culture==
The Nicaraguan National Guard was featured in three major film productions, all set during the 1979 Nicaraguan Revolution, the first being the 1980 German film &quot;The Uprising&quot; shot on location at Nicaragua. This was followed in 1983 by the Hollywood films &quot;Last Plane Out&quot; and &quot;Under Fire&quot;; the latter was actually shot at Mexico with Mexican Army soldiers portraying both Guardia&#x27; troops and FSLN guerrillas.

<doc id="931064" wikidata="Q586031" url="?curid=931064" title="YORP effect">
<text>The Yarkovsky–O&#x27;Keefe–Radzievskii–Paddack effect, or YORP effect for short, changes the rotation state of a small astronomical body – that is, the body&#x27;s spin rate and the obliquity of its pole(s) – due to the scattering of solar radiation off its surface and the emission of its own thermal radiation.

The YORP effect is typically considered for asteroids with their heliocentric orbit in the Solar System. The effect is responsible for the creation of binary and tumbling asteroids as well as for changing an asteroid&#x27;s pole towards 0°, 90°, or 180° relative to the ecliptic plane and so modifying its heliocentric radial drift rate due to the Yarkovsky effect.

== Term ==
The term was coined by David P. Rubincam in 2000 to honor four important contributors to the concepts behind the so-named YORP effect. In the 19th century, Ivan Yarkovsky realized that the thermal radiation escaping from a body warmed by the Sun carries off momentum as well as heat. Translated into modern physics, each emitted photon possesses a momentum &quot;p&quot; = &quot;E/c&quot; where &quot;E&quot; is its energy and &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light. Vladimir Radzievskii applied the idea to rotation based on changes in albedo and Stephen Paddack realized that shape was a much more effective means of altering a body&#x27;s spin rate. Stephen Paddack and John O&#x27;Keefe suggested that the YORP effect leads to rotational bursting and by repeatedly undergoing this process, small asymmetric bodies are eventually reduced to dust.

== Physical mechanism ==
In principle, electromagnetic radiation interacts with the surface of an asteroid in three significant ways: radiation from the Sun is (1) absorbed and (2) diffusively reflected by the surface of the body and the body&#x27;s internal energy is (3) emitted as thermal radiation. Since photons possess momentum, each of these interactions leads to changes in the angular momentum of the body relative to its center of mass. If considered for only a short period of time, these changes are very small, but over longer periods of time, these changes may integrate to significant changes in the angular momentum of the body. For bodies in a heliocentric orbit, the relevant long period of time is the orbital period (i.e. year), since most asteroids have rotation periods (i.e. days) shorter than their orbital periods. Thus, for most asteroids, the YORP effect is the secular change in the rotation state of the asteroid after averaging the solar radiation torques over first the rotational period and then the orbital period.

== Observations ==
In 2007 there was direct observational confirmation of the YORP effect on the small asteroids 54509 YORP (then designated ) and 1862 Apollo. The spin rate of 54509 YORP will double in just 600,000 years, and the YORP effect can also alter the axial tilt and precession rate, so that the entire suite of YORP phenomena can send asteroids into interesting resonant spin states, and helps explain the existence of binary asteroids.

Observations show that asteroids larger than 125 km in diameter have rotation rates that follow a Maxwellian frequency distribution, while smaller asteroids (in the 50 to 125 km size range) show a small excess of fast rotators. The smallest asteroids (size less than 50 km) show a clear excess of very fast and slow rotators, and this becomes even more pronounced as smaller-sized populations are measured. These results suggest that one or more size-dependent mechanisms are depopulating the centre of the spin rate distribution in favour of the extremes. The YORP effect is a prime candidate. It is not capable of significantly modifying the spin rates of large asteroids by itself, so a different explanation must be sought for objects such as 253 Mathilde.

In late 2013 asteroid P/2013 R3 was observed breaking apart, likely because of a high rotation speed from the YORP effect.

== Examples ==
Assume a rotating spherical asteroid has two wedge-shaped fins attached to its equator, irradiated by parallel rays of sunlight. The reaction force from photons departing from any given surface element of the spherical core will be normal to the surface, such that no torque is produced (the force vectors all pass through the centre of mass).

Thermally-emitted photons from the sides of the wedges, however, can produce a torque, as the normal vectors do not pass through the centre of mass. Both fins present the same cross section to the incoming light (they have the same height and width), and so absorb and reflect the same amount of energy each and produce an equal force. Due to the fin surfaces being oblique, however, the normal forces from the reradiated photons do not cancel out. In the diagram, fin A&#x27;s outgoing radiation produces an equatorial force parallel to the incoming light and no vertical force, but fin B&#x27;s force has a smaller equatorial component and a vertical component. The unbalanced forces on the two fins lead to torque and the object spins. The torque from the outgoing light does not average out, even over a full rotation, so the spin accelerates over time.

An object with some &quot;windmill&quot; asymmetry can therefore be subjected to minuscule torque forces that will tend to spin it up or down as well as make its axis of rotation precess. The YORP effect is zero for a rotating ellipsoid &quot;if&quot; there are no irregularities in surface temperature or albedo.

In the long term, the object&#x27;s changing obliquity and rotation rate may wander randomly, chaotically or regularly, depending on several factors. For example, assuming the Sun remains on its equator, asteroid 951 Gaspra, with a radius of 6 km and a semi-major axis of 2.21 AU, would in 240 Ma (240 million years) go from a rotation period of 12 h to 6 h and vice versa. If 243 Ida were given the same radius and orbit values as Gaspra, it would spin up or down twice as fast, while a body with Phobos&#x27; shape would take several billion years to change its spin by the same amount.

Size as well as shape affects the amount of the effect. Smaller objects will spin up or down much more quickly. If Gaspra were smaller by a factor of 10 (to a radius of 500 m), its spin will halve or double in just a few million years. Similarly, the YORP effect intensifies for objects closer to the Sun. At 1 AU, Gaspra would double/halve its spin rate in a mere 100,000 years. After one million years, its period may shrink to ~2 h, at which point it could start to break apart. According to a 2019 model, the YORP effect is likely to cause &quot;widespread fragmentation of asteroids&quot; as the Sun expands into a luminous red giant, and may explain the dust disks and apparent infalling matter observed at many white dwarfs.

This is one mechanism through which binary asteroids may form, and it may be more common than collisions and planetary near-encounter tidal disruption as the primary means of binary formation.

Asteroid was later named 54509 YORP to honor its part in the confirmation of this phenomenon.

It was also released as a four-CD audiobook, narrated by actor Dennis Boutsikaris, by Random House Audio Publishing Group in October 2006. The book was adapted into the film &quot;Christmas with the Kranks&quot; (2004), directed by Joe Roth and written by Chris Columbus.

==Plot== 
The story focuses on how Luther and Nora Krank try to avoid the frenzy traditionally experienced during the Christmas holiday. On the Sunday after Thanksgiving, the two take their daughter Blair to the airport, where she departs for a year-long Peace Corps assignment in Peru. Seeing all of the busy traveling at the airport, Luther starts to develop an increasingly personal antipathy for normal Christmas traditions, especially knowing that Blair will not be with them for Christmas this year. To make matters worse, Luther is told by Nora to stop by a packed grocery store on a very rainy day, causing him to get soaked, only to realize when getting back in the car that he forgot the white chocolate on the shopping list, forcing Nora to go inside and get it herself.

Nora bemoans the fact that the upcoming Christmas will be the first time they have been separated as a family, prompting her husband to calculate how much they spent celebrating the holidays the previous year. When he realizes they have little to show for the $6,100 they invested in decorations, gifts, and entertaining, he decides to skip all the hubbub at home and surprise Nora by booking a 10-day Caribbean cruise aboard the &quot;Island Princess&quot;. Nora at first is skeptical but accepts the idea on one condition – that they still donate $600 to the church and Children&#x27;s Hospital. At first Luther refuses, but when Nora refuses to consider the cruise otherwise, he agrees, and they begin to plan the trip.

It doesn&#x27;t take long for Nora to adjust to the idea of no Christmas shopping or Christmas tree, and not hosting their annual Christmas Eve party. To the couple&#x27;s amazement, their neighbors on Hemlock Street strongly object to their decision to boycott the holiday, because the Kranks&#x27; decision not to decorate their home will jeopardize the block&#x27;s chances at winning the coveted prize for best decorated block in the neighborhood. Vic Frohmeyer, the unelected &quot;top man&quot; of the neighborhood, leads the townspeople in taunting Luther and Nora about Christmas celebrations by extending a perimeter of people around their lawn, asking a group of Christmas carolers to sing carols on the Kranks&#x27; lawn, calling repeatedly to demand that they decorate their house for Christmas, and picketing with signs, &quot;et cetera&quot;.

The charities also are upset with the couple: the local Boy Scout troop is dismayed when the Kranks refuse to support them by purchasing a tree, the police are angered when they decline to buy a calendar, the firemen are shocked to learn the Kranks will not be buying a fruitcake this year, and the stationer is upset when he loses their annual order of engraved greeting cards. A newspaper even gets in the act by asking Luther&#x27;s #1 rival, Walt Scheel, to film the Kranks&#x27; house for the story. Luther and Nora find themselves the objects of derision and anxiously await their departure on Christmas Day.

Without warning, Blair calls from Miami on Christmas Eve to announce she&#x27;s en route home with her new Peruvian fiancé to surprise her parents. She&#x27;s anxious to introduce Enrique to her family&#x27;s Christmas traditions, and when she asks if they&#x27;re having their usual party that night, a panicking Nora says, &quot;Yes&quot;, much to Luther&#x27;s dismay.

Comic chaos ensues as the couple finds themselves trying to decorate the house and coordinate a party with mere hours to spare before their daughter and future son-in-law arrive. Because the Boy Scouts have sold out of Christmas trees, Luther arranges to borrow the tree of a neighbor who is leaving for the holidays. He and Vic Frohmeyer&#x27;s son Spike try to transport it across the street, but other neighbors notice and mistakenly think Luther is stealing it, so they call the police, resulting in Luther barely escaping arrest.

Luther attempts to set up Frosty the Snowman on his roof but fails, and ends up hanging by his legs from its electric cord. Scheel calls 9-1-1, and Luther is rescued. The Kranks are then rescued by everyone they&#x27;ve alienated, with the neighbors all pulling together and providing the noisy, festive Christmas celebration Blair is expecting. Blair calls saying she has arrived at the airport; injured Luther can&#x27;t get her so Vic sends the police who give her a hero&#x27;s welcome in the baggage claim and escort her home with her fiancé. As he slowly realizes that he has benefitted from the Christmas spirit of all his neighbors, Luther starts to celebrate Christmas willingly and gives his cruise tickets to the Scheels, who are having a very bad Christmas because his wife was just found with her third recurrence of breast cancer.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; observed, &quot;For all its clever curmudgeonly edge and minor charms, no way does this Christmas yarn from Grisham rank with &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, as the publisher claims. Nor does it rank with Grisham&#x27;s own best work. The premise is terrific, as you&#x27;d expect from Grisham ... But as clever as this setup is, its elaboration is ho-hum. There&#x27;s a good reason why nearly all classic Christmas tales rely on an element of fantasy, for, literarily at least, Christmas is a time of miracles. Grisham sticks to the mundane, however, and his story lacks magic for that ... The misanthropy in this short novel makes a good antidote to the more cloying Christmas tales, and the book is fun to read. To compare it to Dickens, however, is ... humbug.&quot;

Bruce Fretts of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; graded the book C+ and commented, &quot;Even at 177 minipages, &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; feels padded ... Despite a few nicely observed details ... Grisham mostly trades in stale fruitcake jokes and sub–&quot;Christmas Vacation&quot; slapstick. Like his recent coming-of-age novel, &quot;A Painted House&quot;, &quot;Skipping&quot; represents a departure for the king of the legal thrillers, but in this case, it&#x27;s to an unworthy destination.&quot;

<text>The Umatilla are a Sahaptin-speaking Native American tribe who traditionally inhabited the Columbia Plateau region of the northwestern United States, along the Umatilla and Columbia rivers.

The Umatilla people are called Imatalamłáma, a Umatilla person is called Imatalamłá (with orthographic ł representing IPA /ɬ/). Some sources say that &quot;Umatilla&quot; is derived from &quot;imatilám-hlama&quot;: &quot;hlama&quot; means &#x27;those living at&#x27; or &#x27;people of&#x27; and there is an ongoing debate about the meaning of &quot;imatilám&quot;, but it is said to be an island in the Columbia River. B. Rigsby and N. Rude mention the village of &quot;ímatalam&quot; that was situated at the mouth of the Umatilla River and where the language was spoken. The Nez Perce refer to the Umatilla people as &quot;hiyówatalampoo&quot; (Aoki (1994:171)).

==History==
===Early development===
The Umatilla nation was bordered by the Teninos (Tinaynuɫáma - &quot;People of Tináynu&quot;) to the West and the Klickitats (X̣ʷáłx̣ʷayłáma - &quot;Prairie People&quot;) to north, across the Columbia River. Also by their northern border were the Palouse, Wasco-Wishrams (Wasq̓ułáma - &quot;People of Wasq̓ú&quot;; Wɨ́šx̣amma - &quot;People of Wɨ́šx̣aa/Wɨ́šx̣am (Spearfish)&quot;). They had friendly Cayuse, and Walla Walla tribes to the east. Because their homeland lacked natural defenses, the Umatillas were attacked from the south by groups of Bannocks and Paiutes.

Linguistically, the Umatilla language or Imatalamłaamí Sɨ́nwit is part of the Sahaptin division of the Penutian language family — closely related to other peoples of today&#x27;s Eastern Oregon, Eastern Washington, and the Idaho panhandle. These included the Nez Percé (Šíwaniš - &quot;Stranger&quot;), Cayuse (Wáylatpu / Wáylatpuuma - &quot;Ryegrass People, i.e. Cayuse People&quot;), Walla Walla (Walawalałáma - &quot;People of Walula region along Walla Walla River&quot;), Palouse (Paluuspamá - &quot;People of Palus&quot;) and the Yakima (Mamačatłáma - &quot;Yakama People&quot;). These peoples were ravaged by smallpox and other infectious diseases contracted from European colonists during the first half of the 19th century.

In 1855 the inland Sahaptin-speaking nations were forced to surrender their historic homelands under treaty to the United States government, in exchange for territorial set-asides on reservations.

===Reservation period===
Today the Umatilla share land and a governmental structure with the Cayuse and the Walla Walla tribes as part of the federally recognized Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation. Their reservation is located near Pendleton, Oregon and the Blue Mountains.

A number of places and geographic features have been named after the tribe, such as the Umatilla River, Umatilla County, the town of Umatilla, Florida, and Umatilla National Forest. The impoundment of the Columbia River behind the John Day Dam is called Lake Umatilla.

==Notable Umatillas==
*Donald McKay – scout and leader of the Warm Springs Indians during the Modoc War
*Shoni Schimmel – WNBA player
*Acosia Red Elk – World Champion Jingle Dress Dancer, yoga instructor

<doc id="931082" wikidata="Q4205803" url="?curid=931082" title="Edmund Yates">
<text>Edmund Hodgson Yates (3 July 183120 May 1894) was a British journalist, novelist and dramatist.

==Early life==
He was born in Edinburgh to the actor and theatre manager Frederick Henry Yates and was educated at Highgate School in London from 1840 to 1846, and later in Düsseldorf. His first career was a clerk in the General Post Office, becoming in 1862 head of the missing letter department, and where he stayed until 1872. Meanwhile, he entered journalism, working on the &quot;Court Journal&quot; and then &quot;Daily News&quot;, under Charles Dickens.

In 1854 he published his first book &quot;My Haunts and their Frequenters,&quot; after which followed a succession of novels and plays. As a contributor to &quot;All the Year Round&quot; and &quot;Household Words&quot;, he gained the high opinion of Dickens, who was a friend; in the 1850s, Yates lived at No. 43 Doughty Street, London, close to Dickens&#x27;s former home at No. 48, which is now the Charles Dickens Museum.

==Journalism career==
In 1858 Yates was made editor of a new paper called &quot;Town Talk&quot;. His first number contained a laudatory article on Dickens, and the second a disparaging one on Thackeray, containing various personal references to private matters. Thackeray brought the article before the committee of the Garrick Club, of which he contended that Yates had made improper use, and the result was that Yates was expelled from the club. Besides editing the magazine &quot;Temple Bar&quot; and &quot;Tinsley&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, Yates during the 1860s took to lecturing on social topics, and published several books, including the novel &quot;Black Sheep&quot; (1867). In the &quot;Morning Star&quot;, under the heading of &quot;Le Flâneur&quot;, he continued the sort of column which he had inaugurated in the &quot;Illustrated Times&quot;. On his retirement from the Post Office he went to the United States on a lecture tour, and afterwards, as a special correspondent for the &quot;New York Herald&quot;, travelled through Europe.

Back in London, Yates was perhaps best known as proprietor and editor, under the pen-name of &quot;Atlas&quot;, of &quot;The World&quot; society newspaper, which he established in 1874 with Eustace Clare Grenville Murray, and which for a time was edited by Alexander Meyrick Broadley. &quot;The World&quot;, which was perceived as a newspaper chronicling upper class London Society, was a pioneer in &quot;personal journalism&quot;, such as the interview, which was later adopted by newspapers generally. He met Violet, Lady Greville at a party where he shared his patronising approach to her and her type. She revealed that she was the anonymous writer from whom Yates had been requesting work for the last two years. Prompted by Yates&#x27;s surprise that she was not a man, she decided to write under her own name in future.

In 1885 he was sentenced to four months&#x27; imprisonment for libelling Lord Lonsdale, yet in later life enjoyed a second career as a county magistrate.

Yates was also the author of, and performed in, &quot;Invitations&quot; at Egyptian Hall, London, which ran in 1862–1863. The work was a highly successful comedy in which he and Harold Littledale Power posed as hosts to a variety of singers and actors. Power also performed songs and imitations.

Edmund Yates wrote his autobiography titled &quot;Edmund Yates, His Recollections and Experiences&quot;, the first edition of which was published by Richard Bentley and Son in 1884.

Marie Corelli wrote of him: &quot;Too hastily judged by some, and maligned by others, he was to those who recognised his real character &#x27;a man among men&#x27; – a frank friend, an equally frank foe, and an open hater of all things mean and false and hypocritical.&quot; According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, &quot;He had been the typical &quot;flâneur&quot; in the literary world of the period, an entertaining writer and talker, with a talent for publicity of the modern type—developed, no doubt, from his theatrical parentage—which, through his imitators, was destined to have considerable influence on journalism.&quot;

<text>A silicon compiler is an electronic design automation software tool that is used for high-level synthesis of integrated circuits. Such tool takes a user&#x27;s specification of an IC design as input and automatically generates an integrated circuit (IC) design files as output for further fabrication by the semiconductor fabrication plant or manually from discrete components. The process is sometimes referred to as hardware compilation. The silicon compiler may use vendor&#x27;s Process Design Kit for the production.

== Overview ==
Silicon compilation takes place in three major steps:
* Use high level C to HDL converter
* Convert a hardware-description language such as Verilog or VHDL into logic (typically in the form of a &quot;netlist&quot;).
* Place equivalent logic gates on the IC. Silicon compilers typically use standard-cell libraries provided by manufacturers so that they do not have to worry about the actual integrated-circuit layout and can focus on the placement.
* Routing the standard cells together to form the desired logic.

Silicon compilation was first described in 1979 by David L. Johannsen, under the guidance of his thesis adviser, Carver Mead.

Johannsen, Mead, and Edmund K. Cheng subsequently founded Silicon Compilers Inc. (SCI) in 1981.

Edmund Cheng designed an Ethernet Data Link Controller chip in 1981–82 using structured design methodology, in order to drive the software and circuit-library development at SCI. The project went from concept to chip specification in 3 months, and from chip specification to tape-out in 5 months. Fabricated using a 3-micron NMOS process, the chip measured 50,600 square mils in die area, and was being marketed and manufactured in volume-production by 1983 under license from SCI.

John Wawrzynek at Caltech used some of the earliest silicon compilers in 1982 as part of the &quot;Yet Another Processor Project&quot; (YAPP), akin to YACC.

In 1983–84, the SCI team designed and implemented the data-path chip used in the MicroVAX in seven months.
MicroVAX&#x27;s data-path chip contains the entire 32-bit processor, except its microcode store and control-store sequencer, and contains 37,000 transistors.
At the time, chips with similar levels of complexity required about 3 years to design and implement.
Including those seven months, Digital Equipment Corporation completed the design and implementation of the MicroVAX within one year.
