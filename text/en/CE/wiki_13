<text>Setúbal ( , , ; ) is a city and a municipality in Portugal. The population of the entire municipality in 2014 was 118,166, occupying an area of . The city itself had 89,303 inhabitants in 2001. It lies within the Lisbon metropolitan area, about from Lisbon downtown by road.

In the times of Al-Andalus, the city was known as &quot;Shaṭūbar&quot; (Andalusian Arabic: ), after the old pre-Roman name of &quot;Cetobriga&quot;. In the 19th century, the port was called &quot;Saint Ubes&quot; in English, and &quot;Saint-Yves&quot; in French.

The municipal holiday is 15 September, which marks the date in 1860 when King Pedro V of Portugal officially recognised Setúbal as a city.

==City information==
The city of Setúbal is located on the northern bank of the Sado River estuary, approximately south of Portugal&#x27;s capital, Lisbon. It is also the seat of the Setúbal District and formerly in the historic Estremadura Province.

In the beginning of the 20th century, Setúbal was the most important center of Portugal&#x27;s fishing industry, particularly specializing in processing and exporting sardines. None of the many factories then created are operating today. However, the existing maritime ports, either traditional, commercial and the new marines, keep the city&#x27;s links to the ocean and water well alive and vibrant. Tourism, based on the beautiful natural conditions plus excellent hotels, resorts and infrastructures, is one of the city&#x27;s most appreciated resources, due to its interconnection with the Sado (river) on one side and Atlantic Ocean on another, having a coast line with both. The city is also connected with the nearby coast of the Arrábida hills natural park - which offers an unspoiled nature and beautiful beaches to the Atlantic Ocean. A dolphin colony inhabits the Sado River. Across the river on the south bank lies the peninsula of Tróia, a place with vast white/golden sand beaches where several luxury hotels and resorts were recently built. The Tróia peninsula can be sighted from the city, across the river. Albarquel, Figueirinha, Galápos, Galapinhos, Creiro and Portinho da Arrábida are some of the city&#x27;s many beaches, located in the north bank of the estuary, at the very beginning of the Arrábida hills.

==History==

In antiquity the city was known as Cetobriga, a Turdetani settlement that came under Roman control in the province of Lusitania.

==Culture==

The main historical monument of the city of Setúbal is the Monastery of Jesus, which is a 15th- and 16th-century church that represents one of the first buildings in the Portuguese late Gothic style known as Manueline.

It was in this building where the first treaty that divided the world between two powers was signed by King John II, nicknamed the perfect prince.

The Roman Catholic Church has a diocese, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Setúbal, headquartered in the city, with its see (seat of the bishop) at the Our Lady of Grace Cathedral, Setúbal, famous for its Mannerist façade.

Also of interest are the São Julião Church, also with Manueline portals. The &quot;Castelo de São Filipe&quot;, is a 16th- and 17th-century fortress on the north bank of the Sado river, overseeing the city. The fortress was converted into a luxury hotel (&quot;pousada&quot;).

The fortress ordered to be built by King Sebastian is wrongly attributed to King Philip I. Filippo Terzi had been hired in 1575 by Sebastian precisely to protect and reinforce the Portuguese coast against piracy that was ravaging the entire Mediterranean and Atlantic.

Teatro Animação de Setúbal is based in Setúbal.

The island has been under Russian administration since the end of World War II, when Soviet forces took possession of the Kurils. It is claimed by Japan (see Kuril Islands dispute).

==Geography==
Kunashir is separated by the Catherine Strait (Kunashiri Suido) from the island of Iturup, located 22 km northeast; Kunashir Strait (upper Nemuro Kaikyo) from Shiretoko Peninsula (Hokkaido Island), located 25 km to the west; Izmena Strait (Notsuke Suido or lower Nemuro Kaikyo) from Notsuke Peninsula (Hokkaido Island), located 16 km to the southwest; and by the South Kuril Strait (Yuzhno-Kurilski Proliv, Minami Chishima Kaikyo) from Shikotan and the Habomai Islands, 50 km to the east. Kunashir Island is visible from the nearby Japanese island of Hokkaido, from which it is separated by the Nemuro Strait.

Kunashir Island is formed by four volcanoes which were separate islands but have since joined together by low-lying areas with lakes and hot springs. All four volcanoes are still active: Tyatya (), Smirnov, Mendeleyeva (Rausu-yama), and Golovnin (Tomari-yama). The island is made up of volcanic and crystalline rocks.

== Geology ==

Kunashir, the southernmost island of the Kuril Arc, is 123 km long (NE to SW), 7 to 30 km wide and has an area of 1,490 km². The island comprised several volcanic features, including active ones such as Tyatya (1,819 m), Ruruy (1,485 m), Mendeleev (886 m) and Golovnin (541 m). The terrain of Kunashir was rugged and mountainous, with young geomorphology, steep slopes and numerous waterfalls. Asymmetry in relief is notable, with the western (Okhotsk) shore being steep and elevated, in contrast to the eastern (Pacific) shore, which has a more level and flat topography.

In contrast to the Japan Arc, the absolute timing of the evolution of the primary Kuril Arc system has received comparatively little attention, particularly with respect to modern geochronological techniques. A recent study (de Grave, 2015) aimed to fill this gap by presenting the initial zircon U/Pb ages of the volcanic basement and thermochronological ages for the rocks of Kunashir Island, thus establishing a definitive temporal framework for their emplacement and subsequent exhumation.
The volcanic rocks of the Kuril Islands generally exhibited a two-level structural classification: (1) a lower level consisting mainly of moderately deformed Neogene rocks, and (2) an upper level comprising Pleistocene to recent volcanics. These rocks exhibited a wide range of compositions from basalt to rhyolite, with a predominance of (basaltic) andesites (Martynov et al.).

The geology of Kunashir Island could be elucidated from this perspective by delineating two structural levels. The lower level, termed the Lower Complex, was characterised by yellowish to yellow-grey tuffs, tuffaceous sandstones and breccias, mainly of felsic to medium composition. Numerous subvolcanic stocks and plugs of andesite, dacite and rhyolite intruded these formations, with deeper intrusive rocks of granodiorite porphyry composition and texture (Vergunov; Vergunov and Vlasov; Sergeev; Piskunov and Rybin). The upper level, termed the Upper Complex, was characterised by basaltic and basaltic andesite flows, small sub-volcanic intrusive bodies and modern andesitic stratovolcanoes.

Previous studies (Davydov et al.; Vitukhin et al.) suggested a late Miocene to Pliocene age for the Lower Complex, and accordingly older rocks were either absent or not clearly identified on the island. The Lower Complex has been further subdivided into the Rybakov and Kamuy formations (e.g. Zhelubovsky and Pryaluhina; Bevz), although Martynov et al. used a different classification and terminology (see below). The Rybakov Formation, located in the most uplifted and deeply exhumed blocks, especially in the northern part of the island, was mainly an andesitic volcanic complex. This formation correlates with what Martynov et al. termed the Miocene Greentuff Formation. The Kamuy Formation, which forms the backbone of the island, consisted mainly of flysch-like volcanic-sedimentary deposits rich in felsic pumice of (rhyo)dacitic composition, with a thickness exceeding 1100 m (Martynov et al.).
The Upper Complex, represented by the Fregat Formation, overlies the Rybakov and Kamuy Formations (Lower Complex). A distinct structural and erosional unconformity separated these complexes. The Fregat Formation comprised subaerial (basaltic) andesitic lava flows interbedded with tuffs, hyaloclastites and basaltic breccias (Syvorotkin and Rusinova). This suggests that the Fregat volcanic rocks are predominantly of sub-aerial origin, occasionally deposited at shallow depths below sea level. The Fregat volcanic deposits formed a distinctive volcanic plateau, formed near sea level and affected by subsequent tectonic movements, resulting in the fragmented table-top mountainous topography of Kunashir (Syvorotkin and Rusinova, 1989). The age of the Fregat Formation was determined to be late Pliocene to early Pleistocene based on diatoms (Neodenticula kamtschatica – N. Koizumii) and palynology (Dunichev, 1969), in agreement with K-Ar data from the Fregat basalts.

On Kunashir, the Late Miocene-Early Pliocene Rybakov Formation was exclusively formed under subaqueous conditions. The volcanic rocks of the middle Pliocene Kamuy Formation, assigned to subaerial conditions in the northern and central parts of Kunashir Island, indicate a subaqueous environment in the southern part. Intensive uplift, beginning in the second half of the Pliocene, led to significant tectonic movements between the accumulation of the Kamuy and Fregat formations in the late Pliocene. This resulted in a pronounced unconformity between the two, with the Fregat lava plateau experiencing differential vertical movement. The northern part of Kunashir showed substantial uplift of over 1 km, in contrast to the more modest elevation change of 200–300 m in the southern region (Syvorotkin and Rusinova, cit opt.). Sergeev reported a mid to late Miocene deformation event at Kunashir, associated with folding of the Kunashir &#x27;basement&#x27; and emplacement of Miocene intrusions, accompanied by at least 1.5 km of uplift and denudation.

Four modern and active (Pleistocene to Holocene) stratovolcanoes have shaped the modern landscape of Kunashir Island. These volcanoes, characterised by a typical alternation of lava flows and tuff deposits, exhibited mainly basaltic-andesitic to andesitic compositions, with minor amounts of more differentiated magmas of dacitic affinity. This modern magmatic activity was closely linked to the subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the Okhotsk Plate (Martynov et al., 2010a). Among these, Tyatya Volcano stands out as one of the most active and best studied volcanoes in the Kuril Arc (Nakagawa et al.).

Both the Lower and Upper Complexes were characterized by numerous sub-volcanic intrusions, with the Lower Complex also containing deeper intrusions. In the Rybakov Formation these intrusions manifested as stocks, dikes and sills of basaltic, andesitic and dacitic composition. The Kamuy Formation contained mainly dacite stocks, dikes and sills. Deeper-seated igneous rocks without volcanic analogs were represented by two distinct intrusive complexes: (1) the Prasolov Complex, which included gabbro, diorite, quartz diorite, granodiorite, and tonalite or plagiogranite, and (2) the Dokuchaev Complex, which included three small bodies of fine-grained porphyritic granodiorite and tonalite (Vergunov and Vlasov, cit. opt.; Kovtunovich et al).
The Prasolov plagiogranite (tonalite) – diorite complex consisted of three distinct plutons: the Prasolov, Mechnikov and Lobanov massifs (Vergunov and Vlasov, 1964; Sergeev, 1976, cit. opt.). The Prasolov Massif, the largest with an area of 18 km², located in NE Kunashir, acted as a stock. Intrusive contacts with the rocks of the Rybakov Formation were mainly tectonic, with rare intrusive contacts showing contact aureoles characterised by quartz-biotite hornfels. The Prasolov Complex was inferred to be of relatively late Miocene to Pliocene age based on intrusive contacts, the presence of pebbles from Prasolov Complex granitoids in the Kamuy Formation sediments, and K-Ar ages ranging from 61 ± 12 to about 10 Ma (most common ages found between 11e10 Ma) (Rybin, 1994).

The Dokuchaev Granitoid Complex, younger than the Prasolov Complex, comprised three small stocks that cut across the Kamuy Formation. Intrusive contacts were observed and Kamuy xenoliths were present (Vergunov and Vlasov, cit. opt.). The Dokuchaev Complex, consisting of tonalite-porphyry, granodiorite-porphyry and diorite-porphyry, is an amalgamation of the Dokuchaev, Valentina and Orlov massifs. The Valentina Massif, a tonalite-porphyry stock along the Okhotsk coast in the northern part of Kunashir, showed tectonic rather than intrusive contacts. A Pliocene age for Dokuchaev has been proposed on the basis of geological and K-Ar data, with rocks from the Dokuchaev complex having reported K-Ar ages of 6.5e4.2 Ma, corresponding to late Miocene to early Pliocene age (Rybin).

===Environment===

The climate is humid continental with very heavy precipitation especially in the autumn and a strong seasonal lag with maximum temperatures in August and September. The vegetation mostly consists of spruce, pine, fir, and mixed deciduous forests with lianas and Kuril bamboo underbrush. The mountains are covered with birch and Siberian Dwarf Pine scrub, herbaceous flowers or bare rocks. Tree cores of century-old oaks &quot;(Quercus crispula)&quot; were found in July 2001 on Kunashiri Island.

===Important Bird Area===
Kunashir, along with the neighbouring Lesser Kuril Chain of smaller islands, has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International as the island supports populations of various threatened bird species, including many waterbirds, seabirds and waders.

==History==
The original inhabitants of the islandas with most of Hokkaido and the Kurilswere the Ainu. Europeans are first recorded visiting this part of the Kurils in 1643 when the under Dutch cartographer Maarten Gerritsz Vries was exploring Hokkaido and the surrounding area for the Dutch East India Company (VOC). Vries&#x27;s account of the area was incredibly garbledincluding a fictitious continental extension dubbed Company Landbut while his imaginary Staten Island is usually connected to Iturup, its placement on most maps of the period more closely resembles the location of Kunashir. Vitus Bering&#x27;s lieutenant Martin Spanberg mapped the actual locations of the Kurils including Kunashir in a series of voyages in 1738, 1739, and 1742 but Company Land and Staten Island continued to appear in European maps decades afterwards.

The Japanese expanded north to Kunashir in the 18th century, with the Matsumae clan establishing a fishery and trading site called &quot;Kunashiri-basho&quot; () in 1754. Its headquarters was located in Tomari (present-day Golovnino) and administered Kunashir, Iturup, and Urup.

In 1789 Kunashir Island was one of the settings of the Menashi-Kunashiri Battle in which native Ainu revolted against Yamato Japanese tradespeople and colonists.
Russian navigator Vasily Golovnin attempted to map and explore the island in 1811, but was apprehended by Japanese authorities and spent two years in prison.
On 1 September 1945, or one day before the surrender documents of World War II were signed on 2 September 1945, in accordance with understandings reached at the Yalta Conference, the Soviet Union invaded and occupied the Kuril Islands. This occurred after the Soviet Union renounced the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact signed in April 1941, and declared war on Japan on 9 August 1945 (formally, the pact itself remained in effect until 13 April 1946). Although Japan agreed after deliberations to cede its claims to &quot;the Kurile Islands&quot; as part of the Treaty of San Francisco in 1951, the Japanese government has claimed since the mid-1950s that the southern islands were not part of the ceded Kuril Islands.

==Settlements==
The largest settlement on Kunashir Island is Yuzhno-Kurilsk, administrative center of Yuzhno-Kurilsky District.

==Economy==
The primary economic activity is fishing. The island has a port next to Yuzhno-Kurilsk. Kunashir Island enjoys a Mendeleevskaya GeoPP geothermal power plant with the capacity of 1.8 MW.

==Transport==
The island is served by Mendeleyevo Airport.

==Population==
After the 1994 earthquake, about one-third of Kunashir Island&#x27;s population left and did not return. By 2002, the island&#x27;s population was approximately 7,800. The total population of the disputed Kuril islands at that time was approximately 17,000.

<text>Ezra Brooks is a brand of Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey owned and marketed by MGP Ingredients. It is primarily bottled at 40% abv (80 U.S. proof) or 45% abv (90 U.S. proof).

The Ezra Brooks brand was created by Frank Silverman in 1957 and was bottled at the Hoffman Distilling Company, in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky, up until Hoffman Distilling Co. went out of business in the 1970s. In 1993, Ezra Brooks was purchased by Luxco of St. Louis, Missouri (formerly the David Sherman Company, renamed in 2006). Ezra Brooks is distilled at Luxco&#x27;s Lux Row Distillers in &quot;bourbon county&quot; Bardstown, Kentucky, along with Luxco&#x27;s other whiskey brands Rebel Yell, David Nicholson, and Blood Oath.

In April 2021, MGP Ingredients completed its acquisition of Luxco.

<text>Meijer Inc. (, ) is an American supercenter chain that primarily operates throughout the Midwestern United States. Its corporate headquarters are in Walker, Michigan. Founded in 1934 as a supermarket chain, Meijer is credited with pioneering the modern supercenter concept in 1962. About half of the company&#x27;s 259 stores are located in Michigan; the others are in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio and Wisconsin. The chain is ranked by Forbes as the 14th-largest private company in the United States, and is the country&#x27;s 23rd-largest retailer by revenue as of 2023.

==History==
Meijer was founded as Meijer&#x27;s in Greenville, Michigan, in 1934 by Hendrik Meijer, a Dutch immigrant. Meijer was a local barber who entered the grocery business during the Great Depression. His first employees included his 14-year-old son, Frederik Meijer, who later became chairman of the company. The current co-chairmen, brothers Hank and Doug Meijer, are Hendrik&#x27;s grandsons. After studying trends in the grocery industry, Meijer was among the first stores to offer self-service shopping and shopping carts. He also offered staple items, such as vinegar, at bargain prices.

The Greenville store was successful and additional Meijer groceries were opened in Cedar Springs (1942) and Ionia (1946). The first Grand Rapids store opened on South Division Avenue in 1949. By the 1960s, the company had over two dozen stores located throughout West Michigan.

In 1962 Meijer launched its modern format with a store at the corner of 28th Street and Kalamazoo Avenue in Grand Rapids called &quot;Thrifty Acres.&quot; At a size of , it combined grocery shopping and department store shopping in a single large store. The store was built with floors, so should the concept fail, the nongrocery half could be converted into an indoor car dealership. New stores were built in the same manner until the mid-1970s, when an architect mentioned the extra cost to management. This was followed by the first Mid-Michigan location in Delta Charter Township in 1966. Meijer expanded into Southeast Michigan in the early 1970s, beginning with a store in Ypsilanti in 1972 followed by their first Metro Detroit location in Canton in 1974. Meijer expanded into Northern Michigan with a location in Traverse City in 1977.

Fred Meijer took over the company upon his father&#x27;s death in 1964. Under his leadership, the Thrifty Acres stores became a success and were renamed Meijer in 1986. Meijer&#x27;s stand-alone grocery operations continued until the early 1990s, as the larger stores became dominant. In 1985 &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine reported Walmart at the time had failed in what were then known as hypermarkets because Sam Walton and company did not understand the grocery business.

Walton launched the first Hypermart USA store in 1987, opening only four stores, the last in 1990. An article in &quot;Forbes Magazine&quot; said Meijer understood the importance of the food business, and it was not something just tacked onto a discount store. The quality of the produce is very important; poor-quality produce sold by Walmart was the main reason for their lack of success. By contrast, surveys said then and now that Meijer ranks high on produce quality.
During the mid-1990s, Meijer expanded to three additional states. The first location in Indiana opened on Grape Road in Mishawaka on April 19, 1994, followed by the first Illinois store in Champaign (Store #146) on April 4, 1995. In 1996, the first regular Kentucky Meijer location in Florence opened, along with four nearby locations in Ohio which were Fairfield, Loveland, West Chester and Eastgate North Drive in Cincinnati. This also marked the chain&#x27;s reentry into that state. Two more Kentucky locations would open on Paul Jones Way in Lexington and Towne Center Drive in Louisville in 1997. In 1998 three new Meijer locations opened in the Louisville area on Dixie Highway, Preston Highway and South Hurstbourne Parkway.

The first Meijer location in the Northwest Indiana region opened in August 1997 in Michigan City. Following this, the Merrillville location opened to the public on August 4, 1998, while the Highland location officially opened on April 20, 1999. The first Meijer location in the Chicago region opened on August 3, 1999, on Weber Road in Bolingbrook. A year later in 2000, three Illinois Meijer locations would open in Aurora, St. Charles and Springfield. Another Meijer store in Bolingbrook opened on Boughton Road by The Promenade in May 2002, three years after the Weber Road location.
With the increasing dominance of Walmart throughout the country during the 1990s and up to the present, Meijer is facing the effects of an intensely competitive retail industry. In late 2003 the company laid off 350 people from the corporate offices, distribution centers and field offices; a few months later, in January 2004, Meijer laid off 1,896 employees and managerial staff, leading to speculation that the company was losing profitability and market share. A marketing professor, Dr. Ben Rudolph of Grand Valley State University near Meijer&#x27;s corporate headquarters, lambasted this move, saying they &quot;apparently blinked&quot; and that Meijer&#x27;s &quot;decision was driven by panic&quot;. Continuing cutbacks in 2006, the company outsourced 81 information technology positions to India.

In 2003, the company announced that all new Meijer stores would feature an entirely new format and company image, complete with a new logo intended to make the Meijer stores seem &quot;friendly&quot; and inviting. The company hired New York City&#x27;s Rockwell Group to redesign the existing stores and establish a design for new stores. The &quot;new theatrics&quot; for the then-71-year-old company originally started as a &quot;new product introduction program&quot; until David Rockwell talked Hank and Fred Meijer into further changes. Rockwell told the Meijers the new introduction program would &quot;work only if it was part of a new overall creative foundation based on a fresher, younger approach, encompassing architecture, interior design and graphic design&quot;. In 2005, despite cutbacks, Meijer embarked on an expansion plan to increase its number of stores in Illinois, Michigan and Ohio. In April 2003 Meijer selected DeVito/Verdi, an award-winning advertising agency in New York, to handle its $25 million account.

In May 2007, the first LEED-certified Meijer store opened in the second phase of the Fairlane Green development in Allen Park, Michigan. In July 2007 Meijer announced to the Michigan press it would be &quot;restructuring&quot; its Team Leader management positions in all 181 stores, stating layoffs would be &quot;minimal&quot; and necessary &quot;to handle more sophisticated products such as flat-screen TVs and high-priced wines&quot;. Their spokesperson also said the changes were &quot;not about a labor reduction&quot;, but fitting people into the right roles. No corporate staff or hourly workers were directly affected. In August 2007, the store announced they were cutting about 500 managers (12% of existing management staff). The 500 were given severance packages, while other managers were transferred to other stores or &quot;reassigned to different positions&quot;.

In 2009, the chain announced a new concept in the Chicago region called Meijer Marketplace which comprises smaller stores that focus more on grocery items and pharmacy. Four such stores were eventually opened, in Niles (2010), Orland Park (2010), Melrose Park (2011) and Berwyn (2012). The Niles store closed on June 18, 2016. The Melrose Park and Berwyn stores closed on June 17, 2017 (the Berwyn store space now houses Tony&#x27;s Fresh Market, which had relocated from its previous location at the former Dominick&#x27;s store in North Riverside in 2018), leaving the Orland Park store as the last remaining small-format Meijer in operation.

On November 25, 2011, Frederik Meijer died at the age of 91. In 2013, Meijer opened its 200th supercenter in Swartz Creek, Michigan.
Meijer opened its first store within the city of Detroit, located in the Gateway Marketplace development, on July 25, 2013, and its second location within the city, located on the site of the former Redford High School at Grand River Avenue and McNichols Road, on June 11, 2015. Meijer opened its first locations in Wisconsin in June 2015. To help promote itself in Wisconsin, Meijer purchased a distribution center in Pleasant Prairie from SuperValu in 2012, and placed an advertisement along the outfield wall of Miller Park, home of the Milwaukee Brewers, in 2014 in anticipation of the company&#x27;s expansion into Wisconsin.

In 2014, Meijer expanded into their southern-most store, Bowling Green, Kentucky, with a new development in the growing Gary Farms retail corridor. Meijer&#x27;s parking lot also includes a Tesla supercharger.

Meijer bought the largely vacant Memorial Mall in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, in March 2015. Much of the existing structure was demolished, and replaced with a new store in April 2019.

In 2017–2018 Meijer expanded into the Northeastern Wisconsin market with stores in Howard and Grand Chute. The Howard location serves Green Bay with the Grand Chute location serving Appleton and the Fox Cities. Meijer also opened their first stores in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in 2017 with stores in Escanaba and Sault Ste. Marie, later adding a third location in Marquette.

In 2019, Meijer expanded into the Cleveland–Akron market with stores in Stow, Mentor, and Avon. Meijer also expanded into the Youngstown area with a store in Boardman, Ohio, in 2020 as well as Austintown.

In June 2024, Meijer was reported to be scouting the Western Pennsylvania region, including Pittsburgh, for a possible expansion. Such a move would mark Meijer&#x27;s first presence in Pennsylvania as a whole.

==Operations==

Meijer stores are classified as supercenters or hypermarkets (a superstore that combines groceries and department store goods in the same store). Most stores (about 80%) also feature an adjacent Meijer-branded gas station and convenience store. Several Meijer gas stations feature alternative fuels, such as E85, biodiesel and compressed natural gas as well as electric vehicle charging stations.

Meijer has 259 stores in Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, northern and central Illinois, and Northern Kentucky. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, most Meijer stores were open 24 hours a day, 364 days a year, closing only at 7 p.m. on Christmas Eve, and reopening at 6 a.m. on December 26. In 2013 Meijer ranked No. 19 in Forbes list of top 20 Private Companies.

===Other Meijer-owned stores===
In addition to the original Meijer supermarkets and hypermarkets, Meijer opened several concept stores in the 1970s and 1980s. The first were specialty clothing store chains called Copper Rivet, Sagebrush and Casual Court. Each store focused on a different form of brand-name clothing: Copper Rivet sold Levi&#x27;s jeans, Sagebrush sold casual wear, and Casual Court sold women&#x27;s clothing. All three chains usually operated in front of existing Meijer stores, or in nearby shopping centers. Casual Court was renamed Tansy in 1982. These clothing chains were dissolved in the 1980s as brand-name clothing became more readily available at competing retailers. Sagebrush, which at its peak comprised 71 stores, was sold off in 1988, while Copper Rivet and Tansy stores were closed as their leases expired.

In 1980, Meijer began a discount pharmacy chain called Spaar (from the Dutch word for &quot;save&quot;), which opened four stores in 1980 in former Meijer supermarket locations. The Spaar stores were sold to Pontiac, Michigan-based Perry Drug Stores by the mid-1980s.

One year after launching the Spaar brand, in 1981, Meijer began opening Meijer Square stores, which were traditional discount department stores lacking a full grocery section. Fourteen locations of Buffalo, New York-based Twin Fair, predominantly in southwestern Ohio, were bought and converted to the Meijer Square name. Two Meijer Square stores were also opened in Michigan. The Ohio locations were largely sold to Zayre and Hills. Meijer returned to Cincinnati and soon Kentucky in May 1996, after both Hills and Ames had closed all of their Ohio stores.

Meijer opened its first warehouse club store, SourceClub, in 1992. The concept proved unsuccessful in competition against Sam&#x27;s Club and Costco, and all seven SourceClub stores were closed in 1994. The location in Fraser, Michigan, was converted to a regular Meijer store, while the rest were shuttered or sold off.

====Small-format markets====

In 2018, Meijer opened Bridge Street Market, a concept grocery store in Grand Rapids. It was followed by four similar markets: Woodward Corner Market in Royal Oak, Michigan (2020); Capital City Market in Lansing (2020); Rivertown Market in Detroit (2021); and Fairfax Market in Cleveland (2024).

==== Meijer Grocery ====

Introduced in 2023, Meijer Grocery is a standard-sized grocery store concept. The first two locations, in Lake Orion and Macomb Township, Michigan, opened on January 26, 2023. A third location opened in Noblesville, Indiana on July 11, 2024.

====Fresh Thyme Market====

During the 2010s, Meijer appeared to control or own the regional organic food supermarket chain Fresh Thyme Farmers Market, but official records were not very clear about the relationship between the two companies. In 2021, the organic food supermarket chain began to offer a &quot;broad assortment of Meijer branded items&quot;.

In April 2014, Fresh Thyme founder Chris Sherrell opened the first store in his chain in Mount Prospect, Illinois. Two months later, Fresh Thyme open its first Indiana store in Indianapolis. The opening of the first store in Ohio followed in July in Columbus. By the end of 2014, the chain had nine stores in the Midwest.

By January 2024, Fresh Thyme had 70 stores across 10 Midwestern states.

==Marketing and sponsorship==
In 2006, Meijer donated money to Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan, to create the paid position called the Frederik Meijer Chair of Dutch Language and Culture. The previous chair was unpaid. Its purpose is to promote interest in the Netherlands and Michigan&#x27;s Dutch cultural heritage.

In 2014, Meijer was the first retailer to accept both Apple Pay and CurrentC for purchases in its stores and gas stations despite possible penalties from Merchant Customer Exchange for accepting Apple Pay.

On May 25, 2023, the Detroit Tigers of the MLB announced that Meijer had become their official jersey patch partner. Meijer also sponsors the Detroit Red Wings of the NHL with Meijer&#x27;s logo on their helmets.

==Store design==

Meijer stores are typically designed with the supermarket section to one side and the general merchandise section to the other side. The chain&#x27;s stores are almost always constructed from the ground up, with very few Meijer stores having been converted from other retailers. Exceptions include the:

* Lincoln Park, Michigan and Portage, Indiana stores, both of which were former Super Kmart stores, though the latter was significantly renovated during conversion to Meijer and the former would also receive a significant renovation in 2021
* Traverse City, Michigan store, a former Grant City store which closed in 1977, and has since undergone significant renovations, most recently in 2023
* Sterling Heights, Michigan, the former location on Metropolitan Parkway (which relocated to Madison Heights, Michigan, in 2002, and was subsequently demolished for Target and Lowe&#x27;s stores), which was also a former Grant City, 
* Fraser, Michigan, which Meijer converted from its failed SourceClub concept store
* Newark, Ohio (which closed in 2013 and was subsequently converted into a Kroger Marketplace store), which was one of the stores Meijer purchased from Twin Fair.

Some stores built in the 1960s and 1970s, including a since-demolished location on Pierson Road in Mount Morris Township, Michigan (which marked the chain&#x27;s entry into the Flint market in 1972), included a balcony, containing service tenants such as a barber shop and nail salon. During the late 1990s, McDonald&#x27;s restaurants also operated inside Meijer stores, primarily in those with balconies, though some locations without balconies like Taylor, Michigan; Muncie, Indiana, and the location on Alexis Road in Toledo, Ohio, also had McDonald&#x27;s locations; in addition, the first stores in the Detroit area featured a short-lived fast food concept called Thrifty&#x27;s Kitchen, which also operated a standalone location in front of the Meijer on Alpine Avenue in Walker. Most stores feature a sit-down café, while some also feature a Starbucks coffee shop or a Subway restaurant. Stores built between 1989 and 1993 featured a curved wall of windows that ran along the area between the entrances, examples include many early locations in Ohio and the Midland, Michigan store (many of these such stores have since been renovated into the current exterior design described below).

Early in the 1990s, Meijer developed new integrated prototypes for their rollouts. One example was the &quot;whimsical&quot; design prototype introduced with the 1994 expansion into Indiana. Different shapes and roofing designs created the facade of the building. Most notable was the yellow pineapple constructed from yellow ceramic brick and glass blocks. The different shapes on the facade were to introduce Meijer to Indiana as a &quot;store of discovery&quot;.

Also notable was the use of a large translucent wall above the grand concourse facing the registers. This allowed natural light to filter into the area above the registers without actual windows. Another feature of these stores was the introduction of grey concrete panels and silver framing on windows and doors. Slight variations of this prototype were also introduced with the 1995 expansion into Illinois and the 1996 reentry into Kentucky.

On August 5, 1997, the store in Fort Gratiot Township, Michigan, debuted a new prototype that evolved out of the mid-1990s prototype. This was the Presidential prototype, in which the logo was moved to the center of the building. Later Meijer stores of this design introduced the Meijer Fresh logo with the then-current Meijer logo and a large cursive &quot;Fresh&quot; on the right of the Meijer name. Most of these signs have since been phased out in favor of the current logo, with the lower-case &quot;meijer&quot; (in red) with blue dots over the &#x27;i&#x27; and &#x27;j&#x27;. In the year 2000 the Presidential prototype was replaced with the Village Square prototype, which featured fake storefronts running across the front of the building and a barn-like section on which the Meijer logo was situated. That prototype, however, was soon replaced by the Signature Series prototype, which removed the fake storefronts, which itself was replaced in the mid-2000s with the current prototype, which features emphasis on the entrances, which feature towering glass walls with a tilted roof, resulting in an &quot;eyebrow&quot; appearance.

==&quot;Hypermarket&quot;==

Meijer was the first retailer to launch the &quot;supermarket&quot; or &quot;superstore&quot; in the U.S., combining a multitude of merchandise under one roof, when they opened the first Thrifty Acres in 1962. Meijer describes itself as a grocery chain that added general merchandise to their grocery stores in 1962.

==Controversies and criticism==

===Acme Township, Michigan===

In February 2007, Meijer was involved in an effort to recall the elected officials of Acme Township in Grand Traverse County, because of the officials&#x27; reluctance to allow a new store along M-72 within the rural township east of Traverse City. Meijer retained Seyferth, Spaulding and Tennyson, a Grand Rapids public relations firm, to help orchestrate the recall effort.

Records indicate the PR firm retained by Meijer had arranged a meeting with a small nonprofit organization which favored the Meijer store, but had not yet formally taken a position on the recall. With the persuasion of the PR firm, the organization, known as the &quot;Acme Taxpayers for Responsible Government&quot;, formed a recall committee and began to promote the recall election. Seyferth researched the plausibility of a recall, wrote justification for the recall and oversaw the agenda for the meeting with Acme Taxpayers. The PR firm revised the organization&#x27;s website and logo, devised talking points and campaign literature, and wrote ghost letters to Traverse City newspapers. The recall committee did not disclose any of the PR firm&#x27;s assistance, or its affiliation with Meijer. The company was fined $190,000 for its actions. The store eventually opened in November 2015, with thousands attending the long-awaited grand opening.

===Treatment of LGBT community===
Meijer scored 0% on the 2008 Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index, which is a measure of how U.S. companies and businesses are treating gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender employees, consumers and investors. Meijer was one of only three companies out of over 500 graded to receive a score of 0.

In 2009, Meijer&#x27;s score began to improve after the company amended its nondiscrimination policy to include sexual orientation. Other retail and grocery rivals&#x27; scores are Macy&#x27;s Inc. (100%), Sears Holdings Corporation (100%), Target Corporation (100%), Whole Foods Market (90%), Kroger (75%) and Walmart (40%). By 2016, Meijer had increased their score to 85%, having a similar score to its rivals.

In 2020, Meijer&#x27;s score increased to a 100% with the Human Rights Campaign&#x27;s Corporate Equality Index, which joined 680 major U.S. businesses that also scored a 100% that year.

===Firing of a Christian employee===
The federal government sued Meijer on behalf of a former employee for violating her civil rights by firing her because she would not work on Sundays. Debra Kerkstra was fired in 2001 for refusing to work on Sunday because of religious convictions. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission accused Meijer of religious discrimination, and Meijer settled the case after paying $22,000 to Kerkstra and agreeing to implement procedures to prevent repeat occurrences.

<text>The Porsche 935 is a race car that was developed and manufactured by German automaker Porsche. Introduced in 1976 as the factory racing version of the 911 (930) Turbo and prepared for FIA-Group 5 rules, it was an evolution of the Carrera RSR 2.1 turbo prototype, the second place overall finisher in the 1974 24 Hours of Le Mans.

Beginning with the 1977 season, Porsche offered the 935 to customers entering the World Championship for Makes, in the IMSA GT Championship and in the German Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft (DRM). The 935 went on to win the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans overall, and other major endurance races, including Sebring, Daytona, and the 1,000 km Nürburgring. Of the 370 races it was entered, it won 123.

Usually, no other make could challenge the 935, as other manufacturers did not supply customer cars as Porsche did. Each race, at the time, typically featured at least five 935s. The 935 used a 3.3L &quot;Type 935&quot; twin-turbocharged flat-six engine which used a mechanical fuel injection system. All of the high performance components combined enabled the engine to have a power output up to , the engine often produced turbo lag at low RPM due to the large turbochargers. The dominance of the 935 ended with changes in the FIA rules which came into effect in 1982, replacing the six numbered groups with only three groups, namely A, B and C.

The second generation of the 935 started a limited-production to just 77 units, with customer deliveries in June 2019.

== 935/76 ==

For 1976, endurance racing had two world championships: the 1976 FIA World Championship for Makes for Group 5 special production cars, and the 1976 World Sportscar Championship season for Group 6 prototypes up to 3.0 L. Accordingly, the 935 and the new Porsche 936 were the two-pronged Porsche effort for 1976 which was sponsored by Martini Racing, which had already supported Porsche 917 or 908 entries in 1970 and 1971, like the 1971 Le Mans winner.

Each championship had seven races, with only Dijon hosting both on the same weekend, while on two other weekends, the races were even run in different countries, which forced Porsche to divide its resources. Jacky Ickx and Jochen Mass were the main drivers, when the F1 schedule permitted. Rolf Stommelen, who was recovering from his bad crash in the 1975 Spanish GP, was the backup, along with Manfred Schurti.

Under Group 5 rules, also known as &quot;silhouette rules&quot;, several significant modifications were allowed (including bodywork modifications, larger wings, wider axles and water cooling), provided that the basic silhouette of the car remain unchanged when viewed from the front. The 935&#x27;s engine was a (at 7,900 rpm) version of the regular 3.0 L flat-six, with 60 mkp (438lb-ft, 588Nm) torque at 5,400 rpm. Boost was between 1.35 and 1.55 and fuel consumption was 52 litre per 100 km. Capacity was reduced to 2.85 L, and with the turbo charging penalty factor of 1.4, it fit into the 4.0 L class which had a prescribed minimum weight of only . Porsche, having a lot of experience with lightweight cars, had managed to get the Carrera RSR prototype to under 800 kg. The empty 935 tipped the scales at 900 kg, and weight distribution could be balanced with an additional 70 kg. Preseason testing at the fast Paul Ricard circuit showed a top speed of .

In addition to the naturally aspirated Carrera RSR introduced in 1974, Porsche offered a customer racing version of the 911 Turbo prepared for the more standard Group 4 rules, the Porsche 934. Some customer teams modified their 934s to Group 5 rules with body kits supplied by Porsche, these were often designated 934/5. Cologne-based Kremer Racing entered a 935 K1 built on a factory shell which in the first race, the six-hour Mugello, finished second behind the Martini Racing sponsored factory entry of Mass and Ickx. Porsches occupied the first seven places ahead of a BMW in eighth, which according to the points scheme meant that Porsche had now twenty points, and BMW three. The factory 935 also scored the pole, fastest lap and win at the six-hour Vallelunga, where a BMW was second and the best 934 finished fifth.

After the second race, the CSI rule makers insisted that the &quot;whale tail&quot; hood of the road-going 930 must fit on the race car. The air-to-air intercooler setup under the rear hood had to be altered to a more compact air-to-water layout, which cost Porsche several weeks of testing and half a million Deutsche marks.

The hastily modified 935 again won the pole and fastest lap at the six-hour Silverstone, but due to a clutch problem at the start, the Martini car could finish only tenth, with the second-placed Kremer 935 collecting valuable points for Zuffenhausen. A private BMW 3.5 CSL had beaten it to the finish by a second. Even more worrisome to Porsche was the fact that BMW Motorsport had also entered a turbo, a 3.2 CSL driven by Ronnie Peterson and Gunnar Nilsson. That new BMW had qualified only one second behind the factory 935, but two seconds ahead of the third placed Kremer 935. The powerful BMW did not last long in the race, however, due to gearbox problems.

Initially, Porsche ran the 935 with the 911&#x27;s original fender-mounted headlights, in two different guises: a sprint version with a wider version of its wheel arches, and a high speed version with modified aerodynamics. The sprint setup was rarely used. However, after carefully studying the rulebooks, Porsche engineers, namely Norbert Singer, discovered a loophole regarding the modifications of fenders that gave them the liberty to remove the headlights to reduce drag and create more downforce, to which the venting slits contribute. This &quot;flat nose&quot; (also known as the &quot;slant nose&quot;) with headlights in the front spoiler, became the distinguishing feature of the 935 and was later offered on the roadgoing 930 as the &quot;flachbau&quot;, or &quot;flatnose&quot;, part of Porsche&#x27;s &quot;sonderwunsch&quot;, or &quot;special wish&quot; program. Also, the 935 now had extended &quot;long tail&quot; rear fenders, similar to the low drag setup seen years earlier on the Carrera RS. These fenders also offered more space for engine periphery and efficient cooling.

The 1,000 km Nürburgring, usually consisting of 44 laps, was run in 1976 as a 47 lap 1,073 km race, putting even more strain on the new Group 5 machinery. With Mass and Ickx being at the 1976 Monaco Grand Prix, Rolf Stommelen and Manfred Schurti stepped in to drive the 935 which by now had the new look it became famous for. With the help of higher turbo boost, Stommelen qualified the 935 on the pole with a stunning 7:37.5 (see List of Nordschleife lap times (racing)), while the BMW turbo did not take part. The fastest of only nine race laps was just over eight minutes, though, as the engine was not sorted out, and vibrations caused ignition failure. Again, a reliable Schnitzer Motorsport-entered naturally aspirated BMW CSL took the win, with the customer 934 of Loos salvaging valuable second place points for Porsche.

The 1976 24 Hours of Le Mans counted towards neither world championship, but Le Mans was often considered the real championship. For that race, it was possible to use the 935&#x27;s well-tested original engine setup. The main battle was between the sportscars, with a Renault Alpine setting the pole. The 935 driven by Stommelen and Schurti qualified third and, despite the weight and drag of a Group 5 silhouette, finished fourth overall, with one of the Porsche 936s taking the win.

At Zeltweg, Ickx was back, setting the pole, but the throttle link broke before mid-race. Derek Bell set the fastest lap in the Kremer 935, but nonetheless two BMW coupés won ahead of a private 934. Porsche still had a narrow lead in the points standings, but only the best five of the seven events would count. BMW had now three wins compared to Porsche&#x27;s two, which meant that Porsche had to win the final two races. The new engine setup was tested at Weissach in a modified 934 while the race cars were shipped overseas. At Watkins Glen, the regular race chassis 002 of Mass and Ickx needed modification to the brakes derived from the brakes of the 917, and the test chassis 001 of Stommelen and Schurti won, with the best BMW being fourth. Porsche now had three wins and two seconds equaling ninety points, which meant that only another win could add five more points to their tally. BMW had also three wins, but only one second and a fourth, equaling 85 points. Without a competitive third brand, the winner of the final round would take the world championship.

In Dijon, the turbo of BMW Motorsport was back, now with the 3.5 L CSL, and this time the fast Swedes Peterson and Nilsson put it on the pole, half a second ahead of Ickx. Again the transmission was not as strong as the Bavarian Motor Works 750 hp engine, failing before the first of the six hours had passed. Three 935s plus two Group 5 spec 934/5s won ahead of the best normally aspirated BMW. The 935 and 936 had each won its championship, and Le Mans, too. The age of turbocharged engines had begun in endurance racing.

== 935/77 ==
=== 935/77A customer ===
Based on the 1976 version, thirteen Porsche 935/77A were sold to privateer teams in Australia, Italy, France, the US and Germany. Among others, Cologne-based rivals Georg Loos and Kremer Racing entered 935s in the 1977 Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft which introduced the Group 5 rules. As the naturally aspirated BMW Coupés and Ford Capri had pulled out of the Div. I (over 2.0 litre) of the DRM, these Porsches had no serious competition in the big division until other turbo-charged cars like the BMW-powered Schnitzer, Toyota Celica and the Zakspeed Ford Capri debuted.

The DRM was a drivers&#x27; championship, and with equal Porsche customer cars, no other competitor could dominate, which meant that despite the customer 934 of 1976 and the 935 since 1977 dominating their division, the championship was often decided in favour of a small division pilot. Kremer went on to develop yet another special 935, the K2, and also ran the optional 3.0L engine offered by Porsche, which was connected with sixty kg more minimum weight.

Porsche also sold slightly modified customer cars in 1978 and 1979.

=== 935/77 works ===
After having won both world championships in 1976, Porsche focused on Le Mans. Due to a lack of competition in 1976, Porsche decided not to defend its sportscar championship with the 936 in 1977, leaving it to the Alfa Romeo Tipo 33. The series would be demoted to a European series in 1978 before being discontinued.

In the 1977 World Championship for Makes season, the factory continued to develop and race one or two new 935, in case BMW or another brand would bring a competitive turbocharged car. Customers of the 935/77A were not happy that the factory would race them with a newer car, but as the 935/77 was often unreliable, it won only four of the nine WCM events, which did not include Le Mans.

In the WCM season opening 24 hour Daytona, the old car was entered, but tyre failures caused a DNF, with an older RSR 3.0 taking the win in front of two customer 935&#x27;s. The new car body was changed significantly to lower drag, resulting in a 10 km/h higher top speed at Paul Ricard, where it covered 3,500 km in tests at speed, lapping three to four seconds faster. The front fenders, which in 1976 had followed the hood, now protruded above the hood line, and also accommodated mirrors. The rear fenders were altered, but the biggest change was the addition of a second rear window above the standard one. This allowed cleaner air flow to the rear wing under which the single turbo was later replaced by two KKK units. This improved throttle response and also power, but several head gasket failures meant that Porsche had some homework to do for the1978 season of the World Champion chip of Makes(WCM).

The works 935/77 qualified sixth at the 1977 24 Hours of Le Mans, behind the Renault Alpines and the 936s, but engine troubles ended their race early. As in 1976, a 936 won after the turbo powered sportscars chased each other into troubles. This time, a customer 935 finished third overall.

=== 935/77 2.0 ===
The 935/77 body style was used also for winning one race in the small 2.0 litre Div. II of the DRM (predecessor to the DTM), to prove that Porsche could also compete in that class. In Div. I, the customer 935s raced each other, and German TV announced that at the Norisring, it would thus cover only the Div. II race. Porsche engineers were sent to the drawing boards to reduce the capacity of the air-cooled flat-six to 1,425 cc. The power output of the engine was . The weight could be lowered to according to rules in this class. To achieve this, large parts of the chassis were replaced by a tubular aluminium space frame.

At the time, Zakspeed-Ford and Schnitzer-BMW were in transition from the naturally aspirated 2.0 L 4-cylinder engine rated at about to 1.4 litre turbocharged engines rated at an excess of . These engines would later move on to Formula One, with the BMW powerplant winning the 1983 F1 Championship, and becoming the strongest F1 engine ever, producing up to in qualifying trim.

In the first outing at Norisring in early July 1977, both the new car with Jacky Ickx behind the wheel had problems due to overheating. Skipping the Diepholz airfield round, Porsche sorted the car out for the DRM support race of the 1977 German Grand Prix at the fast Hockenheimring (long version). In changing weather conditions, Jacky Ickx set pole by almost three seconds and won with 50 seconds, setting fastest lap in the process. With its mission accomplished, the Porsche 935/77 2.0 (chassis 935/2-001) was retired to the Porsche Museum.

=== 935 L1 ===
Following the factory effort of the 935/77, Porsche privateer Jan Lundgardh wanted to enter the 935/77 in the Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft and World Sportscar Championship, but Porsche was reluctant to provide him with a factory 935/77 chassis. Lundgardh with the help of Porsche engineer Eberhard Braun managed to procure an original engine from the 935/77 project which produced . Unlike the factory 935/77 which had a center monocoque with front and rear tubular frames, Lundgardh constructed an entire spaceframe chassis, which was more akin to the setup found on the 935/78 &quot;Moby Dick&quot;. The windshield was borrowed from a 911 Turbo, and retained much of the body of a factory 935, however towards the end of its debut season in 1980, it was eventually fitted with bodywork from the K3 developed by Kremer. For the 1981 season, the L1 was driven in the World Sportscar Championship by Lundgardh alongside Mike Wilds. Since the L1 was competing in the under-2.0 liter class, at scrutineering for the 24 Hours of Le Mans it weighed , and marked the first time a &quot;Baby&quot; 935 had competed at Le Mans. Reliability problems plagued the car throughout its earlier seasons, Le Mans proving no exception as the L1 retired in the 5th hour with engine failure. Eventually the original engine was replaced by a 930/76 flat-six, and Lundgardh continued to campaign the car in the GTX class of the World Sportscar Championship, finishing an all-time high of 1st in class at its penultimate outing, the 1984 1000 km of Nürburgring.

== 935/78 &quot;Moby Dick&quot; ==
For 1978, a third and final version of the 935 was developed, the 935/78, intended only for Le Mans. Due to the head gasket failures of the 1977 version, Porsche parted with their air cooling tradition and introduced water-cooled cylinder heads in the 1978 engine, and equipped them with four valves as well. The capacity was enlarged to 3.2 L, increasing its output to . The weight, which was less important on the Le Mans straights, had to be 1,030 kg now. As this track, like most, was run clockwise, the driver seat was moved over to the right side for better weight distribution and sight in right-hand corners, like Dunlop, Tertre Rouge and Mulsanne, another distinctive feature of the 1978 model.

The new car again took full advantage of a new loophole in the Group 5 rules, of which BMW took advantage of and cut the floor pan of their car to mount the exhaust system at the front of the engine. Keeping this fact in view, the whole floor pan of the 935 was cut away, and the body was lowered by . The gearbox was mounted upside down to reduce the angle of the drive shafts. As the rules did not limit the forward extension of the rear aerodynamic devices, Porsche even added fairings to the doors, bridging the gap between the front and rear fenders. These were shortened later, covering only the front third of the doors. Because of its white color and long tail shape optimised for low drag, the 935/78 was often nicknamed &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;.

With this version, the pair of Mass/Ickx won the test race, the 6 hours of Silverstone Circuit, the pole (1:22,38) and fastest lap (1:23,98 or 202,519 km/h), being only 4 seconds slower than the corresponding times of James Hunt in the 1977 British Grand Prix, which covered only a quarter of the distance.

At the 1978 24 Hours of Le Mans, the 935 qualified third, barely beaten by a Renault Alpine and a 936. Compared to 1976, lap times were 15 seconds quicker now. With the new 3.2 L engine, it was the fastest car on the straight in Le Mans, recording a top speed of , passing the prototypes of Renault Alpine, as well as the teammate 936, as these Group 6 cars had 2.1 L engines with just over , equal to normal 3.0 L engines. The engine had to be replaced before the race, though, and with ensuing problems early in the race, the Moby Dick was no contender, finishing 8th behind three customer 935. In its third attempt, Renault finally managed to beat Porsche, and then went on to focus on F1. Two of the three 936 and another Alpine occupied the other three places. Before being retired to the museum, the Moby Dick was also entered at Vallelunga and at the Norisring, the annual highlight of the DRM series, but the twisty track around the Nuremberg Reichsparteitag grand stand proved to be quite difficult for the Moby Dick, and it failed to finish.

Awaiting rule changes taking effect in 1982, Porsche did not officially enter in 1979 or 1980, granting only some limited support to customer efforts with the 935, 936 and even decade-old 908 and 917, mainly in form of spare parts, engines and know-how, which by then was rather dated. Factory racing was mainly done with the 924 turbo variants called the Carrera GT, with limited success.

Private non-factory-built replica cars of the 1977 body style and the &quot;Moby Dick&quot; were entered in DRM and IMSA in following years by Joest Racing, Moretti racing and John Fitzpatrick Racing.

== Kremer 935 K2, K3 and K4 ==

As Porsche hesitated to sell their Evolution models, some teams developed their own ideas, especially Kremer Racing from Cologne, Germany. Parallel to the factory in 1976, they had built a 935 K1, and in 1977, modified their customer 935 to the K2. For 1979, they introduced the 935 K3 (for &quot;Kremer Type 3&quot;; the derivative of the successful K2). Driven mainly by Klaus Ludwig, it won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979, beating all prototypes, in heavy rain, which is usually considered a disadvantage for race cars with windshields. Coming in second was a factory spec model, driven by Rolf Stommelen, and supported by team owner Dick Barbour and actor Paul Newman.

A total of 13 complete K3 cars were built by Kremer Racing. Kits were also made available to allow other 935s to be updated to K3 specification.

Facing strong competition in the 1980 DRM by the Zakspeed Ford Capri, the K4 was introduced in mid 1981 for customers at a cost of 400,000 Deutsche Mark. The K4 used a Porsche supplied 3.1 L twin-turbocharged Flat six engine with a varying power output of at 1.5 bar boost costing 91,000 DM.

A 935 K2 was converted to street legal specification and featured identical to the 935/78 &quot;Moby Dick&quot;. The 1986 K2 which was 1 of only 12 imported into the U.S. at the time is currently owned by Peter Lima of Real Muscle car of Miami. Originally purchased by the owner of Golds Gym in 1986 from Auto Saloon 2000 in Miami for nearly US$200,000. The unrestored 190 mph+ Porsche has been untouched since 88&#x27; when he was indicted for the distribution of illegal drugs. The specific Kremer K2 was auctioned off at Mecum Monterey Auction 2015 for an unknown amount.
== Success and legacy ==
Through 1984 the 935 won over 150 races worldwide, including more than 20 class wins. It scored an overall win in the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans making it one of only 2 cars since 1953 to win at Le Mans overall yet not be in the top prototype class. It also won the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 12 Hours of Sebring six times each. It was also undefeated in the German DRM between 1977 and 1979, posted victories in the IMSA GTX class, and won many races on the famous Nürburgring Nordschleife, including three 1000km Nürburgring. The 935 also took Porsche to victory in the FIA World Championship for Makes each year from 1976 to 1979. In 1980 and 1981, Lancia won the title with their Beta Montecarlo 1.4t, by regularly winning the sub 2.0 L category, and occasionally defeating Porsche in the big category.

In 1982 Alan Jones, the Formula One World Champion, drove a 935 to victory in the 1982 Australian GT Championship. Jones was unbeaten for the whole season. The 1983 Australian GT Championship was won by the same 935 which Jones drove to the 1982 title, this time in the hands of touring car driver Rusty French. As a reward for his win in the 1983 championship, French was given a drive with Kremer Racing at the 1984 24 Hours of Le Mans where he finished 9th outright with Tiff Needell and David Sutherland in a 956. At the end of the year in the Sports Car/GT Challenge support races for the 1983 Australian Grand Prix, Jones, driving a 935 K4 imported to Australia from America by John Fitzpatrick racing especially for the meeting, easily won both 15 lap races. Italian driver Gianpiero Moretti, founder of Momo Wheels, finished 4th in each race driving the Moby Dick version of the 935.

The Moby Dick engine was the basis for an all-watercooled 2.65 L engine intended for the Indy 500, but rule makers there, remembering the dominance of the Porsche 917/10 turbo and 935, limited its boost so it would not be competitive against domestic machinery. Instead, the engine was used in the 1981 Le Mans winning 936/81, and in the 956 and 962C which would dominate the mid-1980s. Starting in 1999, this engine block forms the basis of the successful motorsport GT, and Turbo models before being phased out completely in the 991 generation 911.

After Group 5 was discontinued by FIA after 1982, the 935 continued to race in IMSA&#x27;s GTP category, usually entered by smaller privateer names, who were not permitted by IMSA regulations to race the new Group C 956 because of the footbox location relative to the front axle (footbox was ahead, in violation of the IMSA rule where it must be behind the front axle). Due to this, the 962 was introduced to the US market in 1984, fitted with the 935 air-cooled single-turbo engine. With the appearance of GTP cars in 1981, the 935 was still competitive through 1983. Later in 1984 the 962 appeared and wrote another history. By 1985 the days of the 935 were mostly over, as it could hardly be modified to a groundeffect design even with a tube frame chassis, with the rear-mounted flat 6 prohibiting a diffuser, an issue which also affects modern 911 race cars. Only a handful of 935&#x27;s remained, and the car was no longer competitive with the already developed GTP cars. The last major victory for the 935 was in the 1984 12 Hours of Sebring in the IMSA GTP class against purpose built prototypes. The 935 was seen in two races in the 1986 season. The 935 can still be seen on the track throughout North America and Europe in historic racing and hill climbs.

The four-wheel-drive 959, and its racing counterpart 961, can be considered high-tech successors to the 935, but Group B never got a circuit racing series, and was only used in rallying before being banned there due to a fatal accident. The 1980s had few racing opportunities for turbocharged 911 cars, which often were fitted with 935-style bodywork. Being run by amateurs at the Nürburgring in VLN endurance and in the 24 hours race, they were often banned, or at least slowed down by rules.

The 1990s 911 GT2 based on the 993 is also considered a successor to the 935, but BPR series and FIA GT rules required a higher weight, and intake restrictors limited power to , less than the first 935/76. The 911 GT1 with its mid-engine and lowered roof has a different concept, though. Starting in 2003, the turbo-charged Porsche 996 of Alzen set new records at the Nürburgring VLN endurance series (see List of Nordschleife lap times (racing)), with speeds reminding of the 935 era, despite it being also slowed down by minimum weight (1,350 kg) and limited boost.

The Porsche 935 is still raced in championships alongside more modern cars, such as the GT Cup Championship, in which Richard Chamberlain pilots a replica 935 for CTR Developments in the GTO class, which utilises a Porsche 962 engine on a 911E chassis.

== 935 (second generation - 2019) ==
The second generation of the 935 based on the 991 GT2 RS, with bodywork resembling the 935/78, as a tribute to the 935/78. The LED taillights are shared with the 919 Hybrid LMP1 racer, side mirrors from the 911 RSR and titanium tailpipes hearkening back to the 1968 908/01.

The car has a gearshift lever with laminated wood design, a carbon fibre steering wheel and the colour display from the 2019 911 GT3 R, a safety cage, a racing bucket seat with a six-point safety harness, optional second seat for the passenger, air conditioning, 6-piston aluminium monobloc racing front calipers with disc brakes, 4-piston rear calipers with disc brakes, Porsche Stability Management (PSM) with traction control as well as an anti-lock braking system. It is powered by the same engine as used in the GT2 RS mated to a seven-speed PDK transmission. Production is limited to 77 units and deliveries are set to begin in June 2019.

The vehicle was unveiled in 2018 at the 6th Rennsport Reunion in Laguna Seca. The 935 also raced in the Goodwood Festival of Speed 2019.

<doc id="907512" wikidata="Q7383090" url="?curid=907512" title="Ruth Lowe">
<text>Ruth Lowe (August 12, 1914 – January 4, 1981) was a Canadian pianist and songwriter. She composed the first &quot;Billboard&quot; top 80 song &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Smile Again&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Toronto but raised in Glendale, California, Lowe returned to her birth country of Canada as a young woman and began working as a pianist. In 1936, Lowe was working in the &#x27;Song Shop&#x27; in Toronto when Ina Ray Hutton brought her all-female band (the Melodears) to town. Her piano player had taken ill, and Hutton was frantically trying to locate a good-looking blonde lady replacement. Lowe auditioned, and became the regular pianist in Ina Ray&#x27;s band. At age 23 in 1938, Lowe married Harold Cohen, a Chicago music publicist. It was a happy marriage that only lasted one year until Cohen&#x27;s death during an operation in 1939. In her deep grief, Lowe returned to live in Toronto. In her apartment, she composed &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Smile Again&quot;.

==Songwriter==
The song &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Smile Again&quot; was first heard on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s (CBC) radio program &quot;Music By Faith&quot;, in an arrangement by Canadian musician Percy Faith, who would soon go on to fame in the US and the world. Approximately a year later, Lowe passed a copy of the tune to a guitarist in the Tommy Dorsey band, Carmen Mastren, hoping to have Dorsey hear the tune. Dorsey initially passed on the song, giving it to Glenn Miller, but then had it arranged for his young singer, Frank Sinatra, and the Pied Pipers. It was an early, major hit song for Sinatra. Lowe wrote the lyrics for another Frank Sinatra hit, &quot;Put Your Dreams Away (For Another Day)&quot;. She and her son Tom Sandler wrote the song &quot;Take Your Sins to the River&quot; for The Travellers.

==Personal life and legacy==
In 1945, Lowe married Nathan Sandler and the union produced two sons, Tommy and Stephen.

Lowe died of cancer in 1981. &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Smile Again&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1982.

In 2020, &quot;Until I Smile at You: How One Girl’s Heartbreak Electrified Frank Sinatra’s Fame!&quot;, a biography written by Peter Jennings with Tom Sandler, Lowe’s son, was published by Castle Carrington Publishing.

In 2021, &quot;Ruth&#x27;s Wonderful Song&quot;, a children&#x27;s book biography by Jennings, was published by Tellwell Talent.

in 2022, Canadian writer and filmmaker Jamila Pomeroy optioned and began development of a screen adaptation of Until I Smile at You.

<doc id="907513" wikidata="Q7083802" url="?curid=907513" title="Old Crow">
<text>Old Crow is a low-priced brand of Kentucky-made straight bourbon whiskey distilled by Suntory Global Spirits, which also produces Jim Beam and several other brands of whiskey. The current Old Crow product uses the same mash bill and yeast as Jim Beam, but is aged for a shorter period of time.

The Old Crow brand has a venerable history as one of Kentucky&#x27;s earliest bourbons. Old Crow is aged in barrels for a minimum of three years, and in the United States is 80 proof while Old Crow Reserve is aged for a minimum of four years and is 86 proof.

==History==
James C. Crow, a Scottish immigrant, started distilling what would become Old Crow in Frankfort, Kentucky, in the 1830s. Reportedly a very skilled distiller, he made whiskey for various employers, which was sold as &quot;Crow&quot; or, as it aged, &quot;Old Crow&quot; – and the brand acquired its reputation from the latter. Crow died in 1856. W.A. Gaines and Company acquired the name and continued to distill whiskey according to his methods, hiring Crow&#x27;s assistant William F. Mitchell to be the chief distiller. The substantial remaining stock of original Old Crow acquired near-legendary status. After the Civil War the Old Crow logo was changed from a picture of James Crow to the current crow perched atop grains of barley. In 1875, offering drinks from the last available cask reportedly secured the election of Joseph Clay Stiles Blackburn of Kentucky to his first Congressional term. A dispute over ownership of the name &quot;Old Crow&quot; was decided in 1915 in favor of the Gaines company.

Although the whiskey had been at one time the top selling bourbon in the United States, it underwent a swift decline in the second half of the twentieth century. A production error in the amount of &quot;setback&quot; (the portion of spent mash added to a new batch in the sour mash process) negatively impacted the taste of the whiskey, and the distiller&#x27;s inability or unwillingness to correct it led to many customers switching to other brands. Parent company National Distillers was sold to Jim Beam in 1987. The Old Crow recipe and distillery were abandoned and the product became a three-year-old bourbon based on the Jim Beam mashbill. In 2013 Glenns Creek Distillery started operations in part of the former Old Crow Distillery.

==Old Crow Chessmen==
National Distillers brought out the Old Crow Chessmen ceramic decanters in 1969 as an attractive packaging for its 10-year-old 86-proof bourbon. They stand 12–15.5 inches tall, hold a fifth (about 750 ml) of liquor, and the opposing sides were glazed in golden ochre versus a dark green. A deep-pile carpet chessboard measured 45x45 inches. The decanters sold originally for some US$14. A full set would consist of 32 decanters, 16 of which were pawns. The production was limited to some 2,000 pieces, intended for only one Christmas season, and the moulds reputedly were destroyed. Today the bourbon contents of these decanters are highly prized. 

==Famous drinkers==
Many American politicians and military leaders have been associated with Old Crow. 

Confederate General Jubal Early was a fan of Old Crow. 

Another famous politician who preferred Old Crow was Henry Clay, of Kentucky, who was even featured in Old Crow advertisements.

World War II &quot;triple ace&quot; Bud Anderson named his P-51 Mustang &quot;Old Crow&quot;, after the whiskey.

Senator Mitch McConnell from Kentucky has stated that Old Crow as his favorite bourbon.

Lore suggests that American general and later 18th President of the United States, Ulysses S. Grant was a fan of Old Crow. This is mentioned in connection to a story written in the New York Herald where war managers went to President Abraham Lincoln and demanded General Grant&#x27;s removal since he was &quot;nothing but a common drunkard.&quot; In reply, Lincoln asked &quot;can you tell me where he gets his whiskey?&quot; They replied they could not and asked him why he wanted to know. &quot;Because if you can only find out, I will send a barrel of this wonderful whiskey to every general in the army.&quot; However, Old Crow is never mentioned in the news story and the entire concept was put into question when a telegraph operator named Major Thomas Eckert related a story about Lincoln&#x27;s denial of the quote. 

==In popular culture==
Old Crow is said to have been the favorite bourbon of American writers Mark Twain and William Faulkner. Journalist Hunter S. Thompson liked it. Twain reportedly visited the distillery in the 1880s, and Old Crow advertised this heavily; John C. Gerber sees in this commercial exploitation a sign of Twain&#x27;s continuing popularity. As for Thompson, the frequent occurrences of the drink in his writing, semi-autobiographical as well as fictional, have led to similar associations. The manufacturer actively pursued such publicity: in 1955, they took out an ad in &quot;College English&quot;, the journal of the National Council of Teachers of English, offering $250 for every authenticated reference to their product one could find in past literature or history.

In the 1955 film &quot;I Died a Thousand Times&quot;, the dying mob boss, Big Mac (Lon Chaney, Jr.), drinks Old Crow in violation of doctor&#x27;s orders.

The 1952 film &quot;Springfield Rifle&quot;, disgraced Major Kearney (Gary Cooper) orders Old Crow in a saloon 

Throughout &quot;Up a Road Slowly&quot;, Irene Hunt&#x27;s 1966 Newbery Award–winning novel, Uncle Haskell drinks copious quantities of Old Crow, taking the empty bottles in a golf bag to bury them at a creek. He claims the Old Crow is rare French wine, so the children begin referring to it as &quot;Le Vieux Corbeau&quot;.

In recent books in the Spenser series, originated by the late Robert B. Parker and continued by Ace Atkins, the title character regularly refers to drinking Old Crow.

Dirty Bird Blues by Clarence Major the main character, Bluesman Manfred Banks favorite drink is Old Crow.

In the History Channel 3-part mini-series &quot;Grant&quot;, the general is seen with a bottle of Old Crow.

In Joseph Hansen&#x27;s series of detective novels, his protagonist Dave Brandstetter drinks Old Crow.

Principal McVicker from the TV series Beavis and Butthead is seen drinking a bottle of Old Crow in the episode &quot;No Laughing&quot;. Famous YouTuber Gothic king cobra (JFS) is also a fan of the cheap whisky .

<text>The Porsche 934 is a racing version of the Porsche 911 Turbo, prepared to FIA Group 4 rules, similar to the Porsche 935 which was prepared to FIA Group 5 rules.

==History==

The Porsche 934 was introduced for the 1976 racing season. It was manufactured for two years, 1976 and 1977, with 31 of them, total, being built. Toine Hezemans drove this car to victory at the European GT Championship, while in the U.S., with George Follmer at the wheel, it also became the Trans-Am champion. It continued to win races throughout the late 1970s.

The 934 was essential in building the Porsche 934/5, a combination of the 934 chassis and engine with the 935 wheels, tyres and rear wing configuration. 

The 934 as well as the 935 were raced in the Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft in a distinctive orange &quot;Jägermeister&quot; livery.

Alan Hamilton the Australian Porsche distributor at the time owned one of these cars and competed and won the 1977 Australian Sports Car Championship, and in 1980 the same car won the title with Allan Moffat behind the wheel.

==Details==

The 934 has a top speed approaching 190 mph (approximately 300 km/h) and has a zero to time of 3.9 seconds. It was one of the last designs to incorporate all the distinctive stylings of the original 911s, with only minor bodywork taken from the 911 Turbo, to include GRP (glass-reinforced plastic) wheelarch extensions, doors, engine lid and boot.

The car came in a regular trim, or a racing trim (also called &quot;Group 4 trim&quot;).
Regular trim:
* Electric windows and door trim
* 120 liter fuel tank, or 31.7 US gallons.
*3-litre, flat-six engine (in 1977, modifications took it to 550 bhp)
The racing trim was a modified regular trim to meet with the FIA rules, most notably it added of weight, so that it complied with the minimum weight requirement of Group 4.

<text>Albert Cushing Read, Sr. (March 29, 1887 – October 10, 1967) was an aviator and rear admiral in the United States Navy. He and his crew made the first transatlantic flight in the &quot;NC-4&quot;, a Curtiss NC flying boat.

==Early life and Atlantic crossing==
Read was born in Lyme, New Hampshire on March 29, 1887 into a Boston Brahmin family. He attended the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, graduating in the class of 1907. His Academy classmates included Patrick N. L. Bellinger, Willis W. Bradley, George M. Courts, Henry K. Hewitt, Jonas H. Ingram, Claud A. Jones, and Raymond Spruance. In 1915, he was designated naval aviator number 24.

As a Lieutenant Commander in May 1919, Read commanded a crew of five on the &quot;NC-4&quot; Curtiss flying boat, the first aircraft ever to make a transatlantic flight, a couple of weeks before Alcock and Brown&#x27;s non-stop flight, and eight years before Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s solo, non-stop flight. Read&#x27;s flight started from Rockaway Beach, Long Island, took 23 days before arriving in Plymouth, England. The six stops included layovers at Trepassey Bay, Newfoundland, the Azores, and Lisbon, Portugal.

Later in 1919, upon returning to the U.S., Read predicted: &quot;It soon will be possible to drive an airplane around the world at a height of 60,000 feet and 1,000 miles per hour.&quot; The next day, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ran an editorial in reaction, stating: &quot;It is one thing to be a qualified aviator, and quite another to be a qualified prophet. Nothing now known supports the Lieutenant Commander’s forecast. An airplane at the height of 60,000 feet would be whirling its propellers in a vacuum, and no aviator could live long in the freezing cold of interstellar space.&quot;

On June 3, 1919, he was made a commander of the Order of the Tower and Sword by the Portuguese government. After returning to the United States, Read was awarded the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, which at the time was a more prestigious award than the Navy Cross that the other five NC-4 crew members received (the order of award precedence was switched in 1942). In 1929, Read and the rest of the flight crew of NC-4 were awarded Congressional Gold Medals.

==Later life==
On June 24, 1924, Commander Read assumed command of both and the aircraft squadrons of the Asiatic Fleet. He served in this position until &quot;Ajax&quot; was relieved by in June 1925 and subsequently decommissioned in July 1925. From Oct. 1926 to May 1929 Capt. Read resided at the Historic &quot;Connecticut House&quot; on Norfolk Naval Base.

Read trained naval aviators through World War II. He was nicknamed &quot;Putty Read&quot; because his face rarely showed any emotion.

On June 4, 1962, he appeared on the TV game show &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;.

He died in retirement in Coconut Grove, Florida, on October 10, 1967. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery with his wife Bess Burdine Read (1896–1992).

Read was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1965.

<text>James Shepherd Freeman (1900 – 1962) was a World War II admiral in the United States Navy and the son of the Alabama millionaire James Stanley Freeman.

==Early life==
Freeman was born on April 30, 1900, in Jasper, Alabama. He entered the United States Naval Academy on July 20, 1917 and graduated 58th in his class in 1921 before entering a career in the Navy.

==Career==
His assignments before World War II included as chief executive officer of the US Naval Base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii.

While commander of the USS &quot;Alchiba&quot;, he was assigned to bring supplies and ammunition to marines stationed in Guadalcanal. On November 28, 1942, his ship was torpedoed by two Japanese midget submarines. Freeman ordered the &quot;Alchiba&quot;&#x27;s engines turned to full throttle and ran the ship ashore, saving the lives of the crew and ensuring that the much-needed ammunition was not lost. Freeman received the Navy Cross for his actions.

The admiral is also featured in the self-described &quot;UFO disclosure&quot; documentary &quot;Fastwalkers: They Are Here&quot; as the commander of a naval ship whose crew reported sightings of extraterrestrial activity at sea. In the film, Freeman is reported to have had photographs of UFOs that were supposed to be shown to other naval officers. It is unclear whether such photos existed or were ever made public.

==Personal life==
He was married to Dorothea Steinmann Freeman. He is often referred to as &quot;James Freeman, Sr.&quot; to distinguish him from his son, also named Jim.

His son James Shepherd Freeman, Jr., was born 1926 in San Diego, California and spent his childhood in Hawaii while his father was commanding at Pearl Harbor. He, too, entered the Naval Academy, but was later released on a medical discharge. He graduated in 1948 from Auburn University in Alabama and, in the same year, married Betty Jeane Pierce, daughter of the newspaper publisher Edgar H. Pierce. They had five children and ten grandchildren. Freeman Jr. died in 1997 in Jasper.

==Death==
Freeman Snr. died on August 7, 1962, at the Bethesda Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. His wife survived him.

<doc id="907524" wikidata="Q2895315" url="?curid=907524" title="Von Neumann regular ring">
<text>In mathematics, a von Neumann regular ring is a ring &quot;R&quot; (associative, with 1, not necessarily commutative) such that for every element &quot;a&quot; in &quot;R&quot; there exists an &quot;x&quot; in &quot;R&quot; with . One may think of &quot;x&quot; as a &quot;weak inverse&quot; of the element &quot;a&quot;; in general &quot;x&quot; is not uniquely determined by &quot;a&quot;. Von Neumann regular rings are also called absolutely flat rings, because these rings are characterized by the fact that every left &quot;R&quot;-module is flat.

Von Neumann regular rings were introduced by under the name of &quot;regular rings&quot;, in the course of his study of von Neumann algebras and continuous geometry. Von Neumann regular rings should not be confused with the unrelated regular rings and regular local rings of commutative algebra.

An element &quot;a&quot; of a ring is called a von Neumann regular element if there exists an &quot;x&quot; such that . An ideal formula_1 is called a (von Neumann) regular ideal if for every element &quot;a&quot; in formula_1 there exists an element &quot;x&quot; in formula_1 such that .

== Examples ==
Every field (and every skew field) is von Neumann regular: for we can take . An integral domain is von Neumann regular if and only if it is a field. Every direct product of von Neumann regular rings is again von Neumann regular.

Another important class of examples of von Neumann regular rings are the rings M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;K&quot;) of &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; square matrices with entries from some field &quot;K&quot;. If &quot;r&quot; is the rank of , Gaussian elimination gives invertible matrices &quot;U&quot; and &quot;V&quot; such that
: formula_4
(where &quot;I&quot;&quot;r&quot; is the &quot;r&quot;-by-&quot;r&quot; identity matrix). If we set , then
: formula_5

More generally, the matrix ring over any von Neumann regular ring is again von Neumann regular.

If &quot;V&quot; is a vector space over a field (or skew field) &quot;K&quot;, then the endomorphism ring End&quot;K&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) is von Neumann regular, even if &quot;V&quot; is not finite-dimensional.

Generalizing the above examples, suppose &quot;S&quot; is some ring and &quot;M&quot; is an &quot;S&quot;-module such that every submodule of &quot;M&quot; is a direct summand of &quot;M&quot; (such modules &quot;M&quot; are called &quot;semisimple&quot;). Then the endomorphism ring End&quot;S&quot;(&quot;M&quot;) is von Neumann regular. In particular, every semisimple ring is von Neumann regular. Indeed, the semisimple rings are precisely the Noetherian von Neumann regular rings.

The ring of affiliated operators of a finite von Neumann algebra is von Neumann regular.

A Boolean ring is a ring in which every element satisfies . Every Boolean ring is von Neumann regular.

== Facts ==

The following statements are equivalent for the ring &quot;R&quot;:
* &quot;R&quot; is von Neumann regular
* every principal left ideal is generated by an idempotent element
* every finitely generated left ideal is generated by an idempotent
* every principal left ideal is a direct summand of the left &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;R&quot;
* every finitely generated left ideal is a direct summand of the left &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;R&quot;
* every finitely generated submodule of a projective left &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;P&quot; is a direct summand of &quot;P&quot;
* every left &quot;R&quot;-module is flat: this is also known as &quot;R&quot; being absolutely flat, or &quot;R&quot; having weak dimension 0
* every short exact sequence of left &quot;R&quot;-modules is pure exact.
The corresponding statements for right modules are also equivalent to &quot;R&quot; being von Neumann regular.

Every von Neumann regular ring has Jacobson radical {0} and is thus semiprimitive (also called &quot;Jacobson semi-simple&quot;).

In a commutative von Neumann regular ring, for each element &quot;x&quot; there is a unique element &quot;y&quot; such that and , so there is a canonical way to choose the &quot;weak inverse&quot; of &quot;x&quot;.

The following statements are equivalent for the commutative ring &quot;R&quot;:
* &quot;R&quot; is von Neumann regular.
* &quot;R&quot; has Krull dimension 0 and is reduced.
* Every localization of &quot;R&quot; at a maximal ideal is a field.

== Generalizations and specializations ==
Special types of von Neumann regular rings include &quot;unit regular rings&quot; and &quot;strongly von Neumann regular rings&quot; and rank rings.

A ring &quot;R&quot; is called unit regular if for every &quot;a&quot; in &quot;R&quot;, there is a unit &quot;u&quot; in &quot;R&quot; such that . Every semisimple ring is unit regular, and unit regular rings are directly finite rings. An ordinary von Neumann regular ring need not be directly finite.

A ring &quot;R&quot; is called strongly von Neumann regular if for every &quot;a&quot; in &quot;R&quot;, there is some &quot;x&quot; in &quot;R&quot; with . The condition is left-right symmetric. Strongly von Neumann regular rings are unit regular. Every strongly von Neumann regular ring is a subdirect product of division rings. In some sense, this more closely mimics the properties of commutative von Neumann regular rings, which are subdirect products of fields. For commutative rings, von Neumann regular and strongly von Neumann regular are equivalent. In general, the following are equivalent for a ring &quot;R&quot;:
* &quot;R&quot; is strongly von Neumann regular
* &quot;R&quot; is von Neumann regular and reduced
* &quot;R&quot; is von Neumann regular and every idempotent in &quot;R&quot; is central
* Every principal left ideal of &quot;R&quot; is generated by a central idempotent

Generalizations of von Neumann regular rings include π-regular rings, left/right semihereditary rings, left/right nonsingular rings and semiprimitive rings.

<text>Geghard (, meaning &quot;spear&quot;) is a medieval monastery in the Ararat province of Armenia, being partially carved out of the adjacent mountain, surrounded by cliffs. It is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site with enhanced protection status.

While the main chapel was built in 1215, the monastery complex was founded in the 4th century by Gregory the Illuminator at the site of a sacred spring inside a cave. The monastery had thus been originally named Ayrivank (Այրիվանք), meaning &quot;the Monastery of the Cave&quot;. The name commonly used for the monastery today, Geghard, or more fully Geghardavank (Գեղարդավանք), meaning &quot;the Monastery of the Spear&quot;, originates from the spear which had wounded Jesus at the Crucifixion, allegedly brought to Armenia by Apostle Jude, called here Thaddeus, and stored amongst many other relics. Now it is displayed in the Echmiadzin treasury.

The spectacular towering cliffs surrounding the monastery are part of the Azat River gorge, and are included together with the monastery in the World Heritage Site listing. Some of the churches within the monastery complex are entirely dug out of the cliff rocks, others are little more than caves, while others are elaborate structures, with both architecturally complex walled sections and rooms deep inside the cliff. The combination, together with numerous engraved and free-standing khachkars is a unique sight, being one of the most frequented tourist destinations in Armenia.

Most visitors to Geghard also choose to visit the nearby pagan Temple of Garni, located further down the Azat River. Visiting both sites in one trip is so common that they are often referred to in unison as Garni-Geghard.

==History==
The monastery was founded in the 4th century, according to tradition by Gregory the Illuminator. The site is that of a spring arising in a cave which had been sacred in pre-Christian times, hence one of the names by which it was known, Ayrivank (the Monastery of the Cave). The first monastery was destroyed by Arabs in the 9th century.

Nothing has remained of the structures of Ayrivank. According to Armenian historians of the 4th, 8th and 10th centuries the monastery comprised, apart from religious buildings, well-appointed residential and service installations. Ayrivank suffered greatly in 923 from Nasr, a vice-regent of an Arabian caliph in Armenia, who plundered its valuable property, including unique manuscripts, and burned down the magnificent structures of the monastery. Earthquakes also did it no small damage.

Though there are inscriptions dating to the 1160s, the main church was built in 1215 under the auspices of the brothers Zakare and Ivane, the Zakarid generals of Queen Tamar of Georgia, who took back most of Armenia from the Turks. The gavit, partly free-standing, partly carved in the cliff, dates to before 1225, and a series of chapels hewn into the rock dates from the mid-13th century following the purchase of the monastery by Prince Prosh Khaghbakian, vassal of the Zakarians and founder of the Proshian principality. Over a short period the Proshyans built the cave structures which brought Geghard well-merited fame — the second cave church, the family sepulcher of zhamatun Papak and Ruzukan, a hall for gatherings and studies (collapsed in the middle of the 20th century) and numerous cells. The chamber reached from the North East of the gavit became Prince Prosh Khaghbakian’s tomb in 1283. The adjacent chamber has carved in the rock the arms of the Proshian family, including an eagle with a lamb in its claws. A stairway W of the gavit leads up to a funerary chamber carved out in 1288 for Papak Proshian and his wife Ruzukan. The Proshyan princes provided Geghard with an irrigation system in the 13th century. At this time it was also known as the Monastery of the Seven Churches and the Monastery of the Forty Altars. All around the monastery are caves and khachkars. The monastery was defunct, the main church used to shelter the flocks of the Karapapakh nomads in winter, until resettled by a few monks from Ejmiatsin after the Russian conquest. Restored for tourist purposes but now with a small ecclesiastical presence, the site is still a major place of pilgrimage.

The monastery was famous because of the relics that it housed. The most celebrated of these was the spear which had wounded Christ on the Cross, allegedly brought there by the Apostle Thaddeus, from which comes its present name, Geghard-avank (&quot;the Monastery of the Spear&quot;), first recorded in a document of 1250. This made it a popular place of pilgrimage for Armenian Christians over many centuries. Relics of the Apostles Andrew and John were donated in the 12th century, and pious visitors made numerous grants of land, money, manuscripts, etc., over the succeeding centuries. In one of the cave cells there lived, in the 13th century, Mkhitar Ayrivanetsi, the well-known Armenian historian.

No works of applied art have survived in Geghard, except for the legendary spear (&quot;geghard&quot;). The shaft has a diamond-shaped plate attached to its end; a Greek cross with flared ends is cut through the plate. A special case was made for it in 1687, now kept in the museum of Echmiadzin monastery. The gilded silver case is an ordinary handicraft article of 17th-century Armenia.

==Complex==

Today the monastery complex is located at the end of the paved road, and the walk up from the parking lot is lined with women selling sweet bread, sheets of dried fruit (fruit lavash), sweet sujukh (grape molasses covered strings of walnuts) and various souvenirs. A group of musicians usually plays for a few seconds as visitors approach, perhaps willing to play longer for money.

At the approach to the main entrance on the west there are small caves, chapels, carvings and constructions on the hillside. Right before the entrance are some shallow shelves in the cliff onto which people try to throw pebbles in order to make their wish come true. Just inside the entrance to the compound are the 12th–13th century ramparts protecting three sides of the complex, and the cliffs behind protect the fourth. Walking across the complex will take one to the secondary entrance on the east, outside of which is a table for ritual animal offerings (matagh), and a bridge over the stream.

The one- and two-storey residential and service structures situated on the perimeter of the monastery&#x27;s yard were repeatedly reconstructed, sometimes from their foundations, as happened in the 17th century and in 1968–1971. It is known that most of the monks lived in cells excavated into the rock-face outside the main enceinte, which have been preserved, along with some simple oratories. The rock-faces over the whole area bear elaborate crosses (khatchkar) carved in relief.
More than twenty spaces, varying in shape and size, were carved, at different levels, in solid rock massifs surrounding the main cave structures. Those in the western part of the complex were for service purposes, and the rest are small rectangular chapels with a semicircular apse and an altar. There are twin and triple chapels with one entrance, some of the entrances ornamented with carvings.
There are many often richly ornamented khachkars cut on rock surfaces and on the walls of the structures or put up on the grounds of Geghard in memory of a deceased or in commemoration of someone&#x27;s donation to the monastery.

===The main church (Katoghike, 1215)===

Though there are inscriptions dating to the 1160s, the main church &quot;Kathoghike&quot; was built in 1215 under the auspices of the brothers Zakare and Ivane (of the Zakarid-Mkhargrzeli family), the generals of Queen Tamar of Georgia, who took back most of Armenia from the Turks. 
This is the main church of the complex, and traditional in most respects. This church is built against the mountain, which is not exposed even in the interior. The plan forms an equal-armed cross, inscribed in a square and covered with a dome on a square base. In the corners there are small barrel-vaulted two-storey chapels with steps protruding from the wall. The internal walls have many inscriptions recording donations.

The southern facade of the Katoghike has a portal with fine carvings. The tympanum is decorated with a representation of trees with pomegranates hanging from their branches, and of leaves intertwining with grapes. The pictures of doves are placed between the arch and the outside frame; the doves’ heads are turned to the axis of the portal. Above the portal is carved a lion attacking an ox, symbolizing the prince&#x27;s power.

The arched top of the arcature of the cupola&#x27;s drum has detailed reliefs showing birds, human masks, animals heads, various rosettes and jars.

===The vestry, &quot;gavit&quot; (1215-1225)===

West of the main temple there is a rock-attached vestry, in Armenian &quot;gavit&quot; (Latin &quot;narthex&quot;) built between 1215 and 1225, linked to the main church. Four massive free-standing columns in the centre support a roof of stone with a hole in the centre to admit light. The peripheral spaces resulting from the location of the columns are variously roofed, whilst the central space is crowned by a dome with stalactites, the best example of this technique anywhere in Armenia. This style of &quot;stalactite vault&quot; with a central hole for natural light is thought to have been derived from the &quot;muqarnas&quot; of Islamic architecture, starting from the 11th century in Armenia. They are very similar to the &quot;muqarnas&quot; of the Seljuk Sultan Han caravanserai in Aksaray (dated to 1229). The &quot;gavit&quot; was used for teaching and meetings, and for receiving pilgrims and visitors.

The western portal differs from other portals of those times by van-shaped door bands, decorated with a fine floral pattern. The ornamentation of the tympanum consists of large flowers with petals of various shapes in the interlaced branches and oblong leaves.

===Rock-cut church with spring (c.1240)===

The first cave chamber, Avazan (basin), situated north-west of the vestry, was hewn in the 1240s in an ancient cave with a spring. It was built during the reign of Avag (died in 1250), son of Ivane and nephew of the &quot;Amirspasalar&quot; (Commander in chief) of the Zakarid army, nicknamed &quot;Long Arm&quot; (Zakare II Zakarian). There is an inscription &quot;Remember Archimandrite Galdzag&quot;, recording the construction of the architect for the caves.

It is entirely dug out of the rock and has an equal-armed cruciform plan. The interior is lined by two crossed arches with a central stalactite dome. An inscription records that it was the work of the architect Galdzak, who also constructed the other rock-cut church and the jhamatuns within a period of some forty years. His name is inscribed at the base of the tent decorated with reliefs showing pomegranates.

The main rectangular space of the church is crowned with a tent and complicated with an altar apse and two deep niches, which gave the interior an incomplete cross-cupola shape. Two pairs of intersecting pointed arches, forming the base of the tent, rest on the half-columns of the walls. Just as in the vestry, the inner surface of the tent is hewn in the graceful shape of stalactites which also decorate the capitals of the half-columns and the conch of the altar apse. The decoration of the southern wall is most interesting compositionally. Carved on it are small triple arches with conchs of various shapes, connected at the top and at the bottom by a complicated and finely carved floral ornament.

===The main &quot;zhamatun&quot; (1283)===

After Prosh Khaghbakian acquired the monastery from the Zakarids, he transformed it in the Proshyans’ family monastery and mausoleum. The sepulchre and the second cave church of Astvatsatsin situated east of Avazan, were hewn in 1283, presumably by the same Galdzak, too. These are also accessed through the gavit. The &quot;main zhamatun&quot; is a roughly square chamber cut into the rock, with deeply cut reliefs in the walls. Of interest is a rather primitive high relief on the northern wall, above the archways. In the center, there is a ram&#x27;s head with a chain in its jaws; the chain is wound around the necks of two lions with their heads turned to the onlooker. Instead of the tail tufts there are heads of upward looking dragons — symbolic images gong all the way back to heathen times. Between the lions and below the chain there is an eagle with half-spread wings and a lamb in its claws. This is likely the coat-of-arms of the Proshian Princes.

The reliefs of the eastern wall are no less picturesque. The entrances to a small chapel and to Astvatsatsin church have rectangular platbands connected by two relief crosses. Cut on the portals of the chapel are sirens (fantasy harpy-like birds with women&#x27;s crowned heads) and on the church walls there appear human figures with their elbows bent, wearing long attires and having nimbuses around their heads. These are probably members of the princely family who had these structures built. In its floor there are burial vaults.

===Proshyan chapel (1283)===

The rock-cut tomb gives access to the second rock-cut church, the &quot;Chapel of the Proshians&quot;. This church is known from an inscription to have been built in 1283, the donation of Prince Prosh. It is cruciform in plan. The corners are curved and the drum is lined with semi-columns alternating with blind windows. The dome is decorated, with a circular opening in the centre. The walls have relief decoration depicting animals, warriors, crosses, and floral motifs.

Apart from stalactites in the shape of trefoils and quatrefoils, the decoration of Astvatsatsin church features ornaments of rosettes and various geometrical figures. The front wall of the altar dais is decorated with a pattern of squares and diamonds. A realistic representation of a goat is found at the butt of the altar stair. Men&#x27;s figures are found on a &quot;khachkar&quot; left of the altar apse. The man with a staff in his right hand and in the same attitude as that of the figures on the portal may be Prince Prosh, a founder of the church. Another figure, holding a spear in the left hand, point down, and blowing an uplifted horn, is depicted almost in profile.

===Upper Zhamatun (1288)===

The &quot;Upper Zhamatun&quot;, was the tomb of Papak Proshyan and his wife Ruzukana, as known from an inscription, but their tombstones have disappeared. It was hewn in 1288 on a second level, north of the Proshians’ burial-vault, by way of an external staircase (near the door to the gavit). Also carved into the rock, its form reproduces that of a gavit. It contains the tombs of the princes Merik and Grigor, and others are known to have been there but have now disappeared. An inscription shows it to have been completed in 1288.

On the southern side of the corridor leading to this jhamatun, numerous crosses are cut. The columns hewn in solid rock support rather low semicircular arches fitted into trapeziform frames which, forming a square in the plan, serve as a foundation for the spherical cupola above them with a light opening in its zenith. A hole in the back right corner gives a view of the tomb downstairs.

The acoustics in this chamber are extraordinary.

===Chapel of S. Grigor===
The chapel of S. Gregory the Illuminator (formerly the Chapel of the Mother of God – St Astvatzatzin), built before 1177, stands high above the road, a hundred meters away from the entrance to the monastery. It is partly hewed in massive solid rock; its composition was, in all probability, largely influenced by the shape of the cave which existed there. The chapel, rectangular in plan and having a horseshoe-shaped apse, is adjoined, from the east and from the northeast, by passages and annexes hewed at various levels and even one on top of another.

Traces of plaster with remnants of dark frescoes indicate there were murals inside the chapel. Khachkars with various ornaments are inserted into the exterior walls and hewn on the adjacent rock surfaces.

<text>Digital Signal 1 (DS1, sometimes DS-1) is a T-carrier signaling scheme devised by Bell Labs. DS1 is the primary digital telephone standard used in the United States, Canada and Japan and is able to transmit up to 24 multiplexed voice and data calls over telephone lines. E-carrier is used in place of T-carrier outside the United States, Canada, Japan, and South Korea. DS1 is the logical bit pattern used over a physical T1 line; in practice, the terms &quot;DS1&quot; and &quot;T1&quot; are often used interchangeably.

==Overview==
T1 refers to the primary digital telephone carrier system used in North America. T1 is one line type of the PCM T-carrier hierarchy. T1 describes the cabling, signal type, and signal regeneration requirements of the carrier system.

The signal transmitted on a T1 line, referred to as the DS1 signal, consists of serial bits transmitted at the rate of 1.544 Mbit/s. The type of line code used is called Alternate Mark Inversion (AMI). Digital Signal Designation is the classification of digital bit rates in the digital multiplex hierarchy used in transport of telephone signals from one location to another. DS-1 is a communications protocol for multiplexing the bitstreams of up to 24 telephone calls, along with two special bits: a framing bit (for frame synchronization) and a maintenance-signaling bit, transmitted over a digital circuit called T1. T1&#x27;s maximum data transmission rate is 1.544 megabits per second.

==Bandwidth==
A DS1 telecommunication circuit multiplexes 24 DS0s. The twenty-four DS0s sampled 8,000 times per second (one 8bit PCM sample from each DSO per DS1 frame) consume 1.536 Mbit/s of bandwidth. One framing bit adds 8 kbit/s of overhead, for a total of 1.544 Mbit/s, calculated as follows:

:formula_1

DS1 is a full-duplex circuit, concurrently transmitting and receiving 1.544 Mbit/s.

==DS1 frame synchronization==

Frame synchronization is necessary to identify the timeslots within each 24-channel frame. Synchronization takes place by allocating a framing, or 193rd, bit. This results in 8 kbit/s of framing data, for each DS1. Because this 8-kbit/s channel is used by the transmitting equipment as overhead, only 1.536 Mbit/s is actually passed on to the user. Two types of framing schemes are superframe (SF) and extended superframe (ESF). A superframe consists of twelve consecutive 193-bit frames, whereas an extended superframe consists of twenty-four consecutive 193-bit frames of data. Due to the unique bit sequences exchanged, the framing schemes are not compatible with each other. These two types of framing (SF, and ESF) use their 8 kbit/s framing channel in different ways.

==Connectivity and alarms==

Connectivity refers to the ability of the digital carrier to carry customer data from either end to the other. In some cases, the connectivity may be lost in one direction and maintained in the other. In all cases, the terminal equipment, i.e., the equipment that marks the endpoints of the DS1, defines the connection by the quality of the received framing pattern.

===Alarms===
Alarms are normally produced by the receiving terminal equipment when the framing is compromised. There are three defined alarm indication signal states, identified by a legacy color scheme: red, yellow and blue.

Red alarm indicates the alarming equipment is unable to recover the framing reliably. Corruption or loss of the signal will produce &quot;red alarm&quot;. Connectivity has been lost toward the alarming equipment. There is no knowledge of connectivity toward the far end.

Yellow alarm, also known as remote alarm indication (RAI), indicates reception of a data or framing pattern that reports the far end is in &quot;red alarm&quot;. The alarm is carried differently in SF (D4) and ESF (D5) framing. For SF framed signals, the user bandwidth is manipulated and &quot;bit two in every DS0 channel shall be a zero.&quot; The resulting loss of payload data while transmitting a yellow alarm is undesirable, and was resolved in ESF framed signals by using the data link layer. &quot;A repeating 16-bit pattern consisting of eight &#x27;ones&#x27; followed by eight &#x27;zeros&#x27; shall be transmitted continuously on the ESF data link, but may be interrupted for a period not to exceed 100-ms per interruption.&quot; Both types of alarms are transmitted for the duration of the alarm condition, but for at least one second.

Blue alarm, also known as alarm indication signal (AIS) indicates a disruption in the communication path between the terminal equipment and line repeaters or DCS. If no signal is received by the intermediary equipment, it produces an unframed, all-ones signal. The receiving equipment displays a &quot;red alarm&quot; and sends the signal for &quot;yellow alarm&quot; to the far end because it has no framing, but at intermediary interfaces the equipment will report &quot;AIS&quot; or Alarm Indication Signal. AIS is also called &quot;all ones&quot; because of the data and framing pattern.

These alarm states are also lumped under the term Carrier Group Alarm (CGA). The meaning of CGA is that connectivity on the digital carrier has failed. The result of the CGA condition varies depending on the equipment function. Voice equipment typically coerces the robbed bits for signaling to a state that will result in the far end properly handling the condition, while applying an often different state to the customer equipment connected to the alarmed equipment. Simultaneously, the customer data is often coerced to a 0x7F pattern, signifying a zero-voltage condition on voice equipment. Data equipment usually passes whatever data may be present, if any, leaving it to the customer equipment to deal with the condition.

==Inband T1 versus T1 PRI==
Additionally, for voice T1s there are two main types: so-called &quot;plain&quot; or Inband T1s and PRI (Primary Rate Interface). While both carry voice telephone calls in similar fashion, PRIs are commonly used in call centers and provide not only the 23 actual usable telephone lines (known as &quot;B&quot; channels for &quot;bearer&quot;) but also a 24th line (known as the &quot;D&quot; channel for &quot;data&quot;) that carries line signaling information. This special &quot;D&quot; channel carries: Caller ID (CID) and automatic number identification (ANI) data, required channel type (usually a B, or bearer, channel), call handle, Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS) info, requested channel number and a request for response.

Inband T1s are also capable of carrying CID and ANI information if they are configured by the carrier by sending DTMF *ANI*DNIS*. However, PRIs handle this more efficiently. While an inband T1 seemingly has a slight advantage due to 24 lines being available to make calls (as opposed to a PRI that has 23), each channel in an inband T1 must perform its own setup and tear-down of each call. A PRI uses the 24th channel as a data channel to perform all the overhead operations of the other 23 channels (including CID and ANI). Although an inband T1 has 24 channels, the 23 channel PRI can set up more calls faster due to the dedicated 24th signalling channel (D Channel).

Before T1 PRI existed there was T1 CAS. T1 CAS is not common today but it still exists. CAS is Channel Associated Signaling. It is also referred to as Robbed Bit Signaling. CAS is a technology with roots in the 60&#x27;s and before.

==Origin of name==
The name T1 came from the carrier letter assigned by AT&amp;T to the technology in 1957, when digital systems were first proposed and developed, AT&amp;T decided to skip Q, R, and S, and to use T, for &quot;time division&quot;. The naming system ended with the letter T, which designated fiber networks. Destined successors of the T1 system of networks, called &quot;T1C&quot;, &quot;T2&quot;, &quot;T3&quot;, and &quot;T4&quot;, were not commercial successes and disappeared quickly. Signals that would have been carried on these systems, called &quot;DS1&quot;, &quot;DS2&quot;, &quot;DS3&quot;, and &quot;DS4&quot;, are now carried on T1 infrastructure.

&quot;DS-1&quot; means &quot;Digital ServiceLevel 1&quot; and has to do with the signal carried—as opposed to the network that delivers it (originally 24 digitized voice channels over a T1). Since the practice of naming networks ended with the letter &quot;T&quot;, the terms &quot;T1&quot; and &quot;DS1&quot; have become synonymous and encompass a variety of services including voice, data, and &quot;clear-channel pipes&quot;. The line speed is always 1.544 Mbit/s, but the payload can vary greatly.

==Alternative technologies==
Dark fiber: &quot;Dark fiber&quot; refers to unused fibers available for use. Dark fiber has been, and still is, available for sale on the wholesale market for both metro and wide area links, but it may not be available in all markets or city pairs.

Dark fiber capacity is typically used by network operators to build SONET and dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) networks, usually involving meshes of self-healing rings. Now, it is also used by end-user enterprises to expand Ethernet local area networks, especially since the adoption of IEEE standards for gigabit Ethernet and 10 Gigabit Ethernet over single-mode fiber. Running Ethernet networks between geographically separated buildings is a practice known as &quot;WAN elimination&quot;.

DS1C is a digital signal equivalent to two &quot;Digital Signal 1&quot; circuits, with extra bits to conform to a signaling standard of 3.152 Mbit/s. Few (if any) of these circuit capacities are still in use today. In the early days of digital and data transmission, the three-megabit-per-second data rate was used to link mainframe computers together. The physical side of this circuit is called T1C.

==Semiconductor==
The T1/E1 protocol is implemented as a &quot;line interface unit&quot; in silicon. The semiconductor chip contains a decoder/encoder, loop backs, jitter attenuators, receivers, and drivers. Additionally, there are usually multiple interfaces and they are labeled as dual, quad, octal, etc., depending upon the number.

The transceiver chip&#x27;s primary purpose is to retrieve information from the &quot;line&quot;, i.e., the conductive line that transverses distance, by receiving the pulses and converting the signal which has been subjected to noise, jitter, and other interference, to a clean digital pulse on the other interface of the chip.

Born in England around 1707, Smith was the illegitimate son of Sir Thomas Lyttelton and a woman of whom details are unknown. He was raised a member of the Lyttelton family, who provided for Smith&#x27;s education and aided him in the beginnings of his career in the Royal Navy.

==Early naval career==

The precise date as to when Smith entered the Royal Navy is unknown, but his first notable appointment in the Service was to the position of junior lieutenant aboard the &quot;Royal Oak&quot; on 6 February 1728, at the appointment of his commanding officer Sir Charles Wager. In June of the same year he was moved to the 44-gun &quot;Gosport&quot; under the command of Captain Duncombe Drake.

While a lieutenant aboard the &quot;Gosport&quot;, Smith attracted great controversy in an incident involving the French corvette &quot;Gironde&quot; on 23 November 1728. At the time of the incident the &quot;Gosport&quot; was harboured in Plymouth Sound and Smith was acting-commanding officer due to all of his superiors being ashore. While in command, a French corvette that had entered the Sound for shelter passed the &quot;Gosport&quot; while departing, and Smith signaled for the French captain ‘to haul in his pennant in respect to the king of Great Britain&#x27;s colours’. Having already saluted the Royal Citadel of Plymouth, the French captain took this as an affront and the French authorities, upon receiving his report, presented an official letter of complaint to the British government. Smith was thus court-martialed and summarily dismissed from the Navy by king&#x27;s order on 27 March 1729. However, due to popular outcry at his dismissal, he was reinstated at the same rank and made second lieutenant of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; on 12 May of the same year, receiving the nickname &#x27;Tom o&#x27;Ten Thousand&#x27; from his fellow seamen.

On 5 May 1730, Smith was promoted to the rank of captain and given the command of the 24-gun &quot;Success&quot;. Two years after this Smith was given command of the &quot;Dursley Galley&quot;, a 20-gun fast frigate stationed in the Mediterranean, mainly tasked with patrolling against Barbary Pirates. Remaining mainly in the Mediterranean, Smith remained in this position for a decade.

==Tenures as Governor of Newfoundland==

In 1740 Smith transferred to the 50-gun &quot;Romney&quot;, on board which he sailed back to Great Britain. Smith then departed aboard the &quot;Romney&quot; with the fishing fleet to Newfoundland, where he was to become Commodore-Governor. He only held this position for one year, resigning in April 1742, but was appointed again in 1743 after a brief return to the Mediterranean.

==Late naval career and the creation of the divisional system==
Smith left the post of governor for good and was placed in command of the 100-gun &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; in September 1745. On 11 February 1745 he was appointed Commander-in-Chief, North Sea a post he held till December 1746, during this period Smith spent a lot of time organising anti-invasion defences off the coast of Suffolk and Essex aboard the 40-gun &quot;Hastings&quot;. In February 1746 he replaced John Byng as Commander-in-Chief, Leith, a position he stayed in until January 1747. Smith was promoted to Vice-Admiral of the White in 1748, and in August 1755 he was made Commander-in-Chief, the Downs.

Soon after taking command of the Downs Squadron in 1755, Smith began to draft a scheme to combat the problems regarding relations between the officers and the men in the Royal Navy. Under this system the lieutenants on board a ship would be placed in charge of a division of the ship&#x27;s company, and would be responsible for the health, welfare and efficiency of the men under their jurisdiction. This system became known as the divisional system. While originally confined to Smith&#x27;s Downs Squadron, it soon spread to other ships in the Service and was widely, though not universally admired, by the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War. By 1765 the system appears to have been the structure of choice for ships in the Royal Navy. A very efficient arrangement, Smith&#x27;s divisional system resulted in increased efficiency and closer control, as well as improved communications between the officers and men on board.

On 8 December 1756 he advanced to Vice-Admiral of the Red. In December 1756 he was ordered back from the Downs to preside over the trial of Admiral John Byng, at which Smith apparently did his utmost (albeit unsuccessfully) to see that the court&#x27;s recommendation of leniency was followed. 
Smith then returned to the Downs Squadron on 24 February 1757 after promotion to the rank of Admiral of the Blue, but ill health forced Smith to declare his retirement the following year.

==Death==

Thomas Smith died at his Rockingham Hall residence on 28 August 1762.

<doc id="907553" wikidata="Q1757013" url="?curid=907553" title="Pegasus-class hydrofoil">
<text>The &quot;Pegasus&quot;-class hydrofoils were a series of fast attack patrol boats employed by the United States Navy. They were in service from 1977 until 1993. These hydrofoils carried the designation &quot;PHM&quot; for &quot;Patrol Hydrofoil, Missile.&quot; The &quot;Pegasus&quot;-class vessels were originally intended for NATO operations in the North Sea and Baltic Sea. Subsequently, participation by other NATO navies, including Germany and Italy, ceased and the U.S. Navy proceeded to procure six PHMs, which were highly successful in conducting coastal operations, such as narcotics interdiction and coastal patrol, in the Caribbean basin.

==History==
In the late 1960s, NATO developed a requirement for a small, fast warship to counter large numbers of Warsaw Pact missile boats, such as the and es, deciding that a hydrofoil would be the best way to meet this requirement. In 1970 Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, the new Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), keen to increase the Navy&#x27;s number of surface vessels in a cost-effective manner, committed the United States to the NATO program for a hydrofoil. The U.S. Navy proposed the PHM design as a NATO standard, with the program being led by the U.S. Navy, and an order placed for two prototypes in 1972. The Italian Navy and the West German &quot;Bundesmarine&quot; signed letters of intent to participate in the programme, with other NATO navies, including the Royal Navy and Canadian Forces studying the project. The U.S. Navy planned to buy up to 30 PHMs, with 10 to be purchased by West Germany and four by Italy.

After Zumwalt&#x27;s retirement, the Navy chose to funnel most of the money for the PHMs into larger vessels. This delayed the ongoing construction of &quot;Pegasus&quot;, and the other vessels were not started. Congress eventually forced the Navy to complete the vessels. The difficulties in project progression forced the other involved navies to abort their participation.

The &quot;Pegasus&quot;-class ships were powered by two twin turbo-charged Mercedes-Benz diesel engines when waterborne, using water jets (designed by Aerojet), giving them a speed of . When foilborne, the ships were powered by a General Electric LM2500 gas turbine and a very large water jet, giving them a speed of over .

&quot;Pegasus&quot; ships were well armed for their size, carrying two four-rack RGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles and an Oto Melara 76 mm gun. The Harpoons, specifically, were capable of sinking far larger ships at distances in excess of . The West German version would have carried the MM38 Exocet.

As &quot;Pegasus&quot; was constructed several years before the rest of the series, there are some slight differences, such as the fire-control system.

All six vessels were constructed by Boeing, in Seattle at the Renton plant at the south end of Lake Washington. They were stationed at NAS Key West. Principal contractors, along with Boeing, were Sperry Corporation for MK 92 Mod 1 fire control system, Hollandse Signaalapparaten and Sperry Corp. (under license) for WM 28 fire control system, OTO-Melara for 76 mm gun, and NAVSEC for design support.

The technology was first pioneered by , where it successfully operated in Vietnam, but ultimately ran aground off Puerto Rico. It was judged to be more advanced than the Grumman which was built at the same time to the same requirements. The primary technology, also used in the Boeing Jetfoil ferries, used submerged flying foils with waterjet propulsion.

The ships were retired because they were not judged cost effective for their mission in a Navy with primarily offensive missions rather than coastal patrol. USS &quot;Aries&quot; PHM-5 Hydrofoil Memorial, Inc. obtained &quot;Aries&quot; for rehabilitation as a memorial located on the Gasconade River in Gasconade, Missouri at . All other PHMs in the class were sold for scrap. In the early 2000s &quot;Gemini&quot; was converted into a yacht, but was abandoned by its owners in the 2010s and scrapped in 2017.

<text>Neuroimaging is a medical technique that allows doctors and researchers to take pictures of the inner workings of the body or brain of a patient. It can show areas with heightened activity, areas with high or low blood flow, the structure of the patients brain/body, as well as certain abnormalities. Neuroimaging is most often used to find the specific location of certain diseases or birth defects such as tumors, cancers, or clogged arteries. Neuroimaging first came about as a medical technique in the 1880s with the invention of the human circulation balance and has since lead to other inventions such as the x-ray, air ventriculography, cerebral angiography, PET/SPECT scans, magnetoencephalography, and xenon CT scanning.

== Neuroimaging Techniques ==

=== Human Circulation Balance ===

The &#x27;human circulation balance&#x27; was a non-invasive way to measure blood flow to the brain during mental activities. This technique worked by placing patients on a table that was supported by a fulcrum, allowing the table to sway depending on activity levels. When patients were exposed to more cognitively complex stimuli, the table would sway towards the head. Invented in 1882 by Angelo Mosso, the &#x27;human circulation balance&#x27; is said to be the first technique of neuroimaging created and is what Mosso is most known for.
=== X-ray ===
In the year of 1895, Wilhelm Roentgen developed the first radiograph, more commonly known as the X-ray. By 1901, Roentgen had been awarded a Nobel Peace Prize for his discovery. Immediately after its release, X-ray machines were being manufactured and used worldwide in medicine. The brain is almost entirely composed of soft tissue that is not radio-opaque, meaning it remains essentially invisible to ordinary or plain X-ray examinations. This is also true of most brain abnormalities, though there are exceptions. For example, a calcified tumor (e.g.,meningioma, craniopharyngioma, and some types of glioma) can easily be seen.

=== Air Ventriculography ===
To combat this, in 1918, neurosurgeon Walter Dandy developed a technique called air ventriculography. This method injected filtered air directly into the lateral ventricles to better take pictures of the ventricle systems of the brain. Thanks to local anesthetics, this was not a painful procedure, but it was significantly risky. Hemorrhage, severe infection, and extreme changes in intrarenal pressure were all threats to the procedure. Despite this, Dandy did not stop there. In 1919, he proceeded to discover Encephalography, a medical procedure used to record the brain&#x27;s electrical activity. This method involved attaching sensors to the brain that detect and measure the brain&#x27;s electrical signals. These signals are then translated into a visual, showing the brain&#x27;s activity patterns. With these early advances, neuroimaging was beginning to be used to diagnose conditions such as epilepsy, brain injuries, and sleep disorders. Providing invaluable information about brain function that would one day be added upon during the devolvement of modern neuroimaging.  

=== Cerebral Angiography ===

Introduced in 1927, cerebral angiography enabled doctors to accurately detect and diagnose anomalies in the brain such as tumors and internal carotid artery occlusions. Over the course of a year, Egas Moniz, the inventor of cerebral angiography, ran experiments with various dye solution percentages that were injected into arteries to help better visualize the blood vessels in the brain before discovering that a solution consisting of 25% sodium iodide was the safest for patients, as well as the most effective in the visualization of blood vessels and arteries within the brain.

=== PET/SPECT Scans ===

A positron emission tomography, or PET scan, is a scan that shows areas of high activity in the body. The way it works is that a patient is first given a radioactive substance (called a tracer) via an injection in the hand or arm. The tracer then circulates through the body and attaches to a specific substance that the organ or tissue produces during metabolism, such as glucose. As a result, positrons are created, and those positrons are scanned by the PET camera. After they are scanned, a computer produces either a 2D or 3D image of the activity occurring within the organ or tissue. The idea for the PET scan was originally proposed by William Sweet in the 1950s, but the first full-body PET scanner wasn&#x27;t actually developed until 1974 by Michael Phelp.

Similarly, the single-photon emission computed tomography scan, or SPECT scan, also works by scanning a tracer within the patient. The difference, however, is that the SPECT directly scans the gamma rays from where the tracer attaches rather than the positrons that the PET scans. As a result, the images that the SPECT scan creates are not as clear as the images produced by a PET scan, but it&#x27;s typically a cheaper procedure to undertake. SPECT was developed by David Kuhl in the 1950s. Kuhl also helped set the foundation that would lead to the PET scan.

=== Magnetoencephalography ===

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a technique that looks for regions of activity in the brain by detecting large groups of electrically charged ions moving through cells. It was originally developed by physicist David Cohen in the early 1970s as a noninvasive procedure. In order to be noninvasive, the MEG was designed like a giant helmet that the patient would put their head inside of and, once turned on, would read the electromagnetic pulses coming from their brain. Later on, in 1972, Cohen invented the SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device), which gave the MEG the ability to detect extremely small changes in ions and magnetic fields in the brain.   

=== Xenon CT Scanning ===

Xenon computed tomography is a modern scanning technique that reveals the flow of blood to the areas of the brain. The scan tests for consistent and sufficient blood flow to all areas of the brain by having patients breathe in xenon gas, a contrast agent, to show the areas of high and low blood flow. Although many trial scans and tests were ran during the development process of computed tomography, British biomedical engineer Godfrey Hounsfield is the founder of the technique and invented the first CT scanner in 1967, which he won a Nobel Prize for in 1979. However, the adoption of the scanners in the United States didn&#x27;t occur until six years later in 1973. Regardless, the CT scanner was already gaining a notable reputation and popularity beforehand.

=== Magnetic resonance imaging ===
Shortly after the initial development of CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI or MR scanning) was developed. Rather than using ionizing or X-radiation, MRI uses the variation in signals produced by protons in the body when the head is placed in a strong magnetic field. Associated with early application of the basic technique to the human body are the names of Jackson (in 1968), Damadian (in 1972), and Abe and Paul Lauterbur (in 1973). Lauterbur and Sir Peter Mansfield were awarded the 2003 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries concerning MRI. At first, structural imaging benefited more than functional imaging from the introduction of MRI. During the 1980s a veritable explosion of technical refinements and diagnostic MR applications took place, enabling even neurological tyros to diagnose brain pathology that would have been elusive or incapable of demonstration in a living person only a decade or two earlier.

<text>Dziady (, &quot;Forefathers&#x27; Eve&quot;) is a poetic drama by the Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz. It is considered one of the greatest works of both Polish and European Romanticism. To George Sand and Georg Brandes, &quot;Dziady&quot; was a supreme realization of Romantic drama theory, to be ranked with such works as Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; and Byron&#x27;s &quot;Manfred&quot;.

The drama&#x27;s title refers to &quot;Dziady&quot;, an ancient Slavic and Lithuanian feast commemorating the dead (the &quot;forefathers&quot;). The drama has four parts, the first of which was never finished. Parts I, II and IV were influenced by Gothic fiction and Byron&#x27;s poetry. Part III joins historiosophical and individual visions of pain and annexation, especially under the 18th-century partitions of Poland. Part III was written ten years after the others and differs greatly from them. The first to have been composed is &quot;Dziady, Part II&quot;, dedicated chiefly to the &quot;Dziady&quot; Slavic feast of commemoration of the dead which laid the foundations of the poem and is celebrated in what is now Belarus.

A ban on the performance of the play was an aspect of the 1968 Polish political crisis.

==The parts==
The drama&#x27;s four parts are described below in the order of their composition.

Part II

In this part, published in 1823, Mickiewicz expresses a philosophy of life, based mainly on folk morality and on his own thoughts about love and death. In the drama, Lithuanian peasants are summoning ghosts to ensure them the access to heaven. The first ghosts are two children who are unable to reach heaven (&quot;light spirits&quot;), as they have never suffered. Then appears a phantom of a cruel heir who is persecuted by birds (&quot;heavy spirit&quot;). They are obliged not to let him eat, because as a living person he did not act like a human being. The next ghost is a phantom of Zosia (m&quot;edium&quot; &quot;spirit&quot;), a young, beautiful shepherdess. Her fault is that she had never returned anybody&#x27;s love, and love is needed for the act of salvation. The final ghost resembles the main hero of the Part IV, Gustaw.

Part IV

Part IV, also from 1823, is believed to be Mickiewicz&#x27;s manifesto of his romantic philosophy of life, and also a story about his love for Maryla Wereszczakówna. The main reason for associating bard&#x27;s and his hero&#x27;s biography is the resemblance of what Gustaw (the protagonist of the drama) says about his tragic youth. He met a fine girl, with whom he fell in love. Unfortunately, she married a rich duke and, subsequently, Gustaw committed suicide. A similar situation took place in poet&#x27;s life, but he managed to forgive his lover. When he was depressed, he wrote the IV part of &quot;Dziady&quot;, one of the most beautiful Polish poems about love and also a fascinating example of the romantic poetry.

The action of the drama is divided into three episodes — the hour of love, the hour of despair and the hour of admonition. The book shows dangers of people&#x27;s romantic nature and reading sentimental masterpieces, which do not show the real world. On the other hand, Gustaw is presented as an owner of the metaphysical knowledge. It is him, not his teacher who eventually notions to the philosophy of Enlightenment and visualizes the true picture of the world, which is the reality conducted by paranormal laws.

Part I

The first part, published after Mickiewicz&#x27;s emigration to France, was probably written in the early 20s, though never finished. Meant to be a picture of &quot;emotion of the 19th-century people&quot;, it was immediately given up by the author. It shows a young girl and boy, feeling confused with and trying to choose between the sentimental idea of love, adjustment to the society and respect to own nature.

Part III 

This part, published in 1832, is thought to be the most significant one, or even one of the finest poems in the Polish literature. The main character bears a resemblance to Gustaw from the IV part, but he is no longer a &quot;romantic lover&quot;. The drama was written after the failure of the November Insurrection, an event which exerted a huge influence over the author. In the Prologue the protagonist of the drama writes on the wall &quot;Today Gustaw has died, today Konrad was born&quot;. Konrad is a name from the previous Mickiewicz&#x27;s novel, &quot;Konrad Wallenrod&quot;. Wallenrod was the hero who sacrificed his life and happiness for his own country&#x27;s sake.

Mickiewicz dedicated his work to people fighting for Polish freedom in the 1830s insurrection and especially to those who were exiled to Siberia by the Russian Tsar. The book describes the cruelty of Tsar Alexander and the persecution of Poles. It has many mysterious episodes; historical characters appear side to side with ghosts, angels and the devil. Poland, according to Mickiewicz&#x27;s visions, was meant to be &quot;the Christ of Europe&quot;: the national suffering was to result in the release of all persecuted people and nationalities, just as Christ&#x27;s death brought salvation.

The characters of the drama are chiefly prisoners, accused of conspiracy against the Russian conqueror. The self-named protagonist is called Konrad. He is a poet. In his monologue, commonly known as &quot;The Great Improvisation&quot; (&quot;Wielka Improwizacja&quot;), he is talking to God about his patriotic feelings and personal misfortune. He compares his works of poetry to the creations of God and nature, and claims that they are completely equal, if not better. Frustrated, Konrad calls God out, accusing Him of letting people suffer — particularly him and Poles under the rule of three foreign empires, and yet still wanting to be called Father, worshipped and loved. The young poet thinks that Creator is baffled by his words and that man knows Him better than any of archangels, because he hears no response. He is ready to fight against God (comparing himself to Satan, but claiming that he will be the more challenging enemy, because, unlike his predecessor, in this battle he will use heart, not reason) for improving the fate of his nation and whole humanity. Meanwhile, angels and devils are struggling over Konrad&#x27;s soul. Another character, a priest called Piotr, has also a vision. When he happens to foretell the country&#x27;s future, he says one of the most mysterious words of the whole drama. Describing a person who will bring back the freedom of Poland, he says:

&quot;The Son of a foreign mother, in his blood old heroes
And his name will be forty and four&quot;.

The whole drama brings back the hope of Polish independence and gives a great picture of Polish society in such a difficult a moment. For instance, recognizable words are:

&quot;Our nation is like lava. On the top it is hard and hideous, but its internal fire cannot be extinguished even in one hundred years of coldness. So let&#x27;s spit on the crust and go down, to the profundity!&quot;

==Interpretation==
&quot;Dziady&quot; is known for its varying interpretations. The best known ones are the moral aspect of part II, the individualist and romantic message of part IV, and the deeply patriotic, messianistic and Christian vision in part III. , however, focuses his interpretation on Slavic pagan and occult elements found in the drama. In his book &quot;Mickiewicz hermetyczny&quot; he writes about the influence of Hermetic, theosophical and alchemical philosophy on the book as well as Masonic symbols (including the controversial theory of Mickiewicz being a communist).

==Performances==
A performance of &quot;Dziady&quot; took place in Kraków&#x27;s &quot;Teatr Miejski&quot; (City Theater) in 1901, directed by Stanisław Wyspiański.

After the communist takeover of Poland, the new government discouraged the staging of &quot;Dziady&quot;. The first postwar production, a major cultural event, opened in November 1945, during the 1945-46 theater season, at &quot;Teatr Miejski&quot; in Opole. It was guest-directed by Jerzy Ronard Bujanski of &quot;Teatr Stary&quot; (the Old Theater) in Kraków, who also starred as Konrad.

Three years later, Leon Schiller began work on a production of &quot;Dziady&quot; at &quot;Teatr Polski&quot; (the Polish Theater) in Warsaw. The opening night was planned for December 1948, but was canceled for a number of reasons, some political.

The next production of &quot;Dziady&quot; in post-World War II Poland was staged only after Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death and took place in November 1955 at Warsaw&#x27;s &quot;Teatr Polski&quot;.

The first ever full staging of the &quot;Dziady&quot; was directed by Michal Zadara and was premiered on February 20, 2016. The performance lasted 14 hours and included six breaks. It began at noon and lasted until 2 in the morning.

<text>Alexander Fraser Tytler, Lord Woodhouselee FRSE (15 October 17475 January 1813) was a Scottish advocate, judge, writer, and historian who was a Professor of Universal History and of Greek and Roman Antiquities at the University of Edinburgh.

==Life==
Tytler was born in the Old Town of Edinburgh, the eldest son of Ann Craig of Costerton (1722–1783) and her husband William Tytler of Woodhouselee (author of &quot;Inquiry into the Evidence against Mary Queen of Scots&quot;). He was educated at Edinburgh High School and Kensington Academy in London (1763/64), and then studied law at the University of Edinburgh, qualifying as an advocate in 1770.

In 1771 he made a tour of France with his cousin, James Ker of Blackshiels.

In 1773 he was living and working with his father, also an advocate, at Campbells Close on the Royal Mile.

In 1780 he was appointed joint professor of Civil History at the University of Edinburgh alongside Prof Pringle. He then moved to Browns Square. He became sole professor in 1786 on the death of Pringle.

In 1790 he became Judge Advocate of Scotland. In 1795 he became seriously ill, and could not attend court.

In 1802 he became a Lord of Session in the Scottish Courts, with the judicial title Lord Woodhouselee.

Tytler&#x27;s other positions included Senator of the College of Justice and George Commissioner of Justiciary in Scotland. Tytler was a friend of Robert Burns, and prevailed upon him to remove lines from his poem &quot;Tam o&#x27; Shanter&quot; which were insulting to the legal and clerical professions.

In 1811 he retired from his role as Senator of the College of Justice his place being filled by David Williamson, Lord Balgray.

He died at his townhouse at 65 Princes Street in Edinburgh and was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard. The vault lies on the west side of the section known as the &quot;Covenanter&#x27;s Prison&quot; which is generally closed to public view.

==Family==

In 1776 he married Ann Fraser of Balnain. Their children included Patrick Fraser Tytler, traveller and historian, James Fraser Tytler, a lawyer, Alexander Fraser Tytler, Assistant Judge and author in Bengal, India, and William Fraser Tytler, a lawyer and historian.

==Translation==
Tytler wrote a treatise that is important in the history of translation theory, the &quot;Essay on the Principles of Translation&quot; (London, 1791). It has been argued in a 1975 book by Gan Kechao that Yan Fu&#x27;s famous translator&#x27;s dictum of fidelity, clarity and elegance came from Tytler.

Tytler said that translation should fully represent the 1) ideas and 2) style of the original and should 3) possess the ease of original composition.

==Quotations on democracy==

In his Lectures, Tytler expressed a critical view of democracy in general and representative democracies such as republics in particular. He believed that &quot;a pure democracy is a chimera&quot;, and that &quot;All government is essentially of the nature of a monarchy&quot;.

In discussing the Athenian democracy, after noting that a great number of the population were actually enslaved, he went on to say, &quot;Nor were the superior classes in the actual enjoyment of a rational liberty and independence. They were perpetually divided into factions, which servilely ranked themselves under the banners of the contending demagogues; and these maintained their influence over their partisans by the most shameful corruption and bribery, of which the means were supplied alone by the plunder of the public money&quot;.

Speaking about the measure of freedom enjoyed by the people in a republic or democracy, Tytler wrote, &quot;The people flatter themselves that they have the sovereign power. These are, in fact, words without meaning. It is true they elected governors; but how are these elections brought about? In every instance of election by the mass of a people—through the influence of those governors themselves, and by means the most opposite to a free and disinterested choice, by the basest corruption and bribery. But those governors once selected, where is the boasted freedom of the people? They must submit to their rule and control, with the same abandonment of their natural liberty, the freedom of their will, and the command of their actions, as if they were under the rule of a monarch&quot;.

Tytler dismisses the more optimistic vision of democracy by commentators such as Montesquieu as &quot;nothing better than an Utopian theory, a splendid chimera, descriptive of a state of society that never did, and never could exist; a republic not of men, but of angels&quot;, for &quot;While man is being instigated by the love of power—a passion visible in an infant, and common to us even with the inferior animals—he will seek personal superiority in preference to every matter of a general concern&quot;.

&quot;Or at best, he will employ himself in advancing the public good, as the means of individual distinction and elevation: he will promote the interest of the state from the selfish but most useful passion of making himself considerable in that establishment which he labors to aggrandize. Such is the true picture of man as a political agent&quot;.

However, Tytler does admit that there are individual exceptions to the rule, and that he is ready to allow &quot;that this form of government is the best adapted to produce, though not the most frequent, yet the most striking, examples of virtue in individuals&quot;, paradoxically because a &quot;democratic government opposes more impediments to disinterested patriotism than any other form. To surmount these, a pitch of virtue is necessary which, in other situations, where the obstacles are less great and numerous, is not called in to exertion. The nature of a republican government gives to every member of the state an equal right to cherish views of ambition, and to aspire to the highest offices of the commonwealth; it gives to every individual of the same title with his fellows to aspire at the government of the whole&quot;.

Tytler believed that democratic forms of government such as those of Greece and Rome have a natural evolution from initial virtue toward eventual corruption and decline. In Greece, for example, Tytler argues that &quot;the patriotic spirit and love of ingenious freedom ... became gradually corrupted as the nation advanced in power and splendour&quot;.

Tytler further states: &quot;Patriotism always exists in the greatest degree in rude nations, and in an early period of society. Like all other affections and passions, it operates with the greatest force where it meets with the greatest difficulties ... but in a state of ease and safety, as if wanting its appropriate nourishment, it languishes and decays&quot;. ... &quot;It is a law of nature to which no experience has ever furnished an exception, that the rising grandeur and opulence of a nation must be balanced by the decline of its heroic virtues&quot;.

==Debatable attribution==

The following quotation has been attributed to Tytler.

:A democracy is always temporary in nature; it simply cannot exist as a permanent form of government. A democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover that they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates who promise the most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that every democracy will finally collapse due to loose fiscal policy, which is always followed by a dictatorship.

:The average age of the world&#x27;s greatest civilizations from the beginning of history has been about 200 years. During those 200 years, these nations always progressed through the following sequence: From bondage to spiritual faith; From spiritual faith to great courage; From courage to liberty; From liberty to abundance; From abundance to selfishness; From selfishness to complacency; From complacency to apathy; From apathy to dependence; From dependence back into bondage.

This text was popularized as part of a longer piece commenting on the 2000 U.S. presidential election, which began circulating on the Internet during or shortly after the election&#x27;s controversial conclusion.

There is no reliable record of Alexander Tytler&#x27;s having written any part of the text. In fact, it actually comprises two parts which did not begin to appear together until the 1970s. The first paragraph&#x27;s earliest known appearance is in an op-ed piece by Elmer T. Peterson in the 9 December 1951 &quot;The Daily Oklahoman&quot;, which attributed it to Tytler:

:Two centuries ago, a somewhat obscure Scotsman named Tytler made this profound observation: &quot;A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the majority discovers it can vote itself largess out of the public treasury. After that, the majority always votes for the candidate promising the most benefits with the result the democracy collapses because of the loose fiscal policy ensuing, always to be followed by a dictatorship, then a monarchy&quot;.

The list beginning &quot;From bondage to spiritual faith&quot; is commonly known as the &quot;Tytler Cycle&quot; or the &quot;Fatal Sequence&quot;. Its first known appearance was in a 1943 speech by Henning W. Prentiss, Jr., president of the Armstrong Cork Company and former president of the National Association of Manufacturers, delivered at the February 1943 convocation of the General Alumni Society of the University of Pennsylvania. The speech was subsequently published under the titles &quot;The Cult of Competency&quot; and &quot;Industrial Management in a Republic&quot;.

<doc id="907567" wikidata="Q524489" url="?curid=907567" title="Brent Hayden">
<text>Brent Matthew Hayden (born October 21, 1983) is a Canadian retired competitive swimmer. Representing Canada for a decade, Hayden is regarded as the fastest swimmer in Canadian history. Hayden won a bronze medal in the 100 m freestyle at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London with a time of 47.80, and was world champion in the same event in 2007 with Filippo Magnini of Italy. By winning the 100 metre, Hayden became the first Canadian in 21 years to win a gold medal at the World Aquatics Championships, and was also the first Canadian to appear in the 100 metre final at the Olympics since Dick Pound at the 1960 Summer Olympics, and the first Canadian to win an Olympic medal in the 100 metre. Hayden added a further three silver and one bronze medal to his World Championship totals.

Hayden is currently the Canadian record-holder in the 200 metre and 100 metre in both the short-course and long-course. He has also held the world record in the 4×100 metre medley relay, and the 4×200 metre freestyle relay. Initially retiring after the London Olympics, Hayden returned to the pool seven years later to compete at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.

==Career==
===2004–2008: Athens to Beijing===
Hayden&#x27;s first Olympics were the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, as part of the Canadian swimming team. At the time Swimming Canada had been in a steady decline and wound up with no medals in Athens. It was a disappointing first Olympic appearance for Hayden, as inexperience took its toll on the 20-year-old. His best individual finish at the Games was thirteenth in the 200-metre freestyle event. It was further worsened when Hayden was mistaken for a protester and beaten up and arrested by the riot police because he was &quot;tall and wearing a dark shirt&quot; the night before the Closing Ceremonies, a week after his competition ended. The injuries sustained left him unable to compete at the World Short Course Championships which were being held a month later.

In Melbourne for the 2006 Commonwealth Games, Hayden won his first major international silver medal when he finished second in the 50 m freestyle, an event he had not intended on racing. He also added three bronze medals at the same games, two from the relays and one in the 200-metre freestyle final. Those medals were a premonition of the success to come at the 2007 World Aquatics Championships, where he tied for the gold medal with the Italian swimmer in the 100 m freestyle; this was the first World Championship for the Canadians since 1986. In the process of winning the gold, Hayden had also shaved down his own national record in the event down to 48.43 and he also added a bronze from the Worlds in the 4×200-metre freestyle relay. As a result of his victory, the mayor of Mission declared &quot;Brent Hayden Day&quot; on May 26, 2007. As well, the Mission Marlins renamed their swim meet to the &quot;Brent Hayden Invitational&quot; and a large mural, painted on the wall of the Mission Leisure Center, by artist Pascal A. Pelletier, was unveiled.

At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, he was a member of the Canadian team that finished sixth in the 4×100 m freestyle event and fifth in the 4×200 m freestyle relay event. Although he qualified third fastest out of sixteen swimmers, one place ahead of Michael Phelps, he did not compete in the semi-finals of the 200 m freestyle. Instead, his coach decided to rest him for the 4×100-metre freestyle, which was held that same day (Hayden set a Canadian record in the opening leg with a time of 47.56). He failed to qualify for the final in the 100 m freestyle despite being the incumbent World Champion in that event. While Hayden was promoted as the best Canadian swimmer at these games with his world title, only fellow long-distance freestyle Ryan Cochrane managed to medal for the nation in the pool, while the remainder of the swim team failed to make the podium despite a general improvement over their 2004 showing.

===2008–2012: London Olympics and retirement===
Hayden attended the 2009 World Aquatics Championships. He failed in the defence of his world title in the 100 m freestyle, placing fourth with a new Canadian record time of 47.27 seconds and missing the podium by 0.02 seconds. César Cielo was the world champion, and set a new world mark of 46.91 seconds. Hayden was the only swimmer in the final to choose not to wear one of the newest &quot;super suits&quot;. He chose to wear the Speedo LZR, which was the suit worn by most swimmers at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, whereas every other swimmer in that final was wearing either the new Arena X-Glide or Jaked (both of these suits are completely covered in polyurethane).

Hayden returned to form at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, clocking the fastest times in his respective events (50 m freestyle, and 100 m freestyle); setting a Games record in the 100 m freestyle during day one, in the 4×100 m freestyle relay final and then breaking his Games record again, in the individual final with a time of 47.98 seconds—0.56 of a second ahead of the silver medallist, Simon Burnett. Hayden held the number one ranking in the world at the time in this event (also being ahead of 22-time Olympic medallist Michael Phelps). In the 50 m freestyle, he won gold with a Games record time of 22.01 seconds. The next season brought further success for Hayden as went on to touch out for the silver on a long glide in the 100 m freestyle final at the 2011 World Aquatics Championships. He had gone into the World Championships having set the previous world&#x27;s best time the last season. His further successes came as Hayden was working on improving his starting 50 m as he was known more as a finisher in the last 50.

After disappointment at the previous two Olympics when he failed to qualify for the 100 m final, he became the first Canadian to do so in swimming&#x27;s glamour event since Dick Pound in 1960. He went on to win bronze medal for Canada at the 2012 Summer Olympics in the 100 m freestyle after a strong start placed him in medal contention at the turn. Gold and silver went to American Nathan Adrian and world champion James Magnussen of Australia, while Hayden beat out Yannick Agnel and César Cielo for third; the medals were also presented by Dick Pound. Though only a bronze, the medal was a redemption for Hayden, who was visibly ecstatic at winning an Olympic medal at long last. With his Olympic medal finally in his possession, he said that &quot;There are so many times when you can dream of something but a million out of a million and one times it won&#x27;t come true. This was one of the things that I was very fortunate as a human being to have happen to me.&quot; Hayden announced his retirement from the sport after the 4×100-metre medley relay at the Olympics but said he believed in the Canadian swim team to thrive in the future, saying that &quot;I think in the grand scheme of things, with the people we have, we&#x27;ve done an amazing job … As long as we keep that momentum building, I think we&#x27;re going to see more success come from more diverse events.&quot;

===2020: Comeback===
In the ensuing Olympic cycle, Swimming Canada would enjoy breakthrough success on the women&#x27;s side, headlined by emerging talent Penny Oleksiak, but the men&#x27;s team struggled greatly after the retirements of Hayden and Cochrane, and would earn no medals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

Hayden was nevertheless inspired by the direction of the program, and after seven years away from the pool he announced a comeback in September 2019. After only 6 months of training, Hayden met the Olympic &quot;A&quot; Qualifying time with a 21.97 in the 50m freestyle at the TYR Pro Series in Des Moines, Iowa. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the 2020 Summer Olympics being delayed by a year, which Hayden would later credit with giving him more time to return to competitive form.

In 2021, Hayden won the 50 m freestyle at the Canadian Olympic Trials with a time of 21.82, well ahead of the FINA &quot;A&quot; standard of 22.01. This was his fourth time representing Canada at the Olympics. He opted not to contest the 100 m in Tokyo, as he and his coaches feared it might trigger back spasms. Hayden&#x27;s return was widely credited for providing leadership to the men&#x27;s program, with the most notable result being the surprise fourth-place finish in the 4x100 m freestyle relay where they were just 0.3 seconds behind the Australians who took the bronze medal, an event where the Canadian team had not been expected to even qualify for the final. Hayden swam a time of 47.99 in the leadoff of the relay, becoming by five years the oldest man to ever swim a time under 48 seconds. Hayden said afterward &quot;this means that I made the right decision to come back.&quot; Hayden also competed in the 50 Metre Freestyle where he reached the semi-finals and just missed a final slot by 0.04 seconds, nonetheless it was his fastest time (post bodysuit), and his best-ever time in the event, leaving him to write on social media “It is such a weird state of confusion when you are torn between the pure competitor in you who realizes you missed the finals by 0.04 seconds and the human who realizes that … at 37 years of age, I came within only 0.04 seconds from the Olympic final.”.

==Personal life==
Despite being a strong freestyle swimmer later in life, as a child he had to repeat his swimming lessons. He is known as &quot;Soup&quot; to his friends due to the superman tattoo he has on his chest. Hayden was born and raised in Mission, but resides in Vancouver. He attended the University of British Columbia where he studied. He also has a black belt in Isshin Ryu karate. After the London 2012 Games, Hayden flew to Lebanon and married Nadina Zarifeh, a singer/songwriter, on August 19.

Hayden appeared on CBC&#x27;s television show Canada&#x27;s Smartest Person as a competitor in 2014, but he did not win the title.

He and his wife Zarifeh created their own line of athletic lifestyle apparel, Astra Athletica, a business which they currently run.

Hayden has also pursued photography as a passion and has had several exhibitions.

Hayden retired from competitive swimming for the first time immediately after the 2012 Games, as he had suffered from back spasms and depression. He ran a swimming camp, and during one video filming session in Beirut in 2020, he did a sprint swim at the bequest of the camp kids and realized that his time was still competitive, convincing him to make a comeback.

<text>Iturup (; ), also historically known by other names, is an island in the Kuril Archipelago separating the Sea of Okhotsk from the North Pacific Ocean. The town of Kurilsk, administrative center of Kurilsky District, is located roughly midway along its western shore. Iturup is the largest and northernmost of the southern Kurils, ownership of which is disputed between Japan and Russia. It is located between Kunashiri to its southwest and Urup to its northeast. The Vries Strait between Iturup and Urup forms the Miyabe Line dividing the predominant plants of the Kurils.

The native inhabitants of the islands since at least the 14th century were the Ainu. Various European explorers passed the area over the years but settlement varied between Russian and Japanese. The island was formally claimed as Japanese territory in 1855. Near the end of the Second World War in 1945, the Soviet Union occupied the southern Kurils and forcibly removed its Japanese residents. Japan continues to claim the islands and considers the northern edge of the island to be its own northernmost point.
==Names==
The modern English name &quot;Iturup&quot; and earlier &quot;Yetorup&quot; are romanizations of the Russian name &quot;Ostrov Iturúp&quot; (, &quot;Iturup Island&quot;). It was previously known in English as Etrof from the Japanese name &quot;Etorofu-tō&quot; (, &quot;Iturup Island&quot;). Both the Russian and Japanese names come from the native Ainu &quot;Etuworop-sir&quot; (), meaning &quot;island with many capes&quot;.

==Geography==
Iturup consists of volcanic massifs and mountain ridges. A series of a dozen calc-alkaline volcanoes running NE to SW form the backbone of the island, the highest being Stokap (1,634 m) in the central part of Iturup. The shores of the island are high and abrupt. The vegetation mostly consists of spruce, larch, pine, fir, and mixed deciduous forests with alder, lianas and Kuril bamboo underbrush. The mountains are covered with birch and Siberian Dwarf Pine scrub, herbaceous flowers (including &quot;Fragaria iturupensis&quot;, the Iturup strawberry) or bare rocks.

The island also contains some high waterfalls, such as the Ilya Muromets.

Rheniite, a rhenium sulfide mineral (ReS2), was discovered in active hot fumaroles on Kudriavy volcano and first described in 2004. In the field it was originally mistaken for molybdenite.

=== Vetrovoy isthmus ===
The development of the Kuril Island arc was significantly influenced by extensive caldera-forming volcanic eruptions during the Late Neo-Pleistocene-Holocene, which introduced large amounts of pumice-pyroclastic material and tephra into the wave processing zone. On Iturup Island, the formation of four large collapse calderas during the Late Neo-Pleistocene-Holocene resulted in the release of about 450 km3 of predominantly dacite pyroclastics.

The formation of the subaerial Vetrovoy isthmus is attributed to the accumulation of such material during powerful explosive caldera-forming eruptions in the shallow strait between neighbouring islands. The present geomorphological appearance of the isthmus is a consequence of subsequent wave and aeolian pyroclastic processing, leading to the formation of marine and lagoon terraces.

A study by Afanas&#x27;ev et al. focuses on examining the existence of the strait separating the southern and northern parts of Iturup Island in the mid-late Holocene from the perspective of coastal geomorphology. Late Pleistocene explosive volcanism is considered to have been more intense and prolonged than Early Holocene events, leading to the formation of pumice deposits in the Prostor Gulf of Iturup Island. Radiocarbon dating of the peat bog underlying the pumice-pyroclastic cover in the Vetrovoy Isthmus suggests events around 38,000–39,000 years ago.

The stratigraphy, genesis and chronology of the Holocene deposits on Iturup Island are poorly studied, relying primarily on C14 dates from Kasatka Bay and Olga Bay[14]. Three transgressive phases of sedimentation, comparable to the Atlantic, Subboreal and Sub-Atlantic periods, with a maximum sea level rise of up to 3.5 metres above the present level in the Atlantic, have been identified at the mouth of the Kurilka River.

Fieldwork conducted in 2017–2018 on the Vetrovoy isthmus revealed volcanic-tectonic dislocations with a layer of beach material, suggesting the occurrence of at least two pyroclastic outbursts in the mid-Late Holocene. Georadar surveys complemented the manual drilling results, providing insights into the geological features of the isthmus.

The deposits of the Vetrovoy Isthmus include volcanic-tectonic dislocations, pumice pyroclastics, aeolian-ash deposits and soil-tephra formations. The morphometric parameters of the basement terrace indicate an area elevation rate during the last phase of coastal marine accumulation that could reach 4 mm/year, slightly higher than the 3.5 m/year recorded during the last 6000 thousand years.

In conclusion, several studies suggest that explosive volcanism in the middle Late Holocene significantly affected the morphotectonic plan of the Vetrovoy Isthmus area, possibly contributing to the obstruction of the strait. The rise of the terrace surface during the middle Holocene may be related to these volcanic events. The rate of uplift of the area during the last phase of coastal marine accumulation is thought to have been about 4 mm/year. However, there are currently no data on the age of the marine georadar facies identified as a result of research on the Vetrovoy isthmus.

==History==
===Prehistory===

The native inhabitants of all the Kuril islands are the Ainu. They have lived there since at least the 14th century.
===Edo period===
Europeans are first recorded visiting this part of the Kurils in 1643 when the under Maarten Gerritsz Vries was exploring Hokkaido and the surrounding area for the Dutch East India Company (VOC). As with neighboring Urup, Iturup is sometimes said to have been the particular island intended in his account, but in fact his description of an enormous continental Company Land (named after the VOC) and a large and prosperous Staten Island (named after the States General) bear no relation to anything in the area, a fact established by Vitus Bering&#x27;s lieutenant Martin Spanberg in a series of voyages in 1738, 1739, and 1742. The phantom Staten Island (; ) still continued to appear on European maps for decades afterward, however, and is now sometimes specifically conflated with Iturup despite its placement on most maps more closely matching Kunashiri.

The Japanese are first recorded reaching Iturup in 1661, when Shichirobei and his company drifted there by accident. Following Bering and Spanberg&#x27;s voyages under the Russian flag, a settlement was established in the late 18th century, prompting the Japanese to establish a garrison around 1800 at the site of present-day Kurilsk. Japanese rule over Iturup was formally recognized in the 1855 Treaty of Shimoda.

===Showa period===
On 26 November 1941, a Japanese carrier fleet left Hitokappu Bay (now called Kasatka Bay), on the eastern shore of Iturup, and sailed for an attack on the American base of Pearl Harbor.

Shana Village was located on Iturup (Etorofu) in the Showa era, before 1945. It was the administrative capital of the Kuril islands. There was a village hospital, an Etorofu Fisheries factory, a radio tower of the post office with a radio receiving antenna. The receiver was battery-powered.

===Post-World War II===
In 1945, according to decisions of the Yalta Conference, Iturup was occupied by the Soviet Union after Japan&#x27;s defeat in World War II. The Japanese inhabitants were expelled to mainland Japan. In 1956 the two countries agreed to restore diplomatic relations, but a peace treaty, , has not been concluded due to the disputed status of Iturup and some other nearby islands.

A Soviet Anti-Air Defense (PVO) airfield, Burevestnik (English: storm-petrel), is located on the island and was until 1993 home to a number of Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 fighter jets. In 1968, Seaboard World Airlines Flight 253A was intercepted over the Kurils and forced to land at Burevestnik with 214 American troops bound for Vietnam. An older airfield, Vetrovoe, exists on the eastern part of the island and may have been used primarily by Japanese forces during World War II.

===Contemporary period===
A new international airport, Iturup Airport, was opened in 2014, east of Kurilsk. It was the first airport built from scratch in Russia&#x27;s post-Soviet history. It has a , runway and can receive Antonov An-74-200 aircraft. It also has a military use. The Burevestnik military airfield to the south, in the past received civilian aircraft as well, but was often closed because of fog. Burevestnik is now a reserve airfield for the new airport. On February 2, 2018, PBS NewsHour reported that Russia announced it was sending fighter planes to Iturup. Su-35 aircraft landed on a reserve airfield on the island in March 2018 and Su-35s were then deployed to Iturup airport on a trial basis in August 2018.

Administratively, the island belongs to the Sakhalin Oblast of the Russian Federation. Japan claims Iturup as part of Nemuro Subprefecture.

<doc id="907585" wikidata="Q104840571" url="?curid=907585" title="Bear's Son Tale">
<text>&quot;Bear&#x27;s Son Tale&quot; () refers to an analogous group of narratives that, according to &#x27;s 1910 thesis, represent the fairy tale material reworked to create the Anglo-Saxon poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;″s first part, the Grendel-kin Story. Panzer collected over 200 analogue tales mostly from Eurasia. Others have added more examples from worldwide.

The Bear&#x27;s Son motif (B635.1) is exhibited only generally, not reliably. Exceptions include versions of &quot;Jean de l&#x27;Ours&quot;, and the Grimms&#x27; fairy tale &quot;Strong Hans&quot; or &quot;&quot;. &quot;Beowulf&quot; does not explicitly reveal a bear origin for its hero, but his name and great strength connect him to the animal closely.

Most of the tales are formally catalogued as either Aarne-Thompson-Uther folktale type 301, &quot;The Three Stolen Princesses&quot; or ATU type 650A, &quot;Strong John&quot; or &quot;Starker Hans&quot;. Their plotlines are similar, with some differences; in the latter, the hero is subjected to tests by ordeal.

&quot;Bear&#x27;s Son Tale&quot; has thus become only an informal term for tale type classification in folkloristics, but scholars in &quot;Beowulf&quot; criticism continue to assert the usefulness of the term in their studies.

==Core characteristics==

Studies comparing the poem &quot;Beowulf&quot; to the Bear&#x27;s Son Tale see these common core characteristics: a hero is raised by or descended from a bear, with bear-like strength. He and companions must guard a dwelling against a monster (which Panzer calls &quot;Der Dämon im Waldhaus&quot;). The companions are defeated, but the hero wounds the creature, sending him to flight. In pursuit, the hero descends into a netherworld or underground domain. The hero often has a second round of adversaries.

Other common elements are a captive princess, betrayal by a close friend or ally of the hero, and magical weapons. Some of these elements are paralleled in the Grendel story in &quot;Beowulf&quot;, others are not.

==Parallel elements==
Some of the traits in the Bear&#x27;s Son Tale regarded as being paralleled in &quot;Beowulf&quot; will be explained further below.

===Betrayal===

The betrayal element (F601.3) transpires in the fairy tale version (see Jean de l&#x27;Ours) as follows: After the hero descends to the world underground and rescues the princess, he is betrayed by his companions, who instead of pulling him up by a rope, either cut it or release it so he falls to the bottom. The parallel to this in &quot;Beowulf&quot;, (according to Panzer and Chambers) is that after seeing blood come up from Grendel&#x27;s &quot;mere&quot; (lake), the Danes only wait until nones (3 PM), and then they abandon the hero at the lake.

===Magic weapon===
The hero in the Bear&#x27;s Son Tale may have a magic sword (motif D1081, usually found in Type 301A) or a walking-stick (Type 301B). The magic sword in &quot;Beowulf&quot; is supposedly represented by the sword of the &quot;ancient giants&#x27; sword&quot; (&quot;ealdsweord eotenisc&quot;) that Beowulf discovered in Grendel&#x27;s mother&#x27;s lair.

==Elements lacking in &quot;Beowulf&quot;==
Some significant elements of the folktale missing in &quot;Beowulf&quot; (listed by Chambers) are: the captive , one of whom he marries, the hero&#x27;s rescue by a &quot;miraculous helper&quot;, his return to the Upper World under an assumed identity, and his retribution against his treacherous companions.

===Princess===
The princess or three princesses to be rescued are lacking in &quot;Beowulf&quot;, but this absence has been rationalized by W. W. Lawrence, who theorized that romantic love elements are superfluous and out-of-place in historical epics and had to be truncated.

==Elements in &quot;Beowulf&quot; not in folktale==
Among elements considered vital to the epic are the loss of the ogre/demon&#x27;s arm, and the trail of blood which leads the hero to the demon&#x27;s lair (, cited by ). These are not paralleled in any obvious way in the Bear&#x27;s Son Tale.

===Grendel&#x27;s severed arm===
Regarding Beowulf wrenching Grendel&#x27;s arm off, Robert A. Barakat stated that no counterpart was to be found in the Bear&#x27; Son Tale of &quot;Juan del Oso&quot; (Spanish version of Jean de l&#x27;Ours). This was because there was no mention of &quot;actual physical damage [Juan] inflicted&quot; on the devil during the barehanded wrestling phase. However, Juan did cut off one of the devil&#x27;s ears afterwards with his weapon.

For a folktale analogue to Grendel&#x27;s severed arm, commentators have looked on Celtic (Irish) tale of &quot;The Hand and Child&quot; type. The parallel had been recognized already in the 19th century by several writers, but Carl Wilhelm von Sydow is generally credited with developing the analysis which took notice.

===Trail of blood===
Beowulf determines Grendel&#x27;s lair by following a trail of blood. Although this is not specifically mirrored in the Bear&#x27;s Son Tale, the hero is able to track the adversary to a hole in the ground (or a well), and a trail of blood has been speculated. Chambers found that an Icelandic Bear&#x27;s Son Tale, &quot;Bjarndrengur&quot; (&quot;Bear-boy&quot;) parallels this exactly, and Bear-boy and his companions follow the blood-trail of the giant who had been grabbed by the beard but who has torn away.

==History and reception==
&#x27;s monumental study, &quot;Studien zur germanischen Sagengeschichte&quot;, Part I: &quot;Beowulf&quot;, sought to prove that &quot;Beowulf&quot; was an eighth century Anglo-Saxon reworking of the &quot;Bear&#x27;s son&quot; motif, which has been present since antiquity and widely disseminated. Later, the Panzer hypothesis on Beowulf was supported by W. W. Lawrence and R. W. Chambers, who elucidated and expanded on it.

John F. Vickrey, who took up the thesis in 2009, wrote that there had been very few studies focusing on the folkloric origins of &quot;Beowulf&quot; for 40 years previous to his writing.

J. R. R. Tolkien was very interested in the idea of the bear-son folktale underlying &quot;Beowulf&quot;, and pointed to several minor but illuminating characteristics supporting the assumption: Beowulf&#x27;s uncouthness and appetite, the strength of his grip, and his refusal to use weapons against Grendel. He also saw Unferth as a link between folktale and legend, his (covert) roles as smith and treacherous friend standing behind his gift to Beowulf of the &quot;hafted blade&quot; that &quot;fails&quot;.

Critics of Panzer&#x27;s thesis have argued however that many of the incidents he sees as specific to the Bear&#x27;s Son Story are in fact generic folktale elements; and that a closer analogue to &quot;Beowulf&quot; is to be found in Celtic mythology and the story of the &#x27;Monstrous Arm&#x27;.

==Tale group==
Panzer lists some 202 examples of Bear&#x27;s Son Tales in his study,

The &quot;Strong John&quot; subgroup includes more than 400 tales counted in the Baltic-Scandinavia area. The tale remained current in French Canada, but its original may no longer survive in France.

===North American examples===
Panzer&#x27;s list did not include any North American examples, but &quot;Bear&#x27;s son&quot; tales have been known to have disseminated to native North American populations, and these are considered to have European origins, an example being the Assiniboine story published as &quot;The Underground Journey&quot; by Robert H. Lowie in 1909.

==Other literary examples==
There are several other literary examples perceived as being related to Bear&#x27;s Son Tales.

One example regarded as particularly important to the &quot;Beowulf&quot; study is the bear-hero Böðvar Bjarki who appears as a companion to Hrólf Kraki in the legendary saga &quot;Hrólfs saga kraka&quot;.

Another literary incident is in the &quot;Grettis saga&quot;, or the saga of Grettir the Strong.

Also, there have been attempts to associate King Arthur with the bear, and thus with the Bear&#x27;s Son Tales. An attempt to make the connection by asserting Arthur&#x27;s name as based on the root &quot;arth-&quot; meaning &quot;bear&quot; in Welsh has been refuted. Therefore, a more elaborate explanation has been advanced, which postulates Arthur&#x27;s prototype to be the mythological Arcturus &quot;guardian of the bear&quot; of constellation lore.

Odysseus in the cave of Polyphemus has also been related to the theme.

==Psychoanalytic interpretations==
For psychoanalysis, the bear-parents represent the parents seen in their animal (sexual) guise – the bear as the dark, bestial aspect of the parental archetype. Their offspring, represented by Tolkien in &quot;Sellic Spell&quot; as &quot;a surly, lumpish boy...slow to learn the speech of the land&quot;, is the undersocialised child. And in the underground struggle, Géza Róheim argued, we find a representation of the primal scene, as encapsulated in the infantile unconscious.

<doc id="907589" wikidata="Q323452" url="?curid=907589" title="Bernard Lee">
<text>John Bernard Lee (10 January 190816 January 1981) was an English actor, best known for his role as M in the first eleven Eon-produced James Bond films. Lee&#x27;s film career spanned the years 1934 to 1979, though he had appeared on stage from the age of six. He was trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. Lee appeared in over one hundred films, as well as on stage and in television dramatisations. He was known for his roles as authority figures, often playing military characters or policemen in films such as &quot;The Third Man&quot;, &quot;The Blue Lamp&quot;, &quot;The Battle of the River Plate&quot;, and &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot;.

==Early life==
Lee was born on 10 January 1908, the son of Nellie (née Smith) and Edmund James Lee. He was born in either County Cork in what is now the Republic of Ireland, or Brentford, Middlesex. Edmund, an actor, introduced his six-year-old son to the stage in 1914 in a sketch called &quot;The Double Event&quot; at the Oxford Music Hall in London. Lee attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and worked as a fruit porter to pay his fees.

==Early acting career ==
After graduating from RADA in the 1930s, Lee began working in repertory theatre in Cardiff and in Rusholme, Manchester, before beginning work on the West End stage in thrillers, such as &quot;Blind Man&#x27;s Bluff&quot;. He also played comedic roles, such as in the play &quot;Ten Minute Alibi&quot; with Arthur Askey.

Lee&#x27;s screen debut was in &quot;The Double Event&quot; (1934), followed by a role as Cartwright in Berthold Viertel&#x27;s &quot;Rhodes of Africa&quot; (1936), a biopic of Cecil Rhodes, in which he starred alongside Walter Huston, Oscar Homolka, and Basil Sydney. Although Lee was in wartime service in the army between 1940 and 1946, he had managed to act in several films earlier which were released between 1939 and 1943, including &quot;Murder in Soho&quot;, &quot;The Frozen Limits&quot;, and &quot;Let George Do It!&quot; (known in the US as &quot;To Hell with Hitler&quot;, 1940) with George Formby.

==Military service==
Lee served with the Royal Sussex Regiment during the Second World War. While waiting to be demobbed he attended a golfing ladies&#x27; night where he met a producer. This subsequently led to his being offered a part in the play &quot;Stage Door&quot;.

==Film and stage actor ==
In the late 1940s, Lee returned to the stage whilst also developing a successful film career. He had appeared in &quot;Murder in Soho&quot; (1939) then in Herbert Wilcox&#x27;s &quot;The Courtneys of Curzon Street&quot; (1947), playing a colonel alongside Anna Neagle, Michael Wilding and Daphne Slater; the film was a major success and became the biggest hit at the British box office of 1947. He developed a reputation for playing &quot;solid, dependable characters such as policemen, serving officers or officials&quot; in films such as &quot;The Fallen Idol&quot; (1948), &quot;The Third Man&quot; (1949), &quot;The Blue Lamp&quot; (1950), &quot;Last Holiday&quot; (1950), &quot;Cage of Gold&quot; (1950), &quot;Mr. Denning Drives North&quot; (1952), &quot; White Corridors&quot; (1951), &quot;The Yellow Balloon&quot; (1953), &quot;Beat the Devil&quot; (1953), and &quot;Father Brown&quot; (1954), and commanders, colonels, or brigadiers in films such as &quot;Morning Departure&quot; (1950), &quot;Calling Bulldog Drummond&quot; (1951), &quot;Appointment with Venus&quot; (1951), and many more. In John Huston&#x27;s &quot;Beat the Devil&quot; (1953), Terence Pettigrew considers Lee to have been instrumental to the climax of the film, remarking that it was &quot;left to Bernard Lee to inject a badly needed touch of earthiness at the end.&quot; In total, Lee appeared in over one hundred films during his career.

During the 1950s, Lee had a long run on stage, appearing as Able Seaman Turner in &quot;Seagulls Over Sorrento&quot;, a role he later reprised in the film of the same name with Gene Kelly (released in the US as &quot;Crest of the Wave&quot;). Lee starred opposite Gregory Peck in &quot;The Purple Plain&quot; (1954), playing a Royal Air Force medical officer based in Burma during the late Second World War and portrayed Captain Patrick Dove in Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger&#x27;s war film &quot;The Battle of the River Plate&quot; (1956), based upon the battle of the same name. He starred alongside John Gregson, Anthony Quayle and Peter Finch. George Lovell remarked that Captain Patrick Dove was played &quot;ponderously by Bernard Lee, but he forms a much closer bond with the battleship&#x27;s commander, Captain Langsdorff (Peter Finch).&quot; The film was the fourth most popular film in Britain in 1957. Other films of this period include &quot;The Spanish Gardener&quot; (1956), &quot;Dunkirk&quot; (1958), &quot;Beyond This Place&quot; (1959), &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot; (1961), and &quot;The L-Shaped Room&quot; (1962).

In 1962 Lee was cast in the role that &quot;The Illustrated Who&#x27;s Who of the Cinema&quot; described as his best remembered, playing the character of M, the head of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6)—and the superior of James Bond—in the first Eon Productions film, &quot;Dr. No&quot;. A number of writers have noted that Lee&#x27;s interpretation of the character was in line with the original literary representation; Cork and Stutz observed that Lee was &quot;very close to Fleming&#x27;s version of the character&quot;, whilst Rubin commented on the serious, efficient, no-nonsense authority figure. Smith and Lavington, meanwhile, remarked that Lee was &quot;the very incarnation of Fleming&#x27;s crusty admiral.&quot; One American newspaper, &quot;The Spokesman-Review&quot;, described Lee as &quot;a real roast-beef-and-Yorkshire-pudding type of British actor&quot;. Murray Pomerance refers to Lee as a &quot;paternal actor&quot; in embodying this role.

Terence Pettigrew, in his study &quot;British film character actors: great names and memorable moments&quot; agreed, noting that Lee was a &quot;gruff, reliable, no-nonsense role character actor&quot;, with &quot;kindly eyes, droll manner and expressly Anglo-Saxon level-headedness&quot;. In 1967, Lee appeared in &quot;O.K. Connery&quot;, a spoof of the James Bond film series which starred Connery&#x27;s brother Neil Connery, Lois Maxwell (Miss Moneypenny), and several former actors of the series. During this period he also appeared in several ITC television productions such as &quot;The Baron&quot;, &quot;Man in a Suitcase&quot;, and &quot;Danger Man&quot;. In 1972, he portrayed Tarmut the sculptor in Terence Fisher&#x27;s Hammer Horror picture &quot;Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell&quot;, alongside Peter Cushing, Shane Briant, and David Prowse; it was not released until 1974.

==Personal life==
On 30 January 1972, Lee&#x27;s first wife, Gladys Merredew, died in a fire at their 17th-century home in Oare, Kent, which also left Lee hospitalised. According to the actor Jack Warner, &quot;Bernard and Gladys had a lovely 17-century cottage in the Kent village of Oare, and it was there she died tragically in a fire early in 1972. Bernard and Gladys were trapped in their bedroom when the fire started on the ground floor. Bernard escaped through a window and ran to get a ladder in an attempt to rescue Gladys, but unhappily was unsuccessful. It was an awful end to a long and happy marriage.&quot; In February 1972, Lee was mugged and robbed by two youths. After the mugging and fire, Lee turned to drink, was unable to find work for two years, and ran into debt. By chance, Lee met Richard Burton in a pub, who, upon hearing of Lee&#x27;s problems, gave him a cheque for $6,000 to clear his debts, together with a note saying that everyone has a spot of trouble once in a while. Burton&#x27;s gift assisted Lee in overcoming his depression. In 1975, both Lee and Lois Maxwell accepted roles in their usual Bond characters in the poorly received French James Bond spoof, &quot;From Hong Kong with Love&quot;.

Three years after the fire, Lee married television director&#x27;s assistant Ursula McHale. Lee&#x27;s first marriage produced a daughter, Ann, who also followed her father onto the stage, and did so with his blessing, Lee saying &quot;She&#x27;s doing what she wants to do and enjoying every moment of it.&quot; Ann later married Alan Miller, a stage actor and later stage manager at the BBC: their son is the British actor Jonny Lee Miller. Lee&#x27;s hobbies included golf, fishing, reading, music and sailing.

==Death==
In November 1980, Lee was admitted to the Royal Free Hospital in London, suffering from stomach cancer. He died there on 16 January 1981, six days after his 73rd birthday; his wife Ursula was present at his death. After his death, Ursula joined Exit (now Dignity in Dying) after witnessing Lee&#x27;s suffering. Lee was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on Friday, January 23, 1981.

Lee died after filming began on &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, but before he could film his scenes as M. Out of respect for Lee, no replacement was found, and the script was rewritten so that the character was said to be on leave. A year after Lee&#x27;s death, Terence Pettigrew summarised his acting work as a &quot;Gruff, reliable, no-nonsense role character actor, whose many credits include policemen, servicemen, father figures, and spy chiefs. Mostly shows the honest, hard-working face of officialdom, with only very occasional lapses.&quot; Lee was replaced in the role of M by Robert Brown, who acted with Lee in &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;.

==Filmography and other works==

From 1962 to 1979 Lee featured in eleven James Bond films as the character M, Bond&#x27;s superior:

<doc id="907595" wikidata="Q5415368" url="?curid=907595" title="Evan Dorkin">
<text>Evan Dorkin (born April 20, 1965) is an American comics artist and cartoonist. His best known works are the comic books &quot;Milk and Cheese&quot; and &quot;Dork&quot;, the latter of which features his comic &quot;Eltingville&quot;. His comics often poke fun at fandom, even while making it clear that Dorkin is a fan himself. Dorkin also served as a writer on the Adult Swim animated series &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; from 1994 to 1999, and created a pilot for an animated adaptation of &quot;Eltingville&quot; for Adult Swim in 2002.

== Life and career ==
Dorkin was born in Brooklyn, New York, and moved with his family to Staten Island when he was 13 years old. He grew up reading superhero comics (being loyal to Marvel over DC), &quot;Mad&quot; magazine, and humor titles by Archie Comics and Harvey Comics. He became even more obsessed with comics when comic book retailer Jim Hanley opened a store location near his high school; Dorkin later ended up working there.

Dorkin aspired to attend the School of Visual Arts in the animation department, but was not accepted. (He had taken some animation classes at SVA while he was in high school.) Dorkin ended up attending New York University Tisch School of the Arts, but eventually switched his passion from animation to comics.

Dorkin&#x27;s earliest published solo comics were &quot;Pirate Corp$&quot; (later renamed &quot;Hectic Planet&quot;), published first by Eternity Comics and then Slave Labor Graphics from 1987 to 1989; and then a variety of &quot;Milk &amp; Cheese&quot; titles, published by Slave Labor Graphics from 1991 to 1997.

As well as his comics work, Dorkin and his wife, Sarah Dyer, have written for &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;. Dorkin drew the cover art for several ska compilation albums and an EP by Radon in the 1990s. He wrote and produced an animated television pilot for Adult Swim titled &quot;Welcome to Eltingville&quot;, based on his own characters. He and Dyer wrote some episodes of the &quot;&quot; including the episode &quot;Live Wire&quot;, which introduced a new character of the same name. Dorkin wrote the &quot;Superman and Batman: World&#x27;s Funnest&quot; one-shot in 2000 which was drawn by various artists. Dorkin and Dyer worked as freelance writers on the 2006 English-language version of the anime &quot;Crayon Shin-chan&quot;, where they wrote material for the show&#x27;s first six episodes. Dorkin co-created &quot;Beasts of Burden&quot; with Jill Thompson. Dyer has frequently colored Dorkin&#x27;s art.

<doc id="907601" wikidata="Q836851" url="?curid=907601" title="Washington State Route 599">
<text>State Route 599 (SR 599) is a state highway and freeway in King County, Washington, United States. It is located entirely within the city of Tukwila and travels northwest along the Duwamish River between junctions with Interstate 5 (I-5) and SR 99. The freeway has one intermediate exit and follows the Central Link light rail line.

==Route description==

SR 599 is long and travels on a four-lane freeway located entirely within the city of Tukwila in suburban King County. It begins at a Y interchange with I-5 near Foster Memorial Park, approximately north of the Southcenter Mall and the terminus of Interstate 405. The interchange lacks connections to the north side of I-5, which are provided by the parallel Interurban Avenue, and has a direct offramp to the high-occupancy vehicle lanes on southbound I-5. The only intermediate junction on SR 599 is a partial cloverleaf interchange at South 133rd Street near several office parks, including the headquarters of BECU.

The freeway then travels northwest, following the elevated Central Link light rail tracks to the west and the Duwamish River and the Green River Trail to the east. SR 599 then turns west to travel around a King County Metro bus base, which has a direct onramp to the southbound freeway, and crosses under the light rail tracks at East Marginal Way South. The freeway turns west and intersects Tukwila International Boulevard, which marks the end of SR 599 and where SR 99 resumes. SR 99 continues northwest along the freeway and into Seattle on West Marginal Way.

SR 599 is maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) and is designated as a minor route of the National Highway System. WSDOT conducts an annual survey of average traffic volume on the state highway system that is measured in terms of annual average daily traffic, finding in 2016 that approximately 44,000 vehicles use SR 599.

==History==
SR 599 became a state highway in 1971, but had been part of Washington&#x27;s older highway system (Primary and Secondary Highways) from 1957 to 1970. The highway, then known as PSH 1 WM, or West Marginal Branch, was built during the 1960s. When it was completed and opened to traffic in June 1968, U.S. Route 99 (US 99) was about to be removed from the system, so when I-5 was completed up to Tukwila, US 99 switched to the route of SR 599. Later on, the current route of SR 599 became known as US 99T (Temporary) and later SR 99T in 1964. In 1971, the highway became SR 599. SR 181 was temporarily routed alongside the freeway on Interurban Avenue until 1971.

<text>Thomas Vernor Smith (April 26, 1890 – May 24, 1964), who wrote under the byline T. V. Smith, was an American philosopher, scholar, and politician from Illinois, as well as an officer in the United States Army.

==Biography==
Smith was born in a log cabin in Blanket, Texas, on April 26, 1890. He graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 1915, and from the University of Chicago in 1922. Smith entered the Army during World War I and served as a private until discharged on January 28, 1919.

Smith was a member of the faculty of Texas Christian University from 1916 to 1918. After his military service, he resumed his academic career in philosophy at the University of Texas from 1919 to 1921, and he served as a dean and a teacher of philosophy at the University of Chicago from 1922 to 1948. He earned a doctorate from the University of Chicago. His dissertation was &quot;The American Doctrine of Equality.&quot; He authored numerous books, many articles, and served as editor of the &quot;International Journal of Ethics&quot; from 1931 to 1948. Smith began his political career as a member of the Illinois State Senate from 1935 until 1938, during which he authored a number of bills to aimed at reforming the legislative process. He was the chairman of the Illinois Legislative Council in 1937 and 1938. Smith was subsequently elected as a Democrat to the Seventy-sixth United States Congress, from January 3, 1939, through January 3, 1941. Smith failed to be reelected in 1940 for another term. He subsequently published an article titled &quot;Is Congress Any Good, Anyhow?&quot; His response to the question he posed was that in spite of &quot;its pestiferous ways, yes, Congress is some good.&quot;
During World War II, Smith returned to the Army as a lieutenant colonel and later as a colonel, serving from 1943 to 1946. He was the director of education of the Allied Control Commission in Italy from November 24, 1943, to November 11, 1944. The Italian scholar and translator, Thomas G. Bergin worked under Colonel Smith in Salerno immediately after the Nazi army had retreated towards northern Italy. Bergin described his experience with Smith, saying. &quot;I could not have wished for a more inspiring or sympathetic chief.&quot; Bergin described the purposes of the Education Sub-Commission under Smith in war-torn Italy were to provide first aid and defascistization to the school system, then to hand the administration back to the Italian Government: &quot;The readjustment in educational matters … called for patience, tact and good will on both sides. Col Smith had all those virtues.&quot; Adding to the challenges, nearby Mount Vesuvius awoke with one of its most violent eruptions, which overwhelmed five towns. Smith was charged with responsibilities of organizing military efforts to track and mitigate the disaster.

In 1948, Smith resumed his profession as a writer and teacher at the Syracuse University until his retirement in 1959. Smith married Nannie Stewart, they had two children, a son Gayle and a daughter Nancy. He resided in Hyattsville, Maryland, until his death there on May 24, 1964, Smith is interred at Arlington National Cemetery.

<text>The or are an East Asian ethnic group that comprises over 98% of the population of Japan. Genetic and anthropometric studies have shown that the Yamato people predominantly descend from the Yayoi and Kofun people, who migrated to Japan from the continent beginning during the 1st millennium BC, and to a lesser extent the indigenous Jōmon people who had inhabited the Japanese archipelago for millennia prior.

It can also refer to the first people that settled in Yamato Province (modern-day Nara Prefecture). Generations of Japanese archeologists, historians, and linguists have debated whether the word is related to the earlier . Around the 6th century, the Yamato clan set up Japan&#x27;s first and only dynasty. The clan became the ruling faction in the area, and incorporated the natives of Japan and migrants from the mainland. The clan leaders also elevated their own belief system that featured ancestor worship into a national religion known as Shinto.

The term came to be used around the late 19th century to distinguish the settlers of mainland Japan from minority ethnic groups inhabiting the peripheral areas of the then Japanese Empire, including the Ainu, Ryukyuans, Nivkh, as well as Chinese, Koreans, and Austronesians (Taiwanese indigenous peoples and Micronesians) who were incorporated into the Empire of Japan in the early 20th century. The term was eventually used as race propaganda. After Japan&#x27;s surrender in World War II, the term became antiquated for suggesting pseudoscientific racist notions that have been discarded in many circles. Ever since the fall of the Empire, Japanese statistics only count their population in terms of nationality, rather than ethnicity.

==Etymology==

The &quot;Wajin&quot; (also known as &quot;Wa&quot; or &quot;Wō&quot;) or &quot;Yamato&quot; were the names early China used to refer to an ethnic group living in Japan around the time of the Three Kingdoms period. Ancient and medieval East Asian scribes regularly wrote &quot;Wa&quot; or &quot;Yamato&quot; with one and the same Chinese character , which translated to &quot;dwarf&quot;, until the 8th century, when the Japanese found fault with it, replacing it with &quot;harmony, peace, balance&quot;. Retroactively, this character was adopted in Japan to refer to the country itself, often combined with the character , literally meaning &quot;Great&quot;. 

The historical province of Yamato within Japan (now Nara Prefecture in central Honshu) borders Yamashiro Province (now the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture); however, the names of both provinces appear to contain the Japonic etymon &quot;yama&quot;, usually meaning &quot;mountain(s)&quot; (but sometimes having a meaning closer to &quot;forest&quot;, especially in some Ryukyuan languages). Some other pairs of historical provinces of Japan exhibit similar sharing of one etymological element, such as Kazusa (&lt;*&quot;Kami-tu-Fusa&quot;, &quot;Upper Fusa&quot;) and Shimōsa (&lt;*&quot;Simo-tu-Fusa&quot;, &quot;Lower Fusa&quot;) or Kōzuke (&lt;*&quot;Kami-tu-Ke&quot;, &quot;Upper Ke&quot;) and Shimotsuke (&lt;*&quot;Simo-tu-Ke&quot;, &quot;Lower Ke&quot;). In these latter cases, the pairs of provinces with similar names are thought to have been created through the subdivision of an earlier single province in prehistoric or protohistoric times.

Although the etymological origins of Wa remain uncertain, Chinese historical texts recorded an ancient people residing in the Japanese archipelago, named something like *&quot;ʼWâ&quot; or *&quot;ʼWər&quot; . Carr surveys prevalent proposals for the etymology of &quot;Wa&quot; ranging from feasible (transcribing Japanese first-person pronouns &quot;waga&quot; &quot;my; our&quot; and &quot;ware&quot; &quot;I; we; oneself&quot;) to shameful (writing Japanese &quot;Wa&quot; as implying &quot;dwarf&quot;), and summarizes interpretations for *&quot;ʼWâ&quot; &quot;Japanese&quot; into variations on two etymologies: &quot;behaviorally &#x27;submissive&#x27; or physically &#x27;short. The first &quot;submissive; obedient&quot; explanation began with the (121 CE) &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot; dictionary. It defines as &quot;obedient/submissive/docile appearance&quot;, graphically explains the &quot;person; human&#x27; radical with a &quot;wěi&quot; &quot;bent&quot; phonetic, and quotes the above &quot;Shi Jing&quot; poem. &quot;Conceivably, when Chinese first met Japanese,&quot; Carr suggests, &quot;they transcribed &quot;Wa&quot; as *&quot;ʼWâ&quot; &#x27;bent back&#x27; signifying &#x27;compliant&#x27; bowing/obeisance. Gestures of respect is noted in early historical references to Japan.&quot; Examples include &quot;Respect is shown by squatting&quot;, and &quot;they either squat or kneel, with both hands on the ground. This is the way they show respect.&quot;

Koji Nakayama interprets &quot;winding&quot; as &quot;very far away&quot; and euphemistically translates as &quot;separated from the continent&quot;. The second etymology of meaning &quot;dwarf (variety of an animal or plant species), midget, little people&quot; has possible cognates in &quot;low, short (of stature)&quot;, &quot;strain; sprain; bent legs&quot;, and &quot;lie down; crouch; sit (animals and birds)&quot;. Early Chinese dynastic histories refer to a &quot;pygmy/dwarf country&quot; located south of Japan, associated with possibly Okinawa Island or the Ryukyu Islands. Carr cites the historical precedence of construing Wa as &quot;submissive people&quot; and the &quot;Country of Dwarfs&quot; legend as evidence that the &quot;little people&quot; etymology was a secondary development.

==History of usage==

===After Meiji restoration===
====Propaganda====

Scientific racism was a Western idea that was imported from the late nineteenth century onward. Despite the notion being hotly contested by Japanese intellectuals and scholars, the false notion of racial homogeneity was used as propaganda due to the political circumstances of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Japan, which coincided with Japanese imperialism and World War II. Pseudoscientific racial theories, which included the false belief of the superiority of the Yamato character, were used to justify military expansionism, discriminatory practices, and ethnocentrism. The concept of &quot;pure blood&quot; as a criterion for the uniqueness of the Yamato &quot;minzoku&quot; began circulating around 1880 in Japan, around the time some Japanese scientists began investigations into eugenics.

Initially, to justify Imperial Japan&#x27;s conquest of Continental Asia, Imperial Japanese propaganda espoused the ideas of Japanese supremacy by claiming that the Japanese represented a combination of all East Asian peoples and cultures, emphasizing heterogeneous traits. Imperial Japanese propaganda started to place an emphasis on the ideas of racial purity and the supremacy of the Yamato race when the Second Sino-Japanese War intensified. Fuelled by the ideology of racial supremacy, racial purity, and national unity between 1868 and 1945, the Meiji and Imperial Japanese government carefully identified and forcefully assimilated marginalized populations, which included Okinawans, the Ainu, and other underrepresented non-Yamato groups, imposing assimilation programs in language, culture and religion.

According to Aya Fujiwara, a postdoctoral Fellow at McMaster University, in an attempt to have some influence over the Japanese diaspora in Canada, Imperial Japanese authorities used the term Yamato as race propaganda during World War II, saying that: &quot;For Japanese-Canadians in particular, the Emperor was the most natural symbol to promote primordial national sentiment and superiority of the Yamato race — the term that the Japanese used to distinguish themselves from others. This term meant a noble race, the members of which saw themselves as “chosen people.” The modernization of Japan, which began with the Meiji Restoration in 1868, produced a number of historical writings that tried to define the Japanese under the official scheme to create a strong nation. Imported to Canada by Japanese intellectuals, a “common myth of descent” that Japanese people belonged to the noble Yamato race headed by the Emperor since the ancient period was one of the core elements that defined Japanese-Canadian ethno-racial identity in the 1920s and the 1930s. The evolution and survival of an ethnic community, Anthony D. Smith argues, relies on the complicated “belief-system” that creates “a sacred communion of the people” with cultural and historical distinctiveness. During this period, Japanese intellectuals, scholars, and official representatives sought to keep Japanese Canadians within their sphere of influence, thereby reinforcing a transnational myth that would promote Japanese Canadians’ sense of racial pride as God’s chosen people in the world.&quot; 

World War II and Holocaust historian Bryan Mark Rigg noted in 2020 how Yamato master race theory was included in government propaganda and schools in the decades leading up to World War II and how &quot;Gaijin&quot; were regarded in Japan as subhumans. Discrimination also occurred against non-Yamato races in Japan such as the Ainu and Ryūkyū peoples.

===Contemporary usage===
At the end of the World War II, the Japanese government continued to adhere to the notions of racial homogeneity and racial supremacy, with the Yamato race at the top of the racial hierarchy. Japanese propaganda of racial purity returned to post-World War II Japan because of the support of the Allied forces. U.S. policy in Japan terminated the purge of high-ranking war criminals and reinstalled the leaders who were responsible for the creation and manifestation of prewar race propaganda.

In present-day Japan, the term &quot;Yamato minzoku&quot; may be seen as antiquated for connoting racial notions that have been discarded in many circles since Japan&#x27;s surrender in World War II. &quot;Japanese people&quot; or even &quot;Japanese-Japanese&quot; are often used instead, although these terms also have complications owing to their ambiguous blending of notions of ethnicity and nationality.

In present-day Japan statistics only counts their population in terms of nationality, rather than ethnicity, thus the number of ethnic Yamato and their actual population numbers are ambiguous.

== Origin ==
The most well-regarded theory is that present-day Yamato Japanese are descendants from both the Yayoi people and the various local Jōmon people. Japanese people belong to the East Asian lineages D-M55 and O-M175, with a minority belonging to C-M217 and N-M231. The reference population for the Japanese (Yamato) used in Geno 2.0 Next Generation is 89% East Asia, 2% Finland and Northern Siberia, 2% Central Asia, and 7% Southeast Asia &amp; Oceania, making Japanese approximately ~100% East-Eurasian. The Yamato show a close genetic relationship with other modern Northeastern Asians being most similar to Koreans, northern Han Chinese, and other clusters found in the area. Genealogical research has indicated extremely similar genetic profiles between these three East Asian ethnic groups, making them nearly indistinguishable from each other and ancient samples. Yamatos were also found to share high genetic affinity with the ancient (~8,000 BC) sample from Devil&#x27;s Gate Cave in the Amur region of Northeast Asia.

The modern Japanese cluster is said to be the most similar with the Korean one; in a haplotype-based study, the Japanese cluster was found to share 87–94% of its genetic components with the Korean cluster, compared with a Han Chinese result of only 0–8%, a distinct contrast. Moreover, the genetic affinity to the Korean cluster was particularly strong among a cluster hailing from Shimane specifically and Honshu more broadly, but relatively less pronounced, albeit still overwhelming, in the Kyushu clusters. In any case, however, the study clarifies that &quot;the estimate of ancestry profile cannot provide the definitive history of original migration, unless it will be further verified against historical evidence.

The earliest written records about people in Japan are from Chinese sources. These sources spoke about the Wa people, the direct ancestors of the Yamato and other Japonic agriculturalists. The Wa of Na received a golden seal from the Emperor Guangwu of the Eastern Han dynasty. This event was recorded in the &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot; compiled by the Chinese historian Fan Ye in the 5th century AD. The seal itself was discovered in northern Kyūshū in the 18th century. Early Chinese historians described Wa as a land of hundreds of scattered tribal communities. Third-century Chinese sources reported that the Wa/early Yamato lived on raw fish, vegetables, and rice served on bamboo and wooden trays, clapped their hands in worship (something still done in Shinto shrines today), and built earthen-grave mounds. They also maintained vassal-master relations, collected taxes, had provincial granaries and markets, and observed mourning. The &quot;Wei Zhi&quot; (), which is part of the Records of the three Kingdoms, first mentions Yamataikoku and Queen Himiko in the 3rd century. According to the record, Himiko assumed the throne of Wa, as a spiritual leader, after a major civil war. Her younger brother was in charge of the affairs of state, including diplomatic relations with the Chinese court of the Kingdom of Wei. When asked about their origins by the Wei embassy, the people of Wa claimed to be descendants of the people of Wu, a historic figure of the Wu Kingdom around the Yangtze Delta of China, however this is disputed.

Japonic speakers were also present on the southern and central Korean Peninsula. These Peninsular Japonic-speaking agriculturalists were later replaced/assimilated by Koreanic-speakers (from southern Manchuria) likely causing the Yayoi migration and expansion within the Japanese archipelago. Whitman (2012) suggests that the Yayoi agriculturalists are not related to the proto-Koreans but that they were present on the Korean peninsula during the Mumun pottery period. According to him, Japonic arrived in the Korean peninsula around 1500 BC and was brought to the Japanese archipelago by the Yayoi agriculturalists at around 950 BC, during the late Jōmon period. The language family associated with both Mumun and Yayoi culture is Japonic. Koreanic arrived later from Manchuria to the Korean peninsula at around 300 BC and coexisted with the descendants of the Japonic Mumun cultivators (or assimilated them). Both had influence on each other and a later founder effect diminished the internal variety of both language families.

* A genetic study (2019) estimated that the Yamato share more than 90% of their genome with the Yayoi rice agriculturalists and less than 10% with the heterogeneous Jōmon period groups. A later study by Gakuhari et al. 2019 estimates that the Yamato people have between 92% and 96.7% Yayoi rice-agriculturalist ancestry (with the 3.3% to 8% from the heterogeneous Jōmon period tribes) and cluster closely with other Koreans and Han Chinese, but are slightly shifted towards eastern Siberians.

Based on archaeological evidence and the genetic similarity between Yamato and Koreans, the American geographer and historian Jared Diamond said that the Yayoi people, the ancestors of the Yamato people, migrated from the Korean peninsula.

* Watanabe et al. 2021 found that the Jōmon people were a heterogeneous population and that Japanese from different regions had different amounts of Jōmon-derived SNP alleles, ranging from 17.3% to 24% represented by southern Jōmon, and 3.8% to 14.9% represented by northern Jōmon. Southern Jōmon were genetically similar to contemporary East Asians (especially Tujia people, Tibetan people and Miao people), while northern Jōmon had a partial distinct ancestry component, possibly deriving from Paleolithic Siberians, next to an East Asian ancestry component. The Jōmon period population, although heterogeneous, were closest to contemporary East Asians and Native Americans.
A September 2021 study published in the journal &quot;Science Advance&quot;s found that the people of Japan bore genetic signatures from three ancient populations rather than just two as previously thought, founding the newly coined &quot;Kofun strand&quot; and the new &quot;Tripartite ancestry theory&quot; (replacing the old &quot;Dual ancestry theory&quot;). However, due to inconsistencies and lack of genealogical samples, the relatively recent strand is frequently debated among researchers and is widely rejected by Japanese scientists in recent years for being redundant.

* The 2021 study published in the journal Science Advances found that the people of Japan bore genetic signatures from three ancient populations, rather than just two as previously thought. Two of these populations were the Jōmon and the Yayoi. According to the researchers, Japanese people have approximately 13% and 16% genetic ancestry from these two groups, respectively. The remaining 71% of genetic ancestry was found to come from migrants that arrived around 300 AD during the Kofun period, and had genetic makeup mainly resembling the modern Han Chinese population. This migrant group was said to have brought cultural advances and centralised leadership to Japan. According to Shigeki Nakagome, co-leader of the study, &quot;Chinese characters started to be used in this period, such as Chinese characters inscribed on metal implements, for example swords.&quot;

* In a study in 2022 conducted by the University of Xiamen, researchers discovered that despite finding evidence of the Jōmon people on the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago, there were little to no traces left of their genetic impact in their respective people&#x27;s gene pools. According to the study, Ancient Koreans were composed of &quot;Northeast Asian-related ancestry and indigenous Jōmon-related ancestry&quot; where the &quot;Northeast Asian ancestry was suggested to be related to the Neolithic West Liao River farmers in northeast China.&quot; The finding indicated that the &quot;West Liao River-related farmers might have spread the proto-Korean language as their ancestry was found to be predominant in extant Koreans&quot; and these &quot;Proto-Korean groups, in turn, introduced West Liao River-like ancestry into the gene pool of present-day Japan&quot;. These people are thought to have caused the displacement of the indigenous Jōmon people, causing a significant diminishment of Jōmon genomes in the regions. It was deduced that this event (and the populations remaining genetically homogeneous since then) was what caused modern Koreans and Japanese to share the majority of their genetic makeup as the latter group &quot;can be represented as a mixture of Koreans (91%) with a limited genetic heritage from a basal East Asian lineage related to Jōmon (9%).&quot;
* According to Pere Gelabert in a 2022 paper, ancient Koreans of the Three Kingdoms period of Korea coded &quot;Korea TK&quot;, bore close genetic similarity with Kofun period Japanese people. &quot;The eight individuals from the Korean TK period are positioned within the diversity of East Asian individuals, particularly close to present-day Koreans and Japanese, ancient Kofun from Japan, and several Neolithic Koreans.&quot; He indicated that the Kofun strand was already present in the peninsula prior to it being introduced into the archipelago.

* A 2024 study further explained that the Japanese people descended from indigenous Jōmon, East Asian and Northeast Asian clusters. According to the research, Jōmon ancestry is dominant in South of Japan, especially Okinawa (28.5%), followed by Northeast Japan (19%) and West Japan (12%). East Asian ancestry is dominant in West Japan and gradually decreases to the east. In contrast, Northeast Asian ancestry is dominant in Northeast Japan and gradually decreases to the west. These trends explain why variants of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which are associated with hereditary breast cancer, are common in the east and west of Japan respectively. These genes came from Northeast Asian-related Japanese and continental Asians.

* Another 2024 study conducted by a joint research group from the University of Tokyo analyzed the genome of a Yayoi individual and found that it was most similar to Korean populations among non-Japanese groups. The genetic analysis of a Yayoi individual confirmed that the Yayoi people had Korean-related ancestry. The study also used admixture modeling to support a two-way admixture model, concluding that the majority of immigrants to the Japanese Archipelago during the Yayoi and Kofun periods came from the Korean Peninsula.

== Ryukyuan people ==

Major disagreements exists as to whether the Ryukyuans are considered the same as the Yamato, or identified as an independent but related ethnic group, or as a sub-group that constitutes Japanese ethnicity together with the Yamato. Ryukyuans have a distinct culture from the Yamato, with its own cuisine, history, language, religion and traditions.

From the Meiji period—during which the Ryukyuan&#x27;s kingdom was annexed by Japan—and onward, Japanese scholars such as Shinobu Orikuchi and Kunio Yanagita supported the later discredited ideological viewpoint that they were a sub-group of the Yamato people. The Ryukyuans were forcibly assimilated into Japanese (Yamato) people with their ethnic identity, tradition, culture and language suppressed by the Meiji government. Many modern day Japanese people today that colonized the Ryukyu Islands are a mixture of both Yamato and Ryukyuan.

<doc id="907616" wikidata="Q1579465" url="?curid=907616" title="Monofin">
<text>A monofin is a type of swimfin typically used in underwater sports such as finswimming, free-diving and underwater orienteering. It consists of a single or linked surfaces attached to both of the diver&#x27;s feet, emulating the fluke of Cetaceans like whales or porpoises. Even though the diver&#x27;s appearance might be reminiscent of a mermaid or merman, monofin swimming is not the same as mermaiding.

The arrival of the monofin in the early 1970s led to the breaking of all finswimming world records by the end of the decade due to the improved performance possible when used instead of two ordinary swimfins.

== Use ==
To differentiate between the use of monofins and conventional fins, the latter are sometimes referred to as stereo fins or bi-fins.

The monofin swimmer extends arms forward, locking hands together, locking the head between the biceps, in a position known as streamline position. The undulating movement starts in the shoulders, with maximum amplitude towards the hips; the legs almost don&#x27;t bend to transfer the movement to the monofin. This technique is called the dolphin kick.

By slowly oscillating the surface of the monofin when submerged, divers can generate large amounts of thrust even with small or slow movements. This preserves energy which helps when breathholding (apnea).

Monofin kick tempo doesn&#x27;t have to be slow. In 100m surface swimming, tempo is around 2 kicks per second.

Separate from its functional use in swimming or diving, monofins may be used ornamentally, as part of a mermaid costume.

==History==

1949: Kurt Schaefer, who invented an underwater film camera during wartime military service in Italy, designs a pair of homemade swimming fins, which he proceeds to fasten together with straps and cords to create what is probably the world&#x27;s first monofin. The artefact is on display in the Aquazoo-Löbbecke Museum in the German city of Düsseldorf.

1955: On 19 September 1955, Kurt Ristau and Hans Joachim Bergann, who founded the underwater diving equipment manufacturing company Barakuda in the early 1950s in the German city of Hamburg after serving as combat swimmers during World War II, file a patent for a monofin-like device for swimmers incorporating both feet. Although the invention receives German patent 1085798 on 12 January 1961, it never enters the production stage.
1962: On 15 October 1962, James S Christiansen files a patent for a device enabling a pair of swimming fins to be coupled together to reduce fatigue and cramping during prolonged swimming. Although the detachable coupling converting the separate swimming fins into a monofin-like design is granted US patent 3165764A on 19 January 1965, it does not appear to have entered the production stage.

1967: In his review of the range of fins available in France during that year, J. Larue mentions how unnamed experts are experimenting with the use of a single swim fin accommodating both feet of the swimmer, who deploys the butterfly stroke to progress in the water. Although the experiment yields relatively satisfactory results for swimmers, Larue concludes that this fin is unsuitable for divers.

1969: Franco Pavone constructs his &quot;Matrimoniale&quot; monofin in the Italian city of Bologna. After designing a high-speed monofin with a metal-reinforced rubber blade, Boris Porotov (Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic) builds an entire blade out of fibreglass-reinforced plastic.

1970: On 10 December 1970, Spanish underwater diving equipment company Nemrod-Metzeler patents a monofin-like device for swimmers incorporating both feet, but it never enters production.

1971: Nadejda Turukalo (USSR) arrives at European Finswimming Championship (1970, Barcelona, Spain) with a monofin constructed from two titanium branches, joined by a &quot;sail&quot;. She beats all comers. Monofins have been used ever since for finswimming competitions, allowing monofin swimmers to reach speeds of 12 km/h. Traditional monofin 50 m apnea world record is as fast as 13 km/h.

==Construction==
Monofins can be made of glass fiber, carbon fiber, or aluminum, and rubber. The diver&#x27;s muscle power, swimming style, and the type of aquatic activity the monofin is used for determine the choice of size, stiffness, and materials.

Most monofins consist of a single, wide, glass or carbon fiber reinforced composite blade with graded flexibility, attached to the diver by two rubber foot pockets. The leading edge may be thickened and faired. The blade flexibility is generally controlled by tapering the amount of fibre and thickness of the blade to make the trailing edge thinner and more flexible.

<text>Tha Alkaholiks, also known as Tha Liks, is an American hip hop trio from Los Angeles. Since the early 1990s they have produced party music with a hardcore hip hop edge, powered by the beats of DJ and producer E-Swift (he was born Eric Brooks in Columbus, Georgia and grew up in Toledo, Ohio) and the rhymes of J-Ro (born James Robinson in Los Angeles) and Tash (born Rico Smith in Cincinnati, Ohio). 

Though commercial crossover success largely eluded the group, they maintained a dedicated following on the West Coast, throughout the United States, and worldwide. Three songs of Tha Alkaholiks were featured on &quot;Loud Rocks&quot;, a complilation album.

<text>Eugene Harrison Roche (September 22, 1928 – July 28, 2004) was an American actor and the original &quot;Ajax Man&quot; in 1970s television commercials.

==Personal life==
Roche was born and raised in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Mary M. (née Finnegan) and Robert F. Roche, who was at the time serving in the U.S. Navy. He served in the U.S. Army after graduating from high school.

He married Marjory Perkins in 1953. The couple had nine children, including actor Eamonn Roche and Emmy Award-winning writer/producer Sean Roche. They divorced in 1981. Eugene Roche remarried in 1982 and remained married to his second wife, Anntoni C. Roche (née Bratman), until his death in 2004.

==Career==
After playing theater on various stages since 1953, Roche made his Broadway debut in 1961 as a bit player in the play &quot;Blood, Sweat and Stanley Poole&quot; with Darren McGavin and went on to appear in &quot;Mother Courage&quot; with Anne Bancroft in 1963, and in &quot;The White House&quot; with Helen Hayes in 1964. Television comedy became his forte with recurring roles on &quot;Soap&quot;, as Christine Sullivan&#x27;s father on &quot;Night Court&quot;, &quot;Webster&quot;, and Larry Appleton&#x27;s abusive boss on &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;. Roche appeared as Pinky Peterson, one of Archie Bunker&#x27;s buddies, on several episodes of &quot;All in the Family&quot;, in mostly comedic episodes. After a memorable performance as a prisoner of war who meets a shocking and sudden end in the film &quot;Slaughterhouse Five&quot; (1972), he had supporting parts in such feature films as &quot;The Late Show&quot; (1977), &quot;Foul Play&quot; (1978), and &quot;Corvette Summer&quot; (1978).

Roche played dramatic supporting roles as well, often playing deceptively ordinary men who are shown to be capable of ruthlessness, menacing violence or disturbing perversity. In &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, he played a bad cop who attempts to kill Jessica Fletcher, and as a criminal mastermind posing as a Catholic bishop in the film &quot;Foul Play&quot;. He appeared in two episodes of &quot;Kojak&quot;. In 1977, he appeared in &quot;Never Con a Killer&quot; (the pilot episode for &quot;The Feather and Father Gang&quot;). He played alien Jor Brel in an episode of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; titled &quot;Remember&quot;.

He made two appearances on &quot;Airwolf&quot; (once as Senator William Dietz in the pilot episode &quot;Shadow of the Hawke&quot;, and again as Eddie in the episode &quot;Firestorm&quot; in season 2). Roche appeared in five episodes of &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; as Luther Gillis, an old style private eye. He is remembered for his recurring role as the Ajax Dishwasher in a series of television commercials and print advertisements.

He also made a guest appearance in the &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids: The TV Show&quot; as Grandpa Murdock in the first episode, in which he swallowed everyone by accident.

==Death==
Roche died on July 28, 2004, aged 75, at a hospital in Encino, California, from a heart attack.

<text>Yoxford is a village in East Suffolk, England, close to the Heritage Coast, Minsmere Reserve (RSPB), Aldeburgh and Southwold. It is known for its antique shops and (as &quot;Loxford&quot;) for providing the setting for a Britten opera.

The name &#x27;Yoxford&#x27; comes from Old English &quot;geoc-ford&quot; meaning &quot;yoke ford&quot;, probably indicating that the ford was wide enough for a yoke of oxen to pass through.

==Location and governance==
Yoxford, some north-east of London and north-east of Ipswich, is surrounded by the parkland of three country houses, in an area known as the Garden of Suffolk. It takes its name from a ford across the nearby River Yox, where oxen could pass. The village includes the junction of the A12 trunk road and the A1120.

Before 1 April 2019, its electoral ward in the Suffolk Coastal district bore the same name, but the village is now within the enlarged ward of Yoxford and Kelsale, in the East Suffolk district. At the 2011 census, the previous ward&#x27;s population was 1901.

==Facilities and sights==
The Church of St Peter has a 15th-century Perpendicular-style exterior, but is mainly Victorian inside. However, it possesses a number of 15th–17th-century monumental brasses, which are displayed on the walls. The finely carved font dates from the early 15th century and the pulpit from the 17th century.

The church parish belongs to the Diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich. Up to about 1830, the village came under the Blything Hundred.
On the edge of the village is Cockfield Hall, once the old home of the Blois family. The village is known for its antique shops. It also has a general store, a restaurant and a village hall.

Benjamin Britten and librettist Eric Crozier are believed to have adapted the name of Yoxford to create the fictional town of Loxford, which provides the setting for Britten&#x27;s opera, &quot;Albert Herring&quot;.

==Education==
Yoxford and Peasenhall Primary School caters for children aged 3–11. The school has an Early Year Centre, purpose-built for pupils aged from 3–6. The school works in partnership with Middleton Primary School in Middleton, Suffolk and Southwold Primary School in Southwold, Suffolk, the three making up Yox Valley Partnership of Schools.

==Hospitality==
Yoxford&#x27;s two pubs are the &quot;Griffin Inn&quot;, a medieval house that reopened in 2013, and &quot;The King&#x27;s Head&quot;. The &quot;Griffin Inn&quot; offers accommodation, as does the 18th-century Satis House. This is sometimes described wrongly as the original for the Satis House in Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. In fact the book describes Restoration House in Rochester, Kent, referred to as &quot;satis&quot; by Queen Elizabeth I of England. Yoxford&#x27;s Satis House was known as plain Yoxford House until well after the novel appeared, as old Ordnance Survey maps confirm.

Every year on the first Sunday after Easter, a competition is held for eating brawn, known locally as pork cheese. A Brawn Queen is picked from the village and her first ceremonial task as Queen is to cut the cheese.

==Public transport==
The village is served by Darsham railway station on the East Suffolk Line, one mile (1.6 km) away. The line offers hourly weekday services (two-hourly on Sundays) between Ipswich, with connections to London, and Lowestoft, with connections to Norwich. It is also served by four weekday buses a day between Aldeburgh and Halesworth and a once-daily Monday-to-Friday service between Leiston and Framlingham. There is also demand-responsive transport for disabled passengers.

<doc id="907625" wikidata="Q1069837" url="?curid=907625" title="Chena River">
<text>The Chena River (; Tanana Athabascan: Ch&#x27;eno&#x27; &quot;river of something (game)&quot;) is a tributary of the Tanana River in the Interior region of the U.S. state of Alaska. It flows generally west from the White Mountains to the Tanana River near the city of Fairbanks, which is built on both sides of the river. The Tanana empties into the long Yukon River.

Named tributaries of the Chena River include the North Fork, South Fork, West Fork, Middle (East) Fork and the Little Chena River. The Chena River State Recreation Area surrounds much of the upper half of the main stem. The Chena River is used for recreational fishing and boating. During the winter months, it is also traveled by snowmachines and mushers (sled dogs).

The Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project dam is about up the Chena River from Fairbanks. The dam was built in response to the 1967 Fairbanks flood, which inundated much of the city. When closed, the dam impounds water and, when the inflow is high enough, diverts it about to the Tanana River near North Pole, upstream of Fairbanks and the natural mouth of the Chena.

==Fish==
The Chena River supports populations of many fish species, including Arctic grayling, burbot, chum salmon, humpback whitefish, king salmon, least cisco, longnose suckers, northern pike, round whitefish, and sheefish. Easily accessible from Fairbanks, the Chena is the most popular sport-fishing river in interior Alaska.

Overfishing for grayling reduced their number in the Chena to &quot;dangerous levels&quot; by the mid-1980s. In the 21st century, sport fishing for grayling, which grow in length to in the upper river, is limited to catch and release.

==Boating==
Easy access to the river from Chena Hot Springs Road, the Chena River Recreation Area, four bridges, and elsewhere make a wide variety of float trips possible. Most of the river is rated Class I (easy) on the International Scale of River Difficulty; however, the upper reaches along the North Fork near Chena Hot Springs are &quot;extremely swift&quot; with few safe eddies and are rated Class II (medium). High water increases these difficulty ratings.

Dangers on the North Fork include a much narrower channel than that of the main stem, possible logjams, overhanging vegetation, and shallows, any of which may require a portage. Dangers below that include possible overhangs, logjams, and channel braiding. In the early season (June), boaters may encounter ice jams anywhere along the river.

<text>Roger McBride (born December 14, 1968), better known by his stage name King T (formerly known as King Tee), is an American West Coast hip hop rapper from Compton, California. Emerging as one of Compton&#x27;s earliest hip hop artists, he was signed to Capitol Records, where he released his debut album &quot;Act a Fool&quot; in 1988 with the hit singles &quot;Act a Fool,&quot; &quot;Payback&#x27;s A Mutha,&quot; &quot;The Coolest,&quot; and &quot;Bass” [Remix], all of which were considered hip-hop classics. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, he worked primarily with producer DJ Pooh, and was responsible for the rise of Tha Alkaholiks, whom he helped guide into the rap game. King T is also the CEO of his own record label, King T Inc.

==Early life and career==
Roger McBride was born in Compton, California, on December 14, 1968, and has attended high school. He had been around the Los Angeles hip-hop scene for many years alongside Ice-T and Kid Frost and is widely considered a pioneer in the genre. In 1988, he made his debut with &quot;Act a Fool&quot;, which is considered a classic of West Coast hip-hop.

===Tha Alkaholiks===
During his time with Capitol, T began mentoring a young trio of rappers called Tha Alkaholiks, consisting of Tash, J-Ro and E-Swift. He also helped mentor their loosely affiliated collective, the Likwit Crew. The Likwit Crew also includes others, such as Xzibit, who would later rise to fame and bring King T into the orbit of Compton producer Dr. Dre. Tha Alkaholiks put out their debut album &quot;21 &amp; Over&quot; under King T&#x27;s guidance on Loud Records in 1993.

===The Notorious B.I.G. influence===
T greatly influenced The Notorious B.I.G. with his deep voice, flow and rhyme style, which Biggie would at times imitate on his 1994 album &quot;Ready to Die&quot;. Tee later paid homage to Biggie on the track &quot;6 In&#x27;a Moe&#x27;nin&quot; on his album &quot;The Kingdom Come&quot;, using a similar setup to and vocal samples of Biggie&#x27;s track “Somebody Gotta Die&quot;. In 2010, Ice-T confirmed in an interview that King T was one of Biggie&#x27;s favorite rappers.

==Record deals==
After 1993&#x27;s &quot;Tha Triflin&#x27; Album&quot;, on which T worked with Marley Marl, he left Capitol for MCA and put out &quot;IV Life&quot; in 1994. After leaving MCA as well, he built with Dr. Dre and ended up signing to the producer&#x27;s label, Aftermath Entertainment. However, T only released three songs while on the label: &quot;Str8 Gone&quot; and &quot;Fame”, which appeared on &quot;Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath&quot;, and &quot;Some L.A. Niggaz&quot;, which appeared on &quot;2001&quot;. The two began working on King T&#x27;s Aftermath album, but the project was subject to repeated push-backs. Eventually, King T requested a release from the label.

===Work with Ant Banks===
King T has also worked extensively with Oakland rapper and producer Ant Banks. He first appeared on Banks&#x27; 1997 compilation &quot;Big Thangs&quot;, on the song &quot;West Riden&quot;. In 2000 he was featured on &quot;Lead the Way&quot;, an album by Banks&#x27; supergroup T.W.D.Y., on the song &quot;No Win Situation&quot;.

===San Andreas: The Original Mixtape===
&quot;San Andreas: The Original Mixtape&quot; is the debut album by American West Coast rapper Young Maylay, released July 5, 2005. King T co-wrote and produced most of the songs on the album. He made appearances and some productions on songs &quot;Liq Hittaz&quot;, &quot;That’s Real&quot;, “Inna Ghetto&quot;, “Boss Up Freestyle&quot;, “Twist A Corner&quot;, “Salute&#x27;n G&#x27;z&quot;, and &quot;Speak On It&quot;. The album was released by Maylay&#x27;s record label, Maylaynium Musiq.

===Releases===
In 2002, King T independently released his Aftermath album, &quot;The Kingdom Come&quot;, produced by Dr. Dre and DJ Battlecat. He also released &quot;The Ruthless Chronicles&quot; in 2004, which had songwriting by T&#x27;s protégé Young Maylay and featured some of the songs heard on &quot;The Kingdom Come&quot;, as well as others produced by DJ Quik. King T also guested on DJ Muggs&#x27; &quot;Soul Assassins II&quot; album.

King T was mentioned on Nas&#x27; song “Where Are They Now?&quot; in 2006, and in 2007 appeared on the song&#x27;s West Coast remix, along with Kam, Ice-T, Candyman, Threat, and The Conscious Daughters, MC Breeze of LA Posse, and the Seattle-based artist Sir Mix-A-Lot. After this appearance, King T put out a mixtape called &quot;Boss Up, Vol. 1&quot; with music by Snoop Dogg, The Game, J-Ro, and several other West Coast artists. In 2006, he made a guest appearance on the song &quot;Poppin&#x27; Off&quot; from Xzibit&#x27;s album &quot;Full Circle&quot;. He has also started his own label, though no artists are yet signed to it.

A remix of King T&#x27;s song &quot;Money&quot; appeared on Dr. Dre&#x27;s son Hood Surgeon&#x27;s &quot;The Autopsy Mixtape&quot;. The song was renamed &quot;Fast Money&quot; and features King T and Dr. Dre. The original song was on &quot;The Kingdom Come&quot;.

==Personal life==
His daughter, Heaven, died at the age of 16 after a car accident on May 19, 2009.

==Current events==
King T is currently signed to Table Records Music Distribution.

In early 2013, King T announced he wants to record his final album. He stated that working on Xzibit&#x27;s song &quot;Louis XIII&quot; motivated him to record his last album.

==Legacy==
King Tee (later known as King T), one of the West Coast&#x27;s pioneering rappers, released a few major-label albums in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Though the Compton rapper enjoyed little commercial success, he is often cited as an influence upon the gangsta rappers of the early to mid-1990s. He notably collaborated with a pair of premier West Coast rap producers, DJ Pooh and E-Swift, who were largely unknown at the time. In later years, King T resurfaced from time to time; for instance, he was featured on Dr. Dre&#x27;s as &quot;2001&quot; and released some independent albums of his own, including &quot;The Kingdom Come&quot;.

<text>Krzysztof Jerzy Wielicki (; born 5 January 1950) is a Polish mountaineer, regarded as one of the greatest Polish climbers in history. He is the 5th man to climb all fourteen eight-thousanders and the first ever to climb Mount Everest, Kangchenjunga, and Lhotse in winter. He is a member of The Explorers Club.

==Life==
He was born on 5 January 1950 in Szklarka Przygodzicka, Greater Poland. He graduated from the Wrocław University of Science and Technology (WUST) where he studied electronics. He chaired the Tourism Committee in the Polish Students&#x27; Association at the Faculty of Electronics at the WUST. He started climbing in Sokoliki in May 1970. In 1972, he participated in his first climbing course and a winter camp led by Wanda Rutkiewicz.

In 1973, he achieved first major international climbing successes during a camp in the Dolomites. Together with Bogdan Nowaczyk, he became the first climber to complete within one day the Via Italiano-Francese on Punta Civetta. He later travelled to climb in the Caucasus Mountains, Hindu Kush and Pamir Mountains.

On 17 February 1980, as a member of Polish national expedition led by Andrzej Zawada, Wielicki and Leszek Cichy reached the summit of Everest and, in doing so, they became the first to climb an eight-thousander in the winter. He was also the first to make successful winter ascents of Mount Everest, Kangchenjunga, and Lhotse, three out of four highest mountains in the world.

He climbed Broad Peak during a solo expedition and made the first ever ascent of an eight-thousander from a base within 24 hours. He climbed Dhaulagiri and Shishapangma alone establishing new routes. He also made a solo ascent of Gasherbrum II and Nanga Parbat, a feat that was only witnessed by a few Pakistani shepherds. He participated in a number of expeditions on K2. In 1996, he made an ascent of the mountain along the north pillar together with two Italian climbers.

He organized the 2002-2003 Polish winter expedition on K2, which failed to reach the summit. He made another attempt to climb an eight-thousander in the winter by organizing an expedition on Nanga Parbat (2006-2007) but was forced to turn back due to adverse weather conditions. In 2013, he led an expedition to climb Broad Peak in the winter. On 5 March, Adam Bielecki, , Maciej Berbeka and reached the summit for the first time in history during winter (Berbeka and Kowalski died while descending from the mountain). In 2018, he led another unsuccessful expedition to reach the summit of K2 in the winter.

In January 2022, he released his autobiography entitled &quot;Solo. Moje samotne wspinaczki&quot; (Solo. My Solitary Climbs) which &quot;delves into the climber’s circumstances, emotions and motivations that led him to undertake each of his solitary ascents&quot;.

==Recognition==
In 2001, he received the Lowell Thomas Award conferred by The Explorers Club. He was awarded the Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta in 2003, for his outstanding achievements in alpinism and for popularizing the sport of climbing. In 2015, he was awarded Wrocław University of Science and Technology Medal for his achievements in alpinism.

In 2017, the International Astronomical Union approved the name of asteroid discovered by Vincenzo Silvano Casulli as 173094 Wielicki in honour of the Polish climber.

In 2018, he received jointly with Reinhold Messner the Princess of Asturias Award in the category of Sports. The 2019 Piolet d&#x27;Or was awarded in September 2019 to Wielicki as the 11th Lifetime Achievement award.

<doc id="907638" wikidata="Q510769" url="?curid=907638" title="Robert Brown (British actor)">
<text>Robert James Brown (23 July 192111 November 2003) was an English actor, best known for his portrayal of M in the James Bond films from 1983 to 1989, succeeding Bernard Lee, who died in 1981.

Brown made his first appearance as M in &quot;Octopussy&quot; in 1983.

Brown was born in Swanage, Dorset and later died there on November 11, 2003, aged 82. Before appearing in the Bond films, he had a long career as a bit-part actor in films and television. He had a starring role in the 1950s television series &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; where he played Gurth, the faithful companion of Ivanhoe, played by Roger Moore. He had previously made an uncredited appearance as a castle guard in the unrelated 1952 film &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;. He had an uncredited appearance as the galley-master in &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959) and as factory worker Bert Harker in the BBC&#x27;s 1960s soap opera &quot;The Newcomers&quot;. In &quot;One Million Years B.C.&quot; (1966), he played grunting caveman Akhoba, brutal head of the barbaric &quot;Rock tribe&quot;.

Brown first started in the James Bond franchise in the film &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; as Admiral Hargreaves, appearing alongside Bernard Lee. After Lee&#x27;s death in January 1981, Broccoli and the other producers, decided to leave M out of &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; out of respect for Lee and assigned his lines to M&#x27;s Chief of Staff Bill Tanner. In 1983, Brown was hired to portray M on the recommendation of Bond actor Roger Moore, his &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; co-star and the father of Brown&#x27;s goddaughter Deborah. It was never clearly established if Brown was the same M as Lee&#x27;s character, or a different M, perhaps a promoted Hargreaves. In 1995, Brown was succeeded as M by Judi Dench in &quot;GoldenEye.&quot; Brown died from cancer in November 2003.

<text>Shikotan, also known as Shpanberg or Spanberg, is an island in the Kurils administered by the Russian Federation as part of Yuzhno-Kurilsky District of Sakhalin Oblast. It is claimed by Japan as the titular , organized as part of Nemuro Subprefecture of Hokkaido Prefecture. The island&#x27;s primary economic activities are fisheries and fishing, with the principal marine products being cod, crab, and kelp. 

==Names==
The English name &quot;&quot; transcribes both the Japanese name and the Russian name . The Japanese name derives from the Ainu &quot;Sikotan&quot; ( or ). The name combines the Ainu reflexive or embellishing prefix &quot;si-&quot; and the word &quot;kotan&quot; (&quot;settlement, village&quot;), used metonymically in Ainu for each of the islands of the Kurils.

The alternative Russian name &quot;Shpanberg&quot; (), sometimes anglicized as &quot;Spanberg&quot;, honors Martin Spanberg, one of Vitus Bering&#x27;s lieutenants who led three voyages in 1738, 1739, and 1742 that first initiated Russian diplomatic relations with Japan and helped accelerate Russian control of the Kurils.

== Geography ==
The total land area of Shikotan is . The island is hilly, averaging in elevation. The highest elevation is . The shores of the island are very indented and covered with oceanic meadows. The island is formed by the volcanic rock and sandstone of the Upper Cretaceous and Cenozoic periods. There are two extinct volcanoes on Shikotan: Mount Tomari and Mount Notoro. A number of tiny islets and rocks are scattered around the coast of Shikotan. Two larger islands lie off the south coast: Griega island; and Aivazovskogo island which lies in a bay near the western end of the southern coast.

Shikotan&#x27;s vegetation consists mostly of Sakhalin fir, larch, deciduous trees, bamboo underbrush, and juniper brushwood.

There are two villages: Malokurilskoye, formerly ; and Krabozavodskoye, formerly 

== History ==
Russia recognised Japanese sovereignty over the island in the 19th century under Shimoda Treaty. In 1885, Hanasaki District, to which the island belongs, was split off of Nemuro Province and incorporated into Chishima Province.

On 1 September 1945, during the final days of World War II, the island, which had a population of 1,038 at the time, was invaded by 600 Soviet troops during the Soviet invasion of the Kuril Islands. It is one of the islands (along with the Habomai Islands) which the Soviet Union agreed in 1956 to transfer to Japan in the event of a peace treaty between the two countries, but such a peace treaty has never been concluded. During the late 1950s and the 1960s, the Soviet Union fortified the island against a possible seaborne invasion by repurposing old tanks (mainly IS-2 and IS-3 heavy tanks) as coastal artillery, digging them into the ground to serve as fixed gun emplacements.

On 6 November 1958, a magnitude 8.3 to 8.4 earthquake in the Pacific Ocean off Iturup in the Kuril Islands generated a tsunami with a height of up to at Shikotan. A magnitude 8.3 earthquake in the Pacific Ocean just off Shikotan and subsequent tsunami on 4 October 1994 caused major damage on the island&#x27;s coastline. The tsunami had a run-up height of as much as on Shikotan.

== In popular culture ==
The 2014 anime film &quot;Giovanni&#x27;s Island&quot; is a fictionalized account of the fate of Japanese civilians living on Shikotan at the time of the 1945 Soviet occupation.

<text>Vasily Ivanovich Gnedov (), better known by the pen name Vasilisk Gnedov (; 3 March 1890 — November 20, 1978), was one of the most radically experimental poets of Russian Futurism, though not as prolific as his peers.

Gnedov is chiefly known for his &quot;Poem of the End&quot;, which consisted of its title alone on a blank page, and which the poet performed on stage using a silent gesture. The collection from which it came, &quot;Death to Art&quot; (1913), contained fifteen very short poems that gradually reduced in size from one line, to one word, one letter, and ultimately to &quot;Poem of the End&quot;. The poem has been compared to Kazimir Malevich&#x27;s painting &quot;Black Square&quot; (1915), John Cage’s silent composition 4&#x27;33&quot; (1952), and to Minimalism in general.

Although part of the Ego-Futurist group, Gnedov’s poetry was much closer in style to the better-known Hylaea or Cubo-Futurist group, which included Velimir Khlebnikov, Vladimir Mayakovsky, and Aleksei Kruchenykh. His other works were characterised by experimental language (including zaum-like neologisms), the use of colloquial, dialect, and Ukrainian words, and a defiant and strident lyric subject. Numerous incidents reported in the Russian press in 1913–14 earned Gnedov the reputation of being a scandal-monger. However, his stated intent at the time was “to invert and renew literature, to show new paths”.

Illness, military service in World War I, shellshock from fighting in the Revolution, and political repression in the 1930s, virtually silenced him. After his release from Soviet camps in 1956, Gnedov continued to write but was not published again before his death in 1978. Contemporary avant-garde poets such as Serge Segay (who has written about Gnedov and published his work) and Rea Nikonova regard him as an important forerunner of and contributor to Russian Modernism.

<doc id="907648" wikidata="Q4864056" url="?curid=907648" title="Barry Bucknell">
<text>Robert &quot;Barry&quot; Barraby Bucknell (26 January 1912, Hampstead, London – 21 February 2003, St Mawes, Cornwall, aged 91) was an English TV presenter who popularised Do It Yourself (DIY) in the United Kingdom.

Bucknell was educated at the William Ellis School, Camden, and served an apprenticeship with Daimler, after which he joined his father&#x27;s building and electrical firm in St Pancras, London. He was a conscientious objector in the Second World War, working in the National Fire Service in London during the Blitz and later. In the 1950s he served as a Labour Party member of St Pancras Borough Council.

==Home improvement shows==
After his first child was born, Bucknell was asked by a BBC radio producer to give a talk on becoming a parent. It was after this that he was asked to demonstrate home improvements on TV.

===About the Home===
Initially, he was one of a number of experts answering viewers&#x27; questions, but his manner, both magisterial and welcoming, was so much liked he was given his own spot on &quot;About the Home&quot; in 1956, demonstrating tasks such as putting up shelves and making a tool box.

===Barry Bucknell&#x27;s Do It Yourself===
In the late 1950s he began presenting the long running BBC TV series &quot;Barry Bucknell&#x27;s Do It Yourself&quot; which at its peak attracted seven million viewers. The programmes were presented live and, despite rehearsing his projects at home with his wife timing him, occasionally resulted in on-screen mishaps with Bucknell saying &quot;This is how not to do it!&quot;

===Bucknell&#x27;s House===

The 1962 series &quot;Bucknell&#x27;s House&quot; followed a 39-week BBC project renovating a house, bought for £2,250, in Ealing. According to the 2008 Channel 4 programme &quot;How TV Changed Britain&quot; the house was now said to be worth £800,000.

===Other television appearances===

Bucknell appeared in a public information film &quot;Energy Sense is Common Sense&quot; in 1976.

===Criticism===
Bucknell often demonstrated techniques to &#x27;modernise&#x27; older properties, most typically using cheap materials including hardboard and plywood to cover up architectural detail such as period doors and fireplaces, which at that time were considered unfashionable. This earned Bucknell the moniker &#x27;Bodger&#x27; Bucknell. By the 1990s, some critics argued that he was largely responsible for millions of home owners altering their properties to a style that, in turn, is now considered dated again.

==Sailing interest==

From the mid-1960s Bucknell became increasingly involved in sailing and he and Jack Holt designed the popular Mirror Dinghy. He also designed a two-man canoe for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, a catamaran for his wife and himself which he moored next to his house in St Mawes, Cornwall.

<text>Hindeloopen (; ; Hindeloopen Frisian: &quot;Hielpen&quot; ) is an old city on the North of the Netherlands on the IJsselmeer. It lies within the municipality of Súdwest Fryslân. It is famous because of the Hindeloopen art and hindeloopen costume.

Hindeloopen is one of the eleven cities of Friesland. It had a population of around 875 in January 2017.

== History ==
Hindeloopen received city rights in 1225 and in 1368 it became a member of the Hanseatic League. Since the 12th and 13th century, shippers of Hindeloopen undertook journeys to the North and Baltic Sea Coasts. The strong overseas connections with foreign countries and infrequent contact with the hinterland were probably the reasons for the developing of the Hindeloopen language; a mixture of West Frisian, English, Danish, and Norwegian.

The shipping trade brought the population of Hindeloopen a great prosperity. The 17th and 18th century were especially golden times. At that time, the people of Hindeloopen spent a lot of money in Amsterdam on precious fabrics and objects, which were supplied through the Dutch East India Company (VOC). The rich town developed in those days her own costume and a completely individual style with colorful painted walls and furniture.

In the small streets some sea captains’ houses remind of this time of glory. You can see an anchor hanging on the façades of these houses, in those years a sign, that the captain could still accept freight. In summertime when the captain was at sea, the captain&#x27;s wife lived with the children in the so-called “Likhus”. A little house behind the captain&#x27;s house at the waterline.

Before 2011, the city was part of the Nijefurd municipality and before 1984 Hindeloopen was an independent municipality.

==Sights==
In the old center visitors can get a feel for Hindeloopen&#x27;s unique character by wandering through the narrow streets and looking for the typical wooden bridges and characteristic façades. In the Museum Hindeloopen they can become acquainted with the rich maritime history and living culture of Hindeloopen, which manifests itself in the rich Hindeloopen art and in the fine old costumes.

<text>William James Thompson (c. 1830 – 5 December 1891) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Thompson was about 27 years old, and a private in the 1st Battalion, 60th Rifles (King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps), British Army during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place on 9 July 1857 at Delhi, British India 
Thompson was one of five men of the 1/60th elected under Section 13 of the Royal Warrant to receive the Victoria Cross for the Siege of Delhi. Two months later he was badly wounded in the assault on Delhi on 14 September 1857, the opening day of the battle that lasted until 20 September 1857 when the city was cleared of insurgents. His left arm was amputated and he was invalided out of the Army. The citation, published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 20 January 1860, concludes with a commendation for his ‘conspicuous conduct throughout the siege’. The citation does not specify Delhi and some sources have interpreted the siege to be the more famous Siege of Lucknow although Thompson was not at Lucknow. The 1/60th was part of the Siege of Delhi, the other four 1/60th citations do state Delhi and the action saving the life of Captain Wilton on 9 July 1857 occurred at Delhi. Thompson was at Delhi between July and September 1857 by which time he had been severely wounded and saw no further active service.

==Memorials==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Green Jackets (Rifles) Museum in Winchester, England. In December 2009, a memorial plaque to Thompson and two other recipients of the Victoria Cross, John Henry Carless and Charles George Bonner, was unveiled at the Town Hall in Walsall, England.

There is a small memorial plaque in St Peter&#x27;s Church, Yoxall, Staffordshire. It reads:

<text>The Israel Philharmonic Orchestra (abbreviation IPO; Hebrew: התזמורת הפילהרמונית הישראלית, &quot;ha-Tizmoret ha-Filharmonit ha-Yisra&#x27;elit&quot;) is a major Israeli symphony orchestra based in Tel Aviv. Its principal concert venue is Heichal HaTarbut.

==History==
The Israel Philharmonic Orchestra was founded as the Palestine Symphony Orchestra by violinist Bronisław Huberman in 1936, at a time of the dismissal of many Jewish musicians from European orchestras. Its inaugural concert took place in Tel Aviv on December 26, 1936, conducted by Arturo Toscanini. Its first principal conductor was William Steinberg.

Its general manager between 1938 and 1945 was Leo Kestenberg, who, like many of the orchestra members, was a German Jew forced out by the rise of Nazism and the persecution of Jews. During the Second World War, the orchestra performed 140 times before Allied soldiers, including a 1942 performance for soldiers of the Jewish Brigade at El Alamein. At the end of the war, it performed in recently liberated Belgium. In 1948, after the creation of the State of Israel, the orchestra was renamed as the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.

In 1955, the Orchestra played for Pope Pius XII at the Vatican, in appreciation for the assistance the Pope had given to Jewish victims of Nazism during World War Two.

Particular conductors notable in the history of the orchestra have included Leonard Bernstein and Zubin Mehta. Bernstein maintained close ties with the orchestra from 1947, and in 1988, the IPO bestowed on him the title of Laureate Conductor, which he retained until his death in 1990. Mehta became the IPO&#x27;s Music Advisor in 1969. The IPO did not have a formal music director, but instead &quot;music advisors&quot;, until 1977, when Mehta was appointed the IPO&#x27;s first Music Director. In 1981, his title was elevated to Music Director for Life. In December 2016, the Israel Philharmonic announced that Mehta was to conclude his tenure as music director as of October 2019. Principal guest conductors of the orchestra have included Yoel Levi and Gianandrea Noseda.

With Mehta, the IPO made a number of recordings for Decca. With Bernstein, the IPO recorded his own compositions and works of Igor Stravinsky, for Deutsche Grammophon. The IPO also collaborated with Japanese composer Yoko Kanno in the soundtrack of the anime &quot;Macross Plus&quot;.

The initial concerts of the Palestine Orchestra in December 1936, conducted by Toscanini, featured the music of Richard Wagner. However, after the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; pogroms in November 1938, the orchestra has maintained a &quot;de facto&quot; ban on Wagner&#x27;s work, due to that composer&#x27;s antisemitism and the association of his music with Nazi Germany.

The Secretary-General of the orchestra is Avi Shoshani. The IPO has a subscriber base numbering 26,000. Commentators have noted the musically conservative tastes of the subscriber base, although the IPO is dedicated to performing new works by Israeli composers, such as Avner Dorman.

Among the orchestra&#x27;s education initiatives are the Buchmann-Mehta School of Music, a partnership between the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra and Tel Aviv University. Created by Zubin Mehta and philanthropist Josef Buchmann to educate orchestral musicians to supply the artistic future of the IPO and other orchestras, the school is located on the university&#x27;s campus in Tel Aviv and works very closely with the IPO, including orchestral training programs, master classes with IPO guest artists and special concerts at the IPO&#x27;s halls. Several members of the IPO are BMSM alumni, while various IPO musicians serve as BMSM faculty members.

In 2007, Lahav Shani first appeared with the IPO as guest soloist. Starting in October 2013, he appeared as guest conductor with the orchestra each year. In January 2018, the IPO announced the appointment of Shani as its next music director, effective with the 2020-2021 season. In January 2025, the IPO announced the extension of Shani&#x27;s contract as music director to 2032.

==Awards and recognition==
In 1958, the IPO was awarded the Israel Prize, in music, the first time that an organisation received the Prize.

==Music advisors==

== Political controversies ==
The orchestra&#x27;s performance in London at The Proms on September 1, 2011 was disrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters. The radio broadcast was interrupted, but the concert was broadcast again a few days later. The orchestra&#x27;s secretary-general Avi Shoshani declared to London&#x27;s &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper that the orchestra was unlikely to ever perform in the UK again. Nobody was prosecuted for the disruptions, partly because the management of the Royal Albert Hall, where the concert took place, declined to cooperate with a group of Israel-supporting lawyers.

==American Friends of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra==
American Friends of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra (AFIPO) is a non-profit organization dedicated to sustaining the financial future of the Israel Philharmonic. Necessitated by the lack of substantial Israeli government subsidy or endowment for the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, AFIPO&#x27;s purpose was crystallized in 1980 through the joint vision of Fredric R. Mann and Zubin Mehta, who created an endowment fund in the United States to ensure the IPO&#x27;s future. AFIPO seeks to broaden the reach of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra and bring its message through music throughout the world. The monies raised by AFIPO are directed towards a fund which assists with the operational support of the orchestra and its musical education programs throughout Israel. Based in New York, the organization cultivates support for the Orchestra by hosting events and encouraging supporters all over North America to contribute to the Israel Philharmonic, a cultural ambassador of the state of Israel.

<doc id="907671" wikidata="Q3377806" url="?curid=907671" title="Azumi people">
<text>The were a warrior clan and tribe who originated during the Jōmon period in Japan, whose cultures and beliefs are considered to be one of Japan&#x27;s earliest sea religions. Their existence dates back to the early 3rd – 7th centuries, when their extensive knowledge of navigation between waters made them the naval force of Yamato Japan in Kyushu. They originally lived in Northern Kyushu, especially in an area called Chikuzen, now part of modern-day Fukuoka Prefecture. Their knowledge and ability to use tidal changes, weather patterns and star constellations ensured their successful routing and voyaging on the sea during their regular exploration. In essence, the working of Azumi life was centered around their sea God, Watatsumi and their omnipotent deity ‘Isora’, who provided the Azumi people with a strong sense of spiritual guidance throughout their day-to-day life.

== History ==
The Azumi people were a tribe from Northern Kyushu in Southern Japan.

They were the oldest group and leaders of the “Ama”, a group of people who navigated the waters of West Japan (Tsushima), Korea and China. They also performed trade with China and Korea and were responsible for the transport of iron from the Korean Peninsula to Northern Kyushu. According to some historians, the Azumi were &quot;the oldest known maritime force of [Japan&#x27;s] emerging imperial state.&quot;

The Azumi people were extremely skilled seafarers and their extensive knowledge of water currents, tidal changes, weather and star constellations is believed to have been passed down from generation to generation. Their ability to navigate the seas, especially at night, made them useful to the Japanese imperial government during the 3rd to early 5th centuries and they were effectively the naval force of Yamato Japan. With the new responsibility and accountability accorded to them, the Azumi people became the biggest influence in controlling the various Inland Sea routes to Kyushu along the Inland Coast. In this role, it was the Grand General of the naval force who was in charge of protecting these seas.

Azumi no Hirafu, a member of the Azumi tribe, was appointed this role as Grand General when the emperor sighted him along with a group of men swimming toward their boat on the Inland Sea. These men wore deer antlers covering their heads, appearing as a close herd of deer on the seas. In the ancient beliefs of Shinto, deer were believed to be spiritual messengers, or specifically ‘Messengers to God’. Today in Nara, the modern capital of Japan, this belief and symbolism of the deer has continued, as over one thousand deer freely roam the Kasuga Grand Shrine, remaining intrinsically linked with both the kami revered there and the descendants of the Azumi.

Before voyaging, the Azumi people often performed rituals of sea-worship to the oceanic deities as they believed this assisted them to establish control and territory in various regions of the sea. However, when they faced defeat at the Bay of Hakunsonko in 633, Azumi no Hirafu, along with other members of the Azumi tribe spread along to the various regions of Japan, with the majority leaving the straits of northern Kyushu. In these voyages, they became involved in other specialities and traditions. One of these roles included preparing and tasting imperial food, otherwise known as “Saba”. Under the Japanese legal system of Ritsuryō, they became affiliated with the department of the Ministry of the Imperial Household responsible for preparing the emperor&#x27;s food, largely because of their historic role of providing seafood to the imperial state. The Azumi became prominently known for specialising in preparing imperial meals later in the clan&#x27;s history as this formed as an additional part of the responsibility that they owed the imperial government.

Although some of the Azumi people stayed and continued the traditional life as sea goers, for those who decided to leave sea life, many ended up on the small island of Shinshu, where they became heavily involved in farming and agriculture. During these times, even though they were no longer seafarers, it is believed that they still maintained their intrinsic connection to their past ancestors through regularly praying to the deity Isora, thankful for the water which flowed from Kamikochi&#x27;s mountains granting them successful crop irrigation.

The Azumi people who did not choose to engage with the farming lifestyle in Shinshu ended up in the Azumi Basin. Here, they formed a small fishing village and developed their language, continuing to practice their core spirituality to the deity Isora. Over time, they became known as “the people who lived at the sea.”

In the late 7th Century, the Azumi people also had a key role in maintaining peace for the Yamato Court&#x27;s maritime and became core allies in warfare. However, this rapport became troubled during the ‘Tenumu Reign’ in 682. Emperor Tenumu invaded South Kyushu, but instead of inflicting war on the Yamato Court, they offered tokens of their gratitude in appreciation of the Azumi people&#x27;s comradery and supposed obedience to them. This gesture confused the Yamato Court, and led them to doubt and question the loyalty of the Azumi People. The ruling dynasty banished the Azumi sometime before the 8th century.

Today, the places to which the Azumi people voyaged to have been named after their presence (Kakojima, Kagoshima, Kashima, Shikashima) and there are still traces of their existence remaining in the areas they commonly voyaged through (Islands of Tsushima Straits, Kyushu, Shikoku, Awaji Islands).

== Origin ==
According to Japanese historians, they were of Austronesian origin, related to the Hayato people. They were in early contact with the Yamato court, providing important maritime trade links to the Japanese capital and influencing the court&#x27;s military and diplomatic efforts at sea. Some Azumi migrated further inland, settling in what is now known as Azumino Valley or Azumi Basin in Nagano prefecture. They also spread toward the imperial center, settling in Settsu province around what is now Osaka. Remnants of Azumi culture are also found on Awaji Island in Hyogo prefecture.

Being a leading tribe during the Yayoi period, the Azumi held the common belief of a deity who would allow for safe navigation of rough seas if prayed to before embarking on a sea journey. This deity, known as ‘Azumi no Isora’ is placed at the centre of the Azumi tradition and is believed to embody the seas which surround Japan.

‘Azumi no Isora’ is also believed to emerge during the Muromachi period, around the same time as three similar Watatsumi deities: Sokotsu, Uwatsu and Ojin. These three deities, once representing the seas that surround Japan, were said to infuse into a single being known as Isora. The spirit of Isora is represented as a seahorse, and is considered a symbol of purity, providing spiritual guidance to the Azumi people throughout their day-to-day life.

Additionally, Azumi no Isora is suggested to be the primordial human ancestor as it was him that first performed the dance ritual known as “Sei-no-no” (also known as Seino and Kuwashi-O). The dance was believed to be performed in two parts with a dialogue intermission in between, spoken by two characters: the deity Isora and the goddess Toyo. In the dialogue, Isora is described to be an old man with white hair. “Sei-no-no” consists of four male dancers: two with small drums to accompany their movements and two without. All four were described to have a white cloth covering their face, dancing along in the night to the melody of flutes.

This dance has been passed down through Azumi tribe generations as a ritualistic way to explore their connection to Azumi no Isora and express their praise. It was also performed with the shells of sea turtles by the ‘Urabe Diviners’ (the first adherents of Azumi no Isora) as a gateway to determine which days were safe for voyages to sea. Additionally, the Azumi people&#x27;s kinship to the Urabe Diviners and their history is symbolised by three deity stones in the shape of a sea turtle.

Today, there are multiple shrines which are dedicated to the Azumi People. There is one in Genkai Bay on Shikanoshima Island dedicated to Azumi no Isora which contains sacred stones to represent the sea turtles, as well as over a thousand deer antlers to maintain their relationship with the deities. There is another on the north side of Japan known as the Hodaka shrine. This ritualistic shrine is thought to be a ‘mini-museum’, solely dedicated to preserving the rich culture and history of the Azumi People.

== Folklore ==
When the Azumi migrated to and established themselves in the Azumi Basin around 1000 years ago, the first folklore about them was recorded. It was here where the Azumi people made up legends to warn their children of the dangers associated with wandering near the water, telling stories of a golden koi fish leaping from the water to snatch children away if they were near a river or shore alone.

An origin folktale exploring the emergence of the Azumi people and their ancestor-deities is known as “The Pyroclastic Birth of Takemikatsuchi”. This follows the story of Izanami and Izanagi; sacred deities of the Shinto religion. They were believed to be the divine beings who created the universe and formed the Island of Japan by churning it with their adorned spear.

However, their initial attempt at creating life was unsuccessful, with Izanami birthing a leech. It was believed to result from her disobedience in following the Japanese social construct of a woman – she initiated the sexual intercourse, a role assumed to be dominated by men. Although they eventually achieve success with their creation – birthing the Eight Islands of Japan and creating kami – their attempts lead to other unfortunate events, including the death of Izanami. This angers Izanagi to commit various tainted acts becoming decayed and polluted within himself.

Eventually, Izanagi chooses to repent and attempts to clean and purify himself of the stain. This is when the kami of the Watatsumi and Sumiyoshi appeared. These two kami are extremely important as they are believed to be the ancestors-deities of the Azumi tribe, playing a vital role in their emergence. Additionally, these two kami, along with Isora became known to be worshipped by the Azumi people as they were associated with skill, strategy, and seafaring.

Another folktale included the powers of their divine deity ‘Isora’. The Azumi generations detail the creation story of Isora and how his once hidden jewels located in a dragon palace on the seafloor were said to control the tides and weather patterns. They believed that the king dragon which resided in the palace did not show himself due to his ugly outward appearance; his body covered with abalone, barnacles and shellfish. However, it is suggested that the ‘&quot;kagura’&quot; dance possessed the ability to lure out the dragon, leading the Azumi people to his endless supply of ‘treasure’: divine knowledge of the sea. ‘&quot;Kagura’&quot; directly translates to ‘god-performance’ is linked closely with the religion of Shinto. It is suggested that &quot;‘kagura’&quot; was similar, if not identical to the “Sei-no-no” dance, and has been passed down and carried through the many generations. Now, it involves a masked theatrical re-enactment of Japanese history, where the performers retell the origin stories of Shinto.

Today, shrines such as the Shikaumi-jinja Shrine Okitsu-gu on Shinkanoshima Island has become the basis for worshipping Isora as well as the basis for preserving these folktales for future generations.

== Landmarks ==

=== Myojin Pond ===
The Myojin Pond in Kamikochi, Japan attracts both traditional descendants of the Azumi people, as well as tourists. It has a clear, mirror-like reflection, and is classified as one of the most revered places to worship the deities of the Azumi people.

At the Hotaka Shrine in Azumino City, there is an annual festival at which people express their gratitude for the gift of water. In the city, there is a traditional spot in which all three rivers (Azusa, Karasu and Nakabusa), as well as the water from the melted snow of Kamikochi&#x27;s mountains, meet. Kamikochi mountain holds a great significance to the Azumi people as the water which flowed down this mountain was once used to irrigate their crops. Using this water, the people of Japan perform the rituals known as “Omizu-tori” (taking water) and “Omizu-gaeshi” (returning water), whereby the water is deemed to rightfully return to the Myojin Pond. During this celebration, the Azumi People commemorate their direct connection to water and their gratitude for it as it has always assisted them – both in their history as skillful seafarers and crop farmers.

Today, the Myojin Pond accommodates many visitors as the water that lays within is a reminder of the culture, tradition, and history of the Azumi people.

=== Shikaumi Jinja ===
Fukuoka prefecture is home to what is considered the ancestral shrine of the Azumi, Shikaumi Shrine. The shrine is presided over by a priest descended from the Azumi clan, and its biennial &quot;gojinkosai&quot; ceremony is designated an intangible cultural property by the prefecture. The shrine and its rituals make use of a deer motif, common to the historic Azumi people.

<text>Roy Broadbent Fuller CBE (11 February 1912 – 27 September 1991) was an English writer, known mostly as a poet.

He was born at Failsworth, Lancashire to lower-middle-class parents Leopold Charles Fuller and his wife Nellie (1888–1949; née Broadbent), whose father was clerk to a workhouse master. His father, born at Fulham in 1884, was the illegitimate son of Minnie Augusta Fuller (born 1863), daughter of a Soham police constable, Richard Fuller. Orphaned and subsequently raised with his elder sister, Minnie (later Matron of the Manchester Royal Infirmary) at Caithness, Leopold worked his way up to the position of works manager (also later becoming a director) of a rubber-proofing mill at Hollinwood, Greater Manchester, dying in 1920.

Fuller was subsequently raised in Blackpool, Lancashire, and educated at Blackpool High School. Fuller was articled to a solicitor in 1928, in which year his first poem was published in the &quot;Sunday Referee&quot;. After qualifying as a solicitor in 1933, he worked for The Woolwich Equitable Building Society, ending his career as head of the legal department and a director. He served in the Royal Navy from 1941 to 1946.

&quot;Poems&quot; (1939) was his first book of poetry. He also began to write fiction, including crime novels, in the 1950s, and wrote several volumes of memoirs. As a poet he became identified, on stylistic grounds, with The Movement. He was Professor of Poetry at Oxford University from 1968 to 1973. 

He received a C.B.E. and Queen&#x27;s Gold Medal for Poetry in 1970 and the Cholmondeley Award from the Society of Authors in 1980. From 1972 to 1979 he was a member of the Board of Governors of the BBC.

The poet John Fuller is his son. In 1966 Anthony Powell dedicated to Fuller his novel &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Art&quot;, the eighth volume of his masterwork, &quot;A Dance to the Music of Time&quot;.

<text>The 77th Sustainment Brigade is a unit of the United States Army that inherited the lineage of the 77th Infantry Division (&quot;Statue of Liberty&quot;), which served in World War I and World War II. Its headquarters has been at Fort Dix, New Jersey, since its predecessor command, the 77th Regional Readiness Command, was disestablished in 2008 from Fort Totten in Bayside, Queens, New York. Soldiers from the 77th have served in most major conflicts and contingency operations involving the US since World War II.

The division is nicknamed the &quot;Statue of Liberty Division&quot;; the shoulder patch bears the Statue of Liberty in gold on a blue isosceles-trapezoid shape. U.S. Marines on Guam nicknamed them the &quot;77th Marine Division&quot;.

The Clearview Expressway in Queens, New York, is named the &quot;U.S. Army 77th Infantry Division Expressway&quot;, honoring the division and its successor commands.

==World War I==
On 5 August 1917, the War Department constituted the 77th Division, which was to be composed of draftees from New York City and the adjoining counties. The division was organized at Camp Upton in Yaphank, New York, in the central part of Suffolk County, Long Island; the camp is now Brookhaven National Laboratory. On 13 August, the formation of the division headquarters was directed, and on 16 August, Major General J. Franklin Bell assumed command. During the last week of August, organization of the division began around a cadre of officers and men from the Regular Army, Officers Reserve Corps, and National Army officer graduates of the First Officers Training Camp at Plattsburg, New York. On 18 September, the initial draft of 2,000 Selective Service men arrived at Camp Upton, and from 19-24 September, an additional 19,000 arrived. In September, systematic training began. On 31 October, the division numbered about 23,000 men, but during November, many transfers, in spite of a fresh draft of 750 men, reduced the division to less than 18,000. From 5-10 December, the last drafts of 1917 furnished Camp Upton with 8,500 men, and by 31 December, the strength of the 77th Division again reached 23,000. During the winter, fresh drafts were received from Camp Devens, Massachusetts, and other camps, but 4,500 men were transferred from the division during January and February. In March, new arrivals completed the division.

The 77th was the first American division composed of draftees to arrive in France in World War I, landing in April 1918; overall, it was the seventh of 42 divisions to reach the Western Front. The division fought in the Battle of Château-Thierry on 18 July 1918 and later in the Meuse–Argonne offensive, the largest battle in the history of the United States Army, from late September until the Armistice with Germany on November 11, 1918. During its service in France, the 77th Division sustained 10,194 casualties: of these 1,486 men were killed and another 8,708 were wounded.

The division, after serving on occupation duties for the next few months, returned to the United States in April 1919 and was demobilized at Camp Upton later that month.

The 153rd Infantry Brigade consisted of the 305th Infantry Regiment, 306th Infantry Regiment, and 305th Machine Gun Battalion. The brigade was initially commanded by Brigadier General Edmund Wittenmyer.

The 154th Infantry Brigade was composed of the 307th and 308th Infantry Regiments and the 306th Machine Gun Battalion. The brigade&#x27;s inaugural commander was Brigadier General Evan M. Johnson.

While the division had been recruited as a National Army unit from the New York City area, attrition and replacements had complicated the complexion of the unit. For example, the 40th Division had been converted into a &quot;depot division&quot; in August 1918 to equip, train, and forward replacements to other units, and in the process, Company L of the 160th Infantry, part of the California National Guard, had supplied many of its original men to Company K of the 307th Infantry as replacements.

The &quot;Lost Battalion&quot; of World War I fame was composed of six companies of the 308th Infantry Regiment and one from the 307th Infantry Regiment.

==Interwar period==

The 77th Division was reconstituted in the Organized Reserve on 24 June 1921, allotted to the Second Corps Area, and assigned to the XII Corps. The division was further allotted to the southeastern portion of the state of New York, primarily the metropolitan area of New York City and Long Island, as its home area. The division headquarters was organized on 1 July 1921 at the Army Building, 39 Whitehall Street in Manhattan, relocated in 1933 to the Federal Office Building at 641 Washington Street, and remained there until activated for World War II. The initial formation of the division began with a rush, and by July 1923, the “Statue of Liberty” Division was up to full strength in its complement of officers as required by its peacetime tables of organization and was the first Reserve division to do so. Many of its officers were Great War veterans of the division, and so there was a direct tie to the World War I organization, which established an esprit de corps equaled by few other Organized Reserve divisions during the period between the world wars. Lieutenant Colonel Charles W. Whittlesey, the commander of the famous “Lost Battalion” during World War I, was instrumental in the initial recruiting efforts to get the division up to strength in the early 1920s. The division established a clubhouse at 27 West 25th Street in Manhattan which added to the camaraderie. Over a number of years, most units of the division had bronze plaques cast and inscribed with the names of their war dead mounted in the sitting areas of the club. Some 300 officers and men of the division participated annually in the Army Day parade and over 550 participated in the homecoming parade for Charles Lindbergh on 13 June 1927. All of these served to increase the esprit and camaraderie of the Statue of Liberty Division. 

The designated mobilization and training station for the division was Camp Dix, New Jersey, the location where much of the 77th’s training activities occurred in the interwar years. The division headquarters generally conducted summer training at Camp Dix, and in 1934 and 1937, conducted major division-level command post exercises (CPXs) there. On a number of occasions, the division headquarters also participated in Second Corps Area or First Army CPXs in conjunction with other Regular Army, National Guard, and Organized Reserve units. These training events gave division staff officers opportunities to practice the roles they would be expected to perform in the event the division was mobilized. The 77th Division headquarters occasionally trained with the staffs of the 1st Division or its subordinate 1st Infantry Brigade at Camp Dix, or sometimes at Fort Slocum, New York. For 1 year, in 1926, the officers of the division headquarters trained with the staff of the New York National Guard&#x27;s 27th Division at Camp Smith, near Peekskill, New York. In 1923, the division officers, with assistance from Colonel Peter E. Traub, the division chief of staff, established Camp Blauvelt near Nyack, New York, for the purposes of providing a small training area for the division. Camp Blauvelt was frequently used for unpaid weekend or two-week inactive duty “contact camps” by subordinate units for their officers, and occasionally by the division staff for mini-CPXs. The subordinate infantry regiments of the division generally held their summer training primarily with the units of the 1st Infantry Brigade at Camp Dix, but other units, such as the special troops, artillery, engineers, aviation, medical, and quartermaster, trained at various posts in the Second and Third Corps Areas usually with other units of the 1st Division. For example, the division’s artillery trained with the 7th Field Artillery at Pine Camp, New York; the 302nd Engineer Regiment usually trained with the 1st Engineer Regiment at Fort DuPont, Delaware; the 302nd Medical Regiment trained with the 1st Medical Regiment at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania; and the 302nd Observation Squadron trained with the 5th Observation Squadron at Mitchel Field, New York. In addition to the unit training camps, the infantry regiments of the division rotated responsibility to conduct the infantry Citizens Military Training Camps (CMTC) held at Camp Dix and Plattsburg Barracks each year. The field artillery regiments conducted field artillery CMTC training at Madison Barracks, New York.

Although corps area commanders were nominally in command of the three Organized Reserve divisions in their corps area, with division chiefs of staff handling day-to-day operations, corps area commanders sometimes designated junior Regular Army or Reserve general officers in their corps areas to serve as Organized Reserve division commanders in addition to their other duties. As of 1937, the 77th Division was commanded by Brigadier General Perry L. Miles, who was concurrently the commander of the 1st Division&#x27;s 2nd Infantry Brigade. Unlike the Regular and Guard units in the Second Corps Area, the 77th Division did not participate in the Second Corps Area maneuvers and the First Army maneuvers of 1935, 1939, and 1940 as an organized unit due to lack of enlisted personnel and equipment. Instead, the officers and a number of the enlisted reservists were assigned to Regular and Guard units to fill vacant slots and bring the units up to war strength for the exercises. Additionally, some were assigned duties as umpires or as support personnel. Due to the mobilization of many Organized Reserve officers beginning in 1939 for assignment to other units, all officers less those in the infantry and field artillery were relieved from their divisional assignments in July 1941 and assigned to branch pools instead.

Before Organized Reserve infantry divisions were ordered into active military service, they were reorganized on paper as &quot;triangular&quot; divisions under the 1940 tables of organization. The headquarters companies of the two infantry brigades were consolidated into the division&#x27;s cavalry reconnaissance troop, and one infantry regiment was removed by inactivation. The field artillery brigade headquarters and headquarters battery became the headquarters and headquarters battery of the division artillery. Its three field artillery regiments were reorganized into four battalions; one battalion was taken from each of the two 75 mm gun regiments to form two 105 mm howitzer battalions, the brigade&#x27;s ammunition train was reorganized as the third 105 mm howitzer battalion, and the 155 mm howitzer battalion was formed from the 155 mm howitzer regiment. The engineer, medical, and quartermaster regiments were reorganized into battalions. In 1942, divisional quartermaster battalions were split into ordnance light maintenance companies and quartermaster companies, and the division&#x27;s headquarters and military police company, which had previously been a combined unit, was split.

The 77th Infantry Division was ordered into active military service on 25 March 1942 around a cadre of officers and men mostly drawn from the 8th and 30th Infantry Divisions. The initial enlisted fillers came from the northeastern United States, sent from Fort Devens, Fort Dix, Camp Upton, Fort Niagara, New York, and Fort George G. Meade, Maryland. After basic and advanced training, the division participated in the Third Army Louisiana No. 1 Maneuvers from 1 February to 28 March 1943. The 77th Infantry Division moved to Hawaii, 31 March 1944, and continued training in amphibious landings and jungle warfare. Elements began to leave Hawaii, 1 July 1944, for the amphibious assault on Guam. Attached to III Amphibious Force, the 77th made an assault landing on Guam, 21 July 1944. After taking over defense of the beachhead, the division drove north to seize Mount Tenjo and effected junction with the 3rd Marine Division, linking the northern and southern bridgeheads, 23–29 July. It continued to drive north, and dislodged the enemy from positions at Barrigada town and mountain, 4 August, resistance ending on 8 August. With Guam recaptured, the 77th sailed for New Caledonia, but plans were changed en route and it was directed to proceed to Leyte. The division landed on the east coast of Leyte, 23 November 1944, and was attached to XXIV Corps, Sixth Army. After a short period of training and combat patrolling in the corps&#x27; rear, 23 November – 6 December, it landed at Ipil and fought up the east coast of Ormoc Bay to seize Ormoc on 10 December. Attacking north, astride Highway No. 2, the division secured Valencia and the Libungao-Palompon road junction. Mopping up operations continued through January 1945 until 5 February 1945.

The next combat assignment was Okinawa. In late March (26–29), the division made 15 landings, securing Kerama Retto and Keise Shima for the assault on Okinawa. Riding at sea, 1–15 April 1945, it suffered casualties from enemy suicide attacks, and prepared for the assault landing on Ie Shima. On 16 April 1945, the 77th landed on Ie Shima, captured the airfield, and engaged in a bitter fight for &quot;Government House Hill&quot; and &quot;Bloody Ridge.&quot; It was in this operation that Ernie Pyle was killed. On April 25, it left Ie Shima for Okinawa, relieving the 96th Infantry Division on 1 May 1945. Fighting its way slowly against extremely heavy Japanese resistance, the division drove to Shuri in conjunction with the 1st Marine Division, occupying it 29–31 May. In June the division covered the right flank of XXIV Corps and &quot;sealed&quot; Japanese cave positions. In July the division moved to Cebu, Philippine Islands, and prepared for the anticipated invasion of Japan (Operation Downfall). On 6 and 9 August 1945, the U.S. dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, forcing the surrender of Japan and thereby cancelling Operation Downfall. The division landed in Japan in October 1945 for occupation duty, and was inactivated a few months later on 15 March 1946.

===Casualties===

*Total battle casualties: 7,461
*Killed in action: 1,449
*Wounded in action: 5,935
*Missing in action: 76
*Prisoner of war: 27

==21st century==

Five soldiers from the 77th lost their lives at the World Trade Center in the September 11 attacks, while serving in their civilian duties.

The lineage of the 77th Infantry Division is perpetuated today by the 77th Sustainment Brigade, a unit of the Army Reserve, with its headquarters at Fort Dix, N.J. In 2011, the brigade deployed to Iraq in support of Operation New Dawn. The brigade headquarters was stationed in Balad, Iraq and held logistical responsibility for the re-posturing of forces in northern Iraq. The unit&#x27;s motto is &quot;Liberty Warriors&quot;.

<text>Aardenburg is a small city close to the Dutch border with Belgium. It is part of the Sluis Municipality, located in the province of Zeeland in the Netherlands. Its medieval name was Rodenburgh (Red Castle).

In the Sint-Baafskerk, (Saint Bavo&#x27;s Church), Aardenburg houses the most complete example of the &quot;Scheldegotiek&quot;, the characteristic Gothic architecture of the Scheldt. It is also still possible today to see remains of some of the fortifications that used to enclose the city.

==History==
Archeologists have found proof of settlement as early as 4500 BC. The site was a small Roman &quot;vicus&quot;, flourishing in the second and third centuries AD, where the foundations have been uncovered of a small Celto-Roman temple. After the Second World War restorations to damaged buildings uncovered fragments of Roman rooftiles, of which some bear the markings of a Roman military post, as well as black vases and Roman sandals. The most significant find, however, was that of a Roman building with a foundation of 18 by 10 meters. The Roman Castellum was in use from 175 to 270 AD.

On top of the foundations of this Roman building there were the remains of a Medieval building, which was destroyed in 1383 according to later accounts.
Rodenburgh was granted city rights in 1127 and is thus one of the oldest cities in the Netherlands and is the oldest city in Zealand.

On June 25-26 1672 it was the French tried to take over but the citizens resisted bravely

Until January 1, 1995, Aardenburg was a separate municipality. Until January 1, 2003, it was then in the municipality of Sluis-Aardenburg. In 2003 Sluis-Aardenburg and nearby Oostburg were combined into an enlarged Sluis municipality.

Aardenburg was walled at the end of the thirteenth century: the present Kaaipoort at the old town&#x27;s western entrance dates only from the sixteenth century. The name of the gate recalls Aardenburg&#x27;s former harbour, the site of which is now dominated by a bank. The blue banner decorating the Kaaipoort in this picture is a temporary embellishment, celebrating the carnival that precedes Lent.

<text>Biervliet is a small city in the Dutch province of Zeeland. It is a part of the municipality of Terneuzen, and lies about 16 km South of Vlissingen.

Biervliet received city rights in 1183. It was originally a fishing village which specialised in herring. The flood of 1375 resulted in the creation of the former inlet Braakman, and after the St. Elizabeth&#x27;s flood of 1404, Biervliet was on an island. In 1572, it was captured by the Geuzen. From 1619 onwards, the surrounding areas were enclosed with dikes and harbour disappeared in 1866.

The Dutch Reformed Church in Biervliet has a number of intact stained windows dating from 1660 to 1661. The Catholic Our Lady Immaculate Conception church is a three-aisled Gothic Revival church which was built between 1857 and 1858 to replace the medieval Mary church.

Biervliet was home to 1,860 people in 1840. Biervliet used to be an independent municipality. In 1970, it was merged into Terneuzen.

== Notable people ==
It is the home town of William Buckels (or Beuckelszoon), a 14th-century fisherman credit for inventing the process of preparing soused herring known as gibbing.

<doc id="907683" wikidata="Q2701388" url="?curid=907683" title="Phil Plait">
<text>Philip Cary Plait (born September 30, 1964), also known as The Bad Astronomer, is an American astronomer, skeptic, and popular science blogger. Plait has worked as part of the Hubble Space Telescope team, images and spectra of astronomical objects, as well as engaging in public outreach advocacy for NASA missions. He has written three books, &quot;Bad Astronomy&quot;, &quot;Death from the Skies&quot;, and &quot;Under Alien Skies&quot;. He has also appeared in several science documentaries, including &quot;How the Universe Works&quot; on the Discovery Channel. From August 2008 through 2009, he served as president of the James Randi Educational Foundation. Additionally, he wrote and hosted episodes of &quot;Crash Course&quot; Astronomy,&lt;ref name=&quot;Re/code&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which aired its last episode in 2016.

==Early life==

Plait grew up in the Washington, D.C. area. He has said he became interested in astronomy when his father brought home a telescope when Plait was 5 years old or so. According to Plait, he &quot;aimed it at Saturn that night. One look, and that was it. I was hooked.&quot;

==Education and research==

Plait attended the University of Michigan and received his PhD in astronomy at the University of Virginia in 1995 with a thesis on supernova SN 1987A, which he studied with the Supernova Intensive Study (SINS).

During the 1990s, Plait worked with the COBE satellite and later was part of the Hubble Space Telescope team at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, working largely on the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph. In 1995, he published observations of a ring of circumstellar material around SN 1987A, which led to further study of explosion mechanisms in core-collapse supernovae. Plait&#x27;s work with Grady, &quot;et al.&quot; resulted in the presentation of high-resolution images of isolated stellar objects (including AB Aurigae and HD 163296) from the Hubble Space Telescope, among the first of those recorded. These results have been used in further studies into the properties and structure of dim, young, moderate-size stars, called Herbig Ae/Be stars, which also confirmed results observed by Grady, &quot;et al.&quot;

==Public outreach==

After his research contributions, Plait concentrated on educational outreach. He went on to perform web-based public outreach for the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and other NASA-funded missions while at Sonoma State University from 2000 to 2007. In 2001, he coauthored a paper on increasing accessibility of astronomy education resources and programs.

A large proportion of his public outreach occurs online. He established the badastronomy website in 1998 and the corresponding blog in 2005. The website remains archived but is no longer actively maintained, while the blog has continued, through several changes of platform, to the present day.

His first book, &quot;Bad Astronomy: Misconceptions and Misuses Revealed, from Astrology to the Moon Landing &quot;Hoax&quot;&quot;, deals with much the same subject matter as his website. His second book, &quot;Death from the Skies&quot;, describes ways astronomical events could wipe out life on Earth and was released in October 2008.

Plait&#x27;s work has also appeared in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica Yearbook of Science and the Future&quot; and &quot;Astronomy&quot; magazine. He is also a frequent guest on the SETI Institute&#x27;s weekly science radio show &quot;Big Picture Science&quot;.

Plait has contributed to a number of television and cinema productions, either onscreen as host or guest or in an advisory role offscreen. He hosted the three-part documentary series &quot;Phil Plait&#x27;s &quot;Bad Universe&quot;&quot; on the Discovery Channel, which first aired in the United States on August 29, 2010, but was not picked up as a series. He has appeared in numerous science documentaries and programs including &quot;How the Universe Works&quot;. Plait was a science advisor for the 2016 film &quot;Arrival&quot; and the 2017 CBS TV series &quot;Salvation&quot;. He was the head science writer of the 2017 show &quot;Bill Nye Saves the World&quot; on Netflix.

===Scientific skeptical advocacy===

From 2008 to 2009, Plait served as the president of the James Randi Educational Foundation, which promotes scientific skepticism, a position he eventually stepped down from in order to focus on the &quot;Bad Universe&quot; television project. He has also been a regular speaker at widely attended science and skepticism events and conferences, such as The Amazing Meeting (TAM), Northeast Conference on Science and Skepticism (NECSS), and DragonCon. Plait writes and speaks on topics related to scientific skepticism, such as advocating in favor of widespread immunization.

==Personal life==

Plait used to live in Boulder, Colorado with his wife, Marcella Setter, and daughter. In a 2009 interview, Plait stated that his daughter is interested in astronomy and science, as well as anime and manga. Between 2011 and 2018, Setter and Plait ran Science Getaways, a vacation company that provides science-based adventures. As of January 2024, he lives in rural Virginia outside of Charlottesville.

==Internet presence==

===Badastronomy.com===
Plait began publishing explanatory Internet postings on science in 1993. Five years later, Plait established Badastronomy.com with the goal of clearing up what he perceived to be widespread public misconceptions about astronomy and space science in movies, the news, print, and on the Internet, also providing critical analysis of several pseudoscientific theories related to space and astronomy, such as the &quot;Planet X&quot; cataclysm, Richard Hoagland&#x27;s theories, and the Moon landing &quot;hoax&quot;. It received a considerable amount of traffic after Plait criticized a Fox Network special accusing NASA of faking the Apollo missions. Astronomer Michelle Thaller has described Badastronomy.com, as well as Plait&#x27;s book and essays called &quot;Bad Astronomy&quot;, as &quot;a monumental service to the space-science community&quot;.

===Blog===
In 2005, Plait started the Bad Astronomy blog. In July 2008, it moved to a new host, &quot;Discover Magazine&quot;. While it is primarily an astronomy blog, Plait also posts about skepticism, pseudoscience, and antiscience topics, with occasional personal and political posts. On November 12, 2012, the Bad Astronomy blog moved to &quot;Slate magazine&quot;. Plait told Richard Saunders in an interview that &quot;they [Slate] are very supportive... a new community.&quot; Revisiting old posts, Plait stated, &quot;I&#x27;ve written about everything, when you&#x27;ve written 7,000 blog posts you&#x27;ve pretty much written about every topic in astronomy.&quot;

On February 1, 2017, the Bad Astronomy blog moved to SyfyWire, where it was hosted until October 2022. His blog was then hosted by Substack, and since early 2024, on beehiiv.com.

<text>The 81st Readiness Division (&quot;Wildcat&quot;) was a formation of the United States Army originally organized as the 81st Infantry Division during World War I. After World War I, the 81st Division was allotted to the Organized Reserve as a &quot;skeletonized&quot; cadre division. In 1942, the division was reactivated and reorganized as the 81st Infantry Division and served in the Pacific during World War II. After World War II, the 81st Infantry Division was allotted to the Organized Reserve (known as the United States Army Reserve after 1952) as a Class C cadre division, and stationed at Atlanta, Georgia. The 81st Infantry Division saw no active service during the Cold War and was inactivated in 1965. 

In 1967 the division&#x27;s shoulder sleeve insignia was reactivated for use by the 81st Army Reserve Command (81st ARCOM). From 1967 to 1995, the 81st ARCOM was headquartered in East Point, Georgia, commanded and controlled Army Reserve units in Georgia, South Carolina, Puerto Rico and portions of North Carolina, Florida and Alabama. During that time, the 81st ARCOM was responsible for deploying US Army Reserve units to Vietnam, Southwest Asia, and the Balkans. The 81st was relocated in 1996 to Birmingham, Alabama the first time the Wild Cats returned to Alabama. Since its moblization in 1942 at then Camp Rucker. Upon the relocation, the command was reorganized as the 81st Regional Support Command (RSC) and was responsible command and control of all Army Reserve units in the southeast United States and Puerto Rico. 

In 2003, the 81st RSC was reorganized as the 81st Regional Readiness Command (RRC), but retained essentially the same mission as its predecessor. In September 2008, the 81st RRC was inactivated at Birmingham, Alabama. In its place, a reorganized 81st Regional Support Command (RSC) was activated at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. Unlike its predecessor units, the new 81st RSC had a fundamentally different mission. Gone was the responsibility for hundreds of Troop Program Units (TPU) units and Soldiers. Instead, the 81st RSC provided Base Operations (BASOPS) support to 497 Army Reserve units in nine southeastern states plus Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. By providing essential customer care and services, the 81st RSC was intended to help the supported Operational, Functional and Training (OF&amp;T) commands to focus on their core unit mission and ultimately meet force requirements for global combatant commanders. In 2018, the 81st RSC was provisionally redesignated as the 81st Readiness Division, and designated to gain additional responsibilities from other Army Reserve Functional Commands in addition to the enduring BASOPS mission. 

On 1 October 2018, the 81st RSC was officially reorganized as the 81st Readiness Division (USAR).

==History==

===World War I===
The 81st Division was organized as a division of the United States Army in August 1917 during World War I at Camp Jackson, South Carolina. The division was originally organized with a small cadre of Regular Army, in addition to Officers Reserve Corps and National Army officers, while the soldiers were predominantly Selective Service men drawn from the southeastern states of Florida, North Carolina, and Tennessee. During October 1917, most of the enlisted men were transferred to other units, but additional drafts from Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee replenished the strength of the division. After finishing training, the 81st Division, commanded by Major General Charles Justin Bailey, deployed to Europe, arriving on the Western Front in August 1918. Elements of the 81st Division first saw limited action by defending the St. Dié sector in September and early October. After relief of mission, the 81st Division was attached to the American First Army in preparation for the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. In the last days of World War I, the 81st Division attacked a portion of the German Army&#x27;s defensive line on 9 November 1918, and remained engaged in combat operations until the Armistice with Germany at 1100 hours on 11 November 1918. The division sustained 461 casualties on the last day, 66 of them killed. 

After the cessation of hostilities, the 81st Division remained in France until May 1919; after which the division was shipped back to the United States and inactivated on 11 June 1919.

===Story of the wildcat===
As the fighting divisions of the United States Army organized in 1917, commanders adopted distinctive nicknames and insignia, not only to foster esprit-de-corps within their units, but to help identify unit equipment and baggage. The 81st Division, composed mostly of Southern inductees, first adopted the nickname &quot;Stonewall Division&quot; in honor of Confederate General Thomas &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson. While at Camp Jackson, much of the division training was conducted in the vicinity of Wildcat Creek. Furthermore, some more daring country boys in uniform trapped a Carolina wildcat (presumably a bobcat) near the creek, and adopted the snarling beast as the division mascot. For those reasons, the division adopted a wildcat as their unique insignia. The wildcat proved so popular with the members of the division that the &quot;Stonewall&quot; nickname was quickly supplanted. The cat symbol and the motto &quot;Obedience, Courage, Loyalty&quot; were officially adopted in the War Department General Order #16 of 24 May 1918.

The 81st Division commander, Major General Charles J. Bailey, went a step further in creating a distinctive shoulder patch for his men after seeing similar items in use by Allied troops on the Western Front. General Bailey canvassed his officers for thoughts on a divisional patch. Colonel Frank Halstead, commander of the 321st Infantry Regiment, logically proposed to use a wildcat as a symbol. Sergeant Dan Silverman, a soldier in the headquarters of the 321st Infantry, created several concept sketches for review by General Bailey. One of Silverman&#x27;s sketches which showed a wildcat superimposed on a disk was selected for approval by General Bailey. Out of the concept sketch was created a circular olive drab cloth patch with a wildcat silhouette surrounded by a black border. To further differentiate the elements of the division, specific colors were assigned the subordinate brigades, support trains and separate battalions. For example, the divisional headquarters and headquarters troop adopted a black patch with a yellowish wildcat with the superimposed letters &quot;HQ&quot;. On his own authority, Bailey authorized the creation and wear of the wildcat patches.
The new wildcat insignia not only served as a ready means of identification, but helped to foster unit pride and esprit-de-corps. However, General Bailey quickly found himself in trouble over his unauthorized patch. When the 81st Division arrived in New York City to embark for Europe, the port commander not only ordered the removal of the patches, but cabled the War Department to report the breach of uniform regulations. By the time the War Department replied with orders to remove the patch, the 81st Division had already sailed from New York. Once at sea, General Bailey cheekily ordered his men to restore the wildcat patches to their uniforms.

However, the matter of the wildcat patch was not settled. As the 81st Division was moving into the Vosges sector of France, a War Department telegram arrived from the Adjutant General of the American Expeditionary Forces. The telegram frostily requested General Bailey to &quot;furnish authority, if any, for wearing the &quot;wildcat&quot; in cloth on both the left sleeve and overseas cap...it is gathered that no previous authority was officially given to any organization for this addition to the uniform.&quot; Bailey redoubled his efforts to keep the insignia by sending an indorsement to General General John J. Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Force (A.E.F.), on 4 October 1918 advising that &quot;no official sanction had been given for the wearing of the emblem on the uniform. Bailey continued by explaining in detail the events leading up to the adoption...of the distinguishing symbol in this manner and the advantages of the usage of such as symbol.&quot;

Determined to win the argument, Bailey obtained permission to personally defend his decision to Pershing. As the story goes, Bailey touted the advantages of a shoulder patch in boosting the morale of the soldiers. General Pershing approved the use of the patch, reportedly saying &quot;all right, go ahead and wear it; and see to it that you live up to it.&quot;
Bailey&#x27;s initiative quickly spread among the A.E.F. On 18 October 1918, the commander of the First Army distributed an order from General Pershing that directed each division commander to submit a sleeve insignia design for review and approval. On 19 October, the 81st Division requested confirmation of their existing wildcat design, and received approval from the GHQ on the same day – thus confirming the 81st Division Wildcat patch as the first divisional patch of the Army. In 1922 the War Department approved the final version of the Wildcat patch, a black cat on an olive drab disc within a black circle, a design which has remained the same ever since – with one minor variation. When worn on the Desert Combat Uniform, the patch was tan and brown. In contrast to other Army organizations which displayed a colored patch on the old green dress uniform and a &quot;subdued&quot; patch for the field uniform, the 81st&#x27;s wildcat insignia was the same regardless of uniform type. In 1967, a memo from the Adjutant General of the Army authorized the wearing of the 81st Infantry Division&#x27;s patch by the 81st Army Reserve Command (ARCOM) of the United States Army Reserve. This authorization is extended today to the 81st Readiness Division (RD) currently located at Fort Jackson, South Carolina.

===Interwar period===

Per the National Defense Act of 1920, the 81st Division was reconstituted in the Organized Reserve on 24 June 1921, allotted to the Fourth Corps Area, and assigned to the XIV Corps. The division was further allotted to the states of Tennessee and North Carolina as its home area. The division headquarters was organized on 23 September 1921 at the Arnstein Building in Knoxville, Tennessee, and relocated in 1927 to the L.F.M. Building in Knoxville. It was again relocated in 1933 to the Post Office Building and remained there until activated for World War II. After activation, the division’s recruiting efforts were such that by February 1924, the division was at 100 percent of its authorized strength. To maintain communications with the officers of the division, the division staff published a newsletter, “The Wildcat.” The newsletter informed the division’s members of such things as when and where the inactive training sessions were to be held, what the division’s summer training quotas were, where the camps were to be held, and which units would be assigned to help conduct the Citizens Military Training Camps. The designated mobilization and training station for the division was Camp McClellan, Alabama, also the location where much of the division&#x27;s training activities occurred in the interwar years. The division headquarters usually conducted its summer training there, and on a number of occasions, participated in command post exercises (CPXs). The 81st Division headquarters occasionally trained with the staff of the 8th Infantry Brigade, 4th Division. The infantry regiments of the division held their summer training primarily with the units of the 8th Infantry Brigade. Other units, such as the special troops, artillery, engineers, aviation, medical, and quartermaster, trained at various posts in the Fourth Corps Area usually with the active elements of the 4th Division or other Regular Army units. For example, the division’s artillery trained with the units of the 13th Field Artillery Brigade at Fort Bragg, North Carolina; the 306th Engineer Regiment usually trained with Company A, 4th Engineer Regiment at Fort Benning, Georgia; the 306th Medical Regiment trained at the medical officers&#x27; training camp at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia; and the 306th Observation Squadron trained with air corps units at Maxwell Field, Alabama. In addition to the unit training camps, the infantry regiments of the division rotated responsibility to conduct the CMTC training held at Camp McClellan each year. On a number of occasions, the division participated in Fourth Corps Area or Third Army CPXx in conjunction with other Regular Army, National Guard, and Organized Reserve units. These training events gave division staff officers opportunities to practice the roles they would be expected to perform in the event the division was mobilized. Unlike the Regular and Guard units in the Third Corps Area, the 81st Division did not participate in the Fourth Corps Area maneuvers and the Third Army maneuvers of 1938, 1940, and 1941 as an organized unit due to lack of enlisted personnel and equipment. Instead, the officers and a few enlisted reservists were assigned to Regular and Guard units to fill vacant slots and bring the units up to war strength for the exercises. For the 1938 Third Army maneuver, for example, about 200 of the division’s officers were attached to the 4th Division to allow that unit to function as an almost full-strength division. Additionally, some were assigned duties as umpires or as support personnel.

===World War II===
The 81st Infantry Division was ordered into active military service for World War II in June 1942 at Camp Rucker, Alabama. As in World War I, the division was filled primarily with inducted men. The division trained at locations in Tennessee, Arizona and California before embarking for Hawaii in June 1944. After completion of amphibious and jungle training, the 81st Infantry Division departed for Guadalcanal in August 1944. There the division was attached to the III Marine Amphibious Corps reserve. In September 1944 the 321st and 322nd Infantry Regiment of the 81st Infantry Division performed a combat landing on Angaur Island as part of the operations to secure the Palau Islands chain. After finishing the battle of Angaur, the 81st Infantry Division was ordered to assist the 1st Marine Division in their efforts to seize Peleliu. The 81st Infantry Division eventually relieved the 1st Marine Division, and assumed command of combat operations on Peleliu. The 81st Infantry Division remained engaged in the Battle of Peleliu until the end of organized Japanese resistance on 18 January 1945. In early February 1945, the 81st Infantry Division sailed to New Caledonia to rest and refit. In May 1945, the 81st Infantry Division was deployed to the Philippines to take part in mopping up operations on Leyte Island, and to prepare for the planned invasion of Japan. After the end of World War II, the 81st Infantry Division deployed to Aomori Prefecture in Japan as part of the Allied occupation force. The 81st Infantry Division was inactivated in Japan on 30 January 1946.

===Cold War===

On 10 November 1947, the 81st Infantry Division was reconstituted in the Organized Reserve (known as the United States Army Reserve after 1952) with the division headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. Under War Department guidelines, the 81st was organized as a Class C reserve unit with 60% of the authorized officer cadre, but no authorized enlisted members. In the event of a wartime mobilization, the division would expand to wartime strength with called up reservists and new inductees. However, during the 1950s and 60s, the 81st Infantry Division was not called up for service during the Korean War or Berlin Crisis. As part of the 1962 reorganization of the reserve components initiated by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, the 81st Infantry Division was selected for inactivation, which was completed on 31 December 1965.

Before Organized Reserve infantry divisions were ordered into active military service, they were reorganized on paper as &quot;triangular&quot; divisions under the 1940 tables of organization. The headquarters companies of the two infantry brigades were consolidated into the division&#x27;s cavalry reconnaissance troop, and one infantry regiment was removed by inactivation. The field artillery brigade headquarters and headquarters battery became the headquarters and headquarters battery of the division artillery. Its three field artillery regiments were reorganized into four battalions; one battalion was taken from each of the two 75 mm gun regiments to form two 105 mm howitzer battalions, the brigade&#x27;s ammunition train was reorganized as the third 105 mm howitzer battalion, and the 155 mm howitzer battalion was formed from the 155 mm howitzer regiment. The engineer, medical, and quartermaster regiments were reorganized into battalions. In 1942, divisional quartermaster battalions were split into ordnance light maintenance companies and quartermaster companies, and the division&#x27;s headquarters and military police company, which had previously been a combined unit, was split.

====Combat chronicle====
The 81st Infantry Division landed in Hawaii, 11 June–8 July 1944. The division minus Regimental Combat Team (RCT) 323 invaded Angaur Island in the Palau group, as part of the Palau Islands campaign 17 September, and pushed through to the western shore in a quick movement, cutting the island in half. The enemy was driven into isolated pockets and mopping-up operations began on 20 September. RCT 321, attached to the 1st Marine Division, went into action on Peleliu Island in the Palaus and assisted in splitting defense forces and isolating them in mountainous areas in the central part of the island. The team aided in mopping up Ngesebus Island and capturing Kongauru and Garakayo Islands. RCT 323 under naval task force command occupied the Ulithi atoll, 21–23 September 1944. Elements of the team landed on Ngulu Atoll and destroyed enemy personnel and installations, 16 October, completing the outflanking of the enemy base at Yap. On 18 October, RCT 323 left to rejoin the 81st on Peleliu, which assumed command of all troops on that island and Angaur, 20 October 1944. Resistance was ended on Peleliu, 27 November. Between 4 November 1944 and 1 January 1945, the division seized Pulo Anna Island, Kyangel Atoll, and Pais Island. The 81st left in increments from 1 January to 8 February for New Caledonia for rehabilitation and training. The division arrived in Leyte on 17 May 1945, and after a period of training participated in mopping-up operations in the northwest part of the island, 21 July 1945 to 12 August 1945. After rest and training, the 81st moved to Japan, 18 September, and performed occupation duties in Aomori Prefecture until inactivation.

<doc id="907692" wikidata="Q6318950" url="?curid=907692" title="Juvenile dermatomyositis">
<text>Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IMM) of presumed autoimmune dysfunction resulting in muscle weakness among other complications. It manifests itself in children; it is the pediatric counterpart of dermatomyositis. In JDM, the body&#x27;s immune system attacks blood vessels throughout the body, causing inflammation called vasculitis. In the United States, the incidence rate of JDMS is approximately 2-3 cases per million children per year. The UK incidence is believed to be between 2-3 per million children per year, with some difference between ethnic groups. The sex ratio (Female : Male) is approximately 2:1. Other Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies include; juvenile [[polymyositis]] (PM), which is rare and not as common in children as in adults.

==Signs and symptoms==
The vasculitis caused by JDMS manifests itself predominantly in two ways:

One is a distinctive rash. The rash often affects the face, eyelids, and hands, and sometimes the skin above joints, including the knuckles, knees, elbows, etc. The color of the rash is a pinkish purple, and is called heliotrope (after a flower of the same name with approximately this color). On the hands and face, the rash very closely resembles allergies, eczema, fifth disease, or other more common skin condition, but the heliotrope color is unique to the inflammatory process of JDMS. Some children develop calcinosis, which are calcium deposits under the skin. The rash is the source of the &quot;dermato-&quot; part of the name of the disease.

The second symptom caused by vasculitis is muscle inflammation. This symptom is the source of the &quot;-myositis&quot; part of the name of the disease (&quot;myo&quot; = muscle, &quot;-itis&quot; = inflammation of). Muscle Inflammation causes muscle weakness, which can cause fatigue, clumsiness, not keeping up physically with peers, and eventually inability to perform tasks like climbing stairs, lifting objects, and performing other manual tasks. Other signs may include falling, dysphonia, or dysphagia. The muscle weakness often causes a medical misdiagnosis of muscular dystrophy or other muscle disease. Some patients develop contractures, when the muscle shortens and causes joints to stay bent; exercise, occupational therapy, and physical therapy can prevent this. The muscles first affected tend to be proximal (i.e., neck, shoulders, back, and abdominal). About half of children with JDMS also have pain in their muscles.

Other symptoms may include irritability, weight loss, and mouth ulcers. When a child becomes irritable, fatigued, reluctant to socialize, and the face becomes flushed easily, physicians refer to this constellation of symptoms as &quot;misery.&quot;

===Progression===
The speed of the progression of JDMS is highly variable. Nearly all JDM patients have some skin involvement. The JDMS rash usually occurs as the initial symptom. Sometimes it is so slight as not to be recognized for what it is until muscle symptoms appear. Sometimes muscle symptoms never appear at all or occur very gradually over the course of months, and sometimes going from normal strength to being unable to walk within days. Usually, muscle symptoms appear weeks to months after the onset of the rash.

==Cause==
The underlying cause of JDM is unknown. It most likely has a genetic component, as other autoimmune disease tend to run in the families of patients. The disease is usually triggered by a condition that causes immune system activity that does not stop as it should, but the trigger is almost certainly not the cause in most cases. Common triggers include immunizations, infections, injuries, and sunburn.

==Diagnosis==
Proximal muscle weakness, characteristic skin rash and elevated muscle enzymes are routinely used to identify JDM. Typical magnetic resonance imaging and muscle biopsy changes are considered the next most useful diagnostic criteria, followed by myopathic changes on electromyogram, calcinosis, dysphonia and nailfold capillaroscopy. Other useful criteria include myositis-specific or -related antibodies, nailfold capillaroscopy, factor VIII-related antigen, muscle ultrasound, calcinosis and neopterin.

==Treatment==
Once a diagnosis of JDMS is made, the treatment is often a 3-day course of Intravenous (&quot;pulse&quot;) steroids (methylprednisolone, Solu-Medrol), followed by a high dose of oral prednisone (usually 1–2 mg/kg of body weight) for several weeks. This action usually brings the disease under control, lowering most lab tests to or near normal values. Some minor improvement in muscle symptoms may also be seen in this time, but normally it takes a long time for full muscle strength to be regained.

Once the disease process is under control, oral steroids are tapered gradually to minimize their side effects. Often, steroid-sparing drugs, such as methotrexate (a chemotherapy drug) or other DMARDs, are given to compensate for the reduction in oral steroids. Once the oral steroids are reduced to a less toxic level, the sparing agents can also be gradually withdrawn. Lab results are closely monitored during the tapering process to ensure that the disease does not recur.

In the cases where steroids or second-line drugs are not tolerated or are ineffective, there are other treatments that can be tried. These include other chemotherapy drugs, such as ciclosporin, infliximab, or other DMARDs. Another is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), a blood product that has been shown to be very effective against JDMS.

To treat the skin rash, anti-malarial drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) are usually given. Topical steroid creams (hydrocortisone) may help some patients, and anti-inflammatory creams (such as tacrolimus) are proving to be very effective. Dry skin caused by the rash can be combatted by regular application of sunscreen or any moisturizing cream. Most JDM patients are very sensitive to sun exposure, and sunburn may be a disease activity trigger in some, so daily application of high-SPF sunscreen is often recommended.

== Prognosis ==
Of the children diagnosed with and treated for JDM, about half will recover completely. Close to 30 percent will have weakness after the disease resolves. Most children will go into remission and have their medications eliminated within two years, while others may take longer to respond or have more severe symptoms that take longer to clear up.

A common lasting effect of JDM is childhood arthritis.

<doc id="907694" wikidata="Q621454" url="?curid=907694" title="Epistle to Diognetus">
<text>The Epistle to Diognetus () is an example of Christian apologetics, writings defending Christianity against the charges of its critics. The Greek writer and recipient are not otherwise known. Estimates of dating based on the language and other textual evidence have ranged from AD 130 (which would make it one of the earliest examples of apologetic literature), to the general era of Melito of Sardis, Athenagoras of Athens, and Tatian.

== Author and audience ==
Sometimes the epistle is assigned the title &#x27;Epistle of Mathetes to Diognetus&#x27;. The text itself does not identify the author. The word &quot;mathetes&quot; is the Greek word for &quot;student&quot; or &quot;disciple,&quot; and it appears only once in the text, when the author calls himself a &quot;student of the Apostles&quot; (ἀποστόλων γενομένος μαθητής). Hence it is not a proper name at all, and its use in the title is strictly conventional. The writer, whoever he or she was, sounds to many like a Johannine Christian, inasmuch as he uses the word &quot;Logos&quot; as a substitute for &quot;Christ&quot; or &quot;Jesus.&quot; 

Scholars have suggested individuals who could be the addressee of the Letter to Diognetus, one implausible (one of the emperor Marcus Aurelius&#x27; tutors), the other quite possible (an Alexandrian procurator, Tiberios Claudios Diognetos, c.200). Charles E. Hill cites an inscription from Smyrna, probably from the second century, by ‘Diognetos, son of Apollonius, son of Diognetos, archon’. This is evidence of an aristocratic family in Smyrna during the time of Polycarp, of which at least two members bore the name Diognetos. At least one of these two was a member of the city council, a status that would make the term κράτιστος, used of the addressee of the Letter to Diognetus, very appropriate. It is entirely possible, without verification of the author, that we have a fictitious character, since the name &quot;Diognetus,&quot; means &quot;God-born&quot; in Greek.

== Manuscripts ==
The epistle survived only in one manuscript, initially discovered in 1436 being used as wrapping paper in a fish market. It was part of a 13th-century codex that included writings ascribed to Justin Martyr. The manuscript was mostly intact, exhibiting damage only in one place, several lines in the middle of the text. 

It was first published in 1592, and attributed to Justin Martyr because of the context of its discovery. Unfortunately the original was subsequently destroyed in a fire during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, but numerous transcriptions of the letter survive today. 

Oddly, there is no evidence that any Apostolic Father or Church Father knew of its existence, even though it has been esteemed by many modern readers as a gem of early Christian apologetics. It has been suggested that the Epistle should be identified with the &quot;Apology&quot; of Quadratus of Athens, mentioned by Eusebius in his &quot;Church History&quot;, but this is disputed among scholars (see below).

== Contents ==
The Epistle has twelve chapters:
* Chapter I: Occasion of the Epistle.
* Chapter II: The Vanity of Idols.
* Chapter III: Superstitions of the Jews.
* Chapter IV: The Other Observances of the Jews.
* Chapter V: The Manners of the Christians.
* Chapter VI: The Relation of Christians to the World.
* Chapter VII: The Manifestation of Christ.
* Chapter VIII: The Miserable State of Men Before the Coming of the Word.
* Chapter IX: Why the Son Was Sent So Late.
* Chapter X: The Blessings that Will Flow from Faith.
* Chapter XI: These Things are Worthy to Be Known and Believed.
* Chapter XII: The Importance of Knowledge to True Spiritual Life.

The 10th chapter breaks off in mid thought. When the text resumes, the epistolary style has been abandoned and the final two chapters resemble a peroration. They are often considered to be later additions from the 3rd-century. Some have attributed them to Hippolytus, based on similarities of thought and style. J.B. Lightfoot suggested that the final two chapters may have been written by Pantaenus in the mid-late second century.

== Possible identification ==
In 1947 Paulus Andriessen suggested that the &quot;Epistle to Diognetus&quot; is to be identified with the &quot;Apology&quot; of Quadratus of Athens, mentioned by Eusebius in his &quot;Church History.&quot; Eusebius not only mentions this &quot;Apology&quot;, but also provides a fragment of its contents. This fragment is not present in the text of the &quot;Epistle&quot; which has survived. The manuscript containing this text, however, does not contain the full text but features a gap. In 1966 Edgar J. Goodspeed wrote that the identification of the &quot;Epistle&quot; with the &quot;Apology&quot; mentioned by Eusebius is an ingenious theory. Goodspeed considered it improbable however, also stating that the fragment does not fit the gap. 

More recently, Michael W. Holmes has called Andriessen&#x27;s proposal &quot;intriguing&quot;: while admitting that &quot;Epistle to Diognetus&quot; does not contain the only quotation known from Quadratus&#x27;s work, Holmes defends this identification by noting &quot;there is a gap between 7.6 and 7.7 into which it would fit very well.&quot;

<text>The 83rd Infantry Division (&quot;Thunderbolt&quot;) was a formation of the United States Army in World War I and World War II.

==World War I==
The division was activated in September 1917 at Camp Sherman, Ohio. It was initially made up of enlisted draftees from Ohio and Pennsylvania, with a cadre of Regular Army, Officers Reserve Corps, and National Army officers. Later groups of enlisted men assigned to the division to replace men transferred to other units came from Kentucky, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. The division went overseas in June 1918, and was designated as the 2nd Depot Division. It supplied over 195,000 officers and enlisted men as replacements to other units in France without seeing action as a complete formation. Certain divisional units saw action, such as the 332nd Infantry Regiment, in Italy (Battle of Vittorio Veneto). Its commanders were Maj. Gen. Edwin F. Glenn (25 August 1917), Brig. Gen. Frederick Perkins (13 January 1918), Brig. Gen. Willard A. Holbrook (23 March 1918), and finally Maj. Gen. Edwin F. Glenn (3 April 1918). It was demobilized in October 1919.

==Shoulder patch==
The shoulder sleeve insignia of the 83rd Division consists of overlapped gold letters spelling out the word &quot;O-H-I-O&quot; on a background of a black isosceles triangle. The insignia was selected during World War I because the division originally contained mostly Ohio draftees.

==Interwar period==

The 83rd Division headquarters arrived at the port of Hoboken, New Jersey, aboard the USS George Washington on 21 January 1919 after 8 months of overseas service and was demobilized on 8 October 1919 at Camp Sherman, Ohio. It was reconstituted in the Organized Reserve on 24 June 1921, allotted to the Fifth Corps Area, and assigned to the XV Corps. The division was further allotted to the state of Ohio as its home area. The division headquarters was organized on 27 September 1921 at Columbus Barracks (redesignated Fort Hayes in 1922) in Columbus, Ohio, and remained there until activated for World War II. To maintain communications with the officers of the division, the division staff published the “83rd Division Bulletin,” which was renamed “The Ohioan” by 1926. The newsletter informed the division&#x27;s members of such things as when and where the inactive training sessions were to be held, what the division&#x27;s summer training quotas were, where the camps were to be held, and which units would be assigned to help conduct the Citizens Military Training Camps (CMTC).

The 83rd Division headquarters occasionally trained with the staff of the 5th Division&#x27;s 10th Infantry Brigade at Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana. The subordinate infantry regiments of the division held their summer training primarily with the units of the 10th Infantry Brigade at Camp Knox and Fort Thomas, Kentucky, or Fort Benjamin Harrison. Other units, such as the special troops, artillery, engineers, aviation, medical, and quartermaster, trained at various posts in the Fifth Corps Area, usually with active units of the 5th Division. For example, the division&#x27;s artillery trained with the 5th Division field artillery units stationed at Camp Knox; the 308th Engineer Regiment usually trained at Fort Benjamin Harrison; the 308th Medical Regiment trained at Camp Knox; and the 308th Observation Squadron trained with the 88th Observation Squadron at Wright Field, Ohio. In addition to the unit training camps, the infantry regiments of the division rotated responsibility for conducting the infantry CMTC held at Camp Knox and Fort Thomas each year.

On a number of occasions, the division participated in Fifth Corps Area or Second Army command post exercises (CPXs) in conjunction with other Regular Army units. These training events gave division staff officers opportunities to practice the roles they would be expected to perform in the event the division was mobilized. Unlike the Regular and Guard units in the First Corps Area, the 83rd Division did not participate in the various Fifth Corps Area maneuvers and the Second Army maneuvers of 1936, 1940, and 1941 as an organized unit due to lack of enlisted personnel and equipment. Instead, the officers and a few enlisted reservists were assigned to Regular and Guard units to fill vacant slots and bring the units up to war strength for the exercises. Additionally, some officers were assigned duties as umpires or as support personnel.

Before Organized Reserve infantry divisions were ordered into active military service, they were reorganized on paper as &quot;triangular&quot; divisions under the 1940 Tables Of Organization (TOE). The headquarters companies of the two infantry brigades were consolidated into the division&#x27;s cavalry reconnaissance troop, and one infantry regiment was removed by inactivation. The field artillery brigade headquarters and headquarters battery became the headquarters and headquarters battery of the division artillery. Its three field artillery regiments were reorganized into four battalions; one battalion was taken from each of the two 75 mm gun regiments to form two 105 mm howitzer battalions, the brigade&#x27;s ammunition train was reorganized as the third 105 mm howitzer battalion, and the 155 mm howitzer battalion was formed from the 155 mm howitzer regiment. The engineer, medical, and quartermaster regiments were reorganized into battalions. In 1942, divisional quartermaster battalions were split into ordnance light maintenance companies and quartermaster companies, and the division&#x27;s headquarters and military police company, which had previously been a combined unit, was split.

===Combat chronicle===

The 83rd Infantry Division was ordered into active military service on 15 August 1942 at Camp Atterbury, Indiana. The original officer cadre was a small group of Regular Army officers plus more officers from various National Guard units, while the original enlisted cadre was from the 3rd Cavalry Regiment. The rest of the original officer personnel were chiefly officer candidate school graduates, with a few Reserve officers and transfers from other units, while the bulk of the enlisted personnel were draftees.

The division, commanded by Major General Robert C. Macon, arrived in England on 16 April 1944 with its first divisional headquarters at Keele Hall in Staffordshire. After training in Wales, the division, taking part in the Allied invasion of Normandy, landed at Omaha Beach, 18 June 1944, and entered the hedgerow struggle south of Carentan, 27 June. Taking the offensive, the 83rd reached the St. Lo-Periers Road, 25 July, and advanced against strong opposition as the Normandy Campaign ended.

After a period of training, elements of the division took Châteauneuf-d&#x27;Ille-et-Vilaine, 5 August, and Dinard, 15 August, and approached the heavily fortified area protecting St. Malo. Intense fighting during the Battle of Saint-Malo reduced enemy strong points and a combined attack against the Citadel Fortress of St. Servan caused its surrender, 17 August. While elements moved south to protect the north bank of the Loire River, the main body of the division concentrated south of Rennes for patrolling and reconnaissance activities. Elements reduced the garrison at Ile de Cézembre, which surrendered, 2 September. On 16 September 1944: in the only surrender of a German Major General to U.S. troops, Botho Henning Elster surrendered with 18,850 men and 754 officers at the Loire bridge of Beaugency. The movement into Luxembourg was completed on 25 September. Taking Remich on the 28th and patrolling defensively along the Moselle, the 83d resisted counterattacks and advanced to the Siegfried Line defenses across the Sauer after capturing Grevenmacher and Echternach, 7 October. As the initial movement in operation &quot;Unicorn,&quot; the division took Le Stromberg Hill in the vicinity of Basse Konz against strong opposition, 5 November, and beat off counterattacks.

Moving to the Hurtgen Forest, the 83rd Division thrust forward from Gressenich to the west bank of the Roer. It entered the Battle of the Bulge, 27 December, striking at Rochefort and reducing the enemy salient in a bitter struggle. The division moved back to Belgium and the Netherlands for rehabilitation and training, 22 January 1945. On 1 March, the 83rd Division advanced toward the Rhine in Operation Grenade, and captured Neuss. The west bank of the Rhine from north of Oberkassel to the Erft Canal was cleared and defensive positions established by 2 March and the division renewed its training. The 83rd Division crossed the Rhine south of Wesel, 29 March, and advanced across the Munster Plain to the Weser, crossing it at Bodenwerder. The division crossed the Leine, 8 April, and attacked to the east, pushing over the Harz Mountain region and advancing to the Elbe at Barby. That city was taken on 13 April. The 83rd Division established a bridgehead over the river.

On 11 April 1945 the 83rd Division encountered Langenstein-Zwieberge, a subcamp of the Buchenwald concentration camp.
At the camp, the troops found approximately 1,100 inmates who were malnourished and in extremely poor physical condition. The 83rd Division reported the death rate at the camp had been 500 per month. The prisoners had been forced to work 16-hour days in nearby mines, and were shot if they became too weak to work. After liberation, the death rate continued at approximately 25–50 people per day, due to the severe physical debilitation of the prisoners. To slow the spread of sickness and death, the 83rd Division ordered the local German mayor to supply the camp with food and water, and medical supplies were requisitioned from the U.S. Army&#x27;s 20th Field Hospital. In addition, the 83rd Division recovered documents for use by war crimes investigators.

===The Rag-Tag Circus===
During the rush to the Elbe river, wartime correspondents nicknamed the 83rd &quot;The Rag-Tag Circus&quot; due to its resourceful commander, Major General Robert C. Macon, ordering the supplementing of the division&#x27;s transport with anything that moved, &quot;no questions asked&quot;.

The 83rd moved as fast as an armored task force in an assortment of hurriedly repainted captured German vehicles: Wehrmacht kubelwagens, staff cars, ammunition trucks, Panzers, motor bikes, buses, a concrete mixer, and two fire engines. Every enemy unit or town that surrendered or was captured subscribed its quota of rolling stock for the division, usually at gunpoint. These newly acquired vehicles were quickly painted olive-green and fitted with a U.S. star before joining the 83rd. The division even seized and flew a German Bf 109.

From the air the column bore no resemblance to either an armored or an infantry division. But for a number of U.S. Army trucks interspersed among its columns, it might easily have been mistaken for a German convoy.

<text>Westkapelle (zeelandic: &quot;Weskappel&quot;, locally: &quot;Wasschappell&quot;) is a small city in the municipality of Veere on the island Walcheren, in the province Zeeland of the Netherlands. On 1 January 2021, it had a population of 2,632. Westkapelle is on the westernmost tip of Walcheren and is surrounded by the sea on three sides.

Westkapelle was a separate municipality from 1816 until 1997, when it was merged with Veere.

==Second World War==
On 3 October 1944, the dyke to the south of town was destroyed by British bombersan event still known in Westkapelle simply as &quot;&#x27;t Bombardement&quot; (&quot;the Bombardment&quot;)to flood the German occupation troops in Walcheren and so make liberation easier. 180 inhabitants were killed in the bombing and the village was all but wiped off the face of the earth by the bombs and the incoming sea. On 1 November 1944, during the Battle of the Scheldt British and Norwegian commandos performed an amphibious landing on the northern and southern edges of the gap made in the dyke. During these landings, only six people remained in the village; the rest of the survivors had been evacuated to other villages nearby. It took until 12 October 1945, more than a year later, to finally close the gap in the dyke.

A visible reminder of the Second World War is the brackish lake formed by the inrushing flood when the dike was bombed. An M4 Sherman tank was placed on the dyke as a memorial to the war and to the village&#x27;s liberation. Behind the lighthouse, placed in a semicircle, are the graves of the war dead.

==Two lighthouses==
Westkapelle has two active lighthouses.

The oldest lighthouse, built 1458–1470, tall, visible from and standing prominently at the entrance to the village, is the remainder of a church that burned down in the 18th century. In 1818 the light was added to the top.

The other one, standing on the outer slope of the dyke, was built in 1875 of cast iron, is only tall and has a visibility range of .

Together they form leading lights, that lead vessels coming from the northern part of the North Sea into the narrow and busy shipping lane directly under the south west coast of Walcheren, that brings them into the Scheldt estuary and towards the ports of Flushing, Terneuzen, Ghent (via the Ghent–Terneuzen Canal) and Antwerp.

Confusingly there is a third – inactive – lighthouse on the inner side of the dyke. It is part of the &quot;Dijk- en Oorlogsmuseum&quot; (Dyke and War museum), and never has been active at that place.

==Nicknames==
For a long time, Westkapelle was a very closed community, although this is less so nowadays due to tourism and the so-called import (people who moved to the village from other parts of the Netherlands). This was, and is, obvious from the limited number of surnames in the village; furthermore, because it was customary to name children after their grandparents, (great)uncles and (great)aunts, many people had exactly the same name.

To avoid confusion, nicknames were — and are — used in daily life. These vary enormously, and are sometimes attached to a single person but sometimes also to a family, and often a combination of both. The nickname can be derived from someone&#x27;s real name, refer to one of his or her parents (and sometimes multiple generations back), and/or come from something completely different — again, combinations of these factors are commonplace. Outsiders who are not aware of this custom can experience difficulties because of it, since someone&#x27;s real name is sometimes only barely known: he or she is really only known by the nickname, and remembering the real name is a bit of an effort.

For more official business, the father&#x27;s first initial was often appended following the surname, followed by the letter &quot;z&quot; or &quot;d&quot; (for the Dutch &quot;zoon&quot; or &quot;dochter&quot;, son or daughter): the name Johanna Minderhoud Hd, for example, indicates that she is the daughter of H. Minderhoud (&quot;Hd&quot; is short for &quot;H-sdochter&quot;): see patronymic. This was even used in such things as obituaries.

==Panoramic view==
Westkapelle is surrounded at three sides by sea. Standing on the dyke at the westernmost tip, the 360° panoramic view over the village, the sea and the shipping lane – surprisingly close to the coast – is spectacular.

<text>Domburg is a seaside resort on the North Sea, on the northwest coast of Walcheren in the Dutch province of Zeeland. It is a part of the municipality of Veere, and lies about 11 km northwest of the city of Middelburg, the provincial capital.

==Demographics==
In 2010, the town of Domburg had 1,490 inhabitants, up from 1,251 in 2001. The built-up area of the town was 0.78 km2, and contained 881 residences.

==History==
The area of Domburg has been inhabited since at least 4,000 BCE. In 1647 after heavy storms on the beach of Domburg a sanctuary was discovered with around 40 stones with Latin inscriptions and carvings of several gods, among them of Neptune (sea) and Mercury (trade), but the majority of a local female deity: Nehalennia who appears to have protected both trade and shipping. According to the inscriptions the stones were erected by tradesmen and captains to fulfil their vows after a safe journey, mentioning explicitly on one stone a merchant of pottery doing business with Britain.

From a later period (starting 650 AD) many coins have been found on the beach including Anglo-Saxon sceattas. The settlement on the exact present day location of Domburg however originates from a circular earthen citadel that was discovered according to expectations by archaeologists in 1991 and which was dated to around 875 AD a period shortly after recorded raids by Danes.
In the following centuries there would be considerable activity by monks, not in the least because of salt works and the reclamation of land by which the island of Walcheren was formed. Near Domburg the mediaeval castle of Westhove, now a family hostel, used to be a stronghold of the abbot of the Abbey of Middelburg.

The town of Domburg, actually more a village, surprisingly received a city charter at the early date of 1223. Probably because the counts of Holland had to seek refuge on the island in some neighbourly quarrel. Until the 19th century the town did not change much in its agricultural and (some) fishing character, although tourism started in the 17th century with cityfolk from Middelburg who would enjoy a Sunday trip to the area in summer because of its coast and woodlands and merry inns. Wealth from both West- and East Indian trade also enabled many merchants from Middelburg and Flushing to build manorhouses with lavish gardens in the area, but only a few have survived.

The lordship of Domburg used to belong to the dukes of Burgundy when they were counts of both Holland and Zeeland. For financial reasons they sold Domburg to a lesser branch of their family from which it eventually ended up in the hands of private individuals and passing through the hands of more than one family until lordship rights were completely abolished in 1848. Mostly they were rich merchants from Zeeland cities who returned from India after having served as the director of trade in for example Bengalen.

For a long time Domburg consisted of two jurisdictions: Domburg-Binnen (the town and coast) and Domburg-Buiten (the country side). In 1816 they were united into a single municipality, into which the village of Oostkapelle was merged in 1966. At the end of the last century all the smaller towns of Walcheren were joined to form the municipality of Veere.

Starting 1834 Domburg became a seaside resort offering a bathing cure and facilities. A small &quot;Badpaviljoen&quot; was built shortly after on top of the dunes, which was replaced by a larger one in 1888 which offered space for gentleman playing billiards and ladies drinking tea, a concert room, a seaview veranda and more of such amenities that beach life requires.
Most important for its development was however the arrival of a railway station at Flushing and a connecting steamship service with England. A considerable British influence in these years was responsible for Domburg establishing the second golf-course in the Netherlands, although it never expanded over a friendly nine holes.

Like in so many seaside resorts at the end of the 19th century a flock of European royalty landed at Domburg for a few years when the resort was fashionable only to move along again a few years later. The Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Pommern regularly arrived in the town by private-charter train on Stoomtram Walcheren. Instrumental however in the mythology of the place and the mentioned fashion was the very successful doctor Johann Georg Mezger who achieved international fame for his scientific approach of physiotherapy and for being the founding father of Swedish massage.

Domburg is perhaps best known for its hosting of a group of artists of which Piet Mondriaan or Mondrian is the best known. His &quot;Pier and Ocean&quot; paintings was inspired by the same location where James Abbott McNeill Whistler painted the Domburg sea with its characteristic piers which do not cater for the happy crowd but are meant to break waves that may damage the dunes and thus the existence of the place. This lead Domburg to be a testing ground for Leiden&#x27;s De Stijl movement.

<doc id="907710" wikidata="Q4531026" url="?curid=907710" title="Electron beam computed tomography">
<text>Electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) is a fifth generation computed tomography (CT) scanner in which the X-ray tube is not mechanically spun in order to rotate the source of X-ray photons. This different design was explicitly developed to better image heart structures that never stop moving, performing a complete cycle of movement with each heartbeat. 

As in conventional CT technology, the X-ray source-point moves along a circle in space around an object to be imaged. In EBCT, the X-ray tube itself is large and stationary, and partially surrounds the imaging circle. Rather than moving the tube itself, electron-beam focal point (and hence the X-ray source point) is rapidly swept along a tungsten anode in the tube, tracing a large circular arc on its inner surface.

The vast majority of CT scanners in clinical use are third generation machines.

==Advantages and disadvantages==

The principal application advantage of EBT machines, and the reason for the invention, is that because the X-ray source-point is swept electronically, not mechanically, it can be swept with far greater speed.

The major medical application for which this design technology was invented in the 1980s was for imaging the human heart, specifically to detect coronary calcium. The heart never stops moving, and some important structures, such as arteries, move several times their diameter during each heartbeat. Rapid imaging is therefore important to prevent blurring of moving structures during the scan. EBT detection of calcium deposits is accurate, fast and involves lower exposure to ionising radiation than conventional CT. Patients are exposed to radiation for a shorter period as it is faster in creating multiple images of the heart. The most advanced current commercial designs can perform image sweeps in as little as 0.025 seconds. By comparison, the fastest mechanically swept X-ray tube designs require about 0.25 seconds to perform an image sweep. For reference, current coronary artery angiography imaging is usually performed at 30 frames/second or 0.033 seconds/frame; EBT is far closer to this than mechanically swept CT machines. 

Signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution are also worse compared to conventional CT.

==Design specifics==
Electron beam CT scanners are considered a fifth generation CT scanner, with first generation being the pencil beam with translation and rotation, second generation being a fan beam with similar motion to its predecessor, third generation having both rotating fan beam and detectors and fourth generation being a fan beam with a rotating movement but fixed detector. The vast majority of CT scanners in clinical usage are third-generation scanners.

As in standard X-ray tubes, part of the electron current energy when hitting the tungsten target is converted into photons. However, instead of spinning a small target anode in order to dissipate waste heat, the electron current focal spot is swept along a large stationary target anode.

The electron current sweep is aimed using wound copper coil magnetic deflection yokes, as in a cathode-ray tube (CRT). However, the entire structure of the cathode, deflection yokes, anode and overall vacuum tube size is much larger, therefore made out of steel, not glass, with the main central open midsection of the vacuum tube hollow, leaving room for the scan table and object or person to lie while the scan is performed.

==Future==
This technology is the fastest generation of CT scanner to date. Third-generation spiral CT designs, especially those with 64 detector rows, 3×360°/sec rotation speeds, and designed for cardiac imaging, are largely replacing the EBT design from a commercial and medical perspective. However, electron beam CT still offers sweep speeds of effectively 50×360°/sec rotation speeds and lower radiation exposure.

<text>The Pazyryk culture ( &quot;Pazyrykskaya&quot; kul&#x27;tura) is a Saka (Central Asian Scythian) nomadic Iron Age archaeological culture (6th to 3rd centuries BC) identified by excavated artifacts and mummified humans found in the Siberian permafrost, in the Altay Mountains, Kazakhstan and Mongolia. The mummies are buried in long barrows (or &quot;kurgans&quot;) similar to the tomb mounds of Scythian culture in Ukraine. The type site are the Pazyryk burials of the Ukok Plateau.
Many artifacts and human remains have been found at this location, including the Siberian Ice Princess, indicating a flourishing culture at this location that benefited from the many trade routes and caravans of merchants passing through the area. The Pazyryk are considered to have had a war-like life. The Pazyryk culture was preceded by the &quot;Arzhan culture&quot; (Initial Scythian period, 8th - 7th century BC).

==Archaeology==

Other kurgan cemeteries associated with the culture include those of Bashadar, Tuekta, Ulandryk, Polosmak, or Berel. There are so far no known sites of settlements associated with the burials, suggesting a purely nomadic lifestyle.

Because of a freak climatic freeze, some of the Altai burials, notably those of the 5th century BC at Pazyryk and neighbouring sites, such as Katanda, Shibe, and Tuekta, were isolated from external climatic variations by a protective layer of ice that conserved the organic substances buried in them. At Pazyryk these included the bodies of horses and an embalmed man whose body was covered with tattoos of animal motifs. The remarkable textiles recovered from the Pazyryk burials include the oldest woollen knotted-pile carpet known, the oldest embroidered Chinese silk, and two pieces of woven Persian fabric (State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg). Red and ochre predominate in the carpet, the main design of which is of riders, stags, and griffins. Many of the Pazyryk felt hangings, saddlecloths, and cushions were covered with elaborate designs executed in appliqué feltwork, dyed furs, and embroidery. Of exceptional interest are those with animal and human figural compositions, the most notable of which are the repeat design of an investiture scene on a felt hanging and that of a semihuman, semibird creature on another (both in the State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg). Clothing, whether of felt, leather, or fur, was also lavishly ornamented.

Horse reins either had animal designs cut out on them or were studded with wooden ones covered in gold foil. Their tail sheaths were ornamented, as were their headpieces and breastpieces. Some horses were provided with leather or felt masks made to resemble animals, with stag antlers or rams’ horns often incorporated in them. Many of the trappings took the form of iron, bronze, and gilt wood animal motifs either applied or suspended from them; and bits had animal-shaped terminal ornaments. Altai-Sayan animals frequently display muscles delineated with dot and comma markings, a formal convention that may have derived from appliqué needlework. Such markings are sometimes included in Assyrian, Achaemenian, and even Urartian animal representations of the ancient Middle East. Roundels containing a dot serve the same purpose on the stag and other animal renderings executed by contemporary &quot;Śaka&quot; metalworkers. Animal processions of the Assyro-Achaemenian type also appealed to many Central Asian tribesmen and are featured in their arts.

Certain geometric designs and sun symbols, such as the circle and rosette, recur at Pazyryk but are completely outnumbered by animal motifs. The stag and its relatives figure as prominently as in Altai-Sayan. Combat scenes between carnivores and herbivores are exceedingly numerous in Pazyryk work; the Pazyryk beasts are locked in such bitter fights that the victim&#x27;s hindquarters become inverted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Central-Asian-arts/Visual-arts&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics==

The Pazyryk population is associated with the Eastern Scythian horizon, which emerged out of Western Steppe Herders (WSH or Steppe_MLBA) and local groups of Southern Siberia. Genetic data revealed that the Iron Age Pazyryk people were not identical with the WSH but substantially shifted towards East Eurasians. The eastern Eurasian geneflow can largely be explained through Khövsgöl LBA groups, themselves a combination of primarily Ancient Northeast Asians and components associated with Ancient North Eurasians and the Sintashta culture. Some outlier samples need additional geneflow from an Ancient Northeast Asian source, best represented by Neolithic groups from the Devil’s Gate Cave site in the Russian Far East. The Pazyryk people display genetic affinites to modern Uralic and Paleosiberian peoples, such as the Yukaghirs, Nganasans, Khanty, and Mansi people. The Pazyryk people were later replaced by expanding Xiongnu. Overall, the Pazyryk population could be modeled to derive between c. 50% from the Khövsgöl LBA source, c. 36% from WSH (Steppe_MLBA), and c. 14% from a BMAC-like source. One outlier specimen (Pazyryk_Berel_50BCE) could be modeled as c. 18% Pazyryk_IA and c. 82% additional Northeast Asian admixture, suggesting that this individual represents a migrant who arrived from further East. The same additional Eastern ancestry is found among the later groups of Huns (Hun Berel 300CE, Hun elite 350CE), and the Karakaba remains (830CE).

=== Maternal haplogroups ===

Two individuals were found to belong to the East Eurasian maternal haplogroup C4.

=== Paternal haplogroups ===

Two closely related males from the Pazyryk culture were found to belong to the East Eurasian paternal haplogroup N.

Another Pazyryk specimen was found to belong to the West Eurasian paternal haplogroup R1a-Z93.

<text>The 86th Infantry Division, also known as the Blackhawk Division, was a unit of the United States Army in World War I and World War II.
Currently called the 86th Training Division, based at Fort McCoy, Wisconsin, members of the division now work with Active Army, Reserve, and National Guard units to provide them with a Decisive Action Training Environment on a yearly basis.

==World War I==
The 86th Division was first organized on August 25, 1917, about four months after the American entry into World War I, at Camp Grant, Rockford, Illinois. A small cadre of Regular Army officers and enlisted men, in addition to Officers Reserve Corps and National Army officer graduates of the First Officers Training Camp held at Fort Sheridan, Illinois, staffed the division and coordinated its organization, while the enlisted men were predominantly Selective Service men drawn from the states of Illinois and Wisconsin. The drafted men arrived by the end of September, around which time systematic training began.

In early October 1917, 5,400 men were transferred to the 33rd Division. Between January and August 1918, over 100,000 men were processed at Camp Grant, with 80,000 transferred out of the camp; this included 8,000 to the 33rd Division, 4,500 to the 4th Division, 2,500 to the 85th Division, 1,000 to Camp Johnston, Florida, and large contingents directly to ports of embarkation. The 86th Division subsequently declined to a strength of 10,000 by April 1918, but by August, reached full strength again by new drafts and transfers from Camp Grant&#x27;s depot brigade, many hailing from Illinois and Wisconsin. The division began to depart from the United States in August 1918, with the first elements of the division arriving to reinforce the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) in France in late September, while the last arrived in the first week of October.

The division was sent to the area around Bordeaux, with the division&#x27;s headquarters being established at Saint-André-de-Cubzac. As the AEF&#x27;s Meuse–Argonne offensive, launched in late September, continued to grind on, there was an increasing need for replacements for the heavy casualties the AEF was sustaining in the campaign. This, as well as the shortage of replacements being sent overseas each month, contributed to a decision by General John J. Pershing, Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the AEF, to break up newly arrived divisions, the 86th being one of them, to bring the other severely depleted AEF divisions up to strength. As a result, the 86th Division, in particular its infantry and machine gun units, was ordered to be skeletonized. By November 8 the remnants of the division was ordered to the area around Le Mans. Three days later the Armistice with Germany caused the war to come to an end.

In January 1919 the skeletonized division headquarters, the infantry regiments and the machine gun battalions began returning to the United States, as did the 311th Field Signal Battalion. The 161st Field Artillery Brigade, which upon its arrival in France had moved to the Le Courneau area, returned home in the following weeks, while the 311th Engineer Regiment returned in June.

===Nickname and legacy===
The division was nicknamed the &quot;Black Hawk Division&quot; after the Sauk Chief Black Hawk, who lived in the area of what is now Illinois. Frederic McLaughlin was a commander with the 333rd Machine Gun Battalion of the 86th Infantry Division during World War I. In 1926, McLaughlin was granted a franchise by the National Hockey League, which he named the Chicago Blackhawks after his wartime unit.

==Interwar period==

The 86th Division headquarters arrived at the port of Hoboken, New Jersey, aboard the troopship USS Siboney on 3 January 1919 after 4 months of overseas service and was demobilized on 18 April 1919 at Camp Custer, Michigan. Pursuant to the National Defense Act of 1920, the 86th Division was reconstituted in the Organized Reserve on 24 June 1921, allotted to the Sixth Corps Area, and assigned to the XVI Corps. The division was further allotted to the state of Illinois as its home area. The division headquarters was organized on 10 September 1921 at the Federal Building in Chicago. The headquarters was relocated on 18 October 1921 to the Leiter Building at 14 East Congress Street and remained there until activated for World War II. To maintain communications with the officers of the division, the chief of staff published a newsletter named “The Blackhawk Bulletin” in keeping with the division’s nickname and the military, geographical, and historical background of the region from which it drew its personnel. The newsletter informed the division’s members of such things as when and where the inactive training sessions were to be held, what the division’s summer training quotas were, where the camps were to be held, and which units would be assigned to help conduct the Citizens Military Training Camps (CMTC).

The designated mobilization and training station for the division was Camp Custer, the location where much of the 86th Division’s training activities occurred in the interwar years. The headquarters and staff usually trained with the staff of the 6th Division&#x27;s 12th Infantry Brigade, either at Camp Custer or at Fort Sheridan. The subordinate infantry regiments of the division held their summer training primarily with the 2nd Infantry Regiment at Camp Custer beginning in June 1923. Other units, such as the special troops, artillery, engineers, aviation, medical, and quartermaster, trained at various posts in the Sixth and Seventh Corps Areas. For example, the division’s artillery trained with the 1st Battalion, 14th Field Artillery at Camp Custer; the special troops trained with equivalent elements of the National Guard&#x27;s 32nd Division at Camp Grayling, Michigan, or Camp Sparta (later McCoy), Wisconsin; the 310th Medical Regiment trained at Fort Snelling, Minnesota; and the 310th Observation Squadron trained with the 15th Observation Squadron at Chanute Field, Illinois. In addition to the unit training camps, the infantry regiments of the division rotated responsibility to conduct the CMTC training held at Camp Custer and Fort Sheridan each year.

On a number of occasions, the division participated in Sixth Corps Area or Second Army command post exercises (CPXs) in conjunction with other Regular Army, National Guard, and Organized Reserve units. These training events gave division staff officers’ opportunities to practice the roles they would be expected to perform in the event the division was mobilized. Unlike the Regular and Guard units in the Sixth Corps Area, the 86th Division did not participate in the various Sixth Corps Area maneuvers and the Second Army maneuvers of 1935, 1939, and 1940 as an organized unit due to lack of enlisted personnel and equipment. Instead, the officers and a few enlisted reservists were assigned to Regular and Guard units to fill vacant slots and bring the units up to war strength for the exercises. Additionally, some were assigned duties as umpires or as support personnel.

===Order of battle===

Before Organized Reserve infantry divisions were ordered into active military service, they were reorganized on paper as &quot;triangular&quot; divisions under the 1940 tables of organization. The headquarters companies of the two infantry brigades were consolidated into the division&#x27;s cavalry reconnaissance troop, and one infantry regiment was removed by inactivation. The field artillery brigade headquarters and headquarters battery became the headquarters and headquarters battery of the division artillery. Its three field artillery regiments were reorganized into four battalions; one battalion was taken from each of the two 75 mm gun regiments to form two 105 mm howitzer battalions, the brigade&#x27;s ammunition train was reorganized as the third 105 mm howitzer battalion, and the 155 mm howitzer battalion was formed from the 155 mm howitzer regiment. The engineer, medical, and quartermaster regiments were reorganized into battalions. In 1942, divisional quartermaster battalions were split into ordnance light maintenance companies and quartermaster companies, and the division&#x27;s headquarters and military police company, which had previously been a combined unit, was split.

The first appointed commander of the 86th Infantry Division, Major General Alexander E. Anderson, died of a sudden heart attack on 24 December 1942 at the age of 53. He was replaced in January 1943 by Major General Harris M. Melasky, who led the division throughout the remainder of its combat service in World War II. The &quot;General John Pope&quot;-class U.S. Army transport ship &quot;USS General A. E. Anderson&quot; (AP-111), launched on 2 May 1943, was named in honor of General Anderson.

===Combat chronicle===
In early January 1945, General Dwight D. Eisenhower was alarmed over the swift progress the Germans had made during the waning Battle of the Bulge and was concerned that the Germans could move additional reinforcements to the west from the Eastern Front. He requested additional divisions over and above those already earmarked for the European theater. The 86th and 97th Infantry Divisions, allocated for service in the Pacific, were ordered to the European Theater of Operations instead for the final assault on Germany. The division arrived in France, 4 March 1945, and moved to Cologne, Germany, taking over defensive positions near Weiden, 24 March, in relief of the 8th Infantry Division. After a short period of patrolling on both sides of the Rhine, the division was relieved, and moved across the Rhine to , Germany, 5 April. In a rapid offensive advance, the 86th moved across the Bigge River, cleared Attendorn, 11 April, and continued on to the Ruhr uniting with the Ninth Army, taking part in the Ruhr pocket fighting. On 21 April, the division moved to Ansbach and continued to advance, taking Eichstätt on the 25th, crossing the Danube at Ingolstadt on the 27th, securing the bridge over the Amper Canal, 29 April, crossing the Isar and reaching Mittel Isar Canal by the end of the month. The division was ordered to take Wasserburg, 1 May, and leading elements had reached the outskirts of the city when they were ordered to withdraw, 2 May, and to move east to Salzburg.

The 86th Infantry Division was recognized as a liberating unit by the US Army&#x27;s Center of Military History and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 1996.  As the 86th advanced into the Ruhr region, the troops discovered the Attendorn civilian slave labor camp on April 11, 1945.

On 4 May, the division captured the crown jewels of Hungary in Mattsee, Austria. At the end of the war, the division was securing the left flank of the XV Corps. After processing German prisoners of war, it was redeployed to the United States, the 14,289 officers and men arriving in New York aboard four Navy transports 17 June 1945. The division trained briefly at Camp Gruber, Oklahoma, 21 June – 11 August 1945; and then left San Francisco, 24 August 1945, for the Philippines. The 86th Division was aboard ship in Leyte harbor when the Japanese surrendered. After landing on Luzon the unit was dispersed throughout the Island, some to Marikina, some to other locations. A few were assigned to Corregidor Island to guard Japanese prisoners of war. While Japan formally had surrendered on 2 September 1945, division soldiers still sometimes had to face Japanese soldiers who had refused to surrender as well as Huks (Hukbalahap guerrillas). According to one account, as late as October 1946 the &quot;straggler menace was still there&quot; as 77 Japanese prisoners were captured. A division officer (Lt. Col. A.L. Hugins) also &quot;was fired on while in convoy near Angeles&quot; in the same month.

<doc id="907723" wikidata="Q248649" url="?curid=907723" title="James D. Porter">
<text>James Davis Porter (December 7, 1828 – May 18, 1912) was an American attorney, politician, educator, and officer of the Confederate Army. He served as the 20th Governor of Tennessee from 1875 to 1879. He was subsequently appointed as Assistant Secretary of State during President Grover Cleveland&#x27;s first administration, and Minister to Chile in Cleveland&#x27;s second administration.

As an elected state legislator on the eve of the Civil War, Porter had introduced the &quot;Porter resolutions,&quot; which bound Tennessee to the Confederacy should war be declared. He served during much of the war as chief of staff to Confederate General Benjamin F. Cheatham, and saw action at various battles in Tennessee and Georgia.

Porter spent his later years as chancellor of his alma mater, the University of Nashville, and as president of Peabody College. This was established at the University of Nashville during his gubernatorial administration. He oversaw the liquidation and transfer of the University of Nashville&#x27;s assets to the Peabody Education Fund, which allowed Peabody College to be re-established near Vanderbilt University in 1909.

==Early life ==
Porter was born in Paris, Tennessee, the son of Dr. Thomas Kennedy Porter and Geraldine (Horton) Porter. Their town was the county seat of Henry County, included within West Tennessee. Porter attended college at the University of Nashville, where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts in 1846, and a Master of Arts in 1849. He studied law at Cumberland University and in Paris under local attorney John H. Dunlap; he was admitted to the bar in 1851. That year he also married Susannah Dunlap, his mentor&#x27;s daughter, starting his career and adult life.

==Career and Civil War==
Porter began a private practice in Paris, where he also became involved in politics. He was elected as a Whig to the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1859. In 1861, he introduced the &quot;Porter resolutions,&quot; which were eventually adopted. These resolutions stipulated that, in the event of war between seceding states and the Union, Tennessee would align with the seceding states. In early May 1861, following the Battle of Fort Sumter, these measures were enacted, and Tennessee signed a military pact with the Confederacy.

Porter was commissioned as an adjutant general under Gideon J. Pillow, and helped organize the Provisional Army of Tennessee. After this army was attached to the greater Confederate Army, Porter was assigned to General Benjamin F. Cheatham. As Cheatham&#x27;s chief of staff, Porter took part in the battles of Belmont, Shiloh, Chickamauga, Missionary Ridge, and the Siege of Atlanta.

After the war, Porter returned to his law practice in Paris. In 1870, he was a delegate to the state&#x27;s constitutional convention, which wrote the current Tennessee State Constitution, and served on the convention&#x27;s judiciary committee. Following the convention, he was elected judge of the state&#x27;s 12th circuit. Originally a Whig, he joined the Democratic Party after the Civil War, which was the party of the majority of southern whites.

==Governor==

Porter received the Democratic nomination for governor in 1874. He easily defeated his Republican opponent, Horace Maynard, by a 105,061 to 55,847 vote later that year. In 1876, he was reelected by a similarly lopsided margin over several candidates, among them moderate Democrat Dorsey B. Thomas and Republican William F. Yardley, the latter being the state&#x27;s first African-American candidate for governor.

Like his predecessor, John C. Brown, Porter spent much of his gubernatorial tenure managing the state&#x27;s out-of-control debt. After the state defaulted on its bonded debt in 1875, Porter continued to argue that the state should pay off the bonds in full to protect its credit. The Panic of 1873 had greatly reduced tax revenues, however, and full repayment proved unfeasible. His successors sought only a partial repayment.

Porter was a strong supporter of public education. When the Peabody Fund announced it was going to establish a school for teachers in Nashville, Porter used his influence to have the school attached to the University of Nashville.

During his tenure, but independent of the state, the South&#x27;s first medical school for African Americans, the privately supported Meharry Medical College, was founded in Nashville as part of Central Tennessee College, a historically black college founded by the northern Methodist Church.

Porter signed the so-called &quot;Four Mile Law,&quot; an early, backdoor form of Prohibition that forbade alcoholic beverages within four miles (6.4 km) of any school. Given the small size of most of the schools of the era, they were built in nearly every community, even many of the smallest ones. The law effectively outlawed alcohol in all but the least-populated areas of the state.

==Later endeavors==
In his book &quot;Appalachian Aspirations&quot;, Professor John Benhart describes Porter (and ex-Governor John C. Brown) as &quot;typical of the New South Conservatives who dominated Tennessee politics during the two decades following Reconstruction, mixing the mores of the Old South with a recognition that industrial capitalism was the wave of the future.&quot; Following his tenure as governor, Porter remained active in the New South economy.

He succeeded Edmund William Cole as the president of the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway from 1880 to 1884. He also served on the board of directors of the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company.

In 1885, Porter was appointed Assistant Secretary of State by President Grover Cleveland. He served under Secretary of State Thomas F. Bayard. In 1893, during Cleveland&#x27;s second term, Porter was appointed as U.S. Minister to Chile. He served there until a change in administrations in the Spring of 1894.

Porter spent the latter part of his life promoting and raising funds for his alma mater, the University of Nashville (from which he had been granted an honorary LL.D. in 1877), and its affiliated Peabody College. He was appointed a trustee of the Peabody Education Fund in 1883, and became president of the Board of Trustees for the University of Nashville in 1890.

Porter became chancellor of the University of Nashville in 1901, and president of Peabody College in 1902. He supported the construction of Confederate Memorial Hall. In the latter part of the decade, he oversaw the liquidation of the University of Nashville&#x27;s assets and their transfer to the Peabody fund for the reestablishment of Peabody College. The fund chose to locate the reorganized college at Vanderbilt&#x27;s campus, however, leaving Porter embittered. He resigned from the fund&#x27;s board in 1909.

In 1899, Porter published a book, &quot;The Military History of Tennessee, War of 1861-65&quot;, which became Volume VIII of Clement Evans&#x27;s 12-volume series, &quot;Confederate Military History&quot;. He was also active in the Tennessee Historical Society, at one point serving as its president.

Porter died in 1912, and is buried in the Paris City Cemetery.

==Family==
In 1851 Porter married Susannah Dunlap in Paris, Tennessee. She was the daughter of his law mentor, John H. Dunlap. They had six children together, three of whom died at a young age.

<text>Factoria is a mixed-use suburban neighborhood in south Bellevue, Washington and is one of the city&#x27;s significant commercial districts. Originally timberland from the 1890s to 1920s and later envisioned as an industrial center, Factoria has since the 1960s evolved into commercial and residential development. Factoria was annexed into Bellevue in 1993. The core neighborhood is bounded by Interstate 90 to the north, Interstate 405 to the west, Newport Way to the east, and Coal Creek Parkway to the south.

==History==
Factoria is part of the Duwamish Tribal Territory. &quot;During the 1890s, loggers cut large stands of timber on land now known as Woodridge Hill, Richards Valley, Greenwich Crest, Mockingbird Hill, Monthaven, Newport Shores, and the commercial area of Factoria.&quot;

In the late 1890s, the Northern Pacific Railway laid tracks through the largely uninhabited area along the shores of Lake Washington near Mercer Island. In the early 1900s a large industrial center was envisioned by a group of Seattle investors led by E. L. Skeel on what is now the interchange of Interstate 405 and I-90. In 1908 Skeel formed the Mercer Land Company and platted several blocks adjoining the railroad tracks. The new community was to be named Mercer. A stove factory was constructed at the town-site but never manufactured a single stove. By 1911, development of the community was at a standstill and the company, now run by a Sarah Kendall with Skeel as secretary, filed a new plat featuring more blocks and public space. The project was now called Factoria, a name that would hopefully attract major industries, which it never did.

According to, Factoria 

In the late 1920s Factoria became the headquarters for the burgeoning rabbit industry on the East Side. In 1927, an abandoned local factory was converted into a processing plant for canned rabbit meat and fur as well as a marketing headquarters for the industry. In 1939, construction began on a new $800,000 highway project that straightened out the Sunset Highway between Issaquah and Mercer Island and eventually led to the construction of the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge across Lake Washington. The new four-lane highway passed directly through Factoria and intersected with Lake Washington Boulevard, then the major north–south highway on the East side.

Following the opening of the bridge and highway in 1940, Factoria became a major crossroads. In 1950, the 900-car Sunset Outdoor Theatre was constructed near the intersection by Sterling Theatres, Inc.

Factoria remained largely undeveloped up until the 1960s, when freeway construction put the area at the intersection of two major arterials, Interstate 405 and Interstate 90, which would replace most of the original town-site and create a major suburban retail center. The construction of a shopping center was announced in July 1961. Since the 2010s, the area has undergone significant gentrification due to an influx of tech and other white-collar workers.

==Commerce and industry==
Factoria&#x27;s commercial development is centered on Marketplace at Factoria, a nearby AMC movie theater, and several grocery stores and office buildings, including the six-tower Newport Corporate Center, occupied primarily by T-Mobile USA. The &quot;Factoria Campus&quot; development situated directly north of The Marketplace at Factoria, consists of three office buildings plus a cinema and some retail businesses, standing where the Sunset Outdoor Theater formerly existed.

==Geography==
Factoria serves as a commercial center for surrounding residential neighborhoods, such as Eastgate, Somerset, Newport Hills, Newport Shores, Mockingbird Hill, Greenwich Crest, and Woodridge. The Factoria area represents a community of about bounded by Interstate 90 to the north, Lake Washington to the west, the Somerset Hills to the east, the Newport Hills to the south. The area contains about 5,000 residential units, of commercial space, and offices employing 7,500 people. Public transportation in Factoria is served by King County Metro buses, primarily routes 240, 241, 245 (frequent), and 246, with service to much of the Eastside. Nearby Eastgate Park and Ride provides additional service into Seattle. Factoria Boulevard, Richards Road, Eastgate Way, Newport Way, and Coal Creek Parkway are major arterials that lead to or through the Factoria area.

===Surrounding cities and neighborhoods===
==The Marketplace at Factoria==
The Marketplace at Factoria first opened in 1977 under the name Factoria Square, later called Factoria Mall, originally contained about 20 retailers and was anchored by Ernst Home Centers, Lamonts, Pay &#x27;n Save, and Safeway. In 2008, the mall was slated for new urbanist redevelopment under current owner Kimco Realty, likely a result of being labeled a dead mall as anchors such as Mervyn&#x27;s moved out. It was renamed to the Marketplace at Factoria.

, the Marketplace at Factoria has 69 retail spaces anchored by Amazon Fresh, Rite Aid, Old Navy, Target, TJ Maxx, DSW, and Nordstrom Rack. Walmart, which opened in the former Mervyn&#x27;s space in 2012, closed its Factoria store on April 22, 2022, due to poor financial performance partly induced by competition with the neighboring Target. The Walmart space is set to be replaced in 2024 by the first U.S. location for T&amp;T Supermarket, a Canadian company which operates Asian grocery stores.

<text>is a dictatorship in which civil liberties are allegedly preserved rather than destroyed. The word is a pun on the Spanish word (&quot;dictatorship&quot;), replacing , which by itself is a word meaning &#x27;hard&#x27;, with , meaning &#x27;soft&#x27;.

The term was first used in Spain in 1930 when Dámaso Berenguer replaced Miguel Primo de Rivera y Orbaneja as the head of the ruling dictatorial government, and attempted to reduce tensions in the country by repealing some of the harsher measures that Primo de Rivera had introduced. It was also used to refer to the later years of Francisco Franco&#x27;s Spanish State, and to the hegemonic 70-year rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in Mexico. Augusto Pinochet used the term when he was asked about his regime and the accusations about his government.

Analogously, the same pun is made in Portuguese as or . In February 2009, the Brazilian newspaper ran a controversial editorial classifying the military dictatorship in Brazil (1964–1985) as a .

In Spanish, the term is contrasted with (a portmanteau of and ), meaning an illiberal democracy – a system in which the government and its leaders are elected, but which is relatively deficient in civil liberties.

In Uruguay, the short-lived dictatorship of Alfredo Baldomir in 1942 was nicknamed a , in contrast to the previous harsh dictatorship by Gabriel Terra.

<doc id="907729" wikidata="Q1471410" url="?curid=907729" title="Placenta praevia">
<text>Placenta praevia or placenta previa is when the placenta attaches inside the uterus but in a position near or over the cervical opening. Symptoms include vaginal bleeding in the second half of pregnancy. The bleeding is bright red and tends not to be associated with pain. Complications may include placenta accreta, dangerously low blood pressure, or bleeding after delivery. Complications for the baby may include fetal growth restriction.
Risk factors include pregnancy at an older age and smoking as well as prior cesarean section, labor induction, or termination of pregnancy. Diagnosis is by ultrasound. It is classified as a complication of pregnancy.
For those who are less than 36 weeks pregnant with only a small amount of bleeding recommendations may include bed rest and avoiding sexual intercourse. For those after 36 weeks of pregnancy or with a significant amount of bleeding, cesarean section is generally recommended. In those less than 36 weeks pregnant, corticosteroids may be given to speed development of the baby&#x27;s lungs. Cases that occur in early pregnancy may resolve on their own.
Placenta praevia affects approximately 0.5% of pregnancies. After four cesarean sections, however, it affects 10% of pregnancies. Rates of disease have increased over the late 20th century and early 21st century. The condition was first described in 1685 by Paul Portal.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Women with placenta praevia often present with painless, bright red vaginal bleeding. This commonly occurs around 32 weeks of gestation, but can be as early as late mid-trimester. More than half of women affected by placenta praevia (51.6%) have bleeding before delivery. This bleeding often starts mildly and may increase as the area of placental separation increases. Placenta praevia should be suspected if there is bleeding after 24 weeks of gestation. Bleeding after delivery occurs in about 22% of those affected.

Women may also present as a case of failure of engagement of fetal head.

== Cause ==
The exact cause of placenta praevia is unknown. It is hypothesized to be related to abnormal vascularisation of the endometrium caused by scarring or atrophy from previous trauma, surgery, or infection. These factors may reduce differential growth of lower segment, resulting in less upward shift in placental position as pregnancy advances.

=== Risk factors ===

The following have been identified as risk factors for placenta praevia:
* Previous placenta praevia (recurrence rate 4–8%), caesarean delivery, myomectomy or endometrium damage caused by D&amp;C.
* Women who are younger than 20 are at higher risk and women older than 35 are at increasing risk as they get older.
* Women who have had previous pregnancies (multiparity), especially a large number of closely spaced pregnancies, are at higher risk due to uterine damage.
* Smoking during pregnancy; cocaine use during pregnancy
* Women with a large placentae from twins or erythroblastosis are at higher risk.
* Race is a controversial risk factor, with some studies finding that people from Asia and Africa are at higher risk and others finding no difference.
* Placental pathology (velamentous insertion, succenturiate lobes, bipartite i.e. bilobed placenta etc.)
* Baby is in an unusual position: breech (buttocks first) or transverse (lying horizontally across the womb).
Placenta praevia is itself a risk factor of placenta accreta. Alcohol use during pregnancy was previously listed as a risk factor, but is discredited by this article.

=== Classification ===
Traditionally, four grades of placenta praevia were distinguished, but it is now more common to simply differentiate between &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor cases.
Other than that, placenta praevia can be also classified as:

Complete: When the placenta completely covers the cervix

Partial: When the placenta partially covers the cervix

Marginal: When the placenta ends near the edge of the cervix, about 2 cm from the internal cervical os

== Diagnosis ==
History may reveal antepartum hemorrhage. Abdominal examination usually finds the uterus non-tender, soft and relaxed. Leopold&#x27;s maneuvers may find the fetus in an oblique or breech position or lying transverse as a result of the abnormal position of the placenta. Malpresentation is found in about 35% cases. Vaginal examination is avoided in known cases of placenta previa.

=== Confirmatory ===
Previa can be confirmed with an ultrasound. Transvaginal ultrasound has superior accuracy as compared to transabdominal one, thus allowing measurement of the distance between the placenta and cervical os. This has rendered the traditional classification of placenta praevia obsolete.

False positives may be due to following reasons:
* Overfilled bladder compressing lower uterine segment
* Myometrial contraction simulating placental tissue in abnormally low location
* Early pregnancy low position, which in third trimester may be entirely normal due to differential growth of the uterus.

In such cases, repeat scanning is done after an interval of 15–30 minutes.

In parts of the world where ultrasound is unavailable, it is not uncommon to confirm the diagnosis with an examination in the surgical theatre. The proper timing of an examination in theatre is important. If the woman is not bleeding severely she can be managed non-operatively until the 36th week. By this time the baby&#x27;s chance of survival is as good as at full term.

== Management ==
An initial assessment to determine the status of the mother and fetus is required. Although mothers used to be treated in the hospital from the first bleeding episode until birth, it is now considered safe to treat placenta praevia on an outpatient basis if the fetus is at less than 30 weeks of gestation, and neither the mother nor the fetus are in distress. Immediate delivery of the fetus may be indicated if the fetus is mature or if the fetus or mother are in distress. Blood volume replacement (to maintain blood pressure) and blood plasma replacement (to maintain fibrinogen levels) may be necessary.

Corticosteroids are indicated at 24–34 weeks gestation, given the higher risk of premature birth.

=== Delivery ===

The method of delivery is determined by clinical state of the mother, fetus and ultrasound findings. In minor degrees (traditional grade I and II), vaginal delivery is possible. RCOG recommends that the placenta should be at least 2 cm away from internal os for an attempted vaginal delivery. When a vaginal delivery is attempted, consultant obstetrician and anesthetists are present in delivery suite. In cases of fetal distress and major degrees (traditional grade III and IV) a caesarean section is indicated. Caesarean section is contraindicated in cases of disseminated intravascular coagulation. An obstetrician may need to divide the anterior lying placenta. In such cases, blood loss is expected to be high and thus blood and blood products are always kept ready. In rare cases, hysterectomy may be required.

== Complications ==

=== Maternal ===
* Antepartum hemorrhage
* Malpresentation
* Abnormal placentation
* Postpartum hemorrhage
* Placenta praevia increases the risk of puerperal sepsis and postpartum hemorrhage because the lower segment to which the placenta was attached contracts less well post-delivery.

=== Fetal ===
* IUGR (15% incidence)
* Hypoxia
* Premature delivery
* Death

== Epidemiology ==
Placenta praevia occurs approximately one of every 200 births globally. It has been suggested that rates of placenta praevia are increasing due to increased rates of Caesarean sections. Reasons for regional variation may include ethnicity and diet.

=== Africa ===
Rates of placenta praevia in sub-Saharan Africa are the lowest in the world, averaging 2.7 per 1000 pregnancies. Despite a low prevalence, this disease has had a profound impact in Africa as it is linked with negative outcomes for both the mother and infant. The most common maternal outcome of placenta praevia is extreme blood loss before or after birth (antepartum hemorrhage and postpartum hemorrhage), which is a major cause of maternal and infant mortality in countries like Tanzania. Risk factors for placenta praevia among African women include prior pregnancies, prenatal alcohol consumption, and insufficient gynecologic care. In North Africa placenta praevia rates occur in 6.4 per 1000 pregnancies.

=== Asia ===
Mainland China has the highest prevalence of placenta praevia in the world, measuring at an average of 12.2 per 1000 pregnancies. Specifically, placenta praevia is most common in Southeast Asia, though the reason for this has not yet been investigated. There are many risk factors for placenta praevia in Asian women, of which include pregnancies occurring in women ages 35 and older (advanced maternal age) or in women who have had a prior Caesarean section, having multiple pregnancies, and experiencing either miscarriage or abortion in the past. In comparison with other Asian countries, placenta praevia is more common in Japan (13.9 per 1000) and Korea (15 per 1000). In the Middle East, placenta praevia rates are lower in both Saudi Arabia (7.3 per 1000) and Israel (4.2 per 1000).

=== Australia ===
The continent with the second highest rates for placenta praevia is Australia, where it affects about 9.5 out of every 1000 pregnant women. Researchers concerned with these rates have tested the specificity and sensitivity of fetal anomaly scans. In conclusion, it was determined the threshold that defines placenta praevia (based on proximity of placenta to cervix) must be reduced in order to improve the accuracy of diagnoses and to avoid false positives leading screenings.

=== Europe ===
Placenta praevia in Europe occurs in about 3.6 per 1000 pregnancies.

=== Latin America ===
In Latin America, placenta praevia occurs in about 5.1 per 1000 pregnancies.

=== North America ===
In North America placenta praevia occurs in 2.9 per 1000 pregnancies. Ethnic differences indicate white women are less likely to experience placenta praevia than black women. Additionally, more cases of placenta praevia are found in women from low-income areas which are linked to insufficient pregnancy care. According to the socioeconomic demographic in North America, black women are more likely to come from low income areas and are thus more likely to develop placenta praevia.

In Nova Scotia, infants born to pregnant woman who experience placenta praevia have a mortality rate 3–4 times higher than normal pregnancies. A couple of factors contribute to this rate, including length of time fetus was in the womb and mother&#x27;s age. Infants that did survive experienced increased rates of birth defects, breathing problems, and blood abnormalities.

Research suggests that the incidence of placenta praevia in the U.S. is increasing as a result of the increased rate of Caesarean sections.

<text>Jaycie Lynn Phelps (born September 26, 1979, in Greenfield, Indiana, United States) is a retired American Olympic gymnast and member of the 1996 Olympic gold medal U.S. women&#x27;s gymnastics team, the Magnificent Seven. She is known for her consistency and clean lines in her gymnastics.

==Personal life==
Jaycie Phelps was born on September 26, 1979, in Indianapolis, Indiana, and grew up in Greenfield, Indiana. She is the daughter of Jack and Cheryl. She has one older brother, Dennis. She was married to 2004 Olympic gymnast Brett McClure in 2005. They have divorced as of 2008. Today, she is the owner and head coach of the Jaycie Phelps Athletic Center in Greenfield, Indiana. In 2014, she married Dave Marus.

==Gymnastics career==
===Early years===
Jaycie Phelps began gymnastics at the age of four at Indiana Gymnast in Greenfield, Indiana, and attended once-a-week practice before doing two-a-week practices and building up from there. At age 11, after progressing to the point where her family felt she could benefit from a new coach, she and her family moved to Scottsdale, Arizona and she trained at Desert Devils Gymnastics for extensive training. She attended the 1993 Junior National Championships, but ended up in 24th place, and wanted to quit altogether. After receiving encouragement from her parents, who wanted her to give it another shot, she went and trained at Cincinnati Gymnastics Academy in Cincinnati, Ohio, training alongside future Olympic teammate, Amanda Borden. Jaycie&#x27;s father and brother went back to Indiana whilst Jaycie and her mother stayed in Cincinnati.

===1994===
Phelps made her senior debut at the 1994 American Classic in Orlando, Florida, which also served as the trials for the 1994 World Championships. She placed 15th and did not make the team. She attended the 1994 Olympic Festival in St. Louis, Missouri and placed 3rd all-around, plus 5th on balance beam and 6th on floor exercise. At the 1994 U.S. Classic, she placed 3rd in the all-around. She later attended the 1994 Senior National Championships and placed 6th. After doing well and placing 5th in the 1994 World Team Trials in Richmond, Virginia, she was selected to be part of the team to go to the 1994 World Team Championships in Dortmund, Germany, where she won a silver medal.

===1995===
In 1995, she kicked off the year by competing at the 1995 American Classic in Oakland, California, which also served as the trials for the 1995 Pan American Games. She placed 8th in the all-around, tied for 3rd on the uneven bars, and placed 6th on beam, yet didn&#x27;t make the team. The year followed with appearances at the Reese&#x27;s International Gymnastics Cup, McDonald&#x27;s American Cup, and the International Mixed Pairs. She then rallied at the 1995 Classic, winning 1st in the all-around, uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise, and placed 2nd on vault. At the 1995 National Championships, she placed 3rd, behind Dominique Moceanu and Shannon Miller. She was selected at the 1995 World Trials to attend the 1995 World Championships in Sabae, Japan after petitioning in her score at nationals since she injured herself and couldn&#x27;t compete. She won the bronze medal in the team competition, and qualified for the event final on the uneven bars and placed 8th.

===1996===
1996 was yet another successful year for Phelps. After strong showings at the American Classic, the 1996 Budget Rent a Car Gymnastics Invitational dual against France, and the 1996 World Championships, she placed 2nd in the all-around at the 1996 National Championships, 0.05 behind Shannon Miller. At the Olympic Trials in Boston, Massachusetts, she placed 1st after day 1. On day 2, she over-rotated her dismount on the balance beam and stumbled into a backward roll, but strong performances on the other apparatus helped her place 3rd all-around, securing a spot on the 1996 US Olympic Women&#x27;s Gymnastics Team.

====1996 Olympic Games====
At the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia, Phelps competed on all four events in both compulsories and optionals. She was typically first or second up on each apparatus, but her contributions were invaluable. In the compulsories, she had a shaky performance on the beam and fell, but good routines on the bars, floor, and vault helped her team place second behind Russia. In the optionals, she performed solidly, placing high on all four events and contributing to the team&#x27;s first-ever Olympic gold medal. She also placed 17th in the all-around, but four of her teammates (Shannon Miller, Dominique Dawes, Kerri Strug, and Dominique Moceanu) placed higher than her. Due to the fact that only three gymnasts from each country could perform in the all-around competition, Phelps could not compete in the final.

===Comeback===
In October 1999, Phelps announced for a comeback in hopes of making the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney. She was not the only gymnast from the Magnificent Seven who announced a comeback for the 2000 Olympics; teammates Dominique Dawes, Dominique Moceanu, Amy Chow, and Shannon Miller were also vying for spots on the Olympic team. At the 2000 Classic, she competed on uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise, and qualified for the 2000 National Championships. She competed on day 1 of nationals, but withdrew on day 2 and petitioned to go to the 2000 Olympic Trials, but her petition was denied. Following a knee injury, she ultimately decided to retire from gymnastics.

==Eponymous skills==
==Awards and achievements==
Phelps was inducted into the U.S. Gymnastics Hall of Fame in 1998 as a member of the 1996 U.S. gymnastics team. In 2008, she was inducted into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in the team category. The team received their award in Chicago with other Olympic greats. Following their Olympic performance, they also made an appearance on the box of Wheaties and were featured in the book &quot;The Magnificent Seven.&quot;

Phelps was awarded Sagamore of the Wabash, which is the highest award bestowed upon an Indiana resident, and the Ohio Governor&#x27;s Award.

Colerain Township proclaimed August 30, 1996 as &quot;Jaycie Phelps Day&quot;.

A street in Cincinnati, Ohio, was renamed in her honor as Jaycie Phelps Drive. And on the east side of Greenfield, Indiana, there is now a road named Jaycie Phelps Road.

Phelps opened Jaycie Phelps Athletic with her husband in Greenfield, Indiana.

<doc id="907738" wikidata="Q2614575" url="?curid=907738" title="Mishihase">
<text>The , also read as Ashihase and Shukushin, were a people of ancient Japan, believed to have lived along the northern portion of the coast of the Sea of Japan. The term Sushen, rendered 肅愼, is found in Chinese records, but is annotated as Mishihase or Ashihase in Japanese language documents, which should have developed into *&quot;Mishiwase&quot; or *&quot;Ashiwase&quot; in modern Japanese if the word had survived in colloquial speech.

According to the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, the Mishihase first arrived at Sado Island during the reign of Emperor Kinmei. In 660, Japanese General Abe no Hirafu defeated the Mishihase in &quot;Watarishima&quot; at the request of the native inhabitants. During the Edo period, Arai Hakuseki proposed that Watarishima was Ezo, which was later renamed Hokkaidō. The battle place was recorded as the mouth of a large river, which is proposed to be Ishikari River.

Some historians consider that the Mishihase were identical to the Tungusic Sushen in Chinese records, but others think that the Japanese people named the indigenous people in the northeast based on their knowledge of Chinese records, just as the Chinese did during the Three Kingdoms period. Most, including Kisao Ishizuki (1979) of the Sapporo University, suggest that the Mishihase were the Nivkhs belonging to the Okhotsk culture.

<doc id="907742" wikidata="Q6708827" url="?curid=907742" title="Lynette Roberts">
<text>Evelyn (&#x27;Lynette&#x27;) Beatrice Roberts (4 July 1909 – 26 September 1995) was a Welsh poet and novelist. Her poems were about war, landscape, and life in the small Welsh village where she lived. She published two poetry collections: &quot;Poems&quot; (1944) and &quot;Gods with Stainless Ears: A Heroic Poem&quot; (1951). Roberts&#x27; work was admired by many poets, including: T.S. Eliot, Dylan Thomas and Robert Graves. In later life, Roberts had a mental breakdown and stopped publishing. Her work was largely forgotten for the remainder of her life. She died in 1995.

Roberts provided Welsh-related material for Graves&#x27; &quot;The White Goddess&quot; (1948), and Graves dedicated his book to her. In 1956, Roberts was diagnosed with schizophrenia. She spent much of the rest of her life as a resident of mental institutions.

==Early life==

Roberts was born 4 July 1909 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to Cecil Roberts and Ruby Garbutt, both Australians of Welsh descent. Cecil Roberts was a railway engineer, who worked as General Manager of the Buenos Aires Western Railways. The family enjoyed an affluent lifestyle, owning &quot;yachts and racehorses&quot;. The family moved to London during World War I where her father enlisted and served as a soldier. He was later wounded.

Roberts and her sisters, Winifred and Rosemary returned to Buenos Aires to attend the Convent School of the Sacred Heart. Her mother, Ruby died of typhus when Roberts was 14 years old. After her mother&#x27;s death, Roberts and her sisters were sent to Bournemouth, England. Roberts went on to study in London at the Central School for Arts and Crafts. In the 1930s, Roberts and friend Celia Buckmaster started a florist business together. Later, they moved to Madeira, where they lived in a small house and Roberts worked on her poetry.

In 1939, while living in London, Roberts met the Welsh poet, Ronald Rees Jones at a Poetry London Event. Jones wrote under the name Keidrych Rhys. Roberts and Jones married on 4 October 1939 at Llansteffan, Wales. Poet Dylan Thomas was Jones&#x27;s best man. Jones legally changed his name to Keidrych Rhys in 1940.

==The war years==

The couple moved to a rented cottage in the small Welsh village of Llanybri during World War II. They lived in relative poverty. During the next 10 years, Roberts worked on her poetry. She began a professional relationship with poet T.S. Eliot, who was an editor at Faber Publishing and became friends with the poet Robert Graves. During this decade, Roberts a produced &quot;an extraordinary and unique body of work&quot;. She gave birth to two children toward the end of the war, a daughter, Angharad, born in 1945, and a son, Pridein, born in 1946. In 1949, Roberts and Rhys divorced.

In Llanybri, Roberts painted, wrote poetry and raised her family. In 1944 her collection &quot;Poems&quot; were published by Faber and Faber. She immortalised her village in her &quot;Poem from Llanybri&quot;. This poem was addressed to the poet, Alun Lewis, to whom Roberts confessed to being attracted. In 1944 and 1945 drafts of Robert Graves&#x27;s &quot;The White Goddess&quot; were published in Keidrych Rhys&#x27;s periodical, &quot;Wales&quot;. Roberts was the dedicatee of Robert Graves&#x27;s &quot;The White Goddess&quot; in its first edition (1948), having provided much of the Welsh material used by him. Faber and Faber published her &quot;Gods with stainless ears: a heroic poem&quot; in 1951. Her documentary novel, &quot;The Endeavour: Captain Cook&#x27;s first voyage to Australia&quot; was published in 1954.

==Mental breakdown, late life and death==

In 1956, she had a serious mental breakdown and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. During these years, Roberts became a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness and stopped writing, Roberts spent time in and out of mental institutions until her death in 1995. Later in life, Roberts repudiated her work and refused to permit her published poetry to be reprinted.

Her final years from 1989 were spent at a retirement home, in Ferryside, Carmarthenshire. Aged 86, she died there on 26 September 1995. She is buried in the churchyard in Llanybri.

==Posthumous publications==

After Roberts&#x27;s death, an edition of her collected poems was issued by Seren Press but was immediately withdrawn because of legal problems with the Roberts estate; a new &quot;Collected Poems&quot; finally appeared in 2006 from Carcanet, edited by Patrick McGuinness.

A volume of miscellaneous prose, diaries from her time in Llanybri, correspondence with Robert Graves, memoirs of the Sitwells and T. S. Eliot, an essay on &quot;village dialect&quot; and short stories appeared in 2008. An unpublished novel, &quot;Nesta&quot;, written in 1944, is apparently lost.

<doc id="907744" wikidata="Q369015" url="?curid=907744" title="Western Wireless Corporation">
<text>Western Wireless Corporation was a cellular network operator that provided mobile telecommunications service to subscribers in 19 western states in the United States, and seven other countries. Western Wireless marketed analog cellular service under the Cellular One brand in 88 FCC-defined rural service areas and digital PCS service under the VoiceStream brand in 19 FCC-defined metropolitan service areas. At its peak in 2004, Western Wireless provided service to 1.4 million domestic subscribers. Western Wireless obtained additional revenue from the international operations of its Western Wireless International Corporation subsidiary, which was licensed to provide wireless communications services in seven countries to a total of 1.8 million subscribers.

Western Wireless traces its roots to Stanton Communications, founded in 1988 by John W. Stanton and Theresa Gillespie. Western Wireless was formed in 1994 by the merger of two other Stanton controlled entities, Pacific Northwest Cellular and General Cellular Corporation. Western Wireless became a publicly traded company in 1996. Western Wireless spun off its VoiceStream Wireless subsidiary in 1999, which was later purchased by Deutsche Telekom AG in 2001. Deutsche Telekom renamed VoiceStream Wireless to T-Mobile USA in 2002.

Western Wireless merged with Alltel Corporation in August 2005. After the merger, Alltel sold Western Wireless&#x27; international assets.

==History==
From its headquarters in Bellevue, Washington, United States, Western Wireless Corporation provided wireless communications service in 19 western states. The company initially specialized in providing cellular service to rural areas under the Cellular One brand, but expanded into urban areas by acquiring PCS spectrum licenses, building out digital networks and providing services under the VoiceStream brand.

Western Wireless traces its roots to Stanton Communications, founded by John W. Stanton and Theresa Gillespie in 1988. Stanton Communications invested in communications related businesses, including cellular, paging, telephone answering, alarm system monitoring, voice mail, radio broadcasting and private cable television. Stanton Communications invested in private cable television in the Soviet Union and cellular communications service in Hong Kong.

Stanton was the founder, chairman and chief executive officer of Pacific Northwest Cellular, established in 1992. The company grew to become the United States&#x27; eighth-largest independent cellular company.

Stanton was elected chairman of the board of directors for General Cellular Corporation in 1992, when Stanton Communications and investment firm Hellman and Friedman acquired a controlling interest in the company.

Stanton and Hellman and Friedman created Western Wireless Corporation in August, 1994 by merging Pacific Northwest Cellular and General Cellular Corporation. The merged entity took the name Western Wireless Corporation and through the merger created what the company called the &quot;largest rural cellular-service provider in the United States.&quot; At the time of the merger, the company offered service in 16 western and mid-western states with service areas covering 5.2 million potential customers.

Western Wireless became a publicly traded company in May 1996, offering 12.65 million shares traded on the NASDAQ under the stock ticker symbol WWCA. Combined with a separate public bond offering, the company raised US$430 million in net proceeds.

On May 3, 1999, Western Wireless spun off its VoiceStream Wireless division to Western Wireless shareholders, creating an independent, publicly traded Delaware corporation called VoiceStream Wireless Corporation. Shares of VoiceStream Wireless traded on the NASDAQ under the stock ticker symbol VSTR. The spin off was intended to remove any conglomerate discount, get better value recognition for each of Western Wireless&#x27; core analog cellular and digital PCS networks and help each business pursue independent strategies. VoiceStream was purchased by Deutsche Telekom in 2001 for US$30 billion and renamed T-Mobile USA in 2002.

On January 9, 2005, Western Wireless entered into a merger agreement with Little Rock, Arkansas-based telecommunications provider Alltel in which Alltel agreed to pay $6 billion in stock-and-cash to Western Wireless shareholders. Western Wireless shareholders voted on July 29, 2005, eleven years to the day after Western Wirless was incorporated, to accept a US$4.4 billion stock-and-cash offer from Alltel. The merger closed on August 1, 2005. At the time, the merger created the fifth largest wireless communications provider in the United States with 10 million customers in 33 states.

==Western Wireless International==
Western Wireless subsidiary Western Wireless International Corporation held mobile licenses in several countries outside the United States including: Austria (Tele.Ring), Ireland (Meteor Mobile Communications), Slovenia (Vega), Haiti (ComCel), Bolivia (Viva), Iceland (TAL), Croatia (vipnet), Georgia, Ghana and Côte d&#x27;Ivoire covering about 1.8 million subscribers in 2005.

After Alltel acquired Western Wireless, non-core international assets were sold. Alltel sold Meteor to Irish telecoms incumbent, eircom and sold Tele.Ring to T-Mobile Austria. In Slovenia, the assets of Vega were split between the two main network operators.

<doc id="907745" wikidata="Q181828" url="?curid=907745" title="Albert S. Marks">
<text>Albert Smith Marks (October 16, 1836November 4, 1891) was an American attorney, soldier and politician. He was the 21st governor of Tennessee from 1879 to 1881. Prior to that, he had served as a state chancery court judge. Marks fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War, and part of his leg was amputated as a result of a wound suffered at the Battle of Stones River in 1862.

==Early life==
Marks was born in Owensboro, Kentucky, one of seven children of Elisha Marks and Elizabeth (Lashbrook) Marks. His parents were pious Methodists, and initially wanted Albert to become a minister. He attended school in Owensboro until the age of 14, when his father died, and he focused on helping his mother maintain the family farm. Although he had little formal education afterward, he was an avid reader, and poured through multiple books on history and ancient literature.

When he was 19, Marks moved to Winchester, Tennessee, to work in the law firm of his mother&#x27;s cousin, Arthur S. Colyar. He read law with Colyar, and was admitted to the bar in 1858. The firm then practiced under the name Colyar, Marks and Frizzell. After Frizzell withdrew in 1861, the firm continued as Colyar and Marks.

==Civil War==

Although he was a Southern Democrat, Marks was an opponent of secession. In early 1861, he ran as the pro-Union candidate for his district&#x27;s representative to the state&#x27;s proposed convention on secession, and canvassed with his opponent, future governor Peter Turney. When war broke out, Marks nevertheless joined the Confederate Army. He was elected captain of Company E, 17th Tennessee Infantry, which was initially under the command of Felix K. Zollicoffer, and saw action at the battles of Camp Wildcat (October 1861) and Mill Springs (January 1862) in Kentucky. After Zollicoffer&#x27;s death in the latter engagement, the 17th was reassigned to General Bushrod Johnson&#x27;s forces. In May 1862, Marks was promoted to major.

During a reorganization of Confederate forces in June 1862, Marks was promoted to colonel, and placed in command of the 17th. His regiment was assigned to General Simon B. Buckner&#x27;s division, which launched an invasion of Kentucky in the Fall of 1862. Marks&#x27;s regiment fought at the Battle of Munfordville, where was he chosen by Buckner to accept the formal surrender of Union forces. Following this invasion, the 17th was assigned to General Patrick Cleburne&#x27;s division, with which it fought at the Battle of Stones River on December 31, 1862. As Marks&#x27;s regiment charged a Union battery during this engagement, his right leg was shattered by canister shot, and was subsequently amputated below the knee.

Marks spent most of the remainder of the war convalescing in Winchester and at a hospital in LaGrange, Georgia, though he later joined General Nathan B. Forrest&#x27;s staff as a judge advocate. After the war, he practiced law with Colyar in Winchester until 1866, when Colyar moved to Nashville. He then formed a firm with partners James Fitzpatrick and T.D. Gregory.

==Governor==

Marks was elected judge of the state&#x27;s Fourth Chancery District in 1870. He was reelected in 1878, but resigned after receiving the Democratic Party&#x27;s nomination for governor later that year. In the general election, he won easily, receiving 89,958 votes to 42,284 votes for the Republican candidate, Chattanooga Mayor Eli M. Wight, and 15,155 votes for the Greenback candidate, Richard M. Edwards of Cleveland. Marks was the first lifelong Democrat to be elected after the Civil War (his two predecessors, John C. Brown and James D. Porter, had been Whigs before the war).

Like his two immediate predecessors, the major issue confronting the Marks administration was the state&#x27;s debt crisis, which had resulted from the gradual accumulation of bonded debt to pay for internal improvements and railroad construction over the previous four decades. The Panic of 1873 had greatly reduced property tax revenue, and the state had defaulted on its bond payments in 1875. Furthermore, a Yellow Fever epidemic had decimated Memphis, putting more strains on the economy. By the time Marks took office, his party had split into two factions— those who favored full repayment of the debt to protect the state&#x27;s credit, and those who favored only partial repayment.

Marks appointed a legislative committee to investigate the debt issue. The committee determined that railroad agents had acted unethically during the Brownlow administration, and had attempted to defraud the state, and thus should only be entitled to partial repayment. Marks agreed, and a new repayment plan was negotiated with banks. When this plan was put before the state&#x27;s voters, however, they soundly rejected it by a vote of 76,333 to 49,772, leaving the issue unresolved.

Marks did not seek reelection in 1880, realizing his party was still badly split over the debt issue. The divided Democrats were defeated in the general election for governor later that year.

==Later life==

Following his gubernatorial term, Marks formed a new law partnership with Colyar and John Childress Jr., known as Colyar, Marks and Childress. This firm operated until 1883. Marks remained active in politics in his later years. He was an elector for the Democratic presidential ticket for Tennessee&#x27;s at-large district in 1888, and attended the Democratic National Convention later that year.

Marks died at the Maxwell House Hotel in Nashville on November 4, 1891. He was interred in the Winchester City Cemetery.

==Family and legacy==
Marks married Novella Davis in 1863, while he was recovering from his injury received at the Battle of Stones River. They had become engaged prior to this battle, and after his leg was amputated, he offered to release her from the engagement, but she refused. They had two children, Arthur Handly Marks and Albert Davis Marks.

Marks lived on a plantation near Winchester he had purchased around 1870. In 1889, his son, Arthur, began building a massive house at this plantation that became known as Hundred Oaks Castle. After Arthur&#x27;s death, his son, John, continued its expansion. Hundred Oaks was occupied by the Catholic Paulist Fathers throughout the first half of the 20th century. The house was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 and documented by the Historic American Buildings Survey in the mid-1980s, and is currently maintained by the non-profit Kent Bramlett Foundation.

<text>The Lake Pontchartrain Causeway (), also known simply as The Causeway, is a fixed link composed of two parallel bridges crossing Lake Pontchartrain in southeastern Louisiana, United States. The longer of the two bridges is long. The southern terminus of the causeway is in Metairie, Louisiana, and the northern terminus is in Mandeville, Louisiana. Both are in the New Orleans metropolitan area.

The Lake Pontchartrain Causeway holds the Guinness World Record for longest &quot;continuous&quot; span over water in the world. It previously was listed as longest bridge over water in the world; in 2011, in response to the opening of the Qingdao Jiaozhou Bay Bridge in China, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; created two categories for bridges over water: Lake Pontchartrain Causeway then became the longest bridge over water (continuous), while the Jiaozhou Bay Bridge became the longest bridge over water (aggregate).

The bridges are supported by 9,500 concrete pilings. The two bridges feature a bascule, which spans the navigation channel south of the north shore.

== History ==
The idea of a bridge spanning Lake Pontchartrain dates back to the early 19th century and Bernard de Marigny, the founder of Mandeville. He started a ferry service that continued to operate into the mid-1930s. In the 1920s, a proposal called for the creation of artificial islands that would then be linked by a series of bridges. The financing for this plan would come from selling home sites on the islands. The modern causeway started to take form in 1948 when Ernest M. Loëb Jr. envisioned the project. Due to his lobbying and vision, the Louisiana Legislature created what is now the Causeway Commission. The Louisiana Bridge Company was formed to construct the bridge, which in turn appointed James E. Walters Sr. to direct the project. Ernest M Loëb was assisted by his nephew, Ernest M. Loëb III, president of Ernest M. Loëb &amp; Company to plan the construction of the bridge

The original causeway was a two-lane span, measuring in length. It opened in 1956 at a cost of $46 million (equivalent to $ million in dollars). This included not just the bridge, but three approach roads on the north end and a long stretch of road on the south end.

On June 16, 1964, six people died when barges tore a gap in the bridge and a bus plunged into the lake.

A parallel two-lane span, longer than the original, opened on May 10, 1969, at a cost of $30 million (equivalent to $ million in dollars).

Since its construction, the causeway has operated as a toll bridge. Until 1999, tolls were collected from traffic going in each direction. To alleviate congestion on the south shore, toll collections were eliminated on the northbound span. In May 1999, the standard tolls for cars changed from $1.50 in each direction to a $3 toll collected on the North Shore for southbound traffic. In 2017, the toll was raised to fund safety improvements on the bridge. The toll changed from $3.00 with cash and $2.00 with a toll tag to $5.00 with cash and $3.00 with a toll tag.

The opening of the causeway boosted the fortunes of small North Shore communities by reducing drive time into New Orleans by up to 50 minutes, bringing the North Shore into the New Orleans metropolitan area. Prior to the causeway, residents of St. Tammany Parish used either the Maestri Bridge on U.S. Route 11 or the Rigolets Bridge on U.S. Route 90, both near Slidell, Louisiana; or on the west side, via U.S. Route 51 through Manchac, Louisiana.

After Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005, videos collected showed damage to the bridge. The storm surge was not as high under the causeway as it was near the I-10 Twin Span Bridge, and damage was mostly limited to the turnarounds. A total of 17 spans were lost on that bridge but the structural foundations remained intact. The causeways have never sustained major damage of any sort from hurricanes or other natural occurrences, a rarity among causeways. The existing fiber optic cable plant was blown out of its tray but remained intact per optical time domain reflectometer (OTDR) analysis. With the I-10 Twin Span Bridge severely damaged, the causeway was used as a major route for recovery teams staying in lands to the north to get into New Orleans. The causeway reopened first to emergency traffic and then to the general public – with tolls suspended – on September 19, 2005. Tolls were reinstated by mid-October of that year.

The Lake Pontchartrain Causeway is one of seven highway spans in Louisiana with a total length of or more. The others are, in order from longest to shortest, the Manchac Swamp bridge on I-55, the Atchafalaya Basin Bridge on I-10, the Louisiana Highway 1 Bridge, the Bonnet Carré Spillway Bridge on I-10, the Chacahoula Swamp Bridge on U.S. 90, the Lake Pontchartrain Twin Spans on I-10, and the LaBranche Wetlands Bridge on I-310. The Maestri Bridge comes close, but runs short by two-tenths of a mile at roughly in total length. Louisiana is also home to the Norfolk Southern Lake Pontchartrain Bridge, which at is one of the longest railway bridges in the United States.

The southern end of the Manchac Swamp Bridge (on the western edge of Lake Pontchartrain) is the western end of the I-10 Bonnet Carré Spillway Bridge (on the southwestern edge of Lake Pontchartrain), and the northern end of the LaBranche Wetlands Bridge is the eastern end of the I-10 Bonnet Carré Spillway Bridge; so these three bridges, by name, are in fact one contiguous bridge. The total driving distance on continuous elevated roadway is over .

The bridge was designated as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2013.

=== &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; controversy ===
For decades Lake Pontchartrain Causeway was listed by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the longest bridge over water in the world. In July 2011 the Jiaozhou Bay Bridge in China was named by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the &#x27;longest bridge over water&#x27;. At that time there was some controversy in the United States as supporters of the former holder of the record, the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, disagreed with &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; not calling the causeway the longest. Supporters made this claim based on its own definition, i.e. the length of a bridge physically over water, and concluded that the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway spans , and was therefore the longest. The Jiaozhou Bay Bridge spans water for only . However, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, using the criteria of measurement that included aggregate structures, such as land bridges on the ends and an under-sea tunnel, stated that the Jiaozhou Bay Bridge is long. Following this controversy in July 2011, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; created two categories for bridges over water: continuous and aggregate lengths over water. Lake Pontchartrain Causeway then became the &quot;longest bridge over water (continuous)&quot;, while Jiaozhou Bay Bridge became the &quot;longest bridge over water (aggregate)&quot;.

<doc id="907753" wikidata="Q1400546" url="?curid=907753" title="Federico Peña">
<text>Federico Fabian Peña (born March 15, 1947) is an American politician and attorney who served as the 12th United States secretary of transportation from 1993 to 1997 and the 8th United States secretary of energy from 1997 to 1998, during the presidency of Bill Clinton. He previously served as the 41st mayor of Denver from 1983 to 1991.

==Early life==
Born in Laredo, Texas, Peña earned a Bachelor of Arts (1969) and Juris Doctor (1972) from the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Texas School of Law, respectively.

==Career==
Moving to Colorado, where he became a practicing attorney, Peña was elected to the Colorado House of Representatives as a Democrat in 1979, where he rose to become Minority Leader.

=== Mayor of Denver ===
In 1983, Peña defeated William H. McNichols Jr., a 74-year old incumbent, to become the first Hispanic mayor of Denver, a post to which he was re-elected in 1987. During his time as mayor in the late 1980s and early 1990s, he was instrumental in bringing the Colorado Rockies baseball team to Denver in 1993

=== Clinton administration ===
Peña advised Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton on transportation issues during Clinton&#x27;s presidential transition and thereafter Clinton chose Peña to head the United States Department of Transportation.

In 1995 the Justice Department conducted a preliminary investigation into a California transit agency&#x27;s awarding of a pension management contract to Peña&#x27;s former investment management firm. However, Peña had severed all ties to his former company both prior to the contract and prior to becoming Transportation Secretary. On March 17, 1995 Janet Reno ended the investigation.

Although he had intended to leave Clinton&#x27;s cabinet after a single term, Peña also served as secretary of energy from 1997 to 1998. During his 18-month tenure, Peña led an organization of 16,000 direct employees with a budget of $18 billion. He developed the Clinton administration&#x27;s Comprehensive National Energy Strategy and oversaw the largest privatization in the history of the U.S. Government—the $3.654 billion sale of the Elk Hills Oil Field, formerly known as Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 1. He crafted the Clinton Administration&#x27;s strategy for oil and gas development in the Caspian Sea region and supported U.S. energy companies&#x27; investments around the world.

===Later career===
Upon leaving the Clinton administration, Peña returned to Denver. In August 1998, he joined private equity firm Vestar Capital Partners where he is a senior advisor.

Peña Boulevard, a freeway in Denver and neighboring Aurora connecting Denver International Airport to Interstate 70, is named for him. As mayor of Denver, Peña led the effort to build the airport. In addition, Peña&#x27;s vision (&quot;Imagine a Great City&quot;) resulted in the revitalization of Denver economy with a new convention center, modernized Cherry Creek Shopping Center, neighborhood retail efforts, expanded library and performing arts center, and recruitment of the Colorado Rockies major league baseball team.

Peña is the father of three children: Nelia, Cristina, and Ryan Peña. The divorce of Federico Peña and his first wife, Ellen Hart Peña, became final on September 10, 2001. Federico Peña married Cindy Velasquez on September 2, 2006. Cindy Velasquez is a former broadcast executive for Channel 7, KMGH-TV, and Channel 9, KUSA-TV, in Denver, Colorado and has a daughter, Pilar.

Peña was a National Co-Chair of the COMPETE Coalition, an organization of energy stakeholders including large power generators, large retail power consumers and energy efficiency/smart grid groups. Today he serves on several corporate boards and is involved in several philanthropic organizations.

On September 7, 2007, Peña announced that he would endorse Senator Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election, and also serve as Obama&#x27;s National Campaign Co-chair. The move was notable in that Peña did not endorse Senator Hillary Clinton, the wife of the president under whom he served. On November 5, 2008, he was named to the advisory board of the Obama-Biden Transition Project.

On October 26, 2011, Peña was elected to serve as a member of the Board of Directors of Wells Fargo. Peña was appointed to the University of Denver Board of Trustees in June 2015.

<text>Mikel Laboa Mancisidor (15 June 1934 – 1 December 2008) was one of the Basque Country&#x27;s most important singer-songwriters.

Considered the patriarch of Basque music, his music has had an influence on younger generations. A testament to this is the tribute album &quot;Txerokee, Mikel Laboaren Kantak&quot; (&quot;Cherokee: Songs of Mikel Laboa&quot;), published in 1991 by various younger-generation rock and folk music groups. His album &quot;Bat-Hiru&quot; (&quot;One-Three&quot;) was chosen in a reader poll by the local &quot;Diario Vasco&quot; newspaper as the greatest Basque album in history. Nearly all of his songs are sung in Basque.

==Biography==
Mikel Laboa was born 15 June 1934 in Pasaia, Gipuzkoa.

He spent nearly two years of his childhood in the town of Lekeitio, Bizkaia. In the 1950s he studied medicine and psychiatry in Pamplona-Iruña. He would constantly balance his artistic career with his medical career, which began at the Children&#x27;s Neuropsychiatry unit at Patronato San Miguel in San Sebastián, where he worked for almost 20 years.

During his student years he became interested in music, influenced by artists such as Atahualpa Yupanqui and Violeta Parra. Following in their footsteps, Laboa would likewise identify himself as a &quot;political artist.&quot; In 1958 he made his debut at the Teatro Gayarre in Pamplona.

During the 1960s he, along with other Basque artists including singer Lourdes Iriondo, Xabier Lete and Benito Lertxundi, founded the cultural group &quot;Ez Dok Amairu&quot; (&quot;There is no 13&quot;), which in many ways sought to revitalize Basque culture, long dormant under the Francoist regime. They dedicated their focus on the revival and social status of the Basque language. Within this group Laboa came into his own, emerging along with Benito Lertxundi as a prime example of what was called &quot;new Basque music.&quot;

Laboa&#x27;s music can be described as a combination of tradition, poetry and experimentalism, in the songwriting style of the 1960s and 1970s, but endowed with a strong personal touch and a unique voice. His work combines old standards reinterpreted in modern style, lyrical poetry from authors such as Bertolt Brecht, and suitable compositions. Deserving special mention are his &quot;Lekeitioak&quot;, experimental songs based on shouts and onomatopoetic sounds.
Laboa was a creative force for 35 years, continuing well into his old age until his fragile health kept him away from the stage. He would collaborate often with jazz musician Iñaki Salvador and worked with the Orfeón Donostiarra and other orchestral groups from the Basque Country. Some of his most well-known songs are featured in &quot;La pelota vasca&quot; (&quot;The Basque ball&quot;), a documentary by Julio Medem. On 11 July 2006 he gave his final performance, opening for Bob Dylan at a &quot;Concert for Peace&quot; held in the city of Donostia-San Sebastián.

A curious feature of his album titles is the fact that they are numeric. This custom began in 1974 with the release of his two-disc &quot;Bat-Hiru&quot; (1–3). The album &quot;2&quot;, with songs based on the writings of Brecht, had been banned by Francoist censorship. This was followed by the double LP &quot;Lau-Bost&quot; (4–5) and &quot;6&quot;. His &quot;Lekeitios&quot; comprised albums 7 through 11, although only a compilation of these was released through low-key marketing. These were followed by &quot;12&quot;, and Laboa skipped number 13 in homage to the group &quot;Ez Dok Amairu&quot;, whose name means &quot;There&#x27;s no 13&quot; in Basque. Afterwards, he released &quot;14&quot;, and his live albums &quot;15&quot; and &quot;16&quot;. Not including compilations and posthumous editions, his last release was &quot;17&quot; (&quot;Xoriek&quot;).

His final collaboration was with the Pasaia group &quot;Naizroxa&quot;, where he contributed to the first and only song on the first disc, &quot;Iqharaturic.&quot;

Mikel Laboa died 1 December 2008 at a hospital in Donostia-San Sebastián at the age of 74.

<text>Sint Anna ter Muiden is a small city in the province of Zeeland, Netherlands. It is administratively a part of municipality of Sluis, and the town of Sluis lies about 1 km east. It is located on the westernmost point of the Netherlands (excluding the kingdom&#x27;s other countries and its special municipalities). It has a population of 50 (as of 2001).

Sint Anna ter Muiden was granted city rights in 1242 by the counts of Flanders, Thomas II of Savoy and Jeanne of Flanders. This makes it today the second smallest place in the Netherlands that bears this traditional designation (after Staverden with just 40 inhabitants).

Sint Anna ter Muiden was a separate municipality until 1880, when it was merged with Sluis. Prior to 1 January 2003, it was in the former municipality of Sluis-Aardenburg.

<doc id="907761" wikidata="Q14071448" url="?curid=907761" title="Piers Haggard">
<text>Piers Inigo Haggard, OBE (18 March 1939 – 11 January 2023) was a British director who worked in film, television, and theatre.

==Early life==
A member of the Haggard family, he was born in London, the son of Morna Gillespie and the actor, poet, and novelist Stephen Haggard. He was the great-great-nephew of the writer Sir Henry Rider Haggard.

At the age of one, Haggard was evacuated with his mother and older brother Paul to New York where his paternal grandfather Godfrey Haggard was the British consul-general. Shortly after they left, his father wrote his sons a letter, which later that year was published in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; as &quot;I&#x27;ll Go to Bed at Noon: A Soldier&#x27;s Letter to His Sons&quot;. Haggard and his mother returned to Britain after his brother&#x27;s death from diphtheria. There a younger brother, Mark, was born.

His father was a captain in the British Intelligence Corps. Sent to Egypt, he had an affair with a married woman, and when she broke off the affair, he committed suicide in 1943. In 1946, Haggard’s mother remarried and the family moved to Muckhart Mill Farm in Clackmannanshire, Scotland. He attended school at Dollar Academy, and between 1956 and 1960 studied English at Edinburgh University. While there, he was active in the dramatic society as an actor and director, and helped found the Festival Fringe Society in 1958.

==Career==
Haggard began his career as an assistant director at the Royal Court in 1960. In 1961, he was director of productions at the Dundee Rep including directing the pantomime &quot;Cinderella&quot; which was described by &quot;The Stage&quot; as “the best pantomime Dundee has seen in many years”. In 1962, he moved to the Glasgow Citizens, where productions included Albert Finney as Luigi Pirandello&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV&quot;. He joined the first National Theatre company in 1963, where he co-directed with John Dexter and Bill Gaskill and assisted Laurence Olivier (1963 on &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;, starring Michael Redgrave) and Franco Zeffirelli (1965 on &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, with Maggie Smith and Robert Stephens).

In 1965, he moved to BBC Television, directing plays for the anthology drama series &quot;Thirty-Minute Theatre&quot; and episodes of series such as The Newcomers, and &quot;Play for Today&quot; for the BBC, as well as &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot;, &quot;Callan&quot;, &quot;Man at the Top&quot; and &quot;Public Eye&quot; for ITV. He directed for a variety of programmes throughout the 1970s, such as &quot;The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, Churchill&#x27;s People&quot;,&quot; &quot;The Love School&quot;, &quot;Love for Lydia&quot; and &quot;Play of the Month: The Chester Mystery Plays&quot; (1976).

In 1978, Haggard was hired by producer Kenith Trodd to direct Dennis Potter&#x27;s BBC drama serial &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot;, which received a BAFTA.. The following year, he directed the science-fiction serial &quot;Quatermass&quot;, a Euston Films production for Thames Television, which was shown on the ITV network. 

Returning to the National Theatre in 1981, he directed Tom Taylor’s play &quot;The Ticket-of-Leave Man&quot; and the next year, at the Piccadilly Theatre, directed the Norwegian ‘opera-musical’ &quot;Which Witch&quot;, for which he worked on the libretto. For television, he directed two Alan Bennett plays &quot;Marks&quot; and &quot;Rolling Home&quot; (1982), &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1985), Dennis Potter&#x27;s &quot;Visitors&quot; (1987), and Jack Rosenthal’s &quot;Eskimo Day&quot; (1996) and &quot;Cold Enough for Snow&quot; (1997).

In 1966, Haggard began his film career working as an interpreter for Michelangelo Antonioni on the British-Italian film &quot;Blowup&quot;. His feature film debut was &quot;Wedding Night&quot; (1970). The producers of &quot;The Blood on Satan&#x27;s Claw&quot; (1970) attended a screening of &quot;Wedding Night&quot; and offered the job of director to him. He also directed the cinema version of &quot;Quatermass&quot; (1980)&quot;;&quot; &quot;Summer Story&quot; (1988); &quot;The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu&quot; (1980), Peter Sellers&#x27; last film; and &quot;Venom&quot; (1982). Haggard&#x27;s audio commentary on &quot;Venom&quot; is well known for its forthrightness, and some hilarious anecdotes on the competitive antics of stars Oliver Reed and Klaus Kinski. 

Later television work included &quot;Mrs Reinhardt (1986)&quot;; a number of US TV Specials with stars such as Liza Minnelli, Cheryl Ladd and Judge Reinhold; the Gerry Anderson science-fiction series &quot;Space Precinct&quot; (1994); and various one-off TV dramas such as &quot;The Hunt&quot; (2001). The Canadian prairies-set &quot;Conquest&quot; (1998) was his last feature film. He directed Academy Award winners Vanessa Redgrave and Maximilian Schell in the 2006 mini-series &quot;The Shell Seekers&quot;.

Haggard campaigned for directors&#x27; rights. He was president of The Association of Directors and Producers in 1976; he founded and was first chairman of the Directors Guild of Great Britain (DGGB), formed in 1982 at a meeting of over a hundred film, theatre, and television directors at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club in London. He started the Directors’ and Producers&#x27; Rights Society (DPRS, 1987), serving on its board for 20 years, until it transmuted in 2007 into Directors UK, where he served on the board until 2017. He was also vice president and chairman of FERA, the Association of European film directors, from 2010 to 2013.

It has been claimed that Haggard invented the term &#x27;folk horror&#x27;.This appears not to be the case (though the term was invented in regard to his film &quot;Blood on Satan&#x27;s Claw&quot;), but his use of it in a 2004 interview in &quot;Fangoria&quot; magazine does appear to have popularised the term.

== Personal life ==
Haggard had four children by his first marriage, to Christiane Stokes: Sarah, Claire, Rachel and Philip. The couple married in 1960 and later divorced. In 1972, Haggard married stained glass artist Anna Sklovsky, with whom he had two children: actress Daisy Haggard and architect William Haggard.

Haggard was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to film, television and theatre. 

Haggard died on 11 January 2023, at the age of 83.

<text>The Albanian Air Force ( - Air Force of the Republic of Albania) is the air force of Albania and one of the branches of the Albanian Armed Forces.

== History ==

===Early history===

In 1914 the government of Albania ordered three &quot;Lohner&quot; Daimler aircraft from Austria to form an air force. As a result of the outbreak of World War I, the order was cancelled. Albania did not have the resources to start the development of a proper Air Force during the 1920s and 1930s. After the establishment of the Albanian Kingdom in 1928, King Zog formed the Royal Albanian Air Corps under the direction of the Royal Albanian Army.

The Royal Air Force, and the rest of Albanian armed forces, were abolished following the Italian invasion of Albania.

===Socialist Albania===
After World War II, the Albanian Air Force finally came into existence on 24 April 1951 when Albania was equipped with Soviet aircraft. The first squadron was equipped with Yakovlev Yak-9s. The first jet fighter to enter service was the MiG-15, entering service on 15 May 1955, followed by the MiG-17. Some of the MiG-15s were Soviet fighters used and then withdrawn from the North Korean Air Force. The MiG-19 (NATO code &quot;Farmer&quot;) became the backbone of the Albanian Air Force. 12 MiG-19PM were delivered by the USSR in October 1959 and in the same year pilots and specialists were sent in the USSR to obtain training for the new aircraft. An academy was founded in Vlorë in 1962. Albania cut diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union in 1962, leading to a shift to China for the supply of necessary parts to maintain its MiGs. After the collapse of USSR-Albanian relations, significant numbers of Shenyang J-6 fighters (Chinese copy of the MiG-19S), were acquired from China. In the early 1970s, Albania exchanged its lot of MiG-19PM fighters with 12 more advanced, Chengdu J-7A fighters (Chinese copy of the Soviet-built MiG-21). Two of them were lost in incidents in the early 1970s and eight had problems with lack of batteries in the early 1980s.

In total, during the 70s and early 80s, the equipment of the Albanian Air Force consisted of 142 Shenyang J-6Cs, 12 Chengdu J-7As, a fighter squadron equipped with MiG-17s, a considerable number of MiG-15 (both &quot;BIS&quot; and &quot;UTI&quot; versions), and 4 Soviet-made Il-14 transport aircraft. A squadron of Shijiazhuang Y-5 was deployed in Tirana and the &quot;Air Force Academy&quot; in Vlora had two squadrons of Yak-18 for basic pilot training purposes. The helicopter component consisted in 18 Harbin Z-5 (Chinese copy of Mil Mi-4) helicopters based in &quot;Farka&quot; Tirana, meanwhile there was a single prototype of a light H-5 bomber based in &quot;Rinas&quot;.

Due to the collapse of relations between Albania and the Chinese, maintenance became extremely difficult and the number of deadly incidents involving Mikoyan fighters increased. Despite Albanian efforts and some initial success in repairing the engines of the MiGs, the lack of specific jet fuel forced authorities to start production locally, resulting in low-quality production (the first attempt was in 1961, when the &quot;Kuçova&quot; factory produced the special jet fuel (a derivative of kerosene called &quot;TSI&quot;). The fuel shortened the lifespan of the jet engines and was often blamed as the main reason for several deadly incidents. 35 Albanian pilots lost their lives from 1955 to 2005, mainly due to mechanical failures with the MiG aircraft.

===Recent history===

Following the fall of communism in Albania in 1990, the air force had 200 jets and 40 helicopters, and four Il-14 transport planes. In the early 1990s, 7594 Regiment became Aviation Regiment 4020, seemingly with its 1st Squadron of fighter aircraft and 2nd Squadron of FT-5s, and Y-5s (Antonov An-2s). During the 1997 uprising in Albania, seven aircraft of the airforce were destroyed and their parts were stolen. In the early 90s, in an effort to keep the fighter jets flying, the Albanian Air Force received spare parts from Bulgaria and engines from the ex-GDR. By 2004, Albania still had 117 J-6C aircraft, (although most were not operational) and only 12 J-7A. The Albanian fighter jets were finally withdrawn from active service in late 2004 after the last deadly incident involving a J-6C which crashed during take-off from the military area at &quot;Mother Teresa Airport&quot; in Tirana.

By 2006, Albania had scrapped over half of its Z-5s and had signed a contract for the delivery of six Bolkow 105s over three years. This acquisition allowed air force to operate with 4 Y-5s, 7 B206s, 3 B205s, 6 Bolkow 105s. Currently, the Albanian Air Brigade does not operate any Soviet-era aircraft. Since 2011, 9 Shijiazhuang Y-5 have been retired from service. In 2011, the air force sold four Il-14 transport planes for scrap.

In 2016, 40 retired Albanian military aircraft were prepared for auction at a future date. The aircraft for sale include a military trainer aircraft, the Yak-18, and four types of military jets – MiG-15s, MiG-17s, MiG-19s, and MiG-21s – and four Mi-4 transport helicopters. The government said there has been interest from collectors and museums, and that it will sell another 100 jets if the auction is successful. The funds generated will be used to further modernise the Air Force.

== Equipment ==
=== Aircraft ===
The Albanian Air Force has retired all of its fixed-wing aircraft and now operates several types of helicopters.



=== Radars ===
, Albania Air Force operates a AN/FPS-117 Long-range radar system on Mida mountain , which was a joint investment of Albania and the US through Lockheed Martin with $19 million coming from Albania and $3 million from the US. The radar is integrated into the NATO Integrated Air Defense System.


== Structure ==
The air force&#x27;s headquarters is located in Tirana and it operates three airbases: Tirana Air Base with the national Control and Reporting Centre, which reports to NATO&#x27;s Integrated Air Defense System CAOC Torrejón in Spain, Kuçovë Air Base, and Lapraka Air Base, home to the government&#x27;s transport helicopters.

<doc id="907777" wikidata="Q1092066" url="?curid=907777" title="If I Should Fall from Grace with God">
<text>If I Should Fall from Grace with God is the third studio album by Celtic folk-punk band the Pogues, released on 18 January 1988. Released in the wake of their biggest hit single, &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot;, &quot;If I Should Fall from Grace with God&quot; also became the band&#x27;s best-selling album, peaking at number three on the UK Albums Chart and reaching the top ten in several other countries.

&quot;If I Should Fall from Grace with God&quot; saw the arrival of three new members: bassist Darryl Hunt replaced Cait O&#x27;Riordan, while Philip Chevron joined on guitar and Terry Woods played cittern and other instruments. Woods and Chevron (the only two members of The Pogues actually born in Ireland) contributed the first original songs to a Pogues album not written by singer Shane MacGowan or banjo player Jem Finer, and the album also saw the band begin to move away from their Irish folk/punk roots and start to incorporate musical styles from other parts of the world, most notably Turkey and Spain. Many of the songs&#x27; lyrics return to familiar themes in Pogues songs, such as emigration from Ireland or returning to the country and having to adapt to the changes that have taken place after a long absence, but other tracks dwell on Irish political history or protecting children from the issues encountered as adults.

Critically acclaimed, &quot;If I Should Fall from Grace with God&quot; marked the high point of the band&#x27;s commercial success. Finer called the record &quot;a very cohesive album that drew on a lot of styles. Everything came together and it was very focused. That [album is] really the creative peak for me, in terms of the whole band being on a wavelength.&quot;

==Background==
The Pogues had received acclaim for their previous album &quot;Rum Sodomy &amp; the Lash&quot;, released in August 1985, and had begun 1986 on a high note as they embarked upon a successful tour of the US, their first in that country, and released the &quot;Poguetry in Motion&quot; EP which became their first top 40 hit in the UK. However, the relationship with their producer Elvis Costello was deteriorating, and tensions were further heightened by his romantic involvement with the band&#x27;s bass player Cait O&#x27;Riordan. The group parted ways with Costello, and after increasingly erratic behaviour which included not turning up to play shows, O&#x27;Riordan also left the band in October 1986. During this period The Pogues&#x27; record label Stiff Records went into administration: as the label still owned the rights to all Pogues recordings, the group were unable to record any new material until they were released from their contract with Stiff. During 1986, the group occupied themselves by guesting on a cover version of &quot;The Irish Rover&quot; with the Dubliners, and taking part in Alex Cox&#x27;s comedy action film &quot;Straight to Hell&quot;, shot in southern Spain and also starring the Clash&#x27;s frontman Joe Strummer.

The situation with Stiff was resolved in early 1987 and The Pogues were finally free to begin recording a new album. After recording some demos in Abbey Road Studios in March, the group entered London&#x27;s RAK Studios on 9 May 1987 to begin work properly on their delayed third album. The band had chosen Darryl Hunt, a former bandmate of O&#x27;Riordan in Pride of the Cross, as her replacement on bass, and multi-instrumentalist Terry Woods (ex-Steeleye Span) was also brought in to add his expertise on a range of instruments. Phil Chevron, who had deputised for Jem Finer on banjo on a previous Pogues tour while Finer had taken a break to be with his wife and new-born child, was recruited full-time to the band as its permanent guitarist after frontman Shane MacGowan had decided he wanted to concentrate solely on singing in live performance.

The group had decided to use Steve Lillywhite to produce their new record. Finer later said, &quot;I think it was as exciting for him as it was for us because he&#x27;d never worked with a band live in the studio&quot;.

==Composition and writing==
The title for &quot;Turkish Song of the Damned&quot; actually came first and inspired the song&#x27;s storyline and the music&#x27;s Middle Eastern influence, rather than the other way round, as Chevron revealed to the &quot;NME&quot;: &quot;We were in Germany and this magazine had an article about The Damned – the B-side of one of their singles is called &#x27;The Turkey Song&#x27; [the B-side of their 1979 single &quot;I Just Can&#x27;t Be Happy Today&quot;] but the mag called it &#x27;The Turkish Song of the Damned&#x27; – it was too good a title to overlook&quot;. MacGowan explained the lyrics as being a mixture of pirate and ghost story &quot;about a guy on a Turkish island who deserted a sinking ship with all the money and all his mates went down – I&#x27;m not totally sure about this – he&#x27;s haunted and he&#x27;s dancing around with all this Turkish music in his brain ... Then his best mate comes back, and all the crew, to drag him back down to hell or wherever they are.&quot; The song ends with a rendition of the traditional Irish jig &quot;The Lark in the Morning&quot;.

&quot;Bottle of Smoke&quot; is the story of an imaginary horse of that name that goes on to win the Cheltenham Gold Cup, winning the song&#x27;s narrator a large sum of money after he bets on the horse at long odds. MacGowan called it &quot;the sort of weird impossible name that always wins a race&quot;.

&quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; remains The Pogues&#x27; best-known and best-selling single. It was named after J.P. Donleavy&#x27;s 1973 novel &quot;A Fairy Tale of New York&quot; which Finer had been reading in the studio when the song was first written. The song dated back to 1985 when Finer had written the original melody and lyrics, about a sailor looking out over the ocean, but he admitted that his lyrics had been terrible and MacGowan had come up with a better storyline of a couple arguing in New York City at Christmas time. MacGowan had always intended the song to be sung as a duet, originally with O&#x27;Riordan providing the female vocal part, but despite attempts to record &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; in January 1986 during the sessions for &quot;Poguetry in Motion&quot;, the band were unhappy with the results and abandoned the song. During the sessions for the third album at RAK in May 1987, MacGowan recorded new guide vocals for the song but with O&#x27;Riordan&#x27;s departure it now had no female vocalist. Lillywhite took the tapes home and recorded his singer-songwriter wife Kirsty MacColl singing the female lines: when he brought them back to the studio The Pogues were so impressed that the song was re-recorded with MacColl as the replacement singing partner for MacGowan. &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single in November 1987 in the run-up to Christmas and reached number one in Ireland and number two in the UK. Its enduring popularity has seen it re-enter the charts several times since 1987, eventually going on to sell over a million copies in the UK and being voted the most popular Christmas-themed song of all time.

Despite never being released as a single, the track &quot;Thousands Are Sailing&quot; has since become one of The Pogues&#x27; most popular songs, and according to &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, it is &quot;recognised as one of the finest songs about Irish emigration&quot;. It was written by the band&#x27;s new guitarist Chevron, and although he had written many songs before as the frontman of his previous band the Radiators, he admitted that for a long time he had felt unsure about putting his song forward for consideration as MacGowan was the recognised songwriter in the band. It was only when Terry Woods offered to help him out with the track and MacGowan showed his approval of the song that Chevron gained the confidence to complete it. Featuring what has been described as a &quot;heartfelt lyric, soaring tune and compelling chorus on the theme of emigration from Ireland to America&quot;, &quot;Thousands Are Sailing&quot; inspired the 2012 Derek McCullough graphic novel &quot;Gone to Amerikay&quot;. Although Chevron also contributed other songs to later Pogues albums, &quot;Thousands Are Sailing&quot; remains his most popular composition, and it was played at his funeral when he died of cancer in October 2013.

&quot;Fiesta&quot; was inspired by a riotous party, which lasted for several days, that the band had during their stay in southern Spain while filming &quot;Straight to Hell&quot;. Finer based the melody of the song on a fairground-style tune played by fast-food stalls which the band kept hearing everywhere in Spain, and which Finer said he found it impossible to get out of his head. The chorus of &quot;Fiesta&quot; also contains elements of &quot;Liechtensteiner Polka&quot;, written by Edmund Kötscher and Rudi Lindt, and on later Pogues compilation albums they are given co-writing credits. &quot;Fiesta&quot; includes a verse in Spanish which adapts four lines from Federico Lorca&#x27;s poem and changes the name of the character to &quot;Jaime Fearnley&quot;, the Spanish version of the name of the Pogues&#x27; accordion player James Fearnley. The verse also namechecks Elvis Costello (described as &quot;el rey de America&quot;, a reference to his 1986 album &quot;King of America&quot;) and Cait O&#x27;Riordan. The date at the start of the verse changes Lorca&#x27;s original date of 25 June to 25 August, which happens to be Costello&#x27;s birthday.

The song &quot;Streets of Sorrow&quot;/&quot;Birmingham Six&quot; is the album&#x27;s most explicitly political commentary. The first half is a ballad composed and sung by Woods about the life of Irish independence leader Michael Collins. It was originally a much longer standalone song, but the band felt it would work better as a shorter introduction to MacGowan&#x27;s more uptempo second half of the song, which is about the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four, two groups of Irish people imprisoned in the UK for terrorism offences. Their sentences were later found to be unsafe, and the Guildford Four had their convictions quashed and were released in 1989, followed by the Birmingham Six in 1991. The song also makes a passing reference to the Loughgall Martyrs, with the line &quot;while over in Ireland eight more men lay dead, kicked down and shot in the back of the head&quot;. MacGowan reflected, &quot;It&#x27;s about &quot;anybody&quot; in that situation, getting locked away without any real evidence ... Basically it&#x27;s a prison song about someone pacing round his cell or round the yard wondering what the fuck it&#x27;s all about ... It&#x27;s a depressing song – it&#x27;s not a song that I enjoyed writing or find much pleasure in singing.&quot;

MacGowan described &quot;Lullaby of London&quot; as being about a man who comes home at night drunk and proceeds to start telling his young son, who is in bed, about how everything is going to be fine and to go to sleep, while privately the man is worried and hoping that the child will not have to go through the same hardships that he did while growing up.

&quot;Sit Down by the Fire&quot; is about &quot;the old ghost stories people used to tell you in Ireland before you went to bed. They used to tell you some horrific stories to prepare you for the horrors of the world ahead.&quot;

&quot;The Broad Majestic Shannon&quot; is named after the longest river in Ireland and, according to MacGowan, is a song about an Irishman returning to his home town in County Tipperary after many years of living in London, and finding that everything about the place he grew up in has changed or disappeared. MacGowan revealed that he had written the song with former Clancy Brothers members Liam Clancy and Tommy Makem in mind, in the hope that they would record a version of it.

==Release==
The compact disc version of &quot;If I Should Fall from Grace with God&quot; contained two extra tracks not included on the vinyl LP or cassette versions: a cover of the traditional song &quot;South Australia&quot; and the instrumental &quot;The Battle March Medley&quot;.

The alternative album cover, issued in the United States and Canada, is a collage of faked photos of the group&#x27;s members standing in a line, in which each of their faces have been superimposed onto a shot of Irish author James Joyce. The original unedited picture of Joyce appears fourth from the left in the line.

==Critical reception==
&quot;If I Should Fall from Grace with God&quot; was well received by critics. In the UK the &quot;NME&quot; lauded the record; Terry Staunton&#x27;s review for the magazine stated, &quot;&quot;If I Should Fall from Grace with God&quot; sees The Pogues venturing towards the area occupied by the latter day Madness, troubled words on top of happy tunes, stormclouds casting shadows across forced smiles ... With their new LP, The Pogues have given us a thing of beauty, the bleakest of masterpieces which will find few equals in 1988.&quot; Neil Perry of &quot;Sounds&quot; wrote that &quot;within the grooves of &quot;Grace&quot;, the third Pogues LP, you get heaven and hell and everything in between. If you&#x27;ve ever viewed The Pogues as a quaint rabble-rousing cult band then think again, for this is a record of rare quality and seductive charm.&quot; In &quot;Q&quot;, David Sinclair described the album as &quot;old-style Pogues, as dependably garrulous and irreverent as ever, but the album also advances on new fronts with a gleeful sense of adventure&quot;. &quot;Record Mirror&quot;″s Eleanor Levy said that the band had added &quot;depth to their &#x27;Irish Rover&#x27; charm&quot; and produced &quot;quite simply, the most lively, enjoyable &#x27;good time&#x27; album you will have heard this, or any, year.&quot; &quot;Melody Maker&quot; was the only UK music paper to give the album a negative appraisal, with reviewer David Stubbs being fiercely critical of the idea that traditional Irish music should be mixed with rock music, before saying, &quot;so far removed is this album from my constituency that I feel scarcely qualified to review it at all&quot;.

The reaction from US critics was also very positive. Kurt Loder wrote in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that &quot;obviously the Pogues can do it all. And it sounds as if they&#x27;ve only just begun.&quot; Michael Corcoran of &quot;Spin&quot; stated that &quot;it&#x27;s got guts and soul, and will make poor people dance until 4 a.m., even if they have to be at work until 7 a.m.&quot; and that despite containing a few songs that could be skipped over, &quot;this LP on cassette will cause more wear on the rewind button than on the fast forward&quot;. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau said that &quot;neither pop nor rock nor disco crossover stays these groghounds from the swift accomplishment of their appointed rounds&quot;.

Reviewing the 2004 reissue, &quot;Mojo&quot;″s Pat Gilbert called &quot;If I Should Fall from Grace with God&quot; &quot;an amazingly original, democratically written and ethnically adventurous album&quot;. AllMusic reviewer Mark Deming considered it &quot;the best album the Pogues would ever make&quot;.

In 2006, &quot;Q&quot; placed &quot;If I Should Fall from Grace with God&quot; at number 37 on its list of the &quot;40 Best Albums of the &#x27;80s&quot;. The record was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, and was ranked number 975 in the 2000 edition of the book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.
