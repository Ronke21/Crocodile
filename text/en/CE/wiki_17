<text>Francis William Leahy (August 27, 1908 – June 21, 1973) was an American college football player and coach, college athletics administrator, and professional sports executive. He served as the head football coach at Boston College from 1939 to 1940 and at the University of Notre Dame from 1941 to 1943 and again from 1946 to 1953, compiling a career college football record of 107–13–9. His winning percentage of .864 is the second best in NCAA Division I football history, trailing only that of fellow Notre Dame Fighting Irish coach Knute Rockne, for whom Leahy played from 1928 to 1930. Leahy played on two Notre Dame teams that won national championships, in 1929 and 1930, and coached four more, in 1943, 1946, 1947, and 1949. Leahy was also the athletic director at Notre Dame from 1947 until 1949 when he passed the role to the Fighting Irish basketball coach Moose Krause so that he could focus on football coaching. Leahy served as the general manager for the Los Angeles Chargers of the American Football League (AFL) during their inaugural season in 1960. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1970.

==Early life and playing career==
Leahy was born in O&#x27;Neill, Nebraska and graduated from Winner High School in Winner, South Dakota where he was a football standout. He attended the University of Notre Dame, where he played football as a tackle on Knute Rockne&#x27;s last three teams (1928–1930) and was part of the 1929 and 1930 National champion teams. Leahy graduated from the university in 1931.

==Coaching career==

===Assistant coaching===
Leahy went to Georgetown University as line coach in 1931 and Michigan State the following year to take a similar position. Leahy took over as line coach at Fordham University in 1933 and stayed until 1938 under Jim Crowley, coaching the famed Seven Blocks of Granite from 1935 to 1937 when the Rams lost only two games in three seasons. The undersized right guard on the 1935 and 1936 teams was future coaching legend Vince Lombardi.

===Boston College===
In 1939, Leahy went to Boston College as head coach, guiding the Eagles to a 20–2 record including an undefeated 1940 season capped off with a win in the 1941 Sugar Bowl. At Boston College, he tried relentlessly to recruit future beat author Jack Kerouac.

Although he had recently signed a contract renewal at Boston College, Leahy accepted the head coaching position at his alma mater Notre Dame. He tried without success to get out of his BC contract. He pleaded with the school&#x27;s vice president. When that did not work, he went to the mayor of Boston and the governor of Massachusetts. Then, at a press conference, he told 50 reporters what the &quot;South Bend Tribune&quot; called &quot;the biggest lie of his life&quot;. Leahy stated: &quot;Gentlemen I&#x27;ve called you all here today to inform you that I recently received my release from my coaching contract. With the release went the good wishes and benediction of Boston College.&quot; Leahy stepped away, and the buzzing group of reporters battled for phone lines. A phone call came in for Leahy, and he took it. The vice president of Boston College was on the line. &quot;Coach Leahy,&quot; he barked. &quot;You may go wherever you want, and whenever you want. Good-bye.&quot;

===Notre Dame===

Leahy&#x27;s tenure as head coach at his alma mater began the next season. His impact was felt right away as the Irish posted an 8–0–1 mark in 1941. The following season, he caused an uproar when he abandoned Rockne&#x27;s box formation and installed the T. After a 7–2–2 season in 1942, Leahy led Notre Dame to a national championship in 1943 despite losing the season finale against Great Lakes Navy by a score of 19–14. He entered the Navy in 1944 and was discharged as a lieutenant. He returned to Notre Dame for the 1946 season in which Notre Dame shared the national championship after playing rival Earl Blaik&#x27;s Army team to a scoreless tie at Yankee Stadium in New York. National championships followed in 1947 and 1949, with only a 14–14 tie against USC in the season finale marring a perfect season in 1948 and another possible national title. It was regarded by many as the most successful run in Notre Dame history and Leahy appeared to be well on his way of meeting his goal of ten consecutive seasons without a loss. Then with most of the wartime talent gone from the scene, the Irish fell to 4–4–1 in 1950. Scholarships had been reduced from 33 to 18 per year in 1948 when other teams, tired of getting beaten year in and year out, began dropping Notre Dame from their schedules. Consequently, the talent level had dropped off drastically. Leahy is one of only two coaches in college football history to have won multiple national championships at the same school during two different tenures, joining Tennessee&#x27;s Robert Neyland.

Scholarships were increased afterwards, and the situation improved. Aided by freshman eligibility brought on by the Korean War, Notre Dame finished 7–2–1 in 1951 and 1952 while the 1953 squad, Leahy&#x27;s last, posted a 9–0–1 docket. A controversial 14–14 tie against Iowa denied the Irish another consensus national championship, although ten other selectors chose the Irish for the title. However, Notre Dame does not recognize this national championship. The controversy over the tie with Iowa stemmed from the fact that both of Notre Dame&#x27;s touchdowns, one late in the first half and the other late in the game, came after a player had faked an injury. In both instances, Notre Dame had used up their allotment of time outs, and under normal circumstances, time would have expired in each half before they could run another play. Faking an injury was a widely used ploy in football as a means of buying time, but in most cases there was no impact on the outcome of a game. In Notre Dame&#x27;s case, the Irish used this ruse not once but twice in the same game, and both times they managed to score touchdowns. A new rule was implemented the following year forbidding players from faking injuries, and many saw this as punishment directed at Notre Dame, who were branded as the &quot;Fainting Irish.&quot;

There was some concern about Leahy&#x27;s health when he collapsed from a pancreatic attack in the locker room during halftime of the 1953 Georgia Tech game. A priest allegedly gave Leahy the last rites of the Catholic Church when it was feared he was dying. Leahy resigned on January 31, 1954, with two years remaining on his contract. Supposedly he had been ordered to give up coaching by his doctors for the sake of his health, but he later revealed that he left because he felt he was no longer wanted. Leahy was succeeded by Terry Brennan, ushering in a downward slide for Notre Dame&#x27;s football fortunes for the next decade.

While at Notre Dame, Leahy had six undefeated seasons, four national championship teams, and an unbeaten string of 39 games (37–0–2) in the late 1940s. He also coached four Heisman Trophy winners—Angelo Bertelli (1943), Johnny Lujack (1947), Leon Hart (1949) and Johnny Lattner (1953)—and recruited a fifth, 1956 winner, Paul Hornung. His overall record at Notre Dame was 87–11–9. Like his former coach Rockne, Leahy believed that games were won in practice, and he had the reputation of being a relentless taskmaster. It is said that Leahy&#x27;s teams never had a practice without hitting and that his quarterbacks would catch snaps every practice until their hands bled. His teams were always well conditioned and Leahy was merciless when it came to the toughness of his players. In addition to his practices, Leahy coached a tough-nosed style of football during the games. Leahy&#x27;s teams rarely kicked field goals when they were on the goal line because &quot;Notre Dame didn&#x27;t kick field goals, Notre Dame was too tough to kick field goals.&quot; This philosophy backfired against Army in 1946, when the Irish drove all the way to the Cadets&#x27; 4-yard line and turned the ball over on downs. A field goal would have won the game. Leahy always referred to his players as his &quot;lads.&quot;

In 1949, he wrote a book on the T-formation, &quot;Notre Dame Football: The &quot;T&quot; Formation&quot;.

==Later life==
Leahy served as general manager for the Los Angeles Chargers during their inaugural 1960 season in the American Football League. He was selected to the National Football Foundation Hall of Fame in 1970. Leahy moved to the Portland, Oregon suburb of Lake Oswego in 1963, where he worked as an executive in a vending machine company until his death from congestive heart failure in Portland in 1973. Leahy was married to the former Florence Reilly in 1935; she survived him in death. They had eight children. Their son Jim and grandson Ryan played football at Notre Dame.

For his contribution to sports in Los Angeles, he was honored with a Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum &quot;Court of Honor&quot; plaque by the Coliseum commissioners.

==Quotes==
* &quot;When the going gets tough, let the tough get going.&quot;
* &quot;Egotism is the anesthetic that dulls the pain of stupidity.&quot; (Note: Leahy attributes this saying to Knute Rockne in Leahy&#x27;s book, &quot;Notre Dame Football - The T Formation&quot;. It was not actually Leahy&#x27;s quote.) 
* &quot;There are no such things as overachievers; only underachievers to different degrees.&quot;
* &quot;A spoonful of humor makes the message go down easier.&quot;

<doc id="908703" wikidata="Q6060409" url="?curid=908703" title="Inverse probability">
<text>In probability theory, inverse probability is an old term for the probability distribution of an unobserved variable.

Today, the problem of determining an unobserved variable (by whatever method) is called inferential statistics. The method of inverse probability (assigning a probability distribution to an unobserved variable) is called Bayesian probability, the distribution of data given the unobserved variable is the likelihood function (which does not by itself give a probability distribution for the parameter), and the distribution of an unobserved variable, given both data and a prior distribution, is the posterior distribution. The development of the field and terminology from &quot;inverse probability&quot; to &quot;Bayesian probability&quot; is described by .
The term &quot;inverse probability&quot; appears in an 1837 paper of De Morgan, in reference to Laplace&#x27;s method of probability (developed in a 1774 paper, which independently discovered and popularized Bayesian methods, and a 1812 book), though the term &quot;inverse probability&quot; does not occur in these. Fisher uses the term in , referring to &quot;the fundamental paradox of inverse probability&quot; as the source of the confusion between statistical terms that refer to the true value to be estimated, with the actual value arrived at by the estimation method, which is subject to error. Later Jeffreys uses the term in his defense of the methods of Bayes and Laplace, in . The term &quot;Bayesian&quot;, which displaced &quot;inverse probability&quot;, was introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1950. Inverse probability, variously interpreted, was the dominant approach to statistics until the development of frequentism in the early 20th century by Ronald Fisher, Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson. Following the development of frequentism, the terms frequentist and Bayesian developed to contrast these approaches, and became common in the 1950s.

== Details ==
In modern terms, given a probability distribution &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;|θ) for an observable quantity &quot;x&quot; conditional on an unobserved variable θ, the &quot;inverse probability&quot; is the posterior distribution &quot;p&quot;(θ|&quot;x&quot;), which depends both on the likelihood function (the inversion of the probability distribution) and a prior distribution. The distribution &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;|θ) itself is called the direct probability.

The &quot;inverse probability problem&quot; (in the 18th and 19th centuries) was the problem of estimating a parameter from experimental data in the experimental sciences, especially astronomy and biology. A simple example would be the problem of estimating the position of a star in the sky (at a certain time on a certain date) for purposes of navigation. Given the data, one must estimate the true position (probably by averaging). This problem would now be considered one of inferential statistics.

The terms &quot;direct probability&quot; and &quot;inverse probability&quot; were in use until the middle part of the 20th century, when the terms &quot;likelihood function&quot; and &quot;posterior distribution&quot; became prevalent.

<doc id="908709" wikidata="Q931855" url="?curid=908709" title="Status of forces agreement">
<text>A status of forces agreement (SOFA) is an agreement between a host country and a foreign nation stationing military forces in that country. SOFAs are often included, along with other types of military agreements, as part of a comprehensive security arrangement. A SOFA does not constitute a security arrangement; it establishes the rights and privileges of foreign personnel present in a host country in support of the larger security arrangement. Under international law a status of forces agreement differs from military occupation.

==Agreements==
While the United States military has the largest foreign presence and therefore accounts for most SOFAs, the United Kingdom, France, Australia, Germany, Italy, Russia, Japan, Spain, and many other nations also station military forces abroad and negotiate SOFAs with their host countries. In the past, the Soviet Union had SOFAs with most of its satellite states. While most of the United States&#x27; SOFAs are public, some remain classified. NATO has its own procedure that stems from &quot;a peacetime agreement originally signed in 1951&quot; for SOFAs between member states.

===Terms of operation===
A SOFA is intended to clarify the terms under which the foreign military is allowed to operate. Typically, purely military operational issues such as the locations of bases and access to facilities are covered by separate agreements. A SOFA is more concerned with the legal issues associated with military individuals and property. This may include issues such as entry and exit into the country, tax liabilities, postal services, or employment terms for host-country nationals, but the most contentious issues are civil and criminal jurisdiction over bases and personnel. For civil matters, SOFAs provide for how civil damages caused by the forces will be determined and paid. Criminal issues vary, but the typical provision in U.S. SOFAs is that U.S. courts will have jurisdiction over crimes committed either by a service member against another service member or by a service member as part of his or her military duty, but the host nation retains jurisdiction over other crimes.

===Host nation concerns===
In many host nations, especially those with a large foreign military presence such as South Korea and Japan, the SOFA can become a major political issue following crimes allegedly committed by service members. This is especially true when the incidents involve crimes such as robbery, murder, manslaughter or sex crimes, especially when the charge is defined differently in the two nations. For example, in 2002 in South Korea, a U.S. military AVLB bridge-laying vehicle on the way to the base camp after a training exercise accidentally killed two girls. Under the SOFA, a United States military court martial tried the soldiers involved. The panel found the act to be an accident and acquitted the service members of negligent homicide, citing no criminal intent or negligence. The U.S. military accepted responsibility for the incident and paid civil damages. This resulted in widespread outrage in South Korea, demands that the soldiers be retried in a South Korean court, the airing of a wide variety of conspiracy theories, and a backlash against the local expatriate community.

, American military authorities were allowing South Korea to charge and prosecute American soldiers in South Korean courts. Two U.S, soldiers were accused of rapes in separate incidents in October 2011, prompting the imposition of a peninsula-wide curfew for U.S. troops. A U.S. soldier was alleged to have committed arson in a bar in Seoul in November 2011, and another soldier was sentenced to three years in prison in June 2012 by a Daegu district court after being convicted of rape. Also in November 2011, a Uijeongbu district court sentenced a soldier who had been caught on camera committing an exceptionally brutal rape to ten years in prison. That same court had earlier sentenced a Korean man to less than four years in prison for the rape of a female U.S. soldier, but the disparity was explained as being due to the level of violence in the rape by the U.S. soldier. On review, the three-year sentence was suspended and the ten year sentence was upheld.

Criminal accusations against off-duty service members are generally considered subject to local jurisdiction, depending on specific provisions of the SOFA. However, details of these provisions can still prompt issues. In Japan, for example, the SOFA includes the requirement that service members are not turned over to the local authorities until they are charged in court. In a number of cases, local officials have complained that this impedes their ability to question suspects and investigate the crime. American officials allege that the Japanese police use coercive interrogation tactics and are concerned more with attaining a high conviction rate than finding &quot;justice&quot;. American authorities also note the difference in police investigation powers, as well as the judiciary. No lawyer can be present in investigation discussions in Japan, though a translator is provided, and no mention made of an equivalent to America&#x27;s Miranda rights. Another issue is the lack of jury trials in Japan, previous to 2009 all trials were decided by a judge or panel of judges. Currently, Japan uses a lay judge system in some criminal trials. For these reasons American authorities insist that service members be tried in military tribunals and reject article 98 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.

===Political issues===
The political issue of SOFAs is complicated by the fact that many host countries have mixed feelings about foreign bases on their soil, and demands to renegotiate the SOFA are often combined with calls for foreign troops to leave entirely. Issues of different national customs can arise – while the U.S. and host countries generally agree on what constitutes a crime, many U.S. observers feel that host country justice systems grant a much weaker set of protections to the accused than the U.S. and that the host country&#x27;s courts can be subject to popular pressure to deliver a guilty verdict; furthermore, that American service members ordered to a foreign posting should not be forced to give up the rights they are afforded under the Bill of Rights. On the other hand, host country observers, having no local counterpart to the Bill of Rights, often feel that this is an irrelevant excuse for demanding special treatment, and resembles the extraterritorial agreements demanded by Western countries during colonialism. One host country where such sentiment is widespread, South Korea, itself has forces in Kyrgyzstan and has negotiated a SOFA that confers total immunity to its service members from prosecution by Kyrgyz authorities for any crime whatsoever, something far in excess of the privileges many South Koreans object to in their nation&#x27;s SOFA with the United States.

<doc id="908714" wikidata="Q1660337" url="?curid=908714" title="Subdermal implant">
<text>A subdermal implant is a body modification placed under the skin, allowing the body to heal over the implant and creating a raised design. Such implants fall under the broad category of body modification. Many subdermal implants are made out of silicone, either carved or mold injected. Many people who have subdermal implants use them in conjunction with other types of body modification to create a desired, dramatic effect. This process is also known as a &quot;3-D implant&quot;, or &quot;pocketing&quot;.

== History ==
The first subdermal implant was implanted in 1994. It is generally agreed upon that they were pioneered by Steve Haworth. In his shop, HTC Body Piercing, in Phoenix, Arizona, he first began these procedures after being asked for a bracelet. He concluded that he could put a row of beads under the woman&#x27;s wrist to create the effect she desired. This was followed in 1998 by the scientist Kevin Warwick who experimented with both an RFID and an electrode array implant.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1001/archneur.60.10.1369|noedit&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, many different artists have done many kinds of implants. Some of the well-known names in the industry include Samppa Von Cyborg, Max Yampolskiy, Brian Decker, Emilio Gonzales and Stelarc, who had a cell-cultivated ear implanted on his arm.

== Types ==
According to the Church of Body Modification, there are two main types of subdermal implants: subdermal (or subcutaneous) implants and transdermal implants. Magnetic subdermal implants also exist.

=== Subdermal ===
&quot;Subdermal implants,&quot; as defined by the Church of Body Modification, are completely buried in the dermis. These are used for both cosmetic and medical purposes, such as the contraceptive Norplant, consisting of six levonorgestrel-releasing Silastic capsules, and is placed under the skin of the upper arm, generally a woman’s arm. The cosmetic variant can be molded into any shape desired; though usually made of silicone. However, Teflon variants exist as well.

=== Transdermal ===

Transdermal implants are placed partially under the skin, with the rest exposed. This is done through a process known as &quot;dermal punching&quot;. First the implant is placed in between the layers of skin. It is necessary for the part of the implant that will be located under the skin to have a proper shape. This must be one with holes in it (like a figure eight) so that the body will be able to grow around it. Once the implant is placed, the part that will protrude out is exposed using a dermal punch.

== Procedure ==
To have one of these implants installed, an incision is made down to the subcutaneous layer (subcutis) of the skin. A dermal elevator, a widely used medical instrument, separates the subcutis and the fascia, creating the pocket in which the implant will be inserted. After the implant is placed, the incision is stitched shut. Surgical tape is often applied to minimize movement while the skin fuses around the implant.

Contraceptive implants in the UK and Australia are &quot;injected&quot; under the skin using a special device similar to a large syringe or ear-piercing gun, and extracted by making a tiny incision through which the implant is pulled out. A local anesthetic is usually available for the extraction but is not required, as the cut is very small.

== Applications ==

=== Electronic implants ===
For electronic implants see microchip implant.

=== Cosmetic implants ===
Cosmetic Implants range from small subdermal silicone implants to form desired shapes and forms, ranging to LED light implants that emit light from under the skin.

=== Genital implants ===
Subdermal implants placed under the skin of the penis can provide physical stimulation for both sexual partners. The most frequent form is genital beading, using small, round implants. Short, curved rods are also used, and are called &quot;genital ribs&quot;.

=== Braille tattoo ===
Klara Jirkova, a student at the Berlin University of the Arts, raised the possibility of using subdermal implants to create &quot;Braille tattoos&quot; readable by the blind. She proposes that small implants could be grouped to form braille characters, which she says &quot;can be read by touch – stroke by blind people. She suggests that, if located near the thumb where they could be read during a handshake, &quot;Braille tattoos&quot; could help the blind recognize whom they are greeting. She states that this will be a more meaningful form of body modification as it relates to the sense of touch instead of sight.

Despite the media attention Jirkova&#x27;s proposal received, this application of subdermal implants is, at best, impractical. A &quot;braille tattoo&quot; as a form of identification between the blind would be extraneous, as the blind can easily identify others by speaking to them. Such a procedure would have a low success rate, as the implants would most likely shift during healing. The smooth, round implants Jirkova suggests are especially prone to shifting and it is likely that a &quot;Braille tattoo&quot; would migrate to the point of being unreadable. The commonly seen &quot;Braille tattoo&quot; image is a photo manipulation from Jirkova&#x27;s report, not a successfully completed modification.

Although individual ball implants would present too many problems due to migration, flat premade square silicone &quot;character&quot; sheets with pre-positioned dots would solve the readability problems. These individual square sheets could be preformed and implanted with the desired effect.

== Aftercare ==
Subdermal implants are treated like many other body modifications in their aftercare. According to the Church of Body Modification, &quot;The most important part of aftercare is keeping your sutures clean and dry.&quot; They also suggest using paper products rather than cloth to clean and cover the area, as cloth products can hold many bacteria, and that the sutures be cleaned with solutions designed for sterilizing piercings. After 10–12 days, the stitches can be removed. It can take up to 3 months for the desired effect to be reached. As part of the Church&#x27;s philosophy, they encourage all to &quot;Use common sense; know your body and listen to what it needs! Take care of yourself and your modifications.&quot; This can include seeing a doctor at the first sign of infection or for help removing sutures.

== Health risks ==
Subdermal implants, being similar to plastic surgery, have more risks than other kinds of body modification. Any time that the human body is opened, it must be performed in a sterile environment, in order to prevent infection. This has become a major source of controversy regarding subdermal implants.

Many health professionals are concerned for the individuals undergoing these procedures: the majority of these procedures are being performed by individuals with little to no formal medical training, and often do not take place in sterile environments.

The body modification industry is trying to make changes to the risky behaviors that are sometimes taken by unqualified people who are performing such implants. For example, David A. Vidra founded Health Educators, a company set up as &quot;education for the modification industry&quot;. It is set up to offer qualified instructors that teach sterilization and other techniques for safe procedures.

Many medical doctors are still concerned, however. Dr. Phil Haeck states, &quot;This is a deviation in surgery that has no place for someone that has taken the Hippocratic Oath and wants to serve mankind.&quot;

<text>Port Everglades is a seaport in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, located in Broward County. Port Everglades is one of South Florida&#x27;s foremost economic engines, as it is the gateway for both international trade and cruise vacations. In 2022, Port Everglades was ranked the third-busiest cruise homeport, accommodating more than 1.72 million passengers. Port Everglades&#x27; cargo sector has climbed the rankings based on its operational performance among 348 seaports in the world.

The port is also one of Florida&#x27;s main seaports for energy products including gasoline, jet fuel, and alternative fuels. The port serves as the primary storage and distribution seaport for refined petroleum products. Port Everglades distributes fuel to 12 Florida counties and supplies jet fuel to four international airports.

The Port Everglades Department is a self-supporting enterprise fund of the Broward County government, with operating revenues of approximately $151.7 million in Fiscal Year 2022. The port does not rely on local property taxes for operations. The total value of economic activity at Port Everglades is approximately $33 billion annually. Approximately 216,000 statewide jobs are impacted by the port, including nearly 9,600 people who work for companies that provide direct services to Port Everglades.

Port Everglades is the #1 seaport in Florida by revenue as well as one of the top container ports in the state. Port Everglades is consistently ranked among the top three multi-day cruise homeports in the world with 702 ship calls and 1.72 million passengers in Fiscal Year 2022, and the #2 petroleum port in Florida with 588 ship calls and 125.8 million barrels.

==History==
Port Everglades is composed of land within three municipalities, Hollywood, Fort Lauderdale and Dania Beach and unincorporated Broward County. Port Everglades is a man-made seaport. The port was originally dredged from Lake Mabel, a natural body of water that was a wide and shallow section of the Florida East Coast Canal system. In 1911, the Florida Board of Trade passed a resolution that called for a deep-water port. The port was originally intended to ship produce to the North and the West. In 1913, the Fort Lauderdale Harbor Company was formed and eventually dug out the Lake Mabel Cut, which opened the New River to the sea and created access for small boats.

In 1924, the founder and mayor of the city of Hollywood, Florida, Joseph Wesley Young, bought of land adjacent to the lake. He then created the Hollywood Harbor Development Company. Three years later, the Florida Legislature established the Broward County Port Authority. On February 22, 1928, 85 percent of Broward County&#x27;s residents gathered for a ceremony in which President Calvin Coolidge was to push a button from the White House detonating explosives to remove the rock barrier separating the harbor from the Atlantic Ocean. The button malfunctioned, but the barrier was removed shortly thereafter.

Bay Mabel Harbor was dedicated on February 22, 1928. Many of South Florida&#x27;s local women&#x27;s clubs agreed that the port needed a new name to better represent the region. They held a name changing contest, and the name Port Everglades was selected. The reason for this was as follows: &quot;The gateway to the rich agricultural area embraced in the at the Port&#x27;s very backdoor.&quot;
The container handling capacity of the port was increased with a new terminal, completed in 2010. The expansion increased Port Everglades&#x27; freight handling area by 15%.

In 2015, the US Army Corps of Engineers approved a new phase of expansion for Port Everglades with the deepening and widening of the port&#x27;s channels. The project received federal authorization in December 2016 under the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation (WIIN) Act. The port served ships from Europe and South America that were too large to fit through the Panama Canal, but the ships still had to be under a certain load to fit properly in the port. The expansion was planned to increase main navigational channels from to , and to deepen and widen both the Entrance Channel and parts of the Intracoastal Waterway. The project was planned to be completed in 2028, create approximately 4,789 construction jobs and 1,491 direct jobs locally, and cost $509.6 million.
In February 2020, the port received $29.1 million from Congress for the Intracoastal Waterway portion of the expansion; a section of the Waterway would be widened by 250 feet and be completed by 2023. The remaining funds, estimated up to $437 million, is expected to arrive at the end of 2021 and fund the deepening portion of the project, now scheduled to be completed between 2024 and 2026.

In May 2017, Port Everglades received approval to begin the Southport Turning Notch Extension (STNE) project, its largest capital improvement project in the Port&#x27;s history. The existing deepwater turn-around area would be lengthened by 1,500 feet, from 900 feet to 2,400 feet. The lengthening makes it possible for up to five new cargo ship berths to be added. Additionally, existing gantry crane rails will be extended, and three new super-post-Panamax container gantry cranes were manufactured to supplement the expansion. The STNE also replaced 8.7 acres of an existing mangrove conservation easement with a 16.5-acre mangrove upland easement. In June 2017, Port Everglades received approval to purchase the three new gantry cranes and in June 2018, Port Everglades Chief Executive Steven Cernak gave the approval to begin manufacturing three &quot;Super Post-Panamax&quot; gantry cranes to increase the port&#x27;s cargo volume. Each crane, manufactured by ZPMC, cost $13.8 million, and measures 175 feet tall. They were expected to arrive in 2020.

=== Cruise ship operations ===
Port Everglades is one of the busiest cruise/passenger ports in the world. It accommodates major cruise lines such as Princess, Royal Caribbean, Holland, Disney, and Celebrity, among others&quot;.&quot; Over 3 million cruise passengers pass through the port each year (FY2023/2024).

==== Current passenger terminals ====
==Impact and recognition==
=== Influence on Broward County ===
Port Everglades has a large economic impact on Broward County. In FY2019, the Port generated over $32 billion in economic activity and more than 219,000 statewide jobs. As the third-busiest cruise homeport in the world, it directly affects the region&#x27;s tourism industry, with more than 3.89 million cruise passengers arriving in 2019 According to a 2015 study, 62% of surveyed passengers stayed in South Florida for at least a night prior to their cruise and 21% arrived at their cruise directly from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. 21% of surveyed passengers stayed in South Florida after their cruise.

In Fiscal Year 2022, Port Everglades generated over $33 billion in business activity. The port also generated over 216,000 jobs throughout the state of Florida. This resulted in a total of $809,333 taxes collected on the state and local level. In 2017, Port Everglades was also ranked America&#x27;s second-largest port for exports to Cuba, behind Port of Brunswick in Georgia.

Condominium residents who live in buildings next to the channel of Port Everglades often bid bon voyage to cruise ships as they embark on their voyages from Port Everglades with the &quot;Condo Salute.&quot; The residents blow horns, ring bells, or wave scarves, and the ships often respond by blowing their horns back.

=== Notable ships ===
Ships sail from Port Everglades year-round, but the peak season for cruise travel from Port Everglades is from November to April, with most itineraries sailing to the Caribbean. Port Everglades was once home to when she was laid up as a museum ship from 1968 until 1970. Besides RMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, Port Everglades has been used to dock many notable and famous ships. In 2004, completed her maiden voyage and her maiden transatlantic voyage at Port Everglades.

In the 21st century, Port Everglades has been the homeports for four of one of the largest passenger ships in the world, the ships. In December 2009, Royal Caribbean International began using Port Everglades as the home port for . In late 2010, she was joined at Port Everglades by her sister ship, . In April 2017, Port Everglades became the homeport for from April 2017 until May 2019. and in 2022 the made her debut sailing from Port Everglades.

In November 2018, performed her maiden call at Port Everglades. In anticipation of her arrival, Port Everglades invested $120 million into the port&#x27;s first-ever brand-designed cruise terminal at Terminal 25, the largest investment that Port Everglades has made towards any cruise terminal at the port. With this development, it is expected that Celebrity Cruises will bring about 500,000 travelers to Port Everglades.

Disney Cruise Line&#x27;s second homeport was chosen at Port Everglades&#x27; Terminal 4. The terminal exclusively serves Disney Cruise Line ships, with the Disney Magic currently homeported there. The terminal&#x27;s exterior design is based on Disney&#x27;s original homeport at Port Canaveral, while the interior features a &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; theme. This port began embarking guests on November 20, 2023.

===Records and achievements===

<doc id="908737" wikidata="Q977425" url="?curid=908737" title="Manning Marable">
<text>William Manning Marable (May 13, 1950 – April 1, 2011) was an American professor of public affairs, history and African-American Studies at Columbia University. Marable founded and directed the Institute for Research in African-American Studies. He wrote several texts and was active in numerous progressive political causes.

At the time of his death, he had completed a biography of human rights activist Malcolm X, titled &quot;Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention&quot; (2011). Marable was posthumously awarded the 2012 Pulitzer Prize for History for this work.

==Life and career==

Marable was born and raised in Dayton, Ohio. His parents were both graduates of Central State, an historically black university in nearby Wilberforce. His mother was an ordained minister and held a Ph.D. In April 1968, at the behest of his mother, 17-year-old Marable covered the funeral of Martin Luther King Jr. for Dayton&#x27;s black newspaper. He graduated from Jefferson Township High School shortly thereafter.

Marable received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Earlham College (1971) and went on to earn his master&#x27;s degree (1972) and Ph.D. (1976) in history, at the University of Wisconsin, and University of Maryland. Marable served on the faculty of Smith College, Tuskegee Institute, University of San Francisco, Cornell University, Fisk University, served as the founding director of the Africana and Hispanic Studies Program at Colgate University, Purdue University, Ohio State University, and University of Colorado at Boulder, where he was chairman of the Department of Black Studies. He was recruited in 1993 by Columbia University professor Eric Foner to be the founding director of Columbia&#x27;s Institute for Research in African-American Studies, and was later appointed as the M. Moran Weston and Black Alumni Council Professor of African-American Studies and professor of history and public affairs.

In 1979, Marable joined the New American Movement (NAM), an organization of veterans of the New Left who were trying to build a successor to Students for a Democratic Society. In 1982, NAM merged with Michael Harrington’s Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee to form the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), and Marable was elected as one of the new organization’s vice chairs. He left the DSA in 1985 after Michael Harrington and his allies, following the lead of much of the mainstream union leadership, refused to back Jesse Jackson’s insurgent campaign in 1984.

Marable served as Chair of Movement for a Democratic Society (MDS). Marable served on the Board of Directors for the Hip-Hop Summit Action Network (HSAN), a non-profit coalition of public figures working to utilize hip-hop as an agent for social change. Marable was also a member of the New York Legislature&#x27;s Amistad Commission, created to review state curriculum regarding the slave trade.

==Personal life==
Marable was married twice, first to his Earlham classmate, Hazel Ann Marable, and then from 1996 until his death, to Leith Mullings, Distinguished Professor of Anthropology at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.

Marable was a critic of Afrocentrism. He wrote:

It was reported in June 2004 by activist group &quot;Racism Watch&quot; that Marable had called for immediate action to be taken to end the U.S. military&#x27;s use of Raphael Patai&#x27;s book &quot;The Arab Mind,&quot; which Marable described as &quot;a book full of racially charged stereotypes and generalizations.&quot; In a 2008 column, Marable endorsed Senator Barack Obama&#x27;s bid for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination.
Marable, who was diagnosed with sarcoidosis, underwent a double lung transplant as treatment in mid-2010. Marable died of complications from pneumonia on April 1, 2011, in New York City at the age of 60.

==Malcolm X biography==

Marable&#x27;s biography of Malcolm X concluded that Malcolm X exaggerated his early criminal career, and engaged in a homosexual relationship with a white businessman. He also concluded that some of the killers of Malcolm X are still alive and were never charged.

Critics of the biography contend that the focus on Marable&#x27;s discussion of Malcolm&#x27;s potential same-sex relationships, about three sentences long in a 592-page book, overlooks more important political statements Marable makes about Malcolm&#x27;s underlying lifelong commitment to revolutionary Pan Africanism.

&quot;Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention&quot; was nominated for the National Book Award, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; ranked it among the 10 Best Books of 2011. It was one of three nominees for the inaugural Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Nonfiction (2012) presented by the American Library Association for the best adult non-fiction. It was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for History in 2012.

<doc id="908738" wikidata="Q104280" url="?curid=908738" title="Gums">
<text>The gums or gingiva (: gingivae) consist of the mucosal tissue that lies over the mandible and maxilla inside the mouth. Gum health and disease can have an effect on general health.

==Structure==
The gums are part of the soft tissue lining of the mouth. They surround the teeth and provide a seal around them. Unlike the soft tissue linings of the lips and cheeks, most of the gums are tightly bound to the underlying bone which helps resist the friction of food passing over them. Thus when healthy, it presents an effective barrier to the barrage of periodontal insults to deeper tissue. Healthy gums are usually coral pink in light skinned people, and may be naturally darker with melanin pigmentation.

Changes in color, particularly increased redness, together with swelling and an increased tendency to bleed, suggest an inflammation that is possibly due to the accumulation of bacterial plaque. Overall, the clinical appearance of the tissue reflects the underlying histology, both in health and disease. When gum tissue is not healthy, it can provide a gateway for periodontal disease to advance into the deeper tissue of the periodontium, leading to a poorer prognosis for long-term retention of the teeth. Both the type of periodontal therapy and homecare instructions given to patients by dental professionals and restorative care are based on the clinical conditions of the tissue.

The gums are divided anatomically into marginal, attached and interdental areas.

===Marginal gums===
The marginal gum is the edge of the gums surrounding the teeth in collar-like fashion. In about half of individuals, it is demarcated from the adjacent, attached gums by a shallow linear depression, the free gingival groove. This slight depression on the outer surface of the gum does not correspond to the depth of the gingival sulcus but instead to the apical border of the junctional epithelium. This outer groove varies in depth according to the area of the oral cavity. The groove is very prominent on mandibular anteriors and premolars.

The marginal gum varies in width from 0.5 to 2.0 mm from the free gingival crest to the attached gingiva. The marginal gingiva follows the scalloped pattern established by the contour of the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) of the teeth. The marginal gingiva has a more translucent appearance than the attached gingiva, yet has a similar clinical appearance, including pinkness, dullness, and firmness. In contrast, the marginal gingiva lacks the presence of stippling, and the tissue is mobile or free from the underlying tooth surface, as can be demonstrated with a periodontal probe. The marginal gingiva is stabilized by the gingival fibers that have no bony support. The gingival margin, or free gingival crest, at the most superficial part of the marginal gingiva, is also easily seen clinically, and its location should be recorded on a patient&#x27;s chart.

===Attached gum===
The attached gums are continuous with the marginal gum. It is firm, resilient, and tightly bound to the underlying periosteum of alveolar bone. The facial aspect of the attached gum extends to the relatively loose and movable alveolar mucosa, from which it is demarcated by the mucogingival junction. Attached gum may present with surface stippling. The tissue when dried is dull, firm, and immobile, with varying amounts of stippling. The width of the attached gum varies according to its location. The width of the attached gum on the facial aspect differs in different areas of the mouth. It is generally greatest in the incisor region (3.5 to 4.5 mm in the maxilla and 3.3 to 3.9 mm in the mandible) and less in the posterior segments, with the least width in the first premolar area (1.9 mm in the maxilla and 1.8 mm in the mandible). However, certain levels of attached gum may be necessary for the stability of the underlying root of the tooth.

===Interdental gum ===
The interdental gum lies between the teeth. They occupy the gingival embrasure, which is the interproximal space beneath the area of tooth contact. The interdental papilla can be pyramidal or have a &quot;col&quot; shape. Attached gums are resistant to the forces of chewing and covered in keratin.

The col varies in depth and width, depending on the expanse of the contacting tooth surfaces. The epithelium covering the col consists of the marginal gum of the adjacent teeth, except that it is nonkeratinized. It is mainly present in the broad interdental gingiva of the posterior teeth, and generally is not present with those interproximal tissue associated with anterior teeth because the latter tissue is narrower. In the absence of contact between adjacent teeth, the attached gum extends uninterrupted from the facial to the lingual aspect. The col may be important in the formation of periodontal disease but is visible clinically only when teeth are extracted.

==Characteristics of healthy gums==

===Color===
Healthy gums usually have a color that has been described as &quot;coral pink&quot;. Other colours like red, white, and blue can signify inflammation (gingivitis) or pathology. Smoking or drug use can cause discoloring as well (such as &quot;meth mouth&quot;). Although described as the colour coral pink, variation in colour is possible. This can be the result of factors such as: thickness and degree of keratinization of the epithelium, blood flow to the gums, natural pigmentation of the skin, disease, and medications.

Since the colour of the gums can vary, uniformity of colour is more important than the underlying color itself. Excess deposits of melanin can cause dark spots or patches on the gums (melanin gingival hyperpigmentation), especially at the base of the interdental papillae. Gum depigmentation (aka gum bleaching) is a procedure used in cosmetic dentistry to remove these discolorations.

===Contour===
Healthy gums have a smooth curved or scalloped appearance around each tooth. Healthy gums fill and fit each space between the teeth, unlike the swollen gum papilla seen in gingivitis or the empty interdental embrasure seen in periodontal disease. Healthy gums hold tight to each tooth in that the gum surface narrows to &quot;knife-edge&quot; thin at the free gingival margin. On the other hand, inflamed gums have a &quot;puffy&quot; or &quot;rolled&quot; margin.

===Texture===
Healthy gums have a firm texture that is resistant to movement, and the surface texture often exhibits surface stippling. Unhealthy gums, on the other hand, are often swollen and less firm. Healthy gums have an orange-peel like texture to it due to the stippling.

===Reaction to disturbance===
Healthy gums usually have no reaction to normal disturbance such as brushing or periodontal probing. Unhealthy gums, conversely, will show bleeding on probing (BOP) and/or purulent exudate.

==Clinical significance==
The gingival cavity microecosystem, fueled by food residues and saliva, can support the growth of many microorganisms, of which some can be injurious to health. Improper or insufficient oral hygiene can thus lead to many gum and periodontal disorders, including gingivitis or periodontitis, which are major causes for tooth failure. Recent studies have also shown that anabolic steroids are also closely associated with gingival enlargement requiring a gingivectomy for many cases. Gingival recession is when there is an apical movement of the gum margin away from the biting (occlusal) surface. It may indicate an underlying inflammation such as periodontitis or pyorrhea, a pocket formation, dry mouth or displacement of the marginal gums away from the tooth by mechanical (such as brushing), chemical, or surgical means. Gingival retraction, in turn, may expose the dental neck and leave it vulnerable to the action of external stimuli, and may cause &quot;root sensitivity&quot;.

<doc id="908739" wikidata="Q471103" url="?curid=908739" title="Shotaro Ishinomori">
<text>, né , was a Japanese manga artist and cartoonist. Known as the &quot;King of Manga&quot; (漫画の帝王 (&quot;Manga no Teiou)&quot; or マンガの王様 (&quot;Manga no Ousama)&quot;), he is regarded as one of the most influential manga artists of all time. Outside of manga he is also one of the most prolific creators in the history of anime, , and Japanese superhero fiction, creating several immensely popular long-running series such as &quot;Cyborg 009,&quot; the &quot;Super Sentai&quot; series (later adapted into the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; series which Ishinomori has also been credited for co-creating), and the &quot;Kamen Rider&quot; series. He was twice awarded by the Shogakukan Manga Awards, in 1968 for &quot;Sabu to Ichi Torimono Hikae&quot; and in 1988 for &quot;Hotel&quot; and &quot;Manga Nihon Keizai Nyumon&quot;. 

He was also known as prior to 1986, when he changed his family name to Ishinomori by adding the character in katakana.

==Career==
In December 1954, Ishinomori published his first work, &quot;Nikyuu Tenshi&quot;, in &quot;Manga Shōnen&quot;. In 1956, he moved to Tokyo and became an assistant to Osamu Tezuka. During his time working under Tezuka, Ishinomori worked on &quot;Astro Boy&quot; and &quot;Alakazam the Great&quot;. In 1960, Ishinomori published &quot;Flying Phantom Ship&quot;, which was later turned into an animated feature film in 1969.

&quot;Cyborg 009&quot;, created in 1963, became the first superpowered hero team created in Japan, featuring nine cybernetic warriors. That same year, Kazumasa Hirai and Jiro Kuwata created Japan&#x27;s first android superhero series, &quot;8 Man&quot; (which predated Ishinomori&#x27;s &quot;Kikaider&quot; by nine years). The success of the superhero TV series &quot;Kamen Rider&quot;, produced by Toei Company in 1971, led to the birth of the &quot;transforming&quot; (&quot;henshin&quot;) superhero (human-sized superheroes who transform by doing a pose, and use martial arts to fight henchmen and the weekly monster), and resulted in many sequel shows to this day. 

Ishinomori then created many similar superhero dramas, which were once again all produced by Toei or in Sarutobi Ecchan&#x27;s case Toei Animation, including &quot;Android Kikaider&quot;, &quot;Kikaider 01&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Inazuman&quot;, &quot;Robotto Keiji&quot;, &quot;Himitsu Sentai Gorenger&quot; (the first Super Sentai series), &quot;Kaiketsu Zubat&quot;, &quot;Akumaizer 3&quot;, &quot;Sarutobi Ecchan&quot;, the &quot;Toei Fushigi Comedy Series&quot;, and countless others. He created popular children&#x27;s shows, such as &quot;Hoshi no Ko Chobin&quot; (&quot;Chobin, Child of the Stars&quot;, 1974, a co-production with Studio Zero which was a major success on Italian television) and &quot;Ganbare!! Robokon&quot;. 

In 1963, he founded the anime company Studio Zero. From 1967 to 1970, the manga &quot;009-1&quot; was serialized in the Futabasha publication &quot;Weekly Manga Action&quot;. It was written and illustrated by Ishinomori. There was a television drama of it in 1969 and eventually an anime in 2006.

Ishinomori&#x27;s art is reminiscent of that of his mentor, Osamu Tezuka. The true story of his first meeting with Tezuka was illustrated in a short four-page tale drawn up as supplementary material for the 1970s &quot;Astro Boy&quot; manga reprints. In 1954, Ishinomori submitted his first official work, &quot;Nikyu Tenshi&quot;, to a contest seeking new talent in the magazine, &quot;Manga Shōnen&quot;. Tezuka was impressed by his drawings and sent a telegraph to Ishinomori, asking him to work as his assistant with &quot;Astro Boy&quot;. In the American release, this story can be seen in Volume 15, along with Ishinomori&#x27;s earliest work on the &quot;Electro&quot; story arc. After graduating from high school in 1956 Ishinomori moved to Tokiwa-so with Tezuka, and lived there until the end of 1961.

Ishinomori illustrated a comic adaptation of the Super NES video game &quot;The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past&quot;, which was produced for the American publication &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;. The comic consisted of 12 chapters, which were serialized from January 1992 (Volume 32) to December 1992 (Volume 43). The comic was republished as a graphic novel collection in 1993, and, as of 2015, is back in print through Viz Media. He has been credited for some work with the &quot;Power Rangers&quot;, including videos, video games, the 1996 video of a Mighty Morphin Power Rangers World Tour Live on Stage event and the Power Rangers Zeo, Power Rangers Turbo and Power Rangers in Space tv series.

At the end of 1997, Kazuhiko Shimamoto, a young and up-and-coming manga artist was contacted by an increasingly ill Ishinomori and asked if he would do a continuation, though more along the lines of a remake, of his 100-page, one-shot manga from 1970, &quot;Skull Man&quot;, the manga that became the basis for &quot;Kamen Rider&quot;. Ishinomori, who had been one of Shimamoto&#x27;s boyhood heroes, faxed him copies of the proposed story and plot notes. Shimamoto was astounded that he had been chosen to work on his idol&#x27;s final, great work.

Shimamoto had already been involved in the revival of one of Ishinomori&#x27;s other earlier works (including &quot;Kamen Rider&quot;) but little did he dream that, as only one of many whom Ishinomori had inspired, he would be chosen for the final collaboration and resurrection of &quot;Skull Man&quot;. It was also adapted into an anime in 2007.

==Death and legacy==

Ishinomori died of lymphoma and heart failure on 28 January 1998, just three days after his 60th birthday. His final work was the superhero TV series, &quot;Voicelugger&quot;, televised in 1999. In 2000, the Kamen Rider series was revived with &quot;Kamen Rider Kuuga&quot;. All of the series made in the Heisei era onwards credit Ishinomori as the creator. In 2001, Ishinomori Manga Museum named in his honor opened in Ishinomaki, Miyagi. Special trains in the Senseki Line were commissioned featuring his artwork generally leading to the museum.

His work posthumously awarded him the Guinness World Record for most comics published by one author, totaling over 128,000 pages across 770 titles across 500 volumes.

His influence, particularly on superhero media, is such that he has often drawn comparisons as being the manga counterpart to both Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.

Many manga artists have cited Ishinomori as an influence, including Katsuhiro Otomo, Naoki Urasawa, Go Nagai, Kazuhiko Shimamoto, Keiko Takemiya, Moto Hagio, Taiyo Matsumoto, Tetsuya Chiba and Tetsuo Hara. Takemiya called him the &#x27;flag-bearer of our time&#x27;. Hagio cited his influence on her drawing technique, stating that his images were &#x27;truly marvelous&#x27;.

One of Tezuka&#x27;s former assistants, Shigeto Ishihara, stated Ishinomori to be one of the two cartoonists that Tezuka was ever truly jealous of (the other being Otomo).

Fuku Suzuki portrays a young Ishinomori in &quot;Saber + Zenkaiger: Superhero Senki&quot;.

<text>The Bridger Range, also known as the Bridger Mountains, is a subrange of the Rocky Mountains in southwestern Montana in the United States. The range runs mostly in a north–south direction between Bozeman and Maudlow. It is separated from the Gallatin Range to the south by Bozeman Pass; from the Horseshoe Hills to the west by Dry Creek; from the Crazy Mountains to the east by the Shields River valley; and from the Big Belt Mountains to the north by Sixteen Mile Creek. The highest point in the Bridger Range is Sacagawea Peak (), which is visible to the northeast from Bozeman.

Although the range is mostly in Gallatin County, a small portion extends into Park County. Bozeman Pass, at an elevation of , is a narrow pass that lies between Bozeman and Livingston. The entire range is within Gallatin National Forest.

==History==
The range is named after Jim Bridger, a mountain man of the 19th century who pioneered the Bridger Trail through mountains in southern Wyoming into the Bighorn Basin in 1864.

On January 10, 1938, Northwest Airlines Flight 2 crashed in the Bridger Mountains, killing all 10 aboard. This was the first fatal crash of a Northwest Airlines aircraft.

==Prominent peaks==
The most prominent peaks in the Bridgers include:
* Sacagawea Peak, , 
* Pomp Peak, , 
* Hardscrabble Peak, , 
* Naya Nuki Peak, , 
* Saddle Peak, , 
* Ross Peak, , 
* Mount Baldy, , 
* Bridger Peak, , 

==Recreation==
===Skiing===
The Bridger Range is also home to the ski area Bridger Bowl. With the first rope tow installed in 1951, Bridger Bowl quickly became a popular mountain with the locals. The area has a top elevation of 8700 feet and a base elevation of 6100 feet. On average the ski area receives of snow every year. Backcountry skiing is also very popular in the Bridgers, with snow being available on peaks such as Sacagawea from early November until late May/early June. Beginning in the 2008–2009 ski season, Bridger Bowl started to allow backcountry travel from the ski area via access gates on the northern and southern boundaries.

===Hiking===
Though many hiking trails exist, Sacagawea Peak is a favorite hiking area in the Bridgers. The hike is a short but strenuous one-way trek through pine forest, alpine tundra and scree fields to the top of Sacagawea Peak. The Bridger Ridge Run is a race which takes place in mid-August. The race follows the ridgeline from Fairy Lake to the southern end of the range.

<text>In computing, an avatar is a graphical representation of a user, the user&#x27;s character, or persona. Avatars can be two-dimensional icons in Internet forums and other online communities, where they are also known as profile pictures, userpics, or formerly picons (personal icons, or possibly &quot;picture icons&quot;). Alternatively, an avatar can take the form of a three-dimensional model, as used in online worlds and video games, or an imaginary character with no graphical appearance, as in text-based games or worlds such as MUDs.

The term &quot;&quot; () originates from Sanskrit, and was adopted by early computer games and science fiction novelists. Richard Garriott extended the term to an on-screen user representation in 1985, and the term gained wider adoption in Internet forums and MUDs. Nowadays, avatars are used in a variety of online settings including social media, virtual assistants, instant messaging platforms, and digital worlds such as &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; and &quot;Second Life&quot;. They can take the form of an image of one&#x27;s real-life self, as often seen on platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn, or a virtual character that diverges from the real world. Often, these are customised to show support for different causes, or to create a unique online representation.

Academic research has focused on how avatars can influence the outcomes of communication and digital identity. Users can employ avatars with fictional characteristics to gain social acceptance or ease social interaction. However, studies have found that the majority of users choose avatars that resemble their real-world selves.

==Origins==
The word &quot;avatar&quot; is ultimately derived from the Sanskrit word (&quot;&quot; ); in Hinduism, it stands for the &quot;descent&quot; of a deity into a terrestrial form. It was first used in a computer game by the 1979 PLATO role-playing game &quot;Avatar&quot;. In Norman Spinrad&#x27;s novel &quot;Songs from the Stars&quot; (1980), the term &quot;avatar&quot; is used in a description of a computer generated virtual experience. In the story, humans receive messages from an alien galactic network that wishes to share knowledge and experience with other advanced civilizations through &quot;songs&quot;. The humans build a &quot;galactic receiver&quot; that allows its users to engage in &quot;artificial realities&quot;. One experience is described as such:

The use of the term &quot;avatar&quot; for the on-screen representation of the user was coined in 1985 by Richard Garriott for the computer game &quot;Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar&quot;. In this game, Garriott desired the player&#x27;s character to be their Earth self manifested into the virtual world. Due to the ethical content of his story, Garriott wanted the real player to be responsible for their character; he thought only someone playing &quot;themselves&quot; could be properly judged based on their in-game actions. Because of its ethically nuanced narrative approach, he took the Hindu word associated with a deity&#x27;s manifestation on earth in physical form, and applied it to a player in the game world. Other early uses of the term include Lucasfilm and Chip Morningstar&#x27;s 1986 online role-playing game &quot;Habitat&quot;, and the 1989 pen and paper role-playing game &quot;Shadowrun&quot;.

The use of &quot;avatar&quot; to mean online virtual bodies was popularised by Neal Stephenson in his 1992 cyberpunk novel &quot;Snow Crash&quot;. In &quot;Snow Crash,&quot; the term &quot;avatar&quot; was used to describe the virtual simulation of the human form in the &quot;Metaverse&quot;, a fictional virtual-reality application on the Internet. Social status within the Metaverse was often based on the quality of a user&#x27;s avatar, as a highly detailed avatar showed that the user was a skilled hacker and programmer while the less talented would buy off-the-shelf models in the same manner a beginner would today. Stephenson wrote in the &quot;Acknowledgments&quot; to &quot;Snow Crash&quot;:

==Types and usage==
An avatar can refer to a two-dimensional picture akin to an icon in Internet forums and other online communities. This is also known as a profile picture or userpic, or in early Internet parlance, a &#x27;picon&#x27; (personal icon). With the advent of social media platforms like Facebook, where users are not typically anonymous, these pictures often are a photo of the user in real life.

Alternatively, avatars can also be three-dimensional digital representations, as in games such as World of Warcraft or virtual worlds like Second Life. In MUDs and other early systems, they were a construct composed of text. The term has been also sometimes extended to refer to the personality connected with the screen name, or handle, of an Internet user.

===Internet forums===
Despite the widespread use of avatars, it is unknown which Internet forums were the first to use them; the earliest forums did not include avatars as a default feature, and they were included in unofficial &quot;hacks&quot; before eventually being made standard. Avatars on Internet forums serve the purpose of representing users and their actions, personalizing their contributions to the forum, and may represent different parts of their persona, beliefs, interests or social status in the forum.

The traditional avatar system used on most Internet forums is a small (80x80 to 100x100 pixels, for example) square-shaped area close to the user&#x27;s forum post, where the avatar is placed in order for other users to easily identify who has written the post without having to read their username. Some forums allow the user to upload an avatar image that may have been designed by the user or acquired from elsewhere. Other forums allow the user to select an avatar from a preset list or use an auto-discovery algorithm to extract one from the user&#x27;s homepage.

Some avatars are animated, consisting of a sequence of multiple images played repeatedly. In such animated avatars, the number of images as well as the time in which they are replayed vary considerably.

Other avatar systems exist, such as on Gaia Online, WeeWorld, Frenzoo or Meez, where a pixelized representation of a person or creature is used, which can then be customized to the user&#x27;s wishes. There are also avatar systems (e.g. Trutoon) where a representation is created using a person&#x27;s face with customized characters and backgrounds.

Another avatar-based system is one wherein an image is automatically generated based on the identity of the poster. Identicons are formed as visually distinct geometric images derived from a digest hash of the poster&#x27;s IP address or user ID. These serve as a means to associate a particular user with a particular geometric representation. When used with an IP address, a particular anonymous user can be visually identified without the need for registration or authentication. If an account is compromised, a dissimilar identicon will be formed as the attacker is posting from an unfamiliar IP address.

===Internet chat and messaging===
GIF avatars were introduced as early as 1990 in the ImagiNation Network (also known as Sierra On-Line) game and chat hybrid. In 1994, Virtual Places offered VOIP capabilities which were later abandoned for lack of bandwidth. In 1996 Microsoft Comic Chat, an IRC client that used cartoon avatars for chatting, was released.

America Online introduced instant messaging for its membership in 1996 and included a limited number of &quot;buddy icons,&quot; picking up on the avatar idea from PC games. When AOL later introduced the free version of its messenger, AIM, for use by anyone on the Internet, the number of icons offered grew to be more than 1,000 and the use of them grew exponentially, becoming a hallmark feature of instant messaging. In 2002, AOL introduced &quot;Super Buddies,&quot; 3D animated icons that talked to users as they typed messages and read messages. The term Avatar began to replace the moniker of &quot;buddy icon&quot; as 3D customizable icons became known to its users from the mainstream popularity of PC Games. Yahoo&#x27;s instant messenger was the first to adopt the term &quot;avatar&quot; for its icons. Instant messaging avatars were usually very small; AIM icons have been as small as 16×16 pixels but are used more commonly at the 48×48 pixel size, although many icons can be found online that typically measure anywhere from 50×50 pixels to 100×100 pixels in size.

More recently, services such as Discord have added avatars. With a paid subscription, users can select individual identities for different communities.

===Online assistants===
Avatars can be used as virtual embodiments of embodied agents, which are driven more or less by artificial intelligence rather than real people. Automated online assistants are examples of avatars used in this way.

Such avatars are used by organizations as a part of automated customer services in order to interact with consumers and users of services. This can avail for enterprises to reduce their operating and training cost. A major underlying technology to such systems is natural language processing. Some of these avatars are commonly known as &quot;bots&quot;. Famous examples include IKEA&#x27;s Anna, an avatar designed to guide users around the IKEA website.

Such avatars can also be powered by a digital conversation which provides a little more structure than those using NLP, offering the user options and clearly defined paths to an outcome. This kind of avatar is known as a Structured Language Processing or SLP Avatar.

===Video games===
Avatars in video games are the player&#x27;s representation in the game world. The first video games to include a representation of the player were &quot;Basketball&quot; (1974) which represented players as humans, and &quot;Maze War&quot; (1974) which represented players as eyeballs.

In some games, the player&#x27;s representation is fixed, however many games offer a basic character model, or template, and then allow customization of the physical features as the player sees fit. For example, Carl Johnson, the avatar from &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;, can be dressed in a wide range of clothing, can be given tattoos and haircuts, and can even body build or become obese depending upon player actions. One video game in which the avatar and player are two separate entities is the game &quot;Perspective&quot;, where the player controls both themself in a 3-dimensional world and the avatar in a 2-dimensional world.

Aside from an avatar&#x27;s physical appearance, its dialogue, particularly in cutscenes, may also reveal something of its character. A good example is the crude, action hero stereotype, Duke Nukem. Other avatars, such as Gordon Freeman from &quot;Half-Life&quot;, who never speaks at all, reveal very little of themselves (the original game never showed the player what he looked like without the use of a console command for third-person view).

Many Massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) also include customizable avatars. Customization levels differ between games; for instance, in &quot;EVE Online&quot;, players construct a wholly customized portrait, using a software that allows for several changes to facial structure as well as preset hairstyles, skin tones, etc. However, these portraits appear only in in-game chats and static information view of other players. Usually, all players appear in gigantic spacecraft that give no view of their pilot, unlike in most other RPGs. Alternatively, &quot;City of Heroes&quot; offers one of the most detailed and comprehensive in-game avatar creation processes, allowing players to construct anything from traditional superheroes to aliens, medieval knights, monsters, robots, and many more. Robbie Cooper&#x27;s 2007 book &quot;Alter Ego, Avatars and their creators&quot; pairs photographs of players of a variety of MMO&#x27;s with images of their in-game avatars and profiles; recording the player&#x27;s motivations and intentions in designing and using their avatars. The survey reveals wide variation in the ways in which players of MMO&#x27;s use avatars. Felicia Day, creator and star of &quot;The Guild&quot; web series, created a song called &quot;(Do You Wanna Date My) Avatar&quot; which satirizes avatars and virtual dating.
Nintendo&#x27;s Wii, 3DS and Switch consoles allow for the creation of avatars called &quot;Miis&quot; that take the form of stylized, cartoonish people and can be used in some games as avatars for players, as in &quot;Wii Sports&quot;. In some games, the ability to use a Mii as an avatar must be unlocked, such as in &quot;Mario Kart 8&quot;.

In late 2008, Microsoft released an Xbox 360 Dashboard update which featured the introduction of Avatars as part of the console&#x27;s New Xbox Experience. With the update installed users can personalize the look of their Avatars by choosing from a range of clothing and facial features. In October 2018, Microsoft launched a new version of their Xbox avatars for Xbox One and Xbox on Windows 10, featuring increased detail and having a focus on inclusivity. PlayStation Home for Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 3 console also featured the use of avatars, but with a more realistic style than Nintendo&#x27;s Miis or Microsoft&#x27;s Avatars.

===Non-gaming online worlds===
Avatars in non-gaming online worlds are used as two- or three-dimensional human or fantastic representations of a person&#x27;s inworld self. Such representations are a tool which facilitates the exploration of the virtual universe, or acts as a focal point in conversations with other users, and can be customized by the user. Usually, the purpose and appeal of such universes is to provide a large enhancement to common online conversation capabilities, and to allow the user to peacefully develop a portion of a non-gaming universe without being forced to strive towards a pre-defined goal.
The earliest avatars of this form were text-based descriptions employed by players within MUDs. These often allowed players to express an identity disparate from their public one within an interactive environment. For instance, LambdaMOO allowed a choice of 11 different genders, which could be changed at the user&#x27;s will. The visually-based game &quot;Habitat&quot; also used the term to refer to players within the game world. A later example is Linden Lab&#x27;s &quot;Second Life&quot;, which has the player use a custom avatar to interact in a virtual 3D world; after peaking in 2007, its user count declined due to the encroachment of more traditional platforms such as Facebook. More recently, the concept has been combined with virtual reality; VRChat allows the user to interact with other avatars in custom environments, and Mark Zuckerberg&#x27;s Meta Platforms has promoted it as part of his vision of a metaverse.

Many modern virtual worlds provide users with advanced tools to customize their representations, allowing them to change shapes, hair, skins and also genre. Moreover, there is a secondary industry devoted to the creations of products and items for the avatars. Some companies have also launched social networks and other websites for avatars such as Koinup, Myrl, and Avatars United.

Lisa Nakamura has suggested that customizable avatars in non-gaming worlds tend to be biased towards lighter skin colors and against darker skin colors, especially in those of the male gender. In Second Life avatars are created by residents and take any form, and range from lifelike humans to robots, animals, plants and legendary creatures. Avatar customization is one of the most important entertainment aspects in non gaming virtual worlds, such as &quot;Second Life&quot;, IMVU, and Active Worlds. Some evidence suggests that avatars that are more anthropomorphic are perceived to be less credible and likeable than images that are less anthropomorphic. Social scientists at Stanford&#x27;s Virtual Human Interaction Lab examine the implications, possibilities, and transformed social interaction that occur when people interact via avatars.

===Social media===
Another use of the avatar has emerged with the widespread use of social media platforms. There is a practice in social media sites: uploading avatars in place of real profile image. Profile picture is a distinct graphics that represent the identity of profile holder. It is usually the portrait of an individual, logo of an organization, organizational building or distinctive character of book, cover page etc. Using avatars as profile pictures can increase users&#x27; perceived level of social presence which in turn fosters reciprocity and sharing behavior in online environments. According to MIT professor Sherry Turkle: &quot;...we think we will be presenting ourselves, but our profile ends up as somebody else – often the fantasy of who we want to be&quot;.

=== Motion capture ===
Another form of use for avatars is for video chats/calls. Some services, such as Skype (through some external plugins) allow users to use talking avatars during video calls, replacing the image from the user&#x27;s camera with an animated, talking avatar. Through the use of facial motion capture and a webcam, an avatar can be configured to mimic the motions and expressions of the user. This can be integrated directly into games, such as &quot;Star Citizen&quot;, and via standalone software such as FaceRig.

Both 3D and 2D avatars have been used in Learning and Development content for education, onboarding, employee training and more. Photorealistic 3D AI avatars have been used as stand-ins for real actors via video editing tools like those made by Synthesia among others.

Virtual YouTubers use animated avatars designed in software such as Live2D, which often resemble anime characters. A whole ecosystem of talent agencies and investors exists to manage these online personalities, which often differ from the creator&#x27;s real-life persona. YouTube&#x27;s 2020 Culture and Trends report highlighted VTubers as one of the notable trends of that year, with 1.5 billion views per month by October, and in May 2021, Twitch added a VTuber tag for streams as part of a wider expansion of its tag system.

===Miscellaneous===
Samsung&#x27;s AR Emoji which comes on Samsung Galaxy smartphones lets users create animated avatars of themselves.

===In popular culture===
Cartoons and stories sometimes have a character based on their creator, either a fictionalised version (e.g. the Matt Groening character in some episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;) or an entirely fictional character (e.g. Hermione Granger in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series has been said by J. K. Rowling to be based upon herself). Such characters are sometimes known as &quot;author surrogates&quot; or &quot;author avatars&quot;.

==Customisation==
Early examples of customizable avatars include multi-user systems, including MUDs. Gaia Online has a customizable avatar where users can dress it up as desired. Users may earn credits for completing sponsored surveys or certain tasks to purchase items and upgrades to customize their avatar. Linden Lab&#x27;s &quot;Second Life&quot; creates a virtual world in which avatars, homes, decorations, buildings and land are for sale. Less-common items may be designed to appear better than common items, and an experienced player may be identified from a group of new characters before in-game statistics are seen.

===Generators===
To meet the demand for millions of unique, customised avatars, generator tools and services have been created. Many of them, such as the website Picrew, are based around works by original artists. The 2021 Electronic Entertainment Expo featured an avatar creator, to align with its new all-digital nature.

===Awareness avatars===

Some people add visual details or effects to their avatars to show support for a movement or issue, in a similar way to a physical awareness ribbon.

The awareness avatar may have first been used in the New Zealand Internet Blackout, to protest copyright law changes in New Zealand. Globally, protesters replaced their icons with black squares to show solidarity. The protest was successful and proved the method effective at both raising awareness and effecting change. Campaigns have used this method include:

* Black avatar: February 16–23, 2009 New Zealand Internet Blackout protesting copyright law changes in New Zealand.
* Yellow tint: Beginning June 17, 2009, to protest the increasing size and role of the United States government.
* Green tint: Beginning June 18, 2009 support for Iran election protests.
* French flag tint: Beginning November 13, 2015 to show support for France after the November 2015 Paris attacks.
* During the COVID-19 pandemic, users added surgical masks and respirators on the faces of characters and avatars. Websites such as Facebook officially supported these efforts by adding the option for several frames supporting the COVID-19 vaccine. Conversely, anti-vaccine advocates have used profile frames to state their opposition to it.
* Rainbow patterns to represent membership or solidarity with the LGBT community.

==Academic study==
Avatars have become an area of study in the world of academics. According to psychiatrist David Brunski, the emergence of online avatars have implications for domains of scholarly research such as technoself studies, which is concerned with all aspects of identity in a technological society. 
Across the literature, scholars have focused on three overlapping aspects that influence users&#x27; perceptions of the social potential of avatars: agency, anthropomorphism, and realism. According to researchers K. L. Novak and J. Fox, researchers must differentiate &quot;perceived agency&quot; (whether an entity is perceived to be human), &quot;anthropomorphism&quot; (having human form or behavior), &quot;identomorphism&quot; (how much the form of the avatar resembles the player), and &quot;realism&quot; (the perceived viability of something realistically existing). Perceived agency influences people&#x27;s responses in the interaction regardless of who or what is actually controlling the representation. An earlier meta-analysis of studies comparing agents and avatars found that both agency and perceived agency mattered: representations controlled by humans were more persuasive than those controlled by bots, and representations believed to be controlled by humans were more persuasive than those believed to be controlled by bots.

Additionally, researchers have investigated how anthropomorphic representations influence communicative outcomes and found that more human-like representations are judged more favorably; people consider them more attractive, credible, and competent. Higher levels of anthropomorphism also lead to higher involvement, social presence, and communication satisfaction. Moreover, people communicate more naturally with more anthropomorphic avatars. Anthropomorphism is also tied to social influence, as more human-like representations can be more persuasive.

For the &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot;, Paul Hemp analysed the effects of avatars on real-world business. He focuses on the game &quot;Second Life&quot;, demonstrating that the creators of virtual avatars are willing to spend real money to purchase goods marketed solely to their virtual selves. In addition, research in data collection via Second Life avatars suggested important considerations related to research participant engagement, burden, and retention, as well as accuracy of the data collected.

===Representation of identity===
The Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication published a study of the reactions to certain types of avatars by a sample group of human users. The results showed that users commonly chose avatars which were humanoid and matched their gender. The conclusion was that in order to make users feel more &quot;at home&quot; in their avatars, designers should maximise the customizability of visual criteria common to humans, such as skin and hair color, age, gender, hair styles and height. Researchers at York University studied whether avatars reflected a user&#x27;s real-life personality. Student test groups were able to infer upon extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism, but could not infer upon openness and conscientiousness.

Researchers have also studied avatars that differ from real-life identity. Sherry Turkle described a middle-aged man who played an aggressive, confrontational female character in his online communities, displaying personality traits he was embarrassed to display in the offline world. Research by Nick Yee of the Daedelus Project demonstrates that an avatar may differ considerably from a player&#x27;s offline identity, based on gender. However, most players will make an avatar that is (proportionately) equal to their height (or slightly taller). Turkle has observed that some players seek an emotional connection they cannot establish in the real world. She described a case in which a man with a serious heart condition preventing him from ordinary socializing found acceptance and friendship through his online identity. Others have pointed out similar findings in those with mental disorders making social interaction difficult, such as those with autism or similar disabilities.

<doc id="908752" wikidata="Q648221" url="?curid=908752" title="Alexis Bachelot">
<text>Alexis Bachelot, SS.CC., (born Jean-Augustin Bachelot; 22 February 1796 – 5 December 1837) was a Catholic priest best known for his tenure as the first Prefect Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands. In that role, he led the first permanent Catholic mission to the Kingdom of Hawaii. Bachelot was raised in France, where he attended the Irish College in Paris, and was ordained a priest in 1820. He led the first Catholic mission to Hawaii, arriving in 1827. Although he had expected the approval of then Hawaiian King Kamehameha II, he learned upon arrival that Kamehameha II had died and a new government that was hostile towards Catholic missionaries had been installed. Bachelot, however, was able to convert a small group of Hawaiians and quietly minister to them for four years before being deported in 1831 on the orders of Kaʻahumanu, the &quot;Kuhina Nui&quot; (a position similar to queen regent) of Hawaii.

Bachelot then traveled to California, where he served as an assistant minister while pastoring and teaching. In 1837, having learned of Queen Kaʻahumanu&#x27;s death and King Kamehameha III&#x27;s willingness to allow Catholic priests on the island, Bachelot returned to Hawaii, intending to continue his missionary work. However, by Bachelot&#x27;s arrival, Kamehameha III had again changed his mind and Bachelot was removed from the island and confined to a ship for several months. He was freed only after the French and British navies imposed a naval blockade on the Honolulu harbor. Although he was later able to secure passage on a ship to Micronesia, he died en route and was buried on an islet near Pohnpei. His treatment in Hawaii prompted the government of France to dispatch a frigate to the island; the resulting intervention is known as the French Incident and led to the emancipation of Catholics in Hawaii.

==Early life==
Bachelot was born in Saint-Cyr-la-Rosière, Orne, France on 22 February 1796. In 1806, he left home for Paris, where he enrolled in the Preparatory Seminary of Picpus to pursue priesthood. In 1813, he professed at the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, taking the name Alexis. He studied at the Irish College in Paris before being ordained as a priest in 1820. As a priest, he initially served as the College&#x27;s rector and later led the preparatory seminary at Tours.

== Hawaiian mission ==
In the early 1820s, Jean Baptiste Rives, a French adviser to the Hawaiian king Kamehameha II, traveled to Europe to attempt to convince European Catholics to organize a mission to Hawaii. Members of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary were receptive to his idea, and in 1825, Pope Leo XII assigned them the task of evangelizing Hawaii. Bachelot was appointed the Prefect Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands, and in this role led the first permanent mission to Hawaii.

The expedition was organized by the influential Monneron family and funded by the government of France. Bachelot was assisted in his new position by fellow priests Patrick Short and Abraham Armand, as well as several lay brothers. The mission sailed from Bordeaux on &quot;La Comète&quot; in November 1826. The missionaries were initially accompanied by a group that planned to explore commercial trading opportunities but returned to France after reaching Mexico.

Unbeknownst to Bachelot, political changes occurred in Hawaii prior to the mission&#x27;s arrival. King died in 1824 and his younger brother became king. Because was young at the time of his ascension, Queen Kaʻahumanu (their stepmother) ruled as &quot;Kuhina Nui&quot;. On the advice of Hiram—a Protestant missionary who had converted the Hawaiian royalty four years previously—Queen Kaʻahumanu took a hard stance against Catholicism. Rives&#x27; influence on the Hawaiian government had faded, and he never returned to Hawaii.

&quot;La Comète&quot; arrived in Honolulu on 7 July 1827. The priests were faced with a situation of dire poverty owing to the absence of Rives&#x27; patronage. Furthermore, they had promised &quot;La Comète&#x27;s&quot; captain that Rives would pay for their passage after they arrived in Hawaii, but by the time of their arrival, Rives had already left. Queen Kaʻahumanu refused to allow the missionaries to stay, suspecting them to be covert agents of the government of France. She instructed &quot;La Comète&#x27;s&quot; captain to take the mission with him when he departed. The captain, however, refused to do so because he did not receive payment for their passage, so the party was able to remain.

The priests began their missionary work, but encountered suspicion from most chiefs. The members of the party had great difficulty defending themselves, as none of them was fluent in English or Hawaiian. But, the group were favorably received by the high chief Boki, the royal governor of Oahu, and his wife Kuini Liliha. (The couple were Catholic converts and rivals of Queen Kaʻahumanu.) Boki welcomed the party and gave its members permission to stay.

For several months, Bachelot and his fellow missionaries lived in three small rented structures, saying their first mass on the island in a grass hut. They later built a chapel on a small plot of land they purchased, where the Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace was dedicated in 1843. After settling on the island, the group avoided drawing attention to themselves and studied the Hawaiian language. During their mission&#x27;s first two years, the group converted 65 Hawaiians and ministered to Hawaiians who had already been converted. They often held surreptitious night-time meetings with converts who feared persecution. The priests&#x27; vestments and rituals made their evangelism efforts more effective because they reminded Hawaiians of native religious customs.

Bachelot introduced two plant species to Hawaii: &quot;Prosopis humilis&quot; and &quot;Bougainvillea&quot;. &quot;Prosopis humilis&quot; trees later covered thousands of acres there. He had obtained the seeds, which were originally gathered by Catholic missionaries in California, from the Royal Conservatory in Paris. Bachelot translated a prayer book into Hawaiian (&quot;O Ke A&#x27;o Ana Kristiano&quot;, &quot;Christian Doctrine&quot;, c. 1831), authored a catechism in Hawaiian (&quot;He Ōlelo Ho&#x27;ona&#x27;auao&quot;, &quot;A Word of Instruction&quot;, 1831), and wrote an introduction to Hawaiian grammar in French (&quot;Notes Grammaticales&quot;, &quot;Grammatical Notes&quot;, 1834).

== Persecution ==

By 1827, Protestant Christianity, and in particular Bingham&#x27;s teachings, had become the &quot;de facto&quot; state religion of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Queen Kaʻahumanu persecuted Catholics from 1829 until her death in 1832, by, for example, forbidding Hawaiians from attending masses and instructing Bachelot not to proselytize. In December 1831, Bachelot and Short were deported and forced to leave on a ship, the &quot;Waverly&quot;, bound for North America. Though Queen Kaʻahumanu steadfastly opposed his work, Bachelot viewed her as a good person who had been deceived by Protestant missionaries.

The news of Bachelot and Short&#x27;s expulsion caused controversy in the United States, where it was viewed as a violation of the rights appertaining to foreigners in the 1826 treaty signed by Commodore Thomas ap Catesby Jones of the United States Navy and King . U.S. Navy Commodore John Downes protested the expulsions while in discussion with chiefs during his 1832 visit to the kingdom.

== California ==

The &quot;Waverly&quot; landed at a vacant area near San Pedro, Los Angeles, in January 1832. Bachelot and Short traveled to the Mission San Gabriel Arcángel, where they were welcomed by the Franciscans who staffed the mission. Bachelot later became the pastor of a church in Los Angeles, served as an assistant minister for the mission, and led the mission on an interim basis after its priest was reassigned in 1834. He also taught in Los Angeles schools during a teacher shortage. He ministered in California until 1837 and became popular with Angelenos.

In 1833, the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith reorganized the jurisdiction of Oceania. Hawaii became part of the newly created Apostolic Vicariate of Eastern Oceania, which was split into northern and southern divisions. Bachelot remained as the Prefect Apostolic for the northern division. Etienne Jerome Rouchouze served as the Vicar Apostolic of Eastern Oceania and oversaw Bachelot&#x27;s assignment in Hawaii.

In 1835 and 1836, two representatives of the Catholic Church traveled to Hawaii in an attempt to ascertain whether Bachelot could return. Queen Kaʻahumanu had died in 1832, and the following year King began making radical changes to Hawaiian law. Columban Murphy, a Catholic lay brother from the United Kingdom, visited King in 1835 and discussed the possibility of Bachelot&#x27;s return. Finding King amenable to the idea, Murphy traveled to California to relay the news. He was unable, however, to locate Bachelot, who was absent from the area at the time. After Bachelot received Murphy&#x27;s message, Bachelot and Short decided to return to Hawaii. The Ayuntamiento in Los Angeles, a municipal council, attempted to dissuade Bachelot and asked the Catholic leadership in Santa Barbara to prevent him from leaving, but he insisted on departing and the Catholic leadership did not prevent him.

== Final years ==

When Bachelot and Short arrived in Honolulu in May 1837, they spent only 13 days on the island. Notwithstanding the agreement he had signed with French Naval Captain Abel Aubert du Petit-Thouars that allowed French citizens to live on the island, King sought to deport the priests. Bachelot and Short were confined to the ship on which they had arrived, the &quot;Clémentine&quot;, on . However, the &quot;Clémentine&quot;&#x27;s captain, Jules Dudoit, refused to transport them from Hawaii. Dudoit, a British citizen of French descent, met with Charlton, the British consul, and they publicly protested the priests&#x27; confinement. Their efforts to secure freedom for the priests to live on the island were unsuccessful until the British naval vessel HMS &quot;Sulphur&quot; and the French frigate the &quot;La Vénus&quot; arrived in Honolulu on . The ships were commanded respectively by Edward Belcher and Dupetit Thouars, who each tried to convince the authorities to allow the priests to return to the island. After negotiations proved futile, they blockaded the harbor, boarded the &quot;Clémentine&quot;, and brought Bachelot and Short ashore. The &quot;La Vénus&quot; sent 300 sailors to escort them from the harbor to the French mission. King agreed to allow the priests to stay in Honolulu until they could find a ship to transport them elsewhere, under the condition that they refrain from proselytizing.
That year, Bachelot, who suffered from a form of rheumatism, became very sick. By November 1837, he had recovered sufficiently to leave Hawaii. He purchased a ship and sailed toward Micronesia, intending to work on a mission. Bachelot&#x27;s health significantly worsened after leaving Hawaii and he died at sea on 5 December 1837. He was buried on an islet off the coast of Pohnpei. In 1838, a small chapel was built near his grave.

Owing to the persecution of Bachelot and his fellow priests, the government of France sent the frigate &quot;L&#x27;Artémise&quot; to Hawaii in 1839. Its captain, Cyrille Pierre Théodore Laplace, had been instructed to force the government to stop persecuting Catholics. In response to this show of force, King granted Catholics freedom of religion.

<text>The Judaizers were a faction of the Jewish Christians, both of Jewish and non-Jewish origins, who regarded the Levitical laws of the Old Testament as still binding on all Christians. They tried to enforce Jewish circumcision upon the Gentile converts to early Christianity and were strenuously opposed and criticized for their behavior by the Apostle Paul, who employed many of his epistles to refute their doctrinal positions.

The term is derived from the Koine Greek word Ἰουδαΐζειν (&quot;Ioudaizein&quot;), used once in the Greek New Testament (), when Paul publicly challenged the Apostle Peter for compelling Gentile converts to early Christianity to &quot;judaize&quot;. This episode is known as the incident at Antioch.

Most Christians believe that much of the Old Covenant has been superseded, and many believe it has been completely abrogated and replaced by the Law of Christ. The Christian debate over judaizing began in the lifetime of the apostles, notably at the Council of Jerusalem and the incident at Antioch. It has been carried on parallel to continuing debates about Paul the Apostle and Judaism, Protestant views of the Ten Commandments, and Christian ethics.

==Origin==
The meaning of the verb &quot;judaize&quot;, from which the noun &quot;Judaizer&quot; is derived, is derived from its various historical uses. Its biblical meaning is inferred and is not clearly defined beyond its obvious relationship to the word &quot;Jew.&quot; The &quot;Anchor Bible Dictionary,&quot; for example, says: &quot;The clear implication is that gentiles are being compelled to live according to Jewish customs.&quot;

The word &quot;Judaizer&quot; comes from &quot;judaize&quot;, which is seldom used in English Bible translations (an exception is the Young&#x27;s Literal Translation for Galatians 2:14).

==In the Early Church==
The Council of Jerusalem is generally dated to 48 AD, roughly 15 to 25 years after the crucifixion of Jesus, between 26 and 36 AD. Acts and Galatians both suggest that the meeting was called to debate whether male Gentiles who were converting to become followers of Jesus were required to become circumcised; the rite of circumcision was considered execrable and repulsive during the period of Hellenization of the Eastern Mediterranean and was especially adversed in Classical civilization both from ancient Greeks and Romans, which instead valued the foreskin positively.

Before Paul&#x27;s conversion, Christianity was part of Second Temple Judaism. Gentiles who wished to join the early Christian movement, which at the time comprised mostly Jewish followers, were expected to convert to Judaism, which likely meant submission to adult male circumcision for the uncircumcised, following the dietary restrictions of kashrut, and more. During the time period there were also &quot;partial converts&quot;, such as gate proselytes and God-fearers (i.e. Greco-Roman sympathizers which made an allegiance to Judaism but refused to convert and therefore retained their Gentile (non-Jewish) status), hence they were uncircumcised and it was not required for them to follow any of the commandments of the Mosaic Law.

The inclusion of Gentiles into early Christianity posed a problem for the Jewish identity of some of the early Christians: the new Gentile converts were not required to be circumcised nor to observe the Mosaic Law. Circumcision in particular was regarded as a token of the membership of the Abrahamic covenant, and the most traditionalist faction of Jewish Christians (i.e., converted Pharisees) insisted that Gentile converts had to be circumcised as well. Paul insisted that faith in Christ (see also Faith or Faithfulness) was sufficient for salvation, therefore the Mosaic Law was not binding for the Gentiles.

===New Testament===
In the New Testament, the Judaizers were a group of Jewish Christians who insisted that their co-religionists should follow the Mosaic Law and that Gentile converts to Christianity must first be circumcised (i.e. become Jewish through the ritual of a proselyte). Although such repressive and legalistic requirements may have made Christianity a much less appealing religious choice for the vast majority of Gentiles, the evidence afforded in Paul&#x27;s Epistle to the Galatians exhibits that initially a significant number of the Galatian Gentile converts appeared disposed to adopt these restrictions; indeed, Paul strenuously labors throughout the letter to dissuade them from doing so (cf. , , , ).

Paul was severely critical of the Judaizers within the early church and harshly reprimanded them for their doctrines and behavior. Paul saw the Judaizers as being both dangerous to the spread of the Gospel and propagators of grievous doctrinal errors. Many of his letters included in the New Testament (the Pauline epistles) contain considerable material disputing the view of this faction and condemning its practitioners. Paul publicly condemned Peter for his seemingly ambivalent reaction to the Judaizers, embracing them publicly in places where their preaching was popular while holding the private opinion that their doctrines were erroneous (cf. , , , , , , ).
That Gentile Christians should obey the Law of Moses was the assumption of some Jewish Christians in the early church, as represented by the group of Pharisees who had converted to Christianity in . Paul opposed this position, concluding that Gentiles did not need to obey to the entire Law of Moses in order to become Christians. The conflict between Paul and his Judaizing opponents over this issue came to a head with the Council of Jerusalem. According to the account given in Acts , it was determined by the Great Commission that Gentile converts to Christianity did not have to go through circumcision to be saved; but in addressing the second question as to whether or not they should obey the Torah, James the Just, brother of Jesus encouraged the Gentiles to &quot;abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication&quot; ().

Paul addresses this question in his Epistle to the Galatians, in which he condemned those who insisted that circumcision had to be followed for justification as &quot;false believers&quot; ():

Paul warns the early Galatian church that gentile Christians who submit to circumcision will be alienated from Christ: &quot;Indeed I, Paul, say to you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing. And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to keep the whole law. You have become estranged from Christ, you who attempt to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace.&quot; ().

The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; notes: &quot;Paul, on the other hand, not only did not object to the observance of the Mosaic Law, as long as it did not interfere with the liberty of the Gentiles, but he conformed to its prescriptions when occasion required (). Thus he shortly after circumcised Timothy (), and he was in the very act of observing the Mosaic ritual when he was arrested at Jerusalem ( sqq.).&quot;

===Circumcision controversy===
Paul, who called himself &quot;Apostle to the Gentiles&quot;, criticised the practice of circumcision, perhaps as an entrance into the New Covenant of Jesus. In the case of Timothy, whose mother was a Jewish Christian but whose father was a Greek, Paul personally circumcised him &quot;because of the Jews&quot; that were in town. Some believe that he appeared to praise its value in , yet later in Romans 2 we see his point. In he also disputes the value of circumcision. Paul made his case to the Christians at Rome that circumcision no longer meant the physical, but a spiritual practice. He also wrote: &quot;Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God&#x27;s commands is what counts.&quot;

Later Paul more explicitly denounced the practice, rejecting and condemning those Judaizers who promoted circumcision to Gentile Christians. He accused them of turning from the Spirit to the flesh: &quot;Are you so foolish, that, whereas you began in the Spirit, you would now be made perfect by the flesh?&quot; Paul warned that the advocates of circumcision as a condition of salvation were &quot;false brothers&quot;. He accused the advocates of circumcision of wanting to make a good showing in the flesh, and of glorying or boasting of the flesh. Paul instead stressed a message of salvation through faith in Christ opposed to the submission under the Mosaic Law that constituted a New Covenant with God, which essentially provides a justification for Gentiles from the harsh edicts of the Law, a New Covenant that didn&#x27;t require circumcision (see also Justification by faith, Pauline passages supporting antinomianism, Abrogation of Old Covenant laws).

His attitude towards circumcision varies between his outright hostility to what he calls &quot;mutilation&quot; in to praise in . However, such apparent discrepancies have led to a degree of skepticism about the reliability of Acts. Baur, Schwanbeck, De Wette, Davidson, Mayerhoff, Schleiermacher, Bleek, Krenkel, and others have opposed the authenticity of the Acts; an objection is drawn from the discrepancy between and . Some believe that Paul wrote the entire Epistle to the Galatians attacking circumcision, saying in chapter five: &quot;Behold, I Paul say unto you, if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.&quot;

The division between the Jews who followed the Mosaic Law and were circumcised and the Gentiles who were uncircumcised was highlighted in his Epistle to the Galatians:
===Extra-biblical sources===
&quot;Judaizer&quot; occurs once in Josephus&#x27; &quot;Jewish War&quot; 2.18.2, referring to the First Jewish–Roman War (66-73), written around 75:
It occurs once in the Apostolic Fathers collection, in Ignatius&#x27;s letter to the Magnesians 10:3 written around 100:
 Judaizing teachers are strongly condemned in the Epistle of Barnabas. (Although it did not become part of the Christian Biblical canon, it was widely circulated among Christians in the first two centuries and is part of the Apostolic Fathers.) Whereas Paul acknowledged that the Law of Moses and its observance were good when used correctly (&quot;the law is good, if one uses it lawfully&quot;, ), the Epistle of Barnabas condemns most Jewish practices, claiming that Jews had grossly misunderstood and misapplied the Law of Moses.

Justin Martyr (about 140) distinguishes two kinds of Jewish Christians: those who observe the Law of Moses but do not require its observance of others—with these he would hold communion—and those who believe the Mosaic law to be obligatory on all, whom he considers heretics (&quot;Dialogue with Trypho&quot; 47).

The Council of Laodicea of around 365 decreed 59 laws, #29:
According to Eusebius&#x27; &quot;History of the Church&quot; 4.5.3-4: the first 15 Bishops of Jerusalem were &quot;of the circumcision&quot;, although this in all likelihood is simply stating that they were Jewish Christians (as opposed to Gentile Christians), and that they observed biblical circumcision and thus likely the rest of Torah as well.

The eight homilies &quot;Adversus Judaeos&quot; (&quot;against the Jews&quot;) of John Chrysostom (347 – 407) deal with the relationship between Christians, Jews and Judaizers.

The influence of the Judaizers in the church diminished significantly after the destruction of Jerusalem, when the Jewish-Christian community at Jerusalem was dispersed by the Romans during the First Jewish–Roman War. The Romans also dispersed the Jewish leadership in Jerusalem in 135 during the Bar Kokhba Revolt. Traditionally it is believed the Jerusalem Christians waited out the Jewish–Roman wars in Pella in the Decapolis. These setbacks however didn&#x27;t necessarily mean an end to Jewish Christianity, any more than Valerian&#x27;s Massacre of 258, (when he killed all Christian bishops, presbyters, and deacons, including Pope Sixtus II and Antipope Novatian and Cyprian of Carthage), meant an end to Roman Christianity.
The Latin verb &quot;iudaizare&quot; is used once in the Vulgate where the Greek verb &quot;ioudaizein&quot; occurs at Galatians 2:14. Augustine in his &quot;Commentary on Galatians&quot;, describes Paul&#x27;s opposition in Galatia as those &quot;qui gentes cogebant iudaizare&quot; – &quot;who thought to make the Gentiles live in accordance with Jewish customs.&quot;

Christian groups following Jewish practices never completely vanished, although they had been designated as heretical by the 5th century.

==Later history==
===Russia===

Skhariya or Zacharias the Jew from Caffa led a sect of Judaizers in Russia. In 1480, Grand Prince Ivan III invited some of Zacharias&#x27;s prominent adherents to visit Moscow. The Judaizers enjoyed the support of high-ranking officials, of statesmen, of merchants, of Yelena Stefanovna (wife of Ivan the Young, heir to the throne) and of Ivan&#x27;s favorite deacon and diplomat Fyodor Kuritsyn. The latter even decided to establish his own club in the mid-1480s. However, in the end Ivan III renounced his ideas of secularization and allied with the Orthodox Christian clergy. The struggle against the adherents was led by hegumen Joseph Volotsky and his followers (иосифляне, &quot;iosiflyane&quot; or Josephinians) and by Archbishop Gennady of Novgorod. After uncovering adherents in Novgorod around 1487, Gennady wrote a series of letters to other churchmen over several years calling on them to convene &quot;sobors&quot; (&quot;church councils&quot;) with the intention &quot;not to debate them, but to burn them&quot;. Such councils took place in 1488, 1490, 1494 and 1504. The councils outlawed religious and non-religious books and initiated their burning, sentenced a number of people to death, sent adherents into exile, and excommunicated them. In 1491, Zacharias the Jew was executed in Novgorod by the order of Ivan III.

At various times since then, the Russian Orthodox Church has described several related Spiritual Christian groups as having a Judaizing character; the accuracy of this label – which was influenced by the early Christian polemics against Judaizers – has been disputed. The most famous of the Russian Empire&#x27;s Judaizing sects were the Karaimites
or Karaimizing-Subbotniks like Alexander Zaïd (1886–1938) who successfully settled in the Holy Land from 1904.

===Protestantism===

The Epistle to the Galatians strongly influenced Martin Luther at the time of the Protestant Reformation because of its exposition of justification by grace. Nevertheless, various sects of Messianic Jews such as Jews for Jesus have managed to stake out territory for themselves in the Protestant camp.

===Inquisitions===
This behavior was particularly persecuted from 1300 to 1800 during the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions, using as a basis the many references in the Pauline epistles regarding the &quot;Law as a curse&quot; and the futility of relying solely upon the Law for attaining salvation, known as legalism. Thus, in spite of Paul&#x27;s agreement at the Council of Jerusalem, Gentile Christianity came to understand that any Torah Laws were anathema, not only to Gentile Christians but also to Christians of Jewish extraction. Under the Spanish Inquisition, the penalty to a converted Jew for &quot;Judaizing&quot; was usually death by burning.

The Spanish word &quot;Judaizante&quot; was applied both to Jewish &quot;conversos&quot; who practiced some traditions from Judaism secretly and sometimes to Jews who had not converted, in Spain and the New World at the time of the Spanish Inquisition. 

Sometimes, accusations of being a Judaizer led to the persecution of Catholics of Converso descent who were completely innocent of preaching or doing anything heretical by the Catholic Church. For example, while serving as professor of Biblical scholarship at the University of Salamanca, the Augustinian friar and Renaissance humanism Luis de León both wrote and translated many immortal works of Christian poetry into the Spanish language. But, despite being a devout and believing Christian, Fray Luis was descended from a family of Spanish Jewish Conversos and this, as well as his vocal advocacy for teaching the Hebrew language in Catholic universities and seminaries, caused false accusations from the Dominicans of the heresies of being both a Marrano and a Judaiser. Fray Luis was accordingly imprisoned for four years by the Spanish Inquisition before he was ruled to be innocent of any wrongdoing and released without charge. While the conditions of his imprisonment were never harsh and he was allowed complete access to books, according to legend, Fray Luis started his first post-Inquisition University of Salamanca lecture with the words, &quot;As I was saying the other day...&quot;
The term &quot;Judaizers&quot; was used by the Spanish Inquisition and the inquisitions established in Mexico City, Lima, and Cartagena de Indias for Conversos (also termed Marranos) accused of continuing to observe the Jewish religion, as Crypto-Jews. Entry of Portuguese New Christians into Spain and the Spanish realms occurred during the Union of Crowns of Spain and Portugal, 1580–1640, when both kingdoms and their overseas empires were held by the same monarch. The Bnei Anusim are modern day Hispanic Judaizers.

===Contemporary Christianity===

The Coptic, Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox Churches all continue to practice male circumcision. In Torah-submissive Christian groups which include the Ethiopian Orthodox church, dietary laws and Saturday Sabbath are observed as well.

<doc id="908762" wikidata="Q6779041" url="?curid=908762" title="Mary Bernard Aguirre">
<text>Mary Bernard Aguirre (June 23, 1844 – May 24, 1906) was a public schoolteacher and instructor at the University of Arizona. 
== Early life ==
Bernard Aguirre was born in St. Louis, Missouri. She was the daughter of a wealthy merchant, Joab Bernard (1800–1879) and 
Arabella Mather Bier Bernard (1816–1899). For the first twelve years of her life the family resided in Baltimore, Maryland, the birthplace of Mary&#x27;s mother. In 1856 the Bernard family moved to Westport, Missouri, where Mary&#x27;s father owned a large store.

Bernard Aguirre went to college at the age of seventeen; this would prove to be a critical period of her life, as she lived through many moments that eventually changed her views towards people of other races. She heard the rifle shot that killed abolitionist John Brown in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia.

When Mary Bernard returned home from Baltimore, Maryland later that same year, the American Civil War broke out, and she became a supporter of the Southern cause.

== Personal life ==
Mary Bernard married a Mexican freighting contractor, Epifanio Aguirre, on August 21, 1862 in Westport. The Aguirres had three sons: Pedro, (born 1863), Epifanio Jr. (born 1865) and Stephen (born 1867).

Bernard Aguirre&#x27;s family moved to the Southwest in 1863. They traveled from Missouri to Las Cruces, New Mexico, with a stop in Santa Fe. Mary kept a journal of her family&#x27;s travels across the Great Plains.
In August 1869, the Aguirres set foot in Tucson. In January 1870, Epifanio Sr. was killed during an Apache raid of a stagecoach near Sasabe, Arizona. In economic straits, Bernard Aguirre saw herself forced to return home to Missouri and live with her parents.

== Career ==
In 1874, Mary Bernard Aguirre returned to Tucson, having accepted a job as a teacher in Tres Alamos. She taught in Tucson-area public schools, including the Tucson Public School for Girls, for four years. During this time, Bernard Aguirre advocated for public education against the prevailing inclination among Catholics towards homeschooling.

In 1878, she became the first teacher in Arivaca, sixty miles south of Tucson; during her tenure she was recruited to teach at the fledgling University of Arizona.

She became chair of the Spanish language and English history departments at the University of Arizona in 1885. She was the university&#x27;s first female professor, and resigned from the post in 1901.
In 1906, Mary Bernard Aguirre was injured in a Pullman train crash in California. On May 24, 1906, two weeks after the accident, she died of internal injuries.

==Legacy ==
*To honor her work during the early years of the school, the University of Arizona currently awards a Women&#x27;s and Gender Studies professorship in Aguirre&#x27;s name.
*In 1983 she was inducted into the Arizona Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

<doc id="908764" wikidata="Q4046690" url="?curid=908764" title="Perl Data Language">
<text>Perl Data Language (abbreviated PDL) is a set of free software array programming extensions to the Perl programming language. PDL extends the data structures built into Perl, to include large multidimensional arrays, and adds functionality to manipulate those arrays as vector objects. It also provides tools for image processing, machine learning, computer modeling of physical systems, and graphical plotting and presentation. Simple operations are automatically vectorized across complete arrays, and higher-dimensional operations (such as matrix multiplication) are supported.

==Language design==
PDL is a vectorized array programming language: the expression syntax is a variation on standard mathematical vector notation, so that the user can combine and operate on large arrays with simple expressions. In this respect, PDL follows in the footsteps of the APL programming language, and it has been compared to commercial languages such as MATLAB and Interactive Data Language, and to other free languages such as NumPy and Octave. Unlike MATLAB and IDL, PDL allows great flexibility in indexing and vectorization: for example, if a subroutine normally operates on a 2-D matrix array, passing it a 3-D data cube will generally cause the same operation to happen to each 2-D layer of the cube.

PDL borrows from Perl at least three basic types of program structure: imperative programming, functional programming, and pipeline programming forms may be combined. Subroutines may be loaded either via a built-in autoload mechanism or via the usual Perl module mechanism.

==Graphics==
True to the glue language roots of Perl, PDL borrows from several different modules for graphics and plotting support. NetPBM provides image file I/O (though FITS is supported natively). Gnuplot, PLplot, PGPLOT, and Prima modules are supported for 2-D graphics and plotting applications, and Gnuplot and OpenGL are supported for 3-D plotting and rendering.

==I/O==
PDL provides facilities to read and write many open data formats, including JPEG, PNG, GIF, PPM, MPEG, FITS, NetCDF, GRIB, raw binary files, and delimited ASCII tables. PDL programmers can use the CPAN Perl I/O libraries to read and write data in hundreds of standard and niche file formats.

==Machine learning==
PDL can be used for machine learning. It includes modules that are used to perform classic k-means clustering or general and generalized linear modeling methods such as ANOVA, linear regression, PCA, and logistic regression. Examples of PDL usage for regression modelling tasks include evaluating association between education attainment and ancestry differences of parents, comparison of RNA-protein interaction profiles that needs regression-based normalization and analysis of spectra of galaxies.

==perldl==
An installation of PDL usually comes with an interactive shell known as perldl, which can be used to perform simple calculations without requiring the user to create a Perl program file. A typical session of perldl would look something like the following:
perldl&gt; $x = pdl 1, 2], [3, 4;

perldl&gt; $y = pdl 5, 6, 7],[8, 9, 0;

perldl&gt; $z = $x x $y;

perldl&gt; p $z;
 [21 24 7]
 [47 54 21]


The commands used in the shell are Perl statements that can be used in a program with codice_1 module included. codice_2 is an overloaded operator for matrix multiplication, and codice_3 in the last command is a shortcut for codice_4.

==Implementation==
The core of PDL is written in C. Most of the functionality is written in PP, a PDL-specific metalanguage that handles the vectorization of simple C snippets and interfaces them with the Perl host language via Perl&#x27;s XS compiler. Some modules are written in Fortran, with a C/PP interface layer. Many of the supplied functions are written in PDL itself. PP is available to the user to write C-language extensions to PDL. There is also an Inline module (Inline::Pdlpp) that allows PP function definitions to be inserted directly into a Perl script; the relevant code is low-level compiled and made available as a Perl subroutine.

The PDL API uses the basic Perl 5 object-oriented functionality: PDL defines a new type of Perl scalar object (eponymously called a &quot;PDL&quot;, or &quot;ndarray&quot;) that acts as a Perl scalar, but that contains a conventional typed array of numeric or character values. All of the standard Perl operators are overloaded so that they can be used on PDL objects transparently, and PDLs can be mixed-and-matched with normal Perl scalars. Several hundred object methods for operating on PDLs are supplied by the core modules.

<text>Vanda Station was an Antarctic research base in the western highlands (Victoria Land) of the Ross Dependency, specifically on the shore of Lake Vanda, at the mouth of Onyx River, in the Wright Valley. It operated from 1969 to 1995, and was west of New Zealand&#x27;s Scott Base on Ross Island which remains in operation.

==History==

The four original station buildings were constructed in the austral summers of 1967–1968 and 1968–1969, just prior to the first winter-over by a five-man team from January to October 19, 1969. Subsequent wintering parties occupied the station in 1970 and 1974. During summer seasons, Vanda station was fully staffed until 1991. Scientific programs principally included meteorology, hydrology, seismology, earth currents, and magnetics. The station was administered by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR), and was supported logistically by the permanent New Zealand research base of Scott Base on Ross Island.

Vanda Station was well known for The Royal Lake Vanda Swim Club. Visitors to Lake Vanda Station could dip into the high salinity waters when the icecap edge melted out during summer to form a &quot;moat&quot;, and receive a Royal Lake Vanda Swim Club shoulder patch. Vanda staff would assist the melt by hacking out a &quot;pool&quot;. Many dignitaries and politicians were inducted into the club, The dip had to be naked (Rule 1), complete immersion (Rule 4), witnessed by a &quot;Vandal&quot; (Vanda Station staffer) and with no restrictions on photography (Rule 6) to qualify. Rule 10 allowed a natural figleaf, but it had to be natural and also naturally green without artificial aid.

In 1995, environment concerns resulted in the base being closed. Various activities associated with the base&#x27;s occupation, including excavations, the erection of buildings, disturbances caused by vehicle movements, the storage of consumables, waste disposal, and accidental spills, led to the effort to remove the station. Since removal, analysis of the lake water and algae was performed for a number of years to ensure the lake was not contaminated by greywater and other wastes.

There is now a street named after this base in Queenstown, New Zealand, called Vanda Place, and it is located just a few hundred metres from Scott Place.

Today, an automatic weather station is at the site of former Vanda Station, and &quot;Lake Vanda Hut&quot;, a shelter that is periodically (summer only) occupied by 2 to 8 New Zealand stream researchers.

<text>Osteoglossidae is a family of large-sized freshwater fish, which includes the arowanas. They are commonly known as bonytongues. The family has been regarded as containing two extant subfamilies Arapaiminae and Osteoglossinae, with a total of five living genera, but these are regarded as valid families in &quot;Eschmeyer&#x27;s Catalog of Fishes&quot; The extinct Phareodontinae are known from worldwide during the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene; they are generally considered to be crown group osteoglossids that are more closely related to one of the extant osteoglossid subfamilies than the other, though their exact position varies.

== Evolution ==
Osteoglossids are basal teleosts that originated during the Cretaceous, and are placed in the actinopterygian order Osteoglossiformes. The traditionally defined wider family includes several extant species from South America, one from Africa, two from Asia, and two from Australia. The earliest known osteoglossid is &quot;Cretophareodus&quot; from the middle Campanian of the Dinosaur Park Formation, Canada, but a potentially older genus may be &quot;Chanopsis&quot; from the Albian of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Although currently restricted to freshwater habitats in the tropics, the group was much more widespread during the Cretaceous and Paleogene, with genera known from North America and Europe, including marine taxa such as &quot;Brychaetus&quot;. An indeterminate marine osteoglossid is known to have inhabited the seas around Greenland in the Early Paleocene, and they later become diverse in marine habitats during the Eocene, with many genera known from Europe.

Modern osteoglossids of both subfamilies have a roughly Gondwanan distribution confined to freshwater habitats. For this reason, it was formerly assumed that extant osteoglossids descend from an ancestor that inhabited the supercontinent of Gondwana during the Mesozoic, which split into different genera following its fragmentation. However, more recent studies have found that many of the closest extinct relatives to extant osteoglossid genera were marine fish, and thus that their current distribution likely originates from marine dispersal between different continents during the Paleogene. Incorporating both extant and extinct osteoglossids, at least four different colonizations of freshwater habitats from marine ones are predicted to have occurred.

== Taxonomy ==
The following taxa are known from the family: 

* Family Osteoglossidae 
** Genus ?†&quot;Chanopsis&quot; 
** Genus ?†&quot;Chauliopareion&quot; (possibly a basal osteoglossiform)
** Genus †&quot;Heterosteoglossum&quot; (possibly an arapaimine)&quot;&quot;
** Genus ?†&quot;Singida&quot; (possibly a basal osteoglossiform)
** Genus †&quot;Xosteoglossid&quot; (possibly an arapaimine)&quot;&quot;

<doc id="908784" wikidata="Q145409" url="?curid=908784" title="Arapaima gigas">
<text>Arapaima gigas, also known simply as Arapaima, pirarucu, or paiche, is a species of arapaima native to the basin of the Amazon River. Once believed to be the sole species in the genus, it is among the largest freshwater fish. The species is an obligate air breather, so it needs to come to the surface regularly to breathe air.

==Taxonomy==

&quot;Arapaima gigas&quot; was originally regarded as the only species in the genus &quot;Arapaima&quot; (monotypic), but the subsequent identification of further species, together with the rarity of specimens and the loss of several type specimens, has led to some uncertainty regarding classification within the genus and the identity of described individuals. Recently, some studies have added extra species to the genus due to common morphological features, including &quot;Arapaima leptosoma&quot; and &quot;Arapaima agassizii.&quot; These speciation events may have occurred due to evidence of &quot;long-distance marine or geodispersal&quot; from similar morphological traits in both fossilized and living specimen within the genus. Overall, it is unclear if &quot;Arapaima gigas&quot; truly is the only species in its genus.

==Description==
The species is among the largest known freshwater fish, commonly measuring and reportedly exceptionally reaching lengths of up to . Adults may weigh up to . Of the total body weight, head weight is typically 10.3% to 12.8%. 

It is an ancient fish, belonging to a group of primitive carnivorous bony-tongued fishes. &quot;A. gigas&quot; has a streamlined body with dorsal and anal fins set well back towards the tail. While the body is mainly gray to gray-green, its Brazilian local name &quot;pirarucu&quot; derives from an indigenous word for &quot;red fish&quot;, thought to refer to either the red flecks on the scales towards the tail, or the reddish-orange color of its meat. Red coloration typically shows up in males after sexual maturation, with up to 70% of the total body plan in males having red coloration.

The fish have &quot;flexible, armor-like scales&quot; made up of &quot;a hard, mineralized outer layer&quot; and &quot;a tough-but-flexible inner layer&quot; that help protect it from attacks by piranhas. The scales, which are typically 5–7cm but can reach 10cm in larger individuals, are built from collagen fibers in a layered structure. On the body, they overlap each other to form the armor-like characteristic.

==Distribution and history==
&quot;A. gigas&quot; is native to freshwater in the basin of the Amazon River and Tocantins-Araguaia (Brazil) river basins; it is known to occur in Brazil and Peru.
In Bolivia and Peru known as &quot;paiche&quot;, it is considered an invasive species in most parts, affecting local native species and the ecosystem. Other small populations have been found in the Iquitos region of Peru, four distinct rivers in Ecuador, Colombia, and Guyana.

Its populations are increasing and becoming more common in its non-native range, yet is rapidly declining in its native range. It was first found in 1976, introduced into the Madre de Dios region in Peru, for aquaculture. In about a decade, arapaimas were found in Bolivian waters due to the connection of the Madre de Dios basin to the Beni River in Bolivia. Rising water of aquaculture ponds allowed fish to escape into the watershed and establishing populations outside of containment.
Current distribution in Bolivia is characterized by 70 registered distribution points, including small rivers, lagoons, and streams between the Beni and Madre de Dios (Peru) rivers. Historical reports of arapaima sightings started north near the border of Peru, then traveled downstream as populations began to establish and spatially separate. In less than 30 years, the species has invaded the Madre de Dios and Beni watersheds.
The species has been introduced to parts of East Asia, both for fishing purposes and accidentally. The fish are found in flooded forest areas where they reproduce during the wet season; they relocate to lakes after water levels drop. It is also distributed by ornamental aquaculture and commonly pet-traded in Europe, North America, South America, and Asia. There are fish farms in Thailand and Malaysia. It is particularly prominent in Java and Sumatra regions in Indonesia. Studies found some single individuals in freshwater or dead in shallow water. One finding recorded a total of 22 individuals in Surabaya, which is the second largest Indonesian city.

A 13-million-year-old fossil of arapaima (or very similar species) has been found in Colombia, in the Villavieja Formation, which dates from the Miocene epoch.

== Physiology ==
Average lifespan in captivity is 15–20 years. There is no sufficient evidence on lifespan in the wild.

&quot;A. gigas&quot; grows rapidly, reaching about 10kg in its first year, then at moderate growth rates once reaching sexual maturity, around 5 years of age or 1.65m length. Morphology changes occur as an individual undergoes the transition from water-breather to air-breather 8–9 days after hatch. During the transition to air-breathing, the structure of the gills changes, making them better adapted for ion absorption, but less able to undergo gas diffusion. Once developmental changes in the gills take place, the lamella is less recognizable. The adult gills are made up of smooth, column-shaped filaments. The kidneys have an important role in nitrogenous waste excretion in this species and are enlarged in adult fish.

Phenotypic sex of &quot;A. gigas&quot; juveniles is not differentiated, meaning the gonad cells can produce both sexes. In females, only the left ovary was developed which differs in size during the reproductive cycle. It increases as maturation occurs, then reduces after spawning. Females have a genital pore on their ventral (under) side that connects the reproductive organs with external environment to allow for mating. In males, only a left testis was developed, which was small and did not differ in size during the reproductive cycle. Both reproductive organs are unpaired and situated near the swim bladder. In some cases, right gonads were found but atrophic.

Both males and females have a gland-like secretory organ on the head, mostly used for communication with offspring and is therefore more prominent in males—who provide the majority of parental care. The secretion is made of 400 substances and consist of hormones, proteins, peptides and likely pheromones which also provides nutrients for fry (freshly hatched fish).

== Ecology ==

=== Breathing ===
&quot;A. gigas&quot; requires breathing surface air to supplement the oxygen it derives from the use of its gills, and as such, is dependent on surfacing every 5–15 minutes to loudly gulp air at the surface. As in other species in the genus, a modified swim bladder that contains lung-like tissue is used for this purpose.

=== Feeding ===
The species are specialized carnivores, feeding primarily on fish. Invertebrates are also part of their diet. Juveniles prefer insects and fish larvae until fully grown. Seasonal growth is observed due food selectivity and strong seasonal changes in food availability. They also consume birds, mammals, fruits, and seeds on the water surface. Prey fish families include Callichthyidae, Loricariidae, Pimelodidae, and Heptapteridae.

=== Migration ===
The species undergoes seasonal lateral migration between river channels and floodplains driven by low depth and low current velocity. The lake and forest habitats seem to be preferred. When water levels are high, &quot;A. gigas&quot; fish migrated to flooded forests with increasingly rising levels. When water levels decline, fish begin to migrate towards lower levels of flooded forests, then to lakes where they stay when it is physically isolated due to low water levels. Migration to the flooded forest is a mechanism for feeding and parental care, with prey (for both adults and offspring) having increased densities in this habitat at the high-water season. During high water levels, &quot;A. gigas&quot; populations have high densities in lakes, due to increased survival rates (physical safety), feeding (adequate feeding rates), and promoting reproduction (courtship and mating activities).

=== Spawning ===
Sexual maturity is reached at 5 years, and female fecundity increases with each year. Spawning occurs in lakes and river channels during the time of low water levels (August to March) in small, separate clutches with an average of less than 500 eggs in each batch. Parents have been observed using their mouths to dig holes in the substrate to create a nest for eggs. Small, batched spawning strategy is thought to derive from the unpredictability of the environment, as it lowers the total loss of fertilized eggs due to natural events. In the event of reproductive failures, pairs may breed again for better success. Males remain to protect the offspring for three to six months. Body mass and muscle yield does not differ during sexual maturation cycles, unlike many other fish species. Red pigment among males is thought to be used for sexual selection as it is a proxy for age.
==Conservation==
A. gigas’ genetic diversity has been greatly impacted due to habitat loss, environmental degradation, and commercial overexploitation in native fish stocks, as extreme as causing bottlenecks in some populations. In its native ecosystems, it helps to cycle nutrients and energy. Loss of migration paths from anthropogenic actions separates local populations and forms refuges that can persevere, but without the exchange of genes. The species has in the past been heavily impacted by overfishing, exacerbated by their need to surface for breathing every 5 to 15 minutes, causing them to be easy to harpoon. It is classified under the IUCN as &quot;Data Deficient&quot; due to a lack of detailed information about population developments. In addition, &quot;Arapaima&quot; gigas is listed in the CITES Appendix II since 1975, forcing legal harvest to be monitored under intergovernmental control with a management plan. Furthermore, in 2004, it was published in the Brazilian List of Overexploited or Threatened with Over Exploitation Aquatic Invertebrates and Fishes. There are reports that local populations have become extinct in certain areas of Brazil and Peru.

Aquaculture has further threatened diversity through transportation of specimens over hundreds of kilometers. This can cause homogenized genes and, in some cases, wipe out locally adapted populations. A study of &quot;Genetic Diversity of &quot;Arapaima gigas&quot; in the Araguaia-Tocantins basin estimated by ISSR marker&quot; by Vitorino, et al. found that low heterozygosity existed in populations that underwent bottleneck scenarios, which is assumed to be from inbreeding and low reproductive success. Low heterozygosity can detriment future evolutionary potential of species. The study suggests &quot;periodic monitoring to check eventual reducing levels of population genetic variability and the establishment of management plan.&quot; So far, no technology exists to manipulate the reproduction of the species.

Arapaima fishing was banned outright in Brazil from 1996 to 1999, due to declining populations; since then, both subsistence and commercial fishing have been permitted in specially designated areas, and a sophisticated sustainable management strategy has led to massive recovery of stocks, from 2,500 in 1999 to over 170,000 in 2017. However, there are still large markets of illegal arapaima fishing in the lower Amazon, with about 77% of its harvest coming from unlawful practices. Furthermore, local community-based initiatives have been established to protect waterways for natural reproduction and reestablishment of populations.

== Invasion ==
&quot;Arapaima gigas&quot; follows what is coined as the &quot;Biodiversity Conservation Paradox&quot;, where a species has become endangered in its native habitat yet becoming growingly invasive in nonnative home ranges. Previously discussed in the &quot;Distribution&quot; section of this page, aquaculture for both fish meat and ornamental markets has caused the spread of the fish where it has become invasive and threaten the integrity of ecosystems. In some parts of Brazil, juvenile individuals are captured and bred in captivity, then dispersed and exported by traders for aquaculture profit.

=== South America ===
For Bolivia, the Arapaima as an invasive species is considered a threat to local native species according to reports. Various reports show a correlation between the spreading of Arapaima and the decline in numbers of native fish species in parts of the Bolivian Amazon. Effects on local fish species populations and on fishing behaviors vary strongly by region. A joint study of the Bolivian government and different research organizations from 2017 points out the necessity to further evaluate the complex environmental and socioeconomic impact of Arapaima in the country.

Oftentimes, introduction comes from accidentally escaped aquaculture groups, or for purposeful control of undesirable prey in parts of Brazil and south-eastern Peru. As discussed in the &quot;Distribution&quot; section, once established in the Madre de Dios region in Peru, populations moved to Bolivian waters through connections through the Beni River watershed. The Beni River has few natural barriers, theoretically allowing the arapaima populations to continue evading further south and terrorizing native fishes in Bolivia and even western Brazil.

=== Indonesia ===
As an invasive species in Indonesia, there are subsequent consequences that can be followed in the future, as populations are not yet established enough to significantly affect native species. However, it can be assumed that risks would be similar to events observed in Bolivia and Brazil such as decrease in native populations and fishing stock. Some fishermen even say that these large bony-tongued fish damage their nets, therefore causing socio-economic losses. One study specifically focused on &quot;A. gigas&quot; in Indonesia found no fry or juveniles in the wild, but one female was found with eggs. This, with the finding of climate matching, causes the inability to rule out successful reproduction and establishment in the region. For now, it is suggested to understand the reproduction and ecology in introduced arapaimas in Indonesia in order to properly propose management strategies and fishing/trading sanctions.

== Cultural importance ==
&quot;Arapaima gigas&quot; are exploited for fish meat markets and ornamental fishing which can include production, as it has been noted that the characteristic armored scales are commonly used as nail files in areas around the Amazon basin. Fishing and aquaculture provides many jobs in the region, in addition to the fish being an important traditional food for local communities.

<text>Fura-2, an aminopolycarboxylic acid, is a ratiometric fluorescent dye which binds to free intracellular calcium. It was the first widely used dye for calcium imaging, and remains very popular. Fura-2 is excited at 340 nm and 380 nm of light, and the ratio of the emissions at those wavelengths is directly related to the amount of intracellular calcium. Regardless of the presence of calcium, Fura-2 emits at 510 nm of light. The use of the ratio automatically cancels out confounding variables, such as variable dye concentration and cell thickness, making Fura-2 one of the most appreciated tools to quantify calcium levels. The high photon yield of fura-2 allowed the first real time (video rate) measurements of calcium inside living cells in 1986. More recently, genetically encoded calcium indicators based on spectral variants of the green fluorescent protein, such as Cameleons, have supplemented the use of Fura-2 and other small molecule dyes for calcium imaging, but Fura-2 remains faster.

<text>Tielman (or Tylman) Susato (&quot;c.&quot; 1510/15 – after 1570) was a Renaissance composer, instrumentalist and publisher of music in Antwerp.

==Biography==
While Susato&#x27;s exact place of birth is unknown, some scholars believe that because of his name—Susato meaning de Soest, of the town of Soest — he may be from the town of that name in Westphalia, or the town of Soest in The Netherlands.

Not much is known about his early life, but he begins appearing in various Antwerp archives of around 1530 working as a calligrapher as well as an instrumentalist: trumpet, flute and tenor pipe are listed as instruments that he owned.

In 1543, he founded the first music publishing house using movable music type in the Low Countries. He could be found in Antwerp, &quot;At the Sign of the Crumhorn.&quot; Until Susato set up his press in Antwerp, music printing had been done mainly in Italy, France and Germany. Soon afterwards, Susato was joined by Petrus Phalesius the Elder in Leuven and Christopher Plantin, also in Antwerp, and the Low Countries became a regional center of music publishing. It is possible that Susato also ran a musical instrument business, and he attempted several times to form partnerships with other publishers but none was successful. In 1561 his son Jacob Susato, who died in 1564, took over his publishing business. Tielman Susato first moved to Alkmaar, North Holland, and later to Sweden. The last known record of him dates from 1570.

Susato was also an accomplished composer. He wrote (and published) several books of masses and motets which are in the typical imitative polyphonic style of the time. He also wrote two books of chansons which were specifically designed to be sung by young, inexperienced singers: they are for only two or three voices. Most important of his publications in terms of distribution and influence were the &quot;Souterliedekens&quot; of Clemens non Papa, which were metrical psalm settings in Dutch, using the tunes of popular songs. They were hugely popular in the Netherlands in the 16th century.

Susato also was a prolific composer of instrumental music, and much of it is still recorded and performed today. He produced one book of dance music in 1551, &quot;Het derde musyck boexken ... alderhande danserye&quot;, composed of pieces in simple but artistic arrangement. Most of these pieces are dance forms (allemandes, galliards, and so forth).

Often Susato dedicated his publications to prominent citizens of the town. Sometimes he devoted an entire volume to the works of one composer (for example Manchicourt and Crecquillon). Not surprisingly, he seems to have favored other Flemish composers as subjects for publication. He was also one of the first to publish music of the acclaimed late Renaissance composer Orlande de Lassus.

<text>Cachuma Lake is a reservoir in the Santa Ynez Valley of central Santa Barbara County, California on the Santa Ynez River adjoining the north side of California State Route 154. The artificial lake was created by the construction of Bradbury Dam, a earth-fill structure built by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation in 1953. Its surface area covers , with a maximum design capacity of , but it is currently limited to due to sediment accumulation.
The late-December 2022 and early-January 2023 storms dramatically raised the water level in the lake, from an average of 33% full to 100% full for the first time in 12 years.

==History ==
Built by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation in 1953, the name &quot;Cachuma&quot; comes from a Chumash village that the Spanish spelled &quot;Aquitsumu&quot;, from the Barbareño Chumash word &quot;aqitsu&#x27;m&quot;, meaning &quot;sign&quot;.

The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation oversees the lake’s operations and maintenance. Five agencies that stretch from Santa Ynez to Carpinteria take water from Cachuma. The Central Coast Water Authority (CCWA) extension of the California Aqueduct completed in 1997, is a that travels from Vandenberg Space Force Base through Vandenberg Village, Lompoc, Buellton, and Solvang and terminates at Cachuma.

=== Water Levels ===
The water levels of the lake are highly variable, spilling in some years and receding to less than 10% of capacity in dry years. Drought conditions can cause shortage in water supplies, as did the 2011-17 drought.

In October 2016, the lake approached low levels not seen since the construction of Bradbury Dam. The lake level reached a minimum of on October 14, more than below the spillway elevation. At this time, the storage volume was only , approximately 7.3% of capacity.

In January and February 2017, a series of frequent rains raised the water level substantially. On one day, February 17, 2017, the lake rose by during the storm alone, followed by further increases from storm runoff. By the end of February 2017, the Lake had become 44.5% full, with a total volume of . The Lake&#x27;s water level declined again during the 2017-18 water year, with the Lake receding to less than one-third of its capacity. By March 28, 2019, above-normal precipitation had restored Lake Cachuma to 78.0% of its capacity.

Despite an abnormally dry January and February 2020, a wet March and April brought the lake to 77% of capacity as of April 7, 2020.

Several consecutive atmospheric river storms coming in from the Pacific in late-December, 2022 and early-January, 2023 dramatically raised the water level in the lake, from an average of 33% full in late December, to nearly 100% full by January 15, 2023 for the first time in 12 years. Further storms in February resulted in flood warnings for portions of Lompoc close to the river due to the water being released from the dam.

==Recreation==
Santa Barbara County Parks offers cabin and yurt rentals, as well as RV, tent, and group camping. Gasoline and groceries are available at the general store. There is a full boat and kayak rental facility with a bait and tackle shop where fishing licenses can be purchased. The lake is stocked with rainbow trout throughout the winter season, and fishing is open all year from shore or boat. There are five miles of hiking trails within the park, and Los Padres National Forest trails close by.

A large campsite on the south shore of Cachuma Lake is administered by the Santa Barbara County Park&#x27;s division of the Community Services Department.

The University of California, Santa Barbara rowing team regularly practices and races at Cachuma Lake and erected a permanent boathouse there just prior to the 1982-1983 school year. The lake is also a popular destination for viewing bald eagles from seasonal tour boats.

Body contact activities such as swimming, wading, or water skiing in Cachuma Lake have been restricted since the park opened in the 1950s, reasoning that the lake was a reservoir people depend upon for drinking water. In May 2011, the no body contact regulation was revised to allow human-powered recreational watercraft such as kayaks and canoes on the lake as well as allow dogs on boats and eliminate &quot;incidental body contact&quot; with the water as a punishable offense.

Solvang, California is approximately to the west of Lake Cachuma. The town of Santa Ynez, California is approximately to the west of Bradbury Dam.

==Natural history activities and programs==

Santa Barbara County Parks offers a variety of natural programs including wildlife lake cruises, nature walks, junior ranger programs, campfire programs on summer weekends, and a family-oriented live animal event in the fall. School and community group environmental education field trips are available all year.

=== Neal Taylor Nature Center ===
Located in Santa Barbara, the Neal Taylor Nature Center, formerly the Cachuma Lake Nature Center, features exhibits and hands-on displays about the area&#x27;s cultural and natural history, including local plants, animals, birds and geology. The nature center is open year-round and admission is free. The center offers youth and adult workshops and lectures as well as school and youth nature education programs in partnership with the Santa Barbara County Parks natural history programs.

<text>Terms of service (also known as terms of use and terms and conditions, commonly abbreviated as TOS or ToS, ToU or T&amp;C) are the legal agreements between service providers and the service consumers. The person must agree to abide by the terms of service in order to use the offered service. Terms of service can also be merely a disclaimer, especially regarding the use of websites. Vague language and lengthy sentences used in these terms of service have caused concerns about customer privacy and raised public awareness in many ways.

==Usage==
A terms of service agreement is mainly used for legal purposes by companies which provide software or services, such as web browsers, e-commerce, web search engines, social media, and transport services. 

A legitimate terms of service agreement is legally binding and may be subject to change. Companies can enforce the terms by refusing service. Customers can enforce by filing a lawsuit or arbitration case if they can show they were actually harmed by a breach of the terms. There is a heightened risk of data going astray during corporate changes, including mergers, divestitures, buyouts, downsizing, etc., when data can be transferred improperly.

==Content==
A terms of service agreement typically contains sections pertaining to one or more of the following topics:

*Disambiguation/definition of keywords and phrases
*User rights and responsibilities
**Proper or expected usage; definition of misuse
**Accountability for online actions, behavior, and conduct
**Privacy policy outlining the use of personal data
**Payment details such as membership or subscription fees, etc.
**Opt-out policy describing procedure for account termination, if available
**Sometimes contains an Arbitration clause detailing the dispute resolution process and limited rights to take a claim to court 
*Disclaimer/Limitation of liability, clarifying the site&#x27;s legal liability for damages incurred by users
*User notification upon modification of terms, if offered

Among 102 companies marketing genetic testing to consumers in 2014 for health purposes, 71 had publicly available terms and conditions:
*57 of the 71 had disclaimer clauses (including 10 disclaiming liability for injury caused by their own negligence)
*51 let the company change terms (including 17 without notice)
*34 allow data disclosure in certain circumstances
*31 require consumers to indemnify the company
*20 promise not to sell data

Among 260 mass market consumer software license agreements in 2010:
*91% disclaimed warranties of merchantability or fitness for purpose or said it was &quot;As is&quot;
*92% disclaimed consequential, incidental, special or foreseeable damages
*69% did not warrant the software was free of defects or would work as described in the manual
*55% capped damages at the purchase price or less
*36% said they were not warranting whether it infringed others&#x27; intellectual property rights
*32% required arbitration or a specific court
*17% required the customer to pay legal bills of the maker (indemnification), but not vice versa

Among the terms and conditions of 31 cloud-computing services in January-July 2010, operating in England:
*27 specified the law to be used (a US state or other country)
*most specify that consumers can claim against the company only in a particular city in that jurisdiction, though often the company can claim against the consumer anywhere
*some require claims to be brought within half a year to 2 years
*7 impose arbitration, all forbid illegal and objectionable conduct by the consumer
*13 can amend terms just by posting changes on their own website
*a majority disclaim responsibility for confidentiality or backups
*most promise to preserve data only briefly after terminating service
*few promise to delete data thoroughly when the customer leaves
*some monitor the customers&#x27; data to enforce their policies on use
*all disclaim warranties and almost all disclaim liability
*24 require the customer to indemnify them, a few indemnify the customer
*a few give credits for poor service, 15 promise &quot;best efforts&quot; and can suspend or stop at any time
The researchers note that rules on location and time limits may be unenforceable for consumers in many jurisdictions with consumer protections, that acceptable use policies are rarely enforced, that quick deletion is dangerous if a court later rules the termination wrongful, that local laws often require warranties (and UK forced Apple to say so).

==Readability==

Among the 500 most-visited websites which use sign-in-wrap agreements in September 2018: 
*70% of agreements had average sentence lengths over 25 words, (where 25 or less is needed for consumer readability)
*median FRE (Flesch Reading Ease) score was 34 (where over 60 is considered readable by consumers)
*median F-K (Flesch-Kincaid) score was 15 years of school (498 of 500 had scores higher than the recommended 8th grade)

Among 260 mass market consumer software license agreements which existed in both 2003 and 2010:
*median and mean Flesch scores were 33 in both years, with a range from 14 to 64 in 2003, and from 15 to 55 in 2010 (where over 60 is considered readable by consumers)
*median number of words rose from 1,152 to 1,354, with range of 33 to 8,406 in 2003, and from 106 to 13,416 in 2010

==Public awareness==

A 2013 documentary called &quot;Terms and Conditions May Apply&quot; publicized issues in terms of services. It was reviewed by 54 professional critics and won for Best Feature Documentary at the Newport Beach Film Festival 2013 and for Best Documentary at the Sonoma Valley Film Festival 2013.

Clickwrapped.com rates 15 companies on their policies and practices with respect to using users&#x27; data, disclosing users&#x27; data, amending the terms, closing users&#x27; accounts, requiring arbitration, fining users, and clarity. 

Terms of Service; Didn&#x27;t Read is a group effort that rates 67 companies&#x27; terms of service and privacy policies, though its site says the ratings are &quot;outdated.&quot; It also has browser add-ons that deliver the ratings while at the website of a rated company. Members of the group score each clause in each terms of service document, but &quot;the same clause can have different scores depending on the context of the services it applies to.&quot; The Services tab lists companies in no apparent order, with brief notes about significant clauses from each company. In particular, competitors are not listed together so that users can compare them. A link gives longer notes. It does not typically link to the exact wording from the company. The Topics tab lists topics (like &quot;Personal Data&quot; or &quot;Guarantee&quot;), with brief notes from some companies about aspects of the topic.

TOSBack.org, supported by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, lists changes in terms and policies sequentially, 10 per page, for 160 pages, or nearly 1,600 changes, for &quot;many online services.&quot; There does not seem to be a way to find all changes for a particular company, or even which companies were tracked in any time period. It links to Terms of Service; Didn&#x27;t Read, though that typically does not have any evaluation of the most recent changes listed at TOSBack.org.

Terms of services are subject to change and vary from service to service, so several initiatives exist to increase public awareness by clarifying such differences in terms, including:
* Availability of previous terms
* Cancellation or termination of the account and/or service by user
* Copyright licensing on user content
* Data tracking policy and opt-out availability
* Indemnification or compensation for claims against account or content
* Notification and feedback prior to changes in terms
* Notification of government or third-party requests for personal data
* Notification prior to information transfer in event of merger or acquisition
* Pseudonym allowance
* Readability
* Saved or temporary first and third-party cookies
* Transparency of security practices
* Transparency on government or law enforcement requests for content removal

==Criticism and lawsuits==

===AOL===
In 1994, the &quot;Washington Times&quot; reported that America Online (AOL) was selling detailed personal information about its subscribers to direct marketers, without notifying or asking its subscribers. That article led to the revision of AOL&#x27;s terms of service three years later.

On July 1, 1997, AOL posted their revised terms of service to take effect July 31, 1997, without formally notifying its users of the changes made, most notably a new policy which would grant third-party business partners, including a marketing firm, access to its members&#x27; telephone numbers. Several days before the changes were to take effect, an AOL member informed the media of the changes and the following news coverage incited a large influx of internet traffic on the AOL page which enabled users to opt out of having their names and numbers on marketing lists.

===Sony===
In 2011, George Hotz and other members of failOverflow were sued by Sony Corporation. Sony claimed that Hotz and others had committed breach of contract by violating the terms of service of the PlayStation Network and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

===Instagram===

On December 17, 2012, Instagram and Facebook announced a change to their terms of use that caused a widespread outcry from its user base. The controversial clause stated: &quot;you agree that a business or other entity may pay us to display your username, likeness, photos (along with any associated metadata), and/or actions you take, in connection with paid or sponsored content or promotions, without any compensation to you&quot;.

There was no apparent option to opt out of the changed terms of use.
The move garnered severe criticism from privacy advocates as well as consumers. After one day, Instagram apologized, saying that it would remove the controversial language from its terms of use. Kevin Systrom, a co-founder of Instagram, responded to the controversy, stating:

===Zappos===
Some terms of services are worded to allow unilateral amendment, where one party can change the agreement at any time without the other party&#x27;s consent. A 2012 court case &quot;In re Zappos.com, Inc., Customer Data Security Breach Litigation&quot; held that Zappos.com&#x27;s terms of use, with one such clause, was unenforceable.

===The Walt Disney Company===
On October 5, 2023, a 42-year-old woman named Kanokporn Tangsuan (who worked as a doctor at NYU Langone Health) was killed at Raglan Road Irish Pub at Disney Springs in Walt Disney World after going into anaphylactic shock due to increased levels of dairy and nuts in her system. Her widower, Jeffery Piccolo, filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Disney in February 2024, claiming that she had alerted staff to her severe allergy to both multiple times, but was ignored. On May 31, Disney filed a motion to get the lawsuit dismissed, citing the terms of service of both the My Disney Experience app (which they booked tickets from) and Disney+ (which they had used a free trial of in the past). This term would require all legal disputes against Disney and its affiliates to be held in an individual binding arbitration. The story&#x27;s publicization in August 2024 prompted severe backlash against the Walt Disney Company, with many moving to cancel their subscriptions to Disney+ and for a boycott of other Disney products and services. Piccolo&#x27;s legal team also argued against Disney&#x27;s claims, first stating that the terms of service on both platforms were &quot;effectively invisible&quot;, and that Piccolo &quot;would have had no notice&quot; of the conditions. They also argued that Piccolo&#x27;s use of these services should have no effect on Tangsaun&#x27;s right to be represented in this case. Disney responded by claiming to be &quot;deeply sorry&quot; of the death, and that they were only defending themselves against a lawsuit towards the entire corporation. The motion for the dismissal of the case was later withdrawn by Disney on August 20, 2024.

<doc id="908800" wikidata="Q7527156" url="?curid=908800" title="Sir Henry Holland, 1st Baronet">
<text>Sir Henry Holland, 1st Baronet, FRS (27 October 1788 – 27 October 1873) was an English physician and travel writer. 

==Early life==
Born in Knutsford, Cheshire, Holland was the son of the physician Peter Holland (1766–1853) and his wife Mary Willets. Peter&#x27;s sister Elizabeth was the mother of the novelist Elizabeth Gaskell, and Mary was the niece of the potter Josiah Wedgwood. He studied medicine at Edinburgh University (MA, 1811).

==Career==
He had an extensive practice and was Domestic Physician to Caroline, Princess of Wales (briefly in 1814) and Physician Extraordinary to William IV and to Queen Victoria. He was also Physician in Ordinary to Queen Victoria in 1852. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in January, 1815 and served on the council three times. He was created a Baronet in 1853.

Scientifically, Holland made an early contribution to the Germ theory of disease in his essay &quot;On the hypothesis of insect life as a cause of disease?&quot; in &quot;Medical Notes and Reflections&quot;, 1839.

==Travel==
Holland gained fame through his travel writings, having travelled to Iceland and through the Balkans and the Iberian Peninsula, while the British were at war with France. He was also a talented society physician, and between his good looks, his charm, and his experiences and conversation, he was much in demand.

On 4 December 1836 Holland attended a party hosted by Fanny and Hensleigh Wedgwood for their relatives, shortly after Charles Darwin returned from the &quot;Beagle&quot; voyage. Darwin had sent home packets of his &quot;journal&quot;, and he asked his relatives about captain FitzRoy&#x27;s intent of incorporating it into the published &quot;Narrative&quot;. Holland &quot;looked over a few pages, and evidently thought that it would not be worth while to publish it alone, as it would be partly going over the same ground with the Captain.&quot; Darwin thought the &quot;little Dr talked much good sense&quot;, but Emma Wedgwood did not think Holland &quot;any judge as to what is amusing or interesting&quot;, and Hensleigh felt if Holland &quot;thought it would not do for publication it only affects my opinion of his taste &amp; not the least in the world the merits of the thing itself&quot;. Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Journal and Remarks&quot; became well known as &quot;The Voyage of the Beagle&quot;.

Holland died on his 85th birthday, 27 October 1873, at his house in Brook Street, London.

==Family==
In 1822 he married, Margaret Emma Caldwell (1795–1830, known as Emma), with whom he had two sons and two daughters:
* Henry Holland, 1st Viscount Knutsford (1825–1914)
* Francis James Holland (1828–1907)
* Emily Mary Holland (1824–1908) married Charles Buxton; their son was Sydney Buxton, 1st Earl Buxton
* Elinor Anne Holland (1826–1829)

Emma died on 2 February 1830. He later became son-in-law to the wit Sydney Smith whose daughter, Saba, he married as his second wife, with whom he had two daughters:
* Caroline Holland (1834–1909), author of &quot;Notebooks of a Spinster Lady&quot;, publ. posth. 1919
* Gertrude Holland (1840–1898)

<text>Louis Gridley Wu, a fictional character, is the protagonist in the &quot;Ringworld&quot; series of books, written by Larry Niven.

Louis Wu was born in 2650 to Carlos Wu and Sharrol Janss. When he appears in &quot;Ringworld&quot;, Louis is 6′2″ (188 cm) tall. Without &quot;Flatlander&quot; bodypaint, his brown eyes show no discernible slant and his yellow-brown skinned features are a blended fusion of Earth&#x27;s many races. Born a &quot;Flatlander&quot;, Louis is best known among his friends for inventing the &quot;Sabbatical&quot;—going off alone in a spaceship outside the boundaries of known space until one can tolerate human company again. Louis was the first human being to make contact with the Trinoc species.

He is also the only hominid ever to become a Protector and return to normal (Breeder) state afterward.

==Birth and childhood==
Louis Wu is the second of two children born to Carlos Wu and Sharrol Janss. Sharrol was married to Beowulf (or &quot;Bey&quot;) Shaeffer at the time but the Fertility Board of the United Nations of Earth had absolute control over reproductive rights on that planet (its population was about 18 billion at the time). The Board denied a parenthood license to Shaeffer based on his albinism, considering it an undesirable genetic trait. Sharrol was unable to leave Earth because of her Flatland Phobia, a fear of being off-planet. They asked Carlos Wu, a friend of Sharrol&#x27;s who has an unlimited parenthood license, to help them. Sharrol and Wu were married on a two-year contract arrangement; Tanya Wu was born in 2649 and Louis a year later, 2650. Shaeffer returned to Earth in 2650 and both children were raised by Sharrol and Beowulf. Carlos remained a family friend to both Beowulf and Sharrol. Several years later, amidst unusual and perilous circumstances, Louis, his sister, mother, and adoptive father (Beowulf) along with Carlos and Carlos&#x27; girlfriend, Feather Filip, secretly and illegally emigrated from Earth to Fafnir.

Upon reaching Fafnir, Feather shot Shaeffer in the chest with an ARM punchgun, but Carlos managed to escape with Tanya and Louis. Sharrol killed Feather by cutting her throat, then decapitating her. Sharrol then placed Bey&#x27;s head (after removing it from his body) in Carlos&#x27;s nanotechnology-based autodoc where it reconstructed his body, sizing it to the Intensive Care Cavity of the autodoc, which was tailored to Carlos&#x27;s body proportions. Eventually, Beowulf recovered, was reunited with Sharrol, and had two more children with her, Jeena and an unnamed second child; therefore, Louis has one sister and two half-siblings, who grew up on the Home colony world. Eventually, in his adulthood, Louis moved to Earth, and in the years between his two trips to the Ringworld he relocated to Canyon. At the end of &quot;Ringworld&#x27;s Children&quot; he is in a spaceship, heading back to Home.

While Louis Wu was raised by Beowulf Shaeffer, in the first &quot;Ringworld&quot; novel Louis seems not to know who Shaeffer is, nor does he make any reference to his relation to Carlos upon encountering the same autodoc in the later &quot;Ringworld&quot; novels. As the Known Space universe continued to grow in complexity with each newly published story, Louis&#x27; own backstory was increasingly retconned to fit in with this continuity. This is also probably why Louis never reflected on the obviously traumatic events in his childhood that took place on Fafnir. This might also be explained as Louis simply being tight-lipped about certain aspects of his personal history, a trait he shared with both his biological father Carlos and his adoptive father Beowulf.

==Pre-Ringworld==

According to narration in &quot;Ringworld&quot;, Wu ran for political office in the United Nations in his middle 70s. He lost the election but in the process of running learned an oratorical technique he would later use to attempt to convince Teela Brown not to come on what would later turn out to be the first Ringworld expedition.

In an adventure some 70 years before the events of &quot;Ringworld&quot; (around when Wu was 130, related in &quot;Betrayer of Worlds&quot;), that he does not recall in his later life (e.g., in &quot;Ringworld&quot;), Louis is found by a Pierson&#x27;s Puppeteer named Nessus while working in a hospital in a rebel camp on Wunderland and severely addicted to pain killers. Nessus is attempting to find members of Louis&#x27; family, but Louis reports them dead. Desperate and hoping Louis has similar talents, Nessus recruits Louis with the understanding that his memory would be altered before his return to Known Space, he would be saved from the Civil War on Wunderland, well compensated and cured of his addiction.

Louis&#x27; task is initially to prevent a war between the Puppeteers and Gw&#x27;oth. He eventually ends up preventing a genocide, observing the removal of the legitimate Puppeteer government, its ironic replacement with a puppet regime controlled by the Gw&#x27;oth, and finding himself with a very large Puppeteer bounty on his own head. Taking it for granted that he would eventually be discovered in Puppeteer regions of space, he agrees to let Nessus alter his memory and return him to Known Space.

He awakens on a very expensive FTL singleship near Known Space, physically younger than he recalled, unaddicted (the ship refuses to provide him with alcohol or pills), and without recollection of how he came to be in this situation while several months away from Sol and Wunderland. He attributes the memory loss to pill usage and resolves to sell his ship as soon as he arrives back in the Sol system.

In terms of in-universe chronology (falling in-between &quot;Betrayer of Worlds&quot; and &quot;Ringworld&quot;), Wu later appears in the short story &quot;There Is a Tide&quot;, where he becomes the first human to make contact with the Trinoc species. In terms of publication chronology, &quot;There Is a Tide&quot; is the story where Wu first appears.

==Appearance in &quot;Ringworld&quot;==
At the beginning of &quot;Ringworld&quot;, Louis celebrated his 200th birthday by working his way from party to party around the world using transfer booths to stay ahead of the dateline.

After one of his booth transfers gets diverted to a hotel room, he accepts an offer to go on an expedition with three other members – two aliens (a Pierson&#x27;s Puppeteer named Nessus, and a catlike Kzin called Speaker-to-Animals) and Teela Brown, a human female supposedly bred for luck. Unfortunately, the group crash-lands on the Ringworld, a huge structure with 3,000,000 times the surface area of Earth.

When Louis comes up with an ingenious way to get them home, he is rewarded by the Puppeteers with the &quot;Quantum II Hyperdrive&quot;, capable of moving a spaceship one light-year in 1.25 minutes.

Louis then returns to the Ringworld looking for matter conversion technology for another Pierson&#x27;s Puppeteer, a deposed leader (the &quot;Hindmost&quot;). While there, he discovers that the Ringworld is unstable. He decides to save the Ringworld with Speaker-To-Animals (renamed Chmeee) and the Hindmost (after Louis destroys the hyperdrive motor, trapping them there again).

Louis appears again for the last two &quot;Ringworld&quot; books, where he tries to get the Pak Protectors in line in &quot;The Ringworld Throne&quot; and finally escapes in &quot;Ringworld&#x27;s Children&quot;. Events immediately following his escape are chronicled in &quot;Fate of Worlds&quot; (subtitled &quot;Return from the Ringworld&quot;).

<doc id="908825" wikidata="Q331351" url="?curid=908825" title="David Ogilvy, 13th Earl of Airlie">
<text>David George Coke Patrick Ogilvy, 13th Earl of Airlie, (17 May 1926 – 26 June 2023) was a Scottish landowner, soldier, banker and peer. 

Airlie served as Lord Chamberlain of the Household from 1984 until 1997, as well as in a number of honorary positions such as Chancellor of the Order of the Thistle and Lord Lieutenant of Angus. He was the brother-in-law of Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy.

==Early life and ancestry==
Airlie was born David George Coke Patrick Ogilvy in Westminster on 17 May 1926. He was the eldest son of the 12th Earl of Airlie and his wife Lady Alexandra Marie Bridget Coke (1891–1984), herself the daughter of 3rd Earl of Leicester. King George V was his godfather. His younger brother was The Hon. Sir Angus Ogilvy, husband of Princess Alexandra of Kent. He served as a page to his father at the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in Westminster Abbey on 12 May 1937. After the death of Queen Elizabeth II, his childhood friend, on 8 September 2022, he was the last surviving participant in that coronation.

Airlie, then styled Lord Ogilvy by courtesy, was educated at Eton College. 
He served with the Scots Guards in Germany, Malaya and Austria. In 1946, he was appointed aide-de-camp to the commander-in-chief and High Commissioner to Austria. He left the army in 1950 to attend the Royal Agricultural College to learn more about estate management. He maintained two homes on the family&#x27;s estate in Angus: Cortachy Castle and Airlie Castle. He also had a home at Sloane Court West in Chelsea, London, where at the time of his death he lived full-time.

==Career==
===Merchant banking===
In 1953, then Lord Ogilvy took up merchant banking, joining J. Henry Schroder &amp; Co. He was appointed a director of the company in 1961, chairman of Henry Schroder Wagg &amp; Co. in 1973, and then of Schroders plc in 1977.

He became to the 13th Earl of Airlie and chief of Clan Ogilvy upon the death of his father in 1968. In 1972, Lord Airlie was named to the International Best Dressed Hall of Fame List.

===Royal Household===
In 1984, Lord Airlie resigned from Schroder to take up the position of Lord Chamberlain of the Household, the most senior office in the Royal Household. He was sworn into the Privy Council and appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order. In his capacity as Lord Chamberlain, he was chancellor of the Royal Victorian Order. He was following in the footsteps of his late father, who had served as Lord Chamberlain of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother&#x27;s household.

Under Lord Airlie, the Lord Chamberlain’s ceremonial and non-executive role was altered to that of chief executive. Airlie initiated changes in the early 1990s under the auspices of &quot;The Way Ahead Group&quot;. Under these plans the Queen agreed to pay tax, greater transparency for the public subsidy of the monarchy began and a greater emphasis on public relations started. In 1986, he produced a 1,393-page report recommending 188 changes for smoother operations of the Royal Household.

On 29 November 1985, Airlie was made a Knight of the Order of the Thistle, Scotland&#x27;s highest order of chivalry. He became Chairman of General Accident Fire and Life Assurance plc in 1987. In 1989, he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Angus, having been a deputy lieutenant since 1964.

Airlie&#x27;s tenure as Lord Chamberlain saw times of turbulence for the monarchy, including Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s &quot;annus horribilis&quot;, with the 1992 Windsor Castle fire and the separations and subsequent divorces of the Prince and Princess of Wales and the Duke and Duchess of York, and the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in August 1997. He remained in the post until 1997; upon his retirement, he was awarded the Royal Victorian Chain and appointed a permanent lord-in-waiting.

==Later life==

Lord Airlie&#x27;s ancestral home in Tayside was Cortachy Castle near the ancient burgh of Kirriemuir, Angus. The castle has served as the family home for more than 500 years. However, in 2014, Lord and Lady Airlie moved out of Cortachy Castle, and their eldest son, who now manages the property, is considering the future of the residence. On 13 November 2007, Airlie was appointed Chancellor of the Order of the Thistle following the death of the 9th Duke of Buccleuch. He remained in this position until his death.

When the University of Abertay Dundee was founded in 1994, Airlie was appointed their first chancellor. He was additionally, the Captain-General of the Royal Company of Archers, The Queen&#x27;s Bodyguard for Scotland, a ceremonial unit that serves as the sovereign&#x27;s bodyguard in Scotland, and thus Gold Stick for Scotland.

In September 2022, Lord Airlie attended the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II. In May 2023, he was present at the coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla. Hugo Vickers has pointed out that Lord Airlie was the last surviving man to attend three coronations – 1937, 1953, and 2023.

Lord Airlie died at home in London, on 26 June 2023, at the age of 97. His funeral was held on 6 July 2023 at Cortachy Castle. Per his request, representatives from Scouts Scotland, of which he was president were present during his funeral and lined the street as his coffin was transported to the local Cortachy cemetery for internment. A memorial service was held on 15 November 2023 in the Chapel of the Royal Hospital Chelsea and was attended by King Charles III and Queen Camilla.

==Personal life==
On 23 October 1952, he married Virginia Fortune Ryan at St Margaret&#x27;s Church, Westminster, in the presence of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother and Princess Margaret.

They had six children:
* Lady Doune Mabell Ogilvy (born 13 August 1953); married Hereward Charles Wake, on 16 April 1977, had issue, divorced in July 1995.
* Lady Jane Fortune Margaret Ogilvy (born 24 June 1955); married François Nairac on 30 August 1980, had issue.
* David John Ogilvy, 14th Earl of Airlie (born 9 March 1958); married, firstly, The Hon. Geraldine Harmsworth (daughter of the 3rd Viscount Rothermere) in 1981, had issue, divorced in 1990. Married, secondly, Tarka Kings in 1991, had issue.
** Lady Augusta Amadeus Caroline Ogilvy (born 1981)
** David Huxley Ogilvy, Lord Ogilvy (born 1991)
** The Hon. Joseph Skene Ogilvy (born 1995)
** The Hon. Michael Móir Ogilvy (born 1997)
* The Hon. Bruce Patrick Mark Ogilvy (born 7 April 1959)
* Lady Elizabeth Clementina Ogilvy (born 4 June 1965); married Jonathan Baring, had issue.
* The Hon. Patrick Alexander Ogilvy (born 24 March 1971)

His wife, the Countess of Airlie, was a Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Elizabeth II, following in the footsteps of his grandmother, Mabell, Countess of Airlie, who was a Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Mary. She was the first American to be appointed a lady-in-waiting.

==In popular culture==
Lord Airlie was portrayed by actor Douglas Reith in the 2006 film &quot;The Queen&quot; in his capacity as Lord Chamberlain, planning the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales. He was portrayed by actor Martin Turner in the fifth season of &quot;The Crown&quot; in which he was depicted managing the divorce of the Prince (Dominic West) and Princess of Wales (Elizabeth Debicki). He was again portrayed by Turner in the sixth season of the series, planning the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales and for Operation London Bridge.

<text>The Broadway Limited was a passenger train operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) between New York City and Chicago. It operated from 1912 to 1995. It was the Pennsylvania&#x27;s premier train, competing directly with the New York Central Railroad&#x27;s &quot;20th Century Limited&quot;. The &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; continued operating after the formation of Penn Central (PC) in February 1968, one of the few long-distance trains to do so. PC conveyed the train to Amtrak in 1971, who operated it until 1995. The train&#x27;s name referred not to Broadway in Manhattan, but rather to the &quot;broad way&quot; of PRR&#x27;s four-track right-of-way along the majority of its route.

== History ==
=== Pennsylvania Railroad ===
The &quot;Pennsylvania Special&quot; was one of nine express trains the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) operated between New York City and Chicago. On November 14, 1912, PRR renamed it the &quot;Broadway Limited&quot;, to avoid confusion with the similarly-named &quot;Pennsylvania Limited&quot;. The name, though spelled as &quot;Broadway&quot;, honored PRR&#x27;s four-track &quot;broad way&quot; main line. In the heavyweight era the &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; was an extra-fare, all sleeper (no coach service) train with an open-platform observation car at the end, such as &quot;Continental Hall&quot; and &quot;Washington Hall&quot;. The scheduled running time was 20 hours until it was reduced to 18 hours in 1932. Further reductions took place between 1932 and 1935, with the final heavyweight running time at 16 hours, 30 minutes.

On June 15, 1938, the &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; received lightweight streamlined cars to replace its heavyweight steel cars; on the same day rival New York Central Railroad&#x27;s (NYC) &quot;20th Century Limited&quot; was streamlined. Raymond Loewy styled the new cars and the PRR GG1 electric locomotive as well as some streamlined steam locomotives for PRR, notably the S1 and T1 Duplex drive engines. The &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; was one of four pre-World War II PRR trains to receive such equipment; the others being the &quot;General&quot; (New York–Chicago), &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; (New York–St. Louis), and &quot;Liberty Limited&quot; (Washington–Chicago). Other PRR trains continued to use heavyweight cars until after the end of World War II. Most of the 1938 cars were built new by Pullman-Standard between March and May of that year, but the diners, RPO and baggage cars were rebuilt from heavyweight cars by the railroad&#x27;s Altoona shops. The &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; was the only PRR train to be completely re-equipped with lightweight sleeping cars before World War II. The train&#x27;s running time was further reduced to 16 hours.

In 1949, PRR re-equipped the &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; again with new streamlined equipment. The all-sleeper train carried compartments, bedrooms, duplex rooms, roomettes for a single occupant and drawing rooms for three persons. The buffet-lounge-observation cars built by Pullman Standard were named &quot;Mountain View&quot; and &quot;Tower View&quot;. They had squared-off observation ends, instead of the tapered or rounded ends in the 1938 version, and contained two master rooms with radio and showers.
Also introduced was a twin-unit dining car and a mid-train lounge car, such as &quot;Harbor Rest&quot;, described by a PRR brochure as &quot;cheerful, spacious ... richly appointed for leisure with deep, soft carpets ... latest periodicals are in the libraries.&quot; The February 1956 &quot;Official Guide&quot; listed the westbound &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; (Train 29) consist as having fourteen cars normally assigned: nine sleeping cars between New York and Chicago, one additional sleeping car from New York continuing through to Los Angeles on the Santa Fe&#x27;s &quot;Super Chief&quot;, the twin-unit dining car, lounge car, and observation car. The train departed New York at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time and arrived at Chicago the following morning at 9:00 a.m. Central Time.

The &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; was not immune to the decline in passenger rail transport, though it resisted longer than most. The competitor &quot;20th Century Limited&quot; began carrying coaches in 1957. The PRR in October 1957 eliminated the train&#x27;s transcontinental sleeping cars connecting with the original &quot;California Zephyr&quot; and the Santa Fe&#x27;s &quot;Super Chief.&quot; Factors in the termination were declining ridership, and in the case of the &quot;Super Chief&quot; the time-consuming transfer of a sleeping car between Union Station, which the PRR used, and Dearborn Station, which the Santa Fe used. In late 1967, when the Illinois Central Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Panama Limited&quot; also began carrying coaches, the &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; became the last &quot;all-Pullman&quot; train in the United States, a distinction that did not last long. PRR merged the &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; with the &quot;General&quot; on December 13, 1967. The train was one of the few long-distance trains to survive the merger of PRR and NYC into the Penn Central (PC). Also, the train began stopping at some smaller cities it had bypassed until then.

=== Amtrak ===

Amtrak&#x27;s incorporators selected the &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; as the new company&#x27;s sole New York–Chicago route. Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; had a Washington, D.C. section east of Harrisburg that used the Port Road Branch. Amtrak refurbished the train in 1972, but the improvements did not persist. Author George H. Drury was critical in a 1974 &quot;Trains&quot; article: &quot;In May 1972... [t]he train was as fresh and new as a spring bride. In December 1973 the &quot;Broadway&quot; looked as though Amtrak had found a mistress elsewhere.&quot; In the 1970s, the &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; experienced chronic lateness due to poor track conditions in the Midwest. The route changed in 1979 when PC successor Conrail abandoned trackage west of Youngstown, Ohio. These changes included:
* A minor re-route over the ex-New York Central in Gary, Indiana in 1979.
* A major re-route over the ex-Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) in Indiana and Ohio, due to Conrail&#x27;s desire to abandon part of the former Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway. This change took effect on November 10, 1990. This resulted in Fort Wayne, Indiana losing service; a new station was built to the north in Waterloo, and was used by Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Capitol Limited.&quot; The new &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; route also resulted in the restoration of service to Akron, Ohio and Youngstown, Ohio.

Amtrak ultimately discontinued the &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; on September 10, 1995, in the face of significant funding problems. The &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; then earned $6.6 million against costs of $24 million. Amtrak replaced it with the all-coach &quot;Three Rivers&quot;, which would in turn be discontinued in 2005.

== Equipment ==
Pullman-Standard built the entirety of the equipment pool for the 1938 lightweight re-equipping, with the exception of two dining cars which were rebuilt in PRR&#x27;s Altoona shops. The equipment delivered included eight 18-roomette sleeping cars; two sleeper-bar-lounges; four 4-compartment, 2-drawing room, 4-double bedroom sleeping cars; two 13-double bedroom sleeping cars; and two View series sleeper-buffet-lounge-observation cars. The dining car seated 24 at tables (in both 1x1 and 2x2 configurations) and featured a small bar at one end with seating for two. The sleeper-bar-lounge included a secretary&#x27;s room, barber shop, shower-bath, and a bar/lounge with both booth and chair seating.

The &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; received additional Pullman equipment in 1949. This included &quot;Harbor Cove&quot; and &quot;Harbor Rest&quot;, sleeper-bar-lounges with three double bedrooms, and &quot;Mountain View&quot; and &quot;Tower View&quot;, sleeper-buffet-lounge-observation cars with two master rooms and a double bedroom. The &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; received coaches for the first time in 1967, when it merged with the &quot;General&quot;. Under PC the train carried &quot;two or more coaches, two lounges, twin-unit diner, and four sleepers.&quot; This was better than most remaining passenger trains, which often had only two-three cars.
Amtrak singled out the &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; for special treatment and in 1972 completely refurbished its equipment, most of which was ex-PC, although former Union Pacific Railroad sleeping cars were also used. Amtrak also added a Slumbercoach to the consist. In 1974 Amtrak tried out rebuilt 6-bedroom, 8-roomette ex-Rock Island sleeping cars, but their limited capacity reduced revenue. The &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; began receiving rebuilt Heritage Fleet cars in 1980, and Amfleet coaches thereafter. 68 cars were rebuilt at a total cost of $9.8 million.

<text>The Portuguese football leagues are divided into divisions (&quot;divisões&quot;, singular – &quot;divisão&quot;). The top teams play in the Primeira Liga, named Liga NOS for sponsorship reasons. In each division, with rare exceptions, a team plays all other teams twice, once at home and once away. One can divide the competitions in professional and non-professional.

The Portuguese league and federation teams compete in Europe under UEFA, most notably in the UEFA Champions League, but also in the UEFA Cup, in the extinct Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and sometimes in the UEFA Intertoto Cup, European Super Cup and the extinct UEFA/Conmebol Intercontinental Cup (Toyota Cup). They can also compete in the FIFA Club World Cup, although until today no Portuguese team reached this recent competition. The teams also compete in a domestic cup competition each year, called Cup of Portugal (&quot;Taça de Portugal&quot;) and the winners play against the champions in the SuperCup Cândido de Oliveira.

==Current hierarchical divisional breakdowns==
*Professional
**Primeira Liga - First Division (18 teams)
**Segunda Liga - Second Division (18 teams)

<text>Flames of Paris or &quot;The Flames of Paris&quot; () is a full-length ballet in four acts, choreographed by Vasily Vainonen with the stage director Sergei Radlov to music by Boris Asafyev based on songs of the French Revolution. The libretto by Nicolai Volkov and Vladimir Dmitriev was adapted from a book by Felix Gras. It was premiered at the Kirov Theatre in Leningrad on 7 November 1932, with Natalia Dudinskaya as Mireille de Poitiers, Vakhtang Chabukiani as Jérôme, Olga Jordan as Jeanne, Nina Anisimova as Thérèse, and Konstantin Sergeyev as Mistral. 

The Bolshoi Ballet premiered the full work on 6 July 1933 at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, with Aleksey Yermolayev (Jérôme), Anastasia Abramova (Jeanne), Nadezhda Kapustina (Thérèse) and Marina Semenova (Mireille de Poitiers). The conductor was Yuri Fayer.
A new production (using some of the original choreography) was staged in 2008 by Alexei Ratmansky for the Bolshoi Ballet and is available on DVD with Ivan Vasiliev and Natalia Osipova.

In 2013 a three-act reconstruction of the Vainonen ballet was staged by Mikhail Messerer for St Petersburg&#x27;s Mikhailovsky Theatre. It is based on a 1947 version done by Vainonen for the Bolshoi. 
==Background==
&quot;The Flames of Paris&quot; is a so-called &quot;revolutionary&quot; ballet which takes as its subject the French Revolution, including in its scenario the storming of the Tuileries Palace by the revolutionary soldiers and their victorious march on Paris. The plot is taken from the Felix Gras&#x27;s Provençal language 1896 novel &quot;Li Rouge dou Miejour&quot;, which is translated into French as &quot;Les Rouges du Midi (Reds of the South)&quot;.

Although the ballet&#x27;s setting is eighteenth-century France, it is a perfect illustration of Soviet ballet in the 1920s and 1930s, during which time there was a determined effort to find subjects in world history which reflected the more immediate situation in the Soviet Union, and to show that the October Revolution was part of more universal movements and historical events.

==Plot outline==
This outline is different from the plot of the ballet version revived by Alexei Ratmansky for the Bolshoi Ballet.

The ballet opens in a forest near Marseilles, where the peasant Gaspard and his children, Jeanne and Pierre, are gathering firewood. When a Count and his hunting party arrive, the peasants disperse, but Jeanne attracts the attention of the Count, who attempts to embrace her. When her father intervenes, he is beaten up by the Count&#x27;s servant and taken away. Next, in the city square in Marseilles Jeanne tells the people what has happened to her father and the people&#x27;s indignation over the injustices of the aristocracy grows. They storm the prison and free the prisoners of the Marquis de Beauregard.

At the court of Versailles a performance of the court theatre is followed by a lush banquet. The officials of the court present a formal petition to the king, requesting permission to deal with the unruly revolutionaries. Antoine Mistral, an actor in the theatre, on discovering this secret document is killed by the Marquis de Beauregard, but before he dies he manages to pass the petition on to Mireille de Poitiers, who escapes the palace as the sound of the Marseillaise is heard through the windows.

The scene shifts to a square in Paris, where an uprising and the storming of the palace is prepared. Mireille rushes in with the document revealing the conspiracy against the revolution, and her bravery is applauded. At the height of this scene, the officers of the Marquis arrive in the square; Jeanne, recognizing the man who insulted her in the woods, runs up and slaps his face. Following this, the crowd attacks the aristocrats. To the sound of revolutionary songs, the people storm the palace and burst into the staircase of the front hall. Jeanne attacks the Marquis, who is then killed by her brother, and the Basque girl Thérèse is shot to death.

Finally, back in the Paris square, the people celebrate their victory over the defenders of the Old Regime.

==Analysis==
In creating the choreography for this ballet, Vasily Vainonen drew upon many different sources, as did the composer Boris Asafyev. &quot;The Flames of Paris&quot; blends classical and character dancing, court and folk dances, pantomime, solo performances and group scenes.

For the part of Thérèse, for example, Vainonen chose a character dancer Nina Anisimova, who displayed strong, expressive folk movements which symbolized the energy and the spirit of the crowd. On the other hand, the dances for Philippe (originally Jérôme), one of the Marseillais, and his bride are almost purely classical: the two characters dance a &quot;pas de deux&quot; which although is reminiscent of Petipa choreographic manner, is distinctly more modern and is heroic for the male. 

As a further technique for putting classical dancing on the stage, Vainonen invented the roles of the pair of actors, Mireille de Poitiers and Antoine Mistral, who have been invited by the king to perform at the banquet. These were originally danced by Natalia Dudinskaya and Konstantin Sergeyev and are designed for outstanding ballet dancers who can display their virtuosity in a classical &quot;pas de deux.&quot; These characters are, of course, on the side of the revolutionary mob, so that after the storming of the palace, and the death of Antoine Mistral, Mireille de Poitiers is joined by the group in dances which include variations, codas, and the participation of an enormous &quot;corps de ballet&quot; consisting of 24, and later 32, dancers. In the scene at the palace of Louis XVI there is a great deal of mime sequences whilst Mireille de Poitiers dances a minuet, which is a beautiful piece of choreography in itself.

In 2002, Humphrey became a senior national team member. She competed in four national meets and five international meets, including the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. At World Championships, she advanced to the semifinal round on floor exercise and vault, but did not make the eight-person finals on either apparatus, placing ninth on vault and eleventh on floor.

In 2003, Humphrey competed at the Pacific Challenge, winning team silver and individual vault silver. She placed sixth in the all-around at US National Championships. She competed at the World Championships and was a member of the first U.S. women&#x27;s team to win a World Championships gold medal.

On March 18, 2008, Humphrey, who battled back problems during the 2008 season, announced her retirement from gymnastics.

==Post-college==
In May 2010, Humphrey became a police officer in Raymore, Missouri.

Humphrey became an athlete representative on USA Gymnastics&#x27; Athletes&#x27; Council in 2009.

She was the 1993 and 1994 world all-around champion, the 1992 Summer Olympics all-around silver medallist, the 1996 Olympic balance beam champion, the 1995 Pan American Games all-around champion, and a member of the gold medal-winning Magnificent Seven team at the 1996 Olympics.

Miller is the second most decorated U.S. gymnast in Olympics history, with a total of seven medals, surpassed only by Simone Biles in 2024. With a combined total of 16 World Championships and Olympic medals between 1991 and 1996, she is the second-most decorated American gymnast, male or female, surpassed only by Simone Biles. She was also the most successful American athlete at the 1992 Olympics, winning five medals.

==Early life==
Miller was born in Rolla, Missouri, but she and her family moved to Edmond, Oklahoma, when she was six months old. She began gymnastics when she was five and travelled to Moscow with her mother at the age of nine to participate in a gymnastics camp.

As a teenager, Miller attended Edmond North High School, working with a flexible program that accommodated her training, travel and competition schedule.

Miller&#x27;s mother was a bank vice president, and her father was a professor at the University of Central Oklahoma.

==Gymnastics career==

===1989–1991===
For most of her career, Miller was coached by Steve Nunno and Peggy Liddick, who went on to become the national coach of the Australian women&#x27;s gymnastics team.

As a 12-year-old, she finished third at the 1989 Olympic Festival, a competition designed to showcase up-and-coming talent.

She travelled to Europe in 1990 and 1991 for international meets and scored perfect 10s on the balance beam at the Swiss Cup and the Arthur Gander Memorial. At the 1991 Gander Memorial, she won the all-around with the highest total score ever recorded by an American woman under the traditional 10.0 scale: a 39.875.

At her first World Championships in 1991 in Indianapolis, Miller won two silver medals: one on the uneven bars (where she tied with Soviet gymnast Tatiana Gutsu) and one in the team competition. She placed second to Soviet Svetlana Boginskaya during the compulsory portion of the competition.

===1992===
Due to injury, Miller missed the 1992 World Championships in Paris. Not quite back up to speed with her more difficult skills, she pulled out of the optionals competition at the National Championships and petitioned to the Olympic Trials. Although the result was controversial, Miller won the Trials over her rival, Kim Zmeskal, who was the 1991 world champion.

Miller won the compulsory portion of the 1992 Olympic Games and scored the highest of any gymnast in the overall team competition, securing the bronze medal for the US women&#x27;s team and advancing to the all-around final as the top-ranked gymnast in the world. In the all-around final, she missed out on the gold by the closest margin in Olympic history, finishing 0.012 points behind Gutsu. Her coach, Steve Nunno, claimed she was robbed of the gold medal by unfair judging.

In event finals, she captured three more individual medals: a silver on balance beam and bronzes on uneven bars and floor exercise. Her haul of five Olympic medals was more than that of any other American athlete in Barcelona. She was one of only two female gymnasts, along with Lavinia Miloşovici of Romania, to compete in every event final at the Games, and she alone performed all sixteen of her routines without serious error. Thirteen of her routines scored a 9.9 or higher, with her lowest score being a 9.837 in the vault final.

With her two silver and three bronze medals at the 1992 Summer Olympics, Miller holds the record for most medals won at a single Olympic Games without winning gold.

===1993===
At the 1993 World Championships in Birmingham, Miller won every event in preliminaries, and television commentator Kathy Johnson, a 1984 Olympian, remarked that she had not seen a gymnast so dominant since Nadia Comăneci in 1976. Bart Conner agreed, stating that Miller could only be beaten if she faltered. Following the break-up of the Soviet Union, its sports system had undergone upheaval, and most former Soviet gymnasts were not ready to mount a sustained challenge in 1993. Miller, on the other hand, had reworked her routines to comply better with the new Code of Points. She won the all-around title, followed by gold medals on bars and floor. However, she fell three times in the beam final and withdrew from the vault final due to illness.

===1994===
At the 1994 World Championships in Brisbane, Miller again took the all-around title, beating Miloşovici and becoming the first American gymnast to win back-to-back world all-around titles. She also won the beam title, which had eluded her the previous year, with a near-perfect exercise.

Her winning streak ended in late 1994 at the Goodwill Games, where Dina Kochetkova of Russia, who had finished in third place at the World Championships, defeated her by a narrow margin, 39.325 to 39.268. Miller rebounded by earning gold medals on beam and floor and silver medals on vault and bars. She missed out on medals in the team competition and the mixed team competition, both of which saw fourth-place finishes for the United States.

Two weeks later, Miller competed at the 1994 National Championships, where she won five silver medals, placing second to Dominique Dawes each time.

===1995===
Although she won the 1995 American Classic, Miller lost the 1995 National Championships to 13-year-old Dominique Moceanu. At the 1995 World Championships in Sabae, Japan, she amassed the highest total score of the American team but walked away without an individual medal. She placed seventh on the uneven bars and fourth on the balance beam, and had to withdraw from the vault and floor finals due to injury.

===1996===
Although struggling with severe tendinitis in her left wrist and a pulled hamstring, Miller won the 1996 National Championships. Once again, though, she was forced to sit out the World Championships in the Olympic year due to injury, and later the Olympic Trials. She was able to petition onto the American team as the top performer at Nationals, and the injury was sufficiently recovered by July to allow her to compete in her second Olympics.

Miller led the American team, dubbed the Magnificent Seven, to the gold medal, edging the Russian team. Kerri Strug garnered the majority of the media attention after landing her second vault on an injured foot, which forced her to withdraw from the all-around and event finals. But Miller, who was the team&#x27;s highest scorer, placed second after the team competition behind Lilia Podkopayeva, qualifying her for her second Olympic all-around final.

In the all-around, Miller was ranked second halfway through the competition. In the end, she placed eighth, but she was the highest-ranking American in the competition. She also became the first American to win the balance beam final at the Olympics, as well as the first American woman to win an individual gold medal in a fully attended Olympics. She concluded her career with seven Olympic medals.

===1997–2000===
Following the Olympics, Miller and her teammates participated in a 100-city tour and several exhibitions. She competed in her final international meet in 1997, when she won the all-around title at the World University Games.

In 2000, Miller made a brief comeback attempt for the Sydney Olympics. She competed in the Olympic Trials, but after a fall on vault, she decided to withdraw from the competition despite being cleared by a doctor to continue.

===Honors===
Miller is a member of the USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame, the United States Olympic Hall of Fame the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame, and the Women&#x27;s International Sports Hall of Fame. She is the only woman, in any sport, to be inducted into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame twice, as an individual and for her team.

With seven Olympic and nine World Championship medals, Miller is one of the most decorated American gymnasts, male or female. She is tied with Nastia Liukin for third most World Championship medals (9) won by an American gymnast, behind Simone Biles (30) and Alicia Sacramone (10).

In 1998, the Oklahoma Legislature named a section of Interstate 35 in Edmond, Oklahoma the Shannon Miller Parkway in her honor.

==Post-gymnastics career==

In 2003, Miller graduated from the University of Houston with a B.B.A. in marketing and entrepreneurship. She entered Boston College Law School later that year and graduated in 2007. Afterward, however, she opted not to take the bar exam. She moved to Florida, where she made appearances at gyms, conducted beam clinics, and starred in workout DVDs.

On October 21, 2015, Miller entered a business partnership with Juice Plus for a branded line of dietary supplements. Also in 2015, her autobiography, &quot;It&#x27;s Not About Perfect: Competing for My Country and Fighting for My Life,&quot; was published in 2015 by St. Martin&#x27;s Press.

Miller is the president of Shannon Miller Lifestyle and the Shannon Miller Foundation, which is dedicated to fighting childhood obesity.

== Personal life ==
Miller married lawyer and ophthalmologist Christopher B. Phillips in June 1999. The couple separated in 2004, and their divorce was finalized in 2006. While Phillips accused Miller of infidelity with a married male athlete, Miller denied the claim, and it did not figure into the divorce grounds.

In August 2007, Miller announced her engagement to John Falconetti, the president of Drummond Press and former chairman of the Republican executive committee of Duval County, Florida. They married on August 25, 2008, and have two children: a son, John Rocco, born on October 28, 2009, and a daughter, Sterling Diane, born on June 25, 2013.

In February 2011, Miller revealed that she had been diagnosed with germ cell ovarian cancer, a month after doctors removed a baseball-sized cyst from one of her ovaries. She underwent three cycles of chemotherapy from March 7 to May 2, 2011. In September 2011, her doctor gave her a clean bill of health.

<text>L&#x27;esplanade Laurier is an office complex in downtown Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It consists of two 23-storey towers, a three storey underground parking garage and a podium containing a two-storey shopping mall. The entire structure is clad in white carrara marble, making it clearly stand out from the other towers in the city. It is located at the intersection of major Ottawa streets, Laurier Avenue between Bank Street and O&#x27;Connor Street. The lower two levels of the buildings stretch across the entire block and house a small shopping arcade.

== History ==

The building was built by Olympia and York in 1973-1975, and was intended to be occupied by federal government workers. It was one of the last office complexes of that era purpose-built by the private sector for the federal government, as the government itself project-managed complexes constructed in the late 1970s, including the C.D. Howe Building and Place du Portage. The building formerly housed over 2000 public servants.

In the early 1990s, a slab of carrara marble fell from the building podium. Subsequently most of the marble slabs from the lower levels of the building were removed and replaced with white painted plasterboard. In 2002, the building was closed for several days after an accident caused hundreds of litres of ethylene glycol to enter the water supply. After the system was flushed the towers returned to operation.

The building is currently managed by Rosdev Group, an organisation that has been criticised for poor maintenance and mismanagement. As of 2018 both towers are undergoing major renovations, as most former occupants from the Department of Finance and the Treasury Board Secretariat have moved to their new location in the Flaherty Building at 90 Elgin.

<doc id="908889" wikidata="Q2988921" url="?curid=908889" title="Bloody April">
<text>Bloody April was the (largely successful) British air support operation during the Battle of Arras in April 1917, during which particularly heavy casualties were suffered by the Royal Flying Corps at the hands of the German &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot;.

The tactical, technological, and training differences between the two sides ensured the British suffered a casualty rate nearly four times as great as their opponents. The losses were so disastrous that it threatened to undermine the morale of entire squadrons. The RFC contributed to the success, limited as it finally proved, of the British Army during the five-week series of battles.

==Background==
In April 1917 the British Army began an offensive at Arras, planned in conjunction with the French High Command, who were simultaneously embarking on a massive attack (the &quot;Nivelle Offensive&quot;) about to the south. The Royal Flying Corps (RFC) supported British operations by offering close air support, aerial reconnaissance and strategic bombing of German targets. The RFC&#x27;s commanding officer, Hugh Trenchard believed in the offensive use of air power and pushed for operations over German-controlled territory. It was expected the large numbers of aircraft assembled over the frontlines in the spring of 1917 would fulfil this purpose. However, the aircraft were, for the most part, inferior to German fighter aircraft.

Crucially, British pilot training was not only poorly organised and inconsistent, it had to be drastically abbreviated to keep squadrons suffering heavy casualties up to strength. This was self-perpetuating, as it resulted in most new pilots lacking sufficient practical flight experience before reaching the front.
German pilot training was, at that time, more thorough and less hurried than the British programmes. After the heavy losses and failures against the French over Verdun in 1916 and against the British at the Somme, they had reorganised their air forces into the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; by October 1916, which now included Jastas, specialist fighter units. These units were led by highly experienced pilots, some of them survivors of the Fokker Scourge period. and had been working up with the first mass-produced twin-gunned German fighters, the Albatros D.I and D.II, comprising a total of nearly 350 aircraft between the two types.

Paradoxically, the one sided nature of the casualty lists during Bloody April was partly a result of German numerical inferiority. The German air forces mostly confined themselves to operating over friendly territory, thus reducing the possibility of losing pilots to capture and increasing the amount of time they could stay in the air and choose when and how to engage in combat.

==Battle==
The Battle of Arras began on 9 April 1917. The Allies launched a joint ground offensive, with the British attacking near Arras in Artois, northern France, while the French offensive was launched on the Aisne.

In support of the British army, the RFC deployed 25 squadrons, totalling 365 aircraft, about one-third of which were fighters (or &quot;scouts&quot; as they were called at the time). There were initially only five German &quot;Jastas&quot; (fighter squadrons) in the region, but this rose to eight as the battle progressed (some 80 or so operational fighter aircraft in total).

Since late 1916, the Germans had held the upper hand in the contest for air supremacy on the Western Front, with the twin-lMG 08 machine gun-armed Albatros D.II and D.III outclassing the fighters charged with protecting the vulnerable B.E.2c, F.E.2b and Sopwith 1½ Strutter two-seater reconnaissance and bomber machines. The Allies&#x27; fighter squadrons were equipped with obsolete &quot;pushers&quot; such as the Airco DH.2 and F.E.8 – and other outclassed types such as the Nieuport 17 and Sopwith Pup. Only the SPAD S.VII and Sopwith Triplane could compete on more or less equal terms with the Albatros; but these were few in number and spread along the front. All four of the aforementioned Allied designs depended on just one synchronized Vickers machine gun apiece, given cooling louvers on the cooling jackets for aviation use, for their armament on their airframe. The new generation of Allied fighters were not yet ready for service, although No. 56 Squadron RFC with the S.E.5 was working up to operational status in France, intended to use both the synchronized Vickers gun, and an overwing-mount Lewis machine gun firing above the propeller arc for a twin-gun offensive punch. The Bristol F2A also made its debut with No. 48 Squadron during April, but lost heavily on its first patrol, with four out of six shot down in an encounter with five Albatros D.IIIs of &quot;Jasta 11&quot;, led by Manfred von Richthofen (popularly known as the Red Baron). The new R.E.8 two-seaters, which were eventually to prove less vulnerable than the B.E.2e, also suffered heavy casualties in their early sorties.
During April 1917, the British lost 245 aircraft, 211 aircrew killed or missing and 108 as prisoners of war. The German Air Services recorded the loss of 66 aircraft during the same period. As a comparison, in the five months of the Battle of the Somme of 1916 the RFC had suffered 576 casualties. Under Richthofen&#x27;s leadership, &quot;Jasta 11&quot; scored 89 victories during April, over a third of the British losses.

In casualties suffered, the month marked the nadir of the RFC&#x27;s fortunes. However, despite the losses inflicted, the German Air Service failed to stop the RFC carrying out its prime objectives. The RFC continued to support the army throughout the Arras offensive with up-to-date aerial photographs, reconnaissance information, effective contact patrolling during British advances and harassing bombing raids. In particular the artillery spotting aircraft rendered valuable reconnaissance to the British artillery, who were able to maintain their superiority throughout the battle. In spite of their ascendancy in air combat, the German fighter squadrons continued to be used defensively, flying for the most part behind their own lines. Thus the &quot;Jastas&quot; established &quot;air superiority&quot;, but certainly not the air supremacy sometimes claimed.

==Aftermath==
Within a couple of months the new technologically advanced generation of fighter (the SE.5, Sopwith Camel, and SPAD S.XIII) had entered service in numbers and quickly gained ascendancy over the over-worked &quot;Jastas&quot;. As the British fighter squadrons became once more able to adequately protect the slower reconnaissance and artillery observation machines, RFC losses fell and German losses rose.

The RFC learned from their mistakes, instituting new policies on the improvement of training and tactical organisation. By mid-1917 better aircraft designs were reaching the front. By the late summer of 1917 the British achieved a greater measure of air superiority than they had held for almost a year. The casualties in the air campaigns through the remainder of the war were never so one-sided again. In fact, this was essentially the last time that the Germans possessed real air superiority for the rest of the war – although the degree of allied dominance in the air certainly varied, the final all-out efforts of September 1918 causing even greater Allied losses.

Born in Vicksburg, Mississippi, he attended Alcorn State University and was selected in the 7th round of the 1985 NBA draft by the Seattle SuperSonics. Phelps played with the Sonics and Los Angeles Clippers. He later took his talents overseas and found success in the Philippine Basketball Association where he played for the San Miguel Beermen, helping them win two conference championships in 1988 and 1989. The latter became the first of three consecutive conference titles the team will win that year to accomplish the Grand Slam title run becoming only the second team in the league to do so. Phelps played one more conference with the team in 1990 but they failed to qualify for the semi-finals.

<doc id="908910" wikidata="Q5253380" url="?curid=908910" title="Sunday shopping">
<text>Sunday shopping or Sunday trading refers to the ability of retailers to operate stores on Sunday, a day that Christian tradition typically recognises as a day of rest, though the rationale for Sunday trade bans often includes secular reasoning. Rules governing shopping hours, such as Sunday shopping, vary around the world but many countries and subnational jurisdictions continue to ban or restrict Sunday shopping. In the United States, rules are enshrined within blue laws.

== Arguments in favour of Sunday shopping ==
Sunday shopping has its main argument in the consumer welfare. Extending opening hours gives customers more time to do their shopping. They allow individuals to avoid peak shopping hours and having to queue in their free time. 

Public authorities hurt consumers by keeping stores from choosing their opening hours according to their market presumptions of consumers&#x27; demand. According to the OECD, demand has strongly evolved towards greater flexibility, also due to a greater diversity of working hours in the economy in general, as well as to a higher female labour participation in the labour market.
Before the liberalisation of shop opening hours in a country like Austria, for example, one could observe an increase in cross-border shopping towards countries with more liberal shopping hours.

It has not been proven that Sunday shopping hurts retailers by leading all of them to open longer hours. Consumer preferences can point in the direction of an extension of shop opening hours in a given area without this need arising in another area. In Spain, for instance, where relatively few restrictions survive, retail stores are open an average of 46 hours per week. In Sweden, 15 years after liberalisation, supply as regards shop opening hours has not yet standardised itself. On the contrary, if 80% of the department stores and supermarkets are open on Sunday, only half of corner shops and 48% of furniture stores are open on this day.

Final extension of opening hours, for each individual firm, will depend on:
* the price consumers are ready to pay for a 24/7 offer of certain products, as prices can rise due to higher wages for Sunday workers;
* the wage that workers will or can demand in order to work additional hours.

An economic model of free competition in prices and opening hours with free entry has shown that restrictions on opening hours aggravate a market failure: entry is excessive and opening hours are underprovided. The model predicts the impact of a liberalization of opening hours: in the short run prices will remain constant, but increase in the long run. Concentration in the retail sector will rise and opening hours will increase in two steps, immediately after deregulation and further over time. Finally, employment in the retail sector increases.

Campaigns for deregulation of Sunday shopping have been put forward mainly by liberal parties. But as long ago as 1899, even US Christian churchgoers were calling for a reform of the laws in the US, because the result was not more people going to Church but &quot;enforced idleness&quot;: George Orwell uses the term in &quot;Down and out in Paris and London&quot; to remark that the worst problem of the underclass is being made to wait.

A deontological argument based on individualist principles holds that business owners should be free to set whatever hours they please and to hire whatever workers are available, able, and willing to work during those hours.

== Arguments against Sunday shopping ==

Arguments in favour of regulation of shop opening hours usually emanate from trade unions and industry federations, as well as socialist and Christian democratic parties. They include:
* protection of workers, vulnerable because of economic conditions and lack of job security, from the need to work also on a day which should be devoted to cultural or familial activities.
* protection of small and medium-sized enterprises, that would face higher competition from larger shops.

The Canadian Labour Code states that workers must get at least one full day (of rest), and that &quot;wherever practicable, Sunday shall be the normal day of rest&quot; [s.173]. In the United States, the eight-hour day and working time standards are enforced by the Fair Labor Standards Act. In the European Union, it is governed by the Working Time Directive.

United States jurist Stephen Johnson Field, with regard to Sunday blue laws, stated:
Erwin Fahlbusch and Geoffrey William Bromiley write that throughout their existence, organizations advocating first-day Sabbatarianism, such as the Lord&#x27;s Day Alliance in North America and the Lord&#x27;s Day Observance Society in the British Isles, were supported by labor unions in lobbying &quot;to prevent secular and commercial interests from hampering freedom of worship and from exploiting workers.&quot; For example, the United States Congress was supported by the Lord&#x27;s Day Alliance in securing &quot;a day of rest for city postal clerks whose hours of labor, unlike those of city mail carriers, were largely unregulated.&quot; In Canada, the &quot;Ligue du Dimanche&quot;, a Roman Catholic Sunday league, supported the &quot;Lord&#x27;s Day Act&quot; in 1923 and promoted first-day Sabbatarian legislation. &quot;Dies Domini&quot;, written by Pope John Paul II in 1998, advocates Sunday legislation in that it protects civil servants and workers; the North Dakota Catholic Conference in 2011 likewise maintained that blue laws, in accordance with the Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church, &quot;ensure that, for reasons of economic productivity, citizens are not denied time for rest and divine worship.&quot; Similarly, Chief Justice Earl Warren, while acknowledging the partial religious origin of blue laws, acknowledged their &quot;secular purpose they served by providing a benefit to workers at the same time that they enhanced labor productivity&quot;, declaring: that &quot;the State seeks to set one day apart from all others as a day of rest, repose, recreation and tranquility--a day which all members of the family and community have the opportunity to spend and enjoy together, a day on which there exists relative quiet and disassociation from the everyday intensity of commercial activities, a day on which people may visit friends and relative who are not available during working days.&quot;

In some religions, the day of the Sabbath is the seventh day of the week, said to be the day God rested after six days of creation. This is written in the Torah or Old Testament and New Testament (Genesis 2:2-3; Exodus 20:8; Exodus 23:12; Exodus 31:13-17; Deuteronomy 5:12: Hebrews 4:4-8) of the Bible. Specifically, number 3 or 4 in the list of the Ten Commandments is &quot;Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy&quot;. Not to follow one or many of the Ten Commandments can be considered a sin, or a wrong thing to do. In Judaism, the Sabbath is the seventh day of the Hebrew calendar week, which in English is known as Saturday.

==Sunday shopping by continent==

=== Europe ===

==== European Union ====
EU law allows each Member State to set its own policy concerning work on Sundays. Working time in EU member states is addressed in the Working Time Directive: only a weekly rest after six days of work is required. The European Court of Justice in its case law on the subject, built from the 1980s, has not confirmed that Sunday should forcibly be the day of interruption. For the European Commission, &quot;the choice of a closing day of shopping involves historical, cultural, touristic, social and religious considerations within the discretion of each Member State&quot;.

The following European Union countries currently allow all shops to open for at least part of every Sunday: Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and Sweden.

The following European Union countries currently allow shops to open every Sunday in towns and cities designated as tourist destinations and currently have a very extensive list of them that includes capitals and major cities: Belgium, France and Spain.

In Malta, restrictions were lifted in early 2017, and grocery shops are now allowed to open; other stores have to pay a weekly fee of €700 to be allowed to legally trade on Sundays.

===== Belgium =====

Shops in Belgium may open on a certain number of Sunday afternoons. In March 2006, the number of Sunday opening days increased from three to up to nine. Six of these are determined by the federal government and three may be determined by municipalities. In addition, the criteria which a municipality must meet to be recognised as a &quot;tourist centre&quot; were relaxed.

There are also arrangements for food stores to open on Sunday and wider arrangements for Sunday opening of certain sectors such as furniture stores, DIY stores and garden centres.

===== Czech Republic =====
According to the Czech labour code, where operations so allow, the employer shall set a rest period during the week for all employees to fall on a Sunday, but Sunday shopping itself is not restricted. Although the discussion about restriction is ongoing. Since 2016 there are restrictions for larger shops (400 m2 and more) during selected public holidays.

===== Croatia =====

The Roman Catholic Church and some other minor organisations tried to influence the Croatian Government in order for Sunday shopping to be banned. Although it had worked for some time, the Croatian Constitutional Court declared banning Sunday shopping to be unconstitutional, and on 28 April 2004 issued a decision making it legal. The Church admitted defeat in the battle over closing shops on Sundays. However, on 15 July 2008, the Croatian Parliament, again under pressure from the Catholic Church; passed a new-old law banning Sunday shopping effective 1 January 2009. However, this new ban was also declared to be unconstitutional by the Croatian Constitutional Court on 19 June 2009.

A new temporary ban, introduced between 27 April 2020 and 26 May 2020 related to measures to restrict the spread of COVID-19, was also declared unconstitutional on 14 September 2020. In 2023, a ban on Sunday shopping was enacted. Starting on 1 July 2023, shops are only able to stay open for 16 Sundays a year.

===== Denmark =====
In Denmark, the closing laws restricting retail trade on Sundays have been abolished with effect from 1 October 2012. From then on, retail trade is only restricted on public holidays (New Years Day, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, Easter Sunday, Easter Monday, Day of Prayer, Ascension Day, Whit Sunday, Whit Monday, Christmas Day and Boxing Day) and on Constitution Day, Christmas Eve and New Year&#x27;s Eve (on New Year&#x27;s Eve from 3 pm only). On these days, almost all shops will remain closed. Exempt are bakeries, DIYs, garden centres, filling stations and smaller supermarkets.

Hyper- and supermarkets are typically open on Sundays from 7 am or 8 am until 8 pm or even until 10 pm.

=====Finland=====

, opening hours, including Sunday shopping, for stores with a commercial floor area of less than 400 m2 are unregulated. The current law permits even the largest retailing venues to stay open on Sundays from 12 pm to 6 pm, and during the Christmas shopping season, beginning on the third Sunday of November and ending on 23 December, to 9 pm. Sunday shopping was introduced in 1994. On 15 December 2015, the Finnish parliament voted for removing all opening hour restrictions for grocery retailers. The new law came into force on 1 January 2016.

=====France=====

French laws about Sunday shopping are complex. Although Sunday shopping is generally not permitted, there are many exceptions such as certain zones and municipalities of the metropolitan areas of Paris, Marseille, and Lille; as well as around 500 cities that were declared as tourist towns, including major cities such as Nice, Le Havre, Vannes and Bordeaux. Most major stores nationwide open every Sunday in December prior to Christmas. Supermarkets (but not hypermarkets) are allowed to open nationwide every Sunday morning until 13:00 for grocery shopping. The relaxation in rules in 2009 allowed all stores to open in tourist areas (before, only sports, toys and cultural shops were allowed). The most visible result is that now clothing stores open every Sunday in places such as Champs Elysees in Paris, La Défense, central Marseille, central Cannes and central Nice.

In 2008, the Swedish furniture chain IKEA was fined €450,000 (over $700,000) for trading on Sundays under the law of 1906. Within the current law, IKEA stores in France are allowed to open on a Sunday. However, only the ones in the Paris metropolitan area actually do so.

===== Germany =====

In Germany, opening hours have long been restricted through the Ladenschlussgesetz. The 1956 law required shops to close for the weekend at 2 pm on a Saturday and 6:30 pm on week-nights, with opening until 6 pm on the first Saturday of the month, in what was known as the &quot;Langer Samstag&quot;, or &quot;long Saturday&quot;. The law was changed, in the face of strong resistance from labour unions, to allow &quot;langer Donnerstag&quot; (&quot;long Thursday&quot;) until 8:30 pm in 1988, and in 1996 opening times were extended to 8 pm from Monday to Friday and 4 pm on Saturday; this was extended to 8 pm on Saturday in 2004.

In 2004, the Federal Constitutional Court ruled against lifting restrictions on Sunday opening, which is still confined to some small bakeries and convenience stores inside railway stations and airports.

In 2006 and 2007, the responsibility for opening hours was transferred to the state governments instead of the federal government, leading to an end to regulated Monday–Saturday opening hours in several states.

Studies on the German deregulation find that, far from causing an increase in consumer prices, the liberalisation lowered prices to some extent, though revenue was unaffected. This decrease in prices was probably driven by productivity increases created by the smoothing of consumer traffic over a longer period of time and the greater ability of consumers to compare prices in a deregulated environment.

However, there is still strong resistance to Sunday shopping from clergy and politicians.

As of 2013, the number of Sunday shopping days per year became regulated by the local government bodies. Berlin, for example, allowed 10 Sundays each year in 2013, reduced to 8 Sundays in 2014, of which two must be during the month before Christmas. In addition, a few supermarkets, located at major subway/railway stations, are allowed to be open for Sunday shopping all year.

Several major railway stations are permitted to operate their shops, such as grocery stores, bookstores, and drug stores, on Sundays.

=====Hungary=====
Until 15 March 2015, shopping hours in Hungary were unregulated. Most convenience stores and general stores were open on a Sunday, even if only in the mornings. Larger stores (typically those above ), such as Tesco hypermarkets) were open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week ().

From 15 March 2015, new regulations banned shops from opening on Sundays. The new regulation only allowed trading by shops with an area no greater than , and even then only if they are operated by the owner or a close family member related by blood or marriage. The general exception from the law is the four Sundays in Advent and one day that the shops can choose themselves. Lidl chooses to open and close different stores on different Sundays, and lists which will be open in its flysheets.

Due to these rules being unpopular amongst the general public, a referendum was also planned against a Sunday shopping ban. From 17 April 2016, the shopping hours in Hungary are again unregulated. On public holidays (1 January, 15 March, Easter Sunday, Easter Monday, 1 May, Pentecost Sunday and Monday, 20 August, 23 October, 1 November, 25 and 26 December), all shops have to be closed. On Christmas Eve, shops must close by 14:00; while on 31 December, shops can be open until 18:00.

=====Ireland=====

There has been no recent legislation regarding Sunday trading in Ireland, which is regulated by the &quot;Shops (Hours of Trading) Act 1938&quot; (Northern Ireland, still being part of the United Kingdom, has different legislation). However, the act itself is largely inoperative – a 1938 Statutory Instrument made the entire State an &#x27;Exempted Area&#x27; under the legislation – and as a result most shops and businesses may open whenever they please, including on Sundays and public holidays.

Major retail chains (such as supermarkets, department stores, shops that specialise in DIY, household goods, clothing, etc.) and many independent retailers open their branches throughout Ireland on Sundays, usually from 10:00-19:00 in the larger towns and cities and from 12:00-18:00 in the smaller centres. In Dublin, almost all shops are open on a Sunday.

Shopping centres are open on Sundays with a later opening time (11:00 onwards) and closing time between 18:00-20:00.

Supermarkets, convenience stores and petrol stations are open longer hours than other shops on Sundays, typically from early morning (06:00-10:00) to late evening (20:00-00:00).

Alcohol can only be sold in shops with a special licence – this includes most supermarkets, convenience stores and petrol stations. Alcohol can only be bought between 12:30-22:00 on Sundays (where it is 10:30-22:00 on all other days).

The relaxed nature of the Sunday trading hours in the Republic of Ireland saw in previous years, a large influx of people from Northern Ireland crossing the border to shop, eat and drink as Northern Ireland traditionally had very strict Sunday trading rules – and still does to this day by comparison. For example, pubs in Northern Ireland were not permitted to open on Sundays until 1989. This affected trading in key border towns and cities, especially in County Donegal, County Monaghan, County Cavan and County Louth. Many people from Northern Ireland would spend most of their Sundays across the border, as nearly all of their shops, pubs and restaurants were open.

===== Netherlands =====
For more accurate information, see Shop time Law in the Netherlands from Dutch language Wikipedia. 

In The Netherlands, all municipalities have the authority to allow shops to open every Sunday. In major cities (such as such as Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht) most shops are open every Sunday from 1200-1700 or 1800. Nationwide, most supermarkets are open on a Sunday although opening hours vary. In the Christian-dominated Bible Belt area, most shops stay closed on Sundays due to severe pressure from conservative Christians claiming Sunday as a day for worship and rest only. In the past, municipalities would allow shops to open on particular Sundays, often once a month, and these would be known as a &quot;koopzondag&quot; in Dutch, literally a &quot;Sunday of buying&quot;.

===== Poland =====
Currently, there is a ban on trading on Sundays in Poland. Shopping malls, supermarkets and smaller shops are closed. Restaurants, online stores, filling stations (including their shops), some pharmacies, bakeries and post offices remain open. Due to a loophole in the law, some companies decided to extend their offer with additional services, e.g. the &quot;Żabka&quot; chain of stores, which also provide limited postal services.
There are exceptions to the trade ban – in 2021, there are 7 shopping Sundays, when shopping malls, supermarkets and other stores are open.

Currently, shopping hours of stores are restricted on 13 public holidays during the year. 
A bill has been put forward to the Polish parliament by the Solidarność trade union to ban Sunday shopping for larger retail stores all Sundays (apart from 7 Sundays during the year).

As a result of a long public debate in 2007, a law was passed banning trade on public holidays, but not on Sundays. The law entered into force on 26 October 2007, and the first day of the ban was All Saints&#x27; Day on 1 November 2007.

The days of restricted shopping are:

*1 January – New Year,
*6 January – Feast of the Epiphany (Three Kings&#x27; Day)
*Easter Sunday and Easter Monday (moving holiday, two days),
*1 May – National Day,
*3 May – Constitution Day,
*Pentecost (Pentecost Sunday, movable holiday),
*Corpus Christi Day (Feast of the Most Holy Body and Blood of the Lord), (movable holiday – always a Thursday)
*15 August – Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary as well as Armed Forces Day,
*1 November – All Saints&#x27; Day,
*11 November – National Independence Day,
*25 December and 26 December – Christmas and Boxing Day (St Stephen&#x27;s Day).

In 2014, the Sejm rejected a civil law bill amending the Labour Code, which prohibits stores closing on Sundays.

Currently stores close earlier on – this being in the interest of workers and not regulated legally:
*Easter Saturday – between opening to 16.00; 
*Christmas Eve – between opening to 14.00; 
*New Year&#x27;s Eve (St Silvester&#x27;s Day) – from opening to 18.00.

Employees are forbidden from working on public holidays. Only owners and contract workers can sell during holidays. Petrol stations and pharmacies are exempt from this restriction.

Planned Sunday Shopping Ban

A debate within Poland&#x27;s parliament is currently discussing the draft bill from the largest trade union, Solidarność, which submitted the bill to parliament to restrict retail trade on Sundays in late 2016. The ban on Sunday trading would affect most retail outlets, with some exceptions as pharmacies, bakeries (until 13.00), flower stores, religious stores and restaurants.

It would be forbidden, according to the bill, to open on all Sundays, apart from the following exceptions: 
* Third Sunday of Advent;
* Fourth Sunday of Advent;
* Palm Sunday (last Sunday before Easter)
* last Sunday in January, April, June and August.

Furthermore, store openings would be restricted to opening on the following days to 14.00: 
*Easter Saturday
*Christmas Eve

In March 2018 a new Polish law took effect, banning nearly all commerce on Sundays (except for the first and last Sunday of each month in 2018 and the last one in 2019), with supermarkets and most other retailers closed on Sundays for the first time since liberal shopping laws were introduced in the 1990s. The law had been passed by the Law and Justice party, with support of the Catholic Church.

===== Spain =====

Commercial liberalisation during the 1980s allowed Sunday shopping with no restrictions. However, due to pressure from the small independent shops, certain restrictions were introduced in the 1990s.

In June 2000, measures were adopted to liberalise shop opening hours, causing great controversy. The regional governments, the employers&#x27; associations representing small and medium-sized retailers and the trade unions opposed the reform. The CEOE employers&#x27; confederation and the employers&#x27; associations representing large retailers were in favour of the changes.

Currently, each autonomous community may establish its own Sunday opening calendar. The general trend is to allow Sunday opening once a month (usually the first Sunday) and every Sunday during special shopping seasons (including Christmas and sales). Certain sectors (including bars, restaurants, bakeries, pharmacies, fairly big convenience stores, small family-run stores, and bookshops) are granted an exception and may open every Sunday with no restrictions. It is not hard to find a small grocery store open on Sunday in any Spanish town as of 2011.

Religious concerns have been notably absent from the debate. The main bone of contention lies in the competition between big department stores, supermarkets and shopping centres, who push for complete liberalisation, and small family-run shops, who cannot afford extra staff to open on Sundays.

In July 2012 all restrictions were lifted for the whole Madrid metropolitan area and all towns in Madrid province. Ever since shopping malls, supermarkets and shops in city centres of each city have started opening every Sunday.

Shops in towns and areas declared as touristic are allowed to open every Sunday. The list as of 2013 is quite extensive as it includes central Madrid, most of Valencia municipality (including every shopping mall in the city), central Zaragoza, central Palma de Mallorca, most of the Catalan coastal area (except Barcelona), most of the Murcia coastal area, as well as many municipalities in the Madrid metropolitan area, the Andalusia coastal area and the Valencia coastal area. Shopping malls and hypermarkets in these areas usually stay open every Sunday.

In Spain, where relatively few restrictions survive, small retail stores open 46 hours per week on average. This runs counter to the prediction that Sunday shopping hurts retailers by leading all of them to open longer hours.

===== Sweden =====
There is no law restricting the opening hours of shops. The only exception to this rule is the government-owned liquor store monopoly Systembolaget, which is not allowed to open on Sundays, and have to close at 20:00 on weekdays and 15:00 on Saturdays.

In Sweden, 15 years after the liberalisation, supply as regards shop opening hours has not yet standardised itself. On the contrary, if 80% of the department stores and supermarkets are open on Sunday, only half of corner shops and 48% of furniture stores are open on this day. This supports the argument that consumer preferences can point in the direction of an extension of shop opening hours in a given area without this need arising in another area.

==== Other European countries ====

===== Norway =====

In Norway only petrol stations, flower nurseries and grocery shops that are smaller than are allowed to operate on Sundays. For special occasions such as Christmas shopping there are exceptions.

=====Switzerland=====

Federal labour law in Switzerland generally prohibits the employment of staff on Sundays. The law provides for exceptions for very small shops, shops in certain tourist areas as well as shops in major train stations and airports. The latter provision was adopted in a 2005 popular referendum in which it was opposed by labour unions and conservative Christian groups. Moreover, the cantons may allow shops to open on up to four Sundays a year.

Pursuant to an ordinance of the Federal Department of Economic Affairs, the following train stations and airports are allowed to include shops that are open on Sundays: Aarau, Baden, Basel SBB, Bellinzona, Bern, Biel, Brig, Chur, Frauenfeld, Fribourg, Geneva, Lausanne, Lugano, Lucerne, Neuchâtel, Olten, Schaffhausen, Solothurn, St. Gallen, Thun, Uster, Visp, Wil, Winterthur, Zug, Zürich Enge, Zürich Hauptbahnhof, Zürich Oerlikon, Zürich Stadelhofen; Bern Airport, Geneva Cointrin International Airport, Lugano Airport, Sion Airfield, St. Gallen-Altenrhein Airport, Zürich Airport.

===== United Kingdom =====

======England and Wales======
By 1994, Sunday trading in England and Wales was not generally permitted. This meant that shops such as department stores and supermarkets were not able to open legally. A number of specialist outlets were able to open legally, including garden centres, small &quot;corner&quot; or family-run shops, and chemists. An earlier attempt by Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government to allow Sunday shopping in 1986 was defeated in Parliament, with opposition coming from Conservative MPs who saw it as a threat to family life and church attendance, and Labour MPs who were concerned about workers&#x27; rights. This led to the formation of the Keep Sunday Special campaign, backed by church groups and USDAW, the trade union representing shop workers.

Several large retailers challenged the legal ruling in force, with some opening on Sundays from Christmas 1991 onwards This led to the Sunday Trading Act 1994 permitted &quot;large shops&quot; – those with a &quot;relevant floor area&quot; in excess of – to open for up to six hours on Sunday between the hours of 10 am and 6 pm. Small shops, those with an area of below 280 m2, are free to set their own Sunday trading times.

However, some large shops, such as off-licences, service stations and garages, are exempt from the restrictions. Christmas Day and Easter Sunday have been excluded as trading days. This applies even to garden centres, which earlier had been trading over Easter, but not to small shops (those with an area of below 280 square metres). In 2006, the government considered further relaxation of the permitted hours of business but decided that there was no consensus for change, although a popular poll indicated differently. Some local councils require a trader to give notice before trading on Sundays, but they cannot refuse permission; so most councils no longer even require notice.

Since the 1994 Act allowed stores to open, stores seem to keep to it meticulously, perhaps more so than before when they were flagrantly breaching the law by opening at all. However, there is a tendency to open half an hour earlier but not allow sales before the allotted time, to allow people to &quot;browse&quot; and thus effectively extend the opening hours of the store without breaking the law. For example, in Birmingham in 2005 several stores opened seven hours, 10.30 am to 5.30 pm, but would not have been able to sell throughout that time without breaking the law.

In 2012, emergency legislation was passed stipulating that Sunday Trading Laws (Sunday Trading Act 1994) would be suspended by the government on eight weekends from 22 July during the Olympics and Paralympics.

In 2014 Philip Davies MP (Conservative, Shipley) called for a permanent abolition of the restrictions.

In July 2015 it was proposed that Sunday trading hours should become a devolved issue for local government. The Enterprise Bill 2015–16 introduced in September 2015 included a provision for major towns and cities to decide how long shops could open for on Sundays. However, the bill&#x27;s proposals with regard to Sunday trading were defeated in the House of Commons in March 2016 and the government indicated that it had no intention to reintroduce the measure.

======Scotland======
Sunday trading laws in Scotland are devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

Scotland has never had any &quot;general&quot; legislation regarding Sunday trading. However, the Sunday Working (Scotland) Act 2003 prohibits shops from compelling their workers to work on Sunday. This lack of restriction allows opening hours of larger shops to be longer than in England and Wales and Northern Ireland, and many large supermarkets remain open seven days a week with little or no adjustment of opening hours at the weekend. There is no equivalent to the legal restriction on Easter Sunday opening that exists in England and Wales, but opening on Christmas Day is very unusual.

Actual practice varies across the country according to local custom and local council regulation. In the Western Isles, where the Free Church of Scotland has a considerable following, there is virtually no commercial activity on Sundays until 6:45 am on Monday. In tourist and holiday areas there is typically an increase in the number of shops opening late and on Sundays during their particular tourist seasons.

Former restrictions include:
* Until 1994 barbers and hairdressers in Scotland were prohibited by s.67 of the Shops Act 1950 from carrying out their business on a Sunday.
* Until 2009 alcohol could not be sold until 12:30 pm. This has now changed to 10 am, the same as every other day of the week.

======Northern Ireland======
In Northern Ireland, Sunday trading is regulated under the Sunday Trading (Northern Ireland) Order 1997. Opening hours are more limited for larger stores, or a floor area exceeding . Normally, a large shop may trade only between the hours of 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Sundays. This was to create a greater gap between Sunday services and the opening of large shops, in response to objections from churches, especially the Protestant churches, which have more influence than in the rest of the UK. Large shops within holiday resorts (designated by the district council) may opt for unrestricted trading hours on up to 18 Sundays (but not on Easter Day) per calendar year between the dates of 1 March and 30 September. Shop owners in violation of the Sunday trading law may be fined up to £50,000.

Pubs in Northern Ireland were not allowed to open on Sundays until 1989.

=== Asia ===

====China====

Very little regulation applies to Sunday trading. The majority of stores maintain similar opening hours as on a normal business day, while others have extended hours to accommodate the weekend shopping wave.

====Hong Kong====

While Sunday is a holiday or day of rest, shopping hours are not regulated and decided wholly by store owners.
Most of the shops open on Sunday from 10 am or 11 am to 10 pm or 11 pm.

====Philippines====
Sunday shopping is generally allowed in the predominantly Catholic Philippines, where families go out to major retailers, and even hear Mass at purpose-built mall chapels. Store hours on Sundays are usually the same as on Mondays to Thursdays, which tend to close earlier than on Fridays and Saturdays. During Holy Week, the three days preceding Easter Sunday see stores closed or operating on shorter hours, as with many television and radio stations. All these completely reopen to full hours on Easter Sunday itself.

=== Africa ===

==== South Africa ====
There are no specific restrictions on Sunday shopping in South Africa, but it tends to be limited to supermarkets and retail businesses in large shopping malls. This is likely a result of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, which requires that workers are paid 1.5 times the normal rate on a Sunday. In addition, provincial liquor licensing usually restricts the sale of alcohol on a Sunday.

=== North America ===

==== Canada ====
In Canada, each province and territory has its own legislation regarding employment standards and Sunday shopping.

In 1982, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the &quot;Lord&#x27;s Day Act&quot;. However, at that time, only the Canadian Bill of Rights existed. That document only protected existing Canadian rights. As a result, the Court noted that Canada was an overwhelmingly Christian country that had accepted Sunday closing laws for years. The Court determined that the &quot;Lord&#x27;s Day Act&quot; did not force people to practice Christianity or stop practising their own religion.

However, later that year, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was introduced, ensuring freedom of conscience and religion, regardless of existing federal or provincial laws. On 24 April 1985, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the &quot;Lord&#x27;s Day Act&quot; violated Canadians&#x27; freedom of religion. The 1985 ruling examined the original purpose of the act. It found that the Christian value of keeping Sunday holy had been incorporated into a law that affected all Canadians, Christian or not. This law—the &quot;Lord&#x27;s Day Act&quot;—prevented non-Christians from performing otherwise legal activities on Sundays. This was inconsistent with the Canadian charter.

=====Alberta=====
In 1984, the province of Alberta granted municipalities the right to allow, or prohibit, retail stores opening on Sundays. By the end of 1984, some stores in Edmonton were open on Sundays, but the controversy over Sunday openings continued for a number of years. In some communities in Alberta, the question was still being debated in 1990.

=====Nova Scotia=====
Until October 4, 2006, Nova Scotia was the only province in Canada that prohibited year-round Sunday shopping. An experiment with the practice was held in 2003 and in 2004 a binding plebiscite was held which resulted in 45% of voters in favour of Sunday shopping and 55% voting against the practice. The &quot;Retail Business Uniform Closing Day Act&quot; allowed some stores, such as video rental outlets, pharmacies and book stores, to open on Sundays, but department stores had to remain closed. The restrictions were based on the area of a store and its form of business.

By mid-2006, several grocers in Nova Scotia including Pete&#x27;s Frootique and larger chains such as Atlantic Superstore and Sobeys circumvented the law by reconfiguring their stores on Sundays into separate businesses, each of which was small enough in area to be exempt from the &quot;Retail Business Uniform Closing Day Act&quot;. For example, a Halifax-area Sobeys location was known as the &quot;Sobeys Queen Street Mall&quot; and housed the Sobeys Retail Fish Store Ltd., Sobeys Fruit Stand Ltd., Sobeys Bakery and Bulk Food Ltd. and eight other separate &quot;businesses&quot;.

On June 23, 2006, the Premier of Nova Scotia, Rodney MacDonald, announced new limits on Sunday shopping as a means to honour the wishes of voters in the 2004 plebiscite. The proposed new regulations prohibited grocers and other retailers from opening if they reconfigured their businesses as separate operating units after 1 June 2006. The premier also announced that he would seek the views of the public in a new plebiscite to coincide with municipal elections scheduled for 2008.

On July 2, 2006, members of the Halifax Regional Police entered the Barrington Street Atlantic Superstore in Halifax with measuring tapes and began an investigation to see if the grocer was in compliance with the &quot;Retail Business Uniform Closing Day Act&quot;. Three days later, on July 5, 2006, Sobeys filed a motion in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia to have the &quot;Retail Business Uniform Closing Day Act&quot; and the new regulations announced by Premier MacDonald to be declared invalid. Sobeys was joined by Atlantic Superstore in the case, who entered by seeking intervener status.

Sobeys felt that the law was unjust since it permitted competitors such as Pete&#x27;s Frootique in Bedford to open Sundays. Pete&#x27;s Frootique had taken the provincial government to court seven years earlier and won the right to open on Sundays with its separate operating divisions, thus it was &quot;grandfathered&quot; in the new regulations announced by Premier MacDonald.

On 4 October 2006, the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia ruled that the Government of Nova Scotia had overstepped its authority by forcing the supermarkets to close. In response, Premier Rodney MacDonald announced that effective Sunday, October 8, Sunday shopping would be an unrestricted option open to all retail stores, and can be open on all holidays except Remembrance Day, for which there was a separate provincial law forcing all businesses to close. Since then, Sunday shopping has been adopted throughout the province.

=====Ontario=====

After the demise of the &quot;Lord&#x27;s Day Act&quot;, the &quot;Retail Business Holidays Act&quot; of Ontario still prohibited most stores from opening on Sundays. However, there were exceptions to these rules (for example, gas stations, convenience stores, tourist areas). Many store owners who opposed the law decided to open their stores on Sundays, knowing they were breaking the law. Some, such as Marc Emery, were jailed for doing so.

In June 1990, the Supreme Court of Ontario found the act to be unconstitutional. As a result, Ontario had nine months of open-wide Sunday shopping, until the Ontario Court of Appeal&#x27;s reversal of the decision in March 1991.

However, public opposition to Sunday closing continued to rise. Bowing to public pressure, the Rae government amended the &quot;Retail Business Holidays Act&quot; in June 1992 to permit Sunday shopping in Ontario.

=====Other Canadian provinces=====

Several other provinces have restrictions of some degree on Sunday shopping.

In Prince Edward Island, it is only permitted after 12 noon from the Sunday before Victoria Day until Christmas Eve. This was repealed on November 25, 2010, allowing stores to open at any time on Sunday year-round.

In Manitoba, it is up to each municipality for approval. As of January 2021, Sunday shopping is permitted without restrictions.

In New Brunswick, the decisions require dual approval from municipal and provincial officials (although that is in the process of being changed), otherwise it is only permitted from August to the first Sunday in January. Some cities restrict Sunday hours to 12:00 pm to 5:00 pm. Fredericton has recently (as of August 12, 2013) passed a law revoking any restrictions on Sunday shopping hours.

In the 1990s, Quebec allowed wide-open shopping from 8:00 am until 5:00 pm the exception being grocery stores that could remain open later, but they could not have more than four employees on staff after 5:00 pm. The law was changed in the 2000s to allow supermarkets to remain open until 8:00.
pm with an unlimited number of employees.

Other provinces allow wide-open shopping all day on most Sundays (except when it falls on a holiday or when objected by municipalities).

Newfoundland and Labrador lifted restrictions on retail stores operating on Sundays starting on January 1, 1998.

==== United States ====

Many states in the United States have reduced hours of operation on Sundays in some form or another. A few local municipalities still prohibit Sunday shopping. Some local jurisdictions have regulations on if and when bars and restaurants may be open on Sundays.

===== New Jersey =====
One of the last major areas to completely prohibit Sunday shopping is Bergen County, New Jersey. This area contains one of the largest and most popular commercial shopping cores of the New York metropolitan area (for example, one of four local IKEA stores is found here, the store is the only one in the United States to be closed on Sunday, and is also home to four large shopping malls). Ironically, the area is not considered to be particularly very religious compared to the U.S. population at large, and it also has significant Jewish and Muslim populations whose observant members would not be celebrating the Sabbath on Sunday. Attempts to repeal the law have failed as many locals either like to keep the law on the books as a protest against the growing trend of increased Sunday shopping activity in American society or fear the potential increase of Sunday traffic on major local roads such as Route 4 or Route 17. Some local Orthodox Jews who are off both days of the weekend have complained about the law because it limits their ability to get shopping done on the weekend without having to travel to a neighboring county as religious beliefs prohibit shopping on Friday night or on Saturday before nightfall, which in the summer can be right before most department stores and malls close. Governor Chris Christie made an unsuccessful attempt in 2010 to remove the law bringing extra tax revenue for the state budget, then in 2012, he suspended the law after Hurricane Sandy which lasted for one Sunday, but went back into effect later.

===== North Dakota =====
North Dakota had one of the toughest blue laws in the United States until 2019, which required all stores to be closed from midnight to noon on Sundays. Prior to 1991, the law was more restrictive, with all sales being prohibited on a Sunday.

===== Georgia and Oklahoma =====
Georgia and Oklahoma require liquor stores to be closed on Sundays, as did Minnesota until 2017. However, alcohol can still be served in restaurants and bars on Sunday unless local (county or city) ordinances prohibit or restrict their doing so. For instance, in Georgia, most of the Metro Atlanta area counties serve alcohol at restaurants and bars, but the establishments must have a certain amount of food sales in order to be opened and serve alcohol on Sundays. Yet many of Georgia&#x27;s rural counties and some outer metropolitan Atlanta counties, such as Barrow County, remain completely dry on Sundays. In those counties on Sundays, bars are closed, and restaurants are allowed to operate but are prohibited from serving alcohol. There was discussion in the Georgia legislature in the late 2000s (decade) to repeal the state&#x27;s blue laws regarding Sunday retail alcohol sales in a measure to increase tax revenue. However, then-Governor Sonny Perdue said that he would not sign the bills repealing the laws if they passed in Georgia&#x27;s state house and senate. In Oklahoma, it is illegal to sell packaged liquor (off-premises sales) on Sundays, as well as Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.

===== Virginia =====
Virginia prohibits hard liquor sales except through stores operated by its state-owned Alcoholic Beverage Commission (ABC), which sets hours for its own stores and currently dictates that all or almost all of its establishments are to remain closed on Sundays. In this way, the combination of state-enforced monopoly and state-sanctioned authority to set hours results in a &quot;de facto&quot; prohibition on Sunday hard liquor sales in Virginia. Although grocery and convenience stores may sell beer and wine containing 14% or less alcohol by volume, state law permits localities to prohibit Sunday sales of these alcoholic beverages as well.

===== North Carolina =====
North Carolina only permits hard liquor to be sold through state-controlled stores that are almost all closed on Sundays. Beer and wine may be sold in grocery and convenience stores, but only after noon on Sunday.

===== District of Columbia =====
The District of Columbia prohibits sales of alcohol by liquor stores on Sundays. Grocery stores and retailers selling alcohol to be consumed on their premises are not subject to this prohibition.

===== Others =====
Some states, including Indiana and Pennsylvania, also prohibit car dealerships from selling vehicles on Sunday.

=== South America ===
Sunday shopping is allowed in every country. Most shopping malls and supermarkets stay open every Sunday in Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Uruguay, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia etc.

Sunday opening became widespread in most of South America by the early 1980s.

=== Oceania ===

==== Australia ====

The situation in Australia is not uniform, as each of its states and territories has its own laws. Historically, shops closed for the weekend on Saturday afternoons, with South Australia being the first state to allow Saturday afternoon opening. Most states now allow Sunday opening, with unregulated trading in NSW, Victoria, Tasmania, the ACT and the Northern Territory.

Certain shops are generally made exempt, or partially exempt, from trading hours laws (including restrictions on Sunday trading) under certain conditions. Shops that are not exempt from trading hours restrictions are referred to as &quot;general&quot; or &quot;non-exempt&quot; shops. Although these vary from state to state, generally speaking, exemptions can be based on one or more of the following:

* a maximum number of employees employed by the shop, or staffed at any one time (for example, New South Wales exempts shops with no more than four staff at any one time),
* by the floor size of the shop (for example, South Australia exempts shops with a floor space of less than 200m2),
* by the type of goods the shop sells – for example, hardware and furniture shops are often partially exempted, while shops such as newsagents, flowers, certain food shops (other than supermarkets) and chemists are often fully exempt, or
* by its location, often in significant tourist areas – either by inclusion, or by exclusion – i.e. declaring that trading hours outside of designated areas are deregulated.

===== New South Wales =====

Trading hours in New South Wales are largely deregulated following the enactment of the &quot;Shop Trading Act 2008&quot;, which commenced operation on 1 July 2008.

Under the current act, Sunday trading is unrestricted; however, retail shops must close on Good Friday, Easter Sunday, Christmas Day, Boxing Day, and until 1 pm on ANZAC Day, unless exempted. Exemptions are granted generally by virtue of small size, location, types of goods traded; other shops must apply for an exemption to trade on a restricted day through the Department of Industrial Relations.

Prior to these laws, shops not generally exempted were required to apply to trade on Sunday and other public holidays, to be granted if the shop was &quot;serving predominantly the tourist or visitor trade, significant public demand or operates in a holiday resort area&quot;. In practice however, Sunday trading remained commonplace.

===== Victoria =====

Trading hours are deregulated in Victoria; shopping is allowed at any time, except for Anzac Day morning (before 1 pm), Good Friday and Christmas Day. Victoria is also famous for first introducing round-the-clock 36-hour shopping before Christmas, even if this fell on a Sunday. In Victoria Boxing Day is also one of the busiest days of the shopping year, and many stores are open through extended hours even if it falls on a Sunday. Victoria is one of only a select number of states which feature 24-hour Kmart stores, open every day of the year except for Christmas Day.

===== Queensland =====

Non-exempt shops in Queensland are permitted to trade from 9 am to 6 pm and from 8:30 am to 5:30 pm in certain coastal towns north of Brisbane. Permission for regional cities to trade on Sundays is made by the local council that governs it.

===== South Australia =====

South Australia introduced Sunday trading for non-exempt shops in 2003. Non-exempt shops are restricted to opening between 9 am and 5 pm in the Adelaide metropolitan area. Trading hours are also restricted in a number of &quot;Proclaimed Shopping Districts&quot; in country South Australia, where non-exempt shops must remain closed on Sunday. Local governments can apply to have their Proclaimed Shopping District altered or abolished.

===== Western Australia =====

The Retail Trading Hours Act 1987 applies to retail shops in Western Australia south of the 26th parallel. It sets out the trading hours and rules covering various categories of retail outlets. The trading hours of restaurants, cafes and takeaway food shops are not covered by the Act.

General retail shops are permitted to trade in the Perth metropolitan area between 8:00 am and 9:00 pm Monday to Friday, 8:00 am to 5:00 pm on Saturday, 11:00 am to 5:00 pm Sunday and public holidays. General retail shops are required to be closed on Christmas Day, Good Friday and ANZAC Day.

===== Tasmania =====

Trading hours in Tasmania have been deregulated since 1 December 2002, with shops only being required to close on Christmas Day, Good Friday, and Anzac Day morning. Previously, businesses with more than 250 employees were not permitted to trade on Sundays. This restriction can be gazetted by the relevant minister for these shops, but only on the advice of a local council, and only after a referendum of voters in that local government area is carried.

===== Australian Capital Territory =====

Trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) have been deregulated since the repeal of the &quot;Trading Hours Act 1996&quot; on 29 May 1997. The 1996 act restricted trading of &quot;large supermarkets&quot; to between 7 am and 5 pm on Sundays, provided other trading hours were not gazetted by the relevant minister. Large supermarkets were those with greater than 400m2 in floor area, and located in the City or the Belconnen, Woden and Tuggeranong Town Centres.

==== New Zealand ====

New Zealand, which banned trading on Saturday and Sunday completely between 1945 and 1980, liberalised shopping hours in 1990. Shops may open at any time, with the exception of all-day Good Friday, Easter Sunday, and Christmas Day, and before 1 pm on Anzac Day. Certain types of shops, such as petrol stations and dairies, are specifically excluded from this restriction and are still allowed to trade on these days.

<text>Wanda Rutkiewicz ( 4 February 1943 – 12–13 May 1992) was a Polish mountaineer and computer engineer. She was the first woman to reach the summit of K2 and the third woman (first European woman) to summit Mount Everest.

==Early life==
Wanda Rutkiewicz was born into an educated Polish family in Plungė, Lithuania. Her father, Zbigniew Błaszkiewicz, was an engineer for the Communal Building Projects Bureau (Biuro Projektów Budownictwa Komunalnego). Zbigniew was also a passionate sportsman. He excelled at swimming, shooting, and judo. Maria, her mother, on the other hand, enjoyed reading about Western culture and traveling in the Himalayas. After World War II, her family chose to leave for Poland, first moving to Łańcut before settling in Wrocław in southwestern Poland&#x27;s Recovered Territories. She was initially homeschooled, but began attending 2nd grade in elementary school in 1949 and joined the 18 Scout Team of the “Zośka” Battalion. When she was five, her seven-year-old brother, Jerzy, was killed after finding an unexploded bomb with his friends in post-war Wrocław.

Rutkiewicz was a multi-sport athlete. While in the elementary school she would practice running with her school&#x27;s coaches every day before classes started. She trained long jump, discus throw, and high jump. In 1961 she won the gold medal in the Polish University Club Championships in the shot put. As a student in the Politechnic institute, she joined the Academic Sports Union (AZS Wrocław), where she opted to play volleyball. Despite standing at just 168 cm tall, she led AZS Wrocław to the 1965 Summer Universiade in Budapest. Some speculated that Rutkiewicz might have been called up to the national team or even represent Poland in the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, but she chose to pursue climbing instead. She graduated from Wroclaw University of Technology as an electrical engineer.

Rutkiewicz rode a Junak, the heaviest Polish motorcycle, which indirectly contributed to her interest in climbing. One summer&#x27;s day in 1961, it ran out of fuel. She started waving to people passing on the road to seek their assistance; a motorcyclist who stopped to help was travelling with a colleague, Bogdan Jankowski, who had been climbing for two years. This chance meeting resulted in them climbing together near Janowice Wielkie in the Falcon Mountains ().

==Climbing career==

Her first major expedition was to the Pamir Mountains with Andrzej Zawada, which she found unpleasant due to her difficult relationships with the male climbers.

After returning she began to lead her own expeditions, including a number of all-female ones, and became known for her blunt leadership style.
On 16 October 1978, she became the first Pole, the third woman (after Junko Tabei and Phantog in 1975), and the first European woman to reach the summit of Mount Everest. She managed to accomplish this climb despite suffering from anemia. In fact, she carried injections of iron with her, so she could raise her hemoglobin levels to remain conscious during the climb. She reached Mount Everest the same day that her compatriot, Cardinal Karol Wojtyła, whom Rutkiewicz met in 1979, was announced Pope John Paul II. The Pope said of their accomplishments, &quot;The good Lord wanted this--that we rise so high on the same day.&quot; In 1986, she became the first woman to successfully climb K2, which she did without supplemental oxygen, as part of a small expedition led by Liliane and Maurice Barrard. Her triumph was marred when both the Barrards died during the descent, becoming two of 13 climbers to die on K2 that summer.
Rutkiewicz&#x27;s goal was to become the first woman to reach the summits of all 14 of the eight-thousanders. During her climbing career she successfully climbed the following mountains:
* 1975 – Gasherbrum III
* 1978 – Mount Everest
* 1985 – Nanga Parbat
* 1986 – K2
* 1987 – Shishapangma
* 1989 – Gasherbrum II
* 1990 – Gasherbrum I
* 1991 – Cho Oyu
* 1991 – Annapurna I
* 1992 – Kangchenjunga (uncertain)

==Death==
While climbing Kangchenjunga in 1992, 49-year-old Rutkiewicz was last seen alive by Mexican climber Carlos Carsolio. She was sheltering at high altitude on the north-west face, during her attempted ascent of what would have been her ninth eight-thousander. Despite being physically weakened she decided against descending. Carsolio said he did not have the mental strength to convince her to descend because he was weakened as well.

It was thought that her body had been found on the south-west face of the mountain in 1995 by Fausto de Stefani, Marco Galezzi and Silvio Mondinelli, suggesting that she had climbed up the north-west ridge to a point very close to the summit before falling down the south-west side. However, more detailed analysis of the findings by the Italian climbers, such as colour of clothing and presence of Bulgarian-made tablets with the body, indicate that it was probably the body of Bulgarian climber Yordanka Dimitrova, who was killed by an avalanche on the south-west face of Kangchenjunga in October 1994. It is unknown if Rutkiewicz reached the summit of Kangchenjunga. If she did so, she would have been the first woman to reach the top of the world&#x27;s three highest mountains. Her body has still not been found.

== Commemoration ==

On 16 October 2019, Rutkiewicz was the subject of the daily Google Doodle on the forty-first anniversary of her ascent of Mount Everest. The image shows her climbing snowy peaks on the railing rope. In October 2021, the Polish Parliament passed a resolution to commemorate the 30th anniversary of her death and named 2022 as the &quot;Year of Wanda Rutkiewicz&quot;.

<doc id="908931" wikidata="Q828398" url="?curid=908931" title="Hutsuls">
<text>The Hutsuls (Hutsul/; ; ) are an East Slavic ethnic group spanning parts of western Ukraine and Romania (i.e. parts of Bukovina and Maramureș). 

In Ukraine, they have often been officially and administratively designated a subgroup of Ukrainians, and, among the Ukrainian scholars, are largely regarded as constituting a broader Ukrainian ethnic group. However, in eyes of some scholars and of some Hutsuls, they are either their own nation, or a part of the Rusyn nation, alongside the closely related ethnic groups of Boykos and Lemkos.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name &quot;Hutsul&quot; is uncertain. The most common derivations are from the Romanian word for &quot;outlaw&quot; (cf. Rom. &quot;hoț&quot; &quot;thief&quot;, &quot;hoțul&quot; &quot;the thief&quot;), and the Slavic &quot;kochul&quot; (Ukr. &quot;kochovyk&quot; &quot;nomad&quot;) which is a reference to the semi-nomadic shepherd lifestyle or the inhabitants who fled into the mountains after the Mongol invasion. Other proposed derivations include from the Turkic tribe of the Utsians or Uzians, and even to the name of the Moravian Grand Duke Hetsyla, among others. As the name is first attested in 1816, it is considered to be of recent origin and as an exonym, used by neighboring groups and not Hutsuls themselves, although some have embraced it. The region inhabited by Hutsuls is named as Hutsulshchyna. Their name is also found in the name of Hutsul Alps, Hutsul Beskyd, Hutsulshchyna National Park, and National Museum of Hutsulshchyna and Pokuttia Folk Art.

==History and origins==
Hutsuls inhabit areas situated between the south-east of those inhabited by the Boykos, down to the northern part of the Romanian segment of the Carpathians. Several hypotheses account for the origin of the Hutsuls, however, like all the Rusyns, they most probably have a diverse ethnogenetic origin. It is generally considered to be descendants of the White Croats, a Slavic tribe that inhabited the area, also Tivertsi, and possibly Ulichs who had to leave their previous home near the Southern Bug river under pressure from the Pechenegs. There is also considered a relation to Vlach shepherds who later immigrated from Transylvania, because of which some scholars like Romanian historian Nicolae Iorga argued that &quot;huțuli&quot; or &quot;huțani&quot; are denationalized Vlachs / Romanians. According to the 1930 Romanian census, in Romania within its borders at that time, including northern Bukovina, currently a part of Ukraine, there were 12,456 Hutsuls. According to the Romanian census of 1941, in addition to the mostly (51.2%) self-identified ethnically Ukrainian population of Northern Bukovina, almost all the 6,767 inhabitants of the Seletyn district (plasa) were self-identified ethnic Hutsuls.

==Language==
In Ukraine, Hutsul is considered to be a dialect of Western Ukrainian with some Polish and Ukrainian influences along with Pokuttia-Bukovina dialect and the dialects of the Lemkos and Boykos - however, all three are often also often classified as either their own languages or as dialects of Rusyn.
Since the annexation of western Ukraine regions, including Ivano-Frankivsk and Chernivtsi Oblast as well as Transcarpathia by the Soviet Union, compulsory education has been conducted only in standardized literary Ukrainian. In recent years there have been grassroots efforts to keep the traditional Hutsul dialect alive.

==Way of life and culture==

Traditional Hutsul culture is often represented by the colorful and intricate craftsmanship of their clothing, sculpture, architecture, woodworking, metalworking (especially in brass), rug weaving (see &quot;lizhnyk&quot;), pottery (see Kosiv ceramics), and egg decorating (&quot;see pysanka&quot;). Along with other Hutsul traditions, as well as their songs and dances, this culture is often celebrated and highlighted by the different countries that Hutsuls inhabit.

Ukrainian Hutsul culture bears a resemblance to neighboring cultures of western and southwestern Ukraine, particularly Lemkos and Boykos. These groups also share similarities with other Slavic highlander peoples, such as the Gorals in Poland and Slovakia. Similarities have also been noted with some Vlach cultures such as the Moravian Wallachians in the Czech Republic, as well as some cultures in Romania. Most Hutsuls belong to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.

Hutsul society was traditionally based on forestry and logging, as well as cattle and sheep breeding; the Hutsuls are credited with having created the breed of horse known as the Hucul pony. One of the main attributes of Hutsuls&#x27; is their Shepherd&#x27;s axe (bartka), a small axe with a long handle that is still used to this day for chopping wood, as a cane, for fighting and traditional ceremonies. They would often be intricately decorated with traditional wood carving designs and passed on from generation to generation especially upon marriage. They use unique musical instruments, including the &quot;trembita&quot; &quot;(trâmbiţa)&quot;, a type of alpenhorn, as well multiple varieties of the fife, or &quot;sopilka&quot;, that are used to create unique folk melodies and rhythms. Also frequently used are the &quot;duda&quot; (bagpipe), the &quot;drymba&quot; (Jew&#x27;s harp), and the &quot;tsymbaly&quot; (hammered dulcimer).

The Hutsuls served as an inspiration for many artists, such as writers Ivan Franko, Lesya Ukrainka, Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky, Vasyl Stefanyk, Marko Cheremshyna, Mihail Sadoveanu and Stanisław Vincenz, and painters such as Kazimierz Sichulski and Teodor Axentowicz—noted for his portraits and subtle scenes of Hutsul life—and Halyna Zubchenko. Sergei Parajanov&#x27;s 1965 film &quot;Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors&quot; (&quot;Тіні забутих предків&quot;), which is based on the book by Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky, portrays scenes of traditional Hutsul life. Composer Ludmila Anatolievna Yaroshevskaya composed a work for piano based on Hutsul folk music (&quot;Fantasy on Hutsul Themes&quot;).

Every summer, the village of Sheshory in Ukraine hosts a three-day international festival of folk music and art. Two Hutsul-related museums are located in Kolomyia, Ukraine: the Pysanka museum and the Museum of Hutsul and Pokuttia Folk Art. Traditional Hutsul sounds and moves were used by the Ukrainian winner of the 2004 Eurovision song contest, Ruslana Lyzhychko.

The Romanian Hutsuls have a Festival of Hutsuls at the Moldova-Sulița village in Suceava county.
In the 1996 elections to the Romanian Chamber of Deputies, the General Union of the Associations of the Hutsul Ethnicity (Uniunea Generala a Asociatiilor Etniei Hutule) obtained 646 votes (0.01% of the total). In the 2000 elections to the Romanian Chamber of Deputies, the General Union of the Associations of the Hutsul Ethnicity (Uniunea Generala a Asociatiilor Etniei Hutule) obtained 1225 votes out of 10,839,424 votes (0.01% of the total). According to the representatives of the Hutsuls, in the 2002 census, they &quot;preferred to declare themselves Romanians in order not to be included in the category of Ukrainians&quot;.

<doc id="908941" wikidata="Q5271582" url="?curid=908941" title="Disappearance of Diane Suzuki">
<text>Diane Suzuki was a nineteen-year-old dancer and student at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa who disappeared on July 6, 1985, and has since been the focus of one of the most notorious modern criminal investigations in the history of the state of Hawaii. The Diane Suzuki investigation was the first instance in which the Honolulu Police Department used luminol and other technological advances in forensic science.

==Disappearance==
Suzuki was a female resident of Halawa, 4 feet 11 inches tall, 109 pounds, with a slim build, and of Japanese descent. Suzuki was last seen at about 5 p.m. on July 6, 1985, outside the Rosalie Woodson Dance Academy in Aiea, where she was employed as a dance instructor. At the time of her disappearance she was dating Lester Gantan.

During the same time period in Hawaii, there were the unsolved killings of at least nine women on Oahu, including the deaths of Lisa Au, Regina Sakamoto, and others all over the island. Five, including that of Sakamoto, in which the victims were found with their hands tied behind their back, were attributed to an unidentified serial killer known as the Honolulu Strangler. However, Suzuki&#x27;s disappearance did not fit that profile.

==Investigation and aftermath==
The discovery of blood evidence at the site led to legislation that overhauled Hawaii&#x27;s harassment laws to include stalking, and changed the status of TRO violations to a class C felony (with a maximum penalty of 5 years in jail) in the hope of preventing further violence against women. In 1993, Keith Kaneshiro, who was then prosecuting attorney for the City and County of Honolulu, attempted to re-open the case, but after more than 300 hours of grand jury testimony and thousands of dollars spent on the investigation, no charges were filed. The case remains unsolved.

==Media==
Retired Honolulu Police Department Major Gary Dias wrote a book entitled &quot;Honolulu Cop&quot; including details on his investigation into the Au and Suzuki murders.

<text>The men&#x27;s 200 metre [[breaststroke]] event at the 2004 Olympic Games was contested at the Olympic Aquatic Centre of the Athens Olympic Sports Complex in Athens, Greece on August 17 and 18.

After missing out the semifinals in Sydney four years earlier, Japan&#x27;s Kosuke Kitajima shattered one of the longest-standing Olympic swimming records when he clocked 2:09.44, erasing a 0.77-second mark by American swimmer Mike Barrowman in 1992. This achievement secured a breaststroke double for the second consecutive time. In a surprise turn of events, 15-year-old Dániel Gyurta of Hungary claimed the silver medal with a time of 2:10.80, narrowly edging out U.S. swimmer Brendan Hansen in a close race by 0.07 of a second. Hansen, who broke Kitajima&#x27;s world record at the U.S. Olympic trials one month ago, finished third in 2:10.87.

<doc id="908944" wikidata="Q3666678" url="?curid=908944" title="Charlie Robertson">
<text>Charles Culbertson Robertson (January 31, 1896 – August 23, 1984) was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a pitcher, and is best remembered for throwing a perfect game in 1922.

==Early life and career==
Robertson was born in Dexter, Texas and grew up in Nocona, Texas. He graduated from Nocona High School in 1915. Charles attended Austin College from 1917 until 1919.

He began his career with the Chicago White Sox in 1919 at the age of 23. Robertson was an average player for most of his career, having a career record of 49–80 and never winning more than he lost during a single season.

His main pitch throughout his career was a slow curveball which he often threw on the first pitch to a batter on any side of the plate, followed by a fastball up in the zone.

==Perfect Game==

On April 30, 1922, in just his fourth career start, he pitched the fifth perfect game in baseball history against the Detroit Tigers at Navin Field (later known as Tiger Stadium) in Detroit. He became the first pitcher in major league history to throw a perfect game on the road.

The Detroit lineup featured such Hall of Famers as Ty Cobb and Harry Heilmann, who both complained that he was doctoring the ball throughout the game. The Tigers submitted several game balls to American League President Ban Johnson after the game to check for irregularities, but Johnson dismissed the charge.

Robertson&#x27;s perfect game was the last for 34 years, when Don Larsen pitched one in the 1956 World Series against the Brooklyn Dodgers; the next regular season perfect game would not come until Jim Bunning&#x27;s perfect game in 1964.

After the perfect game, he suffered arm troubles for the rest of his career. He pitched one season for the St. Louis Browns and two years with the Boston Braves and retired from baseball in 1928.

==Personal life==
After retiring from baseball, Robertson became a prosperous pecan broker in Fort Worth, Texas. He returned to the limelight after Don Larsen threw a perfect game in the 1956 World Series, the first in the Major Leagues since Robertson&#x27;s own 34 years earlier. Six days after Larsen&#x27;s game, Robertson appeared as a contestant on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;.

Robertson was married to Fay Redus, whom he met when he was first invited to spring training by the Chicago White Sox. He died in 1984 in Fort Worth, Texas, at age 88, and was the last surviving player who played for the 1919 Chicago White Sox.

<text>Laal is an endangered language isolate spoken by 749 people () in three villages in the Moyen-Chari prefecture of Chad on opposite banks of the Chari River, 
called Gori (&quot;lá&quot;), Damtar (&quot;ɓual&quot;), and Mailao. It represents an isolated survival of an earlier language group of Central Africa. It is unwritten except in transcription by linguists. According to former Summer Institute of Linguistics-Chad member David Faris, it is in danger of extinction, with most people under 25 shifting to the locally more widespread Bagirmi.

This language first came to the attention of academic linguists in 1977 through Pascal Boyeldieu&#x27;s fieldwork in 1975 and 1978. His fieldwork was based, for the most part, on a single speaker, Djouam Kadi of Damtar.

==Speakers and status==
The language&#x27;s speakers are mainly river fishermen and farmers, who also sell salt extracted from the ashes of doum palms and &quot;Vossia cuspidata&quot;. Like their neighbours, the Niellim, they were formerly cattle herders but lost their herds around the turn of the 19th century. They are mainly Muslims, but until the latter half of the 20th century, they followed the traditional &quot;Yondo&quot; religion of the Niellim. The area is fairly undeveloped; while there are Qur&#x27;anic schools in Gori and Damtar, the nearest government school is 7 km away, and there is no medical dispensary in the region ().

The village of Damtar formerly had a distinct dialect, called Laabe (&quot;la:bé&quot;), with two or three speakers remaining in 1977; it was replaced by the dialect of Gori after two Gori families fled there at the end of the 19th century to escape a war. No other dialects of Laal are known.

Under Chadian law, Laal, like all languages of Chad other than French and Arabic, is regarded as a national language. Although the 1996 Constitution stipulates that &quot;the law shall fix the conditions of promotion and development of national languages&quot;, national languages are not used for education, for official purposes, or usually for written media, but some of the larger ones (but not Laal) are used on the radio.

==Classification==
Laal remains unclassified, although extensive Adamawa (specifically Bua) and to a lesser extent Chadic influence is found. It is sometimes grouped with one of those two language families, and sometimes seen as a language isolate. Boyeldieu (1982) summarizes his view as &quot;Its classification remains problematic; while it shows certain lexical, and no doubt morphological, traits with the Bua languages (Adamawa-13, Niger–Congo family of Joseph H. Greenberg), it differs from them radically in many ways of which some, &quot;a priori&quot;, make one think of geographically nearby Chadic languages.&quot; Roger Blench (2003), similarly, considers that &quot;its vocabulary and morphology seem to be partly drawn from Chadic (i.e. Afro-Asiatic), partly from Adamawa (i.e. Niger–Congo) and partly from an unknown source, perhaps its original phylum, a now-vanished grouping from Central Africa.&quot; It is the last possibility which attracts particular interest; if this proves true, Laal may be the only remaining window on the linguistic state of Central Africa before the expansion of the main African language families—Afro-Asiatic, Nilo-Saharan, and Niger–Congo—into it.

Their immediate neighbors speak Bua, Niellim, and Ndam. Laal contains a number of loanwords from Baguirmi, which for several centuries was the lingua franca of the region under the Baguirmi Empire, and perhaps a dozen Chadic roots, which are not similar to the Chadic languages that currently neighbor Laal. In addition, almost all Laal speak Niellim as a second language, and 20%–30% of their vocabulary is cognate with Niellim, especially agricultural vocabulary (Boyeldieu 1977, Lionnet 2010). Like the Baguirmi, the Laal are Muslims; partly because of this, some Arabic loanwords are also found. However some 60% of the vocabulary, including most core vocabulary, cannot be identified with any known language family (Lionnet 2010). Indeed, some of the words cognate with Niellim, including some basic vocabulary, is not cognate with closely related Bua, suggesting that these are not Adamawa roots but loans in Niellim from the Laal substrate (Lionnet 2010). Pozdniakov (2010) believes Laal is a distinct branch of Niger–Congo with part of its pronominal system borrowed from a Chadic language like Kera.

Laal is grouped with the Chadic languages in an automated computational analysis (ASJP 4) by Müller et al. (2013), suggesting early contact with Chadic.

==Phonology==
The sounds of Laal are transcribed here using International Phonetic Alphabet symbols.

===Consonants===
Implosives and prenasalised stops as well as /h/ are found only word-initially. Voiceless stops as well as /s/ cannot occur at the end of a syllable. occurs only intervocalically and word-finally. appears exclusively in loanwords and certain numbers. Prenasalized stops as well as the implosive are extremely rare.

===Vowels===
The vowel system for non-initial syllables is and the diphthong , with no length distinction. is heard as a glide in the vowel sequences as . For initial syllables, however, it is much more complicated, allowing length distinctions and distinguishing the following additional diphthongs: (but the latter two appear only as morphologically conditioned forms of and and so are perhaps better seen as allophonic).

In addition, may occur very occasionally; Boyeldieu quotes the example of &quot;mỳlùg&quot; &quot;red (pl.)&quot;.

There are three level tones: high (á), middle (a), low (à). Combinations may occur on a single vowel, resulting in phonetic rising and falling tone, and which are phonemically sequences of level tones. Such cases are transcribed here by repeating the vowel (e.g. àá); long vowels are indicated only by a colon (e.g. a:).

Suffixes may force any of four kinds of ablaut on the vowels of preceding words: raising (takes to ), lowering (takes to ), low rounding (takes and to ; and to ; , and to ), and high rounding (takes and to ; and to ; , and to ). They are transcribed in the suffix section as ↑, ↓, ↗, ↘ respectively. In some verbs, a/ə is &quot;raised&quot; to rather than, as expected, to .

In suffixes, ə and o undergo vowel harmony: they become and u respectively if the preceding vowel is one of {i, , u}. Likewise, r undergoes consonant harmony, becoming l after words containing l. Suffixes with a neutral tone copy the final tone of the word to which they are suffixed.

==Morphology==
===Syntax===
The typical word order can be summarised as subject–(verbal particle)–verb–object–adverb; preposition–noun; possessed–possessor; noun–adjective. Nouns can be fronted when topicalized. See the sample sentences below for examples and the conjunctions for clause syntax.

===Nouns===
Nouns have plural and singular forms (the latter are perhaps better viewed as singulative in some cases), with plural formation hard to predict: &quot;kò:g&quot; &quot;bone&quot; &gt; &quot;kuagmi&quot; &quot;bones&quot;, &quot;tuà:r&quot; &quot;chicken&quot; &gt; &quot;tò:rò&quot; &quot;chickens&quot;, &quot;ɲaw&quot; &quot;hunger&quot; &gt; &quot;ɲə̀wə́r&quot; &quot;hungers&quot;. Nouns do not have arbitrary gender, but three natural genders (male, female, non-human) are distinguished by pronouns.

The possessive is expressed in two ways:
* &quot;inalienable&quot;, or direct, possession: by following the possessed with the possessor (and modifying the tone or ending of the possessed in some cases): &quot;piá:r no&quot; &quot;person&#x27;s leg&quot; (&quot;leg person&quot;);
* alienable possession: by putting a connecting word, conjugated according to number and gender, between the possessed and the possessor:

: The connecting word is sometimes abbreviated to a simple high tone.

However, if the possessor is a pronoun, it is suffixed with extensive vowel ablaut (in the first case) or prepositional forms with &quot;at&quot; and optionally the connector as well, are used (in the second case): &quot;na:ra ɟá ɗe:&quot; &quot;my man&quot; (&quot;man CONN. at-me&quot;), &quot;mùlù&quot; &quot;her eye&quot; (&quot;eye-her&quot;, from &quot;mɨla&quot; &quot;eye&quot;). Some nouns (&quot;páw-&quot; &quot;friend&quot;) occur only with bound pronouns and have no independent form. That is called obligatory possession and is found in many other language, usually for words referring to personal relationships. See pronouns for the relevant suffixes.

A noun indicating someone who does, is, or has something can be formed with the prefix &quot;màr&quot;, meaning roughly &quot;he/she/it who/of&quot;: &quot;màr jùgòr&quot; &quot;landowner&quot;, &quot;màr ce&quot; &quot;farmer&quot; (&quot;ce&quot; = cultivate), &quot;màr pál&quot; &quot;fisherman&quot; (&quot;pál&quot; = to fish), &quot;màr pàlà ta:&quot; &quot;a fisher of fish&quot;.

Laal does show traces of an old Adamawa-type noun-class system, but apart from loans, the forms do not appear to be cognate with the Adamawa system (Lionnet 2010).

Some singular and plural nouns in Laal (Blench (2017):

===Pronouns===
====Personal====
In the following tables, note the distinction between inclusive and exclusive we, found in many other languages but not English, and the gender differentiation of &quot;I&quot; in certain forms. The inanimate plural has been dropped by most popular younger speakers in favour of the animate plural, but both are given below. The object paradigm for verbs is quite complex; only two of its several sets of allomorphs are given in the table below. &quot;He&quot; and &quot;she&quot; are used only for human referents; other nouns take the neuter pronoun. That is quite distinct from the languages with which Laal shares vocabulary, but Laal has traces of an old Adamawa-type noun-class system (Lionnet 2010). The first- and second-person plural forms are quite similar to Chadic languages (specifically, Kera) which are currently quite distant from the Laal-speaking region, but they have no similarities to Adamawa.

(The arrows indicate vowel harmony triggered in by the suffix by the root.)

====Relative and indefinite pronouns====
====Interrogative====
&quot;jé&quot; &quot;what?&quot;, &quot;ɟè&quot; &quot;who?&quot;, &quot;ɗé&quot; &quot;where?&quot;, &quot;sɨ̀g&quot; &quot;how much?&quot;.

===Prepositions===
Prepositions precede their objects: &quot;gɨ̀ pə:l&quot; &quot;in(to) the village&quot;, &quot;kɨ́ jà:ná&quot; &quot;to his body&quot; (=&quot;to near him&quot;).

===Verbs===
The verb does not vary according to the person or gender of the subject, but some verbs (about a quarter of the verbs attested) vary according to its number: &quot;no kaw&quot; &quot;the person eats&quot;, &quot;mùáŋ kɨw&quot; &quot;the people eat&quot;. The plural form of the verb is hard to predict, but is often formed by ablaut (typically raising the vowel height) with or without a suffix &quot;-i(ɲ)&quot; or &quot;-ɨɲ&quot; and tonal change. The verb, however, changes according to the direct object. It takes personal suffixes to indicate a pronominal direct object, and it commonly changes when a non-pronominal direct object is added to a transitive form with final low tone (formed similarly to the &quot;centripetal&quot;, for which see below): &quot;ʔà ná ká&quot; &quot;he will do&quot;; &quot;ʔà ná kàrà mɨ́ná&quot; &quot;he will do something&quot;; &quot;ʔà kú na:ra&quot; &quot;he sees the man&quot;; &quot;ʔà kúù:rùúŋ&quot; &quot;he sees you (pl.)&quot;.

The verb has three basic forms: simple, &quot;centripetal&quot;, and &quot;participative&quot; to calque Boyeldieu&#x27;s terminology. The simple form is used in the simple present tense or the imperative: &quot;ʔà duàg jə́w gə̀m&quot; &quot;he goes down the riverbank&quot; (lit. &quot;he descend mouth riverbank&quot;). The &quot;centripetal&quot; indicates action &quot;hither&quot;, either spatially, motion towards the speaker, or temporally, action up to the present moment; it is formed mainly by suffixing a vowel (often, but not always, identical to the last vowel in the word): &quot;ʔà duàgà jə́w gə̀m&quot; &quot;he comes down the riverbank (towards me)&quot;. The &quot;participative&quot;, generally formed like the centripetal but with final high tone, generally indicates an omitted object or instrument:
Immediately before the verb, a particle may be placed to indicate forms other than a simple present tense; such particles include &quot;ná&quot; (pl. &quot;ní&quot;) marking future tense, &quot;taá:/teé:&quot; (pl. &quot;tií:&quot;) marking continuous action, &quot;wáa:&quot; (pl. &quot;wíi:&quot;) marking motion, &quot;náa:&quot; (pl. &quot;níi:&quot;) being apparently a combination of &quot;ná&quot; and &quot;wáa:&quot;, &quot;mà&quot; (pl. &quot;mì&quot;) meaning &quot;must&quot;, &quot;mɨ́&quot; marking reported speech (apparently an evidential), &quot;mɨ́nà&quot; (pl. &quot;mínì&quot;) expressing intention, &quot;kò&quot; marking habitual action, &quot;ɓə́l&quot; or &quot;ga&quot; (pl. &quot;gi&quot;) marking incomplete action, and &quot;wó&quot; (always accompanied by &quot;ʔàle&quot; after the verb) meaning &quot;maybe&quot;.

Mediopassives (see passive voice, middle voice) can be formed from transitive verbs by adding a suffix &quot;-↑ɨ́ɲ&quot;: &quot;no siár sà:b&quot; &quot;someone ripped the cloth&quot; &gt; &quot;sà:b sérɨ́ɲ&quot; &quot;the cloth ripped&quot;. For the inverse, forming transitive verbs from intransitives, changes in tone or to the plural sometimes occur.

Verbal nouns can sometimes be formed, mainly from intransitives, by the addition of a suffix -(vowel)&quot;l&quot;, sometimes with ablaut and tone change: &quot;wal&quot; &quot;fall&quot; &gt; &quot;wàlál&quot; &quot;a fall&quot;, &quot;sùbá&quot; &quot;lie&quot; &gt; &quot;sɨ́blál&quot; (pl. &quot;súbɨ̀r&quot;) &quot;a lie&quot;. The &quot;l&quot; becomes &quot;n&quot; near a nasal and &quot;r&quot; near &quot;r&quot;: &quot;man&quot; &quot;taste good&quot;, &quot;manan&quot; &quot;a good taste&quot;.

====Adjectives====
Adjectives do not seem to constitute an independent category in Laal; to all intents and purposes, they behave just like verbs: &quot;gò: ʔì:r&quot; &quot;the goat is black&quot;. Attributively, they are typically linked as a relative clause:
===Numbers===

===Adverbs===
Adverbs generally come at the end of the clause. Here are some important adverbs:

Adverbs of location:
* &quot;here&quot;: &quot;ɗágàl, núŋú&quot;
* &quot;there&quot;: &quot;ɗaŋ&quot;
* &quot;over there, yonder&quot;: &quot;ɗàŋá&quot;

Temporal adverbs:
* &quot;day before yesterday&quot;: &quot;tá:r&quot;
* &quot;yesterday&quot;: &quot;ʔiè:n&quot;
* &quot;today&quot;: &quot;cicam&quot;, &quot;tari-màá&quot;
* &quot;recently&quot;: &quot;bèrè&quot;
* &quot;soon&quot;: &quot;sugo&quot;
* &quot;tomorrow&quot;: &quot;jìlí-kà:rì&quot;
* &quot;day after tomorrow&quot;: &quot;miàlgà&quot;

===Modals===
Here are the most important modals:

*Before the verb: &quot;mɨ́&quot; &quot;(say) that&quot;, &quot;gàná&quot; &quot;then&quot;
*After the verb: &quot;wó&quot; &quot;not&quot;, &quot;(ʔà)le&quot; &quot;maybe&quot;, &quot;ɓə́l&quot; &quot;again&quot;, &quot;ʔá&quot; or &quot;gà&quot; &quot;already&quot;, &quot;à&quot; interrogative, &quot;wá&quot; exclamatory, &quot;ta&quot; &quot;now&quot;, &quot;cám&quot; &quot;again, anew&quot;.

===Conjunctions===
Conjunctions can be divided into five types:

* only (main clause - conjunction - subordinate clause}: &quot;mɨ́&quot; &quot;(say) that&quot;, &quot;ɓə&quot; &quot;because&quot;
* either {main clause - conjunction - subordinate clause} or {conjunction - subordinate clause - main clause}: &quot;ɟò&quot; &quot;if&quot;, &quot;dànngà&quot; (possibly from Baguirmian) &quot;when&quot;
* circumposed: either {conjunction - main clause - conjunction - subordinate clause} or {conjunction - subordinate clause - conjunction - main clause}: &quot;ɟò... gàná&quot; &quot;if&quot;
* coordinate clause - conjunction - coordinate clause: &quot;ní&quot; &quot;then afterwards&quot;, &quot;ku&quot; &quot;then&quot;, &quot;kó&quot; &quot;nonetheless&quot;, &quot;á&quot; or &quot;ná&quot; &quot;and&quot;, &quot;ɓe:&quot; &quot;or&quot;, &quot;ʔàmá&quot; (from Arabic or Baguirmian) &quot;but&quot;.
* circumposed: conjunction - coordinate clause - conjunction - coordinate clause: &quot;ku... ku&quot; &quot;then&quot;, &quot;jàn... jàn&quot; &quot;both... and&quot;.

<text>Hamza Yerlikaya (born June 6, 1976, in Kadıköy, Istanbul) is a Turkish Graeco-Roman style wrestler. He is a two-time (in 1996 and 2000) Olympic champion, three-time World Champion (1993, 1995, and 2005), and the first Turkish wrestler to become European champion a record eight times, a feat that has since been matched by Rıza Kayaalp. He was ranked third in a list of all-time-best wrestlers by the International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles (FILA). 

A sports complex in Gaziosmanpaşa district of Istanbul is named after him.

==Early life==
His family was originally from Sivas, but they moved to Istanbul three months prior to Hamza&#x27;s birth. His father Mustafa Yerlikaya is also a wrestler but was no longer active by the time Hamza was born. He started wrestling aged 11 encouraged by his father and inspired by his elder brother Muttalip Yerlikaya who is also a wrestler with international success.

==International wrestling career==
Hamza Yerlikaya&#x27;s first international competition was in 1991 World Cadets Wrestling Championships in Quebec, Canada, in which he got the fourth place. His first senior international event was the 1993 European Wrestling Championships in Istanbul where he got the second place, losing to Thomas Zander in the finals. He surprised some of the spectators who thought this was a coincidence by winning the gold medal in 1993 World Wrestling Championships in Stockholm, Sweden at the age of 17, and hence becoming the youngest ever World Champion in wrestling.

As his age allowed, in some years he participated in seniors, juniors as well as cadets events. He won the World Championship again in 1995 and went on to win his first Olympic gold medal in Atlanta 1996 at the age of 20. Yerlikaya competed in every category in Greco-Roman wrestling championships both domestically and internationally thanks to his young age. He continued collecting medals, most of which were gold. Besides, he was officially working for the State Railways, which meant that he received a salary for his wrestling. Yerlikaya joined the army to fulfill his military duty in 1996, during which he attended the Atlanta Olympics in Georgia, U.S. and won the gold medal in the 82-kilogram weight category. This also meant another record since no other soldier has ever won a gold medal in a civil championship. He repeated his success four years later in Sydney 2000 and carried the flag for Turkey at the Sydney 2000 opening ceremony. Since then he has won three more World Championships (2002, 2003 and (at 96 kg) 2005). He has won the European Seniors Championship eight times (1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2005 and 2006).

He competed in 84 kg Men&#x27;s Greco-Roman Wrestling for Turkey in 2004 Summer Olympic Games in Athens, Greece and placed 4th.

Hamza Yerlikaya married Ebru Küçük in 2010, and they have two children. Yerlikaya quit wrestling in 2007 due to severe neck fractures. In the same year, he was elected as a Member of Parliament from Sivas province for the Justice and Development Party. Yerlikaya worked as a consultant in the General Director&#x27;s Office for Youth and Sports, and he was also a member of the Turkish International Olympic Committee (IOC). He managed the Turkish Wrestling Federation as chairman before resigning in 2015. He is now one of the head consultants of the Presidency of the Turkish Republic.

<text>A cocktail party is a party at which cocktails are served. It is sometimes called a cocktail reception. A cocktail party organized for purposes of social or business networking is called a mixer.

Some events, such as wedding receptions, are preceded by a cocktail hour. During the cocktail hour, guests socialize while drinking and eating appetizers. Organizers of these events use the cocktail hour to occupy guests between related events and to reduce the number of guests who arrive late.

Although it has been said that the inventor of the cocktail party was Alec Waugh of London, an article in the &quot;St. Paul Pioneer Press&quot; in May 1917 credited its invention to Mrs. Julius S. Walsh Jr. of St. Louis, Missouri. Mrs. Walsh invited 50 guests to her house on a Sunday at high noon for a one-hour affair. &quot;The party scored an instant hit,&quot; the newspaper declared, stating that within weeks cocktail parties had become &quot;a St. Louis institution&quot;.

Alec Waugh noted that the first cocktail party in England was hosted in 1924 by war artist Christopher Nevinson.

German author Walter Leonhardt advised readers to observe &quot;three fundamental rules&quot; of cocktail parties, in a 1962 book on culture and customs of England:
# It should not last long, an hour and a half maximum, the time one can stand up, even if there are chairs for weaker constitutions.
# Guests should enter and leave freely, avoiding elaborate greetings on arrival and departure.
# Conversation must avoid passionate subjects (personal, political or religious topics) to keep a harmonious and cheerful ambiance.

<text>Michael Atwater Witt (born July 20, 1960) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played 12 seasons in Major League Baseball between 1981 and 1993, and threw the 11th perfect game in MLB history in 1984.

==Early life==
Mike Witt was born in Fullerton, California, on July 20, 1960, to a family of six children. His father worked for Colgate-Palmolive and his mother was a teacher at a Catholic school. Witt started playing Little League Baseball at age 9, and at the age of 10, his oldest brother taught him how to throw the curveball, which became his primary pitch.

He played both baseball and basketball competitively for Servite High School. As a 6-ft, 7-in tall All-County basketball player, many assumed basketball would be his sport of choice, but he found baseball more enjoyable. His pitching took Servite to a 14-0 record and victory at the 1978 CIF Southern Section 4A baseball championship, and he was named the Angelus League&#x27;s Player of the Year. He was drafted out of high school in the fourth round of the 1978 Major League Baseball draft.

He was sent first to the Rookie League Idaho Falls Angels of the Pioneer League, then the Single-A Salinas Spurs in 1979. He was promoted to the El Paso Diablos in 1980, and despite having only a dozen Double-A games to his name, was invited to spring training with the California Angels for 1981.

== Professional career ==
At 20 years of age, Witt made his major league debut with the California Angels on April 11, 1981. He went 8-9 with a 3.28 ERA his rookie season, which was shortened by the Major League Baseball strike. He stumbled in his third season, finishing 7-14 with a 4.91 ERA, and was sent to play for the Tiburones de La Guaira of the Venezuelan League, where he won seven of eight decisions.

Possessing a great curveball as well as a good fastball, Witt&#x27;s breakout season came in 1984, when he went 15–11 for the Angels. On July 23 of that year, he struck out 16 Seattle Mariners during a complete game five-hitter; but the highlight of the year came on the final day of the season, September 30, when he pitched the 11th perfect game in baseball history against the Texas Rangers at Arlington Stadium. He struck out 10 and needed just 94 pitches to complete the gem. Witt&#x27;s perfect game is, as of 2020, one of five no-hitters pitched on the final day of a Major League Baseball regular season.

From 1984 to 1987, Witt led the Angels every year in wins, strikeouts, innings pitched, and complete games. His best season was 1986, when he was named team Most Valuable Player after compiling 18 wins and a 2.84 earned run average, finishing third behind Roger Clemens and Teddy Higuera for the American League Cy Young Award, and guiding the Angels to within one strike of the World Series.

In the middle of the 1987 season, however, Witt suddenly lost his overpowering stuff and saw his strikeout numbers decline significantly. He did manage to combine with starter Mark Langston to pitch a no-hitter on April 11, 1990, against Seattle, pitching the last two innings. Combined with his perfect game this makes him the only pitcher to throw a complete game no-hitter and also appear in relief for a combined no-hitter.

Witt was traded to the New York Yankees on May 11, 1990, for Dave Winfield, but suffered his first career injury on his fifth start. He was re-signed by the Yankees to an $8 million, 3-year contract, but missed most of the 1991 and 1992 seasons while recovering from Tommy John surgery, and he won no more than five games before retiring in 1993.

==Personal life==
Witt met Lisa Fenn, who worked for the Angels&#x27; group sales department, his rookie year. They wed in 1983, and have three children: daughter Kellen Marie and sons Justin and Kevin.

Witt did not pursue a coaching career in college or professional baseball as he wanted to spend time with his family. He transitioned to coaching high school, starting with Dana Hills High School in 1994. He followed his sons in 2000 to Santa Margarita Catholic High School, becoming varsity assistant and pitching coach there.

<doc id="908983" wikidata="Q132479" url="?curid=908983" title="Jorge Eliécer Gaitán">
<text>Jorge Eliécer Gaitán Ayala (23 January 1903 – 9 April 1948) was a Colombian politician with nationalist ideals and leader of the Liberal Party. He served as the mayor of Bogotá from 1936–37, the national Education Minister from 1940–41, and the Labor Minister from 1943–44. He was assassinated during his second presidential campaign in 1948, setting off the &quot;Bogotazo&quot; and leading to a violent period of political unrest in Colombian history known as &quot;La Violencia&quot; (approx. 1948 to 1958). His ideas, known as &quot;Gaitanismo&quot;, are considered a form of liberal socialism in Colombia.

==Early life and education==
Born in Bogotá to parents who were rank-and-file members of the Liberal Party, Gaitán and his family had a tenuous hold in the middle class. His birth date is given variously as 1898 and 1903. Gaitán was born in a house in Las Cruces, a neighborhood situated in the center of Bogotá, Colombia. The house has a plaque commemorating Gaitán as a legendary caudillo.

Gaitán had a humble upbringing and he was exposed to poverty growing up in a neighborhood in the center of Bogotá called Egipto. Though he lived under these circumstances, he was the son of parents with white-collar occupations. His parents were Eliécer Gaitán and Manuela Ayala de Gaitán. His father was a history teacher, sold second-hand books, and was a journalist. In reading tales about Colombian history throughout his childhood, his father garnered Gaitán&#x27;s interest in Colombian culture and politics. Manuela Ayala de Gaitán, a graduate from a teaching institute, taught her son to read and write. Her liberal and feminist tendencies ostracized her from many social environments, but she eventually taught at a school where her views were not persecuted. Gaitán&#x27;s mother held great respect to higher education and encouraged her son to pursue it. However, Gaitán&#x27;s father wanted him to work a practical job. He did not want him to pursue higher education, which became a contentious topic that strained their father-son relationship.

Gaitán entered into formal education at the age of 12. His disdain towards conventional authority began during his time at school. He was unreceptive towards strict discipline and traditional curricula. Gaitán was expelled from a school for tossing an inkwell at a teaching Christian Brother. Later in 1913, Gaitán received a scholarship to attend Colegio Araújo, a liberal school whose students were predominantly upper-class offspring of members of the Liberal Party. The school was founded by Simon Araújo who was a champion of progressive views. He provided the medium for students to receive a liberal education in a country dominantly conservative at the time. In 1918, Gaitán drafted a letter to the Colombian newspaper, &quot;El Tiempo&quot;, emphasizing the importance of higher education. He was advocating for teaching the disadvantaged populace subjects outside of traditional curricula, including topics such as hygiene. These classes were to be held at a Sunday school and provided a medium to further provide education to a wider range of people. Through his student leadership roles and intellectual ambitions, Gaitán shaped his dreams of becoming Colombian President to combat political, social, and economic inequality. Gaitán transferred from Colegio Araújo because it did not possess the necessary accreditations to ensure success in his academic and career ambitions. Gaitán graduated as one of the top students in his new school, Colegio of Martín Restrepo Mejía in 1919.

Against the wishes of his father, Gaitán enrolled in the National University in Bogotá. With a group of fellow students, he founded the University Center of Cultural Propaganda in May 1920. He drew inspiration from university students in Lima, Peru who were successful in their attempts for an educational extension program formulated for workers. As President of the University Center, Gaitán traveled throughout the city expressing the goals of the organization, focusing on social and proletariat apprehensions. Following the feminist rhetoric of his mother, Gaitán made speeches urging the uplift of the role of women in Colombian society. Moreover, he extended the Center&#x27;s work to rural workers, public school children, and education for prisoners.

==Political career==
===Early political career===
Gaitán was active in politics in the early 1920s, when he was part of a protest movement against the president Marco Fidel Suárez.

Gaitán increased his nationwide popularity following a banana workers&#x27; strike in Magdalena in 1928.

After US officials in Colombia, along with United Fruit representatives, portrayed the worker&#x27;s strike as &quot;communist&quot; with &quot;subversive tendency,&quot; in telegrams to the US Secretary of State, the US government threatened to invade with the US Marine Corps if the Colombian government did not act to protect United Fruit&#x27;s interests. Strikers were fired upon by the army on the orders of the United Fruit Company, which resulted in numerous deaths.

Gaitán used his skills as a lawyer and as an emerging politician in order to defend workers&#x27; rights and called for accountability to those involved in the Santa Marta Massacre. Public support soon shifted toward Gaitán; Gaitán&#x27;s Liberal Party won the 1930 presidential election.

In 1933, he created the &quot;Unión Nacional Izquierdista Revolucionaria&quot; (&quot;National Leftist Revolutionary Union&quot;), or UNIR, as his own dissident political movement after he had broken with the Liberal Party.

===Political discourse===
It is said that Gaitán&#x27;s main political asset was his profound and vibrant oratory, often classified as populist by contemporaries and later analysts. It attracted hundreds of thousands of union members and low-income Colombians. The writer Harry Bernstein considered that the promises that he made to the people were as important to his appeal as his impressive public speaking skills, promises that Bernstein felt made him almost a demagogue and led Bernstein to compare him with Juan Perón of Argentina.

In particular, he repeatedly divided the country into the oligarchy and the people and called the former corrupt and the latter admirable, worthy, and deserving of Colombia&#x27;s moral restoration. He stirred the audience&#x27;s emotions by aggressively denouncing social, moral and economical evils stemming both from the Liberal and Conservative Parties and promised his supporters that a better future was possible if they all worked together.
In 1946, Gaitán referred to the difference between what he called the &quot;political country&quot; and the &quot;national country&quot;. Accordingly, the &quot;political country&quot; was controlled by the interests of the oligarchy and its internal struggles and do did not properly respond to the real demands of the &quot;national country&quot; of citizens in need of better socioeconomic conditions and greater sociopolitical freedom.

He was criticized by the more orthodox sectors of the Colombian Liberal Party, which considered him too unruly, most of the Colombian Conservative Party; and the leadership of the Colombian Communist Party, which saw him as a competitor for the political affections of the masses. Gaitán was warned by US Ambassador Beaulac on 24 March 1948 that Communists were planning a disruption of the impending conference and that his Liberal Party would likely be blamed.

The subject of future land reform was also prominent in some of his speeches.

===Gaitanista Program===
The Gaitanista Program is an elaboration of Gaitán&#x27;s political, social, and economic missions for Colombia. The socialist program found in the &quot;Plataforma del Colón&quot; and &quot;Plan Gaitán&quot; detailed reforms developed in his earlier works, which include &quot;Socialist Ideas in Colombia&quot; and the &quot;Manifesto of Unirismo&quot; The aims of the program were to reform the Colombian system, which was believed to foster a political and economic monopoly for the elite in the republic. The reforms were designed to broaden the reach of state governance by incentivizing political participation among actors such as farmers, peasants, and middle and lower-class citizens. That would have been done by forming development agencies under the fundamental belief that economic democracy was nonexistent in Colombian society.

The &quot;Plataforma de Colón&quot; included various provisions designed to reduce the levels of income inequality in Colombia through fortification of the production force. This was to be achieved through national protection of Colombian industries, progressive tax reforms intended to efficiently distribute wealth, financial support for agricultural development, and nationalization of public services. In addition to these reforms, the platform extended proposals to specializing education for wider accessibility, redistributing land, enhancing labor protest laws, and heightening the legal codes of the judiciary. The foreign policy outlooks of the platform intended to inaugurate a conference to create an economic union among different nation-states in Latin America.

&quot;Plan Gaitán&quot; was a more comprehensive proposal for the creation of institutions dealing with specific issue areas. One of the major focus areas was the Colombian Central Bank. The plan strived to expand the Central Bank&#x27;s capabilities of regulating the financial market. This meant the bank needed more powerful mechanisms of controlling the private sector such as implementing a Directing council. The reforms also included the ability to grant credit, as well as act as a reserve. The plan also focused on creating the Colombian Corporation of Credit, Development, and Savings. This would be divided into three different sectors: The Institute of Credit, Institute of Development, and the Institute of Saving. The Institute of Credit was proposed to afford loans to industrial and agricultural firms. The Gaitanista program encompassed the populist ideals Gaitán advocated for during the final years of his life. His ambitions to fortify democracy and the economy of Colombia through what was seen as anti-imperialist and anti-plutocratic.

===Late political career===

After formally rejoining the Liberal Party in 1935, Gaitán was selected as mayor of Bogotá in June 1936, a position he held for eight months. During his administration, he tried to implement a number of programs in areas such as education, health, urban development and housing. His attempted reforms were cut short by political pressure groups and conflicts due to some of his policies (for example, an attempt to provide uniforms to taxi and bus service drivers). In September 1937 his daughter Gloria Gaitán was born.

Gaitán was named Minister of Education in 1940 under the administration of the Liberal Party&#x27;s Eduardo Santos (1938–1942), where he promoted an extensive literacy campaign as well as cultural activities.

At the conclusion of the Liberal Party&#x27;s national convention in 1945 he was proclaimed as &quot;the people&#x27;s candidate&quot; in a public square, an unusual setting under the political customs at the time.

The Liberal Party was defeated in the May 1946 elections by the Conservatives&#x27; Mariano Ospina Pérez (565,939 votes, president from 1946 to 1950) due to its own internal divisions, evidenced by its presenting two different candidates, Gaitán (358,957 votes) and Gabriel Turbay (441,199 votes), in that year&#x27;s race.

Gaitán became leader of the Colombian Liberal Party in 1947, when his supporters gained the upper hand in the elections for seats in Congress. This would have allowed for the Liberal Party to present a single candidate for the 1950 elections.

==Assassination and aftermath==
It is widely speculated that Gaitán would likely have been elected President had he not been assassinated on 9 April 1948. That occurred immediately prior to the armed insurrection or Bogotazo. Gaitán was then the leading opponent of the use of violence and had determined to pursue the strategy of electing a left-wing government, and he had repudiated the violent communist revolutionary approach that was typical of the Cold War era. His assassination directly led to a period of great violence between conservatives and liberals and also facilitated the rise of the existing communist guerrillas. Over the next fifteen years as many as 200,000 people died from the disorder that followed his assassination.

Gaitán&#x27;s alleged murderer, Juan Roa Sierra, was killed by an enraged mob, and his motivations were never known. Many different entities and individuals have been held responsible as the alleged plotters, including his different critics, but no definite information has ever come forward, and a number of theories persist. Among them, are versions that, sometimes conflictingly, implicate the government of Mariano Ospina Pérez, sectors of the Liberal party, the Soviet Union, the Colombian Communist Party, or the CIA. According to one version, Roa Sierra acted under the orders of CIA agents John Mepples Spirito (alias Georgio Ricco) and Tomás Elliot, as part of an anti-leftist plan that was supposedly called Operation Pantomime. It is claimed that it would also have involved the complicity of the then-Chief of Police, who would allegedly have ordered two police officers to abandon Juan Roa Sierra to be killed by the mob, a claim that conflicts with mainstream accounts of Roa Sierra&#x27;s death. An eyewitness to the actual events, Guillermo Pérez Sarmiento, Director of the United Press in Colombia, stated that upon his arrival Roa was already &quot;between two policemen&quot; and describes in detail the angry mob that kicked and &quot;tore him to pieces&quot; and does not suggest any police involvement.

Another theory states that Juan Roa simply got tired and disenchanted of lobbying Jorge Eliécer Gaitán to get a job. He had a history of job instability and considered that he could get a position worthy of his status as a reincarnation of Santander and Quesada. He had an initial conversation with Jorge Eliécer and was advised to write a letter to the President, which he did, but still did not get a job. After that, he had visited Jorge Eliécer Gaitán&#x27;s office several times in the two months prior to the assassination. The revolver was purchased two days before the assassination and the ammunition the day before. It was only on his last visit, on 9 April, when the secretary finally wrote his name to be considered by Jorge Eliécer.

Other details which have interested historians and researchers include the fact that Gaitán was murdered in the middle of the 9th Pan-American Conference, which was being led by U.S. Secretary of State George Marshall, a meeting which led to a pledge by members to fight communism in the Americas, as well as the creation of the Organization of American States.

Another event in the country&#x27;s capital Bogotá was taking place at the time: a Latin American Youth Congress, organized to protest the Pan American conference. This meeting was organized by a young Fidel Castro, and was funded by Perón. Castro had an appointment to meet Gaitán, whom he very much admired, later in the afternoon on the day of his murder, and had also met with Gaitán two days earlier. It appears that Gaitán was contemplating supporting this conference. Gaitán commanded large audiences when he spoke and was one of the most influential men in the country.

The assassination provoked a violent riot known as the &quot;Bogotazo&quot; (loose translation: the sack of Bogotá, or shaking of Bogotá), and a further ten years of violence during which at least 300,000 people died (a period known as &quot;La Violencia&quot;). Some writers say that this event influenced Castro&#x27;s views about the viability of an electoral route for political change.

Also in the city that day was another young man who would become a giant of 20th-century Latin-American history: Colombian writer and Nobel Prize Laureate Gabriel García Márquez. A young law student and short story writer at the time, García Márquez was eating lunch near the scene of the assassination. He arrived on the scene shortly after the shooting and witnessed the murder of Gaitán&#x27;s presumed assassin at the hands of enraged bystanders. García Márquez discusses this day at vivid length in the first volume of his memoirs, &quot;Living to Tell the Tale&quot;. In his book, he describes a well-dressed man who eggs on the mob before fleeing in a luxurious car that arrived just as the presumed assassin was being dragged away.

A fictionalized account of the final days of the assassin&#x27;s life and of a possible conspiracy leading up to the assassination were presented in the 2013 feature film &quot;Roa&quot;.

==Legacy==

As Gaitan could not have a proper funeral because of the chaotic public disorder, his relatives were forced to bury him in his own house, which is now known as Jorge Eliécer Gaitán House Museum, where his remains still rest. The bipartisan violence later spread to other regions during the period known as La Violencia.

A popular story, perhaps apocryphal, relates that during a debate with the Conservative candidate for president, Gaitán asked him how he made his living.
&quot;From the land,&quot; the other candidate replied.
&quot;Ah, and how did you get this land?&quot; asked Gaitán.
&quot;I inherited it from my father!&quot;
&quot;And where did he get it from?&quot;
&quot;He inherited it from his father!&quot;
The question is repeated once or twice more, and then the Conservative candidate concedes, &quot;We took it from the Natives.&quot;
Gaitán&#x27;s reply was, &quot;Well, we want to do the opposite: we want to give the land back to the Natives.&quot;

<doc id="908990" wikidata="Q435509" url="?curid=908990" title="Raymond Loewy">
<text>Raymond Loewy ( , ; November 5, 1893 – July 14, 1986) was a French-born American industrial designer who achieved fame for the magnitude of his design efforts across a variety of industries. He was recognized for this by &quot;Time&quot; magazine and featured on its cover on October 31, 1949.

He spent most of his professional career in the United States, becoming a naturalized citizen in 1938. Among his designs were the Shell, Exxon, TWA and the former BP logos, the Greyhound Scenicruiser bus interior, Coca-Cola vending machines and bottle redesign, the Lucky Strike package, Coldspot refrigerators, the Studebaker Avanti and Champion, and the Air Force One livery. He was engaged by equipment manufacturer International Harvester to overhaul its entire product line, and his team also assisted competitor Allis-Chalmers. He undertook numerous railroad designs, including the Pennsylvania Railroad GG1, S-1, and T1 locomotives, the color scheme and Eagle motif for the first streamliners of the Missouri Pacific Railroad, and a number of lesser known color scheme and car interior designs for other railroads. His career spanned seven decades.

The press referred to Loewy as &quot;The Man Who Shaped America&quot;, &quot;The Father of Streamlining&quot; and &quot;The Father of Industrial Design&quot;.

==Early life==
Loewy was born in Paris in 1893, the son of Maximilian Loewy, a Jewish journalist from Austria, and a French mother, Marie Labalme. Loewy distinguished himself early with the design of a successful model aircraft, which won the Gordon Bennett Cup for model airplanes in 1908. By the following year, he had commercial sales of the plane, named the &quot;Ayrel&quot;.

He graduated in 1910 from the University of Paris. He continued his studies in advanced engineering at Ecole Duvignau de Lanneau in Paris, but stopped his studies early to serve in World War I, eventually graduating after the war in 1918.

Loewy served in the French army during World War I (1914–1918), attaining the rank of captain. He was wounded in combat and received the Croix de guerre. After the war he moved to New York, where he arrived in September 1919.

==Career==
===Early work===

In Loewy&#x27;s early years in the United States, he lived in New York and found work as a window designer for department stores, including Macy&#x27;s, Wanamaker&#x27;s and Saks in addition to working as a fashion illustrator for &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;. In 1929, he received his first industrial-design commission to contemporize the appearance of a duplicating machine by Gestetner. Further commissions followed, including work for Westinghouse, the Hupp Motor Company (the Hupmobile styling), and styling the Coldspot refrigerator for Sears-Roebuck. It was this product that established his reputation as an industrial designer. He opened a London office in the mid-1930s that continues to operate.

===Pennsylvania Railroad===
in the early 1930s, Loewy did comprehensive design work for the Pennsylvania Railroad in providing a deeply modern Art Moderne design for the railroad&#x27;s flagship electric locomotive, the GG1. The engines would operate into the 1980s under a variety of paint schemes, some of them reflecting ownership changes, and one of them - 4935 - would be restored to its original appearance all the way down to paint colors. He designed other passenger locomotives for the firm, including a streamlined shroud for K4s Pacific #3768 to haul the newly redesigned 1938 Broadway Limited. He followed by styling the experimental S1 locomotive, as well as the T1 class. In 1940, he designed a simplified version of the streamlined shroud for another four K4s. In 1942, he designed the streamlined shroud for the experimental duplex engine Q1 which was his last work of streamlining PRR&#x27;s steam engine.

In 1946, at the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s request, he restyled Baldwin&#x27;s diesels with a distinctive &quot;sharknose&quot; reminiscent of the T1. While he did not design the famous GG1 electric locomotive, he improved its appearance with welded rather than riveted construction, and he added a pinstripe paint scheme to highlight its smooth contours.

In addition to locomotive design, Loewy&#x27;s studios provided many designs for the Pennsylvania Railroad, including stations, passenger-car interiors, and advertising materials. By 1949, Loewy employed 143 designers, architects, and draftsmen. His business partners were A. Baker Barnhart, William Snaith, and John Breen.

===Studebaker===
Loewy had a long and fruitful relationship with American car maker Studebaker. Studebaker first retained Loewy and Associates and Helen Dryden as design consultants in 1936 and in 1939 Loewy began work with the principal designer Virgil Exner. Their designs first began appearing with the late-1930s Studebakers. Loewy also designed a new logo to replace the &quot;turning wheel&quot; that had been the Studebaker trademark since 1912.

During World War II, American government restrictions on in-house design departments at Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler prevented official work on civilian automobiles. Because Loewy&#x27;s firm was independent of the fourth-largest automobile producer in America, no such restrictions applied. This permitted Studebaker to launch the first all-new postwar automobile in 1947, two years ahead of the &quot;Big Three.&quot; His team developed an advanced design featuring flush-front fenders and clean rearward lines. The Loewy staff, headed by Exner, also created the Starlight body, which featured a rear-window system that wrapped 180° around the rear seat.

In addition to the iconic bullet-nosed Studebakers of 1950 and 1951, the team created the 1953 Studebaker line, highlighted by the Starliner and Starlight coupes. (Publicly credited to Loewy, they were actually the work of Robert Bourke.)

The Starlight has consistently ranked as one of the best-designed cars of the 1950s in lists compiled since by &quot;Collectible Automobile&quot;, &quot;Car and Driver&quot;, and &quot;Motor Trend&quot;. The &#x27;53 Starliner, recognized today as &quot;one of the most beautiful cars ever made&quot;, was radical in appearance, as radical in its way as the 1934 Airflow. However, it was beset by production problems.

To brand the new line, Loewy also contemporized Studebaker&#x27;s logo again by applying the &quot;Lazy S&quot; element. His final commission of the 1950s for Studebaker was the transformation of the Starlight and Starliner coupes into the Hawk series for the 1956 model year.

In the spring of 1961, Studebaker&#x27;s new president, Sherwood Egbert, recalled Loewy to design the Avanti. Egbert hired him to help energize Studebaker&#x27;s soon-to-be-released line of 1963 passenger cars to attract younger buyers.

Despite the short 40-day schedule allowed to produce a finished design and scale model, Loewy agreed to take the job. He recruited a team consisting of experienced designers, including former Loewy employees John Ebstein; Bob Andrews; and Tom Kellogg, a young student from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. The team worked in a house leased for the purpose in Palm Springs, California. (Loewy also had a home in Palm Springs that he designed himself.) Each team member had a role. Andrews and Kellogg handled sketching, Ebstein oversaw the project, and Loewy was the creative director and offered advice.

===NASA===

Raymond Loewy worked for NASA from 1967 to 1973 as a Habitability Consultant for design of the Skylab space station, launched in 1973. One of NASA&#x27;s goals in hiring him was to improve the psychology, safety, and comfort of manned spacecraft. Due to long duration confinement in limited interior space in micro-g with almost non-existing variability in environment, the comfort and well-being of the crew through the use of aesthetics played high importance. Loewy suggested a number of improvements to the layout, such as the implementation of a wardroom, where the crew could eat and work together, the wardroom window, the dining table and the color design, among others. A key feature of Raymond Loewy&#x27;s design for the sleep compartments was that the floor plan for each of the three was different to create a sense of individual identity for each compartment. Elements of the crew quarters included sleep restraints, storage lockers, privacy partitions, lighting, a light baffle, privacy curtains, mirrors, towel holders and a communication box. The table was designed by Loewy in order to avoid creating hierarchical positions for crew members during long missions. Food was eaten using forks, knives and spoons, which were held in place on the table by magnets. Liquids were drunk from squeezable plastic containers.

===International Harvester===
The International Harvester company was a manufacturer of agricultural machinery, light and heavy duty trucks, construction equipment and appliances. In 1935 it engaged Loewy to overhaul the product line, from the company&#x27;s logo to operator ergonomics. The first new machine to reflect Loewy&#x27;s design aesthetic, a crawler tractor known as the International TD-18, was launched in 1938.

===Cockshutt===
For the 1958 model year, Loewy was engaged to style the Canadian Cockshutt Plow Company&#x27;s new line of agricultural tractors in the squared-off style that was becoming popular. The Cockshutt 540, 550, 560 and 570 models were all styled by Loewy.

===Allis-Chalmers===
Raymond Loewy&#x27;s designers influenced the design of Allis-Chalmers crawler tractors. The tractors were described as having stylish panelwork with curvaceous lines.

==Personal life, death and legacy==
Loewy&#x27;s first marriage was to Jean Thomson, which ended in divorce. Jean Thomson remained employed by the Loewy firm after the marriage ended.

In 1980, Loewy retired at the age of 87 and returned to his native France.

He died in his Monte Carlo residence on July 14, 1986. He was raised a Roman Catholic and was buried in the cemetery of a Catholic church in Rochefort-en-Yvelines, a village located 40 km south-west of Paris, where he owned a rural home named La Cense. He was survived by his wife Viola (née Erickson), and their daughter Laurence.

===Foundation===
In 1992, Viola and Laurence Loewy, with the support of British American Tobacco, established the Raymond Loewy Foundation in Hamburg, Germany. The foundation was established to preserve the memory of Raymond Loewy and promote the discipline of industrial design. An annual award of €50,000 is granted to outstanding designers, in recognition of their lifetime achievements. Notable grantees include Karl Lagerfeld, Philippe Starck and Dieter Rams.

===Design philosophy===
In 1998, Loewy&#x27;s daughter, Laurence, established Loewy Design in Atlanta, Georgia, to manage her father&#x27;s continued interests in the United States. In 2006, the Loewy Gallery opened in Roanoke, Virginia through the supportive efforts of the O. Winston Link Museum, the local business community, and art patrons Laurence Loewy, David Hagerman, and Ross Stansfield. Laurence died of natural causes October 15, 2008, and is survived by her husband David Hagerman. Hagerman is the representative for the Estate of Raymond Loewy, which remains dedicated to reintroducing Loewy&#x27;s design philosophy of MAYA, or &quot;most advanced, yet acceptable&quot;, to a new generation, through design exhibitions, publications, and documentaries. In October 2017, the documentary, &quot;Raymond Loewy: designer of American dreams&quot;, originally conceived by Laurence Loewy, premiered to Paris audiences. The film has aired on the French Arte channel.

===Google doodle===
On November 5, 2013, Loewy was honored with a Google Doodle depicting a streamlined locomotive bearing a resemblance to the shroud design of K4s Pacific #3768, using the wheels of the train to form the word &quot;Google&quot;.

<text>Thomas Adams (1730– August 1788) was a politician and businessman from Virginia. One of the Founding Fathers of the United States, he was a delegate of the Continental Congress and signed the Articles of Confederation.

==Early years==
Adams was born in New Kent County, Virginia, in about 1730, the son of Ebenezer Adams and Tabitha Cocke. His father was a native of London, England, who settled in Virginia previous to 1714 and received grants in Henrico and New Kent counties. Adams attended there the common schools.

==Career==

His first political position was as a clerk of Henrico County and vestryman of that parish, from 1757 to 1761, and later a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, and churchwarden until 1762. Adams had extensive business interests in England and resided there from 1762 to around 1774.

In 1774, he resumed his residence in Virginia before the outbreak of the American Revolution. He became chairman of the New Kent County Committee of Safety and signed the Virginia Association entered into by the House of Burgesses, on May 27, 1774. Adams was chosen as a delegate from Virginia to the Continental Congress in 1778 and 1779, and signed the Articles of Confederation.

==Later years==
In 1780, Adams moved to Augusta County, Virginia, where he was elected to the Virginia State Senate in the 9th, 10th and 11th legislatures, from 1784 to 1787. He married Elizabeth (Fauntleroy) Cocke, widow of his cousin, Bowler Cocke. Adams died on his estate, &quot;Cowpasture&quot;, in Augusta County, in August 1788. Some other sources report that he died in October 1788.

<text>1900 (, &quot;Twentieth Century&quot;) is a 1976 epic historical drama film directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, and featuring an international ensemble cast including Robert De Niro, Gérard Depardieu, Dominique Sanda, Francesca Bertini, Laura Betti, Stefania Casini, Ellen Schwiers, Sterling Hayden, Alida Valli, Romolo Valli, Stefania Sandrelli, Donald Sutherland, and Burt Lancaster. Set in Bertolucci&#x27;s ancestral region of Emilia, the film chronicles the lives and friendship of two men – the landowning Alfredo Berlinghieri (De Niro) and the peasant Olmo Dalcò (Depardieu) – as they witness and participate in the political conflicts between fascism and communism that took place in Italy in the first half of the 20th century. The film premiered out of competition at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival.

With a runtime of 317 minutes in its original version, &quot;1900&quot; is known for being one of the longest commercially released films ever made. Its great length led to its being presented in two parts when originally released in many countries, including Italy, East and West Germany, Denmark, Belgium, Norway, Sweden, Colombia, Pakistan and Japan. In other countries, such as the United States, a single edited-down version of the film was released. &quot;1900&quot; has become widely regarded as a cult classic, and has received several special edition home video releases from a variety of distributors. A restoration of the film premiered out of competition at the 74th Venice International Film Festival in 2017.

In 2008, the film was included on the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage’s 100 Italian films to be saved, a list of 100 films that &quot;have changed the collective memory of the country between 1942 and 1978.&quot;

==Plot==
In 1945, Italy is liberated from the fascists. On an estate in Emilia-Romagna, the peasants seek to join the partisans and place the owner, Alfredo Berlinghieri, under arrest. Attempting to flee, a middle-aged man named Attila and a woman named Regina face an attack by women laborers wielding pitchforks.

Alfredo and Olmo Dalcò, born in 1901, come from opposite ends of the social spectrum. Alfredo, from a wealthy landowner family, grows up with his cousin Regina, while Olmo, an illegitimate peasant, is raised by his grandfather Leo, the foreman, and peasants&#x27; spokesman. Despite their differences, Alfredo, somewhat rebellious against his family&#x27;s falseness, befriends Olmo, who is raised as a socialist. During their childhood, Leo leads strikes against unfair conditions on the farm, and the two friends spend much time together.

In 1917, Olmo enlists in the Royal Italian Army for World War I, while Alfredo learns to run the family&#x27;s plantation. After Olmo&#x27;s return, their friendship continues, but changes occur. Giovanni, Alfredo&#x27;s father and the new , hires Attila Mellanchini, a fascist foreman who treats estate employees cruelly.

In 1922, Olmo, in a relationship with Anita, leads protests for workers&#x27; rights. Giovanni&#x27;s death leads to Alfredo becoming the new &quot;padrone&quot;, marrying Ada. During the winter of 1935, Alfredo proves a weak leader, bending to the ruling National Fascist Party. Ada&#x27;s alcoholism reflects the emptiness of their marriage. Meanwhile, Olmo&#x27;s wife Anita dies in childbirth, leaving a daughter, Anita the Younger, supportive of her father&#x27;s socialist beliefs.

As Olmo becomes a leader among poor farmers, clashes with Attila intensify. Attila&#x27;s psychopathic tendencies lead to atrocities, and the peasants retaliate, humiliating him. Alfredo fires Attila, but Ada has already left him. After World War II, the power shifts, and local nobility face repercussions.

Attila and Regina, apprehended, are imprisoned in the Berlinghieri pigsty, and Attila confesses to his murders before being executed. Olmo returns to witness Alfredo&#x27;s trial before a workers&#x27; tribunal. Accused of letting workers suffer, Alfredo is sentenced to death but saved when Olmo declares the &quot;padrone&quot; dead, symbolizing the overthrow of the social system.

The new government&#x27;s representatives and soldiers arrive, urging peasants to surrender arms. Olmo convinces them, but alone with Olmo, Alfredo suggests the class system will persist. The film concludes with a scene of the elderly Alfredo and Olmo playfully tackling each other, then jumping forward to them walking along a railway track. Alfredo lies down on the tracks, mimicking a childhood game, and as a train approaches, he appears to attempt suicide. The train passes over him, reminiscent of his childhood game.

==Release==
The original director&#x27;s cut of the film runs 317 minutes (5 hours, 17 minutes) and was released in two parts in Italy. Alberto Grimaldi, the film&#x27;s producer, was contractually obligated to deliver a 195-minute (3 hour, 15 minute) version to Paramount Pictures for release in the United States and Canada. Bertolucci originally wanted to release the film in two parts, but, on Grimaldi&#x27;s refusal, 20th Century-Fox picked up distribution in the United States, dropping out only when Bertolucci declined to shorten the film by 80 minutes.

Grimaldi then locked Bertolucci out of the editing room and assembled a 180-minute cut. Bertolucci, horrified at Grimaldi&#x27;s cut, decided to compromise. His 247-minute (4 hour, 7 minute) version was the one initially released in the United States. In 1987, the Bravo channel broadcast the uncut version with English-dubbed dialogue. Later in 1991, the film was restored to its original length and shown in a limited release. The film has been shown uncut on Sky Movies and Film 4.

When Bertolucci released his 317-minute version to theaters, the Motion Picture Association of America re-classified the film with an NC-17 rating; the 245-minute American cut, the other version officially available on video in the United States, still retained its R rating. In 2006, Paramount surrendered the NC-17 rating of the uncut version, then released it as unrated on DVD on 5 December 2006. This same uncut version was released on Blu-ray Disc in the U.S. by Olive Films on 15 May 2012.

==Reception==
&quot;1900&quot; won the 1977 Bodil Award for Best Non-American Film and received 2nd place in the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Cinematography.

Paramount released the shorter version in America theatrically, and the version has received mixed reviews from American critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 50% &quot;Rotten&quot; rating based on 24 reviews, with a weighted average of 6.1/10.

In the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, film critic Roger Ebert wrote that the film &quot;doesn&#x27;t seem to go anywhere. It&#x27;s an epic only by virtue of its length.&quot;

<text>A Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO), also called a heliosynchronous orbit, is a nearly polar orbit around a planet, in which the satellite passes over any given point of the planet&#x27;s surface at the same local mean solar time. More technically, it is an orbit arranged so that it precesses through one complete revolution each year, so it always maintains the same relationship with the Sun.

== Applications ==
A Sun-synchronous orbit is useful for imaging, reconnaissance, and weather satellites, because every time that the satellite is overhead, the surface illumination angle on the planet underneath it is nearly the same. This consistent lighting is a useful characteristic for satellites that image the Earth&#x27;s surface in visible or infrared wavelengths, such as weather and spy satellites, and for other remote-sensing satellites, such as those carrying ocean and atmospheric remote-sensing instruments that require sunlight. For example, a satellite in Sun-synchronous orbit might ascend across the equator twelve times a day, each time at approximately 15:00 mean local time.

Special cases of the Sun-synchronous orbit are the noon/midnight orbit, where the local mean solar time of passage for equatorial latitudes is around noon or midnight, and the dawn/dusk orbit, where the local mean solar time of passage for equatorial latitudes is around sunrise or sunset, so that the satellite rides the terminator between day and night. Riding the terminator is useful for active radar satellites, as the satellites&#x27; solar panels can always see the Sun, without being shadowed by the Earth. It is also useful for some satellites with passive instruments that need to limit the Sun&#x27;s influence on the measurements, as it is possible to always point the instruments towards the night side of the Earth. The dawn/dusk orbit has been used for solar-observing scientific satellites such as TRACE, Hinode and PROBA-2, affording them a nearly continuous view of the Sun.

== Orbital precession ==
A Sun-synchronous orbit is achieved by having the osculating orbital plane precess (rotate) approximately one degree eastward each day with respect to the celestial sphere to keep pace with the Earth&#x27;s movement around the Sun. This precession is achieved by tuning the inclination to the altitude of the orbit (see Technical details) such that Earth&#x27;s equatorial bulge, which perturbs inclined orbits, causes the orbital plane of the spacecraft to precess with the desired rate. The plane of the orbit is not fixed in space relative to the distant stars, but rotates slowly about the Earth&#x27;s axis.

Typical Sun-synchronous orbits around Earth are about in altitude, with periods in the 96–100-minute range, and inclinations of around 98°. This is slightly retrograde compared to the direction of Earth&#x27;s rotation: 0° represents an equatorial orbit, and 90° represents a polar orbit.

Sun-synchronous orbits are possible around other oblate planets, such as Mars. A satellite orbiting a planet such as Venus that is almost spherical will need an outside push to maintain a Sun-synchronous orbit.

== Technical details ==
The angular precession per orbit for an Earth orbiting satellite is approximately given by
: formula_1 
where
: is the coefficient for the second zonal term related to the oblateness of the Earth,
: is the mean radius of the Earth,
: is the semi-latus rectum of the orbit,
: is the inclination of the orbit to the equator.

An orbit will be Sun-synchronous when the precession rate equals the mean motion of the Earth about the Sun , which is 360° per sidereal year (), so we must set , where is the Earth orbital period, while is the period of the spacecraft around the Earth.

As the orbital period of a spacecraft is
: formula_2

where is the semi-major axis of the orbit, and is the standard gravitational parameter of the planet ( for Earth); as for a circular or almost circular orbit, it follows that
: formula_3

or when is 360° per year,
: formula_4

As an example, with = , i.e., for an altitude ≈ of the spacecraft over Earth&#x27;s surface, this formula gives a Sun-synchronous inclination of 98.7°.

Note that according to this approximation equals −1 when the semi-major axis equals , which means that only lower orbits can be Sun-synchronous. The period can be in the range from 88 minutes for a very low orbit ( = , = 96°) to 3.8 hours ( = , but this orbit would be equatorial, with = 180°). A period longer than 3.8 hours may be possible by using an eccentric orbit with &lt; but &gt; .

If one wants a satellite to fly over some given spot on Earth every day at the same hour, the satellite must complete a whole number of orbits per day. Assuming a circular orbit, this comes down to between 7 and 16 orbits per day, as doing less than 7 orbits would require an altitude above the maximum for a Sun-synchronous orbit, and doing more than 16 would require an orbit inside the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere or surface. The resulting valid orbits are shown in the following table. (The table has been calculated assuming the periods given. The orbital period that should be used is actually slightly longer. For instance, a retrograde equatorial orbit that passes over the same spot after 24 hours has a true period about ≈ 1.0027 times longer than the time between overpasses. For non-equatorial orbits the factor is closer to 1.)

When one says that a Sun-synchronous orbit goes over a spot on the Earth at the same &quot;local time&quot; each time, this refers to mean solar time, not to apparent solar time. The Sun will not be in exactly the same position in the sky during the course of the year (see Equation of time and Analemma).

Sun-synchronous orbits are mostly selected for Earth observation satellites, with an altitude typically between 600 and over the Earth surface. Even if an orbit remains Sun-synchronous, however, other orbital parameters such as argument of periapsis and the orbital eccentricity evolve, due to higher-order perturbations in the Earth&#x27;s gravitational field, the pressure of sunlight, and other causes. Earth observation satellites, in particular, prefer orbits with constant altitude when passing over the same spot. Careful selection of eccentricity and location of perigee reveals specific combinations where the rate of change of perturbations are minimized, and hence the orbit is relatively stable a frozen orbit, where the motion of position of the periapsis is stable. The ERS-1, ERS-2 and Envisat of European Space Agency, as well as the MetOp spacecraft of EUMETSAT and RADARSAT-2 of the Canadian Space Agency, are all operated in such Sun-synchronous frozen orbits.

<text>Elon Reeve Musk ( ; born June 28, 1971) is a businessman known for his key roles in Tesla, Inc., SpaceX, and Twitter (which he rebranded as X). Since 2025, he has been a senior advisor to United States president Donald Trump and &quot;de facto&quot; head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk is the wealthiest person in the world; &quot;Forbes&quot; estimates his net worth to be US$353 billion. 

Born to a prominent family in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk emigrated to Canada in 1989 and acquired its citizenship though his mother. He moved to the U.S. and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania before moving to California to pursue business ventures. In 1995, Musk co-founded the software company Zip2. After its sale in 1999, he co-founded X.com, an online payment company that later merged to form PayPal, which was acquired by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion. That year, Musk also became a U.S. citizen.

In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX and became its CEO and chief engineer. The company has since led innovations in reusable rockets and commercial spaceflight. In 2004, Musk joined Tesla, Inc., as an early investor, and became its CEO and product architect in 2008; it has become a market leader in electric vehicles. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI to advance artificial intelligence research, but left its board in 2018. In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a company focused on brain–computer interfaces, and in 2017 launched the Boring Company, which aims to develop tunnel transportation. Musk was named &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Person of the Year in 2021. In 2022, he acquired Twitter, implementing significant changes and rebranding it as X in 2023. In January 2025, he was appointed head of Trump&#x27;s newly created DOGE.

Musk&#x27;s political activities and views have made him a polarizing figure. He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including COVID-19 misinformation, affirming antisemitic and transphobic comments, and promoting conspiracy theories. His acquisition of Twitter (now X) was controversial due to a subsequent increase in hate speech and the spread of misinformation on the service. He has engaged in political activities in several countries, including as a vocal and financial supporter of Trump. Musk was the largest donor in the 2024 U.S. presidential election and is a supporter of global far-right figures, causes, and political parties.

==Early life==

Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa&#x27;s administrative capital. He is of British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry. His mother, Maye (), is a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South Africa. His father, Errol Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, emerald dealer, and property developer, who partly owned a rental lodge at Timbavati Private Nature Reserve. Elon has a younger brother, Kimbal, a younger sister, Tosca, as well as four paternal half-siblings. Musk was raised in the Anglican Church, in which he was baptized.

The Musk family was wealthy during Elon&#x27;s youth. Despite both Elon and Errol previously stating that Errol was a part owner of a Zambian emerald mine, in 2023, Errol recounted that the deal he made was to receive &quot;a portion of the emeralds produced at three small mines&quot;. Errol was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that his children shared their father&#x27;s dislike of apartheid.

After his parents divorced in 1980, Elon chose to live primarily with his father. Elon later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father. Elon has recounted trips to a wilderness school that he described as a &quot;paramilitary &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;&quot; where &quot;bullying was a virtue&quot; and children were encouraged to fight over rations. In one incident, after an altercation with a fellow pupil, Elon was thrown down concrete steps and beaten severely, leading to him being hospitalized for his injuries. Elon described his father berating him after he was discharged from the hospital. Errol denied berating Elon and claimed, &quot;The boy had just lost his father to suicide and Elon had called him stupid. Elon had a tendency to call people stupid. How could I possibly blame that child?&quot;

Elon was an enthusiastic reader of books, and had attributed his success in part to having read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, the &quot;Foundation&quot; series, and &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. At age ten, he developed an interest in computing and video games, teaching himself how to program from the VIC-20 user manual. At age twelve, Elon sold his BASIC-based game &quot;Blastar&quot; to &quot;PC and Office Technology&quot; magazine for approximately $500.

===Education===

Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School, and then Pretoria Boys High School, where he graduated. Musk was a good but unexceptional student, earning a 61 in Afrikaans and a B on his senior math certification. Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother to avoid South Africa&#x27;s mandatory military service, which would have forced him to participate in the apartheid regime, as well as to ease his path to immigration to the United States. While waiting for his application to be processed, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months.

Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989, connected with a second cousin in Saskatchewan, and worked odd jobs including at a farm and a lumber mill. In 1990, he entered Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston, Ontario. Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied until 1995. Although Musk has said that he earned his degrees in 1995, the University of Pennsylvania did not award them until 1997 – a Bachelor of Arts in physics and a Bachelor of Science in economics from the university&#x27;s Wharton School. He reportedly hosted large, ticketed house parties to help pay for tuition, and wrote a business plan for an electronic book-scanning service similar to Google Books.

In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley: one at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic supercapacitors for energy storage, and another at Palo Alto–based startup Rocket Science Games. In 1995, he was accepted to a graduate program in materials science at Stanford University, but did not enroll. Musk decided to join the Internet boom, applying for a job at Netscape, to which he reportedly never received a response. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Musk lacked legal authorization to remain and work in the United States after failing to enroll at Stanford. In response, Musk said he was allowed to work at that time and that his student visa transitioned to an H1-B. According to numerous former business associates and shareholders, Musk said he was on a student visa at the time.

==Business career==
===Zip2===

In 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded web software company Zip2 with funds borrowed from Musk&#x27;s father. They housed the venture at a small rented office in Palo Alto. The company developed and marketed an Internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry, with maps, directions, and yellow pages.

According to Musk, &quot;The website was up during the day and I was coding it at night, seven days a week, all the time.&quot; The Musk brothers obtained contracts with &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Chicago Tribune,&quot; and persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with CitySearch. Musk&#x27;s attempts to become CEO were thwarted by the board. Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999, and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.

===X.com and PayPal===

In 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company. The startup was one of the first federally insured online banks, and, in its initial months of operation, over 200,000 customers joined the service. The company&#x27;s investors regarded Musk as inexperienced and replaced him with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year. The following year, X.com merged with online bank Confinity to avoid competition. Founded by Max Levchin and Peter Thiel, Confinity had its own money-transfer service, PayPal, which was more popular than X.com&#x27;s service.

Within the merged company, Musk returned as CEO. Musk&#x27;s preference for Microsoft software over Unix created a rift in the company and caused Thiel to resign. Due to resulting technological issues and lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in 2000. Under Thiel, the company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001. In 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk—the largest shareholder with 11.72% of shares—received $175.8 million. In 2017, Musk purchased the domain X.com from PayPal for an undisclosed amount, stating that it had sentimental value.

===SpaceX===
In 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars. Seeking a way to launch the greenhouse payloads into space, Musk made two unsuccessful trips to Moscow to purchase intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) from Russian companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras. Musk instead decided to start a company to build affordable rockets. With $100 million of his early fortune, Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company&#x27;s CEO and Chief Engineer.

SpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2006. Although the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA, then led by Mike Griffin. After two more failed attempts that nearly caused Musk to go bankrupt, SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008. Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion NASA contract for Falcon 9-launched Dragon spacecraft flights to the International Space Station (ISS), replacing the Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement. In 2012, the Dragon vehicle docked with the ISS, a first for a commercial spacecraft.

Working towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015 SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9 on a land platform. Later landings were achieved on autonomous spaceport drone ships, an ocean-based recovery platform. In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural mission carried Musk&#x27;s personal Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload. Since 2019, SpaceX has been developing Starship, a reusable, super heavy-lift launch vehicle intended to replace the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy. In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed flight, the Demo-2, becoming the first private company to place astronauts into orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with the ISS. In 2024, NASA awarded SpaceX an $843 million contract to deorbit the ISS at the end of its lifespan.

====Starlink====

In 2015, SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low Earth orbit satellites to provide satellite Internet access. After the launch of prototype satellites in 2018, the first large constellation was deployed in May 2019. The total cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation was estimated by SpaceX in 2020 to be $10 billion.

During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Musk provided free Starlink service to Ukraine, permitting Internet access and communication at a yearly cost to SpaceX of $400 million. However, Musk refused to block Russian state media on Starlink. In 2023, Musk denied Ukraine&#x27;s request to activate Starlink over Crimea to aid an attack against the Russian navy, citing fears of a nuclear response.

===Tesla===
Tesla, Inc., originally Tesla Motors, was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Both men played active roles in the company&#x27;s early development prior to Musk&#x27;s involvement. Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.35 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla&#x27;s board of directors as chairman. Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations. Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, and the financial crisis of 2007–2008, Eberhard was ousted from the firm. Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008. A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others. 

Tesla began delivery of the Roadster, an electric sports car, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first mass production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells. Under Musk, Tesla has since launched several well-selling electric vehicles, including the four-door sedan Model S (2012), the crossover Model X (2015), the mass-market sedan Model 3 (2017), the crossover Model Y (2020), and the pickup truck Cybertruck (2023).

In May 2020 Musk resigned from chairman of the board as part of the settlement of a lawsuit from the SEC over him tweeting that funding had been &quot;secured&quot; for potentially taking Tesla private.

The company has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle factories, called Gigafactories. Since its initial public offering in 2010, Tesla stock has risen significantly; it became the most valuable carmaker in summer 2020, and it entered the S&amp;P 500 later that year. In October 2021, it reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion, the sixth company in U.S. history to do so.

====SolarCity and Tesla Energy====
Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive founded in 2006. By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States. In 2014, Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity building an advanced production facility in Buffalo, New York, triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States. Construction of the factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture with Panasonic until early 2020.

Tesla acquired SolarCity for $2 billion in 2016 and merged it with its battery unit to create Tesla Energy. The deal&#x27;s announcement resulted in a more than 10% drop in Tesla&#x27;s stock price; at the time, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues. Multiple shareholder groups filed a lawsuit against Musk and Tesla&#x27;s directors, stating that the purchase of SolarCity was done solely to benefit Musk and came at the expense of Tesla and its shareholders. Tesla directors settled the lawsuit in January 2020, leaving Musk the sole remaining defendant. Two years later, the court ruled in Musk&#x27;s favor.

===Neuralink===
In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup, with an investment of $100 million. Neuralink aims to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence (AI) by creating devices that are embedded in the brain. Such technology could enhance memory or allow the devices to communicate with software. The company also hopes to develop devices to treat neurological conditions like spinal cord injuries. In 2022, Neuralink announced that clinical trials would begin by the end of the year. In September 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved Neuralink to initiate six-year human trials.

Neuralink has conducted animal testing on macaques at the University of California, Davis. In 2021, the company released a video in which a macaque played the video game &quot;Pong&quot; via a Neuralink implant. The company&#x27;s animal trials—which have caused the deaths of some monkeys—have led to claims of animal cruelty. The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine has alleged that Neuralink violated the Animal Welfare Act. Employees have complained that pressure from Musk to accelerate development has led to botched experiments and unnecessary animal deaths. In 2022, a federal probe was launched into possible animal welfare violations by Neuralink.

===The Boring Company===
In 2017, Musk founded the Boring Company to construct tunnels, and revealed plans for specialized, underground, high-occupancy vehicles that could travel up to and thus circumvent above-ground traffic in major cities. Early in 2017, the company began discussions with regulatory bodies and initiated construction of a wide, long, and deep &quot;test trench&quot; on the premises of SpaceX&#x27;s offices, as that required no permits. The Los Angeles tunnel, less than in length, debuted to journalists in 2018. It used Tesla Model Xs and was reported to be a rough ride while traveling at suboptimal speeds. Two tunnel projects announced in 2018, in Chicago and West Los Angeles, have been canceled. However, a tunnel beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center was completed in early 2021. Local officials have approved further expansions of the tunnel system.

=== X Corp. ===
In early 2017, Musk expressed interest in buying Twitter and had questioned the platform&#x27;s commitment to freedom of speech. By 2022, Musk had reached 9.2% stake in the company, making him the largest shareholder. Musk later agreed to a deal that would appoint him to Twitter&#x27;s board of directors and prohibit him from acquiring more than 14.9% of the company. Days later, Musk made a $43 billion offer to buy Twitter. By the end of April Musk had successfully concluded his bid for approximately $44 billion. This included approximately $12.5 billion in loans and $21 billion in equity financing. Having back tracked on his initial decision, Musk bought the company on October 27, 2022.

Immediately after the acquisition, Musk fired several top Twitter executives including CEO Parag Agrawal; Musk became the CEO instead. Under Elon Musk, Twitter instituted monthly subscription for a &quot;blue check&quot;, and laid off a significant portion of the company&#x27;s staff. Musk lessened content moderation and hate speech also increased on the platform after his takeover. In late 2022, Musk released internal documents relating to Twitter&#x27;s moderation of Hunter Biden&#x27;s laptop controversy in the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election. Musk also promised to step down as CEO after a Twitter poll, and five months later, Musk stepped down from chief executive officer (CEO) and transitioned his role to executive chairman and chief technology officer (CTO).

Despite Musk stepping down as CEO, X continues to struggle with challenges such as viral misinformation, hate speech, and antisemitism controversies. Musk has been accused of trying to silence some of his critics by removing their accounts&#x27; blue checkmarks, which hinders visibility and is considered a form of shadow banning, or suspending their accounts without justification.

==Other activities==
=== Hyperloop ===

In August 2013, Musk announced plans for a version of a vactrain, and assigned engineers from SpaceX and Tesla to design a transport system between Greater Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area, at an estimated cost of $6 billion. Later that year, Musk unveiled the concept, dubbed the Hyperloop, intended to make travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances.

=== OpenAI and xAI ===
In December 2015, Musk co-founded OpenAI, a not-for-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research company aiming to develop artificial general intelligence, intended to be safe and beneficial to humanity. Musk pledged $1 billion of funding to the company, but only donated $50 million. In 2018, Musk left the OpenAI board. Since 2018, OpenAI has made significant advances in machine learning. In July 2023, Musk launched the artificial intelligence company xAI, which aims to develop a generative AI program that competes with existing offerings like OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT. Musk obtained funding from investors in SpaceX and Tesla, and xAI hired engineers from Google and OpenAI.

=== Private jet ===


Musk uses a private jet owned by Falcon Landing LLC, a SpaceX-linked company, and acquired a second jet in August 2020. His heavy use of the jets and the consequent fossil fuel usage have received criticism. Musk&#x27;s flight usage is tracked on social media through ElonJet. In December 2022, Musk banned the ElonJet account on Twitter, as well as temporary bans on the accounts of journalists that posted stories regarding the incident, including Donie O&#x27;Sullivan, Keith Olbermann, and journalists from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, CNN, and &quot;The Intercept.&quot;

== Politics ==
Musk is an outlier among executives who typically avoid partisan political advocacy. Musk was a registered independent voter when he lived in California. Historically, he has donated to both Democrats and Republicans, many of whom serve in states in which he has a vested interest. Beginning in 2022, his political contributions have mostly supported Republicans, with his first vote for a Republican going to Representative Mayra Flores in the 2022 Texas&#x27;s 34th congressional district special election. In 2024, he started supporting international far-right political parties, activists, and causes, and has shared far-right misinformation and numerous conspiracy theories. his views were generally described as right-wing.

Musk supported Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, Hillary Clinton in 2016, Joe Biden in 2020, and Donald Trump in 2024. In the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Musk endorsed candidate Andrew Yang and expressed support for Yang&#x27;s proposed universal basic income, and endorsed Kanye West&#x27;s 2020 presidential campaign. In 2021, Musk publicly expressed opposition to the Build Back Better Act, a $3.5 trillion legislative package endorsed by Joe Biden that ultimately failed to pass due to unanimous opposition from congressional Republicans and several Democrats. In 2022, Musk said he would start supporting Republican Party candidates, and gave over $50 million to Citizens for Sanity, a conservative political action committee. In 2023, he supported Republican Ron DeSantis for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, giving $10 million to his campaign, and hosted DeSantis&#x27;s campaign announcement on a Twitter Spaces event. From June 2023 to January 2024, Musk hosted a bipartisan set of X Spaces with Republican and Democratic candidates, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Vivek Ramaswamy, and Dean Phillips.
By early 2024, Musk had become a vocal and financial supporter of Donald Trump. In July 2024, after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, Musk endorsed him for president. During the presidential campaign, Musk joined Trump on stage at a campaign rally, and during the campaign promoted conspiracy theories and falsehoods about Democrats, election fraud and immigration, in support of Trump. Musk was the largest individual donor of the 2024 election.

Musk&#x27;s international political actions and comments have come under increasing scrutiny and criticism, especially from the governments and leaders of France, Germany, Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom, due to his position in the U.S. government.

=== Trump&#x27;s inauguration ===
In his speech during the second inauguration of Donald Trump, Musk thumped his right hand over his heart, fingers spread wide, and then extended his right arm out, emphatically, at an upward angle, palm down and fingers together. He then repeated the gesture to the crowd behind him. As he finished the gestures, he said to the crowd, &quot;My heart goes out to you. It is thanks to you that the future of civilization is assured.&quot; The gesture was viewed as a Nazi or Roman salute by some. Musk derided the claims as politicized. In a social media post, he wrote: &quot;The &#x27;everyone is Hitler&#x27; attack is sooo tired&quot;, but did not explicitly deny the claims. He has since denied it. In further response to the events, Musk posted a series of puns about Nazis on Twitter. Various media outlets, including the Associated Press, reported that regardless of what Musk meant, his gesture was widely embraced by right-wing extremists and neo-Nazis.

=== Department of Government Efficiency ===
The concept of DOGE emerged in a discussion between Musk and Donald Trump, and in August 2024, Trump committed to giving Musk an advisory role, with Musk accepting the offer. In November and December 2024, Musk suggested that the organization could help to cut the U.S. federal budget, consolidate the number of federal agencies, and eliminate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and that its final stage would be &quot;deleting itself&quot;.

In January 2025, the organization was created by executive order, and Musk was designated a &quot;special government employee&quot;. Musk is leading the organization and is a senior advisor to the president, although his official role is not clear. In sworn statement during a lawsuit, the director of the White House Office of Administration stated that Musk &quot;is not an employee of the U.S. DOGE Service or U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization&quot;, &quot;is not the U.S. DOGE Service administrator&quot;, and has &quot;no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself&quot;. Trump said two days later that he had put Musk in charge of DOGE.

In February 2025, Musk was criticized for his treatment of federal government employees, including his influence over the mass layoffs of the federal workforce, and his instruction to federal government employees to report their prior week&#x27;s work, with non-responses being deemed a resignation or warranting termination. He has prioritized secrecy within the organization and has accused others of violating privacy laws.

==Views==

Rejecting the conservative label, Musk has described himself as a political moderate, and his views have become more right-wing over time. His views have been characterized as libertarian and far-right, and after his involvement in European politics, they have received criticism from some world leaders.

Within the context of American politics, Musk supported Democratic candidates up until 2022, at which point he voted for a Republican for the first time. He has stated support for universal basic income, gun rights, freedom of speech, a tax on carbon emissions, and H-1B visas. Musk has expressed concern about issues such as artificial intelligence (AI) and climate change, and has been a critic of wealth tax, short-selling, government subsidies, and Wikipedia. An immigrant himself, Musk has been accused of being anti-immigration, and regularly blames immigration policies for illegal immigration. He is also a pronatalist who believes population decline is the biggest threat to civilization, and believes in the principles of Christianity.

Musk has promoted conspiracy theories, and made controversial statements that have led to accusations of sexism, antisemitism, transphobia, disseminating disinformation, and support of white pride. While describing himself as a &quot;pro-Semite&quot;, his comments regarding George Soros and Jewish communities have been condemned by the Anti-Defamation League and the White House. Isaacson&#x27;s biography of Musk argued that some of his far-right views were &quot;partially triggered&quot; by the transition of his daughter, Vivian Jenna Wilson. Musk was criticized during the COVID-19 pandemic for making unfounded epidemiological claims, defied COVID-19 lockdowns restrictions, and supported the Canada convoy protest against vaccine mandates.

=== International relations ===

Musk has been critical of Israel&#x27;s actions in the Gaza Strip during the Israel–Hamas war, praised China&#x27;s economic and climate goals, suggested that Taiwan and China should resolve cross-strait relations, and was described as having a close relationship with the Chinese government.

In Europe, Musk expressed support for Ukraine in 2022 during the Russian invasion, recommended referendums and peace deals on the annexed Russia-occupied territories, and supported the far-right Alternative for Germany in Germany in 2024. Regarding British politics, Musk blamed the 2024 UK riots on mass migration and open borders, criticized Prime Minister Starmer for what he described as a &quot;two-tier&quot; policing system, and was subsequently attacked as being responsible for spreading misinformation and amplifying the far-right. He has also voiced his support for far-right activist Tommy Robinson and pledged electoral support for Reform UK.

== Legal affairs ==

In 2018, Musk was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a tweet stating that funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private. The securities fraud lawsuit characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO of publicly traded companies. Two days later, Musk settled with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC&#x27;s allegations. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was forced to step down for three years as Tesla chairman but was able to remain as CEO. Shareholders filed a lawsuit over the tweet, and in February 2023, a jury found Musk and Tesla not liable. Musk has stated in interviews that he does not regret posting the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation.

In 2019, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half a million cars that year. The SEC reacted by asking a court to hold him in contempt for violating the terms of the 2018 settlement agreement. A joint agreement between Musk and the SEC eventually clarified the previous agreement details, including a list of topics about which Musk needed preclearance. In 2020, a judge blocked a lawsuit that claimed a tweet by Musk regarding Tesla stock price (&quot;too high imo&quot;) violated the agreement. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)-released records showed that the SEC concluded Musk had subsequently violated the agreement twice by tweeting regarding &quot;Tesla&#x27;s solar roof production volumes and its stock price&quot;.

In October 2023, the SEC sued Musk over his refusal to testify a third time in an investigation into whether he violated federal law by purchasing Twitter stock in 2022. In February 2024, Judge Laurel Beeler ruled that Musk must testify again. In January 2025, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Musk for securities violations related to his purchase of Twitter. In January 2024, Delaware Judge Kathaleen McCormick ruled in a 2018 lawsuit that Musk&#x27;s $55 billion pay package from Tesla be rescinded. McCormick called the compensation granted by the company&#x27;s board &quot;an unfathomable sum&quot; that was unfair to shareholders.

==Personal life==
Musk became a U.S. citizen in 2002. From the early 2000s until late 2020, Musk resided in California, where both Tesla and SpaceX were founded. He then relocated to Cameron County, Texas, saying that California had become &quot;complacent&quot; about its economic success.

While hosting &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 2021, Musk stated that he has Asperger syndrome (now merged with autism spectrum disorder), although he has not been medically diagnosed. Musk suffers from back pain and has undergone several spine-related surgeries, including a disc replacement. In 2000, he contracted a severe case of malaria while on vacation in South Africa. Musk has stated he uses doctor-prescribed ketamine for occasional depression and that he doses &quot;a small amount once every other week or something like that&quot;; since January 2024, some media outlets have reported that he takes ketamine, LSD, ecstasy, mushrooms, cocaine and other drugs. Musk at first refused to comment his alleged drug use, then Musk responded, that he had not tested positive for drugs, and if drugs somehow improved his productivity, ‘I would definitely take them!’.

Through his own label Emo G Records, Musk released a rap track, &quot;RIP Harambe&quot;, on SoundCloud in March 2019. The following year, he released an EDM track, &quot;Don&#x27;t Doubt Ur Vibe&quot;, featuring his own lyrics and vocals. Musk plays video games, which he stated has a &quot;&#x27;restoring effect&#x27; that helps his &#x27;mental calibration&#x27;&quot;, including &quot;Quake&quot;, &quot;Diablo IV&quot;, &quot;Elden Ring&quot;, and &quot;Polytopia&quot;, and has admitted to &quot;account boosting&quot;, or cheating by hiring outside services to achieve top player rankings.

===Relationships and children===
Musk has fathered thirteen children, one of whom died as an infant. He had six children with his first wife, Canadian author Justine Wilson, who he met while attending Queen&#x27;s University in Ontario, Canada; they married in 2000. In 2002, their first child Nevada Musk died of sudden infant death syndrome at the age of 10 weeks. After his death, the couple used in vitro fertilization (IVF) to continue their family; they had twins in 2004, followed by triplets in 2006. The couple divorced in 2008 and have shared custody of their children. The elder twin he had with Wilson came out as a trans woman and, in 2022, officially changed her name to Vivian Jenna Wilson, adopting her mother&#x27;s surname because she no longer wished to be associated with Musk.

Musk began dating English actress Talulah Riley in 2008. They married two years later at Dornoch Cathedral in Scotland. In 2012, the couple divorced, before remarrying the following year. After briefly filing for divorce in 2014, Musk finalized a second divorce from Riley in 2016. Musk then dated Amber Heard for several months in 2017; he had reportedly been &quot;pursuing&quot; her since 2012.

In 2018, Musk and Canadian musician Grimes confirmed they were dating. Grimes and Musk have three children, born in 2020, 2021, and 2023. Musk and Grimes originally gave their eldest child the name &quot;X Æ A-12&quot;, which would have violated California regulations as it contained characters that are not in the modern English alphabet; the names registered on the birth certificate are &quot;X&quot; as a first name, &quot;Æ A-Xii&quot; as a middle name, and &quot;Musk&quot; as a last name. They received criticism for choosing a name perceived to be impractical and difficult to pronounce; Musk has said the intended pronunciation is &quot;X Ash A Twelve&quot;. Their second child was born via surrogacy. Despite the pregnancy, Musk confirmed reports that the couple were &quot;semi-separated&quot; in September 2021; in an interview with &quot;Time&quot; in December 2021, he said he was single. In October 2023, Grimes sued Musk over parental rights and custody of X Æ A-Xii.

Musk also has four children with Shivon Zilis, director of operations and special projects at Neuralink: twins born via IVF in 2021, a child born in 2024 via surrogacy and a child born in 2025.

==Wealth==
===Musk Foundation===

Musk is president of the Musk Foundation he founded in 2001, whose stated purpose is to provide solar-power energy systems in disaster areas, with an interest in human space exploration, pediatrics, renewable energy, and &quot;safe artificial intelligence&quot;. From 2002 to 2018, the foundation donated nearly half of its $25 million directly to Musk&#x27;s OpenAI. The foundation&#x27;s assets reached $9.4 billion by the end of 2021, but it only dispensed $160 million to charities that year. 

The Musk Foundation has been criticized for its &quot;self-serving&quot; donations to efforts close to Musk&#x27;s family and companies, as well as its low payout ratio. In 2021, after Musk challenged World Food Programme director David Beasley to draft a plan to use money of Musk&#x27;s that Beasley said could contribute to ending world hunger, Musk instead donated the $6 billion in question to his own foundation even after Beasley&#x27;s plan showed that the money could feed 42 million people for a year.

== Public image ==
Although his ventures have been highly influential within their separate industries starting in the 2000s, Musk only became a public figure in the early 2010s. He has been described as an eccentric who makes spontaneous and impactful decisions, while also often making controversial statements, contrary to other billionaires who prefer reclusiveness to protect their businesses. Musk&#x27;s actions and his expressed views have made him a polarizing figure. Biographer Ashlee Vance described people&#x27;s opinions of Musk as polarized due to his &quot;part philosopher, part troll&quot; persona on Twitter. During a 2025 Conservative Political Action Conference, Musk, while wearing a gold chain, sunglasses, and holding a chainsaw, stated: &quot;I am become meme&quot;.

Musk has been described as an American oligarch due to his extensive influence over public discourse, social media, industry, politics, and government policy. His influence in the second presidency of Donald Trump led some to call him the &quot;actual president-elect&quot;, &quot;shadow president&quot; or &quot;co-president&quot;.

===Accolades===
Awards for his contributions to the development of the Falcon rockets include the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics George Low Transportation Award in 2008, the Gold Space Medal in 2010, and the Royal Aeronautical Society Gold Medal in 2012. In 2015, he received an honorary doctorate in engineering and technology from Yale University and an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Honorary Membership. Musk was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018. In 2022, Musk was elected to the National Academy of Engineering.

&quot;Time&quot; has listed Musk as one of the most influential people in the world in 2010, 2013, 2018, and 2021. Musk was selected as &quot;Time&quot;″s &quot;Person of the Year&quot; for 2021. Then &quot;Time&quot; editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal wrote that, &quot;Person of the Year is a marker of influence, and few individuals have had more influence than Musk on life on Earth, and potentially life off Earth too.&quot;

===In popular culture===

Musk was a partial inspiration for the characterization of Tony Stark in the Marvel film &quot;Iron Man&quot; (2008). Musk also had a cameo appearance in the film&#x27;s 2010 sequel, &quot;Iron Man 2&quot;. Other films that he has made cameos and appearances include &quot;Machete Kills&quot; (2013), &quot;Why Him?&quot; (2016), and &quot;Men in Black: International&quot; (2019). Television series in which he has appeared include &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (&quot;The Musk Who Fell to Earth&quot;, 2015), &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; (&quot;The Platonic Permutation&quot;, 2015), &quot;South Park&quot; (&quot;Members Only&quot;, 2016), &quot;Young Sheldon&quot; (&quot;A Patch, a Modem, and a Zantac®&quot;, 2017), &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; (&quot;One Crew over the Crewcoo&#x27;s Morty&quot;, 2019). He contributed interviews to the documentaries &quot;Racing Extinction&quot; (2015) and &quot;Lo and Behold&quot; (2016).

A king doesn&#x27;t have advertisers or shareholders or customers, and Musk, if he continues on his current trajectory, may very well be abandoned by all three. Aristotle says a good ending should be surprising but inevitable. It&#x27;s possible to imagine multiple finales for Musk that meet these criteria, but the story always begins the same way. Once upon a time in Pretoria, there was a boy who wanted to be a man.&quot; (p. 10.)

<doc id="909044" wikidata="Q8038529" url="?curid=909044" title="Writing armchair">
<text>The writing armchair has an antique and a modern form.
In its antique form it is known as a writing armchair in the United States and as a tablet armchair in the United Kingdom. It is more often than not a Windsor style armchair with a circular or oval pad or tablet replacing the right arm or mounted above it. Many versions have a drawer built under the pad, to hold writing implements. Other versions have such a drawer under the seat.

On some versions the pad is on a hinge, in order to fold it down and facilitate storage, or simply take up less space in a room. In this case it is often called a drop leaf chair, and becomes a close cousin to the mechanical desk.

In its modern form it is, most of the time, the most compact rendition of a school desk or a student desk, and it is manufactured in metal and plastic. It is available in a wide variety of sizes to suit the changing needs of growing children. It also differs from the antique form by being relatively ambidextrous: The tablet or pad is available for the right arm or the left arm, to also suit those who write with their left hand. Unlike the antique form, the arm with no pad is usually completely absent, to ease entry in the chair in the crowded conditions of a schoolroom or lecture hall.

Modern designers have offered several contemporary renditions of the writing armchair or the drop leaf chair, but the form has never been very popular in homes.

<text>Perforce Jam was an open-source build system developed by Christopher Seiwald of Perforce Software. It was used as a replacement for make. Its primary feature was its ability to express build patterns in an imperative language which supported structured namespaces (similar to Pascal records) and simple lists. Jam could be used with autoconf, although it was often not necessary because of Jam&#x27;s portability features. Perforce Jam ran on Unix (including many clones), OpenVMS, Windows NT (including Windows 2000 and Windows XP), Mac OS, and BeOS. It was also possible to configure it to work on Windows 9x using MinGW or Cygwin.

The company announced that version 2.6 released in August 2014 was the last Perforce Jam release.

== Popular variants of Jam ==
=== FT Jam ===

FT Jam is a popular variant maintained by The FreeType Project and is fully backward compatible, although its features are being integrated into Perforce Jam. Users of FT Jam often refer to Perforce Jam as &quot;Classic Jam&quot;.

=== Boost.Jam ===

The Boost C++ Libraries is using a Jam variant called &quot;Boost.Jam&quot; (or &quot;BJam&quot;). It is incompatible with other variants, and is not a standalone tool, but part of Boost.Build.

=== Haiku Jam ===

Haiku Jam is a custom fork of Perforce&#x27;s Jam used by Haiku.

=== JamPlus ===

JamPlus adds new features to Jam and integrates a number of patches from the Jamming mailing list and the Perforce Public Depot.

== Jambase ==
Jam comes with a set of rules called &quot;Jambase&quot;, which define rules for building various things. Jambase is &quot;smart&quot; and knows, for instance, that if a header file is modified, all files that include it must be rebuilt. Unlike with makefiles, the writer of the Jamfile need not manage these dependencies, only list the source code files themselves. Jambase is usually compiled into the executable file itself.

Jambase is notorious among Jam users for its bugs and the infrequency with which fixes are integrated into the distribution, though few bugs are critical. There are some packages such as AutoJam designed to solve some of the problems of Jambase.

<doc id="909111" wikidata="Q276255" url="?curid=909111" title="European Union Aviation Safety Agency">
<text>The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is an agency of the European Commission with responsibility for civil aviation safety in the European Union. It carries out certification, regulation and standardisation and also performs investigation and monitoring. It collects and analyses safety data, drafts and advises on safety legislation and co-ordinates with similar organisations in other parts of the world.

The idea of a European-level aviation safety authority goes back to 1996, but the agency was legally established only in 2002; it began its work in 2003.

==History==
Based in Cologne, Germany, the agency was created on 15 July 2002 as the &quot;European Aviation Safety Agency&quot;, and reached full functionality in 2008, taking over functions of the Joint Aviation Authorities. It was renamed the &quot;European Union Aviation Safety Agency&quot; in 2018. European Free Trade Association countries participate in the agency. The United Kingdom was a member until the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December 2020.

The responsibilities of the agency include the analysis and research of safety parameters, authorizing foreign operators, and advising the European Commission on the drafting of EU legislation. It also implements and monitors safety rules (including inspections in the member states), gives type certification of aircraft and components, and approves organisations involved in the design, manufacture and maintenance of aeronautical products.

As part of Single European Sky II (SES-II), an initiative to standardize and coordinate all air traffic control over the EU, the agency has been given additional tasks, which were implemented before 2013. Since 4 December 2012, EASA is able to certify functional airspace blocks if more than three parties are involved.

The EU commission is proposing to further expand EASA mandate to act the European Performance Review Board, with a clear separation of National Supervisory Agencies and Air Navigation Service Providers

In 2012, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) found that the agency did not have an agency-specific conflict of interest policy and procedures. EASA did not obtain or assess the declarations of interest for staff, management board, board of appeal and experts. In its report, ECA declared that:

It was recommended that the organization adopt its own ethical standards because the then-existing condition exposed the agency to a substantial crisis of credibility as well as the incidence of favoritism and conflict of interest. For member-countries and other stakeholders, fairness is of paramount importance. This is because the European Union has been increasingly strengthening EASA&#x27;s role, giving the agency independence. A discussion regarding the permission for the agency to impose financial penalties for safety violations is also underway.

==Responsibilities==
EASA is responsible for new type certificates and other design-related airworthiness approvals for aircraft, engines, propellers and parts. EASA works with the EU member states&#x27; civil aviation authorities (CAAs) but has taken over many of their functions in the interest of aviation standardisation across the EU and in the non-EU member Turkey. EASA is also responsible for assisting the European Commission in negotiating international harmonisation agreements with the &quot;rest of the world&quot; on behalf of the EU member states, and it concludes technical agreements at a working level directly with its counterparts around the world such as the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). EASA also sets policy for aeronautical repair stations (Part 145 organisations in Europe and the US, also known as Part 571 organisations in Canada) and issues repair station certificates for repair stations located outside the EU, which permit foreign repair stations to perform work that is acceptable to the EU on its aircraft). EASA has developed regulations for air operations, flight crew licensing and non-EU aircraft used in the EU, which applied since the required European legislation to expand the agency&#x27;s remit entered into force. The legislation was published on 19 March 2008.

EASA has had its scope enlarged, as part of the new delegation in 2018, to also cover UAVs. The first 2 regulations (EU DR 2019-945 &amp; EU IR 947) for drones were effective by 30 December 2019 in order for them to also cover the UK (Brexit).

===Annual safety review===
The agency publishes an annual safety review with statistics on European and worldwide civil aviation safety. Some information derives from the International Civil Aviation Organization and the NLR Air Transport Safety Institute.

In June 2020, EASA banned Pakistan International Airlines from flying to Europe after a fatal crash in May caused by pilot error. An investigation discovered that one third of pilot licenses in Pakistan are fraudulent.

==States subject to EASA services and oversight==
As an EU agency, the EASA is &quot;not&quot; a membership organization. All states which are a member of the EU also take part in EASA&#x27;s services and are subject to oversight by EASA. It is not possible to opt out of the arrangement without withdrawing from the EU.

Those European countries which are not members of the EU but members of EFTA, namely Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, and Iceland, have been granted participation to the arrangement under Article 129 of the Basic Regulation (Regulation 2018/1139). These states are members of the management board, but do not have voting rights. While the legal basis is different for states which are members of the EU and those who are not, the EASA has the same power for all states who participate in the arrangement. 

There are also working relationships with other regional and international authorities. For example, EASA cooperates with most of the EU&#x27;s Eastern Partnership member states through EASA&#x27;s Pan-European Partners (PANEP) initiative in which countries such as Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine co-operate on the implementation of EU aviation safety rules and comprehensive aviation agreements.

=== Former EASA Member-States ===
Prior to the UK&#x27;s withdrawal from the EU, the UK Civil Aviation Authority was an EASA member-state.

==Certification==
On 28 September 2003, the agency took over responsibility for the airworthiness and environmental certification of all aeronautical products, parts, and appliances designed, manufactured, maintained or used by persons under the regulatory oversight of EU Member States.

Certain categories of aeroplanes are however deliberately left outside EASA responsibility, thus remaining under control of the national CAAs: ultralights, experimentals, and balloons are a few examples. They are referred to as &quot;Annex I&quot; aeroplanes (formerly known as &quot;Annex II&quot; aeroplanes), and are listed on the EASA website.

In July 2017, EASA and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore entered into a working arrangement to recognize each other&#x27;s certifications.

===Aircraft classification===
The agency defines several classes of aircraft, each with their own ruleset for certification and maintenance and repair. EASA established safety levels according to a risk hierarchy. For non-commercial operations, a set of rules were developed to achieve safety goals. EASA difference non-commercial operations between non-commercial operations other than complex aircraft (NCO) and non-commercial operations with complex motor-powered aircraft.

EASA has started to introduce basic regulations for unmanned aircraft (drones) which are divided between open category (no operational approval is required), specific category (requires risk-based operational authorization), and certified category, where pilots needs a license and operators receive a certificate.

<text>The women&#x27;s 100 metre [[freestyle swimming|freestyle]] event at the 2004 Olympic Games was contested at the Olympic Aquatic Centre of the Athens Olympic Sports Complex in Athens, Greece on August 18 and 19.

Australia&#x27;s Jodie Henry edged out defending Olympic champion Inge de Bruijn to take the gold medal in this event, by thirty-two hundredths of a second (0.32), outside the record time of 53.84 seconds. U.S. swimmer Natalie Coughlin, who previously claimed the title in the 100 m backstroke, earned the bronze at 54.40 seconds. In the semifinals, Henry captured fourteen hundredths of a second (0.14) off her teammate Lisbeth Lenton&#x27;s world record (set five months earlier in Sydney), with a time of 53.52. This was also the final appearance for de Bruijn at the Olympics, before she retired from her swimming career in 2007.

==Records==
Prior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.

The following new world and Olympic records were set during this competition.

<doc id="909132" wikidata="Q2586628" url="?curid=909132" title="Pieris oleracea">
<text>Pieris oleracea, or more commonly known as the mustard white, is a butterfly in the family Pieridae native to a large part of Canada and the northeastern United States. The nearly all-white butterfly is often found in wooded areas or open plains. There are two seasonal forms, which make it distinct from other similar species. Because of climate change, populations are moving further north.

As indicated by the common name, &quot;P. oleracea&quot; adults and larvae primarily feed on plants in the mustard family, &quot;Brassicaceae&quot;. The species is threatened by the rapid, and monoculture-forming, spread of the invasive species &quot;Alliaria petiolata&quot;, which is toxic to larvae. Populations of &quot;P. oleracea&quot; have been declining. It may be that this butterfly is slowly adapting to garlic mustard. However, it may not be a fast enough process to ensure its survival, due to the high level of aggression on the part of the plant and the continuing encroachment of human development.

Its specific name &quot;oleracea&quot; means &quot;related to vegetables/herbs&quot; in Latin and is a form of ().

== Description ==

=== Larvae ===
&quot;Pieris oleracea&quot; larvae are yellow and shaped like cones, with vertical ridges. Larvae that are mature have many black spots with a green body, dark dorsal stripe, and short, dense hairs. The pupae can range in color from brown to white to green, and have dorsal and apical projections.

=== Adults ===
There are two seasonal forms of the butterfly, one for spring and one for summer. Above the wings, the butterfly is entirely white, which a small patch of black scales at the tips of the wings. A feature that differentiates this species from other similar species is the green or yellow markings on the underside of the hind wings that run along the veins. In the spring, the green markings are very apparent, and can be seen from the top side of the wing. In the summer, the wing appears almost entirely white, as the markings on the underside of the wing and the black tips are fainter.
== Range ==
This species is mainly found throughout Canada and parts of the northeastern United States. They are often found with other very similar species in specific areas. Their range stretches across Canada starting from Newfoundland to Alberta and other Northwestern Territories. However, they are only found in the foothill regions of Alberta. In British Columbia, populations are found in north and central regions. In Nunavut, they are specifically found near the coast at Coppermine and Arviat. In the Cypress Hills of Saskatchewan, there is a single population that has been found. As for the United States, they are found in the New England states and Great Lakes area.

== Habitat ==
These butterflies are found in prairies, near streams, and in moist deciduous areas. In the spring, they are found more readily in the moist areas, either the woodlands or open fields.

&quot;Pieris oleracea&quot; is a biovoltine species, meaning it tends to have two broods seasonally. The time in which they fly can depend on the area the inhabit. Usually, the butterflies migrate once in June, and once again in late July. However, in southern Ontario, there can be three to four generations, and farther up north it has been observed where there is only one generation.

== Social behavior ==
Because of changing climate conditions, broods are expanding farther north.

There has been a steady decline in the populations of &quot;P. oleracea,&quot; which is being attributed to either climate change, the expansion of the toxic garlic mustard plant, human development, or, most likely, a combination of these factors.

During the day, males observe the population to look for females to mate with. 
== Host-plants ==
The larvae feed on various types of Brassicaceae, which can also be referred to as mustard plants. The most common of these types are Cardamines and Boechera, sometimes commonly known as bittercress and rockcress respectively. Adult butterflies will eat the nectar from these same plants.

There are certain mustard plants that are toxic to the butterflies. &quot;Alliaria petiolata&quot;, more commonly known as garlic mustard, is an example. Because this species is closely related to host mustards of &quot;P. oleracea&quot;, it is very similar to their commonly eaten plants, so these butterflies often feed on the toxic species. The native hosts of &quot;P. oleracea&quot; contain glucosinolates that are similar to those found in &quot;A. petiolate&quot;, which is why females are attracted to them. However, this specific species is toxic to larvae and causes death. Previous studies have shown that specifically in 1st and 4th instar larvae, several chemicals in &quot;A. petiolata&quot; reduce chances of survival because the larvae end up consuming less.

Some recent, short-term studies have shown that &quot;P. oleracea&quot; may be beginning to evolve to use &quot;A. petiolata&quot; as a host plant. &quot;A. petiolate&quot; is an extremely invasive species in much of the United States and is becoming increasingly common in areas with &quot;P. oleracea&quot; populations. The slow nature of this potential evolution (preliminarily estimated to be as high as 100 generations for it to possibly be occurring), coupled with the dominance of &quot;Alliaria petiolata&quot; as an invasive species, where it often creates dense herb layer monocultures on the forest floor, at forest edges, along streams, and in other habitats — and the smallness of the populations of &quot;P. oleracea&quot;, make passively waiting for this adaption to save the species questionable, particularly in light of the repeated blockage of biological control weevil species by the USDA&#x27;s TAG group, despite multiple petitions from scientists for approval of even the monophagous weevil &quot;C. scrobicollis&quot;. Researchers have said that the univoltine nature of &quot;Pieris virginiensis&quot;, coupled with its rarity, makes &quot;A. petiolata&quot; potentially an even greater threat to its survival, due to a reduced ability to adapt.

== Local adaptation ==
The existence of the toxic &quot;A. petiolata&quot; is detrimental to the species, introduced into the United States in the 19th century. It is unclear to what degree it will remain a threat to the survival of this butterfly over time, due to potential adaption. This species of mustard plant contains the oviposition stimulant sinigrin. Females of this species react very strongly to sinigrin, especially when compared to similar species like &quot;P. rapae&quot; and &quot;P. virginiensis&quot;. In similar Pieridae species, sinigrin was found to negatively impact larval survival by affecting a pathway that transforms harmful substances into harmless ones.

With the increasing abundance of &quot;A. petiolata&quot;, there is concern about the potential adaption rate to what appears to be an incompatible, yet attractive to females, host plant. Studies were done in areas with and without garlic mustard, looking at female selection and larval survival success. One group of females were in an area where garlic mustard was widely established, and the other group was in an area where it was just recently introduced. Despite the fact that garlic mustard is non-native, females in the group with widespread garlic mustard showed an oviposition preference for it. The larvae in this group on the mustard plants had reduced survival rates than those on their normal native hosts. Females in the group with the newly introduced garlic mustard had a wide range in their selection of host plants, and the larval survival rates were also higher in general. Garlic mustard, however, creates monocultures due to its extreme success as an invasive species in the United States, where it lacks over seventy predators that occur in its native areas. This reduces food plant choice by pushing out the native mustards. When comparing the success rates of larvae on the garlic mustard between the two groups, the first group had higher survival success rates than the group with the newly introduced garlic mustard. The increasing selection of using &quot;A. petiolata&quot; may show an attempt by &quot;P. oleracea&quot; to adapt to this invasive species but the adaption may be too slow to compensate for the monoculture formation of the plant and the reduction of its host plants from human encroachment such as land development.

== Enemies ==

=== Alliaria petiolata ===
&quot;Alliaria petiolata&quot; is a toxic invasive species that is causing decreased survival in larval populations. Even though sinigrin is an oviposition stimulant for adult females, it has shown to be detrimental to larvae because it delays growth. Sinigrin is not found in normal host plants, and even though butterflies of the Pierid family have a detoxification system to remove the toxic chemical, it is not effective when large amounts are consumed.

Alliarinoside, a compound only found in &quot;A. petiolata&quot;, is also threat to the larvae. Although the exact mechanism is unknown, it has been shown that alliarinoside is responsible for lower survival rates of larvae. Another threat to larval growth is the cyanide produced by &quot;A. petiolata&quot;.

=== &quot;Pieris rapae&quot; ===

Another potential enemy of &quot;P. oleracea&quot; is a member of its own genus, &quot;Pieris rapae.&quot; After introduction of this species in an area in New England populated by &quot;P. oleracea&quot;, the native populations were entirely wiped out. In many cases this appears to be because of competition for foraging sites. However, there has been a case observed where the two species were able to coexist successfully.

== Genetics ==
DNA barcode data of &quot;Pieris oleracea&quot; is available through the BOLD systems database and GenBank. The sequence cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 region, the typical region for DNA barcoding, was used and the FASTA file is available.

== Sympatry ==
A specific case of sympatry between &quot;P.&quot; &quot;oleracea&quot; and &quot;P. rapae&quot; was seen in Vermont. Even though the populations had approximately the same territory, each species was able to find a specific niche in the food source or habitat that the other could not use. &quot;P.&quot; &quot;oleracea&quot; larvae primarily used &quot;Dentaria diphylla&quot; during the spring, whereas &quot;P. rapae&quot; used &quot;Barbaea vulgaris&quot; in the spring. As for mating, there was no observed interference between the two species. Even though adults were in the same areas, there was no conflict.

<text>Axel Cäsar Springer (2 May 1912 – 22 September 1985) was a German publisher and founder of what is now Axel Springer SE, the largest media publishing firm in Europe. By the early 1960s his print titles dominated the West German daily press market. His &quot;Bild Zeitung&quot; became the nation&#x27;s tabloid.

In the late 1960s, Springer entered into confrontation with the emergent New Left. Hostile coverage of student protests and a continuing rightward drift in editorial comment were met with boycotts and printing-press blockades, and later in 1972 with the bombing of the company offices by the Red Army Faction (the &quot;Baader Meinhof Gang&quot;).

In the late 1970s, exposés of journalistic malpractice by the investigative reporter Günter Wallraff led to Press Council reprimands. Sometimes referred to as Germany&#x27;s Rupert Murdoch, Springer, with counter suits and minor divestments, was able to ride out public criticism of his editorial ethics and market dominance.

Springer engaged in private diplomacy in Moscow in 1958 and, with greater recognition, in Jerusalem in 1966 and 1967. In addition to promotion and defence of the values of the &quot;Western family of nations&quot; and NATO, Springer declared &quot;reconciliation of Jews and Germans and support for the vital rights of the State of Israel&quot; to be a &quot;leitmotif&quot; of his company&#x27;s journalism.

== Career under the Hitler regime ==
Axel Caesar Springer was born 2 May 1912 in Altona, a borough of Hamburg, the son of Ottilie (née Müller) and Hinrich Springer. The senior Springer owned a small printing and publishing firm, Hammerich &amp; Lesser-Verla, and was the treasurer of the centrist or centre-left German Democratic Party (Deutsche Demokratische Partei).

After being apprenticed as a compositor he worked on his father’s paper, &quot;Altonaer Nachrichten.&quot; Following Hitler&#x27;s assumption of untrammeled power in 1933, new press ordinances made Springer directly accountable to the Ministry of Propaganda, although as editor of the sports and business pages he may have remained relatively free of Nazi-party dictation. After paper shortages shut the daily in 1941, he stayed with the firm printing literary works until Allied air raids in 1944 destroyed both the business premises and the family home.

Notwithstanding its vilification by the Nazis, Springer was a jazz enthusiast. He played with the possibility of a career in music. His model was the Austrian tenor Richard Tauber, a star of both film and operatic stage who, having a Jewish parent, was also deprecated by the regime.

In 1933, Springer married Martha Else Meyer, whose father (like Tauber&#x27;s) was Jewish. They divorced in 1938. While the divorce papers list Springer&#x27;s infidelity as grounds (he would have five wives over the course of his 73 years), by 1938 it was clear that his marriage to a person classified, under the new race laws, as a &quot;half-Jew&quot;, a &quot;Mischling&quot;, would bar him as an editor and publisher. Springer would later support both Meyer and her mother, who survived the Theresienstadt Ghetto. Springer later commented: &quot;I cannot say I didn&#x27;t know what was happening. In 1933 I stood on the Kurfürstendamm in Berlin and watched Nazi Storm Troopers beating up old Jews. I was a young man, and I couldn&#x27;t do anything about it. But I never forgot it&quot;.

In 1934, Springer joined the National Socialist Motorist Corps (&quot;Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrkorps&quot;, NSKK). He later claimed that this was to secure &quot;a Nazi-uniformed buffer&quot; for his family &quot;in an organization that did not make any major ideological commitments and that allowed politics to be combined with the motorsport that I loved so much.” Other NSKK members who would go on to occupy prominent positions in the post-war Federal Republic offered similar careerist explanations, among them Springer&#x27;s future rival in publishing Franz Burda, Franz Josef Strauss who was to lead Bavaria&#x27;s ruling Christian Social Union, and (a purportedly inactive party member) Kurt Georg Kiesinger, West Germany&#x27;s third Chancellor. Contrary to their picture of a relatively &quot;apolitical&quot; motorist club, the NSKK was a paramilitary organisation, implicated in the regime&#x27;s racist policy of exclusion and discrimination (it screened its members for Aryan traits) and in the anti-semitic pogroms of 1938.

== German press lord ==
=== From &quot;Hörzu&quot; to &quot;Bild&quot; and &quot;Die Welt&quot; ===

After the war, in 1946, Springer founded his own publishing company, &quot;Axel Springer GmbH&quot;, in Hamburg publishing the radio (and later TV) listings magazine &quot;Hörzu&quot;. Never having worn a uniform (thanks to asthma and diabetes) or been a member of the Nazi party (from which, by virtue of his marriage to Martha Meyer, he would have been excluded), Springer was able to obtain from the British occupation authorities a license to run a newspaper. His first daily was the &quot;Hamburger Abendblatt&quot;. Competing in Hamburg with the five other dailies, Springer offered a paper he described as &quot;geared to the underdog and the little man&quot;, and perfected a formula he launched on the national market in 1952 with &quot;Bild Zeitung&quot;.

Fed a tabloid mix of sensation, scandal, celebrity, sports and horoscopes, the &quot;Bild&quot; readership peaked in the mid-1960s at 4.5 million. It had the largest circulation of any newspaper in Western Europe or North America. &quot;Bild&quot; allowed Springer the luxury of his 1953 acquisition, the national broadsheet &quot;Die Welt&quot;, a loss maker but a rival to the newspapers of record, and the &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot;.

In 1956, Springer secured a 26% share in Berlin&#x27;s prestigious Ullstein publishing house, which in 1952 had been restored to the Jewish family who had originally owned it. He became the majority shareholder at the end of 1959 acquiring, among other titles, the &quot;Berliner Morgenpost&quot;. Springer celebrated Ullstein as having been, in the Weimar years, the symbol of a Jewish-German liberal-democratic tradition, but at the same time his critics were to note, in line with &quot;Die Welt&quot; and &quot;Bild&quot;, a decisive rightward shift in editorial policy.

=== Zehrer and the approach to Moscow ===
Springer&#x27;s choice as chief editor for &quot;Die Welt&quot; was controversial. Hans Zehrer was a veteran of the Kapp Putsch of 1920, and in the last Weimar years had been the editor of the nationalist and anti-republican journal &quot;Die Tat&quot;. In 1946, he had been removed from the then British-controlled &quot;Die Welt&quot; after protests from Britain&#x27;s Labour government and from the Social Democrats then governing Hamburg.

At &quot;Die Welt&quot; Springer allowed Zehrer to entertain the idea of an Austrian solution for Germany. In 1955, Austria had regained its unity and independence through a four-power agreement guaranteeing the country&#x27;s non-alignment and neutrality. In January 1958, Springer travelled with Zehrer to Moscow. Before departing he told to a reporter: &quot;I know very well that there are people who consider me naïve. But I believe in reunification within five years.&quot; In addition to permanent German neutrality, Springer was proposing a nuclear-free Central Europe.

Nikita Khrushchev kept Springer and Zehrer waiting sixteen days for an interview. It did not go well, and cannot have been helped by Springer seeking to convince the Soviet premier of the advantages not only of German neutrality but also of West Germany&#x27;s social market economy. The Russians, like the Americans, viewed their strategic position in Germany as indispensable. Neutrality was not an option. Springer was to describe the trip as the &quot;central political event of my life&quot;, convincing him that there was no alternative to Konrad Adenauer&#x27;s &quot;Westbindung&quot;: to discount Communist overtures and to persevere with the North Atlantic alliance. On his return he forbad any criticism of the western allies, whether it was of the British in Cyprus, the French in Algeria, or the Americans in the Taiwan Strait, because &quot;we need them in Berlin&quot;.

== Alleged American funding ==
There are questions as to how, in the lean post-war years, Springer was able to finance so large and rapid an expansion. He operated without partners; even after currency reform in 1948, for a relative upstart bank credit would have been difficult to come by; and his first stock for public subscription was not issued until months before his death in 1985.

There were rumours that Springer, in the early post war years, was the beneficiary of covert U.S. efforts to shape and direct public opinion in Germany. According to the American investigative journalist Murray Waas &quot;highly reliable sources in the U.S. intelligence community&quot; testified to the figure of &quot;some $7 million&quot; funnelled through the CIA to Springer in the early 1950s. The case appears otherwise circumstantial, based on Springer&#x27;s editorial support of U.S. foreign policy . There was no mistaking Springer&#x27;s anti-communism (he favoured Social Democrat Kurt Schumacher&#x27;s description of communists as &quot;rotlackierte Nazis&quot;, red-painted Nazis). But given his dalliance with neutralism, his fixed alignment with American &quot;geopolitical interests&quot; can be dated only from his return from Moscow in 1958.

It is possible that CIA funding is confused with support from the Government and Relief in Occupied Areas (GARIOA) programme (wound up in October 1950) which &quot;Die Zeit&quot;, among other pro-democratic, pro-Allied publishing efforts, are known to have benefitted. Springer always maintained that his financial springboard was &quot;Hörzu&quot; which, attuned to the new radio and television age, was ground breaking and had no market rival.

== The Spiegel affair ==

On 26 October 1962, the Hamburg offices of &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; were raided and closed by police. The publisher, Rudolf Augstein, along with the weekly&#x27;s two editors-in-chief and a reporter were arrested. Defence minister Franz Josef Strauss levelled accusations of treason (&quot;Landesverrat&quot;) in respect to an article detailing NATO projections of &quot;unimaginable chaos&quot; in the event of a Soviet nuclear strike and criticising the government&#x27;s lack of preparedness. In a statement he was later obliged to recant, Strauss denied that he had initiated the police action.

Although Augstein was a liberal critic, Springer offered his presses, teletypes and office space so &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; could keep on publishing. It was, however, at the cost of further access to &quot;Die Welt&quot; that columnist Sebastian Haffner took to the &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot; to pronounce on the violation of press freedom and constitutional norms.

Adenauer appears to have been sufficiently convinced of Springer&#x27;s political reliability, that when in October 1963 he resigned as chancellor, he suggested (perhaps playfully) to &quot;Bild&quot; Editor-in-Chief Peter Boenisch that the publisher might be the &quot;politician&quot; best fitted to continue his policies.

== Criticism and confrontation ==
=== The SDS Anti-Springer campaign ===
The Spiegel affair ignited youth protest and brought the &quot;Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund&quot; (SDS), the German Socialist Student Union, onto the streets. Swift to denounce those who questioned the equity and social costs of the West German &quot;Wirtschaftswunder&quot; (&quot;economic miracle&quot;), Springer characterised the &quot;extra-parliamentary opposition&quot; as subversive.

In June 1967 an open letter from a large group of writers (among them Ingeborg Drewitz, Hans Magnus Enzensberger and Günter Grass), accused the Springer Press of &quot;incitement&quot; in a police riot in West Berlin that saw the death of student protester Benno Ohnesorg. Rallied by Ulrike Meinhof&#x27;s journal &quot;konkret&quot;, students had been protesting a visit by the Shah of Iran. Bild&#x27;s response (3 June 1967) to the death was to declare that where &quot;Students threaten: We shoot back&quot; and &quot;This is where fun and compromise and democratic tolerance end. We have to take a stand against SA methods&quot;. Protesters broke windows at Springer offices and tried to disrupt printing and delivery, but the trade unions kept their distance from the anti-Springer campaign, and the SDS, increasingly focussed on the War in Vietnam, conceded that the protests had failed to &quot;mobilise the masses&quot;. After a month it called a halt.

When on 11 April 1968, the SDS leader Rudi Dutschke (who had called for the expropriation of Springer&#x27;s press empire) was shot on the street in West Berlin by the young right-wing extremist Josef Bachmann, the cry again was that &quot;Bild&quot; was complicit (&quot;Bild schoss mit!&quot;). Serious unrest followed . Demonstrators tried to storm the Springer house in Berlin and set fire to &quot;Bild&quot; delivery vans. The Hamburg print shop was besieged to prevent the paper leaving the presses, and in Munich a demonstrator and a policeman were killed after students ransacked the &quot;Bild&quot; editorial offices. There were over a thousand arrests. &quot;A tendentious headline in &quot;Bild&quot;&quot;, the protesters claimed, &quot;is more violence than a stone against the head of a policeman&quot;.

Helmut Schmidt, then parliamentary leader of the Social Democrats, sought to intervene with Springer. Schmidt conceded that the publisher&#x27;s success was related to new journalistic methods and formats that catered to public tastes, but charged Springer with using that position of preeminence to mix &quot;news and suggestive commentary&quot;. He might have &quot;fewer problems&quot; if he restructured his publishing house on the model of private foundations or public media institutions. In the event, when finally Springer consented to meet with Schmidt in August 1968, their discussion was of the Czechoslovak crisis (Schmidt assuring Springer that it was &quot;impossible&quot; that the Soviets would repeat the events of Budapest 1956 and crush the Prague Spring with tanks).

On 19 May 1972, the Red Army Faction (the &quot;Baader Meinhof Gang&quot;) bombed Springer&#x27;s Hamburg offices, injuring 17 employees, two of them seriously. Springer critics regretted the escalation, but accepted the thesis of &quot;The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum, or: How violence develops and where it can lead&quot;, Heinrich Böll&#x27;s 1974 novel in which violence is framed and driven by a demagogic and unscrupulous tabloid press. &quot;No one&quot;, Haffner argued in liberal weekly &quot;Stern&quot;, &quot;has planted the seeds of violence more keenly than Springer journalism&quot;.

=== Investigations ===
Springer declared that no government minister need tell him &quot;what the people think&quot;. Critics, however, focussed less on his supposedly canny sense for the public, than on his press capacity to shape opinion. It was said that Federal ministers began each day by &quot;combing &quot;Die Welt&quot; for signs of whether Springer was smiling of frowning on them.&quot; If only in its headline, the front page of &quot;Bild&quot; was also seen as &quot;agenda setting&quot;.

In 1968, a government commission concluded that the degree of control Springer had achieved over the publishing industry in West Germany (40% of newspapers and about 20% of magazines) threatened the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of the press. But official steps towards decartelisation were successfully pre-empted by Springer&#x27;s sale of a half dozen of his lesser titles. A critical test of his ability to manage and deflect concern over media concentration might have come only with the introduction of commercial television, and that was delayed in West Germany until 1984, the year before he died. (Willi Brandt recalls that his &quot;friendly relations&quot; with Axel Springer first suffered in the early 1960s when, as governing mayor of West Berlin, he had declined Springer&#x27;s request to help him open the Federal Republic to commercial television by licensing a local broadcaster).

A more serious embarrassment for Springer were the investigations of journalist Günter Wallraff. In 1977, his employment, undercover, as an editor for &quot;Bild&quot; led to exposés, (&quot;Der Aufmacher&quot; – a pun meaning both &quot;Lead Story&quot; and &quot;the one who opens&quot; – and &quot;Zeugen der Anklage&quot;, &quot;Witnesses for the Prosecution&quot;) of the kinds of journalistic malpractices and unethical research methods Böll had depicted in his novel (directed in 1975 as a film by Volker Schlöndorff and Margarethe von Trotta). Wallraff (denounced by Springer as a &quot;liar&quot;, a &quot;psychopath&quot; and an &quot;underground communist&quot;) noted that &quot;Bild regularly broke into the private, even intimate sphere of the people it was reporting about&quot;, and he claimed to have seen suicide notes written by people who had their lives publicly scandalised by the paper.

The German Press Council issued &quot;Bild&quot; six reprimands. After extended legal action brought by Springer, a Federal court in 1981 ruled in favour of Mr. Wallraff. It said his writings had focused on &quot;an aberration in journalism, the discussion of which should be of great interest to the public.&quot; Injunctions nonetheless prevented publication of some of the most damning material. Un-redacted copies of Wallraff original reporting were not published until 2012.

== Opposition to Brandt and Ostpolitik ==
Springer maintained a position, not itself welcome on the conservative right, that Germans had themselves to blame for their country&#x27;s division: &quot;What Germany did under Hitler was terrible, and we were destined to suffer for it&quot;. But noting that &quot;the people in the other part of Germany were no more guilty than those of us over here&quot;, he insisted that they deserved &quot;same kind of chance&quot; at rehabilitation that democratic and market freedoms had allowed their compatriots in the west. On that basis, he refused any recognition that might &quot;normalise&quot; the East German SED regime. When the Wall went up in Berlin in 1961, Springer built his 22-storey headquarters flush up against it in the centre of the city, so that every day it might look over, and be seen from, what his writers regularly referred to as the Soviet Occupation Zone (German: &quot;Sowjetische Besatzungszone&quot; or &quot;SBZ&quot;). While dissenters, such as Sebastian Haffner concluded that there was now no alternative to formal recognition, Springer was unyielding. He condemned the accommodationist Ostpolitik pursued from 1969 by Brandt.

Springer&#x27;s hostility to the SED regime was reciprocated. Over the course of two years from 1968 to 1970, GDR state television aired a lavishly-produced 10-hour miniseries, &quot;Ich – Axel Cäsar Springer&quot;, depicting the media magnate as the puppet of a secretive, post-war Nazi cabal. At the same time, the East Germans were so impressed by the seeming power of &quot;Bild&quot; that between 1957 and 1973 they attempted, with different tabloid formats, to sell their own their &quot;NEUE Bild Zeitung&quot; to West Germans crossing the border.

Springer&#x27;s efforts, which his writers may have understood as a general means of discrediting the Social Democrats, were unavailing. Blue-collar workers who formed the core of Bild&#x27;s now declining readership (down 800,000 by 1972) voted for Brandt regardless. Significantly Springer, who had always cited the &quot;poll&quot; at the newspaper and magazine kiosk (&quot;Abstimmung am Kiosk&quot;) as the ultimate justification for his journalism, no matter how controversial, proved willing to adjust. He moved, or parted company with, those in his employ who had been attacking Brandt from ever more extreme right-wing positions. Among these were, Peter Boenisch, chief editor at &quot;Bild&quot;; and &quot;Welt am Sonntag&quot; columnist Willi Schlamm (a former Austrian Communist and an American John Bircher). Once it was clear that the Christian Democrats would not reverse course on recognition, &quot;Bild&quot; did begin, albeit in quotation marks, to refer to East Germany as the GDR (the German Democratic Republic).

From August 1971 Günter Prinz, Boenisch&#x27;s successor at &quot;Bild,&quot; restored the paper&#x27;s circulation by returning to a less politically charged &quot;mix of sex, facts und fiction&quot;.

=== Brandt&#x27;s &quot;Kniefall von Warschau&quot; ===

Springer&#x27;s son, Axel Springer Jr. (1941–1980), was the photographer and journalist &quot;Sven Simon&quot;, and was for a period chief editor of &quot;Welt am Sonntag&quot;. In 1980, at the age of 38, he took his own life. He is perhaps best remembered for his iconic picture of Willi Brandt kneeling on 7 December 1970 before the memorial to Ghetto Uprising in Warsaw.

The occasion of Brandt&#x27;s visit to Poland was the signing of the Treaty of Warsaw between West Germany and Poland. This recognised the Oder-Neisse Line as Germany&#x27;s final frontier in the east and, on that basis, established diplomatic relations between the Federal Republic and the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland. Writing himself in &quot;Die Welt&quot;, Springer expressed outrage that a democratically elected German government should license a Communist regime in its annexation of a quarter of the country. In &quot;Bild,&quot; Boenisch remarked that, while Brandt attempted &quot;kneel away&quot; the crimes of the Nazis, the victims of his Stalinist hosts were being made to kneel by rifle butts to the groin.

== Friend of Israel ==
Springer&#x27;s journalism did not explore the history of the Nazi-era in the manner of &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; or &quot;Stern&quot;. Bild editor-in-chief Rudolf Michael (1952–58) was against &quot;educating the readers&quot;. Nevertheless, under Karl-Heinz Hagen (1960–62) the newspaper began, sensationally as was its wont, to report on trials of Nazi war criminals, including in 1961 the Jerusalem trial of Adolf Eichmann. This was at a time when surveys suggested that only every second West German supported the prosecutions; that a third wished an end to the discussion of the Hitler regime; and that 73% regarded Jews as &quot;a different race&quot;.

Next to post-war Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, it has been said that &quot;no German played a more significant role in the effort to repair his country&#x27;s burdened relationship with the Jews, and to ensure its support for their state, than Axel Springer.&quot; It was a cause to which, as early as 1957, he dedicated his newspapers editorially and to which he made his own personal contributions.

As had Adenauer in the wake of his 1952 Reparations Agreement, Springer found that in Israel &quot;German money&quot; was not universally welcome. During his first visit to Israel in 1966, Springer proposed a donation of 3.6 million Deutsche Mark ($900,000) to The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, which would name an auditorium in his honor. Protesters took to the streets, and the Israeli newspaper &quot;LaMerhav&quot; declared that for the museum to accept money from a German would be a &quot;disavowal of Jewish memory&quot;. (It was ultimately decided that Springer&#x27;s generosity should be honored by a plaque).

Springer returned to Jerusalem on 10 June 1967, to celebrate, in the company of Viennese-born mayor Teddy Kollek, the conquest of the Old City in the Six-Day War. He had ordered his newspapers to cover the war obsessively and with an unapologetically pro-Israel bias, later joking that he had simply published Israeli newspapers in German. &quot;The Israelis&quot;, he commented on the front page of &quot;Bild&quot;, &quot;have the right to live in peace without permanent new Arab blackmails.&quot;

Support for Israel is a commitment of their founder that Axel Springer SE sustains. It remains enshrined in the company&#x27;s mission statement.

== Honors ==

Springer received honorary degrees from Bar-Ilan University in Ramat Gan (1974), and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (1976). In 1977 he received the American Friendship Medal.

In 1978, he was awarded the inaugural Leo Baeck Medal. In 1985, he received the gold medal of the Jewish service organisation B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith.

In 1981, Franz Josef Strauss presented Springer the Konrad Adenauer Freedom Prize in recognition of his contribution to the foundation of a liberal press system, his commitment to the reunification of Germany in peace and freedom, and his exemplary activity in support of reconciliation between German and Jewish people.

== Death ==
Springer died in West Berlin in 1985. His heiress is his fifth (and last) wife Friede Springer (born 1942) who, 30 years Springer&#x27;s junior, had been his son&#x27;s nanny.

In 1971, Springer published a collection of his speeches and essays: &quot;Von Berlin aus gesehen. Zeugnisse eines engagierten Deutschen&quot; (Seewald Verlag, Hamburg).

<doc id="909143" wikidata="Q933216" url="?curid=909143" title="Tax competition">
<text>Tax competition, a form of regulatory competition, exists when governments use reductions in fiscal burdens to encourage the inflow of productive resources or to discourage the exodus of those resources. Often, this means a governmental strategy of attracting foreign direct investment, foreign indirect investment (financial investment), and high value human resources by minimizing the overall taxation level and/or special tax preferences, creating a comparative advantage.

Scholars generally consider economic development incentives to be inefficient, economically costly, and distortionary.

==History==
From the mid-1900s governments had more freedom in setting their taxes, as the barriers to free movement of capital and people were high. The gradual process of globalization is lowering these barriers and results in rising capital flows and greater manpower mobility.

==Impact==
According to a 2020 study, tax competition &quot;primarily reduces taxes for mobile firms and is unlikely to substantially affect the efficiency of business location.&quot; A 2020 NBER paper found some evidence that state and local business tax incentives in the United States led to employment gains but no evidence that the incentives increased broader economic growth at the state and local level.

==Examples==

=== European Union ===
The European Union (EU) also illustrates the role of tax competition. The barriers to free movement of capital and people were reduced close to nonexistence. Some countries (e.g. Republic of Ireland) utilized their low levels of corporate tax to attract large amounts of foreign investment while paying for the necessary infrastructure (roads, telecommunication) from EU funds. The net contributors (like Germany) strongly oppose the idea of infrastructure transfers to low tax countries. Net contributors have not complained, however, about recipient nations such as Greece and Portugal, which have kept taxes high and not prospered. EU integration brings continuing pressure for consumption tax harmonization as well. EU member nations must have a value-added tax (VAT) of at least 15 percent (the main VAT band) and limits the set of products and services that can be included in the preferential tax band. Still this policy does not stop people utilizing the difference in VAT levels when purchasing certain goods (e.g. cars). The contributing factor are the single currency (Euro), growth of e-commerce and geographical proximity.

The political pressure for tax harmonization extends beyond EU borders. Some neighbouring countries with special tax regimes (e.g. Switzerland) were already forced to some concessions in this area.

==Criticism==
Advocates for tax competition say it generally results in benefits to taxpayers and the global economy.

Some economists argue that tax competition is beneficial in raising total tax intake due to low corporate tax rates stimulating economic growth.

Others argue that tax competition is generally harmful because it distorts investment decisions and thus reduces the efficiency of capital allocation, redistributes the national burden of taxation away from capital and onto less mobile factors such as labour, and undermines democracy by forcing governments into modifying tax systems in ways that . It also tends to increase complexity in national and international tax systems, as governments constantly modify tax systems to take account of the &#x27;competitive&#x27; tax environment.
It has also been argued that just as competition is good for businesses, competition is good for governments as it drives efficiencies and good governance of the public budget.

Others point out that tax competition between countries bears no relation to competition between companies in a market: consider, for instance, the difference between a failed company and a failed state—and that while market competition is regarded as generally beneficial, tax competition between countries is always harmful.

Some observers suggest that tax competition is generally a central part of a government policy for improving the lot of labour by creating well-paid jobs (often in countries or regions with very limited job prospects). Others suggest that it is beneficial mainly for investors, as workers could have been better paid (both through lower taxation on them, and through higher redistribution of wealth) if it was not for tax competition lowering effective tax rates on corporations.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) organized an anti-tax competition project in the 1990s, culminating with the publication of &quot;Harmful Tax Competition: An Emerging Global Issue&quot; in 1998 and the creation of a blacklist of so-called tax havens in 2000. Blacklisted jurisdictions effectively resisted the OECD by noting that several of the member nations also were tax havens according to the OECD&#x27;s own definition.

Left-wing economists generally argue that governments need tax revenue to cover debts and contingencies, and that paying to fund a welfare state is an obligation of social responsibility. Another argument is that tax competition is a zero-sum game. Right-wing economists argue that tax competition means that taxpayers can vote with their feet, choosing the region with the most efficient delivery of governmental services. This makes the tax base of a state volitional because the taxpayer can avoid tax by renouncing citizenship or emigrating and thereby changing tax residence.

In April 2021, US Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen has proposed a global minimum corporate tax rate, to avoid profit shifting by companies to avoid taxation.

<text>William Clyde Elliott Sr. (born October 8, 1955), also known as &quot;Awesome Bill from Dawsonville&quot;, &quot;Million Dollar Bill&quot;, or &quot;Wild Bill&quot; is an American former professional stock car racing driver. He last competed in the Camping World Superstar Racing Experience part-time in 2022. His accolades include the 1988 Winston Cup Championship and garnering 44 wins in that series, including crown jewel victories in two Daytona 500s (1985, 1987), three Southern 500s (1985, 1988, and 1994), one Winston 500 (1985), and one Brickyard 400 (2002). Elliott achieved a NASCAR record four consecutive wins at Michigan International Speedway between 1985 and 1986, and 7 wins overall, the most at any one racetrack in his career. Elliott also won an additional six exhibition (non-points) races in his career, including one Winston All-Star Race win in 1986, one Busch Clash win in 1987, and four Daytona Duel wins in 1985, 1986, 1992, and 2000.

Elliott holds the track record for fastest qualifying speed at Talladega at and Daytona International Speedway at , both of which were set in 1987; the mark at Talladega is the fastest qualifying speed for any NASCAR race ever. With the usage of restrictor plates at Daytona and Talladega since 1988, it is highly unlikely that these two qualifying speed records will ever be topped. Elliott also holds the distinction of recording a track record at Talladega Superspeedway of six consecutive pole positions from 1985 to 1987.

In 1985, Elliott made NASCAR history by winning the first-ever Winston Million, a million-dollar bonus to any driver that could win three out of the four crown jewel races of NASCAR in a single season: The Daytona 500 at Daytona, the Winston 500 at Talladega, the World 600 at Charlotte, and the Southern 500 at Darlington. In a year dominated by Elliott, Bill went on to win a &quot;NASCAR modern-era single season record&quot; of 11 superspeedway races (with 4 &quot;season sweeps&quot;: Atlanta, Pocono, Michigan, and Darlington) and 11 poles, with three of those 11 wins being in the Daytona 500, the Winston 500, and the Southern 500, earning Bill the &quot;Winston Million Dollar Bonus&quot; and earning him the nickname &quot;Million Dollar Bill&quot;.

Elliott won NASCAR&#x27;s Most Popular Driver Award a record 16 times (1984-1988, 1991–2000, 2002). He withdrew his name from the ballot for that award after winning it in 2002. In 2005, the Georgia State Legislature declared October 8 as Bill Elliott Day in the state of Georgia. Regarded as one of the greatest drivers in NASCAR history, Elliott was named one of NASCAR&#x27;s 50 Greatest Drivers in 1998, and has been inducted into numerous racing and motorsports Halls of Fame, including being inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 1998, and being an inaugural inductee into the Georgia Racing Hall of Fame in 2002. He was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America at Daytona on August 15, 2007, inducted into the National Motorsports Press Association Hall of Fame at Darlington in 2015, and in the 2015 class of the NASCAR Hall of Fame. Elliott has also been honored by the state legislature with a stretch of roadway (the entirety of Georgia State Route 183) in his native Dawson County renamed Elliott Family Parkway.

Elliott&#x27;s son Chase was the 2020 NASCAR Cup Series champion. The Elliotts became the third father-son NASCAR champions in history, along with Lee and Richard Petty, and Ned and Dale Jarrett.

==Personal life==

William Clyde Elliott was born in Dawsonville, Georgia on October 8, 1955. According to his autobiography, many generations of Elliotts resided there. He was named after two relatives and is the youngest of three boys. His parents were Erving &quot;George&quot; Elliott Jr. (1924-1998) and Mildred Reece (1921-1991) His father George created a lumber company and loved racing, and later created a speed shop where Bill&#x27;s brothers, Ernie (born 1947) and Dan (born 1951), worked. His father was also a Ford person and later created a Ford dealership as there were none in the area.

Elliott has two daughters, Starr and Brittany, and one son, William Clyde II (nicknamed &quot;Chase&quot;). The 2014 NASCAR Nationwide Series champion and the 2020 NASCAR Cup Series champion, Chase Elliott currently competes in the NASCAR Cup Series for Hendrick Motorsports in the No. 9 Chevrolet. Brittany Elliott joined the US Air Force Security Forces.

==NASCAR career==

===Elliott/Melling years (1976-1991)===

====Elliott Racing (1976-1981)====
Driving a car owned by his father, George Elliott, Elliott made his first Winston Cup Series start at Rockingham in 1976. He qualified 34th in a field of 36 cars, and finished 33rd; Elliott only lasted 32 laps that day before the oil pump failed in his Ford Torino. Elliott toiled for five years in the Winston Cup Series without corporate sponsorship, and along the way showed flashes that he could compete with the established veterans of the sport. In mid-1977, Elliott bought a Mercury Montego from Bobby Allison after his split from Penske Racing to replace the inferior Torino, and the move paid off. He soon earned his first Top 10 finish in the Southern 500 (10th), and his first top-5 finish 2 years later in the same race, finishing 2nd to race winner (and Elliott&#x27;s boyhood hero) David Pearson.

In the fall of 1980, Elliott gained his first major sponsor in the form of $500 from Harry Melling of Melling Racing in the 1980 National 500 at Charlotte. Melling would extend his contract and give the team enough sponsorship to run a 12 race schedule in 1981. In the 1981 season, he had one Top 5 and seven Top 10 finishes in 13 races, including the team&#x27;s first pole in the spring race at Darlington.

====Melling Racing and the Beginning Years (1982-1984)====
On December 1, 1981, Melling bought the team from Elliott&#x27;s father George. In 1982, Elliott continued to show more and more flashes, and continued to flirt with victory lane more and more, as he finished the season with eight Top 5 finishes, and nine Top 10 finishes which included three runner-up finishes in the World 600 at Charlotte to Neil Bonnett, the Firecracker 400 at Daytona to Bobby Allison, and the fall race at Charlotte to Harry Gant.

In 1983, Elliott picked up four more 2nd place finishes in the season, which included finishing runner-up in the Daytona 500 to Cale Yarborough, runner-up at Rockingham to Richard Petty, runner-up in the summer race at the road course Riverside to Ricky Rudd, and runner-up in the Southern 500 at Darlington to Bobby Allison. After 115 starts beginning in 1976, and eight 2nd-place finishes between 1979 and 1983, Elliott finally broke through and won his first Winston Cup race in the final race of the 1983 season — the Winston Western 500 at Riverside. With his first win to go along with 12 Top 5s and 22 Top 10 finishes, Elliott finished the season in 3rd place in the final championship point standings of 1983.

Elliott gained full sponsorship from Coors in 1984 to the tune of $400,000 and won three races – the Michigan 400 at Michigan, the Miller High Life 500 at Charlotte, and the American 500 at Rockingham. He also collected four poles and finished 3rd in the final points standings for the second year in a row. The 1984 season also brought Elliott his first season of winning NASCAR&#x27;s Most Popular Driver Award, and would begin a stretch of five consecutive years, from 1984 to 1988, where he would win that award.

====The 1985 Season: Winning the Winston Million====
Before the beginning of the 1985 season, the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and its core brand sponsor Winston began the Winston Million promotion. It offered a 1 million bonus to any driver who could win three out of the four crown jewel races of NASCAR (a &quot;Small Slam&quot;) in a single calendar year season; the Daytona 500 at Daytona (NASCAR&#x27;s most prestigious race), the Winston 500 at Talladega (NASCAR&#x27;s fastest race), the World 600 at Charlotte (NASCAR&#x27;s longest race), and the Southern 500 at Darlington (NASCAR&#x27;s oldest race). If there was no million-dollar winner, a $100,000 consolation bonus would be given to the first driver to win two of the four races.

The 1985 season was the best season of Bill Elliott&#x27;s career. He scored 11 wins and 11 poles out of 28 races and also went on to win the first ever Winston Million in the Southern 500 at Darlington. This would give him the nicknames &quot;Million Dollar Bill&quot; and &quot;Awesome Bill From Dawsonville&quot;.

Elliott started the 1985 season first with a dominating victory in the Daytona 500, leading 136 of the 200 laps, starting from the pole position. This was the &quot;first leg&quot; of the Winston Million promotion that Elliott captured. His 2nd win of the season came three weeks later at his hometrack of Atlanta Motor Speedway, leading 129 of 328 laps. He would win again two weeks later, his 3rd of the season, with a win in the spring race at Darlington. Going into the &quot;second leg&quot; of the Winston Million promotion, which was the Winston 500 at Talladega, Elliott completed one of the greatest and most memorable comebacks in NASCAR history. Elliott was leading the race when he had to pit due to a broken oil fitting, which would then put him back about 2 laps. He completed one of NASCAR&#x27;s greatest comebacks by making his way through the field, making up both laps under green flag conditions without the aide of a caution, and winning the race, his 4th of the season, and capturing the &quot;second leg&quot; of the Winston Million promotion, which also guaranteed Elliott at the very least the $100,000 consolation bonus in the Winston Million promotion. The following week, Elliott captured his 5th win of the season at Dover. Despite losing power-steering in the car, he led 336 of the 500 laps, and won the race being the only car finishing on the lead lap. Going into the &quot;third leg&quot; of the Winston Million promotion, which was the World 600 at Charlotte, Elliott had a chance to capture the million dollar prize. Elliott had a strong car, leading 84 of the first 155 laps, but mechanical failures relegated him to an 18th place finish. This was the only major of the four, that Elliott would not win in 1985 (a driver needed only to win a &quot;small slam&quot; of the four majors to win the bonus; Elliott, since he retired in 2013, would not finish a Career Grand Slam. However, Elliott had won twice at Charlotte Motor Speedway in 1984 and 1987, and had finished runner up in the World 600 twice, in 1982 and 1990).

After the disappointing finish in the World 600, Elliott rebounded with a 6th place finish at Riverside. He would then go on a tear during the summer months of 1985, first winning back-to-back races, his 6th and 7th of the season, at Pocono and Michigan. Elliott would then lead the most laps, 103 of 160 laps, and finish 2nd in the Pepsi Firecracker 400 at Daytona to Greg Sacks. He followed that up with his 8th win of the season at Pocono, then leading 100 of 188 laps at Talladega and finishing 4th, and then leading 90 of 200 laps and winning at Michigan, his 9th of the season. It was also during this stretch, Elliott would set an unprecedented NASCAR record of winning five consecutive pole qualifying sessions in 1985; the June Pocono race, the Firecracker 400 at Daytona, the July races in Pocono and Talladega, and the August Michigan race. That did not include the June Michigan race where qualifying was rained out, and the July Pocono race pole was where he started second, but further investigation led NASCAR to throw out the winning pole time for illegal fuel additives, retroactively awarding Elliott the pole award, money, and credit towards the season-long award for most poles won.

After a 5th place finish at Bristol, Elliott had a chance to clinch the Winston Million Dollar Bonus in the next race, which was the 4th and &quot;final leg&quot; of the Winston Million Dollar promotion: the Southern 500 at Darlington. Multiple media outlets went to cover the race, as Elliott had the chance to collect the million dollar purse which at that time had never been done in stock car racing. Elliott started the race strong, but had to fend off tough competition throughout the race which included serious threats by Harry Gant and Dale Earnhardt, who dominated the early and middle portions of the race. Harry Gant led 84 laps before the engine gave way on his car, and Dale Earnhardt, who dominated most of the race leading 147 of the 367 laps, crashed out at around lap 318. In the final stages of the race, Elliott was leading and had to fend off a hard charging Cale Yarborough who was battling an ill-handling racecar after he broke a power-steering line. None the less, Elliott led 100 of the 367 laps and crossed the finish line first, winning the Southern 500 at Darlington, capturing his 10th win of the season, and winning the first ever Winston Million Dollar Bonus, which at the time was the largest single race payday in motorsports history. After the race, Elliott took a victory lap in a Pontiac Grand Am convertible with the President and CEO of Winston Tobacco Products at the time, Gerald H. Long, and NASCAR Hall of Famer Ned Jarrett conducting the victory interview. In victory lane, Long presented Elliott with the Winston Million Dollar Bonus while being showered with &quot;Million Dollar Bills&quot;, which would then end up being one of Bill Elliott&#x27;s infamous nicknames he would carry throughout his illustrious career. After the race, Elliott became the second NASCAR driver to be featured on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, following Cale Yarborough after his win in the 1977 Daytona 500.

After winning the Southern 500 at Darlington along with the Winston Million, Elliott had built a 206 point lead in the championship standings with eight races to go. However Elliott would lose the point lead after a string of poor finishes, which included a 12th a Richmond, 20th at Dover, 17th at Martinsville, and the transmission failing at North Wilkesboro, finishing 30th. In contrast, Darrell Waltrip won at Richmond, finished 2nd at both Dover and Martinsville, and finished 14th at North Wilkesboro, thus overtaking the points lead over Elliott. Elliott did come within 20 points of the championship lead after his 11th win of the season at Atlanta with one race to go. However in the season finale at Riverside, a 31st place finish due to a broken oil pump and a 7th place finish by Darrell Waltrip ended Elliott&#x27;s championship hopes, as he finished in 2nd place in the final championship standings, 101 points behind Waltrip. The 1985 season was still historic for Elliott. Along with winning the Winston Million, he set a NASCAR modern-era record of 11 superspeedway victories in one season, and another modern-era record for completing the season sweep at 4 different tracks in one season: Pocono, Michigan, Darlington, and Atlanta. At the end of the season, Elliott was voted the National Motorsports Press Association Driver of the Year for 1985.

====The Following 1986 Season====
In 1986, Elliott won only two races, both being the Michigan races. With the season sweep at Michigan, Elliott became the first driver in NASCAR history to win 4 straight superspeedway races at one track (the record would later be tied by Dale Earnhardt Jr. at Talladega in 2003). He also won four poles during the season, and he finished 4th in the championship standings. He also won The 1986 Winston All-Star race, held at Atlanta. Ironically, Atlanta is his hometown track, being the closest to Dawsonville in the circuit. Also ironic, is that Elliott would remain the only winner of the All-Star race held somewhere other than Charlotte, until 2020 when his son Chase won his All-Star race at Bristol.

====The 1987 Season: Battling Dale Earnhardt, and setting the All-Time Fastest Qualifying Records====
Elliott started the 1987 season with a bang, first winning the Busch Clash during Daytona Speedweeks, then going on to win his second Daytona 500 in dominating fashion, starting from the pole position (his 3rd consecutive Daytona 500 pole position), and leading 104 of the 200 laps. He won another five races that season, including the Talladega 500, another win at Michigan, and winning three of the final four races at Charlotte, Rockingham, and Atlanta. Elliott also won eight poles, and finished 2nd in the final championship point standings again, this time to Dale Earnhardt by 489 points. Elliott and Earnhardt were essentially the only two championship contenders all year in 1987, as both battled and tangled with each other all year. They both combined for winning 17 of the 29 races in 1987 (Earnhardt with 11 wins, Elliott with 6 wins), and finishing 1-2 four times that season, which included Earnhardt beating Elliott on a last lap pass in the spring race at Darlington, the TranSouth 500, when Elliott ran out of gas on the last lap. Elliott beat Earnhardt to the checkered flag three times in 1987 at Michigan, Rockingham, and the season finale at Atlanta. The most infamous moment between Elliott and Earnhardt occurred in The 1987 Winston All-Star race, when Elliott and Earnhardt tangled on the front-stretch at Charlotte, in what has become known in NASCAR lore as &quot;The Pass In The Grass&quot;.

 However, Elliott&#x27;s most lasting accomplishment that year was setting two NASCAR qualifying records, which stand to this day. At Daytona for that year&#x27;s Daytona 500, he set the NASCAR speed record with an average speed of . He broke his own record later that year at Talladega for that year&#x27;s Winston 500, with an average speed of ; the previous record he set in 1986 was . In both races, he used a Ford Thunderbird which contained an engine built by his brother Ernie Elliott. However, at Talladega, Bobby Allison was spun and went airborne into the catch fence, tearing a large section away and injuring several fans. After this incident, NASCAR mandated the use of restrictor plates at Daytona and Talladega. As a result, Elliott&#x27;s speed records will likely never be broken.

====The 1988 Winston Cup Championship Season====
In 1988, Elliott had one of the greatest seasons of his career when he captured his first and only Winston Cup Championship in NASCAR. In 29 races, Elliott won another six races, won another six poles, had a string of 16 consecutive Top 10 finishes, and did not have a race where he finished outside the Top 20.

His first win of the season was at Bristol, where he was spun out by Geoff Bodine late in the race, but after pitting made his way back in the final 4 laps and won the race. Elliott won his second race of the season at Dover, leading 203 of 500 laps. In the June race at Pocono, Elliott finished 10th and would begin a string of 16 consecutive finishes inside the Top 10. During that run, Elliott finished runner-up in the first Michigan race, then won back-to-back races in the summer, the first one being his first Pepsi Firecracker 400 win at Daytona, followed by the July race at Pocono. After back-to-back 3rd place finishes at Watkins Glen and Michigan, Elliott overtook the points lead for the first time in the season with a 2nd place finish in the second race at Bristol. Elliott followed up taking the points lead after Bristol, by winning two of the next three races, both in dominating fashion; the first being his second Southern 500 victory at Darlington leading 154 of 367 laps, and then leading 392 of 500 laps completing the season sweep at Dover.

Going into the season finale, Elliott looked to win his first NASCAR Winston Cup championship at his home track of Atlanta. His only threat to the championship was Rusty Wallace, who entered the race winning three of the last four races and was 79 points behind Elliott. Elliott started 29th, but needed to finish 18th or better to clinch the championship regardless of what Rusty Wallace did in the race. Rusty dominated the race, starting on the pole, leading 166 of the 325 laps, and winning the race. Elliott drove careful and conservatively through the field and finished 11th to claim the 1988 Winston Cup Championship by 24 points over Rusty Wallace. Elliott finished the season with six wins, six poles, 15 Top 5s, 22 Top 10s (including at one point 16 in a row), and an average finish of 6.6.

====The Final Years at Melling Racing (1989-1991)====
Following his championship season, Elliott broke his wrist in a crash during testing at Daytona and required relief by Jody Ridley during several races in the first part of the 1989 season. Elliott won two poles and three races, at Michigan, Pocono, and Phoenix, and finished 6th in the championship standings.

In 1990, Elliott won one race, at Dover, and two poles and finished 4th in the championship standings. In the 1990 race at Atlanta, Elliott&#x27;s rear tire changer Mike Rich was killed when Ricky Rudd lost control of his car, spun, and slammed the crew member between his car and Elliott&#x27;s. As a result, NASCAR restricted the cars&#x27; speed on pit road.

The 1991 season saw Elliott&#x27;s sponsorship change to Coors Light and the familiar red on the car was replaced with blue. Elliott would only win once that year in the Pepsi 400 at Daytona and won two poles. After a year of struggle, Elliott finished a disappointing 11th in the championship standings, causing him and Coors to part ways with the Mellings. That lone win in 1991 would be the only time in his career that Elliott won in a car that was not painted red.

Overall, in 10 seasons from 1982-1991, Melling Racing set several NASCAR records, winning the Winston Million in 1985, winning the 1988 Winston Cup Championship, and winning a total of 34 career races, all of these accomplishments with only Elliott. The success of Melling Racing may have come to an end after Elliott left at the end of 1991, but Elliott would be more successful in the years to come.

===Junior Johnson and Associates (1992-1994)===
====The 1992 Season and the Hooters 500 Season Finale====
Elliott left Melling to join Junior Johnson &amp; Associates in 1992, replacing Geoffrey Bodine in the No. 11 Budweiser-sponsored Ford. Elliott would find success almost immediately in 1992. After a disappointing 27th place finish in the Daytona 500, Elliott would then win the next four consecutive races at Rockingham, Richmond, Atlanta, and Darlington. Elliott&#x27;s strong season would continue, which included a 2nd place finish at Talladega, leading the most laps at Sonoma finishing 5th, leading the most laps at the second Michigan race finishing 3rd, and leading the most laps, 261 of 500 laps, in the fall race at Dover and finishing 2nd.

After the fall Dover race, Elliott found himself with a 154 point lead in the championship standings with six races remaining. However, much like the ending of the 1985 season, Elliott would lose the point lead after a string of poor finishes. Elliott&#x27;s lead disappeared thanks to a batch of poor finishes, which included mechanical problems beginning with an engine failure at Martinsville leading to a 30th place finish, a 26th place finish at North Wilkesboro, a broken sway bar while running in the Top 5 with less than 40 laps to go at Charlotte leading to a 30th place finish, and a cracked cylinder head leading to another engine failure at Phoenix, finishing 31st. The string of poor finishes dropped Elliott out of the points lead to 3rd place, 40 points behind 1st place Davey Allison and 10 points behind 2nd place Alan Kulwicki, with one race to go.

The season finale in 1992 was the Hooters 500 at Atlanta, and is regarded by many as one of the greatest races in NASCAR history. It was the final career race for NASCAR legend Richard Petty, while future NASCAR legend Jeff Gordon was making his first career start. Six drivers had a mathematical shot to win the championship, with the points leader Davey Allison, Alan Kulwicki, and Bill Elliott being the primary contenders. Harry Gant, Kyle Petty, and Mark Martin also had long shots to win the championship. After Davey Allison crashed out late in the race, the championship came down to Elliott and Kulwicki who ran 1-2 together throughout the later stages of the race. The championship would be determined between the two, by whoever picked up the five extra bonus points for leading the most laps in the race. Elliott would go on to win the race leading 102 of the 325 laps, while Alan Kulwicki finished 2nd to Elliott, leading 103 of the 325 laps. Kulwicki picked up the five point bonus for leading one single lap more than Elliott, and by finishing 2nd was able to maintain and keep his 10 point cushion on Elliott to win the 1992 Winston Cup Championship. Had Kulwicki not led the most laps, Elliott would have finished tied with him for the points lead and would have been awarded the championship on a tiebreaker due to him having more wins in 1992 (Elliott had won five races that year, to Kulwicki&#x27;s two). Elliott finished the 1992 season with five wins, three poles, 14 Top 5s, 17 Top 10s, and finishing 2nd in the final championship standings for a 3rd time, this time by only a mere 10 points which remained the closet margin in NASCAR history until 2004, and eventually the 2011 season.

====The Final Years at Junior Johnson &amp; Associates (1993-1994)====
Elliott went winless for the first time in 10 years during the 1993 season and finished 8th in the standings. Elliott did however pick up his first, and one lone career win in the Xfinity Series (formerly known at the time, as the Busch Grand National Series) in 1993, at the road course of Watkins Glen.

Elliott scored just one win the following season in 1994; his 3rd win in the Mountain Dew Southern 500 at Darlington. It was the 40th win of Elliott&#x27;s career, and would be the last win Elliott would capture in NASCAR until 2001, more than six years later. It also eventually became the final win for the team of Junior Johnson &amp; Associates. Elliott finished the 1994 season finishing 10th in the championship standings. After his Darlington victory, Elliott announced he would be leaving Junior Johnson &amp; Associates, and start his own team with sponsorship from McDonald&#x27;s (leaving Johnson&#x27;s other car, the No. 27 of Jimmy Spencer) beginning in 1995.

===Driver/Owner (1995-2000)===

====Elliott-Hardy Racing====

After leaving Johnson&#x27;s team, Elliott fielded his own Winston Cup race team from 1995 to 2000. He used the No. 94 in honor of his nephew, Casey Elliott, who was battling cancer at the time he formed the team and would die in 1996. 
The team also fielded entries in the Busch Series and Truck Series.
Elliott failed to win a race during this time, though he did manage two top-ten finishes in the championship standings, with 8th-place finishes in 1995 and 1997.
In 1996, Elliott missed five races to recover from injuring a broken hip at Talladega and was replaced by Dorsey Schroeder and Todd Bodine.

====Bill Elliott Racing====
In July 1996, the partnership between Elliott and Hardy was dissolved, the team being renamed Bill Elliott Racing. Later in 1996, Elliott suffered effects after an accident at Talladega earlier in the year and, Elliott missed two races and was replaced by Tommy Kendall and Bobby Hillin Jr. Elliott also made his first career start in the Camping World Truck Series driving for Jim Smith&#x27;s team Ultra Motorsports at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, finishing 2nd.

The 1997 season, was undoubtedly Elliott&#x27;s best season as a driver/owner statistically. He finished the season with one pole, five Top 5 finishes, 14 Top 10 finishes, and finishing 8th in the final point standings. Elliott did not win any races, but came extremely close on several occasions. He was leading late in the 1997 Daytona 500, leading with less than 10 laps to go, until a late caution came out. On the ensuing restart, he would then get ganged up by the Hendrick Motorsports teammates of eventual winner Jeff Gordon, Terry Labonte, and Ricky Craven, ultimately finishing 4th. Elliott&#x27;s best finish during his six year run as a driver/owner was at Michigan in 1997, finishing 2nd to Ernie Irvan. Elliott also dominated that year&#x27;s Mountain Dew Southern 500 leading 181 of the 367 laps, but finished 4th to eventual winner Jeff Gordon, who ironically, along with winning the race also joined Elliott as the only winners of the Winston Million, as Jeff won the &quot;final running&quot; of the Winston Million promotion in 1997, while Bill won the &quot;initial running&quot; of the promotion in 1985.

In 1998, Elliott teamed up with Dan Marino to form a multi-car team, the team was renamed Elliott-Marino Motorsports, adding the No. 13 and keeping the No. 94, Marino owned the No. 13 while Elliott owned the No. 94. The year was marked with sadness for Elliott when he had to miss the fall Dover race to attend the funeral of his father. Matt Kenseth drove Elliott&#x27;s No. 94 and finished sixth in his Cup debut.

After a disappointing 1999 season which saw Elliott&#x27;s multi-car operation dissolve back into No. 94, Elliott announced in early 2000 he was selling his equipment to championship-winning crew chief Ray Evernham to become part of Dodge&#x27;s return to NASCAR. The team would also switch to No. 9, which was owned by Melling, his championship-winning team. Even though he struggled the entire six years as a driver/owner and did not win a single race, Elliott&#x27;s fans still voted him as NASCAR&#x27;s Most Popular Driver. He would hold the record for 10 straight years as a most popular driver from 1991 to 2000, a record that would stand until 2013, when Dale Earnhardt Jr. would win his 11th straight award. Earnhardt would win the award for 15 straight years from 2003 to 2017, a NASCAR record.

===Evernham Motorsports (2001-2003)===
====The 2001 Season: Dodge&#x27;s return to NASCAR and Elliott&#x27;s first win in 7 years====
In 2000, Elliott sold his team to Ray Evernham and began driving the No. 9 Dodge Dealers/UAW Dodge Intrepid the following year. Melling Racing, who ran the No. 9 for Bill Elliott from 1981 to 1991, yielded that number to Ray Evernham for 2001. Elliott asked Evernham to drive that number out of respect for his old team. Elliott and Evernham however found success in its very first race in the No. 9 Dodge, as Elliott won the pole for the 2001 Daytona 500. It would also be the 50th pole of his career. By winning the pole, Bill Elliott would become the first, and as of 2018, the only driver in NASCAR history to score his 50th career pole in the Daytona 500. He would finish the race in the Top 5, bringing home a 5th-place finish, even though the race will forever be remembered for the death of fan-favorite Dale Earnhardt.

Elliott finished his first season with Evernham Motorsports with two poles, five Top 5s, nine Top 10s, and one win in the Pennzoil Freedom 400 at Homestead-Miami from the pole position. Elliott won the race by passing his Evernham Motorsports teammate Casey Atwood with five laps to go. This was his first win since the Southern 500 in 1994, seven years and 226 races. As of 2024, the 226 race winless streak is the longest drought, between wins, in NASCAR history. However, after Melling yielded the No. 9 for 2001, Bill Elliott would win at Homestead driving that number, but this time, with Evernham Motorsports. It was the team&#x27;s first-ever win. In another ironic twist, Elliott winning at Homestead would be the first time since Melling Racing and Bill Elliott himself at the Pepsi 400 in 1991, that the No. 9 went to victory lane. Elliott finished 15th in the final points standings for 2001. Elliott also withdrew from the ballot as NASCAR&#x27;s Most Popular Driver, and encouraged his long-time fans to vote for his friend and long-time rival Dale Earnhardt. Earnhardt was posthumously voted as NASCAR&#x27;s Most Popular Driver for 2001.

====The 2002 Season: Back-to-Back Wins at Pocono and Indianapolis====
 In 2002, Elliott won four poles and went to victory lane twice in memorable back-to-back races. The first of those wins included the Pennsylvania 500 at Pocono, which at the time made Elliott the winningest driver at Pocono Raceway with five career wins (Denny Hamlin and Jeff Gordon have since surpassed him at 6 wins each). A week later, Elliott had one of the most memorable and dominant victories in the history of the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. He started on the outside pole, and dominated the race leading 93 of 160 laps. In the closing laps, he and Rusty Wallace battled it out for the lead, with Elliott passing Rusty with 12 laps to go, en route to victory.

After the back-to-back victories at Pocono and Indy, Elliott was 6th in points. Four weeks later after a 3rd place finish in the Southern 500 at Darlington, Elliott then found himself 7th in points with 11 races to go, and on his way to finishing the season in the Top 10 in points for the first time since 1997. After a 5th-place finish at Kansas and a 19th-place finish at Talladega, Elliott was 8th in points with six races to go. However, a string of five consecutive finishes of 30th or worse, which included a 42nd-place finish after a crash at Martinsville, and a bad water pump leading to a 39th-place finish at Rockingham, ultimately dropped Elliott from 8th to finishing a disappointing 13th in the final points standings. Elliott finished the 2002 season with two wins, four poles, six Top 5s, 13 Top 10s, and for the 16th and final time in his career, Elliott was voted as NASCAR&#x27;s Most Popular Driver.

====The 2003 Season: Final Full-Time Season====
The 2003 season ultimately became Elliott&#x27;s final full-time season. It was a struggle through the first 26 races of the season, as Bill only had five Top 10 finishes and was 16th in points. In the final 10 races, Elliott went from 16th in points to finishing 9th in the overall standings, as he finished in the Top 15 in all 10 races, had five Top 5 finishes, seven Top 10 finishes, and led the most laps in three of the final seven races which included Elliott&#x27;s final victory of his career.

In the final seven races of the season starting at Kansas, Elliott started 8th and led the most laps, 115 of 267 laps, and finished 2nd to Ryan Newman who won on fuel strategy. Elliott followed that up with a 4th-place finish at Charlotte, a 9th-place finish at Martinsville, and a 4th-place finish at Atlanta. Two weeks later, Elliott captured what would be the final win of his career at Rockingham (Ironically enough, at the same track where he made his first career NASCAR start back in 1976). Elliott officially started 5th, but had to start dead last in the back of the field due to an engine change after qualifying. He still managed to climb through the field and lead the most laps of the race, leading 140 of the 393 laps, en route to capturing his 44th and final NASCAR race win over future seven-time NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson. A week later in the season finale, Elliott came within a lap of winning his final race as a full-time driver in the Ford 400 at Homestead-Miami. Elliott dominated the entire race, leading 189 of the 267 laps and was on his way to victory, but a cut tire on the final lap in turn 2 allowed Bobby Labonte to score the victory (which ended up, being the final win of Bobby&#x27;s career). Elliott still finished the race in 8th place and maintained his 9th place position in the final points standings, his best points finish since finishing 8th in the 1997 standings.

Elliott officially withdrew from the ballot as NASCAR&#x27;s Most Popular Driver, giving the award to Dale Earnhardt Jr., who would go on to win for 15 straight years from 2003 to 2017, a NASCAR record. A few weeks later after the 2003 season ended, Elliott announced that he was relinquishing the No. 9 car to Kasey Kahne and switching to a part-time schedule driving R&amp;D cars for Evernham.

===Semi-retirement years (2004-2012)===

==== Evernham Motorsports ====
In 2004, Elliott drove the No. 91 Dodge Intrepid for Evernham in three events (along with the Budweiser Shootout). While he only made three starts during his first part-time season with Evernham, he still managed to have some success which included 2nd and 10th-place qualifying efforts at Texas and Las Vegas, and also a 9th-place finish at Indianapolis which ended up being the 320th and final Top 10 finish of his career. He also brought back the Bill Elliott Racing moniker when he drove the 98 car twice in 2004, one with Coke C2 Sponsorship and one with McDonald&#x27;s. The reason is that Evernham fielded cars with sponsorship with PepsiCo&#x27;s Mountain Dew. He did also manage a 3rd-place qualifying effort at California.

In 2005, Elliott continued his part-time driving duties which included driving the No. 39 Coors Dodge Charger (in a paint scheme reminiscent of his 1987 Coors Light Ford) for Chip Ganassi Racing in the Budweiser Shootout and the No. 91 Evernham Dodge in several events. Although he made three more starts than the previous season, he did not have the same amount of success. He managed to get an 11th-place finish and a 10th-place qualifying effort at Michigan, along with a 9th-place qualifying effort at Texas. He also competed in select NASCAR Busch Series events for Rusty Wallace and also drove the No. 6 Unilever Dodge Charger in the Busch Series for Evernham at Memphis, which celebrated the 40th anniversary of &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;.

For the 2006 season, the 2005 owners&#x27; points for the No. 91 team went to the new No. 10 Evernham team and driver Scott Riggs and the No. 91 team was discontinued.

On August 8, 2006, Evernham Motorsports announced that Elliott would return to the organization for the race at Watkins Glen driving the No. 19 Dodge previously driven by Jeremy Mayfield. The team fell out of the top-35 in owners&#x27; points after Indianapolis, leading to the firing of Mayfield, and Evernham assumed that Elliott would guarantee a starting spot in the field by being a past champion. However, since the driver switch was made past the entry deadline, NASCAR said that Elliott was not eligible for the past champions provisional.

==== Mach 1 Racing ====
Elliott also drove the No. 98 Dodge Intrepid for Mach 1 Racing in three other events in 2004 because of sponsorship issues between Coca-Cola (Elliott&#x27;s sponsor) and Pepsi (Evernham&#x27;s sponsor). But Evernham leased the car to him. Although he only made three starts during his first part-time season as a driver, he still managed to have some success which included a 3rd-place qualifying effort at California respectively.

==== MB2 Motorsports ====
On January 4, 2006, Elliott announced that he would pilot the No. 36 Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS for MB2 Motorsports in the 2006 Daytona Speedweeks events. This included the Budweiser Shootout, the Gatorade Duel, and the Daytona 500, which Elliott had not competed in since 2003.

==== Michael Waltrip Racing ====
On March 17, 2006, it was announced that Elliott would drive the No. 00 Burger King Chevrolet for Michael Waltrip Racing in five NEXTEL Cup events which included Chicagoland, New Hampshire, Indianapolis, California, and Homestead.

==== R&amp;J Racing ====
For the race at Kansas, Elliott teamed up with R&amp;J Racing to drive the No. 37 Dodge. Elliott finished a season-high 16th at the Banquet 400 at Kansas but did not qualify for the Bank of America 500 at Charlotte two weeks later. Elliott was scheduled to be the Team Red Bull entry for Atlanta, but A. J. Allmendinger drove the car instead, Elliott instead drove the No. 37 Dodge at Atlanta, marking the 30th Anniversary of Elliott driving at his hometown track.

Elliott attempted to qualify for the 2007 Daytona 500, but failed to make the race in the No. 37.

==== Wood Brothers Racing ====
Later that season, Elliott signed to drive the No. 21 for Wood Brothers Racing in 2007, in part due to his championship provisional, which guaranteed to start the race. Since fellow champion Dale Jarrett had used all of his guaranteed starts in his Toyota for Michael Waltrip Racing, Elliott was the only champion eligible for the provisional not guaranteed a spot by being in the Top 35 in owner&#x27;s points. His first race for the team was the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte, which he qualified without needing one of his six provisionals. He led the race at one point until he was involved in a wreck around lap 200. At Michigan, Elliott gave the team a much-needed 11th-place finish and was kept in the car until the fall Richmond race. The car then fell out of the top 35 again but at Bristol got back into the Top 35 in points. Ken Schrader returned to the No. 21 replacing Elliott at a testing session at Talladega Superspeedway due to the team being back in the Top 35 in owner&#x27;s points. He returned for the final four races after the No. 21 fell out of the Top 35 once again.

On September 23, 2007, in an interview with Charlotte Observer, Len Wood the co-owner of the No. 21 said Elliott would have his own sponsor and share a ride with Jon Wood and Marcos Ambrose for 2008.
Elliott returned to the No. 21 to try to get the car back into the Top 35 points at Lowe&#x27;s Motor Speedway.

Elliott qualified for ten races that season, with a best finish of 20th in the Sunoco Presents: The American Red Cross Pennsylvania 500 at Pocono Raceway. At Daytona, Elliott announced that 2008 would be his final season as a Sprint Cup driver. But in an interview on NASCAR Raceday at Kansas, Elliott was asked about him racing and said &quot;We will be at Lowe&#x27;s, and do a few more races. Then we will see how things go.&quot; In 2008, his best starts were 5th at Bristol and 7th at Kansas. His best finish was 12th at Homestead-Miami Speedway.

In 2009, Elliott ran 12 races in the No. 21 Motorcraft Ford for the Wood Brothers, including the Daytona 500. His best finish in 2009 was 15th place at Lowe&#x27;s Motor Speedway.

On Memorial Day May 25, 2009, Elliott became the 7th member of the &quot;800 club&quot;, with his 800th career Sprint Cup start at Lowes Motor Speedway.

Elliott ran for the Wood Brothers in 2010. He also drove at Talladega for Latitude 43 Motorsports.

==== Phoenix Racing ====
In 2011, Elliott did not return to Wood Brothers Racing, but ran four races for Phoenix Racing in the No. 09 Chevy. Bill stepped out of the ride to assist his son Chase Elliott in the K&amp;N Pro Series East. Landon Cassill would take over the car for the fifth race of the season, which was eventually renumbered to No. 51.

==== Whitney Motorsports ====
Elliott was entered as the driver of the No. 46 Red Line Oil Chevrolet for Whitney Motorsports at Talladega but J. J. Yeley would finish the race.

==== NEMCO Motorsports ====
For the 2012 season, Elliott joined Joe Nemechek at NEMCO Motorsports to drive the No. 97 Toyota in the 2012 Daytona 500, but failed to qualify for the race. Elliott successfully qualified for the Sprint Cup race at Talladega driving the No. 97, but finished in 37th.

==== Turner Motorsports ====
Elliott made his third start of the 2012 season driving for Turner Motorsports in the July race at Daytona International Speedway, in the No. 50 Walmart Chevrolet. Elliott qualified 5th, and ran in the Top 10 throughout the first half of the race, but finished 37th after being involved in an accident. This was his 828th and final start in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.

==== GMS Racing ====
On August 4, 2018, GMS Racing announced that Elliott would return to NASCAR, driving the No. 23 Chevrolet Camaro at Road America in the Xfinity Series on August 25. It was Elliott&#x27;s first Xfinity start since 2005 and first National Series start since 2012. He finished in 20th on the lead lap. After the race, he quipped &quot;I feel like I hit everything but the lottery, I mean it was a great day.&quot;

====Superstar Racing Experience====

In 2021, Elliott was a full-time driver at the inaugural season of the Superstar Racing Experience, Tony Stewart&#x27;s new stock car racing series. His best result was third at the Nashville Fairgrounds Speedway, and he finished 9th in points. Elliott entered two rounds of the 2022 season.

==NASCAR video games==
In 1990, Konami released the first officially licensed NASCAR game, &quot;Bill Elliott&#x27;s NASCAR Challenge&quot; for MS-DOS. The game was released for the NES and Amiga in 1991, and &quot;Bill Elliott&#x27;s NASCAR Fast Tracks&quot; was released for the Game Boy at the same time.

==Legacy and Honors==
At the time of Elliott&#x27;s &quot;semi-retirement&quot;, he ranked 14th on NASCAR&#x27;s all-time win list with 44 wins. As of 2022, he ranks 19th on NASCAR&#x27;s all-time wins list. His 44 career wins does not include six exhibition wins, which include one &quot;Winston All-Star Race&quot; win in 1986, one &quot;Busch Clash&quot; win in 1987, and four Gatorade Twin 125 wins at Daytona in 1985, 1986, 1992, and 2000. He retired with 55 career poles, which ranks 8th on the all-time poles list. Elliott won seven crown jewel races in his career, two in the Daytona 500 (1985, 1987), three in the Southern 500 (1985, 1988, 1994), one in the Winston 500 (1985), and one in the Brickyard 400 (2002). The only crown jewel race Elliott failed to win was the World 600 (he had a pair of second-place finishes in 1982 and 1990).

The majority of Elliott&#x27;s success came in the 10 seasons from 1982 to 1991 with Melling Racing and owner Harry Melling, along with Bill&#x27;s two older brothers, crew chief and engine builder Ernie Elliott and transmission specialist Dan Elliott. Together, they won 34 of Bill&#x27;s 44 race wins, set numerous NASCAR records, won the Winston Million in 1985, and won the NASCAR Winston Cup Championship in 1988. Elliott was one of NASCAR&#x27;s most endearing and popular drivers in history, as Elliott went on to win NASCAR&#x27;s Most Popular Driver Award a NASCAR record 16 times (1984-1988, 1991-2000, 2002), a record nearly matched by Dale Earnhardt Jr. who won the award for 15 straight years from 2003 to 2017.

Elliott set numerous NASCAR records throughout his career, many of which still stand to this day. They include the following:
* Fastest qualifying speed at Daytona International Speedway; 1987 Daytona 500 - 210.364 MPH (338.548 km/h)
* Fastest qualifying speed at Talladega Superspeedway; 1987 Winston 500 - 212.809 MPH (342.483 km/h)
* Modern-era record of 11 superspeedway victories in one season; 11 in 1985
* Modern-era record of 4 season sweeps in one season; 1985 - Pocono, Michigan, Darlington, and Atlanta (The next closest is 3 season sweeps by Dale Earnhardt in 1987, at Bristol, Richmond, and Darlington and twice by Jimmie Johnson in 2004 at Charlotte, Darlington, and Atlanta, then once again in 2007 at Atlanta, Martinsville, and Richmond)
* 4 consecutive wins at one superspeedway; Michigan from 1985-1986 (Tied with Dale Earnhardt Jr. at Talladega from 2001-2003)
* Modern-era record 4 consecutive race wins; 1992 at Rockingham, Richmond, Atlanta and Darlington (Tied with Cale Yarborough in 1976, Darrell Waltrip in 1981, Dale Earnhardt in 1987, Harry Gant in 1991, Mark Martin in 1993, Jeff Gordon in 1998, and Jimmie Johnson in 2007)
* Most career Daytona 500 poles; 4 in 1985-1987, 2001 (Tied with Buddy Baker and Cale Yarborough)
* 3 consecutive Daytona 500 poles; 1985-1987 (Tied with Fireball Roberts 1961-1963 and Ken Schrader 1988-1990)

Bill Elliott is widely considered as one of the greatest and most well-respected racecar drivers, not only in NASCAR history, but in motorsports history as a whole. In 1998, Elliott was selected as one of NASCAR&#x27;s 50 Greatest Drivers in its history, and has been honored by being inducted into numerous racing and motorsports Halls of Fame. They include:
* Georgia Sports Hall of Fame inductee in 1998
* An inaugural inductee into the Georgia Racing Hall of Fame in 2002 (Along with Elliott, the inaugural Georgia Racing Hall of Fame Class of 2002 also included Red Byron, Tim Flock, Roy Hall, Raymond Parks, Lloyd Seay, Gober Sosebee, and Red Vogt). Elliott&#x27;s father George (Class of 2011), and his two older brothers Ernie (Class of 2010), and Dan (Class of 2018) would also become inductees into the Georgia Racing Hall of Fame.
* Motorsports Hall of Fame of America inductee in 2007
* National Motorsports Press Association Hall of Fame inductee in 2015
* NASCAR Hall of Fame Class of 2015 (inducted along with Fred Lorenzen, Wendell Scott, Joe Weatherly, and Rex White). Elliott was presented into the NASCAR Hall of Fame by his former Evernham Motorsports car owner, and future NASCAR Hall of Fame Class of 2018 inductee, Ray Evernham, and the driver who followed Bill in the famed #9 car, Kasey Kahne.
Elliott has been honored by the State of Georgia and the city of Dawsonville, Georgia in Dawson County with a number of roads renamed in honor of him and his family, as well as a date named in his honor.
* In 2005, the Georgia State Legislature declared October 8 (Elliott&#x27;s birthday) as Bill Elliott Day in the state of Georgia.
* In downtown Dawsonville, East 1st Street N &amp; S (North and South) was renamed &quot;Bill Elliott Street N &amp; S&quot;, which is also conveniently, where the famous Dawsonville Pool Room is located (at the address of &quot;9 Bill Elliott Street S&quot;), along with the infamous &quot;siren&quot; that traditionally went off when Bill Elliott won a race. Today, the tradition continues with Bill&#x27;s son Chase, as the siren goes off every time Chase wins a race.
* Elliott was also honored by the state legislature with a stretch of roadway (the entirety of Georgia State Route 183) in his native Dawson County renamed &quot;Elliott Family Parkway&quot;.
