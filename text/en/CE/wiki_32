<text>Livingston is a township in Essex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 31,330, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 1,964 (+6.7%) from 29,366 recorded at the 2010 census, which in turn reflected an increase of 1,975 (+7.2%) from the 27,391 counted in the 2000 census. In 2023, the Population Estimates Program by the United States Census Bureau calculated that the township had a population of 31,089.

Livingston was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 5, 1813, from portions of Caldwell Township (now Fairfield Township) and Springfield Township (now in Union County). Portions of the original township were later taken to form Fairmount (March 11, 1862, now part of West Orange) and Roseland (March 10, 1908).

The township was named for William Livingston, the first Governor of New Jersey; his family&#x27;s coat of arms served as the township&#x27;s seal for many years.

The community has been one of the state&#x27;s highest-income communities. Based on data from the American Community Survey for 2013–2017, township residents had a median household income of $153,381, ranked 14th in the state among municipalities with more than 10,000 residents, more than double the statewide median of $76,475.

==History==
Livingston&#x27;s history dates back to 1699 when 101 settlers from Newark wanted to move westward. They set up a committee to negotiate with Lenni Lenape Native Americans for the purchase of the Horseneck Tract which today includes Livingston and eight other municipalities in northern Essex County. Between 1698 and 1702, the rules for property ownership were unclear. There were many disputes between settlers and the English proprietors. For some unknown reasons, the Newark settlers did not obtain a grant from the proprietors before negotiating with the native tribes. They finally obtained the deed directly from Lenni Lenape in 1702 for £130. The settlements began until around the 1740s as the dispute between the proprietors and the settlers continued.

The dispute came to a breaking point in September 1745 when the East Jersey proprietors began to evict a settler only six months after a house fire in Newark completely destroyed the original deed, which was the only evidence of the purchase. During that period, William Livingston who was one of the few landed aristocrats joined the settlers against the proprietors. Livingston owned land around today&#x27;s south western corner of the Township of Livingston. His land, like other settlers, was levied with quit rents in the amount 40 shillings per acre. He defended many settlers who were jailed for refusing to pay the quit rents.

This series of events caused the settlers, led by Timothy Meeker, to form a group to riot against the British government. The Horseneck Riots lasted for 10 years from 1745 to 1755. The group was also one of the first colonial militia which had periodic battles for 32 years leading up to the Revolutionary War as the group joined the Continental Army in 1776.

After the American Revolutionary War, more permanent settlements took place with the first school built in 1783. In 1811, a petition was filed to incorporate the township from about 100 people who lived in seven distinct areas: Centerville (separated to become Roseland, in 1908), Cheapside (now Livingston Mall), Morehousetown (now Livingston Circle), Northfield (now Northfield Center), Squiretown (now the Cerebral Palsy Institute of New Jersey on Old Road), Teedtown (now Livingston Center), and Washington Place (now near the border with Millburn). On February 5, 1813, the township was officially incorporated. The first town meeting was held on the same day and they decided to run the township by a Township Committee system.

During the 1800s, lumber and farming were major industries in the town. Shoemaking and dairy farming became major industries during and after the Civil War. However, the population grew slowly because it was not easily accessible. Mt. Pleasant Avenue—which was one of the first turnpikes in New Jersey—was the only primary access to the town through stagecoaches.

The population grew quickly after the 1920s when automobiles became more accessible. As a suburb of Newark, the town experienced many housing developments especially after World War II with its peak in 1970 of more than thirty thousand residents. During this growth period, many services were organized including public library in 1916, volunteer Fire Department in 1922, first regular police chief in 1923, an ambulance unit in 1937 which became first aid squad in 1949. Some major relocations took place during this period of growing population shift. Cooperman Barnabas Medical Center (formerly Saint Barnabas Medical Center) and Newark Academy moved from Newark to Livingston in 1964.

The last surviving Harrison Cider Apple tree, the most famous of the 18th-century Newark cider apple trees, was rescued from extinction in 1976 in Livingston.

Today, around 30,000 people live in this suburban community, which lies around an hour&#x27;s drive from New York City. Its school system—which has been nationally recognized since 1998—and other programs have been drawing new residents to the town. Its population has maintained a level of diversity while the residents continue the tradition of community volunteerism.

<doc id="913720" wikidata="Q1665178" url="?curid=913720" title="Institute on Religion and Democracy">
<text>The Institute on Religion and Democracy (IRD) is an American Christian conservative think tank that promotes its views among mainline Protestant churches, as well as advocating for its values in the public square. Its critics claim that it has been instrumental in criticizing mainline Protestant denominations in the United States including the progressive United Methodist Church.

Founded in 1981, the institute&#x27;s primary focus through the 1980s was communism and their opposition to elements within mainline Protestantism that they perceived as supportive of communism. In more recent years, the IRD has turned their main purposes to the promotion of theological and political conservatism in mainline churches, particularly on issues of &quot;traditional&quot; sexual morality and support of Israel.

==Background==
The IRD was founded in 1981 by United Methodist evangelist Edmund Robb and AFL–CIO official David Jessup. Michael Novak and Richard John Neuhaus joined the IRD board early on, as did &quot;Christianity Today&quot; founding editor Carl F. H. Henry. Mark Tooley became IRD&#x27;s president in 2009.

The early focus of IRD was to identify Marxist tendencies in mainline Protestant churches and draw attention to attacks on religious liberty. IRD challenged churches that supported Marxist regimes such as the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua and Vietnam in the 1980s. In 1985, IRD co-sponsored a conference with Ronald Reagan&#x27;s administration, where speakers criticised the National Council of Churches for its efforts to develop contacts with church leaders in the Soviet Union.

Since the early 1990s, the IRD has actively urged American churches to affirm traditional Christian sexual ethical teachings, including opposition to same-sex marriage. IRD has also challenged mainline Protestant church agencies that support abortion rights. International religious liberty is a chief concern for the IRD, and their religious liberty program has especially focused on southern Sudan.

Since the September 11 attacks in 2001, IRD has emphasized the importance of Christian just war teachings. Most recently, IRD has challenged church officials who they say uncritically accept worst-case scenarios regarding human-induced climate change. The IRD focuses much of its attention on the policies of the United Methodist Church, the Episcopal Church and the Presbyterian Church (USA).

Notable members of the organization&#x27;s board of directors include journalist Fred Barnes, United Methodist theologian Thomas C. Oden, Princeton University ethicist Robert P. George, theologian Michael Novak and former papal biographer George Weigel.

==Criticism==
Chuck Currie, a progressive minister in the United Church of Christ, blogged that &quot;IRD&#x27;s conservative social-policy goals include increasing military spending and foreign interventions, opposing environmental protection efforts, and eliminating social welfare programs&quot; and that the organization is non-religious in nature and a front for conservative political groups that hope to undermine Christian voices opposed to conservative public policies. The IRD&#x27;s self-stated goals are, &quot;working to reaffirm the church&#x27;s biblical and historical teachings, strengthen and reform its role in public life, protect religious freedom, and renew democracy at home and abroad.&quot;

In their book &quot;Steeplejacking: How the Christian Right is Hijacking Mainstream Religion&quot;, United Church of Christ associate conference ministers John Dorhauer and Sheldon Culver accused the IRD of encouraging small groups of theologically conservative Christians to divide and then take over their mainline (UCC, Episcopalian and Presbyterian Church [USA]) congregations and lead them out of their respective denominations and into more conservative ones. The process, which they called &quot;steeplejacking&quot;, is allegedly done against the wishes of the majority of the original congregants. Though the authors of &quot;Steeplejacking&quot; point to a number of historical instances and facts to bolster their central argument, the IRD disputes this characterization of their activities and instead suggests that much of the book is based on circumstantial evidence, observations, and experience.

==Funding==

The IRD is funded by gifts from both foundations and individuals. IRD&#x27;s board includes Roman Catholics.

According to GuideStar, the Institute on Religion and Democracy generated $1.1 million in contributions in 2009.

Donors include the Scaife Foundations, the Bradley Foundation, the Olin Foundation and Howard and Roberta Ahmanson&#x27;s Fieldstead &amp; Company.

<text>Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life, alternatively Hillel International or simply Hillel, is the largest Jewish student organization in the world. Hillel brands itself as a safe space for pro-Israel Jewish students and events aimed at facilitating Jewish traditions on college campuses. Founded in 1923 and headquartered in the United States, it is represented at more than 850 higher education institutions and communities throughout Eurasia and the Americas, including 30 communities in the former Soviet Union, nine in Israel, and five in South America.
==History==

In 1923, Edward Chauncey Baldwin, Christian professor of Biblical literature at University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign was distressed by his Jewish students&#x27; lack of knowledge of the Hebrew Bible, and he discussed his concerns with Rabbi Benjamin Frankel.

Later the same year, members of the local Jewish and university communities met in a rented loft over a dry cleaner in Champaign, Illinois, and founded The Hillel Foundation.

In 1925, B&#x27;nai Brith pledged to sponsor Hillel&#x27;s activities with a budget of approximately $12,000 that year. By then, it encompassed 120 Hillel foundations and affiliates at an additional 400 campuses.

Beginning in 1988, under Director Richard M. Joel, Hillel underwent an organizational shift in mission and structure. An integral part of this shift was the institution of a Board of Governors, chaired by Edgar M. Bronfman until 2009 when he was succeeded by Randall Kaplan.

Bronfman&#x27;s involvement began in 1994 during a visit by Richard Joel to the Seagram building, when Bronfman pledged his support to Hillel. When Bronfman agreed to serve as chairman, Hillel gained legitimacy among other philanthropists. The subsequent revitalization of the organization resulted in increased donor support, updated programming, and broad international recognition. Part of the increased donor support came as a result of Bronfman&#x27;s well-known campus visits, beginning in 1994, that continued until his death in 2013.

Hillel has been described as the largest Jewish campus organization in the world. Hillel foundations are found in Israel, South America, and the Post-Soviet States, and affiliated organizations are found in 18 countries across North America, South America, Europe and the Middle East.

Although the foundation was not organized nationally until 1923, the Hillel at Texas A&amp;M University (at the time called the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas) was founded in 1916 by Prof. Jacob and Mrs. Esther Taubenhaus as the Menorah Club. The Menorah Club then chose to affiliate with the national organization in the 1920s.
Other notable Hillels include Hillel at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, the first Hillel in the world, Columbia/Barnard Hillel, and University of Pennsylvania Hillel, whose Steinhardt Hall is the largest Hillel International building of any college or university in the country.

In 1924, University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s first Jewish student organization was organized by Philadelphia branch of the United Synagogue of America, Conservative Judaism&#x27;s leading organization, and initially generically named the Jewish Students’ Association at Penn and then, after the 1929 death of Louis Marshall, the Chairman of the Board of conservative Judaism&#x27;s rabbinical college, Jewish Theological Seminary of America, it was renamed in his honor as the Louis Marshall Society but by January 1, 1944, when it merged with Hillel, it became known as Hillel and relocated to the “Jewish Students’ House” at 3613 Locust Street (at center of Penn&#x27;s campus) and served as a dormitory, Kosher dining room and a social center for Penn&#x27;s Jewish students.

=== Leadership ===
Adam Lehman was appointed CEO of Hillel International in January 2020. He started at Hillel International as chief operating officer in October 2015. Lehman had been senior vice president at AOL. Skip Vichness is chair of Hillel International’s Board of Directors. Mimi Kravetz was hired in 2015 to serve as Chief Talent Officer and is currently Chief Experience Officer. She previously served as head of human resources marketing at Google.

Hillel International Presidents and CEOs have included Rabbi Benjamin Frankel (1925–1927); Abram L. Sachar (1933–1948); Richard M. Joel (1988–2003); Wayne Firestone (2005–2013); and Eric Fingerhut (2013–2020).

==Activities==
Hillel International says its mission is “enriching the lives of Jewish students so that they may enrich the Jewish people and the world” through its on-campus network. More than 800 colleges and universities are connected to a local Hillel community that serves as a faith community, a Jewish educational resource and a social network to develop professional leadership skills. Hillel uses a &quot;relationship-based model&quot; to engage students in need of a community. Hillel has no denominational affiliation, as opposed to Chabad which represents Hasidic Judaism.

Hillel employs more than 1,200 people worldwide, while providing extensive continuing education for its employees via a professional development program called the &quot;Hillel U&quot;. The organization also invests in early career professionals through the Springboard Fellowship. From 2011 to 2020, Hillel doubled its professional staff, from 575 to 1,200; the amount of funds raised, from around $90 million to about $185 million; and the number of students it reaches, from roughly 68,000 to over 140,000.

In September 2024, the organization launched the &quot;Campus for All&quot; initiative to support Jewish students on taking &quot;action against antisemitism, discrimination, and misinformation about Israel on campus&quot;, alongside the &quot;MitzVote&quot; initiative to encourage voter registration ahead of the 2024 U.S. elections. In particular, this initiative aimed at resisting 2024 pro-Palestinian student protests that supported a Gaza ceasefire, Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, or anti-Zionism.

==Policy positions==

=== Antisemitism ===
Adam Lehman, Hillel International’s president and CEO, has called his organization &quot;radically pluralistic, inclusive, egalitarian home for Jewish students coming from all different backgrounds&quot;.

Hillel provides security training to local Hillels and engages in dialogue with university administrations about how to recognize and confront anti-Semitism on campus. Critics have suggested that Hillel conflates anti-Zionism with antisemitism.

===Intermarriage===
Former Hillel president Avraham Infeld was challenged in traditional circles for asserting that Hillel accepts Jewish intermarriage. The organization has since created resources for Hillel professionals to work with students from multi-faith homes. Hillel supports LGBTQ people and pluralism across the spectrum of Jewish movements.

===Zionism===
Hillel has extensive pro-Israel programming and employs post-graduate fellows from Israel from the Jewish Agency for Israel. Hillel is a major partner of the Birthright Israel program.

Hillel describes themselves as &quot;steadfastedly committed to the support of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state with secure and recognized borders.&quot;
Their Standards of Partnership forbid campus Hillels to &quot;partner with, house or host organizations, groups or speakers&quot; that adopt an anti-Zionist orientation or express support for the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. The organization imposes restrictions on activities; Hillel takes a firm stance in opposing certain types of views on Israel, such as the BDS campaign, and those who hold them.

==== Open Hillel ====
In an alleged effort to be &quot;more inclusive to a greater diversity of Jewish perspectives in addition to Zionism&quot;, Swarthmore College Hillel adopted an &quot;Open Hillel&quot; stance in 2013, saying that &quot;all are welcome to walk through our doors and speak with our name and under our roof, be they Zionist, anti-Zionist, post-Zionist, or non-Zionist.&quot; 
By 2016, the campus Hillels of Guilford College, Vassar College, and Wesleyan University had joined Swarthmore Hillel in declaring themselves &quot;open.&quot; Part of this involved a rejection of Hillel International&#x27;s Standards of Partnership that they alleged to limit open dialogue and freedom of speech.

In March 2015, Swarthmore Hillel held an event called &quot;From Mississippi to Jerusalem: A Conversation with Civil Rights Veterans&quot; in which they brought three Jewish veterans of the Civil Rights Movement to discuss their efforts to promote civil rights in the American South and in Israel-Palestine. Because the speakers had voiced support for BDS, Hillel International threatened legal action against Swarthmore Hillel, with the Chief Executive Officer Eric Fingerhut saying that &quot;anti-Zionists will not be permitted to speak using the Hillel name or under the Hillel roof, under any circumstances.&quot; The student group removed the word &quot;Hillel&quot; from its title in order to proceed with the planned event, and subsequently adopted the name &quot;Swarthmore Kehilah&quot;, severing its association with Hillel.

In February 2014, the Vassar College Jewish Union, an affiliate of Hillel, joined Swarthmore Hillel in declaring themselves to be an Open Hillel, and Wesleyan University&#x27;s Hillel followed suit. Alumni at the University of California, Berkeley have also created a petition calling upon their school to do the same. In response to Open Hillel, a group of students formed Safe Hillel in 2014 to preserve the pro-Israel agenda of the original Hillel organization. According to its founder Raphael Fils, &quot;Hillel should not have to change its mission in order to accommodate those who don&#x27;t agree with it. Hillel is the one place students are supposed to feel entirely comfortable in their support of Israel. If that makes some people uncomfortable, there are plenty of other places to go just to hear attacks on Israel.&quot;

While Hillels at Vassar and Guilford Colleges sought to distance themselves from the allegedly &quot;explicit Zionism&quot; of Hillel International, with Guilford Hillel renaming itself to Guilford Chavurah (&quot;group of friends&quot; in Hebrew) and Vassar Jewish Union placing an emphasis on pluralism and diversity, they did not go as far as the Swarthmore and Wesleyan Hillels did in choosing to fully split from the organization. Both Guilford and Vassar are still listed as &quot;Hillel colleges.&quot;

==Controversies==

=== General ===
Some Jewish members and leaders of Hillels have criticized and objected to the organization&#x27;s use of the motto &quot;Wherever we stand, we stand with Israel&quot; for &quot;alienating Jewish students critical of Israeli policies, as well as for attaching a political ideology to an otherwise apolitical religious and cultural organization&quot;. Hillel was also accused of employing monopolistic tactics to &quot;assume control over the Jewish campus scene&quot;.

In November 2013, Harvard Hillel barred Avraham Burg, a former Speaker of the Israeli Knesset, from speaking at Hillel due to the event&#x27;s co-sponsorship by the pro-BDS Harvard Palestinian Solidarity Committee. Harvard Hillel has been accused by critics of &quot;a naked attack on free speech.&quot;

In January 2016, Boston University Hillel hosted a public event called &quot;All Students, All Israel Think Tank&quot; which included sections on how to &quot;combat BDS.&quot; The event was advertised to the entire student body and had an optional advance registration. Nine members of Students for Justice in Palestine showed up to the event, but were removed by campus police.&quot;

In April 2016, the San Francisco chapter of Hillel hosted a talk by Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat at San Francisco State University. Students opposing the Hillel accused Barkat&#x27;s of previously &quot;encouraging demolitions&quot; of Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem while protesting the event. Hillel characterized the protests as antisemitic, which was disputed by an independent investigation.

In March 2017, a queer Jewish student organization called &quot;B’nai Keshet&quot; (“Children of the Rainbow”) affiliated with the Ohio State University Hillel hosted an on-campus fundraising event for refugees in partnership with the local chapter of Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP), an anti-Zionist Jewish organization. Hillel cut all financial and organizational ties with B&#x27;nai Keshet following the event, explaining that it violated the &quot;Hillel International Standards of Partnership&quot; due to JVP&#x27;s pro-BDS stance.

In September 2021, the Graduate and Professional Student Senate at Virginia Tech proposed a resolution demanding the university to divest from Israel. The proposers accused the Hillel at Virginia Tech of &quot;harassing&quot; the resolution&#x27;s supporters, despite its exercise of freedom of speech as protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

In November 2023, an independent contractor associated with the British Columbia chapter of Hillel distributed stickers that read &quot;I [heart] Hamas&quot; on the University of British Columbia&#x27;s Vancouver campus. The stickers included the name and logo of the UBC Social Justice Centre, a pro-Palestine student organization, on the stickers, falsely attributing the sticker to them. The stickers resulted in threats being made against racialized students associated with the Social Justice Centre, including attempts to find out where individual students live. Upon the stickers&#x27; publication on social media, conservative politicians including former Conservative Senator Linda Frum and director of the BC Conservative Party Angelo Isidorou condemned the Social Justice Centre and called for actions to be taken against its members. Hillel BC later confirmed that its &quot;independent contractor&quot; was responsible for the stickers, and that Hillel had terminated its relationship with them. The Social Justice Centre subsequently sued Hillel BC for defamation of character.

=== Specific ===
In March 2015, the Student Board President of Muhlenberg College&#x27;s Hillel resigned over Hillel&#x27;s &quot;refusal to sponsor Open Hillel&#x27;s Caroline Dorn&quot;, protesting Hillel&#x27;s &quot;refusal to allow civil rights veterans to speak at Hillel&quot;, said in her resignation: &quot;I can&#x27;t be a representative of Hillel International, an organization that I feel is limiting free speech on our campus and prohibiting academic integrity.&quot; The event was held without the sponsorship of Hillel and had an estimated 100 attendees.

In 2014, some members of Princeton University Hillel, known as the Center for Jewish Life, criticized executive director Rabbi Julie Roth for sending a mass email that encouraged Hillel members to oppose a petition by some tenured Princeton faculty members demanding the university to divest from companies that profit from the &quot;occupation of the West Bank by Israel.&quot; 38 Jewish Princeton students wrote an open letter accusing the group of expecting its members to oppose the petition unquestioningly. The students&#x27; letter was published in the campus newspaper, &quot;The Daily Princetonian&quot;, also objected to the group&#x27;s prohibition of member-chapters from hosting discussion with groups or individuals supporting the BDS movement.

In 2006, a George Washington Law School student organized an on-campus rally to call for the disinvestment from Israel. In response, the director of George Washington University Hillel Robert Fishman claimed that the rally&#x27;s organizer was deemed a terrorist by Israel, had been convicted of crimes in both Israel and the United States, advocating for the destruction of Israel, admitting to associations with suicide bombers and had made comments about his desire to become a suicide bomber.

Robert Fishman arranged a group of his members to read out questions to former President Jimmy Carter who spoke on campus in March 2007. Individuals opposing the Hillel accused the group&#x27;s activities of giving the media the &quot;false impression&quot; that the audience was &quot;critical&quot; of Carter, despite them exercising their right to protest.

UCLA Hillel rabbi and director Chaim Seidler-Feller was accused by journalist Rachel Neuwirth of &quot;assaulting&quot; her on the UCLA campus in October 2003. Eyewitness accounts were contradictory, with some indicating that Neuwirth did not provoke the incident, but others insinuating that she had. After over three years of litigation, Seidler-Feller reportedly provided Neuwirth with a letter of apology accepting responsibility for the alleged attack on Neuwirth in a legal settlement to end the dispute.

<text>The Committee for Peace and Security in the Gulf (CPSG), formed in 1990 to support president George H. W. Bush’s campaign to drive Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait, was a bipartisan group whose members were active in U.S. foreign-policy circles. &quot;The 39-member group…[included] former U.S. Rep. Stephen Solarz of New York, who was a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Richard Perle, a former assistant defense secretary for international security policy.&quot;

Other members included Tony Coelho, Ann Lewis, Robert G. Torricelli, Richard G. Lugar, Howard H. Baker Jr., Frank C. Carlucci, and Jeane J. Kirkpatrick.

==Open Letter to President Clinton==
At a Washington, DC news conference in February 1998, Solarz read a letter from the CPSG addressed to president Bill Clinton, urging more decisive action against Iraqi president Saddam Hussein. &quot;Despite his defeat in the Gulf War, continuing sanctions, and the determined effort of UN inspectors to fetter out and destroy his weapons of mass destruction&quot;, read the open letter, &quot;Saddam Hussein has been able to develop biological and chemical munitions&quot;. The letter continued, &quot;the United States has tried to remove Saddam by encouraging coups and internal conspiracies. These attempts have all failed. Saddam is more wily, brutal and conspiratorial than any likely conspiracy the United States might mobilize against him. Saddam must be overpowered; he will not be brought down by a coup d&#x27;etat. But Saddam has an Achilles’ heel: lacking popular support, he rules by terror [and is] hated by his own people and the rank and file of his military. Iraq today is ripe for a broad-based insurrection. We must exploit this opportunity.&quot;

Detailing a plan of action, the letter urged Clinton to recognize a provisional government based on the Iraqi National Congress with a restored safe haven in northern Iraq — financed by release of frozen Iraqi assets &quot;to the control of the provisional government to fund its insurrection&quot;. It further urged Clinton to &quot;launch a systematic air campaign against the pillars of Saddam’s power — the Republican Guard divisions which prop him up and the military infrastructure that sustains him&quot;, and to &quot;position U.S. ground force equipment in the region so that, as a last resort, we have the capacity to protect and assist the anti-Saddam forces in the northern and southern parts of Iraq&quot;.

In a report on the news conference and open letter, CNN correspondent John King asserted that &quot;U.S. law and international opposition to such a plan would make it unlikely.&quot;

<text>Simon Black (born 3 April 1979) is a former Australian rules football player and current assistant coach, who played his whole career with the Brisbane Lions in the Australian Football League (AFL).

Black was a midfielder with a reputation for hard work and skill. He had the ability to get under the pack to retrieve the ball as well as deliver it with precision to teammates.

He was drafted by the Brisbane Lions in 1997 from the East Fremantle Football Club, and he debuted in the first game of the 1998 season and quickly became one of Brisbane&#x27;s best players. He became Brisbane’s third Brownlow Medallist by winning the much-coveted award in 2002 by a four-vote margin. He also won the 2003 Norm Smith Medal and the 2001, 2002, and 2006 Merrett–Murray Medals awarded to the best and fairest player with the Brisbane Lions and three premiership medallions he received as a part of the Lions&#x27; hat-trick of premierships in 2001, 2002 and 2003. Black, along with Michael Voss (1996 Brownlow Medallist), Jason Akermanis (2001 Brownlow Medallist) and Nigel Lappin were collectively known as &#x27;The Fab Four&#x27; and are widely considered to be one of the best midfield combinations in the history of the game.

Black is currently serving as the Contest Skills and Midfield Coach at the Brisbane Lions.

==Background==
Born in Mount Isa, Queensland, to Western Australian mother and father Ray a dairy farmer of Kaitaia in New Zealand. He relocated to Western Australia with his family at a very young age, where he attended school at Corpus Christi College in Bateman and Aquinas College, Perth. Nurtured by his father, Black initially played rugby union with dreams of being an All Black thanks to his New Zealand heritage but later took up Australian rules. He was a standout junior 800m and 1500m runner as a junior. At age 15 he suffered a back injury that required him to not play football for 18 months. He joined East Fremantle Football Club and represented Western Australia in the 1997 edition of the AFL Under-18 Championships, where he earned All-Australian honours. He was a member of East Fremantle&#x27;s losing 1997 WAFL Grand Final team. Black was drafted by the Brisbane Lions with the 31st selection in the 1997 National Draft.

==Playing career==

===Early career===
Black was impressive during the 1998 pre-season and earned his senior debut in Round 1 against the Western Bulldogs at the Gabba. He played nine senior matches and averaged over 12 disposals during his debut season and took out the Club’s Best First Year Player award. In 1999, he consolidated himself as an automatic senior selection and built a reputation for winning the ball in contested situations. He collected 20 possessions and kicked two goals against Geelong in Round 9 which earned him an AFL Rising Star Nomination; he ultimately finished third in the award behind Sydney’s Adam Goodes and Adelaide’s Brett Burton. He played 22 matches for the season and averaged close to 19 disposals and won the Lions&#x27; Rookie of the Year award for the second consecutive season. In 2000, he averaged 23.9 disposals per game, led the competition in centre clearances on a per game basis and finished second behind Geelong’s Garry Hocking in hard-ball gets.

===Premiership era===
Black became one of the league&#x27;s elite midfielders from 2001. Over the following four years, Black and the Lions contested four Grand Finals, winning the premiership in 2001, 2002 and 2003, and finishing runner-up in 2004. During that time, Black was part of a Brisbane midfield combination which is considered to be one of the best in the league&#x27;s history: Black, Michael Voss, Jason Akermanis and Nigel Lappin, who became known collectively as the &quot;Fab Four&quot;.

In 2001, Black played every match for the season, led the AFL in tackles and averaged a team-high 24.6 possessions. He was joint Club Champion with Captain Michael Voss, was named as the starting ruck-rover in the All-Australian team, finished 5th in the AFLPA&#x27;s Most Valuable Player award, and won the Herald Sun Player of the Year award. He represented Australia for the first and only time of his career in the 2001 International Rules Series against Ireland.

In 2002, Black won the Brownlow Medal, polling 25 votes to beat second-placed Josh Francou by four votes, and comparisons were made between him and dual Brownlow Medallist Greg Williams because of his outstanding peripheral vision and ability to get the contested ball. He earned All-Australian selection and won the Merrett–Murray Medal for the second consecutive season. He was strong again in 2003, and won the Norm Smith Medal as best on ground in the Grand Final with a career-best 39 possessions, the most ever recorded by any player in a Grand Final – it remained the sole highest until it was eventually equalled by Christian Petracca&#x27;s performance in 2021.

In 2004, Black became a vice-captain of the Lions, and he won All-Australian selection for the third time in his career. At the end of the season, Black had played a sequence of 107 consecutive matches for Brisbane, before a suspension in the violent 2004 AFL Grand Final ended the sequence.

===Later career===
Black&#x27;s 2005 season was interrupted by injury, but in 2006 he played every match, and won the third Merrett–Murray Medal of his career. At the beginning of 2007, Black was named as one of the four Lions co-captains, replacing the retiring captain Michael Voss. In 2007 and 2008, Black continued to be Brisbane&#x27;s premier midfielder, and he finished second in the Brownlow Medal in both seasons. He earned Brisbane Lions Life Membership at the end of his tenth season of service. He was also the Courier Mail Player of the Year in 2008, and was runner-up in the 2008 Merrett–Murray medal.

In 2009, new coach Michael Voss named Jonathan Brown as the sole captain of the club, and Black remained in the leadership group. He had another consistent season in 2010, finishing second in the Merrett–Murray Medal. In 2012, Black played his 300th AFL game, becoming the first player in league history to win a Brownlow Medal, a Norm Smith Medal, a Premiership Medal and play 300 games.

In 2013, Black equalled Marcus Ashcroft&#x27;s record for the most games played for the Brisbane Bears/Lions playing his 318th game. His final game was the round 21 match against at the Gabba after which he was suspended for one match for striking Giants captain Callan Ward in the final quarter.

On 18 October 2013, Black announced his retirement from the AFL.

==Coaching career==
Shortly after announcing his retirement from the AFL, Black signed on as an assistant coach at the Lions for two years. His main focus is coaching the team&#x27;s forward line and attacking systems.
In 2016, Black founded the Simon Black Australian Rules Academy, a full time sport and educational program which provides pathways for students to pursue University and Fitness qualifications while training and playing AFL in an elite academy environment. He subsequently resigned from his role as a coach at the Brisbane Lions to focus on growing the Academy program.

==Media career==
In August 2019, Black joined &quot;10 News First Queensland&quot; as an AFL analyst.

In 2019, Black competed in the fourth season of &quot;Australian Survivor&quot;. He was eliminated on Day 42 and finished in 7th place.

<doc id="913729" wikidata="Q5122765" url="?curid=913729" title="Citizens for a Free Kuwait">
<text>Citizens for a Free Kuwait (CFK) was an astroturf operation established by the Kuwaiti government to persuade the American public to look favourably at US military action in the Persian Gulf (the subsequent Operation Desert Storm). Its principal payment was to public relations firm Hill &amp; Knowlton, who was associated with the false testimony to the US Congress given by Nayirah al-Ṣabaḥ.

==Congressional Human Rights Caucus==

In October 1990 Nayirah, a teenage girl, testified before the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, that she had seen Iraqi soldiers remove hundreds of Kuwaiti babies from incubators and leave them to die on hospital floors. The chairmen of the congressional group explained that the witness&#x27;s identity would be kept secret to protect her family in occupied Kuwait. President George H. W. Bush cited the incubator story six times in speeches and seven senators cited the story as a reason for voting to give the Bush administration authorization for the Gulf War. The atrocities of the Iraqis in Kuwait were compared to that of the Nazis.

==Investigations==
After the Liberation of Kuwait campaign, an ABC News reporter interviewed hospital doctors who stayed in Kuwait throughout the Iraqi occupation and indicated that the story was almost certainly false. Subsequent investigation showed that unknown to most members of the Caucus, the 15-year-old Kuwait girl was the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to the United States, Saud bin Nasir Al-Sabah. As one reporter observed, such knowledge might have led to demands of proof of Nayirah&#x27;s whereabouts when she said she witnessed the atrocities and calls for corroboration of the story.

The congressmen co-chairing the committee, who knew the true identity of the teen-age witness, had close relationships with Hill and Knowlton, the public relations firm hired by Citizens for a Free Kuwait, the group financed by Kuwait which lobbied for Congress for U.S. military intervention. A vice president of Hill and Knowlton helped organize the congressional hearings. The same Hill &amp; Knowlton vice president had previously defended the human rights record of Turkey, which had been criticized for jailing people without due process and torturing and killing them. He also lobbied for Hill &amp; Knowlton on behalf of Indonesia, which has, since 1975, killed more than 100,000 people in East Timor.

A video of Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait was the second most used PR video release in 1990, with 61 million viewers. It was produced by Hill &amp; Knowlton for Citizens for a Free Kuwait.

==Response from Hill &amp; Knowlton==
In a letter of rebuttal, the president and CEO of Hill &amp; Knowlton, Thomas E. Eidson, wrote that the firm had not at any time collaborated with anyone to produce knowingly deceptive testimony, that Nayirah was inside Kuwait at the time in question and had volunteered to work under an assumed name at the Al-Adan Hospital, and that the United States embassy confirmed that she was in Kuwait at the time. He also cited testimony to the United Nations by the head of the Kuwaiti Red Crescent citing firsthand involvement in burying newborn babies taken from their incubators by soldiers.

<doc id="913733" wikidata="Q7182932" url="?curid=913733" title="Philanthropy Roundtable">
<text>The Philanthropy Roundtable is a nonprofit organization that advises conservative philanthropists and advocates for donor privacy.

==History==
The Roundtable was founded in 1987 as a project of the now-defunct Institute For Educational Affairs. It was founded as a conservative alternative to the Council on Foundations, a nonprofit membership association of donors. Membership in the organization was free &quot;to interested grant makers&quot;, and 140 foundations, charities and nonprofits joined in the Roundtable&#x27;s first year. 

In 1991, Philanthropy Roundtable became an independent entity with its own board of directors and staff, headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana. The Philanthropy Roundtable is a 501(c)(3) organization. It has been described as conservative and non-partisan.

DonorsTrust, founded in 1999, and Donors Capital Fund have been described as spinoffs of the Philanthropy Roundtable.

In 2005, Philanthropy Roundtable created the Alliance For Charitable Reform (ACR), which opposes legislation that would create accreditation requirements for grant-making foundations, establish a five-year Internal Revenue Service review of tax-exempt status, or restrict the ability of donors to establish family foundations.

The organization has a bimonthly newsletter, &quot;Philanthropy&quot;, which evolved into a quarterly magazine in 2011. In 2016, the Roundtable published the &quot;Almanac of American Philanthropy&quot;, a reference book that summarizes the history, purposes, effects, and modern direction of private giving.

===William E. Simon Prize===

In 2007, the William E. Simon Foundation named the Roundtable the administrator of the William E. Simon Prize for Philanthropic Leadership. Recipients of the prize since the Roundtable&#x27;s administration of it include Bernie Marcus, Eli Broad, Charles Koch, Roger Hertog, Philip Anschutz and his wife Nancy, S. Truett Cathy, and Frank Hanna III.

==Leadership==
Kimberly Dennis was the organization&#x27;s first executive director. She served as executive director from 1991 through 1996. John P. Walters assumed administrative leadership of the organization in the new role of president in 1997 when the organization moved its headquarters to Washington, D.C. Walters remained in that position until resigning in October 2001 to accept an appointment by George W. Bush as director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. Adam Meyerson served as the organization&#x27;s president from 2001 to 2020. In June 2020, he was replaced by Elise Westhoff, who was named president and chief executive officer. In October 2023, Christie Herrera was promoted to president and CEO.

<text>Juleanna Ruth Glover (born September 27, 1969) is an American corporate public affairs consultant, entrepreneur, former Republican lobbyist, and political strategist. She is founder and CEO of Ridgely Walsh, a public and governmental affairs agency that advises Silicon Valley companies, including Google, Snap, Oracle, eBay, First Solar, Uber, and SpaceX.

As a lobbyist, Glover is widely considered one of the most powerful women in Washington. A former spokesperson for James Murdoch and an advisor to Elon Musk, she was called the &quot;mogul whisperer&quot; by &quot;The New York Times.&quot;

==Early career==
Glover received her B.A. from Marymount University in 1991 and M.P.A. from George Mason University in 1993. Glover also studied at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, D.C.

Glover started working for Senator John Ashcroft (R-Missouri) in 1996 when he was a freshman senator and helped him explore a bid for the 2000 presidential election. Ashcroft chose not to run for president, so Glover became press secretary for businessman Steve Forbes, whose campaign ended before the Republican Party convention.

Glover also worked for Bill Kristol, Vice President Dan Quayle, former Senator and Energy Secretary Spence Abraham, and conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly. Glover worked in the Jesse Helms for North Carolina campaign and the Rudolph W. Giuliani U.S. Senate exploratory committee, where she worked in the months following her first child&#x27;s birth.

Glover also worked as the Publicity Director for &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;; and as legislative director for the Project for the Republican Future.

==White House service==
Ms. Glover served as senior staff for President George W. Bush and as Press Secretary for Vice President Dick Cheney. Glover also served as the registered government affairs advisor for Iraq&#x27;s first post-Saddam Hussein ambassador to the United States, Samir Sumaidaie. She is a former term member of the Council on Foreign Relations.

After leaving the White House, Glover was a Resident Fellow at Harvard University&#x27;s Institute of Politics in 2002 and has lectured on the future of the Republican Party at Princeton University&#x27;s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.

== Private sector ==
Glover has worked as a public affairs consultant since leaving the White House in 2002. Glover was a Director at Clark &amp; Weinstock, one of the top public and government affairs firms in the country. She then co-founded the Ashcroft Group, LLC along with former U.S. Attorney General, John Ashcroft.

In 2007, Glover was a senior advisor in Senator John McCain&#x27;s 2008 bid for the White House, traveling with him throughout the primary season.

In 2015 and 2021, &quot;Washingtonian&quot; magazine listed Glover as one of Washington&#x27;s most powerful women, as did &quot;Elle&quot; in 2012. In 2011, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Glover as the &quot;consummate political insider&quot;, and in 2012, &quot;Bloomberg News&quot; described in her profile: &quot;[S]he brings Washington power players together in a way others can’t match. If you’re looking for the right introduction in D.C., you need to know Juleanna Glover.&quot;

In 2013, Glover was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the U.S. Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage via the Hollingsworth v. Perry case. Also that year, Ms. Glover became Managing Director of Teneo Intelligence. In accordance with Teneo&#x27;s policy of not engaging in lobbying activity, Glover fully deregistered as a lobbyist prior to joining.

In early 2015, Glover transitioned to a senior advisor at Teneo Holdings and began work at her new firm, The Office of Juleanna Glover, with a full transition in January 2016.

In May 2018, leaked notes written by Paul Manafort indicated that Glover had been mentioned at the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting.

In 2018, she founded Ridgely Walsh, a public affairs firm in DC. The firm is known to advise some of the most important technology companies in the world. After Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, it started providing pro bono PR assistance for Ukraine as well. The firm&#x27;s senior director and Ukrainian national Veronika Velch (V. Kruglashova) worked to connect members of the media with Ukrainian citizens and government officials. &quot;We’re honored to support our longtime Ukrainian colleague in her volunteer work to help her country,&quot; Glover told Politico on the matter.

Glover serves on the board of directors for several organizations, including: FREOPP, Take Back Our Republic group to reduce the political influence of big donors, the Climate Leadership Council, and Biden Institute. She also serves on the Membership Committee for The Economic Club of Washington, DC.

Glover is a regular public policy commentator on cable news shows, including Squawk Box on CNBC, Fox &amp; Friends on Fox News, and Martin Bashir on MSNBC. Her opinion pieces have been published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Politico&quot;, &quot;Forbes&quot;, and &quot;The National Review&quot;, among others.

== Personal life ==
Glover has four children. Formerly married to Jeffrey Weiss, she was divorced in 2009. 

She endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

<text>Timothy John Staffell (born 24 February 1948) is an English rock musician, visual artist, model maker and designer. He was a member of Smile, a band that included guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor. Upon Staffell&#x27;s departure, Smile were joined by Freddie Mercury and Mike Grose and later John Deacon to form the band Queen.

==Early life and music career==
Timothy John Staffell was born in Isleworth, Middlesex, England. He attended Hampton Grammar School and was the singer in a band called the Railroaders when in 1964 he attended a concert where he met fellow Hampton pupil Brian May. They then put together a blues-rock band called &#x27;1984&#x27; with John Garnham (guitar), Dave Dilloway (bass), John Sanger (keyboards) and Richard Thompson (drums). In 1965, Staffell began a graphics and drawing course at Ealing Art College where he became friends with Freddie Mercury, while May enrolled at Imperial College, London. 1984 had been a support act for Jimi Hendrix and Pink Floyd prior to Staffell’s departure in 1968, shortly following May’s.

Staffell and May then put together a new band called Smile with Roger Taylor who auditioned to be their drummer. Staffell and May co-wrote the song &quot;Doing All Right&quot;, which Queen included on their eponymous debut album. Following his tenure with Smile, Staffell joined Humpy Bong and then the experimental progressive rock outfit Morgan, with whom he released the albums &quot;Nova Solis&quot; and &quot;Brown Out&quot; (later retitled &quot;The Sleeper Wakes&quot;).

==Model maker, designer and animator==
Staffell later decided to pursue a career as a model maker, designer, animator and commercials director. Among the projects upon which he worked were the BBC television adaptation of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; and he was the chief model maker for the first series of the children&#x27;s TV show &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine &amp; Friends&quot;.

Later Staffell worked as the Head of Construction at one of the UKs leading Drama Schools Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts, where he imparted his design and model making skills to the future generations of designers and builders.

==Return to music==
In 2001, Staffell returned to the music industry, co-forming with long-time collaborator Richard Lightman a new blues / funk band called aMIGO, drawing inspiration from folk, Latin and rock. In 2003 they released one eponymous album, with re-recorded versions of the old Smile tunes &quot;Earth&quot; and &quot;Doin&#x27; Alright&quot;, featuring his former bandmate Brian May on guitars and vocals. The album was self released and available on CD-R for a limited release run (less than 300 copies) and later released via iTunes.

In April 2018, Staffell was invited to record his part of the song &quot;Doin&#x27; Alright&quot; alongside the other Smile members, Brian May and Roger Taylor, for the upcoming soundtrack to the movie &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, which tells the life story of Queen. The song was credited to Smile, and titled &quot;Doing All Right ... Revisited&quot;. The music score was released on 19 October 2018, and the movie premiere was three days later. The soundtrack debuted on the UK albums chart at number 5 on 26 October 2018.

The second Tim Staffell album &quot;Two Late&quot; was released on digital platforms on 26 October 2018, and it will be followed with physical limited release in the middle of November. In July 2019, &#x27;aMIGO’ was re-released (with a live studio version of the song &#x27;Just Couldn&#x27;t Say) as a Remastered Special Edition CD by MOSCODISC with a new digipack sleeve.

In late 2019/early 2020, together with Paul Stewart, who had previously worked with the British Rhythm &amp; Blues band &#x27;The Others&#x27;, Staffell recorded an album &quot;How High&quot; under the band name of Staffell &amp; Stewart; containing a mixture of original material and reimagined rhythm and blues classics.

In September 2021 Staffell travelled to Barcelona to record his third solo album, &quot;Wayward Child&quot;, at Room To Studios along with his son Andrew. The album is scheduled to be released in 2023, with the first single, &#x27;The Sinner&#x27;, being released on 24 February, Tim&#x27;s 75th birthday.

<doc id="913740" wikidata="Q717111" url="?curid=913740" title="Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross">
<text>is a Japanese science fiction mecha anime TV series released in 1984, as the third of the Super Dimension series. It was adapted as &quot;The Masters Saga&quot; or the &quot;Second Generation&quot; of the American TV series &quot;Robotech&quot;.

==Plot==
In the year 2120, humanity has left the Solar System and started the colonization of other planets. One of the farthest colonies is located on the terraformed planet Glorie. The powerful army of the Southern Cross protects the colonists there from any unknown dangers. However, unbeknownst to the humans, Glorie is also the ancestral home of the Zor, a highly advanced race of nomadic humanoid aliens who have returned to reclaim their world.

===Characters===

====Main characters====
 (Michie Tomizawa): At 17 years of age, Jeanne finds herself the leader of the 15th Squad in the Southern Cross&#x27; Alpha Tactics Armored Corps (ATAC). A native from the planet Liberté, Jeanne has a tendency to follow her heart and act rashly. Her superiors consider her to be an embarrassment to the army because they feel that she does not take her duty seriously. Her frequent disregard for protocol, orders, and regulations continually lands her in solitary confinement, often placed there by Lt. Lana Isavia. Fortunately she always manages to be let out when needed. Jeanne develops a romantic interest in Seifriet Weiße, but his reaction is one of puzzlement and disdain. Most of the series revolves around Jeanne&#x27;s escapades with the 15th Squad, and her increasingly personal war with the invading Zor.

In &quot;Robotech&quot;, her name was changed to Dana Sterling.

 (Kumiko Mizukura): Nicknamed the &quot;Cosmo Amazon&quot;, Marie represents the model soldier. She was once the leader of a biker gang and has also an aptitude for machines. Despite her tough exterior, she still feels intensely, and begins a rocky relationship with the womanizer Charles De L&#x27;Étoile. As a capable leader, Marie is often the one to snap Jeanne out of her periodic episodes of shock or indecision, usually with a slap to the face. Marie leads her own unit within the Tactics Armored Space Corps (TASC), in which she is also an ace pilot.

 (Mika Doi): The third central woman of the Southern Cross. At 19, Lana is the youngest military police officer on Glorie, and one of the highest-ranking. Like Marie, she is quite different from Jeanne, taking her duties very seriously and allowing no compromises regarding protocol and regulations. Her rivalry with Jeanne can be viewed as a subtle game of &quot;cat and mouse&quot;. In the beginning of the series, Lana appears to be colder and less personable than Marie. But as the story progresses, it is revealed that she is an even bigger romantic than Jeanne. Her military training eventually conflicts with her passionate emotions, and she is forced to choose between her duty to the Southern Cross and her friendship with the 15th Squad.

====Other characters====
 (Arihiro Hase): Bowie is a private first class assigned to the 15th Squad at the age of 16. Due to his father&#x27;s influence, he was pressured to join the military even though he is a pacifist more interested in composing music rather than fighting.

In &quot;Robotech&quot;, his name was changed to Bowie Grant.

 (Yūichi Meguro): He is the dutiful sergeant of the 15th Squad, occasionally acting as leader in the absence of a superior officer. He has served longer than anyone else in the 15th Squad, but his conventional mindset is sometimes at odds with his new commanding officer, Jeanne Fránçaix. In &quot;Robotech&quot;, his name was changed to Angelo Dante.

 (Issei Futamata): He is the resident mechanics expert and in-house genius. A quiet individual until a mecha-related issue comes up. His expertise comes in use when assessing and analyzing the Bioroid threat. In &quot;Robotech&quot;, his name was changed to Louis &quot;Louie&quot; Nichols.

 (from the most famous French Parisians subway station on the top of Champs Elysées (Charles de Gaulle l&#x27;étoile)) (Bin Shimada): At the age of 23, Charles was the former commander of the 15th Squad until a romantic indiscretion had him demoted to private. Charles is a constant womanizer who eventually falls in love with Marie. In &quot;Robotech&quot;, his named was changed to Sean Phillips.

 (Yoshikazu Hirano): He is a human pilot who was captured and brainwashed by the Zor, and later becomes an informant for them. Initially, Seifreit pilots a red Zor Bioroid, and he is nearly unstoppable in battle against Jeanne and her ATAC squadron. He is recaptured by Lana, and his memories are examined for clues into the Zor. His human mind begins to conflict with his Zor brainwashing, and he is nearly driven insane. Instead of breaking down mentally, he decides to take revenge on the Zor for their violation of his mind. In &quot;Robotech&quot;, his name is changed to Zor Prime (a clone of the original Zor, Protoculture Scientist from the &quot;Macross&quot; saga).

 (Kouji Totani): He is a lieutenant in the Tactics Armored Space Corps (TASC). Lana is impressed with Brown&#x27;s sense of integrity, optimism, and duty. In &quot;Robotech&quot;, his name is Lt. Dennis Brown.

 (Daisuke Gōri): The supreme general of the Southern Cross. A megalomaniac determined on wiping out the Zor at any cost, he begins to take extreme measures to ensure victory. His policies are heavily criticized by General Emerson. In &quot;Robotech&quot;, he is called &quot;Supreme Commander Leonard&quot;.

 (Makoto Terada): Father of Bowie Emerson, and part-time guardian of Jeanne. He is the primary critic of General Leon, but stops short of disobeying orders. His tactical maneuvers during battles in the war with the Zor are seen as innovative and ingenious. His name is unchanged for &quot;Robotech&quot;.

, and (Hirotaka Suzuoki): the leaders of the Zor. In &quot;Robotech&quot;, they are not individually named but referred to as &quot;The Robotech Masters&quot; or &quot;The Triumvirate&quot;.

, , (Noriko Hidaka): The triplet sirens whose music inspires the Zor people. Musica begins doubting her people&#x27;s ways and, after meeting Bowie, escapes the mother ship and defects to Glorie. She and Bowie quickly fall in love, and then flee into the woods to escape capture by Lana. In &quot;Robotech&quot;, they are called Musica (no change), Allegra, and Octavia.

===Background===
The world of Glorie was founded by the human race in an effort to find new worlds for humanity because the Earth had become uninhabitable as a result of a catastrophic nuclear holocaust. Relay stations have been established at Mars and Jupiter, and as a result the planet &quot;Liberté&quot; located in the Proxima solar system was colonized. The next planet, Glorie, was discovered in the Epsilon Eridani system. Similar in planetary scale and atmospheric conditions to Earth, Glorie still had an unexpectedly harsh natural environment. The planet has an elliptical orbit around the sun, with a cycle of 73 years. Sixty percent of the planet&#x27;s surface area is land, and in the winter, fifty percent of that land is covered with glaciers. Originally the planetary temperatures in winter averaged between . Thanks to extensive military terraforming, Glorie was successfully turned into a suitable planet for terrestrial life.

The government of Glorie is independent from that of Liberté but is an ally to that planet. In the year 2120 (when this story takes place), Glorie is now a self-sufficient planet in terms of food and resources.

===Southern Cross Army===
The military organization (referred to as the Southern Cross Army) is under the jurisdiction of its prime minister. The units are divided among the Surface (land/sea) Forces and the Aerospace Forces.

The Surface Forces consist of:
* A.T.A.C. - the Alpha Tactics Armored Corps,
* C.D.U. - the Cities Defense Unit, and
* T.C. - the Tactics Corps and its specialized subdivisions:
** RE.P. - the Reconnoitering Party,
** CO.S. - the Cold Squad,
** DE.S. - the Desert Squad,
** MO.S. - the Mountains Squad,
** FO.S. - the Forest Squad,
** MA.S. - the Marsh Squad, and
** NA.D. - the Navy Division.

The Aerospace Forces consist of:
* T.A.F. - the Tactics Air Force,
* T.S.C. - the Tactics Space Corps,
* C.D.F.C. - the Cities Defense Flying Corps, and
* T.A.S.C. - the Tactics Armored Space Corps.

There are also security forces and the Glorie Military Police (G.M.P.), which are independent but still directly affiliated with Supreme General Headquarters. Headquarters are located in every major city.

Each unit has a specialized robotic vehicle for combat campaigns. Among them are:
* ATAC-01-SCA Spartas: A one-man transformable hit-and-run vehicle used exclusively by the Alpha Tactics Armored Corps (A.T.A.C.). Each Spartas has the ability to transform into 3 modes: Sniping Clapper (a high-speed hovercraft), Walker Cannon (a GERWALK-like artillery emplacement which actually cannot walk but can make rocket-assisted jumps), and Battle Sniper (a humanoid robot form). Models differ depending on the rank of the individual and are upgraded throughout the conflict. By the time that the Auroran is introduced, the Spartas has been remodeled for effective space combat.
* TASC-01-SCF Logan: The Logan is a transformable aerial assault mecha used exclusively by the Tactics Armored Space Corps (T.A.S.C.). The mecha has two modes: Flying Cat (fighter) mode for high-speed aerial combat and Flying Walker (humanoid) mode which is suited for near ground assaults. The fighter has the ability to cover great distances but performs poorly in space and is consistently outfought by Bioroids in all early engagements of the war.
* TASC-02-SCF Auroran: The Auroran was a late development during the war, that was constructed to replace the Logan. It has the capability to transform into three different modes: Crusader (fighter), Cross Fighter (heavy combat helicopter), and Cosmo Sniper (humanoid). Though the new Cosmo Sniper mode was specifically designed to deal with the Zor Bioroid threat, the Auroran proves only moderately successful, since its debut coincides closely with an improved model of bioroid.
* TAF Sylphide: The Sylphide is a fighter used by the Tactics Air Force. This fighter can also be distinguished by a center tail as well as vertical surfaces mounted in the middle of each wing. The weaponry of the Sylphide includes two guns in the fuselage, two guns mounted on a ventral pod and four missile hardpoints (two on the outside of either lower engine nacelle).
* GMP Garm: The Southern Cross Glorie Military Police uses this mecha fielded exclusively for it. The unit is capable of identifying personnel and recording evidence in investigations. Its systems have access to the military legal code to assist in determining if the law has been broken.
* TC Salamander: The Tactics Corps uses the Salamander robot as their main combat robot for high-mobility heavy-weapons support. The arms have reinforced armor to assist in parrying attacks. There is a thruster in the rear to assist the mecha in leaping.

===Personal armor===
Every soldier of the Southern Cross Army is issued a personal combat suit known as an &quot;arming doublet&quot;. The suit not only acts as protective armor but also improves combat performance. Each suit is equipped to serve different functions and can be altered depending on the mission requirements and needs of each division and rank. All suits are personally tailored for the physique of the individual, resulting in high mobility. Some variants of the arming doublet also have the ability to serve as self-sealed spacesuits.

===Zor===
The are a race who serve as the antagonists for the Southern Cross Army. The Zor were the former inhabitants of the planet Glorie, but they had to evacuate due to an apocalyptic war. Their advances in biotechnology surpass that of humanity, and the weapons they employ called &quot;Bioroids&quot; serve as a formidable enemy to the units of the Southern Cross. They operate in groups of three. Each member is responsible for one of three functions: information, decision and action. As a whole, they present a powerful threat, but if one member is lost to the group, then they lose their stability and become unable to function. Characteristically, the Zor are human in appearance, tall and slender with violet eyes, silvery hair and pale skin.

The Zor have a symbiotic relationship with a flower native to Glorie referred to as the Protozor, which, like them, exist in trinities.

===Bioroids===
Like the troops of the Southern Cross, the Zor rely on large humanoid mecha to spearhead military operations. The Zor mecha, called &quot;bioroids&quot;, are considerably more advanced than their Southern Cross counterparts, based on a symbiotic interface that conveys the thoughts of the operator directly to the mecha. Because of this interface, Bioroids are effectively &quot;alive&quot;, with the pilots acting as their &quot;brains&quot;; this increases the response promptness and makes their movements much more agile that those of the Southern Cross mecha. At the same time, there appears to be no pain-receptor feedback to the pilot, as bioroids are unaffected by direct hits unless the cockpit itself is damaged.

In addition to mentally centered control, bioroids have access to an array of weapons, including both advanced projectile and sustained-beam weapons held in one hand. Typical engagements also find the bioroids riding anti-gravity hovercraft equipped with their own strafing weapons, and it appears that the hovercraft can be summoned to their riders remotely.

Since the Zor are not a race suited for combat, they abduct personnel from the armies of the Southern Cross and Liberté forces, brainwash them, and use them as &quot;biohuman&quot; pilots for the bioroids. Southern Cross troops adapt slowly to the tactical imbalance they have versus bioroid forces but become ensnared as they start to gain ground in combat by the psychological deterrent of knowing that they are fighting their own kind. Even late in the war, Southern Cross troops demonstrate conflicting emotions over advances in weaponry, knowing that increases in their own kill rates paradoxically still mean greater death for humanity as a whole.

During the time of the conflict, many variations of the Bioroid are implemented by the Zor in order to adapt to the ever-changing battle conditions experienced on the field. The final version of the Bioroid embodies the Zor&#x27;s own triplet model of operation, with each triple set representing thought, action, and reaction.

==Episode list==
NOTE: &quot;Dana&#x27;s Story&quot; was not a straight adaptation of a Japanese episode, but rather a clip show cobbled together from &quot;Macross&quot; and &quot;Southern Cross&quot; episodes which established Dana Sterling (Jeanne) as the daughter of the &quot;Macross&quot; characters Max and Miriya (Milia), a connection between &quot;Macross&quot; and &quot;Southern Cross&quot; that was a creation of &quot;Robotech&quot; producers Harmony Gold and was not present in the original Japanese. It served also to bring the total number of &quot;Robotech&quot; episodes to 85.

==Production==
The show was the third mecha anime series released under the &quot;Super Dimension&quot; moniker by the sponsor Big West in 1984. This science fiction series followed two other series created by Studio Nue with Artland: &quot;Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot; (1982–1983), sponsored by Big West and animated by Tatsunoko Production, and &quot;Super Dimension Century Orguss&quot; (1983–1984), sponsored by Big West and animated by Tokyo Movie Shinsha.

Unlike the previous two series, &quot;Southern Cross&quot; was created and produced almost entirely by Tatsunoko Production, with mechanical designs by its sister studio Ammonite. The series lasted for 23 episodes. The three titles share some of the same creators, and &quot;Macross&quot; is referenced by character cameos and inside references by the latter two series. However, the basic stories are unrelated.

==Reception==
&quot;Southern Cross&quot; was the least successful installment of the &quot;Super Dimension&quot; brand, and wrapped at episode 23. The toy sponsor, Popy, pulled out of its sponsorship before the series premiered which did not help selling it as lack of merchandise was often detrimental to such mecha franchises.

<text>Bay is a hair coat color of horses, characterized by a reddish-brown or brown body color with a black point coloration on the mane, tail, ear edges, and lower legs. Bay is one of the most common coat colors in many horse breeds.

The black areas of a bay horse&#x27;s hair coat are called &quot;black points&quot;, and without them, a horse is not a bay horse. Black points may sometimes be covered by white markings; however such markings do not alter a horse&#x27;s classification as &quot;bay&quot;. Bay horses have dark skin – except under white markings, where the skin is pink. Genetically, bay occurs when a horse carries both at least one dominant Agouti gene and at least one dominant Extension gene. While the basic genetics that create bay coloring are fairly simple, the genes themselves and the mechanisms that cause shade variations within the bay family are quite complex and, at times, disputed. The genetics of dark shades of bay are still under study. The genetic mechanism that produces seal brown has yet to be isolated, however most seal brown horses appear to have the genotype EE Aa, which could play a part. Sooty genetics also appear to progressively darken some horses&#x27; coats as they age, and that genetic mechanism is yet to be fully understood.

The addition of dilution genes or various spotting pattern genes create many additional coat colors, although the underlying bay coat color genetics usually manifest by a warm-toned red, tan, or brownish body color and the appearance of black points.

==Color variations and terminology==


Bay horses range in color from a light copper red, to a rich red &quot;blood bay&quot; (the best-known variety of bay horse) to a very dark red or brown called &quot;dark bay,&quot; &quot;mahogany bay,&quot; &quot;black-bay,&quot; or &quot;brown&quot; (or &quot;seal brown&quot;). The dark brown shades of bay are referred to in other languages by words meaning &quot;black-and-tan.&quot; Dark bays/browns may be so dark as to have nearly black coats, with brownish-red hairs visible only under the eyes, around the muzzle, behind the elbow, and in front of the stifle. Dark bay should not be confused with &quot;Liver&quot; chestnut, which is also a very dark brown color, but a liver chestnut has a brown mane, tail and legs, and no black points.

Bay horses have black skin and dark eyes, except for the skin under markings, which is pink. Skin color can help an observer distinguish between a bay horse with white markings and a horse which resembles bay but is not.

The pigment in a bay horse&#x27;s coat, regardless of shade, is rich and fully saturated. This makes bays particularly lustrous in the sun if properly cared for. Some bay horses exhibit &quot;dappling,&quot; which is caused by textured, concentric rings within the coat. Dapples on a bay horse suggest good condition and care, though many well-cared for horses never dapple. The tendency to dapple may also be, to some extent, genetic.

The red areas of a bay coat usually have a two-toned hair shaft, which, if shaved closely (such as when body-clipping for a horse show), may cause the horse to appear several shades lighter, a somewhat dull orange-gold, almost like a dun. However, as the hair grows out, it will darken again to the proper shade. This phenomenon is linked to the genetics that produce red coloration in horses, but usually not seen in body-clipped darker shades of bay because there is less red in the hair shaft.

There are many terms that are used to describe particular shades and qualities of a bay coat. Some shade variations can be related to nutrition and grooming, but most appear to be caused by inherited factors not yet fully understood.

The shades with the least amount of point coloration are called &quot;wild bays.&quot; Wild bays are true bays with fully pigmented reddish coat color and black manes and tails, but the black points only extend up to the pastern or fetlock. Wild bay is sometimes found in conjunction with a trait called &quot;pangare&quot; that produces pale color on the underbelly and soft areas, such as near the stifle and around the muzzle.

Some breed registries use the term &quot;brown&quot; to describe darker bays, though modern genetics have resulted in some terminology revisions such as the use of &quot;bay or brown.&quot; However, &quot;liver&quot; chestnuts, horses with a red or brown mane and tail as well as a dark brownish body coat, are sometimes called &quot;brown&quot; in some colloquial contexts. Therefore, &quot;brown&quot; can be an ambiguous term for describing horse coat color. It is clearer to refer to dark-colored horses as dark bays or liver chestnuts.

To further complicate matters, there apparently exists more than one genetic mechanism that darkens coat colors. One is a theorized sooty gene which produces dark shading on any coat color. The other is a specific allele of Agouti linked to a certain type of dark bay, called seal brown. The seal brown horse has dark brown body and lighter areas around the eyes, the muzzle, and flanks. A DNA test said to detect the seal brown (At) allele was developed, but the test was never subjected to peer review and due to unreliable results was subsequently pulled from the market.

===Effect of gray gene===
Some foals are born bay, but carry the dominant gene for graying, and thus will turn gray as they mature until eventually their hair coat is completely white. Foals that are going to become gray must have one parent that is gray. Some foals may be born with a few white hairs already visible around the eyes, muzzle, and other fine-haired, thin-skinned areas, but others may not show signs of graying until they are several months old.

==Colors confused with bay==


*Chestnuts, sometimes called &quot;Sorrels&quot;, have a reddish body coat similar to a bay, but no black points. Their legs and ear edges are the same color as the rest of their body (unless they have white markings) and their manes and tails are the same shade as their body color or even a few shades lighter.
*Black is occasionally confused with dark bays and liver chestnuts because some black horses &quot;sunburn&quot;, that is, when kept out in the sun, they develop a bleached-out coat that looks brownish, particularly in the fine-haired areas around the flanks. However, a true black can be recognized by looking at the fine hairs around the muzzle and eyes. These hairs are always black on a black horse, but are reddish, brownish, or even a light gold on a bay or chestnut.

==Genetics==
The bay color is created with two colors of melanin pigment, the black eumelanin, which gives the black color of the mane, tail, and lower legs, and the &quot;red&quot; pheomelanin, which gives the body its red-brown color. Unlike the point coloration of Siamese cats and Himalayan rabbits, the points on horses are not produced by an albinism gene. Instead, two genes called &quot;extension&quot; and &quot;agouti&quot; interact to create this pattern.

At &quot;agouti&quot;, the dominant, ancestral &quot;A&quot; allele limits the location of black pigment to the points, seen in the bay color. The recessive &quot;a&quot; allele allows black pigment to cover the whole body, resulting in a fully black horse.

At &quot;extension&quot;, horses with the dominant, ancestral &quot;E&quot; allele are able to produce either red or black pigment, and depending on &quot;agouti&quot; genotype horses with &quot;E&quot; can be bay or black. The recessive &quot;e&quot; alleles replaces all black pigment in the coat with red, creating a solid red chestnut coat regardless of &quot;agouti&quot; genotype. To be bay, a horse must have at least one &quot;E&quot; at &quot;extension&quot; and at least one &quot;A&quot; at &quot;agouti&quot;.

The extent to which a bay passes on its color varies. Two bay horses heterozygous for E (Ee x Ee) have a 25% statistical probability to produce a chestnut. Similarly, bay horses heterozygous for A (Aa x Aa) may produce a black foal. 

Because chestnut&#x27;s &quot;e&quot; at &quot;extension&quot; is recessive to bay&#x27;s &quot;E&quot;, two chestnut horses can never have a bay foal. Likewise, because black&#x27;s &quot;a&quot; at &quot;agouti&quot; is recessive, two black horses cannot have a bay foal either. However, it is possible for a chestnut horse and a black horse to produce a bay foal, if the chestnut horse is &quot;AA&quot; or &quot;Aa&quot; at &quot;agouti&quot;. The foal can inherit the &quot;A&quot; allele from its chestnut parent and the &quot;E&quot; allele from its black parent, resulting in a bay color.

The genetics behind the different shades of bay are still under investigation. A genome wide association study identified a region of equine chromosome 22 that appears to correlate with the extent of black pigment on bay horses. This region includes the 5&#x27; end of the agouti gene as well as another gene called &quot;RALY&quot;, both known to affect coat color in other species. Further research is needed to pinpoint the causative mutation.

===Origin===

The oldest known horse coat color is bay dun, a tan color with a black mane, tail, dorsal stripe, and lower legs. The legs may sometimes have zebra-like black stripes; these, along with the dorsal stripe seen on all dun horses, are called primitive markings. Over 42,000 years ago, a mutation called non-dun 1 appeared, which allowed horses to be bay. Non-dun 1 replaces the tan dun color with the darker brown of bay, but keeps the primitive markings seen on dun. Later a second mutation to the dun gene, called non-dun 2, was able to remove the primitive markings altogether to create the non-striped bay color common today.

==Bay-family colors==
The effects of additional equine coat color genes on a bay template alter the basic color into other shades or patterns:

*Buckskin horses have a black mane and tail, but instead of a red or brown coat, they have a cream or gold coat. Though once called a &quot;Sandy&quot; bay in older texts on horse color, the genetic distinction created by the cream gene is significant. They are a bay horse that is also heterozygous for the dominant creme (CCr) allele. The black pigment remains largely unchanged, but any red pigment in the coat is diluted to gold. Buckskins are seldom mistaken for bays because their coats are significantly lighter and have no hint of a red or orange tint.
*Perlinos are bay horses who are homozygous for the dominant creme (CCr) allele. Both black and red pigment are diluted to some shade of creme, though the formerly black points often have a stronger reddish cast. The skin is a slightly pigmented pink and the eyes are blue.
*Bay duns are bay horses with at least one dominant dun allele. Red and black pigment at the extremities remains largely unchanged, but on the body, black pigment is diluted to slate and red pigment is diluted to a dustier shade. The effect is similar to buckskin, but the coat of a bay dun is a flatter tan rather than bronze, and all duns have some form of primitive markings that include a dorsal stripe along the backbone, and sometimes faint horizontal striping at the back of the front legs.
*Amber champagne refers to a bay horse with at least one dominant champagne allele. Black pigment is diluted to warm brown and red pigment to gold. The effect is similar to buckskin, but the points of an amber champagne do not remain black, and the skin is mottled. Amber champagnes also have hazel eyes rather than brown.
*Silver bays are bay horses with at least one dominant silver (Z) allele. Red pigment is unaffected, but black pigment in the short coat is diluted to dark, flat, brown-gray while the longer hairs are diluted to silver. The overall effect on a bay is that of a chocolate-colored horse with a pale mane and tail.
*Bay Roan horses are bays with at least one dominant roan (Rn) allele. The roan gene creates an effect of white hairs intermingled with the red body coat. This color was formerly lumped together with chestnut or &quot;strawberry&quot; roans and called &quot;red roan.&quot;
*Bay pintos are bay horses with any number of white spotting genes, including but not limited to tobiano, frame overo or splashed white, and so on. The pattern has no bearing on whether or not the horse is bay. Pinto horses also may have a bay base coat overlaid by white spots. Sometimes the term &quot;skewbald&quot; or &quot;tricolor&quot; is used, especially in the UK, to refer to bay pintos.
**Sabino is a color pattern in the pinto family, but in some cases, the gene may be minimally expressed in the form of very bold white markings or slight body spotting and such horses will be registered by their owners as &quot;bay&quot;, particularly in breed registries that do not have a category for pinto.
*Bay Leopards are horses that carry the leopard (Lp) gene or gene complex characteristic of the Appaloosa and other breeds. This gene also produces secondary characteristics that include mottled skin, a white sclera around the eye, and striped hooves.
*A few bay horses may carry the rabicano gene, which either produces faint roaning on only some parts of the body or can cause some white or cream hairs to appear in the mane or tail, sometimes creating a &quot;skunk&quot; effect. Most bays with rabicano are registered as either bays or as bay roans.

<text>Natalia Valeeva (born 15 November 1969 in Tîrnauca, Transnistria) is a naturalized Italian archer. She is a five-time Olympian and former world number one, and a native of Moldova, having represented the Unified Team, Moldova and Italy, at the Olympic Games of 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2012.

In the first elimination round, held in challenging windy conditions, she faced 56th-ranked Jasmin Figueroa of the Philippines. The biggest upset of the round, this match saw Valeeva lose to Figueroa 132–130 in the 18-arrow match, dropping all the way to 53rd overall in women&#x27;s individual archery.

<doc id="913746" wikidata="Q317037" url="?curid=913746" title="Kwame Brown">
<text>Kwame Hasani Brown (born March 10, 1982) is an American former professional basketball player who spent 12 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Selected first overall by the Washington Wizards in the 2001 NBA draft, Brown was the first player to be drafted number one overall straight out of high school. He later played for the Los Angeles Lakers, Memphis Grizzlies, Detroit Pistons, Charlotte Bobcats, Golden State Warriors, and Philadelphia 76ers. His performance as a first overall draft pick has led many analysts to label him as one of the biggest busts in NBA history.

==High school==
Brown was consistently rated as the &quot;best high school player&quot; in his class, which also included high school standouts Eddy Curry and Tyson Chandler. He was the high school player of the year as a senior in Georgia. 

Brown finished his high school career at the historic Glynn Academy (in Brunswick, Georgia) as the school&#x27;s all-time leading rebounder (1,235) and shot-blocker (605), and also finished second all-time as a scorer (1,539 points). He was named to the 2001 McDonald&#x27;s All-American Team. 

Brown&#x27;s senior averages were 20.1 points, 13.3 rebounds, 5.8 blocks, 3 assists and 2 steals per game. While Brown was a senior, Glynn Academy produced a 24–7 record and reached the GHSA semifinals.

==Professional career==

===Washington Wizards (2001–2005)===
Originally signing a letter of intent to play for the University of Florida, he later declared for the 2001 NBA draft. The Washington Wizards, under team president Michael Jordan, used their first overall pick on him. Following a pre-draft workout with the Wizards, it has been reported that Brown told then-Wizards coach Doug Collins, &quot;If you draft me, you&#x27;ll never regret it.&quot;

Perhaps as a result of hype and high expectations, Brown&#x27;s rookie season was marred by a lack of maturity and production on the court. In his rookie year, Brown averaged 4.5 points and 3.5 rebounds per game.

However, the Wizards believed in Brown&#x27;s potential. In his second season as a professional, Brown saw more action in the league. He started 20 out of the 80 games he played and the total minutes he played doubled. 

Brown improved his numbers, posting averages of 7.4 points and 5.3 rebounds per game. In his third season, Brown continued to improve, posting career highs in both points (10.9) and rebounds (7.4). In a game against the Sacramento Kings, he registered 30 points and 19 rebounds.

After his first three years in Washington, Brown rejected a five-year, $30 million contract offer, electing instead to test the free agent market when his contract expired after the season. In his fourth season, Brown was limited to 42 games due to injuries. His highest-scoring game of the season was 19 points, compared to his season-high of 30 the year before, and he averaged 7.0 points per game. Late in the season, criticism increased; he feuded with Gilbert Arenas, other teammates, and his coach Eddie Jordan.

===Los Angeles Lakers (2005–2008)===
On August 2, 2005, Brown and Laron Profit were traded to the Lakers in exchange for Caron Butler and Chucky Atkins. This move was met with some controversy from fans who disliked Brown&#x27;s reputation and his label as an &quot;under-achiever.&quot; In the beginning of the season, he averaged just above 6 points and 6 rebounds.

On December 26, 2005, he played his first game at the Washington Wizards&#x27; MCI Center (now known as Capital One Arena) as a Laker. The sold-out crowd of 20,173 fans loudly booed him upon entering the game and whenever he touched the ball. In the second quarter, Brown was looking the other way when teammate Sasha Vujačić threw a pass his way. The ball bounced off his head and landed out of bounds, which was met with loud cheers from the crowd. Brown called the reception &quot;weak&quot; and stated that &quot;they should be cheering that I&#x27;m gone.&quot; The Wizards won the game 94–91.

When Lakers center Chris Mihm went down with a season-ending ankle injury on March 12, 2006, Brown took over the starting center position. During his stint as a center, he raised his averages from 6.1 points and 6.3 rebounds to 12.3 points and 9.1 rebounds and started every game for the Lakers in the playoffs. Brown became a central part of the Lakers seven-game series with the Phoenix Suns. Although they ended up losing the series, it had appeared that Kwame Brown&#x27;s potential was beginning to show.

The surprising consistency Brown showed while playing center prompted Phil Jackson to make Brown the starting center in the 2006–07 season. Brown was injured at the beginning of the season and Mihm was also out with injury for the whole season, so the starting job at center was given to the young Andrew Bynum. After playing the majority of the minutes at center despite the bench role, he was given the starting job in early December.

Brown again became injured in the 2007–08 season which allowed Bynum to start again at the center position where he flourished. However, when Bynum suffered a knee injury that appeared to jeopardize the Lakers&#x27; playoff chances, Brown regained his starting position.

===Memphis Grizzlies (2008)===
On February 1, 2008, Brown was traded along with Javaris Crittenton, Aaron McKie, the draft rights to Marc Gasol, and the Lakers&#x27; 2008 and 2010 first-round draft picks for Pau Gasol and a second-round pick in 2010. On July 1, 2008, the Memphis Grizzlies chose not to sign Brown to a new contract, making him an unrestricted free agent. 

===Detroit Pistons (2008–2010)===
On July 28, 2008, ESPN.com reported that the Pistons signed Brown to a two-year deal worth $8 million, with the second year a player option.

===Charlotte Bobcats (2010–2011)===
On August 23, 2010, Brown signed a one-year deal with the Bobcats.

===Golden State Warriors (2011–2012)===
On December 14, 2011, Brown signed a one-year, $7 million contract with the Warriors.

=== Philadelphia 76ers (2012–2013) ===
On March 13, 2012, Brown, along with Monta Ellis and Ekpe Udoh, was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in exchange for Andrew Bogut and Stephen Jackson. Brown never played for the Bucks during the season.

On July 20, 2012, Brown signed a two-year contract for nearly $6 million with the Philadelphia 76ers. After sustaining a right hamstring strain in September 2013, Brown was waived by the 76ers on November 20 before appearing in a game for them in the 2013–14 season.

==Post-NBA career==
In 2017, Brown was the fifth overall pick in the inaugural draft of the BIG3 basketball league. In BIG3 Brown played for the 3 Headed Monsters, who made it to the finals and ended up losing to Trilogy 51–46.

In 2021, Brown created numerous YouTube videos critiquing the assertion that he was a &#x27;bust&quot; as a first round draft pick, claiming that mainstream U.S. sports media unfairly targeted him for over twenty years, as well as negatively depicting black men, in general. The videos were created in response to negative comments about Brown&#x27;s career from former NBA players Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson on a May 2021 episode of their podcast &quot;All the Smoke.&quot; Brown&#x27;s response has led to a significant increase of social media attention, especially via YouTube and Instagram.

==Personal life==
Brown&#x27;s cousin Jabari Smith also played in the NBA. Smith&#x27;s son, Jabari Smith Jr., also became an NBA player.

In 2002, Brown&#x27;s hometown girlfriend, Joselyn Vaughn, moved into his Virginia home. Together they had three daughters. In 2019, Brown sued for custody of the children.

===Legal issues===

In August 2003, Brown was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated near his hometown of Brunswick. In October 2007, Brown was arrested in Georgia and charged with disorderly conduct and interference with a law enforcement officer after an incident in which the driver of a car in which he was a passenger was arrested for driving drunk with a suspended license.

Brown was arrested on March 31, 2019, by Georgia police and charged with felony possession of edible marijuana products and misdemeanor possession of less than one ounce of marijuana.

<doc id="913757" wikidata="Q434270" url="?curid=913757" title="Eliot A. Cohen">
<text>Eliot Asher Cohen (born April 3, 1956) is an American political scientist. He was a counselor in the United States Department of State under Condoleezza Rice from 2007 to 2009. In 2019, Cohen was named the 9th Dean of the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) at Johns Hopkins University, succeeding Vali Nasr. Before his time as dean, he directed the Strategic Studies Program at SAIS. Cohen &quot;is one of the few teachers in the American academy to treat military history as a serious field&quot;, according to international law scholar Ruth Wedgwood. Cohen is a contributing writer at &quot;The Atlantic.&quot; He is also, with Eric Edelman, a co-host of the &quot;Shield of the Republic&quot; podcast, published by &quot;The Bulwark&quot;.

==Biography==
Cohen grew up in Boston in a secular Jewish family. When he was in his teens his father became more observant and sent him to the Maimonides School, a Modern Orthodox Jewish day school in Brookline. Cohen received his B.A. in government at Harvard University in 1977. He went on to receive a Ph.D. from Harvard in 1982 in political science, and during his PhD training went through the Army ROTC program at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (because Harvard banned ROTC from campus in 1971; Harvard ROTC began training at MIT in 1976). He served as a military intelligence officer in the United States Army Reserve and left military service as a captain.

He was an assistant professor of government and assistant dean at Harvard University from 1982 to 1985. Following this, he taught for four years at the Naval War College in the Department of Strategy, before briefly serving in 1990 on the policy planning staff in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. In 1990, Cohen began teaching at SAIS. After the 1991 Persian Gulf War, he directed the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s official four-volume survey, the Gulf War Air Power Survey, until 1993, for which he received the Air Force&#x27;s Exemplary Civilian Service Award. In 1993, Paul Wolfowitz, who would later become prominent as the Deputy Secretary of Defense in the run-up to the Iraq War, became Dean of SAIS. During his brief stint at the defense policy planning staff, Cohen had worked under Wolfowitz but this was the first time they were in extended contact.

In 1997, Cohen co-founded the Project for the New American Century (PNAC), which was a center for prominent neoconservatives. He has been a member of the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee, a committee of civilians and retired military officers that the U.S. Secretary of Defense may call upon for advice, that was instituted during the administration of President George W. Bush. He was put on the board after acquaintance Richard Perle put forward his name. Cohen has referred to the War on Terrorism as &quot;World War IV&quot;. In the run-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, he was a member of Committee for the Liberation of Iraq, a group of prominent persons who pressed for an invasion.

On 2 March 2007, Cohen was appointed by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to serve as Counselor of the State Department, replacing Philip D. Zelikow. He exited government along with his peers at the end of term for the Bush presidency.

, he is on the America Abroad Media advisory board.

==Political views==

===Statements on US foreign policy===
Cohen was one of the first neoconservatives to publicly advocate war against Iran and Iraq. In a November 2001 op-ed for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Cohen identified what he called &quot;World War IV&quot; and advocated the overthrow of Iran&#x27;s government as a possible next step for the Bush administration. Cohen claimed &quot;regime change&quot; in Iran could be accomplished with a focus on &quot;pro-Western and anticlerical forces&quot; in the Middle East and suggested that such an action would be &quot;wise, moral and unpopular (among some of our allies)&quot;. He went on to argue that such a policy was as important as the then identified goal of Osama bin Laden&#x27;s capture: &quot;The overthrow of the first theocratic revolutionary Muslim state and its replacement by a moderate or secular government, however, would be no less important a victory in this war than the annihilation of bin Laden.&quot;

Later in 2001, Cohen, in what was becoming a dominant theme of his writing, advocated war against Iraq once again and proceeded to outline how effortless such a military campaign would be:
After Afghanistan, what? Iraq is the big prize... One important element will be the use of the Iraqi National Congress to help foster the collapse of the regime, and to provide a replacement for it. The INC, which has received bad, and in some cases malicious treatment, from the State Department and intelligence community over the years, may not be able to do the job with U.S. air support alone.

As a result of his public statements on why a war against Iraq was necessary, Cohen was invited to appear on &quot;CNN Wolf Blitzer Reports&quot; and amongst other statements given in response to questioning from Blitzer offered the judgment:
We know that he [Saddam Hussein] supports terror. There&#x27;s very solid evidence that the Iraqis were behind an attempt to assassinate President Bush&#x27;s father. And we—by the way, we do know that there is a connection with the 9/11 terrorists. We do know that Mohamed Atta, the ringleader of the 9/11 terrorists, met with Iraqi intelligence in Prague. So...

In testifying to a congressional House committee later in 2002, Cohen was quoted as saying:
..the choice before the United States is a stark one, either to acquiesce in a situation which permits the regime of Saddam Hussein to restore his economy, acquire weapons of mass destruction and pose a lethal threat to his neighbors and to us, or to take action to overthrow him. In my view, the latter course, with all of its risks, is the correct one. Indeed, the dangers of failing to act in the near future are unacceptable.

In a piece for the &quot;Wall Street Journal &quot;on 6 February 2003, Cohen fervently praised the presentation given by then Secretary of State Colin Powell in which he outlined the case for military action against Iraq to the United Nations. He went on to indicate that it was time for those who doubted that the case had been proven to support the Bush administration in their efforts.

An article written for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; on 10 July 2005 raised the attention of commentators in the media and &quot;blogosphere&quot;. The piece, an attempt to articulate Cohen&#x27;s self identified roles as academic, pundit, and father, was written as his son prepared to deploy to Iraq to fight a war the elder Cohen had been calling for since early 2001. The piece ends:
There is a lot of talk these days about shaky public support for the war. That is not really the issue. Nor should cheerleading, as opposed to truth-telling, be our leaders&#x27; chief concern. If we fail in Iraq—and I don&#x27;t think we will—it won&#x27;t be because the American people lack heart, but because leaders and institutions have failed. Rather than fretting about support at home, let them show themselves dedicated to waging and winning a strange kind of war and describing it as it is, candidly and in detail. Then the American people will give them all the support they need. The scholar in me is not surprised when our leaders blunder, although the pundit in me is dismayed when they do. What the father in me expects from our leaders is, simply, the truth—an end to happy talk and denials of error, and a seriousness equal to that of the men and women our country sends into the fight.
As a member of the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee Cohen had also been engaged in meetings involving US President George Bush. During these meetings Cohen provided advice on strategy in the Iraq conflict.

===View on military experience and policy-making skills===
In 2002, Cohen defended the PNAC membership against the charge that its personnel were chicken-hawks. Cohen found unsupported the opinion that, compared to civilians, veterans possess &quot;sheer moral authority&quot; or &quot;are uniquely qualified to make judgments on matters of war and peace.&quot; As an example, Cohen states:There is no evidence that generals as a class make wiser national security policymakers than civilians. George C. Marshall, our greatest soldier statesman after George Washington, opposed shipping arms to Britain in 1940. His boss, Franklin D. Roosevelt, with nary a day in uniform, thought otherwise. Whose judgment looks better?
FDR was Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s secretary of the Navy

===Appointment to Department of State===
On 2 March 2007, it was reported by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that Cohen was to be appointed as Condoleezza Rice&#x27;s &quot;counselor&quot; at the United States Department of State. Cohen replaced Philip D. Zelikow and said he would fill time before appointment in April 2007 by acting as a consultant for Rice.

The tone of the &quot;Washington Post&quot; article—Cohen is described as a &quot;critic&quot; of the Iraq war—was soon criticised. An article by Ximena Ortiz in the &quot;National Interest&quot; called Cohen&#x27;s ability to do the job into question and attempted to juxtapose his previous statements on the Bush administration foreign policy with the resulting war in Iraq. Adding to the criticism was Glenn Greenwald of Salon.com who, describing Cohen as &quot;extremist a neoconservative and warmonger as it gets&quot;, suggested an internal significance of the appointment for the Bush administration:
The Cohen appointment, is clearly another instance where neoconservatives place a watchdog in potential trouble spots in the government to ensure that diplomats do not stray by trying to facilitate rapprochements between the U.S. and the countries on the neoconservative War hit list.

As the controversy played out in the media, a rebuttal of sorts from Ruth Wedgwood, international law scholar at Johns Hopkins University, sought to defend Cohen from criticism. Ortiz was subsequently supported in her criticism by fellow commentator at &quot;National Interest Online&quot;, Anatol Lieven, who raised the level of criticism to include Cohen&#x27;s efforts as a historian and analyst as well as tackling other pronouncements on US foreign policy in the Middle East made by Cohen.

===Mearsheimer and Walt paper===

In March 2006, Harvard Kennedy School&#x27;s academic dean Stephen M. Walt along with Professor John J. Mearsheimer of the University of Chicago, both political scientists, published an academic paper titled &quot;The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy.&quot; The paper criticizes the Israel lobby for influencing U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East away from U.S. interests and towards Israel&#x27;s interests. Cohen wrote in a prominent op-ed piece in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that the academic working paper bears all the traditional hallmarks of anti-Semitism: &quot;obsessive and irrationally hostile beliefs about Jews&quot;, accusations toward Jews of &quot;disloyalty, subversion or treachery, of having occult powers and of participating in secret combinations that manipulate institutions and governments&quot;, as well as selection of &quot;everything unfair, ugly or wrong about Jews as individuals or a group&quot; and equally systematical suppression of &quot;any exculpatory information&quot;. Mearsheimer and Walt have denied Cohen&#x27;s assertions as false, dishonest and ridiculous, noting that criticism of Israeli state policy and influential American advocates of that policy, such as Cohen, is not the same thing as demonization of Jewish people.

===Chuck Hagel nomination===
Along with a large number of other Republicans, Cohen opposed Barack Obama&#x27;s prospective nomination of Republican Chuck Hagel as U.S. Secretary of Defense in late 2012. Cohen was quoted as saying:

If you have somebody there [at Defense] who&#x27;s already made it clear that he does not want to engage in a confrontation with Iran, what kind of negotiating leverage do we have? ... You want to have as secretary of defense somebody who&#x27;s the heavy. Somebody who&#x27;s the guy who looks as if he&#x27;s perfectly capable of waging war against you and happy to do it. That&#x27;s just kind of elementary negotiating tactics.

===2014 Russian annexation of Crimea===

Cohen wrote an op-ed piece in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; on 3 March 2014, between the ousting of Viktor Yanukovich on 22 February and the Crimean referendum on 16 March. In it, he maintains that &quot;Putin is indeed a brutal Great Russian nationalist who understands that Russia without a belt of subservient client states is not merely a very weak power but also vulnerable to the kind of upheaval that toppled Yanukovych’s corrupt and oppressive regime.&quot; He mentions &quot;The New York Times &quot;publication of the op-ed by Putin on the Syrian chemical arms question and links to the text of the NATO accord as a token of good faith.

=== Never Trump movement ===

Cohen wrote an op-ed piece in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; on 15 November 2016 after the 2016 presidential election affirming his stance against the presidency of Donald Trump. In the piece he states:
I am a national security Never-Trumper who, after the election, made the case that young conservatives should volunteer to serve in the new administration, warily, their undated letters of resignation ready. That advice, I have concluded, was wrong. [...] My friend was seething with anger directed at those of us who had opposed Donald Trump — even those who stood ready to help steer good people to an administration that understandably wanted nothing to do with the likes of me, someone who had been out front in opposing Trump since the beginning.

Cohen also wrote an op-ed piece in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; on 29 January 2017 commenting on his distaste for Donald Trump as a person:
Many conservative foreign-policy and national-security experts saw the dangers last spring and summer, which is why we signed letters denouncing not Trump&#x27;s policies but his temperament; not his program but his character. We were right. And friends who urged us to tone it down, to make our peace with him, to stop saying as loudly as we could &quot;this is abnormal,&quot; to accommodate him, to show loyalty to the Republican Party, to think that he and his advisers could be tamed, were wrong.

In 2020, Cohen, along with over 130 other former Republican national security officials, signed a statement asserting Trump was unfit to serve another term, and &quot;To that end, we are firmly convinced that it is in the best interest of our nation that Vice President Joe Biden be elected as the next President of the United States, and we will vote for him.&quot;

<doc id="913759" wikidata="Q853073" url="?curid=913759" title="Lois Griffin">
<text>Lois Patrice Griffin ( Pewterschmidt) is a fictional character from the American animated television series &quot;Family Guy&quot;. She is voiced by Alex Borstein and first appeared in the show&#x27;s pilot episode, &quot;Death Has a Shadow&quot;, on January 31, 1999. Writer Seth MacFarlane created and designed Lois after his 1995 student film, &quot;The Life of Larry&quot;, was picked up by 20th Century Fox for a series order. Lois is the matriarch of the Griffin family. She and her husband Peter have three children: Meg, Chris, and Stewie.

==Role in &quot;Family Guy&quot;==
Lois Griffin was born to affluent WASP parents, Carter and Barbara Pewterschmidt. It is revealed in the episode &quot;Family Goy&quot; that her mother is actually a Jewish American Holocaust survivor who concealed her Judaism, though Lois was raised a Protestant. Lois and the rest of the Griffins live in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, which is modeled after Cranston, Rhode Island. Lois speaks with a distinctive nasal New England accent. In the episode &quot;A Lot Going on Upstairs&quot;, Lois’s drivers license reveals that her height is . Lois primarily works as a housewife throughout the series, though she did give piano lessons in early episodes. She has also had various jobs in single episodes such as in &quot;FOX-y Lady&quot;, where she becomes the new reporter for Fox News Channel, in &quot;It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One&quot;, Lois is elected the mayor of Quahog, and in &quot;Call Girl&quot; Lois gets a job doing phone sex. In the episode &quot;Take a Letter&quot;, Lois works at post office. In the episode &quot;Dammit Janet!&quot; Lois gets a job as a flight attendant. Lois is a championship boxer who retires with an undefeated record of 18–0 in the episode &quot;Baby, You Knock Me Out&quot;. Lois is also a Black belt in Tae-Jitsu, which she quickly achieved in the episode &quot;Lethal Weapons&quot;. In &quot;The Fat Guy Strangler&quot;, Lois is revealed to have a murderous brother.

==Character==
===Creation===
While still in college, &quot;Family Guy&quot; creator Seth MacFarlane created a cartoon short called &quot;The Life of Larry&quot;. The short centered around a middle-aged man named Larry and his anthropomorphic dog Steve; other characters are his patient wife Lois and his overweight teenage son Milt. He made a sequel called &quot;Larry &amp; Steve&quot;, which Cartoon Network broadcast in 1997. In 1999, MacFarlane was working for Hanna-Barbera Studios, writing for shows such as &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot;, &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, and &quot;Cow and Chicken&quot;. The short caught the eye of 20th Century Fox representatives, who asked him to create a TV series revolving around the characters. MacFarlane was given a US $50,000 budget to develop a pilot for the show, which was about one twentieth of what most pilots cost. MacFarlane claims to have drawn inspiration from several sitcoms, including &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;All in the Family&quot;. Several premises were also carried over from several 1980s Saturday morning cartoons he watched as a child, namely &quot;The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang&quot;, and &quot;Rubik, the Amazing Cube&quot;.

In three months, MacFarlane created the Griffin family and developed a pilot for the show he called &quot;Family Guy&quot;. Brian&#x27;s character was largely based on Steve from the &quot;Larry and Steve&quot; cartoon, with Larry serving as the primary basis of the Peter character. While Larry and Peter&#x27;s wives share the same name, they do not resemble one another. Peter&#x27;s son Chris, by contrast, harbors a design similarity to Larry&#x27;s son Milt. Stewie and Meg were new characters that were completely new at the time, and were not based on old Seth MacFarlane characters. Peter&#x27;s personality was also inspired by a friend of his father who fell asleep while watching the 1993 film &quot;Philadelphia&quot;. The network executives were impressed with the pilot and ordered thirteen episodes, giving MacFarlane a $2 million per-season contract.

===Voice===

Lois Griffin is voiced by producer and staff writer Alex Borstein who also voices recurring characters such as Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa, Loretta Brown and Lois&#x27; mother Barbara Pewterschmidt. Borstein has been part of the main voice cast from the beginning of the series including the pilot, and has voiced Lois from the start.

At the time when &quot;Family Guy&quot; was being developed, Borstein was working in the sketch comedy, &quot;MADtv&quot;. She was asked to audition by a member of the &quot;MADtv&quot; staff who was helping MacFarlane develop the show. She had not met MacFarlane or seen any artwork and said it was &quot;really sight unseen&quot;. At the time, she was doing a stage show in Los Angeles, in which she played a redhead mother, whose voice she had based on one of her cousins from Long Island, New York. She took the voice of the character to the set and used it for Lois. The voice was originally slower; when MacFarlane heard it, he asked her to make it faster and higher. Borstein has noted that the voice of Lois has been changing from the slower original voice to the quicker up tempo voice of the present episodes.

There have been rare occasions where Borstein does not voice Lois, such as in the episode &quot;Road to the Multiverse&quot;, where Lois is instead voiced by Japanese actress Kei Ogawa, who was required for a scene where everything in the world was Japanese (she also did the voice of Meg for the scene).

===Personality===
Lois&#x27;s personality has evolved throughout the episodes. She is commonly the voice of reason to Peter&#x27;s tomfoolery and shenanigans, but in some episodes she can act darker than normal and sometimes shows a taste for sadomasochism. In the episode &quot;The Son Also Draws&quot;, Lois had a gambling addiction when the family went to a Native American casino and lost the family car. In the episode &quot;Model Misbehavior&quot;, Lois becomes a bulimic model. However, in &quot;Sibling Rivalry&quot;, just the opposite happens where Lois gains a ton of weight after Peter has a vasectomy and loses his sex drive. After outgrowing Peter&#x27;s size, she discovers she enjoys being fat, leading to a new sex life where she lets Peter force feed her junk food so she can continue to grow bigger and fatter. &quot;Stuck Together, Torn Apart&quot; shows Peter and Lois splitting up because of Peter&#x27;s jealousy, only to discover that Lois has the same jealousy. The two then decide to live together again despite their mutually jealous nature.

===Sexuality===
Several episodes have suggested that Lois is bisexual or, at least, bi-curious. In an interview, Borstein stated that Lois became &quot;a little more snarky and sassy and sexual&quot; since the first season, to challenge &quot;those sitcom rules that a woman is supposed to be a total wet blanket and not like sex and is no fun&quot;. In the first straight-to-DVD feature, &quot;Stewie Griffin, The Untold Story&quot;, Lois also states, &quot;women are such teases. That&#x27;s why I went back to men.&quot; She reveals in &quot;Partial Terms of Endearment&quot; that she had a lesbian affair with Naomi while they were students at Salve Regina University, and she passionately kisses Meg&#x27;s lesbian classmate Sarah in &quot;Brian Sings and Swings&quot;. Lois fantasizes about running away with Target cashier Esparanza in &quot;Prescription Heroine&quot;. In the pilot episode for &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;, she and Bonnie make out to fulfill Cleveland, Peter, Quagmire, and Brian&#x27;s wishes.

==Reception==
===Commendations===
Lois Griffin ranked number 12 spot on &quot;IGN&#x27;s Top 25 Family Guy Characters&quot;. In &quot;IGN&#x27;s top 10 musical moments in Family Guy&quot; ranked number three spot with the song, &quot;This House Is Freakin&#x27; Sweet&quot; from the episode, &quot;Peter, Peter, Caviar Eater&quot;, (season 2, 1999). In &quot;IGN&#x27;s Family Guy: Top 10 Fights&quot;, Lois ranked on two places, in number seven and number six for Lois&#x27;s fight with Stewie in &quot;Lois Kills Stewie&quot; and in the Griffin Family Fight from &quot;Lethal Weapons&quot;, respectively.

==Legacy==

===Appearances in other media===
Lois has had several television appearances outside of &quot;Family Guy&quot;. She and Peter both had a cameo on &quot;Drawn Together&quot; in the episode &quot;The Lemon-AIDS Walk&quot; where she was voiced by Borstein. She, along with the rest of her family, appeared on &quot;South Park&quot; in the episodes &quot;Cartoon Wars Part I&quot; and &quot;Part II&quot;. In the &quot;Family Guy&quot; parodies of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; original trilogy titled &quot;Blue Harvest&quot;, &quot;Something, Something, Something, Dark Side&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s A Trap&quot; which are parodies of &quot;A New Hope&quot;, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; respectively, Lois appears as Princess Leia. Lois, and most of the central characters on &quot;Family Guy&quot;, also appeared in the pilot episode of the show&#x27;s spin-off &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;. She came in at No. 85 out of 100 on &quot;Maxim&quot;&#x27;s 2012 Hot 100. She also appears in HBO&#x27;s &quot;Animals&quot; Season 2 episode, &quot;Pigeon&quot;. She along with the family appeared in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode, &quot;Homerland&quot; and the short film &quot;May the 12th Be with You&quot; along with his sons Meg, Chris, and Stewie.

===Merchandise===
Lois is also featured on the &quot;Family Guy: Live in Vegas&quot; CD, and plays a significant part in &quot;Family Guy Video Game!&quot;, the first &quot;Family Guy&quot; video game, which was released by 2K Games in 2006. Borstein recorded exclusive material of Lois for a 2007 pinball machine of the show by Stern Pinball. In 2004, the first series of &quot;Family Guy&quot; toy figurines was released by Mezco Toyz, each member of the Griffin family had their own, except for Stewie, of whom two different figures were made. Over the course of two years, four more series of toy figures have been released, with various forms of Peter.

As of 2009, six books have been released about the &quot;Family Guy&quot; universe, all published by HarperCollins since 2005. These include &quot;Family Guy: It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One&quot; (), which covers the entire events of the episode &quot;It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One&quot;, and &quot;Family Guy and Philosophy: A Cure for the Petarded&quot; (), a collection of seventeen essays exploring the connections between the series and historical philosophers which include Lois as a character.

<text>Aaron Louis Friedberg (born April 16, 1956) is an American political scientist. He served from 2003 to 2005 in the office of the Vice President of the United States as deputy assistant for national-security affairs and director of policy planning.

After receiving his PhD in government from Harvard University, Friedberg joined the Princeton University faculty in 1987 and was appointed professor of politics and international affairs in 1999. He has served as Director of Princeton&#x27;s Research Program in International Security at the Woodrow Wilson School as well as acting director of the Center of International Studies at Princeton. Friedberg is a former fellow at the Smithsonian Institution’s Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, the Norwegian Nobel Institute, and Harvard University’s Center for International Affairs. He also serves as Chairman of the Board of Counselors for the National Bureau of Asian Research&#x27;s Pyle Center for Northeast Asian Studies.

In September 2001, Friedberg began a nine-month residential appointment as the first Henry Alfred Kissinger Scholar at the Library of Congress. During his tenure he researched &quot;the rise of Asia and its implications for America.&quot; Apart from many articles for &quot;Commentary&quot; magazine, Friedberg has written several books on foreign relations.

He was one of the signers of the Project for the New American Century (PNAC) documents &quot;Statement of Principles&quot; (June 3, 1997) and a letter on terrorism submitted to President George W. Bush (September 20, 2001). His name has been connected to the Aspen Strategy Group at the Aspen Institute.

Friedberg represented the Romney campaign in his capacity as the campaign&#x27;s National Security Advisor during a debate on US policy toward China in October 2012.

In 2020, Friedberg, along with over 130 other former Republican national security officials, signed a statement that asserted that President Trump was unfit to serve another term, and &quot;To that end, we are firmly convinced that it is in the best interest of our nation that Vice President Joe Biden be elected as the next President of the United States, and we will vote for him.&quot;

Friedberg co-founded the Alexander Hamilton Society, a non-partisan membership organization based in DC, along with Dan Blumenthal and Roy Katzovicz in March 2010. He continues to serve on its board of directors.

== International relations philosophy ==

Although Friedberg&#x27;s international relations philosophy is rooted in concern for the structural organization of power characteristic of the realist school of international relations, he draws from many of the traditions of liberal institutionalism, resulting in what scholar Thomas Christensen has termed a &quot;positive-sum&quot; stance on international relations. Hence, unlike more pessimistic realist scholars, Friedberg, in a seminal article published in International Security in 1993, advocated continued U.S. engagement in East Asia to serve as a stabilizing force until regional economic integration and multilateral institutions had time to develop. Thus, in contrast to traditional realpolitik scholars, Friedberg believes that conflict is not inevitable in East Asia as China continues to develop as long as multilateral institutions and economic integration are used as tools to manage security dilemmas.

<doc id="913769" wikidata="Q647160" url="?curid=913769" title="Palaestra">
<text>A palaestra ( or ;
also (chiefly British) palestra; ) was any site of an ancient Greek wrestling school. Events requiring little space, such as boxing and wrestling, took place there. Palaestrae functioned both independently and as a part of public gymnasia; a palaestra could exist without a gymnasium, but no gymnasium existed without a palaestra.

== Etymology ==

Compare Ancient Greek &quot;palaiein&quot; - &quot;to wrestle&quot; and &quot;palē&quot; - &quot;wrestling&quot;.

Palaestrophylax or palaistrophylax (), meaning “palaestra guard”, was the guardian or the director of a Palaestra.

The spelling is notable for the fact that it is usually spelled &quot;palestra&quot; in the United Kingdom, while in the United States it is spelled &quot;palaestra&quot;. This is a reverse of the usual rule for such words, where the &quot;ae&quot;/&quot;oe&quot; is used in British spelling but changed to &quot;e&quot; in American spelling.

==Architecture==
===Greek===
The architecture of the palaestra, although allowing for some variation, followed a distinct, standard plan. The palaestra essentially consisted of a rectangular court surrounded by colonnades with adjoining rooms. These rooms might house a variety of functions: bathing, ball playing, undressing and storage of clothes, seating for socializing, observation, or instruction, and storage of oil, dust or athletic equipment. Good examples of this building type come from two major Greek sites: Olympia and Delphi.

Vitruvius, through his text &quot;De architectura&quot;, is an important ancient source about this building type and provides a description of the Palaestra, &quot;as constructed by the Greeks&quot; in Book 5, chapter 11. Although the specifics of his descriptions do not always correspond to the architectural evidence, probably because he was a Roman author primarily interested in Italian architecture, his account provides insight into the general design and uses of this type of space. As Vitruvius describes it, the palaestra was square or rectangular in shape with colonnades along all four sides creating porticoes, with a total internal perimeter of two stadia (the length of the diaulos race, thus modern scholars sometimes refer to this whole structure as a diaulos). The portico on the northern side of the palaestra was of double depth to protect against the weather. Rounded halls with seats (&quot;exedrae&quot;, ἐξέδραι) were built along the single depth sides of the palaestra for the use of philosophers, orators, and other scholars. The double-depth side was divided into three sections. In the centre was a larger exedra (&quot;ephebeum&quot;) for use by the ephebes (young adult men undergoing state-run education/military training). On the left there was a punching bag room (&quot;coryceum&quot;, κωρυκεῖον), a storeroom for sand/powder used to improve wrestlers&#x27; grip (&quot;conisterium&quot;, κονιστἠριον), and a room for cold bathing (&quot;loutrón&quot;, ). On the right there was an oil storeroom (&quot;elaeothesium&quot;, ἐλαιοθέσιον), a cold pool (&quot;frigidarium&quot;), a furnace (&quot;propnigeum&quot;, προπνίγειον), a vaulted sauna (&quot;sudatio&quot;), a dry sweating-room (&quot;laconicum&quot;), and a hot bath. To the north of the palaestra was a second courtyard, surrounded by porticoes on three sides, but open on the north. One of these porticoes was double-width and contained a covered wrestling arena (&quot;ξυστός&quot;, Romanised as &quot;xystus&quot;) for use during inclement weather. The space between the three porticoes contained walkways lined with trees (&quot;xysta&quot; to the Romans, παραδρομίδες, &quot;paradromides&quot; to the Greeks).

===Roman baths===
During the Roman Imperial period the palaestra was often combined with, or joined to, a full bathing complex. When the Arabs and the Turks adopted the tradition of Roman baths as the hammam, they did not continue the tradition of the attached palaestra.

<doc id="913777" wikidata="Q8048" url="?curid=913777" title="Seti II">
<text>Seti II (or Sethos II) was the fifth pharaoh of the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt and reigned from  1203 BC to 1197 BC. His throne name, Userkheperure Setepenre, means &quot;Powerful are the manifestations of Re, the chosen one of Re.&quot; He was the son of Merneptah and Isetnofret II and occupied the throne during a period known for dynastic intrigue and short reigns, and his rule was no different. Seti II had to deal with many serious plots, most significantly the accession of a rival king named Amenmesse, possibly a half brother, who seized control over Thebes and Nubia in Upper Egypt during his second to fourth regnal years.

==Contest for the throne==
Evidence that Amenmesse was a direct contemporary with Seti II&#x27;s rule—rather than Seti II&#x27;s immediate predecessor—includes the fact that Seti II&#x27;s royal KV15 tomb at Thebes was deliberately vandalised with many of Seti&#x27;s royal names being carefully erased here during his reign. The erasures were subsequently repaired by Seti II&#x27;s agents. This suggests that Seti II&#x27;s reign at Thebes was interrupted by the rise of a rival: king Amenmesse in Upper Egypt. Secondly, the German scholar Wolfgang Helck has shown that Amenmesse is only attested in Upper Egypt by several Year 3 and a single Year 4 ostracas; Helck also noted that no Year 1 or Year 2 ostracas from Deir El Medina could legitimately be assigned to Amenmesse&#x27;s reign. This conforms well with the clear evidence of Seti II&#x27;s control over Thebes in his first two years, which is attested by various documents and papyri. In contrast, Seti II is absent from Upper Egypt during his third and fourth years which are notably unattested—presumably because Amenmesse controlled this region during this time.
Finally, and most importantly, it is well known that the chief foreman of Deir el-Medina, a certain Neferhotep, was killed in the reign of king Amenmesse on the orders of a certain &#x27;Msy&#x27; who was either Amenmesse himself or one of this king&#x27;s agents, according to Papyrus Salt 124. However, Neferhotep is attested in office in the work register list of Ostraca MMA 14.6.217, which also recorded Seti II&#x27;s accession to the throne and was later reused to register workers&#x27; absences under this king&#x27;s reign. If Seti II&#x27;s 6-year reign followed that of the usurper Amenmesse, then this chief foreman would not have been mentioned in a document which dated to the start of Seti II&#x27;s reign since Neferhotep was already dead. This indicates that the reigns of Amenmesse and Seti II must have partly overlapped with one another and suggests that both rulers were rivals who were fighting each another for the throne of Egypt.

During the second to fourth years of Amenmesse/Seti II&#x27;s parallel reigns, Amenmesse gained the upper hand and seized control over Upper Egypt and Nubia; he ordered Seti II&#x27;s tomb in the Valley of the Kings to be vandalised. Prior to his fifth year, however, Amenmesse was finally defeated by his rival, Seti II, who was the legitimate successor to the throne since he was Merneptah&#x27;s son. Seti II, in turn, launched a damnatio memoriae campaign against all inscriptions and monuments belonging to both Amenmesse and this king&#x27;s chief supporters in Thebes and Nubia, which included a certain Khaemter, a former Viceroy of Kush, who had served as Amenmesse&#x27;s Vizier. Seti II&#x27;s agents completely erased both scenes and texts from KV10, the royal tomb of Amenmesse. Vizier Khaemter&#x27;s scenes in Nubia which were carved when he served as the Viceroy of Kush were so thoroughly erased that until Rolf Krauss&#x27; and Labib Habachi&#x27;s articles were published in the 1970s, his career here as viceroy was almost unknown, notes Frank J. Yurco.

==Reign==

Seti II promoted Chancellor Bay to become his most important state official and built 3 tombs – KV13, KV14, and KV15 – for himself, his Senior Queen Twosret and Bay in the Valley of the Kings. This was an unprecedented act on his part for Bay, who was of Syrian descent and was not connected by marriage or blood ties to the royal family. Because Seti II had his accession between II Peret 29 and III Peret 6 while Siptah—Seti II&#x27;s successor—had his accession around late IV Akhet to early I Peret 2, Seti&#x27;s 6th and final regnal year lasted about 10 months; therefore, Seti II ruled Egypt for 5 years and 10 months or almost 6 full years when he died.

Due to the relative brevity of his reign, Seti&#x27;s tomb was unfinished at the time of his death. Twosret later rose to power herself after the death of Siptah, Seti II&#x27;s successor. According to an inscribed ostraca document from the Deir el-Medina worker&#x27;s community, Seti II&#x27;s death was announced to the workmen by &quot;The [Chief of] police Nakht-min&quot; on Year 6, I Peret 19 of Seti II&#x27;s reign. Since it would have taken time for the news of Seti II&#x27;s death to reach Thebes from the capital city of Pi-Ramesses in Lower Egypt, the date of I Peret 19 only marks the day the news of the king&#x27;s death reached Deir el-Medina. Seti II likely died sometime late in IV Akhet or early in I Peret; Wolfgang Helck and R.J. Demarée have now proposed I Peret 2 as the date of Seti II&#x27;s actual death, presumably since it is 70 days before the day of his burial. From a graffito written in the first corridor of Twosret&#x27;s KV14 tomb, Seti II was buried in his KV15 tomb on &quot;Year 1, III Peret day 11&quot; of Siptah&#x27;s reign.

Seti II&#x27;s earliest prenomen in his First Year was &#x27;Userkheperure Setepenre&#x27; which is written above an inscription of Messuy, a Viceroy of Nubia under Merneptah, on a rock outcropping at Bigeh Island. However, Messuy&#x27;s burial in Tomb S90 in Nubia has been discovered to contain only funerary objects naming Merneptah which suggests that 1) Messuy may have died during Merneptah&#x27;s reign and 2) Seti II may have merely associated himself with an official who had actively served his father as Viceroy of Kush. Seti II soon changed his royal name to &#x27;Userkheperure Meryamun&#x27;, which was the most common form of his prenomen.

Two important papyri date from the reign of Seti II. The first of these is the &quot;Tale of Two Brothers&quot;, a fabulous story of troubles within a family on the death of their father, which may have been intended in part as political satire on the situation of the two half brothers. The second is the records of the trial of Paneb. Neferhotep, one of the two chief workmen of the Deir el-Medina necropolis, had been replaced by Paneb, his troublesome son-in-law. Many crimes were alleged by Neferhotep&#x27;s brother—Amennakhte—against Paneb in a violently worded indictment preserved in papyrus now in the British Museum. If Amennakhte&#x27;s testimony can be trusted, Paneb had allegedly stolen stone from the tomb of Seti II while still working on its completion—for the embellishment of his own tomb—besides purloining or damaging other property belonging to that monarch. Paneb was also accused of trying to kill Neferhotep, his adopted father-in-law, despite being educated by the latter and after the murder of Neferhotep by &#x27;the enemy,&#x27; Paneb had reportedly bribed the Vizier Pra&#x27;emhab in order to usurp his father&#x27;s office. Whatever the truth of these accusations, it is clear that Thebes was going through very troubled times. There are references elsewhere to a &#x27;war&#x27; that had occurred during these years, but it is obscure to what this word alludes—perhaps to no more than internal disturbances and discontent. Neferhotep had complained of Paneb&#x27;s attacks on himself to the vizier Amenmose, presumably a predecessor of Pra&#x27;emhab, whereupon Amenmose had punished Paneb. This trouble-maker had then brought a complaint before &#x27;Mose&#x27; (i.e., &#x27;Msy&#x27;), who then acted to remove Pra&#x27;emhab from his office. Evidently this &#x27;Mose&#x27; must have been a person of the highest importance, perhaps the king Amenmesse himself or a senior ally of the king.

Seti II also expanded the copper mining at Timna Valley in Edom, building an important temple to Hathor, the cow goddess, in the region. It was abandoned in the late Bronze Age collapse, where a part of the temple seems to have been used by Midianite nomads, linked to the worship of a bronze serpent discovered in the area. Seti II also founded a station for a barge on the courtyard in front of the pylon II at Karnak, and chapels of the Theban Triad – Amun, Mut and Khonsu.

==Wives and treasure==
Of the wives of Seti II, Twosret and Takhat seem certain. Twosret would rule as regent for Siptah and later as Pharaoh. Her name is recorded in Manetho&#x27;s Epitome as a certain &#x27;Thuoris&#x27; who is assigned a reign of 7 years.

Takhat bears the title of &quot;King&#x27;s Daughter&quot; which would make her the offspring of either Ramesses II or Merenptah. A list of princesses dated to Year 53 of Ramesses II names a Takhat who is not included in earlier lists. This would make her about the same age or younger than Seti II. The traditional view has been that the rivals were half-brothers, with Takhat as Queen to Merenptah and mother to Amenmesse while the mother of Seti II was Isetnofret II.

Takhat is shown on several statues of Amenmesse and on one of these, she is called &quot;King&#x27;s Daughter&quot; and &quot;King&#x27;s Wife&quot; with the word &#x27;wife&#x27; inscribed over &#x27;Mother&#x27;. According to Aidan Dodson the title was recarved when Seti regained control and usurped the statue. This would seem to indicate that Takhat was married to Seti and that Amenmesse was Seti&#x27;s son and usurped the throne from his own father. Dodson allows that there may have been two women named Takhat, but the treatment of the image of Takhat makes it unlikely.

For many years, a certain Tiaa was also accepted as a wife of Seti II and mother of Siptah. This was based on a number of funerary objects found in the tomb of Siptah bearing the name of Tiaa as King&#x27;s Wife and King&#x27;s Mother. However, it now seems that these items washed into Siptah&#x27;s tomb from the nearby tomb, KV32, as the result of an accidental breakthrough. KV32 is the tomb of the wife of Thutmose IV, Tiaa.

In January 1908, the Egyptologist Edward R. Ayrton, in an excavation conducted for Theodore M. Davis, discovered a small burial in tomb KV56 which Davis referred to as &#x27;The Gold Tomb&#x27; in his publication of the discovery in the Valley of the Kings; it proved to contain a small cache of jewelry that featured the name of Seti II. A set of &quot;earrings, finger-rings, bracelets, a series of necklace ornaments and amulets, a pair of silver &#x27;gloves&#x27; and a tiny silver sandal&quot; were found within this tomb.

==Mummy==

In April 2021 his mummy was moved from the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities to the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization along with those of 17 other kings and 4 queens in an event termed the Pharaohs&#x27; Golden Parade.

<doc id="913778" wikidata="Q120248" url="?curid=913778" title="Fred Iklé">
<text>Fred Charles Iklé (né Fritz Karl Iklé; August 21, 1924 – November 10, 2011) was a Swiss-American sociologist and defense expert. Iklé&#x27;s expertise was in defense and foreign policy, nuclear strategy, and the role of technology in the emerging international order. After a career in academia (including a professorship at MIT) he was appointed director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in 1973–1977, before becoming Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (1981 to 1988). He was later a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Department of Defense&#x27;s Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee, a Distinguished Scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and a Director of the National Endowment for Democracy.

Iklé is credited with a key role in increasing U.S. aid to anti-Soviet rebels in the Soviet–Afghan War. He successfully proposed and promoted the idea of supplying the rebels with anti-aircraft Stinger missiles, overcoming CIA opposition.

Iklé was a second cousin of Elisabeth Kopp, the first woman in the Swiss Federal Council, elected in 1984.

==Early life and education==
Iklé was born Fritz Karl Iklé on August 21, 1924, in Samedan, Switzerland, the youngest of four children, to Friedrich Arnold Iklé (1877–1946) and Maria Hedwig Iklé (née Huber). He is of German Jewish descent through his paternal grandfather, Leopold Iklé, who hailed from Hamburg and became a citizen in St. Gallen, operating &quot;Iklé Brothers&quot; trading in silk and embroidery. Through this family connection he is a second cousin of Elisabeth Kopp (née Iklé) who was a member of the Federal Council (Switzerland).

He anglicized his name after moving to the United States in 1946. He earned a degree at the University of Zurich with a master&#x27;s and doctorate from the University of Chicago (1948 and 1950), both in sociology. His doctorate involved research in Dresden and Nagasaki and led to a book, &quot;The Social Impact of Bomb Destruction,&quot; (1958).

In 1962, Iklé was cited in a bestselling American novel on the risks of accidental nuclear war, &quot;Fail-Safe&quot;, as an example of one of &quot;the right people&quot; whose warnings should have been heeded: &quot;...for years there has been a fellow named Fred Iklé, who has been working with the Rand Corporation and the Air Force on how to reduce war by accident. He has found flaw after flaw in the system, at just the same time that the newspapers were saying it was perfect.&quot; From 1964 to 1967 Iklé was a professor in political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As well as Rand, Iklé was also at Harvard University&#x27;s Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, where he met Henry Kissinger, who in 1973 (while serving as Richard Nixon&#x27;s national security advisor) recruited Iklé to government service.

==Career==
From 1973 to 1977 Iklé served as director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. After the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980, Iklé was appointed Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, serving from 1981 to 1988.

===Under Secretary of Defense===
As an under secretary of defense, Iklé led the effort to lobby for National Security Decision Directive 166 (&quot;Expanded US Aid to Afghan Guerrillas&quot;), signed by Reagan in March 1985. When he visited Pakistan in April 1985, Iklé found that the CIA was still pursuing the war in a halfhearted manner. &quot;We began to understand that what to us was a very big deal back in Washington, from the point of view of the president, is a second order priority handled by one GS [civil service officer],&quot; according to Michael Pillsbury, Iklé&#x27;s deputy.

Iklé sponsored a proposal to supply the rebels with Stinger shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles. The Stinger proposal was at first strongly opposed by the CIA, the U.S. State Department, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. CIA Deputy Director John McMahon, who resisted the proposal, was the target of a letter-writing campaign by conservative groups. At a meeting on December 6, 1985, Iklé asked McMahon if the CIA needed Stingers. &quot;I decided then and there that I had enough of carrying water for the Joint Chiefs and I said &#x27;Fred, I&#x27;ll take every Stinger you can send me,&#x27;&quot; McMahon recalled. Despite McMahon&#x27;s apparent change of heart, the CIA again vetoed the Stinger proposal at an interagency meeting in mid-February 1986. President Reagan signed an executive order to supply the Angolan guerrilla group UNITA with Stingers on February 18, and the CIA finally agreed to supply them to the Afghan rebels on February 23.

==Later life==
Iklé remained at the Defense Department until 1988, when he joined the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). Iklé served as a Commissioner on the National Commission on Terrorism, which produced the Report of the National Commission on Terrorism in June 2000, and he served for nine years as Director of the National Endowment for Democracy.

He also co-chaired the bipartisan Commission on Integrated Long-Term Strategy, which published &quot;Discriminate Deterrence&quot; in January 1988. In 1975 and 1987, Iklé received the highest civilian award of the Department of Defense, the Medal for Distinguished Public Service. In 1988, he was awarded the Bronze Palm.

Iklé served as chairman of the Board of the Telos Corporation and as a director of the Zurich-American Insurance Companies. He was a Director of CMC Energy Services and served as Governor of the Smith Richardson Foundation and as a Director of the U.S. Committee for Human Rights in North Korea.

He was a founding signatory of the Project for the New American Century&#x27;s 1997 &quot;statement of principles.&quot;

He was the author of several books and numerous articles on defense, foreign policy, and arms control, including &quot;How Nations Negotiate&quot; and &quot;Every War Must End&quot;.

== Personal life ==
On December 23, 1959, Iklé married Doris Margaret Eisemann (1928–2012), an economist of German Jewish origins. They had two daughters together;

* Judith Iklé (b.c. 1960s), who married Aaron Maizlish, a businessman of San Francisco, California. Two children; Leo Iklé-Maizlish (b.c. 2000) and Anna Iklé-Maizlish (b.c. 2004) 
* Miriam Iklé-Khalsa (b.c. 1960s), who married Sat Jiwan Iklé-Khalsa. One daughter; Kyah S. Iklé-Khalsa (born April 6, 2007). Both of Takoma Park, Maryland.

Iklé died in Bethesda, Maryland on November 10, 2011.

==Awards==
* the Department of Defense&#x27;s &quot;Medal for Distinguished Public Service&quot; (1987)
* the Bronze Palm (1988)
* the National Endowment for Democracy&#x27;s &quot;Democracy Service Medal&quot; (2001).

<doc id="913779" wikidata="Q945011" url="?curid=913779" title="Norman Podhoretz">
<text>Norman Podhoretz (; born January 16, 1930) is an American magazine editor, writer, and conservative political commentator, who identifies his views as &quot;paleo-neoconservative&quot;, but only &quot;because (he&#x27;s) been one for so long&quot;. He is a writer for &quot;Commentary&quot; magazine, and previously served as the publication&#x27;s editor-in-chief from 1960 to 1995.

==Early life and education==
The son of Julius and Helen (Woliner) Podhoretz, Jewish immigrants from the Central European region of Galicia (then part of Poland, now Ukraine), Podhoretz was born and raised in Brownsville, Brooklyn. Podhoretz&#x27;s family was leftist, with his elder sister joining a socialist youth movement. He skipped two grades and attended the prestigious Boys High School in the borough&#x27;s Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, ultimately graduating third in his class in 1946; his classmates included the prominent Assyriologist William W. Hallo and advertising executive Carl Spielvogel. Following his admission to Harvard University and New York University with partial tuition scholarships, Podhoretz ultimately elected to attend Columbia University when he was granted a full Pulitzer Scholarship.

In 1950, Podhoretz received his BA degree in English literature from Columbia, where he was mentored by Lionel Trilling. He concurrently earned a second bachelor&#x27;s degree in Hebrew literature from the nearby Jewish Theological Seminary of America; although Podhoretz never intended to enter the rabbinate, his father (who only attended synagogue on the High Holidays) wanted to ensure that his son was nonetheless conversant in &quot;the intellectual tradition of his people&quot;, as &quot;a nonobservant New World Jew who ... treasured the Hebraic tradition&quot;.

After being awarded the Kellett Fellowship from Columbia and a Fulbright Scholarship, he later received a second B.A. in literature with first-class honors and an Oxbridge MA from Clare College, Cambridge, where he briefly pursued doctoral studies after rejecting a graduate fellowship from Harvard. He also served in the United States Army from 1953 to 1955 as a draftee assigned to the Army Security Agency.

==Career==
Podhoretz served as &quot;Commentary&quot; magazine&#x27;s Editor-in-Chief from 1960 (when he replaced Elliot E. Cohen) until his retirement in 1995. Podhoretz remains &quot;Commentary&quot;&#x27;s Editor-at-Large. In 1963, he wrote the essay &quot;My Negro Problem—And Ours&quot;, in which he described the oppression he felt from African-Americans as a child, and concluded by calling for a color-blind society, and advocated &quot;the wholesale merging of the two races [as] the most desirable alternative for everyone concerned.&quot;

From 1981 to 1987, Podhoretz was an adviser to the U.S. Information Agency. From 1995 to 2003, he was a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by George W. Bush in 2004. The award recognized Podhoretz&#x27;s intellectual contributions as editor-in-chief of Commentary magazine and as a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.

Norman Podhoretz was one of the original signatories of the &quot;Statement of Principles&quot; of the Project for the New American Century founded in 1997. That organization sent a letter to President Clinton in 1998 advocating the removal by force of Saddam Hussein in Iraq.

Podhoretz received the Guardian of Zion Award from Bar-Ilan University on May 24, 2007.

He served as a senior foreign policy advisor to Rudy Giuliani in his 2008 presidential campaign. The same year, he publicly advocated an American attack on Iran.

Podhoretz&#x27;s 2009 book &quot;Why Are Jews Liberals?&quot; questions why American Jews for decades have been dependable Democrats, often supporting the party by margins of better than two-to-one, even in years of Republican landslides.

==Personal life ==

Podhoretz attends a Conservative Jewish synagogue. The congregation emphasizes group study, serious praying, active participation by its members and religious services.

Podhoretz was married to author Midge Decter from 1956 until her death in 2022, and together they had two children: syndicated columnist and &quot;Commentary&quot; editor-in-chief John Podhoretz and American-Israeli journalist Ruthie Blum. Norman Podhoretz said in early 2019, of his large family and its relation to his political views: &quot;[I]f [Donald Trump] doesn&#x27;t win in 2020, I would despair of the future. I have 13 grandchildren and 12 great grandchildren, and they are hostages to fortune. So I don&#x27;t have the luxury of not caring what&#x27;s going to happen after I&#x27;m gone.&quot; , Podhoretz lives on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.

==Political views==
Initially a staunch liberal, Podhoretz moved &quot;Commentary&quot; to the left editorially when he took over the magazine. However, he became increasingly critical of the New Left and gradually moved rightward as the 1960s wore on. By the 1970s, he was a leading member of the neoconservative movement.

===Iraq War===
In the lead-up to the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, Podhoretz argued strongly for military intervention, claiming that Saddam Hussein posed a direct threat to the United States.
After the 9/11 attack and more than a year before the start of the War in Iraq, Podhoretz wrote in February 2002 that
&quot;There is no doubt that Saddam already possesses large stores of chemical and biological weapons, and may ... be &#x27;on the precipice of nuclear power.&#x27; ... Some urge that we ... concentrate on easier targets first. Others contend that the longer we wait, the more dangerous Saddam will grow. Yet whether or not Iraq becomes the second front in the war against terrorism, one thing is certain: there can be no victory in this war if it ends with Saddam Hussein still in power.&quot;

===Iranian nuclear program===
In 2007, Podhoretz argued that the United States should attack Iranian nuclear facilities. According to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Podhoretz believed that &quot;Iraq, Afghanistan and Iran are merely different fronts of the same long war.&quot; Podhoretz described diplomatic efforts with Iran as similar to appeasement of Nazi Germany prior to World War II. He also contended that the War on Terror is a war against Islamofascism, and constitutes World War IV (World War III having been the Cold War), and advocated the bombing of Iran to preempt Iranian acquisition of nuclear weapons. His book on that subject, entitled &quot;World War IV: The Long Struggle Against Islamofascism&quot;, was published by Doubleday on September 11, 2007.

In a 2007 column, Podhoretz explicitly stated his view that Iran should be attacked: &quot;In short, the plain and brutal truth is that if Iran is to be prevented from developing a nuclear arsenal, there is no alternative to the actual use of military force—any more than there was an alternative to force if Hitler was to be stopped in 1938.&quot;

===Vietnam War===
In an editorial to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; on the sixth anniversary of the September 11 attacks, Podhoretz contended that the retreat from Iraq should not be similar to the retreat from South Vietnam. He argued that when the U.S. withdrew from Vietnam, it sacrificed its national honor.

In 1982, James Fallows wrote a review of Podhoretz&#x27;s book, &quot;Why We Were in Vietnam&quot;, for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in which he accused Podhoretz of &quot;changing his views&quot; and &quot;self-righteousness&quot; on the subject of Vietnam, noting that in 1971 Podhoretz wrote that he would &quot;prefer just such an American defeat to a &#x27;Vietnamization&#x27; of the war.&quot;

The longer passage from which the 1971 quote comes is as follows:

===Soviet Union===
In the early 1980s, Podhoretz was extremely skeptical that fundamental reform was possible in the USSR, and sharply criticized those who argued that U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union should be one of détente. In his 1980 book &quot;The Present Danger&quot;, Podhoretz predicted that the United States was in danger of losing the Cold War and falling behind the Soviet Union as a global power. Later he would express anger with President Ronald Reagan for &quot;not establishing sufficiently strong policies toward the Soviets.&quot;

===George W. Bush administration===
Podhoretz praised Bush, calling him &quot;a man who knows evil when he sees it and who has demonstrated an unfailingly courageous willingness to endure vilification and contumely in setting his face against it.&quot; He called Bush the president who was &quot;battered more mercilessly and with less justification than any other in living memory.&quot;

===Sarah Palin===
In a 2010 &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; opinion piece titled &quot;In Defense of Sarah Palin&quot;, Podhoretz wrote, &quot;I hereby declare that I would rather be ruled by the Tea Party than by the Democratic Party, and I would rather have Sarah Palin sitting in the Oval Office than Barack Obama.&quot;

===Donald Trump presidency===
Podhoretz, who initially supported Marco Rubio in the 2016 Republican primaries, remarked about the primary campaign: 

Podhoretz says his views however, have caused him to lose ex-friends who were anti-Trump, saying: &quot;Well some of them have gone so far as to make me wonder whether they&#x27;ve lost their minds altogether.&quot; Of Trump, he argues: &quot;[T]he fact that Trump was elected is a kind of miracle. I now believe he&#x27;s an unworthy vessel chosen by God to save us from the evil on the Left... His virtues are the virtues of the street kids of Brooklyn. You don&#x27;t back away from a fight and you fight to win. That&#x27;s one of the things that the Americans who love him, love him for—that he&#x27;s willing to fight, not willing but eager to fight. And that&#x27;s the main virtue and all the rest stem from, as Klingenstein says, his love of America. I mean, Trump loves America.&quot;

=== Abortion ===
In 1988 Podhoretz wrote, &quot;I have recently found myself sliding toward the pro-life camp&quot; because of the potential abuses of terminating less than perfect babies and using babies as a resource for harvesting organs. He went into write, &quot;I predict that the line between legalized abortion and legitimation of infanticide is going to disappear.&quot;

=== Gay-rights movement ===
In his 1996 &quot;Commentary&quot; magazine piece &quot;How the Gay-Rights Movement Won&quot;, Podhoretz views homosexuality as a &quot;self-evident&quot; &quot;perversion&quot; , suggesting that it is politics and not science that keeps homosexuality off the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s list of mental disorders.

Podhoretz states &quot;my heart goes out to all [gay men]... because the life they live is not as good as the life available to men who make their beds with women.&quot; He goes on to declare &quot;I for one will go on withholding my assent from this triumphant march [of normalizing homosexuality].

He concludes what is at stake &quot;are the fundamental realities of life against the terrible distortions that have been introduced...by the gay-rights movement and its supporters.&quot;

Podhoretz&#x27;s wife expressed a supportive perspective in her piece &quot;The Boys on the Beach&quot; which includes references to their family vacations on Fire Island, New York, an area with a large gay population.

John Podhoretz, Norman&#x27;s son and successor as Commentary Magazine editor, announced in 2012 that he, himself, is no longer an opponent of gay marriage.

===Immigration ===
Podhoretz says that he had formerly been unthinkingly pro-immigration &quot;because I&#x27;m the child of immigrants. And I thought it was unseemly of me to oppose what not only had saved my life, but had given me the best life I think I could possibly have had.&quot; However, his views later changed: &quot;In 1924, immigration virtually stopped and the rationale for the new policy was to give newcomers a chance to assimilate—which may or may not have been the main reason—but it probably worked. What has changed my mind about immigration now—even legal immigration—is that our culture has weakened to the point where it&#x27;s no longer attractive enough for people to want to assimilate to, and we don&#x27;t insist that they do assimilate. ... That was the culture of the prewar period. You certainly wanted your children to be Americans—real Americans.&quot;

<doc id="913782" wikidata="Q908841" url="?curid=913782" title="Brian Griffin">
<text>Brian Griffin is a fictional character from the American animated sitcom &quot;Family Guy&quot;. He is one of the main characters of the series and a member of the Griffin family. Created, designed, and voiced by Seth MacFarlane, he is an anthropomorphic white labrador retriever who is the best friend of both Peter and Stewie Griffin and comic foil with the ability to speak, sing, drive, and stand on two legs.

Brian first appeared on television, along with the rest of the Griffin family, in the series premiere &quot;Death Has a Shadow&quot; on January 31, 1999. MacFarlane was asked to pitch a pilot to the Fox Broadcasting Company, based on &quot;The Life of Larry&quot; and &quot;Larry &amp; Steve&quot;, two shorts made by MacFarlane featuring a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve. These two characters were redesigned and renamed Peter and Brian, but they retained the same voices and personalities.

Brian has been featured in many items of merchandise for &quot;Family Guy&quot;, and he is considered to be one of the series&#x27; biggest merchandising characters. He has also made crossover appearances in the other MacFarlane-produced series, such as &quot;American Dad!&quot; and &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;.

As a character, Brian was initially very well received by critics, although reception in later years has been mixed. When Brian was killed off in the season 12 episode &quot;Life of Brian&quot;, the events of the episode received substantial attention from the media and elicited strongly negative reactions from fans of the series. However, it turned out to be temporary, as he made his return to the series just two episodes later in &quot;Christmas Guy&quot;, after Stewie, his best friend, traveled back in time to save him.

==Role in &quot;Family Guy&quot;==

Brian is a white-furred anthropomorphic dog. He can talk, generally walks on his hind legs (using his front legs as arms), has opposable thumbs, drives a second-generation Toyota Prius (with the license plate &quot;BRI-DOG&quot;), and is often portrayed as the only sane person in his family. He is the pet dog of the Griffin family, and in keeping with the series&#x27;s treatment of anthropomorphic characters, Brian&#x27;s human attributes receive little acknowledgment and no explanation; he is largely treated as a human character. Brian is the best friend of both Peter and Stewie, and many of the series&#x27; sub-plots center around the latter pairing. They are occasionally at the center of the plot, like in the &quot;Road to...&quot; episodes. Brian and Stewie have a love–hate relationship in which they constantly argue and humiliate each other, and yet are irreplaceable in each other&#x27;s lives. In the episode &quot;Brian and Stewie&quot;, they admit that they love each other as friends, and give each other&#x27;s lives purpose. Despite having many human traits he clearly acts like a dog many times.

Brian is an alcoholic and very fond of dry martinis; he is seen to have withdrawal symptoms in various episodes when he is told or forced to stop drinking. He smokes occasionally, although in the episode &quot;Mr. Griffin Goes to Washington&quot;, after seeing Peter promoting a corrupt cigarette company, he quit smoking, a habit he resumed at the end of that episode. He also regularly smokes marijuana. After a brief stint as a drug-sniffing dog, he developed a cocaine addiction, but after spending time in rehab he managed to achieve sobriety.

He is the son of Coco and Biscuit, who were normal dogs, though Brian&#x27;s human attributes have been present since his puppyhood. He claims his father was a racist. Brian received an Ivy League education, having attended Brown University, as seen in &quot;Brian Goes Back to College&quot;, but dropped out one course away from graduating. He is also an Iraq War veteran because Stewie signed them both up for the Army in &quot;Saving Private Brian&quot;. &quot;Family Guy&quot; uses a floating timeline in which the characters do not age much, so the series is always assumed to be set in the current year. However, several of the characters, such as Meg Griffin, have aged two to three years since the series&#x27; pilot episode, while others, such as Stewie and Brian, have aged very little. At the start of the series, Brian was 6, but he is currently 10 years old. Despite his intelligence, Brian has shown conventional dog behavior on occasion. He greatly fears the vacuum cleaner which Lois refers to as &quot;Mr. Hoover&quot;, he once ran excitedly into the kitchen when Meg shook a bag of dog food in &quot;Barely Legal&quot;, and in the episode &quot;Bill &amp; Peter&#x27;s Bogus Journey&quot; it is revealed that Brian can only defecate and urinate on the Griffins&#x27; front lawn.

In several episodes, events have been linked to specific times, although this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. An example of this is when in &quot;&quot;, Peter is shown in a flashback finding a fully grown Brian as a stray. In &quot;The Man with Two Brians&quot;, Brian tries to regain attention from the Griffin family by showing them home videos of him as a puppy, although none of the videos of him as a puppy showed any member of the Griffin family, so it is possible that the videos were filmed by a previous owner. Brian also has a human son named Dylan, who is a regular marijuana smoker, before Brian manages to turn Dylan&#x27;s life around from a violent, uneducated teenager to an eloquent and kind-hearted young man. Their relationship becomes strained over time as Brian distances himself from Dylan, until he learns that his son has been cast in a television show and uses Dylan to land a job as a writer for the show. Stewie is very confused as to how Brian as an 8-year-old dog can have a teenage son, and Brian&#x27;s remark about it being in dog years confuses him even further.

Brian is a political liberal, who supports legalizing marijuana, gay marriage and ending the war on terror. He is also an atheist, although in the episode &quot;April in Quahog&quot; he starts praying out of panic when news anchors Tom Tucker and Diane Simmons announce that the world will end (later revealed to be an April Fools&#x27; joke). In &quot;Brian and Stewie&quot;, Brian revealed that he voted for John McCain in 2008.

Despite once being portrayed as having a high intellect, more recent episodes have depicted Brian as having an average-at-best intelligence and being a fraudulent intellectual, such as pretending to be well-read or understanding concepts he does not, such as the multiverse theory in &quot;Road to the Multiverse&quot;. While he often tries to show his intelligence, he is frequently corrected by others (mainly Stewie). After taking the SATs for Meg, it is revealed that Brian actually scored the lowest in the class, which causes him to have an identity crisis; the low SAT score is later explained by Brian having a brain tumor at the time. He has since been generally insecure about his intelligence and will sometimes take credit for some of Stewie&#x27;s achievements in order to make himself look smart.

Brian sees himself as a romantic and has had several relationships over the years, mainly with human women like Rita, Ida, Padma, and Kate. Although, in &quot;Brian Dates a Bitch&quot;, he falls for female show-dog Ellie. In his romantic pursuits, Brian will often abandon his own personal beliefs and personality in order to make himself more appealing to the women he is attracted to, sometimes even resorting to lying in order to make himself look good. These relationships often end badly due to his inflated ego or being caught in a deception.

His longest-lasting relationship was with Jillian Russell, a beautiful but dimwitted girl who Brian dated in season 5. He eventually moves in with her but is unable to pay rent in season 6. This eventually leads to a fight when Brian reveals he did not want to move in with her. He later tries to win her back but discovers she is now dating Adam West, leaving him heartbroken.

Brian&#x27;s most significant relationship was with Jess Schlotz, a woman diagnosed with terminal cancer who Brian meets in a bar in &quot;Married...With Cancer&quot;. As Jess had only a little time left to live, Brian agrees to help her with her bucket list and the two fall in love. The couple eventually get married as Jess&#x27;s time grows shorter, a decision Brian later regrets when Jess&#x27;s doctor says she will make a full recovery. Brian is deeply depressed following the marriage, becoming overweight and emotionally distant to the point where Jess brings him to the pound to be put down. The two remain married until Jess&#x27; death, which occurs during a commercial break.

===Writing career===
Brian is an aspiring but struggling writer—this is said to be a reference to Snoopy from &quot;Peanuts&quot;, and reflective of a younger MacFarlane. Brian is unemployed, but he is often seen writing various novels, screenplays, or essays. His difficult writing career and apparent lack of talent is used as a recurring joke throughout the series. In the episode &quot;Play it Again, Brian&quot;, Brian wins an award for an essay he wrote, though he later admits that he plagiarized the piece.

In the episode &quot;Movin&#x27; Out (Brian&#x27;s Song)&quot;, Brian starts writing his book &quot;Faster Than the Speed of Love&quot;, which is revealed to be a rip-off of the &quot;Iron Eagle&quot; films, specifically &quot;&quot;.

In the episode &quot;420&quot;, Brian finally publishes &quot;Faster Than the Speed of Love&quot;, and the novel is shipped, but it is critically panned and does not sell a single copy. In the episode &quot;Dog Gone&quot;, he receives an invitation from the Rhode Island Society for Special Literary Excellence to an award ceremony celebrating his novel. Brian, convinced that he is a great writer, attempts to gain the family&#x27;s interest in this piece of news but fails to do so. Once he arrives at the &quot;award ceremony&quot;, however, he discovers that he has misunderstood the meaning of the word &quot;special&quot;.

In the episode &quot;Brian Griffin&#x27;s House of Payne&quot;, he writes a television script entitled &quot;What I Learned on Jefferson Street&quot;, and it is shown to CBS who picks it up after reading it. Although the script is good, the finished product is not, as James Woods intervenes and turns Brian&#x27;s script into a farcical comedy piece revolving around Woods going back to college, where he is roommates with a monkey named Mr. Nubbins. In the episode &quot;Brian Writes a Bestseller&quot;, Brian writes a bestselling self-help book, &quot;Wish It, Want It, Do It&quot;, which he writes in a few hours and consists mostly of blank pages. The book is an immediate success, but Brian lets the fame go to his head. He eventually causes the downfall of his book&#x27;s popularity, and things go back to normal. Brian mentions it again in &quot;Yug Ylimaf&quot; in order to get a girl.

Brian&#x27;s latest literary attempt came in the episode &quot;Brian&#x27;s Play&quot;, where he writes a play titled &quot;A Passing Fancy&quot;. The play becomes very popular in Quahog; however, Brian is upset when he realizes that Stewie writes a play that is better than his. Stewie&#x27;s play is eventually shown on Broadway. Brian becomes depressed, as he wants to be a good writer for the few remaining years he has, and doesn&#x27;t want to be overshadowed by Stewie, who has his whole life ahead of him.

==Character==
===Creation===

&quot;Family Guy&quot; creator Seth MacFarlane created a cartoon short entitled &quot;Life of Larry&quot;. The short centered around a middle-aged man named Larry and his anthropomorphic dog Steve. In 1997, when MacFarlane was working for Hanna-Barbera Studios, writing for shows such as &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot;, &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, and &quot;Cow and Chicken&quot;, he made a sequel to &quot;Life of Larry&quot;. The short caught the eye of 20th Century Fox representatives, who asked him to create a TV series revolving around the characters. MacFarlane received a US$50,000 budget to develop a pilot for the show, which was, as MacFarlane stated in a 2006 interview, &quot; about one twentieth of what most pilots cost&quot;. MacFarlane claims to have drawn inspiration from several sitcoms, namely &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;All in the Family&quot;. Several premises were also carried over from several 1980s Saturday-morning cartoons he watched as a child, namely &quot;The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang&quot;, and &quot;Rubik, the Amazing Cube&quot;.

In three months, MacFarlane created the Griffin family and developed a pilot for the show he called &quot;Family Guy&quot;. Brian&#x27;s character was largely based on Steve, and Larry would be the main inspiration for the Peter character.

===Voice===
The voice of Brian is provided by series creator Seth MacFarlane, who also provides the voices of many other characters including Peter Griffin, Stewie Griffin, and Glenn Quagmire. Brian&#x27;s voice is MacFarlane&#x27;s normal speaking voice. William H. Macy auditioned unsuccessfully for the role.

In the episode &quot;Road to the Multiverse&quot;, Brian was voiced by Japanese actor Kotaro Watanabe in a scene in an alternate universe where everything is Japanese (due to an American defeat in the Second World War).

==Reception==
Ahsan Haque of IGN has given Brian a positive review, calling him the best talking man-dog. He also praised Brian&#x27;s adventures with Stewie calling them, &quot;center of many of the show&#x27;s best bits&quot;. Haque later made a list titled &quot;Family Guy: Stewie and Brian&#x27;s Greatest Adventures&quot;, where he stated that &quot;Brian and Stewie paired together has always been a winning formula for Family Guy&quot;. They also praised the selection of Brian to play Chewbacca as they stated in the &quot;Blue Harvest&quot; review. In their list of &quot;What Else Should Family Guy Make Fun Of?&quot;, IGN commented that Brian would be perfect to play Q, if &quot;Family Guy&quot; ever decides to make a James Bond parody. In a review of the seventh season, Haque wrote that Brian &quot;unfortunately was terribly misused this season. He&#x27;s degenerated into nothing more than a soapbox for the political views of the writers&quot;. In a review of the eighth season, following his transition into a heel character, Ramsey Isler stated that Brian &quot;left his lofty position as the voice of reason and switched to pretentious loser&quot;.

Emily VanDerWerff of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; praised the Brian character, and stated that &quot;Brian has always been the show&#x27;s best character and its most developed one&quot;. In a 2004 interview, Seth MacFarlane noted his similarities to Brian. He also revealed that Brian is his favorite character, because he feels most comfortable when playing that role.

===Commendations===
In IGN&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Family Guy&quot;: Top 10 Fights&quot;, Brian&#x27;s fight with Stewie in the episode &quot;Patriot Games (season 4, 2006) is ranked number 5. In IGN&#x27;s &quot;Top 10 musical moments in &quot;Family Guy&quot;&quot;, Brian ranked number 6, number 5, and number 3 with the songs, &quot;The Freakin&#x27; FCC&quot; from &quot;PTV&quot; (season 4, 2005), &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot; from &quot;Meet the Quagmires&quot; (season 5, 2007) and &quot;This House Is Freakin&#x27; Sweet&quot; from &quot;Peter, Peter, Caviar Eater&quot; (season 2, 1999), respectively. In a list of the Top 25 &quot;Family Guy&quot; characters compiled by IGN, Brian was placed second on the list (behind Stewie). They stated that &quot;man&#x27;s best friend is a poor understatement&quot; with regards to Brian.

===Death and resurrection===
Brian&#x27;s death was the main focus in the season twelve episode &quot;Life of Brian&quot;. After Stewie destroys his time machine because of the risks of changing history and losing their lives, Brian and Stewie arrive home with a street hockey net they had found in a dump, where Stewie destroyed his time machine for good. As he is setting it up, Brian is struck by a reckless driver in a hit and run and later succumbs to his injuries at the veterinary clinic. Stewie is unable to rebuild the time machine as he cannot acquire a new power supply. After a month of mourning the loss of their beloved pet, the family replaces Brian with a new dog, named Vinny.
The death of Brian in the episode &quot;Life of Brian&quot; was met with massive opposition and anger from &quot;Family Guy&quot; fans around the world, many of whom threatened to boycott the show due to Brian&#x27;s absence. &quot;Family Guy&quot; official Facebook and Twitter pages were bombarded with messages and comments from fans demanding that they bring Brian back. Hostile messages were also directed towards &quot;Family Guy&quot; producing staff, including the show&#x27;s creator, Seth MacFarlane. MacFarlane later thanked fans &quot;for caring so much about the canine Griffin, he is overcome with gratitude.&quot; Fan petitions sprang up within hours of &quot;Life of Brian&quot;&#x27;s first airing, also receiving media attention including most prominently a Change.org petition directed towards Seth MacFarlane, making the petition one of the fastest-growing entertainment-related petitions on the site, attracting over 120,000 signatures.

Two episodes later in &quot;Christmas Guy&quot;, Stewie still misses Brian dearly and spots a past incarnation of himself who has traveled forward in time to Christmas (an event referenced in &quot;Life of Brian&quot;). Stealing the time machine&#x27;s return pad from his past self while Vinny provides a distraction, Stewie goes back in time and saves Brian&#x27;s life, at the cost of erasing himself from history. Brian is extremely grateful for being saved, but Stewie of this timeline finds Brian&#x27;s affections unnerving, not knowing the reason behind them. The episode ends with the family sitting around their Christmas tree with everything back to normal. After &quot;Christmas Guy&quot; aired, Seth MacFarlane tweeted, &quot;you didn&#x27;t really think we&#x27;d kill off Brian, did you? Jesus, we&#x27;d have to be fucking high.&quot;

==In other media==
Brian is featured in a &quot;Family Guy&quot; parody in the &quot;South Park&quot; episodes &quot;Cartoon Wars Part I&quot; and &quot;Part II&quot;. The scene depicted a conversation between Peter and Brian leading to one of the show&#x27;s trademark cut-away gags; like Peter, Brian was rendered in the distinct animation style of &quot;South Park&quot;. Brian also appeared in one episode of Seth MacFarlane&#x27;s other animated sitcom, &quot;American Dad!&quot; titled &quot;The People vs. Martin Sugar&quot;. When Stan Smith begins to mention his list of &quot;Top 10 Fictitious Dogs&quot;, with the last one being Brian, he briefly appears confused asking Stan, &quot;Uh, do I know you?&quot;, which is an homage to MacFarlane himself since he voices both characters. Brian and the rest of the family appear in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode, &quot;Homerland&quot; as guests in the season 25 premiere.

Brian was also featured, along with Stewie, in advertisements for Wheat Thins and Cool Whip. He and Stewie also introduced the 2007 Emmy Awards with a song which recapped the events in television, over the past year. The song was adapted from the one sung by Brian, Stewie and Peter in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;PTV&quot;.

===Merchandise===
Brian is featured on the &quot;Family Guy: Live in Vegas&quot; CD, and also plays a significant part in &quot;Family Guy Video Game!&quot;, the first &quot;Family Guy&quot; video game, which was released by Sierra Entertainment in 2006. He (along with Stewie) features at the center of &quot;Family Guy&quot; second video game, &quot;Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse&quot;.

MacFarlane recorded exclusive material of Brian&#x27;s voice and other &quot;Family Guy&quot; characters for a 2007 pinball machine of the show by Stern Pinball. In 2004, the first series of &quot;Family Guy&quot; toy figurines was released by Mezco Toyz, each member of the Griffin family had their own toy, with the exception of Stewie, of whom two different figures were made. Over the course of two years, four more series of toy figures have been released.

As of 2009, six books have been released about a &quot;Family Guy&quot; universe, all published by HarperCollins since 2005. This include &quot;Family Guy: It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One&quot; (), which covers the entire events of the episode &quot;It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One&quot;, and &quot;Family Guy and Philosophy: A Cure for the Petarded&quot; (), a collection of seventeen essays exploring the connections between the series and historical philosophers. which include Brian as a character.
A book written from Brian&#x27;s point of view (actually written by Andrew Goldberg) was published in 2006. It was called &quot;Brian Griffin&#x27;s Guide to Booze, Broads and the Lost Art of Being a Man&quot;.

<text>The American Jewish Committee (AJC) is a civil rights group and Jewish advocacy group established on November 11, 1906. It is one of the oldest Jewish advocacy organizations and, according to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, is &quot;widely regarded as the of American Jewish organizations&quot;.

Besides working in favor of civil liberties for Jews, the organization has a history of fighting against forms of discrimination in the United States and working on behalf of social equality, such as filing an amicus brief in the May 1954 case of &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; and participating in other events in the Civil Rights Movement.

==Organization==
The American Jewish Committee (AJC) is an international advocacy organization whose key area of focus is to promote religious and civil rights for Jews and others.

AJC has 25 regional offices in the United States, 13 overseas offices, and 35 international partnerships with Jewish communal institutions around the world.

===Programs and institutes===

==History==
=== 1900–1929 ===
On November 11, 1906, 81 Jewish Americans of Central European background met in the Hotel Savoy in New York City to establish the American Jewish Committee. The immediate impetus for the group&#x27;s formation was to speak on behalf of American Jewry to the U.S. government about pressuring Tsarist Russia to stop pogroms against Jews in the Russian Empire. More broadly, AJC sought to protect the rights of Jews all over the world and to combat anti-Jewish discrimination and antisemitism.

In its early years, the AJC worked quietly and behind the scenes, utilizing the contacts of its well-connected and self-constituted Jewish elite, who were mostly Reform Jews. The organization&#x27;s early intent was simply to eliminate the barriers to full Jewish participation in American life and secure, as far as possible, Jewish equality in other countries. Early leaders included lawyer Louis Marshall, banker Jacob H. Schiff, Judge Mayer Sulzberger, scholar Cyrus Adler, and other well-to-do and politically connected Jews.

Marshall was AJC&#x27;s president from 1912 until his death in 1929. While president, Marshall is credited with making the AJC a leading voice in the 1920s against immigration restrictions. Additionally, he succeeded in forcing Henry Ford to cease publication and distribution of his antisemitic newspaper &quot;The Dearborn Independent&quot;. Ford was also made to apologize publicly and pay a cash settlement.

In 1914, the AJC helped create the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, established to aid Jewish victims of World War I. After the war, Marshall went to Europe and used his influence to have provisions guaranteeing the rights of minorities inserted into the peace treaties.

In the 1920s, AJC fought virulent antisemitism and pogroms in Roumania, Russian Jewish refugees in Turkey, and Jews in Yemen. It also filed complaints with the Council of the League of Nations after Norway passed a law banning &quot;schechita&quot;, Jewish ritual slaughter. After the 1929 Palestine riots, AJC asked the U.S. government to ensure the British government protected the Jews in Mandatory Palestine.

In the late 1920s, AJC advocated for reform of the Immigration Act of 1924, including repeal of the National Origins Formula that effectively made immigration from Eastern Europe, where the vast majority of the Jewish diaspora lived at the time, impossible.

After Marshall&#x27;s death, Cyrus Adler was unanimously elected AJC&#x27;s president at the organization&#x27;s annual meeting in November 1929.

===1930s and 1940s ===
The AJC advocated finding places of refuge for Jewish refugees from Adolf Hitler in the 1930s, but had minimal success. After World War II broke out in 1939, the AJC stressed that the war was for democracy and discouraged emphasis on Hitler&#x27;s anti-Jewish policies lest a backlash identify it as a &quot;Jewish war&quot; and increase antisemitism in the United States. When the war ended in 1945, it urged a human rights program upon the United Nations and proved vital in enlisting the support that made possible the human rights provisions in the UN Charter.

The group faced a crisis in the 1940s when president Joseph Proskauer opposed Zionism, and AJC left the umbrella group American Jewish Conference due to its opposition.

The AJC &quot;worked to contain nativist sentiment in America rather than work to open America&#x27;s doors to refugees&quot; during the Holocaust. For fear of provoking an increase in antisemitic sentiment, the AJC opposed public activism. They have been widely criticized for their inaction during the Holocaust; historian and AJC National Director of Jewish Communal Affairs Steven Bayme said AJC leaders &quot;never understood the uniqueness of Nazism and its &#x27;war against the Jews&#x27;.&quot; This cautious approach changed after the war, when the AJC began openly lobbying for a new immigration law allowing entrance to the United States for displaced persons from Europe. This law also led to Nazi collaborators entering the United States, though it remains unclear whether a more restrictive policy would have avoided this outcome.

===Post World War II===
After World War II, AJC changed its stance on the State of Israel. In 1950, AJC President Jacob Blaustein reached an agreement with Israeli prime minister David Ben-Gurion stating that the political allegiance of American Jews was solely to their country of residence. By the Six-Day War of 1967, the AJC had become a passionate defender of the Jewish state, shedding old inhibitions to espouse the centrality of Jewish peoplehood.

The organization worked successfully to include a human rights provision in the UN Charter.

===Anti-Communism===
The Rosenberg Case severely alarmed the AJC and other Jewish organizations, and the AJC supported the Rosenbergs&#x27; execution. Writing from Sing Sing, Julius Rosenberg charged that &quot;self-appointed leaders of Jewish organizations&quot; were behaving like an &quot;American Judenrat&quot;, accusing the AJC&#x27;s Solomon Andhil Fineberg of spreading a false rumor that the Rosenbergs believed they were being prosecuted because they were Jewish.

During the Second Red Scare, the AJC sent a representative to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee, emphasizing that &quot;Judaism and Communism are utterly incompatible.&quot; The AJC shared files with HUAC and also employed a staff member to investigate alleged Communist infiltration among the Jewish community. At the organization&#x27;s conference in October 1950, the executive committee adopted a resolution stating that the protection and advancement of civil liberties and civil rights could not be accomplished with combatting communism in the United States. AJC chairman Irving M. Engel said that &quot;loyalty to the fundamental basis of Judaism requires all Jews to stand with the vanguard in the struggle against totalitarianism. Our attitude as Americans...should be positive and vigorous against communism. Let all of us lead the attack against this common foe of America.&quot;

===Civil Rights Movement===
As part of broader Jewish involvement in the Civil Rights Movement, AJC took the position that the rights of Jews in the United States could be best protected by pursuing equality of all Americans. AJC commissioned the social science research of black psychologist Kenneth Clark, which demonstrated how segregation affected black children. AJC cited Clark&#x27;s research in its amicus curiae brief in support of Oliver Brown during the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education. The court cited Clark&#x27;s research in its decision establishing racial segregation in public schools were unconstitutional.

AJC, along with the ADL and American Jewish Congress, believed that racial quotas were unconstitutional, and Jewish groups opposed their use in determining admission in higher education in the United States. For this reason, AJC celebrated the landmark 1978 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke that struck down racial quotas in university admissions. Despite the Bakke decision, AJC supported affirmative action programs for disadvantaged groups. By 2003, the organization&#x27;s opposition to affirmative action had tempered. The AJC&#x27;s director of public policy Jeffrey Sinesky said that &quot;It&#x27;s the quota concept that&#x27;s anathema&quot; after the organization submitted a brief in defense of the University of Michigan&#x27;s affirmative action program.

According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, the AJC had taken a leading role in the struggle for equal rights for African Americans in the United States by the early 1990s.

=== 1960s and 1970s ===
Through direct dialogue with the Catholic Church, the AJC played a leading role in improving Jewish-Christian relations, leading the Vatican to issue the &quot;Nostra aetate&quot; in 1965, absolving Jews of collective responsibility for the death of Jesus. The American Jewish Committee, along with the Synagogue Council of America, and the American Ethical Union each submitted briefs in Engel v. Vitale urging the US Supreme Court to rule that the public school prayer was unconstitutional.

Before the Six-Day War in 1967, the AJC was officially &quot;non-Zionist&quot;. It had long been ambivalent about Zionism as possibly opening up Jews to the charge of dual loyalty, but it supported the creation of Israel in 1947–48, after the United States backed the partition of Palestine. It was the first American Jewish organization to open a permanent office in Israel.

In the 1970s, the AJC spearheaded the fight to pass anti-boycott legislation to counter the Arab League boycott of Israel. In particular, Japan&#x27;s defection from the boycott was attributed to AJC persuasion. In 1975, the AJC became the first Jewish organization to campaign against the UN&#x27;s &quot;Zionism is Racism&quot; Resolution 3379, when briefly integrated to President&#x27;s Conference in order to join the touristic boycott against Mexico, after the World Conference on Women, 1975, the event in which Arab countries, the Soviet bloc, and Non-Aligned Movement countries impulsed the initial discussion that resulted in Resolution 3379. Along with other American Jewish organizations, the AJC announced the suspension of all their trips to Mexico as an expression of &quot;the wish of some Jews and Jewish organizations to boycott Mexico&quot;. They did this is spite of their anti-boycott tradition. Finally, the campaign against Resolution 3379 succeeded in 1991, as it was revoked through Resolution 4686. AJC played a leading role in breaking Israel&#x27;s diplomatic isolation at the UN by helping it gain acceptance in WEOG (West Europe and Others), one of the UN&#x27;s five regional groups.

The AJC was active in the campaign to gain emigration rights for Jews living in the Soviet Union; in 1964 it was one of the founders of the American Jewish Conference on Soviet Jewry, which in 1971 was superseded by the National Conference on Soviet Jewry.

=== 1980s and 1990s ===
Founded in 1982, Project Interchange runs seminars in Israel for influential Americans.

In December 1987, the AJC&#x27;s Washington representative, David Harris, organized the Freedom Sunday Rally on behalf of Soviet Jewry. Approximately 250,000 people attended the D.C. rally, which demanded that the Soviet government allow Jewish emigration from the USSR. In 1990, David Harris become executive director. Under his leadership, the AJC became increasingly involved in international affairs. Regular meetings with foreign diplomats both in the United States and in their home countries were supplemented each September by what came to be called a &quot;diplomatic marathon,&quot; a series of meetings with high-level representatives of foreign countries who were in New York for the UN General Assembly session. The AJC annual meeting was also moved from New York to Washington, D.C., so that more government officials and foreign diplomats might participate.

In 1990, the AJC conducted a major restructuring, laying off 40 of its 275 staff and cutting $1 million from its $16 million annual budget, in order to focus its work on intergroup relations. The organization ended its activities in Western Europe and South America and merged into international relations offices in New York and Washington. According to Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg, the AJC had been challenged by more aggressive groups. The ADL and Simon Wiesenthal Center had taken a more strident position on the antisemitism issue, while the American Jewish Congress had attracted liberals with its willingness to criticize the policies of Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Shamir.

In 1998, the AJC established a full-time presence in Germany—the first American Jewish organization to do so—opening an office in Berlin.

In 1999, the AJC ran an ad campaign in support of the NATO&#x27;s intervention in Kosovo.

=== 2000s ===
In 2000, the AJC helped establish the Atlanta Jewish Film Festival in Atlanta, Georgia, the largest Jewish film festival in the world.

In 2001, the AJC became official partners with the Geneva-based UN Watch.

In 2005, as part of its continuing efforts to respond to humanitarian crises, the organization contributed US$2.5 million to relief funds and reconstruction projects for the victims of the South Asian tsunami and Hurricane Katrina in the US.

By its 100th anniversary in 2006, AJC had 33 chapters in the United States and a presence in 20 countries. Organization leaders marked the occasion with a multi-country tour across Europe and the Middle East. Nearly 2,000 people gathered in Washington, D.C., to celebrate its 100th Annual Meeting that May, and President George W. Bush, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, and German chancellor Angela Merkel attended a reception in its honor. These individuals gave credit to the American Jewish Committee for protecting Jewish Security and human rights around the world.

AJC became increasingly involved in the advocacy of energy independence for the U.S. on the grounds that this would reduce dependence on foreign, especially Arab, oil; boost the American economy; and improve the environment. AJC urged Congress and several presidential administrations to take action toward this goal, and called upon the private sector to be more energy-conscious. It adopted &quot;Green&quot; policies for itself institutionally, and in 2011 earned LEED certification, denoting that its New York headquarters was energy efficient and environmentally sound.

As part of a new strategic plan adopted in 2009, the AJC said it envisioned itself as the &quot;Global Center for Jewish and Israel Advocacy&quot; and the &quot;Central &#x27;Jewish Address&#x27; for Intergroup Relations and Human Rights.&quot; Its new tagline was &quot;Global Jewish Advocacy.&quot;

===2010s ===
AJC diplomatic efforts since 2010 include opposition to Iran&#x27;s program to attain nuclear capability; a campaign to get the European Union to designate Hezbollah a terrorist organization; preserving the right of Jews to practice circumcision in Germany; and urging the government of Greece to take action against the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party.

In October 2011, the AJC issued a joint statement with the Anti-Defamation League urging American Jews to support a Joint Unity Pledge stating: &quot;America&#x27;s friendship with Israel is an emotional, moral and strategic bond that has always transcended politics.&quot; It urged that &quot;now is the time to reaffirm that Israel&#x27;s well-being is best served, as it always has been, by American voices raised together in unshakeable support for our friend and ally.&quot;

The statement aroused a storm of protest from Jewish opponents of President Obama&#x27;s re-election, who perceived it as a call to avoid criticizing the president&#x27;s policies toward Israel. In the pages of the &quot;Wall Street Journal,&quot; former Under Secretary of Defense Douglas Feith asked: &quot;Since when have American supporters of Israel believed that a candidate&#x27;s attitudes toward Israel should be kept out of electoral politics? Since never.&quot; David Harris responded that the statement was intended to preserve the tradition of bipartisan support for Israel and prevent it from becoming &quot;a dangerous political football.&quot; While Harris recognized the right of anyone in the Jewish community to take a partisan position, he stressed the need for &quot;strong advocacy in both parties&quot; at a time of looming international difficulties for the Jewish state.

Along with other agencies such as the Simon Wiesenthal Center and the Union for Reform Judaism, the AJC condemned a move in mid-2014 by the U.S. Presbyterian Church to divest from companies that do business with Israel settlements. An AJC statement asserted that the divestment is just one incident of the U.S. church group &quot;demonizing Israel&quot;, referring to &quot;one-sided reports and study guides, such as &#x27;Zionism Unsettled&#x27;&quot; as proof of anti-Zionist sentiments. In 2016, the AJC and Islamic Society of North America formed the Muslim-Jewish Advisory Council to address rising bigotry against Jews and Muslims in the United States.

On 22 February 2019, the AJC condemned the Otzma Yehudit party, calling its views &quot;reprehensible.&quot; The AJC statement said Otzma Yehudit&#x27;s views &quot;do not reflect the core values that are the very foundation of the State of Israel.&quot; The AJC statement came after the Bayit Yehudi party merged with Otzma Yehudit and the new joint slate appeared likely to win enough votes to earn seats in the next Knesset as well as ministerial roles for some of its members. No members of Otzma Yehudit were elected.

=== 2020s ===
In January 2020, the AJC and the Muslim World League, a Mecca-based non-governmental organization, led a historic joint delegation of Muslims and Jews to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, the Nazi German death and concentration camp. The trip was the most senior Islamic delegation to ever visit Auschwitz. As a part of the visit, David Harris and Dr. Al-Issa, secretary-general of the Muslim World League, published a joint opinion editorial in the Chicago &quot;Tribune&quot; on how Auschwitz united Muslims and Jews.

In June 2021, AJC opened an office in Abu Dhabi, its first office in an Arab country and its 13th office outside the United States to build on the Abraham Accords. The office&#x27;s inaugural leader was Marc Sievers, former U.S. ambassador to Oman.

In early 2022, the AJC released its fourth annual &quot;State of Antisemitism in America&quot; report and later that year the organization announced its &quot;Call to Action on Antisemitism&quot; playbook. After a string of high-profile antisemitic incidents, including comments made by Kanye West, the organization participated in a White House round-table on antisemitism with Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff.

After more than years as CEO, David Harris retired in 2022 and was replaced by South Florida congressman Ted Deutch.

On February 10, 2023, CEO Ted Deutch joined Emhoff, UN Undersecretary General Melissa Fleming, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, and Ambassador Deborah Lipstadt on a panel about antisemitism.

==Influence and reputation==
AJC is the oldest Jewish defense and community relations organization in the United States, and is widely regarded as the dean of American Jewish organizations. According to historian Jonathan Sarna, AJC is known for its deep research of issues and working behind the scenes with high-level international contacts.

==Publications==
===Library===
In 1930, the AJC founded a library at its Manhattan headquarters as a resource for its staff to research and write reports. According to historian Jonathan Sarna, the AJC&#x27;s library was for the Jewish community what the Library of Congress was for the U.S. Congress At its peak, the library held 13,000 titles such as internal memos and reports on Jewish organizations, publications on race, religion, civil rights, and the Holocaust. In September 2012, the AJC shut down the library, with holdings going to Yeshiva University, Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, the Jewish Theological Seminary, Berman Jewish Policy Archive, and the Seminario Rabínico Latinoamericano.

===Magazines===
The AJC published liberal magazine &quot;Present Tense&quot; from 1973 until 1990, when AJC ceased publication as part of an organizational reorganization. Murray Polner was the magazine&#x27;s first and only editor. &quot;Present Tense&quot; often published articles critical of Israel and the American Jewish establishment. The organization also published conservative journal &quot;Commentary&quot;.

===New antisemitism===

A 2007 essay, &quot;&quot;Progressive&quot; Jewish Thought and the New Anti-Semitism&quot; by Professor Alvin H. Rosenfeld, published on the AJC website, criticized Jewish critics of Israel by name, particularly the editors and contributors to &quot;Wrestling With Zion: Progressive Jewish-American Responses to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict&quot; (Grove Press), a 2003 collection of essays edited by Tony Kushner and Alisa Solomon. The essay accused these writers of participating in an &quot;onslaught against Zionism and the Jewish State,&quot; which he considered a veiled form of supporting a rise in antisemitism.

In an editorial, the Jewish newspaper &quot;The Forward&quot; called Rosenfeld&#x27;s essay &quot;a shocking tissue of slander&quot; whose intent was to &quot;turn Jews against liberalism and silence critics.&quot; Richard Cohen remarked that the essay &quot;has given license to the most intolerant and narrow-minded of Israel&#x27;s defenders so that, as the AJC concedes in my case, any veering from orthodoxy is met with censure ... the most powerful of all post-Holocaust condemnations—anti-Semite—is diluted beyond recognition.&quot;

The essay was also criticized by Rabbi Michael Lerner and in op-eds in the &quot;Guardian&quot; and the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;.

In a &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot; op-ed, AJC Executive Director David Harris explained why the organization published Rosenfeld&#x27;s essay in 2007:

:Rosenfeld has courageously taken on the threat that arises when a Jewish imprimatur is given to the campaign to challenge Israel&#x27;s very legitimacy. He has the right to express his views no less than those whom he challenges. It is important to stress that he has not suggested that those about whom he writes are anti-Semitic, though that straw-man argument is being invoked by some as a diversionary tactic. As befits a highly regarded and prolific scholar, he has written a well-documented and thought-provoking essay that deserves to be considered on its merits.

<doc id="913788" wikidata="Q4026" url="?curid=913788" title="Ramesses X">
<text>Khepermaatre Ramesses X (also written Ramses and Rameses) (ruled ) was the ninth pharaoh of the 20th Dynasty of Ancient Egypt. His birth name was Amonhirkhepeshef. His prenomen or throne name, Khepermaatre, means &quot;The Justice of Re Abides.&quot;

==Reign==
His accession day fell on 1 &quot;prt&quot; 27 (first month of the Winter season, day 27). His highest attested regnal year is year 3; the highest attested date in his reign is either &quot;year 3, second month of the Inundation season, day 2&quot; or possibly &quot;year 3, month 4 (no day given)&quot;. However, a later 20th Dynasty papyrus fragment from Deir el-Medina published in 2023 by Egyptologist Robert Demarée refers to a partial date of Year 4, third month of Inundation [or Akhet] together with a change to Year 1, month 4 of Inundation. Although both kings are unnamed, it is strongly suggested by Demarée to refer to the reigns of Ramesses X and his successor Ramesses XI. If confirmed, this would mean that Ramesses X ruled for 3 years and 10 months or nearly 4 years before he died.
The only other 20th Dynasty king who died in his regnal Year 4 was Ramesses V but this ruler died around the time interval between the first and second month of Peret So, the papyrus document above cannot refer to Ramesses V.

The older theory put forward on astronomical grounds by Richard Parker that Ramesses X may have reigned for 9 years, has since been abandoned.
Likewise, the suggested ascription of Theban graffito 1860a to a hypothetical year 8 of Ramesses X is no longer supported.

==Family==
The English Egyptologists Aidan Dodson and Dylan Hilton wrote in a 2004 book:
No evidence is known to indicate the relationship between the final kings Ramesses IX, X and XI. If they were a father-son succession, Tyti, who bears the titles of King&#x27;s Daughter, King&#x27;s Wife and King&#x27;s Mother, would seem [to be] a good candidate for the wife of Ramesses X, but little else can be discerned.

However, Dodson&#x27;s hypothesis here on Tyti&#x27;s position must now be discarded since it has been proven in 2010 that Tyti was rather a queen of a previous 20th dynasty pharaoh instead. She is mentioned in the partly fragmented Harris papyrus to be Ramesses III&#x27;s wife as Dodson himself acknowledges.

==Attestations==
Ramesses X is a poorly documented king. His year 2 is attested by &quot;Papyrus Turin 1932+1939&quot; while his third year is documented in the Necropolis Journal of the Workmen of Deir El Medina. This diary mentions the general idleness of the necropolis workmen, at least partly due to the threat posed by Libyan marauders in the Valley of the Kings. It records that the Deir El-Medina workmen were absent from work in Year 3 IIIrd Month of Peret (i.e., Winter) days 6, 9, 11, 12, 18, 21 and 24 for fear of the &quot;desert-dwellers&quot; (i.e., the Libyans or Meshwesh) who evidently roamed through Upper Egypt and Thebes at will. This is partly a reflection of the massive Libyan influx into the Western Delta region of Lower Egypt during this time. Ramesses X is also the last New Kingdom king whose rule over Nubia is attested from an inscription at Aniba.

==Tomb==
His KV18 tomb in the Valley of the Kings was left unfinished. It is uncertain if he was ever buried there, since no remains or fragments of funerary objects were discovered within it.

<doc id="913791" wikidata="Q142358" url="?curid=913791" title="Great Britain at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Great Britain, the team of the British Olympic Association (BOA), competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004 with the team of selected athletes was officially known as Team GB. The British sent a wide-ranging delegation to the Games, continuing its ubiquitous presence at the Olympics. Great Britain&#x27;s 264 athletes, 161 men and 103 women, competed in 22 disciplines throughout the two-week event. The team entered the opening ceremony behind the Union Flag carried by judoka Kate Howey. Double gold medal winner Kelly Holmes carried the flag at the closing ceremony.

These games continued the success that Great Britain made at Sydney although they won just nine gold medals compared with the eleven won at Sydney overall the team did increase their overall medal haul to thirty medals and for the second summer games in a row finished in tenth place on the medal table. 

==Chronology==
The delegation started the Olympics slowly, the silver its divers won on 14 August being the first of only a few opening-week medals. Although a sprinkling of silver and bronze medals – including a pair in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s k1 kayak slalom – enlivened the mid-week, Britain&#x27;s first gold did not come until Friday the 20th (won by Chris Hoy in the 1 km track cycling time-trial).

Then, on 21 August (&quot;Golden Saturday&quot;) Britain&#x27;s contributions to the medal table became more significant. First Britain&#x27;s traditional strength in rowing continued as the men&#x27;s coxless four, stroked by Matthew Pinsent, narrowly won gold, a defining moment since this was Pinsent&#x27;s fourth gold medal in as many games. Sailor Ben Ainslie wrapped up a successful few days of racing with a gold, as did the women&#x27;s Yngling sailboats who were finally awarded the gold medal they had sewn up on Thursday. Bradley Wiggins continued Britain&#x27;s cycling success, winning gold in the 4 km pursuit. Young swimmer David Davies, coming third in the men&#x27;s 1500 m freestyle, set a European record in the process and won Britain&#x27;s second swimming medal of the games – a notable improvement over the 2000 Sydney games from which the swimmers had returned empty-handed. Also on Saturday, it was announced that, after an appeal, Leslie Law would be promoted from silver to gold in the three-day equestrian eventing (and his team from bronze to silver). As the games&#x27; aquatic-dominated first week shifted into a second week focused more on track and field events, Kelly Sotherton came third in the heptathlon.

Sunday 22 August brought another rowing medal. However, marathon favourite Paula Radcliffe failed to cope with the heat of Athens and did not finish. The timing of the race with a late afternoon start, supposedly to appease US broadcasters, produced some controversy since summer marathons normally start early in the morning to avoid the heat.

23 August saw Britain&#x27;s first gold medal of the track and field events, Kelly Holmes winning the women&#x27;s 800 metres. This was Britain&#x27;s first gold medal on the track since Sally Gunnell won the 400-metre hurdles at the 1992 Barcelona games.

By claiming bronze in the Madison cycling on 25 August, to add to his earlier individual gold and a silver from the team pursuit, Bradley Wiggins became the first Briton for 40 years to claim three medals in one games.

The evening of Saturday 28 August saw Britain&#x27;s medal hunt centred on the Olympic Stadium. Steve Backley, in his final javelin throw competition, failed to win the gold he had been seeking since 1992, finishing fourth. Kelly Holmes achieved the middle-distance double, taking gold in the 1500 metres. The men&#x27;s 4×100-metre relay team won a surprising victory, winning gold ahead of the American team. Earlier in the day, Ian Wynne had added to the medal haul, with a bronze medal in the K1 kayak class, competing despite an ankle injury picked up the day before.

The final day of the games, 29 August, saw Amir Khan collect Britain&#x27;s last medal of the event with a silver in boxing&#x27;s lightweight division.

==Overall performance==
In the final medal table, Great Britain finished in 10th place overall. The BBC stated that this was &quot;the best British performance in the modern era&quot;, and quantified this with further considerations: &quot;GB won 37 in 1984, but that was a boycott-hit Games missing the Eastern Bloc countries. Take Los Angeles out of the picture, and this was Britain&#x27;s best haul since 1924.&quot;

==Medallists==

Great Britain finished in tenth position in the final medal rankings, with 9 gold and 30 total medals.

Great Britain sent only one boxer to Athens, the 17-year-old Amir Khan. Khan tore through his first four fights, including two that the referees had to stop prematurely. His loss in the final to the defending Olympic champion and three-time world champion gave Khan a 4–1 record and a silver medal; many hoped he would compete the 2008 Summer Olympics but in the event he decided to turn professional later in 2004.

==Media coverage==
The main rights to Olympic coverage in the UK are held by the BBC, under the Ofcom Code on Sports and Other Listed and Designated Events. 2004 marked the first year that digital television and webcasts were used to cover an Olympic Games. The digital television service allowed up to five streamed channels covering the games, allowing more extensive coverage of minor sports, whilst the BBC&#x27;s website permitted UK broadband users to view live streams from a variety of events, and other countries to view delayed highlights. Live broadcasts were run throughout the day, with a highlights program on BBC1 following the close of the day&#x27;s events.

The BBC&#x27;s coverage was anchored (at various times of the day) by Craig Doyle, Clare Balding, Suzi Perry, Sue Barker, Steve Rider, Hazel Irvine and Steve Cram. Expert analysts and commentators included Sharron Davies, Jonathan Edwards, Sally Gunnell, Michael Johnson, Colin Jackson, and Steve Redgrave.

Eurosport also ran coverage of the Games viewable in the UK – in accordance with the ITC Code, it can show live events, provided that such events can also be broadcast by the BBC (although the BBC can choose not to do so).

Radio coverage was provided by BBC Radio Five Live and IRN, and the events were also covered by the sports pages of the major newspapers.

<doc id="913797" wikidata="Q6253084" url="?curid=913797" title="John Podhoretz">
<text>John Mordecai Podhoretz (; born April 18, 1961) is an American writer. He is the editor of &quot;Commentary&quot; magazine, a columnist for the &quot;New York Post&quot;, the author of several books on politics, and a former speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan and worked in the administration of George H. W. Bush.

==Early life and education==
Podhoretz was born in a Jewish family in New York City, to conservative journalists Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. He has two older half-siblings from his mother&#x27;s first marriage. He grew up on the Upper West Side in New York City. He attended Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School and he received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Chicago in 1982. In 1987, he became a five-time champion on the game show &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;

== Career ==
Podhoretz was a speechwriter for former U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. He was special assistant to White House Drug Czar William Bennett. He co-founded the White House Writers Group, a public-relations firm in Washington, D.C. Podhoretz was a consultant for the popular television series &quot;The West Wing&quot;, including the controversial episode &quot;Gaza&quot; in season five, first broadcast on May 12, 2004.

Podhoretz has contributed to a number of conservative publications, including &quot;National Review&quot; and the &quot;Weekly Standard&quot;, where he was a movie critic and was the magazine&#x27;s deputy editor. He was also a consulting editor at ReganBooks, a former imprint of HarperCollins. Podhoretz has a regular column at the &quot;New York Post&quot;. He has also appeared on television, including Fox News, CNN&#x27;s &quot;Reliable Sources&quot;, MSNBC, and &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot; (in the chair usually occupied by conservative Tony Blankley). He has also worked at &quot;Time&quot;, the &quot;Washington Times&quot;, &quot;Insight on the News&quot;, and &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. Podhoretz was a contributor to The Corner, a group blog run by &quot;National Review&quot;.

At &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;, one staff member said, Podhoretz&#x27;s &quot;arrogance and egotism had a psychological effect people can&#x27;t quite believe.&quot; At &quot;The Washington Times&quot; a colleague reported, he was &quot;permanently frozen in juvenilia.&quot; Glenn Garvin, the Central American bureau chief of the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;, once said that at the &quot;Times&quot;, Podhoretz &quot;constantly complained that his brilliance wasn&#x27;t appreciated.&quot;

On January 1, 2009, Podhoretz became editor of &quot;Commentary&quot;, succeeding Neal Kozodoy. 

===Political commentary===
====George W. Bush====
Podhoretz was a staunch supporter of President George W. Bush. His 2004 book &quot;Bush Country: How George W. Bush Became the First Great Leader of the 21st Century---While Driving Liberals Insane&quot; called Bush &quot;the first great leader of the 21st century&quot;. When some conservatives denounced Bush&#x27;s immigration plan, Podhoretz wrote that Bush&#x27;s &quot;efforts on behalf of conservative causes—from faith-based policies to stem-cell research to a strict-constructionist judiciary to entitlement reform and massive tax cuts—have all fallen down the memory hole&quot;.

====Israel====
Podhoretz is emphatic in his defense of Israel in its conflicts with its Arab neighbors. When pundit Pat Buchanan called Israel&#x27;s actions in the 2006 Lebanon War &quot;un-Christian&quot;, Podhoretz wrote: &quot;You want to know what anti-Semitism is? When Pat Buchanan calls Israel&#x27;s military action &#x27;un-Christian.&#x27; That&#x27;s anti-Semitism.&quot;

====Iraq War====
Podhoretz has supported the Iraq War from its inception until its conclusion. In a July 25, 2006 column for the &quot;New York Post&quot; that discussed the Israel-Lebanon conflict, Podhoretz advocated a more Machiavellian policy in Iraq, writing: &quot;What if the tactical mistake we made in Iraq was that we didn&#x27;t kill enough Sunnis in the early going to intimidate them and make them so afraid of us they would go along with anything? Wasn&#x27;t the survival of Sunni men between the ages of 15 and 35 the reason there was an insurgency and the basic cause of the sectarian violence now?&quot; In a December 2006 column, he wrote, &quot;The most common cliché about the war in Iraq is now this: We didn&#x27;t have a plan, and now everything is in chaos... This is entirely wrong. We &quot;did&quot; have a plan—the problem is that the plan didn&#x27;t work... We thought a political process inside Iraq would make a military push toward victory against a tripartite foe—Saddamist remnants, foreign terrorists and anti-American Shiites—unnecessary... The only plan that will work is a plan to face the tripartite enemy—the Saddamists, the foreign terrorists and the Shiite sectarians—and bring them to heel. Kill as many bad guys as we can, with as many troops as we can muster.&quot;

====Immigration====
In disagreement with several writers at &quot;National Review&quot; and conservatives in general, Podhoretz has aggressively favored a more open immigration policy for the United States. He wrote: &quot;I said merely what I feel deeply—which is that, as a Jew, I have great difficulty supporting a blanket policy of immigration restriction because of what happened to the Jewish people after 1924 and the unwillingness of the United States to take Jews in.&quot; Podhoretz was generally supportive of President Bush&#x27;s proposals for a guest worker program and a path to citizenship for certain illegal immigrants in the U.S.

In November 2007, comments on &quot;Commentary&#x27;s&quot; blog &quot;Contentions&quot;, Podhoretz attacked his former colleague at &quot;National Review Online&quot;, Mark Krikorian, for what Podhoretz called a &quot;vision of a walled-off America primarily under threat from border-crossing immigrants.&quot; Podhoretz attempted to connect Krikorian&#x27;s stance on immigration to an isolationist foreign policy. In response, Krikorian called Podhoretz a &quot;pedantic bore&quot; who had no &quot;actual arguments&quot; against Krikorian&#x27;s position on immigration.

====Jill Carroll incident====
On March 30, 2006, Podhoretz was criticized by various bloggers for posting the following comment on &quot;National Review Online&quot; approximately three hours after hostage Jill Carroll&#x27;s release from her captors: &quot;It&#x27;s wonderful that she&#x27;s free, but after watching someone who was a hostage for three months say on television she was well-treated because she wasn&#x27;t beaten or killed—while being dressed in the garb of a modest Muslim woman rather than the non-Muslim woman she actually is—I expect there will be some Stockholm syndrome talk in the coming days.&quot;

Within days of Carroll&#x27;s release, a video of Carroll slamming the &quot;occupation&quot; of Iraq and praising the insurgents as &quot;good people fighting an honorable fight&quot; appeared on an Islamist website. However, Carroll subsequently released a statement through &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&#x27;s&quot; website stating that she participated in the video only because she feared for her life and because her captors said they would let her go if she participated to their satisfaction. Carroll called her captors &quot;criminals, at best&quot; and said she remained &quot;deeply angry&quot; with them.

On April 1, 2006, Podhoretz wrote the following on &quot;National Review Online&quot;: &quot;For writing these predictive words, which were entirely accurate, I&#x27;ve been pilloried all over the blogosphere. Weird, especially in light of Jill Carroll&#x27;s statement today, which was an effort to address and quiet precisely the kind of talk I predicted would take place.&quot;

====Conflicts with John Derbyshire====
In response to assertions by &quot;National Review&quot; writer John Derbyshire that the victims of the Virginia Tech massacre should have been more forceful in defending themselves, Podhoretz wrote: &quot;The notion that a human being or group of human beings holding no weapon whatever should somehow &#x27;fight back&#x27; against someone calmly executing other people right in front of their eyes is ludicrous beyond belief, irrational beyond bounds, and tasteless beyond the limits of reason. &#x27;Why didn&#x27;t anyone rush the guy?&#x27; Derb asks. Gee, I don&#x27;t know. Because he was executing people? Because if you rush a guy with a gun, he shoots you in the head the way he executed the teachers in each classroom?&quot; Podhoretz went on to ridicule Derbyshire&#x27;s claim that he was touching a &quot;third rail&quot; by raising a subject nobody else wanted to discuss.

Podhoretz has frequently clashed with Derbyshire on immigration policy and other issues.

====Other commentary====
Podhoretz often writes about popular culture, and was called the &quot;resident pop culture expert&quot; at &quot;National Review Online&quot; by Jonah Goldberg. Dennis Miller has called Podhoretz his &quot;favorite movie reviewer.&quot; Podhoretz has written that &quot;it doesn&#x27;t make sense to judge pop culture by its politics.&quot; In 1999 a column he wrote for &quot;The New York Post&quot;, &quot;A Conversation in Hell&quot;, which featured a conversation between Satan and Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., was killed because of its controversial nature. Jonathan Chait has criticized Podhoretz&#x27;s use of social media, accusing him of &quot;spew[ing] forth abuse upon various adversaries, especially by lobbing spurious charges of antisemitism.&quot;

==Personal life ==
Podhoretz&#x27;s first marriage, to Elisabeth Marie Hickey, in 1997, ended in divorce after less than three months. In 2002, he married Ayala Rae Cohen, a former co-producer for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, who works for International Creative Management (ICM Partners). They have two daughters and a son. Podhoretz&#x27;s sister, Rachel Abrams, was married to the diplomat, lawyer, political scientist, and Iran-Contra convict Elliott Abrams.

<doc id="913805" wikidata="Q2894354" url="?curid=913805" title="Frederick Kagan">
<text>Frederick W. Kagan (born 1970) is an American resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) and a former professor of military history at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.

==Career==

He and his father, Donald Kagan, who was a professor at Yale and a fellow at the Hudson Institute, co-authored &quot;While America Sleeps: Self-Delusion, Military Weakness, and the Threat to Peace Today&quot; (2000). The book argued in favor of a large increase in military spending and warned of future threats, including from a potential revival of Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction program. Frederick and Robert Kagan, who is a member of the Aspen Strategy Group, and their father, Donald, were all signatories to the Project for the New American Century manifesto, &quot;Rebuilding America&#x27;s Defenses&quot; (2000).

== Influence ==
Kagan authored the &quot;real Iraq Study Group&quot; report as the American Enterprise Institute&#x27;s rival to the Iraq Study Group report of James Baker and Lee H. Hamilton in December 2006. The AEI report, &quot;Choosing Victory: A Plan for Success in Iraq&quot;, was released on January 5, 2007, and Kagan was said to have won over the ear of President George W. Bush, strongly influencing his subsequent &quot;surge&quot; plan for changing the course of the Iraq War. Along with retired General Jack Keane, retired Colonel Joel Armstrong, and retired Major Daniel Dwyer, Kagan is credited as one of the &quot;intellectual architects&quot; of the surge plan. According to &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine, Kagan&#x27;s essay &quot;We&#x27;re Not the Soviets in Afghanistan&quot; influenced the strategic thinking of US Defense Secretary Robert Gates, which reportedly influenced Gates&#x27;s decision to support sending 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.

Remarking on the surge in 2015, Kagan said that while the AEI group convened that &quot;it never occurred to me or anybody that was involved in this that we were going to affect policy. It was simply &#x27;Maybe we can put some concrete numbers on the table, some concrete enemy on a map, some concrete units on a grid, and force other people who want to have this discussion to wrestle with the specifics of the problem.&#x27;&quot;

===Advising David Petraeus===
In 2010, U.S. Army General David H. Petraeus, who was appointed by President Barack Obama to head international forces in Afghanistan, hired Kagan as one of two experts on fighting corruption. An article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; on December 19, 2012, discussed the relationship that the Kagans had with General Petraeus and, to a much lesser extent, with his successor in July 2011, General John R. Allen. It discussed various visits made by the Kagans from mid-2010, including their having been given access to the Combined Joint Intelligence Operations Center in Petraeus&#x27;s headquarters. It commented on and raised questions about their sponsorship by defense contractors through the American Enterprise Institute. It also detailed how the Kagans had become involved in Iraq in 2007 under an initiative by General Stanley A. McChrystal, who was their first introduction to Afghanistan in 2010.

==2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine==

Kagan has regularly contributed to daily reports by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) on the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The ISW was founded by his wife, Kimberly Kagan.

<text>Robert Kagan (; born September 26, 1958) is an American columnist. He is a neoconservative scholar. He is a critic of U.S. foreign policy and a leading advocate of liberal internationalism.

A co-founder of the neoconservative Project for the New American Century, he is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Kagan has been a foreign policy adviser to U.S. Republican presidential candidates as well as Democratic administrations via the Foreign Affairs Policy Board. 

He wrote a monthly column on world affairs for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. During the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign, Kagan left the Republican Party due to the party&#x27;s nomination of Donald Trump and endorsed the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, for president.

==Personal life and education==
Kagan was born in Athens, Greece. His father, historian Donald Kagan, was the Sterling Professor of Classics and History Emeritus at Yale University and a specialist in the history of the Peloponnesian War, was of Lithuanian Jewish descent. His brother Frederick is a military historian and author. Kagan has a B.A. in history (1980) from Yale, where in 1979 he was editor-in-chief of the &quot;Yale Political Monthly&quot;, a periodical he is credited with reviving. He later earned a Master of Public Policy from Harvard&#x27;s Kennedy School of Government and a Ph.D. in American history from American University in Washington, D.C.

Kagan is married to American diplomat Victoria Nuland, who previously served as deputy national security advisor to Vice President Dick Cheney and assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs in the Obama administration.

==Career==
In 1983, Kagan was foreign policy advisor to New York Republican Representative Jack Kemp. From 1984 to 1986, under the administration of Ronald Reagan, he was a speechwriter for Secretary of State George P. Shultz and a member of the United States Department of State Policy Planning Staff. From 1986 to 1988, he served in the State Department Bureau of Inter-American Affairs.

In 1997, Kagan co-founded the now-defunct neoconservative think tank Project for the New American Century with William Kristol. Through the work of the PNAC, from 1998, Kagan was an early and strong advocate of military action in Syria, Iran, Afghanistan as well as to &quot;remove Mr. Hussein and his regime from power.&quot; After the 1998 bombing of Iraq was announced Kagan said &quot;bombing Iraq isn&#x27;t enough&quot; and called on Clinton to send ground troops to Iraq.

From 1998 until August 2010, Kagan was a Senior Associate with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He was appointed senior fellow in the Center on United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution in September 2010.

During the 2008 presidential campaign he served as foreign policy advisor to John McCain, the Republican Party&#x27;s nominee for President of the United States in the 2008 election.

Since 2011, Kagan has also served on the 25-member State Department&#x27;s Foreign Affairs Policy Board under Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.

Andrew Bacevich referred to Kagan as &quot;the chief neoconservative foreign-policy theorist&quot; in reviewing Kagan&#x27;s book &quot;The Return of History and the End of Dreams&quot;.

A profile in &quot;The Guardian&quot; described Kagan as being &quot;uncomfortable&quot; with the &#x27;neocon&#x27; title, and stated that &quot;he insists he is &#x27;liberal&#x27; and &#x27;progressive&#x27; in a distinctly American tradition.&quot;

In 2008, Kagan wrote an article titled &quot;Neocon Nation: Neoconservatism, c. 1776&quot; for &quot;World Affairs&quot;, describing the main components of American neoconservatism as a belief in the rectitude of applying US moralism to the world stage, support for the US to act alone, the promotion of American-style liberty and democracy in other countries, the belief in American hegemony, the confidence in US military power, and a distrust of international institutions. According to Kagan, his foreign-policy views are &quot;deeply rooted in American history and widely shared by Americans&quot;.

In 2006, Kagan wrote that Russia and China are the greatest &quot;challenge liberalism faces today&quot;: &quot;Nor do Russia and China welcome the liberal West&#x27;s efforts to promote liberal politics around the globe, least of all in regions of strategic importance to them. ... Unfortunately, al-Qaeda may not be the only challenge liberalism faces today, or even the greatest.&quot; In a February 2017 essay for Foreign Policy, Kagan argued that U.S. post-Cold War retrenchment in global affairs has emboldened Russia and China, &quot;the two great revisionist powers,&quot; and will eventually lead to instability and conflict.

In October 2018, Kagan said, &quot;Unless are you willing to punish&quot; Saudi Arabia for the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, &quot;then they own you.&quot;

==Writings==
Kagan was a columnist for &quot;The Washington Post.&quot; He has also written for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Commentary&quot;, &quot;World Affairs&quot;, and &quot;Policy Review&quot;. 
In 2003, Kagan&#x27;s book &quot;Of Paradise and Power: America and Europe in the New World Order&quot;, published on the eve of the US invasion of Iraq, created something of a sensation through its assertions that Europeans tended to favor peaceful resolutions of international disputes while the United States takes a more &quot;Hobbesian&quot; view in which certain kinds of disagreement can only be settled by force, or, as he put it: &quot;Americans are from Mars and Europe is from Venus.&quot; A &quot;New York Times&quot; book reviewer, Ivo H. Daalder wrote:
In &quot;Dangerous Nation: America&#x27;s Place in the World from its Earliest Days to the Dawn of the Twentieth Century&quot; (2006) Kagan argued forcefully against what he considers the widespread misconception that the United States had been isolationist since its inception. &quot;Dangerous Nation&quot; was awarded the 2007 Lepgold Prize by Georgetown University.

Kagan&#x27;s essay &quot;Not Fade Away: The Myth of American Decline&quot; (&quot;The New Republic&quot;, February 2, 2012) was very positively received by President Obama. Josh Rogin reported in &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; that the president &quot;spent more than 10 minutes talking about it...going over its arguments paragraph by paragraph.&quot; The essay was excerpted from Kagan&#x27;s book, &quot;The World America Made&quot; (2012).

John Bew and Kagan lectured on March 27, 2014, on Realpolitik and American exceptionalism at the Library of Congress.

== Criticism of Donald Trump ==
In February 2016, Kagan publicly left the Republican party (referring to himself as a &quot;former Republican&quot;), endorsing Democrat Hillary Clinton for president. He argued that the Republican Party&#x27;s &quot;wild obstructionism&quot; and an insistence that &quot;government, institutions, political traditions, party leadership and even parties themselves&quot; were things meant to be &quot;overthrown, evaded, ignored, insulted, laughed at&quot; set the stage for the rise of Donald Trump. Kagan called Trump a &quot;Frankenstein monster&quot; and compared him to Napoleon. In May 2016, Kagan wrote an opinion piece in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; regarding Trump&#x27;s campaign entitled &quot;This is how fascism comes to America&quot;. Kagan has said that &quot;all Republican foreign policy professionals are anti-Trump.&quot; In September 2021, Kagan wrote a related opinion essay published in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; by the title &quot;Our constitutional crisis is already here&quot;. He continued his criticism of Trump in November 2023 with another essay in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; entitled &quot;A Trump dictatorship is increasingly inevitable. We should stop pretending.&quot;

In October of 2024, he resigned as editor-at-large from the &quot;Post&quot; due to its decision not to endorse a candidate in the 2024 United States presidential election between Trump and Kamala Harris.

<text>Georgia competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. Georgian National Olympic Committee (GNOC) sent the nation&#x27;s smallest delegation to the Games since the post-Soviet era. A total of 32 athletes, 26 men and 6 women, competed in 10 different sports.

The Georgian team featured four bronze medalists from the previous games: weightlifter Giorgi Asanidze, and wrestlers Akaki Chachua, Eldar Kurtanidze, and Mukhran Vakhtangadze. Among these medalists, Asanidze managed to beat his opponents and overhaul the host nation&#x27;s defending champion Pyrros Dimas for the gold in the men&#x27;s 85 kg class. Other notable athletes included pistol shooter and 1988 Olympic champion Nino Salukvadze, who participated in her fifth games under three different banners (the other two were Soviet Union and the Unified Team) as the oldest and most experienced member of the contingent, and judoka and world champion Zurab Zviadauri, who was appointed by GNOC to be the nation&#x27;s flag bearer in the opening ceremony.

Georgia left Athens with a total of four medals (two golds and two silver). These medals were officially awarded to Asanidze, Zviadauri, lightweight judoka Nestor Khergiani, and Greco-Roman wrestler Ramaz Nozadze.

<doc id="913820" wikidata="Q14981259" url="?curid=913820" title="The Woman Warrior">
<text>The Woman Warrior: Memoirs of a Girlhood Among Ghosts is a book written by Chinese American author Maxine Hong Kingston and published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1976. The book blends autobiography with old Chinese folktales.

&quot;The Woman Warrior&quot; won the National Book Critics Circle Award and was named one of &quot;TIME&quot; magazine&#x27;s top nonfiction books of the 1970s.

==Genre==
The specific genre of &quot;The Woman Warrior&quot; has been disputed due to Kingston&#x27;s blend of perspectives, specifically traditional Chinese folktale and memoir. With this mixture, Kingston tries to provide her audience with the cultural, familial, and personal context needed to understand her unique position as a first-generation Chinese-American woman.

Susan Stanford Friedman&#x27;s assessment of autobiography with regard to women and minority groups explains Kingston&#x27;s intricate blend of perspective and genre: women and cultural minorities often don&#x27;t have the privilege of viewing themselves as individuals isolated from their gender or racial group. Kingston illustrates this condition through her use of Chinese talk-story, her mother&#x27;s traditional Chinese perspective, and her own first-person view as a Chinese American.

==Plot summary==
The book is divided into five interconnected chapters, which read like short stories.

===&quot;No-Name Woman&quot;===
In the first part of this chapter, the narrator is recounting how her mother once told her the story of the No-Name Woman. The chapter essentially opens as a vignette told from the mother&#x27;s point of view. She tells the story of the No-Name Woman, her husband&#x27;s deceased sister. The middle portion of this chapter is Kingston&#x27;s retelling of the No-Name Woman Story. Kingston uses her own experiences with Chinese tradition and culture to substantiate alternate &quot;versions&quot; of the tale. At the end of &quot;No-Name Woman&quot;, Kingston reflects on the importance of her mother&#x27;s story. She concludes that the real lesson is not how No-Name Woman died, but rather, why she was forgotten.

===&quot;White Tigers&quot;===
In the first part of &quot;White Tigers&quot;, Kingston recounts her mother&#x27;s talk-story of Fa Mu Lan, a woman warrior who took her father&#x27;s place in battle. Kingston reverts to talking about her life in America and compares it to the story of Fa Mu Lan. She cannot gather the courage to speak up against her racist boss, let alone save her people in China. In the end, Kingston decides that she and Fa Mu Lan are similar.

===&quot;Shaman&quot;===
Using her mother&#x27;s old diplomas and photos from her years in China, Kingston recounts the story of her mother&#x27;s life as a lady scholar. Brave Orchid, Kingston&#x27;s mother, returns home after two years of study. Kingston was born during World War II and grew up with her mother&#x27;s talk-stories. Her mother taught her that all white people around her were &quot;ghosts&quot;.

===&quot;At the Western Palace&quot;===
&quot;At the Western Palace&quot; opens with Brave Orchid, her two children, and her niece at San Francisco International Airport. Brave Orchid is waiting for her sister, Moon Orchid, to arrive from Hong Kong. Moon Orchid is emigrating to the United States after being separated from her sister for 30 years. The sisters arrive back at Brave Orchid&#x27;s house in the Valley. They are greeted by Brave Orchid&#x27;s husband, who has aged significantly in Moon Orchid&#x27;s eyes. Moon Orchid spends the summer in Brave Orchid&#x27;s house. Brave Orchid, her oldest son, Moon Orchid, and Moon Orchid&#x27;s daughter drive South to Los Angeles. They are on a mission to find Moon Orchid&#x27;s husband. At the end of the chapter, Moon Orchid declines in mental health and is forced to return to live with Brave Orchid.

===&quot;A Song for a Barbarian Reed Pipe&quot;===
In this story, Kingston reveals that her mother cut the membrane under her tongue. Kingston despises a Chinese girl who is a year older than she is because she refuses to talk. One day, she finds herself alone with the girl in the lavatory. Kingston writes about other eccentric stories. After Kingston screams to her mother and father that she does not want to be set up with the developmentally disabled boy, she launches into a laundry list of things she is and is not going to do, regardless of her mother&#x27;s opinion. In the final part, Kingston tells the story of Ts&#x27;ai Yen, a poet born in A.D. 175.

==Themes==
===Necessity and extravagance===

In an essay about &quot;The Woman Warrior,&quot; Sau-Ling Cynthia Wong writes about &quot;the protagonist&#x27;s struggle toward a balance between self-actualization and social responsibility... identified as &#x27;Necessity&#x27; and &#x27;Extravagance.&#x27;&quot;

==Language and narrative voice==
The language of &quot;The Woman Warrior&quot; invokes a complex juxtaposition of cultural and linguistic voices. Kingston tries to capture and emulate the nuances of Chinese speech through her prose. Trying to transmit a Sinitic language by means of an Indo-European language was no easy task, and one that Kingston had to pursue actively. Nevertheless, &quot;The Woman Warrior&quot; is not pure talk-story. There is, in fact, a blending of first, second, and third person narration. The first-person narration of Kingston is her own American voice, the second-person is that of the Chinese talk-story, and the third-person (which only appears in &quot;At the Western Palace&quot;) is a mixture; a talk-story transposed from Kingston&#x27;s Chinese parents to her American siblings, and finally back to Kingston herself. What results from this combination of voices can only be described as a &quot;fusion language&quot; unique to Kingston, almost like her own type of Creole language.

Writing in this &quot;fusion language&quot;, which is an American language with Asian tones and accents, or rhythm, is a way that Kingston brings together Chinese and Western experiences. This &quot;melding&quot; of the two experiences – the images and metaphors—is what makes Kingston&#x27;s style her own. Kingston admits that one of the ways she works to bring these two together is to speak Chinese while writing or typing in English.

==Writing process==
The completion of &quot;The Woman Warrior&quot; came from Kingston&#x27;s on-the-spot writing of her thoughts. She wrote down anything—until some of it started falling into place. It was this habit that allowed Kingston to complete &quot;The Woman Warrior&quot; in just three years while teaching at a boarding school that demanded she be on call twenty-four hours a day.

The original title of &quot;The Woman Warrior&quot; was &quot;Gold Mountain Stories&quot;. As Kingston stated in a 1986 interview with Jody Hoy:

&quot; &quot;The publishers didn&#x27;t like a title that sounds like a collection of short stories; they never like to publish collections of short stories. I wasn&#x27;t that happy with either of those titles. I think that calling that book The Woman Warrior emphasizes &#x27;warrior.&#x27; I&#x27;m not really telling the story of war, I want to be a pacifist.&quot;&quot;

In terms of Kingston&#x27;s decision-making process in what to include and exclude from her story, she admits to using only what she deemed was &quot;necessary&quot; cultural imagery. She didn&#x27;t want readers to approach her work as &quot;exotic.&quot; What cultural references she did allow to remain in &quot;The Woman Warrior&quot; she considered to be more &quot;American-friendly.&quot; This, of course, was a very subjective endeavor on her part, and, in a more recent reflection she had on &quot;The Woman Warrior&quot;, Kingston was quoted as calling the cultural references &quot;really Chinese.&quot;

==Criticism==
Since its publication in 1976, &quot;The Woman Warrior&quot; has maintained a &quot;vexed reception history that both attests to its popularity and questions it.&quot; Much of the debate concerns &quot;autobiographical accuracy, cultural authenticity, and ethnic representativeness,&quot; while the central concern is whether or not Kingston offers a faithful representation of Chinese and Chinese American culture.

Asian American scholars have expressed strong criticisms of &quot;The Woman Warrior&quot;. Writer Jeffery Paul Chan criticized Kingston for posing the book as non-fiction despite the many fictional elements of its stories. He stated that Kingston gave a distorted view of Chinese culture: one that is partially based on her own experience, but mostly fictional. Chan also noted Kingston&#x27;s mistranslation of the Cantonese term, &quot;ghost&quot;, and Benjamin R. Tong, another Asian American writer, stated that this mistranslation was done deliberately to &quot;suit white tastes so that her book would sell better.&quot;


Tong further stated, based on &quot;The Woman Warrior&quot;&#x27;s fictionalized elements and inaccuracies about Chinese culture and history, that Kingston manipulates her white audience by giving them what they think is Chinese culture, which in reality is only a caricature based on Western stereotypes of Chinese people.

Scholar Sheryl Mylan stated that Kingston constructs an Orientalist framework to separate herself from her mother and her culture, but in the process she replicates the ideologies of the American culture. Professor Sau-Ling Cynthia Wong stated that Kingston&#x27;s &quot;Orientalist effect&quot; is the result of Kingston&#x27;s failure to commensurately critique the patriarchal values or institutional racism of Western society, resulting in a lopsided and biased commentary regarding Chinese culture. Scholar David Li suggested that &quot;The Woman Warrior&quot; functions as &quot;a means of contesting power between the dominant culture and the ethnic community; whose value lies in foregrounding the representational issues that have accompanied growth of Asian American creative and critical production.&quot;

Among the most caustic criticisms was author and playwright Frank Chin&#x27;s, who accused Kingston of being &quot;unChinese&quot; and &quot;a fake&quot;. Chin criticized Kingston for giving her readers a fictional and exaggerated representation of Chinese people based on American stereotypes, and also criticized her readers for accepting these stereotypes. Chin also accused Kingston of &quot;practising an inauthentic Orientalism inherited from the apologetic autobiographies written in the Chinese American &#x27;high&#x27; tradition.&quot;

In Kingston&#x27;s defense, reviewer Deborah L. Madsen claimed that this accusation showed Chin&#x27;s tendency to privilege the low, working-class tradition of Chinese American writing as &quot;authentic&quot;, which is not Kingston&#x27;s tradition. Madsen claimed that autobiographical Chinese American writing is full of competing discourses that differ both culturally and racially, and as Chinese American writers seek both Chinese ethnicity and American citizenship, the result may be &quot;a subversion of racial authenticity&quot;, which she believed to be the case with Kingston.
Other reviewers, such as Jeehyun Lim, believed that the criticism accusing Kingston of representing the Chinese American community as barbaric &quot;misreads her play with ideas of foreignness and nativeness.&quot;

In 1982, Kingston herself wrote a rebuttal essay entitled, &quot;Cultural Mis-readings by American Reviewers&quot;, in which she disparaged her critics who she believed were insisting she represent the Chinese to some standard of excellence. &quot;Why must I &#x27;represent&#x27; anyone besides myself?&quot; Kingston asked. Others, however, noted that Kingston&#x27;s stories are fictional and therefore do not represent herself, either. The San Francisco Association of Chinese Teachers warned: &quot;Especially for students unfamiliar with the Chinese background, [&quot;The Woman Warrior&quot;] could give an overly negative impression of the Chinese American experience.&quot; Even a Chinese American female scholar sympathetic to Kingston wrote that &quot;for a minority author to exercise such artistic freedom is perilous business because white critics and reviewers persist in seeing [fictional] expressions by [Kingston] as no more than cultural history.&quot;

<doc id="913829" wikidata="Q7126543" url="?curid=913829" title="Palaestra at Olympia">
<text>The palaestra at Olympia (Greek παλαίστρ-α, -αι, &quot;wrestling ground or grounds,&quot; Latin palaestr-a, -ae, with Greek ἐν Όλυμπία, Latin in Olympia) is the ground or grounds in ancient Olympia where πάλη, Doric πάλα, &quot;wrestling,&quot; was taught and performed for training purposes; i.e., &quot;wrestling-school.&quot; Two other martial arts were taught there: Greek πυγμή (pygme), Latin pugnus, &quot;fist, boxing,&quot; and Greek παγκράτιον, Latin pancration or pancratium, &quot;any method,&quot; which was free-style, or hand-to-hand, including grappling, kicking, punching, or any unarmed method whatever, no holds barred. The latter was sometimes deadly, or disfiguring (with permission), which indicates that the arts were ephebic, or &quot;soldier&quot; training for prospective citizens of the city-state sponsoring the school, such as Elis, but here combined with prospective candidacy for contention in the games. Be that as it may, none of the games were conducted without rules, umpires, and judges, who did not hesitate to stop contests, fine contenders with in some cases amounts prohibiting future participation, or bar flagrant violators.

The architecture of the martial arts school was standard in the Graeco-Roman world: a hollow square bordered all around by a peribolos (&quot;border&quot;), here a roofed portico, which in turn was bordered by rooms looking inward, and another border outside of it consisting of rooms facing outward, back-to-back with the inner rooms. The outer rooms possibly housed the resident population of athletes-in-training. The layout is standard military similar to that of a camp hospital, which placed patients in the outer rooms and grew medicinal herbs in the quadrangle.

== Location==
The ultimate authority on the features of ancient Olympia is generally considered to be Pausanias, who lived and wrote under the &quot;good emperors&quot; in the 2nd century; that is, he was least subject to imperial ideological terror. His &quot;Description of Greek&quot; covers his first-hand observations recorded during his expeditionary travels, Olympia being described under Elis, Books 5 and 6. Two passages are especially relevant to the athletic training school:
:The Town Hall (prytaneion) of the Eleans is within the Atlantis, and it has been destroyed beside the exit beyond the gymnasium. In this gymnasium are the running-tracks (dromoi) and the wrestling-grounds (palaistrai) for the athletes.
:In the gymnasium at Olympia it is customary for pentathletes (pentathloi) and runners (dromeis) to practise, ... There is also another enclosure (peribolos), less than this, to the left of the entrance to the gymnasium, and the athletes have their wrestling-schools (palaistrai) here. Adjoining the wall of the eastern porch of the gymnasium are the dwellings (oikeiseis) of the athletes, turned towards the southwest.

These passages made it possible for the archaeologists to connect the descriptions of Pausanias to edifices and areas of the excavated site. The &quot;exit beyond the gymnasium&quot; has to be either the north exit, leading to the town, or the south exit, leading (at that time) across the Alfeios River. The gymnasion contains dromoi, but the main running course, the stadium, is not near either exit or any building that could be construed to have been a prytaneum. The only other dromoi found are in item 20, near the north exit. The prytaneum then falls into place as item 2.

Pausanias says that the gymnasion included both the dromoi and the palaistrai, and that both dromeis and pentathloi trained there. The pentathlon was a &quot;five-contest&quot; event: long jumping, javelin throwing, disk throwing, short running, and wrestling. Unless Pausanias repeated himself, the dromeis must have been long-race runners, which fact would leave the stadium with no purpose, unless the gymnasion were only for training. The show was held in the stadium.

The palaistra, reserved for &quot;confrontative,&quot; or martial arts, was on the left of the entrance to the gymnasion, which must therefore have been the passageway between items 20 and 21, which led through an entrance building. Entrants could then turn left to the palaistrai or right to the dromoi, an area dubbed the gymnasion by the archaeologists for convenience. Both sides were the gymnasion, a name which was sometimes applied also just to the palaistra. Along the eastern side of the dromoi was another roofed portico (stoa) and along its eastern edge more foundations and rubble. This alone could have been the remains of the oikeiseis, or the term might also include the same sort of remains on the east of the palaistra. At this point Pausanias becomes enigmatic, mentioning the oikeiseis that &quot;turned to the southwest,&quot; one possibility being that they continued around to the south side of the palaistra.

Pausanias uses both dromoi and palaistrai, plurals. The Greek possibly uses the plural to mean singular in the case of palaistrai, paralleled by English wrestling-grounds for one ground. This may be true for dromoi, but such a view is archaeologically suspicious. The archaeological gymnasion has a south stoa that runs into the brush on the left bank of the Kladieos.

Evidence acquired after 3000 suggests that there was another dromos approximately in the current bed of the river, which is also believed to have been its original, natural location. A water retaining wall termed &quot;the Kladieos Wall&quot; has been found on the right bank of the Kladieos, suggesting that it was once on the left bank, and was for the purpose of rerouting the river to the west, so that the gymnasion could be built into its former location. The wall is classical, but not precisely dateable. When it was no longer maintained the Kladeos broke into its old channel from the north and washed away the western dromos. Most of the wall remains buried, along, no doubt, with foundations of the western portico, now so far below the water table (like the hippodrome) as to be unexcavateable.

==Architecture==
===The question of type===
The palaestra is very nearly square, missing it but slightly. The length and width are 66.35 m and 66.75 m, with a difference of . The hollow square, however, is square to . Given the tradition of square palaestras, it is safe to say the palaistra was intended to be square by its builders. The square is oriented with its sides approximately perpendicular to the cardinal points (N, S, E, W). However, it missed that orientation by a 2-degree CCW rotation. Some of the features in the plan have the same offset, some have more of an offset, and a few are aligned on the cardinal points. They all seem aligned on something else; i.e., the rotations are not randomly distributed. As they are of different ages, one might conjecture that the builders of each age were capable of better surveying precision and did have a plan in mind.

The tradition that the palaistra was a type of building was already extant in Greek culture before Pausanias. An ideal type was presented by Vitruvius, Roman architect, in &quot;De architectura&quot; (&quot;On Architecture&quot;), Book 5.11.1 – 5.11.4, although at that time he admitted palaestrae were &quot;not usual in Italy.&quot; He thought it best, he said, &quot;to set forth the traditional way,&quot; which he believed was Greek. There are certain problems with its credibility. One might well question whether he had actually built any to ideal specifications, or if this is an imaginary model from which to select real features.

Vitruvius constructs a definition of a palaestra, beginning with “a square or oblong peristyle” (peristylia quadrata sive oblonga), which was the preferred plan for any large-area building, as it kept the roof to a minimum and distributed natural daylight to each room. The square shape of the Olympian palaistra caused a mistaken trend in the classical archaeology of the times to identify any square peristyle as a palaistra. After listing several examples, such as a peristyle room in the building at Paestum dubbed “the asclepion of Paestum,” which turned out on later assessment to have been a dining hall, Emme presents five palaistral plans besides Olympia of which he is certain.

These six plans (including Olympia) form Emme&#x27;s base for defining his palaestral type. Four of them are square, one oblong (Amphipolis). Four are aligned with the sides perpendicular to the cardinal direction, one (Delos) with the diagonals perpendicular; i.e., N-S runs from corner to corner. They date from the 4th to the 2nd centuries BC. However, mere quadrature and directionality are insufficient to distinguish the palaistra, as many other buildings have those. Emme goes on to borrow a page from Vitruvius.
Vitruvius begins his description of the palaestra with some fundamentally wrong assumptions, which demonstrate that he had no first-hand acquaintance with palaestrae. He describes a two-part gymnasion (like Olympia): “inside a palaestra” (5.11.1, 5.11.2), and “on the outside” (5.11.3). Both are apparently squares of colonnades, back-to back in the center. Since they each have a south side, they are aligned N-S. The walkways are called xysti (Greek xystoi), “polished,” (or secondarily &quot;chipped&quot;) from the pavements, either glossy or evidencing embedded fragments (tile or concrete with embedded pebbles or rubble). In the northern square the walkways are 10 feet wide. Outside the east and west after a step-down of 1.5 feet are parallel running tracks, unpolished, 12 feet wide. Inside the square a sort of garden is laid out with walks called xysta or paradromides and plantings of plane trees. The whole idea is that in the summer the athletes use the walkways in the center but in winter move to the porticos. The north side is a stadium where contests are held observed by onlookers occupying seats along the north.

It is the dimensions that give Vitruvius away. The periphery of each square must be one diaulos (“two-pipe”), the length of the Olympic stadium and back, the distance of the long run in the games, which, by measurement of the stadium, is double 212.54 or . One side of one square is half a Greek stadion. To complete the long run in the gymnasion the athlete must run around the periphery of the inside track. If he is running on the xystus he must leave it to cross the north side, being exposed to bad weather anyway. Furthermore, the stadium on the north side is only half the Olympic length, too small. The palaestra, however, is bursting with more space than it can ever use. No archaeological palaistrai are that large; most are smaller than the Olympic palaistra, which is dwarfed by its large gymnasion.

===The enigma of the rooms===

As a final incongruity Vitruvius describes some 11 different types of rooms around the periphery of the palaestra, 10 of which are across the north side, while the remaining type is duplicated around the other three sides: 5 on the east, 4 on the west, and 2 on the south. Considering that this is a wrestling school, one might reason that these rooms had to do with the teaching of wrestling, but not so. In Vitruvius they are 
:…roomy recesses … with seats in them, where philosophers, rhetoricians, and others who delight in learning may sit and converse,
apparently untroubled by all the wrestling being conducted feet from them. These philosophers of the palaistra are similar to the general peripatetic population who might be wandering about the xysta, and are prevented from interfering with the runners by the step-downs, at least in winter.

As for the function rooms across the north, the Olympic palaestra&#x27;s north side, which is long, is distributed into only 5 rooms, half the required number. The average length per room is , which indicates that the rooms are for groups, not individuals, in contrast to the housing units on the outside the wall. Noting that different palaistrai have different numbers of function rooms, and that most of Vitruvius&#x27; rooms remain otherwise unknown, Emme completes his definition of a palaistra by adding the minimum number of known archaeological features possessed by his basic set of palaistrai. They are known from inscriptions, such as those at Delos, and their readily identifiable archaeological characteristics.

===Water at Olympia===
Every palaestra must have water for washing. The Romans were lavish in their provision of it, for which their civilization has long been known. They typically provided it in public baths, where for a small price any citizen could anoint himself with oil, scrape it off with the dirt using a strigil, sweat in the heated steam room, wash in hot water, take a cold plunge in the cold room, and spend as much time as he had lounging in the swimming pool enjoying the company of fellow citizens, many of whom were nude women taking a dip. Baths (thermae, &quot;hot waters&quot;) were typically distinct from athletic facilities, but sometimes they were not.

Palaistrai, which were relatively late in the classical period, if not connected to thermae, incorporated some of these bath facilities in their rooms, perhaps a furnace for heating water, perhaps a cold plunging pool, perhaps washrooms with basins. The presence of these facilities left an architectural stamp, which Emme considers the mark of a palaistra, with other stamps.

Water facilities alone did not make a palaistra. Most of the remaining buildings of Olympia were Roman and used water lavishly. There were a number of thermae scattered on the periphery of the Altis, a hotel with a central swimming pool and other buildings, probably private clubs, with various water facilities. These were not characteristic of the park for most of its ancient life. They were constructed during the last phase of Roman dominance, when Roman officers appear in the inscriptions, and non-athletic victories were awarded to Roman colonial governors, such as the &quot;best government&quot; award.

In the 1st century, Olympia attracted large numbers of contenders and spectators, becoming an international attraction. It expanded to accommodate the traffic. The water resources were not equal to the population. By 1898 the excavators had found nine wells, which required lifting water out. The lines must have been long. Each spectator would have to bring his own jug.

There were a few fountains receiving water from the upper Kladeos by aqueduct. The water was scant and muddy after a rain. On the south side, the swifter and more copious Alpheios was too hard (high in dissolved carbonates) to drink. The masses that arrived in July and August, the hottest months of the year, unrelieved by rain, apparently suffered the most. Infectious diseases were rampant, which the citizenry blamed on lack of water (being unfamiliar with microbes). Visiting Olympia could be a hellish experience, yet people continued to show up in large numbers.
In the middle of the 2nd century an unplanned accident drew the attention of the scholar, civil engineer and philanthropist Herodes Atticus, to the water problems at Olympia. Atticus and his wife donated the nymphaeum fountain. The water came to the fountain by aqueduct from a spring 4 km away and was then piped to the palaestra and other places within Olympia. 

===Solutions to the paradoxes of Vitruvius===

Vitruvius based his account on tradition, as he says, but he has made certain key assumptions that demonstrate an ignorance of the real place, one of which is that the xystos offers any substantial shelter from either bad weather or winter weather. As the portico is only up to 10 yards wide, it is essentially still an outdoor building. Wind blows through it carrying whatever precipitation there is. Winters in the Peloponnesus though lacking the severity of winters northward are still not what one would call mild. Vitruvius presents the view that, while Roman soldiers are huddling in their winter camps, and all games and all military campaigning are suspended until the spring season, Olympian athletes are outdoors in the freezing wind blowing through the porticos in light clothing at best, if not naked, slipping over the ice and through patches of snow.

Vitruvius, an ex-military engineer, may have been thinking of the closed sheds in which Roman units sometimes performed winter drilling, but those were constructed to cover the whole campus, or drilling field. Moreover, they were dressed in fighting armor and wore hob-nailed boots. Based on the climate, it is probably safe to say, only on rare warm days were there any hardy runners on the tracks in the gymnasium of Olympia, and they were not likely to be children. Both training and games were seasonal, and the runners did not run in the pouring rain, sleet, or snow, even in the porticos. There is no evidence that the people of classical times had any immunity from pneumonia or hypothermia, or that mothers were inclined to expose their young runners to the conditions causing these deadly physical states.

Winter practice of the other four events of the pentathlon in the porticos is equally absurd. Simple logic points to the conclusion that, at Olympia at least, the running field and its porticos were entirely seasonal. There was not much rain in the summer, but one might hypothesize that in the spring and autumn the porticos were used for shelter from the rain. A four-sided portico would be best for such an arrangement, but the gymnasion at Olympia did not have one of those. Moreover, if there were one, cross-winds would invalidate two of the sides.

Apparently, the use of porticos for running is waste of expensive space. For them to be of any use, they should be continuous, wide, and walled in on one side. Although such an arrangement is often true of palaistrai, it is not for gymnasia or stadia. The question remains, what is the use of porticos in gymnasia. Some literary fragments describe persons seeking shelter from the sun in porticos. In the summer much of Greece is subject to such high temperatures as to create semi-arid terrain in places. For runners in the hot sun, heat prostration was a real possibility. As is described above, water was always a pressing necessity. The Romans at Olympia ran water channels beside both the stadium and the porticos in the gymnasion.

In the palaistra, the one place that had sufficient backed porticos for running, running was not practiced. There was not enough periphery in which to run. In the winter the wrestlers hypothetically wrestled under the porticos, but wrestling there is even less likely than running in the outdoor porticos. All formal wrestling, ancient or modern, has been conducted on soft surfaces. A fall on a hard surface, such as a xystos, would have likely resulted in severe or potentially fatal injuries. In the classical era, wrestling was typically practiced on either sand or mud, and since neither were found on xysti, it is unlikely to have taken place there.

===Archaeological specifications===
The palaistra is somewhat symmetrical in plan. Like all palaestra, the palaestra at Olympia is centered on a large courtyard covered with sand for use as a boxing or wrestling surface. Along all four sides of the palaestra are rooms that opened onto the porticoes.

The building is entered through the south side through two separate doorways, each with Corinthian columns distyle in antis, thus immediately establishing symmetry within the plan of the structure. The doorways open into bench-lined vestibules leading to anterooms that open directly onto the southern portico. Between the two anterooms is a long, shallow hall lined with benches and faced with Ionic columns. This room is identified as the &quot;apodyterion&quot;, or undressing room, a space that would need to be close to the main entrance and have room for athletes and friends to meet.

Directly across from the &quot;apodyterion&quot;, along the north side of the palaestra is the &quot;ephebion&quot;, or clubroom. This large, colonnaded hall is deeper than the &quot;apodyterion&quot;, but does not run the entire length of the courtyard. The entire north side of the palaestra has deep rooms, a feature mentioned by Vitruvius, which offered shelter from the sun. Also in the north side of the building is a doorway that leads directly into the rest of the adjoining gymnasium space. The room in the northeast corner of the palaestra is identified as a bathroom. The brick-lined, 4 meter square and 1.38 meter deep tank found here is dated to the Roman period, however.

An unusual feature of the palaestra is the 24.20 by 5.44 meter strip of concrete pavement on the north side of courtyard, which is formed with alternate bands of ribbed and smooth tiles arranged to create continuous ridges stretching the length of the pavement. This was probably a sort of bowling alley, as suggested by a similar pavement found at Pompeii with heavy stone balls on it.

==Development of the confrontative arts at Olympia==
The ancient Greeks recorded in their honorific inscriptions and chronologies the holding of Olympic games once every four years, listing the victors for each type of contest. The better parts of this &quot;Olympic victor list,&quot; as it is now styled, survive in fragments of various media from engraved inscriptions to fragments of works now published as works of ancient authors. The preservation of this list has been the concern of authors from ancient times to now.

One 4-year period is &quot;an Olympiad,&quot; which may be divided further into years 1 through 4. There was a continuous record of Olympiads from the first in 776 BC. Due to the growing national and even international participation and interest in the games, it became customary to state the Olympiad in chronicles of any events of historical interest. None made the claim that the first Olympiad was the beginning of the games, as there was an extensive legendary tradition about them. Pausanias&#x27; view is that &quot;the unbroken tradition&quot; was a restoration of games that had been discontinued. The earliest restored events were entirely running.

<doc id="913833" wikidata="Q313121" url="?curid=913833" title="Ramesses XI">
<text>Menmaatre Ramesses XI (also written Ramses and Rameses) reigned from 1107 BC to 1078 BC or 1077 BC and was the tenth and final pharaoh of the Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt and as such, was the last king of the New Kingdom period. He ruled Egypt for at least 29 years although some Egyptologists think he could have ruled for as long as 30. The latter figure would be up to 2 years beyond this king&#x27;s highest known date of Year 10 of the &quot;Whm Mswt&quot; era or Year 28 of his reign. One scholar, Ad Thijs, has suggested that Ramesses XI could even have reigned as long as 33 years.

It is believed that Ramesses ruled into his Year 29 since a graffito records that the general and High Priest of Amun Piankh returned to Thebes from Nubia on III Shemu day 23—or just 3 days into what would have been the start of Ramesses XI&#x27;s 29th regnal year. Piankh is known to have campaigned in Nubia during Year 28 of Ramesses XI&#x27;s reign (or Year 10 of the Whm Mswt) and would have returned home to Egypt in the following year.

==Background==
Ramesses XI was once thought to be the son of Ramesses X by Queen Tyti who was a King&#x27;s Mother, King&#x27;s Wife and King&#x27;s Daughter in her titles. However, recent scholarly research into certain copies of parts of the Harris papyrus (or Papyrus BM EA 10052)--collected by Anthony Harris—which discusses a harem conspiracy against Ramesses III reveals that Tyti was instead a queen of pharaoh Ramesses III instead. Hence, Ramesses XI&#x27;s mother was not Tyti and although he could have been a son of his predecessor, this is not established either. Ramesses XI is believed to have married &quot;Tentamun&quot;, the daughter of Nebseny, with whom he is assumed to have fathered Duathathor-Henuttawy—the future wife of the high priest Pinedjem I. Ramesses XI may have had another daughter named Tentamun who became king Smendes&#x27; future wife in the next dynasty.

Sometime during his reign, the High Priest of Amun, Amenhotep, was ousted from office by Pinehesy, the Viceroy of Kush who for some time took control of the Thebais. Although this “suppression of the High Priest of Amun” used to be dated quite early in the reign (prior to year 9 of the reign), recently the &quot;communis opinio&quot; has changed to the view that it took place only shortly before the start of the Whm Mswt or Renaissance, an era which was inaugurated in regnal Year 19, probably to stress the return of normal conditions following the &quot;coup&quot; of Pinehesy.

==Accession date==
Ramesses XI is usually assigned an accession date of III shemu 20 (third month of the Summer season, day 20) However, a later 20th Dynasty papyrus fragment from Deir el-Medina published in 2023 by the Egyptologist Robert J. Demarée refers to a partial date of Year 4, III month of Akhet together with a change to Year 1, IV month of Akhet. Although both kings are unnamed, the papyrus is strongly suggested by Demarée to refer to the reigns of Ramesses X and his successor Ramesses XI. If confirmed, this would mean that Ramesses XI actually had his accession date between the IIIrd and IVth month of Akhet rather than III Shemu 20 as is conventionally assumed.

Demarée stresses in his 2023 paper that the sources which support an accession date of III Shemu day 20 for Ramesses XI are hardly conclusive:
: The two key documents quoted are P. Turin Cat. 1888 + Cat. 2095 and P. Ashmolean Museum 1945.96, the Adoption Papyrus. The first is a journal text from the reign of Ramesses XI containing a series of dates spread over several months, with only one full date: Year 18 IV Smw Day 14 or 24. Considering this as certain indication of a recent year change is speculation and beyond proof. The second document is the famous Adoption Papyrus, P. Ashmolean Museum 1945.96. In the words of its first editor, Alan Gardiner, the opening lines of this document record, on III Smw Day 20, a visit by Ramesses XI to the Temple of Karnak to announce his accession to the god Amun, followed by an offering to this deity. The text clearly only speaks of informing the god Amun of the accession of the king – sr.t xa n nTr pn Sps n Imn. Contrary to the opinion of the scholars who first posited III Smw Day 20 as the coronation date, the accession of the king did not take place on that day at Karnak. This ceremony certainly had already taken place earlier either in the [Royal] Delta residence or at Memphis, and as usual the king later had to pay visits to other state gods to inform them of his accession.

==The whm-mswt era==

Ramesses XI&#x27;s reign is notable for a large number of important papyri that have been discovered, including the &quot;Adoption Papyrus&quot;, which mentions regnal years 1 and 18 of his reign; &quot;Pap. B.M. 10052&quot;, &quot;Pap. Mayer A&quot;, &quot;Pap. B.M. 10403&quot; and &quot;Pap. B.M. 10383&quot; (the last four containing the accounts of tomb-robbery trials conducted during the first two years of the Whm Mswt); &quot;Pap. Ambras&quot; (containing a list of documents which were repurchased in year 6 of the Whm Mswt, after having been stolen from some temple archive, most probably during the chaotic period of the suppression of the High Priest of Amun Amenhotep); the &quot;Turin Taxation Papyrus&quot;, of an unspecified year 12; Pap. B.M. 10068, which includes on its verso two lists, called the &quot;House-list&quot; (from an unspecified year 12) and the Srmt-list (undated, but slightly later than the &quot;Houselist&quot;); Pap. B.M. 9997, of an unspecified year 14 and 15; and an entire series of &quot;Late Ramesside Letters&quot; written by -among others- the scribes of the Necropolis Dhutmose, Butehamun, and the High Priest Piankh. Late Ramesside Letter no. 9 establishes that the Whm Mswt period lasted into a 10th year (which more or less equates year 28 proper of Ramesses XI).

Pinehesy was subsequently designated as an enemy in several papyri from year 1 and 2 of the whm-mswt (equalling year 19 and 20 proper of Ramesses XI) where his name was consistently associated &quot;by the nDs [or] (‘bad’) bird as its determinative&quot; in these papyri.

How exactly the anarchic period of the Suppression was ended and who ultimately forced Pinehesy out of Thebes is unknown, due to a lack of explicit sources. However, it seems that Pinehesy retreated to Nubia and succeeded in maintaining some sort of powerbase there for over a decade. 
In year 10 of the whm-mswt the then general and High Priest Piankh goes on an expedition to Nubia to &quot;meet Pinehesy&quot;.
Although it is often postulated that it was the aim of this campaign to fight the former Viceroy, this is by no means certain. 
The sources are actually ambiguous on this point and the political climate may well have changed over the years. There is some evidence that at this time Piankh may no longer have been a loyal servant of Ramesses XI, which allows for the possibility that he was secretly negotiating with Pinehesy, possibly even plotting against the reigning king.
E. Wente wrote: &quot;One has the impression that the viceroy and his Nubian troops were loyalists, for the remarks made by his opponent Piankh in letter No. 301 are quite disparaging of the pharaoh, Ramesses XI.&quot; In this letter, better known as LRL no. 21, Piankh remarks:
In the same letter and two others (LRL no. 34 and no. 35) Piankh gives the order to the Scribe of the Necropolis Tjaroy (=Dhutmose), the lady Nodjmet and a certain Payshuuben to secretly arrest and question two Medjay policemen about certain things they had apparently said:

Whereas Piankh would probably have had the authority to have people executed, it is noteworthy that his correspondents are explicitly urged to keep the matter secret. It has been argued that, given Piankh&#x27;s supreme position at the time, the secrecy can only have concerned the king. If this is correct, it follows that the political situation of the time must have been very complex, with Piankh possibly acting on some hidden agenda. Unfortunately, due to the very limited nature of the sources, the exact relationships between the three main protagonists, Piankh, Pinehesy and Ramesses XI remain far from clear. Some scholars believe that the Nubian campaign was part of an ongoing power struggle between the High Priest of Amun and the Viceroy of Kush However, it is equally possible that Piankh came to the rescue of Pinehesy against some common enemy. The verb often translated as &quot;to attack (Pinehesy)&quot; only means &quot;to meet/ to go to&quot;. In fact, neither the aim of the expedition nor its outcome are beyond doubt. 
The issue is further complicated by the ongoing debate about [1] the order of High Priests (either Herihor before Piankh or Piankh before Herihor) and [2] the correct ascription (either to the pre-Renaissance period or to the whm-mswt itself) of several documents from the reign of Ramesses XI.

At present, Thijs&#x27; suggestion that Pinehesy was apparently rehabilitated by Ramesses XI in year 11 or 12 of the whm-mswt has only been explicitly accepted by the Egyptologist A. Dodson.

==Length of reign==

Neither the length of the Renaissance nor the ascription of certain documents from the reign of Ramesses XI are beyond dispute.
At present, Thijs&#x27; proposal that Papyrus BM 10054 dates to the Whm-Mswt has been confirmed by other scholars such as Von Beckerath and Annie Gasse—the latter in a JEA 87 (2001) paper which studied several newly discovered fragments belonging to this document. Consequently, it would appear that Ramesses XI&#x27;s highest undisputed date is presently Year 11 of the Whm-Mswt (or Year 29 proper) of his reign, when Piankh&#x27;s Nubian campaign terminated which means that the pharaoh had a minimum reign of 29 years when he died—-which can perhaps be extended to 30 years due to the &quot;gap between the beginning of Dynasty 21 and the reign of Ramesses XI.&quot; with 33 years being hypothetical. Krauss and Warburton specifically write that due to the existence of this time gap,

: Egyptologists generally concede that his reign could have ended 1 or 2 years later than year 10 of the &quot;wehem mesut&quot; era = regnal year 28.

Aidan Dodson, however, allows for a &#x27;year 15&#x27; of the Whm-Mswt on the basis of P. BM 9997.

Either during the reign of Ramesses XI or shortly afterwards, the village of Deir El Medina was abandoned, apparently because the Royal Necropolis was shifted northward to Tanis and there was no further need for their services at Thebes.

==Late New Kingdom chronology of Ramesses XI==
The conventional Egyptian chronology view is that Ramesses XI had an independent reign of between 29 and 30 or 33 full years between Ramesses X and Smendes before dying. Shortly before his death, he transferred Egypt&#x27;s political capital to Tanis where he died and was buried by Smendes who succeeded him but only ruled Lower Egypt while Herihor ruled Upper Egypt as the High Priest of Egypt at Thebes. Thijs&#x27; separate proposal that the first 17 years of Ramesses XI&#x27;s reign were entirely contemporary with the reigns of Ramesses IX (Years 5-19) and Ramesses X (Years 1-3) is not currently accepted by most Egyptologists except Aidan Dodson in his 2012 book &quot;Afterglow of Empire&quot;.

==Burial==
Sometime during this troubled period, Ramesses XI died under unknown circumstances. While he had a tomb prepared for himself in the Valley of the Kings (KV4), it was left unfinished and only partly decorated since Ramesses XI instead arranged to have himself buried away from Thebes, possibly near Memphis. This pharaoh&#x27;s tomb, however, includes some unusual features, including four rectangular, rather than square, pillars in its burial chamber and an extremely deep central burial shaft– at over 30 feet or 10 metres long– which was perhaps designed as an additional security device to prevent tomb robbery. During the 21st dynasty, under the reign of the High Priest of Thebes, Pinedjem I, Ramesses XI&#x27;s tomb was used as a workshop for processing funerary materials from the burials of Hatshepsut, Thutmose III and perhaps Thutmose I. Ramesses XI&#x27;s tomb has stood open since antiquity and was used as a dwelling by the Copts.

Since Ramesses XI had himself buried in Lower Egypt, Smendes rose to the kingship of Egypt, based on the well known custom that he who buried the king inherited the throne. Since Smendes buried Ramesses XI, he could legally assume the crown of Egypt and inaugurate the 21st Dynasty from his hometown at Tanis, even if he did not control Middle and Upper Egypt, which were now effectively in the hands of the High Priests of Amun at Thebes.

<text>The U.S. Commission on National Security/21st Century (USCNS/21), also known as the Hart-Rudman Commission or Hart-Rudman Task Force on Homeland Security, was chartered by Secretary of Defense William Cohen in 1998 to provide a comprehensive review of US national security requirements in the 21st century. USCNS/21 was tasked &quot;to analyze the emerging international security environment; to develop a US national security strategy appropriate to that environment; and to assess the various security institutions for their current relevance to the effective and efficient implementation of that strategy, and to recommend adjustments as necessary&quot;.

Released on 31 January 2001, USCNS/21 was the most exhaustive review of US national security strategy since the National Security Act of 1947. USCNS/21 was released in three distinct phases. The first phase, &quot;New World Coming: American Security in the 21st Century&quot; (see further below), anticipates the emerging international security environment within the first quarter of the 21st century and examines how the US fits into that environment. The second phase, &quot;Seeking a National Strategy: A Concert for Preserving Security and Promoting Freedom&quot; (see further below), proposes a new US national security strategy based on the anticipated threats and conditions outlined in the first phase report. The third phase, &quot;Roadmap for National Security: Imperative for Change&quot; (see further below), recommends changes to the US government&#x27;s structure, legislation, and policy to reflect a new national security strategy based on the anticipated 21st century international security environment.

==Mandate and members==

===Charter===

According to the US Commission on National Security/21st Century Charter:

The Department of Defense recognizes that America should advance its position as a strong, secure, and persuasive force for freedom and progress in the world. Consequently, there is a requirement to:
*conduct a comprehensive review of the early 21st century global security environment, including likely trends and potential &#x27;wild cards&#x27;;
*develop a comprehensive overview of American strategic interests and objectives for the security environment we will likely encounter in the 21st century;
*delineate a national security strategy appropriate to that environment and the nation&#x27;s character;
*identify a range of alternatives to implement the national security strategy, by defining the security goals for American society, and by describing the internal and external policy instruments required to apply American resources in the 21st century; and
*develop a detailed plan to implement the range of alternatives by describing the sequence of measures necessary to attain the national security strategy, to include recommending concomitant changes to the national security apparatus as necessary.

A Commission, the U.S. Commission on National Security/21st Century (USCNS/21), will be established to fulfill this requirement, supported by a Study Group. Two individuals who have national recognition and significant depth of experience and public service will oversee the efforts of this Commission and serve as its Co-chairpersons. The study effort shall be conducted by a Study Group, composed of individuals who will be appointed as Department of Defense personnel. Based on the results of this study and the Commission&#x27;s consideration thereof, the USCNS/21 will advance practical recommendations that the President of the United States, with the support of the Congress, could begin to implement in the Fiscal Year 2002 budget, if desired.

==Phase I report – New World Coming: American Security in the 21st Century==
&quot;New World Coming: American Security in the 21st Century&quot; was the first report completed by the Commission. Released on 15 September 1999, it attempts to provide a picture of the international security environment within the first quarter of the 21st century and the anticipated role of the US in that environment. The Commission anticipates an increasingly technologically, economically, and socially integrated world, i.e. increasing globalization amidst social and political fragmentation. The report provides twelve basic assumptions of that environment and fourteen conclusions based on those assumptions.

===Assumptions===

*An economically strong United States is likely to remain a primary political, military, and cultural force through 2025, and will thus have a significant role in shaping the international environment.
*The stability and direction of American society and politics will help shape US foreign policy goals and capacities, and hence the way the US may affect the global future.
*Science and technology will continue to advance and become more widely available and utilized around the world, but their benefits will be less evenly distributed.
*World energy supplies will remain largely based on fossil fuels.
*While much of the world will experience economic growth, disparities in income will increase and widespread poverty will persist.
*The international aspects of business and commerce (trade, transportation, telecommunications, investment and finance, manufacturing, and professional services) will continue to expand.
*Non-governmental organizations (refugee aid organizations, religious and ethnic advocacy groups, environmental and other single-issue lobbies, international professional associations, and others) will continue to grow in importance, numbers, and in their international role.
*Though it will raise important issues of sovereignty, the US will find in its national interest to work with and strengthen a variety of international organizations.
*The US will remain the principal military power in the world.
*Weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, chemical, and biological) and weapons of mass disruption (information warfare) will continue to proliferate to a wider range of state and non-state actors. Maintenance of a robust nuclear deterrent therefore remains essential as well as investment in new forms of defense against these threats.
*We should expect conflicts in which adversaries, because of cultural affinities different from our own, will resort to forms and levels of violence shocking to our sensibilities.
*As the US confronts a variety of complex threats, it will often be dependent on allies; but it will find reliable alliances more difficult to establish and sustain.

===Conclusions===

*America will become increasingly vulnerable to hostile attack on our homeland, and our military superiority will not help us.
*Rapid advances in information and biotechnologies will create new vulnerabilities for US security.
*New technologies will divide the world as well as draw it together.
*The national security of all advanced states will be increasingly affected by the vulnerabilities of the evolving global economic infrastructure.
*Energy will continue to have major strategic significance.
*All borders will be more porous; some will bend and some will break.
*The sovereignty of states will come under pressure, but will endure.
*Fragmentation or failure of states will occur, with destabilizing effects on neighboring states.
*Foreign crises will be replete with atrocities and the deliberate terrorizing of civilian populations.
*Space will become a critical and competitive military environment.
*The essence of war will not change.
*US intelligence will face more challenging adversaries, and even excellent intelligence will not prevent all surprises.
*The US will be called upon frequently to intervene militarily in a time of uncertain alliances and with the prospect of fewer forward deployed forces.
*The emerging security environment in the next quarter century will require different military and other national capabilities.

==Phase II report – Seeking a National Strategy: A Concert for Preserving Security and Promoting Freedom==
Released on 15 April 2000, &quot;Seeking a National Strategy: A Concert for Preserving Security and Promoting Freedom&quot; proposes a new national security strategy based on the anticipated 21st century international security environment. The new strategy must consider how to minimize the potential destabilizing effects of the contradictory trends of globalization and political fragmentation while promoting US interests and values worldwide.

===Strategic considerations===
In developing this new strategy, the Commission suggests a number of strategic considerations:
*Strategy and policy must be grounded in the national interest.
*The maintenance of America&#x27;s strength is a long-term commitment and cannot be assured without conscious, dedicated effort.
*The US faces unprecedented opportunities as well as dangers in the new era.
*The US must find new ways to join with other capable and like-minded nations.
*This nation must set priorities and apply them consistently.
*America must never forget that it stands for certain principles, most importantly freedom under the rule of law. 

===Suggested categorization of US national interests===
Building on these considerations, the Commission suggests categorizing US national interests into three categories: survival, critical, and significant. Survival interests are defined as, &quot;without which America would cease to exist as we know it&quot;. These interests encompass safety from direct attacks by hostile states and terrorists through the use of weapons of mass destruction. They also include preserving America&#x27;s founding principles as outlined in the US Constitution. Critical interests are defined as, &quot;causally one step removed from survival interests&quot;. These interests lie in the continuation of key global systems, such as global energy, economic, communications, transportation, and health infrastructures. Other critical interests include the security of US allies and preventing potentially hostile alliances from being formed to threaten US national security. Significant interests, &quot;importantly affect the global environment in which the US must act&quot;. These interests include spreading democracy abroad and ensuring basic human rights for all the world&#x27;s citizens.

===Priority objectives===
Using these strategic considerations as a foundation, the Commission recommends the following as the priority objectives to the new national security strategy:

*&quot;Defend the US and ensure that it is safe from the dangers of a new era&quot;. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism will be the gravest threat to US national security in the 21st century. These threats must be taken seriously and the highest priority must be given to prevention and deterrence from such attacks.
*&quot;Maintain social cohesion, economic competitiveness, technological ingenuity, and military strength&quot;. The US must re-focus on education, specifically in the sciences, to ensure its technological dominance in the 21st century. Furthermore, the US must reduce its dependence on fossil fuels and investigate other energy alternatives.
*&quot;Assist the integration of key major powers, especially China, Russia, and India, into the mainstream of the emerging international system&quot;. The US must engage emerging, and in Russia&#x27;s case re-emerging, world powers and work to foster their integration into the world&#x27;s economy. However, the US must not lose sight of its own interests. These relationships are especially important in relation to the US&#x27;s effort to limiting nuclear proliferation; cooperation with these powers is absolutely necessary.
*&quot;Promote, with others, the dynamism of the new global economy and improve the effectiveness of international institutions and international law&quot;. The US, along with the G7, must successfully manage the effects, both positive and negative, of globalization on the world stage.
*&quot;Adapt US alliances and other regional mechanisms to a new era in which America&#x27;s partners seek greater autonomy and responsibility&quot;. The US must maintain its current alliances and relationships with other nations as a mechanism to preserve and foster international peace and security.
*&quot;Help the international community tame the disintegrative forces spawned by an era of change&quot;. The US must work with the international community to address and manage the problem of failed states.

==Phase III report – Roadmap for National Security: Imperative for Change==
Released on 31 January 2001, &quot;Roadmap for National Security: Imperative for Change&quot; suggests &quot;significant changes must be made in the structures and processes of the US national security apparatus&quot;. The Commission believes that without these reforms, &quot;American power and influence cannot be sustained&quot;. Five key areas are highlighted for reform, followed by the Commissions specific recommendations for each area.

===Recommendations===

*ensuring the security of the American homeland
*recapitalizing America&#x27;s strengths in science and education
*redesigning key institutions of the Executive Branch
*overhauling the US government personnel system
*reorganizing Congress&#x27;s role in national security affairs

===Securing the national homeland===
The Commission believes that the combination of weapons proliferation and terrorism will result in increased vulnerability to the US homeland. &quot;A direct attack against American citizens &quot;on American soil&quot; is likely over the next quarter century&quot;.
In order protect the homeland against this threat, the Commission suggests:

*&quot;the creation of a new independent National Homeland Security Agency (NHSA) with responsibility for planning, coordinating, and integrating various government activities involved in homeland security&quot;
*&quot;that a new office of Assistant Secretary for Homeland Security be created to oversee the various Department of Defense activities and ensure that the necessary resources are made available&quot;
*&quot;that the National Guard be given homeland security as a primary mission, as the US Constitution itself ordains&quot;
*&quot;that Congress reorganize itself to accommodate this Executive Branch realignment, and that it also form a special select committee for homeland security to provide Congressional support and oversight in this critical area&quot;

===Recapitalizing America&#x27;s strengths in science and education===
The Commission finds that the scientific and educational systems of the US are in &quot;serious crisis&quot;. It notes how the US is in danger of lagging behind other countries in this arena. &quot;In the next quarter century, we will likely see ourselves surpassed, and in relative decline, unless we make a conscious national commitment to maintain our edge&quot;.&lt; The report further highlights the Commission&#x27;s belief that this decline in emphasis on science and education is the gravest threat to US national security, even over weapons proliferation and terrorism. The Commission recommends:
*&quot;doubling the federal research and development budget by 2010, and instituting a more competitive environment for the allotment of those funds&quot;
*&quot;that the role of the President&#x27;s Science Advisor be elevated to oversee these and other critical tasks, such as the resuscitation of the national laboratory system and the institution of better inventory stewardship over the nation&#x27;s science and technology assets&quot;
*&quot;a new National Security Science and Technology Education Act to fund a comprehensive program to produce the needed numbers of science and engineering professionals as well as qualified teachers in science and math&quot;

===Institutional redesign===
The Commission finds that the US government has failed to restructure itself to the post–Cold War world. It recommends significant restructuring to re-align government offices, branches, and procedures with the global realities of the 21st century as well as ensure that,&quot;strategy once again drives the design and implementation of US national security policies&quot;. The Commission urges Congress to expand its understanding of national security matters, and streamline the appropriations and authorizations committees to make intelligence and security related legislation more efficient and effective. The Commission also recommends:
*that &quot;the President personally guide a top-down strategic planning process and that process should be linked to the allocation of resources throughout the government&quot;
*that &quot;legislative, press communications, and speech-writing functions should reside in the White House staff, not separately in the National Security Council staff as they do today&quot;
*&quot;that the Secretary of the Treasury be named a statutory member of the National Security Council&quot;
*that &quot;the President should abolish the National Economic Council, distributing its domestic economic policy responsibilities to the Domestic Policy Council&quot;
*&quot;the creation of five Under Secretaries with the responsibility for overseeing the regions of Africa, Asia, Europe, Inter-America, and Near East/South Asia, and a redefinition of the responsibilities of the Under Secretary for Global Affairs&quot;
*&quot;that the activities of the US Agency for International Development be fully integrated into this new State Department organization&quot;
*&quot;that the new Secretary of Defense reduce by ten to fifteen percent the staffs of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, the military services, and the regional commands&quot;
*that &quot;the Secretary of Defense should establish a ten-year goal of reducing infrastructure costs by 20-25 percent through steps to consolidate, restructure, outsource, and privatize many Department of Defense support agencies and activities as possible&quot;
*that &quot;the Secretary of Defense should move the Quadrennial Defense Review to the second year of a Presidential term&quot;
*&quot;that the Secretary of Defense introduce a new process that requires the Services and defense agencies to compete for the allocation of some resources within the overall defense budget&quot;
*&quot;establishing and employing a two-track acquisition system, one for major acquisitions and a &#x27;fast track&#x27; for a modest number of potential breakthrough systems, especially those in the area of command and control&quot;
*that &quot;the Secretary of Defense should direct the Department of Defense to shift from the threat-based, force sizing process to one which measure requirements against recent operational activity trends, actual intelligence estimates of potential adversaries&#x27; capabilities, and national security objectives as defined in the new administration&#x27;s national security strategy - once formulated&quot;
*&quot;that the Defense Department devote its highest priority to improving and further developing its expeditionary capabilities&quot;
*&quot;the establishment of an Interagency Working Group on Space (IWGS)&quot;
*&quot;that the intelligence community should emphasize the recruitment of human intelligence sources on terrorism as one of the intelligence community&#x27;s highest priorities&quot; and &quot;the community should place new emphasis on collection and analysis of economic and science/technology security concerns, and incorporate more open source intelligence into its analytical products&quot;

<text>Chinese Taipei competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot; was the designated name used by [[Taiwan]] to participate in some international organizations and almost all sporting events, including the Olympic Games. Neither the common name &quot;Taiwan&quot; nor the official name &quot;Republic of China&quot; would be used primarily due to opposition from the People&#x27;s Republic of China. This also was the nation&#x27;s eighth consecutive appearance at the Olympics.

The Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee sent the nation&#x27;s largest delegation to the Games in Olympic history. A total of 89 athletes, 50 men and 39 women, competed only in 14 different sports. This was also the youngest delegation in Chinese Taipei&#x27;s Olympic history, with more than half under the age of 25, and many of them were expected to reach their peak in time for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Baseball player Chen Chih-yuan was appointed by the committee to carry the Chinese Taipei flag in the opening ceremony.

Chinese Taipei left Athens with a total of five Olympic medals (two golds, two silver, and one bronze), being considered its most successful Olympics. Chinese Taipei&#x27;s highlight of the Games came with a remarkable milestone for taekwondo jin Chen Shih-hsin and Chu Mu-yen, claiming the nation&#x27;s first ever gold medals in Olympic history. Meanwhile, another taekwondo jin Huang Chih-hsiung picked up his second medal with a sterling silver in the men&#x27;s lightweight division, adding it to his bronze from Sydney four years earlier.

<doc id="913844" wikidata="Q94857" url="?curid=913844" title="Peganum harmala">
<text>Peganum harmala, commonly called wild rue, Syrian rue, African rue, esfand or espand, or harmel (among other similar pronunciations and spellings), is a perennial, herbaceous plant, with a woody underground rootstock, of the family Nitrariaceae, usually growing in saline soils in temperate desert and Mediterranean regions. Its common English-language name came about because of a resemblance to rue (to which it is not related). Because eating it would sicken or kill livestock, it is considered a noxious weed in a number of countries. It has become an invasive species in some regions of the western United States. The plant is popular in Middle Eastern and north African folk medicine. The alkaloids contained in the plant, including the seeds, are monoamine oxidase inhibitors (Harmine, Harmaline).

==Etymology==
&quot;African rue&quot; is often used in North American English.

&quot;Harmel&quot; is used in India, Algeria, and Morocco.

It is known as in Persian, which is transliterated as , or but may also be pronounced or transliterated as , , , , , , or depending on source or dialect. The Persian word is also the name of the last month of the year, approximately March, in the traditional Persian calendar. It is derived from Middle Persian , which is thought, along with the English word &quot;spinach&quot;, to be ultimately derived from Proto-Iranian &quot;*&quot;, &#x27;holy&#x27; (compare Avestan , , &#x27;holy&#x27;, and Middle Persian , &#x27;holy&#x27;), itself thought to be ultimately derived from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*&quot;.

It is known as in Pashto. In Urdu it is known as , , or . In Turkish it is known as . In Chinese it is , , or , .

In Spain it is known as , or , amongst dozens of other local names. In French it is known as .

In classical antiquity, it was known in Aramaic as &quot;šabbārā&quot; (, ). In later Eastern Aramaic languages, it was also borrowed from the Middle Persian as &quot;spendā&quot;.

==Description==
===Habitus===
It is a perennial, herbaceous, , hemicryptophyte plant, which dies off in the winter, but regrows from the rootstock the following spring. It can grow to about tall, but normally it is about tall. The entire plant is hairless (glabrous). Plants are bad tasting and smell foul when crushed.

===Stems===
Numerous erect to spreading stems grow from the crown of the root-stock in the spring, these branch in a corymbose fashion.

===Roots===
The roots of the plant can reach a depth of up to , if the soil where it is growing is very dry. The roots can grow to thick.

===Leaves===
The leaves are alternate, sessile, and have bristly, long stipules at the base. The leaf blade is dissected/forked twice or more into three to five thin, linear to lanceolate-linear, greyish lobes. The forks are irregular. The lobes have smooth margins, are long and broad, and end in points.

===Flowers===
It blooms with solitary flowers opposite to the leaves on the apical parts of branches. It flowers between March and October in India, between April and October in Pakistan, between May and June in China, between March and April in Israel, and between May and July in Morocco. The flowers are white or yellowish white, and are about 2–3 cm in diameter. Greenish veins are visible in the petals. They have a threadlike, 1.2 cm long pedicel. The flowers have five (10-)12–15(−20)mm long, linear, pointy-ended, glabrous sepals, often divided into lobes, although sometimes entire and only divided at the end. There are five petals which are oblong-elliptic, obovate to oblong in shape, (10-)14–15(−20)mm long, (5-)6–8(−9)mm broad, and ending with an obtuse apex. The flowers are hermaphroditic, having both male and female organs. The flowers usually have 15 stamens (rarely fewer); these have a 4-5mm long filament with an enlarged base. The , 6mm long anthers are longer than the filaments. The ovary is superior, and has 3 locules and ends in an 8-10mm long style, the ending 6mm of which are triangular or 3-keeled in cross-section. The ovary is surrounded by a nectary which is glabrous and has five lobes in a regular pattern.

The flowers produce only a tiny amount of nectar. The nectar is rich in hexose sugars. It contains a relatively small concentration of amino acids among which there is an especially high amount of the glutamic acid, tyrosine and proline, the last of which can be tasted by, and is favoured by, many insects. It also contains (four) alkaloids, in relatively high concentration compared to the flowers of other species, among them the toxins harmalol and harmine. The proportions and concentrations of the alkaloids in the nectar are different than in the other organs of the plant, indicating an adaptive reason for their presence.

===Pollen===
&quot;P. harmala&quot; has smallish, tricolpate pollen grains with a rugulate-reticulate surface. The has a which is thicker than the . These grains are well distinguishable from pollen of related plants (&quot;Nitraria&quot;) in Pakistan.

===Fruit===
The plant fruits between July and November in China. The fruit is a dry, round seed capsule which measures about 6–10(−15) mm in diameter, These seed capsules have three chambers and carry more than 50 seeds. The end of the fruit is usually somewhat sunken inwards and retains a persistent style.
===Seeds===
The seeds are colored dark brown to blackish-brown, slightly curved, triangular, about long with a muriculate surface. The endosperm is oily.

===Cytology===
The cells have 24 chromosomes (2n), although sometimes 22 have been found.

==Distribution==
===Native===
&quot;Peganum harmala&quot; is native to a wide area stretching from Morocco in north Africa and Spain and Italy in Europe, north to Serbia, Romania (possibly), Dagestan, Kazakhstan, south to Mauritania (possibly), Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Pakistan In Zhob district, and east to western Mongolia, northern China and possibly Bangladesh. It is a common weed in Afghanistan, Iran, parts of Israel, eastern and central Anatolia (Turkey), and Morocco.

In Africa it is known from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt. It likely does not occur in Mauritania. In Morocco it is quite common and occurs throughout the country, excepting Western Sahara. In Algeria it is found mostly in the north bordering Morocco and Tunisia, being absent in the south and central regions. It is reasonably commonly found throughout Tunisia. In Libya it is found in the maritime zone, especially around Bengazi, and is not abundant. In Egypt it grows in the Sinai, has been recorded from the east of the Eastern Desert, and been rarely collected on the mid-west of the Mediterranean coast.

In Europe it is native to Spain, Corsica (disputed), much of Russia, Serbia, Moldova, Ukraine (especially in Crimea), Romania (possibly introduced), Bulgaria, Greece (including Crete and the Cyclades), Cyprus, Turkey (Thrace) and southern Italy (including Sardinia, but not Sicily). It also is native to the Caucasus: Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia. On the Iberian Peninsula it is absent from Portugal and Andorra, but it is not uncommon in Spain, especially in the southeast, the Ebro depression, and the inland valleys of the Duero and Tajo, but it is rare in Andalusia (south) and it does not occur on the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands, and in the west along the Portuguese border, Galicia, the northern coast, and the northern mountain ranges.

In Turkey it is found both in Thrace and across most of Anatolia, but is absent from the northern Black Sea coast. It is abundant in some regions of south and central Anatolia.

In Israel it is most commonly found around the Dead Sea, in the Judean mountains and desert, in the Negev and its surrounding areas, including areas in Jordan and Saudi Arabia, being rare or very rare in the northern mountains, Galilee, coastal areas and the Arava valley.

It grows in drier parts of the northern half of India but is possibly only native to the Kashmir and Ladakh regions. It also occurs in, and is possibly native to, Bangladesh.

The distribution in China is in dispute. The 2008 Flora of China considers it to be native to northern China in the provinces of Gansu, western Hebei, western Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Qinghai, northern Shanxi, Tibet and Xinjiang. The 2017 Species Catalogue of China considers it to be restricted to Inner Mongolia, Ningxia and Gansu.

===Adventive distribution===
It has been added to the lists of the Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species for the countries of South Africa, Mexico, France and Ukraine, although it is not reported as having a negative impact in any of these countries. Most Ukrainian and other references consider the plant native to Ukraine. Sources are in disagreement regarding rare collections in coastal Romania, but many consider it introduced. At least 7 occurrences have been registered in South Africa, and none in Mexico (as of 2017). As of 2020 it is included in South African National Biodiversity Institute&#x27;s &quot;Plants of Southern Africa&quot; website as an introduced plant to South Africa. One database has it occurring as a non-native in Hungary.

In France it is considered a former accidental introduction once uncommonly found on the Côte d&#x27;Azur along the Mediterranean coast. It has very rarely been found elsewhere in France in the past. According to the Flora Europaea there is a native population on Corsica, however, according to Tela Botanica it does not occur on the island, either as a native or not.

It was first planted in the United States in 1928 in New Mexico by a farmer wanting to manufacture a dye called &quot;Turkish red&quot; from its seeds. From here the plant spread over most of southern New Mexico and the Big Bend region of Texas. An additional spread has occurred from east of Los Angeles in California to the tip of southernmost Nevada. Outside of these regions the distribution in the US is not continuous and localised. As of 2019 it has been reported in southern Arizona (in at least 3 adjacent counties), northeastern Montana (2 adjacent counties), northern Nevada (Churchill county), Oregon (town of Prineville in the Oregon High Desert) and possibly Washington. &quot;Because it is so drought tolerant, African rue can displace the native saltbushes and grasses growing in the salt-desert shrub lands of the Western U.S.&quot;

Although the distribution in New Mexico and Texas would suggest it has spread to parts of northern Mexico, the species has not been included in the 2004 list of introduced plants of Mexico.

==Habitat and ecology==
It grows in dry areas in the United States. It can be considered a halophyte.

In Kashmir and Ladakh it is known from elevations of 300–2400 metres (1000&#x27; to 7900&#x27;), in China 400–3600 metres (1300&#x27; to 12,000&#x27;), in Turkey 0–1500 metres (0&#x27; to 5000&#x27;), and in Spain 0–1200 metres (0&#x27; to 4000&#x27;).

In China it grows in slightly saline sands near oases and dry grasslands in desert areas.

In Spain it can be found in abandoned fields, rubbish tips, stony slopes, along the verges of roads, ploughed and worked earth, as well as in disturbed, saline scrubland.

In Morocco it is said to grow in steppes, arid coasts, dry uncultivated fields and amongst ruins. A study in Morocco found that it could be used as an indicator species for rangeland degraded from agricultural activities, when found in association with certain &quot;Artemisia&quot; sp., &quot;Noaea mucronata&quot; and &quot;Anabasis aphylla&quot;. In Israel it is a common dominant plant along with &quot;Anabasis syriaca&quot; and &quot;Haloxylon scoparium&quot; in a low semi-shrubby steppe ecosystem which during dry years is almost devoid of plant cover, growing on saline, loess-derived soils. In rainy times &quot;Leontice leontopetalum&quot; and &quot;Ixiolirion tataricum&quot; appear here. It also grows in Israel in semi-steppe shrublands, Mediterranean woodlands and shrublands, and deserts. Between 800 and 1300 metres (2600&#x27; to 4300&#x27;) elevation on the sandstone slopes of the mountains around Petra, Jordan, there is an open Mediterranean steppe forest dominated by &quot;Juniperus phoenicea&quot; and &quot;Artemisia herba-alba&quot; together with occasional trees of &quot;Pistacia atlantica&quot; and &quot;Crataegus aronia&quot; with common shrubs being &quot;Thymelaea hirsuta&quot;, &quot;Ephedra campylopoda&quot;, &quot;Ononis natrix&quot;, &quot;Hammada salicornia&quot; and &quot;Anabasis articulata&quot;; when this habitat is further degraded (it is already degraded) by overgrazing &quot;P. harmala&quot; along with &quot;Noaea mucronata&quot; invade. It is often found with &quot;Euphorbia virgata&quot; in the foothills of Mount Ararat, Iğdır Province, Turkey.

The flowers are pollinated by insects. Little is known about pollen vectors. A year-long study around the town of St. Katherine in the El-Tur mountains of southern Sinai found &quot;P. harmala&quot; to be exclusively pollinated by the domesticated honey bee, &quot;Apis mellifera&quot;, although it is possible these animals are displacing native bees. The floral morphology, nectar amount and composition – high in hexane sugars, presence of toxic alkaloids and high proline content together suggest pollination by short-tongued bees (see pollination syndrome).

Regarding seed dispersal it is considered a . According to a Mongolian study, its seeds are exclusively dispersed by human activities, although &quot;Peganum multisectum&quot;, sometimes seen as a variety or synonym of this species, is dispersed solely by water flow.

A species of tiny, hairy beetle, &quot;Thamnurgus pegani&quot;, has been found inhabiting stems of &quot;P. harmala&quot; in Turkey and elsewhere. It feeds only on &quot;P. harmala&quot;. When the aerial parts of the plant begin to die off in the autumn, the adult beetles retreat to overwinter in the soil underneath the root-crown, or in old larval tunnels in the dead stems; emerging in the spring (May in Turkey), the females bore small holes in the now shooting stems of the plant, in which they lay their eggs. The hatched larvae bore inward toward the pith. The beetles somehow infect the surrounding tissue in the tunnels with a fungus, &quot;Fusarium oxysporum&quot;. The infected plant tissue turns blackish and is then used by the adult beetles and their larvae as a food source, until they are ready to pupate within the stem tunnels. It has been proposed as a candidate for using in biological control of &quot;P. harmala&quot;, as a relative of it, &quot;T. euphorbiae&quot;, has been approved for use against invasive &quot;Euphorbia&quot; in the United States.

==History==

As the plant is popular in Persian cultural traditions, and is a hallucinogen, the linguists David Flattery and Martin Schwartz wrote a book in 1989 in which they theorised that the plant is the Avestan &quot;haoma&quot; mentioned in Zoroastrianism. The transcribed word &quot;haoma&quot; is thought to be likely related to the Vedic word &quot;soma&quot;; these names refer to a magical, purportedly entheogenic plant/drink that is mentioned in ancient Indo-Iranian texts but whose exact identity has been lost to history.

This plant was first described in a recognisable manner under the name () by Dioscorides, who mentions it is called μῶλυ (&quot;moly&quot;) in parts of Anatolia (although Dioscorides distinguishes the &#x27;real&#x27; μῶλυ as another, bulbaceous plant). Galen later describes the plant under the name , following Dioscorides by mentioning numerous other names it was known by: , (harmala), and in Syria , (besasa). For much of the subsequent history of Europe Galen was seen as the pinnacle of human medical knowledge. As such, during the early Middle Ages, the herb was known as &quot;moly&quot; or .

The 12th century Arab agriculturist Ibn al-&#x27;Awwam from Seville, Spain, wrote that the seeds were used in the baking of bread; the fumes being used to facilitate fermentation and help with the taste (he usually quotes older authors).

By the mid-16th century, Dodoens relates how apothecaries sold the plant under the name &quot;harmel&quot; as a type of extra-strength rue.

Traces of &quot;Peganum harmala&quot;, and &quot;Nimphaea nouchali var. caerulea&quot; were identified in an Egyptian ritual Bes-vase, of the 2nd century BCE.

==Taxonomy==
Rembert Dodoens in 1553, illustrated and described the plant (republished 1583 with better illustration, calling it &quot;Harmala&quot;, and basing his work on Galen and Dioscorides).

In 1596, Gaspard Bauhin had his &quot;Phytopinax&quot; published in which he attempted to list all plants known in an ordered manner. He judges &quot;Ruta sylvestris Dioscorides&quot; to be a type of &quot;Hypericum&quot;. Later, in his &quot;Pinax Theatri Botanici&quot; of 1623, he attempts to sort the synonymy in all the previously published names by the botanists from earlier in history. In this work, he sorts &quot;Ruta&quot; into five species, distinguishing this plant from the others by its three-locular fruit, large white flowers and being only known as a wild plant (as opposed to cultivated). He considers his &#x27;Ruta sylvestris flore magno albo&#x27; (=&quot;Peganum harmala&quot;) to be (not all writers named in the following): Tabernaemontanus&#x27;, Dodoens&#x27; and Clusius&#x27; &quot;Harmala&quot;; Matthias de l&#x27;Obel&#x27;s &quot;Harmala syriaca&quot;; Andreas Cæsalpinus&#x27; and Conrad Gesner&#x27;s (in his report on Ottoman plants) &quot;Harmel&quot;; Pietro Andrea Mattioli&#x27;s and Clusius&#x27; (in another work) &quot;Ruta sylvestris Harmala&quot;; Valerius Cordus&#x27; (in his &quot;Annotations on Dioscorides&quot;), Gesner&#x27;s (in his &quot;Hortus&quot;), and Aloysius Anguillara&#x27;s &quot;Ruta sylvestris&quot;; and Castore Durante&#x27;s and Joachim Camerarius the Younger&#x27;s &quot;Ruta sylvestris secunda&quot;.

In 1753, Carl Linnaeus named the species &quot;Peganum harmala&quot;. He cites this species as based on Bauhin&#x27;s &quot;Pinax Theatri Botanici&quot; of 1623, and &quot;Stirpium Historiae Pemptades Sex&quot; of 1583 by Rembert Dodoens.

===Type===
In 1954, Brian Laurence Burtt and Patricia Lewis designated &#x27;Cult. in Horto Upsaliensi (Linn!)&#x27; as the lectotype for the species. This lectotype appeared to be two sheets (621.1 and 621.2) in the Linnean Herbarium, not being part of a single gathering, and hence ICBN Art. 9.15 (&quot;Vienna Code&quot;) did not apply. In 1993, Mohammed Nabil El Hadidi designated &#x27;Clifford Herbarium 206, &quot;Peganum&quot; no. 1&#x27;, stored at the British Museum of Natural History, as the lectotype for &quot;P. harmala&quot;.

===Infraspecific variability===
Peganum harmala&quot; var. &quot;garamantum – &quot;P. harmala&quot; var. &quot;garamantum&quot; was originally described by René Maire in 1953 in his &quot;Flore de l&#x27;Afrique du Nord&quot;. It was still recognised as occurring in Tunisia as of 2010 (along with var. &quot;typicum&quot;), although the distinction is not recognised in other works.

Peganum harmala&quot; var. &quot;grandiflorum – El Hadidi described &quot;P. harmala&quot; var. &quot;grandiflorum&quot; in 1972 for the Flora Iranica based on herbarium material collected by H. Bobek in Tal Shahdad in Kerman Province, Iran in 1956, and said the variety grew in both Iran and Afghanistan. It was subsequently collected only once more, at least as recorded in the GBIF, in 1980 in Spain near the bank of the Ebro river approximately halfway downriver to the sea from Zaragosa. It is not mentioned in the Flora Iberica.

Peganum harmala&quot; var. &quot;multisecta – First described by Karl Maximovich in 1889 from Qinghai. Sometimes incorrectly spelled var. &quot;multisectum&quot;. Occurs in Dzungaria, Hexi, Qaidam Basin, Ordos and the Altai regions in China and Mongolia. In China it occurs in the provinces of Inner Mongolia, northern Shanxi, Ningxia, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang and Tibet (the Flora of China claims it is endemic to China). It can be distinguished by having the sepals (called &#x27;calyx leaves&#x27; in one study) incised with 3–5 lobes, instead of being entire as in the nominate form (&quot;P. nigellastrum&quot;, which also occurs in the region, has this characteristic even more pronounced, but with the calyx leaves split into 5–7 thin string-like lobes), and by having leaves which are more dissected or may be trisected. The leaves are dissected to 3–5 lobes in the nominate form – the individual leaf lobes being 1.5–3 mm wide, whereas this variety always has more than 5 lobes 1–1.5 mm wide. The nominate form has seeds with a depressed surface, whereas var. &quot;multisecta&quot; has seeds with convex surface. Furthermore, the stems of this variety sprawl prostrate upon the ground, whereas the nominate has erect stems, and the variety has stems which are pubescent when young as opposed to always glabrous. Some consider it better to classify it as an independent species, &quot;P. multisectum&quot; (&quot;fide&quot; Bobrov, 1949). Others consider it a synonym of the nominate form.

Peganum harmala&quot; var. &quot;rothschildianum – Originally described by cactus specialist Franz Buxbaum in 1927 as &quot;P. rothschildianum&quot; from northern Africa. Subsumed as a variety by René Maire in 1953. Not recognised for Tunisia, nor elsewhere.

Peganum harmala&quot; var. &quot;stenophyllum – This variety is still accepted by some authorities, although it is not recognised in the Flora of Pakistan. Pierre Edmond Boissier described it in 1867 and it has been recognised as growing in Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Tajikistan, and the northern Caucasus. In India it is found in Kashmir, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka. It can be distinguished from the nominate form by having finer leaves with more narrow lobes, shorter sepals and broader-shaped seed capsules.

==Legal issues==
In the United States, it is considered an invasive, noxious weed in the following states: Arizona (prohibited noxious weed), California (A listed noxious weed), Colorado (A listed noxious weed), Nevada (noxious weed), New Mexico (class B noxious weed), and Oregon (A designated weed, under quarantine). This may require land owners to exterminate infestations on their land or be fined, and allows access to government grants to buy herbicides to do so. It is illegal to sell plants of this species in the states listed above. Since 2005, with caveats, the cultivation, possession or sale of this species is also illegal in Louisiana.

Since 2005, the possession of the seeds, the plant itself, and the alkaloids harmine and harmaline, which it contains, is illegal in France. In Finland, the plant is officially listed as a medicinal plant, which means one would require a doctors prescription to acquire it. In Canada, harmaline is illegal. In Australia, harmala alkaloids are illegal.

==Uses==
===Weed and livestock poisoning===
In some regions, it is a common weed. In China, it is seen as a noxious weed, invasive in overgrazed areas. In the United States, where it is not native, it is officially registered as a noxious weed or similar designation in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon. Infestations can be invasive and very difficult to exterminate. It is also known as an agricultural seed contaminant. It often causes livestock poisonings, especially during drought. Consumption by animals causes reduced fertility and abortions. Leaves and seeds are considered poisonous due to the β-carbolines such as: harmalol, harman harmaline, harmine, and quinazoline derivatives they contain. Side effects after ingestion can manifest themselves as hallucinations, neurosensory syndromes, bradycardia, nausea, vomiting.

Control is possible only with powerful herbicides. Manually uprooting the plants is near impossible and there are no methods of biological control currently awaiting approval. The rootstock contains starches that help the plant survive being defoliated and is thick and grows very deep, and the crown of the plant is safe below the surface.

===Dyes===
A red dye, &quot;Turkey red&quot;, from the seeds (but usually obtained from madder) is often used in western Asia to dye carpets. It is also used to dye wool. When the seeds are extracted with water, a yellow fluorescent dye is obtained. If they are extracted with alcohol, a red dye is obtained. The stems, roots and seeds can be used to make inks, stains and tattoos. According to one source, for a time the traditional Ottoman fez was dyed with the extract from this plant.

===Traditional medicine and superstitions===
In Iran and neighbouring countries such as Turkey and Azerbaijan, dried capsules from the plant are strung and hung in homes or vehicles to protect against the evil eye. It is widely used for protection against Djinn in Morocco (see Légey &quot;Essai de Folklore marocain&quot;, 1926).

Esfand (called in Kashmiri) is burnt in Kashmiri pandits (Kashmiri Brahmins) weddings to create an auspicious atmosphere. Burning esfand seeds is also common in Persian cultures for warding off the evil eye, as in Persian weddings.
In Yemen, the Jewish custom of old was to bleach wheaten flour on Passover, in order to produce a clean and white unleavened bread. This was done by spreading whole wheat kernels upon a floor, and then spreading stratified layers of African rue (&quot;Peganum harmala&quot;) leaves upon the wheat kernels; a layer of wheat followed by a layer of Wild rue, which process was repeated until all wheat had been covered over with the astringent leaves of this plant. The wheat was left in this state for a few days, until the outer kernels of the wheat were bleached by the astringent vapors emitted by the wild rue. Afterwards, the wheat was taken up and sifted, to rid them of the residue of leaves. They were then ground into flour, which left a clean and white batch of flour.
&quot;Peganum harmala&quot; has been used as an analgesic, emmenagogue, and abortifacient agent.

In a certain region of India, the root was applied to kill body lice.

It is also used as an anthelmintic (to expel parasitic worms). Reportedly, the ancient Greeks used the powdered seeds to get rid of tapeworms and to treat recurring fevers (possibly malaria).

As related in Des Cruydboeks of 1554 by Rembert Dodoens, in Europe, this plant was considered to be a wild type of rue and identical in medicinal uses -the identity of the two plants and their Ancient Greek and Roman uses had merged, though it was considered stronger, even dangerously so. It could be bought under the name &quot;harmel&quot; in the apothecaries, and was also known as &#x27;wild&#x27; or &#x27;mountain&#x27; rue. It could be used for a few dozen ailments, such as to treat woman of their natural disease when the leaves were used in only water, or when the juice were drunk with wine and the leaves pressed against the wound it could cure bites and stings from rabid dogs, scorpions, bees and wasps and the like. From supposedly Pliny, he relates how those covered in the sap, or having eaten it sober, would be immune to poison for a day, as well as to poisonous beasts. Other cures were for &#x27;drying&#x27; sperm, &#x27;purifying&#x27; woman after childbirth, curing earache, getting rid of spots and blemishes on the skin, and soothing bumps and pain caused by hitting something, among many others. All the cures call for either juice or the leaves; none call for the seeds.

===Entheogenic use===
&quot;Peganum harmala&quot; seeds have been used as a substitute for &quot;Banisteriopsis caapi&quot; in ayahuasca analogs, as they contain monoamine oxidase inhibitors that enable DMT to be orally active. It has also been used in Changa, a DMT-infused smoking blend.

==Alkaloids==

===Seed alkaloids===

Total harmala alkaloids were at least 5.9% of dried weight, in one study.

<text>The Report of the National Commission on Terrorism, also known as the Bremer Commission, &quot;Countering The Changing Threat of International Terrorism&quot;, Pursuant to Public Law 277, 105th Congress, was published June 2000. Ambassador Paul Bremer served as Chairman, and Maurice Sonnenberg served as Vice Chairman.

==Conclusions==
* International terrorism poses an increasingly dangerous and difficult threat to America.
* Countering the growing danger of the terrorist threat requires significantly stepping up U.S. efforts.
* Priority one is to prevent terrorist attacks. U.S. intelligence and law enforcement communities must use the full scope of their authority to collect intelligence regarding terrorist plans and methods.
* U.S. policies must firmly target all states that support terrorists.
* Private sources of financial and logistical support for terrorists must be subjected to the full force and sweep of U.S. and international laws.
* A terrorist attack involving a biological agent, deadly chemicals, or nuclear or radiological material, even if it succeeds only partially, could profoundly affect the entire nation. The government must do more to prepare for such an event.
* The President and Congress should reform the system for reviewing and funding departmental counterterrorism programs to ensure that the activities and programs of various agencies are part of a comprehensive plan.

The most controversial conclusions included the Report&#x27;s call &quot;for the monitoring of all foreign students, using criminals and terrorists as American spies, and making wiretapping easier&quot; (Lodal, 2001, p. 100).

The report clearly names state sponsors of terrorism including Iran and Syria. It specifically says this about Iran&#x27;s involvement:

The Department of State&#x27;s 1999 &quot;Patterns of Global Terrorism&quot; provides the following account of Iranian support for terrorism: 

* Iran&#x27;s security forces conducted several bombings against Iranian dissidents abroad.
* Iran has increasingly encouraged and supported—with money, training, and weapons—terrorist groups such as Hizballah, HAMAS, the PIJ, and Ahmed Jibril&#x27;s PFLP-GC.
* Iran continues to provide a safehaven to elements of PKK, a Kurdish militant group that has conducted numerous attacks in Turkey and against Turkish targets in Europe.
* Iran also provides support to terrorist groups in North Africa and South and Central Asia, including financial assistance and training.

It recommends name Afghanistan, under the Taliban, as a state sponsor:

&quot;Recommendation: 
* The Secretary of State should designate Afghanistan as a sponsor of terrorism and impose all the sanctions that apply to state sponsors. &quot;

<text>Herihor was an Egyptian army officer, vizier, and eventually a ruler of Upper Egypt as High Priest of Amun at Thebes (1080 BC to 1074 BC) during the reign of Pharaoh Ramesses XI.

==Chronological and genealogical position==
Traditionally his career was placed before that of the High Priest of Amun, Piankh, since it was believed that the latter was his son. However, this filiation was based on an incorrect reconstruction by Karl Richard Lepsius of a scene in the Temple of Khonsu. It is now believed that the partly preserved name of the son of Herihor depicted there was not , but rather .

Since then, Karl Jansen-Winkeln has argued that Piankh preceded rather than succeeded Herihor as High Priest at Thebes and that Herihor outlived Ramesses XI before being succeeded in this office by Pinedjem I, Piankh&#x27;s son. 
If Jansen-Winkeln is correct, Herihor would have served in office as High Priest, after succeeding Piankh, for longer than just 6 years, as is traditionally believed.

The following paragraphs contain several statements based on the traditional order (Herihor before Piankh) and therefore give only one possible reconstruction.

==Life==
While his origins are unknown, it is thought that his parents were Libyans. Jansen-Winkeln&#x27;s recent publication in &quot;Zeitschrift für ägyptische Sprache&quot; suggests that Piankh – originally thought to be Herihor&#x27;s successor – was actually Herihor&#x27;s predecessor.

Herihor advanced through the ranks of the military during the reign of Ramesses XI. His wife Nodjmet, may have been Ramesses XI&#x27;s daughter—and perhaps even Piankh&#x27;s wife if Piankh was his predecessor as Jansen-Winkeln today hypothesizes. At the decoration of the hypostyle hall walls of the temple of Khonsu at Karnak, Herihor served several years under king Ramesses XI since he is shown obediently performing his duties as chief priest under this sovereign. But he assumed more and more titles, from high priest to vizier, before finally openly taking the royal title at Thebes, even if he still nominally recognised the authority of Ramesses XI, the actual king of Egypt. It is disputed today whether or not this &#x27;royal phase&#x27; of Herihor&#x27;s career began during or after Ramesses XI&#x27;s lifetime.

Herihor never really held power outside the environs of Thebes, and Ramesses XI may have outlived him by two years although Jansen-Winkeln argues that Ramesses XI actually died first and only then did Herihor finally assume some form of royal status at Thebes and openly adopted royal titles—but only in a &quot;half-hearted&quot; manner according to Arno Egberts who has adopted Jansen-Winkeln&#x27;s views here. Herihor&#x27;s usurpation of royal privileges is observed &quot;in the decoration of the court of the Khonsu temple&quot; but his royal datelines &quot;betray nothing of the royal status he enjoyed according to the contemporary scenes and inscriptions of the court of the Khonsu temple.&quot; While both Herihor and his wife Nodjmet were given royal cartouches in inscriptions on their funerary equipment, their &#x27;kingship&#x27; was limited to a few relatively restricted areas of Thebes whereas Ramesses XI&#x27;s name was still recorded in official administrative documents throughout the country. During the Wehem Mesut era, the Theban high priest—Herihor—and Ramesses XI quietly agreed to accept the new political situation where the High Priest was unofficially as powerful as Pharaoh. The report of Wenamun (also known as Wen-Amon) was made in Year 5 of Herihor and Herihor is mentioned in several Year 5 and Year 6 mummy linen graffiti.

The de facto split between Ramesses XI and his 21st Dynasty successors with the High Priests of Amun at Thebes (referred to in Ancient Egyptian as Wehem Mesut or &#x27;Renaissance&#x27;) resulted in the unofficial political division of Egypt between Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt, with the kings ruling Lower Egypt from Tanis. This division did not come to a complete end until the accession of the Libyan Dynasty 22 king Shoshenq I in 943 BC. Shoshenq was able to appoint his son Iuput to be the new High Priest of Amun at Thebes, thus exercising authority over all of ancient Egypt.

==Herihor and the Nodjmet problem==
It is beyond doubt that Herihor had a wife called Nodjmet. She has been attested in the Temple of Khonsu where she is depicted at the head of a procession of children of Herihor, and on Stela Leiden V 65, where she is depicted with Herihor, presented as High Priest without royal overtones, so apparently dating from quite early in his career.
Normally, she is identified with the mummy of a Nodjmet which was discovered in the Deir el-Bahari cache (TT320). With this mummy two Books of the Dead were found.
One of these, Papyrus BM 10490, now in the British museum, belonged to &quot;the King’s Mother Nodjmet, the daughter of the King’s Mother Hrere&quot;. Whereas the name of Nodjmet was written in a cartouche, the name of Hrere was not. Since mostly this Nodjmet is seen as the wife of the High Priest Herihor, Herere’s title is often interpreted as &quot;King’s Mother-in-law&quot;, although her title &quot;who bore the Strong Bull&quot; suggests that she actually must have given birth to a king.

==Ethiopian tradition==
The 1922 regnal list of Ethiopia names Herihor, and his successors through Psusennes III, as part of the Semitic Ag&#x27;azyan Ethiopian dynasty, and he is considered to have ruled Ethiopia for 16 years in addition to being &quot;de facto&quot; ruler in Egypt. This regnal list dated Herihor&#x27;s reign to 1156-1140 BC, with dates following the Ethiopian Calendar. According to Ethiopian historian Tekletsadiq Mekuria, Herihor&#x27;s father was the former High Priest Amenhotep, and his mother was a daughter of Ramesses IV.

<text>The Smith Richardson Foundation is a private foundation based in Westport, Connecticut that supports policy research in the realms of foreign and domestic public policy.

According to the foundation&#x27;s website, its mission is &quot;to contribute to important public debates and to address serious public policy challenges facing the United States. The Foundation seeks to help ensure the vitality of our social, economic, and governmental institutions. It also seeks to assist with the development of effective policies to compete internationally and to advance U.S. interests and values abroad.&quot;

==History==
The Smith Richardson Foundation was established in 1935 by H. Smith Richardson Sr. and his wife Grace Jones Richardson. Richardson transformed the Vicks Chemical Company, a firm created by his father, Lunsford Richardson, into one of the leading over-the-counter drug companies in the world. In later years, Richardson-Vicks also became a major force in the market for prescription drugs as well as a wide range of consumer products. In 1985, the Richardson family sold the company to Procter &amp; Gamble.

In 1973, R. Randolph Richardson assumed the presidency of the Foundation. Richardson was particularly interested in supporting free-market and pro-democratic causes. During his tenure as president, the Foundation played an important role in supporting think tanks and scholars who were active in public policy debates over issues such as defense policy, tax policy, education reform, and regulation. The Foundation also supported pro-democracy organizations in Central and Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, and Central and South America.

In 1992, Peter L. Richardson, a nephew of R. Randolph Richardson, assumed the presidency of the Foundation, while Heather Higgins, the daughter of R. Randolph Richardson, became president of the Randolph Foundation.

==Assets and grant making==
At the end of 2013, the foundation had assets totaling $521,570,780 according to its federal tax return. During that year, it awarded a total of 411 grants totaling $20,695,903 .

<doc id="913881" wikidata="Q1477118" url="?curid=913881" title="Operation Starlite">
<text>Operation Starlite (also known in Vietnam as Battle of Van Tuong) was the first major offensive action conducted by a purely U.S. military unit during the Vietnam War from 18 to 24 August 1965. The operation was launched based on intelligence provided by Major general Nguyen Chanh Thi, the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) I Corps commander. III Marine Amphibious Force (III MAF) commander Lieutenant General Lewis W. Walt devised a plan to launch a pre-emptive strike against the Viet Cong (VC) 1st Regiment to nullify their threat to the vital Chu Lai Air Base and Base Area and ensure that its powerful communication tower remained intact.

The operation was conducted as a combined arms assault involving ground, air and naval units. U.S. Marines were deployed by helicopter insertion while an amphibious landing was used to deploy other Marines. The VC used a variety of tactics to counter the Marine assault, fighting from prepared positions and then withdrawing as the Marines gained local superiority and ambushing a lost supply column. The VC were unable to withstand the weight of the Marine assault and U.S. firepower.

==Background==
The United States had been providing material support to South Vietnam since its foundation in 1954. The Vietnam War effectively began with the start of the North Vietnamese backed VC insurgency in 1959/60 and the U.S. increased its military aid and advisory support to South Vietnam in response. With the worsening military and political situation in South Vietnam, the U.S. increasingly became directly involved in the conflict. U.S. Marines were the first ground troops deployed to South Vietnam, landing at Da Nang on 8 March 1965. In May the Marines and ARVN forces secured the Chu Lai area to establish a jet-capable airfield and base area.

On 30 July, COMUSMACV General William Westmoreland told III MAF commander General Walt that he expected him to undertake larger offensive operations with the South Vietnamese against the VC at greater distances from his base areas. Walt reminded Westmoreland that the Marines were still bound by the 6 May Letter of Instruction that restricted III MAF to reserve/reaction missions in support of South Vietnamese units heavily engaged with a VC force. Westmoreland replied &quot;these restraints were no longer realistic, and invited Walt to rewrite the instructions, working into them the authority he thought he needed, and promised his approval.&quot; On 6 August, General Walt received official permission to take the offensive against the VC. With the arrival of the 7th Marine Regiment a week later, he prepared to move against the 1st VC Regiment.

In early July, the 1st VC Regiment had launched a second attack against the hamlet of Ba Gia, south of Chu Lai. The ARVN garrison was overrun, causing 130 casualties and the loss of more than 200 weapons, including two 105 mm howitzers. After the attack on Ba Gia, US intelligence agencies located the 1st VC Regiment in the mountains west of the hamlet. Reports indicated that the regiment was once more on the march. Acting on this intelligence, the 4th Marine Regiment conducted a one-battalion operation with the ARVN 51st Regiment, 1st Division in search of the 1st VC Regiment south of the Trà Bồng River. Codenamed Thunderbolt, the operation lasted from 6 to 7 August, and extended 7 km south of the river in an area west of Route 1. The ARVN and Marines found little sign of any major VC force in the area and encountered only scattered resistance.

Eight days after Thunderbolt, the Allies finally confirmed the location of the 1st VC Regiment. On 15 August, a deserter from the regiment surrendered to the ARVN. During his interrogation at General Thi&#x27;s headquarters he revealed that the regiment had established its base in the Van Tuong village complex on the coast, south of Chu Lai and planned to attack Chu Lai. The prisoner told his interrogators that the 1st VC Regiment at Van Tuong consisted of two of its three battalions, the 60th and 80th, reinforced by the 52nd Company and a company from the 45th Weapons Battalion; approximately 1,500 men in all. Thi, who personally questioned the prisoner and believed the man was telling the truth, relayed the information to Walt. At about the same time, the III MAF intelligence section received corroborative information from another source. Convinced of the danger to the airfield, Walt&#x27;s subordinates advised a spoiling attack in the Van Tuong region. Walt flew to Chu Lai and held a hurried council of war with his senior commanders there: Brigadier general Frederick J. Karch, who had become the Chu Lai Coordinator on 5 August, Colonel McClanahan of the 4th Marines and Colonel Oscar F. Peatross, the newly arrived 7th Marines&#x27; commander. Walt then decided to proceed with an operation.

==Planning==
In a hectic two-day period, the III MAF, division, wing and 7th Marines staffs assembled forces and prepared plans for the attack. The concept for the operation dictated a two-battalion assault, one battalion to land across the beach and the other to land by helicopter further inland. The division reassigned two battalions previously under the operational control of the 4th Marines to Peatross as the assault battalions, Lieutenant Colonel Joseph R. Fisher&#x27;s 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines and Lieutenant Colonel Joseph E. Muir&#x27;s 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines. Walt, who wanted a third battalion as a floating reserve, requested permission to use the Shore Landing Force (SLF) which Admiral U. S. Grant Sharp Jr. approved immediately. At the time of the request the amphibious task force was located at Subic Bay Naval Base, away. Based upon its transit time to the operational area, the planners selected 18 August as D-Day. The operation was originally called Satellite, but a power blackout led to a clerk working by candlelight typing &quot;Starlite&quot; instead.

In order to maintain the secrecy of the operation, none of the ARVN Joint General Staff were informed about the operation until after it had started. Only Generals Thi and ARVN 2nd Division commander General Hoàng Xuân Lãm had advance knowledge of the operation in order to keep ARVN forces out of the operational area.

Peatross and his commanders conducted an aerial surveillance of the area and selected the amphibious assault landing site, as well as the helicopter landing zones (LZs). They chose the beach north of the coastal hamlet of An Cuong, later designated Green Beach, for the landing. A force there would block VC avenues of escape to the south. Three LZs, Red, White and Blue, were selected east of Route 1 and roughly inland from the coast. LZ Blue, about 2 km west of Green Beach, was the southernmost of the LZs. White was 2 km west northwest of Blue, while Red was 2 km north of White. From these positions, the Marines were to move northeast to the South China Sea.

On the morning of the 17th the plans were completed. 3/3 Marines was to land across Green Beach at 06:30, 18 August with Companies I and K abreast, K on the right. Company L, the battalion reserve, was to follow as the lead companies swerved to the northwest. The remaining company, Company M, was to make an overland movement from Chu Lai to a ridgeline blocking position in the northern portion of the operations area, northwest of Green Beach and inland from the sea, closing off the VCs&#x27; retreat. Soon after H-Hour, UH-34s from HMM-261 and HMM-361 were to shuttle the 2/4th Marines into the three LZs. The two battalions were to join forces when Company H from LZ Blue linked up with Company I outside the hamlet of An Cuong, 1.8 km inland from Green Beach. From there, the Marines were to sweep to the sea through the Van Tuong village complex and over the Phuoc Thuan Peninsula. Artillery batteries at Chu Lai were to provide artillery support while two United States Navy destroyers, the and the and the cruiser were available for naval gunfire support. Aircraft from Marine Aircraft Group 11 and Marine Aircraft Group 12 were to fly close support for the operation.

==Battle==

At 10:00 on the 17th, Company M, 3/3 Marines boarded LVTP-5s at Chu Lai and moved along the coast to the Trung Phan Peninsula; then the company marched south where it established its blocking position. The Marines of Company M met only minor resistance, an occasional sniper and booby traps. Before dawn on the 18th, the company reached its objective and dug in. Marine patrols had been active in this area for some time and to the casual observer the company&#x27;s activity was just another small unit movement. At 17:00 on 17 August, the rest of 3/3rd Marines, with Colonel Peatross and his staff, embarked on the three ships of the amphibious task group, , and . Three M67 flame thrower tanks attached to the 7th Marines and a platoon of five M48 tanks assigned to Fisher&#x27;s battalion boarded two LCUs, which then sailed independently towards the amphibious objective area, timing their arrival to coincide with that of the troop transports. The task force first sailed east to deceive any VC in sampans in the coastal waters. Once over the horizon, the ships changed course to the southwest, arriving in the amphibious objective area shortly after 05:00. There they were joined by the &quot;Galveston&quot; and the &quot;Orleck&quot;, which were to cover the landing.

At 06:15, 15 minutes before H-Hour, Battery K, 4th Battalion, 12th Marines, which had displaced to firing positions on the northern bank of the Trà Bồng River the night before, began 155 mm preparation fires of the helicopter landing zones. The artillery was soon reinforced by 20 Marine A-4s and F-4s which dropped 18 tons of bombs and napalm on the LZs. The Marines limited their preparation of Green Beach to 20mm cannon strafing runs by MAG-12 A-4s, because of the proximity of An Cuong to the landing site. As the air and artillery fires lifted, the ground forces arrived, Companies I and K, in LVTP-5s, landed across Green Beach at 06:30 and pushed inland according to plan. The troops quickly spread out and moved into An Cuong. After a futile search for VC, the company continued advancing to the west. Company K received sniper fire from its right as it crossed the northern portion of Green Beach. Two platoons quickly moved northward and the VC fire ceased. The third platoon secured the northern half of An Cuong. Fifteen minutes after H-Hour, Company G, 2/4th Marines landed at LZ Red. Company F and the command group landed at LZ White and Company H arrived at LZ Blue 45 minutes later. On the beach, Muir, who had moved his command post ashore, was joined at 07:30 by Peatross and his staff. Tanks and M50 Ontos rolled off the LCUs and landing craft mechanized (LCMs) and made their way forward to support the assault companies. Company L came ashore and established perimeter security for the supply area at the beach. Most of the Marine companies met only light resistance as they moved into the attack. Company G searched two hamlets in the vicinity of LZ Red and then advanced to the northeast and linked up with Company M without incident. At LZ White Company E encountered stiffer opposition from the VC. The VC manned firing positions on a ridgeline east and northeast of the LZ, employing mortars, machine guns, and small arms. After dogged fighting, the Marines cleared the hills. By midmorning, Company E began moving northeast. At one juncture, the Marines spotted about 100 VC in the open and asked for artillery fire. The 107mm Mortar (Howtar) Battery, 3rd Battalion, 12th Marines, helilifted into the position held by Company M, shelled the VC force killing an estimated 90 VC. Company E continued to push forward, finding only occasional opposition.

Along the coast, Company K had advanced to Phase Line Banana, 2 km north of Green Beach. There a VC force, entrenched on a hill overlooking the Marine positions, blocked the advance of the company. Muir, who had established his forward command post with Company K, ordered Company L forward. By midafternoon, the two Marine companies, aided by supporting arms, captured the high ground and set up night defenses. The major action developed in the south near LZ Blue, at the junction of 2/4th Marines and 3/3rd Marines. This area, roughly one square kilometer, was bound by the hamlets of An Thoi on the north, Nam Yen on the south and An Cuong to the east. It was a patchwork of rice paddies, streams, hedgerows, woods and built-up areas, interspersed by trails leading in all directions. Two small knolls dominated the flat terrain, Hill 43, a few hundred meters southwest of Nam Yen, and Hill 30, 400 meters north of An Cuong. LZ Blue was just south of Nam Yen, between Hill 43 and the hamlet. Company H&#x27;s LZ was almost on top of the VC 60th Battalion. The VC allowed the first helicopters to touch down with little interference, but then opened fire as the others came in. Three U.S. Army UH-1B gunships from the 7th Airlift Platoon, took the VC on Hill 43 under fire while Company H formed a defensive perimeter around the LZ. The Company H commander, First Lieutenant Homer K. Jenkins, was not yet aware of the size of the VC force. He ordered one platoon to take the hill and the rest of the company to secure Nam Yen, both attacks soon stalled. The platoon attacking Hill 43 was still at the bottom of the hill when Jenkins called back his other two platoons from the outskirts of Nam Yen in order to regroup. He requested air strikes against both the VC hill position and Nam Yen and then renewed the attack, but this time, Jenkins moved all three of his platoons into the assault on the hill. The VC fought tenaciously, but the Marines, reinforced by close air support and tanks, were too strong. One Marine platoon counted six dead VC near a heavy machine gun position and more bodies scattered throughout the brush. Jenkins&#x27; men took one prisoner and collected over 40 weapons.

The airstrikes called by Jenkins against VC positions at Nam Yen momentarily halted the advance of Company I, 3/3rd Marines at a streambed east of Nam Yen. Bomb fragments slightly wounded two Marines. After the bombing run, Company I moved north along the stream for 500 meters to a point opposite An Cuong. Under fire from An Cuong, An Thoi and Nam Yen, Captain Bruce D. Webb, the company commander, requested permission to attack An Cuong, although it was across the bank in the area of responsibility of the 2/4th Marines. Muir approved the request, after consulting with Peatross. An Cuong was a fortified hamlet, ideally suited to VC combat tactics. The area surrounding the hamlet was heavily wooded with severely restricted fields of fire. The only open areas were the rice paddies and even these were interspersed with hedgerows of hardwood and bamboo thickets. An Cuong itself consisted of 25-30 huts, with fighting holes and camouflaged trench lines connected by a system of interlocking tunnels. As the company cleared the first few huts, a grenade exploded, killing Webb and wounding three other Marines. No sooner had the grenade exploded, than two 60mm mortar rounds fell on the advancing troops, inflicting three more casualties. First Lieutenant Richard M. Purnell, the company executive officer, assumed command and committed the reserve platoon. The company gained the upper hand and the action slackened as the troops secured the hamlet. Making a hurried survey of the battlefield, Purnell counted 50 VC bodies. He then radioed his battalion commander for further instructions. Muir ordered Purnell&#x27;s company to join Company K, which was heavily engaged at Phase Line Banana, 2 km to the northeast. Company H remained near Nam Yen to clean out all VC opposition there and then planned to link up with Muir&#x27;s battalion. While Company I maneuvered through An Cuong Peatross committed one company of his reserve battalion to the battle. Company I, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines on were landed by HMM-163 helicopters shortly after 09:30.

As Company I was preparing to move from An Cuong, a UH-1E gunship from VMO-2 was shot down by VC small arms fire northeast of the hamlet. Muir ordered Purnell to leave some men behind to protect the helicopter. Purnell ordered two squads and three tanks to stay with the helicopter until the craft was evacuated. As the company departed, its members could see that Jenkins&#x27; Company H had left Hill 43 and was advancing on the left flank of Company I. At 11:00 Jenkins led his unit, augmented by five tanks and three Ontos, from the Hill 43 area into the open rice paddy between Nam Yen and An Cuong. Jenkins bypassed Nam Yen as he mistakenly believed that Company I had cleared both hamlets. Suddenly, from positions in Nam Yen and from Hill 30, the VC opened up with small arms and machine gun fire, catching the Marine rearguard in a crossfire. Then mortar shells began bursting upon the lead platoons. Company H was taking fire from all directions, and tracked vehicles, Ontos and tanks, were having trouble with the muck of the paddies. Jenkins drew his armor into a tight circle and deployed his infantry. One squad moved to the northwest of Nam Yen and killed nine VC who were manning a mortar, but were driven off by small arms fire and had to withdraw to the relative security of the tanks. Jenkins saw that his position was untenable, and after radioing for supporting arms, he ordered his force to withdraw to LZ Blue. Artillery hit Nam Yen while F-4s and A-4s attacked Hill 30. About 14:00, the company tried to move back to the LZ. The lead platoon was forced to alter course when medical evacuation helicopters tried to land in the midst of the unit. As it maneuvered off to the flank of Company H, this platoon became separated from Jenkins&#x27; main body and was engaged by the VC. At this juncture, the platoon unexpectedly linked up with Purnell&#x27;s helicopter security detail which had started to move toward its parent company after the downed helicopter had been repaired and flown out. The small force was quickly engaged by a VC unit, but together the two Marine units fought their way to An Cuong. Meanwhile, Jenkins and his other two platoons fought a delaying action and withdrew to LZ Blue, arriving there at 16:30. Fisher directed Jenkins to establish a defensive perimeter and await reinforcements.

The expected reinforcements never arrived; they had been diverted to help a supply column that had been ambushed 400m west of An Cuong. Just before noon, Muir had ordered his executive officer in charge of the 3/3rd Marines rear command group, Major Andrew G. Comer, to dispatch the mobile (LVT) resupply to Company I, which, at the time, was only a &quot;few hundred yards&quot; in front of the command group. Five LVTP-5s and three flame tanks, the only tactical support available at the time, were briefed on the location of the company and marked the routes they were to follow on their maps. The supply column left the command post (CP) shortly after noon, but got lost between Nam Yen and An Thoi. It had followed a trail that was flanked on one side by a rice paddy and on the other by trees and hedgerows. As the two lead vehicles, a tank and an LVTP, went around a bend in the road, an explosion occurred near the tank, followed by another in the middle of the column. Fire from VC recoilless rifles and a barrage of mortar rounds tore into the column. The vehicles backed off the road and turned their weapons to face the VC. Using all of their weapons the troops held off the closing VC infantry. The rear tank tried to use its flamethrower, but a VC shell had rendered it useless. Throughout the fighting, the convoy was still able to maintain communications with the command post, radioing that the column was surrounded by VC and was about to be overrun. The LVT radio operator kept the microphone button depressed the entire time and pleaded for help. The command post was unable to quiet him sufficiently to gain essential information as to their location. This continued for an extended period, perhaps an hour. Informed of the ambush Muir replied that he was returning Company I to the rear CP and ordered Comer to gather whatever other support they could and to rescue them as rapidly as possible. Peatross, well aware of the vulnerable positions of both Company H and the supply column and fearing that the VC was attempting to drive a salient between the two battalions approved a rescue mission. The plan was to use a rapidly moving tank, LVTP and Ontos column through the previously cleared An Cuong area. Before the planning meeting broke up, one of the flame tanks which had been in the supply column arrived at the CP, the crew chief, a staff sergeant, reported that they had just passed through An Cuong without being fired upon and that he could lead them to the supply column.

Shortly after 13:00, Comer&#x27;s force moved out. Just after cresting Hill 30, the M-48 tank was hit by recoilless rifle fire and stopped short. The other vehicles immediately jammed together and simultaneously mortar and small arms fire saturated the area. Within a few minutes, the Marines suffered five dead and 17 wounded. The infantry quickly dismounted and the Ontos maneuvered to provide frontal fire and to protect the flanks while artillery fire and air support was called in. With the response of supporting arms, the VC fire diminished and Company I was ordered to resume its advance toward An Cuong leaving a small rear guard on Hill 30 to supervise the evacuation of the casualties. The company entered An Cuong against little resistance, but Comer&#x27;s command group were caught by intense fire from a wooded area to their right front and forced to take what cover they could in the open rice paddies. At the same time, the Marines came upon the two reinforced squads from Company I which had been left to guard the downed Huey and the platoon from Company H. The two squads from Company I fought their way to Hill 30 where they were evacuated while the Company H platoon remained in the rice paddies.

As the intensity of the battle increased, Peatross ordered a halt to the advance of the units from LZs Red and White and along the coast to prevent the overextension of his lines. Company L, 3/7th Marines arrived at the regimental CP at 17:30 and was placed under the operational control of Muir, who ordered them to reinforce Company I in the search for the supply column. Supported by two tanks, Company L moved out. As they advanced through the open rice paddies east of An Cuong, they came under heavy fire, wounding 14 and killing four. The Marines persevered and the VC broke contact as night fell. The addition of a third Marine company to the area, coupled with the weight of supporting arms fire available, evidently forced the VC 60th Battalion to break contact. The Marines radioed the &quot;Galveston&quot; and &quot;Orleck&quot; requesting continuous illumination throughout the evening over the Nam Yen-An Cuong area. As darkness fell, Peatross informed Walt that the VC apparently intended to defend selected positions, while not concentrating their forces. Muir decided that it was too risky to continue searching for the supply column that night, especially after having learned that the column, although immobilized, was no longer in danger. Muir ordered Company L to move to Phase Line Banana and join Companies K and L, and establish a perimeter defense there. He also ordered Company I to return to the regimental CP. For all intents and purposes, the fighting was over for Company I; of its 177 men who had crossed the beach, 14 were dead, including the company commander, and another 53 were wounded, but the company claimed 125 VC killed.

During the night of 18 August, Peatross brought the rest of the SLF battalion ashore. Company I, 3/7th Marines arrived at the regimental CP at 18:00, followed shortly by Lieutenant Colonel Charles R. Bodley and his command group. Just after midnight, Company M landed across Green Beach from the . With the arrival of his third battalion, Peatross completed his plans for the next day. The concept of action remained basically the same, squeeze the vice around the VC and drive them toward the sea. As a result of the first day&#x27;s action against the VC 60th Battalion, he readjusted the battalions&#x27; boundaries. At 07:30, Muir&#x27;s 3/3rd Marines, with Companies K and L abreast and Company L, 3/7th Marines following in reserve, was to attack to the northeast from Phase Line Banana. Simultaneously, Fisher&#x27;s 2/4th Marines, with Companies E and G, was to drive eastward to the sea, joining 3/3rd Marines. Jenkins&#x27; Company H, Comer&#x27;s group, and Company I were to withdraw to the regimental CP. The remainder of 3/7th Marines was to fill the gap. Companies I and M were to move out of the regimental CP, extract the ambushed supply column, and then move toward An Thoi to establish a blocking position there which would prevent the VC from slipping southward. Company M, 3/3rd Marines was to hold its blocking positions further north. The VC were to be left no avenue of escape.

On the 19th, 3/7th Marines moved into its zone of action which included the area of the fiercest fighting of the day before, but the VC were gone. At 09:00, Companies I and M left the regimental CP, and moved through An Cuong, meeting no VC resistance. They brought out the supply column and by 15:00 had established their assigned blocking position at An Thoi. Although much of the VC resistance had disappeared, Fisher and Muir still found pockets of stiff opposition when they launched their combined attacks at 07:30. The terrain was very difficult as the rice paddies, ringed by dikes and hedgerows, hindered control, observation and maneuverability. The VC were holed up in bunkers, trenches, and caves which were scattered throughout the area. Marines would sweep through an area, only to have VC snipers fire upon them from the rear. In many cases, the Marines had to dig out the VC or blow up the tunnels. By 10:30, Company E had linked up with Company K and the two battalions continued their advance to the sea. By nightfall, the 2/4th Marines had completed its sweep of the Phuoc Thuan Peninsula. VC organized resistance had ceased.

==Aftermath==
Although the cordon phase of Starlite had been completed, Walt decided to continue the operation for five more days so that the entire area could be searched systematically. He believed that some of the VC had remained behind in underground hiding places. 2/4th Marines and 3/3rd Marines returned to Chu Lai on the 20th and 1st Battalion, 7th Marines moved into the objective area and joined 3/7th Marines and units from the ARVN 2nd Division for the search. The Marines killed 54 more VC in the Van Tuong complex before Starlite came to an end on 24 August. The Marines had killed 614 VC by body count, taken nine prisoners, held 42 suspects and collected 109 assorted weapons, at a cost of 45 Marines dead and 203 wounded. Corporal Robert E. O&#x27;Malley (3/3 Marines) and Lance Corporal Joe C. Paul (2/4 Marines) received the Medal of Honor for their actions during the operation; Muir was awarded the Navy Cross for his actions during the operation. Purnell (3/3 Marines) received the Silver Star for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action. To the Americans, the battle was considered a great success for U.S. forces as they had engaged a local force VC unit and come out victorious.

The VC also claimed victory, announcing that they had inflicted 900 American casualties (killed and wounded), destroyed 22 tanks and APCs and downed 13 helicopters, while suffering ~200 casualties before withdrawing. According to Lê Duẩn, the VC suffering 50 killed in this battle

The ambush of the Marine supply column was reported by journalist Peter Arnett and proved an embarrassment to the Johnson administration, who wanted to retain the secrecy of the operation. The story of the ambush of the Marine supply column was denied by the USMC.

Lessons learned from the battle included the knowledge that the daily allotment of of water per man was inadequate in the heat of Vietnam.

<text>Lue Gim Gong (; August 24, 1857 – June 3, 1925) was a Chinese-American horticulturalist. Known as &quot;The Citrus Wizard&quot;, he is remembered for his contribution to the orange-growing industry in Florida.

==Life==
Born in Taishan, Guangdong, Qing dynasty China to a family of farmers, Lue Gim Gong was interested in the United States and the opportunities that lay across the Pacific Ocean. After his uncle returned from America when Lue was 15, young Lue pleaded with his parents to let him return with his uncle to America. His parents agreed, giving him a bolt of silk to sell when he arrived. He lived in a heavily Chinese-populated area in San Francisco until the age of 16 when he moved to North Adams, Massachusetts, to work at a shoe factory.

At the factory, Lue met Fanny Burlingame, who taught his Sunday School class. When she learned of his skill with plants, she asked him to live with the Burlingames is known to tend their garden. She converted him to Christianity, and helped him become a United States citizen on October 4, 1887.

Lue had been advised to move to a warmer climate due to his recent contraction of tuberculosis. He visited China in 1886. Upon his return, Fannie recommended relocation to DeLand, Florida, where she and her sister owned land. Lue agreed, and in 1885, he was working once again, this time in orange groves. 

When Ransom Eli Olds, one of the pioneers of the American automotive industry purchased 37,500 acres of land for development at the end of 1916, he hired Lue Gim Gong, who was already 60 years old at the time, to plan for the farms. Mr. Olds was very pleased with Lue&#x27;s work and named one of the roads on the farm Gim Gong Road in 1918. It is now within Oldsmar, Florida, and connects to Tampa Road.

He died in DeLand on June 3, 1925.

==Legacy==
* Lue had learned some pollination techniques from his mother in China, with which he was able to develop an apple which ripened a month earlier than other varieties, and a tomato plant that grew in clusters. In Florida, he learned to cross-pollinate citrus by watching bees. He developed a cold-tolerant grapefruit that was slower to drop, and grapefruits that grew singularly, rather than in clumps, on the branch, as well as an aromatic variety. 
* &quot;Wooden Fish Songs&quot;, by Ruthanne Lum McCunn, is a historical novel based on Lue&#x27;s life.
* In 1888, Lue cross-pollinated the &quot;Harts late&quot; Valencia and &quot;Mediterranean Sweet&quot; orange varieties, which produced a fruit both sweet and frost-tolerant. Originally considered a hybrid, the &quot;Lue Gim Gong&quot; orange was later found to be a nucellar seedling of the &quot;Valencia&quot; variety, which is properly called the &quot;&#x27;Lue Gim Gong Strain&quot;. Distributed by Glen St. Mary Nurseries, the variety was awarded the Silver Wilder Medal by the American Pomological Society in 1911, the first such award for citrus fruit.
* The &quot;Lue Gim Gong&quot; variety is still grown in Florida as of 2006, but is sold under the general name &quot;Valencia&quot;.
* Cigar City Brewing in Tampa Florida has dedicated a citrus-forward pale ale to his legacy, appropriately named Lue Gim Gong.
* Lue&#x27;s influence was also felt in his native land China. His name appears in &#x27;The Scientific Database of China Plant Species&#x27;. &quot;In the 1940s, the summer-time citrus types such as &quot;Valencia&quot; or &quot;Lue Gim Gong&quot; variety was imported into China. Based on these imported varieties, several new species were developed such as the &quot;Guixia&quot; orange which is widely cultivated in Guangxi Province, and &quot;Wuyuehong&quot; orange, in Jiangjin City of Sichuan Province&quot;.
*In 2000, Lue was recognized as a “Great Floridian” by the Florida Department of State for his significant contributions to the sunshine state.
* In 1994, Gim Gong Road in Oldsmar, Florida, was renamed &quot;Commercial Boulevard&quot; under the pressure of a developer. Mr. Jerry Beverland was a dissenting city council member at the time of this name change. He ran and won the election and became the Mayor of Oldsmar City six years later. He tried to change the name of the road back. However, after consulting with the legal counsel and realizing that it was already part of the business agreement. He then decided to rename another road Gim Gong Road instead. April 9, 2022, several local and national Chinese American community organizations, including the Chinese Cultural Center of Florida, the Tampa Bay Chinese School, Tampa Chinese Association, New York Foundation of Chinese History in the United States, the American Chinese United Association, National Council of Chinese Americans- NCCA, and Utah Chinese Golden Spike Association presented an award plaque to Mayor Jerry Beverland, and also jointly made a donation to the local Historic Society.
* In May 2024, Lue’s life was featured in a Spectrum Ch. 13 news story.

<doc id="913887" wikidata="Q4064" url="?curid=913887" title="Ramesses V">
<text>Usermaatre Sekheperenre Ramesses V (also written Ramses and Rameses) was the fourth pharaoh of the Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt and was the son of Ramesses IV and Duatentopet. His mummy is now on display at the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.

==Reign==
Ramesses V&#x27;s reign was characterized by the continued growth of the power of the priesthood of Amun, which controlled much of the temple land in the country and the state finances, at the expense of the ruling pharaohs. The Turin 1887 papyrus records a financial scandal during Ramesses&#x27; reign that involved the priests of Elephantine. 

===Year 1===
A period of domestic instability also afflicted his reign, as evidenced by the fact that, according to the Turin Papyrus Cat. 2044, the workmen of Deir el-Medina periodically stopped work on Ramesses V&#x27;s KV9 tomb in this king&#x27;s first regnal year, out of fear of &quot;&quot;the enemy&quot;, presumably Libyan raiding parties, who had reached the town of Per-Nebyt and &quot;burnt its people&quot;.&quot; Another incursion by these raiders into Thebes is recorded a few days later. This shows that the Egyptian state was having difficulties ensuring the security of its own elite tomb workers, let alone the general populace, during this troubled time.

===Year 4===
The Wilbour Papyrus, believed to date to Year 4 of Ramesses V&#x27;s reign, was a major land survey and tax assessment document which covered various lands &quot;extending from near Crocodilopolis (Medinet el-Fayyum) southwards to a little short of the modern town of El-Minya, a distance of some 90 miles.&quot; It reveals most of Egypt&#x27;s land was controlled by the Amun temples, which also directed the country&#x27;s finances. The document highlights the increasing power of the High Priest of Amun Ramessesnakht whose son, a certain Usimare&#x27;nakhte, held the office of chief tax master.

==Death==
The circumstances of Ramesses V&#x27;s death are unknown but it is known he had a reign of almost four full years. He died in his 4th Regnal Year around the time interval between the first and second month of Peret.

===Burial===
An ostracon records that this king was only buried in Year 2 of Ramesses VI, his successor, which was highly irregular since Egyptian tradition required a king to be mummified and buried precisely 70 days into the reign of his successor. 

However, another reason for the much delayed burial of Ramesses V in Year 2, second month of Akhet day 1 of Ramesses VI&#x27;s reign (see KRI, VI, 343) may have been connected with Ramesses VI&#x27;s need &quot;to clear out any Libyans [invaders] from Thebes and to provide a temporary tomb for Ramesses V until plans for a double burial within tomb KV9 could be put into effect.&quot; Moreover, a Theban work journal (&quot;P. Turin&quot; 1923) dated to Year 2 of Ramesses VI&#x27;s reign shows that a period of normality had returned to the Theban West Bank by this time.

===Mummy===
The mummy of Ramesses V was recovered in 1898 by Victor Loret in KV35. It was unwrapped and examined by G.E. Smith in 1905, and showed a body full of disease. Smith described him as a young man, Ikram and Dodson suggest he died in his early thirties.

====Smallpox====
One theory is that he may have suffered and subsequently died from smallpox (VARV), due to lesions found on his face. If true, he is thought to be one of the earliest known victims of the disease.
While a 2016 discovery has found that the shared ancestral form of modern smallpox dates back to 1580 AD, this study merely indicates that the strains of smallpox circulating at the time of smallpox eradication had a common ancestor in the late 16th century, specifically that &quot;the VARV lineages eradicated during the 20th century had only been in existence for ~200 years, at a time of rapidly expanding human movement and population size in the face of increasingly widespread inoculation and vaccination.&quot; Indeed, they say merely about ancient cases of smallpox that &quot;if they were indeed due to smallpox, these early cases were caused by virus lineages that were no longer circulating at the point of eradication in the 1970s.&quot; The advent of vaccination, or variolation in China and Japan during the middle ages, could have altered the relative presence of smallpox strains and diminished the presence of ancient strains.

A 2015 review summarizing recent research into the question of smallpox evolution and divergence from its common ancestors suggests it is most likely that smallpox evolved 3000–4000 years ago in East Africa or India, which is not inherently contradicted by the study described the latter of which contains descriptions of smallpox from before the first century AD at least. Finally, another genomic analysis places the evolution of smallpox at 16,000 years before present, and mentions Ramses V: &quot;if the pustular eruption of Ramses V was from smallpox, it could represent a smallpox outbreak from imported cases... rather than regional endemic disease. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that only three mummies in that period had similar lesions.&quot;

====Bubonic Plague====
Another theory is bubons in his groin, usually associated with the bubonic plague.

<text>Germany competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s fourth consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics after its reunification in 1990. The German Olympic Sports Confederation (, &quot;DOSB&quot;) sent the nation&#x27;s second largest delegation to the Games since its reunification. A total of 441 athletes, 250 men and 191 women, competed in 27 sports, and were nominated by DOSB at four occasions.

==Equestrian==

Germany has qualified a spot for the team each in dressage, eventing, and show jumping. Eventing rider Bettina Hoy originally claimed a gold medal for herself and the German team, but three countries filed an appeal on the FEI Ground Jury, that overturned the judges&#x27; decision to nullify her original results. Therefore, the German eventing team finished outside the medals in fourth place, and Hoy claimed a ninth spot overall in the official results. Meanwhile, show jumper Ludger Beerbaum and his horse Goldfever helped the Germans claim a gold medal in the team event, but Goldfever tested positive for the prohibited substance betamethasone. As a result, Beerbaum was disqualified from the tournament, and instead, his teammates Christian Ahlmann, Otto Becker, and Marco Kutscher dropped their leading position for the bronze, even without Goldfever&#x27;s results.

<text>[[Russia]] competed at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s third consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics as an independent nation. The Russian Olympic Committee sent a total of 446 athletes to the Games, 244 men and 202 women, to compete in all sports, except baseball, field hockey, football, and softball.

Russia left Athens with a total of 90 Olympic medals – 28 golds, 26 silver, and 36 bronze – finishing second only to the United States in the overall medal standings, and third in the gold medal tally. The Russian delegation proved particularly successful in several sports, winning a total of nineteen medals in athletics, ten each in shooting and wrestling, seven in gymnastics and weightlifting, six in boxing, and five in cycling and judo. From the twenty-four sports played by the athletes, twelve of them won more than a single Olympic medal. Russian athletes dominated in rhythmic gymnastics and synchronized swimming, where they won gold medals in every event. Among Russia&#x27;s team-based athletes, the indoor volleyball teams, along with men&#x27;s handball and water polo and women&#x27;s basketball, claimed Olympic medals in their respective tournaments.

Among the nation&#x27;s medalists were synchronized swimming pair Anastasia Davydova and Anastasiya Yermakova, who both won gold in the women&#x27;s duet and team routines, pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva, who later emerged as Russia&#x27;s most promising track star in the decade, and Greco-Roman wrestler Khasan Baroev, who sought revenge for Russia on Aleksandr Karelin&#x27;s defeat from Sydney to take home the super heavyweight title. Five-time Olympian Andrey Lavrov helped the men&#x27;s handball team beat the Hungarians on his quest for the bronze medal and fourth medal overall in his fifth and final Olympic appearance.

As of 2021, this is Russia&#x27;s best ever result in terms of overall medals and second-best result in terms of gold medals (after 2000).

<doc id="913926" wikidata="Q237201" url="?curid=913926" title="Adrienne Lecouvreur">
<text>Adrienne Lecouvreur (5 April 1692 – 20 March 1730), born Adrienne Couvreur, was a French actress, considered by many as the greatest of her time. Born in Damery, she first appeared professionally on the stage in Lille. After her Paris debut at the Comédie-Française in 1717, she was immensely popular with the public. Together with Michel Baron, she was credited for having developed a more natural, less stylized, type of acting.

Despite the fame she gained as an actress and her innovations in her acting style, she was widely remembered for her romance with Maurice de Saxe and for her mysterious death. Although there are different theories that suggest she was poisoned by her rival, the Duchess of Bouillon, scholars have not been able to confirm it.

Her story was used as an inspiration for playwrights, composers and poets. The refusal of the Catholic Church to give her a Christian burial moved her friend Voltaire to write a poem on the subject.

==Life==
===Early years===
Adrienne Lecouvreur was born on 5 April 1692, in the village of Damery in the province of Champagne. Her father, Robert Couvreur, was a hat maker who, in the hope of more lucrative opportunities, moved with his family to Paris. After the death of his wife, Marie Couvreur, Mr. Couvreur started frequenting taverns, leaving young Adrienne and her sister Marie Marguerite to fend for themselves.

Young Adrienne found her own refuge watching rehearsals in the Comedie Francaise, and joining the rehearsals of a young, clandestine theater troupe that met in the back store of a grocer&#x27;s shop on the rue Férou. The company premiered at the house of Madame de Gue, wife of a president of &quot;Parlement&quot;. They played Corneille&#x27;s &quot;Polyeucte&quot;, with Adrienne Lecouvreur playing the role of Pauline. Marc-Antoine Legrand, a &quot;sociétaire&quot; of the Comédie-Française, was present at this performance, and, impressed by her skills, took her as his pupil. Legrand also advised her to add the nobiliary particle &quot;le&quot; to her name.

===Lunéville===
At age 14, Adrienne was already on tour. Her first public performances as a professional actress took place in Lille, where Mademoiselle Fonpré, who had been appointed director of the theatre, was taken aback by Lecouvreur&#x27;s potential. Shortly after her début, she started getting roles playing tragic queens and princesses. Her next engagements after Lille were in Lunéville, the capital of the Duchy of Lorraine. During this period, she had a daughter, Elisabeth-Adrienne, whose father was Philippe Le Roy, an officer who served the Duke Leopold of Lorraine. She was also engaged to a man referred in her writings as &quot;Baron D.&quot;, but he died in an accident before they could marry.

===Strasbourg===

Shortly after Baron D&#x27;s death, Adrienne Lecouvreur left Luneville, signing a contract with another theatre under the protection of the Duke of Lorraine; the theatre at Strasbourg.

It was a time of great success for her. In Strasbourg, she met the young Count François de Klinglin, son of the city&#x27;s chief magistrate. After months of visiting her, they announced their engagement, but one year into their commitment, Adrienne was expecting a second child. The shame of this impending wedding made the magistrate threaten his son with disinheritance, to which he gave in, calling off the engagement and agreeing to a new one, arranged by his family.

In Strasbourg, Lecouvreur earned a considerable income. However, while she was relying on Baron D. and subsequently Klinglin&#x27;s income beside her own, she incurred serious debt. Her engagements as an actress required her to pay for her own wardrobe and jewelry, and actresses of Adrienne&#x27;s status were subject to high expectations in their adornment. Humiliated after Klinglin&#x27;s arranged marriage, and with two children to support, Adrienne could no longer sustain herself in Strasbourg.

In 1716, at age 24, she left for Paris, and in 1717 she received a letter from the first gentleman of the King&#x27;s chamber, requesting her to join the Comédie-Française. The letter read:
&quot;We, Steward and Controller General of the King&#x27;s silverplate, pleasures, and business of the King&#x27;s Chamber, order His Majesty&#x27;s Players (in accordance with the order of Monseigneur the Duc d&#x27;Aumont, Peer of France and First Gentleman of the Chamber) to invite Mademoiselle Lecouvreur, immediately after the seasonal opening of their theatre, to perform in a play of her own choosing, in order to judge of any talent she may have for the theatre. Done in Paris this 27th day of March, 1717.&quot;

===Paris===
Adrienne Lecouvreur chose Prosper Jolyot de Crébillon&#x27;s &quot;Electre&quot; and Molière&#x27;s &quot;George Dandin&quot; in the role of Angélique. 
She made a surprising first appearance on stage. She wore a simple, white satin Grecian robe; not a heavily elaborated gown as was usual back then — nor did she wear a heavy headdress, and her acting style was devoid of the typical artificial gestures of that time&#x27;s declamatory style.

In her first year (1717) she played Corneille and Racine (in particular the roles of Pulchérie in
&quot;Heraclius&quot;, Monime, and Iphigénie), and Zenobia in Crébillon&#x27;s play. In 1718 she played Aristie in Corneille&#x27;s
&quot;Sertorius&quot; and Atalide in &quot;Bajazet&quot;. In total she gave 139 performances that season; an outstanding number for a beginner, and the most she would give throughout her career.

==Acting style==

Adrienne Lecouvreur was one of the first actresses who favored a more natural, realistic and less declamatory style. She and actor Michel Baron sought for a style that was based on everyday speech, as opposed to the predominant &quot;chantante&quot; style of the time. The playwright Pierre-François Godard de Beauchamps wrote on a letter to Mademoiselle Lecouvreur “Finally the true triumphs and the tragic furor give way, on the Stage, to the tender, the emotionally moving. You have made us know and feel the beauty of simplicity and its treasures.” Charles Collé mentions the direct connection that Adrienne Lecouvreur created between the audience and the role itself: “She develops all the details of a role and makes us forget the actress. We see nothing but the character she represents.”

Lecouvreur took this search for a more natural style into another aspect of her work, her wardrobe. Regardless of the era in which a play had been written, it was customary for actresses to wear elaborate dresses that reflected the fashion of the time, and sophisticated plumed headdresses. Lecouvreur, however, made her first appearance at the Comedie Francaise wearing a simple Greek tunic in white satin to play Crebillon’s &quot;Electre&quot;.

==Legacy==

Her life became the inspiration for a tragic 1849 drama &quot;Adrienne Lecouvreur&quot; by Scribe and Legouvé on which Francesco Cilea&#x27;s opera &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur&quot; and the operetta &quot;Adrienne&quot; (1926) by Walter Goetze are based. Before them, however, in 1856, Edoardo Vera premiered his &quot;dramma lirico&quot; &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur e la duchessa di Bouillon&quot;. In 1913 Sarah Bernhardt played her in the silent movie &quot;Adrienne Lecouvreur&quot;. In 1928, MGM Studios filmed &quot;Dream of Love&quot;, based on the Scribe and Legouvé play, &quot;Adrienne Lecouvreur&quot;, starring Joan Crawford and Nils Asther. At least six further films were made based on her life including &quot;Adrienne Lecouvreur&quot; (1938).

<text>Indonesia competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s twelfth appearance at the Olympics, excluding the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, and the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow because of the United States boycott. Krisna Bayu was originally the flag bearer, however the role was later done by Christian Hadinata because Bayu was suffering from flu at the eve of opening ceremony.

<text>The Mac NC, or Macintosh NC, is a prototype networked thin client from Apple, expected for release by April 1998. The device was widely promoted by then-Apple director Larry Ellison, apparently as part of his Oracle Network Computer initiative. Mac NC was canceled, and its key technology components were inherited by the iMac G3, which was released in August 1998.

==History==
On May 21, 1996, Oracle Corporation, along with 30 hardware and software vendors, announced an intent to design computers around the &quot;network computer platform&quot;. Products based on the Network Computer Reference Profile include diskless nodes, applications coded in cross-platform languages such as Java, and Internet connectivity using common software such as Netscape Navigator. 

In May 1996, Apple partnered in the network computing effort, with the Pippin as its flagship. 

On July 9, 1997, Gil Amelio was removed as CEO of Apple by its board of directors. Steve Jobs became interim CEO, to begin a critical restructuring of the company&#x27;s product line. He became CEO until August 2011, shortly before his death.

Oracle Corporation CEO and Apple board member Larry Ellison announced in December 1997, while talking to the Harvard Computer Society, that Apple would release a product called the Macintosh NC in April 1998. He suggested the network computer would have a &quot;near-300 MHz&quot; processor, a 17-inch screen, a price under , and a hard disk drive option at $100. 

Steve Jobs did not agree, stating via email, &quot;Unfortunately, [Ellison] is pretty far off base [...] Maybe he is trying to deflect interest from what we are really doing.&quot; While at Oracle, Ellison had overseen the development of a business alliance that produced several Network Computer-branded devices from companies such as Sun and IBM. Apple never manufactured any devices under the Oracle alliance, but did endorse the Network Computer Reference Profile. 

Jobs had already stopped all Macintosh clone efforts, including the Pippin concept and any prospects of the Mac NC.

Ultimately the technology shipped as NetBoot with the release of Mac OS X Server 1.0 in January 1999.

<text>In optics and photography, hyperfocal distance is a distance from a lens beyond which all objects can be brought into an &quot;acceptable&quot; focus. As the hyperfocal distance is the focus distance giving the maximum depth of field, it is the most desirable distance to set the focus of a fixed-focus camera. The hyperfocal distance is entirely dependent upon what level of sharpness is considered to be acceptable.

The hyperfocal distance has a property called &quot;consecutive depths of field&quot;, where a lens focused at an object whose distance from the lens is at the hyperfocal distance will hold a depth of field from to infinity, if the lens is focused to , the depth of field will be from to ; if the lens is then focused to , the depth of field will be from to , etc.

Thomas Sutton and George Dawson first wrote about hyperfocal distance (or &quot;focal range&quot;) in 1867. Louis Derr in 1906 may have been the first to derive a formula for hyperfocal distance. Rudolf Kingslake wrote in 1951 about the two methods of measuring hyperfocal distance.

Some cameras have their hyperfocal distance marked on the focus dial. For example, on the Minox LX focusing dial there is a red dot between and infinity; when the lens is set at the red dot, that is, focused at the hyperfocal distance, the depth of field stretches from to infinity. Some lenses have markings indicating the hyperfocal range for specific f-stops, also called a &quot;depth-of-field scale&quot;.

== Two methods ==
There are two common methods of defining and measuring &quot;hyperfocal distance&quot;, leading to values that differ only slightly. The distinction between the two meanings is rarely made, since they have almost identical values. The value computed according to the first definition exceeds that from the second by just one focal length.

; Definition 1
: The hyperfocal distance is the closest distance at which a lens can be focused while keeping objects at infinity acceptably sharp. When the lens is focused at this distance, all objects at distances from half of the hyperfocal distance out to infinity will be acceptably sharp.
; Definition 2
: The hyperfocal distance is the distance beyond which all objects are acceptably sharp, for a lens focused at infinity.

==Acceptable sharpness==
The hyperfocal distance is entirely dependent upon what level of sharpness is considered to be acceptable. The criterion for the desired acceptable sharpness is specified through the circle of confusion (CoC) diameter limit. This criterion is the largest acceptable spot size diameter that an infinitesimal point is allowed to spread out to on the imaging medium (film, digital sensor, etc.).

==Formula==
For the first definition,

formula_1

where

* is the hyperfocal distance;
* is the focal length of the lens;
* is f-number ( for aperture diameter ); and
* is the circle of confusion limit.

For any practical f-number, the added focal length is insignificant in comparison with the first term, so that

formula_2

This formula is exact for the second definition, if is measured from a thin lens, or from the front principal plane of a complex lens; it is also exact for the first definition if is measured from a point that is one focal length in front of the front principal plane. For practical purposes, there is little difference between the first and second definitions.

===Derivation using geometric optics===
The following derivations refer to the accompanying figures. For clarity, half the aperture and circle of confusion are indicated.

====Definition 1====
An object at distance forms a sharp image at distance (blue line). Here, objects at infinity have images with a circle of confusion indicated by the brown ellipse where the upper red ray through the focal point intersects the blue line.

First using similar triangles hatched in green,
formula_3

Then using similar triangles dotted in purple,
formula_4

as found above.

====Definition 2====
Objects at infinity form sharp images at the focal length (blue line). Here, an object at forms an image with a circle of confusion indicated by the brown ellipse where the lower red ray converging to its sharp image intersects the blue line.

Using similar triangles shaded in yellow,
formula_5

==Example==
As an example, for a lens at using a circle of confusion of , which is a value typically used in photography, the hyperfocal distance according to &quot;Definition 1&quot; is

formula_6

If the lens is focused at a distance of , then everything from half that distance () to infinity will be acceptably sharp in our photograph. With the formula for the &quot;Definition 2&quot;, the result is , a difference of 0.5%.

== Consecutive depths of field ==
The hyperfocal distance has a curious property: while a lens focused at will hold a depth of field from to infinity, if the lens is focused to , the depth of field will extend from to ; if the lens is then focused to , the depth of field will extend from to . This continues on through all successive neighboring terms in the harmonic series () values of the hyperfocal distance. That is, focusing at will cause the depth of field to extend from to .

C. Welborne Piper calls this phenomenon &quot;consecutive depths of field&quot; and shows how to test the idea easily. This is also among the earliest of publications to use the word &quot;hyperfocal&quot;.

==History==
The concepts of the two definitions of hyperfocal distance have a long history, tied up with the terminology for depth of field, depth of focus, circle of confusion, etc. Here are some selected early quotations and interpretations on the topic.

===Sutton and Dawson 1867===
Thomas Sutton and George Dawson define &quot;focal range&quot; for what we now call &quot;hyperfocal distance&quot;:

Their focal range is about 1000 times their aperture diameter, so it makes sense as a hyperfocal distance with CoC value of , or image format diagonal times 1/1000 assuming the lens is a &quot;normal&quot; lens. What is not clear, however, is whether the focal range they cite was computed, or empirical.

===Abney 1881===
Sir William de Wivelesley Abney says:

That is, is the reciprocal of what we now call the f-number, and the answer is evidently in meters. His 0.41 should obviously be 0.40. Based on his formulae, and on the notion that the &quot;aperture ratio&quot; should be kept fixed in comparisons across formats, Abney says:

===Taylor 1892===
John Traill Taylor recalls this word formula for a sort of hyperfocal distance:

This formula implies a stricter CoC criterion than we typically use today.

===Hodges 1895===
John Hodges discusses depth of field without formulas but with some of these relationships:

This &quot;mathematically&quot; observed relationship implies that he had a formula at hand, and a parameterization with the f-number or &quot;intensity ratio&quot; in it. To get an inverse-square relation to focal length, you have to assume that the CoC limit is fixed and the aperture diameter scales with the focal length, giving a constant f-number.

===Piper 1901===
C. Welborne Piper may be the first to have published a clear distinction between &quot;Depth of Field&quot; in the modern sense and &quot;Depth of Definition&quot; in the focal plane, and implies that &quot;Depth of Focus&quot; and &quot;Depth of Distance&quot; are sometimes used for the former (in modern usage, &quot;Depth of Focus&quot; is usually reserved for the latter). He uses the term &quot;Depth Constant&quot; for , and measures it from the front principal focus (i. e., he counts one focal length less than the distance from the lens to get the simpler formula), and even introduces the modern term:

It is unclear what distinction he means. Adjacent to Table I in his appendix, he further notes:

At this point we do not have evidence of the term &quot;hyperfocal&quot; before Piper, nor the hyphenated &quot;hyper-focal&quot; which he also used, but he obviously did not claim to coin this descriptor himself.

===Derr 1906===
Louis Derr may be the first to clearly specify the first definition, which is considered to be the strictly correct one in modern times, and to derive the formula corresponding to it. Using for hyperfocal distance, for aperture diameter, for the diameter that a circle of confusion shall not exceed, and for focal length, he derives:

formula_7

As the aperture diameter, is the ratio of the focal length to the numerical aperture (); and the diameter of the circle of confusion, , this gives the equation for the first definition above.

formula_8

===Johnson 1909===
George Lindsay Johnson uses the term &quot;Depth of Field&quot; for what Abney called &quot;Depth of Focus,&quot; and &quot;Depth of Focus&quot; in the modern sense (possibly for the first time), as the allowable distance error in the focal plane. His definitions include hyperfocal distance:

His drawing makes it clear that his is the radius of the circle of confusion. He has clearly anticipated the need to tie it to format size or enlargement, but has not given a general scheme for choosing it.

Johnson&#x27;s use of &quot;former&quot; and &quot;latter&quot; seem to be swapped; perhaps &quot;former&quot; was here meant to refer to the immediately preceding section title &quot;Depth of Focus&quot;, and &quot;latter&quot; to the current section title &quot;Depth of Field&quot;. Except for an obvious factor-of-2 error in using the ratio of stop diameter to CoC radius, this definition is the same as Abney&#x27;s hyperfocal distance.

===Others, early twentieth century===
The term &quot;hyperfocal distance&quot; also appears in Cassell&#x27;s &quot;Cyclopaedia&quot; of 1911, &quot;The Sinclair Handbook of Photography&quot; of 1913, and Bayley&#x27;s &quot;The Complete Photographer&quot; of 1914.

===Kingslake 1951===
Rudolf Kingslake is explicit about the two meanings:

Kingslake uses the simplest formulae for DOF near and far distances, which has the effect of making the two different definitions of hyperfocal distance give identical values.

<doc id="913946" wikidata="Q718690" url="?curid=913946" title="John Ledyard">
<text>John Ledyard (November 1751 – 10 January 1789) was an American explorer and adventurer.

==Early life==
Ledyard was born in Groton, Connecticut, in November 1751. He was the first child of Abigail Youngs Ledyard and Capt. John Ledyard Jr, son of Squire John Ledyard Sr. A day or so after the child was born, Capt. John boarded his father&#x27;s ship and sailed for the West Indies. Three years later Ledyard joined his grandfather in Hartford, Connecticut, where he attended school. His grandfather died just before Ledyard turned 20 (Squire Ledyard died in September 1771; grandson John III was about three months shy of 21 years of age at the Squire&#x27;s death).

Ledyard briefly attended Dartmouth College (which was then only 3 years old), arriving on 22 April 1772. 
He left for two months without permission in August and September of that year, led a mid-winter camping expedition, and finally abandoned the college for good in May 1773. 
Memorably, he fashioned his own dugout canoe, and paddled it for a week down the Connecticut River to his grandfather&#x27;s farm. Today, the Ledyard Canoe Club, a division of the Dartmouth Outing Club, sponsors an annual canoe trip down the Connecticut River in his honor. 
At loose ends, he decided to travel; &quot;I allot myself a seven-year&#x27;s ramble more,&quot; he wrote to a cousin. He shipped as a common seaman on a year-long trading voyage to Gibraltar, the Barbary Coast, and the Caribbean. 
On his next voyage, he jumped ship in Portsmouth, England, but was soon impressed and forced to join the British Navy as a marine.

== Captain Cook&#x27;s third voyage ==
In June 1776, Ledyard joined Captain James Cook&#x27;s third and final voyage as a British marine.
The expedition lasted until October 1780.
During these four years, its two ships stopped at the Sandwich Islands, the Cape of Good Hope, the Prince Edward Islands off South Africa, the Kerguelen Islands, Tasmania, New Zealand, the Cook Islands, Tonga, Tahiti, and then Hawaii (first documented by the expedition). It continued to the northwest coast of North America, making Ledyard perhaps the first U.S. citizen to touch its western coast, along the Aleutian islands and Alaska into the Bering Sea, and back to Hawaii where Cook was killed.
He attempted to climb from Kealakekua Bay to Mokuaweoweo, the summit of Mauna Loa, but had to turn back. 
The return voyage touched upon Kamchatka, Macau, Batavia (now Jakarta), around the Cape of Good Hope again, and back to England.

Still a marine in the British Navy, Ledyard was sent to Canada to fight in the American Revolution.
Instead he deserted, returned to Dartmouth, and began to write his &quot;Journal of Captain Cook&#x27;s Last Voyage&quot;.
It was published in 1783, five years after he had visited Hawaii, and was the first work to be protected by copyright in the United States. (It was in fact protected by Connecticut state copyright by special act of the legislature; federal copyright was not introduced until 1790.) Today, this work is annotated in rare-book bibliographies as the first travelogue describing Hawaii ever to be published in America.

== Fur trade ==
As Ledyard had noticed that sea otter furs from the American northwest commanded extremely high prices in Macau, he lobbied during the early 1780s for the formation of fur-trading companies. Ledyard suggested trading furs for Chinese silk and porcelain, which could then be sold in the United States. Although his partnership with Philadelphia financier Robert Morris was not successful, it did lay the pattern of the subsequent China trade.

Ledyard left the United States in June 1784 to find financial backers in Europe. In Paris he partnered with John Paul Jones; however this venture, too, failed to reach fruition.

== Overland around the world ==
In Paris, Ledyard conceived a remarkably bold scheme of exploration with encouragement from Thomas Jefferson, then American ambassador, and with financial backing from the Marquis de Lafayette, botanist Joseph Banks, and John Adams&#x27; son-in-law, William Smith. Jefferson suggested that Ledyard explore the American continent by proceeding overland through Russia, crossing at the Bering Strait, and heading south through Alaska and then across the American West to Virginia. 

Ledyard left London in December 1786, and made it most of the way across Russia.
He left St. Petersburg in June 1787 to travel through Moscow, Ekaterinburg, Omsk, Tomsk, Irkutsk, and Kirensk, reaching Yakutsk after 11 weeks. 
Here he stopped for the winter but then returned to Irkutsk to join a larger expedition led by Joseph Billings (of the Cook voyage).
However, Ledyard was arrested under orders from Empress Catherine the Great in February 1788, returned to Moscow by approximately his original route, then deported to Poland.

== African expedition ==
Back in London, Ledyard came across the African Association, then recruiting explorers for Africa. 
Ledyard proposed an expedition from the Red Sea to the Atlantic.
He arrived in Alexandria in August 1788, but the expedition was slow to start.
Late in November 1788, Ledyard accidentally poisoned himself with vitriolic acid (sulfuric acid) and died in Cairo, Egypt on 10 January 1789.
John Ledyard was buried in the sand dunes lining the Nile in a modestly marked grave, the location of which is unknown today.

== Legacy ==
In addition to Dartmouth&#x27;s Ledyard Canoe Club, in the Spring of 2002, two Dartmouth juniors, Peter Bohler and Peter Brewitt, repeated Ledyard&#x27;s journey. They traveled over 2,000 miles from Stockholm to St. Petersburg through Sweden, Finland, and Russia, following an old Swedish mail route called the Norrstigen along the coast.

<text>Bernardino Ramazzini (; 4 October 1633 – 5 November 1714) was an Italian physician.

Ramazzini, along with Francesco Torti, was an early proponent of the use of cinchona bark (from which quinine is derived) in the treatment of malaria. His most important contribution to medicine was his book on occupational diseases, &quot;De Morbis Artificum Diatriba&quot; (&quot;Diseases of Workers&quot;).

==Life==
Ramazzini was born in Carpi on 4 October 1633 according to his birth certificate. He studied medicine at the University of Parma, where his interest in occupational diseases began.

==Career==
He was appointed to the chair of theory of medicine at University of Modena in 1682 then served as professor of medicine at the University of Padua from 1700 until his death. He is often called &quot;the father of occupational medicine&quot; 

The first edition of &quot;De Morbis&quot; was published in 1700 in Modena, the second in 1713 in Padua.

===Occupational medicine===

His book on occupational diseases, &quot;De Morbis Artificum Diatriba&quot; (&quot;Diseases of Workers&quot;) outlined the health hazards of chemicals, dust, metals, repetitive or violent motions, odd postures, and other disease-causative agents encountered by workers in more than fifty occupations. This was one of the founding and seminal works of occupational medicine and played a substantial role in its development.
He proposed that physicians should extend the list of questions that Hippocrates recommended they ask their patients by adding, &quot;What is your occupation?&quot;.

Ramazzini saw prevention as being better than cure. In his Oratio given in 1711, he suggested that &quot;it is much better to prevent than to cure, and so much easier to foresee future harm and avoid it rather than have to get rid of it after having fallen prey&quot;.

===Malaria===
In regards to malaria, Ramazzini was one of the first to support the use of the quinine-rich bark cinchona. Many falsely claimed that quinine was toxic and ineffective, but Ramazzini recognized its importance. He is quoted, &quot;It [quinine] did for medicine what gun powder did for war.&quot;

===Cancer===
In 1713, Bernardino Ramazzini said that nuns developed breast cancer at a higher rate than married women, because they did not engage in sexual intercourse, and the &quot;unnatural&quot; lack of sexual activity caused instability of the breast tissues that sometimes developed into breast cancer.

==Death==
Ramazzini died in Padua on 5 November 1714.

==Acknowledgement==
In a lifestyle article &quot;Sitting can lead to an early death&quot;, the writer acknowledged Ramazzini&#x27;s pioneering study of this field in the 17th century.

The honor society Collegium Ramazzini is named after him.

<text>Sir Ludwig Guttmann (3 July 1899 – 18 March 1980) was a German-British neurologist who established the Stoke Mandeville Games, the sporting event for people with disabilities (PWD) that evolved in England into the Paralympic Games. A Jewish doctor who fled Nazi Germany just before the start of the Second World War, Guttmann was a founding father of organized physical activities for people with disabilities.

==Early life==
Ludwig Guttmann was born on 3 July 1899 to a German Jewish family, in the town of Tost, Upper Silesia, in the former German Empire (now Toszek in southern Poland), the son of Dorothy (née Weissenberg) and Bernard Guttmann, a distiller. When Guttmann was three years old, the family moved to the Silesian city of Königshütte (today Chorzów, Poland).

In 1917, while volunteering at an accident hospital in Königshütte, he encountered his first paraplegic patient, a coal miner with a spinal fracture who later died of sepsis. That same year, Guttmann passed his &quot;Abitur&quot; at the humanistic grammar school in Königshütte before being called up for military service.

Guttmann started his medical studies in April 1918 at the University of Breslau. He transferred to the University of Freiburg in 1919 and received his Doctorate of Medicine in 1924.

==Escape to Britain==

By 1933, Guttmann was working in Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland) as a neurosurgeon and lecturing at the university. He learned from the pioneer of neurosurgery, Otfrid Foerster, at his research institute. Despite having worked successfully as first assistant to Foerster, Guttmann was expelled from his university appointment and his job in 1933 under the Nuremberg Laws, and his title was changed to &quot;Krankenbehandler&quot; (one who treats the sick). With the arrival of the Nazis in power, Jews were banned from practising medicine professionally; Guttmann was assigned to work at the Breslau Jewish Hospital, where he became medical director in 1937. Following the violent attacks on Jewish people and properties during &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; on 9 November 1938, Guttmann ordered his staff to admit any patients without question. The following day, he justified his decision on a case-by-case basis with the &quot;Gestapo&quot;. Out of 64 admissions, 60 patients were saved from arrest and deportation to concentration camps.

In early 1939, Guttmann and his family left Germany because of the Nazi persecution of the Jews. An opportunity for escape had come when the Nazis provided him with a visa and ordered him to travel to Portugal to treat a friend of the Portuguese dictator António de Oliveira Salazar. Guttmann was scheduled to return to Germany via London, when the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (CARA) arranged for him to remain in the United Kingdom. He arrived in Oxford, England, on 14 March 1939 with his wife, Else Samuel Guttmann, and their two children: a son, Dennis, and a daughter, Eva, aged six. CARA negotiated with the British Home Office on their behalf, and gave Guttmann and his family £250 () to help settle in Oxford.

Guttmann continued his spinal injury research at the Nuffield Department of Neurosurgery in the Radcliffe Infirmary. For the first few weeks after arrival the family resided in the Master&#x27;s Lodge of Balliol College (with the Master Sandie Lindsay) until they moved into a small semi-detached house in Lonsdale Road. Both children were offered free places by the headmistress of Greycotes School. The family were members of the Oxford Jewish community, and Eva remembers becoming friendly with Miriam Margolyes, now a famous actress. The Jewish community in Oxford was growing rapidly as a result of the influx of displaced academic Jews from Europe.

With the outbreak of the Second World War, Guttmann and his family stayed in the home of Lord Lindsay, CARA Councillor and Master of Balliol College.

==Stoke Mandeville and Paralympic Games==
In September 1943, the British government asked Guttmann to establish the National Spinal Injuries Centre at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire. The initiative came from the Royal Air Force to improve the treatment and rehabilitation of pilots with spine injuries, &quot;who often crashed on approach with their bombers damaged&quot;. When the centre opened on 1 February 1944, the United Kingdom&#x27;s first specialist unit for treating spinal injuries, Guttmann was appointed its director (a position he held until 1966). He believed that sport was an important method of therapy for the rehabilitation of injured military personnel, helping them build up physical strength and self-respect.

Guttmann became a naturalised British citizen in 1945. He organised the first Stoke Mandeville Games for disabled war veterans, which was held at the hospital on 29 July 1948, the same day as the opening of the London Olympics. All participants had spinal cord injuries and competed in wheelchairs. In an effort to encourage his patients to take part in national events, Guttmann used the term &quot;Paraplegic Games&quot;. These came to be known as the &quot;Paralympic Games&quot;, which grew to include other disabilities.
By 1952, more than 130 international competitors had entered the Stoke Mandeville Games. As the annual event continued to grow, the ethos and efforts by all those involved started to impress the organisers of the Olympic Games and members of the international community. At the 1956 Stoke Mandeville Games, Guttmann was awarded the Sir Thomas Fearnley Cup by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for his meritorious achievement in service to the Olympic movement through the social and human value derived from wheelchair sports.

His vision of an international games, the equivalent of the Olympic Games themselves, was realised in 1960 when the International Stoke Mandeville Games were held alongside the official 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. Known at the time as the 9th Annual International Stoke Mandeville Games, and organised with the support of the World Federation of Ex-servicemen (an International Working Group on Sport for the Disabled), they are now recognised as the first Paralympic Games. (The term &quot;Paralympic Games&quot; was retroactively applied by the IOC in 1984.)

In 1961, Guttmann founded the British Sports Association for the Disabled, which would later become known as the English Federation of Disability Sport.

==Later life==
Guttmann was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1950 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours, as &quot;Neurological Surgeon in charge of the Spinal Injuries Centre at the Ministry of Pensions Hospital, Stoke Mandeville&quot;. On 28 June 1957, he was made an Associate Officer of the Venerable Order of Saint John.

He was promoted to Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1960, and he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1966.

In 1961, Guttmann founded the International Medical Society of Paraplegia, now the International Spinal Cord Society (ISCoS); he was the inaugural president of the society, a position that he held until 1970. He became the first editor of the journal &quot;Paraplegia&quot; (now named &quot;Spinal Cord&quot;). He retired from clinical work in 1966 but continued his involvement with sport.

Guttmann had a heart attack in October 1979, and died on 18 March 1980 at the age of 80. He is buried at the Bushey Jewish Cemetery outside of London.

==Legacy==

Stoke Mandeville Stadium, the National Centre for Disability Sport in the United Kingdom, was developed by him alongside the hospital.

A specialist neurorehabilitation hospital in Barcelona, the &quot;Institut Guttmann&quot;, is named in his honour. The founder of this, the first rehabilitation clinic for paraplegics in Spain, was Guillermo González Gilbey, who himself had paraplegia and made great progress in England with Ludwig Guttmann.

In June 2012, a life-sized cast-bronze statue of Guttmann was unveiled at Stoke Mandeville Stadium as part of the run-up to the London 2012 Summer Paralympics and Olympic Games. After the Games, it was moved to its permanent home at the National Spinal Injuries Centre. Guttmann&#x27;s daughter, Eva Loeffler, was appointed the mayor of the London 2012 Paralympic Games athletes&#x27; village.

In August 2012, the BBC broadcast &quot;The Best of Men&quot;, a TV film about Guttmann&#x27;s work at Stoke Mandeville during and after the Second World War. The film, written by Lucy Gannon, starred Eddie Marsan as Dr. Guttmann and Rob Brydon as one of the seriously injured patients, who were given a purpose in life by the doctor.

The Sir Ludwig Guttmann Centre is an NHS facility providing GP, Orthopaedic and Sports and Exercise Medicine outpatient services as well as imaging on the site of the 2012 Olympic village.

The Sir Ludwig Guttmann Lectureship was established by the International Medical Society of Paraplegia (now ISCoS) to recognize Guttmann&#x27;s pioneering work and lifelong contribution to spinal cord care.

The Ludwig Guttmann Prize of the German Medical Society for Paraplegia is awarded for &quot;excellent scientific work in the field of clinical research on spinal cord injury&quot;.

On 24 October 2013, a commemorative plaque was unveiled by the Association of Jewish Refugees (AJR) at the National Spinal Injuries Centre to celebrate Guttmann&#x27;s life and work. As an active member of the AJR, he had served on the board for more than 25 years.

In 2019 the National Paralympic Heritage Centre, a small accessible museum, was opened at Stoke Mandeville Stadium celebrating the birthplace of the Paralympics, sharing the collections of the early Paralympic Movement and the central role played by Professor Sir Ludwig Guttmann.

On 3 July 2021, a Google Doodle of Guttmann was featured on the Google homepage for Guttmann&#x27;s 122nd birthday.

<text>Nicholas Sparks (1794–27 February 1862) was an early landholder of Bytown, Upper Canada who owned most of the lands in the present day commercial core of Downtown Ottawa.

==Biography==
Sparks was born in Darrah parish, County Wexford in Ireland and came to Canada in 1816. He was recruited by Ruggles Wright (or by other accounts Ruggles&#x27;s brother Philemon Jr.) at age twenty-four to voyage to Canada as a labourer in the Wright family&#x27;s logging and farming enterprises in the location of modern Gatineau. By 1819 he was traveling to Montreal and Quebec, purchasing supplies for Wright.

On 25 September 1823, after saving his salary for several years, Sparks purchased 200 acres (0.8 km2) of land - along with some food and chattels - on the south side of the Ottawa River. He purchased the lot from John Burrows Honey (later known as John Burrows), a surveyor. The land was lot C, concession C, Nepean Township, which covered much of what is today downtown Ottawa stretching from what is today Wellington Street in the north to Laurier Avenue in the south. It stretched west to modern Bronson Avenue and extended eastwards further than the Rideau Canal (to Waller) into what is today Sandy Hill. South of his land was the land of Colonel By. Sparks borrowed £95, to complete the transaction for land that today is in the central business core of Ottawa.

Historian Michael S. Cross wrote:
:&quot;Lot C would become Sparks&#x27;s life, the basis of his fortune and status. Defending his right to the property would preoccupy him for much of his career. Sparks&#x27;s difficulties over the lot began immediately. Burrows Honey, it appears, had sold land he did not own. Although the original sale took place on 25 Sept. 1821, Burrows Honey did not receive clear title until 1823 for the south half and 1824 for the north half. The sale to Sparks, therefore, was not recorded at the county registry office until 20 June 1824. The confusion, which has led to considerable controversy among local historians over the purchase date, did not end there. Burrows Honey&#x27;s title remained in doubt. As a result, Sparks repurchased the south 100 acres on 20 June 1826. Still there were doubts; Sparks made token payments of 5s. to John Burrows Honey and to his wife for title to the full 200 acres on 6 May and 10 July 1830 respectively. Out of this tangle it appears the famous purchase was not made on the usually accepted date of 20 June 1826 but rather nearly five years earlier on 25 Sept. 1821, although the legal technicalities were not resolved until 1830.&quot;

:&quot;The 1826 date, however, has a fine touch of drama about it. Late in 1826 the decision was made to build the Rideau Canal through lot C. As the village of Bytown (Ottawa) sprang up around the canal terminus, Sparks became landlord for a whole community. Those months also saw Sparks cement the other foundation of his fortune. On 2 Nov. 1826 a marriage license was issued to Sparks and Sally Olmstead, widow of Philemon Wright Jr. The marriage solidified Sparks&#x27;s link with the leadership of the Ottawa timber trade.&quot;

:&quot;It was in land that Sparks reaped the greatest dividends. He began to sell portions of lot C as early as 18 Dec. 1826 when he sold land west of the canal mouth for £200 an acre, the same land he had bought for 9s. 6d. an acre. Land sales and leases quickly made Sparks wealthy. As one of the few people with ready cash he also became Bytown&#x27;s leading moneylender and often enough was able to regain land he had sold. For example, in January 1832 he accepted a lot in payment of a debt of £75. In May 1832 Sparks sold an adjacent lot for £600. The nicest irony in all of Sparks&#x27;s complex dealings came in July 1844 when he leased part of a town lot, 66 ft by 99 ft, for £200 to John Burrows.&quot;

The building of the final section of the canal saw the government expropriate the eastern section of his land, taking everything east of modern Elgin Street (then known as Biddy&#x27;s Lane). While losing some of his land, this proved a benefit for Sparks as the location of the canal greatly increased the value of his other holdings. Sparks donated about 20 acres of land towards the canal&#x27;s construction.

Sparks also donated land for civic buildings. He donated land for St. Andrew&#x27;s Presbyterian Church, and for a new court house and fire station. When his West Ward Market, unable to compete with Lower Town&#x27;s Byward Market, failed he donated the building to become Bytown&#x27;s first city hall. In 1832, he donated some land at the northwest corner of his property to the Anglican Church and that is still the site of Ottawa&#x27;s Christ Church Cathedral.

Sparks set out to encourage the establishment of commercial ventures on his property, which had proven to be poor farmland. Thus he established a market. While Ottawa remained a small town and commerce centered somewhat to the north of Sparks&#x27;s holdings he became wealthy as a result of his land; further enhanced after 1857, with the selection of Ottawa as the capital of Province of Canada.

In 1827, the government had seized some of Sparks&#x27;s holdings intending to construct a fortress to defend the new canal. Sparks challenged this appropriation of the land, between Bank Street and the Canal, which lay unused for years. He succeeded and was awarded a fortune of 27,000 pounds for the land. With this money he invested in enterprises across the region, and became a financier in the town. The Rideau Canal Act of February 1827, by the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada expropriated of Nicholas Sparks&#x27;s land, not returned to him until 1847 or late 1849.

Around 1848, he had a street created through the center of his holdings; this would later be known as Sparks Street, one of Ottawa&#x27;s central commercial areas.

In 1847, he became a member of Bytown&#x27;s first town council. When the new city of Ottawa was created to replace Bytown in 1855, Sparks also served on its council until 1860.

Sparks&#x27;s descendants continued to be prominent citizens in Ottawa for many generations, for example Percy Sparks spearheaded the creation of Gatineau Park. Today there are many Sparks still living in Ottawa.

<text>Mexico competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s twentieth appearance at the Olympics, since its debut in 1900. Comité Olímpico Mexicano sent the nation&#x27;s largest delegation to the Games since 1992. A total of 109 athletes, 59 men and 50 women, competed in 20 sports. Football was the only team-based sport in which Mexico had its representation in these Olympic Games. There was only a single competitor in fencing, shooting, and weightlifting.

The Mexican team featured three Olympic medalists from Sydney: race walker Noé Hernández, taekwondo jin Víctor Estrada, and diver Fernando Platas, who reprised his role to carry the national flag for the second time in the opening ceremony, after winning the silver in men&#x27;s springboard. Along with Platas, race walkers Miguel Ángel Rodríguez and Germán Sánchez officially made their fourth Olympic appearance as the most experienced members of the team. Meanwhile, show jumper Gerardo Tazzer, who helped the Mexicans claim the bronze at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, sought his fourth Olympic bid in Athens after a sixteen-year absence, and was also the oldest athlete of the team at age 52.

Mexico left Athens with a total of four medals (three silver and one bronze), failing to win a gold for the first time since 1996. Half of these medals were awarded to the athletes in taekwondo. Sprinter Ana Guevara set the nation&#x27;s historical milestone as the first ever female Mexican to claim an Olympic silver medal in track and field. Meanwhile, Belem Guerrero claimed a silver for the first time in the nation&#x27;s Olympic cycling history, since the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, since José Youshimatz took home the bronze in the men&#x27;s points race.

<doc id="913970" wikidata="Q7139403" url="?curid=913970" title="Parol evidence rule">
<text>The parol evidence rule is a rule in common law jurisdictions limiting the kinds of evidence parties to a contract dispute can introduce when trying to determine the specific terms of a contract and precluding parties who have reduced their agreement to a final written document from later introducing other evidence, such as the content of oral discussions from earlier in the negotiation process, as evidence of a different intent as to the terms of the contract. The rule provides that &quot;extrinsic evidence is inadmissible to vary a written contract&quot;. The term &quot;parol&quot; derives from the Anglo-Norman French &quot;parol&quot; or &quot;parole&quot;, meaning &quot;word of mouth&quot; or &quot;verbal&quot;, and in medieval times referred to oral pleadings in a court case.

The rule&#x27;s origins lie in English contract law, but it has been adopted in other common law jurisdictions; however there are now some differences between application of the rule in different jurisdictions. For instance, in the US, a common misconception is that it is a rule of evidence (like the Federal Rules of Evidence), but that is not the case; whereas in England it is indeed a rule of evidence.
The supporting rationale for excluding the content of verbal agreements from written contracts is that since the contracting parties have agreed to reduce their contract to a single and final writing, extrinsic evidence of past agreements or terms should not be considered when interpreting that writing, as the parties ultimately decided to leave them out of the contract. In other words, one may not use evidence made prior to the written contract to contradict the writing.

==Overview==

The rule applies to parol evidence, as well as other extrinsic evidence (such as written correspondence that does not form a separate contract) regarding a contract. If a contract is in writing and final to at least one term (integrated), parol or extrinsic evidence will generally be excluded. However, there are a number of exceptions to this general rule. These include partially integrated contracts, agreements with separate consideration, in order to resolve ambiguities, or to establish contract defenses.

To take an example, Carl agrees in writing to sell Betty a car for $1,000, but later, Betty argues that Carl earlier told her that she would only need to pay Carl $800. The parol evidence rule would generally prevent Betty from testifying to this alleged conversation because the testimony ($800) would directly contradict the written contract&#x27;s terms ($1,000).

The precise extent of the rule varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. As a preliminary or threshold issue, the court may first determine if the agreement was in fact totally reduced to a written document or (in US terminology) fully &quot;integrated&quot;. In the case of &quot;State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Heath Outdoor Pty Ltd&quot; McHugh J held that the parol evidence rule has &#x27;no operation until it is first determined&#x27; that all the terms of the contract are in writing. This threshold question applies even in those jurisdictions that apply a very strong form of the parol evidence rule, called the &quot;Four Corners Rule&quot;.

Beyond that, the exceptions to the parol evidence rule vary between jurisdictions. Examples of circumstances where extrinsic evidence may be admissible in different jurisdictions include:
* To prove the parties to a contract. A written agreement to sell land signed by Mrs. Kenny at times made reference to Mr. Kenny, and the court held that oral evidence was admissible to prove that she was signing for herself and as an agent for her husband.
* To prove a condition precedent. In &quot;Pym v Campbell&quot; (1865) 119 ER 903, Pym entered into a written contract with Campbell to sell an interest in an invention. The court allowed Campbell to include the oral terms of acknowledgement that the sale was subject to an inspection and approval by an engineer. The engineer did not approve the invention.
* To prove that the written document is only part of the contract as in &quot;Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation&quot;, where the court found a written contract to be only part of an agreement. In &quot;State Rail Authority of NSW v Heath Outdoor Pty Ltd&quot; the court held that the parol evidence rule is persuasive and the evidentiary burden is on the party wishing to establish that the whole contract was not in writing.
* To prove that an implied term of custom, trade usage, or past dealings is part of a contract even if it is not in a written agreement. In &quot;Hutton v Warren&quot;[1836] 1 M and W 466, the party wishing to add the term bore the evidentiary burden; in this case, a lease had to be read in the light of established custom.
* To prove what is true consideration, not something added to avoid taxes.
* To prove that the term or promise is part of a collateral contract.
* To aid in the interpretation of existing terms.
* To resolve ambiguity using the &quot;contra proferentem&quot; rule.
* To show, particularly in California, that (1) in light of all the circumstances surrounding the making of the contract, that the contract is actually ambiguous (regardless of whether the contract&#x27;s meaning appears unambiguous at first glance), (2) thus necessitating the use of extrinsic evidence to determine its &quot;actual&quot; meaning.
* To disprove the validity of the contract.
* To show that an unambiguous term in the contract is in fact a mistaken transcription of a prior valid agreement. Such a claim must be established by clear and convincing evidence, and not merely by the preponderance of the evidence.
* To correct mistakes.
* To show wrongful conduct such as misrepresentation, fraud, duress, unconscionability (276 N.E.2d 144, 147), or illegal purpose on the part of one or both parties.
* To show that consideration has not actually been paid. For example, if the contract states that A has paid B $1,000 in exchange for a painting, B can introduce evidence that A had never actually conveyed the $1,000.
* To identify the parties, especially if the parties have changed names.
* To imply or incorporate a term of the contract.
* To make changes in the contract after the original final contract has been agreed to. That is, oral statements can be admitted unless they are barred by a clause in the written contract.
* In Sri Lanka, to prove the presence of attendant circumstances creating a constructive trust in relation to an ex-facie absolute notarial conveyance.

In order for evidence to fall within this rule, it must involve either (1) a written or oral communication made prior to execution of the written contract; or (2) an oral communication made contemporaneous with execution of the written contract. Evidence of a &quot;later&quot; communication will not be barred by this rule, as it is admissible to show a later modification of the contract (although it might be inadmissible for some other reason, such as the Statute of frauds). Similarly, evidence of a collateral agreement - one that would naturally and normally be included in a separate writing - will not be barred. For example, if A contracts with B to paint B&#x27;s house for $1,000, B can introduce extrinsic evidence to show that A also contracted to paint B&#x27;s storage shed for $100. The agreement to paint the shed would logically be in a separate document from the agreement to paint the house.

Though its name suggests that it is a procedural evidence rule, the consensus of courts and commentators is that the parol evidence rule constitutes substantive contract law.

==Examples==
The parol evidence rule is a common trap for consumers. For example:

* Health club contracts. You enroll in a health club, and the salesperson tells you that the contract can be cancelled. You later decide you would like to cancel, but the written contract provides that it is non-cancellable. The oral promises of the salesperson are generally non-enforceable. However, the salesperson in misleading you into the terms of the contract constitutes a misrepresentation and you may seek to rescind the contract. It may also be a violation of Consumer protection law, which may have its own remedies.
* Auto sales agreements. You purchase a used car, and the salesperson tells you it is &quot;good as new&quot;, but the contract provides that the sale is as is. Again, in most circumstances the written contract controls. However, this may constitute misrepresentation if it exceeds reasonably accepted &quot;puffing&quot; or &quot;dealers&#x27; talk&quot;.
* Timeshares. While in certain jurisdictions, and in certain circumstances, a consumer may have a right of rescission, some people attend real estate sales presentations at which they may feel pressured into immediately signing binding contracts. Evidence that the contract was entered into under duress will not be precluded by the parol evidence rule.

The effect of this can be negated sometimes by specific statutory rules around consumer contracts (e.g. the Consumer Rights Act 2015 in the United Kingdom).

==Specific jurisdictions==

===United States===

In order for the rule to be effective, the contract in question must first be a final integrated writing; it must, in the judgment of the court, be the final agreement between the parties (as opposed to a mere draft, for example).

A final agreement is either a partial or complete integration, provided that it has an agreement on its face indicating its finality. If it contains some, but not all, of the terms as to which the parties have agreed then it is a partial integration. This means that the writing was a final agreement between the parties (and not mere preliminary negotiations) as to some terms, but not as to others. On the other hand, if the writing were to contain all of the terms as to which the parties agreed, then it would be a complete integration. One way to ensure that the contract will be found to be a final and complete integration is through the inclusion of a merger clause, which recites that the contract is, in fact, the whole agreement between the parties. However, many modern cases have found merger clauses to be only a rebuttable presumption.

The importance of the distinction between partial and complete integrations is relevant to what evidence is excluded under the parol evidence rule. For both complete and partial integrations, evidence contradicting the writing is excluded under the parol evidence rule. However, for a partial integration, terms that supplement the writing are admissible. To put it mildly, this can be an extremely subtle (and subjective) distinction.

To put it simply, (1) If the parties intend a complete integration of the contract terms, no parol evidence within the scope of agreement is permitted. (2) If the parties intended a partial integrated agreement, no parol evidence that contradicts anything integrated is permitted. And (3), if the parol evidence is collateral, meaning it regards a different agreement, and does not contradict the integrated terms, and are not terms any reasonable person would always naturally integrate, then the rule does not apply and the evidence is admissible.

In a minority of U.S. states, (Florida, Colorado, and Wisconsin), the parol evidence rule is extremely strong and extrinsic evidence is always barred from being used to interpret a contract. This is called the Four Corners Rule, and it is traditional/old. In a Four Corners Rule jurisdiction, there are two basic rules. First, the court will never allow parol evidence if the parties intended a full and completely integrated agreement, and second, the court will only turn to parol evidence if the terms available are wholly ambiguous. The policy is to prevent lying, to protect against doubtful veracity, to enable parties to rely dearly on written contracts, and for judicial efficiency.

In most jurisdictions there are numerous exceptions to this rule, and in those jurisdictions, extrinsic evidence may be admitted for various purposes. This is called the Admission Rule. It favors liberalizing the admission of evidence to determine if the contract was fully integrated and to determine if the parol evidence is relevant. In these jurisdictions, such as California, one can bring in parol evidence even if the contract is unambiguous on its face, if the parol evidence creates ambiguity. The policy is to get to the actual truth, sometimes.

The third and final admissibility rule is that under the UCC § 2-202: Parol evidence cannot contradict a writing intended to be the &quot;final expression&quot; of the agreement integrated but may be explained or supplemented by (a) a course of dealing/usage of trade/ course of performance, and by (b) evidence of consistent additional terms unless the writing was also intended to be a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement.

Additional information on the parol evidence rule may be found in Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 213.

===Australia===

In New South Wales, if an entire agreement clause, does not exist in the contract terms, parol evidence rule is a default rule of a completely written contract that the admission of extrinsic evidence is not allowed, and the contract should be understood in an objective approach.

However there are two exceptions that could overcome the parol evidence rule that extrinsic evidence is admissible: 
Exception 1: the contract is an oral contract or partly written.
Exception 2: parties may have entered into a collateral contract, or are establishing an estoppel, with rectification, condition precedent, the true consideration, ACL, implied terms.

There are also exceptions to the parol evidence rule in construing a contract. The first exception is that there is evidence of trade usage, which is well-known, uniform and certain. Appleby v Pursell [1973] 2 NSWLR 879.
Also, a narrow view of admissibility of extrinsic evidence has been taken, where evidence of surrounding circumstances is only admissible to resolve patent ambiguity, latent ambiguity, and inherent ambiguity in the meaning of the words of a contract. The High Court in &quot;Electricity Generation Corporation v Woodside Energy Ltd&quot; took a different approach to interpreting commercial contracts, considering the &quot;language used by the parties, the surrounding circumstances known to them and the commercial purpose or objects to be secured by the contract&quot; at the &quot;genesis of the transaction&quot;. This necessarily implies consideration of surrounding circumstances and indicates a broader approach may be adopted by the court in the future. The latest view is the narrow view which was described in &quot;Mount Bruce Mining Pty Limited v Wright Prospecting Pty Limited&quot;.

In the New South Wales case of &quot;Saleh v Romanous&quot;, it was held that equitable estoppel triumphs common law rules of parol evidence.

See &quot;L G Throne v Thomas Borthwick&quot; where the dissent of Herron J has been subsequently adopted.

===South Africa===

In South Africa the Supreme Court of Appeal, beginning with the landmark ruling in &quot;KPMG Chartered Accountants (SA) v Securefin Ltd&quot;, redefined the rules relating to the admissibility of evidence that may be used in the interpretation of contracts in South Africa and in &quot;Dexgroup (Pty) Ltd v Trustco Group International (Pty) Ltd&quot; the Supreme Court of Appeal gave further clarity on these rules. The starting point is the language of the document and the parol evidence rule prevents evidence to add to, detract from or modify the words contained in the document. However, evidence to prove the meaning of the words, expressions, sentences and terms that constitute the contract, is admissible from the outset irrespective of whether there is any uncertainty or ambiguity in the text – as long as the evidence concerned points to a meaning which the text can reasonably have and the evidence is relevant to prove the common intention of the parties.

<doc id="913971" wikidata="Q3180417" url="?curid=913971" title="Sanditon">
<text>Sanditon is an 1817 unfinished novel by the English writer Jane Austen. In January 1817, Austen began work on a new novel she called &quot;The Brothers&quot;, later titled &quot;Sanditon&quot;, and completed twelve chapters before stopping work in mid-March 1817, probably because of illness. R.W. Chapman first published a transcription of the original manuscript in 1925 under the name &quot;Fragment of a Novel Written by Jane Austen, January–March 1817&quot;.

==Plot==
The novel centres on Charlotte Heywood, the eldest of the daughters still at home in the large family of a country gentleman from Willingden, Sussex. The narrative opens when the carriage of Mr and Mrs Parker of Sanditon topples over on a hill near the Heywood home. Because Mr Parker is injured in the crash, and the carriage needs repairs, the Parkers stay with the Heywood family for a fortnight. During this time, Mr Parker talks fondly of Sanditon, a town which until a few years before had been a small, unpretentious fishing village. With his business partner, Lady Denham, Mr Parker hopes to make Sanditon into a fashionable seaside resort. Mr Parker&#x27;s enormous enthusiasm for his plans to improve and modernise Sanditon has resulted in the installation of bathing machines and the construction of a new home for himself and his family near the seashore. Upon repair of the carriage and improvement to Mr Parker&#x27;s foot, the Parkers return to Sanditon, bringing Charlotte with them as their summer guest.

Upon arrival in Sanditon, Charlotte meets the inhabitants of the town. Prominent among them is Lady Denham, a twice-widowed woman who received a fortune from her first husband and a title from her second. Living with Lady Denham is her niece Clara Brereton, a sweet and beautiful yet impoverished young lady. Also living in Sanditon are Sir Edward Denham and his sister Esther, nephew and niece to Lady Denham by her second husband. The siblings are poor and are thought to be seeking Lady Denham&#x27;s fortune; Sir Edward is described as a silly and very florid man, though handsome.

After settling in with the Parkers and encountering various neighbours, Charlotte and Mr and Mrs Parker are surprised by a visit from his two sisters and younger brother, all of whom are self-declared invalids. However, given their level of activity and seeming strength, Charlotte quickly surmises that their complaints are invented. Diana Parker has come on a mission to secure a house for a wealthy family from the West Indies, although she has not specifically been asked to help. She also brings word of a second large party, a girls&#x27; school, which is intending to summer at Sanditon. This news causes a stir in the small town, especially for Mr Parker, whose fondest wish is the promotion of tourism there.

With the arrival of Mrs Griffiths at Sanditon, it soon becomes apparent that the family from the West Indies and the girls&#x27; school group are one and the same. The visitors consist of Miss Lambe, a teenaged Antiguan-English heiress, and the two Miss Beauforts, English girls just arrived from the West Indies. In short order, Lady Denham calls on Mrs. Griffiths to be introduced to Miss Lambe, the sickly and very rich young woman that she intends her nephew, Sir Edward, to marry.

A carriage unexpectedly arrives bearing Sidney Parker, the middle Parker brother. He will be staying in town for a few days with two friends who will join him shortly. Sidney Parker is about 27 or 28 years old, and Charlotte finds him very good-looking, with a decided air of fashion.

The book fragment ends when Mrs Parker and Charlotte visit Sanditon House, Lady Denham&#x27;s residence. There Charlotte spots Clara Brereton seated with Sir Edward Denham at her side having an intimate conversation in the garden and surmises that they must have a secret understanding. When they arrive inside, Charlotte observes that a large portrait of Sir Henry Denham hangs over the fireplace, whereas Lady Denham&#x27;s first husband, who owned Sanditon House, only gets a miniature in the corner – obliged, as it were, to sit back in his own house and see the best place by the fire constantly occupied by Sir Henry Denham.

==Characters==

* Mr. and Mrs. Heywood – A prosperous gentleman farmer and his wife who open their home to Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Parker, whose carriage overturns nearby. It was written that the Heywoods would have been even more prosperous if they had not had 14 children. They do not care to travel, but have no objection to their children doing so if they have the opportunity.
* Charlotte Heywood – The eldest of the Heywood daughters still at home. A nice, pretty girl who appears to be the heroine of the novel. Much of the story is told from her perspective. She is invited to experience the seaside at Sanditon with Mr. and Mrs. Parker.
* Mr. Thomas Parker – The eldest of the three Parker brothers. Middle-aged; fanatical over the health benefits of sea air and water. He and Lady Denham are invested in promoting Sanditon as a smaller Brighton.
* Mrs. Thomas Parker (Mary) – Thomas&#x27; wife and mother of their four children, Little Mary and three boys.
* Sidney Parker – The second Parker brother, who is 27–28 years old. Good-looking, well bred, &quot;air of ease and fashion and a lively countenance&quot;. Most sources contend he was to be the hero and marry Charlotte; however, he is barely mentioned before Austen stopped writing and it is not known what other characters she might have had in mind. He and his three other siblings, Arthur, Susan, and Diana come to Sanditon for a visit.
* Miss Susan Parker – The older of the two spinster Parker sisters. A hypochondriac.
* Miss Diana Parker – 34 years old. A hypochondriac when not busy being a nosy, self-satisfied, officious pest.
* Arthur Parker – The youngest Parker brother. 21 years old. An overweight hypochondriac. &quot;Poor health&quot; is his excuse to eat what he wants and sit lazily by the fire. Lives with his spinster sisters.
* Lady Denham, née Brereton – 70 years old; twice widowed. She lives in Sanditon Hall, the largest house in the area and home of her first husband. She was born wealthy but was not well educated. She inherited more money from her first husband, Mr. Hollis. Her title came from her poor, second husband Sir Harry Denham. Many family members, her own and her late husbands&#x27;, wish to inherit from her.
* Sir Edward Denham – He inherits Sir Harry&#x27;s title but not the money. He is insincere, with loose morals. He would like to seduce Clara Brereton because she is &quot;young, lovely, and dependent&quot; and a rival for Lady Denham&#x27;s fortune.
* Miss Esther Denham – The sister of Sir Edward.
* Miss Clara Brereton – The poor distant cousin of Lady Denham who has been living with her for about a year. She is a &quot;lovely and interesting young woman... Elegantly tall, regularly handsome, with great delicacy of complexion and soft blue eyes, (with) a sweetly modest and yet naturally graceful address.&quot;
* Mrs. Whitby – She runs the library/general store in Sanditon.
* Miss Whitby – Helps with her mother&#x27;s business.
* Young Whitby – Helps with his mother&#x27;s business.
* Mr. and Mrs. Hillier – Mentioned as people now living in the Parker&#x27;s previous family home since Mr. Thomas Parker built a modern new home named &quot;Trafalgar&quot;.
* Mrs. Griffiths – Seems to be a professional chaperone who is paid to look after girls and introduce them around.

==Analysis and background==
The people of &quot;modern Sanditon&quot;, as Austen calls it, have moved out of the &quot;old house – the house of [their] forefathers&quot; and are busily constructing a new world in the form of a modern seaside commercial town. The town of Sanditon is almost certainly based on Worthing, where Jane Austen stayed in late 1805 when the resort was first being developed. There is persuasive evidence that the character of Mr. Thomas Parker was inspired by Edward Ogle, Worthing&#x27;s early entrepreneur, whom Jane Austen and her sister Cassandra knew. Sanditon is, however, less of an actual reality than an ideal of the inhabitants – one that they express in their descriptions of it. These inhabitants have a conception of the town&#x27;s identity and of the way in which this identity should be spread to, and appreciated by, the world:

==Continuations and adaptations==
Because Austen completed setting the scene for Sanditon, it has been a favourite of &quot;continuators&quot; – later writers who try to complete the novel within Austen&#x27;s vision while emulating her style. Such &quot;completed&quot; versions of Sanditon include:
* &quot;Sanditon&quot;, by Jane Austen and &quot;another lady&quot;, ; also published as &quot;Sanditon&quot;, by Jane Austen and Marie Dobbs, and &quot;Sanditon&quot;, by Jane Austen and Anne Telscombe, 
* &quot;A Completion of Sanditon&quot;, by Juliette Shapiro, (does not include Austen&#x27;s text)
* &quot;A Return to Sanditon: a completion of Jane Austen&#x27;s fragment&quot;, by Anne Toledo, (includes Austen&#x27;s text)
* &quot;Sanditon&quot;, by Jane Austen and completed by D. J. Eden, 
* &quot;Jane Austen&#x27;s Sanditon: A continuation&quot;, by Anna Austen Lefroy (Austen&#x27;s niece), (also unfinished)
* &quot;Jane Austen Out of the Blue&quot;, by Donald Measham, 
* &quot;Jane Austen&#x27;s Charlotte&quot;, by Jane Austen and completed by Julia Barrett, 
* &quot;A Cure for All Diseases&quot; (Canada and US title: &quot;The Price of Butcher&#x27;s Meat&quot;) by Reginald Hill, , a novel in the &quot;Dalziel and Pascoe&quot; series, is acknowledged by the author to be a &quot;completion&quot; of &quot;Sanditon&quot;. In Hill&#x27;s novel, the village is renamed Sandytown, and lies on the Yorkshire coast.
* &quot;Welcome to Sanditon&quot;, a modernized mini webseries adaptation set in California, produced by the creators of &quot;The Lizzie Bennet Diaries&quot; and premiered on 13 May 2013. Not continuing the story, the adaptation uses a &quot;deus ex machina&quot; to end where Austen left off, replacing Charlotte with [Fitz]William Darcy&#x27;s sister, Georgiana (Gigi) from &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. Near the end, William makes an appearance, pulling Gigi out from her role as Charlotte.
*&quot;Sanditon&quot;, a television series adapted by Andrew Davies and premiered on ITV on 25 August 2019, and PBS on 12 January 2020. A second series, commissioned by PBS and BritBox, aired on PBS on 20 March 2022, and premiered on ITV on 22 July 2022 after previously streaming on Britbox; a third series was shot back-to-back for later transmission, and appeared on ITVX during 2023.

<text>Carlo Rainaldi (4 May 1611 – 8 February 1691) was an Italian architect of the Baroque period.

==Biography==
Born in Rome, Rainaldi was one of the leading architects of 17th-century Rome, known for a certain grandeur in his designs. He worked at first with his father, Girolamo Rainaldi, a late Mannerist architect in Rome. After his father&#x27;s death, he fully embraced the monumental Baroque style. He gained ascendancy in Rome when the Barberini pontificate of Pope Urban VIII was replaced by that of the more austere Pamphilj papacy of Innocent X. His works include the façade of Sant&#x27;Andrea della Valle (1661–1665), the façade of San Girolamo della Carità (1657}, the twin churches of Santa Maria dei Miracoli and Santa Maria in Montesanto, and Santa Maria in Campitelli (1663–1667). He was unable to complete the facade of Sant&#x27;Agnese in Agone during work in 1653–1657. The high altar of Santa Maria della Scala is by Rainaldi. 

Beyond his work as an architect in stone, Rainaldi also designed stage sets for religious rituals and events. In 1650, he designed the sets for the Quarant&#x27;ore, or Forty Hours Devotion, held in the church of Il Gesù. In 1665, he designed a catafalque commemorating the death of Philip IV of Spain. He also was a composer.

Rainaldi died in Rome.

<text>Bérengère Schuh (born 13 June 1984 in Auxerre) is an athlete from France. She competes in archery.

== 2004 Summer Olympics ==
Schuh represented France at the 2004 Summer Olympics. She placed 31st in the women&#x27;s individual ranking round with a 72-arrow score of 626. In the first round of elimination, she faced 34th-ranked Elpida Romantzi of Greece. Schuh lost 151–143 in the 18-arrow match, placing 43rd overall in women&#x27;s individual archery. Schuh was also a member of the 4th-place French team in the women&#x27;s team archery competition.

== 2008 Summer Olympics ==
At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing Schuh finished her ranking round with a total of 645 points. This gave her the 14th seed for the final competition bracket in which she faced Pia Carmen Maria Lionetti in the first round, beating the archer from Italy with 112–107. In the second round she had no problem beating Sayoko Kitabatake with 112–100, but in the third round she was unable to surprise third seed Joo Hyun-Jung and was eliminated with 109–104.

Together with Sophie Dodemont and Virginie Arnold she also took part in the team event. With her 645 score from the ranking round combined with the 632 of Dodemont and the 626 of Arnold the French team was in fifth position after the ranking round, which gave them a straight seed into the quarter-finals. With 218–211 they were too strong for the Polish team. In the semi-final against South Korea they scored only 184 points with the Koreans scoring 213, missing out on the final. They recovered in the bronze medal match and won against Great Britain 203–201 to claim the bronze.

<doc id="913979" wikidata="Q4141283" url="?curid=913979" title="William Lee (diplomat)">
<text>William Lee (August 31, 1739 – June 27, 1795) was a Virginia merchant and member of the Lee Family of Virginia who served as an American diplomat during the Revolutionary War, became a plantation owner through marriage, and represented Elizabeth City, Warwick and York Counties in the Virginia Senate. His son William Ludwell Lee (who survived him only by a decade) became an early Lee family genealogist as well as left a will freeing his slaves.

==Background==
Born at Stratford Hall Plantation in Westmoreland County, Virginia, to planter Thomas Lee (1690–1750) and his wife, Hannah Harrison Ludwell (1701–1750). He could trace his descent from Richard Lee I, a merchant and colonial officeholder who had founded the influential Virginia family in the previous century. Lee was thus born into the First Families of Virginia and received a private education appropriate to his class. Two of his elder brothers, Richard Henry Lee (1732–1794) and Francis Lightfoot Lee (1734–1797) were planters and politicians active within the Virginia General Assembly and then the Continental Congress, and his younger brother Arthur Lee (1740–1792) would also become an American diplomat and politician. Complicating matters, relations shared the same name, including two men who died childless: the founder Richard Lee I&#x27;s son William (1651–1696) who held Northumberland county offices, distant cousin named William Lee of Northampton County, the son of his great uncle Hancock Lee and Mary Kendall. Unless this merchant returned to Virginia between 1779 and 1781, a different man won election and re-election to in the Virginia House of Delegates, representing Northumberland County as the American Revolutionary War ended.

==London merchant and politician==
As a younger brother, Lee did not expect to inherit plantations from his parents, but after completing his education moved to London and became a mercantile agent for Virginia in the tobacco trade. Beginning in 1760, he and his sister Alice (who was trying to escape an unfortunate marriage to Billy Shippen) lived in London with their mother&#x27;s widower brother, Col. Philip Ludwell III and his three daughters (the Ludwell family included no sons). Ludwell owned Green Spring Plantation in James City County, Virginia, once the vast estate along the James River owned by colonial governor William Berkeley, a mentor of their ancestor Richard Lee I. Enslaved labor on that plantation (like at many Lee family plantations) grew tobacco (prices of which were depressed during his ownership), as well as indigo, wheat, corn, cotton and flax, among other crops.

William Lee returned to Virginia for five years, 1763–1768, to work at Stratford and assist his eldest brother Col. Philip Lee (1717–1775, already a member of the Governor&#x27;s Council), then sailed to London en route to making his fortune in India or elsewhere. However, after hearing of Col. Ludwell&#x27;s death in London in 1767, William Lee stayed in that city, courted his heiress cousin Hannah Philippa Ludwell (30 years old at the time and known for an independent disposition), and married her on March 7, 1769. By this time, her sister Frances had also died, and Hannah Ludwell Lee worked to ensure that she (and not her remaining sister Lucy who at age 16 married London dilettante 
John Paradise months later) would inherit the 7000 acre Green Spring plantation, but she did not want to return to Virginia. While Hannah proved to be shrewd in understanding the purchasing desires and needs of planters&#x27; wives (thus helping to gain business from their husbands), William Lee also made some unwise decisions concerning her Virginia plantations firing the long-time overseer and antagonizing the widely respected Robert Carter Nicholas who was administering Philip Ludlow&#x27;s will. Thus, the family stayed in London and William Lee began a career as a tobacco merchant, as well as raising the family described below, and superintending the education in England of the sons of their brother Richard Henry Lee, Thomas Lee and Ludwell Lee, both of whom proved good students.

After joining the Haberdashers Company, Lee was appointed Sheriff of London for 1774 after Sheriff Plomer resigned. The other sheriff for that year, Stephen Sayes, was also American born. The position gave them the opportunity to press in high places the American case for less taxation and more representation. After his year as sheriff, William Lee was elected an Alderman, but could not fulfill his dream to become a member of Parliament. Nonetheless, he continued his campaign for American rights.

Lee became an agent of the Continental Congress during the American Revolution, and was posted to Berlin and Vienna but the political situation caused the family to take up residence in Frankfurt. Moreover, Lee failed to obtain support from either Austria or Prussia. An unofficial U.S.-Dutch treaty that Lee helped draft became the cause of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War. Towards the end of the war Lee moved to Brussels, and then, leaving his wife and children there rather than risk a wartime voyage, returned to Virginia alone to try to collect more than 10,000 English pounds of debts owed him by Virginia planters.

==Virginia planter and politician==

During the war, his brother Richard Henry Lee had warned William Lee that slaves were fleeing to British lines, such that Lucy Paradise&#x27;s Rich Neck plantation had but one remaining slave, and all Richard Taliaferro&#x27;s slaves at Powhatan Plantation and Champion Travis&#x27; of Jamestown Island had escaped. Moreover, his wife&#x27;s plantation on July 6, 1781, became the site of Battle of Green Spring, as General Lafayette&#x27;s (outnumbered) forces fell into an ambush by Lord Cornwallis&#x27; troops during their retreat to nearby Yorktown, Virginia, where Cornwallis would ultimately surrender. In February 1782, Lee forwarded a complaint to Lafayette for damage done the estate.

Upon William Lee&#x27;s return to Virginia, Elizabeth City, Warwick and York Counties elected him to the Virginia Senate in 1783 together with David Jameson, and confirmed Lee as their sole senator in the next session.

While at Green Spring with his son William Ludlow Lee, William Lee was concerned about the blacks, ordering that the most promising be apprenticed to various trades, as well as ordering repairs made upon the mansion that had grown decrepit under a succession of overseers.

Lee learned that his wife died suddenly in Ostend, Belgium on August 18, 1784, on her way home with the children, and ordered her buried in London with her parents. In 1785, his eyesight failing, he also tried to strengthen the Episcopal Church, while waiting for his daughters to arrive (they did in November, and would be sent to be educated at Menokin by the childless Col. Frank Lee and his wife Becky).

Although ill and going blind (cataract surgery in Philadelphia in 1789 having failed), Lee in 1790 accepted the post of James City County sheriff, and served two years.

== Death and legacy ==
William Lee died at Green Spring plantation on June 27, 1795, and was buried beside his Ludwell grandparents in Jamestown. The will he penned in 1789 left most of his estate (including about 8700 acres of land once held by Philip Ludwell III) to his son WIlliam Ludwell Lee, then 20 years old, who chose not to accept his father&#x27;s advice to change his surname to Ludwell so that family name would not die out.

His underage sisters remained at Menokin, then after Col. Frank Lee&#x27;s death moved to Alexandria, Virginia, where Portia married merchant William Hodgson in May 1799. William L. Lee often visited them, and Philadelphia, but also chose to pull down the old house against the advice of Benjamin Latrobe and replaced it with a new one. However, William L. Lee died on January 24, 1803. He was interred beside his father at Jamestown, with Bishop James Madison officiating at the service, which was postponed because of weather.

Both sisters then moved to Green Spring, wary of suitors attracted by their wealth. As executor, Hodgson tried to impose discipline on the plantation, including its slaves freed by William Lee&#x27;s will on January 1 following his death, but finally sold the estate to George Mason in 1824. After interim owners, John and Robert C.A. Ward of New Jersey resumed using slave labor. Cornelia married Richmond businessman John Hopkins and bore four daughters before dying in Richmond of complications from the last birth in 1818.

Nonetheless, a free Black community remained at Centerville, in what he had called the Hot Water Tract. Although William L. Lee&#x27;s will also made a bequest to establish a free school there, in 1818 the College of William and Mary brought suit, alleging that the annual allotments of corn had not been paid, nor did the college ever establish the school, although the case reportedly reached the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals. By 1842 James City County voters were asked for permission to lend the funds out.

Green Spring would again become a battle site in the American Civil War, as part of the Battle of Williamsburg, and the replacement mansion burned down. In 1966, the National Park Service acquired about 200 acres of the property, which is now part of Colonial National Historic Park.

==Personal life==
William married Hannah Phillipa Ludwell (1739–1784) on March 7, 1769, in London, following her father&#x27;s death in that city. Hannah was also born into the First Families of Virginia as one of three daughters of Col. Philip Ludwell III (1716–1767) who operated Green Spring Plantation in Northumberland County, Virginia, and his wife, the former Frances Grymes (1717- ). Her sisters were Frances Ludwell and Lucy Ludwell Paradise. Their mother Frances was the older sister of Lucy Grymes (1734–1792), who married Maj. Gen. Henry Lee II (1730–1787). Her maternal grandparents were Hon. Charles Grymes (1693–1743) and Frances Jennings, and resided at &quot;Morattico&quot; in Richmond County. Her paternal grandparents were Philip Ludwell Jr. (1672–1726) and Hannah Harrison (1679–1731).

Before Hanna Ludwell Lee died in Ostend, Belgium on August 18, 1784, they had children:
#William Ludwell Lee (1775–1803), who never married, and whose will administered by his brother in law William Hodgson freed his slaves.
#Portia Lee (1777–1840), who married William Hodgson (1765–1820).
#Brutus Lee (1778–1779), who died young.
#Cornelia Lee (1780–1818), who married John Hopkins ().

<text>The United States District Court for the District of Delaware (in case citations, D. Del.) is the Federal district court having jurisdiction over the entire state of Delaware. The Court sits in Wilmington.

Because Delaware is the state of incorporation for most major U.S. corporations, the District of Delaware hears and tries many patent and other complex commercial disputes that must be heard in federal court for diversity of citizenship reasons, and hears many appeals from bankruptcy disputes which are filed with the [[United States Bankruptcy Court]] for the District of Delaware.

Appeals from the Court are heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which sits in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit).

The current United States attorney for the District of Delaware is David C. Weiss since January 22, 2018.

== History ==
