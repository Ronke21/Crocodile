<text>In combinatorics, bijective proof is a proof technique for proving that two sets have equally many elements, or that the sets in two combinatorial classes have equal size, by finding a bijective function that maps one set one-to-one onto the other. This technique can be useful as a way of finding a formula for the number of elements of certain sets, by corresponding them with other sets that are easier to count. Additionally, the nature of the bijection itself often provides powerful insights into each or both of the sets.

==Basic examples==

=== Proving the symmetry of the binomial coefficients ===

The symmetry of the binomial coefficients states that

:formula_1

This means that there are exactly as many combinations of things in a set of size as there are combinations of things in a set of size .

The key idea of the bijective proof may be understood from a simple example: selecting children to be rewarded with ice cream cones, out of a group of children, has exactly the same effect as choosing instead the children to be denied ice cream cones.

== Other examples ==

Problems that admit bijective proofs are not limited to binomial coefficient identities. As the complexity of the problem increases, a bijective proof can become very sophisticated. This technique is particularly useful in areas of discrete mathematics such as combinatorics, graph theory, and number theory.

The most classical examples of bijective proofs in combinatorics include:
* Prüfer sequence, giving a proof of Cayley&#x27;s formula for the number of labeled trees.
* Robinson-Schensted algorithm, giving a proof of Burnside&#x27;s formula for the symmetric group.
* Conjugation of Young diagrams, giving a proof of a classical result on the number of certain integer partitions.
* Bijective proofs of the pentagonal number theorem.
* Bijective proofs of the formula for the Catalan numbers.

<text>Adam Maxwell Burton, known professionally as Maxwell Atoms, is an American animator, screenwriter, storyboard artist, and voice actor. He is the creator of the Cartoon Network series &quot;Grim &amp; Evil&quot; and its subsequent spin-offs, &quot;The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy&quot; and &quot;Evil Con Carne&quot;.

==Career==
Atoms is the creator of Cartoon Network&#x27;s animated television series &quot;The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy&quot;, &quot;Evil Con Carne&quot;, and has developed a &quot;Billy &amp; Mandy&quot; spin-off Halloween special called &quot;&quot;. Atoms attended the University of the Arts in Philadelphia. Before he started working on his own series, Atoms was an intern at Film Roman, a freelance artist at Warner Bros., had a brief stint at WildBrain, and had also worked on &quot;The Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat&quot;. Atoms got a job at Hanna-Barbera and as a story and storyboard artist on &quot;Cow and Chicken&quot; and &quot;I Am Weasel&quot;. Atoms also performed the voice of Jeff the Spider and Piff on &quot;The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy&quot;, and voiced Cod Commando on &quot;Evil Con Carne&quot;. He also voiced several additional characters in the TV-movie &quot;Billy &amp; Mandy&#x27;s Big Boogey Adventure&quot;.

Atoms is good friends with fellow animator Mr. Warburton, creator of &quot;&quot; and C. H. Greenblatt, the creator of &quot;Chowder&quot; and &quot;Harvey Beaks&quot;. He and Warburton have made multiple references to each other&#x27;s shows and have made a crossover half-hour special, &quot;The Grim Adventures of the Kids Next Door&quot;. As for C. H., he voiced the character Fred Fredburger in several episodes of &quot;Billy &amp; Mandy&quot;, alongside a brief cameo of Chowder in &quot;Underfist&quot;. Atoms was also an executive producer and voice actor of the Disney show &quot;Fish Hooks&quot; with Noah Z. Jones.

As of 2012, Atoms begun developing a new project entitled &quot;Dead Meat&quot;, &quot;an awesome black comedy/buddy action/puppet gore web series&quot;, which was still in production as of January 2020 and had a successful Kickstarter campaign as of November 15, 2013. In an interview in 2013, Atoms stated that the series would be posted somewhere on the internet once it is finished. In early 2014, Atoms stated that he hopes to get the series released in 2015. This fell through and, in early 2020, Atoms announced that the project is shelved indefinitely and all backers will be refunded due to expensive costs and contractual issues. In 2016 he began working on a new series called &quot;Bunnicula&quot;. The show ended in 2018.

In 2020, he provided several additional voices for the adult animated web series &quot;Hazbin Hotel&quot;, as he met creator Vivienne Medrano during work on &quot;Dead Meat&quot;. He serves as a storyboard supervisor on &quot;The Patrick Star Show&quot;.

==Personal life==
Atoms lives in Los Angeles. He has Asperger syndrome.

<doc id="917014" wikidata="Q2610927" url="?curid=917014" title="Guess Who?">
<text>Guess Who? is a two-player board game in which players each guess the identity of the other&#x27;s chosen character. The game was developed by Israeli game inventors Ora and Theo Coster, the founders of Theora Design. It was first released in Dutch in 1979 under the name &quot;Wie is het?&quot; Milton Bradley then produced the game in the United Kingdom, and it was brought to the United States in 1982. It is now owned by Hasbro.

==Gameplay==

Each player starts the game with a board that includes cartoon images of 24 people and their first names with all the images standing up. Each player selects a card of their choice from a separate pile of cards containing the same 24 images. The objective of the game is to be the first to determine which card one&#x27;s opponent has selected. Players alternate asking various yes or no questions to eliminate some of the candidates, such as:

* &quot;Does your person wear a hat?&quot;
* &quot;Does your person wear glasses?&quot;
* &quot;Is your person a man?&quot;

The player will then eliminate candidates (based on the opponent&#x27;s response) by flipping those images down until only one is left. Well-crafted questions allow players to eliminate one or more possible cards.

==Editions==
Special editions which have different faces have been released, including Star Wars (released 2008 with 24 characters, and 2014 with 15 characters), Batman (released 2019), Animal Crossing (2019), Marvel Comics (released 2022, 24 characters), Super Mario (2022), Disney, Mr. Men, Peppa Pig and The Simpsons. There are smaller, &quot;travel&quot; editions that have only 20 different faces. In 2008 and 2010, extra and mix and match games were released. A computer game based on the series was released in 1999 by Hasbro Interactive/Infogrames. Also in 1999, a Scratchcard version of the game was released.

==Advertising==
In the United States, advertisements for the board game often showed the characters on the cards coming to life and making witty comments to each other. This caused later editions of such ads to carry the spoken disclaimer line &quot;game cards do not actually talk&quot; to meet Federal Trade Commission advertising guidelines requiring full disclosure of toy features unable to be replicated with the actual product.

==Strategy==
Popular belief is that a binary search is the most efficient approach to the game, with which each question halves the number of possible identities. This can be applied by asking complex questions - such as &quot;Does your character have red hair, &quot;or&quot; glasses, &quot;or&quot; a big nose?&quot; - where a yes or a no eliminates exactly half of the remaining characters. Such a strategy takes only four questions to reduce the field to three people, giving the fifth question a 50/50 chance of identifying the opponent&#x27;s character.

The game was strongly solved by Mihai Nica in 2016. Nica&#x27;s research found that while a player was ahead their optimal strategy was a binary search, and when behind they should instead make &quot;bold plays&quot; that had a chance of narrowing things down significantly, in order to pull ahead of the other player. Using this method, the first player has a 63% chance of winning under optimal play by both sides.

==Use in education==
&quot;Guess Who?&quot; has been used in educational contexts, including the development of deductive reasoning skills. In addition, the game can be used for a wide range of speech and language development goals, including:
*Articulation
*Comprehension
*Question formation
*Describing salient features
*Vocabulary in foreign languages

==Criticism of lack of diversity==
Some have noted a bias toward white and male characters in &quot;Guess Who?&quot;. In 2012, a freelance journalist wrote to Hasbro on behalf of her six-year-old daughter, asking why there were only five female characters to choose from, as opposed to nineteen male characters. Hasbro&#x27;s response was that the game was intended to &quot;draw attention away from using gender or ethnicity as the focal point, and to concentrate on those things that we all have in common, rather than focus on our differences.&quot;

In response to Hasbro&#x27;s statement, the journalist said that she thought identifying physical differences was &quot;the whole point&quot; of the game, and asked: &quot;Why is female gender regarded as a &#x27;characteristic&#x27;, while male gender is not?&quot; &quot;New Statesman&quot; criticized the &quot;tone-deafness&quot; of Hasbro&#x27;s remarks.

Some editions of the game since the early 2000s have included more women.

The original version of &quot;Guess Who?&quot; featured only one non-white character Anne, a black woman who was redrawn in a subsequent edition as white. More recently, Hasbro has redesigned the board to feature a more racially diverse set of people.

==Television adaptation==
On April 19, 2021, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; announced that a planned unscripted television adaptation of the board game was in early development at NBC and will be produced by Endemol Shine North America and Entertainment One (Hasbro&#x27;s subsidiary).

<text>Presidential elections were held for the first time in São Tomé and Príncipe on 3 March 1991, as previously the President had been elected by the National Assembly. Ultimately only one candidate, Miguel Trovoada, ran for office, and was elected unopposed. The MLSTP-PSD had called for voters to boycott the election.

Trovoada was sworn in as the second president of São Tomé and Príncipe on 3 April.

==Candidates==
Three candidates stated their intention to participate in the contest; Miguel Trovoada, a former Prime Minister running as an independent (with the support of both the PCD-GR and CODO), Monso dos Santos of the Christian Democratic Front (FDC) and Guadalupe de Ceita, an independent candidate. Manuel Pinto da Costa, President since independence in 1975, declared that he would not be contesting the election and that he would retire from politics. The MLSTP-PSD did not present an alternative candidate. 

In February, less than a month before the election, both Monso dos Santos and Guadalupe de Ceita withdrew from the elections, leaving Trovoada as the sole candidate.

<text>Magnus the Strong (c. 1106 – 4 June 1134), also known as Magnus Nilsson (), was a Danish duke who ruled Götaland in southern Sweden from the 1120s to c. 1132. It is disputed whether he was elected king by the Swedes, but he is nevertheless sometimes found in the modern list of Swedish monarchs as Magnus I. Snorri Sturlason gives him the epithet &quot;Strong&quot;.

He was also briefly co-king of Denmark from 15 April 1134 and until his death.

== Youth and appearance ==

Magnus was the son of King Niels I of Denmark and Margaret Fredkulla, the second or eldest daughter of King Inge the Elder of Sweden. His elder brother Inge was killed in a riding accident, leaving Magnus as the sole heir to Niels. He grew up to be a tall and strong young man, a head taller than anyone else. The chronicles give different opinions about his character, depending on their political preferences. The near-contemporary &quot;Roskilde Chronicle&quot; calls him merry and generous and a &quot;lover of firmness in character&quot;. Saxo Grammaticus, on the other hand, says that he was well endowed by nature but still a violent brute.

== The road to kingship ==

When Margaret&#x27;s first cousin King Inge the Younger died at an unknown time in the 1120s, Magnus claimed the throne as the eldest grandson of Inge the Elder. According to the chronicler Saxo Grammaticus, Magnus was recognized by the Geats (&quot;Götarna&quot;) of Götaland, but the prerogatives of selecting a king traditionally lay with the Swedes, another tribe to the north of the Geats. 

The brief chronicle incorporated in the Westrogothic law does not mention Magnus, but does say that following the death of Inge, the Swedes had selected Ragnvald Knaphövde. Ragnvald showed disrespect towards the Geats by not giving hostages when riding his tour of installation. In retaliation, Ragnvald was murdered by the Geatish population, an event sometimes dated to c. 1129. After this, the law-speaker of Västergötland, Karl of Edsvära, governed his province around this time and is occasionally known in the sources as jarl or even &quot;king&quot;.

Saxo does not mention Ragnvald by name, but mentions that the Swedes elected a king in response to the election of Magnus, and claims that he was killed by the Geats, and that &quot;at his death, power was transferred to Magnus&quot;. Magnus is not mentioned as king in any Swedish king-list, leaving a question-mark around his actual sphere of power.

== Reign ==

The few sources from this period indicate that Christianity was still not implemented everywhere. The Kalmar Crusade was conducted toward the Pagan province of Småland in 1123. The bishop of Uppsala, Siwardus, was appointed by the archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen in 1123 but forced to flee &quot;by pagans&quot; in 1130. Another bishop, Henry, was then appointed in Sigtuna by the Danish Archbishop Asser, and appears as a strong supporter of Magnus. The alterations also indicate the clerical rivalry between Hamburg-Bremen and the Danish archbishopric. There is also a story in Saxo&#x27;s chronicle that Magnus at one time undertook a belated Viking expedition to a part of Sweden, and brought back a few heavy Thor&#x27;s Hammers which he had robbed on a holy island. The still insufficiently Christianized Swedes henceforth saw him as a temple defiler who had robbed the gods.

Around 1127, Magnus married Richeza, daughter of Boleslaw III of Poland. The couple had two sons, Canute (born 1129, later to become king of Denmark) and Niels (born 1130). In 1130, Magnus backed Boleslaw III in conquering Rügen. The Polish forces together with a Danish fleet compelled the Rani to recognize Polish rule over the island.

== Civil war in Denmark ==

In 1131, Magnus had his cousin and potential rival for the Danish throne, Canute Lavard, murdered. After this deed he had to return to Götaland, where he was still recognised as king. Though he was eventually backed by Niels, Magnus found himself in a civil war against Lavard&#x27;s half-brother Eric Emune. The civil war weakened Magnus&#x27;s position in Sweden. The Swedes chose a landowner from Östergötland, Sverker I, to be their king. According to Saxo&#x27;s chronology of events this happened around 1132.

Magnus and his father Niels eventually engaged the enemy in the Battle of Fotevik in Scania on 4 June 1134. According to Saxo, Niels panicked and fled when Eric approached, but Magnus confronted his adversaries with a small troop of determined followers. &quot;He preferred death to escape in order not to eclipse his old reputation for courage. Finally, when he had fought rashly and killed many enemies, he fell over the heap of corpses that had piled up around him.&quot; After the decisive defeat, Niels escaped with his ships but was killed later the same year.

== Legacy ==

After Magnus&#x27;s death, his widow Richeza returned to the other side of the Baltic Sea where she married Volodar of Minsk, a Rurikid ruler of Viking origins. She later returned to Sweden and thirdly married the man who defeated Magnus, King Sverker I.

Magnus&#x27;s son, Canute V, contested the Danish throne with his second cousin, Svend III. When Canute died in 1157, Magnus&#x27;s legitimate descent became extinct. Canute&#x27;s elder son Niels died in 1180. Canute&#x27;s illegitimate posthumous son, Valdemar, bishop of Schleswig and prince-archbishop of Bremen, died in 1236 as the last direct male descendant of King Magnus.

<text>Nick Brennan is a British cartoonist who works mainly for D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd. He started drawing for the company in 1993, drawing a revival of Peter Piper from &quot;The Dandy&quot;, revived from The Magic Comic, but with a departure from Watkins&#x27; creation, with Peter instead sporting an Elvis-like hairdo and purple jumper.&lt;br&gt;

January 1994 saw his next work Blinky, a revamp of the nephew of Colonel Blink from &quot;The Beezer&quot; who had first appeared in the merged Beezer and Topper in 1990.&lt;br&gt;

In 1997, Nick drew a comic strip for a vote for &quot;The Beano&quot; which was called &quot;Crazy for Daisy&quot;, and, along with Tim Traveller by Vic Neill, won the vote, followed by another strip, Pinky&#x27;s Crackpot Circus, in 2004, and in 2006, a revival of &quot;Brassneck&quot; and &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot;. These last three are all from &quot;The Dandy&quot;. He also drew Sneaker for &quot;The Dandy&quot; plus a number of other less well-known characters such as Frawg. In the 2000s, Nick occasionally ghosted Nicky Nutjob, and contributed to the Fun Size Dandy/Fun Size Beano comics. In addition, he was the artist for Billy Whizz in &quot;The Beano&quot; from autumn 2009 until 2012.&lt;br&gt;

Nick Brennan appeared a few times in The Dandy after its October 2010 revamp drawing Watch this Space and Professor Cheese&#x27;s Olympic Wheezes. Reprints of Blinky, Pinky&#x27;s Crackpot Circus, Brassneck and Sneaker were also used during 2012. In the final print edition of &quot;The Dandy&quot;, Nick drew Blinky, Peter Piper and Pinky&#x27;s Crackpot Circus. A reprint of Hyde and Shriek was also used.&lt;br&gt;

In the relaunched &quot;Digital Dandy&quot;, Nick produced Blinky and Sneaker with both stories being animated by his wife, Fran.&lt;br&gt;

Nick&#x27;s work appears in the Dandy Annual each year.&lt;br&gt;

His work also includes Beano comic character, Stevie Star, and cartoon illustrations and animations for Beano Studios and the Beano for Schools projects featuring Dennis the Menace, Gnasher, Minnie the Minx and a host of other &quot;Beano&quot; faves.&lt;br&gt;

In addition to comic work, Nick undertakes private and commercial commissions and has run cartoon workshops for events such as The Art of Stories at the Eden Project. &lt;br&gt;

In collaboration with Fran, Nick also creates occasional fun and immersive/interactive three-dimensional digital cartoon dioramas, which can be experienced in WebXR, AR and VR.&lt;br&gt;

<doc id="917024" wikidata="Q313991" url="?curid=917024" title="Peter Weibel">
<text>Peter Weibel ( ; 5 March 1944 – 1 March 2023) was an Austrian post-conceptual artist, curator, and new media theoretician. He started out in 1964 as a visual poet, then later moved from the page to the screen within the sense of post-structuralist methodology. His work includes virtual reality and other digital art forms. From 1999 he was the director of the ZKM Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe.

==Biography==
Weibel was born in Odesa, USSR on 5 March 1944. He was raised in Ried, Upper Austria, and studied French and cinematography in Paris. In 1964 he began to study medicine in Vienna, but changed soon to mathematics, with an emphasis on logic.

Weibel&#x27;s work was in conceptual art, performance, experimental film, video art, and computer art.

Beginning in 1965 from semiotic and linguistic reflections (Austin, Jakobson, Peirce, Wittgenstein), Weibel developed an artistic language, which led him from experimental literature to performance. In his performative actions, he explored not only the &quot;media&quot; language and body, but also film, video, television, audiotape and interactive electronic environments. Critically he analyzed their function for the construction of reality. Besides taking part in happenings with members of the Vienna Actionism, he developed from 1967 (together with Valie Export, Ernst Schmidt Jr. and Hans Scheugl) an &quot;expanded cinema&quot; inspired by the American one and reflects the ideological and technological conditions of cinematic representation. Weibel elaborated on these reflections, from 1969, in his video tapes and installations. With his television action &quot;tv und vt works&quot;, which was broadcast by the Austrian Television (ORF) in 1972, he transcended the borders of the gallery space and queried video technology in its application as a mass medium. In 1966 he was with Gustav Metzger, Otto Muehl, Wolf Vostell, Hermann Nitsch and others a participant of the Destruction in Art Symposium (&quot;DIAS&quot;) in London.

Weibel worked using a variety of materials, forms and techniques: text, sculpture, installation, film and video. In 1978 he turned to music. Together with Loys Egg, he founded the band &quot;Hotel Morphila Orchester&quot; (orchestra). In the mid-1980s, he explored the possibilities of computer-aided video processing. Beginning of the 1990s he realized interactive computer-based installations. 

In his lectures and articles, Weibel commented on contemporary art, media history, media theory, film, video art and philosophy. As theoretician and curator, he pleaded for a form of art and art history that includes history of technology and history of science. In his function as a university professor and director of institutions like the Ars Electronica (in Linz, Austria), the Institute for New Media in Frankfurt and the ZKM Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe, he influenced the European Scene of the so-called computer art through conferences, exhibitions and publications.

In early May 2022, during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Weibel advocated for parts of Ukraine, then under de facto Russian control, and Transnistria to be internationally recognized to allow Ukraine to reach some sort of agreement with the Russian Federation.

Weibel died in Karlsruhe, Germany on 1 March 2023, at the age of 78.

==Research and teaching==

From 1976, Weibel taught at various institutions, including the Universität für Angewandte Kunst in Vienna, in 1981 at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, and, from 1982-85 at the &quot;Gesamthochschule Kassel&quot;. In 1984 he was appointed to teach for five years as Associate Professor for Video and Digital Arts at the Center for Media Study at the State University of New York in Buffalo, New York. The same year, 1984 he became Professor for visual media at the Universität für Angewandte Kunst in Vienna. In 1989 he was assigned to set up the Institute for New Media at the Städelschule in Frankfurt, which he headed until 1994. From 1993 to 1999 he curated the Austrian pavilion at the Venice Biennale, after which took on curatorship and directorship at KMZ Arts and Media Centre in Karlsruhe, Germany.

== Curatorial activities ==

From 1986 Weibel worked as artistic advisor for the Ars Electronica, which he then headed from 1992 until 1995 as its artistic director. From 1993 to 1999, he curated the pavilion of Austria on the Venice Biennial. In the same period, from 1993 to 1999, he worked as chief curator at the &quot;Neue Galerie am Landesmuseum Joanneum&quot; in Graz, Austria. Since January 1999 Peter Weibel has been Chairman and CEO of the ZKM Center for Art and Media in Karlsruhe, Germany.

<doc id="917038" wikidata="Q5192510" url="?curid=917038" title="Cuddles and Dimples">
<text>Cuddles and Dimples is a British comic strip published in the comic book magazine &quot;The Dandy&quot;. It was first published in 1986. The stories&#x27; protagonists are two toddler brothers who like to cause double the trouble wherever they go. The artist when the strip first started was Barrie Appleby, who continued until 2004 with a strip by Gordon Bell in the 1994 annual and a sole strip by Nigel Parkinson in 2003, who took over the strip next year as part of the revamp at that time.

==History of the comic==

Cuddles and Dimples actually started out as two separate strips. While Dimples started out in &quot;The Dandy&quot; on 27 October 1984, Cuddles had already been in &quot;Nutty&quot; since March 1981. When &quot;Nutty&quot; merged with &quot;The Dandy&quot; in 1985, Cuddles did not follow, instead becoming the cover character of &quot;Hoot&quot;. &quot;Hoot&quot; combined with &quot;The Dandy&quot; the following year, and the first &quot;Cuddles and Dimples&quot; story showed Cuddles&#x27; family moving to Dandytown, where he met Dimples. This took place in issue 2345, dated 1 November 1986. By late 1987, without explanation, one set of parents disappeared (Cuddles&#x27;), and the toddlers were said to be twins. Grounds for this change had been somewhat prepared previously by a short-lived spin-off strip called &quot;That&#x27;s Our Granny&quot; which established that the two boys shared a grandmother.

For many years, the characters appeared in the centre pages (with full colour) of &quot;The Dandy&quot;. When they first appeared, they appeared in pages 16 and 17 of the then 20-page comic with red and black as the only colours.

The characters took over the front page of &quot;The Dandy&quot; from issue 3008 (July 1999) until October 2000, when they got &#x27;thrown out&#x27; for misbehaving too much (in reality, readers wanted Desperate Dan back on the cover). They were both preceded and succeeded on the cover by Desperate Dan.
By the time of the revamp in October 2004, Cuddles and Dimples were assigned to Nigel Parkinson to freshen up their look (prior to the new look, the strip had been reprinted since early 2004). Dimples was made the older brother and now has a patch of Brown Hair. He also became vaguely intelligent. Cuddles look was toned down from the grotesque little monster he was before, and was made the younger, more naive and disgusting brother. Both of them appeared slightly less childish; for example, they no longer called their parents &quot;Mumsie and Daddums&quot;, instead calling them Mum and Dad. Their parents were also revamped, dad being a pot-bellied balding idiot and mum an up-to-date babe or a yummy mummy. The strip was axed with &quot;The Dandy&quot;″s revamp in October 2010; however, they returned in reprints from February 2012 onwards.

<doc id="917039" wikidata="Q8047432" url="?curid=917039" title="Yale Series of Younger Poets">
<text>The Yale Series of Younger Poets is an annual event of Yale University Press aiming to publish the debut collection of a promising American poet. Established in 1918, the Younger Poets Prize is the longest-running annual literary award in the United States.

Each year, the Younger Poets Competition accepts submissions from American poets who have not previously published a book of poetry. Once the judge has chosen a winner, the Press publishes a book-length manuscript of the winner&#x27;s poetry as the next volume in the series. All poems must be original, and only one manuscript may be entered at a time.

==Rules and eligibility==
Contest requirements were first articulated in the summer of 1920. The series had already published four books, all written by Yale students, and the judges sought to attract a nationwide pool of applicants. A promotional statement gave the following, somewhat vague eligibility requirements: &quot;Anyone is eligible provided he (or she) is young and comparatively unknown. The age limit is understood to be about thirty.&quot; A formal set of rules was adopted in 1924. In addition to specifying page limits and other manuscript requirements, these new rules limited the contest to American citizens younger than 30. However, current rules allow poets of any age who have not published a book of poetry to be considered. Although the contest was briefly opened to any writer of English-language poetry under Auden&#x27;s judgeship, it has remained limited to American citizens ever since.

==History==
===20th century===

The Younger Poets Series was established in 1919 by Clarence Day, whose brother George Parmly Day founded Yale University Press with his wife Wilhelmine in 1908. The competition&#x27;s first judge, Charlton Miner Lewis, was a prominent professor in Yale&#x27;s English department. The inaugural competition took place after the end of World War I, just as an influx of young veterans returned from fighting in Europe and entered college. Modernist poetry emerged in this period, but early entries in the series reflected the neoclassical tastes of the older generation adjudicating the competition, all men who had received degrees from Yale in the late-19th century. The anglophilic publishers were heavily influenced by English poetry, especially the contemporary Georgian poetry, and the competition itself was directly influenced by the similar &quot;Adventures All&quot; poetry series of Oxford University Press.

The contest solidified its importance in American literature under the judgeship of Stephen Vincent Benét. Benet was judge from 1933 to 1942, followed by Archibald MacLeish from 1944 to 1946. Margaret Walker&#x27;s &quot;For My People&quot; was the last volume selected by Benet. Auden assumed the judgeship after MacLeish. 

The contest is regarded by some to have been at its height from 1947 to 1959, when W. H. Auden was its judge. His then-young poets included Adrienne Rich, James Wright, W. S. Merwin, John Ashbery, and John Hollander. The period was also notable for the two-time refusal of Sylvia Plath&#x27;s manuscript &quot;Two Lovers&quot;, and &quot;Colossus&quot;, which was subsequently published in England. 

Between 1969 and 1977, overseen by Stanley Kunitz, included volumes by Carolyn Forché and Robert Hass; Hass later became the Poet Laureate of the United States.

===21st century===
The judgeship of W. S. Merwin, from 1998 to 2003, was fraught with controversy, as he refused to select a winner the first year that he was judge. Louise Glück, who is widely considered to have revived the prize&#x27;s stature, judged the award from 2003 to 2010. Rae Armantrout is the current judge.

<text>Matthew Lee Cappotelli (November 12, 1979 – June 29, 2018) was an American professional wrestler. After co-winning &quot;Tough Enough III&quot; with John Hennigan, he worked in Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), the primary developmental territory for WWE. He ended his career due to a malignant brain tumor.

== Professional wrestling career ==
Cappotelli, along with John Hennigan, won a World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) contract by winning &quot;Tough Enough III&quot;. During the show Hardcore Holly aggressively roughed up Matt while training, stiffly striking Cappotelli repeatedly, leaving him bleeding. After winning, he made sporadic appearances on WWE shows. At Vengeance, Cappotelli competed in The APA Invitational Bar Room Brawl which Bradshaw won.

Cappotelli was then sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). There, he formed a tag team known as The Thrill Seekers with Johnny Jeter. On November 9 at an OVW television taping, Cappotelli captured the OVW Heavyweight Championship by defeating his former tag team partner, Johnny Jeter. On February 8, 2006, he announced that he had previously been diagnosed with a grade 2/3 astrocytoma and surrendered the title to OVW owner Danny Davis at a television taping in Louisville, Kentucky. Cappotelli announced to OVW wrestlers and fans on April 4, 2006, that he would undergo surgery for brain cancer in Boston on May 1. WWE&#x27;s official website later reported that the surgery was a success, and that the majority of the brain tumor was removed. He was released from his contract in January 2009.
Toward the end of 2013, Cappotelli became the trainer for OVW&#x27;s Beginner Program.

==Personal life and death==
Cappotelli attended college at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, Michigan, where he was also a member of the football team.
Cappotelli was married to Lindsay. They resided in Louisville, Kentucky, where he also worked as a personal trainer. He was close friends with professional wrestler and Western Michigan alumnus, Colt Cabana. &quot;Big Brother&quot; winner Lisa Donahue was his cousin.
In July 2017, Cappotelli announced that he was diagnosed with grade IV glioblastoma multiforme. In May 2018, Cappotelli&#x27;s wife announced that, after consultations with his neuro-oncologist, Cappotelli was ceasing medical interventions for the tumor. He died on June 29, 2018, at the age of 38.

<doc id="917041" wikidata="Q1510436" url="?curid=917041" title="Mulanje Massif">
<text>The Mulanje Massif, also known as Mount Mulanje, is a large inselberg in southern Malawi. Sapitwa Peak, the highest point on the massif at 3,002 m, is the highest point in Malawi. It lies 65 km east of Blantyre, rising sharply from the surrounding plains of Phalombe and the Mulanje district. It forms part of a proposed ecoregion, to be called the South East Africa Montane Archipelago (SEAMA).

==Geography==
Much of the massif consists of rolling grassland at elevations of 1800–2200 m, intersected by deep forested ravines. It has many individual peaks reaching heights of over 2500 m, including Chambe Peak, the West Face of which is the longest rock climb in Africa.

The massif was formed by the intrusion of magma into the Earth&#x27;s crust about 130 million years ago. The surrounding rock eroded away over time, leaving behind the erosion-resistant igneous rock of the Mulanje Massif. The first European to report seeing the massif was David Livingstone in 1859, but archeological investigation reveals evidence of human visits to the massif from the Stone Age onwards. The elevation of the mountain is high enough for it to disturb upper level air flow and induce rain clouds to form around it, making it an important source of rain water at the head of almost every river that runs through this part of Malawi.

The forested slopes of the massif support a sizeable timber industry. At one time there was a cableway to transport timber from the edge of the plateau down to the Likhubula Forestry Station but it fell into disrepair and currently planks are carried down manually.

The mountain itself is part of the protected Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve. The native Mulanje cypress (&quot;Widdringtonia whytei&quot;) has been so heavily logged that it is considered endangered and the park contains the last remaining stands of this tree, as well as a number of other plant and animal species—many of them endemic to the area. Examples include forest butterflies, birds such as the cholo alethe and white-winged apalis, a dwarf chameleon, geckos, skinks, the squeaker frog, and a rare limbless burrowing skink species. The land around the park is threatened by growing population, land use patterns such as forest clearing for farming and firewood, and invasive species such as golden Himalayan raspberry &quot;(Rubus ellipticus)&quot; and Mexican weeping pine &quot;(Pinus patula)&quot;.

The massif is popular for hiking and climbing, and has several mountain huts scattered across it which are maintained by the Malawi Mountain Club and the Malawi Forestry Department. Sapitwa peak was first climbed in 1894, and is now the most popular climb on the plateau.

In 2014 the site was unsuccessfully nominated for World Heritage Status.

==The human history of the Mulanje Area==
According to Chewa legend, the people living in Malawi before their arrival were the Akafula.

Although yet to be found on Mulanje, rock art has been discovered on the nearby hills at Machemba and Mikolongwe. Recent work by the Catholic University has unearthed tool-making sites along the Thuchila shelf dating back to the Middle Stone Age, some 100,000 years ago.

The main Bantu immigration came from the Congo Basin in the 1600s, with the Mang&#x27;anja people settling in a number of sites around the Mulanje Area. These were peaceful people who built a livelihood from the soil and local natural resources. There was contact with the outside world through the coastal Arabs and Portuguese, and Yao traders who brought in goods to exchange for ivory and slaves.

The peacefulness came to an end with the migration of Yao people from the north-east towards the south shore of Lake Malawi (then Lake Nyasa) and highland areas of Malawi in the 1800s, escaping from their own internal tribal strife. With the strong coastal demand, slave raiding into the Mang&#x27;anja villages sharply increased and the settlements were often scattered. This situation was noted by David Livingstone when he travelled into this area in the middle of the nineteenth century.

Livingstone&#x27;s call for help in ending the slave trade brought Scottish missionaries and settlers into the area who established themselves by setting up a mission on the slopes of the mountain and in estate agriculture, respectively. Despite attempts at developing an amicable relationship, conflict with the Yao increased and this soon led to violence. By the 1890s, the British had seen the need to establish a protectorate and they set up a military administration at the north of the mountain at Fort Lister and to the south at Fort Anderson. The staffing of these forts with Indian soldiers started Malawi&#x27;s now longstanding links with the Indian sub-continent.

From this time, there were also inward migrations of the Lomwe people from the Portuguese east, escaping both colonial and Yao strife, who largely settled among the European estates and the Catholic missions. This immigration has continued to recent times during the Mozambican independence and civil wars.

Today, these three tribal cultures continue to live around the Mountain in one of the highest rural population densities in Africa. Although there is territorial distinction through their tribal traditional authorities, there is a widespread intermixing of the peoples.

European settlement flourished to develop the extensive tea estates that represent the first significant cultivation of this crop outside its countries of origin. The missions also continue to expand their services in education and primary health care.

== Climate ==

The climate of the larger Mulanje area is strongly influenced by the equatorial low pressure area, where the north-east trades of the Northern Hemisphere converge with the south-east trades of the Southern Hemisphere. This area is known as the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). On satellite Images the ITCZ is mostly seen as a long band of clouds in the Equatorial region, the main effect of the ITCZ is the creation of dry and rainy seasons in the Equatorial area.

The Mulanje Massif, because its unique position as a “mountain island” rising more than 2,500 metres above the surrounding plains, is strongly affected by the ITCZ, acting as a rain barrier. This becomes very visible when comparing the annual normal rainfalls, on and around the massif. The plateau level, at around 2,000 metres above sea level, annually experiences more than 2500 mm (100 inches) of rain, however, in the low plains around the foot of the massif, the annual rainfalls range around 40 inches. In the plains around the mountain it normally only rains in the rainy season, while it rains year round on the plateau level.
There are still differences in the amounts of rain around the massif. The south-west face of the mountain around Likhubula, Lichenya and Mulanje Boma is the windward side. This experiences the highest amounts of rain due to the south-east trades of the southern hemisphere that drive the moist air from Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo into the Mulanje region. The north-west face of the massif experiences lesser rains, due to a rain-shadow effect.

The months of the dry season (May–August) are the coolest months of the year and most suitable for hiking in the massif. The wet season (November–April) is not recommended for hiking in the massif, as the hiker faces heavy rains on the plateau and high temperatures during the ascent.
Snow is a very rare event. Brief snowfalls are possible but the last major snowfall with ground accumulation was in June 1954.
== The Mulanje cedar ==
The Mulanje cedar (&quot;Widdringtonia whytei&quot;) was proclaimed the National Tree of Malawi in 1984 by the late president Hastings Banda. This tall tree, &quot;W. whytei&quot;, was named after Alexander Whyte, a colonial government botanist in Nyasaland. The species was first described in 1894 and it is only found on Mount Mulanje (and Mchese Mountain, depending on if that population is considered conspecific). Scientists disagree about whether this is a distinct species or a giant form of the other cedar found on the mountain, &quot;W. nodiflora&quot;, which is common across Southern Africa. The cedar forests on Mulanje were estimated in 2004 to have been reduced to a total area of 8.5 km2, half of the estimated original forest cover. This area may have been diminished as a result of continued illegal cutting.

&quot;W. whytei&quot; is a large evergreen tree, growing up to 40–50 m tall, whereas &quot;W. nodiflora&quot; is more rounded, with a lower canopy height. On the mountain, the Mulanje cedar is limited to altitudes between 1,800-2,550 m and is normally confined to hollows and valleys where there is some protection from fire.

Cedar timber is pale red, straight grained and pleasantly fragrant. Its major qualities are that it is worked easily and is extremely durable, being naturally resistant to attacks from termites, wood-boring insects and fungi. The sap is poisonous to insects. For these reasons, the timber achieved commercial significance from the 1940s onward, as described by Laurens van der Post in his book &quot;Venture to the Interior&quot;, becoming a principal resource for building and woodworking. As of 2010 the timber is most used in the making of local arts and crafts, fishing boats for Lake Malawi, and in the construction and decoration of many prestigious buildings.
As the demand for its timber is high, the tree is under threat of extinction. Mulanje cedar is a pioneer species, not a climax species, meaning that it is good at taking advantage of sites that become free of other competing species but it is less successful in open competition. When fire destroys the trees in an area of woodland, Mulanje cedar will normally be the first tree species to re-establish itself. Other species will come in later, but because the cedar is relatively fast growing, it will not face much competition for sunlight.

The Malawi Department of Forestry is responsible for protecting the cedar forests from damaging fires. Each year, at the beginning of the dry season, firebreaks are cleared of vegetation to provide barriers that will impede the advance of wildfires. In addition, controlled early burning is carried out to reduce the build-up of combustible material that might cause intense and damaging fires later in the dry season. For further safety, gangs equipped with fire-fighting equipment are stationed on each of the main plateau areas whenever there is a fire hazard. 
As well as providing protection from fires, the Department of Forestry is responsible for controlling the use of the trees for timber. In the past the department issued annual sawing licences but, due to a sharp increase in illegal harvesting, the sawing season has been closed since 2007. However, the illegal market for cedar is strong and cedar harvesting has not yet been stopped. All cedar wood sawn after 2007 is illegal wood, and can be confiscated by the Department of Forestry and the Malawi Police. In 2010 there was a significant increase in law-enforcement action involving armed forestry teams patrolling the cedar forests to stop the illegal pit sawyers.

There has also been a substantial planting programme to reforest Mulanje cedar seedlings in the plastic-covered greenhouses that can be seen across the mountain. In the 2008/09 rainy season, nurseries were established on the mountain to raise over 50,000 seedlings that were then planted out with an estimated survival rate of over 30%. In the 2009/10 season, nursery plans were to raise more than 20,000 seedlings, with an improved planting-out strategy to ensure an even higher success rate.

Conservation of the cedars is not secure. In 2010 the Mulanje Mountain Conservation Trust (MMCT) claimed the species would probably be extinct by 2020. Mulanje cedar was first assessed as &#x27;endangered&#x27; in 1997, and again in 1998, by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It was re-assessed as &#x27;critically endangered&#x27; by the IUCN in 2011, wherein the assessor, Aljos Farjon, based on the 2004 data, stated that the species would experience a population reduction of 80% by 2030. In 2019 it was again assessed as &#x27;critically endangered&#x27;, with the authors claiming that there were fewer than 50 mature trees left, and blaming this on foreign export. They make this claim based on the area being near the border, what they claim is bad policing by Malawi, and their claim that the wood is not used or sold in Malawi. Despite these assertions, the Malawi government and partners such as the MMCT have planted some 250,000 seedlings each year for the past few years as of 2019 (see previous paragraph). In addition to the risk of losing this tree, there is also the potential loss of the other endemic plant and animal species that inhabit these unique forests.

==Visiting Mulanje==
Mulanje offers excellent hiking and climbing. The plateau is accessed in 3 to 6 hours by one of several trails. From the plateau, numerous peaks can be climbed. Several huts are maintained by the Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve and the Mountain Club of Malawi and offer rustic accommodation to hikers and climbers. These include Sombani, Chinzama, Minunu, Tuchila, Chombe, Lychenya, and others. The highest peak, Sapitwa, is best accessed from the Chisepo hut.

<text>The Independent Democratic Action () is a political party in São Tomé and Príncipe. It was established in 1994 by the then president Miguel Trovoada and is a politically centrist party.

It took part in the 29 July 2001 presidential elections, in which its candidate, Fradique de Menezes, won 55.2% of the vote and was elected president. After the elections Fradique de Menezes joined a new party – the Force for Change Democratic Movement-Liberal Party. In the legislative election held on 3 March 2002, the Independent Democratic Action was the main party in the Uê Kédadji alliance, that won 16.2% of the popular vote and 8 out of 55 seats. It left this alliance and won in the 2006 election 11 out of 55 seats. In the July 2006 presidential election, its leader Patrice Trovoada ran as the only major opposition candidate, but he was defeated by Menezes.

Trovoada became Prime Minister in February 2008, but was defeated in a May 2008 vote of confidence proposed by the Movement for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe/Social Democratic Party (MLSTP/PSD), and in June Menezes asked the MLSTP/PSD to form a new government. The ADI denounced Menezes&#x27; designation of the MLSTP/PSD to form a government as unconstitutional, arguing that it was too late in the parliamentary term to do so, and it took the matter to the Supreme Tribunal of Justice.

Evaristo Carvalho has been the President of São Tomé and Príncipe from 2016 to 2021, after defeating the incumbent President Manuel Pinto da Costa in the 2016 elections. President Carvalho was also Vice president of the ruling Independent Democratic Action party (ADI). Patrice Trovoada was Prime Minister from 2014 to 2018 as the leader of Independent Democratic Action party (ADI).

<doc id="917046" wikidata="Q1147614" url="?curid=917046" title="Ferme générale">
<text>The ferme générale (, &quot;general farm&quot;) was, in &quot;ancien régime&quot; France, essentially an outsourced customs, excise and indirect tax operation. It collected duties on behalf of the King (plus hefty bonus fees for themselves), under renewable six-year contracts. The major tax collectors in that highly unpopular tax farming system were known as the fermiers généraux (singular fermier général), which would be &quot;tax farmers-general&quot; in English.

In the 17th and 18th centuries the &quot;fermiers généraux&quot; became immensely rich and figure prominently in the history of cultural patronage, as supporters of French music, major collectors of paintings and sculpture, patrons of the &quot;marchands-merciers&quot; and consumers of the luxury arts in the vanguard of Parisian fashions. In his 1833 novel &quot;Ferragus&quot;, writer Honoré de Balzac attributes the sad air that hangs about the Île Saint-Louis in central Paris to the many houses there owned by fermiers généraux. Their sons or grandsons purchased patents of nobility and their daughters often married into the aristocracy. Especially members of impoverished aristocratic families were eager to marry daughters of the &quot;fermiers généraux&quot; in order to restore the wealth they had prior to their ruin. This was called in popular French &quot;redorer son blason&quot; (literally &quot;to re-gild one&#x27;s coat of arms&quot;).

==History==
Before the French Revolution in 1789, the public revenue was based largely on the following taxes:
*The &quot;Taille&quot; – Direct land tax imposed on French peasant and non-noble households, based on how much land they held. In some provinces, the principle of &quot;taille réelle&quot; was used, which meant that the tax was based on the actual market value of the real estate. In a majority of provinces the &quot;taille personnelle&quot; was applied: the tax level was the result of an arbitrary and gross estimation of the real estate value. Noblemen, public office holders and the inhabitants of the large cities were exempt from the &quot;taille&quot;.
*The Taillon – Tax for military expenditure.
*The Vingtième (&quot;one-twentieth&quot;) – Based solely on revenue (5 percent of net earnings from land, property, commerce, industry and from official offices).
*The Gabelle – A very complicated system of taxes and outsourced regional monopolies on salt, with enormous price disparities between the different provinces (e.g. the salt price in Paris was thirty times higher than in Brittany) that were a strong enticement to smuggling.
*The Aides – National tariffs on various products, including wine and tobacco.
*The Traites – Custom duties for either the import or export of goods to and from France, or for the transport of goods from one French province to the neighbouring one (internal customs).
*The Octroi – A local tariff levied on products entering the cities, especially Paris.
*The Droits féodaux (feudal rights), a long list of petty duties for every possible event or activity in a peasant&#x27;s life (the right to marry, to inherit, to use the mill, to use the roads of the local aristocrat, to be exempt from doing mandatory chores for the local lord, etc.), to be paid to the local lord, the King or both and generally considered by the peasant to be arbitrary and humiliating.
*The Dîme (&quot;the tenth [part]) – A mandatory tithe to support the state church and its clergy, collected by the local vicars, monks or bishops (and so, not a tax in the legal sense). The &quot;Dîme&quot; had to be paid either in legal tender (money) or in material assets by all residents regardless of their religion.

===Tax farming before Colbert===

The &quot;Ferme générale&quot; developed at a time when the monarchy suffered from chronic financial difficulties. The &quot;Affermage&quot; (leasing, outsourcing) of the collection of the &quot;traite&quot; (customs duties and taxes) had the advantage of guaranteeing the Treasury foreseeable and regular receipts, while reducing the perception of its role in tax-collection. The rights were initially contracted separately to various tax farmers, who were named &quot;traitants&quot; (who had the right to collect the &quot;traite&quot;) or &quot;partisans&quot; (who had a share (&quot;partie&quot;) in the collection of the &quot;traite&quot;). They were obliged to pay to the Royal Treasury the sum stipulated in their lease, and they received a share of the income and a share of any &quot;unexpected&quot; surplus. Each right was leased separately, which caused great administrative complexity: the taking of goods out of bond could involve several tax farms. Prior to 1598, this system had developed so that the tax farms were allocated among five &quot;pays&quot; (parts of France).

In 1598 the Superintendent of Finances, the Duke of Sully, entrusted tax collection to one farm instead of five separate ones, and subjected the collection of duties raised in the provinces to the rights of the King. The single tax farm was called the &quot;Cinq Grosses Fermes&quot; (five large farms). In 1607, he issued new rules (&quot;Règlement Général sur les Traites&quot;) on the collection of duties in an attempt to harmonize procedures. He also attempted to constitute the whole of France into a single customs area, but was without success, as the provinces &quot;considered foreign&quot; (i.e. which became part of France after the foundation of the Kingdom; especially the south and Brittany) refused to merge with the zone covered by the &quot;Cinq Grosses Fermes&quot;. By the middle of the 17th century, France was divided for tax purposes into three principal zones: 
*Provinces of the &quot;Cinq Grosses Fermes&quot; without any internal customs duties (since 1664 by decision of Colbert)
*Provinces &quot;considered foreign&quot; and therefore had negotiated lower rates on some taxes
*Provinces &quot;effectively following the example of the provinces considered foreign&quot; (i.e. the last to become part of France; especially Lorraine and Alsatia) which formed tax-free zones when doing trade with the neighbouring foreign countries.

Not all &quot;fermiers-généraux&quot; constrained their viewpoint to their own enrichment: Pierre-Paul Riquet, appointed collector in Languedoc-Roussillon in 1630, used his fortune to build the Canal du Midi that links the Mediterranean coast of France to Toulouse and then on to the system of canals and rivers that ran across to the Bay of Biscay on the Atlantic coast, considered to be one of the great engineering feats of the 17th century.

===The farm under Colbert: &quot;traitants&quot; and &quot;partisans&quot;===
The process was further developed under the aegis of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Minister of Finance to King Louis XIV. 
To reduce the number of these farmers and to increase the share of the collection transferred to the Royal Treasury, Colbert sought to gather a great number of rights together in &quot;fermes générales&quot; (general farms). The first &quot;fermes générales&quot; was instituted in 1680 to collect &quot;gabelles&quot;, &quot;aides&quot;, &quot;taille&quot; and &quot;douane&quot; .

Although sometimes of obscure origin, the financiers which took these rights often quickly accumulated immense fortunes which enabled them to play a significant political and social role. Their greed and excesses shocked the public and were often turned into objects of ridicule in literature, for example by playwright Alain-René Lesage in his 1709 comedy &quot;Turcaret&quot;, which was inspired by financier Paul Poisson de Bourvallais.

===The &quot;Ferme générale&quot; (1726–90)===

In 1726, all the existing farms were gathered in a single lease. The forty farmers-general, who held guarantees as contractors of the lease, became powerful and fabulously rich. Examples of the first generation of these tax farmers include Antoine Crozat, the first private owner of French Louisiana, the four Pâris brothers, and Alexandre Le Riche de La Poupelinière.

Increased criticism of the &quot;Ferme générale&quot; system led the government to introduce new regulations in 1769, which turned the collection of taxes and the administration of the service to which taxation was entrusted to public organisations, with their managers receiving a fixed remuneration. The public career of the reforming economist Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot began with his appointment in 1761 as &quot;intendant&quot; of the &quot;généralité&quot; of Limoges.

In 1780, at the initiative of Jacques Necker, finance minister to Louis XVI, indirect taxes were distributed between three tax farm companies: the &quot;Ferme générale&quot; (for customs duties), the &quot;Ligue générale&quot; (for taxes on alcohol) and the &quot;Administration générale des domaines et des droits domaniaux&quot; (for land taxes and fees for land registration).

By the end of the 18th century, the &quot;Ferme générale&quot; system became a symbol of an unequal society. The &quot;Ferme générale&quot;, and the great wealth of its proprietors, was seen as encapsulating all the perversions of the political and social system. People blamed the injustices and annoyances – which actually arose from the complexity of the tax system – on the company itself, including the brutality of tax collecting troops and the brutal repression of smuggling. The &quot;gabelle&quot; (tax on salt) was the most unpopular of all the taxes.

The &quot;Ferme générale&quot; was thus one of the institutions of the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; which was most criticised during the 1789 French Revolution. It was depicted as a group of predatory tyrants; the Girondist politician Antoine Français de Nantes, made an early reputation for himself attacking this prominent target. The &quot;Ferme générale&quot; was then suppressed in 1790, with farmers-general paying the price at the scaffold: 28 former members of the consortium were guillotined on 8 May 1794. Among them was Antoine Lavoisier, the father of modern chemistry, whose laboratory had been supported by income from his administration of the &quot;Ferme générale&quot;. His wife, the chemist Marie-Anne Pierrette Paulze, who escaped the guillotine, was herself the daughter of another farmer-general, Jacques Paulze.

===Organisation===

The lease of the &quot;Ferme générale&quot; was regulated by six-year contracts between the King and an individual who acted as a figurehead for the company. The &quot;Ferme générale&quot; held guarantee for the contractor. The number of partners was fixed at 40, after having reached nearly 90 earlier. The contractor committed himself to paying the Royal Treasury the amount of the lease and received in return any surplus. In 1780 an upper limit was set for this remuneration.

The &quot;Ferme générale&quot; had its headquarters in Paris. In its central offices it employed nearly 700 people, including two chaplains. Its local operations included up to 42 provincial offices and nearly 25,000 agents distributed in two branches of activity; that of the offices which checked, liquidated and charged the fees and that of the guards&#x27; brigades which sought and suppressed smuggling with very severe punishments (such as hard labour or hanging).

The employees of the &quot;Ferme générale&quot; were not royal civil servants but they acted in the name of the king, and therefore benefited from particular privileges and the protection of the law. In addition, members of the guards&#x27; brigades had the right to bear weapons. The managing of the company was handled collectively by the &quot;Ferme générale&quot;. They met as committees of experts and had control of the company&#x27;s external services.

The day before the French Revolution in 1789, almost all the rights of indirect drafts and rights (like the &quot;gabelle&quot;, the tax on tobacco, and a number of local taxes) were awarded. On the other hand, the Royal Treasury&#x27;s income from the &quot;Ferme générale&quot; represented more than half of the total public revenue. The company had also built the 24-kilometre Wall of the Farmers-General between 1784 and 1791 in Paris to ensure the payment of taxes on goods entering the city.

==Criticism of tax collection methods==

The &quot;Ferme générale&quot; was one of the most hated components of the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; because of the profits it took at the expense of the state, the secrecy of the terms of its contracts, and the violence of its armed agents. Criticism of the &quot;Ferme générale&quot; also include:
*Public bodies were deprived of a resource
*Service rendered was not always better in the long term
*The cost could be higher for the taxpayer, who paid his taxes plus the margin taken by the &quot;Ferme générale&quot;
*The recovery of debts (of tax arrears) by the &quot;Ferme générale&quot; could be brutal
*Depriving itself of a resource, the community became involved in debt, and had to find new taxes to obtain additional money

Therefore, at the end of the 18th century, the French state had become involved in considerable debt, which factored among the causes of the French Revolution.

==Cultural role of farmers-general==
The farmers-general of the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; figure prominently in the history of cultural patronage in France. The enlightened farmer-general Le Normant de Tournehem was the legal guardian of Madame de Pompadour, responsible for her education - in turn, thanks to her influence, he was made director-general of the &quot;Bâtiments du Roi&quot; in December 1745, and held the post, overseeing royal building works at the King&#x27;s residences in and around Paris, until his death in 1751. As American architect Fiske Kimball observed, “Without artistic prejudices, he was a man of ability, honesty and simplicity, who devoted himself to efficient administration&quot;.

Farmers-general also figured among prominent supporters of French music and collectors of paintings and sculpture, such as Pierre Grimod du Fort, and as patrons of the &quot;marchands-mercier&quot;, a type of merchants who dealt with decorative art objects.

As consumers of luxurious art the farmers-general were at the vanguard of Parisian fashion, like Ange Laurent Lalive de Jully, a patron of arts who embraced the early form of neoclassicist style in decorative arts called the &quot;goût grec&quot; (lit. &quot;Greek taste&quot;). Others merely made themselves notorious for their squander, like Ange Laurent&#x27;s brother Denis Joseph de La Live d&#x27;Épinay, the estranged husband of the writer and &quot;saloniste&quot; Louise d&#x27;Épinay. The gourmand Alexandre Balthazar Laurent Grimod de La Reynière was the son of the farmer-general Laurent Grimod de La Reynière. 
Sons or grandsons of farmer-generals often purchased patents of nobility, with their daughters marrying into aristocracy.

==Voltaire and the &quot;fermiers&quot;==
In his &quot;Voltaire, A Life&quot; (pp. 427–31), Ian Davidson describes events on Voltaire&#x27;s estate at Ferney, north of Geneva, in the 1770s.

In 1770, hundreds of watchmakers fled the political ructions in Geneva and went to make a new life at Ferney. Voltaire helped them to set up a new watchmaking business. He negotiated a tax exemption for the watchmakers with the duc de Choiseul, Prime Minister of France. But by 1774, the business was prospering and the tax farmers started to take an interest. Three-way negotiations between the tax farmers, Voltaire and Turgot ensued. In December 1775, Turgot confirmed the watchmakers&#x27; exemption from the salt tax (&quot;gabelle&quot;) and from road maintenance duties (&quot;corvée&quot;) and a figure was agreed to compensate the tax farmers for loss of revenue. Voltaire addressed a public meeting on 12 December and the watchmakers accepted the settlement.

Two days later, Voltaire wrote to his friend Mme de Saint-Julien:

&quot;... while we were gently passing our time in thanking M. Turgot, and while the whole province was busy drinking, the gendarmes of the tax farmers, whose time runs out on 1 January, had orders to sabotage us. They marched about in groups of fifty, stopped all the vehicles, searched all the pockets, forced their way into all the houses and made every kind of damage there in the name of the king, and made the peasants buy them off with money. I cannot conceive why the people did not ring the tocsin against them in all the villages, and why they were not exterminated. It is very strange that the &quot;ferme générale&quot;, with only another fortnight left for them to keep their troops here in winter quarters, should have permitted or even encouraged them in such criminal excesses. The decent people were very wise and held back the ordinary folk, who wanted to throw themselves on these brigands, as if on mad wolves.&quot;

According to Davidson, good sense prevailed despite this violence, Voltaire was appointed a tax commissioner, profits peaked in 1776 and the watchmaking business survived the revolution and continued &quot;well into the nineteenth century&quot;.

<text>Barney Boko was a British comic strip series, drawn by John R. Mason, which was published in the British comics magazine &quot;The Dandy&quot; from 1937 to 1944. It was about a tramp whose incredibly long nose could be used for anything, from a Christmas tree to a bridge. It ran for seven years from the first issue in December 1937.

<text>&quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; is a 1996–97 crossover story arc among comic book series published by the American company Marvel Comics. During this one-year, multi-title story arc, Marvel temporarily outsourced the production of several of its best-known comic books to the studios of artists Jim Lee and Rob Liefeld, who had been among Marvel&#x27;s most popular artists before leaving to form independent companies.

==Publication history==
&quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; was an attempt by Marvel to address low sales on some of its titles. While &quot;Spider-Man&quot; and &quot;X-Men&quot;-related titles sold well, as did some titles under the horror-themed &quot;Midnight Sons&quot; imprint like &quot;Ghost Rider&quot;, reader interest was comparatively poor on &quot;Avengers&quot; and &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;. Marvel conceived of an experiment to outsource production for titles with lagging sales to two former Marvel artists Jim Lee and Rob Liefeld, who had left the publisher four years earlier to form Image Comics, and who still enjoyed great popularity among the comics-buying public. The two creators would launch four new titles, with Jim Lee&#x27;s WildStorm Productions producing &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; and &quot;Iron Man&quot;, and Rob Liefeld&#x27;s Extreme Studios handling &quot;Captain America&quot; and &quot;The Avengers&quot;. These books would be set in a new continuity. In-story, it would be explained that these characters had been accidentally transported into a &quot;pocket universe&quot; separate from the main Marvel universe by Franklin Richards, during a battle with the supervillain Onslaught.

While the rest of the world believed these characters had died, they in fact were now in a new universe, essentially &quot;reborn&quot;, without any memory of their past universe, which allowed Lee and Liefeld to establish new, revised origin stories for modern readers. For example, Ben Grimm fought as a pilot in the Gulf War instead of World War II, with Susan Storm and Johnny Storm being explained to have been financial backers for Reed Richards&#x27; rocket, hence their presence on the mission. In addition, while Richards&#x27; goal of becoming the first man to get to Mars remained, it was revealed that he secretly aimed to explore the interstellar anomalies of that area.

Marvel ended Liefeld&#x27;s contract early after six issues, citing low sales on his two titles, which were reassigned to Lee. Walt Simonson took over &quot;Avengers&quot; when it moved to WildStorm. Although the four titles in &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; were slated for a 12-issue run, James Robinson wrote a thirteenth and final issue for each book. The storyline, entitled &quot;World War III&quot;, was a crossover between the Marvel and WildStorm characters.

At the end of the storyline, which lasted one year, WildStorm&#x27;s agreement with Marvel ended, at which point the Fantastic Four and Avengers were returned to the mainstream Marvel Universe, again through the intervention of Franklin Richards, in the storyline &quot;Heroes Return&quot;, which included a central miniseries &quot;Heroes Reborn: The Return&quot;, by writer Peter David and artist Salvador Larocca.

==Promotion==
To promote the &quot;Captain America&quot; series, Liefeld produced a piece of promo art depicting that character, which became one of the most famous and mocked illustrations from that period of Liefeld&#x27;s career. The artwork depicted Captain America with &quot;cartoonish proportions&quot;, in particular his stomach, arms, and &quot;gaping barrel chest&quot;, as Comic Book Resources (CBR) put it. Referred to by Comics Beat as &quot;the most infamous piece of art in comics history,&quot; Timothy Donohoo of CBR observed that the artwork &quot;showcases the extreme and many times highly unrealistic anatomy seen in the comics of the era&quot;, and came to be viewed as emblematic of Liefeld&#x27;s artwork as a whole. The image went on to become an internet meme, and was included in critical articles such as &quot;The 40 Worst Rob Liefeld Drawings&quot;, &quot;A Gallery of Rob Liefeld&#x27;s Anatomical Abominations&quot; and &quot;Worst Rob Liefeld Covers&quot;, earning Liefeld his status as one of the industry&#x27;s most controversial comics artists. Liefeld poked fun at the matter in 2016, tweeting, &quot;Of course I&#x27;m #teamcap. I didn&#x27;t give him those big tits for nuthin…&quot; He revisited the illustration in September 2023, with a New York Comic Con variant cover for &quot;Captain America&quot; (vol. 10) #1, depicting the Sam Wilson incarnation of the character in the same pose. Posting the image on Twitter, Liefeld commented, &quot;Had to get something off my chest.&quot; In October 2023 the original 1996 artwork was put up for auction with Heritage Auctions, the second time it had been made so available. On November 17, the final piece was auctioned for $132,000 USD.

==Reception==
All of the titles experienced a large upsurge in sales. According to Lee, Marvel proposed continuing the Heroes Reborn lineup indefinitely, but under the condition that Lee would draw at least one of them. Lee refused.

Critically, the storyline was not well-received. The changes to the characters were controversial, provoking debates among fans. The change in creative team on &quot;Captain America&quot; was also controversial, since the pre-Heroes Reborn team of Mark Waid and Ron Garney had already been bringing increased sales and critical acclaim to the series, prompting the question of why it had required a reboot by Liefeld, whose artwork on the title was heavily criticized for its poor anatomy and skill, so much so that it has been subject to parody.

==&quot;Heroes Return&quot;==
The &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; was followed by &quot;Heroes Return&quot;, which consisted of a central, four-issue miniseries, &quot;Heroes Reborn: The Return&quot;, by writer Peter David and artist Salvador Larocca (December 1997). In the story, the Celestials take notice of Franklin&#x27;s pocket universe and initially demand that he eliminate one of the two universes, but eventually relent on the condition that all beings native to Earth-616 evacuate the pocket universe and never return.

The heroes are gathered in a massive ship to leave the pocket universe. Characters including She-Hulk and several members of the Inhuman Royal Family are depicted as returning heroes, even though they were not among the missing heroes from &quot;Onslaught: Marvel Universe&quot;. Though it was later mentioned that these versions of them merged with their regular counterparts.

As the heroes travel to their destination, Dr. Doom suddenly escapes the ship with Franklin, hoping to use the siphoning devices he created to steal Franklin&#x27;s power, but is stopped by Mr. Fantastic and Thor, who rescue the boy. Thor uses his hammer to create a portal, trapping himself and Doom in it.

As soon as the remaining heroes break the boundaries between the two worlds, they all suddenly remember their past lives. Bruce Banner and the Hulk are merged back together into one singular being. The returned Anthony Stark possesses the memories of both the original and teenage Anthony Stark, and thus considers himself to be essentially both of them.

The pocket universe was then placed under the authority of Ashema the Listener. Eventually, Thor is returned to Asgard, while Doom&#x27;s whereabouts are left unknown.

==&quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; revisited==
In 1999, Marvel collected &quot;Heroes Reborn: The Return&quot; #1-4 limited series re-titled as the &quot;Return of the Heroes&quot; trade paperback. It was re-released in 2009 as &quot;Heroes Reborn: The Return&quot; trade paperback again collecting the 4-issue mini-series, and also the &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; one-shot specials from 2000: &quot;Doomsday&quot; #1, &quot;Ashema&quot; #1, &quot;Masters of Evil&quot; #1, &quot;Rebel&quot; #1, &quot;Remnants&quot; #1, &quot;Young Allies&quot; #1, and &quot;Doom&quot; #1.

In July 2000, Marvel published the trade paperback &quot;Fantastic Four: Heroes Reborn&quot;, collecting &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; vol. 2, issues #1-6 under the &#x27;Marvel&#x27;s Finest&#x27; banner, but no other &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; reprints followed for some time.

With 2006 marking the 10th anniversary of the &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; crossover, Marvel marked the occasion by having the reality-traversing Exiles team visit the &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; Earth, in &quot;Exiles&quot; #81-82. The company reprinted original &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; series and produced trade paperbacks collecting issues #1-12 (excluding the series finale cross-over &quot;World War III&quot;) of the four titles. A new edition of &quot;Heroes Reborn: Fantastic Four&quot; trade paperback was released in August 2018 (). Also, Jeph Loeb and Rob Liefeld reunited in November 2006 for &quot;Onslaught Reborn&quot;, a five-part weekly limited series that features both Onslaught and a world similar to the &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; universe. This was planned to tie in with the memorial scholarship fund established in honor of Loeb&#x27;s son Sam.

In 2021, Marvel published a &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; storyline consisting of a central miniseries by Jason Aaron and Ed McGuinness, though it bears no relationship to the 1996 story beyond its title and some in-story references.

<text>The Democratic Convergence Party-Reflection Group (), or PCD-GR, is a political party in São Tomé and Príncipe. It was founded on 4 November 1990 by Movement for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe (MLSTP) dissidents, independents, and young professionals. Leonel Mário d&#x27;Alva is the party leader.

The one-party period of São Tomé and Príncipe lasted from the country&#x27;s independence in 1975 to 1991, when the dominant party, Movement for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe – Social Democratic Party, lost in the first multiparty elections to the PCD-GR. The party won the 1991 parliamentary election and was the ruling party from 1991 to 1994. Since 1994 its power has declined, and it has maintained coalitions with other parties, first the MLSTP and then the Forces for Change Coalition of current President Fradique de Menezes. It was led for several years by Alda Bandeira.

At the legislative elections, March 3, 2002, the party won together with the Force for Change Democratic Movement-Liberal Party (MDFM-PL) 39.4% of the popular vote and 23 out of 55 seats. The same alliance won at the legislative election, held on 26 March 2006, 36.79% and 23 out of 55 seats. The party supported incumbent Fradique de Menezes in the 30 July 2006 presidential election. He was re-elected with 60.58% of the vote.

In the 2011 São Toméan presidential election, Delfim Neves represented both the PCD and the Force for Change Democratic Movement – Liberal Party (MDFM-PL), the part of the previous president, Fradique de Menezes. He won 13.9% of the vote.

<doc id="917054" wikidata="Q5878016" url="?curid=917054" title="Hokie Stone">
<text>Hokie Stone is a grey dolomite—limestone rock found near Blacksburg, in western Virginia. It gets its name from the traditional nickname attributed to students and alumni of Virginia Tech.

Hokie Stone is quarried by Virginia Tech for campus projects and is prominently displayed on the majority of buildings throughout the Blacksburg campus.

==Geology==
Hokie Stone is limestone infused with magnesium and calcium under intense pressure and temperature. Hokie Stone with impurities such as siltstone and sandstone is multi-colored and found on some newer Blacksburg campus structures.

==Quarry==
Eighty percent of the stone is quarried from a Virginia Tech-owned quarry a few miles from campus near the Highland Park subdivision of Blacksburg, Virginia. Twenty-five to thirty Virginia Tech employees use black powder each day to dislodge the stone, cut it into block sizes required by campus construction projects and then finish the blocks by hand using hammers and chisels. In 2010 Virginia Tech upgraded the quarry equipment to reduce costs, including the purchase of a computer-driven saw. Hokie Stone from this quarry can only be sold to Virginia Tech.

The remaining 20% of stone, which is black, is mined once per year from an additional quarry located on a local farm near Lusters Gate. About 50 tons can be quarried each week. This university-owned quarry has been in operation since the 1950s.

==History==
The native woodland Indians are believed to have made tools from Hokie Stone.

===At Virginia Tech===
====Buildings====
When the university was founded in 1872, buildings built in the &quot;Old Quad&quot; (now known as the &quot;Upper Quad&quot;) were red brick structures, reflecting the architecture of its first building, the Preston and Olin Building, a three-story red brick edifice constructed in 1855 for the Preston and Olin Institute. The first Hokie Stone was cut in 1899 for the YMCA Building (present day Performing Arts Building), the first to be constructed of it. V.P.I.&#x27;s first native-limestone-clad, neo-Gothic style building, known as The Chapel, was later constructed on the site where Newman Library stands today. Agricultural Hall or &quot;Old Aggie&quot; (now known as Price Hall) was built of the stone in 1907. In 1914, the first McBryde Hall introduced the Hokie Stone-clad Collegiate Gothic style, similar to great European universities. Originally designed as red brick building, McBryde Hall was clad in locally quarried stone because of a shortage of bricks due to military construction during World War I. The first stone dormitory, Main Campbell Hall, originally known as barracks No. 8 was built in 1930.

Between the late 1940s and the 1980s, a number of concrete and brick structures absent of Hokie Stone such as Hillcrest Hall, Shultz Hall (now known as the Moss Arts Center), Cowgill Hall, Litton Reaves Hall, Wallace Hall, Derring Hall (which ironically houses the geology department), the Cassell Coliseum and several residence halls on the &quot;Upper Quad&quot; were built. With the exception of Hillcrest Hall, which was built in the Gothic revival style in 1940 and clad in red brick, these were all modern structures and a radical departure from the architectural style of campus buildings built before World War II.

In 1975 the Tech Foundation bought the quarry from the local Cupp family. In 2010, the Virginia Tech Board of Visitors made it official policy that Hokie Stone be the predominant material in the facade of every new building on the Blacksburg central campus. Today each campus project uses an average of 1,500 tons of Hokie Stone, with each ton of stone covering about 35 square feet. The use of the local stone may add as much as $1 million to the cost of a new building.

====Other uses====
In addition to building exteriors, Hokie Stone is used in important monuments such as biographical markers outside each campus building providing a brief history of the person for whom the building is named. Thirty-two Hokie Stones were quarried by university stonemasons and engraved with the names of students and professors killed in the April 2007 school shooting. The memorial is a permanent version of one students spontaneously created using smaller stones. The Virginia Tech football team enters the playing field at Lane Stadium through a tunnel with an exit topped by a block of Hokie Stone which is touched by each player. In 2011, Virginia Tech offered Hokie Stone as an option for the centerpiece of class rings.

On September 26, 2013, the football team wore helmets decorated in a Hokie Stone motif for their game at Georgia Tech.

<doc id="917058" wikidata="Q353966" url="?curid=917058" title="Gary Hall Jr.">
<text>Gary Wayne Hall Jr. (born September 26, 1974) is an American former competition swimmer who represented the United States at the 1996, 2000, and 2004 Olympics and won ten Olympic medals (five gold, three silver, two bronze). He is a former world record-holder in two relay events. Hall is well known for his &quot;pro-wrestling-like&quot; antics before a competition, frequently strutting onto the pool deck in boxing shorts and robe, shadow boxing and flexing for the audience.

==Family==
His father, Gary Hall Sr., also competed in three Olympics as a swimmer (1968, 1972, and 1976). His maternal uncle, Charles Keating III, swam in the 1976 Olympics, and his maternal grandfather, Charles Keating Jr., was a national swimming champion in the 1940s.

Hall&#x27;s cousin is Chief petty officer Charles Keating IV, a Navy SEAL, who was killed at age 31 in combat with ISIS in Iraq in 2016. He was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for his actions in combat.

==Career==

===1996 Atlanta games===
In his first Olympics at the age of 21 in Atlanta, Hall had only 6 years of swimming experience yet he already had a well-known rivalry with Russia&#x27;s Alexander Popov. Hall and his teammates dominated the relay events, but Popov beat Hall and dominated in the individual events.

Hall won two individual silvers and two team relay golds at the games, including helping set the world record in both the 400 m freestyle and medley relays.

===1996–2000===
In 1998, Hall was suspended by the International Swimming Federation (FINA) for marijuana use.

In 1999, he was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, commonly referred to as childhood or juvenile diabetes. Upon his diagnosis, Hall struggled with the possibilities and the effects he knew the medical condition would have on his life. He took a short hiatus from swimming, but returned to compete in the 2000 U.S. Olympic Trials. There he won the 50 m freestyle and placed second in the 100 m freestyle. His 50 m time of 21.76 seconds set a new American record, beating the ten-year-old record set by Tom Jager.

===2000 Sydney games===
Hall&#x27;s success continued in the 2000 Summer Olympics held in Sydney, Australia. He won the gold medal in the individual 50 m freestyle, tying with his fellow U.S. Team member Anthony Ervin, and won the gold and silver in the team relays. He also won a bronze in the individual 100-meter freestyle race.

Prior to the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay, Hall posted on his blog: &quot;My biased opinion says that we will smash them (Australia&#x27;s 4 × 100 m team) like guitars. Historically the U.S. has always risen to the occasion. But the logic in that remote area of my brain says it won&#x27;t be so easy for the United States to dominate the waters this time.&quot; The Australian media seized upon the &quot;guitars&quot; comment to fuel the upcoming rivalry between the Australians and Americans in the pool, with Hall vilified as an &quot;Ugly American&quot;.

Hall swam the last leg in the relay, against Australian Ian Thorpe. He had a better start and came up a half body-length in front of Thorpe. Though he led the first length and was 0.23 seconds ahead at the turn, Thorpe fought back, and with 15 meters to go both swimmers were even; Thorpe finished first by a hand-length, inflicting the United States&#x27; with their only Olympic defeat in the event. The Australian team responded to Hall&#x27;s remarks after the race by playing air guitar on the pool deck. Hall recalled the race, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t even know how to play the guitar...I consider it the best relay race I&#x27;ve ever been part of. I doff my cap to the great Ian Thorpe. He had a better finish than I had.&quot; Another member of Australia&#x27;s victorious 4 × 100 team, Michael Klim, recalled that &quot;Hall was the first swimmer to come over and congratulate us. Even though he dished it out, he was a true sportsman.&quot; The decisive moment in the relay race had been Klim&#x27;s opening leg where he set a new 100-meter world record of 48.18, gaining a 0.71-second advantage over Anthony Ervin, a lead which his Australian teammates successfully defended. Hall clocked a faster 100 meters than Thorpe (48.24 to 48.30), but got out-touched to the wall by Thorpe (who earlier in the night set a new world record to win gold in the 400 meter freestyle).

===2004 Athens games===
At the 2004 Summer Olympics, Hall again won the gold medal in 50 m freestyle. At 29, he became the oldest American male Olympic swimmer since Duke Kahanamoku competed at age 34 in 1924. Despite having swum the fastest 50 in the year leading up to the 2004 Games, he was regarded as a long-shot to medal in the 50 m freestyle. He also won a bronze medal for competing in the preliminary heat of the 4 × 100-meter freestyle relay.

===2008 Olympic trials===
On July 5, 2008, Hall failed to qualify for the 2008 Olympic team after finishing fourth in the 50-meter finals at the US Olympic Trials in Omaha, Nebraska.

==The Race Club==
The Race Club is a swimming club founded by Hall and his father, Gary Hall Sr. The club, originally known as &quot;The World Team&quot;, was designed to serve as a training group for elite swimmers around the world in preparation for the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. To be able to train with the Race Club, one must either have been ranked in the top 20 in the world the past 3 calendar years or top 3 in their nation in the past year. The Race Club included such well-known swimmers as Roland Mark Schoeman, Mark Foster, Ryk Neethling, Ricky Busquet and Therese Alshammar. They were coached by University of Michigan coach Mike Bottom.

The Race Club offers various swimming camps, swim clinics, and swimming technique video recording year round for young swimmers at their Islamorada, Florida-based training center.

==Shark attack==
In the summer of 2006, Hall&#x27;s sister, Bebe Hall, was attacked by a blacktip reef shark near Islamorada, while she and Gary were spearfishing, an attack for which Bebe Hall needed 19 stitches. Gary Hall repeatedly punched the shark and his sister shot a spear into it, after which the shark swam off.

==Personality==
Hall has long been one of competitive swimming&#x27;s most colorful personalities. He often shadow-boxes before a race and is known for wearing a boxing robe in lieu of the usual warm-ups. The robe even earned Hall a fine during the 2004 Olympics, as the Everlast-made apparel violated the uniform supply agreement the team had with Speedo. His eccentricity has won him a great deal of fans, but what some perceive to be &quot;showboating&quot; has drawn substantial criticism. He is also an outspoken critic of performance-enhancing drug use in swimming, and is one of the few prominent swimmers willing to publicly question the legitimacy of suspected individual accomplishments. In 2008, he compared International Swimming Hall of Fame inductee Amy Van Dyken to disgraced track &amp; field athlete Marion Jones, noting they were both clients of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative (BALCO).

==Personal life==
On January 7, 2025, Hall lost his home and his Olympic medals in the California wildfires. In response, IOC president Thomas Bach promised Hall that there would be replicas made for him.

==Additional honors==

*Humanitarian Award winner at 2004 Golden Goggle Awards.
*On April 30, 2012, it was announced that Gary Hall Jr. would be inducted into the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame in July 2012.

<text>Alois Musil (30 June 1868 – 12 April 1944) was a Czech theologian, orientalist, explorer and bilingual Czech and German writer.

==Biography==
Musil was the oldest son born in 1868 into an poor farming family in Moravia (then Cisleithanian part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, today Czech Republic). His birthplace of Rychtářov was in an area surrounded by German-speakers, allowing him and his brothers to learn to read and write both German and Czech. He was a second cousin of Robert Musil, an Austrian writer. In the years 1887–1891 he studied Roman Catholic theology at the University of Olomouc, was consecrated as a priest in 1891 and received a doctorate in theology in 1895. In the years 1895–1898 he studied at the Dominican Biblical School in Jerusalem, in 1897-1898 at the Jesuit University of St. Joseph in Beirut, 1899 in London, Cambridge and Berlin.
He travelled extensively throughout the Arab world and kept coming back to it until 1917, collecting a huge body of scientific material. Among his discoveries was the 8th-century desert castle of Qusayr &#x27;Amra, now famous for its figurative Islamic paintings. In the process of trying to steal the now-famed Umayyad fresco &quot;Painting of the Six Kings&quot; from Qusayr &#x27;Amra, he permanently damaged the painting. He later developed a serious lung disease.

Between his trips Musil continued working on his publications and lecturing. In 1902 he became professor of theology at the University of Olomouc, and in 1909, professor of Biblical studies and Arabic at Vienna University. In addition to modern and classical languages, he mastered 35 dialects of Arabic. He was so well acquainted with the Rwala Bedouins, that he was accepted into the tribe as &quot;Sheikh Musa&quot;.

During World War I he was sent to the Middle East to eliminate British attempts to instigate a revolution against the Ottoman Empire, thus being an opponent of T. E. Lawrence. In 1917 he journeyed through the Middle East with Archduke Hubert Salvator of Austria; there are suggestions that the mission had a political motive involving Arab Revolt against the Ottoman government.

After the war he became a professor at Charles University in Prague (1920), despite opposing voices resenting his close ties with the House of Habsburg. He helped to establish the Oriental Institute of the Academy of Sciences in Prague.

In cooperation with the American industrialist Charles Richard Crane he published his works in English (1922–23). In addition to scientific work and popular travel books he published 21 novels for young readers.

Musil worked for Charles University until 1938, but was active until the very end of his life. He died in Otryby due to kidney dysfunction complicated by lung disease.

==Works==

Although Musil is best known for his discovery of Qusayr &#x27;Amra, his output was prolific. He wrote more than 50 books (including six illustrated works published by the American Geographical Society and 20 children&#x27;s books); some 1200 scholarly articles; transcriptions and translations of Bedouin tribal poems and songs; produced thousands of photographs of archaeological sites and Bedouin people and prepared topographic maps and surveys of territories.

<doc id="917063" wikidata="Q2630833" url="?curid=917063" title="Pulcinella (ballet)">
<text>Pulcinella is a 21-section ballet by Igor Stravinsky with arias for soprano, tenor and bass vocal soloists, and two sung trios. It is based on the 18th-century play &quot;Quatre Polichinelles semblables&quot;, or &quot;Four similar Pulcinellas&quot;, revolving around a stock character from &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;. The work premiered at the Paris Opera on 15 May 1920 under the baton of Ernest Ansermet. The central dancer, Léonide Massine, created both the libretto and the choreography, while Pablo Picasso designed the costumes and sets. The ballet was commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev, impresario of the &quot;Ballets Russes&quot;. A complete performance takes 35–40 minutes. Stravinsky revised the score in 1965.

==History==
Diaghilev wanted a ballet based on an early 18th-century &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot; libretto and music then believed to have been composed by Giovanni Battista Pergolesi. This attribution has since been proved to be spurious. Some of the music may have been by Domenico Gallo, Unico Wilhelm van Wassenaer, Carlo Ignazio Monza and Alessandro Parisotti.

Conductor Ernest Ansermet wrote to Stravinsky in 1919 about the project. The composer initially did not like the idea of music by Pergolesi, but once he studied the scores, which Diaghilev had found in libraries in Naples and London, he changed his mind. Stravinsky adapted the older music to a more modern style by borrowing specific themes and textures, but interjecting his modern rhythms, cadences, and harmonies.

&quot;Pulcinella&quot; marked the beginning of Stravinsky&#x27;s second phase as a composer, his neoclassical period. He wrote: 
&quot;Pulcinella&quot; was my discovery of the past, the epiphany through which the whole of my late work became possible. It was a backward look, of course—the first of many love affairs in that direction—but it was a look in the mirror, too.

The ballet was revived and revised by New York City Ballet&#x27;s balletmasters George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins for their 1972 Stravinsky Festival. They both danced in the performance, Robbins in the title role, and were joined in the premier by Francisco Moncion, who danced the role of The Devil.

== Story ==
Pulcinella is taken from a manuscript from Naples, dating from 1700, containing a number of comedies portraying the traditional character of the popular Neapolitan stage. This libretto was derived from &quot;Quatre Polichinelles semblables&quot; (&quot;Four similar Pulcinellas&quot;).

The one-act ballet features Pulcinella, his girlfriend Pimpinella, his friends Furbo, Prudenza and Rosetta, and Florindo and Cloviello. The story starts with Florindo and Cloviello serenading Prudenza and Rosetta. The two women are unimpressed and reply by showering the suitors with water. Prudenza&#x27;s father, a doctor, appears and chases them away.

A new episode begins with Rosetta, when her father appears. Rosetta dances for Pulcinella and they kiss. But Pimpinella sees this and interrupts them. Florindo and Cloviello arrive and, jealous of Pulcinella, they beat him up. Pulcinella is stabbed, but this is a set-up event to gain Pimpinella&#x27;s forgiveness of him. Furbo, disguised as a magician, comes and appears to resurrect Pulcinella in front of everybody. Pimpinella forgives Pulcinella, and Prudenza and Rosetta succumb to Florindo&#x27;s and Cloviello&#x27;s wooing. The ballet ends with the marriages of the three couples.

== Music ==
The music is based on pieces then believed to have been by the Italian composer Giovanni Battista Pergolesi. The following is a description of the musical forces and movements.

Stravinsky extracted a purely instrumental suite from his ballet which was premiered by the Boston Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Pierre Monteux, on 22 December 1922. It has these eight movements:

The suite was revised in 1947 to correct printing errors, change metronome markings and rename part VII.
===&quot;Suite italienne&quot;===
Stravinsky based the following works on the ballet:
*1925: &quot;Suite d&#x27;après des thèmes, fragments et morceaux de Giambattista Pergolesi,&quot; for violin and piano (in collaboration with Paul Kochanski).
*1932/33: &quot;Suite italienne,&quot; for cello and piano (in collaboration with Gregor Piatigorsky).
*1933: &quot;Suite italienne&quot;, for violin and piano (in collaboration with Samuel Dushkin).
*Violinist Jascha Heifetz and Piatigorsky later made an arrangement for violin and cello, which they also called &quot;Suite italienne&quot;.

<text>Jürgen Heinz Lothar Gröbler OBE (born 31 July 1946, Magdeburg) is a German rowing coach, formerly the Olympic team coach of East Germany and later of Great Britain. He coached crews to medals at ten Olympiads from 1972 to 2016, with the exception of the 1984 Games, which were boycotted by Eastern Bloc countries.

== Coaching career ==

Having studied sports science at Leipzig University, he returned to his local rowing club in Magdeburg and first attracted attention by coaching Wolfgang Güldenpfennig to the bronze medal in the 1972 Olympics. He then moved on to coach both the quadruple scull and coxless pairs who won gold at the 1976 Summer Olympics. The coxless pair of Bernd and Jörg Landvoigt also went on to triumph at the 1980 Summer Olympics under Gröbler&#x27;s guidance. From 1980 to 1990 he was chief coach of the East German women&#x27;s rowing team.

When Germany was reunited and the East German national sports administration collapsed in 1991, Gröbler moved to Britain where he was employed by Leander Club and the Amateur Rowing Association. Controversy surrounded the appointment, given the suspicions that drug use had been rife in East German sports and that any senior coach would have been involved or had knowledge of the drugs programme. In an interview in 1998 he admitted that he had &quot;difficulties&quot; with the thought that drug taking may have caused medical problems for rowers, and that he had given &quot;snippets&quot; of information to the Stasi, the East German security organisation. Steve Redgrave defended him, blaming the East German system for the drug use, rather than Gröbler personally, in keeping with Gröbler&#x27;s own statement that &quot;I have to live with what went on in East Germany. I was born in the wrong place. It was not possible to walk away.&quot;

For Great Britain he achieved Olympic golds with:
*Steve Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent in 1992 and 1996 in the pair
*James Cracknell, Tim Foster, Steve Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent in 2000 in the four
*Steve Williams, James Cracknell, Ed Coode and Matthew Pinsent in 2004 in the four,
*Tom James, Steve Williams, Pete Reed, and Andrew Triggs Hodge in 2008 in the four, 
*Alex Gregory, Pete Reed, Tom James and Andrew Triggs Hodge in 2012 in the four, and
*Alex Gregory, Moe Sbihi, George Nash and Constantine Louloudis in 2016 in the four
*Phelan Hill, Will Satch, Matt Langridge, Paul Bennett, Pete Reed, Matt Gotrel, Andrew Triggs Hodge, Tom Ransley and Scott Durant in 2016 in the eight.

In August 2000, the month prior to coaching the coxless four to gold in Sydney, he took part in a 3-part BBC documentary, &quot;Gold Fever&quot;. This followed him and the crew in the years leading up to the Olympics, showing the hard work and tough decisions he faced in the quest for gold.

In 2000 he won the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Coach Award, and in March 2006 he was appointed an Honorary Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell for his contribution to British sport.

In August 2020, it was announced that Grobler was retiring as Chief Coach for British Rowing with immediate effect, then in September 2021 it was announced that he was joining the French Rowing Federation as Executive High Performance Consultant.

== Personal life ==

Grobler lives in Henley-on-Thames with his wife Angela. They have a son, Chris.

<doc id="917069" wikidata="Q7719894" url="?curid=917069" title="Michael Spinks vs. Dwight Muhammad Qawi">
<text>[[Michael Spinks]] vs. [[Dwight Muhammad Qawi]], billed as &quot;The Brawl for it All&quot;, was a professional boxing match contested on March 18, 1983 for the Undisputed Light Heavyweight Championship.

==Background==
&quot;The Brawl for it All&quot; was a long-awaited match. Qawi had defeated Matthew Saad Muhammad for the WBC world title, and Spinks had defeated Eddie Mustafa Muhammad for the WBA world title. Both Qawi and Spinks had defeated some top name challengers during the course of their championship runs; boxing fans and experts alike clamoured for the fight to take place.

The fight had some dramatic backgrounds: two months before, Spinks&#x27; longtime girlfriend, who was the mother of his only daughter, had died after a car accident. On fight night, Spinks&#x27; two-year-old daughter, unaware that her mother had died, walked into Spinks&#x27; locker room and asked when would her mother show up to see the fight. Spinks cried, but he was able to keep his composure.

Qawi had been better known to most fans as Dwight Braxton. He still had not talked much in public about his name change and his Muslim faith. About seven days before the fight, he revealed that his doctors had recommended him not to fight, as he had been diagnosed with pneumonia. This diagnosis put the fight in jeopardy, but he decided to go on with the fight.

The bout was carried live on HBO Boxing. The bout was fought at Atlantic City, New Jersey, near Qawi&#x27;s hometown of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Some fans and critics would later say that the fight did not live up to its name, because they were expecting an action packed fight.

==The fight==
Spinks surprised many observers by taking a technical stance from the beginning, and Qawi, in his typical style, charged forward, chasing Spinks. Rounds one to six were, in the eyes of many, including the judges, dominated by Spinks . By the middle rounds, however, Qawi began to untrack, and, in round eight, Spinks suffered two falls: the first one was ruled a slip, but the second one was a controversial knockdown. As Spinks stepped on one of Qawi&#x27;s feet, Qawi landed a blow to Spinks&#x27; body. Left without any choice (because Qawi had landed a punch the moment before Spinks fell), the referee, Larry Hazzard, issued an eight-second count after Spinks rose, making it officially Spinks&#x27; first career fall. The knockdown was controversial, because many continue to argue that, had Spinks not stepped on Qawi&#x27;s foot, Qawi would have never been credited with knocking Spinks down.

Qawi, perhaps because of his pneumonia, tired somewhat and backtracked during rounds eleven to thirteen, rounds which would later become key rounds in the fight.

Suspecting that he was behind on points, Qawi became more aggressive in rounds fourteen and fifteen. He staggered Spinks with two rights towards the end of round fourteen, but could not finish up his foe as the bell rang soon afterwards. Qawi came swinging from every angle at the start of the last round, probably desperate to score a knockout. But Spinks made him miss frequently, bobbing his head and trying to keep his distance from Qawi. (In 2006, Qawi bitterly told &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; that Spinks &quot;ran like a thief&quot; during the fight.)

==Decision==
After the fight ended, the scorecards were read: judge Tony Castellano had scored the fight 144–140, judge Tony Perez had it at 144–141, and judge Frank Cappuccino had it also at 144–141, all in favor of Spinks.

The closeness of the decision made fans write to magazines and newspapers, asking for a rematch. The rematch came very close to happening; it was set for September 27 of 1984, but it was cancelled after Qawi was injured during training, three weeks before the fight.

==Aftermath==
Spinks went on to become the first world light heavyweight champion in boxing history to go up in weight and win the world heavyweight title. Qawi, for his part, went up to the cruiserweight division, where he reigned as WBA world champion from 1985 to 1986.

Both fighters are now members of the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

<text>Ayaz Niyazi oghlu Mutallibov (12 May 1938 – 27 March 2022) was an Azerbaijani politician who served as the first president of Azerbaijan. He was the last leader of Soviet Azerbaijan, and first President of Azerbaijan from 18 May 1990 until 6 March 1992 and from 14 May until 18 May 1992.

He rose through the ranks of the Azerbaijan Communist Party during Soviet Azerbaijan before becoming leader of the party in 1990. Later that year, the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan SSR elected Mutallibov as the first President of Azerbaijan SSR. In September 1991, amid the collapse of the Soviet Union and independence of Azerbaijan, Mutallibov declared himself President of Azerbaijan in an uncontested election. He was ousted from power in May 1992 when he tried to cancel the forthcoming presidential election.

==Early life and career==

Mutallibov was born on 12 May 1938, in Baku to the family of a physician and later World War II veteran, Niyazi Ashraf oghlu Mutallibov (), and gynaecologist Kubra Mutallibova (died in 1988). Both of his parents were from Shamakhi.

In 1956, Ayaz Mutallibov graduated from the secondary school #189 in Baku. During his youth he was fond of jazz music. He was a member of the school volleyball team. In 1956–62, Mutallibov attended the Azerbaijan State Institute of Petroleum and Chemistry.

In 1964, he became the director of the Baku Refrigerator Factory, and in 1974, he was appointed the General Director of the &quot;BakElectroBytMash&quot; State Industrial Company.

== Political career ==
In 1977, he was appointed the Second Secretary of Azerbaijan Communist Party Committee in the Narimanov District of Baku. He was promoted to the republic&#x27;s cabinet in 1979 as he assumed the post of Minister of Local Industry of Azerbaijan SSR. In 1982, he was appointed the Chairman of the State Planning Committee of Azerbaijan SSR and the Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Azerbaijan SSR. In January 1989, he was appointed the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Azerbaijan SSR.

== Party leadership and Presidency of Azerbaijan ==
On 24 January 1990, four days after Soviet troops entered Baku, marking the beginning of the Black January crackdown, Mutallibov, at this point in Moscow, is appointed the First Secretary of the Azerbaijan Communist Party.

On 18 May 1990, the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan SSR elected Mutallibov as the first President of Azerbaijan SSR. In December 1990, at Mutallibov&#x27;s initiative, the Supreme Soviet of the Azerbaijan SSR officially renamed the country to the Azerbaijan Republic and adopted the Declaration of Sovereignty.

On 17 March 1991, under pressure from Mutallibov, the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan voted for the participation of Azerbaijan in the referendum on the fate of the Soviet Union. On 19 August 1991, according to some reports, while on a visit to Tehran, Mutalibov made a statement in support of the Soviet coup attempt of 1991. However, in 2016, the ex-president of Azerbaijan said that he did not support the putschists.

In September 1991, amid the collapse of the Soviet Union and independence of Azerbaijan, Mutallibov dissolved the Communist Party of Azerbaijan declared himself President of Azerbaijan in an uncontested election. Mutallibov negotiated with the opposition, in particularly the Popular Front party, during his presidency. After pressure from the Popular Front, Mutallibov established a parliament where power was divided between opposition figures and the communist old guard.

=== Ousting ===
On 6 March 1992, Under pressure from Azerbaijan Popular Front amid substantial Azerbaijani losses in the First Nagorno-Karabakh War, Mutallibov was forced to submit his resignation to the National Assembly of Azerbaijan. He handed the presidency to his ally Yaqub Mammadov. On 14 May, the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan, dominated by the former members of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan, heard the case on Khojaly Massacre, relieved Mutallibov of any responsibility, and reversed his prior resignation, restoring him as the President of Azerbaijan.

Upon taking the powers of the presidency again, Mutallibov cancelled the forthcoming presidential elections, which were set to take place on 7 June 1992. A day later, armed forces led by the Azerbaijan Popular Front under the command of Police Colonel Isgandar Hamidov, took control of the offices of the Parliament of Azerbaijan and Azerbaijani State Radio and Television, thereby deposing Mutallibov, who left for Moscow. The defunct Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan was dissolved passing the duties to the National Assembly of Azerbaijan formed by equal representation of Azerbaijan Popular Front and former communists. Isa Gambar of the Popular Front party was subsequently made acting president; Gambar reinstated the upcoming presidential elections which were won by Abulfaz Elchibey.

<text>Abū al-Ṭayyib Aḥmad ibn al-Ḥusayn al-Mutanabbī al-Kindī ( – 965 AD), commonly known as Al-Mutanabbi (), was an Abbasid-era Arab poet at the court of the Hamdanid emir Sayf al-Dawla in Aleppo, and for whom he composed 300 folios of poetry. His poetic style earned him great popularity in his time and many of his poems are not only still widely read in today&#x27;s Arab world but are considered to be proverbial.

He started writing poetry when he was nine years old. He is well known for his sharp intelligence and wittiness. Among the topics he discussed were courage, the philosophy of life, and the description of battles. As one of the greatest, most prominent and influential poets in the Arabic language, much of his work has been translated into over 20 languages worldwide.

His great talent brought him very close to many leaders of his time, whom he extolled in return for money and gifts. His political ambitions, however, ultimately soured his relations with his patrons and his egomania may have cost him his life when the subjects of some of his verse attacked him.

==Biography==
Al-Mutanabbi was born in the city of Kufa (in modern day Iraq) in 915. His father claimed descent from the South Arabian tribe of Banu Ju&#x27;fa. His last name, Al-Kindī, was attributed to the district he was born.

Owing to his poetic talent and claiming predecession of prophet Salih, al-Mutanabbi received an education in Damascus, Syria. When the Qarmatians sacked Kufah in 924, he joined them and lived among the Banu Kalb and other Bedouin tribes. Learning their doctrines and dialect, he had many followers, and even claimed to be a &quot;nabi&quot; (, &quot;prophet&quot;—hence the laqab al-Mutanabbi &quot;The Would-be Prophet&quot;.

He led a Qarmatian revolt in Syria in 932. After its suppression and two years of imprisonment by the Ikhshid governor of Homs, he recanted in 935 and became a wandering poet. During this period, he began writing his first known poems. Political ambition to be a wali led al-Mutanabbi to the courts of Sayf al-Dawla and Abu al-Misk Kafur but in this ambition he failed.

Al-Mutanabbi lived at the time when the Abbasid Caliphate started coming apart and many of the states in the Islamic world became politically and militarily independent. Chief among those states was the Emirate of Aleppo.

He began to write panegyrics in the tradition established by the poets Abu Tammam and al-Buhturi. In 948 he joined the court of Sayf al-Dawla, the Hamdanid poet-prince of northern Syria. Sayf al-Dawla was greatly concerned with fighting the Byzantine Empire in Asia minor, where Al-Mutanabbi fought alongside him. During his nine years stay at Sayf al-Dawla&#x27;s court, Al-Mutanabbi wrote his greatest and most famous poems, panegyrics in praise of his patron that rank as masterpieces of Arabic poetry.

During his stay in Aleppo, Al-Mutanabbi found himself at odds with many scholars and poets in Sayf al-Dawla&#x27;s court, including Abu Firas al-Hamdani, a poet and Sayf al-Dawla&#x27;s cousin. In addition, Al-Mutanabbi lost Sayf al-Dawla&#x27;s favor because of his political ambition to be Wāli. The latter part of this period was clouded with intrigues and jealousies that culminated in al-Mutanabbi&#x27;s leaving Syria for Egypt, then ruled in name by the Ikhshidids.

=== Al-Mutanabbi in Egypt ===
Al-Mutanabbi joined the court of Abu al-Misk Kafur after parting ways with Sayf al-Dawla. Kafur mistrusted Al-Mutanabbi&#x27;s intentions, claiming them to be a threat to his position. Al-Mutanabbi realized that his hopes of becoming a statesman were not going to bear fruit and he left Egypt in c. 960. After he left, he heavily criticized Abu al-Misk Kafur with satirical odes.

==Poetry and famous sayings==
The desert knows me well, the night, the mounted menThe battle and the sword, the paper and the pen!
When you honour a noble man, you own him, but if you honour an ignoble man, he rebels.
My deep poetic art the blind have eyes to see,&lt;br&gt;My verses ring in ears as deaf as deaf can be.





==Death==
In 957 Mutanabbi left Aleppo, making his way to Egypt and the court of the Abu al-Misk Kafur. In 960 the poet left Egypt, penning several satires about Kafur. He traveled to Baghdad but was killed resisting thieves before reaching the city.

==Legacy==

Ibn Jinni the grammarian (c. 941/2—1001/2) wrote a commentary on al-Mutanabbi&#x27;s poetry titled &quot;Al-Fasr&quot; (&#x27;The Explanation&#x27;). The poet philosopher Abu Al Alaa al-Marri has also written a book of exegesis on Al-Mutanabbi&#x27;s poetry. Al Marri, himself an accomplished poet, would usually refer to al-Mutanabbi affectionately as &quot;our poet&quot;. Encyclopædia Britannica states: &quot;He gave to the traditional qaṣīdah, or ode, a freer and more personal development, writing in what can be called a neoclassical style that combined some elements of Iraqi and Syrian stylistics with classical features.&quot;

=== Al-Mutanabbi Street ===


In 1932, Mutanabbi Street, a bookselling street market of Baghdad, was named after al-Mutanabbi to honor him who, at the time, was very well known in the region. The narrow car-free street is full of booksellers and book stores and it&#x27;s one kilometer long. At the entrance of the street is an arch adorned with the poet&#x27;s quotes and on the end of it is a statue of al-Mutanabbi that overlooks the Tigris River. Over time, al-Mutanabbi Street evolved into a symbol of intellectual freedom, attracting writers, artists, and diverse dissenting voices from across the country.

<text>Mutara III Rudahigwa (March 1911 – 25 July 1959) was King (&quot;umwami&quot;) of Rwanda between 1931 and 1959. He was the first Rwandan king to be baptised, bringing Catholicism to the country. His Christian name was Charles Léon Pierre and he is sometimes referred to as Charles Mutara III Rudahigwa.

== Early life and education ==
Rudahigwa was born in March 1911, in the royal capital of Rwanda, Nyanza, to King Yuhi V Musinga, and Queen Kankazi (later Queen Mother Radegonde Nyiramavugo III Kankazi), the first of his eleven wives. He was a member of the Tutsi Abanyiginya clan.

In 1919 he began his education at the Colonial School for Chiefs&#x27; Sons in Nyanza, subsequently becoming his father&#x27;s secretary in 1924. In January 1929 he was appointed a chief and administered a province.

== Reign ==
Rudahigwa became king on 16 November 1931, the Belgian colonial administration having deposed his father, Yuhi V Musinga, four days earlier for alleged contact with German agents. Rudahigwa took the royal name Mutara, becoming Mutara III Rudahigwa. He is sometimes referred to as Charles Mutara III Rudahigwa.

In 1943, Rudahigwa was the first Rwandan king to convert to Catholicism, taking the Christian name Charles Léon Pierre. His father had refused to convert to Christianity: the Rwandan Catholic Church saw him as anti-Christian, an impediment to their civilising mission. From 1929, Rudahigwa had been instructed in Christianity by Léon Classe, the head of the Rwandan Catholic Church. He was groomed by the Belgians to replace his father. In 1946, he dedicated the country to Christ, effectively making Christianity a state religion. His conversion spearheaded a wave of baptisms in the protectorate.

His reign coincided with the worst recorded period of famine in Rwanda between 1941 and 1945, which included the Ruzagayura famine (1943–1944), during which time 200,000 out of the nation&#x27;s population of around two million perished.

=== Rising ethnic tensions ===

During Rudahigwa&#x27;s reign there was a marked stratification of ethnic identity within Ruanda-Urundi, the Belgian-ruled mandate of which Rwanda formed the northern part. In 1935, the Belgian administration issued identity cards formalising the ethnic categories, Tutsi, Hutu and Twa. After World War II, a Hutu emancipation movement began to grow throughout Ruanda-Urundi, fueled by increasing resentment of the inter-war social reforms, and also an increasing sympathy for the Hutu within the Catholic Church. Although in 1954, Rudhahigwa abolished the &quot;ubuhake&quot; system of indentured service that exploited Hutus, this had little real practical effect.

The monarchy and prominent Tutsi sensed the growing influence of the Hutu and began to agitate for immediate independence on their own terms, culminating in Rudahigwa&#x27;s demand for independence from Belgium in 1956. In 1957, a group of Hutu scholars wrote the &quot;Bahutu Manifesto&quot;. This political manifesto denounced the &quot;exploitation&quot; of the Hutus by the ethnic Tutsi and called for their liberation from first Tutsi, and then Belgian, rule. Hutu political parties quickly formed after that, with future-president Gregoire Kayibanda forming the Hutu Social Movement (soon renamed &quot;MDR-PARMEHUTU&quot;), and Joseph Gitera creating Association for Social Promotion of the Masses (APROSOMA).

=== Death ===
On 24 July 1959, Rudahigwa arrived in Usumbura (now Bujumbura), Urundi, for a meeting with Belgian colonial authorities arranged by Father André Perraudin. The following day, he visited his Belgian doctor at the colonial hospital, where he died. The Belgian authorities put out conflicting explanations for his death. One was that he complained of a severe headache and had been treated by his doctor, but collapsed as he left the hospital of what was later determined, by three doctors, to be a cerebral haemorrhage. Another Belgian explanation was that he died from a reaction to a penicillin shot. An autopsy was not carried out due to the objections of Queen Mother Kankazi.

Rumours that he had been deliberately killed by the Belgian authorities were rife, and tensions rose: ordinary Rwandans gathered along routes and stoned Europeans&#x27; cars. Rumours that he was in poor health, suffering from the effects of excessive drinking, as well as the effects of untreated syphilis, are claims unverified by any evidence. A Twa attendant of the king said he was in great health at the time, which is supported by his active engagement in sporting activities then, including vigorous games of tennis.

Rudahigwa was succeeded by his half-brother, Jean-Baptiste Ndahindurwa, as Kigeli V.

== Personal life ==
Mutara married Nyiramakomali on 15 October 1933 and they divorced in 1941. He married Rosalie Gicanda, a Christian, in a church wedding on 13 January 1942.

After Rudahigwa&#x27;s death, Rosalie Gicanda remained in Rwanda. She was murdered in 1994 during the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi on the orders of Ildéphonse Nizeyimana. He was later detained, convicted by a UN war crimes court, and sentenced to life imprisonment.

In 1953 the American writer John Gunther interviewed the Mwami in preparation for his book &quot;Inside Africa&quot;. In this work Rudahigwa was described as a sombre and sober personality, lean and handsome in appearance, and six foot nine in height. He spoke excellent French and professed loyalty to Belgium and indifference to the United Nations trusteeship of that period.

<doc id="917094" wikidata="Q2919495" url="?curid=917094" title="Horilka">
<text>Horilka ( ; ) is a Ukrainian alcoholic beverage.

The word &quot;horilka&quot; may also be used in a generic sense in the Ukrainian language to mean vodka or other strong spirits and etymologically is similar to the Ukrainian word for &#x27;to burn&#x27; - &quot;hority&quot;. Home-distilled horilka, moonshine, is called &quot;samohon&quot; ( or &#x27;self-run&#x27; - almost identical to the Russian and Polish &quot;samogon&quot;). Horilka is usually distilled from grain (usually wheat or rye), though it can, less commonly, also be distilled from potatoes, honey, sugar beets etc. One type of horilka, called &quot;pertsivka&quot; (), is horilka with chili peppers. Historically, outside Ukraine, pertsivka is generally referred to when people speak of horilka, although pertsivka itself is just one type of horilka.

It is believed that horilka was not as strong as today with about 20 percent alcohol by volume (40 proof). However, today nearly all industrially produced horilka is 40 percent (80 proof).

== Derivatives ==
Ukrainian tradition has also produced various derivatives of horilka. Some of these are available as commercial products, but most are typically home-made. This includes various kinds of fruit infusion, &quot;nalyvka&quot; and spiced &quot;spotykach&quot;: &quot;agrusivka&quot; made with gooseberries, &quot;anisivka&quot; (anise seeds), &quot;aivivka&quot; (quince), &quot;berezivka&quot; (birch leaves or buds), &quot;buriakivka&quot; (sugar beets), &quot;chasnykivka&quot; (garlic), &quot;derenivka&quot; (Cornelian cherries), &quot;dulivka&quot; (oleaster-leafed pears), &quot;horikhivka&quot; (nuts), &quot;horobynivka&quot; (ashberries), &quot;hrushivka&quot; (pears), &quot;kalhanivka&quot; (tormentil roots), &quot;kalynivka&quot; (guelder-rose berries), &quot;khrinovukha&quot; or &quot;khrinivka&quot; (horseradish), &quot;kmynivka&quot; (caraway seeds), &quot;kontabas&quot; (blackcurrant buds), &quot;malynivka&quot; (raspberries), &quot;mochena&quot; (citrus rind), &quot;mokrukha&quot; (oranges and cloves), &quot;morelivka&quot; or &quot;zherdelivka&quot; or &quot;abrykosivka&quot; (apricots), &quot;ozhynivka&quot; (blackberries), &quot;polunychnyk&quot; (strawberries), &quot;polynivka&quot; (wormwood), &quot;porichkivka&quot; (redcurrants or white currants), &quot;pyriivka&quot; (couch grass rhizomes), &quot;shapranivka&quot; (saffron), &quot;shypshynnyk&quot; (rose hips), &quot;slyvianka&quot; or &quot;slyvovukha&quot; (plums), &quot;smorodynivka&quot; (blackcurrants), &quot;ternivka&quot; (blackthorn berries), &quot;tertukha&quot; (crushed woodland strawberries), &quot;tsytrynivka&quot; (lemons), &quot;vyshniak&quot; or &quot;vyshnivka&quot; (sour cherries), &quot;yalivtsivka&quot; (juniper berries), &quot;zviroboivka&quot; (St. John&#x27;s wort), &quot;zubrivka&quot; (bison grass). Horilka is also made with honey (called &quot;medova&quot;), mint, or even milk. In some cases whole fruits of red peppers (capsicum) are put into the bottle, turning horilka into a sort of bitters; it is then named &quot;horilka z pertsem&quot;, or &quot;pertsivka&quot; (one should be mindful of the usage: &quot;horilka z pertsem&quot; refers to &quot;horilka&quot; bottled with hot chilli peppers, whereas &quot;pertsivka&quot; typically refers to &quot;horilka&quot; spiced with the essence of pepper). &quot;Medova z pertsem&quot; is the combination of &quot;horilka&quot; with chili peppers and honey.

Most of these preparations are aged with fruit for several weeks or months, then strained or decanted. Some recipes call for the jars to be placed on the rooftop, for maximum bleaching by the sun. Many include the addition of home-made syrup for a strong liqueur, others yield very dry, clear spirit. Some involve the fermentation of fruit as well as addition of horilka. Preparations which are baked in an oven, in a pot sealed with bread dough, are called &quot;zapikanka&quot;, &quot;varenukha&quot; or &quot;palynka&quot;.

==Traditions==
Horilka plays a role in traditional weddings in Ukraine.
And bring us a lot of horilka, but not of that fancy kind with raisins, or with any other such things — bring us horilka of the purest kind, give us that demon drink that makes us merry, playful and wild!

—&quot;Taras Bulba&quot;, by Nikolai Gogol
== Etymology ==
The word &quot;horilka&quot; is attested in 1562 (горилка) and 1678 (горѣлка). Dialectic variants are &quot;harilka&quot;, &quot;horilash&quot;, &quot;horilytsya&quot;, &quot;horilets’&quot;, &quot;horilukha&quot;, &quot;zghorivka&quot;, &quot;zorivka&quot;, &quot;orilka&quot;, as well as Western Ukrainian &quot;horivka&quot;, &quot;horychka&quot;.

The word comes from the same root as the verb &quot;hority&quot;, ‘to burn’, similarly to Belarusian &quot;harelka&quot;, south Russian &quot;gorelka&quot;, Czech &quot;kořalka&quot;, and Slovak &quot;goralka&quot;, &quot;goržolka&quot;. It is considered to have come about following the Polish example &quot;gorzałka&quot;, possibly as an abbreviation of a compound word like &quot;horile vyno&quot; (‘burning wine’; compare the older word &quot;horěloe vyno&quot;, горѣлое вино, attested in 1511) or &quot;horila(ya) voda&quot; (‘burning water’; compare early Czech &quot;pálená voda&quot; → &quot;pálenka&quot; or Hungarian/Transylvanian &quot;palinka&quot;). It may be an adaptation of the early Old High German &quot;der brannte Wein&quot; → &quot;Branntwein&quot;. Also compare English &quot;brandy&quot;, short for &quot;brandywine&quot;, from Dutch &quot;brandewijn&quot;, ‘burning wine’.

==Pertsivka==
A &quot;pertsivka&quot; or &quot;horilka z pertsem&quot; () is the most widely associated type of horilka outside of Ukraine. It is made with whole fruits of capsicum put into the bottle, turning horilka into a sort of bitters. Sometimes pertsivka can be made also using honey, which is then called &quot;pertsivka z medom&quot; or &quot;medova z pertsem&quot; (honey-pepper flavoured horilka). 
Nemiroff is a Ukrainian brand actively promoting pepper horilka worldwide through the heavy use of product placement in cinema. The brand and company don&#x27;t have long traditions but pertsivka production itself does.

==Production of horilka==
Horilka that is bottled and sold by companies is usually distilled from wheat or rye. Horilka may also contain honey or be distilled from honey, or contain chili peppers, mint or birch bud. 
The self-distilled alcoholic beverage is called samohon and is the homemade variety of horilka, akin to moonshine.

<text>Mustafa Fazıl Pasha (; 20 February 1830 – 2 December 1875) was an Ottoman-Egyptian prince of ethnic Albanian descent belonging to the Muhammad Ali Dynasty founded by his grandfather Muhammad Ali Pasha.

== Life ==
Prince Mustafa was born on 20 February 1830 at Cairo. He was the third son of Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt and his consort Ulfat Qadin (died 1865). He was educated at the Egyptian Mission School in Paris. When he was eleven years of age Mustafa was circumcised. On January 18, 1863, Prince Mustafa became the heir apparent to his brother Isma&#x27;il Pasha but on May 28, 1866, the Ottoman Sultan Abdülaziz changed the law so that the succession became by a direct male line of the reigning Khedive (&quot;viceroy&quot;) instead of passing from brother to brother. In protest of this decision, Mustafa Fazl Pasha left Egypt for Paris, where he patronized the Young Ottomans opposition against the Sultan Abdulaziz.

After losing his place as first in the line of succession Prince Mustafa was appointed minister for education in 1862, minister for finance in 1864 and 1869, and for minister for justice from 1871 until 1872.

<text>Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar (; (23 March 1853 – 3 January 1907) was the fifth Qajar shah of Iran, reigning from 1896 until his death in 1907. He is often credited with the creation of the Persian Constitution of 1906, which he approved of in one of his final acts as shah.

==Biography==
Mozaffar ad-Din was born on 23 March 1853 in the capital of Tehran. He was the fourth son of Naser al-Din Shah Qajar (). His mother was Shokouh al-Saltaneh, a daughter of Fath-Ali Mirza and a granddaughter of the second Qajar shah Fath-Ali Shah (). 

Mozaffar al-Din was named crown prince and sent as governor to the northern province of Azerbaijan in 1861. His father, Naser al-Din Shah ruled Iran for close to 48 years. Mozaffar al-Din spent his 35 years as crown prince in the pursuit of pleasure; his relations with his father were frequently strained, and he was not consulted in important matters of state. Thus, when he ascended the throne in May 1896, he was unprepared for the burdens of office.

At Mozaffar al-Din&#x27;s accession, Iran faced a financial crisis, with annual governmental expenditures far in excess of revenues as a result of the policies of his father. During his reign, Mozzafar ad-Din attempted some reforms of the central treasury; however, the previous debt incurred by the Qajar court, owed to both England and Russia, significantly undermined this effort. He furthered this debt by borrowing even more funds from Britain, France, and Russia. These later loans were used to pay earlier loans rather than create new economic developments. In 1908, oil was discovered in Iran but Mozzaffar ad-Din had already awarded William Knox D&#x27;Arcy, a British subject, the rights to oil in most of the country in 1901. 

Like his father he visited Europe three times. During these periods, on the encouragements of his chancellor Amin-os-Soltan, he borrowed money from Nicholas II of Russia to pay for his extravagant traveling expenses. During his first visit he was introduced to the &quot;cinematographe&quot; in Paris, France. Immediately falling in love with the silver screen the Shah ordered his personal photographer to acquire all the equipment and knowledge needed to bring the moving picture to Iran, thus starting Persian cinema. The following is a translated excerpt from the Shah&#x27;s diary:

Additionally, in order to manage the costs of the state and his extravagant personal lifestyle Mozzafar ad-din Shah decided to sign many concessions, providing foreigners with monopolistic control of various Persian industries and markets. One example was the D&#x27;Arcy Oil Concession.

Widespread fears amongst the aristocracy, educated elites, and religious leaders about the concessions and foreign control resulted in some protests in 1906. These resulted in the Shah accepting a suggestion to create a Majles (National Consultative Assembly) in October 1906, by which the monarch&#x27;s power was curtailed as he granted a constitution and parliament to the people. He died of a heart attack 40 days after granting this constitution and was buried in Imam Husayn Shrine in Kerbala.

== Personality and health ==
The responsibilities of leading such a dysfunctional and possibly unstable nation were not suitable for Mozaffar ad-Din Shah&#x27;s character and demeanor. He was hesitant, introverted, erratic, as well as sentimental and prone to superstition. His &quot;nervous disposition&quot; was described by several people who knew him well. Mozaffar ad-Din Shah had hypochondria due to having health issues since he was young. He had a number of illnesses, including a weak heart, but his most severe problem was a chronic kidney infection. Despite this, he enjoyed riding, hunting, and shooting, just as many of his ancestors.

According to the modern Iranian historian Abbas Amanat, Mozaffar ad-Din Shah &quot;possessed neither his father’s panache nor his political skills to pull strings at the court and the divan, or to play the competing European powers off one another to his own advantage. He was a man of gentle disposition, with an earnest desire to open up the country to social and educational reforms.&quot; The British diplomat Mortimer Durand, who was well-acquainted with both shahs, wrote that Mozaffar ad-Din Shah &quot;is more amiable than his father but he is weak and easily misled&quot;.

==Historical anecdotes==
The Shah visited the United Kingdom in August 1902 with the anticipation of also receiving the Order of the Garter as it had been previously given to his father, Naser-ed-Din Shah. King Edward VII refused to give this high honor to a non-Christian. Lord Lansdowne, the Foreign Secretary, had designs drawn up for a new version of the Order, without the Cross of St. George. The King was so enraged by the sight of the design, though, that he threw it out of his yacht&#x27;s porthole. However, in 1903, the King had to back down and the Shah was appointed a member of the Order.

A nephew of his wife was Mohammed Mossadeq, a Prime Minister of Iran during the Pahlavi dynasty. Mossadeq was overthrown by a coup d&#x27;état staged by the United Kingdom and the United States in 1953.

<text>Smart glass, also known as switchable glass, dynamic glass, and smart-tinting glass, is a type of glass that can change its optical properties, becoming opaque or tinted, in response to electrical or thermal signals. This can be used to prevent sunlight and heat from entering a building during hot days, improving energy efficiency. It can also be used to conveniently provide privacy or visibility to a room.

There are two primary classifications of smart glass: active or passive. The most common active glass technologies used today are electrochromic, liquid crystal, and suspended particle devices (SPD). Thermochromic and photochromic are classified as passive technologies.

When installed in the envelope of buildings, smart glass helps to create climate adaptive building shells, which benefits include things such as natural light adjustment, visual comfort, UV and infrared blocking, reduced energy use, thermal comfort, resistance to extreme weather conditions, and privacy. Some smart windows can self-adapt to heat or cool for energy conservation in buildings.
Smart windows can eliminate the need for blinds, shades or window treatments.

Some effects can be obtained by laminating smart film or switchable film onto flat surfaces using glass, acrylic or polycarbonate laminates. Some types of smart films can be applied to existing glass windows using either a self-adhesive smart film or special glue.
Spray-on methods for applying clear coatings to block heat and conduct electricity are also under development.

== History ==
The term &quot;smart window&quot; originated in the 1980s. It was introduced by Swedish material physicist Claes-Göran Granqvist from Chalmers University of Technology, who was brainstorming ideas for making building materials more energy efficient with scientists from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. Granqvist used the term to describe a responsive window capable of dynamically changing its tint.

== Electrically switchable smart glass ==
The following table shows an overview of the different electrically switchable smart glass technologies:

===Electrochromic devices===
Electrochromic devices change light transmission properties in response to voltage and thus allow control over the amount of light and heat passing through. In electrochromic windows, the material changes its opacity. A burst of electricity is required for changing its opacity, but the material maintains its shade with little to no additional electrical signals.

Old electrochromic technologies tend to have a yellow cast in their clear states and blue hues in their tinted states. Darkening occurs from the edges, moving inward, and is a slow process, ranging from many seconds to 20–30 minutes depending on window size. Newer electrochromic technologies eliminate the yellow cast in the clear state and tinting to more neutral shades of gray, tinting evenly rather than from the outside in, and accelerate the tinting speeds to less than three minutes, regardless of the size of the glass. Electrochromic glass maintains visibility in its darkened state and thus preserves visual contact with the outside environment.

Recent advances in electrochromic materials pertaining to transition-metal hydride electrochromics have led to the development of reflective hydrides, which become reflective rather than absorbing, and thus switch states between transparent and mirror-like.

Recent advancements in modified porous nanocrystalline films have enabled the creation of electrochromic display. The single substrate display structure consists of several stacked porous layers printed on top of each other on a substrate modified with a transparent conductor (such as ITO or ). Each printed layer has a specific set of functions. A working electrode consists of a positive porous semiconductor such as titanium dioxide, with adsorbed chromogens. These chromogens change color via reduction or oxidation. A passivator is used as the negative of the image to improve electrical performance. The insulator layer serves the purpose of increasing the contrast ratio and electrically separating the working electrode from the counter electrode. The counter electrode provides a high capacitance to counterbalance the charges inserted/extracted on the SEG electrode (and maintain charge neutrality in the overall device). Carbon is an example of a charge reservoir film. A conducting carbon layer is typically used as the conductive back contact for the counter electrode. In the last printing step, the porous monolith structure is overprinted with a liquid or polymer-gel electrolyte, dried, and then may be incorporated into various encapsulation or enclosures, depending on the application requirements. Displays are very thin, often 30 micrometers. The device can be switched on by applying an electrical potential to the transparent conducting substrate relative to the conductive carbon layer. This causes a reduction of viologen molecules (coloration) to occur inside the working electrode. By reversing the applied potential or providing a discharge path, the device bleaches. A unique feature of the electrochromic monolith is the relatively low voltage (around 1 Volt) needed to color or bleach the viologens. This can be explained by the small over- potentials needed to drive the electrochemical reduction of the surface adsorbed viologens/chromogens.

Most types of smart film require voltage (e.g. 110VAC) to operate, and therefore such types of smart films must be enclosed within glass, acrylic or polycarbonate laminates to provide electrical safety to users.

===Polymer-dispersed liquid-crystal devices===
In polymer-dispersed liquid-crystal devices (PDLCs), liquid crystals are dissolved or dispersed into a liquid polymer followed by solidification or curing of the polymer. During the change of the polymer from a liquid to solid, the liquid crystals become incompatible with the solid polymer and form droplets throughout the solid polymer. The curing conditions affect the size of the droplets that in turn affect the final operating properties of the &quot;smart window&quot;. Typically, the liquid mix of polymer and liquid crystals is placed between two layers of glass or plastic that include a thin layer of a transparent, conductive material followed by curing of the polymer, thereby forming the basic sandwich structure of the smart window. This structure is in effect a capacitor.

Electrodes from a power supply are attached to the transparent electrodes. With no applied voltage, the liquid crystals are randomly arranged in the droplets, resulting in scattering of light as it passes through the smart window assembly. This results in the translucent, &quot;milky white&quot; appearance. When a voltage is applied to the electrodes, the electric field formed between the two transparent electrodes on the glass causes the liquid crystals to align, allowing light to pass through the droplets with very little scattering and resulting in a transparent state. The degree of transparency can be controlled by the applied voltage. This is possible because at lower voltages, only a few of the liquid crystals align completely in the electric field, so only a small portion of the light passes through while most of the light is scattered. As the voltage is increased, fewer liquid crystals remain out of alignment, resulting in less light being scattered. It is also possible to control the amount of light and heat passing through, when tints and special inner layers are used.

=== Suspended-particle devices ===
In suspended-particle devices (SPDs), a thin film laminate of rod-like nano-scale particles is suspended in a liquid and placed between two pieces of glass or plastic, or attached to one layer. When no voltage is applied, the suspended particles are randomly organized, thus blocking and absorbing light. When voltage is applied, the suspended particles align and let light pass. Varying the voltage of the film varies the orientation of the suspended particles, thereby regulating the tint of the glazing and the amount of light transmitted. SPDs can be manually or automatically &quot;tuned&quot; to precisely control the amount of light, glare and heat passing through.

=== Micro-blinds ===

Micro-blinds control the amount of light passing through in response to applied voltage. The micro-blinds are composed of rolled thin metal blinds on glass. They are very small and thus practically invisible to the eye. The metal layer is deposited by magnetron sputtering and patterned by laser or lithography process. The glass substrate includes a thin layer of a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) layer. A thin insulator is deposited between the rolled metal layer and the TCO layer for electrical disconnection. With no applied voltage, the micro-blinds are rolled and let light pass through. When there is a potential difference between the rolled metal layer and the transparent conductive layer, the electric field formed between the two electrodes causes the rolled micro-blinds to stretch out and thus block light. The micro-blinds have several advantages including switching speed (milliseconds), UV durability, customized appearance and transmission. The technology of micro-blinds was developed at the National Research Council (Canada).

== Thermochromic smart glass ==

=== Phase-changing polymer (PCP) ===
Phase-changing polymer (PCP) shows reversible phase transition between amorphous and semicrystalline states. This change of phase is dominated by temperature change in thermochromic smart glass application, making it completely automatic at no electricity cost. The structure of PCP often consists of two major components: a phase-changing component polymer (let&#x27;s call it P1) crosslinked with another polymer (P2) which is strongly phase-separated from the former due to different hydrophilicity. Therefore, P1 and P2 are able to form micron-level phase separation after curing. When the temperature is below the phase-transition temperature (Tp) of P1, P1 is semi-crystalline and its refractive index matches with that of P2, thus making the whole structure transparent to visible light. When the temperature goes above Tp, P1 melts and transitions into amorphous phase which exhibits a large refractive index mismatch with P2, resulting in an opaque appearance. By smartly selecting the material for P1, a reversed effect of transmittance switch can be observed. For example, if at below Tp the refractive index of the semi-crystalline P1 dismatches that of P2, the film then is opaque; if the amorphous P1 matches P2 with respect to refractive index at above Tp, then the film is transparent at the elevated temperature. One signature application would be that, PCP be coated on the glass window of a warehouse where PCP becomes opaque during hot days to block excessive radiation and cools the room down, thus saving energy from running an air conditioner.

==Related areas of technology==
The expression smart glass can be interpreted in a wider sense to include also glazings that change light transmission properties in response to an environmental signal such as light or temperature.

* Different types of glazing can show a variety of chromic phenomena, that is, based on photochemical effects the glazing changes its light transmission properties in response to an environmental signal such as light (photochromism), temperature (thermochromism), or voltage (electrochromism).
* Liquid crystals, when they are in a thermotropic state, can change light transmission properties in response to temperature. However, high temperatures are required to change the properties of liquid crystals and thermotropic liquid crystal compounds can be difficult to synthesize without blocking some wavelengths of the visible colour spectrum.
* Various metals have been investigated. Thin Mg-Ni films have low visible transmittance and are reflective. When they are exposed to H2 gas or reduced by an alkaline electrolyte, they become transparent. This transition is attributed to the formation of magnesium nickel hydride, Mg2NiH4. Films were created by co sputtering from separate targets of Ni and Mg to facilitate variations in composition. Single-target d.c. magnetron sputtering could be used eventually which would be relatively simple compared to deposition of electrochromic oxides, making them more affordable. The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory determined that new transition metals were cheaper and less reactive, but contained the same qualities, thus further reducing the cost.
* Tungsten-doped vanadium dioxide () coating reflects infrared light when the temperature rises over , to block out sunlight transmission through windows at high ambient temperatures. Vanadium dioxide undergoes a semiconductor-to-metal transition at a relatively low temperature. This transition changes the material from have conducting properties to insulating properties and ends up changing the color of the glass as well as its transmission properties. Once the coating undergoes this change, it can effectively keep what it is insulating from gaining heat through filtering out the infrared spectrum.

These types of glazings cannot be controlled manually. In contrast, all electrically switched smart windows can be made to automatically adapt their light transmission properties in response to temperature or brightness by integration with a thermometer or photosensor, respectively.

== Applications ==
=== Electric curtain ===
Smart glass can be used for energy-saving heating and cooling in building by controlling the amount of sunlight which passes through a window. A transparent or haze temperature control film makes the smart film enter a haze state when it is sunny and the indoor temperature is high. When it&#x27;s sunny and the indoor temperature is low, the smart glass enters a transparent state.

=== Privacy ===
In the office:
* Applied to the glass enclosure of a conference room. When the glass is transparent, one can see into or out of the room, and when it is non-transparent it can be used as a projection screen. 
* Energy-saving function of glass curtain wall

Indoor decoration of residence:
*Lighting cover glass curtain, sunshine house, living room and bathroom compartment. The glass is in a cloudy state when out of use, which protects privacy, and when it turns to transparent, it can allow sunlight.

=== Advertising ===
Product display and commercial advertisement:
*Glass display window, protect the products when it is non-transparent, and may be used for projection to introduce products; when it is transparent, it may be used for store advertising.

Smart glass can be used as a switchable projection screen on a store window for advertising. Third generation smart film is good for both front and rear projection, and projected images can be viewed from both sides.

=== Other uses ===
Uses for other special occasions include:
*The glass door of a restroom is transparent when not in use, and immediately turn cloudy when the door is closed.
*Glass floor and stairs on the second floor appear cloudy when walked upon, otherwise they are transparent.
*Privacy uses in hospitals, e.g., windows of infants&#x27; room and intensive care units, replacing curtains, to reduce dust and noise.
*Applied to dust-free rooms and cleaning rooms, smart films may be used to switch between transparent and non-transparent, and can reduce inconvenience for customers having to wear dust-free clothes passing in and out of the room.

<text>The Central Bank of Brazil (, ) is Brazil&#x27;s central bank, the bank is autonomous in exercising its functions, and its main objective is to achieve stability in the purchasing power of the national currency. It was established on Thursday, 31 December 1964.

The bank is not linked to any ministry, currently being autonomous. Like other central banks, the Brazilian central bank is the principal monetary authority of the country. It received this authority when it was founded by three different institutions: the Bureau of Currency and Credit (SUMOC), the Bank of Brazil (BB), and the National Treasury.

One of the main instruments of Brazil&#x27;s monetary policy is the Banco Central do Brasil&#x27;s overnight rate, called the SELIC rate. It is managed by Monetary Policy Committee (COPOM) of the bank.

The bank is active in promoting financial inclusion policy and is a leading member of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion. It is also one of the original 17 regulatory institutions to make specific national commitments to financial inclusion under the Maya Declaration. during the 2011 Global Policy Forum in Mexico.

Since 25 February 2021, it is independent from the Federal Government.

==Independence of the Central Bank==
On 3 November 2020, the bill of the Independence of Central Bank passed the Senate, by 56 votes to 12.

And on 10 February 2021, in the Chamber of Deputies was approved by 339 votes in favor and 114 against without changes, going to President Jair Bolsonaro&#x27;s sanction, generating the Federal Complementary Law No. 179 of 24 February 2021.

With the Federal Complementary Law No. 179 of 24 February 2021, it became autonomous, in addition to gaining a new organizational structure.

<doc id="917142" wikidata="Q163571" url="?curid=917142" title="Symphony No. 1 (Prokofiev)">
<text>The Symphony No. 1 in D major, Op. 25, also known as the &quot;Classical&quot;, was Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s first numbered symphony. He began to compose it in 1916 and completed it on September 10, 1917. It was composed as a modern reinterpretation of the classical style of Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The symphony&#x27;s nickname was bestowed upon it by the composer. It premiered on April 18, 1918, in Petrograd, conducted by Prokofiev. It has remained one of his most popular works.

==Background==
The symphony is composed in a style based on that of Haydn and Mozart, but does not follow them strictly. It has often been described as &quot;neo-classical&quot;. The work was partly inspired by his conducting studies at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, where the instructor, Nikolai Tcherepnin, taught his students about conducting Haydn, among other composers.

The influence of Mozart is apparent in the light, airy scoring and the fast paced bustle of the outer movements but it does deviate from this influence in some surprising ways. Prokofiev&#x27;s own style is noticeable in the way the themes step upward or downward into the neighboring keys before returning to the first one. This is especially true of the second theme of the first movement and of the gavotte.

Prokofiev wrote the symphony on holiday in the country, using it as an exercise in composing away from the piano. This also served to get him away from the violent street fighting of the February Revolution which was then underway in Petrograd.

==Movements==

The symphony is in four movements and lasts about sixteen minutes:
==History==
On December 18, 1916, Prokofiev wrote in his diary, &quot;I look forward with joyous anticipation to the Piano Concerto No. 3, the Violin Concerto, and the &quot;Classical Symphony&quot;.&quot; Six months later in May 1917, he took the &quot;important decision&quot; to compose without the aid of a piano. &quot;For some time&quot;, he wrote, &quot;I contemplated composing my &quot;Classical Symphony&quot; away from the piano, and all the work I had so far done on it I had done in my head. Now I resolved to finish it. It seemed to me that composing with or without a piano was purely a matter of habit, and it would be good to gain more experience with a work as uncomplicated as this symphony.&quot; That same month he continued in a later entry that he had sketched out the symphony, but had yet to pen a final draft in orchestral score. His entry continued: &quot;When our classically inclined musicians and professors (to my mind faux-classical) hear this symphony, they will be bound to scream in protest at this new example of Prokofiev&#x27;s insolence, look how he will not let Mozart lie quiet in his grave but must come prodding at him with his grubby hands, contaminating the pure classical pearls with horrible Prokofievish dissonances. But my true friends will see that the style of my symphony is precisely Mozartian classicism and will value it accordingly, while the public will no doubt just be content to hear happy and uncomplicated music which it will, of course, applaud.&quot; The following month, June 1917, Prokofiev wrote in his diary that he had scrapped the original finale for the symphony, which he felt had seemed &quot;too ponderous and not characterful enough&quot; for a symphony in the classical style: &quot;Asafyev put into my mind an idea he was developing, that there is no true joyfulness to be found in Russian music. Thinking about this, I composed a new finale, lively and blithe enough for there to be a complete absence of minor triads in the whole movement, only major ones. From my original finale I salvaged only the second subject. . . this kind of finale is quite appropriate to Mozartian style.&quot; By the end of summer 1917, Prokofiev wrote that he had finally embarked upon the orchestration of the symphony, but that work was moving slowly at first on account of his unfamiliarity with the music&#x27;s style.

Originally, the &quot;Classical Symphony&quot; was intended to be premiered in Petrograd on November 4, 1917 with the Violin Concerto No. 1. However, this was postponed. On January 18, 1918, Russia adopted the Gregorian calendar, bringing it into line with the Americas and Western Europe. This meant that Prokofiev&#x27;s diary entry for April 5 was actually April 18 under the new calendar, which is now the date accepted as the premiere for the &quot;Classical Symphony&quot;. On April 18, Prokofiev wrote in his diary: &quot;Rehearsal of the &quot;Classical Symphony&quot; with the State Orchestra, I conducted it myself, completely improvising, having forgotten the score and never indeed having studied it from a conducting perspective. I thought it might be a complete debacle, but nothing happened and in any case the parts has so many mistakes in them that the session turned mainly into one for making corrections. In Kislovodsk, I had worried that there would be some antagonism from a &#x27;Revolutionary Orchestra&#x27; playing my new works, but the opposite was the case: the State Orchestra, infused with much new young blood, was flexible and attentive, and played the Symphony with evident enjoyment.&quot;

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for a Classical period-sized orchestra consisting of two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani, and strings.

==Recordings==
Prokofiev recorded a piano arrangement of the &quot;Gavotte&quot; in 1935.

<text>Islamic banking in Malaysia began in September 1963 when Perbadanan Wang Simpanan Bakal-Bakal Haji (PWSBH) was established. PWSBH was set up as an institution for Muslims to save for their Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca) expenses. In 1969, PWSBH merged with Pejabat Urusan Haji to form Lembaga Urusan dan Tabung Haji (now known as Lembaga Tabung Haji).

The first Islamic bank in Malaysia was established in 1983. In 1993, commercial banks, merchant banks and finance companies were allowed to offer Islamic banking products and services under the Islamic Banking Scheme (IBS). These institutions however, are required to separate the funds and activities of Islamic banking transactions from that of the conventional banking business to ensure that there would not be any co-mingling of funds.

The list of banks in Malaysia offering Islamic products (updated in 2015) have grown to 16 banks. Apart from banks, other non-banks intermediaries offering syariah based products are Malaysia Building Society Berhad (MBSB) and cooperatives registered under the Cooperative Commission of Malaysia (SKM).

In Malaysia, the National Shariah Advisory Council additionally set up at Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) advises BNM on the Shariah aspects of the operations of these institutions, as well as on their products and services. In 2006, Bank Negara Malaysia setup International Centre for Education in Islamic Finance (INCEIF) a dedicated University to provide skilled and certified personnel for Islamic Finance in Malaysia. The university was established as part of the Malaysian Government&#x27;s initiative to further strengthen the country&#x27;s position as an international Islamic finance centre. It is the only university in the world that is wholly dedicated to postgraduate study in Islamic Finance.

In June 2005, Dow Jones and Company of New York City and RHB Securities of Kuala Lumpur, teamed up to launch a new &quot;Islamic Malaysia Index&quot; — a collection of 45 stocks representing Malaysian companies that comply with a variety of Sharia-based criteria. Three variables (the total debt of an indexed company, its total cash plus interest-bearing securities and its accounts receivables) must each be less than 33% of the trailing 12-month average capitalization, for example.

<doc id="917146" wikidata="Q12062250" url="?curid=917146" title="Jerome Myers">
<text>Jerome Myers (March 20, 1867 – June 19, 1940) was an American artist and writer associated with the Ashcan School, particularly known for his sympathetic depictions of the urban landscape and its people. He was one of the main organizers of the 1913 Armory Show, which introduced European modernism to America.

Born in Petersburg, Virginia, and raised in Philadelphia, Trenton and Baltimore, he spent his adult life in New York City. Myers worked briefly as an actor and scene painter. He then studied art for a year at Cooper Union followed by study at the Art Students League over a period of eight years where his main teacher was George de Forest Brush. In 1896 he went to Paris, but only stayed a few months, believing that his main classroom was the streets of New York&#x27;s Lower East Side. His strong interest and feelings for the new immigrants resulted in over a thousand drawings, as well as paintings, etchings and watercolors that depicted their lives outside of the tenements which were their first homes in America.

In a 1923 magazine article he explained why cities were his greatest source of inspiration:

All my life I had lived, worked and played in the poorest streets of American cities. I knew them and their population and was one of them. Others saw ugliness and degradation there, I saw poetry and beauty, so I came back to them. I took a sporting chance of saying something out of my own experience and risking whether it was worthwhile or not. That is all any artist can do.

==Life and career==
===Early years===

Born in Petersburg, Virginia, Jerome Myers was one of Abram and Julia Hillman Myers&#x27; five children. His brother, Gustavus Myers, later became a prominent muckraking journalist, socialist activist, and historian. As their father was often absent, the Myers children were raised by their mother and eventually lived in Trenton, New Jersey, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. From time to time, the siblings were placed in foster homes when their mother was ill. Given these family hardships, Myers began taking odd jobs at a young age, living in Baltimore, Maryland, before moving on to New York City. Arriving in Manhattan in 1886 at the age of nineteen, Myers worked for several years as a scene painter and later for the Moss Engraving Company, where he reproduced photographic negatives. During this time he began attending evening art classes at Cooper Union and the Art Students League. Even then, his interest in urban subjects was evident. Myers&#x27; earliest oil painting, &quot;Backyard&quot; (1888), depicting a clotheslines silhouetted against distant tenements, is today thought to be one of the first paintings exemplifying Ashcan School subject matter in America. Similarly, around 1893, after sketching a canal boat during a day trip along the Morris and Essex Canal, Myers made his first sale to the woman who lived on the boat. The price was two dollars.

===Becoming a professional artist===

In 1895, Myers found work in the art department of the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;. With savings of two hundred and fifty dollars from this job, he traveled to Paris in 1896. Upon his return to New York City, with only twenty dollars left, he rented, for seven dollars a month, a studio at 232 West 14th Street in a former five-story mansion, &quot;equipped with a skylight and converted to the use of artists.&quot; There, his next door neighbor was Edward Adam Kramer, a painter just one year older than Myers himself. While Myers&#x27; art training had been limited to short stints at New York&#x27;s Cooper Union and the Art Students League, Kramer had acquired his education in the European art centers of Munich, Berlin, and Paris. It was Kramer who ushered Myers into the world of the professional artist. One day, when the art dealer William Macbeth arrived at Kramer&#x27;s studio to view work, Kramer directed him to Myers&#x27; studio as well. Macbeth purchased two small paintings of his early New York street scenes from Myers on the spot, and simultaneously recommended that he bring additional work to the gallery. Macbeth thought highly of these two paintings and, taking them to his gallery, soon sold one to the banker, James Speyer. As an early critic for the &quot;New York Globe&quot; stated: &quot;Myers&#x27; reputation dates from that purchase.&quot; Macbeth also suggested that Myers relinquish drawing in pencil and pastel and turn to oils. In the years following 1902, Myers sold work through the Macbeth Gallery and exhibited in group shows at other venues. In March and April 1903, when the Colonial Club of New York held its annual art show, &quot;Exhibition of Paintings Mainly by New Men&quot;, among the twenty artists included were Robert Henri, John French Sloan, and Myers, showing their works together for the first time.

===Summer in Manhattan===

For Jerome Myers, summer in Manhattan provided particular opportunities for depicting immigrant life in the urban landscape. The hot weather brought the tenement dwellers out into the streets and parks of the city. By July 1906, Myers&#x27; reputation as an artist depicting the life of the people on the Lower East Side was such that a &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter was assigned to him, beginning at five o&#x27;clock one morning, to observe the artist capturing likenesses of the adults at work and children at play. To walk through the East Side with Myers, the reporter noted, &quot;turning off here and there to glance at some particular house or group of people, ... [was] to receive an impression of a joyous life lived in the open air for much the same reason as people live in that fashion in Europe—because their homes are not as comfortable as the streets.&quot;
Individual responses to Myers&#x27; presence, however, were grounded in cultural differences. While the residents of Italian neighborhoods viewed the artist and his activities with excitement and curiosity, those of the Jewish Quarter, whose traditions often forbade the production of representational images, protested by moving away from the artist&#x27;s range of vision.

===Later years===
Myers won the Altman Prize for &quot;Street Shrine&quot; in 1931 and again in 1937 for &quot;City Playground&quot;. He was awarded the National Academy&#x27;s Carnegie Prize in 1936 and the Isidor Medal in 1938. In 1934 the Metropolitan Museum of Art had purchased the painting &quot;Street Group&quot; from the Municipal Art Exhibition in Rockefeller Center. The &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; reported:
the painting by Mr. Myers is of a group of women standing talking in a somber street, with children playing about them. Mr. Myers considers it typical of his work, and says it is the sort of scene he most enjoys to paint. &quot;Old streets and old houses and the people who live in them,&quot; he explained. &quot;I am trying to catch the New York that is passing,&quot; he said. &quot;I painted that down on Delancey Street seven or eight years ago and already the scene has changed in spirit. I want to get it before it is gone.&quot;

Twenty two years earlier, in 1912, the Metropolitan had made its first purchase of a Myers painting, &quot;The Mission Tent&quot;. The June 1913 &quot;Metropolitan Museum Bulletin&quot; wrote:

Jerome Myers for several years has been showing New Yorkers the artistic possibilities of what is perhaps the unique part of the city&#x27;s scenes. He has discovered these subjects for himself and treats them in his own way. It is never the exciting moments of street life that move him, only the daily happenings, the usual things that all may see. Boys and girls playing in the square, the crowd at a recreation pier, an organ-grinder followed by a troop of dancing children, old people whom the night freshness lures to the park-bench or the wharf, a religious festival in Little Italy—these are his favorite themes and he renders them with loving sincerity and a profound appreciation of their significance.
Not only was the sale to the Metropolitan a great honor then, but it also provided him with enough money to move his family from their small studio into a more spacious one in the new Carnegie Hall. Over the years, despite moving around to various studios, he always came back to Carnegie as his real home.

Myers died in his Carnegie studio on June 19, 1940, after a series of illnesses complicated by an injury sustained from a fall. He was 73. Earlier that year, he had published his autobiography, &quot;Artist In Manhattan&quot;. In their obituary for Myers, published in July 1940, &quot;The Art Digest&quot; wrote:

Though Myers later achieved wide honors—he was elected to the Academy and awarded such important prizes as the Altman, the Carnegie and the Isidor Medal—he suffered from neglect in recent years. Forgotten, for the most part, were Myers&#x27; distinctive contributions to our native art and the battles he has fought for art freedom.

In April–May 1941 the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City held the &quot;Jerome Myers Memorial Exhibition&quot; with over 90 of his paintings, drawings and etchings lent by museums throughout the United States as well as private collectors. The oil paintings exhibited ranged from his 1905 &quot;The Tambourine&quot; to a self-portrait completed in 1939, the year before his death. Myers was survived by his wife and fellow artist Ethel Myers whom he had married in 1905 and their daughter, the dancer Virginia Myers. Following her husband&#x27;s death Ethel devoted much of her time to furthering his artistic reputation. She lectured on his work throughout the United States, under the auspices of the American Federation of Arts from 1941 to 1943 and maintained the Jerome Myers Memorial Gallery in New York City for a number of years.

<text>Charles Samuel Myers, CBE, FRS (13 March 1873 – 12 October 1946) was an English physician who worked as a psychologist. Although he did not invent the term, his first academic paper, published by &quot;The Lancet&quot; in 1915, concerned &quot;shell shock&quot;. In 1921 he was co-founder of the National Institute of Industrial Psychology.

==Biography==

===Family background===

Myers was born in Kensington, London on 13 March 1873, the eldest son of Wolf Myers, a merchant, and his wife, Esther Eugenie Moses. His family was Jewish. In the 1881 census he is an 8-year-old scholar living at 27 Arundel Gardens, Kensington, London with his parents, 4 brothers and 4 servants.

In the 1891 census he was a scholar, aged 18 living at 49 Leinster Gardens, Paddington, London, with his parents, 4 brothers, a visitor, and 4 servants (cook, housemaid, parlourmaid, and ladies&#x27; maid).

===Education===

He attended the City of London School where he studied sciences. Of this experience he wrote:

He attended Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he took a first in each part of the Natural Sciences tripos (1893 and 1895). He was Arnold Gerstenberg student in 1896 (this fund was set up in 1892 for the promotion of the study of Moral Philosophy and Metaphysics among students of Natural Sciences), and received the degree Doctor in Medicine from Gonville and Caius in October 1901. He also trained at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital in London. It was at Cambridge where he joined Freemasonry and was initiated Isaac Newton University Lodge.

===Travels and study of ethnic music===
In 1898 he joined W. H. R. Rivers and William McDougall on the Cambridge anthropological expedition organised by Alfred Cort Haddon to the Torres Straits and Sarawak. Here he studied ethnic music, carrying out research on rhythm in Borneo. In 1906 he contributed an appendix entitled &quot;Traces of African Melody in Jamaica&quot; to the book &quot;Jamaican Song and Story&quot; by Walter Jekyll.

===Early career===
Between 1901 and 1902 Myers was involved in the collection of anthropometric measurements of Egyptians.
On his return to England he was appointed house physician at St Bartholomew&#x27;s. In 1902 he returned to Cambridge to help Rivers teach the physiology of the special senses.

In 1904 Myers married Edith Babette, youngest daughter of Isaac Seligman, a merchant in London; they had three daughters and two sons. Myers remained in Cambridge to become, in succession, demonstrator, lecturer, and, in 1921, reader in experimental psychology. From 1906 to 1909 he was also professor in experimental psychology at London University.

In 1909, when W.H.R. Rivers resigned a part of his Lectureship, Myers became the first lecturer at Cambridge University whose whole duty was to teach experimental psychology. For this he received a stipend of £50 a year. He held this position until 1930.

From 1911 Myers co-edited the &quot;British Journal of Psychology&quot; with Rivers. In 1914 he took over as sole editor, continuing in this post until 1924.

In 1912, Myers used his enthusiasm and ability to raise funds to establish the first English laboratory especially designed for experimental psychology at Cambridge. He became the laboratory&#x27;s first Director and held this position until 1930. (The Cambridge Laboratory of Experimental Psychology).

===First World War===

In 1915 Myers was given a commission in the Royal Army Medical Corps and in 1916 he was appointed consultant psychologist to the British armies in France with a staff of assistants at Le Touquet. In 1915 Myers was the first to use the term &quot;shell shock&quot; in an article in &quot;The Lancet&quot;, though he later acknowledged in 1940 that he did not invent the term. He tried to save shell-shocked soldiers from execution.

He became frustrated with opposition to his views during his time in the military, particularly the view that shell-shock was a treatable condition. His efforts have been called &quot;a pioneering but frustrating struggle to get psychological evidence and applied psychology accepted&quot; He was so upset by the rejection of his ideas by the military authorities that he refused to give evidence to the Southborough Committee on shell-shock because, as he wrote in 1940, &quot;the recall of my past five years&#x27; work proved too painful for me.&quot;

In the last year of the war he devised tests and supervised their application for the selection of men suited to hydrophone work for detecting enemy submarines.

===Postwar career===

After the war, Myers returned to his Cambridge position. But here too he was deeply dissatisfied, wanting wider opportunities for the development of his more practical interests, and feeling that official and academic circles showed little genuine interest in psychology. From 1922 Myers devoted himself to the development of the National Institute of Industrial Psychology (NIIP) which he had founded with Henry John Welch in 1921. He was also involved in what became the Industrial Health Research Board.

He attended the Second Congress of the International Industrial Relations Institute held at Girton College, Cambridge in 1928.

When en the advisory committee on personnel selection was set up by the War Office, he was appointed a member.
He delivered the Bradshaw Lecture at the Royal College of Physicians in 1933 on &quot;A Psychological Regard for Medical Education&quot;.

He died at his home in Winsford, near Minehead, Somerset in 1946.

The Charles Myers Library was set up by the National Institute of Industrial Psychology and is currently incorporated into the Wellcome Library Girton College, Cambridge in June 1928.

===Myers and the British Psychological Society===

Myers was an early member of The Psychological Society, founded in 1901, which would later become the British Psychological Society in 1906. In January 1904, Myers became the first Secretary of the Society. In 1919 Myers suggested that membership should be opened up to &quot;all those interested in various branches of psychology&quot;.

He was elected as the first President of the Society, following its enlargement and held this position between 1920 and 1923.

In 1920, Myers represented the BPS on the board of management of a new journal, &quot;Discovery&quot;, which dealt with the recent advances in scientific knowledge. Myers was also the Society&#x27;s representative on the committee formed to consider a memorial to the W. H. R. Rivers. A fund was raised for the furtherance of the sciences to which Rivers had been interested, in particular anthropology and psychology.

<text>Charles Solomon &quot;Buddy&quot; Myer (March 16, 1904 – October 31, 1974) was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a second baseman from through . A two-time All-Star, Myer was notable for being the American League batting champion and led the American League in stolen bases in 1928. An excellent hitter, he batted .300 or better nine times, and retired with a career average of .303. Myer walked more than twice as many times as he struck out. Apart from a brief period with the Boston Red Sox in 1927–28, he spent his entire career with the Washington Senators.

==Early life==
Myer was born in Ellisville, Mississippi, the son of Maud (née Stevens) and Charles Solomon Myer, a merchant and cotton buyer. He was of German and English descent. His father&#x27;s family was of Jewish descent but had converted in an earlier generation. During his lifetime, Myer was incorrectly reported to be Jewish.

==Career==

Myer decided to go to college at Mississippi A&amp;M (now Mississippi State University). In 1923, he attracted many baseball scouts to watch him play. That same year, the Washington Senators offered him a contract. Buddy accepted the contract with the one condition, that he finish his college education. Myer graduated from Mississippi A&amp;M in 1925.

He was discovered by baseball promoter, Joe Engel, who managed the Chattanooga Lookouts at Engel Stadium.

He broke in with the Senators in 1925 at the age of 21. In 1926 he batted .304. In May 1927 he was traded by the Senators to the Red Sox for Topper Rigney.

In 1928 he stole a career-high 30 bases for the Red Sox, leading the league, while batting .313, and was 5th in the league with 26 sacrifice hits. He came in 9th in AL MVP voting.

After the season, the Senators got him back, but had to give up five ballplayers in trade. In December 1928 the Red Sox traded him to the Senators for Milt Gaston, Hod Lisenbee, Bobby Reeves, Grant Gillis, and Elliot Bigelow.

In 1929 he batted .300, and the following year he batted .303 with an 8th-best 114 runs scored. In 1932 he had a career-high 16 triples (2nd), and scored a career-high 120 runs (6th). In 1933 he batted .302, and in 1934 he batted .305 with 102 walks (4th in the league) and a .419 on-base percentage (6th).

In 1935 he won the American League batting title with a .349 mark. He had 215 hits (2nd in the league), a .440 on-base percentage and 96 walks (4th), played in 151 games (5th), scored 115 runs (7th), and had 100 RBIs. He was voted to the All Star team, and came in 4th in MVP voting that year.

In 1933, Myer was involved in what many still consider to be baseball&#x27;s most violent brawl, between him and the Yankees&#x27; Ben Chapman. It is alleged that Chapman – who later gained great infamy for his taunting of Jackie Robinson in 1947, while Chapman was the manager of the Phillies – not only spiked Myer, but hurled a number of antisemitic epithets at him. Chapman and Myer&#x27;s fight spread to the dugouts and the stands. Long suspensions for all involved followed.

In 1937 he was selected for the All-Star Game, and ended the year with a .407 OBP (9th in the league).

In 1938 he had another outstanding season, finishing 4th in the league with a .336 batting average, 2nd in OBP with .454 , and 7th in walks with 93. In 1939 he batted .302 in a partial season, his 9th and final time eclipsing the .300 mark.

He died at age 70 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

Throughout his career, Myer was often referred to as being Jewish. Baseball historian Bill James reported that Myer &quot;told a home-town newspaperman shortly before his death in 1974 that he was not Jewish, he was German&quot;, . Myer&#x27;s father was Jewish, his mother was not. Despite not identifying as Jewish, Myer &quot;never set the record straight&quot; during his career, even starting an altercation with Yankees outfielder Ben Chapman after Chapman attempted to spike him and called him a Jewish slur.

<text>The Bergen Line, or the Bergen Railway ( or ), is a long scenic standard gauge railway line between Bergen and Hønefoss, Norway. The name is often applied to the entire route from Bergen to Oslo, including the Randsfjord and Drammen lines between Hønefoss and Oslo, covering a total distance of . It is the highest mainline railway line in Northern Europe, crossing the Hardangervidda plateau at above sea level.

The railway opened from Bergen to Voss in 1883 as the narrow gauge Voss Line. In 1909 the route was continued over the mountain to Oslo and the whole route converted to standard gauge, and the Voss Line became part of the Bergen Line. The line is single track, and was electrified in 1954–64. The Bergen Line is owned and maintained by Bane NOR, and served with passenger trains by Vy Tog and freight trains by CargoNet. The Flåm Line remains as the only branch line, after the closure of the Hardanger Line. The western section from Bergen to Voss is also served by the Bergen Commuter Rail, and was shortened following the 1966 opening of the Ulriken Tunnel.

== History ==

=== The Voss Line ===
The first documented proposal for building a railway between Norway&#x27;s two largest cities was announced by Andreas Tanberg Gløersen on 24 August 1871 in &quot;Bergensposten&quot;. The forest supervisor in Voss suggested building the railway via Voss and Hallingdal, connecting with the Krøderen Line. In 1866, Gløersen had come up with the idea of the Jæren Line. Within days of his proposal for the Bergen Line, the city council expressed support for the suggestion. In 1872, the railway director Carl Abraham Pihl and two engineers went on a survey tour along suggested line. At the time it was common that proposals for railways came from local initiative, and that local municipalities and private investors would then pay for about 20% of the investments, the state covering the rest, mostly through foreign debt.

==== Political processes ====
On 20 October 1871 two engineers traversed the two possible routes from Bergen to Voss; the one via Fana, Os and Hardangerfjord, the other via Dale and Sørfjord. Though covering a less populated area, the latter would be cheaper to build, and have less elevation. A railway committee was created on 25 January 1872 with a limited mandate, which was expanded on 20 December. At the same time there was a dispute between the Ministry of Labour and Pihl about whether to prioritize the Bergen Line, but in July 1872 surveys were performed in person by Pihl and two engineers, and their report was positive. At the same time he launched the idea of a branch line up Valdres to Lærdal.

By 1873, an agreement had been reached as to the right-of-way to Voss, but not onwards towards Oslo. On 13 January 1874, the Bergen city council started issuing stock for the Voss Line, to begin with 400,000 Norwegian speciedaler (NOK 1.6 million) were issued. In the 1873 parliamentary election the railway supporter Peter Jebsen was elected, spending the next few years furiously defending the railway. Parliament chose to not issue new railway projects in the 1874 session, and instead adopt a complete plan for all railway construction in the country—to be proposed by a committee. When the committee reported on 20 March 1875, the Voss Line was not included since it could not show a higher profitability than 1%. During the 1875 session there was not a majority for the Voss Line, partially due to the lack of capital available from local investors. This was based on a claim from Johan Jørgen Schwartz, the chairman of the committee, that the investment costs were underestimated. This was countered by Nils Henrik Bruun, a constructor from Bergen, who was willing to construct all tunnels on the railway for less than the budgeted sum. When Jebsen in addition was willing to act as personal guarantee for Bruun in case of his death, the majority in the parliament shifted. On 9 June 1875 parliament voted with 61 against 42 to build the Voss Line.

==== Construction ====
The Voss Line was built with narrow gauge, . The first parts of the construction started in December 1875, while the largest part started in March 1876. During the winter the engineers had done the last finesses on the plans. At any given time at least 800 men worked on construction, and at the peak 1,800 men were employed. They worked 12 hours per day, for which they had a daily wage of NOK 2.55, the highest wage for navvies in the country. To a large extent the labor came from Sweden, who had just finished the Norway/Vänern Line and had an excess of skilled labor for construction. This import of labor had the effect of pumping money into the local economy, and several taverns were built along the line. There were some accidents, and several deaths among the workers.

The construction work was finished in 1882 and some test services began, though not scheduled until the spring of 1883. Official opening commenced on 11 July 1883. Many of the navvies settled on Vossebanen after construction, and started working for the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) on the operation of the line.

=== Construction of the Bergen Line ===

By the time the Voss Line was completed Norway had entered a recession. Parliament was not willing to give more money to railways, and the country had to make do with a transport plan launched in 1886 that did not follow up with any funding. On 1 March 1894 parliament after five days of debate chose, with 60 against 53 votes, to build the Bergen Line. Several different routes had been proposed, including over Krøderen, or down Numedal (where the Numedal Line would later be built). In the end Hallingdal was chosen, connecting to Hønefoss and on to Oslo via Sandvika. To save costs a preliminary line would connect Hønefoss to Roa with the branch Roa–Hønefoss Line. The final line would run along the Gjøvik Line to Oslo. The line would also connect to the rest of the network via the Randsfjorden Line at Hønefoss.
Local financing was ready within a year, yet it took six years to survey the line properly, and construction start had to wait until 1901. Construction started with the building of roads to get in supplies to the construction sites, completed in 1902. The construction was exceptionally challenging, taking place at high altitudes in a region without roads and with a climate that saw many metres of snow in the winter and temperatures far below freezing. 113 tunnels, totaling had to be built; the longest, the Gravehalsen Tunnel, alone costing NOK 3 million and was the longest tunnel north of the Alps. It took six years to build, and had to be excavated manually through solid gneiss. Laying of track was started in 1906, and in 1907 the two groups, both having started at their own end, met at Ustaoset. A small celebration was held at the spot (see image).

It had been decided that the Bergen Line, unlike the Voss Line, was to be built with standard gauge. So, the newly laid line from Bergen to Voss had to be converted in time for the opening of the Bergen Line. This was especially challenging because of the continuous traffic on the line, with 36 departures per day to Nesttun, six to Garnes and four to Voss. In preparation a few curves had to be straightened, the tunnels widened and the bridges strengthened. On the night of 10–11 August 1904 all the track was changed and in the morning the trains could operate on standard gauge to Voss.

The first services started on 1 July 1907 from Voss to Myrdal. An official opening train attempted to cross part of the line to Gulsvik on 9 December 1907, but got stuck in heavy snow and had to return. The railway had to close and it took one and a half months to clear it of snow. Even a rotary snowplow at 750 kW was not powerful enough to get rid of the snow. A new attempt to open the line in 1908 succeeded, and a train ran from Gulsvik to Bergen. The line from Roa to Gulsvik was still under construction, so passage was along the Drammen Line via the Krøder Line with ship over Krøderen to Gulsvik. The first scheduled train from Oslo West Station to Bergen departed on 10 June 1908.

On 25 November 1909 a train en route from Bergen rolled into Oslo Østbanestasjon, and two days later the railway was officially opened at Voss. King Haakon VII stated upon the opening that the line was the Norwegian engineering masterpiece of his generation.
=== World War Two ===

In World War II, during the German occupation of Norway, it was a demanding time for the Norwegian State Railways as a whole. This railway line was also very busy. The track was in heavy use for both German military and civilian transportation, and much of the equipment and maintenance was lacking.

On 28 February 1944, a descending eastbound freight train loaded with oil and petrol lost its braking power and became a runaway train, finally ploughing into a westbound passenger train at Breifoss, just east of Geilo. The crash and subsequent fire killed 25 civilians and an unknown number of German soldiers. Poor lubrication oil combined with the cold weather is believed to have caused the accident.
===Post-war electrification ===
With Norway&#x27;s abundance of hydroelectricity and the high cost of importing coal to run the steam locomotives, there was considerable economic benefit to be realised by electrifying the line. Plans for the electrification of the line had existed since the line was opened. In 1912 the line from Nesttun to Bergen was proposed electrified and rebuilt to double track, following the opening of the electrified Thamshavn Line in 1908. During the planning of the Hardanger Line and the Flåm Line during the 1930s it was again proposed to electrify the line. However, although both the branch lines were built with electric traction, the main line was not. Counter-suggestions were raised proposing a conversion to the locomotives running on oil or coal dust. In 1939 a plan for national electrification was launched, and the Voss Line was top priority. But the breakout of World War II set the plans back, and not until the 1950s was it again possible to afford such investments. Vossebanen took electric traction into use on 2 July 1954. The electricity is supplied via an overhead line.

In 1952 a new plan was launched by parliament to electrify of railway, with the line from Voss to Hønefoss prioritized fourth. This section of the line was considered &quot;difficult&quot; because of tight curves, difficult track alignment; and also that the Overhead line might be vulnerable to bad weather, particularly snow and ice. A test 16.5KV transformer was set up at Finse to see if the catenary could be kept ice-free, and it could.

The following year NSB launched the &quot;away with the steam&quot; campaign that would replace all steam locomotives with electric or diesel traction. Since electrification was not imminent, the NSB introduced diesel traction on the Bergen Line in 1958. The line was electrified in four stages, from Roa to Hønefoss on 1 February 1961, from Hønefoss to Ål on 1 December 1962, from Ål to Ustaoset on 15 December 1963 and finally from Ustaoset to Voss on 7 December 1964. As the point of electrification moved across the mountain, so did the point NSB changed locomotive on the train. The new locomotive El 13 was put into service on the electric parts. The electrification cost NOK 143 million.

The express trains have as one of the main lines always been allocated the newest locomotives by NSB. When the El 14 was delivered in 1968, it was put into service on Bergensbanen, as was the El 16 in 1977, the El 17 in 1981, and finally the El 18 in 1996. The older locomotives have been relegated to freight service. In 2000 electric multiple units were put into service with the Class 73 tilting trains, branded as Signatur and capable of . However, they cannot be used at those speeds on any part of the Bergen Line, and only some parts of the Asker Line and around Finse can they operate quicker than the other rollingstock used. There has also been reason to doubt their winter capability on the very demanding Bergen Line. Occasionally they have been stuck in the snow, and on 21 February 2007, a multiple unit derailed after running into a pack of snow. As refurbished carriages become available, the multiple units will be removed from the line, and replaced by traditional locomotive-hauled trains.

=== Operator(s) ===

====1883 to 1996 ====
The Norwegian State Railways ( or NSB), a government agency / directorate, was the state-owned railway organisation which operated the majority of the railway network in Norway between 1883 and the end of 1996.

==== 1997 to 2017 ====
On 1 December 1996, Norwegian State Railways (NSB) was demerged to create three organisations: 
*the infrastructure operator Norwegian National Rail Administration; 
*the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate;
*and the train operator () (Norwegian State Railways BA or NSB): the BA indicating a limited liability company without shares. The name and logo &quot;NSB&quot; continued to be used by the train operator Norges Statsbaner BA.

==== 2017 onwards ====
On 1 January 2017, as part of the railway reforms: 
*the Norwegian National Rail Administration was split into Bane NOR, the government agency responsible for railway infrastructure; and the Norwegian Railway Directorate, a government agency having strategic responsibility of the railway network;
* the (), (Norwegian State Railways BA), or NSB BA, changed from a limited liability company without shares to one that had shares, so the BA became an AS. The new names were: () or NSB AS: the AS indicating that it was now a limited company with a share holding.
*On 24 April 2019 NSB was renamed Vygruppen and rebranded as Vy.

==Infrastructure upgrades==
=== Ulriken Tunnel ===
==== The &quot;old&quot; 1960s tunnel ====

In September 1954, Rieber suggested a package for the politicians, where he would create a company that would borrow money to build both the Ulriken Tunnel, a shortening of the line from Hønefoss to Sandvika (the &quot;proposed&quot; Ringerike Line) and electrify the railway. This would save . Since NSB based their fares on the route length travelled, financing would be covered by a surcharge equal to the distance saved; ticket price would remain the same and within twenty years the debt would be covered. The government opposed the suggestion — the newspaper editor and Norwegian Labour Party politician Trygve Bratteli commenting that even though the financing was private, it would still have to use the same funding as government debt, and would jeopardize other projects, like the Nordland Line.

Shortly afterwards a revised plan, the &quot;Little Rieberplan&quot; was accepted. The first of the line from Bergen to Takvam represented a very roundabout way, and it was clear that it would be possible to reduce the line by with the construction of three single-track tunnels, Ulriken Tunnel (), Arnanipa Tunnel () and Tunestveit Tunnel (). This plan was approved by parliament in 1956, based on private financing from the businessman Fritz Rieber. Construction started in 1959 with the tunnels being finished in 1963, while track laying was finished on 29 May 1964, when the first train entered the tunnel. As the new tunnel line deviated from the original line near Arna, a new Arna station had to be constructed adjacent to the tunnel mouth. This also opened in May 1964. The opening of this tunnel meant that it replaced part of the original and that part was no longer needed as a main line. It became a heritage line: the Old Voss Line ().

As of May 2nd 2024 there is double track service between Bergen central station and Arna station.

==== The second (new) tunnel ====
In January 2016, Norwegian National Rail Administration had plans for doubling the Ultriken tunnel, but it was abolished at the end of that year. Bane NOR who took over the responsibilities for the network, authorised its contractors to start building a second single-track tunnel through the mountain adjacent to the 1960s tunnel. It was to be constructed in a number of main contracts: the first was boring the single-bore ) tunnel, which began in January 2016, and was completed on 29 August 2017. The second was the installation of the infrastructure: installing the rails in the form of a cast fixed track; the overhead catenary; a tunnel drainage system; installing a remotely-controlled signalling system both in the tunnel and at Arna station, to replace the manually controlled system at Arna station that has been in use since 1964; and upgrading half of Arna station. The new tunnel opened on 13 December 2020 and the signalling system was linked into the train control centre in Bergen. 

Because of space constraints at Arna station, due to the need to move trains between platforms within the station, the new tunnel has a double portal at Arna station and is double-tracked for a short distance, before combining into a single running track.

==== The resultant double tunnel ====
Bane NOR awarded a contract to Grupo Azvi to refurbish the old 1960s tunnel, with work due to start in February 2021 and due to finish in June 2023. The requirement is do this refurbishment without lifting the existing rail track. As part of this work it will be fire-proofed; two diagonal tunnels at the Arna end are to be blasted between the old and the new tunnels to allow trains to switch from one to the other; as well as blasting 16 other common interconnections for escape and for installing infrastructure. 

Double running will only be achieved when the refurbishment of the old 1960s tunnel is complete; and the second half of Arna station, linked to the old tunnel has been rebuilt. To obtain the full benefit of this work, it is intended to double the track all the way from the tunnel to Bergen.

=== Oslo Tunnel ===
In 1980, the Oslo Tunnel was opened, allowing trains along the Drammen Line to go to the new Oslo Central Station, an upgrade of the former Oslo Ø. As a consequence of this, passenger trains were since the late 1980s rerouted via Drammen instead of via Roa, following the Drammen Line and the Randsfjord Line to Hønefoss. This allows the trains to pass through more densely populated areas and on trackage with more capacity. However, the change of route actually increased the length between the two termini by . But the better track standard via Drammen results in about the same travel time. Freight trains still goes via Roa.

=== Finse Tunnel ===


During winter NSB had large costs keeping the line snow-free. Large diesel-electric snowploughs were stationed at Finse, and tens of kilometers of snow sheds were built on the most vulnerable parts. Especially the part between Finse Station and Hallingskeid was a drain on resources, and heavy snowfall and drifts regularly closed the entire line. A solution was proposed by NSB&#x27;s director Robert Nordén in 1984, involving construction of a tunnel between the two stations. In the tunnel there had to be a long passing loop, to ensure even distances between passing loops along the line. 

In 1989 the Parliament of Norway approved the plans, including the upgrade of part of the line east of Finse. In total NOK 750 million was invested in rebuilding of line, shortening it by . At the same time the permitted speed could be increased from to . The tunnel opened on 16 June 1992 while the rest of the upgrades opened in five steps between 1995 and 1998. The highest point on the line, previously at , became —located inside the tunnel. After the tunnel opened, the Finse snow removal facility was closed.

=== Hallingskeid Station and snow tunnels ===

Snow drifts and harsh weather (see &quot;Construction of the Bergen Line&quot; section above) had been a problem in the higher-altitude regions of the Bergen line: in one case causing the abandonment of an official opening in December 1909. Hallingskied station is a station built on the Hardangervidda plateau, within an area without population or road access, at an elevation of 1,110 meters (3,640 ft) above mean sea level. The station therefore serves trekkers and mountaineers.

The first station, built in the early 1900s, did not have a snow tunnel when it opened, but snow tunnels and snow fences were progressively added after the autumn of 1909 to cover the running line, the passing loop and the station itself. Part of the snow tunnel caught fire in 1948 and spread to the station; and, there was another fire in the snow tunnel in 1953. Yet another fire in 1960, this time external to the tunnel, caused the loss of the snow tunnel; the railway station, which was rebuilt in 1970; and the station hotel, which was not replaced.

On 16 June 2011, a possible welding accident may have been the &quot;cause behind a fire&quot; in the snow tunnel at Hallingskeid Station. The fire lead to the complete destruction of all infrastructure in the snow tunnel, the twin Class 73 electric multiple unit trapped in the tunnel as the electrical supply to the catenary failed; and Telenor telephone cables and communications systems in the area. There were no injuries to the passengers, but they lost all their belongings left behind in the train. This closed the line for seven-days between Myrdal and Finse; and through traffic on the Bergen line did not reopen until the evening of 23 June 2011. The official accident report, published in May 2012 by the Norwegian Safety Investigation Authority was unable to establish a clear and demonstrable direct cause for the fire: but they stated that the highest risks were Hot work, electrical installations, or hot particles from trains.

== Operation ==
The Bergen Line as a through line is used for up to five express trains operated by Norwegian State Railways, as well as freight trains by CargoNet. From Myrdal to Bergen there are commuter rail services operated by NSB.

=== Line ===
The total distance from Oslo to Bergen via Drammen is , while the Bergen Line proper is . The line has 182 tunnels, totaling ca. , of which ten are over . Finse Station remains the highest elevated station at , while the highest point is now in the Finse Tunnel at .

==== Oslo – Hønefoss ====
Section Oslo – Drammen see

→ Main article: Drammenbanen

Section Drammen – Hønefoss see

→ Main article: Randsfjordbanen

==== Hønefoss – Geilo ====
Hønefoss in &quot;Storelva (Ringerike)&quot; valley is left by the line northwest into the &quot;Sogna&quot; valley, where the route uses its northern valley flanks to Sokna. To get to the Krøderen (lake) valley, Bergen Line follows &quot;Rudselva&quot;, passes by &quot;Langevannet&quot; and &quot;Breidvanne&quot;t lakes and also through the 2.3 kilometer &quot;Haversting tunnel&quot;, which runs parallel to the Norwegian National Road 7, (), &quot;Ørgenvik tunnel&quot;. Hallingdal valley is used as a natural corridor further north-west, mostly on the left river bank, serving the larger settlements of Flå and Nesbyen. At &quot;Svenkerud&quot; to the north of Nesbyen the valley flank is changed. Soutwestbound to &quot;Gol&quot;, the ascent becomes gradually steeper in the following section to Geilo.

==== Geilo-Voss (Hardangervidda) ====
The Hardangervidda is actually crossed behind Geilo. Located in the valley of one of the two upper tributaries of Hallingdalselva, the Usteåne, the railway line runs alongside a number of smaller lakes to the culmination point near Finse. Before Finse, the 2.7 kilometer long &quot;Gråskallen&quot; tunnel at Haugastøl station is the first important improvement of the section. Immediately after the highest station Finse, the more than 10 kilometer long Finsetunnel was built, which replaced the original open route at over 1200 meters above sea level. At &quot;Høgheller&quot; junction, the new line merges back into the original road, which runs along the northern flank of the &quot;Moldåtal&quot; with numerous enclosures. After bridging the river and thus changing the traveled on side of the valley, the route passes by &quot;Seltuftvatnet&quot; and &quot;Reinungavatnet&quot; lakes. Behind that, Myrdal and Flåmsbana is reached.

With the following &quot;Gravhals&quot; tunnel, more than five kilometers long, the mountain massif to the catchment area of the Vosso is pierced: Now the railway line, built partly high on the northern flanks of the valleys, uses the merging upper valleys of the &quot;Uppsetf&quot;, the &quot;Kleielva&quot; and the &quot;Raundalselva&quot; westwards until lake Vangsvatnet in Voss is reached.

==== Voss mountains ====
From here, the Vosso valley corridor is used on its northern flank as far as Bulken station. At Bolstadøyri, where the Atlantic Ocean is reached by its branch Bolstadfjord, the route crosses over to the southern valley flank. With the more than eight kilometer long &quot;Trollkona&quot; Tunnel, opened in 1987, the route reaches lower Bergsdal and Dale (Vaksdal). &quot;Trollkona&quot; had become necessary due to the expansion of the European route E16 (main road connection between Oslo and Bergen) alongside the Bolstadfjord using partly the old railway line substructure. South of Dale, at Stanghelle, the Veafjord, which merges into the Sørfjord (Osterøy), is reached. On its south-east bank, the route to &quot;Herland&quot; passes by the Osterøy Bridge. Worth mentioning is the six kilometer long &quot;Hananipa&quot; tunnel between Vaksdal and Trengereid, which was put into operation in 1970 as line improvement. The 2.2 kilometer long &quot;Arnanipa&quot; tunnel is located behind &quot;Herland&quot;, immediately followed by the 7.6 kilometer long Ulriken Tunnel, by which the original, much longer, route via Nesttun could be shortened in 1964. Having reached the urban area of Bergen, the route follows a short part of the old line to the Bergen terminus.

=== Commuter rail ===

Vy Tog operates a commuter rail service from Bergen with two hourly departures to Arna, plus fourteen daily departures to Voss, of which up to six continue to Myrdal. The entire rolling stock is from 2019 consisting of Stadler FLIRT Electric multiple units after a process of which led to phasing out the old NSB Class 69. The first part to Arna represents an important part of the public transport in Bergen, since the rail direct line through the mountain Ulriken is considerably faster than driving over and around.

=== Express service ===
Express trains operated by NSB have always been the primary passenger service on Bergensbanen. Passenger trains follow the Drammen Line and the Asker Line to Drammen, before heading north to Hønefoss on the Randsfjord Line. The express trains offer both transport from villages along the line to either Bergen or Oslo, as well travel between Norway&#x27;s two largest cities. Expresses are locomotive-hauled trains with modernized coaches. Six nights a week there is a night train service. Several parts of the line service places without road access, such as Finse and Myrdal. Operating deficits are covered by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications.
In 2018 the fastest line used 6 hours and 32 minutes from Oslo to Bergen.

=== Freight ===
Freight trains are operated by CargoNet, hauled by El 14 and El 16 locomotives. Most transport is from the terminal at Alnabru in Oslo to the terminal at Bergen Station. Freight trains use the Roa-Hønefoss Line instead of going via Drammen since it is shorter—distance is more important than speed for freight trains. CargoNet operates up to four daily trains from Oslo, plus one from Drammen. Rail freight on (the ), the Bergen line, increased by 80% from 2001 to 2005, but further growth is not possible without better infrastructure. In 2006, CargoNet indicated they wanted five more passing loops, as well as lengthening them to increase freight train length from to , claiming they could double freight traffic with adequate infrastructure.

=== Heritage ===
Parts of the closed sections of Vossebanen, from Midttun to Garnes have been converted to a heritage railway—the Old Voss Line—that is operated with steam trains by the Norwegian Railway Club during the summer. At Finse there is a navvy museum, and the old navvy road has become a cycle track.

The branch Flåm Line has been converted to a tourist route. The railway has spectacular scenery and a vertical descent of or 5.5% along the route from Myrdal to Flåm. Passenger services are provided by Vy, but marketing is performed by Flåm Utvikling. The stock used on the railway are El 18 hauling NSB B3 wagons, the latter all painted green.

== Future propositions ==
=== A call for more investment in railways ===
In 2002 the Norwegian National Rail Administration warned that lack of funding might lead to a closure of all long-distance passenger trains in Norway, including the Bergen Line. Torild Skogsholm, Minister of Transport and Communications assured that it was not the government&#x27;s policy to close railway lines. In 2004 the Progress Party suggested closing down the railway line and replacing it with a motorway between Bergen and Oslo, arguing that the railway was unprofitable, and that bus transport was cheaper while easier truck transport would aid business. Other political parties rejected the proposal pointing out the better environmental performance of the railway and that the railway transports large volumes of freight.

=== Upgrades ===
The original plans for Bergensbanen from 1894 included the construction of a new line—the Ringerike Line—from Hønefoss to Sandvika just west of Oslo. This line would reduce the distance on Bergensbanen by and 50 minutes travel time. There has been a continual decision to build this railway line, but it has never received any funding. These plans were discussed more after 2000, and a detailed plan has been done. Combined with other improvements totaling investments of NOK 7 billion, travel time could be reduced to four and a half hours. The project is scheduled to be started in 2024, and finished around 2030, now at a cost of 36 billion NOK including 20 km motorway.

==== Arne-Stanghelle Joint Project ====

In January 2025, a contract was put out to tender for a project constructing a series of new rail and road tunnels near the western end of the line. Starting north-east of Bergen at Arna, the proposed route continues through a newly constructed station at Vaksdal, to finally rejoin the existing alignment at Stanghelle. The project would bypass the existing stretch of winding single-track rail skirting the South-Eastern shore of Veafjorden, with around of new double-track rail and parallel road tunnels. The new tunnel would support train speed up to 200 km/h, reducing travel time between Arna and Stanghelle stations from an average of 28 minutes to under 14 minutes. The Arne-Stanghelle Joint Project is funded by Bane NOR and the Norwegian Public Roads Administration as part of the 2025-2036 Norwegian National Transport Plan, and is projected to take 12 to 14 years to complete, with an initial forecast budget of 40 billion kroner.

=== High-speed rail ===

Several suggestions for high-speed rail from Oslo to Bergen have been launched. Preliminary studies performed for the National Rail Administration suggested a positive cost-benefit ratios on building high-speed rail from Oslo to Bergen. The most suitable route would approximately follow the existing route (but with a new tunnel Oslo–Hønefoss). Oslo–Trondheim and Oslo–Halden are assumed to be built earlier because of lower cost. Two lobbyist suggestions to the route have also been launched. The one involves a &quot;high-speed ring&quot; from Oslo, via Numedal to Geilo, then following Bergensbanen to Bergen and continuing south to Stavanger and back to Oslo via Kristiansand. Norsk Bane has launched the idea of building a common line from Oslo to Haukeli and then branching off to Bergen and Stavanger.

Such long-distance high-speed railways are not included in the preliminary long-term plan for 2010–2040, and it is likely that railways Hamar–Trondheim and Drammen–Kristansand will be built first since they are easier to build. It is likely that a high-speed railway to Bergen will be built sometime in the period 2030–2060.

<text>Albert James Myer (September 20, 1828 – August 24, 1880) was a surgeon and United States Army general. He is known as the father of the U.S. Army Signal Corps, as its first chief signal officer just prior to the American Civil War, the inventor of &quot;wig-wag&quot; signaling (or &quot;aerial telegraphy&quot;), and also as the father of the U.S. Weather Bureau.

==Early life==
Myer was born in Newburgh, New York, son of Henry Beekman Myer and Eleanor McClanahan Myer. The family moved to Western New York and after the death of his mother in 1834, he was raised primarily by his aunt in Buffalo.

Myer worked as a telegrapher before entering Geneva College (now Hobart College) in Geneva, New York, in 1842, at age 13, and from where he was graduated in 1847 as a member of The Kappa Alpha Society. He received his M.D. degree from Buffalo Medical College in 1851, while working part-time for the New York State Telegraph Company. His doctoral thesis, &quot;A New Sign Language for Deaf Mutes&quot;, showed concepts that he later used for his invention of aerial telegraphy.

He was ambitious and intellectually curious. It was said &quot;that he was specially noted for the manner in which he would take hold of an idea or principle, and, following it to its length and breadth, develop all there was in it or of it.&quot; He inherited a large fortune from his family.

He engaged in private medical practice in Florida and then sought a commission as a U.S. Army assistant surgeon (lieutenant), entering service September 18, 1854, posted at Fort Duncan, Texas, and Fort Davis, Jeff Davis County, Texas. His major interest of the time, besides medicine, was to devise a system of signaling across long distances, using simple codes and lightweight materials. This system of codes using a single signal flag (or a lantern or kerosene torch at night), known as &quot;wig-wag&quot; signaling or &quot;aerial telegraphy&quot;, would be adopted and used by both sides in the Civil War and afterward.

In 1858, the Army expressed interest in Myer&#x27;s invention and appointed a board to examine &quot;the principles and plans of the signalling, mode of use in the field, and course to be pursued in introducing to the army.&quot; Myer appeared before the board, chaired by Lt. Col. Robert E. Lee, in 1859 and convinced them to authorize field testing of his invention. He conducted field tests starting in April of that year around New York Harbor. The tests were successful and Secretary of War John B. Floyd recommended to Congress that the Army adopt Myer&#x27;s system and that Myer be appointed as chief signal officer. Congress approved Myer&#x27;s appointment as major and chief signal officer and the Signal Corps was formed, despite opposition in the Senate by Jefferson Davis from Mississippi. Myer was sent to the Department of New Mexico for further field trials of his system in a campaign against the Navajos.

On August 24, 1857, he married Catherine Walden, daughter of a prominent Buffalo attorney, with whom he would have six children.

==Signal Corps and the Civil War==

The June 21, 1860, letter from the War Department that ordered Myer to organize and command the new U.S. Army Signal Corps provided little of substance. It authorized $2000 for equipment and a promotion for Myer to major, effective June 27. Myer was faced with the responsibility of recruiting subordinates who could be detailed from elsewhere in the Army. The Signal Corps would not commence as an official Army organization until March 3, 1863, at which time Myer was promoted to colonel. Between these two dates, Myer served first under Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler at Fort Monroe, Virginia, where he established a camp of instruction, and then as the chief signal officer for Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan&#x27;s Army of the Potomac in its campaigns from the Peninsula Campaign to the Battle of Antietam. During this period Myer was awarded a brevet promotion to lieutenant colonel in the regular army for his actions at Hanover Court House, and to brevet colonel for Malvern Hill.

Ironically, the first use in combat of Myer&#x27;s signaling system was by Confederate Captain Edward Porter Alexander at the First Battle of Bull Run. Alexander had been a subordinate of Myer&#x27;s and assisted in the New York field trials.

In addition to his aerial signaling, Myer recognized the need for electrical telegraphy in field communications. He introduced a field telegraph train of wagons to support a device called the Beardslee telegraph, which used a dial instead of a key tapping Morse code, developed to require less training for its operators.

Myer&#x27;s Signal Corps was actually a separate entity from the Military Telegraph Service, a War Department bureau staffed primarily by civilian telegraph operators. He had numerous organizational disputes with the assistant secretary of war for this function, attempting on several occasions to take control of all telegraphic operations. When he proposed to remove the less than dependable Beardslee device and recruit trained telegraphers into the Signal Corps, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton removed him from his post as chief signal officer on November 15, 1863, and reassigned him out of Washington, D.C., effectively exiling him.

While conducting routine reconnaissance of the Mississippi River from Cairo, Illinois, to Memphis, Tennessee, Myer wrote the &quot;Manual of Signals for the United States Army and Navy&quot;. In June 1864, he was appointed by Maj. Gen. E.R.S. Canby to be the signal officer of the Military Division of West Mississippi. Under Canby, Myer added a new duty to the tasks of the Signal Corps by working out a system for interrogating deserters and refugees who came into the Union lines. He also developed a coding system for transmitting routine messages between land and sea forces. He organized communications plans for the operations in the Mobile area and participated, with U.S. Navy officers, in the surrender of Fort Gaines. He served as signal officer for the Department of the Gulf from August 1864 to 1865.

While he was preparing for the Mobile campaign, Myer received the disturbing news that his appointment as colonel and chief signal officer, which had been made before his dismissal in 1863, had not been confirmed by the Senate and was revoked, thus returning him to his permanent rank of major. Through early 1865, Myer employed lawyers and political connections to attempt to correct what he perceived as an injustice. On July 28, 1866, reacting to the influence of Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant and President Andrew Johnson, Congress reorganized the Signal Corps and, with the permanent rank of colonel, Myer again became chief signal officer. He was particularly gratified when word of this victory came on October 30, 1866, as his old nemesis, Edwin Stanton, had to inform him of his reinstatement. He was not confirmed in the position until February 1867 and was not ordered to active duty until August 1867. His new duties included control of the telegraph service, resolving the dispute that had removed him from his position.

On December 3, 1867, President Andrew Johnson nominated Myer for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general in the Regular Army (United States), to rank from March 13, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on February 14, 1868. Myer received the brevet grade in honor of his formation of the Signal Corps. His commission as brigadier general in the regular Army came on June 16, 1880, two months before his death. As an Army officer, Myer was nicknamed &quot;Old Probabilities&quot; by his subordinates.

==Postbellum career==

The U.S. Congress, on February 9, 1870, authorized &quot;... meteorological observations at the military stations in the interior of the continent and at other points in the states and territories of the United States, and for giving notice on the northern lakes and seaboard by telegraph and signals of the approach and force of storms&quot;. This duty, previously conducted by the Smithsonian Institution, was assigned to General Myer&#x27;s Signal Corps, due in part to his previous interests in storm telegraphy. It was the birth of the U.S. Weather Bureau, now the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In 1873 at the International Meteorological Congress of Vienna, he proposed a resolution for the establishment throughout the world of weather stations and daily exchange of simultaneous weather observations, the effective beginning of the World Meteorological Organization.

Myer was instrumental in the development of heliography in the U.S. Army. In 1877, he acquired heliograph instruments from the British Army for experimental purposes and sent them on to General Nelson A. Miles, at the Yellowstone Department in Montana. Miles developed expertise with the heliograph, which he used to great purpose in the Arizona Apache campaigns.

Myer headed the Signal Corps from August 21, 1867, until his death of nephritis at Buffalo, New York, in 1880. He is interred in the Walden-Myer Mausoleum at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Buffalo.

==Legacy==

Myer is honored by several entities: Fort Whipple, Virginia, was renamed Fort Myer in 1881; U.S. Army cable ship &quot;Albert J. Myer&quot; built in 1945 serving Army Signal Corps 1952–1966 then U.S. Navy service 1966–1994; the Albert J. Myer Center, the Signal Headquarters building of the U.S. Army Communication Electronics Command (CECOM) at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey; and the General Albert J. Myer Forecast Facility at the Buffalo Niagara International Airport. Hobart College awarded Myer an honorary LL.D. degree in 1872 and Union College conferred an honorary Ph.D. on him in 1875.

<text>Friedrich Myconius (originally named Friedrich Mekum and also Friedrich Mykonius) (26 December 1490 – 7 April 1546) was a German Lutheran theologian and Protestant reformer. He was a colleague of Martin Luther.

Myconius was born in Lichtenfels, Bavaria, and he was educated there and at Annaberg, where he had an encounter with Johann Tetzel, a Dominican, in a disagreement over indulgences. His teacher, named Staffelstein, persuaded him in 1510 to enter the Franciscan order. That same night a dream turned his thoughts towards the religious standpoint which he subsequently reached as a Lutheran. From Annaberg he passed to Franciscan communities at Leipzig and Weimar, where he was ordained priest in 1516. He had endeavoured to satisfy his mind with scholastic divinity, but next year his &quot;eyes and ears were opened&quot; by the theses of Luther, whom he met when Luther stopped at Weimar on his way to Augsburg.

As he became a friend and co-worker of Luther, he preached Luther&#x27;s message to the people of Leipzig and Gotha, where he founded the Gotha Gymnasium. He was intimately connected with the general progress of the reforming movement, and was especially in the confidence of Luther. Twice he was entrusted with the ordering of the churches and schools in Thuringia. He took a leading part in all the religious disputations and conferences of the time, and at the 1537 Convention of Smalkald he signed the articles on his own behalf and that of his friend Justus Menius.

In 1538, Myconius was sent to England to discuss the details of the Augsburg Confession, as theologian to the embassy which hoped to induce
Henry VIII to make common cause with the Lutheran reformation. Later, he wrote a history of the reformation.

In 1540 Myconius became sick and was expected to die within a short time. On his bed he wrote a loving farewell note to Luther with a trembling hand. Luther received the letter and sent back a reply: &quot;I command thee in the name of God to live because I still have need of thee in the work of reforming the church... The Lord will never let me hear that thou art dead, but will permit thee to survive me. For this I am praying, this is my will, and may my will be done, because I seek only to glorify the name of God.&quot; Although Myconius had already lost the ability to speak when Luther&#x27;s letter came, he recovered completely and lived six more years to survive Luther himself by two months. He had nine children, four of whom were living in 1542.

<text>Parabens are chemical compounds that are commonly used as preservatives in cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. Chemically, they are a series of parahydroxybenzoates or esters of parahydroxybenzoic acid (also known as 4-hydroxybenzoic acid). Research is being conducted to evaluate the potential health implications of paraben usage.

==Chemistry==

=== Structure ===
Parabens are esters of &quot;para&quot;-hydroxy&quot;ben&quot;zoic acid, from which the name is derived. Common parabens include methylparaben (E number E218), ethylparaben (E214), propylparaben (E216), butylparaben and heptylparaben (E209). Less common parabens include isobutylparaben, isopropylparaben, benzylparaben and their sodium salts. The general chemical structure of a paraben is shown at the top right of this page, where R symbolizes an alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl.

=== Synthesis ===
All commercially used parabens are synthetically produced, although some are identical to those found in nature. They are produced by the esterification of &quot;para&quot;-hydroxybenzoic acid with the appropriate alcohol, such as methanol, ethanol, or n-propanol. &quot;para&quot;-Hydroxybenzoic acid is in turn produced industrially from a modification of the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction, using potassium phenoxide and carbon dioxide.

=== Biological mode of action ===
Parabens are active against a broad spectrum of microorganisms. However, their antibacterial mode of action is not well understood. They are thought to act by disrupting membrane transport processes or by inhibiting synthesis of DNA and RNA or of some key enzymes, such as ATPases and phosphotransferases, in some bacterial species. Propylparaben is considered more active against more bacteria than methylparaben. The stronger antibacterial action of propylparaben may be due to its greater solubility in the bacterial membrane, which may allow it to reach cytoplasmic targets in greater concentrations. However, since a majority of the studies on the mechanism of action of parabens suggest that their antibacterial action is linked to the membrane, it is possible that its greater lipid solubility disrupts the lipid bilayer, thereby interfering with bacterial membrane transport processes and perhaps causing the leakage of intracellular constituents.

==Applications==

=== General uses ===
Parabens are effective preservatives in many types of formulas. These compounds, and their salts, are used primarily for their bactericidal and fungicidal properties. They are found in shampoos, commercial moisturizers, shaving gels, personal lubricants, topical/parenteral pharmaceuticals, sun-tan products, makeup, and toothpaste. They are also used as food preservatives. Parabens are additionally found in pharmaceutical products such as topical treatments for wounds. These treatments help heal wounds by keeping the skin moist and preventing infection. The antimicrobial properties of parabens play a role in the effectiveness of the treatment. This application is helpful for those who have chronic wounds and need to prevent infections as much as possible.

== Health considerations ==
Most of the available paraben toxicity data are from single-exposure studies, meaning one type of paraben in one type of product. According to paraben research this is relatively safe, posing only a negligible risk to the endocrine system. However, since many types of parabens in many types of products are used commonly, further assessment of the additive and cumulative risk of multiple paraben exposure from daily use of multiple cosmetic and/or personal care products is needed. FDA states that they have no information that use of parabens in cosmetics has any effect on health. They continue to consider certain questions and evaluate data about parabens&#x27; possible health effects.

===Allergic reactions===
Parabens are, for the most part, non-irritating and non-sensitizing. Among people with contact dermatitis or eczema, less than 3% of patients were found to have a sensitivity to parabens.

===Estrogenic activity=== 
Studies in rats have indicated that parabens may mimic the hormone estrogen, raising concerns over possible contributions to breast cancer. However, according to Cancer Research UK, there is no reliable evidence that parabens cause breast cancer in humans.

The estrogenic activity of parabens increases with the length of the alkyl group. It is believed that propylparaben is estrogenic to a certain degree as well, though this is expected to be less than butylparaben by virtue of its less lipophilic nature. Since it can be concluded that the estrogenic activity of butylparaben is negligible under normal use, the same should be concluded for shorter analogs due to estrogenic activity of parabens increasing with the length of the alkyl group. 

==Controversy==
Concerns about endocrine disruptors have led consumers and companies to search for paraben-free alternatives. A common alternative has been phenoxyethanol, but this has its own risks and has led to an FDA warning on inclusion in nipple creams.

===Regulation===
The European Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) reiterated in 2013 that methylparaben and ethylparaben are safe at the maximum authorized concentrations (up to 0.4% for one ester or 0.8% when used in combination). The SCCS concluded that the use of butylparaben and propylparaben as preservatives in finished cosmetic products is safe to the consumer, as long as the sum of their individual concentrations does not exceed 0.19%. Isopropylparaben, isobutylparaben, phenylparaben, benzylparaben and pentylparaben were banned by European Commission Regulation (EU) No 358/2014.

==Environmental considerations==
===Release into the environment===

Paraben discharge into the environment is common due to its ubiquitous use in cosmetic products. A 2010 study on consumer available personal care products revealed that 44% of the tested products contain parabens. When washing these products off the human body, they flow down the drain and into community wastewater. Once this occurs, the potential for parabens to accumulate within aqueous and solid mediums materializes. Some of the most common paraben derivatives found in the environment include methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben. Parabens flow in wastewater to wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) as influent, where they are either removed, chemically altered, or released into the environment through sludge or tertiary effluent.
In one New York wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), mass load of all parent paraben derivatives (methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben, etc.) from influent wastewater was found to be 176 mg/day/1000 people. When this value is used to estimate the amount of parabens entering WWTPs from the 8.5 million people currently residing in New York City for an entire year, a value of approximately of parabens is calculated. Therefore, levels of paraben accumulation prove significant upon long-term observance. WWTPs eliminate between 92–98% of paraben derivatives; however, much of this removal is due to the formation of degradation products. Despite their reputed high elimination through WWTPs, various studies have measured high levels of paraben derivatives and degradation products persisting in the environment.

===Formation of degradation products===
====Chlorinated products====


In addition to parent parabens, paraben degradation products that form throughout WWTP stages present a concern to the environment, including mono- and di- chlorinated parabens. When paraben-containing products are washed down the drain, parabens have the potential to undergo chlorination reactions. This reaction can occur with free chlorine present in tap water or with sodium hypochlorite, which is often used in WWTPs as a final disinfectant step. In neutral water, Raman spectroscopy has confirmed that chlorine is predominantly present as hypochlorous acid (HClO). Parabens can react with HClO to form mono- and di- chlorinated products through electrophilic aromatic substitution. The electrophilic attack of the chlorine forms a carbocation that is stabilized by donated electron density from the hydroxyl group of the paraben. This step is endergonic due to the loss of aromaticity, though the hydroxyl group acts as an activating group that increases the rate. A base can then abstract a proton from the carbon containing the chlorine, which is followed by subsequent restoration of aromaticity by the involved pi electrons. Since the hydroxyl group is more activating than the ester group of the paraben, the reaction will direct in both ortho positions, as the para position is already blocked.

The Arrhenius equation was used in a study to calculate activation energies for the chlorination of four parent parabens (methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, and butylparaben) and was found to range from 36–47kJ/mol. In another study, tap water at containing 50–200μM free chlorine was spiked with 0.5μM propylparaben and the composition of the mixture was monitored over 40 minutes to determine if chlorination occurs under conditions found in tap water. Results from the study confirm the disappearance of propylparaben after 5 minutes, the appearance of both 3-chloro-propylparaben and 3,5-dichloro-propylparaben paraben by 5 minutes, and the persistence of 3,5-dichloro-propylparaben as the main species remaining in the reaction. A similar, though more rapid, trend was found in a study in which the reaction temperature was increased to .

====4-Hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA)====
Another significant paraben degradation product is 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA). There are two mechanisms in which parabens can degrade to PHBA. The first degradation route occurs chemically. Parent parabens readily undergo base-catalyzed hydrolysis of the ester bond, forming PHBA. The reaction occurs under moderately alkaline conditions, specifically when the pH is ≥ 8. This reaction is quite prevalent in household environments due to the pH range of household wastewater being 6–9 and the prevalent existence of parabens in cosmetic products. When paraben-containing cosmetic products are discharged into community wastewater influent, they become exposed to an environment where the pH ≥ 8, and the base-catalyzed hydrolysis of the parent paraben ensues, forming PHBA.

In the electron transfer mechanism, the pi electrons in the double bond between the oxygen and carbonyl carbon resonate to the oxygen, leaving a negative charge on the oxygen and a positive charge on the carbonyl carbon. A hydroxide ion, acting as a nucleophile, attacks the now electrophilic carbonyl carbon, yielding sp3 hybridization on the carbonyl carbon. The electrons resonate back to form the double bond between the oxygen and the carbonyl carbon. In order to retain the original sp2 hybridization, the –OR group will leave. The –OR group acts as a better leaving group than the –OH group due to its ability to maintain a negative charge with greater stability. Lastly, the –OR-, acting as a base, will deprotonate the carboxylic acid to form a carboxylate anion. 
The second way in which parabens can degrade into PHBA occurs biologically within WWTPs. During the secondary clarifier phase of Wastewater treatment, sludge accumulates at the bottom of the secondary clarifier. Upon separation of the liquid and solid phases of the incoming influent, parabens have a greater tendency accumulate in the sludge. This is due to its moderate hydrophobicity, as quantified by a log Kow value of approximately 1.58. This sludge is concentrated in organic nutrients; consequently, a proliferation of microorganisms becomes common within the sludge. One organism is &quot;Enterobacter cloacae&quot;, which biologically metabolizes the sludge parabens into PHBA.

===Accumulation of degradation products in the environment===

Through various analytical techniques such as gas chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography, the exact levels of accumulation of paraben derivatives and degradation products in the environment have been quantified. These levels have been accurately measured in tertiary effluent and sewage sludge, as these are the primary avenues for which parabens and their degradation products reach the environment upon discharge from WWTPs.
Paraben stability in sewage sludge is relatively high due to their ability to bind with organic matter. Soil adsorption coefficient values were calculated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as 1.94 (methylparaben), 2.20 (ethylparaben), 2.46 (propylparaben), and 2.72 (butylparaben), all of which suggest that parabens have the ability to adhere to the organic portion of sediment and sludge, and thus, persist environmentally.

Chlorinated parabens are removed from WWTPs with only 40% efficiency in comparison to 92–98% efficiency of parent parabens. The decrease in removal efficiency can be attributed to the decreased biodegradability of chlorinated parabens, their increased overall stability throughout WWTPs, and their relatively low sorption to the sludge phase due to low log Kow values.

Higher levels of PHBA are found in tertiary effluent in comparison to paraben derivatives, and PHBA exists in the highest concentration in sewage sludge. There are two reasons for these levels of accumulation. The first reason is PHBA&#x27;s tendency to sorb to solid particles, which can be approximated by benzoic acid&#x27;s high Kd value of approximately 19. The pKa of PHBA is 2.7, but it is in an environment of a pH between 6–9. Since the pKa is less than the pH, the carboxylic acid will be deprotonated. The carboxylate allows it to act as a sorbent on solid environmental matrices, thus promoting its aggregation in tertiary effluent, but especially sewage sludge, which acts as the solid matrix itself. The second reason is due to the intermediate increase in levels of PHBA during the secondary clarifier phase of the WWTP through biological processes.

===Environmental concerns with paraben degradation products===
Multiple studies have linked chlorinated parabens to endocrine disrupting functions, specifically mimicking the effects of estrogen, and chlorinated parabens are believed to be 3–4 times more toxic than their parent paraben. In &quot;Daphnia magna&quot;, general toxicity conferred by chlorinated parabens occurs through non-specific disruption of cell membrane function. The potency of the chlorinated parabens correlates with the propensity of the compound to accumulate in cell membranes. Thus, chlorinated parabens generally increase in toxicity as their ester chains increase in length due to their increased hydrophobicity.

The implications of PHBA&#x27;s environmental accumulation also warrants attention. If the tertiary effluent is re-used for community use as greywater, it poses a hazard to humans. These hazards include, but are not limited to, abnormal fetal development, endocrine disrupting activity, and improper estrogen-promoting effects. If the tertiary effluent is released to the environment in rivers and streams or if the sludge is used as fertilizer, it poses as a hazard to environmental organisms. It is especially toxic to those organisms on lower trophic levels, particularly various algal species. In fact, it has been shown that the LC for a specific algal species, &quot;Selenastrum capricornutum&quot;, is 0.032 micrograms per litre (μg/L). This is less than the natural abundance of PHBA in tertiary effluent at a level of 0.045μg/L, thus indicating that current levels of PHBA in tertiary effluent can potentially eradicate more than 50% of &quot;Selenastrum capricornutum&quot; it comes in contact with.

===Removal of parabens through ozonation=== 

Ozonation is an advanced treatment technique that has been considered as a possible method to limit the amount of parabens, chlorinated parabens, and PHBA that are accumulating in the environment. Ozone is an extremely powerful oxidant that oxidizes parabens and makes them easier to remove once subsequently passed through a filter. Due to the electrophilic nature of ozone, it can easily react with the aromatic paraben ring to form hydroxylated products. Ozonation is generally regarded as a less dangerous method of disinfection than chlorination, though ozonation requires more cost considerations. Ozonation has demonstrated great efficacy in the removal of parabens (98.8–100%) and a slightly lower efficacy of 92.4% for PHBA. A moderately lower rate of removal, however, is observed for chlorinated parabens (59.2–82.8%). A proposed reaction mechanism for the removal of parabens by ozonation is detailed mechanistically.

<doc id="917175" wikidata="Q1172965" url="?curid=917175" title="Flip book">
<text>A flip book, flipbook, flicker book, or kineograph is a booklet with a series of images that very gradually change from one page to the next, so that when the pages are viewed in quick succession, the images appear to animate by simulating motion or some other change. Often, flip books are illustrated books for children, but may also be geared toward adults and employ a series of photographs rather than drawings. Flip books are not always separate books, but may appear as an added feature in ordinary books or magazines, frequently using the page corners. Software packages and websites are also available that convert digital video files into custom-made flip books.

== Functionality ==
Rather than &quot;reading&quot; left to right, a viewer simply stares at the same location of the images in the flip book as the pages turn. The booklet must be flipped through with enough speed for the illusion to work, so the standard way to &quot;read&quot; a flip book is to hold the booklet with one hand and flip through its pages with the thumb of the other hand. The German word for flip book—&quot;Daumenkino&quot;, which translates to &quot;thumb cinema&quot;—reflects this process, the photographic progression integral to film.

== History ==

There are some medieval illuminated books with sequential images, such as &quot;Sigenot&quot; (circa 1470). The illustrations in &quot;Sigenot&quot; are consistently framed and have short intervals between different phases of action, but the images cannot produce the illusion of a fluent motion. The necessary notion of instances smaller than a second would not really develop before the nineteenth century.

The oldest known documentation of the flip book appeared on 18 March 1868, when it was patented by John Barnes Linnett under the name &quot;Kineograph&quot; (&quot;moving picture&quot;). They were the first form of animation to employ a linear sequence of images rather than circular (as in the older phenakistoscope). The German film pioneer, Max Skladanowsky, first exhibited his serial photographic images in flip book form in 1894, as he and his brother Emil did not develop their own film projector until the following year. In 1894, Herman Casler invented a mechanized form of flip book called the Mutoscope, which mounted the pages on a central rotating cylinder rather than binding them in a book. The mutoscope remained a popular attraction through the mid-twentieth century, appearing as coin-operated machines in penny arcades and amusement parks. In 1897, the English filmmaker Henry William Short marketed his &quot;Filoscope&quot;, which was a flip book placed in a metal holder to facilitate flipping.

By 1948, an &quot;automated multiple camera&quot; for the production of &quot;Pocket Movie flip book&quot; portraits was marketed in the United States.

== In culture ==
A type of flip book figures prominently in the rise in fortunes of the fictional artist Tateh in &quot;Ragtime&quot; written by E. L. Doctorow and published in 1975 later included in the film and musical adaptations of the book.

The first international flip book festival was held in 2004, by the Akademie Schloss Solitude in Stuttgart. Another international flip book festival was held in Linz, Austria in 2005.

Since 2007, Walt Disney Animation Studios has started its films with a production logo that initially evokes a flip book. It starts with a view of an empty page of paper, then as the pages start to turn, details are drawn in to reveal Mickey Mouse in &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;.

In 2010, Hungary postal services released a flip book of stamps depicting a moving gömböc. The Israel Philatelic Federation released an &quot;Israeli Animation Stamp Booklet&quot; in November 2010 with 15 stamps designed by Mish to be animated when flipping the pages. It commemorated the 50th anniversary of ASIFA, the 25th anniversary of ASIFA Israel, and the &quot;Flip Book 250th Anniversary&quot;.

<doc id="917178" wikidata="Q271405" url="?curid=917178" title="Claudia Muzio">
<text>Claudia Muzio (7 February 1889 – 24 May 1936) was an Italian operatic lyric soprano who enjoyed an international career during the early 20th century.

==Early years==
Claudina Emilia Maria Muzzio was born in Pavia, the daughter of Carlo Muzio, an operatic stage manager, whose engagements during her childhood took the family to opera houses around Italy as well as to Covent Garden in London and to the Metropolitan Opera in New York. Her mother was a choir singer, Giovanna Gavirati.

Muzio arrived in London at the age of 2 and went to school there, becoming fluent in English, before returning to Italy at the age of 16 to study in Turin with Annetta Casaloni, a piano teacher and former operatic mezzo-soprano who had created the role of Maddalena in the world première of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Rigoletto&quot;. Muzio then continued her vocal studies in Milan with Elettra Callery-Viviani. She also took the stage name of Claudia Muzio.

==Career==
Muzio made her operatic début in Arezzo (15 January 1910) in the title role of Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Manon&quot;, and made progress in the opera houses of Italy, leading to débuts at La Scala in Milan in 1913 (as Desdemona in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot;), in Paris (as Desdemona) and in London at Covent Garden (as Puccini&#x27;s Manon Lescaut) in 1914. She stayed on in London to sing other roles including Mimì and &quot;Tosca&quot; (both with Caruso). She was invited to the Met in New York in December 1916 (for &quot;Tosca&quot;) and was so successful that she continued to appear there during six successive years. It was at the Metropolitan that Muzio created the role of Giorgetta in &quot;Il tabarro&quot;, in the world première of Puccini&#x27;s triple bill, &quot;Il trittico&quot;, on 14 December 1918.

She established a special relationship with audiences at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires, where she first appeared in June 1919 (in Catalani&#x27;s &quot;Loreley&quot;). From then until 1934 she sang there in 23 different operas, becoming known as &quot;la divina Claudia&quot;. Between 1922 and 1932, she appeared regularly in Chicago (after falling out with the management at the New York Met).

On 15 October 1932, she performed the title role of &quot;Tosca&quot; to inaugurate the new War Memorial Opera House in San Francisco. Other notable roles in her career included the title role in &quot;Aida&quot;, Santuzza in &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;, Maddalena in &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot;, and Leonora in &quot;Il trovatore&quot; (all in New York), and also Violetta in &quot;La traviata&quot; and Leonora in &quot;La forza del destino&quot; (in Chicago and Buenos Aires). Her last and according to some critics her greatest role was in Rome in 1934 as Cecilia in the opera of that name written for her by Licinio Refice. Her most popular role, however, was Violetta, in which she was considered unsurpassed throughout the Latin opera world (Italy, Spain, South America).

Muzio was noted for the beauty and warmth of her voice, with a richness of tonal colouring. Her performances were sometimes criticised for excessive use of dynamic extremes. Critics called her pianissimo singing &quot;particularly admirable.&quot; She remained modest and even reclusive despite her increasing fame and wealth.

==Last years==
In her later years, Muzio experienced some financial anxiety after losing money through the extravagance of her manager and rumoured lover, and then in the stock market crash of 1929. Muzio married Renato Liberati, seventeen years her junior in 1929. The following year she began experiencing some health problems, but continued to sing and record. On May 24, 1936, after a short illness, she died in a hotel in Rome of what was officially described as heart failure, at the age of 47. She is buried in the Cimitero del Verano in Rome. Her goddaughter was the soprano Claudia Pinza Bozzolla, daughter of Italian bass Ezio Pinza.

==Recordings==

Muzio is represented by recordings from various stages of her career, but few of them are from the period of her greatest successes in the late 1920s and early 1930s. She also recorded primarily for two companies whose distribution was limited and erratic: Pathé and Edison. Muzio&#x27;s Pathé discs are of mixed quality due to Pathé&#x27;s problematic recording process – artists recorded to cylinder masters which were then pantographically transferred to disc masters for making stampers, and frequency range loss and distortion often occurred during the cylinder-to-disc processing. Her Edison recordings, however, represent not only some of the best operatic recordings released by that company, but also Muzio&#x27;s power and ability to project her personal intensity through the difficult acoustic recording process. She was aided at Edison by chief recordist Walter Miller and staff conductor Cesare Sodero.

*1911. La voce del padrone. Muzio recorded two arias, including &quot;Mi chiamano Mimì&quot; from &quot;La bohème&quot;, when she was only 22 and her voice and technique were still relatively immature. [Included on CD transfer Romophone 81005-2.]
*1917–1918. Pathé. 43 titles recorded. [Transferred to CD on Romophone 81010-2.]
*1920–1925. Edison. 37 titles recorded. [Transferred to CD by Pearl, GEMM CDS 9072, and also on Romophone 81005-2.]
*1932. In October, Muzio appeared in the opening production of &quot;Tosca&quot; at the San Francisco War Memorial Opera House; the opening night was recorded for radio, and act 1 has been issued on CD. [Available on Minerva MN-A76, as part of a collection of Muzio&#x27;s Puccini performances.]
*1934–1935. Columbia. Muzio personally produced and financed a set of 26 recordings for Columbia in 1934 and 1935. By 1935, there is some noticeable weakening of the top of her voice but her expressive powers are well-displayed, especially in &quot;Addio del passato&quot; from Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La traviata&quot;. They are the recordings by which she has been best remembered. [Transferred to CD on Romophone 81015; 19 titles, along with her 1911 &quot;La bohème&quot; track, are also on Nimbus NI 7814.]

<doc id="917180" wikidata="Q204657" url="?curid=917180" title="Santa María (volcano)">
<text>Santa María Volcano is a large active volcano in the western highlands of Guatemala, in the Quetzaltenango Department near the city of Quetzaltenango. It is part of the mountain range of the Sierra Madre.

The volcano was known as Gagxanul in the local Kʼicheʼ language, which means &quot;Naked Volcano or Mountain&quot;, before the 16th century Spanish conquest of the region.

The VEI-6 eruption of Santa María Volcano in 1902 was one of the three largest eruptions of the 20th century, after the 1912 Novarupta and 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruptions. It is also one of the five biggest eruptions of the past 200 (and most likely 300) years.

==Geological history==
Santa María Volcano is part of the Sierra Madre range of volcanoes, which extends along the western edge of Guatemala, separated from the Pacific Ocean by a broad plain. The volcanoes are formed by the subduction of the Cocos Plate under the Caribbean Plate, which led to the formation of the Central America Volcanic Arc.

Eruptions at Santa María are estimated to have begun about 103 ka. Construction of the volcanic edifice occurred in four phases, from 103–72, 72, 60–46, and 35–25 ka, building up the large cone that reaches about above the plain on which the nearby city of Quetzaltenango sits. Following the cone-building eruptions, activity seems to have changed to a pattern of long periods of repose followed by the emission of small lava flows from vents on the mountain.

==1902 eruption==

The first eruption of Santa María in recorded history occurred in October 1902. Before 1902 the volcano had been dormant for at least 500 years and possibly several thousand years, but its awakening was clearly indicated by a seismic swarm in the region starting in January 1902, which included a major earthquake in April 1902. The eruption began on 24 October, and the largest explosions occurred over the following two days, ejecting an estimated of magma. The eruption was one of the largest of the 20th century, only slightly less in magnitude to that of Mount Pinatubo in 1991. The eruption had a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 6, thus being &#x27;Colossal&#x27;.

The pumice formed in the climactic eruption fell over an area of about , and volcanic ash as far away as San Francisco, California, away. The eruption occurred out of a vent on the southwest side of the volcano, leaving a crater about in diameter and about deep, stretching from just below the summit to an elevation of about . The first evidence of the eruption was a sprinkling of sand on Quezaltenango. The wind then changed from the south to the east and ashes began to fall at Helvetia, a coffee plantation southwest. Many coffee plantations were destroyed.

Because of the lack of recorded eruptive activity at Santa María, local people did not recognise the preceding seismicity as warning signs of an eruption. Estimates are that 6,000 people died as a result of the eruption. They were burned or suffocated.

Due to the eruption, in an area for up to 160km from the volcano, there was total darkness for 53 hours. After the eruption, the area was also affected by gangs who went to the affected areas to steal from people, murder and plunder plantations.

For the native people the eruption consequences were catastrophic: they not only lost relatives, friends, homes and harvest, but they were also enslaved in the recovery while &quot;criollo&quot; landlords were compensated for the loss with lands that were confiscated from native communities in San Miguel Uspantán Quiché Department, Panam in Suchitepéquez Department and in Sololá Department.

===1902 eruption sequence of events===
* 24 October: 5:00 pm: At San Felipe a sound was heard, similar to the roar of a waterfall, for five minutes, coming from the volcano; but the mist surrounding the volcano did not allow any direct observation of what was happening.
* 24 October: 6:00 pm: Cinders and ashes started falling over Quetzaltenango
* 24 October: 7:00 pm: Witnesses recall seeing lightning and a strong fiery red light coming from the volcano, and noise similar of that of an industrial furnace.
* 24 October: 8:00 pm: From San Felipe one could see a giant plume of black ash with numerous whirlwinds crossed by thousands of lightning bolts and curved lines of red light. All the area surrounding the volcano kept shaking and large explosions could be heard as far as away; strong winds carried ash and debris as far as away, or even more; a part of the cloud hovered on the north side of the cone for days, and a pitch black darkness ensued. 
* 25 October: 1:00 am: The eruption became more violent and large rocks from the volcano started falling as far as away, destroying towns and farm houses.
* 26 October: 12:00 am: The volcano calmed down.
* 26 October: 3:00 pm: Another eruption, but this time it was a white plume that came out, which was likely composed of water vapor.

==Santiaguito==
The 1902 eruption was followed by 20 years of dormancy. New eruptions began in 1922, with the extrusion of a lava dome complex in the crater left by the 1902 eruption. The lava dome complex, named Santiaguito, is still active today with over 1 km3 of lava erupted so far. The lava dome complex has four main domes: El Caliente, La Mitad, El Monje and El Brujo. The currently active vent is El Caliente.

The dome growth has been both &quot;endogenous&quot; and &quot;exogenous&quot;. The former implies dome interior expansion to accommodate new lava and the latter refers to superficial piling up of lava. Activity has been concentrated at several different vents, and Santiaguito now has the appearance of several overlapping domes. At the beginning of dome growth the composition was dacite, identical to the composition of the Santa Maria eruption. By 1990 the composition had shifted to a less evolved andesite. It has been proposed that this is due to a stratified magma chamber beneath the volcano.

The early (pre-1990) exogenous volcanism has consisted of lava spines and lava flows. Nowadays, only lava flows are erupted. All the volcanic activity is cyclic with 10+ year cyclic timescales between periods of high volcanism with high extrusion rates and low volcanism with low extrusion rates. The latest with high extrusion rate was in 2011–2015 with the emplacement of more than four new lava flows. Frequent small eruptions and pyroclastic flows have been ongoing throughout dome growth.

Although most of Santiaguito&#x27;s eruptive activity has been relatively gentle, occasional larger explosions have occurred. In 1929 part of the dome collapsed, generating pyroclastic flows which killed anywhere from several hundred up to 5,000 people. Occasional rockfalls have generated smaller pyroclastic flows, and vertical eruptions of ash to heights of a few kilometres above the dome are common. Santiaguito is now a tourist attraction, as minor eruptions occur with regularity and can be observed by visitors from the summit of Santa Maria.

==Volcanic hazards at Santa María==

The areas to the south of Santa María are considerably affected by volcanic activity at Santiaguito. Currently, the most common volcanic hazards at Santa María are lahars, which frequently occur in the rainy season due to heavy rainfall on loose volcanic deposits. Lahars are particularly large and frequent during periods of high volcanism at Santiaguito. The town of El Palmar, from Santiaguito, has been destroyed twice by lahars from Santiaguito forcing the town to be moved to the present Nuevo El Palmar, and infrastructure such as roads and bridges have been repeatedly damaged. Lahar deposits from Santiaguito have affected rivers all the way downstream to the Pacific Ocean.

Near constant lava flows occur from Santiaguito, and can reach up to 4 km from the vent. Lava flow activity occurs in cycles, with the longest lava flows occurring during times of high volcanic activity. Much shorter lava flows occur during the longer periods of low volcanic activity. These lava flows flow only a short distance from the vent before collapsing. The magma at Santiaguito is rich in silica and is thus highly viscous. The lava flows are slow moving and mostly cause property damage, although in the past catastrophic pyroclastic flows have been triggered from lava flows, which have extended several kilometers towards the west.

One hazard which could be devastating is the collapse of Santa María itself. The 1902 crater has left the southern flank of the mountain above Santiaguito highly over-steepened, and a large earthquake or eruption from Santiaguito could trigger a huge landslide, which might cover up to . However, this is thought to be unlikely in the short term.

In light of the threat it poses to nearby populations, Santa María has been designated a Decade Volcano, identifying it as a target for particular study by volcanologists to mitigate any future natural disasters at the volcano.

<text>Leontien Martha Henrica Petronella Zijlaard-van Moorsel (born 22 March 1970) is a Dutch retired racing cyclist. She was a dominant cyclist in the 1990s and early 2000s, winning four gold medals at the Olympic Games and holding the hour record for women from 2003 until 2015.

==Career==

Van Moorsel started her career in 1977. She won major races both on the track, and on the road. In the first half of the 1990s, she won the Tour Féminin twice, after fierce competition with Jeannie Longo.

Van Moorsel dropped out of cycling in 1994 with anorexia nervosa but recovered to compete at the World Championships in 1998, winning the time trial and coming second in the road race.

At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, van Moorsel won gold medals on the road (road race and time trial), and on the track (3 km pursuit). At the 2004 Summer Olympics, she fell in the penultimate lap of the road race and was stretchered off and taken to the hospital by ambulance, but nevertheless successfully defended her time trial title two days later.

She set a new world hour record for women of 46.065 km, in 2003 in Mexico City, which was not improved upon for almost 12 years, when UCI rule changes prompted a new succession of attempts.

Van Moorsel retired from professional cycling after the 2004 Olympics.

In 2017 Van Moorsel became director of the Women&#x27;s Amstel Gold Race.

In September 2017, Van Moorsel was accused by sports physician Peter Janssen of using EPO in 2000 and 2001.

<text>Joseph Edward Murray (April 1, 1919 – November 26, 2012) was an American plastic surgeon who is known as the &quot;father of transplantation&quot; for major milestones in the field of transplantation, including performing the first successful human kidney transplant, defining brain death, organizing the first international conference on human kidney transplants, and founding the National Kidney Registry, the forerunner of the current United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS). As of 2013, more than one million patients were estimated to have benefitted from organ transplantation around the world.

Murray shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1990 with E. Donnall Thomas for &quot;their discoveries concerning organ and cell transplantation in the treatment of human disease.&quot;

==Biography==
Murray was born on April 1, 1919, in Milford, Massachusetts, to noted lawyer and local judge, William Murray and William A. and Mary (née DePasquale) Murray, a schoolteacher. He was of Irish and Italian descent. A star athlete at the Milford High School, he excelled in football, ice hockey, and baseball. After being influenced by his family doctor, Murray resolved to become a surgeon.

Upon graduation, Murray attended the College of the Holy Cross with the intent to play baseball. However, his baseball practices and lab schedules conflicted, forcing him to give up the sport. He studied philosophy and English, earning a degree in the humanities at Holy Cross in 1940. Murray subsequently attended Harvard Medical School; after graduating with his medical degree in 1943, Murray began his internship at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital. During that time, he was inducted into the Medical Corps of the U.S. Army.

Murray served in the plastic surgery unit from 1944 to 1947 at Valley Forge General Hospital in Pennsylvania. At Valley Forge General Hospital, he worked for Bradford Cannon, a prominent plastic surgeon, and developed a passion for plastic surgery. His unit cared for thousands of soldiers wounded on the battlefields of World War II, working to reconstruct their disfigured hands and faces. His interest in transplantation grew out of working with burn patients during his time in the Army. Murray and his colleagues observed that the burn victims rejected temporary skin grafts from unrelated donors much more slowly than had been expected, suggesting the potential for organ grafts, or transplants. In particular Murray was impressed with the case of Charles Woods, a 22-year-old pilot who had sustained burns over 70% of his body, including his face and hands, which required covering the burned areas with cadaveric skin grafts. The donor grafts survived long enough for Woods’ own healthy skin to be harvested and used as autografts to cover the burned areas. Over the course of 24 operations, the surgical team was able to remodel his eyelids, nose, mouth and hands, with Woods surviving the operations and eventually becoming a successful businessman. Murray would later recall, &quot;“The questions raised and lessons learned in trying to help Charles would determine the course of the rest of my professional life.”.&quot; Murray&#x27;s first exposure to the field of reconstructive surgery ignited his lifelong passion for correcting terrible physical deformities and spawned another interest, transplantation – for Murray had seen for the first time how the tissue of one person could be used to save the life of another.

In 2001, Murray published his autobiography, &quot;Surgery Of The Soul: Reflections on a Curious Career,&quot; with stories about how surgery treats the souls of the patient and the surgeon, as well as the disease.

==Career==
After his military service, Murray completed his general surgical residency, and joined the surgical staff of the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital. He then went to New York to train in plastic surgery at New York and Memorial Hospitals, returning to the Brigham as a member of the surgical staff in 1951. Many of his peers discounted his pursuit, believing that the problem of immune rejection was insurmountable, as French surgeon Alexis Carrel (1873–1944), a 1912 Nobel Prize laureate, had concluded from his research that a “biological force” would forever prevent successful transplantation.

Murray was a practicing Catholic and faith played a role in his professional as well as his personal life. During preparations for the first transplant surgery, Murray and his team consulted clergy of all denominations while weighing the ethical issues of the procedure.

On December 23, 1954, Murray performed the world&#x27;s first successful renal transplant between the identical Herrick twins at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital (&quot;later Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital&quot;), an operation that lasted five and a half hours. He was assisted by J. Hartwell Harrison and other noted physicians. In Operating Room 2 of the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, Murray transplanted a healthy kidney donated by Ronald Herrick into his twin brother Richard, who was dying of chronic nephritis. Richard lived for eight more years following the operation, long enough to get married and have two children before succumbing to cardiac failure eight years later. His donor brother Ronald had no major complications and lived over 50 years after the surgery.

Throughout the following years, Murray became an international leader in the study of transplantation biology, the use of immunosuppressive agents, and studies on the mechanisms of rejection, as well as the study of how to ensure the health and well-being of living donors, and unequivocal opposition to monetary payment for human organs.

In 1959, Murray went on to perform the world&#x27;s first successful allograft, who received a kidney from his non-identical brother, after being treated with total body irradiation and continued to live for another 28 years.

in 1960, Murray had to get the approval of the Massachusetts Superior courtl before being able to transplant a kidney for a family who travelled from Red Deer, Alberta, Canada to see Dr. Murray from 12-year-old Lana Nightingale into her twin sister Johanna, who became the longest surviving kidney-transplant recipient with over 50 years, which is still the World Guinness Record for longest surviving kidney transplant patient.

Dr. Murray teamed up with Nobel prize laureates Drs. George H. Hitchings and Gertrude B. Elion, both at Burroughs-Wellcome, who recognized the immunosuppressive capacities of 6–Mercaptopurin (6-MP) and synthesized the first immunosuppressive drugs. Together, they tailored the new drug Imuran (generic azathioprine) for use in transplants. The discovery of Imuran and other anti-rejection drugs, such as prednisone, allowed Murray to carry out transplants from unrelated donors. In 1962, Dr. Murray performed the first successful deceased donor (cadaveric) kidney transplant treated with Imuran, a derivate of 6-MP and steroids. By 1965, the survival rates after receiving a kidney transplant from an unrelated donor exceeded 65%, and today the success rate for a kidney transplant from a living donor is 90–95% after one year and the transplanted kidney lasts 15 to 20 years on average.

Dr. Murray worked on all the steps necessary to establish organ transplantation as the clinical treatment of choice for patients with irreversible organ failure. In 1962, Dr. Murray led the organization of the first international conference on human kidney transplants in 1962, followed by the founding of the National Kidney Registry, the forerunner of the current United Network Of Organ Sharing (UNOS). In 1967, he participated in defining brain death, when Robert Ebert, the Dean of the Harvard Medical School convened a group of physicians, ethicists, and legal scholars to examine the characteristics of a permanently nonfunctioning brain, and Dr Murray was a member of that committee, which included famed neurosurgeon William Sweet, neurologist Raymond Adams, and legal scholar William J. Curran. The work of this committee led to consistent criteria that could be applied prospectively to declare death and ultimately to the Uniform Determination of Death Act (UDDA) in 1981.

As a Harvard Medical School faculty member, Murray trained physicians from around the world in transplantation and reconstructive surgery, frequently performing surgeries in developing countries. In his 20 years as director of the Surgical Research Laboratory at Harvard and as chief of transplant surgery from 1951 to 1971at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital (which later became Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital), he inspired others who became leaders in transplantation and biology throughout the world.

Notwithstanding his pioneering work in human transplantation, Murray&#x27;s true passion was still reconstructive surgery. In choosing between the two, he decided to step down as chief of transplant surgery at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in 1971 to focus on paediatric reconstructive surgery, becoming the chief of plastic surgery from 1972 to 1985 at the Boston Children&#x27;s Hospital Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts. He developed procedures for repairing birth defects and treating paediatric burn victims.

Murray retired as professor of Surgery Emeritus in 1986 from Harvard Medical School after recovering from a small stroke.

==Awards and recognitions==
In 1990, he was honored with the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his pioneering work in organ transplantation, together with hematologist E. Donnall Thomas&quot;.&quot;

Murray was elected as a member of the National Academy of Sciences and as a regent of the American College of Surgeons. He received the American Surgical Association&#x27;s Medal for Distinguished Service to Surgery, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences&#x27; Francis Amory Prize, the American Association of Plastic Surgeons&#x27; Honorary Award and Clinician of the Year Award, and the National Kidney Foundation&#x27;s Gift of Life Award.

He was named one of the 350 most outstanding citizens representing the medical profession for the City of Boston&#x27;s 350th anniversary. In 1991, Murray received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 1996, he was appointed Academician of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in the Vatican. Murray was selected to receive the Laetare Medal by the University of Notre Dame in recognition of outstanding service to the Catholic Church and society in March 2005.

==Personal life and death==
Joseph Murray married his college life sweetheart Virginia (Bobby) née Link in June 1945, the two having first met at the Boston Symphony Orchestra, with whom he would have 6 children: 3 boys and 3 girls. At the time of his death, they had been married for 67 years and had 18 grandchildren and 9 great-grandchildren. Dr. Murray died on November 26, 2012, aged 93. He suffered a stroke at his suburban Boston home on Thanksgiving and died at Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital, the very hospital where he had performed the first organ transplant operation.

<text>Lyndon Ferns (born 24 September 1983 in Pietersburg, South Africa) is a retired Olympic gold-medalist and former world record swimmer from South Africa who attended the University of Arizona. He swam for South Africa at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics.&lt;ref name=&quot;SR/Olympics&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==University of Arizona==
He attended the University of Arizona from 2002-2006, where he competed and was trained and mentored by Hall of Fame Head Coach [[Frank Busch}} and former Olympian and sprint coach, [[Rick DeMont]], who also coached Ferns&#x27;s South African team at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics. Overall, Ferns was a four time NCAA champion during his time at Arizona. Lyndon completed his eligibility as a 24-time All-American, a PAC-10 champion, an NCAA record holder, 3-time relay national champion as well as national champion in the 100y butterfly. He had six top-five finishes at NCAA tournaments. 
While at UA, he completed a Bachelors of Science degree in Accounting. 

Swimming for Arizona, Ferns set a school record of 45.89 seconds as an NCAA champion in the 100-meter butterfly. He was a was a member of the 400 freestyle, 400 medley and 800 freestyle NCAA Championship relay teams that helped lead Arizonas to a second-place finish at the NCAA Championships. While at Arizona, he earned eight individual First Team All- America honors and All- American honors in 15 relays.

==2004 Athens, 2008 Beijing Olympics==
At the [[South Africa at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympics]], he was a member of South Africa&#x27;s [[Swimming at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Men&#x27;s 4 × 100 metre freestyle relay|Men&#x27;s 4×100 m freestyle relay]] that won the event in a [[World record progression 4 × 100 metres freestyle relay|world record]]. Ferns&#x27;s 100-meter swim leg helped South Africa upset the United States and Russia in the 400 meter freestyle relay at the 2004 games, an historic upset over two teams that had dominated the event. As their fastest swimmer, Ferns&#x27;s University of Arizona team mate Roland Schoeman&#x27;s opening leg in the 4x100 relay, opened up a lead that remained throughout the race defeating the teams from both the Netherlands and the United States by over a second. 

Lyndon also competed at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, where he set the African record in the 100m freestyle at 48.00, earning a sixth place in the finals. He also competed in the 100m butterfly, 4 × 100 m freestyle relay and 4 × 100 m medley relay at the Beijing Olympics.

Three of the 2004 South African Olympic 4x100 gold medal freestyle relay team were a part of the relay that broke the record and won gold at the 4x100 meter freestyle at the [[Swimming at the 2006 Commonwealth Games|2006 Commonwealth Games]].

===2007, 2009 World Championships===
During the 2007 World Championships held in Melbourne, Australia, Lyndon became the first man out of Africa to complete the 100m butterfly in under 52 seconds, touching the wall in 51.90 seconds and thereby breaking his own African record. He was also part of the 4 × 100 m freestyle and 4 × 100 m medley relay, both placing fourth.

In May 2009, it was announced that he was selected to participate with South Africa&#x27;s team in the [[2009 World Aquatics Championships|2009 World Championships]]. At the World Championships, Lyndon became the first male athlete from Africa to complete the 100m freestyle in under 48 seconds, setting a new African record of 47.79 seconds. He is still the only man from Africa to have completed the 100m freestyle in a sub 48 second time.

Lyndon later won a bronze medal in the 2010 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Irvine in the 4x100 meter freestyle relay in what would become a signature event for the sprinter.

He is the holder of the following records:

* [[List of African records in swimming|African records]]: 100 m freestyle, 4×100 m freestyle relay
* [[List of South African records in swimming|South African records]]: 100 m freestyle, 4×100 m Freestyle relay

In April 2011, he retired from competitive swimming, and continued to reside in South Africa.

===Honors===
In August, 2024, he was inducted into the South African Sports Hall of Fame, along with the three other swimmers who won the gold medal in the 4x100 meter freestyle relay at the 2004 Athens Olympics.

<doc id="917201" wikidata="Q538478" url="?curid=917201" title="Gilbert Murray">
<text>George Gilbert Aimé Murray (2 January 1866 – 20 May 1957) was an Australian-born British classical scholar and public intellectual, with connections in many spheres. He was an outstanding scholar of the language and culture of Ancient Greece, perhaps the leading authority in the first half of the twentieth century. He is the basis for the character of Adolphus Cusins in his friend George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s play &quot;Major Barbara&quot;, and also appears as the chorus figure in Tony Harrison&#x27;s play &quot;Fram&quot;.

He served as President of the Ethical Union (now Humanists UK) from 1929 to 1930 and was a delegate at the inaugural World Humanist Congress in 1952 which established Humanists International. He was a leader of the League of Nations Society and the League of Nations Union, which promoted the League of Nations in Britain.

Murray died in Oxford in 1957, aged 91. His ashes were interred in Poets&#x27; Corner, Westminster Abbey.

== Early life ==
Murray was born in Sydney, Australia. He came from an Irish Catholic family and his ancestors fought at the Battle of the Boyne and in the 1798 Rebellion. His family all supported Irish Home Rule and were critical of the British government&#x27;s actions elsewhere in the Empire. His father, Sir Terence Aubrey Murray, who died in 1873, had been a Member of the New South Wales Parliament; Gilbert&#x27;s mother, Agnes Ann Murray (née Edwards), ran a girls&#x27; school in Sydney for a few years. Then, in 1877, Agnes emigrated with Gilbert to the UK, where she died in 1891.

Murray was educated at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School and St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he took his B.A. in 1886 in Greats with first-class honours with congratulations. He distinguished himself in writing both Greek and Latin, winning the Gaisford Prize for Greek Prose Composition, The Gaisford Prize for Greek Verse Composition, and the Chancellor’s Prize for Latin Composition.

== Classicist ==

=== Academic career ===
From 1889 to 1899, Murray was Professor of Greek at the University of Glasgow. There was a break in his academic career from 1899 to 1905, when he returned to Oxford; he interested himself in dramatic and political writing. After 1908 he was Regius Professor of Greek at the University of Oxford. In the same year he invited Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff to Oxford, where the Prussian philologist delivered two lectures: &quot;Greek Historical Writing&quot; and &quot;Apollo&quot; (later, he would replicate them in Cambridge).

From 1925 to 1926, he was the Charles Eliot Norton Lecturer at Harvard University.

=== Greek drama ===
Murray is perhaps now best known for his verse translations of Greek drama, which were popular and prominent in their time. As a poet he was generally taken to be a follower of Swinburne and had little sympathy from the modernist poets of the rising generation. The staging of Athenian drama in English did have its own cultural impact. He had earlier experimented with his own prose dramas, without much success.

Over time he worked through almost the entire canon of Athenian dramas (Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides in tragedy; Aristophanes in comedy). From Euripides, the &quot;Hippolytus&quot; and &quot;The Bacchae&quot; (together with &quot;The Frogs&quot; of Aristophanes; first edition, 1902); the &quot;Medea&quot;, &quot;Trojan Women&quot;, and &quot;Electra&quot; (1905–1907); &quot;Iphigenia in Tauris&quot; (1910); &quot;The Rhesus&quot; (1913) were presented at the Court Theatre, in London. In the United States Granville Barker and his wife Lillah McCarthy gave outdoor performances of &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; and &quot;Iphigenia in Tauris&quot; at various colleges (1915).

The translation of &quot;Œdipus Rex&quot; was a commission from W. B. Yeats. Until 1912 this could not have been staged for a British audience, due to its depiction of incest. Murray was drawn into the public debate on censorship that came to a head in 1907 and was pushed by William Archer, whom he knew well from Glasgow, George Bernard Shaw, and others such as John Galsworthy, J. M. Barrie and Edward Garnett. A petition was taken to Herbert Gladstone, then Home Secretary, early in 1908.

=== The Ritualists ===
He was one of the scholars associated with Jane Harrison in the myth-ritual school of mythography. They met first in 1900. He wrote an appendix on the Orphic tablets for her 1903 book &quot;Prolegomena&quot;; he later contributed to her &quot;Themis&quot; (1912).

Murray&#x27;s openly expressed pro-Home Rule and anti-imperialist views, combined with his failure to support the cause of retaining compulsory Greek, antagonised his colleagues at Oxford University, who were mostly Conservative and Unionist. In 1910, he recalled, only New College, Balliol College and Jesus College continued to send pupils to his lectures; the absence of undergraduates from Christ Church, to which his Chair was attached, was particularly noticeable.

== In public life ==

=== Liberal Party politics ===
He was a lifelong supporter of the Liberal Party, lining up on the Irish Home Rule and non-imperialist sides of the splits in the party of the late nineteenth century. He supported temperance, and married into a prominent Liberal, aristocratic and temperance family, the Carlisles. He made a number of moves that might have taken him into parliamentary politics, initially by tentative thoughts about standing in elections during the 1890s. In 1901-2 he was in close contact with the Independent Labour Party. But the overall effect of the Second Boer War was to drive him back into the academic career he had put on hold in 1898, resigning his Glasgow chair (effective from April 1899).

He stood five times unsuccessfully for the University of Oxford constituency between 1919 and 1929. He continued support for the Asquith faction of Liberals, after the party was split again by Lloyd George. During the 1930s the Liberals as a party were crushed electorally, but Liberal thinkers continued to write; Murray was one of the signatory &quot;Next Five Years Group&quot; formed around Clifford Allen.

=== Activist ===

As Regius Professor and literary figure, he had a platform to promote his views, which were many-sided but Whig-liberal. In 1912 he wrote an introduction to &quot;The Great Analysis: A Plea for a Rational World-Order&quot;, by his friend William Archer.

During World War I he became a pamphleteer, putting a reasoned war case. He also defended C. K. Ogden against criticism, and took a public interest in conscientious objection. Murray never took a pacifist line himself, broke an old friendship with Bertrand Russell early in the war, and supported British intervention in the Suez Crisis.

He was also involved as an internationalist in the League of Nations. He was a vice-president of the League of Nations Society from 1916, and in 1917 wrote influential articles in &quot;The Daily News&quot;. At the invitation of Jan Smuts he acted in 1921/2 as a League delegate for South Africa. He was an influential member of the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League from 1922 to 1939, being its president from 1928 to 1939.

Later he was a major influence in the setting-up of Oxfam and of the Students&#x27; International Union (later the Institute of World Affairs).

=== Involvement with Wells ===
For a brief period Murray became closely involved with the novelist H. G. Wells. Initially this was in 1917 and connection with groups supporting a future League: Wells promoted a &quot;League of Free Nations Association&quot; (LFNA), an idea not in fact exclusive to him, since it had been &#x27;up in the air&#x27; since Woodrow Wilson had started considering post-war settlements. Wells applied through the British propaganda office with which Murray had been connected since 1914. The two men corresponded from 1917 about League matters. Wells was bullish about pushing ahead with a British LFNA, Murray was involved already in the League of Nations Society (LNS), though not active. The political position was delicate, as Murray understood and Wells may not have: the LNS overlapped with the Union of Democratic Control, which was too far towards the pacifist end of the spectrum of opinion to be effective in that time and context. Eventually in 1918 the LFNA was set up around Welsh Liberal MP David Davies, and then shortly the LFNA and LNS merged as the League of Nations Union.

Two years later, Wells called on Murray, and Murray&#x27;s New College colleague Ernest Barker, to lend their names as advisers on his &quot;The Outline of History&quot;. Their names duly appeared on the title page. Murray had to give evidence in the plagiarism case &quot;Deeks&quot; v. &quot;Wells&quot; that arose in 1925.

=== Psychical research ===

Murray held a deep interest in psychical research. Between 1916 and 1924, he conducted 236 experiments into telepathy and reported 36% as successful, although it was suggested that the results could be explained by hyperaesthesia as he could hear what was being said by the sender.

Murray was the President of the Society for Psychical Research in 1915–1916 and 1952.

== Humanism ==
Murray identified as a humanist, and even served as a President of the British Ethical Union (later known as the British Humanist Association). He joined the Rationalist Press Association, and in 1952 was a delegate to the inaugural World Humanist Congress which founded Humanists International. He wrote and broadcast extensively on religion (Greek, Stoic and Christian); and wrote several books dealing with his version of humanism, which he espoused as a naturalistic philosophy, contrasted with Christianity and revealed religion in general. He was President of the British Ethical Union (now Humanists UK) from 1929 to 1930.

A phrase from his 1910 lectures &quot;Four Stages of Greek Religion&quot; enjoyed public prominence: the &quot;failure of nerve&quot; of the Hellenistic world, of which a turn to irrationalism was symptomatic.

Murray was baptised as a Roman Catholic; his father was a Catholic, his mother a Protestant. His daughter Rosalind (later Rosalind Toynbee), a Catholic convert, attacked his atheism in her book of apologetics, &quot;The Good Pagan&#x27;s Failure&quot; (1939). About a month before he died, when he was bedridden, his daughter Rosalind called the local Catholic priest to see him. In an article in &quot;The Times&quot; following his death, however, his son Stephen made clear that Rosalind and Catholic friends did &quot;not want it thought that they claim he died a Roman Catholic&quot;. Stephen said that his sister &#x27;would not dream of making a public claim that he would re-enter the Church.&#x27;

Murray did not raise his own children to be religious. His great-granddaughter, Polly Toynbee, followed in his footsteps, becoming President of the British Humanist Association from 2009 to 2012.

== Awards and honours ==
He refused a knighthood in 1912, though he was appointed to the Order of Merit in 1941. He received honorary degrees from Glasgow, Birmingham, and Oxford.

He gave the 1914 Shakespeare Lecture of the British Academy. He gave the 1941 Andrew Lang Lecture.

Minor planet 941 Murray is named after him, for his support of Austria after World War I.

== Family ==
Murray&#x27;s father was Sir Terence Aubrey Murray and his brother Sir Hubert Murray. Murray&#x27;s mother, Agnes Ann Murray (née Edwards), was a cousin of the dramatist W. S. Gilbert.

Murray married Lady Mary Henrietta Howard (1865–1956), daughter of George Howard, 9th Earl of Carlisle. When her mother Rosalind Howard, Countess of Carlisle died in 1921, Castle Howard was left to Lady Mary. However, she passed it on to her surviving brother Geoffrey, (his son was George Howard, chairman of the British Broadcasting Corporation from 1981 until 1983) retaining an estate in Cumberland with an income of c. £5,000 per annum.

Gilbert and Lady Mary had five children, two daughters (Rosalind, 1890–1967 and Agnes Elizabeth 1894–1922) and three sons (Denis, Basil, and Stephen) including:
* Rosalind Murray (1890–1967), writer, married Arnold J. Toynbee, and was the mother of
** Philip Toynbee, critic, father of
*** Polly Toynbee, journalist.
* Denis George Murray (also known as Denys, 1892-1930). Attended Oxford. Joined Vickers Ltd in 1912. Granted Royal Aero Club pilot&#x27;s certificate No.750 in a Caudron biplane at The Ewen School, Hendon on 11 March 1914. Joined the Royal Naval Air Service on 5 August 1914 as a Flight Lieutenant. Mentioned in Dispatches for his work in the bombing of Ostend, Zeebrugge and Bruges in February 1915 but was shot down near to the Dutch coast, suffering burns, and interned at Groningen, the Netherlands. He was released due to periodontitis in 1917. Although he served in the Royal Air Force in 1919 and worked in the Air Historical Branch researching for Sir Walter Raleigh&#x27;s official air history, he never fully recovered and died suddenly in March 1930. He married in December 1918 Phyllis Evelyn Keller (1888–1977).
* Agnes Elizabeth Murray (1894–1922). Attended Somerville College, Oxford, but gave up her studies to spend two years nursing before serving as an RAF dispatch rider and as an ambulance driver for the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry Corps. She died of peritonitis in France.
* Basil Murray, 1903–1937, who was a well-known and rather &quot;louche&quot; figure, and friend of Evelyn Waugh. His wife, Pauline, was a daughter of the artist Algernon Newton RA, and a sister of actor Robert Newton.
** The writer Venetia Murray (3 January 1932 – 26 September 2004) was Basil&#x27;s daughter, as was
** Ann Paludan (1928–2014), writer on Chinese history.
*** Mark Jones, former director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, is Ann&#x27;s son and Elizabeth Murray, a doctor and medical researcher at University College, London, was her daughter.

* Stephen (February 1908 – July 1994), radical lawyer, married the architect Margaret Gillet. Stephen gave up law and became a farmer and lived at &quot;Greenside&quot; farm, Hallbankgate, Cumbria. He was chairman of Border Rural District Council (1962–66), of Cumberland County Council, of the Lake District Special Planning Board (1977–81) and of Cumbria County Council (1985–87). They were parents of
** Gilbert, killed in climbing accident on the Fox Glacier in New Zealand in the 1950s
** Alexander (Sandy), academic medievalist historian at Oxford University
** Robin, academic, economist, chair of Twin Trading
** Hubert, architect, now practising in Boston, Massachusetts, USA
The four children were evacuated during the Second World War from London to the Sands House Hotel, Brampton, Cumberland, which was converted to temperance status by Lady Rosalind, and run by Mr and Mrs James Warwick, formerly in her service, with their daughter Charlotte Elizabeth. She became an enduring friend of the boys and an unfinished letter to her was found on Gilbert&#x27;s body after the accident.

<text>Pacaya is an active complex volcano in Guatemala, which first erupted approximately 23,000 years ago and has erupted at least 23 times since the Spanish conquest of Guatemala. It rises to an elevation of . After being dormant for over 70 years, it began erupting vigorously in 1961 and has been erupting frequently since then. Much of its activity is Strombolian, but occasionally Plinian eruptions also occur, sometimes showering the area of the nearby Departments with ash.

Pacaya is a popular tourist attraction. It is even the home to the popular Guatemala Impact Marathon which pioneered the use of a running route across the lava field created by the 2010 eruption and supports the local communities through runners endeavouring to complete the challenge. It lies 30 kilometers (19 miles) southwest of Guatemala City and close to Antigua. The volcano sits inside the Escuintla Department. Volcano Boarding is also practiced on the craters of Pacaya.

Villagers near Pacaya ignored an evacuation request as the volcano threw ash into the air in March 2021.

==Geological history==
The Pacaya volcano is a part of the Central American Volcanic Arc, a chain of volcanoes stretching from the northwest to the southeast along the Pacific coast of Central America, formed by the tectonic subduction of the Cocos Tectonic Plate beneath the Caribbean Plate. Pacaya lies on the southern edge of a sizable volcanic caldera formed in the Pleistocene age which contains Lago de Amatitlán. This caldera has been the source of at least nine very large explosions over the past 300,000 years, erupting a total of about of magma.

After the last caldera-forming eruption 23,000 years ago, several smaller vents within and around the caldera have seen eruptive activity. Pacaya is the largest post-caldera volcano, and has been one of Central America&#x27;s most active volcanoes over the last 500 years. It has erupted at least 23 times since the Spanish conquest, producing basalt and basaltic andesite.

About 1,100  years ago the volcano&#x27;s edifice collapsed, causing a huge landslide. Deposits from the landslide travelled about from the volcano down to the Pacific coastal plain. The landslide left a large crater, within which the current active cone has grown. The presence of a magma chamber at shallow depths beneath Pacaya means that distortion of the cone leading to instability and future landslides remains a hazard to the surrounding areas.

==Recent eruptions==

With its almost continuous activity, the volcano has been a popular location for tourism, and is easily accessible from Guatemala City and from Antigua. Pacaya and the surrounding area now lie within the Pacaya National Park, which was created to supervise and protect tourism in this region. The Pacaya Park generates its income from tour groups who are charged a fee of about100 Quetzales to enter the park.

In 1998, several explosive eruptions emitted lava, debris and ash columns with a height of to . The ash fall affected nearby cities including Guatemala city and La Aurora International Airport.

During 2006, a slight increase in Pacaya&#x27;s volcanic activity brought about the creation of several lava rivers that slowly flowed down its slope. Word about these phenomena spread, and local tourism increased significantly.

===May 2010 eruption===

On May 27, 2010, the Pacaya volcano erupted, followed by several tremors. At approximately 20:00 hours there was a strong eruption ejecting debris and ash columns up to . Ash rained down in many Guatemalan cities to the northwest of the volcano, including Guatemala City. The volcanic ash fall pelted Guatemala City, and the international airport, La Aurora. The National Coordinator for Disaster Reduction (CONRED) declared a red alert for the communities near the volcano and recommended the evacuation of some of them. Noti7 reporter Anibal Archila, one of the first to cover the event, was reportedly killed by volcanic debris.

President Álvaro Colom declared a state of calamity in the region adjacent to the volcano, and the Ministry of Education closed the schools in the departments of Guatemala, Escuintla, and Sacatepequez. Heavy rainfall from Tropical Storm Agatha worsened the emergency situation, causing lahars, landslides and widespread flooding across the country. However, people working in coffee fields considered the rain brought by the storm to be helpful, removing ash from their trees.

<text>A concierge () is an employee of a multi-tenant building, such as a hotel or apartment building, who receives and helps guests. The concept has been applied more generally to other hospitality settings and to personal concierges who manage the errands of private clients.

==Duties and functions==
=== In history ===
In medieval times, the concierge was an officer of the king who was charged with executing justice, with the help of his bailiffs. Initially working as a porter of a castle, under Hugh Capet up to Louis XI, the term was transferred to a high official of the kingdom and - after the castles had lost their defensive function and served as prisons - also to prison guards, appointed by the king to maintain order and oversee the police and prisoner records.

=== In apartment or office buildings ===
The concierge serves inhabitants and guests of an apartment or office building with duties similar to those of a receptionist. The position can also be maintained by a security guard over the late night shift.

In 19th-century and early 20th-century apartment buildings, particularly in Paris, the concierge was known as a &quot;Suisse&quot;, as the post was often filled by Swiss people. They often had a small apartment on the ground floor, called &quot;loge&quot;, and were able to monitor all comings and goings. However, such settings are now extremely rare; most concierges in small or middle-sized buildings have been replaced by the part-time services of door-staff. Some larger apartment buildings or groups of buildings retain the use of concierges. The concierge may, for instance, keep the mail of absented dwellers, be entrusted with the apartment keys to deal with emergencies when residents are absent, provide information to residents and guests, provide access control, enforce rules, and act as a go-between for residents and management when management is not on-site.

=== In hotels ===
A hotel concierge is mainly employed in the luxury hotel industry and is often located near the reception desk with their own counter. While the receptionist deals with check-in, check-out and other hotel-related matters in the narrower sense, the concierge is available to guests as a contact person for other inquiries, such as advice and bookings for excursions, transfers and restaurants. They often have special contacts, acting as a “door opener”. They are at the service of guests who usually have the highest expectations and with whom they sometimes build up a close relationship, especially with regular guests.

The international professional association of hotel concierges is the &quot;Union Internationale des Concierges d&#x27;Hotels&quot; with the distinctive mark &quot;Les Clefs d&#x27;Or&quot;, a kind of insignia in the form of two gold-plated keys crossed over each other, which the concierge wears on his lapel. The association has 4,500 members from 34 countries (2007). Candidates for membership must have reached a minimum age, speak two foreign languages or more, have at least five years of “hall service” in a luxury hotel and provide a recommendation from at least two people.

=== In hospitals ===

In hospitals, concierge services are becoming increasingly available. A hospital concierge provides similar services to those of a hotel concierge, but serves patients and employees as well. This helps hospital employees who work long shifts and helps to provide work–life balance.

=== Personal concierge ===
A modern concierge may also serve as a lifestyle manager, like a secretary or a personal assistant.

There are numerous independent &quot;personal concierge&quot; companies that provide errand services and information services for their members. Services include informational requests, setting dinner reservations, making telephone calls, researching travel arrangements and more. Typically, concierge companies will bill on an hourly rate, and depending upon the type of task, fees can vary drastically. Other companies bill a flat monthly fee based upon the number of requests a member is allowed to place each month. In the United Kingdom, since the year 2000 and as of 2010, concierge has become a key marketing and loyalty tool in the banking sector and offered as a benefit on luxury credit cards. This service offering is also known as lifestyle management. Concierges also entertain their clients.

Additionally, concierge services are now frequently offered as a service by financial institutions to their most valuable clients as way of retaining and attracting clients. Lifestyle and travel concierge companies often offer their service as a white-label or semi-branded product on a business-to-business-to-consumer (B2B2C) basis. Banks who currently offer concierge services to clients include Coutts, China Merchants Bank, RBC, and HSBC.

Airport concierge services help travellers make it through security, customs, and immigration faster, and provide lounge access.

The owners and operators of concierge, lifestyle management, and errand service businesses are supported and advocated by the non-profit International Concierge and Lifestyle Management Association (ICLMA) and the National Concierge Association.

==Etymology==
The French word &quot;concierge&quot; is likely derived from the Old French &quot;cumcerges&quot;, itself related to the Medieval Latin &quot;consergius&quot; or the Latin &quot;conservus&quot; (&quot;fellow slave&quot;).

Another possibility, suggested by French authors as early as the 19th century, is that &quot;concierge&quot; is a contraction of &quot;comte des cierges&quot; (&quot;count of candles&quot;), a servant responsible for maintaining the lighting and cleanliness of medieval palaces.

<text>William B. Murphy (January 9, 1908 – July 2, 1970) was an American film editor who, in the course of a twenty-year career, served as president of American Cinema Editors (ACE) from 1952 to 1955 and was distinguished in 1966 with ACE&#x27;s Eddie Award for his work on the science fiction film, &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot;, which also earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Editing.

Born in Mexia, a small city in Central Texas&#x27; Limestone County, William B. Murphy was 41 when his name first appeared in film credits as co-editor (with Richard Cahoon) of the independently produced 1949 B-western, &quot;Massacre River&quot;, released by United Artists. The following year, hired by 20th Century Fox, he worked on several of the studio&#x27;s 1950s &quot;A&quot; productions, including three Clifton Webb vehicles, &quot;Mr. Belvedere Rings the Bell&quot;, &quot;Elopement&quot; (both 1951) and &quot;Mister Scoutmaster&quot; (1953), as well as Howard Hawks&#x27; Cary Grant-Ginger Rogers 1952 comedy, &quot;Monkey Business&quot;, and the 1957 Pat Boone-Shirley Jones musical, &quot;April Love&quot;. He also proved adept at westerns, editing &quot;Powder River&quot; (1953), &quot;Three Young Texans&quot;, &quot;The Gambler from Natchez&quot; (both 1954), &quot;Stranger on Horseback&quot; (1955), &quot;Mohawk&quot; (1956) and &quot;The Lonely Man&quot; (1957).

Leaving Fox in 1957, he served as editorial supervisor on several film and television projects (&quot;The Bachelor Party&quot;, &quot;Kings Go Forth&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot;) and, by 1959, returned as a full-time editor in features and TV episodes, with credits on the independent science fiction production, &quot;4D Man&quot;, along with at least eight installments of the hit ABC crime drama, &quot;The Untouchables&quot;.

In his final decade, 1960s, Murphy edited an entry in the series of films tailored for Elvis Presley, &quot;Follow That Dream&quot; (1962), followed by a psychiatric hospital melodrama, &quot;The Caretakers&quot; (1963), and the big-budget 1965 spoof, &quot;John Goldfarb, Please Come Home&quot;. Among his last three features, another top-dollar production, &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot;, not only had a much bigger budget than his previous sci-fi assignment, &quot;4D Man&quot;, but also proved to be a major moneymaker, ultimately going on to become one of the year&#x27;s highest-grossing films with Oscar nominations in five technical categories, two of which, Best Art Direction—Color and Best Visual Effects, were selected as winners. Although Murphy lost in the Best Editing category to the &quot;Grand Prix&quot; team of Fredric Steinkamp, Henry Berman, Stewart Linder and Frank Santillo, his win of ACE&#x27;s Eddie Award, in addition to the film&#x27;s other awards and nominations (Hugo, Laurel and the Motion Picture Sound Editors&#x27; Golden Reel Award), brought him accolades and professional renown at near-end of his career. His penultimate film, Roger Corman&#x27;s 1967 recreation of &quot;The St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre&quot;, returned to the same milieu he had covered while working on &quot;The Untouchables&quot; and, concluding his list of credits was Delbert Mann&#x27;s &quot;The Pink Jungle&quot;, a tepidly reviewed 1968 comedy-adventure set in a South American jungle.

William B. Murphy died in Los Angeles at the age of 62.

<text>William Beverly Murphy (June 17, 1907 – May 29, 1994) was an American food businessman. He was the president and CEO of Campbell Soup Company between 1953 and 1972. From 1942 to 1945 he was on leave from Campbell&#x27;s Soup to the War Production Board. Prior to joining Campbell&#x27;s Soup he was at the A.C. Nielsen Company (1928–1938) where he is credited with conceiving the idea for the Nielsen Food Index and Nielsen Drug Index Services. Murphy was also a life member emeritus of the MIT Corporation (Massachusetts Institute of Technology).

== Life ==
Murphy was born in Appleton, Wisconsin, and received a Bachelor of Science in chemical engineering from the University of Wisconsin in 1928. He subsequently joined the A.C. Nielsen Company of Chicago and rose to the position of executive vice president. He joined Campbell Soup in 1938 as Assistant to General Manager. Murphy was elected executive vice president of Campbell Soup in 1949 and was president and CEO from 1953 to 1972. Murphy died May 29, 1994, at the age of 86 of pneumonia in a convalescent home in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.

While at Campbell&#x27;s Soup Company he took the corporation public and increased its brand portfolio to include Pepperidge Farm breads, cookies, and crackers, Franco-American gravies and pastas, V8 juice (vegetable), Swanson broths, and Godiva (chocolatier).

Murphy was a special term member of the MIT Corporation from 1961–65 and a life member from 1965–82. He served on several MIT standing committees, including the Auditing Committee (1984–86), the Executive Committee (1966–72 and 1976–82), and the Membership Committee (1964–67). He was a member of the visiting committees for the Department of Applied Biological Sciences (1985–88), the Department of Nutrition and Food Science (1980–85 and 1974–80 as chairman), the MIT Sloan School of Management (1972–76 and 1965–66, and 1964–65 as chairman), and the School of Industrial Management (1961–63, 1963–64 as chairman and 1959–61 as a presidential nominee).

As head of Campbell Soup, Murphy&#x27;s managerial style, which prioritized lean manufacturing, fostered conflict with his workers who contested his high production targets. The climax of this conflict occurred in 1968, when the AFL-CIO affiliated locals at the Campbell plants attempted to coordinate their contracts. Murphy firmly opposed the coordinated bargaining across his plants; divisions between the different locals limited their gains, and his managerial vision prevailed.

In 1980, former president and chairman of the MIT Corporation Paul Gray presented Murphy with the Henry Laurence Gantt Memorial Medal. It is awarded jointly by the American Management Associations and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers for &quot;distinguished achievement in management as a service to the community.&quot;

In addition to serving on several government advisory panels, Murphy was a director of companies including AT&amp;T, Merck &amp; Co., Inc., and International Paper. He also served as national chairman of Radio Free Europe in 1960–61 and as chairman of the board of trustees of the Nutrition Foundation in 1964–65.

<text>Robert Daniel Murphy (October 28, 1894 – January 9, 1978) was an American diplomat. He served as the first United States Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs when the position was established during the Eisenhower administration. 

==Early life and career==
Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Murphy began his federal career at the United States Post Office (1916) and moved to be cipher clerk at the American Legation in Bern, Switzerland (1917). He was admitted to the US Foreign Service in 1921. Among the several posts that he held were Vice-Consul in Zürich and Munich, consul in Seville, consul in Paris from 1930 to 1936, and chargé d&#x27;affaires to the Vichy government. He was also the one-time State Department specialist on France.

==World War II==
In February 1941, Murphy negotiated the Murphy-Weygand Agreement, which allowed the United States to export to French North Africa in spite of the British blockade and trade restrictions against the Vichy-governed area.

In autumn of 1942, at President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s behest, Murphy investigated conditions in French North Africa in preparation for the Allied landings, Operation Torch, the first major Western Allied ground offensive during World War II. He was appointed the President&#x27;s personal representative with the rank of Minister to French North Africa. Murphy made contact with various French army officers in Algiers and recruited them to support the Allies when the invasion of French North Africa came. During this time, Kenneth Pendar served as his second.

Prior to the November 8 invasion, Murphy, along with U.S. General Mark W. Clark, had worked to gain the cooperation of French General Henri Giraud for the attack. The Americans and British hoped to place Giraud in charge of all French forces in North Africa and command them for the Allied cause. Giraud, however, mistakenly believed that he was to assume command of all Allied forces in North Africa, which put Murphy&#x27;s diplomatic skills to the test to keep Giraud on board.

Murphy and Clark jointly convinced the French in North Africa to accept Admiral François Darlan, the commander of all French military Forces loyal to the Vichy regime and coincidentally in Algiers, as the highest authority in French North Africa and Giraud as Commander of all French military in North Africa. Murphy used his friendly contacts with the French in North Africa to gain their co-operation in re-entering the war against the Axis. He also needed all his diplomatic skills to steer Clark away from confrontation with the French, especially Darlan. When Darlan was assassinated in late December, an irritant to good relations was removed.

Keeping the French united and aligned with the Allies into 1943 taxed Murphy&#x27;s skills to their limit. He gained a powerful ally in British politician (and future Prime Minister) Harold Macmillan, also posted to Algiers in January 1943. The two diplomats worked together amiably to ensure that the Casablanca Conference went smoothly in January 1943 and that Giraud and de Gaulle would join forces to unite the French among the Allies. Keeping the quarrelsome French united and working with the Americans and British exasperated and exhausted Murphy. When Eisenhower needed a civilian from the State Department to assume a similar role in Italy in 1943, Murphy gladly accepted it and left Algiers behind.

==Later career==
*1948 advisor for General Lucius D. Clay, American military governor of American-occupied Germany, during the Soviet Russian Blockade of Berlin, and the Berlin Airlift, &quot;Operation Vittles&quot; 
*1949 Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, Belgium
*1952 Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, Japan (first American ambassador to Japan after World War II)
*1953 Assistant Secretary for United Nations Affairs
*1953 Deputy Under Secretary for Political Affairs (Assistant Secretary)
*1955 Deputy Under Secretary for Political Affairs
*1956 Career Ambassador
*1958 Personal representative of President Dwight D. Eisenhower during the 1958 Lebanon crisis
*1959 Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs
*1959 Head of International Operations, Corning Glass Works

==Later life==
Murphy retired from the State Department in December 1959 but became an adviser to Presidents John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Richard Nixon. He served on President Gerald Ford&#x27;s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.

He was a member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group.

In 2006, Murphy was featured on a United States postage stamp, one of a block of six featuring prominent diplomats.

<text>James Edward Murphy Jr. (November 20, 1891 – March 9, 1965) was a self-taught American cartoonist who is best known for his long-run family comic strip, &quot;Toots and Casper&quot;. His earliest strips, signed J.E. Murphy, had a crude awkward look, but as his cartooning improved, his full signature of Jimmy Murphy appeared.

Born in Chicago, Murphy grew up in Omaha, Nebraska. When he was 15 he began selling political cartoons to the local newspapers, including the &quot;Omaha Examiner&quot;. He briefly attended Creighton University in Omaha, but he left home in 1910, spending the next eight years drawing political cartoons for the &quot;Inland Herald&quot; (Spokane, Washington), the &quot;Oregon Journal&quot; (Portland, Oregon) and the &quot;San Francisco Call &amp; Post&quot;.

==&quot;Doc Attaboy&quot;==
In the summer of 1918, William Randolph Hearst beckoned, and Murphy arrived in New York for a job with Hearst&#x27;s &quot;New York Journal&quot; and the &quot;New York American&quot;, where he decided to try a comic strip. For the &quot;New York American&quot; Murphy created &quot;Doc Attaboy&quot;, a strip about a middle-aged doctor more concerned with writing the bills instead of curing his patients. That short-lived strip continued until December 1918.

==&quot;Toots and Casper&quot;==
The same month he dropped &quot;Doc Attaboy&quot;, he began &quot;Toots and Casper&quot; for the &quot;American&quot;, using his wife, Matilda Katherine &quot;Crane&quot; Murphy, as the model for Toots. The strip was picked up by King Features Syndicate in 1919, and by 1925, it was being carried in numerous newspapers. He left New York and moved to California, living for decades in Beverly Hills. His hobbies of motoring and golf often interfered with his deadlines, and his business records from the 1930s revealed that he often was so late that he shipped strips east by air express. The daily &quot;Toots and Casper&quot; ran until 1951, with the Sunday strip continuing until 1956.

==&quot;It&#x27;s Papa Who Pays!&quot;==

Beginning in 1926, he drew another Sunday comic strip, &quot;It&#x27;s Papa Who Pays!&quot;, which ran above &quot;Toots and Casper&quot; as a topper until 1956. &quot;Toots and Casper&quot; remained a popular favorite with newspaper readers for decades. Between 1932 and 1941, he began including collectible stamps and paper dolls in his Sunday page. These features were so popular they were subsequently imitated by other cartoonists.

==&quot;Eat Right to Work and Win&quot;==
In 1942, Murphy joined other King Features cartoonists (Carl Anderson, Lee Falk and Ray Moore, George McManus, Alex Raymond, Otto Soglow, Russ Westover and Chic Young) in donating art for a World War II booklet on nutrition, &quot;Eat Right to Work and Win&quot;, published in Toronto by Swift Canadian Co. Ltd. The booklet was created through several contributors, the National Nutrition Program, Office of Defense Health and Welfare Services, King Features and the Office of Civilian Defense.

==Licensing==
Murphy profited from the licensing and merchandising of his creation. &quot;Toots and Casper&quot; items ran the gamut from dolls, books and pins to comic books and bisque nodders.

Murphy had a circulatory ailment, and between 1950 and 1955, he endured three major abdominal operations. His illness near the end of the comic strip&#x27;s run prompted the hiring of ghost artists and the recycling of earlier strips (with new dialogue). He died in Beverly Hills, California in 1965.

<text>Finnish Americans (, ) comprise Americans with ancestral roots in Finland, or Finnish people who immigrated to and reside in the United States. The Finnish-American population is around 650,000. Many Finnish people historically immigrated to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and the Iron Range of northern Minnesota to work in the mining industry; much of the population in these regions is of Finnish descent.

==History==

Some Finns, like the ancestors of John Morton, came to the Swedish colony of New Sweden, located in Delaware in the mid-17th century. In Russian America, Finns came to Sitka (when it was still called New Archangel) as migrant workers. Arvid Adolf Etholén was the first Finnish governor of Russian America, and the Lutheran Church was built for Finns.
Finns started coming to the United States in large numbers in the late 19th century, and this movement continued until the mid-20th century. However, there were some Finns in the United States before this; they were instrumental in the development of the New Sweden colony on the Delaware River, later absorbed into New Netherland. Many townships were established by Finnish Americans, including Herman, located in Baraga County, Michigan. The town is named for Herman Keranen, of Puolanka, Finland.

A significant number of Finnish immigrants also settled in northern Minnesota, especially in the Arrowhead Region, along with portions of Aitkin, Crow Wing, and Carlton counties, often working in the region&#x27;s iron mines. A number of the Finns fleeing the Russification efforts in their native country also immigrated to many of the mill-towns of New England, where they became known for their woodworking skills.

=== First migrants (1640–1870) ===
The first immigrants to North America arrived at the New Sweden colony by the lower Delaware River in 1640. Finland was an integrated part of the Kingdom of Sweden at the time, and a Swedish colony in the New World thus had subjects from Finland as well. In two years&#x27; time, the number of Finns in the settlement had grown to fifty, and was increasing. New Sweden changed hands and came under Dutch control in 1655 and the Finnish community, while still small, was growing.

Among the Finnish settlers of New Sweden was Martti Marttinen, who came to North America in 1654 and changed his name to Morton. John Morton, the politician who signed the U.S. Declaration of Independence on behalf of Pennsylvania in 1776, was his great-grandson.

Migration to North America from Finland continued throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, but it was very sporadic in nature and only a few individuals and groups dared make the move. This was largely due to the long distance between Europe and America, and the difficulties associated with crossing it. However, as the Industrial Revolution began with the turn of the 19th century, bringing with it such technological innovations as railroads and steam ships, these obstacles slowly began to disappear.

While the rest of Europe was industrializing, Finland, by now a Grand Duchy of the Russian Empire, was to a great extent excluded from the revolutionary process. The society was largely agrarian, and unemployment was rising, thanks to population growth and the fact that there was now little land left to cultivate in the country. America, on the other hand, possessed abundant natural resources but lacked a workforce.

Rural life in Finland during the 1860s seemed doomed to remain laborious, stunted, and forever at the mercy of unpredictable weather. In 1867, a severe crop failure in Finland drove masses of Finns, especially from rural Ostrobothnia, to migrate into Norway, from where they later moved to the United States and Canada.

==== Religion ====
The Laestadian Finns longed for a rural way of life and religious toleration which they believed they would find in America. Thus, a group of Laestadian preachers and their followers immigrated to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, bringing their faith with them. In 1873 the Finnish Laestadians started their own congregation at Calumet, Michigan. By 1906 the Laestadian or Apostolic Lutheran movement in America had 68 churches and a communicant body of over 8,000. The denomination was a significant minority within the Finnish Lutheran community in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Most Finnish immigrants at the time joined the Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, which eventually became part of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and remains in Calumet, Michigan, alongside various Apostolic (Laestadian) Lutheran churches.

===The Great Migration (1870–1930)===
The years between 1870 and 1930 are sometimes referred to as the Great Migration of Finns to North America. In the 1870s, there were only 3,000 migrants from Finland, but their number rapidly grew thereafter. New migrants often sent letters home, describing their life in the New World, and this encouraged more and more people to leave and try their luck in America. Rumours began of the acres of land that could be cleared into vast productive fields, and the opportunity to earn &quot;a barrel of American dollars&quot; in mines, factories, and railroads.

There were also professional recruiters, or agents, employed by mining and shipping companies, who encouraged Finns to move to the United States. More than 90% of the Finnish immigrants lived in urban centers. This recruitment activity was frowned upon by the authorities of the Grand Duchy, and it was mostly done in secret. It was eventually brought to an end in the late 1880s by legislation in the United States, but the decade still saw a 12-fold increase in the number of Finnish migrants compared to the previous decade, as 36,000 Finns left their home country for North America.

The movement was strengthened even further in 1899, as the Russian government started an aggressive, coordinated campaign for the Russification of Finland. Many Finns chose to escape the repression by migrating to the New World, and, during the 1900s, there were 150,000 new migrants.

Most Finns who left for America came from the impoverished rural regions of Ostrobothnia. Other prominent points of departure were Northern Savonia and the Torne Valley. Many of the emigrants left by ship from the port town of Hanko. Judging from municipalities of origin and later linguistic statistics, it is estimated that about 20-22% of all Finnish emigrants from 1893 to 1929 were Finland Swedes of which two thirds came from the Swedish-speaking coastal parts of Ostrobothnia, and also many from the Åland Islands which had a high share of emigrants relative to population. This would mean an over-representation of Swedish speakers emigrating from Finland at the time.

In the years surrounding the turn of the 20th century, settlement was focused around three specific regions:
* Several pockets of Finnish settlement appeared in New England. New York City and Boston, Massachusetts were the prime destinations for scores of skilled and general laborers. Cities such as Fitchburg, Massachusetts, Worcester, Massachusetts, and Monessen, Pennsylvania attracted thousands of Finns to settle in both urban and rural settings. From about 1910–30, Gloucester, Massachusetts had a thriving community of some 3,000 Finnish granite quarry workers.
* In the Upper Midwest, a similar pattern rapidly took shape. Due to the region&#x27;s similar geographic and climatic features to Finland, the heaviest levels of Finnish settlement were seen in an area known as the &quot;Finn Hook&quot;, which includes northeastern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, where Finns were heavily invested in mining and agriculture. At the same time, because of the connections between these sectors and Great Lakes shipping, another area of Finnish settlement formed in northeastern Ohio, with its core located in the port city of Ashtabula and the nearby towns of Conneaut, Painesville and Fairport Harbor. Today, the region is known as having the highest population of Americans of Finnish ancestry of any region in the United States; in the northwestern half of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan they make up the majority of the population.
* In addition, a number of rural and urban locations in the Northwestern United States contained a number of Finnish-settled areas. Cities such as Aberdeen, Washington and Astoria, Oregon were known for being prime destinations for Finnish immigrants.

The immigration of Finns gave birth to a strong Finnish-American culture, especially in cities such as Duluth and Ashtabula, Ohio. Many villages were named after places in Finland (such as Toivola, Minnesota, Savo, South Dakota, and Oulu, Wisconsin).

The Finnish exodus took place after most of the available farmland in the United States was already taken and Canada&#x27;s was largely still available. While many immigrants pursued farming, others found employment in mining, construction, and the forest industry, while women usually worked as maids. In the case of the Finnish-American enclave in the Finger Lakes region south of Ithaca, New York early in the 20th century, Finns left urban jobs in order to acquire farms that had been sold by their previous owners.

The migration continued well into the 20th century, until U.S. authorities set up a quota of 529 Finnish immigrants per year in 1929. Initially, this led to an increase in Finnish immigration to Canada. But as social and economic conditions in Finland improved significantly during this era, overall immigration decreased by the middle of the century.

The American revolutionary James P. Cannon noted that a considerable part of these immigrants tended towards the radical left in politics: &quot;Under the impact of the Russian Revolution the foreign-born socialist movement grew by leaps and bounds. The foreign-born were organized in language federations, practically autonomous bodies affiliated with the Socialist Party. [Among others] there were about 12 thousand Finns, organized in their own federation&quot;.

=== Return ===
Most Finnish migrants had planned to stay only for a few years in North America, and then return to their native land once they had become rich. However, only about twenty percent of the migrants returned to Finland. Those who did, managed to import new ideas and technologies into Finland and put them into use there.

Approximately ten thousand Finns returned from the New World, not to Finland but to the Soviet Union, in the 1920s and the 1930s to &quot;build socialism&quot; in the Karelian ASSR. This took place mainly for ideological reasons and was strongly supported by the political elite of the USSR.

==Demographic concentrations==
Today, the greatest concentration of Finnish Americans is in Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula, where they form 16% of the population, and are the largest ancestral group in the peninsula&#x27;s western counties. Hancock, one city of Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula, could be considered a kind of &quot;cultural capital&quot; of the Finnish Americans. &quot;Finland Calling&quot;, a weekly Finnish cultural television program hosted by Carl Pellonpaa, was broadcast on WLUC-TV in Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula. In March 2015 the program&#x27;s final episode aired, ending 53 years of weekly broadcasts. Stanton Township, Michigan, is the place in the U.S. with the largest proportion of people with Finnish ancestry, at 47%. The median Finnish-American household income is $70,045.

Finnish Americans by metropolitan statistical area in 2019:
#Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, MN-WI MSA 49,006 (1.33%)

==Notable people==

===Eero Saarinen===
Architect and product designer Eero Saarinen immigrated to the United States in 1923 when he was thirteen years of age and grew up in Michigan. His father was architect Eliel Saarinen, the first president of the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. He studied architecture at the Cranbrook Academy of Art and later the Yale University and graduated in 1934. After touring Europe and Africa for a couple of years he returned to the States and became a citizen in 1940. During the Second World War Saarinen worked for Office of Strategic Services (OSS) which later became the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Saarinen is famous for his furniture and architectural designs. His designs include the Gateway Arch at the Gateway Arch National Park in St. Louis, Missouri, the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan, the TWA Flight Center at John F. Kennedy International Airport, and the main terminal of Dulles International Airport near Washington, D.C. Eero&#x27;s son, Eric Saarinen, is a cinematographer and film director, who has photographed and cinematographed several features, including &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot;, &quot;Lost in America&quot;, and &quot;Exploratorium&quot;.

===Other notable individuals===
Notable Americans of some Finnish descent also include several film stars such as actresses Anna Easteden, Christine Lahti, Marian Nixon, Maila Nurmi, Pamela Anderson, Leslie Mann and Jessica Lange, actors Albert Salmi, Matt Damon, Richard Davalos and George Gaynes, and director David Lynch. Other notable individuals are author Jean M. Auel, historian Max Dimont (born in Finland of Russian Jewish parentage), cook and cookbook author Beatrice Ojakangas, politician Emil Hurja, labor activist T-Bone Slim, U.S. Communist Party leader Gus Hall (originally Arvo Kustaa Halberg), Finnish-Kiowa-Comanche U.S. Attorney Arvo Mikkanen, mathematician Lars Ahlfors, musicians Dave Mustaine, Jaco Pastorius, Einar Aaron Swan, Jorma Kaukonen and Mark Hoppus, singer-songwriter Amelia Presley, science fiction author Hannu Rajaniemi, computer scientists Linus Torvalds and Alfred Aho, former Google executive and CEO of Yahoo Marissa Mayer, co-founder of Apple Mike Markkula, chairman and CEO of General Motors Mary Barra, astronaut Timothy L. Kopra, special forces officer Larry Thorne, ice hockey player Matt Niskanen and serial killer Aileen Wuornos. Porn actress Puma Swede is of Finnish descent although she was born in Sweden.

==Culture==
FinnFest USA is an annual festival held to celebrate Finnish heritage and culture in the United States. Organized by a non-profit organization of the same name, FinnFest USA has been held in a different location each year since 1983, often incorporating regional cultural elements of the local site into the year&#x27;s event. To date there have also been three FinnGrandFests, a collaboration between Finnish-Americans and Finnish-Canadians: 2000 (Toronto, Ontario), 2005 (Marquette, Michigan) and 2010 (Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario).

Finnish American culture is also celebrated at Finlandia University in Hancock, Michigan, formerly Suomi College, which has been the only Finnish American institution of higher learning in the United States since the closing of Work People&#x27;s College in Duluth, Minnesota in 1941. Finlandia was established by the Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America and is now affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. In 2023, Finlandia University announced that it would be permanently closing following the completion of spring semester classes. Finlandia Foundation National, based in Pasedena, CA is working with the Finnish American Heritage Center to preserve their archives and continue the Finnish American Reporter newspaper.

Salolampi Finnish Language Village is a Finnish language immersion camp in Bemidji, Minnesota. Founded in 1978, it is a member of the Concordia Language Villages, and celebrates Finnish and Finnish-American heritage, culture, and language.

==Politics==
Finnish-Americans historically favored Democratic Party candidates, owing to their frequent employment in mining and other blue-collar industries. This has changed in recent decades as many of the rural regions in which they are numerous have swung to the Republican Party. In 2010, the three congressional districts with the highest concentrations of Finnish Americans (Michigan 1st, Wisconsin 7th, and Minnesota 8th), all adjacent to Lake Superior, flipped from Democratic to Republican control.

<text>Franklin David Murphy (January 29, 1916 – June 16, 1994) was an American administrator, educator, and medical doctor. During his life, he served as Chancellor of the University of Kansas (KU) and Chancellor of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

==Biography==
===Early life===
Murphy was born in Kansas City, Missouri in 1916 where he attended the Pembroke-Country Day School. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Kansas in 1936, and then earned his Doctor of Medicine from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in 1941. After graduation, he served in the United States Army Medical Corps during World War II, where he became a captain. Afterward, he returned to Kansas City to practice cardiology, and began teaching at the University of Kansas School of Medicine in Kansas City, Kansas.

===Career===
Within a few years of beginning his professorship at the University of Kansas, he became dean of the medical school and eventually was chosen by the Kansas Board of Regents to be chancellor of the entire university. Because of his successes at KU, UCLA asked him to become their chancellor. In 1960, when his relationship with Kansas Governor George Docking was no longer tolerable, he accepted the position and relocated to Los Angeles, California. There, he was also appointed to be a professor of medical history.

At UCLA, he dealt with the turbulence of student movements in the 1960s in a progressive manner, and successfully kept the university stable. Moreover, he worked to establish the university as a first-rate institution in its own right, and not simply a branch of the vast University of California system. He expanded the UCLA library system, enlarged the School of Medicine&#x27;s basic science programs, convinced the regents of the University of California to purchase and maintain a cyclotron for the school, and founded the Jules Stein Eye Institute and a museum now known as the Fowler Museum at UCLA. In 1968, he resigned his position as chancellor in order to become Chairman and CEO of the Times Mirror Company, remaining in Los Angeles. He continued in this position until 1980, and remained a director of the company until he retired in 1986.

===Personal life===
After his retirement, he became a major philanthropist in Los Angeles for the rest of his life. He served on many philanthropic boards, including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Los Angeles Music Center, raising funds and public awareness of the institutions.

Murphy died in Los Angeles in 1994.

==Legacy==
The Franklin D. Murphy Sculpture Garden at UCLA, which he founded, still remains a world-famous permanent sculpture exhibition; Murphy Hall, which houses UCLA administration and admissions, has also been named in his honor. At the University of Kansas, both Murphy Hall and the Murphy Art and Architecture Library are named in his honor.

<text>Charles Francis &quot;Silent Charlie&quot; Murphy (June 20, 1858 – April 25, 1924), also known as Boss Murphy, was an American political figure. He was also the longest-serving head of New York City&#x27;s Tammany Hall, a position he served from 1902 to 1924. Murphy was responsible for transforming Tammany Hall&#x27;s image from one of corruption to respectability as well as extending Tammany Hall&#x27;s political influence to the national level. Murphy was responsible for the election of three mayors of New York City, three governors of New York State, and two U.S. senators, even though he was never listed as a leader of Tammany Hall.

==Early life==
Murphy was the son of Irish immigrants Dennis Murphy and Mary Pendergrass, born in the Gashouse District, which got its name from its proximity to Consolidated Gas Company storage tanks. He was educated in the public and parochial schools but quit school at 14 and found a job at Roaches Shipyard and eventually as a streetcar driver for the Crosstown Blue Lines Horsecar Co. After saving $500 from the jobs that he had worked, Murphy purchased a saloon in 1878, which he named Charlie&#x27;s Place. Charlie&#x27;s Place became a local gathering place for local dock and Consolidated Gas Company workers but did not serve women because Murphy believed that most women who frequented bars were prostitutes. The second floor of the Saloon served as the Sylvan Social Club, composed of males aged 15 to 20. With the social club, Murphy formed a baseball team, and with all three groups, Murphy arose as a local political figure.

==Political career==
Murphy&#x27;s friend and benefactor, Edward Hagan, failed to achieve the Tammany Hall nomination for district assemblyman in 1883, which led Hagan to attempt an independent campaign. Murphy managed Hagan&#x27;s independent campaign, leading to Hagan&#x27;s victory. Murphy was also prominent in Francis Spinola&#x27;s successful campaign for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1885. The same year, one of Murphy&#x27;s saloons became the headquarters for the Anawanda Club, which was the local Tammany Hall club; eventually, Murphy joined Tammany Hall&#x27;s executive committee. Murphy was appointed to be the Commissioner of Docks in 1897. During this period, he organized the New York Contracting and Trucking Company, which leased dock space. That became a successful business, mostly because of &quot;honest graft&quot; in business with the city, and Murphy gained further prominence in Tammany Hall. In 1902, Murphy married widow Margaret J. Graham; also that year, the Tammany Hall boss, Richard Croker, was forced out of office because of public accusations of corruption. The accusations of corruption included stealing from the municipal treasury, which never occurred. Murphy quickly replaced Croker as boss of Tammany Hall. Murphy owned shares of the American Ice Company during the Ice Trust Scandal, but his reputation was not tarnished.

In contrast to Croker, the taciturn and teetotaling Murphy brought an air of respectability to Tammany Hall. He furthered that end by promoting a new crop of Tammany politicians, such as Senator James J. Walker, Rockland County Chairman James Farley, and Alderman Alfred E. Smith, who would move the political machine away from the methods of Boss Tweed and toward a Progressive Era-a style that rewarded the loyalty of the poor with reforms like factory safety and child labor laws. Although initially opposed to progressive legislation, Murphy realized that he could support reforms that pleased his constituency but which did not undermine Tammany&#x27;s power. Because of his stance, he is credited with transforming Tammany into a political organization capable of drawing the votes of the ever-growing numbers of new immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe, which kept Tammany in power until the early 1930s.

===New York Contracting and Trucking===
Croker made money through &quot;honest graft.&quot; New York Contracting and Trucking was awarded a $6 million contract in 1904 to build rail lines in the Bronx for the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad. An executive at the railroad said the contract was awarded to avoid friction with Tammany Hall. In response to the contract, the New York State Legislature amended the city&#x27;s charter so that franchise-awarding power was removed from the city board of aldermen and given to the Board of Estimate and Apportionment, which existed until 1989. By 1905, New York Contracting and Trucking had collected over $15 million in city contracts.

===Louis N. Hartog business===
While the United States was at war in 1918, Murphy was receiving income from a firm owned by the businessman Louis N. Hartog in exchange for Murphy&#x27;s arranging the Corn Products Refining Company to sell Hartog&#x27;s firm glucose. Hartog would then use the glucose to manufacture malt dextrin, an ingredient in beer. After investing $175,000 in Hartog&#x27;s firm, Murphy was gaining $5,000 a day from the arrangement. In light of the ongoing war, the unfavorable light it would direct towards Tammany, and the amount of money Murphy received, which he considered too much, Murphy attempted to withdraw from the business. Hartog sued Murphy in response, but Murphy countersued and the case was settled.

==Political influence==
Murphy guided George B. McClellan Jr. to the New York City mayoralty in 1903 over incumbent Seth Low. McClellan was reluctant to reward Murphy with patronage jobs, but Murphy went along with McClellan&#x27;s decisions. In the 1905 mayoral election, Murphy again guided McClellan to victory, this time over William Randolph Hearst. It was notable since Hearst was then known for ties to the progressive movement and his organization, the Municipal Ownership League, whose goal was the promotion of the public ownership of utilities and transit lines to bring about lower rates and fares. Hearst&#x27;s newspapers also attacked McClellan&#x27;s defense of privately owned subways and Murphy&#x27;s ties to the New York Contracting and Trucking company. After Hearst lost the mayoral election contest, Murphy would try to appease Hearst by appearing to back him for the governorship in 1906, a race Hearst lost. In his second term, McClellan did not react kindly to Murphy&#x27;s friendliness with Hearst, and during the city&#x27;s $100 million drinking water infrastructure expansion into the Catskill Mountains, McClellan did not allow Tammany access to the newly created jobs.

For the 1909 city mayoral election, Murphy backed New York State Supreme Court Justice William Jay Gaynor. By supporting Gaynor, Murphy tried to unite the Democrats in Manhattan under Tammany with the Democrats in Brooklyn under Patrick McCarren. As for uniting with the city&#x27;s other boroughs, the Bronx was under the control of Murphy&#x27;s friend Louis Haffen, and Queens and Staten Island did not have large populations. Gaynor won the election against Hearst and, like McClellan, did not act kindly towards Murphy&#x27;s Tammany. Gaynor cut the city&#x27;s payroll and eliminated 400 political posts within the first few months of office. Nine months into his term, a disgruntled Docks Department employee attempted to assassinate Gaynor, who was traveling on an oceanic steamship.

Murphy successfully guided John Alden Dix to the governorship in 1910. To beat Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s candidate in 1912, Oscar S. Straus, whom Murphy expected to garner many of the Jewish votes that normally would have gone to Tammany candidates, Murphy backed US Representative William Sulzer, a Tammany politician in a heavily-Jewish district. Sulzer would win the election, but Murphy would later regret his decision after the vain Sulzer started to launch investigations against Tammany contractors. Sulzer also resisted Murphy&#x27;s choice for patronage positions. Sulzer would become the subject of a different investigation and, after failing to testify, gained the distinction of becoming the only governor in New York State to be successfully impeached.

Murphy would make his boldest move yet in 1912 in striking a secret deal to swing the Democratic Party convention in Baltimore to New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson. &quot;Five long days of deadlock, and forty-two ballots, had failed to give either of the two leading candidates, Wilson and Champ Clark, the two-thirds majority each needed to win the nomination. Then, on the forty-third ballot, Illinois moved, casting all fifty-eight of her votes for Wilson. The third-place candidate, Oscar Underwood, released his delegates, as did Champ Clark. The roll call for the forty-sixth ballot got underway as mid-afternoon approached. Charles F. Murphy stood to announce that his state, the largest in the Union, had changed sides: &#x27;New York casts 90 votes for Woodrow Wilson,&#x27; he said and got the biggest cheer of the roll call. On Champ Clark&#x27;s suggestion, the convention acclaimed Woodrow Wilson unanimously.&quot;

Following the Triangle Shirtwaist Company fire on March 25, 1911, attention focused on the factories&#x27; working conditions. With the assistance of his protégés Robert F. Wagner and Alfred E. Smith, 1913 became a significant year for Tammany Hall in the promotion of progressive reforms. In the city, workplace health regulations were improved, fire alarms were mandated, working hours were reduced for women, a pension system for widowers was introduced, and requirements for insurance were made stricter. At the state level, a referendum on women&#x27;s suffrage was scheduled and the Public Utility Commission was provided broader powers. In Democratic Party circles, 1914 was a big year since Murphy supported a direct primary system for nomination to all state offices.

Murphy did not want to entertain the idea of Hearst as the Democratic mayor in 1917, but to avoid appearing as being against Hearst&#x27;s nomination, Murphy approached the Brooklyn Democratic machine&#x27;s John F. Hylan, who was also a friend of Hearst, to see if Hylan would run. The Brooklyn Democratic boss, John McCooey, according to a story, made a show of forcing Hylan on Murphy as the Democratic nominee and Murphy reluctantly accepted. Hearst withdrew from the race, and the Democrats won the mayoral election.

Murphy guided Smith to victory in the 1918 governor&#x27;s election.

Murphy was a delegate at the 1920 Democratic National Convention, and it was in part by his influence that James M. Cox secured the nomination.

During his reign, Murphy brought Tammany Hall&#x27;s political influence to the national level. In 1924, he and the Democratic Party were expected to nominate Smith for president (before his death, Murphy served as the manager of Smith&#x27;s campaign effort). Murphy also influenced the elections of three New York City mayors, three New York State governors, and the impeachment of Governor William Sulzer. Governor Sulzer was propelled into office by Tammany Hall, but during his tenure, Sulzer distanced himself from Tammany politics, refused to follow its orders, and supported general primaries. That angered both Tammany Hall and its boss, Murphy; with his help, the State Assembly voted to impeach Sulzer on counts of perjury and fraud. Murphy&#x27;s involvement in the impeachment of a former Tammany member demonstrates his tenacity and fierceness as a political figure. Murphy once said, &quot;It is the fate of political leaders to be reviled. If one is too thin-skinned to stand it he should never take the job. History shows the better and more successful the organization and the leader the more bitter the attacks.&quot;

Edward J. Flynn, a protege of Murphy who became the boss in the Bronx, said Murphy always advised that politicians should have nothing to do with gambling or prostitution and steer clear of involvement with the police department or the school system.

==Death==
Murphy died suddenly of what &quot;the New York Times&quot; termed &quot;acute indigestion,&quot; which affected his heart, on April 25, 1924, at his home in New York City. A Roman Catholic, he was given a funeral service at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral and was buried at Calvary Cemetery in New York.

==In popular culture==
In the 1941 film &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, screenwriters Herman J. Mankiewicz and Orson Welles based the character of political boss Jim Gettys on Charles F. Murphy. William Randolph Hearst and Murphy were political allies in 1902 when Hearst was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, but the two fell out in 1905 when Hearst ran for mayor of New York City. Hearst was denied the election by a slim margin due to electoral fraud perpetrated by Murphy&#x27;s organization, and his newspapers retaliated. A historic cartoon of Murphy in convict stripes appeared November 10, 1905, three days after the vote. The caption read, &quot;Look out, Murphy! It&#x27;s a Short Lockstep from Delmonico&#x27;s to Sing Sing ... Every honest voter in New York wants to see you in this costume.&quot;

In &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, Boss Jim Gettys admonishes Kane for printing a cartoon showing him in prison stripes:

If I owned a newspaper and if I didn&#x27;t like the way somebody else was doing things—some politician, say—I&#x27;d fight them with everything I had. Only I wouldn&#x27;t show him in a convict suit with stripes—so his children could see the picture in the paper. Or his mother.

As he pursues Gettys down the stairs, Kane threatens to send him to Sing Sing.

<doc id="917248" wikidata="Q1051645" url="?curid=917248" title="Canadian International Development Agency">
<text>The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA; in French: &quot;Agence canadienne de développement international&quot;; &quot;ACDI&quot;) was a federal Canadian organization that administered foreign aid programs in developing countries. The agency was merged into the Department of Foreign Affairs in 2013 by the federal government under Prime Minister Stephen Harper.

== History ==
CIDA was formed in 1968 by the Canadian government under Lester B. Pearson. CIDA reported to the Parliament of Canada through the Minister for International Cooperation. Its mandate was to &quot;support sustainable development in developing countries in order to reduce poverty and contribute to a more secure, equitable, and prosperous world.&quot; CIDA had its headquarters at 200 Promenade du Portage in Gatineau, Quebec.

CIDA funding was the subject of intense debate, and the Conservative government made major revisions to the funding process, including reductions to NGOs described as supporting &quot;left-leaning causes&quot;, such as Montreal-based Alternatives.

=== Demise ===
In March 2013, the Conservative government announced that CIDA would be folded into the Department of Foreign Affairs, and the organizations renamed as the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development, later renamed as Global Affairs Canada. Critics said the merger would give insufficient attention to fighting poverty, but the Conservative government, and later the Liberal government that also kept CIDA programs under the same department, said the merger would lead to a more coherent international agenda. An internal report by the agency said that it would take up to 10 years for ex-CIDA employees to get used to the merger.

==Mandate==
#Social development
#:CIDA has supported programs relating directly to the treatment of STDs in developing countries. It also cites basic education and child protection as priorities in the social development of countries that it aids.
#Economic well-being
#:Promoted and funded Microfinance and Education for sustainable development programs.
#Environmental sustainability
#:With a focus upon issues such as climate change, land degradation, and water supply, CIDA sought to help developing nations maintain healthy ecosystems. CIDA was a partner in the Canada Iraq Marshlands Initiative. For example, CIDA was a major donor to the International LUBILOSA Programme: which developed a biological pesticide for locust control, in support of small-holder farmers in the Sahel.
#Governance
#:CIDA strove for human rights, democracy, and good governance. The agency also supported gender equality.

<doc id="917249" wikidata="Q3046478" url="?curid=917249" title="Manuel Murillo Toro">
<text>Manuel Murillo Toro (January 1, 1816–December 26, 1880) was a Colombian statesman who served as President of the United States of Colombia (present day Colombia) on two occasions, first from 1864 to 1866, and again between 1872 and 1874.

== Biographic data ==

Murillo was born in the town of Chaparral, Tolima on January 1, 1816. He received a law degree from the University of Bogotá. He died in Bogotá, Cundinamarca, on December 26, 1880.

== Early career ==
His articles in the daily press attracted attention due to their energetic opposition to the Conservative government of José Ignacio de Márquez from 1837 to 1840. After the revolution of the latter year he became editor of the &quot;Gaceta Mercantil de Santa Marta&quot;, which exercised a great influence, and paved the way for the triumph of the Partido Liberal Colombiano in the elections of 1849. He was elected to the chamber of representatives, and soon attained a reputation for eloquence. He was called to serve as Secretary of State and then Secretary of the Treasury during the administration of President José Hilario López.

As Secretary of the Treasury, he established liberty of industry and the decentralization of the provincial revenues, and thus prepared the way for the future federal institutions. At the same time, he defended the administration in the press, and initiated the greater part of the progressive reforms that were established by it, such as the abolition of slavery, abolition of the death penalty for political crimes and abolition of several fiscal monopolies. He advocated liberty of the press, and the reform of the civil code.

In 1852 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the vice presidency of the Republic. When the Liberal party lost power he returned to journalism, and, except during the short time that he was state executive for Santander, he sustained an energetic opposition to the Conservative government. When President Mariano Ospina Rodríguez was overthrown, and the federation proclaimed by the constituent convention of Rio Negro, 4 February 1863, Murillo was appointed minister to Europe, and afterward to the United States.

== First Presidency ==

Murillo ran for President of Colombia in the general election of 1864 representing the Partido Liberal Colombiano. The Colombian Conservative Party abstained from participating in this election. Murillo had two other liberal opponents, Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera and Santos Gutiérrez. Murillo won the election and was elected president for the 1864-1866 presidential term. During his administration, noted for its conciliatory spirit, the first telegraph lines were established.

After his term as president was over, he was elected to the federal senate. For his opposition to some arbitrary measures of President Mosquera he was arrested with others, by order of Mosquera, when the congress was dissolved in March 1867. After the deposition of Mosquera, 25 May 1867, Murillo was a member of the legislature of Cundinamarca, and afterward for a short time again minister to the United States and judge of the supreme court. In all these posts, he was notable for his consistent adherence to the doctrines that he had proclaimed as a journalist and legislator.

== Second Presidency ==

Murillo ran a second time for President of Colombia in the general election of 1872, representing the Colombian Liberal Party. He was aided in part by the Conservative party. Murillo had two other opponents, Manuel Mallarino and Julián Trujillo Largacha. Murillo won the election and was elected president for the 1872-1874 presidential term. In winning this election, Murillo became the first civilian to be elected President of Colombia for a second time.

== Later career ==

His successor to the Presidency, Santiago Pérez de Manosalbas, although belonging to the opposite party, sent him as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Venezuela to arrange the pending question of boundaries according to the proposal of Guzman Blanco. As Murillo controverted with great ability on all the points that were brought up by the Venezuelan commissioner, no treaty could be agreed on. Murillo was again elected senator in 1878, and occupied his seat in the next session of congress, but sickness prevented him from attending in 1880, and he died in the same year.

== Major accomplishments ==

Murillo sponsored, supported and enacted legislation to bring into law the rights of freedom of religion, freedom of assembly and freedom of the press. He also established the National Press and Telegraph Institute and the National Cartography Institute.

<doc id="917251" wikidata="Q1283673" url="?curid=917251" title="Steve Williams (rower)">
<text>Stephen David Williams (born 15 April 1976 in Leamington Spa) is an English rower and double Olympic champion. In April and May 2011, Williams walked to the North Pole and achieved the summit of Mount Everest.

== Education ==
Williams was educated at Monkton Combe School, Bath, where he began rowing aged 13. He attended Oxford Brookes University where he studied History and Town planning.

== International career ==
Williams made his full international debut in 1998 at the age of 22. He partnered Fred Scarlett in the coxless pair, and came sixth in his first world championships. A year later he partnered Simon Dennis in the same event, this time finishing fifth. In 2000 both Scarlett and Dennis won seats in the GB Eight for the Olympics in Sydney but Williams just missed out, and instead was a member of the Coxed Four which won a gold medal at the World Championships in Zagreb for non-Olympic events.
In 2001 he was again world champion, this time in the Coxless Four, and won the silver medal in the same discipline in both 2002 and 2003.

With Matthew Pinsent, James Cracknell and Ed Coode, Williams won Olympic gold at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens in the men&#x27;s coxless four.

Williams was the only member of the 2004 Olympic crew to continue racing in the 2005 season, joining Alex Partridge, Pete Reed and Andrew Triggs Hodge in the coxless four, again winning the World Championship that year and in 2006, before coming in fourth at the 2007 world championships. In 2008, Partridge was replaced in the four by Cambridge Blue Tom James, and - despite an injury-torn season - the quartet became Olympic Champions, defeating the Australian boat by 1.28s on the day dubbed &#x27;Super Saturday&#x27; by the media owing to the large GB medal haul. The Australians led for much of the race before a push by the British boat overhauled them in the last 400 m.

== Current occupation ==
Williams was appointed as a fitness consultant to Andy Liddell for Ipswich Town Football Club on 3 July 2012.

Having been appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2005 New Year Honours, Williams was promoted to Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2009 New Year Honours.

On 22 January 2010 he announced his retirement from rowing. 

He has been welcomed back to Monkton Combe School on several occasions, rowing in a Monkton Bluefriars old boys&#x27; boat at a school regatta.

<text>The Trésor public () is the national administration of the Treasury in France. It is headed by the general directorate of public finances (&quot;Direction générale des finances publiques&quot;) in the Ministry of the Economy, Finance and Industry.

The &quot;Trésor Public&quot; is responsible for:
* the accountancy of the state;
* the control and help in the accountancy of public administrations and local governments;
* the perception of direct taxes such as the income tax (the computation of those taxes is vested in a separate administration).

== History == 
Its origins can be traced back to King of France Philip Augustus (reigned from 1165 to 1223), who transformed France into the most prosperous and powerful country in Europe. His actions brought financial stability to his country. However, the modern Treasury came into being under the leadership of superintendents of finance such as Colbert, and above all with Count Mollien in the 19th century. It accompanied and embodied the emergence of the modern bureaucratic state.

From January 1806 to 1814, under Emperor Napoleon, Mollien was Minister of the Treasury (succeeding Barbé-Marbois after the bankruptcy of the Négociants réunis) and Napoleon&#x27;s principal financial adviser. Mollien set up the &quot;Caisse de service&quot;, responsible for overseeing the movement of funds.

Until the 2012 reform, the Treasury was headed in each department by the Treasurer-Paymaster General (&quot;Trésorier-Payeur Général&quot;), a high-ranking official. In Paris, the function used to be divided into the Paymaster General of the Treasury (&quot;Payeur Général du Trésor&quot;), and the Receiver General of the Finances (&quot;Receveur Général des Finances&quot;). Each region had its own Treasurer-Paymaster General, the one for the &quot;département&quot; of the &quot;région&quot; &quot;préfecture&quot;. However, following the 2012 reform, the system has been greatly simplified, and relevant administrations for taxes (Direction générale des impôts) and public accounts (Direction générale de la comptabilité publique) were merged into the general directorate of public finances (Direction générale de finances publiques). During this process, redundant fiscal and financial functions were consolidated into a single departamental or regional director for public finances (Directeur département ou régional des finances publiques).

The Trésor also runs a certificate authority. In December 2013 it was revealed that it issued fake certificates impersonating Google in order to facilitate spying on French government employees via man-in-the-middle attacks.

The Trésor public is different from the Direction générale du Trésor (or French Treasury), which is the administration in charge of French State&#x27;s debt and cash management (through the Agence France Trésor), and contributes to financial sector and economy financing regulation, economic policy and international economic and financial negotiations.

<doc id="917259" wikidata="Q6390413" url="?curid=917259" title="Kenneth MacKenzie Murchison">
<text>Kenneth MacKenzie Murchison, Jr. (September 29, 1872 – December 15, 1938) was a prominent American Beaux-Arts and Gothic Revival architect.

==Early life==
He was born in Brooklyn, New York City in 1872. Murchison graduated from Columbia University in 1894 and from the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France, in 1900.

==Career==
Two years after graduating from the École des Beaux-Arts, he opened an office in New York where his first major commissions were for railroad stations for the Pennsylvania Railroad company. Among the stations he designed are Hoboken Terminal in New Jersey; the Lackawanna Terminal and the Lehigh Valley Terminal, both in Buffalo, New York; and Baltimore Pennsylvania Station.

In New York, he was well known as one of the founders of the Beaux Arts Balls, elaborate costume parties benefiting architects who had fallen on hard times. He also was a founder of the Mendelsohn Glee Club. At the time of his death, he had started work on a new Dunes Club to replace the one destroyed a few months earlier.

==Personal life==
On April 5, 1902, Murchison married Aurelie de Mauriac. They lived in the Beaux-Arts Apartments, which he designed, at 310 E. 44th St. They were the parents of two daughters:

* Katherine Murchison, who married Hays Browning.
* Aurelie Murchison, who married Edouard de Wardener.

Murchison died suddenly, at 11:45 p.m. on December 15, 1938, while at the Interborough Rapid Transit Company&#x27;s Grand Central–42nd Street station, as &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported.

==Buildings==
He also designed:
* Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Station-Johnstown (Amtrak station)
* Jamaica (LIRR station), Jamaica, New York.

<text>Murad Bey ( 1750 – 22 April 1801) was an Egyptian Mamluk chieftain (Bey), cavalry commander and joint ruler of Egypt with Ibrahim Bey. He is often remembered as being a cruel and extortionate ruler, but an energetic courageous fighter.

The title given to him, &quot;Bey&quot;, denotes an aristocratic status broadly indicative of &quot;Lordship&quot;, subject to the cultural norms of the Ottoman Empire. More specifically, the cultural norms of the Egyptian province in the Ottoman Empire, since Egypt enjoyed varying degrees of autonomy throughout the Ottoman period. 

==Biography==

While many Georgian and foreign historians claim Murad was of Georgian origin and born in Tbilisi, several others believe he was a Circassian. In 1768, he was sold to the (Circassian) Mamluk Abu al-Dhahab, regent of Ottoman Egypt.

After the death of his master in 1775, Murad Bey was in command of the Mamluk army, whereas Ibrahim Bey was in charge of the administrative duties of Egypt. They survived through the persistent Ottoman attempts at overthrowing the Mamluk regime and civil strifes. They served as kaymakams (acting governors) in Egypt on occasion, although they effectively held &quot;de facto&quot; power for decades, even over the appointed Ottoman governor of Egypt.&lt;ref name=&quot;JabartiPhilipp1994-2/93&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JabartiPhilipp1994-2/138&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JabartiPhilipp1994-2/156&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1786, the Ottoman sultan Abdülhamid I sent Kapudan Pasha (grand admiral of the Ottoman Navy) Cezayirli Gazi Hasan Pasha to drive out Ibrahim and Murad Bey.&lt;ref name=&quot;JabartiPhilipp1994-2/181&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Hasan Pasha was fervent and thorough in his efforts and succeeded in the short term, reestablishing direct Ottoman Empire control over Egypt. Ismail Bey was appointed as new Mamluk leader and Shaykh al-Balad (civil governor and de facto ruler). However, in 1791, only five years after their expulsion by Hasan Pasha, the duumvirate returned to Cairo from hiding in southern Egypt and took back &quot;de facto&quot; control.&lt;ref name=&quot;JabartiPhilipp1994-2/317–322, 373&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, Murad Bey served as the amir al-hajj (Commander of the Hajj), a position responsible for securing funds and provisions for the yearly Hajj pilgrimage and protecting it along the desert route to Mecca and Medina in the Hejaz.

Murad commanded the Mamluk cavalry and janissary infantry in the Battle of Shubra Khit on 13 July 1798, but he was defeated by the French army and withdrew from the fight. Eight days later, on 21 July, he commanded the Mamluk cavalry during the Battle of the Pyramids alongside Ibrahim Bey and was defeated by Napoleon. While Ibrahim Bey fled towards the Sinai Peninsula, Murad fled to Cairo and then Upper Egypt. He mounted a brief guerrilla warfare that staved off the armies of Louis Desaix for a year. While pursuing Murad Bey into Upper Egypt, the French discovered the monuments at Dendera, Thebes, Edfu, and Philae.

Murad had reportedly offered money to the French forces to leave Egypt. He offered to ally himself with the British Empire in exchange for allowing them to occupy Alexandria, Damietta, and Rosetta. In 1800, Murad made peace with Jean-Baptiste Kléber. He agreed to garrison Cairo. He was responsible for collecting taxes from Upper Egypt on behalf of the French First Republic. He was part of the French army at the Battle of Heliopolis, commanding his Mamluks on the French right wing. He deserted the French before the battle and did not participate in the fighting. After the French army was defeated at Canopus by a British army under Ralph Abercromby, the French governor of Cairo, Augustin Daniel Belliard, ordered Murad Bey to assist him in defending the capital. Murad set out to assist the governor but died en route of the bubonic plague.

<doc id="917267" wikidata="Q671608" url="?curid=917267" title="Songs in the Key of Springfield">
<text>Songs in the Key of Springfield is a soundtrack/novelty album from &quot;The Simpsons&quot; compiling many of the musical numbers from the series. The album was released in the United States on March 18, 1997, and in the United Kingdom in June 1997. This was the second album released in association with the &quot;Simpsons&quot; television series; however, the previous release, &quot;The Simpsons Sing the Blues&quot;, contained original recordings as opposed to songs featured in episodes of the series.

The album was followed by &quot;The Yellow Album&quot;, a second album of original songs. Hollywood Records released the album on digital and streaming platforms on December 9, 2021.

==Music==
The first track is an extended version of the main title theme listed as being from the episode &quot;Cape Feare&quot;. However, Lisa&#x27;s saxophone solo featured in the album track is different from the solo that was used in that episode. The theme version matching the one on the album (with the same sax solo) that matches the one on the CD was used, complete with the same sax solo, for the episodes &quot;Monty Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot;, &quot;Simpson Safari&quot; and &quot;The Bart Wants What It Wants&quot;, which all aired well after the album&#x27;s release. In addition, syndicated reruns of &quot;Cape Feare&quot; replaced the original opening with a shorter opening without the extended &quot;chorus line&quot; couch gag.

==Cultural reference==
The title is taken from the Stevie Wonder album &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot;. Another FOX TV show, &quot;The X-Files&quot;, had a soundtrack album entitled &quot;Songs in the Key of X&quot;. The Simpsons podcast &quot;Pods in the Key of Springfield&quot; is named after this album.

==Chart performance==
Compared to the previous album released in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; franchise, &quot;The Simpsons Sing the Blues&quot;, the album failed to match the success of their previous record. It managed to peak at number 18 in the United Kingdom, where it would become the last charting album for the franchise in that country.

The album was less successful in the United States, where it peaked at #103 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. However, it was successful on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Kid Audio chart, where it peaked at number one, becoming the first number one on that chart for the franchise.

The album was certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry twice in the UK. On March 19, 1999, on the Warner Records label and again on July 22, 2013, on the Rhino Entertainment label.

<doc id="917268" wikidata="Q1805450" url="?curid=917268" title="Professor of Poetry">
<text>The Professor of Poetry is an academic appointment at the University of Oxford. The chair was created in 1708 by an endowment from the estate of Henry Birkhead. The professorship carries an obligation to deliver an inaugural lecture; give one public lecture each term on a suitable literary subject; offer one additional event each term (which may include poetry readings, workshops, hosted events, etc.); deliver the Creweian Oration at Encaenia every other year; each year, to be one of the judges for the Newdigate Prize, the Jon Stallworthy Prize, the Lord Alfred Douglas Prize and the Chancellor&#x27;s English Essay Prize; every third year, to help judge the English poem on a sacred subject prize; and generally to encourage the art of poetry in the University.

The professor is appointed to a single four-year term. The Professor of Poetry Committee produces a shortlist of applicants to stand for election by members of the University of Oxford&#x27;s Convocation. Convocation consists of members of the faculty (Congregation) both current and retired, and former student members of the university who have been admitted to a degree (other than an honorary degree). In 2010, on-line voting was allowed for the first time. The Professor of Poetry receives a stipend (£25,000 per annum as of 2023) which is increased in line with the annual cost-of-living increases for academic and related staff, plus £40 for each Creweian Oration.

Since 1708, 47 persons have been elected to the position including many prominent poets and academics. Alice Oswald, who was Professor of Poetry from 2019 to 2023, was the first woman to hold this post, although not the first woman elected to it, which was Ruth Padel, who resigned after nine days without fulfilling the obligations of the post. She was succeeded in 2023 by A. E. Stallings. 

The elections typically attract media attention and involve campaigning by proponents of quite diverse candidates. In the past, both practising poets and academic critics have been chosen.

== 2009 election ==
On 16 May 2009, Ruth Padel defeated the Indian poet Arvind Mehrotra to become the first woman elected to the post since its inception in 1708. The Nobel Prize-winning candidate Derek Walcott had withdrawn his candidacy, following what he called a &quot;low and degrading&quot; campaign against him, after &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; and &quot;Cherwell&quot; revealed that around 100 Oxford academics had been sent, anonymously, photocopied pages from &quot;The Lecherous Professor&quot;, a University of Illinois publication on the prevalence of sexual harassment in American universities, describing two such accusations made against Walcott at Harvard University and Boston University. Walcott&#x27;s candidacy had been controversial within the university from the beginning, some counselling against on grounds of Walcott&#x27;s university past, others arguing that his record was immaterial since he would have no contact with students. Newspapers had previously claimed Walcott was the favourite, although Libby Purves suggested that this claim was based on a misunderstanding of the electoral system. Padel criticised the anonymous missives and denied any knowledge of them, though many in the media continued to insinuate her involvement. After her election, two journalists who had previously requested information from Padel regarding voters&#x27; opinions revealed that she had cited to them the source of some people&#x27;s unease about the suitability for appointment of someone with such a university record. Padel stated, &quot;I wish he had not pulled out&quot;, and resigned on 25 May only nine days after her election.

Letters to British newspapers criticised media handling of the election. An open letter to the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; complained of unfair media pursuit of Walcott&#x27;s past, a letter in &quot;The Guardian&quot; complained of unjust denigration of Padel, claiming she was &quot;justly held in high regard&quot; for her poetry and teaching, and a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; claimed that &quot;Oxford has missed out for the worst of reasons&quot;. &quot;One can only speculate why so many male voices were loud in condemning Padel but silent with respect to Walcott. I attended a course taught by Ruth Padel: she was inspirational, involved, enthusiastic and interested in her students. Perhaps it was unwise of her to email journalists but if Walcott&#x27;s past is &#x27;irrelevant to his suitability to fill the post of Professor of Poetry&#x27;, so is Padel&#x27;s &#x27;unwisdom&#x27;. That Walcott removed the decision from the electorate was his own choice. Padel should not have been made to pay for his decision to confront neither his accusers nor his past.&quot; American commentators attributed the series of events to an assumption on the part of academics and writers that a gender war was behind it all, perceiving a &quot;split across the Atlantic - with the Americans, the ones after all working with Walcott over the decades, taking those claims much more seriously&quot;

Some commentators in Britain supported Padel, attributing the smear campaign in the media to misogyny and networking. &quot;The old boys have closed in on her,&quot; the poet Jackie Kay stated. On &quot;Newsnight Review&quot; the poet Simon Armitage and poetry writer Josephine Hart expressed regret about Padel&#x27;s resignation. &quot;Ruth&#x27;s a good person,&quot; Armitage said. &quot;She dipped a toe in the media whirlpool and it dragged her down. I don&#x27;t think she should have resigned; she would have been good.&quot; The election was for a post beginning the first day of Michaelmas Term 2009, hence Padel did not take up office. In the 2010 election she supported Geoffrey Hill.

== 2010 election ==

On 7 May 2010, the university, having changed its system of voting to embrace online voters, confirmed that Paula Claire, Geoffrey Hill, Michael Horovitz, Steve Larkin, Chris Mann and seven others had been nominated as candidates for the position.

Paula Claire, the only woman standing, announced her withdrawal on 7 June 2010, citing concerns about the fairness of the election, which were dismissed by the university authorities.

On 18 June, Geoffrey Hill was declared elected. He received 1,156 votes; the next highest number, 353, went to Michael Horovitz.

== 2015 election ==
On 19 June 2015, Simon Armitage was elected as Geoffrey Hill&#x27;s successor.

<text>In epidemiology, the basic reproduction number, or basic reproductive number (sometimes called basic reproduction ratio or basic reproductive rate), denoted formula_1 (pronounced &quot;R nought&quot; or &quot;R zero&quot;), of an infection is the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection. The definition assumes that no other individuals are infected or immunized (naturally or through vaccination). Some definitions, such as that of the Australian Department of Health, add the absence of &quot;any deliberate intervention in disease transmission&quot;. The basic reproduction number is not necessarily the same as the effective reproduction number formula_2 (usually written formula_3 [&quot;t&quot; for &quot;time&quot;], sometimes formula_4), which is the number of cases generated in the current state of a population, which does not have to be the uninfected state. formula_1 is a dimensionless number (persons infected per person infecting) and not a time rate, which would have units of time−1, or units of time like doubling time.

formula_1 is not a biological constant for a pathogen as it is also affected by other factors such as environmental conditions and the behaviour of the infected population. formula_1 values are usually estimated from mathematical models, and the estimated values are dependent on the model used and values of other parameters. Thus values given in the literature only make sense in the given context and it is not recommended to compare values based on different models. formula_1 does not by itself give an estimate of how fast an infection spreads in the population.

The most important uses of formula_1 are determining if an emerging infectious disease can spread in a population and determining what proportion of the population should be immunized through vaccination to eradicate a disease. In commonly used infection models, when formula_10 the infection will be able to start spreading in a population, but not if formula_11. Generally, the larger the value of formula_1, the harder it is to control the epidemic. For simple models, the proportion of the population that needs to be effectively immunized (meaning not susceptible to infection) to prevent sustained spread of the infection has to be larger than formula_13. This is the so-called &quot;Herd immunity&quot; &quot;threshold&quot; or &quot;herd immunity level&quot;. Here, herd immunity means that the disease cannot spread in the population because each infected person, on average, can only transmit the infection to less than one other contact. Conversely, the proportion of the population that remains susceptible to infection in the endemic equilibrium is formula_14. However, this threshold is based on simple models that assume a fully mixed population with no structured relations between the individuals. For example, if there is some correlation between people&#x27;s immunization (e.g., vaccination) status, then the formula formula_13 may underestimate the herd immunity threshold.

The basic reproduction number is affected by several factors, including the duration of infectivity of affected people, the contagiousness of the microorganism, and the number of susceptible people in the population that the infected people contact.

== History ==
The roots of the basic reproduction concept can be traced through the work of Ronald Ross, Alfred Lotka and others, but its first modern application in epidemiology was by George Macdonald in 1952, who constructed population models of the spread of malaria. In his work he called the quantity basic reproduction rate and denoted it by formula_16. 

== Overview of formula_1 estimation methods ==

=== Compartmental models ===

Compartmental models are a general modeling technique often applied to the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases. In these models, population members are assigned to &#x27;compartments&#x27; with labels – for example, S, I, or R, (Susceptible, Infectious, or Recovered). These models can be used to estimate formula_18.

=== Epidemic models on networks ===
Epidemics can be modeled as diseases spreading over networks of contact and disease transmission between people. Nodes in these networks represent individuals and links (edges) between nodes represent the contact or disease transmission between them. If such a network is a locally tree-like network, then the basic reproduction can be written in terms of the average excess degree of the transmission network such that:

formula_19

where formula_20 is the mean-degree (average degree) of the network and formula_21 is the second moment of the transmission network degree distribution.

=== Heterogeneous populations ===
In populations that are not homogeneous, the definition of formula_1 is more subtle. The definition must account for the fact that a typical infected individual may not be an average individual. As an extreme example, consider a population in which a small portion of the individuals mix fully with one another while the remaining individuals are all isolated. A disease may be able to spread in the fully mixed portion even though a randomly selected individual would lead to fewer than one secondary case. This is because the typical infected individual is in the fully mixed portion and thus is able to successfully cause infections. In general, if the individuals infected early in an epidemic are on average either more likely or less likely to transmit the infection than individuals infected late in the epidemic, then the computation of formula_1 must account for this difference. An appropriate definition for formula_1 in this case is &quot;the expected number of secondary cases produced, in a completely susceptible population, produced by a typical infected individual&quot;.

The basic reproduction number can be computed as a ratio of known rates over time: if a contagious individual contacts formula_25 other people per unit time, if all of those people are assumed to contract the disease, and if the disease has a mean infectious period of formula_26, then the basic reproduction number is just formula_27. Some diseases have multiple possible latency periods, in which case the reproduction number for the disease overall is the sum of the reproduction number for each transition time into the disease.

==Effective reproduction number==

In reality, varying proportions of the population are immune to any given disease at any given time. To account for this, the effective reproduction number formula_4 or formula_2 is used. formula_3 is the average number of new infections caused by a single infected individual at time &quot;t&quot; in the partially susceptible population. It can be found by multiplying formula_1 by the fraction &quot;S&quot; of the population that is susceptible. When the fraction of the population that is immune increases (i. e. the susceptible population &quot;S&quot; decreases) so much that formula_4 drops below, herd immunity has been achieved and the number of cases occurring in the population will gradually decrease to zero.

==Limitations of formula_1==
Use of formula_1 in the popular press has led to misunderstandings and distortions of its meaning. formula_1 can be calculated from many different mathematical models. Each of these can give a different estimate of formula_1, which needs to be interpreted in the context of that model. Therefore, the contagiousness of different infectious agents cannot be compared without recalculating formula_1 with invariant assumptions. formula_1 values for past outbreaks might not be valid for current outbreaks of the same disease. Generally speaking, formula_1 can be used as a threshold, even if calculated with different methods: if formula_11, the outbreak will die out, and if formula_10, the outbreak will expand. In some cases, for some models, values of formula_11 can still lead to self-perpetuating outbreaks. This is particularly problematic if there are intermediate vectors between hosts (as is the case for zoonoses), such as malaria. Therefore, comparisons between values from the &quot;Values of formula_1 of well-known contagious diseases&quot; table should be conducted with caution.

Although formula_1 cannot be modified through vaccination or other changes in population susceptibility, it can vary based on a number of biological, sociobehavioral, and environmental factors. It can also be modified by physical distancing and other public policy or social interventions, although some historical definitions exclude any deliberate intervention in reducing disease transmission, including nonpharmacological interventions. And indeed, whether nonpharmacological interventions are included in formula_1 often depends on the paper, disease, and what if any intervention is being studied. This creates some confusion, because formula_1 is not a constant; whereas most mathematical parameters with &quot;nought&quot; subscripts are constants.

formula_2 depends on many factors, many of which need to be estimated. Each of these factors adds to uncertainty in estimates of formula_2. Many of these factors are not important for informing public policy. Therefore, public policy may be better served by metrics similar to formula_2, but which are more straightforward to estimate, such as doubling time or half-life (formula_50).

Methods used to calculate formula_1 include the survival function, rearranging the largest eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix, the next-generation method, calculations from the intrinsic growth rate, existence of the endemic equilibrium, the number of susceptibles at the endemic equilibrium, the average age of infection and the final size equation. Few of these methods agree with one another, even when starting with the same system of differential equations. Even fewer actually calculate the average number of secondary infections. Since formula_1 is rarely observed in the field and is usually calculated via a mathematical model, this severely limits its usefulness.

== Sample values for various contagious diseases ==
Despite the difficulties in estimating formula_1mentioned in the previous section, estimates have been made for a number of genera, and are shown in this table. Each genus may be composed of many species, strains, or variants. Estimations of formula_1 for species, strains, and variants are typically less accurate than for genera, and so are provided in separate tables below for diseases of particular interest (influenza and COVID-19).&lt;section begin=&quot;r0hittable&quot; /&gt;

&lt;section end=&quot;COVIDr0hittable&quot; /&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the 2011 film &quot;Contagion&quot;, a fictional medical disaster thriller, a blogger&#x27;s calculations for formula_1 are presented to reflect the progression of a fatal viral infection from isolated cases to a pandemic.

<text>Werner Munzinger (4 April 1832 in Olten, Switzerland – 14 November 1875 in Aussa, Sultanate of Aussa) was a Swiss adventurer and administrator under the service of the Khedivate of Egypt.

==Life and career==
He was born in Olten, and studied science and history at the University of Bern, then later took courses in Oriental studies at Munich University and the Sorbonne. He was the son of Josef Munzinger, member of the Swiss Federal Council.

In 1852 Munzinger arrived at Cairo, where he spent a year improving his Arabic. Entering a French mercantile house, he led a trading expedition to various parts of the Red Sea. Until 1855 he served as French consul at Massawa, when he moved to Keren where he spent the next six years exploring the lands of the Bogos. In 1861 Munzinger joined Theodor von Heuglin in an attempt to explore central Africa, but separated from him in November, proceeding along the Gash and Atbara to Khartoum. There he succeeded von Heuglin as leader of the expedition, and travelled in 1862 to Kordofan, but failed to reach Darfur and Wadai.

After a short stay in Europe in 1863, Munzinger returned to the north and north-east borderlands of Ethiopia. In 1865 Munzinger managed the British consulate along the border of Ethiopia, but remained in Massawa, after the 1868 British invasion of Ethiopia, where he became the French consul. There, according to Augustus B. Wylde, he married a woman of Hamasien and convinced one of the local warlords, &quot;Wolde Mikael&quot;, to cede the province of Hamasien to France. Munzinger sailed to France, and by early 1870 had an expedition ready at Toulon to sail to Massawa when the Franco-Prussian War broke out, and French resources were diverted to this higher priority, whereupon he left the service of the French. In July of that year he was sent to Aden, where he joined Captain S.B. Miles on an expedition into the interior of the southern Arabian peninsula. He then left the French and entered the service of the Egyptian government of Khedive Ismail, serving as governor of the Keren region and Massawa (modern-day Eritrea). Once he reached his command, his first act was to place the Bogos once again under Egyptian rule and significantly develop the port of Massawa.

During the Egyptian-Ethiopian War, Munzinger was selected to command a small expedition intended to open up communication with Menelik II, king of Shewa, a potential ally of Egypt. In late 1875, he led an Egyptian force of 350 men from the port of Tadjoura towards Ankober with the objective of joining forces with Menelik. He planned to cross through the Danakil Desert and enter the Ethiopian Highlands through the Awash Valley. However on the night of November 14, warriors of the Afar and Issa tribes attacked the Egyptian force on the outskirts of Aussa. This resulted in the massacre of Munzinger, his wife, and most of the Egyptian soldiers. Only a few survivors managed to escape to back to Tadjoura. This defeat marked the end of the expansionist aspirations at the expense of the Christian empire.

== Writings ==
Munzinger published the following works:
* &quot;Über die Sitten und das Recht der Bogos&quot; (1859)
* &quot;Ostafrikanische Studien&quot; (1864; 2nd ed., 1883)
* &quot;Die deutsche Expedition in Ostafrika&quot; (1865)
* &quot;Vocabulaire de la langue de Tigré&quot; (1865)
He wrote numerous geographical papers, and a memoir on the northern highlands of modern-day Ethiopia and Eritrea for the &quot;Zeitschrift für allgemeine Erdkunde&quot;, new series, volume 3.
