<text>State Route 519 (SR 519) is a state highway in Seattle, Washington, United States. It connects Interstate 90 (I-90) to the Port of Seattle and Colman Dock, which serves as the terminus of two ferry routes. The highway travels along city streets, including two named for Seattle Mariners personalities: Edgar Martinez Drive and Dave Niehaus Way, as well as Alaskan Way. SR 519 was established in 1991 on preexisting streets that were first built in the early 20th century. State projects moved the southern terminus of SR 519 in 2010 to its current location and temporarily rerouted it during demolition of the Alaskan Way Viaduct.

==Route description==
SR 519 begins as Edgar Martinez Drive, named for former Seattle Mariners player Edgar Martínez, in the SoDo neighborhood south of Downtown Seattle. The highway begins at an elevated intersection with 4th Avenue and the western terminus of I-90. The highway travels west over BNSF Railway tracks, heading north to King Street Station, and turns north onto Dave Niehaus Way, named for former Mariners sportscaster Dave Niehaus, at an intersection with South Atlantic Street. Dave Niehaus Way continues north along the west side of T-Mobile Park and Lumen Field before becoming 1st Avenue. SR 519 turns west onto South Dearborn Street and north onto Alaskan Way at an intersection with ramps serving SR 99 at the south portal of its downtown tunnel. The highway ends at an intersection with Yesler Way at Colman Dock (Pier 52), which is served by two state ferry routes to Bremerton and Bainbridge Island. Alaskan Way continues north along the city&#x27;s waterfront towards Lower Queen Anne.

The highway primarily serves as a connector to Colman Dock, the Port of Seattle, and the city&#x27;s waterfront. Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. Average traffic volumes on the highway in 2019 ranged from a minimum of 12,000 vehicles on Alaskan Way near Colman Dock to a maximum of 33,000 vehicles on 1st Avenue near T-Mobile Park. The state government has designated SR 519 as a Highway of Statewide Significance, which includes principal arterials that are needed to connect major communities in the state.

==History==
SR 519 was codified in 1991 as a state highway and began at the western terminus of I-90, then at 4th Avenue S., and traveled west onto Royal Brougham Way and north on Alaskan Way to Colman Dock. The city streets in Seattle used by SR 519 were constructed after the series of regrades in the early 20th century filled a mudflat in SoDo. By 1916, Alaskan Way (then known as Railroad Avenue) was paved and had its rails removed to handle growing traffic. The Alaskan Way Viaduct was built above Alaskan Way between 1950 and 1953 and narrowed the street after Colman Dock was transferred to Washington State Ferries in 1951. Ferry routes were incorporated into the state highway system in 1994, as SR 304 and SR 305 were extended to Seattle and SR 339 was created.

WSDOT completed their South Seattle Intermodal Access Project in May 2010, which improved SR 519 and the western terminus of I-90 to better handle freight traffic heading to the Port of Seattle. New bridges over BNSF Railway tracks were built on Royal Brougham Way and off-ramps to I-90 that connect to Edgar Martinez Drive. SR 519 was later moved onto Edgar Martinez Drive in 2010 as a direct extension of I-90 after the construction of the new ramp and improvements to an intersection with Atlantic Street. Until then, SR 519 had used a section of South Royal Brougham Way and 4th Avenue South to reach the I-90 ramps. SR 519 is routed onto two streets named for Seattle Mariners personalities: Edgar Martinez Drive, dedicated in 2005, and Dave Niehaus Way, dedicated in 2010. During the construction of the Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement tunnel, WSDOT closed SR 519 and Alaskan Way between King Street and Yesler Way in May 2012, re-routing the highway to a temporary alignment. Alaskan Way is planned to be widened to eight lanes to accommodate bus lanes and turn lanes for the ferry terminal.

<text>Hair gel is a hairstyling product that is used to harden hair into a particular hairstyle.

==History==

Analysis of ancient Egyptian mummies has shown that they styled their hair using a fat-based gel. The researchers behind the analysis say that the Egyptians used the product to ensure that their style stayed in place in both life and death. Natalie McCreesh, an archaeological scientist from the KNH Centre for Biomedical Egyptology at the University of Manchester, England, and her colleagues studied hair samples taken from 18 mummies. The oldest is approximately 3,500 years old, but most were excavated from a cemetery in the Dakhleh Oasis in the Western Desert and date from Greco-Roman times, around 2,300 years ago.

The Irish bog body Clonycavan Man, which has been radiocarbon dated to between 392 BC and 201 BC, was found to have been using a hair gel made from pine tree resin imported from Spain or South-west France.

In 1914, in a small pharmacy located in the heart of Buenos Aires, Argentina (Florida at 600), veterinary student José Antonio Brancato mixed a fixative for hair which would carry the name &quot;gomina&quot; as a registered trademark. For this, he mixed gum Arabic, Persian tragacanth and different essences. Soon the word &quot;gomina&quot; became synonymous with fixative. A fixative that displaced the soaps and oils used for this purpose.

In 1929, the British company Chemico Works invented Brylcreem, which became the market leader among hair styling products in both the U.K. and the U.S. during the following decades.

In the 1960s, modern hair gel was invented in the United States, by what would later be renamed the Dep Corporation. Marketed under the brand name Dep, modern hair gel was given this name by its inventor, Luis Montoya, in recognition of the substance that gave it its unique, non-greasy consistency: diethyl phthalate, commonly abbreviated as DEP.

==Types==
Many brands of hair gel in North America and the UK come in numbered variants. Higher numbered gels maintain a greater &quot;hold&quot; on hair, while lower numbers do not make the hair as stiff and in some products give the hair a wet look. One category of hair gels is designed and manufactured specifically for sculpting the hair texture common to people of African descent. Other ethnic groups who are known for using hair gel include Mediterraneans, Eastern Europeans, Arabs and Latin Americans.

Some forms of hair gel are marketed to consumers who want to &quot;spike&quot; their hair in the style that emerged from the hardcore punk subculture in the 1980s. Some hair gels include temporary hair coloring, which includes variants in unnatural colors associated with various subcultures, such as the goths, ravers, mobsters, and greasers.

===Cationic polymers===
Cationic polymers are among the main functional components of hair gel. The positive charges in the polymers causes them to stretch, making the gel more viscous. Hair gels resist natural protein conformations and allow hair to be styled and textured, because the stretched-out polymer takes up more space than a coiled polymer and thus resists the flow of solvent molecules around it. The positive charges also bind the gel to the negatively charged amino acids on the surface of the keratin molecules in the hair.

=== Other polymers ===
More complicated polymer formulas exist; i.e., a copolymer of vinylpyrrolidone, methacrylamide, and N-vinylimidazole.

<text>Hair mousse, also referred to as styling foam, is a hairstyling product to protect, control, and style hair. &quot;Mousse&quot; originates from a French term meaning foam. Hair mousse originated in France and was brought to the North American retail market by L&#x27;Oreal in the 1980s.

It is often dispensed in an aerosol foam spray or in cream form. Hair mousse adds volume to hair and provides both conditioning and hold, without any clumps or build-up. It is a hairstyling product which works by using synthetic resins to coat the hairs, to assist the hair in taking a certain shape. 

==History==

The early 1980s arrival of hair mousse in North America was known as &quot;mousse mania&quot; as hairdressers unveiled the new foam product to their clientele. Throughout its first years on the market, hair mousse quickly became a multimillion-dollar product. 1984 domestic retail sales for the product ranged from $100–$150 million and almost $200 million in sales by 1986.

By the mid-1980s, the big hair style trend and the usage of mousse and other volumizing products increased in popularity. It is believed that the year 1987 marked the decline of &quot;mousse mania&quot;, as the popularity of having big hair decreased and people began to grow concerned about using more environmentally friendly products. Due to the chemical makeup of the hairstyling product it was not commonly deemed &quot;environmentally friendly&quot;. 

==Application==

As a versatile and light-weight hair styling product, hair mousse is a popular choice for both short and long hairstyles and can be used on naturally curly or permed hair to reduce frizz and define curl. When hair mousse is applied to wet hair that is dried with a hair dryer or diffuser attachment, it provides additional volume and hold.

Temporary color mousse can be used to cover up grey hair and create hair styles at the same time. Semi-permanent color mousse can be used to give toning to hair that is fading from hair color processes.

==Ingredients==

Typically, the first ingredient in a canister of hair mousse is water, which is the top substance used to blend the varying chemical substances together. Alcohol helps dissolve the ingredients already added to the water and helps produce a quick breaking foam. 

A polymer or resin is the most effective and important component of hair mousse, which acts as a conditioning agent. These resins are long chain molecules that form a film on the hair allowing a tighter grip on the hair strands, making it harder to brush off and form a resistant film. This allows users to comb or brush their hair, as well as apply heat from a blow dryer without the mousse leaving the hair stiff.

Cationic resin is often blended with another film former to give a firmer hold on the hair. In order for this to be successful, the polymer chosen must be nonionic in nature and should be compatible with the cationic resin.
Emulsifiers are used to help blend the product creating foam. Mousses do not require long-lasting foam stability. Ideally, the foam will break down immediately once worked into the hair.

Other added ingredients in various hair mousses, such as vitamins, silicones, sunscreens, and dyes, tend to assist in additional functions for the hair mousse product, such as providing an additional conditioning component.

Certain brands contain alcohol, which is suitable for most hair types except dry.

<text>&quot;The Devil in the Dark&quot; is the twenty-fifth episode of the first season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Gene L. Coon and directed by Joseph Pevney, the episode first aired on March 9, 1967.

In this episode, the Enterprise is called to investigate deaths at a planetary mining facility. Spock and Kirk go on a mission to the facility, leading to them facing off against a deadly subterranean creature.

This episode marks the first appearance of Doctor McCoy&#x27;s catchphrase, &quot;I&#x27;m a doctor, not a ...&quot;

==Plot==
The USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; arrives at the pergium mining colony on planet Janus VI to help the colony deal with an unknown creature that has killed 50 miners and engineers, and destroyed equipment with a strong corrosive substance. Captain Kirk, Spock, and McCoy meet with the mine supervisor, Chief Engineer Vanderberg. During the briefing, Spock&#x27;s attention is drawn to a silicon nodule on Vanderberg&#x27;s desk, which Vanderberg dismisses as a geological oddity. They are alerted to a problem in the colony&#x27;s nuclear reactor, and find its guard killed and the main circulating pump stolen. The part has long since gone out of production, so no replacements are available. Chief Engineer Scott jury rigs a substitute, but it fails shortly thereafter, necessitating the missing part be found and reinstalled before the reactor goes super-critical in 10 hours or is manually shut down, which will suffocate the miners.

Kirk and his security team search for the creature. Spock, suspecting it may be a silicon based lifeform, modifies their phasers to be more effective against silicon. They encounter the creature—which has the appearance of molten rock—and fire upon it, breaking a piece of it off. The creature flees by burrowing through a rock wall. Spock analyzes the fragment, whose composition resembles fibrous asbestos. He deduces that it burrows through solid rock by secreting the same corrosive substance that has killed the miners. Spock adjusts his tricorder to scan for silicon-based life, and confirms that the creature is the only such lifeform for miles.

Kirk and Spock happen upon a chamber containing thousands of the silicon nodules. The creature causes a cave-in that separates Kirk from Spock. Though Spock urges Kirk to kill it, Kirk observes the creature backs off whenever he aims his phaser at it. Spock finds a way around the cave-in and joins Kirk. He attempts a mind meld with the creature, but perceives little but intense pain. The creature, having gained some knowledge of human language from the meld, etches the ambiguous message &quot;NO KILL I&quot; into a rock. By making physical contact with the creature, Spock establishes a deeper mind meld. He learns that the creature is called a Horta, and that its species dies out completely every 50,000 years, save for one individual that remains alive to protect the eggs, which are the silicon nodules. As the nodule eggs hatch, the single adult Horta acts as a protective mother to this next generation. Though nearing death because of her wound, the Horta communicates through Spock, telling them the location of the stolen pump. There Kirk also discovers thousands of broken eggs which were destroyed by the miners as worthless.

The miners arrive and attempt to attack the creature. Kirk and Spock stop them, explaining that it was only protecting its eggs when it killed humans. Dr. McCoy successfully treats the Horta&#x27;s wound using a silicon-based cement normally used for building emergency shelters. The miners fear the prospect of thousands of Horta, but Kirk convinces them that the Horta are peaceful and could collaborate with the miners by tunneling for them.

Kirk, Spock, and McCoy return to the Enterprise, prepare to leave orbit, and learn from Vanderberg that the eggs have hatched and already the new Horta have uncovered rich veins of pergium and other valuable metals.

==Production==
The Horta was played by stuntman and acrobat Janos Prohaska, who also designed the costume. Prohaska was promised that if he created something good enough, the producers would rent the costume and pay Prohaska to play the part. Episode writer Gene Coon was convinced of the costume&#x27;s effectiveness after an impromptu demonstration by Prohaska in the studios.

William Shatner says this is his favorite episode of the series. His father died during its filming, but Shatner insisted on going through with production, and felt closer to the cast and crew for helping him through the difficult time.

This episode also marks the first appearance of Doctor McCoy&#x27;s catchphrase, &quot;I&#x27;m a doctor, not a ...!&quot; In this case, the line is, &quot;I&#x27;m a doctor, not a bricklayer!&quot;, said by McCoy when Kirk orders him to heal the Horta.

Actor Barry Russo plays Security Chief Giotto who is referred to several times as ‘Lt. Commander’, yet the uniform he wears bears the insignia of a full ‘Commander’.

The name Horta came from a well-liked sound effects and music editor at the time named Sam Horta. Sam later opened a sound editing facility in Burbank called “Horta Editorial”. His daughter Eileen continued in his footsteps and served as the president of the Motion Picture Sound Editors, M.P.S. E.

==Reception==
=== Cast ===
William Shatner wrote in his memoirs that &quot;The Devil in the Dark&quot; was his favorite original &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode. He thought it was &quot;exciting, thought-provoking and intelligent, it contained all of the ingredients that made up our very best &quot;Star Trek&quot;s&quot;. In the documentary &quot;50 Years of Star Trek&quot;, Leonard Nimoy also named &quot;The Devil in the Dark&quot; as an &quot;interesting episode&quot;, stating &quot;I thought [it] was a wonderful episode about the fear of the unknown, how we fear and even hate something that we don&#x27;t know anything about, learn who your enemy is, and it&#x27;s not, maybe then it&#x27;s no longer your enemy.&quot;

<doc id="908031" wikidata="Q2750027" url="?curid=908031" title="Fort William, West Bengal">
<text>Fort William is a fort in Hastings, Calcutta (Kolkata). It was built during the early years of Britain&#x27;s administration of Bengal. It sits on the eastern banks of the River Hooghly, the major distributary of the River Ganga. One of Kolkata&#x27;s most enduring British-era military fortifications, other than those in Bombay (Mumbai) and Madras (Chennai), it extends over an area of seventy hectares.

The fort was named after King William III. In front of the Fort is the Maidan, the largest park in the country. An internal guard room became the Black Hole of Calcutta. Today the fort is the headquarters of Eastern Command of the Indian Army.

==History==


There are two Fort Williams. The original fort was built in the year 1696 by the British East India Company under the orders of Sir John Goldsborough which took a decade to complete. The permission was granted by Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. Sir Charles Eyre started construction near the bank of the Hooghly River with the South-East Bastion and the adjacent walls. It was named after King William III in 1700. John Beard, Eyre&#x27;s successor, added the North-East Bastion in 1701, and in 1702 started the construction of the Government House (Factory, see Factory (trading post)) at the centre of the fort. Construction ended in 1706. The original building had two stories and projecting wings. In 1756, the Nawab of Bengal, Siraj Ud Daulah, attacked the Fort, temporarily conquered the city, and changed its name to Alinagar. This led the British to build a new fort in the Maidan. Robert Clive started rebuilding the fort in 1758, after the Battle of Plassey (1757); construction was completed in 1781 at a cost of approximately two million pounds. The area around the Fort was cleared, and the Maidan became &quot;the Lungs of Kolkata&quot;. It stretches for around 3 km in the north–south direction and is around 1 km wide. The headquarters of the Indian Ordnance Factories was established in 1775 at Fort William.

Today, Fort William is the property of the Indian Army. The headquarters of Eastern Command is based there, with provisions for accommodating 10,000 army personnel. The Army guards it heavily, and civilian entry is restricted.

Much of Fort William is unchanged, but St Peter&#x27;s Church, which used to serve as a chaplaincy centre for the British citizens of Kolkata, is now a library for the troops of HQ Eastern Command. A major part of the land parcel is home to the family of Ghosh and Pal.

A war memorial has been created at the entrance of the fort, and the fort also houses a museum which displays artifacts from the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, especially those related to the battles in the Eastern sector and the Bangladesh Liberation War.

===First Indian Masonic lodge===
In 1730, Ralph Farrwinter and other members of the East India Company opened the first Indian Masonic lodge, a short time after the creation of the Grand Lodge of England in 1717.

===Presidency of Fort William===
==Structure==
The Fort is built of brick and mortar in the shape of an irregular octagon with an area of . Five of its sides face landward, and three towards the Hooghly River. The design is that of a star fort, suited to defence against cannon firing solid shot, and dates from before the advent of explosive shells. A dry moat deep and broad surrounds the fort. The moat can be flooded but is designed as an area in which to use enfilade (or flanking) fire against any attackers reaching the walls. There are six gates: Chowringhee, Plassey, Calcutta, Water Gate, St Georges and the Treasury Gate. There are similar forts at places like Thalassery in Kerala.

<doc id="908032" wikidata="Q1424150" url="?curid=908032" title="Hair iron">
<text>A hair iron or hair tong is a tool used to change the arrangement of the hair using heat. There are three general kinds: &quot;curling irons&quot;, used to make the hair curl; &quot;straightening irons&quot;, commonly called &quot;straighteners&quot; or &quot;flat irons&quot;, used to straighten the hair; and &quot;crimping irons&quot;, used to create crimps of the desired size in the hair.

Most models have electric heating; cordless curling irons or flat irons typically use butane, and some flat irons use batteries that can last up to 30 minutes for straightening. Overuse of these tools can cause severe damage to hair.

==Types of hair irons==

===Curling iron===

Curling irons, also known as curling tongs, create waves or curls in hair using a variety of different methods. There are many different types of modern curling irons, which can vary by diameter, material, and shape of barrel and the type of handle. The barrel&#x27;s diameter can be anywhere from to . Smaller barrels typically create spiral curls or ringlets, and larger barrels are used to give shape and volume to a hairstyle.

Curling irons are typically made of ceramic, metal, Teflon, titanium, tourmaline. The barrel&#x27;s shape can either be a cone, reverse cone, or cylinder, and the iron can have brush attachments or double and triple barrels.

The curling iron can also have either a clipless, Marcel, or spring-loaded handle. Spring-loaded handles are the most popular and use a spring to work the barrel&#x27;s clamp. When using a Marcel handle, one applies pressure to the clamp. Clipless wands have no clamp: the user simply wraps hair around a rod. Most clipless curling irons come with a Kevlar glove to avoid burns.

=== Straightening irons ===

Straightening irons, straighteners, or flat irons work by breaking down the positive hydrogen bonds found in the hair&#x27;s cortex, which cause hair to open, bend and become curly. Once the bonds are broken, hair is prevented from holding its original, natural form, though the hydrogen bonds can re-form if exposed to moisture. Straightening irons use mainly ceramic material for their plates. Low-end straighteners use a single layer of ceramic coating on the plates, whereas high-end straighteners use multiple layers or even 100% ceramic material. Some straightening irons are fitted with an automatic shut off feature to prevent fire accidents.

Early hair straightening systems relied on harsh chemicals that tended to damage the hair. In the 1870s, the French hairdresser Marcel Grateau introduced heated metal hair care implements such as hot combs to straighten hair. Madame C.J. Walker used combs with wider teeth and popularized their use together with her system of chemical scalp preparation and straightening lotions. Her mentor Annie Malone is sometimes said to have patented the hot comb. Heated metal implements slide more easily through the hair, reducing damage and dryness. Women in the 1960s sometimes used clothing irons to straighten their hair.

In 1909, Isaac K. Shero patented the first hair straightener composed of two flat irons that are heated and pressed together.

Ceramic and electrical straighteners were introduced later, allowing adjustment of heat settings and straightener size. A ceramic hair straightener brush was patented in 2013. Sharon Rabi released the first straightening brush in 2015 under the DAFNI brand name. The ceramic straightening brush has a larger surface area than a traditional flat iron.

===Crimping irons===

Crimping irons or crimpers work by crimping hair in sawtooth style. The look is similar to the crimps left after taking out small braids. Crimping irons come in different sizes with different sized ridges on the paddles. Larger ridges produce larger crimps in the hair and smaller ridges produce smaller crimps. Crimped hair was very popular in the 1980s and 1990s.

<text>The Minneapolis Aquatennial is an annual outdoor event held in the U.S. city of Minneapolis, Minnesota, during the third full week of July. Originating in 1940, overshadowing the teamster picnics &quot;to take the minds of Minneapolis citizens off past troubles and focus all minds throughout the state on some pleasant event&quot;, the Minneapolis Aquatennial celebrates the city&#x27;s famous lakes, rivers, and streams.

Advertised as &quot;The Best Days of Summer&quot; the festivities initially included some 200 events over 10 days (hence Aqua-ten-ial), at one point or another including the Aqua Follies, the Xcel Energy Sand Castle Competition, the Tom Thumb Milk Carton Boat Races, the Ultimate Wireless Co-ed Beach Volleyball Tournament, a sailing regatta, a tennis invitational, the Life Time Fitness Triathlon, many parades, among them the Minnegasco Torchlight Parade, the Master of International Management presents Shakespeare in the Park, Subway Block Party and the final Target Fireworks, one of the largest in the country, much larger than the city&#x27;s Fourth of July celebration.

==History==

In 1941, among the Aqua Follies was the Aqua Dears, a synchronized swimming troupe with strict height and weight limits of 5&#x27;4&quot; and 125 lbs

In 1971 the Tom Thumb Milk Carton Boat Races was conceived by advertising executives looking to drum up sales.

Minneapolis celebrated its centennial in 1956 in conjunction with the Aquatennial. The city&#x27;s sesquicentennial was July 18–27, 2008, the year Minnesota celebrated 150 years of statehood.

The Aquatennial was cancelled from 1942 to 1945 because of World War II, and in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Aquatennial Ambassador Organization Queen of the Lakes Scholarship Program==
The Queen of the Lakes Scholarship Program is a week-long candidate program for women ages 18–22 that is held in Minneapolis in conjunction with the Minneapolis Aquatennial every July.

The Queen of the Lakes and two Aquatennial Princesses are chosen to represent the festival and city of Minneapolis all over the state, nation and world. Fifty young women representing communities throughout the state of Minnesota participate in the program.

<doc id="908051" wikidata="Q1683043" url="?curid=908051" title="Janus Chess">
<text>Janus Chess is a chess variant invented in 1978 by Werner Schöndorf from Bildstock, Germany. It is played on a 10×8 board and features a fairy chess piece, the &quot;janus&quot;, with the combined moves of a bishop and a knight. The janus piece is named after the Roman god Janus because this god was usually depicted with two faces looking in opposite directions.

==Description==
The usual set of chess pieces is extended with two pawns and two januses per player. Each janus is placed between a rook and a knight. The relative position of the king and queen is reversed compared to chess. After castling, the king stands on either the b- or i-file and a rook stands on either the c- or h-file, depending on which side castling is done.

The janus is considered almost as powerful as a queen and is usually valued at about 8 points (based on chess piece values with pawns valued at 1). It is the only piece in the game that is able to checkmate the opponent&#x27;s king without the assistance of any other piece, with the king in a corner and the janus two squares away on a diagonal, but this checkmate cannot be . Due to the extra pieces, each player starts the game with considerably more &quot; power&quot; compared to standard chess; however, the game has only a slightly higher material &quot;power density&quot;, since there is more room for players to maneuver pieces because of the larger board (10×8 = 80 squares). Due to the different board and pieces, players are unable to use normal chess opening theory, and chess tablebases have limited value in the endgame.

Janus Chess has been popular in Europe with regular tournaments drawing strong players. Several chess grandmasters have played this game including Viktor Korchnoi, Péter Lékó and Artur Yusupov. Korchnoi said: &quot;I like playing Janus Chess because one can show more creativity than in normal chess.&quot;

<doc id="908053" wikidata="Q7817266" url="?curid=908053" title="Tom Potter">
<text>Thomas Jay Potter (born September 12, 1940) is an American politician and law enforcement officer in the U.S. state of Oregon. He served as Mayor of Portland from 2005 to 2009, and had been the chief of the Portland Police Bureau from 1987 to 1990. As mayor he continued his advocacy of community policing and expressed interest in other reforms of the Portland Police Bureau. He marched against the Iraq War on the first anniversary of American involvement in March 2004 and was dismayed at the black uniforms and the militarized appearance of the Portland police he saw. He made it part of his campaign to rid the police of such a militarized appearance.

==Family life==
Potter was born in 1940 in North Bend, Oregon. When he was 10 years old, his family moved to Portland, Oregon.

Potter lives in the Woodstock neighborhood of southeast Portland with his wife Karin Hansen. His hobbies include archaeology, hiking, camping, and bicycling.

Potter&#x27;s openly lesbian daughter, Katie Potter, is a retired Portland police officer. Potter, as the city&#x27;s Chief of Police, marched in his police uniform in Portland&#x27;s annual gay pride parade to show his support for his daughter, and the LGBT+ community. He was the first Portland Police Chief to do so, and has spoken out in support of same-sex marriage.

==Career in the police force==
Potter began as a police officer in 1966 as a beat officer in southeast Portland in the Brooklyn and Sellwood neighborhoods. Although the neighborhoods are considered desirable residential locations today, at the time they were largely crime-ridden and threatened by gangs. According to Potter, early in his career a citizen in Sellwood asked him what he, as a citizen, could do to help the police. His sergeant informed him to tell the citizen to &quot;stay inside and let the police do their jobs.&quot; The comment helped motivate Potter&#x27;s early interest in making changes between the relationship of the police and the citizens. There was also a saying in police culture which evoked Tom&#x27;s political fires known as &quot;go along to get along.&quot; Basically translating to &quot;do the wrong thing so as not to disturb our nice lives.&quot;

In 1986, Potter was promoted to captain in the North Precinct. He was appointed police chief in 1990 by Mayor Bud Clark, heading up the 1,300 officers in the city&#x27;s largest bureau. He served three years as chief before retiring at age 52 after 25 years of service in the police force. He served as interim director of the Oregon State Department of Safety and Standards and as the director of New Avenues for Youth, a service provider for homeless youth in Portland. He also consulted with police bureaus around the country on the topics of community policing and strategic planning and was considered for the job of Top Cop in the Clinton Administration to head up their COPS Office. In 2003, he decided to run for mayor of Portland, based partly on a desire to help reform the Portland police department. He built a platform on the issue of community policing, a police strategy that involves active engagement with neighborhoods with such tactics as getting police officers out of their patrol cars.

==Political career==

===Mayoral campaign===
When Potter announced his campaign for mayor on October 14, 2003, running in a field of 22 candidates, he was not widely considered as a likely contender because Potter limited his individual campaign donations to 25 dollars per person. His slogan was &quot;It&#x27;s not about dollars, it&#x27;s all about sense.&quot; He worked by the moral guidelines of &quot;listen, listen, listen,&quot; and people according to Potter told him he listened too much as a leader. He believed that all residents should have equal access to their politicians. Political insiders considered this a crazy move that made him unelectable. Nevertheless, he won the primary in 2004, having raised only $65,000 in campaign funds, versus other candidates who raised hundreds of thousands of dollars.

For the runoff election, he raised the limit on his contributions to 100 dollars per individual. In the months following the 2004 primary election, Potter maintained a 2–1 lead over City Commissioner Jim Francesconi in polls with roughly 25% of the electorate still undecided through October of that year. Francesconi, who raised a city-record $1 million and outspent Potter 6-to-1 during the campaign. Potter won the general election in November 2004 over Francesconi with 60% of the vote. Potter was inaugurated on January 3, 2005, succeeding Mayor Vera Katz (who had served for three terms, but did not run for a fourth).

===Actions as mayor===

Portland is unlike most large United States cities, in that the Portland City Council performs many duties that are more typically in a mayor&#x27;s purview. That is sometimes called the &quot;weak mayor&quot; system, in which the mayor and the four members of the City Council each supervise the various agencies of the city. When Potter took office, he declared that he was taking centralized control of all city bureaus for a period of six months. He later redistributed them once the adjustment period was completed. Potter advocated for a change to that system, advocating for a &quot;strong mayor&quot; initiative in the May 2007 election. The measure was defeated by a 3-1 margin.

Potter is widely credited for emphasizing diversity, and making city hall more accessible to underrepresented communities, such as people of color, immigrants and refugees, and youth. One of his major progressive projects was working with latinx activists, as an ally, and making 39th Avenue Cesar Chavez Blvd. In October 2006, Potter introduced a resolution affirming the city&#x27;s commitment to the inclusion of immigrants and refugees in civic life, and convened the city&#x27;s first-ever Immigrant and Refugee Task Force to recommend strategies to address barriers to engagement. Together with wife Karin Hansen and with the help of several hundred young Portlanders, Potter led Portland to become the first major U.S. city to produce a children&#x27;s bill of rights. Our Bill of Rights: Children and Youth was created by the children and youth of the Portland area to advise community leaders of what support and access they needed to reach their full potential. It was adopted as an advisory document by both the Portland City Council and the Multnomah County Commission.

Also during 2006, Potter initiated the development of a new Office of Human Relations, dedicated to combating social issues such as race and sexual identity discrimination, hate crimes and human rights abuses through the establishment of a Human Rights Commission and police Racial Profiling Committee. The new Office officially commenced in January 2008.

Early in 2007, Potter proposed four changes to Portland&#x27;s city charter requiring a vote by the electorate. The changes included language providing for: A regular review of the charter every ten years, increased control of the Portland Development Commission by the City Council, exclusion of some city government job classes from civil service protections, and the most dramatic of the proposed changes, the establishment of a new form of government that provided greatly increased authority for the Mayor relative to the existing system. Of the proposed changes to the charter, the form of government switch was the most debated and was characterized by opponents as a power grab. In May 2007, Portland voters passed three of the proposed changes, but rejected the change to the city&#x27;s form of government by a decisive 3-to-1 margin.

After months of speculation, Potter announced on September 10, 2007, that he would not run for re-election as mayor of Portland in 2008. He cited a desire to spend more time with his family. In May 2008, Sam Adams was elected as the next mayor. Potter&#x27;s term ended when Adams took the oath of office on January 1, 2009.

<text>Calayan Island is located about west-southwest of Babuyan Island off the north coast of the Philippines and belongs to the Babuyan Islands group in the Luzon Strait. The island is hemmed between Aparri and Batanes islands and it is larger than the Fuga Island, which is away. Calayan is home to the Calayan rail, a flightless bird identified as a separate species in 2004 and endemic to Calayan Island. The island is part of the Municipality of Calayan.

==History==
The name of the island came from the Ibanag language, meaning &quot;where laya (ginger) is abounded&quot;. A mission headquarters was established on Calayan Island in 1722. During the Spanish colonial administration regime, the administrators were Don Licerio Duerme in 1896, Don Pedro Abad in 1897, and Don Angel Escalante during 1898–1902.

Administratively, the Calayan island was part of the Batanes group of islands. From 1902, Calayan was brought under Cagayan Province. However, this change of administrative control resulted in isolation of the islanders as transport communications were lacking. In 1916, Fray Andres Sanchez and Fray Geronimo Morer, Dominican Fathers, visited this island and gave the island its name. It was only in 1954 that the Governor of Cagayan, Jose P. Carag, came to Calayan. The next visit by a governor was only in 1981, by Justiniano P. Cortez, when a mobile government was organized to improve the health conditions of the people and to distribute medicine and food items such as rice, canned goods, and seeds. A repeat of this mission occurred in 1982.

In 1940, during World War II, American Forces, who came by the USS &quot;Princeton&quot;, occupied the island. This was welcomed by the people of Calayan as it ushered prosperity to the island as well as provision of medicine, clothing and other items of utility. Schools were established by the American forces and they also functioned as teachers with English as the medium of instruction. They also introduced adult education programmes. In return, the Calayanos offered gifts to the soldiers such as ancient jars, sea shells and handicrafts. On 8 December 1941, the Calayan group of islands became occupied by Japanese Imperial Forces. During the early liberation period in 1944, the combined Filipino and American Forces seized the Japanese garrison, and moved the Japanese prisoners to concentration camps in Luzon.

The rocky northern coast line of the Calayan Island was the scene of a disaster when the warship &quot;Datu Kalantiaw&quot;, which had served during World War II and subsequently under the Philippine flag, was hit by Typhoon Clara. The ship ran aground on 21 September 1981. Rescue and recovery operations were launched by the ammunition ship USS &quot;Mount Hood&quot; together with the Philippine Navy units &quot;in a most adverse weather environment,&quot; and could recover only 49 bodies of the 79 who perished (presumably other 30 bodies were not recovered) which were taken to Manila to be handed over to the next of kin of the dead.

== Geography ==

The land area of the island is . It has a rough rectangular shape with rolling hills, spread over a length of . The island consists mainly of mountainous and uneven land, with the highest land in the centre, with low gaps in places. The hill ridge runs through the middle of the island and is heavily forested. The Mt. Calayan which was once an active volcano is the highest peak here. The island is of volcanic origin and has rich deposits of perlite, a greyish white rock which is called as the &quot;wonder rock&quot;. There are rocky shores and white sand beaches. Four rivers drain the island. Coral limestones are seen at both the higher and lower levels of the island. The eastern part of the island has basaltic columns, which are seen in a good state of preservation. 

The populated areas on the island are Calayan town (Centro) and Magsidel on the south coast. Calayan town is the largest among the Babuyan Island group and it is a small fishing center. The port of Calayan is used for shipping goats, hogs, cattle and timber.

There are three floodplains where rice is cultivated. Tidal coral flats that protect the sandy beaches between the settlements of Dilam and Dibay are also a distinct feature. The present access is by outrigger boats locally called &quot;lampitaw&quot;, which takes the islanders from Calayan to the port of Aparri and Claveria on the west coast of the Cagayan Province where an airport to operate small aircraft is also under construction.

===Climate===
Weather conditions are generally wet with heavy rainfall occurring during November and December. The cold winds are the northerly and north-easterly winds. The island is also affected by typhoons. Calayan Island publishes tide tables and solunar tables, daily forecasts for high tides and low tides, other fishing-related data such as the lunar phase, tidal coefficient, sun and moon rising and setting times, hours of maximum fish activity and weather conditions. This data is also useful for all fishing operations in the Calayan Island, apart from navigation of other commercial and transport vessels.

== Flora ==
Thick forest is found in the hill ridge that is in the center of the island (elevation ). The forest cover is low land vegetation of primary and regenerated low land forests which are also seen around the exposed coral limestones. This forest has tall “cogon” grass, apart from many species of timber trees along the east coastline and at the north-western tip of the island. Wild guavas are in abundance. Banana is also cultivated though of an inferior variety. Coconut trees are seen in small patches. Other vegetables and crops grown are tobacco, corn, rice and camotes, in the intermediate patches of land. Among the commercial crops, cotton is also grown here. The beach front, above the high wave zone, is covered with butun (a Tugalo language name) trees where hawks are seen.

== Fauna ==
Endemic gecko are found in rocky outcrops, in caves, forests and on tree trunks in the island. Pigs and carabaos (water buffaloes) are seen in the wild.

=== Avifauna ===
The flightless Calayan rail (&quot;Gallirallus calayanensis&quot;) is restricted to Calayan island under the Babuyan islands group and listed as vulnerable. It was first discovered by scientists in 2004. Malaysian plover is also reported from the sandy beaches here and it is under near threatened category. In 1903, the bird species identified here were 95 of which the birds of the family of Philippines formed a part. The other species were identified, as of the Asiatic genera, such as &quot;Hypsipetes&quot; and &quot;sphenocereus&quot;, which form the distinct fauna of the island; the specific species noted were Macropygia, otus, Eudynamys, and Hylorpe. Of the Luzon group, only Cnnyria whitchiadi and Zosterups meyeni were found on the island. There were many migrant species also on the island which were not specifically identified.

According to a field survey carried out in 2004, the newly sighted bird on the island was the Calayan rail &quot;Gallirallus calayanensis&quot;. Apart from this, the other species recorded during the field visit were:

* white-browed crake (&quot;Porzana cinerea&quot;)

== Tourism ==
The Sibang Cove is known for the many ancient burial grounds, and many artifacts unearthed here are in the National Museum. The municipal administration of the island is developing the cove as an ecotourism destination. As the area is also one of the breeding grounds of the humpback whales, this aspect is also intended to be highlighted for whale watching by tourists.

<text>James Beriah Frazier (October 18, 1856 – March 28, 1937) was an American politician who served as the 28th governor of Tennessee from 1903 to 1905, and subsequently as a United States senator from Tennessee from 1905 to 1911. As governor, he reduced the state&#x27;s debt and enacted mine safety regulations. He also attempted to control whitecapping.

The controversial manner in which the state legislature elected him to the U.S. Senate created a critical rift in the state&#x27;s Democratic Party that lasted into the 1910s.

==Early life==

Frazier was born in Pikeville, Tennessee, the son of Thomas and Margaret (McReynolds) Frazier. In 1867, his family moved to Davidson County, where his father had been appointed to a criminal court judgeship. Frazier attended Franklin College, a seminary near Nashville, and obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Tennessee in 1878. He studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1881, and moved to Chattanooga to practice law.

Described by historian Zella Armstrong as &quot;one of the greatest orators who ever lived in the Volunteer State,&quot; Frazier quickly rose to prominence in Chattanooga political circles. In 1894, he challenged incumbent Henry Snodgrass for the Democratic nomination for the 3rd District seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. While Frazier had wide support, Snodgrass had more support from the delegates at the party&#x27;s convention, and won the nomination. Snodgrass was defeated by the Republican candidate, Foster V. Brown, in the general election, due in part to bitterness from Frazier&#x27;s supporters who did not support Snodgrass.

During the 1900 presidential race, Frazier served as the state&#x27;s at-large elector for the Democratic candidate, William Jennings Bryan. He canvassed across Tennessee on behalf of Bryan, gaining invaluable statewide political exposure.

==Governor==

In 1902, Frazier was the Democratic nominee for governor in the race to succeed Benton McMillin, who was not seeking reelection. His Republican opponent was Judge H. Tyler Campbell, who had won his party&#x27;s nomination with the support of party boss Representative Walter P. Brownlow. The 1902 gubernatorial campaign is remembered as the last in which the candidates canvassed the state via horse-drawn carriages. In the general election, which was marked by low turnout, Frazier won easily with 98,902 votes to 59,007 for Campbell, and 2,193 for Prohibition candidate R. S. Cheves. Democrats were the majority party in the state at the time, and benefitted by the low turnout.

Frazier sought to bring a business-like atmosphere to the state government, and demanded every department exercise frugality. He vetoed any bill that failed to meet his economic standards, including one that would have raised his own salary. The state had no floating debt during his tenure, and paid off over $600,000 of bonded debt.

Frazier considered public education a priority during his first term. One of the first pieces of legislation he signed was the Romine Bill, which stipulated that any unappropriated funds in the treasury be added to the public school fund. In 1904 alone, this generated more than $270,000 for the state&#x27;s public schools.

In 1903, Frazier signed the Adams Law, a pro-temperance measure sponsored by the Anti-Saloon League. The law extended the state&#x27;s &quot;Four Mile Law&quot;– which banned the sale of liquor within of a school– to all towns with populations of 5,000 or fewer people (the Four Mile Law originally applied only to rural areas). This effectively banned the sale of liquor in all but the state&#x27;s largest cities.

By 1903 whitecapping had become a problem in Tennessee and other southern states. Leaders feared this secret vigilante group was driving off both merchants and workers. When two African-American men were murdered in Needmore, a community in Marshall County, in August 1903, Frazier offered a reward for information, as the men&#x27;s lynching deaths were attributed to Whitecaps.

In February 1904, a coal miners&#x27; strike in the Coal Creek Valley threatened to erupt into a full-blown uprising, raising fears of a revival of the Coal Creek War, which had plagued the valley in the previous decade. Frazier traveled to the valley to meet with the miners, and managed to defuse the situation. Frazier also signed into law new mine safety standards in response to a string of mining accidents in previous years, most notably the Fraterville Mine disaster of 1902.

In the gubernatorial campaign of 1904, Republicans nominated Winchester mayor Jesse Littleton to challenge Frazier. In September, Frazier and Littleton engaged in a series of fierce debates, primarily over the Four Mile Law, which Littleton argued should extend to the entire state, while Frazier, not wanting to further agitate liquor interests, argued that larger cities should remain exempt. On election day, Frazier won easily, capturing 131,503 votes to 103,409 for Littleton.

==Senator and later life==

On March 9, 1905, a few weeks after the beginning of Frazier&#x27;s second term, Senator William B. Bate died, prompting a scramble to fill his vacant seat. Former Governor Robert Love Taylor had for years campaigned unsuccessfully for a Senate seat, and believed he should be next in line. Frazier, however, also wanted the Senate seat, and while Taylor was still out of state on a speaking tour, Frazier quickly convened the General Assembly and had himself elected, then resigned the governorship. The Speaker of the Tennessee Senate, John I. Cox (who had helped engineer Frazier&#x27;s election), succeeded him as governor.

Taylor was outraged by Frazier&#x27;s actions, and suggested that Frazier, Cox, and U.S. Senator Edward W. Carmack were conspiring to control the state Democratic Party. To appease Taylor&#x27;s supporters, the party allowed Taylor to face Carmack in a primary in 1906 (the first Senate primary in state history), which Taylor won. That same year, the Democratic Party refused to nominate Cox for reelection as governor.

As a senator, Frazier championed states&#x27; rights, and opposed most protective tariffs. He supported a federal income tax amendment and funding for highway construction. He campaigned for a second term in 1911, but state Democrats, irritated by the intra-party divisions created by his first election, refused to nominate him.

After leaving the Senate, Frazier returned to Chattanooga, where he practiced law with his son, James B. Frazier Jr. (1890–1978), in the firm, Frazier and Frazier. He died on March 28, 1937, and is buried in the city&#x27;s Forest Hills Cemetery.

==Family==

Frazier&#x27;s great-grandfather, Samuel Frazier, and grandfather, Abner Frazier, both fought at the Battle of Kings Mountain in 1780. Samuel Frazier was of Scottish descent, while his wife, Rebecca Julian, was of French Huguenot descent. An uncle of James B. Frazier, Dr. Beriah Frazier (1812–1886), served as Mayor of Chattanooga in 1841, and represented Knox County at the East Tennessee Convention of 1861.

Frazier married Louise Douglas Keith in 1883. They had four children: Anne, James Jr., Thomas, and Louise. James B. Frazier Jr. represented Tennessee&#x27;s 3rd congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1949 to 1963.

<doc id="908064" wikidata="Q7622390" url="?curid=908064" title="Straw that broke the camel's back">
<text>The idiom &quot;the straw that broke the camel&#x27;s back&quot; describes a minor or routine action that causes an unpredictably large and sudden reaction due to the cumulative effect of previous small actions. It alludes to the proverb &quot;it is the last straw that breaks the camel&#x27;s back&quot;.

This gives rise to the phrase &quot;the last straw&quot;, or &quot;the final straw&quot;, meaning that the last one in a line of unacceptable occurrences causes a seemingly sudden and strong reaction.

== Origins and early uses ==

The earliest known version of the expression comes in a theological debate on causality by Thomas Hobbes and John Bramhall in 1654–1684:
An essay of 1724 emphasizes not the fact of being the &quot;last&quot; cause, but rather of being a &quot;least&quot; cause, that is, a &quot;minor&quot; one:
Attested versions of the proverb include, in chronological order:

* &quot;It is the last feather that breaks the horse&#x27;s back&quot; (1677)
* &quot;It is the last straw that overloads the camel&quot;, mentioned as an &quot;Oriental proverb&quot; (1799)
* &quot;It was the last ounce that broke the back of the camel&quot; (1832)
* &quot;The last straw will break the camel&#x27;s back&quot; (1836)
* &quot;As the last straw breaks the laden camel&#x27;s back&quot; (1848)
* &quot;This final feather broke the camel&#x27;s back&quot; (1876)

Other variants are:

* &quot;The straw that broke the donkey&#x27;s back&quot;
* &quot;The last peppercorn breaks the camel&#x27;s back&quot;
* &quot;The melon that broke the monkey&#x27;s back&quot;
* &quot;The feather that broke the camel&#x27;s back&quot;
* &quot;The straw that broke the horse&#x27;s back&quot;
* &quot;The hair that broke the camel&#x27;s back&quot;
* &quot;The last ounce broke the camel&#x27;s back&quot;

==The last drop==

The same sentiment is also expressed by the phrase &quot;the last drop makes the cup run over&quot;, first found in English as &quot;When the Cup is brim full before, the last (though least) superadded drop is charged alone to be the cause of all the running over&quot; (1655).
The image of the last drop is also found in many other languages.

==Antecedents==

The phrase has been compared with Seneca&#x27;s discussion on why death is not to be feared. Starting with a mention of the commonplace &quot;we do not suddenly fall on death, but advance towards it by slight degrees; we die every day&quot; (&quot;non repente nos in mortem incidere, sed minutatim procedere; cotidie morimur&quot;), Seneca compares life to a water-clock:

It is not the last drop that empties the water-clock, but all that which previously has flowed out; similarly, the final hour when we cease to exist does not of itself bring death; it merely of itself completes the death-process. We reach death at that moment, but we have been a long time on the way.

&quot;Quemadmodum clepsydram non extremum stillicidium exhaurit, sed quicquid ante defluxit, sic ultima hora, qua esse desinimus, non sola mortem facit, sed sola consummat; tunc ad illam pervenimus, sed diu venimus.&quot;
In contrast to the imagery of the &quot;last straw&quot;, which emphasizes dramatic final result, Seneca emphasizes the continuity of the final hour of life with all the hours that have come before.

<doc id="908068" wikidata="Q7381469" url="?curid=908068" title="Russell Doern">
<text>Russell John &quot;Russ&quot; Doern (October 20, 1935 – February 19, 1987) was a Manitoba politician. He served as a cabinet minister in the New Democratic government of Edward Schreyer (1969–1977), but left the New Democratic Party in 1984.

He was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the son of Karl John Doern and Ruby Henne, and was educated there and at the University of Manitoba. In 1955, he came second in the shot put and discus at the Junior Canadian Track and Field Competitions. He taught English and history at high schools in Winnipeg from 1959 to 1966. In the early 1960s, Doern became involved in the province&#x27;s New Democratic Party organization.

Doern was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1966, for the northeastern Winnipeg riding of Elmwood. Like most other members of the NDP caucus, he believed that party leader Russell Paulley needed to be replaced before the next election. In 1968, he co-signed a letter which called for Edward Schreyer to lead the provincial party. Schreyer became party leader in 1969, and led the Manitoba NDP to its first-ever election victory later in the year.

Although left out of Schreyer&#x27;s initial cabinet, Doern was appointed a Minister without Portfolio on November 4, 1970. He was promoted to Minister of Public Works on September 9, 1971, and held this position until the defeat of the Schreyer government in 1977.

Initially regarded as a supporter of youth and the arts (he had tried to book John Lennon for a concert in 1970), Doern eventually became associated with the more conservative wing of the NDP. When Schreyer resigned as party leader in 1979, Doern campaigned to succeed him. His campaign made some appeals to social conservatism (he strongly opposed any government recognition of gay rights), and was not respected by the party establishment. At the party&#x27;s 1979 convention, he received the support of only 53 delegates, compared to 467 for winning candidate Howard Pawley.

In 1981, Doern published his memoirs from the Schreyer years, entitled &quot;Wednesdays Are Cabinet Days&quot;.

The NDP was returned to government in the provincial election of 1981, though Doern was not re-appointed to cabinet. He strongly opposed efforts by Premier Howard Pawley to legally entrench French-language services in the province (which he regarded as leading to official bilingualism), and created an organization called Manitoba Grassroots to coordinate opposition to the policy.

Doern left the NDP over this issue on March 7, 1984. In 1985, he published a book entitled &quot;The Battle Over Bilingualism&quot;, detailing his role in the controversy.

Doern ran as an Independent in the election of 1986. He polled a respectable 2006 votes, but was defeated by New Democratic candidate Jim Maloway.

Later in 1986, Doern ran an unsuccessful campaign to become mayor of Winnipeg, finishing second with 48,567 votes, against 78,998 for incumbent Bill Norrie. Doern&#x27;s campaign was not exclusively focused on anti-bilingualism; he also emphasized public safety concerns. He was criticized in &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; editorials as an opportunistic candidate who had previously shown little interest in municipal issues. Despite having left the NDP, Doern&#x27;s electoral strength remained focused in the party&#x27;s north-end stronghold.

According to reports from friends, Doern became extremely depressed after failing in his bid to become Mayor of Winnipeg. He wanted to return to active political service, but had few available options as an independent. Tory MLA Harry Enns has claimed that he saw Doern wandering aimlessly through the legislative buildings on several occasions during this period. Early in 1987, he made arrangements to host a radio talk-show on political affairs.

On February 19, 1987, Doern committed suicide at his cousin&#x27;s barn in Overstoneville, Manitoba, in the southeastern section of the province. He killed himself with a single shot to the chest, using a gun he had borrowed from a friend a few days earlier. Doern had stopped taking anti-depressant medication by this time, and was by all accounts distraught by the fact that he had little chance to return to political life.

<text>CATS (Computer Aided Transcription System) is an EDA software for mask data preparation (MDP) in integrated circuit design and manufacturing.

CATS receives tape out data output from the integrated circuit physical design step, most commonly in GDSII format, processes it, and converts into data that control the fabrication of photomasks used to manufacture the designed IC. CATS software tools generate photomask layers from input design layers and allow users to inspect the input and output data and verify its accuracy.

Originally it was developed by Transcription Enterprises, Ltd, acquired by Numerical Technologies, Inc. (2000). At the moment of acquisition, it was an industry standard for MDP operations, such as mask fracturing and mask inspection, with about 95% of market share. In its turn, Numeritech was acquired by Synopsys, Inc. (2003).

<text>Franeker (; ) is one of the eleven historical cities of Friesland and capital of the municipality of Waadhoeke. It is located north of the Van Harinxmakanaal and about west of Leeuwarden. As of 2023, it had 13,015 inhabitants. World Heritage Site the Eise Eisinga Planetarium, established in 1781, is located in the city.

==History==
===Early history===
Franeker was founded around 800 as a Carolingian stronghold. The name probably derives from &quot;Froon-acker&quot;, meaning &#x27;land of the lord/king&#x27;; the oldest street in the city is still called Froonacker. Beginning around the 11th century, Franeker developed into the administrative center of northern Westergoa.

Franeker received city rights in 1417, when it was recognised as an independent city and, through the (&#x27;Citizen&#x27;s letter&#x27;), formally separated from the grietenij .

===Saxon period===

At the end of the 15th century, Albert, Duke of Saxony established himself in Franeker, when he had taken over Friesland with the help of the Schieringers led by . On 12 May 1500, the city was besieged by an army of 16,000 dissatisfied Frisians during the , as a result of the high rents and taxes levied by Albert and his sons Henry and George of Saxony. Henry established his seat in the city of Franeker. The Frisians achieved nothing with the siege of the city because they were poorly trained and organised. Duke Albert of Saxony hastily assembled a large army to relieve Henry and the city of Franeker. Finally, the Frisians were defeated on 16 July 1500 and the city was relieved. On 26 March 1501, Henry IV of Saxony gave the city of Franeker a considerable (200 morgen) piece of salt marshland outside the dike, called the Franekerlanden. Three years later, Henry handed over the government of Friesland to his brother George.

Franeker seemed to become the capital of Friesland at the end of the 15th century. In 1504, however, the Saxons fled to Leeuwarden. After that, the city remained important to the Saxons for a long time, until Friesland was transferred as a possession to Charles V in 1524.

===University of Franeker===
When the Dutch Republic revolted against the Spanish Empire, Franeker chose the side of William of Orange early on. In 1579, Friesland joined the Union of Utrecht in the joint fight against Spain. In 1580, the States of Friesland decided that only the Reformed doctrine was permitted. In order to meet a growing demand for ministers, lawyers, and doctors, the States decided to found a university.

As such, a Protestant university, the University of Franeker, the oldest in the Netherlands after the University of Leiden, was established on 29 July 1585. The university was housed in the former monastery building of the Crosiers. At this Academy of Friesland, donated by the Frisian stadtholder William Louis, one could study theology, law, medicine, classical languages, philosophy, mathematics, and physics. Some notable students include William IV, Prince of Orange, Peter Stuyvesant, René Descartes, and Eise Eisinga. It was closed shortly after the incorporation of the Kingdom of Holland into the French Empire, when Napoleon Bonaparte closed the academy in 1811. A successor institution, the , was founded in 1815, but in 1847 it, too, closed.

===Recent history===
In 1984, the municipalities of Franeker and , as well as part of the municipality of Barradeel, were merged into the new municipality of Franekeradeel. 

On 1 January 2018, Franeker became the main town of the newly formed municipality of Waadhoeke. The town hall is located on the Harlingerstraatweg in Franeker.

== Geography ==

Franeker is located in the municipality of Waadhoeke in the northwest of the province of Friesland in the north of the Netherlands. It is east of the city of Harlingen, north of the Van Harinxmakanaal, south of the Wadden Sea coast, and about west of the provincial capital Leeuwarden.

== Demographics ==
As of 2023, the city of Franeker had a population of 13,015.

==Culture==
=== Museums ===

The Eise Eisinga Planetarium and the Museum Martena are museums located in the city. The Planetarium is an orrery built between 1774 and 1781 by the local wool carder Eise Eisinga to explain a conjunction of the planets and to help mitigate local fears of what would happen during the planets&#x27; alignment. Built in Eisinga&#x27;s own living room, it is the oldest continuously operating orrery in the world. In 2023, the Planetarium was officially designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Museum Martena, opened in 2006, is housed in the Martenahuis. This old was built in 1502 by order of and was the residence of Campegius Vitringa and Anna Maria van Schurman in the second half of the 17th century. The museum is devoted to the history of the city and the region.

===Windmill===
The windmill &quot;Arkens&quot; is a hollow post mill which has been restored. It originally stood in Arkens and was moved in 1972. It is the only windmill in the Netherlands equipped with &quot;Vlinderwieken&quot; ().

== Sports ==

Since 1852, Franeker has been the home of the , the most important tournament in Frisian handball.

Franeker is a regular host of the Frisian draughts competitions.

Being one of the Frisian cities, Franeker is also on the route of the &quot;Elfstedentocht&quot; (Eleven-cities Tour), an endurance skating event held at irregular intervals depending on weather conditions.

==Infrastructure==

Franeker railway station is a station on the NS line between Leeuwarden and Harlingen. It also had a station on the North Friesland Railway which was the terminus of a branch from Tzummarum. The line opened in October 1903 and closed in October 1933. The station building survives.

<text>Coherent information is an entropy measure used in quantum information theory. It is a property of a quantum state ρ and a quantum channel formula_1; intuitively, it attempts to describe how much of the quantum information in the state will remain after the state goes through the channel. In this sense, it is intuitively similar to the mutual information of classical information theory. The coherent information is written formula_2.

==Definition==
The coherent information is defined as formula_3 where formula_4 is the von Neumann entropy of the output and formula_5 is the entropy exchange between the state and the channel.

==History==
The coherent information was introduced by Benjamin Schumacher and Michael A. Nielsen in a 1996 paper &quot;Quantum data processing and error correction&quot;, which appeared in Physical Review A. The same quantity was independently introduced by Seth Lloyd in a paper called “The capacity of the noisy quantum channel” published in Physical Review A.

This includes the engine, transmission, drive shafts, differentials, and the final drive (drive wheels, continuous track as in military tanks or caterpillar tractors, propeller, etc.). Hybrid powertrains also include one or more electric traction motors that operate to drive the vehicle wheels. All-electric vehicles (&quot;electric cars&quot;) eliminate the engine altogether, relying solely on electric motors for propulsion. Occasionally the term powerplant is casually used to refer to the engine or, less often, the entire powertrain.

A motor vehicle&#x27;s driveline or drivetrain consists of the parts of the powertrain excluding the engine. It is the portion of a vehicle, after the prime mover, that changes depending on whether a vehicle is front-wheel, rear-wheel, or four-wheel drive, or less-common six-wheel or eight-wheel drive.

In a wider sense, the powertrain includes all of the components used to transform stored (chemical, solar, nuclear, kinetic, potential, etc.) energy into kinetic energy for propulsion purposes. This includes the utilization of multiple power-sources and non–wheel-based vehicles.

== Developments ==
The most recent developments in powertrain are driven by the electrification of it in multiple components. Electrical energy needs to be provided, usually this leads to larger batteries. Electric motors can be found as isolated component or as part of other elements, e.g. the axle. In hybrid powertrains the torque generated by the combustion engine and the electric motor have to be brought together and distributed to the wheels. The control of this process can be quite involved but the rewards are greatly improved acceleration and much lower emissions.

Powertrain development for diesel engines involves the following: exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), and advanced combustion. Spark ignition engine development include: fuel injection, including the gasoline direct injection variant, as well as improving volumetric efficiency by using multi-valves per cylinder, variable valve timing, variable length intake manifolds, and turbocharging. Changes also include new fuel qualities (no sulphur or aromates) to allow new combustion concepts. So-called &quot;combined combustion systems&quot; (CCV) or &quot;diesotto&quot; cycles are based on synthetic fuels (synthetic diesel, biomass to liquid (BTL) or gas to liquid (GTL)).

BEVs, FCEVs and PHEV powertrains are expected to reach cost parity with ICE powertrains in 2025.

== Key Components ==

The powertrain of a vehicle refers to the collection of components that generate power and deliver it to the wheels, enabling the vehicle to move. Powertrains can vary significantly between conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, hybrid vehicles (HEVs), and electric vehicles (EVs). Regardless of the type, the powertrain remains one of the most critical systems in any vehicle.

* Engine: The engine is the heart of the powertrain in conventional ICE vehicles. It converts fuel, such as gasoline or diesel, into mechanical energy through the process of combustion. Engines come in various forms, including internal combustion engines, which are the most common, and electric motors, which are predominant in EVs. Hybrid vehicles often combine both systems to maximize fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. Each engine type has its unique design and operational characteristics, but all aim to produce the torque required to propel the vehicle.

* Electric Motor and Inverter:In electric vehicles, the electric motor replaces the traditional engine, converting electrical energy into mechanical energy to drive the wheels. This motor is highly efficient and eliminates the need for some of the more complex components found in ICE vehicles, such as exhaust systems or fuel tanks. Inverters are critical in EVs, as they control the motor&#x27;s performance by regulating power output and enabling variable speeds. Together, the motor and inverter form the backbone of the electric powertrain.

* Transmission:The transmission is responsible for transferring mechanical energy from the engine or motor to the drivetrain. It ensures that the power generated by the engine is delivered to the wheels in the most efficient manner, adjusting for speed and load. There are several types of transmissions, including manual transmissions, where the driver shifts gears; automatic transmissions, which shift gears automatically; continuously variable transmissions (CVTs), which offer seamless acceleration; and dual-clutch transmissions (DCTs), known for their rapid gear changes and improved performance.

* Control Units:Modern powertrains are heavily dependent on electronic control units (ECUs) or powertrain control modules (PCMs). These systems monitor and optimize the performance of the engine, transmission, and other components. By analyzing data from sensors throughout the vehicle, ECUs ensure the powertrain operates at peak efficiency while also complying with emissions and performance standards. Control units are essential for advanced features like adaptive driving modes and predictive maintenance.

* Drivetrain:The drivetrain is the system that connects the transmission to the wheels, distributing power as needed. It includes key components such as the driveshaft, which transfers rotational power, the differential, which allows the wheels to rotate at different speeds for smoother cornering, and the axles, which deliver power directly to the wheels. The drivetrain configuration varies by vehicle type, with common setups being front-wheel drive (FWD), rear-wheel drive (RWD), and all-wheel drive (AWD) or four-wheel drive (4WD), each offering distinct advantages depending on the application.

== Manufacturing ==
The manufacturing of powertrain components and systems is important to industry, including the automotive and other vehicle sectors. Competitiveness drives companies to engineer and produce powertrain systems that over time are more economical to manufacture, higher in product quality and reliability, higher in performance, more fuel efficient, less polluting, and longer in life expectancy. In turn these requirements have led to designs involving higher internal pressures, greater instantaneous forces, and increased complexity of design and mechanical operation. The resulting designs in turn impose significantly more severe requirements on parts shape and dimension; and material surface flatness, waviness, roughness, and porosity. Quality control over these parameters is achieved through metrology technology applied to all of the steps in powertrain manufacturing processes.

== Frames and powertrains ==
In automotive manufacturing, the frame plus the &quot;running gear&quot; makes the chassis.

Later, a body (sometimes referred to as &quot;coachwork&quot;), which is usually not necessary for integrity of the structure, is built on the chassis to complete the vehicle. Commercial vehicle manufacturers may have &quot;chassis only&quot; and &quot;cowl and chassis&quot; versions that can be outfitted with specialized bodies. These include buses, motor homes, fire engines, ambulances, etc.

The frame plus the body makes a glider (a vehicle without a powertrain).

==Final drive==

The final drive is the last in the set of components which delivers torque to the drive wheels. In a road vehicle, it incorporates the differential. In a railway vehicle, it sometimes incorporates the reversing gear. Examples include the Self-Changing Gears RF 28 (used in many first-generation diesel multiple units of British Railways) and RF 11 used in the British Rail Class 03 and British Rail Class 04 diesel shunting locomotives.

== Variations ==
This section uses infographics to show a unified model with variations, the green wheels denote no traction, and the angled wheels denote steering.

6X4 means 6 wheel ends and 4 positions distribute power (power divider installed)

6X2 means 6 wheel ends and 2 positions distribute power (single axle drive)

4X0 means 4 wheel ends no power (Trailer axle)

4x2 means 4 Wheel ends, 2 Positions to distribute power

The 6 wheel ends can either be wide base singles or duals. Its about the outside of the wheels.

<doc id="908086" wikidata="Q15305109" url="?curid=908086" title="Fractionation">
<text>Fractionation is a separation process in which a certain quantity of a mixture (of gasses, solids, liquids, enzymes, or isotopes, or a suspension) is divided during a phase transition, into a number of smaller quantities (fractions) in which the varies according to a gradient. Fractions are collected based on differences in a specific property of the individual components. A common trait in fractionations is the need to find an optimum between the amount of fractions collected and the desired purity in each fraction. Fractionation makes it possible to isolate more than two components in a mixture in a single run. This property sets it apart from other separation techniques.

Fractionation is widely employed in many branches of science and technology. Mixtures of liquids and gasses are separated by fractional distillation by difference in boiling point. Fractionation of components also takes place in column chromatography by a difference in affinity between stationary phase and the mobile phase. In fractional crystallization and fractional freezing, chemical substances are fractionated based on difference in solubility at a given temperature. In cell fractionation, cell components are separated by difference in mass.

== Of natural samples ==

=== Bioassay-guided fractionation ===
A typical protocol to isolate a pure chemical agent from natural origin is step-by-step separation of extracted components based on differences in their bioassay-guided fractionation physicochemical properties, and assessing the biological activity, followed by next round of separation and assaying. Typically, such work is initiated after a given crude extract is deemed &quot;active&quot; in a particular in vitro assay.

=== Blood fractionation ===

The process of blood fractionation involves separation of blood into its main components. Blood fractionation refers generally to the process of separation using a centrifuge (centrifugation), after which three major blood components can be visualized: plasma, buffy coat and erythrocytes (blood cells). These separated components can be analyzed and often further separated.

=== Of food ===

Fractionation is also used for culinary purposes, as coconut oil, palm oil, and palm kernel oil are fractionated to produce oils of different viscosities, that may be used for different purposes. These oils typically use fractional crystallization (separation by solubility at temperatures) for the separation process instead of distillation. Mango oil is an oil fraction obtained during the processing of mango butter.

Milk can also be fractionated to recover the milk protein concentrate or the milk basic proteins fraction.

<doc id="908088" wikidata="Q1947593" url="?curid=908088" title="W. Brian Harland">
<text>Walter Brian Harland (22 March 1917 – 1 November 2003) was a British geologist at the Department of Geology, later University of Cambridge Department of Earth Sciences, England, from 1948 to 2003. He was a leading figure in geological exploration and research in Svalbard, organising over 40 Cambridge Spitsbergen Expeditions (CSE) and in 1975 founded the Cambridge Arctic Shelf Programme (CASP) as a research institute to continue this work. He was first secretary of the International Geological Correlation Programme from 1969 until UNESCO could take over in 1972, and was a driving force in setting criteria and standards in stratigraphy and producing 4 editions of the geological time scale in 1964, 1971, 1982 and 1989. He also edited the international Geological Magazine for 30 years. In 1968, he was honoured with the Royal Geographical Society Gold Medal for Arctic exploration and research.

== Background ==
===Early life and education===
Walter Brian Harland was born 22 March 1917 in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, the son of Walter Ernest Harland (1880-1947), auctioneer and estate agent, and his wife, Alice Marian, née Whitfield (1883-1954). He grew up exploring many of the geological features of Yorkshire, and was taught mapping at primary school. As an 11 year old at the Downs School, Colwall, later The Downs Malvern he carried out a field study and geologically mapped the Malvern Hills. When he was thirteen and at Bootham School in York he discovered a near complete skeleton of Steneosaurus Brevior, an 11 foot long crocodile fossilized in the Jurassic rocks of the North Yorkshire coast, which was removed to the Natural History Museum, London. In 1935 he went to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he graduated with double first-class honours in natural sciences (geology) in 1938.

===Personal life===
Brian became a Quaker when he was an undergraduate, starting a lifelong interest in the relationship between religion, philosophy, and science. He married Elisabeth Lewis in 1942 and they had one son and three daughters. Brian Harland died in Cambridge 1 November 2003.

===Academic career===
After graduating, he started on a PhD at Cambridge to investigate the deep structure of eastern England, using explosion seismology; this ended with the outbreak of the Second World War. In 1946 he returned to the Department of Geology, later University of Cambridge Department of Earth Sciences, England, as Demonstrator till 1948. He was Lecturer from 1948-66, Reader in Tectonic Geology from 1966–84 and Emeritus Reader in Tectonic Geology from 1984 to 2003. He was a fellow of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge from 1950–84 and Life Fellow from 1984-2003.

===Conscientious objection/West China===
Harland was a conscientious objector during the Second World War. After working on a farm near Scarborough, he spent 1942 to 1946 with the Friends Service Council in West China Union University, Chengdu, later Chengdu University of Technology, where he ran a Department of Geology. During this time, he spent two summers at the Bailie School in Shandan, Northwest China, advising the industrial co-operative there on natural resources. After the thaw in relations with China, following the Cultural Revolution, he renewed his relationship with what had become Chengdu University of Technology, and became a visiting professor.

===Friendship with Joseph Needham===
He maintained a lifelong friendship with Joseph Needham, from his time as a student at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge when he invited the biochemist (already a college Fellow of 11 years standing) to address the College&#x27;s Natural Science Club. They met again in China during 1942 to 1946 when they were both based in Sechwan, now known as Sichuan.

After the war they both returned to Cambridge where Needham became the leading scholar of the history of Chinese science. Harland became a founder trustee of the Needham Research Institute and &quot;gave&quot; Needham&#x27;s eulogy at his memorial service.

== Work ==

===Fieldwork===
Field education was of utmost importance to Harland who saw it as a vital part of a university education in geological sciences. He was particularly associated with training first year students in the varied geology of the Isle of Arran. He pioneered the incorporation of fieldwork as a regular part of the Cambridge curriculum: and from 1952 for more than 30 years, led some 2000 students, on Arran fieldtrips. Here young scientists were trained to look at rocks in situ and make simple observations, and then to argue about what they saw ignoring all preconceptions. Before this time field trips had been run by the Sedgwick Club, an undergraduate society. On Cambridge Spitsbergen Expeditions well over 300 members of University of Cambridge Department of Earth Sciences had further training in field skills: making empirical observations and collecting specimens and data.

===Arctic Geology and Cambridge Spitsbergen Expeditions===
Harland was continuously involved with Arctic geological exploration and research. He first went to Spitsbergen in 1938 as part of a six-man geographical expedition. Spitsbergen is the largest and most mountainous island of the Norwegian high arctic archipelago known as Svalbard. He saw the geological potential of Svalbard for both research and educational work with its superb rock exposures showing a more or less complete stratigraphic succession from late Precambrian to the Palaeogene.

From 1948 he developed and directed the Cambridge Spitsbergen Expeditions (CSE) from the Cambridge University Department of Geology (later, the Department of Earth Sciences). The CSE became the Cambridge Svalbard Exploration research group and later developed into the Cambridge Arctic Shelf Programme, CASP. There were forty three summer seasons of expeditionary fieldwork, of which he led twenty nine. More than 300 undergraduates and about fifty graduate collaborators were involved over the years. Svalbard proved an excellent training ground for future geologists producing around thirty PhD theses and over three hundred scientific papers. Many senior figures in academia, industry and polar work gained early field experience on these expeditions.

Harland&#x27;s work in the Arctic is commemorated by Harland Huset, the UK&#x27;s Arctic Research Station located in Ny-Ålesund. The ice field ′Harlandisen′ in Spitsbergen is also named in his honour. His wife Elisabeth accompanied him on 13 expeditions and both were awarded the polar medal.

===Survey field work and mapping===
Cambridge Spitsbergen Expeditions carried out a programme of systematic geological and stratigraphic investigations. Early fieldwork involved transport in small open boats, man hauled sledges and much pack carrying to the study area, using primitive equipment and often in harsh conditions. Expeditions from 1949 to 1960 spent much effort on a simultaneous geological and topographical survey using map triangulation to fix the position of mountain tops.

He was awarded a Founder&#x27;s Medal from the Royal Geographical Society in 1968 for his exploration and mapping work. A range of objects used by Harland in survey field work since the 1930s was donated to the Whipple Museum of the History of Science, Cambridge in 2003.

===Svalbard Geology===
From 1961 he extended the Svalbard project by negotiating financial support from oil companies: this enabled a programme of field investigations in wider areas, supported by better transport including a series of motor boats and occasional chartered helicopters. Local successions of rock units and fossils were described and correlations made in accord with the developing stratigraphic standards, providing the data for geotectonic interpretation and historical synthesis. Harland and colleagues’ research into Svalbard geology culminated in the comprehensive ′The Geology of Svalbard′ published in 1997.

===Cambridge Arctic Shelf Programme (CASP)===
In 1975 Harland formed the Cambridge Arctic Shelf Programme (CASP) as an extension of Cambridge Svalbard Exploration. The objective was field and literature based geological investigations into key aspects of the whole Arctic and surrounding areas, financed by subscriptions from the oil and gas industry. In 1988 CASP was incorporated as a non-profit research institute allied to the Department of Earth Sciences, Cambridge University. Its prime objective continued to be independent research, publication and education, while it increased its scope for geo-scientific research to China and Antarctica and other areas far beyond the Arctic. In the year of his death in 2003 CASP employed some twenty-five staff.

===Information Management===
Harland believed in the importance of preserving information and making it available. From his 1949 expedition onwards he operated a universal system for numbering localities, samples and photographs, and this provided the central basis for much collaborative work. Observations and materials collected were the property of the group and belonged to University of Cambridge.

A sophisticated information database, developed out of Harland&#x27;s extensive library and filing systems, provided the cornerstone of literature based research for CSE and CASP. He developed Georecords, a system where pieces of information were regarded as standard units that could be preserved and handled in a standardised way. A series of paper forms were developed to support the standardisation of geological data extracted from the literature and geologists were employed to complete the forms. These data were then entered into a fully normalized database management system. Work using this system was extensively used, particularly in projects in China and Canada.

===Continental Drift===
Harland was keen on continental drift since reading Alfred Wegener as a schoolboy and advocated the theory in a talk to his school as a 15 year old. At Cambridge University he found an establishment that was hostile to the idea which was held to be inherently impossible. As a member of staff after the war, when the majority opinion was still opposed to it, he told students to keep an open mind: by 1964 models favouring continental drift became widely accepted.

Spitsbergen was a key element in some of the earliest speculations of continental drift: attempts to make sense of the field data led to hypotheses which could explain the relation between Spitsbergen and Greenland. At the 1964 Royal Society two day Symposium on Continental drift, Harland presented research on the tectonic evolution of the Arctic North Atlantic region. He looked at the history of the movements of these arctic terranes and at their ‘fit’ during the Caledonian orogeny. He described how substantial transcurrent, or strike slip, faulting provided the best explanation on their relative positions. At the end of 1964 he visited Beijing, Moscow and Leningrad where he again presented this research and argued for a theory of Continental drift. Over the following decades, Harland and colleagues used field data for developing models describing Svalbard&#x27;s terranes and fault systems, which were important in understanding the tectonic evolution of the North Atlantic Region.

===Palaeomagnetism===
Harland was using palaeomagnetism before it became widely used and more sophisticated. With his student Derek Bidgood he made the first attempt, in 1958, to examine the palaeomagnetism of Precambrian glacial deposits, using rock samples collected in Greenland and Norway. The admittedly ′not very good′ palaeomagnetic results indicated that the Precambrian tillite formations had been deposited at low latitudes near the equator of the time. This contributed to his postulation that there had been a major Precambrian ice-age, with ice sheets or floating icebergs carrying the erratic blocks now embedded in the tillite, extending over most or all of the globe. There was the associated implication that the relevant landmasses had changed dramatically in latitude since the Precambrian indicated continental drift.

===Global Late Precambrian Glaciations===
Harland argued that there had been severe global glaciations in late Precambrian times and the evidence he presented was to form the foundations of Snowball Earth theory. His views were informed by extensive fieldwork on the glacial marine deposits in the Hecla Hoek strata in Svalbard.

He showed that evidence of late Precambrian global glaciations was remarkably widespread by gathering evidence from all the continents of the world except the Antarctic. He argued that glacial tillites had been deposited at tropical latitudes, appealing for support of his and Derek Bidgoods’ palaeomagnetic work. He described the evidence of glacial deposits interrupting strata suggestive of warm conditions. With this evidence he also claimed that a general theory of continental drift must now be accepted. He collaborated with palaeontologist Martin Rudwick, who described how an episode of almost glacial global conditions had been followed by an altered climate and environment which made possible the proliferation of animal life in Cambrian times.

When he presented his paper on evidence for a late Precambrian ice age, at the NATO conference in January 1963, it was not well received; attention was drawn by others to widespread evidence of aqueous deposition. It was not until the 1990s that the idea was more generally accepted, when Paul F. Hoffman and colleagues, argued that several such &quot;Snowball Earth&quot; episodes had occurred towards the end of Precambrian history.

===Collision Zones===
Harland investigated mountain belts and the relationship between stresses in the Earth and the building of the mountains. His field work and research in Svalbard looked closely at the Hecla Hoek rocks, a great geosyncline and part of the complex sedimentation belts of Europe, Greenland, and America. The main phase of the Caledonian orogeny in Svalbard deformed this geosyncline in intense fashion, followed by further phases of mountain building. He had ideas on deformation and flow of matter, and developed the concept of tectonic regimes to specify the symmetry and orientation of bulk deformation for use in tectonic analysis.

He coined the word ′transpression′ to convey the idea that many mountains have resulted from oblique convergence of the margins of the belt, rather than simple, vice-like compression perpendicular to the length of the belt. He also showed that continued transpression or compression could result in extrusion of the core of the belt, parallel to its length. &quot;Transtension&quot;, with pull apart basins in zones of oblique extension, was a natural compliment.

===Iapetus Ocean Named===
In 1972 he named the Iapetus Ocean, when writing about the closure of this ocean area, to avoid confusion with the Proto-Atlantic Ocean. The ancient ocean Iapetus, existed before Devonian times, between 600 and 400 million years ago, and its closure caused the deformation of bordering geosynclines and the formation of the Arctic Caledonides. It had been known as the Proto-Atlantic Ocean, but that name implied the initial stages of the current Atlantic Ocean which began opening up some 200 million years later. The term is derived from Greek mythology where Iapetus is the brother of Okeanus and Tethys and father of Atlas from whose name the word Atlantis is derived.

===Stratigraphy and Time Scales===
Harland was a leading figure in compiling information on geological time scales and their ongoing development. He saw there was an urgent need to produce reliable time scales and provide organised high quality data for the scientific community. He produced four editions of the geologic time scale starting with the Geological Society of London 1964 time scale and its 1971 supplement. In the influential A Geologic Time Scale 1982, second edition 1989, the chronometric scale, based on units of duration, is calibrated with the chronostratic scale, based on a scale of rock sequences with standardised reference points, to form the geochronogic scale.

He was a key protagonist of the International Geological Correlation Programme (IGCP) and was its first secretary from 1969 to 1972, when a professional secretariat in UNESCO took over. He was committed to raising standards of scientific clarity and precision and on standardising the international chronostratic scale. Arising out of this he initiated two projects: the Precambrian Cambrian Boundary Project and the Pre-Pleistocene Tillite Project, which concluded with a volume of over 211 contributions. His prime stratigraphic interest was the working group on Terminal Precambrian systems with their tillites. He was Chairman of the Stratigraphy Committee of the Geological Society of London (GSSC) 1969-1973 and served on the International Sub-commission for Stratigraphy Classification (ISSC).

===Earth science publications===
Apart from being a prolific writer and collaborator himself, Harland promoted and facilitated the publication of geological research. For over 30 years from 1956 to 1988, he edited the Geological Magazine: the international journal published bi-monthly by the Cambridge University Press.
As Honorary Secretary of the Geological Society of London from 1963 to 1970 he led plans for the Society to become a centre for collaborative research. He initiated a series of multi-contribution books, which led to the Society&#x27;s flagship series of Special Publications that had by his death in 2003, produced more than 200 volumes. From 1966 to 1981 he was Chairman of the Editorial Board of the Earth Science Series at Cambridge University Press, and continued on the Board until 1986.

===Administration===
Harland was thoroughly involved in administration throughout his career. He was secretary of the Department of Geology, later University of Cambridge Department of Earth Sciences from 1946 to 1966,
and undertook all aspects of administration for two Woodwardian Professors Woodwardian Professors, W.B.R.King and Oliver Bulman. From 1947 to 1964 he served on the Board of Faculty of Geography and Geology and also the Degree Committee and Appointments Committee at the University. He served on the Scott Polar Research Institute, Committee of Management from 1953 to 1957, when it was taken over by the University, and then continued to serve on its advisory committee. He was Librarian at the Department of Geology from 1968 to 1977 and also built up an extensive personal library. He regularly worked 14 hours a day or more.

== Collections and Archives ==
Some 60,000 specimens of rocks, fossils and core samples collected during the Cambridge Svalbard period are now in the care of the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences. These include igneous and metamorphic rocks as well as structural, geochemical, geophysical and subsurface samples. Fossils were also collected during the expeditions along with the rock not only for taxonomy but for their environmental significance and tectonic importance.

The records of the Cambridge Svalbard Exploration Collection (ref. CSEC) are also at the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences. The collection contains accounting records, administration files, expedition notes, and equipment records which all relate to work undertaken in Svalbard from 1949 until 1992. Much of this material includes far more information than has been previously published about the expeditions or the work undertaken.

Most of the expedition records are organized on the twinlock filing system – and include administrative papers, logs of each party, bulletins, accounts, as well as specimen, station, negative, and photograph catalogues, and copies of field notes. Individual field notebooks include diary entries, observations, details of specimens, and sketches. These were written and maintained by each individual and later amalgamated by Brian after each expedition (and its subsequent research) was completed.

The collection also includes glass plate photographs, miscellaneous tapes, photograph albums, offprints of articles, maps and plans, index cards &amp; notes (specimen catalogues), curation reports (1990s), and some objects. There are also a series of records (reports) of the Norsk-Cambridge Svalbard Expeditions (NCSE) and Cambridge Archive Shelf Programme (CASP). A collection-level description is available on the Archives Hub

The CBLDF is supported by many big names of the industry; over the years, its board of directors has included Larry Marder, Ted Adams, Reginald Hudlin, Gene Luen Yang, Chris Staros, Peter David, Neil Gaiman, Paul Levitz, Milton Griepp, Steve Geppi, and many other industry figures. &quot;Fund Comics&quot;, &quot;More Fund Comics&quot;, and &quot;Even More Fund Comics&quot; are compilations of short work by famous artists sold to support the CBLDF. Additionally, Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab offers a line of perfumes whose profits go directly to the CBLDF. Popular artists such as comedian Bill Hader, cartoonist Jeff Smith, and comic book artist Frank Miller have expressed support for it.

The CBLDF is a sponsor of Banned Books Week, and also works with libraries, helping to keep graphic novels on their shelves. In the past they have partnered with such organizations as the Kids Right to Read Project, the American Library Association, and the Office of Intellectual Freedom as part of this mission.

==History==

The Comic Book Legal Defense Fund began as a means to pay for the legal defense of Friendly Frank&#x27;s comic shop manager Michael Correa, who was arrested in 1986 on charges of distributing obscenity. The comic books deemed obscene were &quot;Omaha the Cat Dancer&quot;, &quot;The Bodyssey&quot;, &quot;Weirdo&quot;, and &quot;Bizarre Sex&quot;. Kitchen Sink Press released an art portfolio of pieces donated by comics artists; proceeds were donated to Correa&#x27;s defense. First Amendment attorney Burton Joseph defended Friendly Frank&#x27;s and ultimately had the conviction overturned. Denis Kitchen officially incorporated the CBLDF in 1990 as a non-profit charitable organization with capital left over from Correa&#x27;s defense fund, and Burton Joseph became their legal counsel in 1996. Since then, the Fund and Burton Joseph have provided advice and legal assistance in many cases and incidents. In 1991, the CBLDF was honoured with the Bob Clampett Humanitarian Award.

In 2002, Charles Brownstein became the executive director of the CBLDF.

The Fund publishes a quarterly newsletter called &quot;Busted!: the official newsletter of the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund&quot;. 

On September 29, 2011, it was announced that the CBLDF acquired intellectual property rights of the Comics Code Authority seal from the now defunct Comics Magazine Association of America; the sale coincided with Banned Books Week. The CBLDF intends to use the seal in merchandise through licensing agreements, with proceeds from the licenses benefitting the CBLDF.

The CBLDF works independently and with coalitions to defend against unconstitutional legislation. CBLDF works with the Media Coalition, along with: The American Booksellers for Free Expression Group at ABA, Association of American Publishers, Inc., Authors Guild, Entertainment Software Association, Freedom to Read Foundation, Motion Picture Association of America, Inc., and Recording Industry Association of America, Inc. They were active plaintiffs against internet filters in libraries and more recently in 2012, a Utah bill that wanted to censor internet speech, which the CBLDF was able to help stop.

Since 2008, the CBLDF has published an annual comic book, &quot;The CBLDF Liberty Annual&quot;, to which many major artists and writers, including J. Michael Straczynski, Garth Ennis, and Richard Corben, have contributed.

== Background and Historical Context ==
In the late 1940s and 1950s, comic books faced significant public scrutiny and moral panic in the United States. This era witnessed widespread comic book burnings, spearheaded by community and religious groups who feared the impact of comic book content on youth. A pivotal figure in this movement was psychiatrist Dr. Fredric Wertham, whose work &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot; argued that comic books were a negative influence on children, leading to juvenile delinquency. Wertham&#x27;s conclusions significantly influenced public perception and even led to a U.S. Senate inquiry into the comic book industry. The climate of concern and censorship created during this period underscored the need for legal defense and advocacy for the comic book industry, a role that the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund would come to fulfill in later years. This historical context highlights the complex cultural and legal challenges faced by the comic book industry and underscores the importance of organizations like the CBLDF in protecting and promoting free expression in comic art.

== Controversy ==
In June 2020, CBLDF Executive Director Charles Brownstein resigned following, as described in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;:renewed pressure from the comic book industry surrounding a sexual assault from 2005... Brownstein assaulted comic book creator Taki Soma at Mid-Ohio Con in November, 2005, in an incident that was reported to police without leading to an arrest... Brownstein, who characterized the incident as &quot;a stupid, drunken prank, of which I&#x27;m ashamed,&quot; remained in place with the CBLDF following what was described as an independent investigation carried out on behalf of the organization.&quot;Polygon&quot; reported that &quot;multiple comics creators&quot;, including Brian Michael Bendis, Al Ewing, Pia Guerra, and James Tynion IV, &quot;announced they would no longer be working with the CBLDF — or spoke publicly about how they had already stopped working with the organization — because of Brownstein&#x27;s conduct&quot;.

In the following week, three members of the board also stepped down: Jeff Abraham, Katherine Keller, and Paul Levitz. &quot;All three leave days after it emerged that Brownstein had been abusive to others during his tenure in charge of the non-profit organization... with the organization taking the unprecedented move of releasing former employee Shy Allot from a non-disclosure agreement signed in 2010 so that she could come forward with her experiences&quot;. CBLDF issued a statement on June 29, 2020:
In July 2020, &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; reported that &quot;under Brownstein&#x27;s tenure, the CBLDF drew criticism for defending Milo Yiannopoulos, while not intervening to defend 11 creators who were slapped with a defamation suit after accusing small-press comics creator Cody Pickrodt of rape and sexual harassment.&quot;

==Programs==
The CBLDF creates toolkits that are available for librarians and others to use on the website. They also give lectures and presentations &quot;at comic book and anime conventions, library and book trade conferences, universities, and symposiums in the United States and around the world.&quot;

==Notable cases==
*1986: Michael Correa, store manager at Friendly Frank&#x27;s, a comic store in Lansing, Illinois, was charged with possession and sale of obscene material, after over 100 comic books were seized, including copies of &quot;Omaha the Cat Dancer&quot;. He was convicted, but the conviction was overturned on appeal. Funds donated to the appeal exceeded costs, and the remainder went towards founding the CBLDF.
*1991: Comic artist Paul Mavrides protested against a resolution by the State of California to levy a sales tax on comic strips and comic books. He challenged the law in court, with assistance from the CBLDF, arguing that the comic strip is a communications medium that should be classed with books, magazines, and newspapers (which are not subject to sales taxes due to First Amendment provisions). In 1997, a ruling in Mavrides&#x27; favor was handed down by the California State Board of Equalization.
*1994: Florida-based underground comic book artist Mike Diana was convicted in March for obscenity stemming from his self-published &quot;Boiled Angel&quot;. He was sentenced to three years probation, 1248 hours of community service, a $3000 fine, was banned from having contact with minors, and was forced to undergo a journalistic ethics course and a psychiatric evaluation at his own expense. After relocating to New York City to serve out his sentence, he performs his community service hours—working for the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund.
*2000: Comic book artist Kieron Dwyer was sued by Starbucks Coffee for parodying their famous mermaid logo within his comic book &quot;Lowest Common Denominator.&quot; Although the judge ruled that Starbucks could not sue a parody and the case settled out of court, Dwyer was forced to comply with the ruling that he could no longer use his logo for its confusing similarity to that of Starbucks.
*2002: The &quot;Castillo v. Texas&quot; case centered around Jesus Castillo, an employee of a comic book store in Dallas, Texas, who was charged with two counts of &quot;display of obscenity&quot;, and convicted for one, after selling adult comics to an adult undercover police officer.
*2005: Rome, Georgia comics retailer Gordon Lee was charged with distributing obscene material to a minor, after a child obtained an anthology comic containing brief nudity in an excerpt of &quot;The Salon&quot; on Halloween. A mistrial was called in 2007, and the case was finally dismissed in April 2008.
*2008: &quot;United States v. Handley&quot;; A 38-year-old Iowa comic collector named Christopher Handley was prosecuted under obscenity charges. The defense was led by Eric Chase, who was assisted by the CBLDF as a consultant.
*2010: &quot;R v Matheson&quot;; 27-year-old Ryan Matheson was flying from the United States to Canada when customs officials searched his personal belongings and found manga on his computer, which the officer considered to be child pornography. Brandon had been falsely charged with the possession and importation of &quot;child pornography&quot; by the Canadian government. The CBLDF assisted by raising funds for the case. The Crown eventually withdrew all criminal charges.

<doc id="908106" wikidata="Q830031" url="?curid=908106" title="Sophrosyne">
<text>Sophrosyne () is an ancient Greek concept of an ideal of excellence of character and soundness of mind, which when combined in one well-balanced individual leads to other qualities, such as temperance, moderation, prudence, purity, decorum, and self-control. An adjectival form is &quot;sophron&quot;.

It is similar to the concepts of () of Chinese Confucianism and () of Indian thought.

==Ancient Greek literature==
In Ancient Greek literature, sophrosyne is considered an important quality and is sometimes contrasted with hubris. A noted example of this occurs in Homer&#x27;s &quot;The Iliad&quot;. When Agamemnon decides to take the queen Briseis away from Achilles, it is seen as Agamemnon behaving with hubris and lacking sophrosyne. In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Odysseus avoids being turned into an animal by Circe the enchantress by means of a magical herb, moly (symbolizing, by some accounts, sophrosyne), given to him by Athena (Wisdom) and Hermes (Reason).

Heraclitus&#x27;s fragment 112 states:

Themes connected with sophrosyne and hubris figure prominently in plays of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. Sophrosyne is recognized as a virtue, although debased forms of it, like prudery, are criticized. Sophrosyne is a theme in the play &quot;Hippolytus&quot; by Euripides, in which sophrosyne is represented by the goddess Artemis and is personified by the character Hippolytus.

===Goddess===
The poet Theognis of Megara mentions Sophrosyne as among the daimona that were released from Pandora&#x27;s box.

&lt;poem&gt;Hope is the only good god remaining among mankind;
the others have left and gone to Olympus.
Trust, a mighty god has gone, Restraint (&quot;Sophrosyne&quot;) has gone from men,
and the Graces, my friend, have abandoned the earth.&lt;/poem&gt;

===Plato===
Sophrosyne is an important topic for Plato. It is the main subject of the dialogue &quot;Charmides&quot;, wherein several definitions are proposed but no conclusion reached; however in the dramatic context it connotes moral purity and innocence. An etymological meaning of sophrosyne as &quot;preservation of thoughtfulness&quot; is proposed in &quot;Cratylus&quot; 411e. The ability to manage with temperance and with justice (σωφρόνως καὶ δικαίως) is offered as a definition of virtue in the Meno (73a). Plato&#x27;s view of sophrosyne is related to Pythagorean (&quot;Republic&quot; 430e−432a, 442c) and closely linked with Plato’s tripartite division of the soul: sophrosyne is the harmonious moderation of the appetitive and spirited parts of the soul by the rational part (e.g., &quot;Phaedrus&quot; 237c−238e).

===Aristotle===
Aristotle included discussions of sophrosyne in his pioneering system of virtue ethics.

Aristotle believed sophrosyne described &quot;a mean with regard to pleasures,&quot; distinct from self-indulgence on the one hand, or perhaps anhedonia on the other. Like courage, sophrosyne is a virtue concerning our discipline of &quot;the irrational parts of our nature&quot; (fear, in the case of courage; desire, in the case of sophrosyne).

His discussion is found in the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; Book III, chapters 10–12, and concludes in this way:
And so the appetites of temperate men (σώφρωνος) should be in harmony with their reason; for the aim of both is that which is noble: the temperate man (σώφρων) desires what he ought, and as he ought, and when he ought; and this again is what reason prescribes. This, then, may be taken as an account of sophrosynes (σωφροσύνης).
As with virtue generally, sophrosyne is a sort of habit, acquired by practice. It is a state of character, not a passion or a faculty, specifically a disposition to choose the mean between excess and deficit. The mean is hard to attain, and is grasped by perception, not by reasoning.

Pleasure in doing virtuous acts is a sign that one has attained a virtuous disposition. Sophrosyne is the alignment of our desires with our enlightened self-interest, such that we desire to do what is best for our own flourishing.

===After Aristotle===
For the Stoic, Zeno of Citium, sophrosyne is one of the four chief virtues. Later Stoics like Musonius Rufus, Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius took a practical view of sophrosyne and share a definition of it as the restraint of the appetites. 

Demophilus, a Pythagorean philosopher of uncertain date, wrote:

Cicero considered four Latin terms to translate sophrosyne: (temperance), (moderateness), (modesty), and (frugality). Through the writings of Lactantius, St. Ambrose and St. Augustine, the virtue&#x27;s meaning as temperance or &quot;proper mixture&quot; became the dominant view in subsequent Western European thought.

Sophrosyne, according to St. Thomas Aquinas, is the fourth and final cardinal virtue.

It is also mentioned in the work &quot;On Virtues&quot; () by Georgios Gemistos Plethon.

<text>Kleine Freiheit (international title: &quot;A Little Bit of Freedom&quot;) is a 2003 film by Kurdish director Yüksel Yavuz about the friendship (and later relationship) between two teenage boys who are illegal immigrants in Germany.

== Plot ==
Baran (Cagdas Bozkurt) is a young Kurd who was sent to Hamburg after his parents, who had helped Kurdish rebels, were betrayed and subsequently killed by the Turkish militia. Now that Baran is 16, he is no longer allowed to stay in Germany and faces the bleak prospect of getting deported back.

Baran meets Chernor (Leroy Delmar), an African boy who has the same problem and trafficks drugs to make some money.

Things get even more complicated when Baran spots the traitor of his family and wants to kill him. However, the man pleads for his life and Baran spares him. Finally, both Cherno and Baran, who had made a desperate attempt to free Cherno, are arrested by the police.

== Critical reaction ==
In 2003, it was shown at the Cannes Film Festival.

The movie was critically well-received, particularly because of its accurate depiction of the Turkish–Kurdish conflict and the acting prowess of the nonprofessional actors. Cagdas Bozkurt won an acting prize at the Ankara film festival, while the movie won a viewers&#x27; choice award in Istanbul (the International Istanbul Film Festival) and it won the &#x27;Grand Prix&#x27; at the Ankara International film festival.

&quot;Kleine Freiheit&quot;, the German title of the movie, (&quot;Little Freedom&quot;, translated literally) is a wordplay on &quot;Große Freiheit&quot; (literally &quot;Great Freedom&quot;), the rather famous name of a street in the red light St. Pauli district where the plot is set.

<text>The Antonov An-8 (NATO reporting name: Camp) is a Soviet-designed twin-turboprop, high-wing light military transport aircraft.

==Development==
In December 1951, OKB-153 initiated the design of a twin-engined assault transport aircraft, designated DT-5/8 (&quot;Desahntno-Trahnsportnyy [samolyot]&quot; – assault transport aircraft), to be powered by two Kuznetsov TV-2 turboprop engines, and fitted with a large rear cargo door to allow vehicles to be driven straight into the hold. On 11 December 1953, the Soviet Council of Ministers issued directive No.2922-1251 to the Antonov OKB, requiring them to build a twin-turboprop transport aircraft derived from the DT-5/8. Bearing the in-house designation Izdeliye P the resulting aircraft had a high wing carrying two turboprop engines, atop a rectangular-section fuselage which could carry 60 troops or 40 passengers. Alternatively. the aircraft could carry a range of vehicles (including ASU-57 assault guns, BTR-40 or BTR-152 armoured personnel carriers) or artillery pieces. The aircraft was fitted with a tricycle undercarriage with main gear units housed in pods on either side of the fuselage, and an upswept rear fuselage providing clearance of the tail unit for loading and unloading.

The aircraft made its first flight on 11 February 1956 from Sviatoshyn Airfield, Kyiv and made its public debut at the Aviation Day air display at Tushino Airfield on 18 August that year. Following State acceptance trials, production was not recommended due to poor spin characteristics, directional stability and control issues, nosewheel shimmy, poor controllability when landing in crosswinds above 6 m/s (12 kn) and also phugoid oscillations in all three axes which were difficult to control and made piloting the prototype tiring. As well as the aerodynamic faults, the TV-2 engines were unsuitable, being unstable at high altitudes and difficult to start, as well as having a short service life.

The Antonov OKB set about rectifying these faults with increased-area vertical and horizontal tail surfaces, anti-spin strakes on the upper rear fuselage sides, deleting the wing leading-edge slats, adding local structural reinforcements and replacing the TV-2 engines with Ivchenko AI-20D turboprop engines, which had the added benefit of reducing the empty weight by . These changes resulted in the modified aircraft being ordered into production at the GAZ-34 factory in Tashkent. The new design required the use of new production techniques, such as stamping and forging of large high-strength parts, extrusion of long sections, chemical milling of large skin panels and other new techniques.

Given the service designation An-8, the new transport was built in the GAZ-34 factory in Tashkent from 1957 to 1961, as a larger-capacity replacement for the earlier Lisunov Li-2 (DC-3), with a large unpressurized hold, a manned tail gun position, chin radome for navigation/mapping radar and a glazed nose for the navigator. A total of 151 An-8s were built in Tashkent.

==Operational history==
The first production aircraft was rolled out in December 1958 incorporating de-rated AI-20D engines, (the initial production AI-20D was found to be incapable of delivering the specified power), modified undercarriage control systems, fuel vents, pressurization and de-icing systems, as well as thicker gauge skin in the propeller plane of rotation and increased rudder range of movement.

The majority of An-8s built served in the Soviet Air Forces, with two An-8s being used to land special forces to seize Plzeň airport during the Invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. Others were used as electronic reconnaissance aircraft, and one aircraft was used for air sampling following Chinese nuclear testing in 1966. They continued in large-scale use on frontline military duties in the Soviet Air Force until the 1970s, when many were later transferred to Aeroflot for use as freighters. Following a series of accidents in the early 1990s, the An-8 was withdrawn from use in Russia. This did not mean the end of the An-8, however as a number were sold overseas with a few aircraft observed flying in the Middle East and in Africa, particularly Liberia, DR Congo and Angola until around 2010, (especially airlines associated with the Russian businessman and convicted arms dealer Viktor Bout), despite Antonov having withdrawn the airworthiness certificate and support for the type in 2004, ending legal use of the aircraft.

<doc id="908112" wikidata="Q176926" url="?curid=908112" title="Cuíca">
<text>The cuíca () is a Brazilian friction drum with a large pitch range, produced by changing tension on the head of the drum. &quot;Cuíca&quot; is Portuguese for the gray four-eyed opossum (&quot;Philander opossum&quot;) which is known for its high-pitched cry. The cuíca is frequently used in carnivals, as well as often in samba music. The tone it produces has a high-pitched squeaky timbre. It has been called a &#x27;laughing gourd&#x27; due to this sound. Many also liken its sound to that of a monkey. In drum kit list, the mute and open cuíca sound is a F5 and G5.

==History==

There are a number of styles of found around the globe. Its origins are disputed: Different sources trace it to enslaved Bantu people, to Spain, and to Muslim traders – structurally it is identical, among other instruments in the same category, to the Portuguese , Spanish , Catalan and Balearic . The cuíca was used in Africa as a call for the male lion since the sound mimics the roar of the female lioness. The instrument was introduced to Brazil by enslaved people from Africa, where it found its place in samba music.

==Characteristics==
The cuíca has a wooden stick fastened at one end inside the drum in the center of the drumhead. This stick is rosined and rubbed with a cloth. Changing the pressure on the head of the drum from the outside produces the different pitches and timbres. The body of the cuíca is normally made of metal, gourd or synthetic material. It has a single head, normally in diameter, made of animal skin. A thin bamboo stick is attached to the center of, and perpendicular to, the drum head, extending into the drum&#x27;s interior. The instrument is held under one arm at chest height with the help of a shoulder strap. To play the cuíca, the stick is rubbed up and down with a wet cloth held in one hand while using the fingers of the other hand to press down on the skin of the drum near the place where the stick is attached. The rubbing motion produces the sound and the pitch is increased or decreased by changing the pressure on the head.

==Usage==

The cuíca is used to accompany a variety of different folk and urban popular dances. For example, it may be part of the instrumental ensemble for the &quot;Dança de Santa Cruz&quot; (&quot;Dance of the Holy Cross&quot;) celebrated every May in Santa Cruz, California or for the moçambique (Mozambique) dramatic dance, &quot;bailado&quot;, in Minas Gerais. It also is used in Feast of the Cross (Feast Of The Holy Cross) dances and processions and in samba music 
and dance performances in rural São Paulo.

The cuíca plays an important rhythmic role in samba music of all kinds. It is particularly notable as a fixture of Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s Carnival groups, which feature entire sections of cuíca players. It is so commonly used in radio-oriented samba music that in the absence of a cuíca player, Brazilian singers or other musicians imitate the sound of the cuíca with their voices. An example of this imitation can be heard on the intro part of Dizzy Gillespie&#x27;s version of &quot;Chega de Saudade&quot; (from the &quot;Dizzy on the French Riviera&quot; album, 1965) composed by Antônio Carlos Jobim. The cuíca can also be heard played by the Brazilian percussionist Airto Moreira on the 1999 reissue bonus track &quot;Feio&quot;, on Miles Davis&#x27; album &quot;Bitches Brew&quot;. The instrument was also used in &quot;Could You Be Loved&quot; by Bob Marley and The Wailers, &quot;Soul Bossa Nova&quot; by Quincy Jones, &quot;Bird of Beauty&quot; by Stevie Wonder, and &quot;Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard&quot; by Paul Simon. Along with samba, the cuíca is one of the mainly used Brazilian instruments in jazz-rock, free jazz, and Latin jazz.

<text>The Antonov An-10 Ukraina (; NATO reporting name: Cat) is a four-engined turboprop passenger transport aircraft designed in the Soviet Union.

==Design and development==
Development of a four-engined airliner intended for use on routes from began at the end of 1955. Inspired by the Izdeliye N (&quot;Izdeliye&quot; – article or product) passenger version of the Antonov An-8, the Antonov design bureau developed the Izdeliye U (&quot;U&quot; for &quot;Universal&quot;), a four-engined aircraft with a similar layout to the An-8, but with increased dimensions and a circular-section pressurised fuselage. Early in the design process the choice of engines was between the Kuznetsov NK-4 and the Ivchenko AI-20, and despite superior performance the Kuznetsov NK-4 was eliminated and the Ivchenko AI-20 selected, partly due to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine, which wanted as many as possible produced in Ukraine, where the Ivchenko factory was.

The first prototype flew on 7 March 1957, revealing poor directional stability which led to a taller vertical fin, and later to hexagonal auxiliary fins at the tips of the tailplane. Entering production at Zavod (factory) No.64, Voronezh in 1957, the initial three aircraft were delivered with Kuznetsov NK-4 engines, due to non-availability of the Ivchenko AI-20 engines. From 1958, production aircraft were delivered with the Ivchenko AI-20A engines which boasted a longer service life and performance comparable to the Kuznetsov engines. The new aircraft was displayed to the public for the first time in July 1957; the design was approved for mass production after testing was completed in June 1959. Aeroflot began operations with the An-10 from 22 July 1959 on the Moscow – Simferopol route.

Configured with 85 seats, the cabin was spacious and well-appointed with comfortable seats widely spaced, giving plenty of legroom, but due to the low cabin floor and wide diameter, there was much unusable space which limited baggage and cargo volume. The inefficient use of cabin volume contributed greatly to the low payload/TOW ratio which was much lower than that of the contemporary Ilyushin Il-18, but which was still higher than the Tupolev Tu-104. A later production version, the An-10A, addressed some of the efficiency concerns by increasing the number of seats from 85 to 89 and 100 (in the two versions of the An-10A), then to 117–118 and finally 132 through reducing seat pitch and changing the cabin layout. Powered by Ivchenko AI-20K engines the An-10A demonstrated superior performance and an increased maximum payload of 14.5 Tonnes (31,970 lb). The auxiliary endplate fins eventually gave way to improved splayed ventral fins under the rear fuselage. The directional stability was better and the new ventral fins also improved longitudinal stability at high g and on landing approach, as well as delaying the onset of Mach buffet to M0.702. Due to being placed in an area of flow separation, the new ventral fins caused unpleasant vibrations. Following results of flight tests and at least two fatal crashes, an effective tailplane deicing system was retrofitted to all remaining aircraft.

==Operational history==

A total of 104 aircraft were built, including the prototype and static test airframes, entering service with the Ukrainian Civil Aviation Directorate of Aeroflot from 27 April 1959, proving popular due to large cargo volume (when fitted with reduced seating) and excellent field performance, making the aircraft suitable for use on small undeveloped airfields. The Antonov Bureau simultaneously developed and produced the Antonov An-8 medium military transport, the An-10 civil airliner and military paratroop transport, as well as the Antonov An-12 military cargo transport.

On 16 November 1959 CCCP-11167 crashed on final approach near Lviv due to icing.

On 22 April 1962 an An-10A piloted by A. Mitronin achieved a world record 500 km closed loop speed record averaging .

On 26 February 1960, at Lviv Danylo Halytskyi International Airport, CCCP-11180 crashed due to reduced longitudinal stability and control authority caused by icing of the tailplane.

Military use of the An-10 was fairly extensive with 45 An-10TS built for the VTA, 16 flown exclusively by military units and the remaining 38 loaned to the Ministry of Civil Aviation, as well as the flyable aircraft remaining after withdrawal from Aeroflot service.

On 18 May 1972, while descending to Kharkiv International Airport an An-10 crashed, killing eight crew and 113 passengers. An investigation revealed fatigue cracking of the wing centre section stringers on many of the remaining aircraft. Following this accident, Aeroflot ceased operating the An-10.

After withdrawal from Aeroflot service on 27 August 1972, 25 An-10A aircraft which were in good condition were transferred to the VVS (Soviet Air Force) and other MAP (Ministry of Aircraft Production) units, until retired by 1974. The type&#x27;s very last flight was completed by 1983. 

A few examples have been preserved as exhibits in museums, and several have been converted into children&#x27;s theatres (at Kyiv, Samara and Novocherkassk).

==Operators==
* Aeroflot
* Soviet Air Force

==Variants==
* Izdeliye U – The in-house designation of the four-engined passenger aircraft derived from the Izdeliye N An-8 project.
* An-10 – The designation of the prototype and initial production versions fitted with Kuznetsov NK-4 or Ivchenko AI-20A engines.
* An-10A – Production aircraft from December 1959 with increased seating, decreased empty weight/increased payload and Ivchenko AI-20K engines.
* An-10AS – Several aircraft modified for small package cargo transport with no seats.
* An-10B (first use of designation) – Version with improved avionics and seating for 118 passengers.
* An-10B (second use of designation) – An An-10A configured to carry 132 passengers. This was achieved by increasing the number of seats in a row to seven and adding two more rows in the middle cabin. Seats in the front and middle sections reclined for passenger comfort. The tail was also modified. Extra fuel tanks were also fitted to increase range. One aircraft built in 1962.
* An-10D – Projected version with range increased to with fuel tanks in the wing torsion box and seating for 124 passengers. The engines were moved outward and fiberglass propeller blades fitted to reduce noise and increase efficiency. Production of a prototype was planned for 1960.
* An-10KP – (&quot;Komandny Punkt&quot; – command post) A single aircraft (CCCP-11854) modified as an airborne command post for use at Sperenberg Airfield, near Berlin in the DDR.
* An-10TS – (&quot;Transport/Sanitarny&quot; – transport/ambulance) 45 aircraft ordered for the VTA (&quot;Voyenno-Transportnaya Aviatsiya&quot; – transport air arm), with 38 loaned to the Ministry of Civil Aviation.
* An-10V (later An-16) – An-10A lengthened by and wider fuselage to carry 174 passengers at a range of or 128 passengers at a range of . Development began in 1963, but the aircraft was never built.
* An-16 – An-10 lengthened by to carry 130 passengers. Development began in 1957, but following an order for another variant, the aircraft was never built.

==Accidents and incidents==
Over its life, the An-10 experienced 15 accidents, with 373 fatalities. The An-10 carried more than 35 million passengers and 1.2 million tons of cargo.

*On 29 April 1958, an An-10 (CCCP-Л7256) of MAP Voronezh AZ crashed at Pridacha Airport during a test flight following double engine failure, killing one of five crew. Shortly after takeoff, engine number one overheated and failed due to prolonged operation in takeoff mode; the engine control system reduced power to engine number four to avoid asymmetric thrust. Engine number three later overheated and failed and power was reduced to engine number two. With only two engines, the aircraft could not maintain altitude and the crew decided to make a gear-down forced landing in a field, but the aircraft crashed during the attempt.
*On 16 November 1959, Aeroflot Flight 315, an An-10 (CCCP-11167), entered a nosedive and crashed near Snilow Airport due to tail icing, killing all 40 on board. It was found that the An-10 was vulnerable in icing conditions.
*On 26 February 1960, Aeroflot Flight 315, an An-10A (CCCP-11180), entered a nosedive while on approach to Snilow Airport due to tail icing. Although the crew were able to regain control, the aircraft went into another nosedive and crashed, killing 32 of 33 on board. In the wake of this accident and the crash of An-10 CCCP-11167 in 1959, ice protection systems for the stabilizer were improved and pilots could not select more than 15 degrees of flaps in known icing conditions.
*On 27 January 1962, an Aeroflot An-10 (CCCP-11148) crashed near Baratayevka Airport during a test flight after the number four propeller reversed, killing 13 of 14 on board.
*On 28 July 1962, Aeroflot Flight 415, an An-10A (CCCP-11186), struck a mountain 13 mi southeast of Adler/Sochi Airport while on approach due to ATC errors, killing all 81 on board.
*On 8 February 1963, an Aeroflot An-10A (CCCP-11193) stalled and crashed near Syktyvkar during a training flight following triple engine failure due to ice ingestion, killing the seven crew.
*On 8 August 1968, an Aeroflot An-10A (CCCP-11172) crashed on landing at Mirny Airport after the left main landing gear fell off while the landing gear was lowered; there were no casualties.
*On 12 October 1969, an Aeroflot An-10 (CCCP-11169) ran into a trench after landing on a snow-covered runway at Mirny Airport; no casualties.
*On 15 May 1970, an Aeroflot An-10 (CCCP-11149) lost control and crashed at Kishinev (now Chișinău) while performing a two-engined go-around during a training flight, killing the 11 crew.
*On 8 August 1970, Aeroflot Flight 888, an An-10A (CCCP-11188), force-landed in a field 24 mi north of Kishinev Airport following an in-flight fire caused by an uncontained engine failure, killing one of 114 on board.
*On 31 March 1971, Aeroflot Flight 1969, an An-10 (CCCP-11145), crashed on approach to Voroshilovgrad (now Luhansk) following an unexplained wing separation, killing all 65 on board.
*On 12 October 1971, an Aeroflot An-10 (CCCP-11137), suffered landing gear collapse on landing at Kishinev; no casualties.
*In February 1972, an Aeroflot An-10 (CCCP-11142) burned out in a fire at ARZ-412 at Rostov Airport.
*On 30 April 1972, an Aeroflot An-10 (CCCP-11159) suffered severe damage after a heavy landing at Vnukovo Airport; no casualties.
*On 18 May 1972, Aeroflot Flight 1491, an An-10A (CCCP-11215), crashed on approach to Kharkov Airport after both wings separated due to fatigue failure in the center wing panel, killing all 122 on board. Aeroflot retired the An-10 following this accident.

<doc id="908115" wikidata="Q497506" url="?curid=908115" title="No Woman, No Cry">
<text>&quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot; is a reggae song performed by Bob Marley and the Wailers. The song was recorded in 1974 and released on the studio album &quot;Natty Dread&quot;.

The live recording of this song from the 1975 album &quot;Live!&quot; was released as a single and is the best-known version; it was later included on several compilation albums, including the greatest hits compilation &quot;Legend&quot;. It was recorded at the Lyceum Theatre in London on 17 July 1975 as part of his &quot;Natty Dread Tour&quot;.

The live version of the song ranked No. 37 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

In 2005, the live version of the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Writing and composition==
Although Bob Marley is widely believed to have written the song, or at least the melody, songwriting credit was given to Vincent Ford, a friend of Marley&#x27;s who ran a soup kitchen in Trenchtown, the ghetto of Kingston, Jamaica, where Marley grew up (he specifically mentions the Government Yards of Trenchtown, a public housing project). The royalty payments received by Ford ensured his efforts would continue.

The original studio version of the song used a drum machine. Jean Roussel provided the arrangement and Hammond organ parts for this recording.
The title and main refrain, &quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot;, means &quot;Woman, don&#x27;t cry&quot;. The lyric is sometimes misunderstood outside Jamaica to mean &quot;if there is no woman, there is no reason to cry&quot;. The lyric is rendered &quot;No, woman, nuh cry&quot; in Jamaican Patois. The &quot;nuh&quot; is pronounced with a short schwa vowel (a &quot;mumbled&quot; vowel, often represented as &quot;uh&quot; in spelling) and represents a clitic (&quot;weakened&quot;) form of &quot;no&quot;.

==Fugees version==
&quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot; was covered by American hip hop group Fugees. It was released in November 1996 as the fourth single from their second studio album, &quot;The Score&quot; (1996). The song was produced by Wyclef Jean and Lauryn Hill. Fugees&#x27; version of the track features Jean on lead vocals and changes the lyric &quot;in a government yard in Trenchtown&quot; to &quot;in a project yard in Brooklyn.&quot; An official remix of the track, featuring Stephen Marley, was included on the group&#x27;s third release, &quot;Bootleg Versions&quot;. Jean later recorded a solo version of the track for his 2003 anthology &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;.

Fugees&#x27; version was successful worldwide, peaking atop the New Zealand Singles Chart for two weeks, reaching number-two in the United Kingdom and becoming a top 40 hit in 13 additional countries. It did not chart on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 due to not receiving a physical release in the US, which at the time was a requirement for songs to appear on the Hot 100. It instead charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Airplay chart, peaking at number 38.

===Critical reception===
Larry Flick from &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote, &quot;Fugees continue to offer the hip-hop masses a thorough musical history—this time targeting Bob Marley&#x27;s classic reggae hit &#x27;No Woman, No Cry&#x27;. Steve Marley&#x27;s heartwarming vocal similarity to his dad and Wyclef&#x27;s present-day Brooklyn, N.Y.- project-sensitive lyrics successfully bind new jacks to danceball&#x27;s reggae origins. The music video for the single continues the legacy: Lauryn Hill gets her unique vocal swerve on with the Melody Makers in scenes reminiscent of Rita, Judy, and Marcia&#x27;s I-Three days, and early Wailers footage interspersed with the collaborators&#x27; studio time supplies an overall tear-jerking, historic experience.&quot;

<text>The Antonov An-12 (Russian: Антонов Ан-12; NATO reporting name: Cub) is a four-engined turboprop transport aircraft designed in the Soviet Union. It is the military version of the Antonov An-10 and has many variants. For more than three decades, the An-12 was the standard medium-range cargo and paratroop transport aircraft of the Soviet air forces. A total of 1,248 aircraft were built.

==Design and development==
Developed from the Antonov An-8, the An-12 was a military version of the An-10 passenger transport. The first prototype An-12 flew in December 1957 and entered Soviet military service in 1959. Initially, the aircraft was produced at the State Aviation Factory in Irkutsk, Siberia. From 1962, production was transferred to Tashkent, where 830 were built. Later, production moved to Voronezh and Kazan.

In military use, the An-12 has capacity for up to 100 fully equipped paratroopers or of cargo, which is loaded through the rear loading ramp/door.

In terms of configuration, size, and capability, the aircraft is similar to the United States-built Lockheed C-130 Hercules. Soviet military and former-Soviet An-12s have a defensive tail gun turret.

===Chinese production===
In the 1960s, China purchased several An-12 aircraft from the Soviet Union, along with a license to assemble the aircraft locally. Due to the Sino-Soviet split, the Soviet Union withdrew its technical assistance. The Xi&#x27;an Aircraft Company and Xi&#x27;an Aircraft Design Institute reverse-engineered the An-12 for local production, and the first flight of a Chinese-assembled An-12 was delayed until 1974 after USSR ceased production in 1973.

In 1981, the Chinese version of the An-12, designated Y-8, finally entered production. Since then, the Y-8 has become one of China&#x27;s most popular military and civilian transport/cargo aircraft, with many variants produced and exported. A Tu-16/H-6 bomber navigator cockpit design was chosen for the Y-8 instead of the original An-12 shorter navigator cockpit design, as the H-6 bomber had been in serial production for some time. Although the An-12 is no longer in use either in Russia or in Ukraine, the Y-8 is upgraded and produced in China. The latest Y8-F600 is a joint venture between the Shaanxi Aircraft Company, Antonov Aeronautical Scientific Technical Complex (ASTC), and Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada. The Y8-F600 has a redesigned fuselage, western avionics, PW150B turboprop engines with an R-408 propeller system, and a two-crew glass cockpit.

==Operational history==
===Soviet Air Forces===
The aircraft first took flight in 1957 and was produced in the USSR until 1973. It was used in a variety of roles from search and rescue operations to equipment transportation. Its most significant use was seen during the Soviet-Afghan War. Among Soviet soldiers, it was infamously known that the plane would take off from Afghanistan to Tashkent with &quot;Cargo 200&quot; or coffins with the bodies of deceased soldiers. To this regard, the aircraft was nicknamed &quot;Black Tulip&quot; (Russian: «Чёрный тюльпан»); the origin of the nickname is unclear. There are quite a few monuments in Russia named to commemorate the killed during the Afghan War.

==Variants==

In addition to its basic cargo transport role, the An-12 was adapted as a platform for a wide variety of specialist tasks and some 30 different variants were produced. Upgrades included increased take-off weights and additional fuel capacity. The upgraded variant An-12BP became the standard tactical transport of the Soviet and other air forces. In 2019, it was announced at the military &quot;Army-2019&quot; Forum that Russia started working on an armed ground-attack and close air support variant of the An-12, similar to the American AC-130. In 2021, it was announced that the gunship will not be based on the An-12 after all, as it did not meet the requirements for a &quot;flying gunner.&quot;

==Operators==
Currently, the An-12 is popular with cargo operators, especially those in the CIS, Africa and the Indian subcontinent.

===Civil operators===

On 8 January 2009, following numerous incidents involving the An-12 in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) issued a temporary ban of the An-12 from UAE airspace. On 1 March 2010, the ban was made permanent after the An-12 failed a GCAA airworthiness evaluation.

<text>The Connells are an American musical group from Raleigh, North Carolina. They play a guitar-oriented, melodic, jangle-pop style of rock music with introspective lyrics that often reflect the history or culture of the American South.

Though the band has released little content since 2001, they never officially broke up and continue to occasionally perform to the present. In the United States, the Connells had three top 10 hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Songs chart, but they are best known for their song &quot;&#x27;74–&#x27;75&quot;, which was a number one hit in Norway and Sweden in 1995 while reaching the top 10 in a total of 11 European countries.

==Early history (1984–87)==
Guitarist Mike Connell formed the band in 1984 along with his brother David Connell on bass, Doug MacMillan on lead vocals, and future filmmaker John Schultz on drums. This initial four-person line-up was quickly supplemented by the addition of George Huntley on second guitar, keyboards, and vocals. Around the same time, former Johnny Quest drummer Peele Wimberley replaced Schultz, finalizing the &quot;classic&quot; line-up of the band.

An early version of &quot;Darker Days&quot;, recorded by the band&#x27;s initial four-piece lineup, appeared on the North Carolina indie compilation &quot;More Mondo&quot; in 1984. A re-recorded version of &quot;Darker Days&quot; provided the title track to the band&#x27;s debut album, which was produced by fellow North Carolinian Don Dixon. The album was released in 1985 on Elvis Costello&#x27;s Demon Records in the UK and the band&#x27;s own Black Park Records label in the U.S., with slightly different track listings for each country. In addition to the title track, one of the most notable songs on the album was &quot;Hats Off&quot;, an attack on then-President Ronald Reagan. After the release of the &quot;Darker Days&quot; album, the band re-recorded a more aggressive take of &quot;Hats Off&quot; for a 12&quot; single, which was the second Connells release on Black Park, and the last until 2000. During this period, videos for the songs &quot;Seven&quot; and &quot;Hats Off&quot; were aired on MTV&#x27;s &quot;120 Minutes&quot; program.

==College success (1987–93)==
After touring heavily behind &quot;Darker Days&quot;, the Connells re-entered the studio in 1986 with producer Mitch Easter to record their second album, &quot;Boylan Heights&quot;. The decision to work with Easter continued to perpetuate the comparisons to R.E.M. Mike Connell&#x27;s songwriting on &quot;Boylan Heights&quot; would provide most of the foundation for the band&#x27;s live show sound for the remainder of their career. The opener, &quot;Scotty&#x27;s Lament&quot;, featured the most explicit Celtic influence in the band&#x27;s songbook, while the chorus lyric &quot;I delight in my despair&quot; satirized the band&#x27;s early image as doom and gloom merchants &quot;a la&quot; Morrissey and The Smiths. Also notable is that the lyrics for that song originally included the sardonic twist, &quot;I delight in &quot;your&quot; despair.&quot;

&quot;Choose a Side&quot; incorporates synths (played by Huntley), and &quot;Over There&quot; features an ironic military trumpet counter-melody. Closing ballad &quot;I Suppose&quot; was a haunting tribute to the Raleigh upper-class neighborhood of Boylan Heights. Although the band shopped &quot;Boylan Heights&quot; to various labels, the major record companies, including Columbia Records, which expressed some mild interest, passed on it. The record was ultimately released in 1987 on mid-major TVT Records, which had made its name releasing a series of &quot;Tee Vee Toons&quot; television theme song compilation CDs. TVT would prove to be no commercial match for R.E.M.&#x27;s own mid-major label, I.R.S. Records, and over the next decade, the Connells would engage in a series of disputes with the label, on at least one occasion suing, unsuccessfully, to break their recording contract.

&quot;Boylan Heights&quot; was a substantial college radio hit, and the Connells continued to tour relentlessly. During this period, both Connell and Huntley began to move away from their twelve-string Rickenbackers towards six-string Fender and Gibson guitars, leading to a heavier, less folky sound, although elements of the band&#x27;s patented jangle were still audible on &quot;Hey Wow&quot;, the lead single from &quot;Fun and Games&quot;, the 1989 follow-up album. Other songs, such as &quot;Something to Say&quot; and &quot;Upside Down&quot; were heavier, featuring power chords, as well as the most self-lacerating lyrics to date from Connell. &quot;Fun and Games&quot; also saw Huntley&#x27;s role as a songwriter grow; after contributing one song each to &quot;Darker Days&quot; and &quot;Boylan Heights&quot;, Huntley wrote or co-wrote five tracks on &quot;Fun and Games&quot;, with the anthemic &quot;Sal&quot; quickly becoming one of the most popular songs in the band&#x27;s live set. CD pressings of &quot;Fun and Games&quot; included a bonus track, &quot;Fine Tuning&quot;.

&quot;Fun and Games&quot; was quickly followed in 1990 by &quot;One Simple Word&quot;, which was recorded in Wales with U.K. producer Hugh Jones. Jones had previously produced various British bands that the band had admired. Despite the high quality of the songs and improved playing by the band, notably on the Connell-MacMillan collaboration &quot;Stone Cold Yesterday&quot; and Connell&#x27;s own &quot;Get a Gun&quot; which were both college radio hits with videos, the band struggled to reach a higher level of success, although &quot;Stone Cold Yesterday&quot; notched the band a No. 3 hit on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, where &quot;Get a Gun&quot; also reached No. 24. This album saw the band stretch their sound and playing further, as on Connell&#x27;s debut as a lead vocalist, the plaintive ballad &quot;Waiting My Turn&quot;, which featured Kate St. John on cor anglais, but also saw the reworking of two songs that dated back to the &quot;Darker Days&quot; era, &quot;Too Gone&quot; and &quot;Take a Bow&quot;. Some critics have contended that the album/tour/album cycle was by this point outstripping Connell&#x27;s ability to compose new material. This is why the increasing contribution of other songwriters in the band became important as lead vocalist, Doug MacMillan also contributed a song, &quot;Another Souvenir&quot;, that he had written on his own.

==&quot;&#x27;74–&#x27;75&quot; and European success (1993–96)==
After a three-year recording hiatus, which included more legal jousting with TVT Records and the addition of Steve Potak on keyboards, a rejuvenated Connells released &quot;Ring&quot; in 1993. Though the lead single, &quot;Slackjawed&quot;, was another college radio hit in America, the band was initially disappointed with the album&#x27;s reception and considered breaking up. However, the follow-up single, &quot;&#x27;74–&#x27;75&quot;, another Celtic-influenced ballad, took off in Europe shortly thereafter and became a top-20 hit across the continent, including in the United Kingdom where it peaked at No. 14 in the UK Singles Chart, as well as Sweden and Norway, where it even managed to top the charts. This led to the band touring extensively in Europe and opening stadium shows for Def Leppard. &quot;&#x27;74–&#x27;75&quot; won numerous European music awards in the mid-1990s, leading to greater financial and radio success than the band had known to that point. &quot;&#x27;74–&#x27;75&quot; also appeared in the 1995 film, &quot;Heavy&quot;. However, while European music fans made &quot;Ring&quot; a platinum record outside the United States, such high level success in America still remained elusive. &quot;Ring&quot; reached No. 36 in the UK Albums Chart. &quot;Ring&quot; also marked the debut of David Connell stepping up as a songwriter by co-writing a song for the record, &quot;Hey You&quot;. MacMillan&#x27;s role as a songwriter also increased on this album, contributing three songs. The band also played &quot;Slackjawed&quot; on Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien.

==Later career (1996–2001)==
1996&#x27;s &quot;Weird Food and Devastation&quot; expanded the band&#x27;s sound in new directions, but failed to build on the momentum established by its predecessor. It was produced by the band&#x27;s longtime soundman, Tim Harper, later known for his production work for Whiskeytown. The title of the album reportedly alluded to the band&#x27;s impressions of Europe during their seemingly endless tours there in support of &quot;&#x27;74–&#x27;75&quot;. It featured a starker and heavier production than the more melodic &quot;Ring&quot;. By now, Connell and MacMillan shared songwriting duties about equally, with Connell&#x27;s style taking a quirkier turn on songs such as &quot;Adjective Song&quot;. Lead single &quot;Maybe&quot; was more in line with the anthemic pop songs of the band&#x27;s early days, but his remaining songs on the album were often odd and dissonant compared to his previous work. &quot;Friendly Time&quot; abandoned coded attacks on Ronald Reagan for coded attacks on rock critics such as Robert Christgau and J. D. Considine. The album also debuted the songwriting efforts of drummer Wimberley with the track “Any”, who also landed an outtake, “Bitter Pill”, on the soundtrack of the film Scream. The band shot music videos for &quot;Maybe&quot; (a parody of the Burt Reynolds film &quot;Deliverance&quot;) and &quot;Fifth Fret&quot; (which was a parody of the Alfred Hitchcock film &quot;Psycho&quot;). The band was invited to perform for a second time on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; where they performed &quot;Maybe&quot;. Their tour for the album was cut short in early 1997 when MacMillan became extremely ill prior to a show. He had been experiencing stomach pains for over a year, but believed it was due to his poor diet while on the road. After undergoing emergency surgery, he was diagnosed with diverticulitis and took several months off to recover.

In 1998, the band released &quot;Still Life&quot;, which marked their final album for TVT. Produced by Jim Scott, &quot;Still Life&quot; marked a departure from the harder sound of &quot;Weird Food and Devastation&quot; with an overall softer feeling reminiscent of Counting Crows and Teenage Fanclub. Mike Connell&#x27;s contributions to the record included a long-standing song with the band that was originally known as &quot;Brown&quot;, which was re-titled &quot;Dull, Brown, and Grey&quot;. It was the band&#x27;s only album to include songwriting contributions from all members, with MacMillan taking a decreased role in the album&#x27;s writing. Peele Wimberley departed the band later that year and was replaced by Steve Ritter.

The band released &quot;Old School Dropouts&quot; on the revived Black Park Records label in 2001. The band produced and recorded the record in Steve Potak&#x27;s studio and promoted it sparingly in the American South. The song &quot;Washington&quot; received some airplay on alternative radio.

== Current activities ==

After the release of &quot;Old School Dropouts&quot;, George Huntley left the band to spend more time with his family and begin a career in real estate. Mike Ayers was added in George&#x27;s place on lead guitar. Meanwhile, Peele Wimberley briefly played with another band called Parklife, and then moved to Los Angeles to pursue interests in Hollywood and in electronic music. He is currently a member of the Los Angeles band, The Lamps. David, who lost his first wife to cancer, remarried and has a career in landscape painting and art shows, and brother Mike is practicing law in Raleigh. Huntley is now selling real estate and working part-time at the University of North Carolina music department. In 2010, Joel Rhodes played on trumpet and flugelhorn until 2017. After several years with Steve Ritter and Chris Stephenson on drums, Rob Ladd was added as the drummer in early 2012.

Due to family and career commitments, the band does not play together as regularly any more. The performances are normally in the southeastern United States, usually at benefit concerts and music festivals.

The band&#x27;s catalog was acquired by Bicycle Recording Company, an independent publisher based in Beverly Hills, CA in April 2010 and has reissued the band&#x27;s TVT catalog digitally through IODA (The Independent Online Distribution Alliance). The releases became available August 31, 2010 on most digital music stores.

As of April 2013, the band was recording new material at Baby Topanga Studios. New songs include &quot;Stars&quot;, &quot;Burial Art&quot;, &quot;Mr. Lucky&quot;, and &quot;Helium&quot;.

On September 27, 2014, the Connells celebrated their 30th anniversary with a show in their hometown of Raleigh, NC. The show featured a surprise appearance from original member George Huntley playing and singing on multiple songs throughout the show.

In 2016, the band released a greatest hits album called &quot;Stone Cold Yesterday: Best of the Connells&quot;.

On January 25, 2020, the band played at Ram&#x27;s Head Live in Baltimore playing a set that included three songs from a &quot;new record&quot; supposedly coming out in 2020. On October 31, 2020, the Connells played at a live webcast concert at the Cat&#x27;s Cradle via internet, where they once again play some new songs which are to yet to be released.

On September 24, 2021, the first new studio album in 20 years called &quot;Steadman&#x27;s Wake&quot; was released on CD, vinyl and all digital formats. It features eleven new songs, of which three are re-recordings of songs from their previous album. 
Beforehand, the band released three songs from the new album as singles: &quot;Really Great&quot;, &quot;Stars&quot; and the title track &quot;Steadman&#x27;s Wake&quot;.

On May 5, 2023 the band released their first ever live album, &quot;Set the Stage&quot;.

==Influences and sound==
From the beginning of the group, Mike Connell wrote both the music and the lyrics of the majority of the band&#x27;s songs, although he was not the band&#x27;s primary lead singer. Connell&#x27;s influences included the 1960s guitar pop of his childhood, including The Byrds and The Beatles; in an early interview, he stated that the first song he wrote as a teenager was titled &quot;Psychedelic Butterfly&quot;.

Connell and other members of the Connells band were also influenced by then-contemporary British bands such as The Smiths and Echo &amp; the Bunnymen. Another, more idiosyncratic, influence was the British progressive rock band Jethro Tull, whose song &quot;Living in the Past&quot; was covered by the Connells on 1995&#x27;s &quot;New Boy&quot; EP. Like Peter Buck of R.E.M. and Johnny Marr of The Smiths, Connell and Huntley played Rickenbacker guitars for the first several years of the band&#x27;s career, creating a jangly, folk-rock sound reminiscent of The Byrds and other Southern U.S. and North Carolina bands of the era, such as the dB&#x27;s and Let&#x27;s Active.

Although the Connells were frequently dismissed as R.E.M. imitators due to the Athens, Georgia band&#x27;s overwhelming popularity relative to that of its contemporaries, there were significant differences between the two bands. First of all, the Connells&#x27; influences occurred at the same time that R.E.M.&#x27;s influences occurred. Connell and Huntley both played twelve-string Rickenbackers, as opposed to the six-string models favored by R.E.M.&#x27;s Buck; this gave the Connells an even janglier sound. Whereas Buck&#x27;s guitar style featured heavy use of arpeggios, Connell&#x27;s style was primarily based on strummed open chords in the keys of G and D, with a strong Celtic feel to songs such as &quot;Scotty&#x27;s Lament&quot; and &quot;&#x27;74–&#x27;75&quot;. Likewise, Connell&#x27;s lyrics were clearer and more direct than the stream-of-consciousness lyrics of Michael Stipe. The melancholy lyrics of early songs such as &quot;Darker Days&quot; drew comparisons to The Smiths, and an early feature on the band in the &quot;Raleigh&#x27;s Spectator Magazine&quot; music weekly dubbed them &quot;Raleigh&#x27;s local depressants&quot;.
And the band has a much more melodic bent than their forebears.

==Side and solo projects==
During the early days of the band, Doug MacMillan often played with other local Raleigh bands. He is also the voice of Captain Stickman in the Captain Stickman vs. Color Black videos.

In 1996, George Huntley released a solo record of additional material that he had written over the years he spent with The Connells, titled &quot;Brain Junk&quot;. The record was released on The Connells&#x27; record label, TVT. &quot;Brain Junk&quot; featured Huntley&#x27;s honesty and the trademark jangly guitar work which was evident on early Connells recordings. This effort was quite different from Huntley&#x27;s contributions to The Connells (such as &quot;Sal&quot;, &quot;Doin&#x27; You&quot;, and &quot;Motel&quot;), and featured a more stripped-down sound as well as some songs which sound as if they could have come a Connells release. On this record, Huntley explored various styles that did not fit in with The Connells&#x27; sound. &quot;Ever Want Me To&quot; was the first single from the record and TVT Records had a video made of the song starring Huntley. The second single, &quot;Catch Fire&quot;, was used in the Sandra Bullock/ Denis Leary film, &quot;Two If By Sea&quot;.

Doug MacMillan&#x27;s side project is the band Mommie, which records lyrics and music written by MacMillan and his children. The most notable song is &quot;Dumptruck&quot;, which has been played live by The Connells. Prior to that MacMillan was involved in a project called The Clifmen. This group, composed of musicians from various Raleigh independent bands, made one record.

Peele Wimberley played drums with various artists after his stint with The Connells including Parklife, Taylor Roberts, and Milagro Saints. After moving to Los Angeles Wimberley played keys and percussion in Lamps with John Crooke and David Burris, formerly of Jolene, Chris Phillips of Squirrel Nut Zippers, and Vicki Peterson of The Bangles. During his first few years in Los Angeles he wrote and cowrote incidental music for the show Last Comic Standing and for special products such as the DVD releases of the films Yes Man and Observe and Report. Peele has released an album under the name Silveradio which features his own songwriting and playing and is currently pursuing his electronic music interests with a project named Sleepie Digitz, as well as having played drums on upcoming releases by Apollo Heights and Ocean Carolina.

Mike graduated from the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1981, and received his Juris Doctor degree also from UNC Chapel Hill School of Law in 1985. He was admitted to the North Carolina Bar in 1986. Mike practices law at a firm in North Carolina, specializing in workers&#x27; compensation law.

David Connell is a successful painter in the Raleigh art community. His works have been on display in galleries in Raleigh, New York City, and elsewhere.

Steve Potak has played keyboards with numerous Raleigh bands, most notably the band Stream.

John Schultz&#x27;s first film, Bandwagon, was based on experiences in the early days of The Connells&#x27; career. Doug MacMillan has acted in almost every John Schultz film. He played one of the main characters in &quot;Bandwagon&quot; where he was the Zen-like band manager, Linus Tate. MacMillan has also performed in several other Schultz films: he had the role of the science teacher in &quot;Drive Me Crazy&quot;, briefly played a valet in &quot;Like Mike&quot;, and had a role as a Health Inspector in the recent remake of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;.

In 2002, the band recorded a cover of Cypress Hill&#x27;s &quot;Insane in the Brain&quot; for Cevin Soling&#x27;s &quot;When Pigs Fly&quot;.

<text>In Judaism, the High Holy Days, also known as High Holidays or Days of Awe (Yamim Noraim; , &quot;Yāmīm Nōrāʾīm&quot;) consist of:
#strictly, the holidays of Rosh Hashanah (&quot;Jewish New Year&quot;) and Yom Kippur (&quot;Day of Atonement&quot;);
#by extension, the period of ten days including those holidays, known also as the Ten Days of Repentance (); or,
#by a further extension, the entire 40-day penitential period in the Jewish year from Rosh Chodesh Elul to Yom Kippur, traditionally taken to represent the forty days Moses spent on Mount Sinai before coming down with the second (&quot;replacement&quot;) set of the Tablets of Stone.

==Etymology==
The term High Holy Days most probably derives from the popular English phrase, &quot;high days and holy days&quot;. The Hebrew equivalent, &quot;Yamim Noraim&quot; (), is neither Biblical nor Talmudic. Professor Ismar Elbogen avers that it was a medieval usage, reflecting a change in the mood of Rosh Hashanah from a predominantly joyous celebration to a more subdued day that was a response to a period of persecution.

==The days preceding Rosh Hashanah (Jewish new year) ==

The Hebrew month preceding Rosh Hashanah, Elul, is designated as a month of introspection and repentance. In preparation for the Jewish New Year, special prayers are recited. In many communities, is added at the end of morning and evening prayers. The shofar (ram&#x27;s horn) is blown at the end of morning services on weekdays, and in some communities in the afternoon service as well (it is omitted on the eve of Rosh Hashanah in order to differentiate between the customary blasts of the month of Elul and the obligatory blasts of Rosh Hashanah, and in some communities it is omitted for the 3 days proceeding Rosh Hashanah). Among Sephardi Jews, selichot are recited at dawn on weekdays throughout the month. Also, many complete the entire Psalms twice during the month. It is customary to increase the giving of tzedakah (charity) and to ask forgiveness from people one may have wronged.

At midnight on the Saturday night or Sunday morning before Rosh Hashanah (or one week before that, if the first day of Rosh Hashanah is Monday or Tuesday), Ashkenazi Jews begin reciting &quot;selichot&quot;. On the following days, however, they generally recite the &quot;selichot&quot; before the regular morning prayers. On the eve of Rosh Hashanah, extra prayers are recited and many fast until noon.

==Rosh Hashanah==

Rosh Hashanah ( &quot;Beginning of the Year&quot;) is the Jewish New Year, and falls on the first and second days of the Jewish month of Tishrei (September/October). The Mishnah, the core work of the Jewish Oral Torah, sets this day aside as the new year for calculating calendar years and sabbatical and jubilee years.

Rabbinic literature describes this day as a day of judgment. God is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Ancient of Days.&quot; Some descriptions depict God as sitting upon a throne, while books containing the deeds of all humanity are opened before Him.

Prayer services are longer than on a regular shabbat or other Jewish holidays, and include (on weekdays) the blowing of the shofar. On the afternoon of the first (or the second, if the first was Saturday) day, the ritual tashlikh is performed, in which sins are &quot;cast&quot; into open water, such as a river, sea, or lake.

==The Ten Days of Repentance==

The &quot;ten days of repentance&quot; or &quot;the days of awe&quot; include Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur and the days in between, during which time Jews should meditate on the subject of the holidays and ask for forgiveness from anyone they have wronged. They include the Fast of Gedalia, on the third day of Tishrei, and Shabbat Shuvah, which is the Shabbat between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.

Shabbat Shuvah has a special Haftarah that begins &quot;Shuvah Yisrael&quot; (come back, oh Israel), hence the name of that Shabbat. Traditionally the rabbi gives a long sermon on that day.

It is held that, while judgment on each person is pronounced on Rosh Hashanah, it is not made absolute until Yom Kippur. The Ten Days are therefore an opportunity to mend one&#x27;s ways in order to alter the judgment in one&#x27;s favor.

==Yom Kippur==

Yom Kippur () is the holiest day of the Jewish year. The Hebrew Bible calls the day &quot;Yom Hakippurim&quot; &quot;Day of the Atonement/s&quot;.

In the Hebrew calendar, the ninth day of Tishrei is known as &quot;Erev Yom Kippur&quot; (Yom Kippur eve). Yom Kippur itself begins around sunset on that day and continues into the next day until nightfall, and therefore lasts about 25 hours.

Observant Jews will fast throughout Yom Kippur and many attend synagogue for most of the day. There are five prayer services, one in the evening (sometimes known as &quot;Kol Nidre&quot; from one of the main prayers) and four consecutively on the day. On Yom Kippur day, Ne&#x27;ilah, a prayer only recited on this day, is said. It symbolizes the closing of the gates of heaven as the day of repentance comes to an end. It provides one last chance to seek forgiveness and offer prayers before the conclusion of the holiday.

==Hoshana Rabbah==

The seventh day of Sukkot is known as Hoshana Rabbah. Jews take bouquets of willow branches that represent their sins and bash them on the floor while saying a special prayer to God to forgive them for the sins that may have been missed on Yom Kippur.

==High Holy Days seats==
Generally, throughout most of the year, Jewish worship services are open to all, regardless of affiliation, and membership or payment of any fee is not a requirement in order to attend. However, the High Holy Days are usually peak attendance days for synagogues and temples, often filling or over-filling synagogues. For this reason many synagogues issue tickets for attendance and may charge for them: practice varies on whether paid-up synagogue members must also buy these or whether it is included in the subscription.

Synagogues never pass a collection plate during most holiday services as some churches do, as Jews are forbidden to touch money on Shabbat or other holidays such as Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. However, promises to make donations are allowed. Among synagogues in the United States, donations are often sought during the Kol Nidre service, called the &quot;Kol Nidre Appeal,&quot; often via a pledge card, where the amount of the donation is represented by a paper tab that can be bent down in the amount of donation desired. Some temples provide a card listing donation amounts, and a paper clip which the congregant may put on the card indicating their preferred donation amount. In both cases, the card is stored inside an envelope with the congregant&#x27;s name and other personal contact details, and the temple reaches them after the High Holidays are over. Rabbis and other temple representatives say that holiday ticket sales represent a significant source of revenue.

<doc id="908124" wikidata="Q1521775" url="?curid=908124" title="Cathexis">
<text>In psychoanalysis, cathexis (or emotional investment) is defined as the process of allocation of mental or emotional energy to a person, object, or idea.

==Origin of term==
The Greek term &quot;cathexis&quot; (κάθεξις) was chosen by James Strachey to render the German term &quot;Besetzung&quot; in his translation of Sigmund Freud&#x27;s complete works. Freud himself used the word &quot;interest&quot; in English in an early letter to Ernest Jones.

Peter Gay objected that Strachey&#x27;s use of cathexis was an unnecessarily esoteric replacement for Freud&#x27;s use of &quot;Besetzung&quot; – &quot;a word from common German speech rich in suggestive meanings, among them &#x27;occupation&#x27; (by troops) and &#x27;charge&#x27; (of electricity)&quot;, though Gay is mistaken regarding his latter example.

==Usage==
Freud defined cathexis as an allocation of libido, pointing out for example how dream thoughts were charged with different amounts of affect. A cathexis or allocation of emotional charge might be positive or negative, leading some of his followers to speak of a cathexis of mortido as well. Freud called a group of cathected ideas a complex.

Freud frequently described the functioning of psychosexual energies in quasi-physical terms, representing frustration of libidinal desires, for example, as a blockage of (cathected) energies which would eventually build up and require release in alternative ways. This release could occur, for example, by way of regression and the &quot;re-cathecting&quot; of former positions or fixations, or the autoerotic enjoyment (in phantasy) of former sexual objects: &quot;object-cathexes&quot;.

Freud used the term &quot;anti-cathexis&quot; or counter-charge to describe how the ego blocks such regressive efforts to discharge one&#x27;s cathexis: that is, when the ego wishes to repress such desires. Like a steam engine, the libido&#x27;s cathexis then builds up until it finds alternative outlets, which can lead to sublimation, reaction formation, or the construction of (sometimes disabling) symptoms.

M. Scott Peck distinguishes between love and cathexis, with cathexis being the initial in-love phase of a relationship, and love being the ongoing commitment of care. Cathexis, to Peck, is distinguished from love by its dynamic element.

==Object relations==
Freud saw the early cathexis of objects with libidinal energy as a central aspect of human development. In describing the withdrawal of cathexes which accompanied the mourning process, Freud provided his major contribution to the foundation of object relations theory.

==Thinking==
Freud saw thinking as an experimental process involving minimal amounts of cathexis, &quot;in the same way as a general shifts small figures about on a map&quot;.

In delusions, it was the hypercathexis (or over-charging) of ideas previously dismissed as odd or eccentric which he saw as causing the subsequent pathology.

==Art==
Eric Berne raised the possibility that child art often represented the intensity of cathexis invested in an object, rather than its objective form.

==Criticism==
Critics charge that the term provides a potentially misleading neurophysiological analogy, which might be applicable to the cathexis of ideas but certainly not of objects. This, however, arises from a misunderstanding of the psychoanalytic definition of objects, which does not refer to physical objects that are seen in the environment, but to the internal images of these physical objects which are created by the psyche. 

Further ambiguity in Freud&#x27;s usage emerges in the contrast between cathexis as a measurable load of (undifferentiated) libido, and as a qualitatively distinct type of affect – as in a &quot;cathexis of longing&quot;.

<text>The Hooghly River (also spelled &quot;Hoogli&quot; or &quot;Hugli&quot;) is the westernmost distributary of the Ganges, situated in West Bengal, India. It is known in its upper reaches as the Bhagirathi. The Bhagirathi splits off from the main branch of the Ganges at Giria. A short distance west, it meets the man-made Farakka Feeder Canal, which massively increases its flow. The river then flows south to join the Jalangi at Nabadwip, where it becomes the Hooghly proper. The Hooghly continues southwards, passing through the metropolis of Kolkata. Thereafter, it empties into the Bay of Bengal. Its tributaries include the Ajay, Damodar, Rupnarayan, and Haldi.

The Hooghly has religious significance as Hindus consider the river sacred. It also plays a major role in the agriculture, industry, and climate of the state.

== Course ==

The vast majority of the water that flows into the Hooghly River is provided by the man-made Farakka Feeder Canal, rather than the natural source of the river at Giria. The Farakka Barrage is a dam that diverts water from the Ganges into the Farakka Feeder Canal near the town of Tildanga in Murshidabad district, located 40 km upstream from Giria. This supplies the Hooghly with water as per the agreement between India and Bangladesh. The feeder canal runs parallel to the Ganges, past Dhulian, until just above Jahangirpur where the canal ends and joins the Bhagirathi river. The Bhagirathi then flows south past Jiaganj Azimganj, Murshidabad and Baharampur.South of Baharampur and north of Palashi it used to form the border between Bardhaman District and Nadia District, but while the border has remained the same the river is now often east or west of its former bed. The river then flows south past Katwa, Nabadwip, Kalna and Jirat. At Kalna it originally formed the border between Nadia District and Hooghly District, and then further south between Hooghly District and North 24 Parganas District. It flows past Halisahar, Chinsurah, Naihati, Bhatpara, Konnagar, Serampore, and Kamarhati. Then, just before entering the twin cities of Kolkata (Calcutta) and Howrah, it turns to the southwest. At Nurpur it enters an old channel of the Ganges, and turns south to empty into the Bay of Bengal through an estuary about wide [2].

Ain-i-Akbari, a book by Abu&#x27;l-Fazl, describes that the river Ganga and river Sarwasati (Sarsuti) streams of lower Bengal had different flows. According to the footnotes of this book, the colour of the water of the Sarawasati was white, the colour of another stream named Jamuna was blue, and the colour of the Ganga was muddy and yellowish. From Kolkata the main flow of the Hooghly-Bhagirathi (or Ganga) used to run along the side of the Kalighat temple, Baruipur, Jaynagar Majilpur, Chhatrabhog and Hatiagarh. At that time, between Khiderpore and Sankrail no flow existed. Presently, the stream between Khiderpore and Sankrail became known as KatiGanga. A channel had been dug at the time of Alibardi Khan in the middle of the 18th century. This happened with the assistance of Dutch traders, who also set up a toll point on the Hooghly river. So the present reach of the Hooghly is the lower part of the historical Saraswati. Kolkata the capital of West Bengal is located on the banks of the Hoogly river.
== Tidal bore ==

The tide runs rapidly on the Hooghly, and produces a remarkable example of the fluvial phenomenon known as a tidal bore. This consists of the head-wave of the advancing tide, hemmed in where the estuary narrows suddenly into the river, and often exceeds in height. It is felt as high up as Naihati 35 km upstream of Calcutta, and frequently destroys small boats. A tidal bore which overcame the banks of the river in 1876 was reported to have killed up to a hundred thousand people. The difference from the lowest point of low-water in the dry season to the highest point of high-water in the rains is reported to be . The greatest mean rise of tide, about , takes place in March, April or May - with a declining range during the rainy season to a mean of , and a minimum during freshets of .

== History ==
In its upper reaches the river is generally known as the Bhāgirathi, until it reaches Hooghly. The word Bhāgirathi literally means &quot;caused by Bhagiratha&quot;, a Hindu mythological Solar dynasty prince who was instrumental in bringing the river Ganges from heaven to the earth, in order to release his 60,000 grand-uncles from a curse of the saint Kapila.

In 1974, the Farakka Barrage began diverting water into the Hooghly during the dry season so as to reduce the silting difficulties at Kolkata&#x27;s port.

Like the rest of the Ganges, the Bhāgirathi-Hooghly is considered sacred to Hindus, and its water is considered holy.

== Bridges and tunnels ==

The following bridges currently span the Hooghly River; listed from south to north until the Farakka Feeder Canal meets the river:
*Vidyasagar Setu (Second Hooghly Bridge)- inaugurated in October 1992, connecting Howrah and Kolkata
*Rabindra Setu (Howrah Bridge) - inaugurated in February 1943, connecting Howrah and Kolkata
*Nivedita Setu (Second Vivekananda Bridge) - inaugurated in July 2007, connecting Bally and Dakhineswar; runs adjacent to Vivekananda Setu
*Vivekananda Setu (Bally Bridge; road and rail bridge) - inaugurated in December 1932, connecting Bally and Dakhineswar; runs adjacent to Nivedita Setu
*Sampreeti Setu (New Jubilee Bridge; rail only) - inaugurated in August 2016, connecting Bandel and Naihati; replaced the now-decommissioned Jubilee Bridge
*Ishwar Gupta Setu (Kalyani Bridge) - inaugurated in 1989, connecting Bansberia and Kalyani
*Gouranga Setu - connecting Nabadwip and Krishnanagar
*Ramendra Sundar Tribedi Setu - connecting Khagraghat and Baharampur
* Jangipur Bhagirathi Bridge - connecting Raghunathganj and Jangipur
The following bridges are under various stages of development:

*Nashipur Rail Bridge (rail only) - partially constructed; connecting Azimganj and Murshidabad
* New Bhagirathi Bridge - constructed on NH 34 at Berhampore
* Kalna - Shantipur Bridge - announced
* Fuleshwar - Budge Budge Bridge - announced
The following tunnels are situated under the Hooghly River :-

* CESC Tunnel - This tunnel is using for electric power transmission between Kolkata and Howrah. It was the first underwater tunnel of Asia. The construction of this tunnel was completed in 1931.
* East West Metro Tunnel - The tunnel was completed in 2021. This tunnel is the first underwater river railway tunnel in India. It is a metro railway tunnel, connecting Kolkata to Howrah.

== Economics ==

The Bhāgirathi-Hooghly river system is an essential lifeline for the people of West Bengal. It was through this river that the East India company sailed into Bengal and established their trade settlement, Calcutta, the capital of British India. People from other countries such as the French, Dutch, Portuguese, etc. all had their trade settlements by the banks of this river.

The river provides a perennial supply of water to the plain of West Bengal for irrigation and human &amp; industry consumption. The river is navigable and a major transport system in the region with a large traffic flow. For a long time, the Calcutta Port was the biggest port of India. Although in the past its significance had gone down, recently it has reached the 3rd position in the list of Indian Ports. The modern container port of Haldia, on the intersection of lower Hooghly and Haldi River, now carries much of the region&#x27;s maritime trade. One new port will be built in the deep sea to reduce the load on Calcutta port.

Despite the river being polluted, the fish from it are important to the local economy.

The Hooghly river valley was the most important industrial area of the state of Bengal. Despite a decline of the jute industry, the prime industry of this region, it is still one of the biggest industrial areas of India. It has a number of small cities which form the Greater Kolkata agglomeration, the second biggest Indian city and the former capital.

In September 2015, the Government of West Bengal announced that renovation of the Hooghly riverfront in Kolkata will be completed with the help of World Bank funding under the National Ganga River Basin Project Scheme.

== Hooghly River in arts ==
===Literature===
Rudyard Kipling wrote an article, &quot;On the Banks of the Hugli&quot; (1888), and a short story set on the Hooghli, &quot;An Unqualified Pilot&quot; (1895).

===Cultural events===
The Silk River project aims at exploring the artistic relationship between Kolkata and London through artistic exchange from 10 locations each along the Hooghly River and the River Thames. The 10 places along the Hooghly River are Murshidabad, Krishnagar, Chandernagore, Barrackpore, Jorasanko, Bowbazar, Howrah, Kidderpore, Botanical Gardens and Batanagar. Ten scrolls, painted in the Patua tradition, depicting the 10 places will be carried along the Hooghly River. The event began at Murshidabad on 7 December 2017 and ended at the Victoria Memorial, Kolkata on 17 December.

<text>Afghanistan sent a delegation to compete at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, which were held from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the eleventh appearance of the nation in the Summer Olympics and their first since their reinstatement to the International Olympic Committee in 2003 following a four-year ban due to the Taliban government&#x27;s discrimination against women and their opposition to them playing sports. The delegation consisted of five athletes: sprinters Masoud Azizi and Robina Muqimyar, boxer Basharmal Sultani, judoka Friba Rezayee and wrestler Bashir Ahmad Rahmati. Muqimayar and Rezayee&#x27;s inclusion in the Afghan delegation marked the first time the country sent a woman athlete to a Summer Olympics. All five failed to progress any further than the preliminary round of their respective sports and Afghanistan&#x27;s best performance at the Games was by Muqimayar who set a new national women&#x27;s 100 metre record in her heat.

==Background==
Afghanistan first sent a delegation to compete in the Summer Olympics in 1936 Berlin Games. They have competed in every Summer Olympics since, missing the Olympics only in five occasions between 1936 and 2004. These were in 1952, 1976, 1984, 1992 and 2000. Afghanistan was suspended by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in October 1999 and subsequently banned from the 2000 Sydney Olympics due to its discrimination against women under the rule of the Taliban and its prohibition of women&#x27;s sports. Following the fall of the Taliban in 2001, the IOC helped local authorities to establish a new National Olympic Committee. These efforts led to the IOC re-instating the country in its 115th meeting in the Czech capital of Prague on 29 June 2003 and told them a prerequisite for future Olympic participation was the inclusion of women in their delegation.

The 2004 Athens Summer Games that took place from 13 to 29 August 2004 was Afghanistan&#x27;s eleventh appearance at an Olympic Games. The nation sent five athletes to the Olympics: sprinters Masoud Azizi and Robina Muqimyar, boxer Basharmal Sultani, judoka Friba Rezayee and wrestler Bashir Ahmad Rahmati. Muqimayar and Rezayee&#x27;s inclusion in the team was the first time Afghanistan sent women athletes to a Summer Olympics. All five athletes trained in Afghanistan and later with Iranian coaches in Tehran before travelling to Thessalonki in the run up to the Games. The team was on a limited budget due to a shortage of capital from the Afghan authorities and the general consensus in the media was they would not medal at the Games. Neema Surgatar, a coach for the Afghanistan team, was the flag bearer for the opening ceremony, while another coach, Kosia Akashi, carried it at the closing ceremony.

==Athletics==
Competing at his first Olympic Games at the age of 18, Masoud Azizi was the only male athlete to compete for Afghanistan in athletics competition. He qualified for the Athens Games after being granted a wild card place because his best time of 11.16 seconds set during practice in the men&#x27;s 100 metres was 0.88 seconds slower than the event&#x27;s &quot;B&quot; Olympic qualifying standard. In an interview before the Games, Azizi said, &quot;I am very proud to be with the other world champions. I will introduce myself to them.&quot;, and, &quot;I try my best to give something back home. Everybody wants to get a medal, but even if they don&#x27;t get it, it&#x27;s not a matter of win or lose. The main thing is to participate.&quot; He was drawn to compete in heat four alongside eight other sprinters on 21 August. Azizi finished eighth and last of all the finishing runners with a time of 11.66 seconds; only the top three from each heat and the next ten fastest overall among all ten heats were able to advance, and he was eliminated from the competition. Azizi would go on to represent Afghanistan twice more at the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics.

18-year old Robina Muqimyar was the sole female athletics competitor to represent Afghanistan at the 2004 Summer Olympics. She qualified for the Olympics after the IOC gave her a wild card place as her best time of 13.76 seconds was 1.74 seconds slower than the &quot;B&quot; Olympic qualifying standard for the women&#x27;s 100 metres. Her family consented to her competing in Athens. Judoka Stig Traavik scouted Muqimyar who began training on a deteriorating track at Ghazi Stadium twice a week, sometimes barefooted but always away from men for fear of harassment and assault. Before the Games, she told the BBC World Service of her desire to be a role model for Afghan women. On 20 August 2004, Muqimyar took part in the seventh heat, finishing seventh out of eight runners, with a national record time of 14.14 seconds. She was eliminated from competition as only the top three from each heat and the next ten fastest overall among all ten heats progressed to the next round. Afterwards, Muqimayr stated, &quot;I felt a little scared because all the world was watching me. But during the warm-ups the other athletes told me they understood the difficulties I have faced to get here and they encouraged me. In the stadium, I heard a lot of cheering &quot;Robina! Robina!&quot; and that made me feel good.&quot; She represented Afghanistan again at the 2008 Beijing Games.

;Women
==Boxing==
Basharmal Sultani was 19 years old at the time of the Athens Summer Games and was making his only appearance at an Olympic Games. He received a wild card invitation to participate in the Games from the IOC after failing to attain an automatic qualifying spot with his third-place finish in the Asian qualifying rounds for the welterweight category. Sultani was drawn to face Mohamed Hikal of Egypt in the Round of 32 on 15 August at the Peristeri Olympic Boxing Hall. He lost the match 12–40 on points and therefore that was the end of his competition. Although he was defeated, Sultani was applauded by the small crowd of spectators and said of his participation in the Olympic Games to &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot;, &quot;This was a great moment in my life, and it will be the same for other athletes when they compete.&quot;

==Judo==
Competing at her only Olympics, Friba Razayee was 18 years old at the time of the Athens Olympic Games, and was the first woman athlete to represent Afghanistan at an Olympic Games. She used a wild card from the IOC to qualify for the Games despite the International Judo Federation hesitant in allowing low-ranked fighters participating in the quadrennial event. In 1994, Razayee&#x27;s family fled Afghanistan when she was nine and stayed in Pakistan for eight years where she became interested in martial arts. Eight years later, she returned to Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban and took up boxing before switching to Judo. Razayee said she wanted to use the Olympics as a means of changing the perception of sport in Afghanistan, &quot;My fighting is not as important to me as is my participating. I want to show (everyone) that Afghan women have a place in sport and set the example for all of them.&quot; In her Round of 32 match against Cecilia Blanco of Spain on 18 August, she lost after 42 seconds without earning one point. Although she was tearful, Razayee spoke of her pride over competing in the Olympics and recognised her weaknesses, &quot;I tried my best but I couldn&#x27;t do any thing. Next time I&#x27;ll win the competition.&quot;

==Wrestling==
At the age of 20, Bashir Ahmad Rahmati was the only athlete to compete in wrestling competition for Afghanistan. This was his only time partaking in the Summer Olympic Games. Under the Olympic Solidarity programme, which aids underdeveloped NOCs in establishing their national and regional sporting structures, Rahamati qualified to compete at Athens in the men&#x27;s featherweight class (55 kg) of wrestling through a tripartite invitation from the International Federation of Associated Wrestling. He lost two straight matches in the elimination pool to Uzbekistan&#x27;s Dilshod Mansurov and Russia&#x27;s Mavlet Batirov, who went on to win the Olympic gold medal at the end of the tournament, with a greater superiority effort, finishing last in the preliminary pool and twenty-second overall in the final standings.

<text>Muriel Ann Smith, OC ( Lipsey; May 9, 1930) is a Manitoba politician. She ran for the leadership of the New Democratic Party of Manitoba in 1979, and subsequently served in the cabinet of NDP Premier Howard Pawley.

Smith is the daughter of George Cherry Lipsey and Mary MacDonald, at Britannia Beach, British Columbia, and was educated at the University of Manitoba and the Oxford Institute of Education, in Oxford, England. In 1952, she married Gordon Murray Rhodes Smith, son of former Manitoba Liberal politician Charles Rhodes Smith.

She worked as a counsellor, served on the Human Rights Commission of Manitoba from 1974 to 1978 and the Manitoba Action Centre on the Status of Women from 1975 to 1976. She was also President of the Manitoba NDP from 1975 to 1977.

She first ran for the provincial legislature in the 1973 provincial election, in the upscale Winnipeg riding of River Heights. She placed third, with Progressive Conservative leader Sidney Spivak winning the riding and future Liberal leader Charles Huband finishing second. Smith ran in Crescentwood in the 1977 election, losing to Progressive Conservative Warren Steen by 72 votes.

Smith was a representative of the NDP&#x27;s left wing in the 1979 leadership race. Her supporters included supporters of &quot;the Waffle&quot; (a left-leaning group within the NDP) and many leading members of Manitoba&#x27;s feminist community. Smith&#x27;s campaign suffered a serious setback when she failed to receive the NDP nomination for a by-election in the riding of Fort Rouge. Notwithstanding, she finished a credible second place at the convention, losing to Howard Pawley.

She was elected to the Manitoba legislature for the first time in the 1981 election, representing the riding of Osborne. She joined cabinet on November 30, 1981, serving as Deputy Premier and Minister of Economic Development and Tourism. Muriel Smith was the first woman in Canada to serve as a deputy premier. On August 20, 1982, she was also entrusted with administration of the Development Corporation Act and A.E. McKenzie Company, Limited.

On November 4, 1983, Smith moved to the ministry of Community Services. On January 30, 1985, she was also appointed Minister responsible for the Status of Women, holding this position until April 17, 1986. She was again moved on September 21, 1987, serving as Minister of Labour and Housing while again receiving cabinet responsibilities for the Status of Women (replacing Judy Wasylycia-Leis, who had held the portfolio in the interim). Smith remained in cabinet until the Pawley government was defeated in 1988.

She was easily re-elected in the 1986 election, but lost to future federal cabinet minister Reg Alcock in 1988. She has not returned to active political life since this time. Smith later became Vice President of the United Nations Association in Canada, and has taught part-time in affirmative action social work. She was a member of the Advisory Council of the Order of Manitoba. In 2003, she supported Bill Blaikie&#x27;s campaign to become leader of the federal New Democratic Party.

==Awards and honours==
Smith became an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2007 That same year she also was a recipient of the Governor General&#x27;s Award in Commemoration of the Person&#x27;s Case.

<doc id="908169" wikidata="Q225604" url="?curid=908169" title="Henry of Grosmont, Duke of Lancaster">
<text>Henry of Grosmont, Duke of Lancaster (– 23 March 1361) was an English statesman, diplomat, soldier, and Christian writer. The owner of Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire, Grosmont was a member of the House of Plantagenet, which was ruling over England at that time. He was the wealthiest and most powerful peer of the realm.

The son and heir of Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster, and Maud Chaworth, Grosmont became one of King Edward III&#x27;s most trusted captains in the early phases of the Hundred Years&#x27; War and distinguished himself with victory in the Battle of Auberoche. He was a founding member and the second knight of the Order of the Garter in 1348, and in 1351 was created Duke of Lancaster. An intelligent and reflective man, Grosmont taught himself to write and was the author of the book &quot;Livre de Seyntz Medicines&quot;, a highly personal devotional treatise. He is remembered as one of the founders and early patrons of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, which was established by two guilds of the town in 1352.

==Origins==
Henry of Grosmont was the only son of Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster (–1345), who in turn was the younger brother and heir of Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster (–1322). They were sons of Edmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster (1245–1296); the second son of King Henry III (ruled 1216–1272) and younger brother of King Edward I of England (ruled 1272–1307). Henry of Grosmont was thus a first cousin once removed of King Edward II and a second cousin of King Edward III (ruled 1327–1377). His mother was Maud de Chaworth (1282–1322). On his paternal grandmother&#x27;s side, Henry of Grosmont was also the great-great-grandson of Louis VIII of France. He was also the first great-grandson of King of England in legitimate male line not to be grandson of king, since the Conquest.

Little is known of Grosmont&#x27;s childhood and youth. Due to his uncle Thomas&#x27; increasingly hostile relations with King Edward II—culminating in his rebellion and execution in 1322—historian Kenneth Fowler suggests that this period &quot;must have been quite eventful&quot;, and that Grosmount&#x27;s &quot;fortunes and opportunities were inextricably bound up with the tragic events of these years&quot;. The year and place of his birth are not known with certainty. He is believed to have been born at Grosmont Castle in Grosmont, Monmouthshire, Wales. According to his own memoirs he was a &quot;good looking, youth. Tall fair and slim&quot;, and better at martial arts than at academic subjects; he did not learn to read until later in life. His education would have been orthodox, but in being so, produced the archetypal young noble admired at the time.

Henry of Grosmont was the eventual heir of his wealthy uncle Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, who through his marriage to Alice de Lacy, daughter and heiress of Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln, had become the wealthiest peer in England. Constant quarrels between Thomas and his first cousin, King Edward II of England, led to his execution in 1322. Having no progeny, Thomas&#x27;s possessions and titles went to his younger brother Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster, Grosmont&#x27;s father. Henry of Lancaster assented to the deposition of Edward II in 1327, but fell out of favour with the regency of his widow Queen Isabella and Roger Mortimer. When Edward III, the son of Edward II, took personal control of the government in 1330, relations with the Crown improved, but by this time Henry of Lancaster was struggling with blindness and poor health. He was able to attend the new king&#x27;s coronation on 1 February 1327, where he knighted Edward. Grosmont was knighted the same year, represented his father in Parliament and attended the King&#x27;s council. He is known to have travelled a great deal between his father&#x27;s estates, presumably supervising their management. In 1331 he participated in a royal tournament at Cheapside in the City of London. It was, argues Fowler, conducive to Lancastrian relations with the crown that the new King and Grosmont were of a similar age and interests, and Grosmont was never to experience the reversals of fortune his father had faced.

== Estates and finances ==
Originally heir to only the lordships of Beaufort and Monmouth, by 1327 it was looking probable that he would inherit most of the Lancastrian patrimony. He was not yet independent from his father, from whom he received regular fundsamounting to £666 in 1332as well as grants from the English crown as a reward for his service and in recognition of his lack of a personal income. From early the next year, his father began transferring his South Wales estates into Grosmont&#x27;s name, giving him an independent income. In March 1337 he was one of six men Edward III promoted to higher levels of the peerage; one of his father&#x27;s lesser titles, the Earldom of Derby, was bestowed upon him. He was also granted a royal annuity of 1,000 marks (£ as of 2025) for so long as his father lived, and a number of lucrative estates and perquisites were settled on him. By this point Grosmont&#x27;s future relationship with the crown was &quot;actively assured&quot; comments Fowler.

The early 1340s were a period of financial constraint for Grosmont due to his acting as a broker for a number of loans between the King and Flemish bankers. As well as undergoing a number of periods of imprisonment as a debtor, Grosmont was eventually to raise numerous large sums, including £969 to gain the release of the royal crown, which Edward had pawned, and £1,500 worth of jewels to free the King after he had offered himself as security for loans.

==Scotland==
In 1328 Edward III&#x27;s regents had agreed to the Treaty of Northampton with Robert Bruce, King of Scotland (), but this was widely resented in England and commonly known as &quot;turpis pax&quot;, &quot;the cowards&#x27; peace&quot;. Some Scots nobles refused to swear fealty to Bruce and were disinherited. They left Scotland to join forces with Edward Balliol, son of King John Balliol (), whom Edward I had deposed in 1296. One of these was Grosmont&#x27;s father-in-law, Henry de Beaumont, Earl of Buchan and veteran campaigner of the First War of Scottish Independence. Robert Bruce died in 1329; his heir was 5-year-old David II (). In 1330 Edward III, who had recently assumed his full powers, made a formal request to the Scottish Crown to restore Beaumont&#x27;s lands which was refused. In 1331 the disinherited Scottish nobles gathered in Yorkshire, and led by Balliol and Beaumont plotted an invasion of Scotland. Edward III was aware of the scheme but turned a blind eye. Balliol&#x27;s forces sailed for Scotland on 31 July 1332. Five days after landing in Fife, Balliol&#x27;s force of some 2,000 men met the Scottish army of 12,000–15,000 men and crushed them at the Battle of Dupplin Moor. Balliol was crowned king of Scotland at Scone on 24 September 1332. Balliol&#x27;s support within Scotland was limited and within six months it had collapsed. He was ambushed by supporters of David II at the Battle of Annan a few months after his coronation and fled to England half-dressed and riding bareback. He appealed to Edward III for assistance.

On 10 March Balliol, the disinherited Scottish lords and some English magnates crossed the border and laid siege to the Scottish town of Berwick-upon-Tweed. Six weeks later a large English army under Edward III joined them, bringing the total number of besiegers to nearly 10,000. Grosmont was present at the siege, but it is not known if he marched with his father-in-law and Balliol, or with the main English effort. The Scots felt compelled to attempt to relieve the siege and an army of 20,000 men attacked the English at the Battle of Halidon Hill, from Berwick. Under intense bow-fire the Scottish army broke, the camp followers made off with the horses and the fugitives were pursued by the mounted English knights. Scottish casualties were numbered in thousands, including their commander and five earls dead on the field. Scots who surrendered were killed on Edward&#x27;s orders and some drowned as they fled into the sea. English casualties were reported as fourteen; some chronicles give a lower figure of seven. About a hundred Scots who had been taken prisoner were beheaded the next morning, 20July. It is presumed that Grosmont took part in the battle, but it is possible that he was part of the detachment posted to ensure that the garrison of Berwick did not sally. Berwick surrendered the day after the battle and Grosmont witnessed and sealed the articles of surrender and, a little later, the town&#x27;s new charter.

Balliol having sworn fealty to David II, and because he intended to make Scotland subservient to the English, most Scots refused to accept Balliol as their monarch. In December 1334 Grosmont accompanied Edward III to Roxburgh in Scotland. The English force of 4,000 accomplished little and withdrew in February. Grosmont was a member of Edward III&#x27;s negotiation team when a brief truce was agreed shortly after at Nottingham. In July Grosmont accompanied Edward III on another invasion of Scotland, with an army of 13,000for the time an extremely large force. Scotland was quelled as far north as Perth and Grosmont took a senior role in raiding deeper into the country. In 1336 Grosmont was given command of 500 men-at-arms and 1,000 longbowmen and marched to Perth. Informed that the widow of the Earl of Atholl was besieged in Lochindorb Castle, Grosmont led a small force to rescue her and raise the siege, which he had achieved by 16 July. He was given full plenipotentiary powers by the King. After Edward III reached Perth with the main English army, Grosmont was despatched on a long-range raid to Aberdeen, away. He returned after two weeks, having razed Aberdeen and devastated the country on the way. Edward went south for six weeks, leaving Grosmont in charge of English-occupied Scotland. Believing that he would soon be at war with France, Edward withdrew most of his forces from Scotland in mid-1336 and sent Grosmont to London to plan the defence of the English Channel ports from the mouth of the Thames westward. By May the following year he was once again in Scotland—accompanied by the Earls of Warwick and of Arundel—and by the time he returned to London, war with France had commenced. Fowler suggests that &quot;while in all these military enterprises Henry seldom played a leading role, they formed an invaluable apprenticeship for the years ahead&quot;.

== Northeast France ==
Grosmont&#x27;s first trip abroad was probably to Brabant in 1332. Six years later he travelled with Edward III to Flanders, which began inauspiciously when the King was &quot;unable to pay or induce&quot; his erstwhile allies to attack the French. Grosmont attended Edward&#x27;s ostentatious meeting with the Holy Roman Emperor, Louis IV, at Coblenz. This was a diplomatic mission amidst much pageantry; Edward III concluded agreements with a number of rulers, including Louis, whereby they would provide troops in exchange for payment. Edward was appointed Imperial vicar. To cement the Flemish alliance, and on account of Edward&#x27;s shortage of money, Grosmont and the Earl of Salisbury were imprisoned as sureties for Edward providing the balance of payment due his allies. Throughout the year French naval forces ravaged the English south coast. Edward III planned to invade France with his army of allies in 1339, but was finding it impossible to raise the money to pay them; he and his ambassadors had committed him to far greater expense than he could fund. Grosmont led part of Edward III&#x27;s army when it finally invaded France in September 1339. Cambrai was besieged, the area around it devastated, and an unsuccessful attempt made to storm the town. The allied army pressed further into France, but the French refused to battle. In mid-October, the French issued a formal challenge to battle. Edward accepted and occupied a strong defensive position at La Capelle which the French declined to attack; Grosmont commanded a detachment. Having run out of provisions, money and weather suitable for campaigning, the allied army withdrew and dispersed. Grosmont arrived in Brussels with the army at the end of October, where the campaign was celebrated with a tournament.

From 29 March to 3 April 1340 Grosmont attended Parliament in London, where a substantial subsidy was voted to the crown. Meanwhile, encouraged by Edward III, the Flemings, vassals of Philip VI, revolted during the winter. They joined forces with Edward&#x27;s continental allies and launched an April offensive, which failed. A French offensive against these forces commenced on 18 May, meeting with mixed fortunes; Edward&#x27;s outnumbered allies were desperate for the English army to reinforce them.

Grosmont was present at the great English victory in the naval Battle of Sluys in June 1340. The outnumbered English fleet attacked the French and captured or sank 190 of their 213 ships. French losses were between 16,000 and 20,000 killed. The joint French commanders were both captured and one was hanged from the mast of his own ship, while the other was beheaded. Soon after Grosmont was required to commit himself as a hostage in the Low Countries to merchants who had covered the debtsamounting to £9,450the King had incurred. Since Grosmont had personally bound himself to a number of Edward&#x27;s creditors, he was imprisoned as a debtor. He remained hostage until the next year and had to pay a large ransom for his release. He was only able to join the English army when it laid siege to Tournai as a result of promising that if he did not pay in full he would return voluntarily for a period of further imprisonment. In September Grosmont was part of the embassy which signed the Truce of Espléchin, a five-year suspension of the fighting. Edward was unable to raise the necessary funds to repay his loans and on 25 September Grosmont returned to Malines to, as the King wrote in October, &quot;lay in prison&quot; again. Grosmont was not treated poorly, although the King probably exaggerated his situation for domestic consumption. Grosmont was allowed out on parole to attend jousts several times and received five marks a day expenses. He eventually raised three loans between May and August 1341 to release his bond. Numerous other costs and charges were still due, negotiations over which dragged on until the next year when the King took over the debts.

On his return, he was made the king&#x27;s lieutenant in the north, or Scotland, and stayed at Roxburgh until 1342 when a six-month truce allowed a number of jousts and tournaments to take place. The next years he spent in diplomatic negotiations in the Low Countries, Castile and Avignon.

==Southwest France==
===1345===
1342-1345: War of the Breton Succession, Grosmont in &quot;Le Robynet&quot; at Sandwich etc.

Edward III decided early in 1345 to attack France on three fronts. The Earl of Northampton would lead a small force to Brittany, a slightly larger force would proceed to Gascony under the command of Grosmont, and the main English army would accompany Edward to either northern France or Flanders. Grosmont was appointed the King&#x27;s Lieutenant in Gascony on 13 March 1345 and received a contract to raise a force of 2,000 men in England, and further troops in Gascony. The highly detailed contract of indenture had a term of six months from the opening of the campaign in Gascony, with an option for Edward to extend it for a further six months on the same terms. Derby was given a high degree of autonomy, for example, his strategic instructions were: &quot;si guerre soit, et a faire le bien q&#x27;il poet&quot; (...if there is war, do the best you can...).

On 9 August 1345 Grosmont arrived in Bordeaux with 500 men-at-arms, 1,500 English and Welsh archers500 of the latter mounted on ponies to increase their mobilityancillary and support troops. Rather than continue the cautious war of sieges he was determined to strike directly at the French before they could concentrate their forces. He decided to move on Bergerac, which had good river supply links to Bordeaux, and would provide the Anglo-Gascon army with a base from which to carry the war to the French and sever communications between French forces north and south of the Dordogne. After eight years of defensive warfare by the Anglo-Gascons, there was no expectation among the French that they might make any offensive moves. Grosmont moved rapidly and took the French army at Bergerac by surprise on 26 August, decisively beating them in a running battle. French casualties were heavy, with many killed or captured. Derby&#x27;s share of the prisoner ransoms and the loot was estimated at £34,000, approximately four times the annual income from his lands.

Grosmont left a large garrison in the town and moved north with 6,000–8,000 men to Périgueux, the provincial capital of Périgord, which Grosmont blockaded, taking several strongholds on the main routes into the city. John, Duke of Normandy, the son and heir of Philip VI, gathered an army reportedly numbering over 20,000 and manoeuvred in the area. In early October a very large detachment relieved the city, drove off Grosmont&#x27;s force and started besieging the English-held strongpoints. A French force of 7,000 besieged the castle of Auberoche, east of Périgueux. A messenger got through to Grosmont, who was already returning to the area with a scratch force of 1,200 English and Gascon soldiers: 400 men-at-arms and 800 mounted archers.

After a night march Grosmont attacked the French camp on 21 October while they were at dinner, taking the French by surprise. There was a protracted hand-to-hand struggle, which ended when the commander of the small English garrison in the castle sortied and fell upon the rear of the French. They broke and fled. Derby&#x27;s mounted men-at-arms pursued them relentlessly. French casualties are uncertain but heavy. They are described by modern historians as &quot;appalling&quot;, &quot;extremely high&quot;, &quot;staggering&quot;, and &quot;heavy&quot;. Many French nobles were taken prisoner; lower ranking men were, as was customary, put to the sword. The ransoms alone made a fortune for many of the soldiers in Grosmont&#x27;s army, as well as Grosmont himself, who was said to have made at least £50,000 from the day&#x27;s captives. The Earl of Pembroke arrived after hostilities had ceased; Grosmont greeted him with the words, &quot;cousin Pembroke, welcome. You are just in time to sprinkle holy water upon the dead.&quot;

Grosmont&#x27;s four-month campaign has been described as &quot;the first successful land campaign of... the Hundred Years&#x27; War&quot;, which had commenced more than eight years earlier. Modern historians have praised the generalship demonstrated by Grosmont in this campaign: &quot;superb and innovative tactician&quot;; &quot;ris[ing] to the level of genius&quot;; &quot;brilliant in the extreme&quot;; &quot;stunning&quot;; &quot;brilliant&quot;.

===1346===

The Duke of Normandy was placed in charge of all French forces in southwest France in 1346, as he had been the previous autumn. In March 1346 a French army under Duke John, numbering between 15,000 and 20,000, enormously superior to any force the Anglo-Gascons could field, marched on the town of Aiguillon and besieged it on 1April. The town commanded the junction of the Rivers Garonne and Lot, meaning it was not possible for the French to sustain an offensive further into Gascony unless the town was taken. On 2April an &quot;arrière-ban&quot;, a formal call to arms for all able-bodied males, was announced for southern France. Grosmont, now known as Lancaster rather than Derby after the death of his father, sent an urgent appeal for help to Edward. Edward was not only morally obliged to succour his vassal, but also contractually required to; his indenture with Lancaster stated that if Lancaster were attacked by overwhelming numbers, then Edward &quot;shall rescue him in one way or another&quot;.

The garrison of Aiguillon, some 900 men, sortied repeatedly to interrupt the French operations, while Lancaster concentrated the main Anglo-Gascon force at La Réole, some away, as a threat. Duke John was never able to fully blockade the town, and found that his own supply lines were seriously harassed. On one occasion Grosmont used his main force to escort a large supply train into the town.

In July the main English army landed in northern France and moved towards Paris. Philip VI repeatedly ordered his son, Duke John, to break off the siege and bring his army north. Duke John, considering it a matter of honour, refused. By August, the French supply system had broken down, there was a dysentery epidemic in their camp, desertion was rife and Philip&#x27;s orders were becoming imperious. On 20 August the French abandoned the siege and their camp and marched away. Six days later the main French army was decisively beaten in the Battle of Crécy with very heavy losses, before Duke John&#x27;s army could reinforce them. The English then laid siege to the port of Calais.

Philip vacillated: on the day the siege of Calais began he disbanded most of his army, to save money and was convinced that Edward had finished his chevauchée (large-scale mounted raid) and would proceed to Flanders to ship his army home. On or shortly after 7September, Duke John made contact with Philip, having shortly before disbanded his own army. On 9September Philip announced that the army would reassemble at Compiègne on 1October, an impossibly short interval, and then march to the relief of Calais. Among other consequences, this equivocation allowed Grosmont in the south-west to launch offensives into Quercy and the Bazadais; and himself lead a chevauchée north through Saintonge, Aunis and Poitou, capturing numerous towns, castles and smaller fortified places and storming the rich city of Poitiers. These offensives completely disrupted the French defences in the region and shifted the focus of the fighting from the heart of Gascony to or more beyond its borders. Few French troops had arrived at Compiègne by 1October and as Philip and his court waited for the numbers to swell, news of Lancaster&#x27;s conquests came in. Believing that Lancaster was heading for Paris, the French changed the assembly point for any men not already committed to Compiègne to Orléans, and reinforced them with some of those already mustered, to block this. After Lancaster turned south to head back to Gascony, those Frenchmen already at or heading towards Orléans were redirected to Compiègne; French planning collapsed into chaos.

==Duke of Lancaster==

In 1345, while Grosmont was in France, his father died. The younger Henry was now Earl of Lancaster – the wealthiest and most powerful peer of the realm. He also inherited the Barony of Halton. After he participated in the Siege of Calais in 1347, the king honoured Lancaster by including him as a founding member and the second knight of the Order of the Garter in 1348. In the same year Alice de Lacy died and her life holdings (which she had retained after Thomas of Lancaster was executed), including the Honour of Bolingbroke and Bolingbroke Castle, passed to Grosmont. In 1351 Edward bestowed an even greater honour on Lancaster when he created him Duke of Lancaster. The title of duke was of relatively new origin in England; only one other English ducal title had previously existed.

In addition to this, the dukedom was given palatinate powers over the county of Lancashire, which entitled Grosmont to administer it virtually independently of the crown. This grant was quite exceptional in English history; only two other counties palatine existed: Durham, which was an ancient episcopal palatinate, and Chester, which was held by the crown. It is a sign of Edward&#x27;s high regard for Lancaster that he bestowed such extensive privileges on him. The two men were second cousins through their great-grandfather King Henry III and practically coeval (Edward was born in 1312), so it is natural to assume that a strong sense of camaraderie existed between them. Another factor that might have influenced the King&#x27;s decision was the fact that Henry had no male heir, so the grant of the dukedom was effectively made for Grosmont&#x27;s lifetime only, and not expected to be hereditary.

===1350–1352===
Grosmont was present at the naval victory at the Battle of Winchelsea in 1350. The King, Gaunt, Prince Edward and Grosmont each commanded their own ship; during the course of the battle where he allegedly saved the lives of the Black Prince and John of Gaunt, sons of Edward III. This vignette is one of the few we have of the battle, courtesy of Froissart, although the latter calls them picturesque. The last years of the decade were spent jousting on the continent, but by 1351 Grosmot had undertaken a crusade to Prussia, and while there, decided to join the Teutonic knights. However, he was captured and forced to pay a ransom of 30,000 crowns. By the time he arrived in Prussia, a truce had been signed with the heretics. He intended to return then to England, possibly via Poland, although he may have fought a separate campaign in Lithuania first. Heinrich von Herford reports that, soon after leaving the north, the Duke&#x27;s vanguard was robbed by Lithuanian knights, hence his decision to return to England through Cologne. Here he quarrelled with Otto, Duke of Brunswick, whom he publicly accused of intending to kidnap him in Westphalia. This almost led to a duel between the two men in Paris, which was only averted by the personal intervention of the French king who, Fowler suggests, was himself unclear which one was the injured party—Grosmont for his original accusation of kidnapping, or Brunswick for its unchivalric intimation. In the event, John held that Grosmont was the offended party. Travelling to Paris with a retinue of 50 knights, he was met sumpuously. Although John attempted to reconcile the two dukes, this proved impossible; it was not until the day of the joust that he declared the meeting void, with neither costs nor penalty for either to pay. While Grosmont&#x27;s duel may have come to nothing, argues Fowler, more importantly, his lengthy sojourn abroad allowed him to do intelligence on the French court and assess its military or political divisions.

==1356==
===Normandy===
Between then and 1355, Grosmont&#x27;s time and energies were mainly spent acting in a diplomatic capacity to the Papal Curia following the death of Pope Clement in December 1352 and the complex election of his successor, Innocent VI, whose overarching strategy was peace between France and England. With the collapse of 1354&#x27;s Treaty of Guînes, this policy proved unsuccessful, and by the following year full-scale war between England and France flared up again. On the English side, this may have been in part due to Grosmont&#x27;s intelligence reports, in which he probably reported the divisions in the French aristocracy under John while emphasising the useful contact he had made and the friendly overtures he had received from Charles, the new King of Navarre, who owned several strong—and strongly garrisoned—castles in Normandy, all of whose castellans, reports Rogers, &quot;were behind Edward to a man&quot;. It was not long, indeed, that money and enthusiasm for the war were running out in France. The modern historian Jonathan Sumption describes the French national administration as &quot;fall[ing] apart in jealous acrimony and recrimination&quot;. Much of the north of France was openly defying John and a contemporary chronicler recorded &quot;the King of France was severely hated in his own realm&quot;. Arras rebelled and its citizens killed loyalists. The major nobles of Normandy refused to pay taxes. On 5 April 1356 they were dining at the table of John&#x27;s eldest son (the ), Charles, when John arrived, accompanied by armed men, and arrested ten of the most outspoken; four were summarily executed. One of those imprisoned was the notoriously treacherous Charles of Navarre, one of the largest landholders in Normandy. The Norman nobles who had not been arrested, sent to Navarre for reinforcements. On receiving news of this, Louis began raising troops. The Norman nobles also turned to Edward for assistance. John&#x27;s army took control of most of Normandy and laid siege to those rebel-held fortifications which refused to surrender. John&#x27;s son Charles, who as well as being the was the Duke of Normandy, took charge of suppressing these holdouts.
Navarre&#x27;s partisans negotiated an alliance with Edward. The English had been preparing an expedition to Brittany under Grosmont, as part of the War of the Breton Succession. Edward diverted this to Normandy to support the French rebels. On 1 June 1356 an initial force of 140 men-at-arms, 200 archers and 1,400 horses left Southampton in 48 ships for the beaches near St. Vaast la Hogue in the north-east Cotentin. Horses transported in the ships of the day needed several days rest to recover, otherwise, they were liable to collapse, or even die, when ridden. On 18 June Grosmont arrived and brought the English strength up to 500 men-at-arms and 800 longbowmen. They were reinforced by 200 Normans under Philip of Navarre. The English commander Robert Knolles joined Lancaster in Montebourg with a further 800 men detached from English garrisons in Brittany. The historian Clifford Rogers suggests that these 2,300 men were reinforced by up to 1,700 men from Navarrese-held fortifications over the following month.

===Chevauchée===
Lancaster&#x27;s main objective was to relieve the besieged Navarrese strongholds of Pont-Audemer, Breteuil and Tillières-sur-Avre. Lancaster&#x27;s small army set off into French-controlled Normandy on 24 June. Their journey took the form of a . All participants were mounted and moved relatively rapidly for armies of the period. Villages were looted and razed, as were towns and fortifications weak enough to be easily captured; stronger places were ignored. Parties spread out from the main line of travel so that a broad swathe of France was pillaged and devastated. Grosmont was prepared for a set-piece battle if necessary, but was not actively seeking one. His small army arrived at Pont-Audemer after covering more than in four days. The town was close to falling, as the French had nearly succeeded in driving mines under its walls. They fled on hearing of Grosmont&#x27;s approach, abandoning their baggage and siege equipment. The English spent two days provisioning the town and filling in the French excavations. Detaching 100 men to reinforce the garrison, Grosmont marched south on 2 July. On the 4th he reached Conches-en-Ouche, stormed it and razed it. The next day Breteuil was reached, its besiegers having retired in good order, and was resupplied sufficiently to stand a siege for a year.

Meanwhile, John had left Chartres with a large force, initially establishing himself at Mantes. When Grosmont marched east, John believed he was striking for Rouen, and moved his army there. John also took steps to block the fords across the Seine, in the belief Grosmont may have been heading for Calais. Once it became clear Grosmont was moving south from Pont-Audemer, John followed. Just to the south of Breteuil was the capital of lower Normandy, Verneuil. The English continued their march on 4 July to Verneuil, seized it, looted it and took prisoner anyone whom it was considered might be worth a ransom. The richest men in the district had fortified themselves in Verneuil&#x27;s strong keep with their families and valuables. The historian Alfred Burne hypothesises that French siege equipment had been captured at Pont-Audemer and made storming fortified places a more viable proposition than earlier in the , when they were avoided. In any event, the keep was assaulted; many English are recorded as being wounded, but none were killed. At 6:00 am on the 6th its defenders negotiated a surrender: they were permitted to leave, but on condition they abandon all of their possessions. These were looted and the keep was then demolished. The attack on Verneuil was probably motivated by the prospect of looting a rich town; no attempt was made to relieve Navarrese-held Tillières-sur-Avre, to the east.

By the time the demolition of the keep at Verneuil was complete, on the evening of 6 July, reports on the approach of the French army were being received. It was much stronger than the English force; Rogers describes it as &quot;vastly superior ... in numbers&quot; with perhaps ten times the number of men. It had moved to Condé-sur-Iton from Rouen and so was from the freshly provisioned Breteuil and only from Verneuil. On the 7th Grosmont rested his men and horses, but they did so in battle order outside Verneuil in case of a French attack. The French at Condé-sur-Iton also rested, having marched hard to get there in two days from Rouen; John probably also wished for all of his stragglers and detachments to join his army before offering battle. On the 8th the English marched west to L&#x27;Aigle. The French army was 2 or 3 miles (3 to 5 km) away. John sent heralds to Grosmont inviting him to commit his force to a formal battle. Lancaster replied ambiguously, but John, convinced that Grosmont&#x27;s main reason for landing in Normandy was to seek a battle, believed an agreement to fight the next day had been reached and camped for the night.

The next morning the French prepared themselves for battle, watched from a distance by a detachment of Navarrese cavalry, and moved off at noon. The English had broken camp during the night and set off on a long march of to Argentan. Attempting a pursuit was clearly hopeless, so the French returned to Breteuil and re-established their siege. A force was sent to Tillières-sur-Avre, which promptly capitulated. The English returned to Montebourg on 13 July. In 22 days the English had travelled , a remarkable effort for the period. The three-week expedition had been very successful: two of the besieged towns had been resupplied, the participants had seized a large amount of loot, including many horses, damage had been done to the French economy and prestige, the alliance with the Norman nobles had been cemented, there had been few casualties and the French King had been distracted from the Black Prince&#x27;s preparations for a greater in south-west France.

===Loire campaign===

In August 1356 Grosmont marched south from eastern Brittany in another . It was his intention to join the army of Edward, the Black Prince, the eldest son of Edward III. This had marched north from Bergerac on 8 August. It was planned that the two would meet in the general vicinity of Tours. Grosmont brought with him from Normandy 2,500 men. He also had under his command over 2,000 men garrisoning the English-held fortifications of Brittany. The extent to which he added the men from these garrisons to the troops from Normandy is not known. Due to the unseasonable fullness of the River Loire, across which the French had destroyed or strongly fortified all the bridges, Lancaster was unable to effect a junction. In early September he abandoned the attempt to force a crossing at Les Ponts-de-Cé and returned to Brittany. En route he captured and garrisoned a substantial number of French strong-points.

The Black Prince also returned towards his starting point, but his delay in waiting for Lancaster near Tours enabled a French army under the command of their king to overtake him. As a result, the Prince was forced to commit to the Battle of Poitiers, where the French were heavily defeated and King John was captured.; 

==1356–1360==

Returning to Brittany from the Loire campaign, Grosmont laid siege to its capital, Rennes. He participated in the last great offensive of the first phase of the Hundred Years&#x27; War: the Rheims campaign of 1359–1360. Then he was appointed principal negotiator for the Treaty of Brétigny. This marked the end of the first phase of the Hundred Years&#x27; War with the English achieving very favourable terms.

==Death and burial==

After returning to England in November 1360, he fell ill early the next year, and died at Leicester Castle on 23 March 1361. It is possible that the cause of death was the plague, which that year was making a second visitation to England. Mortimer argues against the plague being the cause of death, as Grosmont made his will ten days before his death, a space of time inconsistent with the usual swift progress of the plague and his illness and death in early 1361 is inconsistent with reports of the spread of plague in England beginning in May. He was buried in the Church of the Annunciation of Our Lady of the Newarke, Leicester, which he had built within the religious and charitable institution founded by his father next to Leicester Castle, and where he had reburied his father some years previously.

By the time of his death, Grosmont had participated in 15 military missions, leading 6 of them; been the King&#x27;s lieutenant 7 times; led 6 significant embassies; and taken part in 12 truce conferences. A chronicler writing thirty-five years after his death described him as &quot;one of the best warriors in the world&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Grosmont&#x27;s mother died when he was about 12 and he first appears in official records at the age of 14. At about age 18, he married Isabel of Beaumont; daughter of Henry de Beaumont, Earl of Buchan and veteran campaigner of the First War of Scottish Independence. He and Isabel had two daughters. The eldest was Maud of Lancaster (4 April 1340 – 10 April 1362), who married William I, Duke of Bavaria in 1352. The younger was Blanche of Lancaster (25 March 1345/1347 – 12 September 1368), who married her third cousin John of Gaunt (1340–1399), the third of five surviving sons of Edward III. Gaunt inherited Lancaster&#x27;s possessions, and he was granted the ducal title the following year, but it was not until 1377, when Edward was largely incapacitated, that Gaunt was able to recover the palatinate rights for the County of Lancaster. When Gaunt&#x27;s son by Blanche, Henry of Bolingbroke, usurped the crown in 1399 and became King Henry IV, the vast Lancaster inheritance, including the Honour of Bolingbroke and the Lordship of Bowland, was merged with the Crown as the Duchy of Lancaster, which survives to this day as the holding entity for the monarch&#x27;s private investment assets.

== Character ==

More is known about Lancaster&#x27;s character than that of most of his contemporaries through his memoirs, the &quot;Livre de Seyntz Medicines&quot; (&quot;Book of the Holy Doctors&quot;), a highly personal treatise on matters of religion and piety, also containing details of historical interest. It reveals that Lancaster, at the age of 44 when he wrote the book in 1354, suffered from gout. The book is primarily a devotional work, organised around seven wounds which Henry claimed to have received, representing the seven deadly sins. Lancaster confesses to his sins, explains various real and mythical medical remedies in terms of their theological symbolism, and exhorts the reader to greater morality.

==Genealogical table==
A third generation of the House of Lancaster, Henry was related to the most prominent people in early 14th-century England.

<text>The Antonov An-26 (NATO reporting name: Curl) is a twin-engined turboprop civilian and military transport aircraft, designed and produced in the Soviet Union from 1969 to 1986. It is the third member of the Antonov An-24 family, coming after the An-24 and An-30, while preceeding the An-32 and canceled An-132.

==Development==
While the An-24T tactical transport had proved successful in supporting Soviet troops in austere locations, its ventral loading hatch restricted the handling of cargo, and in particular vehicles, and made it less effective than hoped in parachuting men and supplies. As a result, interest in a version with a retractable cargo ramp increased, and the Antonov design bureau decided in 1966 to begin development on the new An-26 derivative, in advance of an official order. The cargo ramp was based on that design and allowed the cargo deck to be sealed and pressurised in flight. When loading cargo, it could either be lowered to allow vehicles to be driven in, or slid beneath the aircraft&#x27;s fuselage, so that cargo could be loaded straight in off a truck bed. In March 1968, the OKB received official permission to begin development. Particular attention was given to the military mission, and the majority of early An-26 production was delivered to the VTA (voyenno-transportnaya aviatsiya).

Using the majority of the An-24 airframe, it has high-set cantilevered wings, wing-mounted twin turboprops with a turbojet engine in the starboard nacelle for use as an auxiliary power unit and also for extra take-off thrust, plus long main undercarriage legs. The An-26 includes military equipment, such as tip-up paratroop canvas seats, an overhead traveling hoist, bulged observation windows and parachute static line attachment cables. It can be configured in 20-30 minutes from the troop transport or freight mission to the medical evacuation role with up to 24 stretchers fitted.

The An-26 made its public debut at the 27th Paris Air Show at Le Bourget where the second prototype, CCCP-26184 (c/n00202), was shown in the static aircraft park.

The An-26 is also manufactured without a license agreement in China by the Xian Aircraft factory as the Y-14, later changed to be included in the Xian Y7 series.

===Total production===
==Operational history==
The An-26 has a secondary bomber role with underwing bomb racks. The racks are attached to the fuselage in front of and behind the rear landing gear. In the bombing role it was extensively used by the Vietnam People&#x27;s Air Force during the Cambodian–Vietnamese War and Sudanese Air Force during the Second Sudanese Civil War and the War in Darfur. Russian Forces have also trained with the An-26 as a bomber. In 1977, the Afghan Air Force received the An-26 aircraft and in 1986, they had 36 of them which were used for airborne assaults conducted by the Afghan Army&#x27;s commando and parachute battalions and two military transport squadrons.

One An-26 was involved in the Purulia Incident in 1995 in which arms were dropped in the Purulia district of West Bengal, India. The reason behind the drop is not disclosed to the public due to national security.

The Bristol Mountains are directly to the west, the Old Woman Mountains are to the southeast, and Pisgah Crater and the Bullion Mountains are to the southwest. The Mountains lie east of the small community of Kelso, northeast of Ludlow, and north of Amboy. This mountain range lies within the Mojave National Preserve, in the National Park Service system.

The fauna and flora of the Granite Mountains are typical of this part of the Mojave Desert. Pinyon pine, juniper, and various shrubs and grasses characterize their higher elevations and north-facing slopes. Their lower elevations and south-facing slopes characteristically are more sparsely covered by yucca, cacti, creosote, and other shrubs. Numerous numerous springs and water seeps occur within these mountains.

==Sweeney Granite Mountains Desert Research Center==
The University of California, Riverside, operates the Sweeney Granite Mountains Desert Research Center within the Mojave National Preserve. It is a research and teaching center that was established by the late Professor Dr. Kenneth Norris] of U.C. Santa Cruz in 1978 and is now managed out of University of California, Riverside. Students and faculty have completed extensive studies of the natural history of the Granite Mountains since the reserve&#x27;s inception.

==Geology==
The Granite Mountains contains outcrops of rock and sediments ranging in age from Paleozoic to Cenozoic. The Granite Mountains are largely underlain by Mesozoic, Jurassic and Cretaceous, intrusive rocks. At the higher elevations, small roof pendants composed of either Paleozoic dolomite, limestone, or marble occur enclosed within the Mesozoic intrusive rocks. The Cenozoic strata consist of Miocene dikes, late Cenozoic fanglomerates and breccias, and Quaternary alluvium.

===Jurassic intrusive suite===
The overwhelming majority of the Granite Mountains consists of intrusive rocks in the form of different types of granite, monzonite, and diorite. The exact nomenclature used for each of these types varies from author to author because of differences in the classification system used by each author. These rocks can be divided into Jurassic and Cretaceous intrusive suites. As one time, the oldest of the Jurassic intrusive rocks were tentatively thought to be Triassic in age.

The oldest of the Jurassic intrusive rocks consist of hornblende-quartz diorite gneiss and hornblende-quartz monzodiorite gneiss. Both gneisses contain megacrysts of potassium feldspar that are 2–10 cm across. These gneisses have a quartz-poor, potassium feldspar-rich composition and are cross-cut by younger Jurassic diorites. An xenolith of laminated calc-silicate hornfel found within the gneiss suggests that the gneisses postdate Triassic (c) calcsilicate rocks. The gneissic rocks also contain xenoliths of amphibolite[ and biotite-rich diorite.

In the Granite Mountains, the younger Jurassic intrusive rocks consist of plutons of quartz monzonite and quartz diorite. Along the east side of the Granite Mountains, outcrops of the quartz monzonite contains phenocrysts of medium-grained, lavender, potassium feldspar. The quartz diorite is heterogeneous in texture and composition and much of it consists of fine-grained foliated metadiorite. Other Jurassic intrusive rocks of varying composition, e.g. fine-grained, inclusion-spotted quartz monzonite; medium-grained quartz monzodiorite; and syenogranite, intrude the Jurassic quartz monzonite and quartz diorite to varying extents within the north, west, and northeast sides of the Granite Mountains. The Jurassic intrusive suites are metamorphosed, foliated, and locally intricately folded throughout most of the Granite Mountains. Geobarometric studies indicate shallow crustal depths, below the surface, for intrustion and solidification of a Late Jurassic pluton from the nearby southern Providence Mountains.

===Cretaceous intrusive suite===
Within the Granite Mountains, the Cretaceous intrusive suite consists of a granodiorite pluton, a zoned pluton, and many granite, aplite, and pegmatite dikes. Within the western part of the Granite Mountains, the granodiorite pluton forms a sheet-like intrusion that dips west at moderate angles. The larger zoned pluton occupies all of the southeastern part of the Granite Mountains. It exhibits a discontinuous outer zone of porphyritic monzogranite that grades inward into nonporphyritic monzogranite at its center. Estimates made from geobarometry indicate mid-crustal depths, about below the surface, of intrusion and solidification for the Cretaceous plutons of the Granite Mountains.

===Pre-Mesozoic roof pendants===
At higher elevations within the Granite Mountains, Pre-Mesozoic metasedimentary rocks occur as roof pendants enclosed within the Mesozoic intrusive rocks. These metasedimentary rocks consist mainly of marble, siliceous marble, dolomite marble, and calcsilicate hornfels. Some of the marble and siliceous marble currently are lithologically correlated with the Pennsylvanian to Permian Bird Spring Formation and Mississippian Monte Cristo Limestone. Wollastonite and phlogopite occur in the siliceous marble. The calcsilicate hornfels include laminated calc-silicate hornfels that are tentatively correlated with Triassic sedimentary strata. Also associated with the calcareous metasedimentary rocks are skarns. These skarns contain diopside, garnet, quartz, and epidote. The skarns contain the only mineralization of economic consequence in these Mountains.

===Cenozoic rocks===
The Cenozic age rocks and sediments found within the consist of Miocene dikes, late Cenozoic alluvial fans, and Quaternary alluvium and alluvial fans. Within the Granite Mountains, the Jurassic-Cretaceous intrusive suites are cut by west-northwest-striking rhyolite dikes. They are inferred to be Miocene in age based on the abundance of Miocene volcanic rocks of similar composition in the region. On the north and northeast sides of the Granite Mountains and southeast of Granite Pass, Pliocene and Pleistocene fanglomerates and sedimentary breccias form large alluvial fans where they either overlie or are locally in fault contact with Mesozoic intrusive rocks. Quaternary alluvium forms a thin blanket that extends around the base of the Granite Mountains.

==Geologic history==
The geologic history that is recorded in the outcropping rocks of the Granite Mountains and surrounding Mojave Desert region spans more than 1,760 million years. The oldest rocks found exposed in this region, but not in the Granite Mountains, are Early Proterozoic gneisses that underwent intense regional metamorphism about 1,700 Ma. These rocks were later intruded by granitic rocks from about 1,695 to 1,650 Ma and at about 1,400 Ma. A final period of Proterozoic magmatic activity occurred about 1,100 Ma with the intrusion of diabase dikes during a period of continental rifting. Afterwards the volcanoes and orogenic mountain ranges formed during these periods of magmatism were eroded down to their roots during an extended period of tectonic inactivity.

During the latest Proterozoic, Paleozoic, and early Mesozoic, this part of the Mojave Desert was a passive margin along the western edge of the North American craton. Within this passive margin, sedimentary strata accumulated lying unconformably across a deeply eroded surface underlian by Proterozoic gneissic and granitic rocks. These sedimentary rocks accumulated in marine and, less commonly, continental environments along the western edge of the North American craton. The Triassic (?) calc-silicate hornfel xenolith and limestone, dolomite, and marble roof pendants found within the Granite Mountains are all that remain of this once several kilometer-thick blanket of passive margin sedimentary strata that covered this region.

Beginning in the Mesozoic, widespread magmatism affected the region as ancient continental-margin volcanic arcs formed parallel to the western edge of the North America craton. The bodies of Jurassic granite, monzonite, and diorite found in the Granite Mountains formed as intrusions of magma of slight alkaline affinities that fed volcanoes. These volcanoes formed the eastern edge of volcanic arcs lying along the western edge of the North American craton. The magma bodies solidified about below the surface. As the western edge of the North America craton was built westward, subsequent magmatism produced intrusions and volcanism of calc-alkaline affinities that are typical of continental magmatic arcs. The Cretaceous granodiorite and monzogranite exposed in the Granite Mountains were intruded and solidified about below the surface during this period. Also, during the middle to late Mesozoic, the region underwent shortening forming a fold and thrust belt. This tectonism formed mountain ranges that were uplifted and subsequently deeply eroded as to remove all traces of Mesozoic volcanoes and their deposits in this region.

During the early part of the Cenozoic, a period of tectonic quiescence characterized the region. In the Miocene, tectonic activity stretched crust of this region, resulting in the opening of dikes that filled with magma that fed volcanoes within the region. It was at this time, the rhyolite dikes within the Granite Mountains were formed. Also, further uplifting occurred such that extensive erosion produced broad pediment domes in the Granite Mountains region. During the Quaternary erosion has continued to lower the pediment domes and mountain ranges and to supply sediments to adjacent valleys.

==Mining==
The Granite Mountains lack any significant mineral resources. The significant sites of past mining activity lying within the Granite Mountains are the Comanche Mine, the Silver Lode Mine, and the Iron Victory Prospect. None of these mines and prospects contain ore deposits large enough to constitute an economic resource.

First, the Comanche Mine was first named and patented as mineral claim in 1902. It was known as the &quot;El Companche Mine&quot; in 1925; as the &quot;Comanche Mine&quot; in the 1950&#x27;s; and last known as the &quot;Christopher Mine&quot; in 1965. When visited by United States Geological Survey geologists in 1982, there were no claims on the property. Although called a &quot;mine&quot;, it never commercially produce any ore. The Comanche Mine cuts into a roof pendant consisting of Paleozoic dolomitic marble. The marble consists of 41 to 45 percent calcium oxide and 14 to 16 percent magnesium oxide. Locally, the marble contains disseminated copper and iron minerals.

Second, the Silver Lobe Mine initially started out as a cluster of patented mineral claims around 1902 known as the &quot;Pine Ridge Mine&quot;. It later became the &quot;Silver Queen&quot; when additional claims were patented in 1919. Most of the work at the Silver Lobe was conducted in the 1930s. It became the Silver Lobe Mine when two additional mineral claims were filed in 1978 and later was renamed the &quot;McCoy Mine&quot; when a group of 10 lode claims was filed in 1982. At this mine, silver, copper, lead, and zinc minerals are dispersed along joints and in quartz veins in granitic bedrock. The Silver Lobe Mine never produced commercial quantities of ore.

Finally, claims for iron ore were patented in the vicinity of the Iron Victory Prospect as early as 1912. The claims directed associated with the Iron Victory Prospect were located in 1942 and patented January 26, 1956. These claims explored lenses of magnetite and hematite associated with a skarn zone in a marble roof pendant. Some of these lenses also contain some chalcopyrite. The iron ore deposits of Iron Victory Prospect are too small to be commercially mined.

<text>The Antonov An-28 (NATO reporting name Cash) is a twin-engined light turboprop transport aircraft, developed from the Antonov An-14M. It was the winner of a competition against the Beriev Be-30, for use by Aeroflot as a short-range airliner. It first flew in 1969. A total of 191 were built and 16 remain in airline service as at August 2015. After a short pre-production series built by Antonov, it was licence-built in Poland by PZL-Mielec. In 1993, PZL-Mielec developed its own improved variant, the PZL M28 Skytruck.

==Development==
The An-28 is similar to the An-14 in many aspects, including its wing structure and twin rudders, but features an expanded fuselage and turboprop engines, in place of the An-14&#x27;s piston engines. The An-28 first flew as a modified An-14 in 1969. The next preproduction model did not fly until 1975. In passenger carrying configuration, accommodation was provided for up to 15 people, in addition to the two-man crew. Production was transferred to PZL-Mielec in 1978. The first Polish-built aircraft did not fly until 1984. The An-28 finally received its Soviet type certificate in 1986.

<doc id="908197" wikidata="Q6196249" url="?curid=908197" title="Jim Ladd">
<text>James William Ladd (January 17, 1948 – December 17, 2023) was an American disc jockey, radio producer and writer. He was one of the last notable remaining freeform rock DJs in United States commercial radio.

Ladd first gained national prominence as host of the hour long nationally syndicated radio program &quot;Innerview&quot;, which aired weekly on over 160 stations nationwide for twelve years.

== Biography ==
=== Early years and KMET ===
Ladd began his career in 1969 at KNAC, a small Long Beach rock station. After two years there, he moved to Los Angeles station KLOS. In 1974 he moved to KMET, known to its legions of listeners as &quot;The Mighty Met&quot;, where he would remain for most of the next 13 years (returning to KLOS in 1984, but going back to KMET again, 2 months before they changed format), while also hosting and producing &quot;Innerview&quot;, an hour-long nationally syndicated interview program that aired during the same period.

After what many listeners and people in the industry perceived as a long steady decline in the station&#x27;s output, attributed by most accounts to the station&#x27;s decision to bring in consultant Lee Abrams and the strict &quot;album-oriented rock&quot; formatting he favored, KMET management shocked southern California and all of radio by abruptly dumping rock music, the call letters, and the entire air staff on February 14, 1987, becoming KTWV (&quot;The Wave&quot;), featuring a new age format with no DJs at all.

=== Jumping station to station, and side projects ===
In 1987, Ladd appeared on Pink Floyd bassist Roger Waters&#x27; second solo album &quot;Radio K.A.O.S.&quot;, portraying a fictional disk jockey named DJ Jim who talks to the album&#x27;s protagonist, a handicapped boy named Billy. Ladd joined Waters on the tour that followed, and appeared in the three music videos for the album. Ladd also played an all-night DJ in Cameron Crowe&#x27;s 1989 film &quot;Say Anything...&quot;. Ladd&#x27;s work has also been featured in major motion pictures such as &quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot;, &quot;Rush&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s Out of Control&quot;, and &quot;Defendor&quot; starring Woody Harrelson.

For several years, Ladd worked only on-and-off on the radio because he refused to follow a playlist, as most station owners demanded. In the late 1980s, Ladd worked at KMPC-FM, where he helped to shape its &quot;Full Spectrum Rock&quot; blend of classic and modern rock and was enthusiastic about its rebranding as KEDG &quot;the Edge&quot; in March 1989. However, Ladd was laid off when the station abruptly abandoned its rock format two months later.

In 1991 Ladd released a semi-autobiographical book titled &quot;Radio Waves: Life And Revolution On The FM Dial&quot; (St. Martin&#x27;s Press), based on his radio career and the rise and fall of freeform rock radio in LA, from the genesis of freeform on the West Coast through the demise of KMET in 1987. The names of many people and radio stations Ladd encountered during that two-decade period were swapped for pseudonyms; however, Raechel Donahue has said that she insisted Ladd use her real name and that of her late husband Tom Donahue in the book. David Perry, Ace Young, Jack Snyder, Damion, and the late personalities B. Mitchel Reed and J. J. Jackson, were also among those identified by their actual &quot;air names&quot;.

That same year, Ladd was hired by KLSX. In July 1995, Ladd and the entire KLSX staff were summarily fired as the station abruptly changed its format to talk radio.

=== Free-form show on KLOS and the internet ===
Ladd and his free-form rock music returned to KLOS in 1997 and aired until October 26, 2011, Monday thru Thursday from 10PM to 2AM (PDT) and on Sunday from 9PM to Midnight. His show routinely led its time slot in Arbitron ratings. KLOS renewed his contract in January 2007. In addition, he produced, wrote, and narrated a number of nationally syndicated programs, including interviews, concert specials and album premieres.

Later, Ladd used his MySpace and Facebook pages to interact with his listeners, whom he referred to as &quot;The Tribe.&quot; He often took requests in the comments section and used the site as a source to promote free form radio. Beginning March 10, 2008, Ladd&#x27;s show was streamed on KLOS&#x27;s web site.

On October 26, 2011, Ladd was among various staffers fired from KLOS following the acquisition of station owner Citadel Broadcasting by Cumulus Media.

On November 5, 2011, Ladd gave a three-hour farewell broadcast on AM station KFI in Los Angeles.

=== Sirius XM ===
On December 2, 2011, Sirius XM Radio announced that Jim Ladd would host a live, daily free-form music show on Deep Tracks, channel 27 (now 308). This show ran from January 2012 to December 2023.

=== Hollywood Walk of Fame ===
On May 6, 2005, Ladd received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in recognition of the first 38 years of his groundbreaking radio career at 7018 Hollywood Boulevard. Friend Jackson Browne made a speech.

=== Personal life and death ===
Ladd was married to writer, poet and musician Helene Hodge. He died of a heart attack on December 17, 2023, at the age of 75.

<doc id="908198" wikidata="Q607609" url="?curid=908198" title="Antonov An-30">
<text>The Antonov An-30 (NATO reporting name: Clank), is a development of the An-24 designed for aerial cartography. It is the second member of the Antonov An-24 family, succeeding the An-24, while preceeding the An-26, An-32 and canceled An-132.

==Development==

The first aerial survey version of the Antonov An-24 was designed by the Beriev OKB and designated An-24FK. The FK stood for &quot;fotokartograficheskiy&quot; (photo mapping). The prototype was converted from a production An-24A at Beriev&#x27;s No. 49 construction shop during 1966. The An-24FK made its first flight on 21 August 1967, with state acceptance trials being completed in 1970 and civil certification completed in 1974. Redesignated An-30, production began in 1971 at the Antonov factory. 123 production An-30s were manufactured between 1971 and 1980 in Kiev in two main versions.

===Total production===
==Design==
The Antonov An-30 is a derivative of the An-24, fitted with an entirely new fuselage forward of frame 11. The fuselage nose is extensively glazed. Housed within the new nose section are the navigator and precise navigational equipment, including an optical sight for ensuring accuracy of aerial photography. To enable accurate and repeatable survey flights, standard equipment for the An-30 included computer flight path control technology. This additional equipment replaced the radar on the An-24. The positioning of the new navigational equipment required the flightdeck to be raised by 41 cm in comparison to the An-24, giving the aircraft its other main feature, a hump containing the cockpit.

The radio operator and flight engineer sat in the first cabin aft of and below the flightdeck. The mission equipment was located further aft, in a cabin featuring five camera windows in the floor. Each camera window could be closed with covers to protect the glass panels. The covers were located in special fairings protruding from the fuselage underside. In the normal aerial photography role, four or five cameras were carried aboard. Three cameras were mounted vertically, intended for mapping purposes. The remaining two cameras were pointed at an angle of 28° on each side of the aircraft, for oblique photography. The same fuselage compartment contained workstations for two camera operators and a crew rest area.

The aircraft&#x27;s cameras could be used between 2,000 and 7,000 m (6,500 and 23,000 ft) and the scale of the resultant photographs was between 1:200,000 and 1:15,000,000. The aircraft was supplied with four or five cameras.

The An-30 was powered by two Ivchenko AI-24VT turboprops with a takeoff rating of 2,820 ehp.

==Operational history==

In addition to its principal use as a survey aircraft, it has also been used by Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Romania, Russia and Ukraine to carry out surveillance under the Open Skies Treaty.

The An-30 has also been used as a weather control aircraft as the An-30M. Some have been fitted with frozen tanks of carbon dioxide to be ejected into the sky to form artificial rain clouds. These An-30s have also been put to use to avoid crop-damaging hailstorms and also to maintain good weather for, as examples, new airplane maiden flights, important parades like 1 May and the 850th anniversary of Moscow in September 1997.

Between 1971 and 1980 a total of 115 aircraft were built and 23 were sold abroad to Afghanistan, Bulgaria, China, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Mongolia and Vietnam.

An-30s completely mapped Afghanistan in 1982, with one shot down by a MANPADS during an aerial photography flight in the Kabul area south of the Panjshir Valley on 11 March 1985.
Cuban An-30s saw active service in Angola in 1987.

On 22 April 2014, a Ukrainian An-30 was hit by pro-Russian separatists&#x27; small-arms fire while on a surveillance mission over the town of Sloviansk in eastern Ukraine. The plane landed safely with minor damage. On 6 June 2014, a Ukrainian An-30B was shot down near the city of Slavyansk in eastern Ukraine, reportedly by a MANPADS fired by local separatists.

== Accidents ==

* On 23 May 2012, a Russian Open Skies An-30 caught fire during an emergency landing at an airport outside the Czech city of Caslav. According to unconfirmed reports, the accident occurred because the crew were unable to extend the landing gear. Seven passengers were injured, out of fourteen Russian and nine Czech citizens on board.
* On 3 October 2018, a Sudan Air Force An-30 crashed while landing at Khartoum airport.

== Variants ==
;An-24FK
:The sole prototype converted from an An-24B with a navigator&#x27;s station in an extensively glazed nose and elevated cockpit to give clearance for mission equipment.

;An-30D &quot;Sibiryak&quot;
:Long-range version of the An-30A with increased fuel capacity, developed in 1990. Five aircraft were converted to An-30Ds. All were based at Myachkovo airfield near Moscow. This variant was used for ice monitoring, fisheries monitoring and as a transport aircraft. It had improved communication equipment, including a data-link system. Rescue equipment was also carried on board.

;An-30FG
:Czech designation for the single Czech Air Force An-30, after being retrofitted with a western weather radar.

;An-30M &quot;Meteozashchita&quot;
:Version equipped for weather research. It can spray dry ice into the atmosphere for weather control duties. The dry ice was stored in eight containers per 130 kg instead of the photographic equipment.

;An-30R
:A production An-30 CCCP-30055/RA-30055(c/n1101) converted to an NBC reconnaissance aircraft with air-sampling pods under the forward fuselage and other sensors for monitoring nuclear, biological and chemical warfare by-products. A second example, 30080, was acquired by the VVS, and had a single sampling pod on the port pylon and provision for dropping large flare bombs from the starboard pylon. An-30R RA-30055 was used for monitoring the plume from the Chernobyl No.4 nuclear reactor fire and became permanently radioactive in the process, being withdrawn from use immediately afterwards.

<text>The Antonov An-32 (NATO reporting name: Cline) is a turboprop twin-engined military transport aircraft. Its first flight was in July 1976 and displayed at the 1977 Paris Air Show. It is oriented towards flying in adverse weather conditions, and was produced from 1980 to 2012, and remains in service. It is the fourth member of the Antonov An-24 family, succeeding the An-24, An-30 and An-26, and coming before the canceled An-132.

==Design and development==
The An-32 is essentially a re-engined An-26. It is designed to withstand adverse weather conditions better than the standard An-26. Announced at the May 1977 Paris Air Show, the An-32 is distinguished from its predecessor by engines raised 1.5 m above the wing in order to avoid foreign object damage on rough, unprepared air strips.

The type features high-lift wings with automatic leading-edge slats, large triple-slotted trailing edge flaps and an enlarged tailplane and a very large increase in power, giving improved take-off performance and service ceiling. The high placement of the engine nacelles above the wing allowed for larger diameter propellers, which are driven by 5,100 hp rated Ivchenko AI-20 turboprop engines, providing almost twice the power of the An-26&#x27;s AI-24 powerplants.

Production from the Government Aircraft Factory in Kyiv, has included 123 aircraft for the Indian Air Force, which ordered the aircraft under strong foreign relations between then USSR leader Leonid Brezhnev and then India leader Indira Gandhi.

The majority of production has been for the Russian and Ukrainian Air Forces, with around 40 per year being built during the late 1980s to early 1990s. The estimated price for a modernised An-32 version is 15 million US dollars.

The last An-32 was produced in 2012.

===Production data===
==Operational history==
The An-32 has outstanding takeoff characteristics in hot and high conditions, up to and elevation, and is suitable for use as a medium tactical military transport roles as well as commercial roles. Operating as a cargo transport over the short and medium range air routes, the An-32 is suitable for air-dropping cargo, passenger carrying, medevac, firefighting, skydiving or paratrooping roles.

The An-32 entered service in the 1980s and served with the air forces of Ukraine, Russia, Bangladesh Air Force, the Iraqi Air Force, the Mexican Air Force and the Sudanese Air Force.

==Variants==

* An-32 : Twin-engined transport aircraft
* An-32A : The first civil variant, the majority of the 36 aircraft built were delivered to various government factory enterprises, for use in transporting assemblies between plants.
* An-32B : Improved version
* An-32B-100 : Modernised version of the An-32B. Maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) increased to 28.5 tons, payload increased to 7.5 tons.
* An-32B-110 : New avionics allowing aircraft to be operated by two crew members. Metric (Russian) avionics variant.
* An-32B-120 : Imperial (non-Russian) avionics variant of An-32B-110.
* An-32B-300 : Version fitted with Rolls-Royce AE 2100 turboprop engines, providing 4,600 hp each.
* An-32LL (&quot;Letayushchaya Laboratoriya&quot; flying laboratory): The An-32 first prototype was equipped with a large SV-36P eight-bladed propeller and D-236 engine on the port side for testing, in place of the standard engine and propeller. The increased noise produced by the experimental installation (115-120 dB) outweighed the modest gains in performance.
* An-32MP : Marine Patrol version.
* An-32P Firekiller : Aerial firefighting version. Special category type certificate granted on 10 March 1995. A total of eight tons of liquid can be discharged from the two external tanks simultaneously or one after the other. Drops are conducted at 40–50 m above ground level and 240 to 260 km/h. Can be used as a cargo aircraft when not fighting fires.
* An-32V-200 : A tactical transport/cargo aircraft outgrowth from the An-32B-100, with more modern avionics allowing two crew operation. Intended for export; despite reasonable interest few have been sold.
* An-32 RE : Modernised version of the An-32B. MTOW increased to 28.5 tons, payload increased to 7.5 tons. New avionics.

<doc id="908215" wikidata="Q607658" url="?curid=908215" title="Antonov An-38">
<text>The Antonov An-38 is a stretched and upgraded version of Antonov&#x27;s earlier An-28. It is a twin-engined turboprop transport aircraft, designed by the Antonov Design Bureau in Kyiv, Ukraine. Production is in Novosibirsk, Russia, but some crucial parts are also made in Ukraine and Belarus. It first flew in 1994, and received international flight certification in April 2000. A total of 11 were built and 2 remain in airline service as of August 2019. A recent documentary says that only one remains in service with ALROSA Airlines in 2021.

==Development==
Impetus for a stretch of the Antonov An-28 design began with a 1989 sales tour in India, where it became clear that a significant market existed for an aircraft similar to the An-28, but with seating in the 25–30 seat range. The design was approved a year later, and was displayed at the 1991 Paris Air Show as a model.

The An-38 is of a similar design to the older An-28, featuring the same wings and tail; but it has a longer fuselage and includes several enhancements, such as higher fuel efficiency, increased comfort (cabin and cockpit), and decreased internal noise, coupled with better sound insulation. Other improvements include an increase in passengers to 27, thanks to an increase in maximum payload to 2,500 kg (5,500 lbs), as well as a maximum speed of 405 km/h (250 mph). Its design also enables it to operate in adverse conditions—it is equipped with weather radar, sophisticated navigational systems, and low pressure tires that allow it to operate from primitive, unpaved and icy airfields. Furthermore, the aircraft is more resistant to stalling at high angles of attack and is stable and maneuverable with ice on the wing and tail assembly.

==Civil operators==
As of August 2019, 2 Antonov An-38 aircraft remain in airline service with ALROSA. Recent reviews suggest only one remains in service in 2021.

<doc id="908217" wikidata="Q2045507" url="?curid=908217" title="Offensive coordinator">
<text>An offensive coordinator (OC) is a coach responsible for a gridiron football team&#x27;s offense. Generally, the offensive coordinator, defensive coordinator and special teams coordinator represent the second level of coaching structure, with the head coach being the first level.

The primary role of the offensive coordinator is managing the roster of offensive players, overseeing the assistant coaches, developing the offensive game plan, and calling plays for the offense during the game (though some offensive-minded head coaches may hold play-calling duties instead). Several position coaches work under the offensive coordinator, including quarterback, wide receiver, offensive line, running back, and tight end coaches.

While the job of a offensive coordinator is largely similar at the collegiate and professional level, college coaches are more involved in the recruitment process. A successful offensive coordinator is often a stepping stone to the position of head coach. From 2009 to 2019, nearly 40% of head coaches hired in the NFL had previously been offensive coordinators.

<doc id="908224" wikidata="Q607705" url="?curid=908224" title="Antonov An-70">
<text>The Antonov An-70 (-70) is a four-engine medium-range transport aircraft, and the first aircraft to take flight powered only by propfan engines. It was developed in the late 1980s by the Antonov Design Bureau to replace the obsolete An-12 military transport aircraft. The maiden flight of the first prototype took place in December 1994 in Kyiv, now independent Ukraine. Within months the prototype had suffered a mid-air collision. A second airframe was produced to allow the flight-test programme to proceed. Both prototypes were produced by the Kyiv Aircraft Production Plant.

Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, the programme became a joint development between Russia and Ukraine. The former compounded the issue of a reduced market with its intermittent commitment to the project. Repeated attempts to start production have had limited success. Western European countries, including Germany, at one stage assessed the aircraft for procurement, but many later decided against it.

==Development==
===Origins and early testing history===
The origins of the An-70 can be traced back to the mid-1970s, when Antonov Design Bureau began preliminary design work on a successor for the An-12 four-engine turboprop aircraft. The Soviet Armed Forces, by the 1980s, were looking for a replacement for the An-12 and a complement to the Ilyushin Il-76 four-engine jet transporter; in 1987, the Ministry of Defence, with a new emphasis on air mobility, specified an aircraft with a quick loading time, the ability to operate from short unprepared airfields, could carry up to 300 troops, and have good operating economy. The initial contract for work on the An-70 was concluded in May 1989; Antonov began advanced design work on the new aircraft during the same year. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, in June 1993, the Russian and Ukrainian governments agreed to jointly develop the An-70, with 80 percent of the funding expected to come from Russia. The following year, twenty companies and organisations from the former Soviet Union agreed to jointly develop, market and support the aircraft.

There were plans to establish mass (&quot;serial&quot;) production of the model at the Kyiv Aircraft Production Plant (later renamed as Antonov Serial Production Plant), which was associated with but separate from the Antonov Design Bureau, and at the Samara Aircraft Production Plant (later reorganised as Aviakor) in Samara, Russia. At one stage during early development, Russia was showing reluctance at supporting the development of the An-70, and so Uzbekistan sought, unsuccessfully, to establish a final assembly plant in the capital at the Tashkent Aircraft Production Plant, where the production of the An-70&#x27;s wings and the Il-76 were taking place. Construction of the first prototype had started in Kyiv in 1991. The maiden flight of the aircraft had originally been scheduled for late 1992. However, due to financing and design issues, this was pushed back until 1994. In particular, the weakened national currency diminished the firm&#x27;s ability to pay for the aircraft&#x27;s components, especially those sourced from Russia, and workers&#x27; salaries. In addition, engineers discovered numerous design and manufacturing deficiencies during the final ground checks, the majority of which were non-critical yet necessitated lengthy corrections. In the end, the aircraft made its maiden flight on 16 December 1994.

Crewed by a seven-man team, the first aircraft performed a short take off from Svyatoshino Airfield, Kyiv. This was the first flight of an aircraft that was powered only by propfans. Due to worsening weather conditions over Antonov&#x27;s headquarters and the flight test area in Kyiv, the flight was cut short, and the flight ceiling was capped at 2,000 m (6,500 ft). The crew took the aircraft to a height of 450 m (1,475 ft), while performing basic checkouts of the prototype&#x27;s systems. After having been airborne for less than half an hour, the aircraft landed at Antonov&#x27;s flight test facility at Hostomel. During the flight, engineers identified problems with the engine gearboxes, and so the aircraft was grounded for eight weeks while the issues were fixed.

Originally, the aircraft was to conduct flight tests at Hostomel for three months before transferring to the Gromov Flight Research Institute in Zhukovsky, near Moscow. However, the first prototype was lost when it was making its fourth flight on 10 February 1995. During the flight, the aircraft suffered a sudden deviation from its intended flightpath and collided with the An-72 chase plane before spiralling into the ground, erupting into flames; the test crew of seven were killed. Although there were initial allegations of technical issues with the aircraft, it was later determined that the crash had been caused by human error.

Antonov subsequently converted the static-test prototype into a flying prototype equipped with a modified flight-control system. The second airframe was rolled out in December 1996 in Kyiv, before making its first flight on 24 April 1997 from Svyatoshino Airfield, during which the aircraft was airborne for 31 minutes; according to Jane&#x27;s, however, the aircraft had taken off from Hostomel for a 26-minute flight. The second prototype&#x27;s initial flight nearly ended in disaster, as the flight-control system repeatedly malfunctioned. Test pilot Oleksandr Halunenko was forced to manually land the prototype, for which he was honored with the Hero of Ukraine title. By this time, more than US$2.5 billion had been spent on the programme, with a further $200 million to be spent to prepare the aircraft for production, which was expected to have started in 1999 with 20–25 aircraft produced annually. The Russian and Ukrainian Air Forces reportedly had long-term plans to procure 500 and 100 aircraft, respectively. The second airframe was severely damaged during cold weather testing on 27 January 2001 in a crash landing after take-off.

===Western evaluation===
In the early 1990s, the An-70 was unsuccessfully considered as a platform to meet the European Staff Requirement (ESR) for the Future Large Aircraft (FLA) programme; the programme envisaged the development of a transport aircraft that is midway in size and capability between the Lockheed Martin C-130J and the McDonnell Douglas C-17 to replace the C-130 Hercules. In October 1997, however, the German Defence Minister Volker Rühe announced his intention to study whether the An-70 could be the basis for the FLA. The decision arose out of the German government&#x27;s objective of providing industrial aid to and thus enhancing political ties with Eastern Europe. In December 1997, France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine agreed to evaluate the An-70 as a candidate for the FLA programme.

Antonov proposed a &quot;westernised&quot; version of the An-70, the An-7X. The German government tasked DaimlerChrysler Aerospace (DASA) with the responsibility of evaluating the An-70 and assessing whether it would fulfill the ESR for a common tactical airlifter. Airbus provided data of the aircraft to DASA, who confirmed the data with its own wind-tunnel tests. According to the DASA study from 1999, the An-70 fulfilled the ESR, and that westernisation is possible, but work in key areas would have been necessary and risks existed. Areas identified include the introduction of full authority digital engine control, a completely new cockpit, a new flight-control system computer, the addition of in-flight refuelling capability, as well as modifications to allow paratroopers to be dropped from the rear cargo door. DASA recommended a change in the manufacturing method of the carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer components. Also the fuselage manufacturing-method was considered uneconomical. German, Ukrainian and Russian companies had formed the joint-venture &quot;AirTruck&quot; to plan and manage the modifications needed to westernise the An-70.

The German government, for political reasons, preferred the An-70. During a separate German Ministry of Defence evaluation of the An-7X, the aircraft was apparently considered to be superior to the A400M designed by the military branch of Airbus. According to AirTruck, the Defence Ministry estimated the An-7X to be 30 percent cheaper than its rival, would provide industrial benefits as Germany would receive substantial workshare, and was deemed to be technically superior, due mainly to its new propfan technology; however, a Defence Ministry spokesperson denied that a conclusion had been reached. On the other hand, DASA preferred the A400M, and refused to be the prime contractor for the An-70 if it was to be chosen. In the meantime, Belgium, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey and the UK, were tentative members of the FLA programme and were estimated to have a requirement for up to 288 aircraft; Russia and Ukraine themselves were looking to acquire 210 An-70s. Other contenders for the FLA were the C-17 and C-130J. In April 2000, the German government, the strongest supporter of the An-70, stated that it was committed to buying the same aircraft as the other countries. In the end, the A400M was chosen for the FLA project; had the An-70 been chosen, fifty percent of the aircraft would have been manufactured by Airbus.

===2001 incident and later disputes===
In December 1999, the Russian government outlined that it planned to purchase 164 aircraft by 2018. The Ukrainian government in October 2000 estimated that the country had a requirement for 65 aircraft. By then, the Russian government had awarded the Polyot plant, which was based in Omsk, the right to produce the aircraft, ahead of Aviakor and Aviastar of Samara and Ulyanovsk, respectively. The Kyiv Aircraft Production Plant was expected to produce the first aircraft in 2003, and Polyot, in 2004. As the An-70 flight test programme had reached its final stages by the end of 2000, it was expected that the Russian and Ukraine Defence Ministries would approve of mass production at the start of 2001. On 27 January 2001, however, the second An-70 prototype made a crash landing on its belly after losing power in two engines on take-off during cold weather testing in Omsk, and was severely damaged. Four of the 33 people on board were injured. Antonov recovered the crashed aircraft and repaired it, but the project still lacked funding.
In January 2002, preparations started on mass production as the Russian government affirmed that the aircraft was in the country&#x27;s nine-year military budget; by now, Ukraine had already placed an order for five aircraft. Despite the affirmation that the country was committed to the project, there were other indications that Russia had lost considerable interest in the An-70. In February 2002, for example, the Defence Ministry did not contribute towards the An-70&#x27;s development costs for the period, and at the same time military experts were withdrawn from the test programme. The following year, senior Russian Air Force officials publicly discredited the project; Commander-in-chief of the Russian Air Force, General Vladimir Mikhaylov, labelled it as undeveloped, and the aircraft as &quot;dangerous,&quot; too heavy and too expensive. Indeed, there were rumours that Russia would soon abandon the project; however, in May 2003, Russian President Vladimir Putin reassured his Ukrainian counterpart that Russia was committed to the project.

Nevertheless, Antonov looked elsewhere for an industrial partner. In September that year, the company signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with China Aviation Industry Corporation II that covered the possible joint development of transport aircraft. Russian ambivalence towards the An-70 was made evident when the Russian Defence Ministry did not allocate any funds in the near future towards the procurement of the aircraft for its air force. Instead, resources were dedicated towards the upgraded Il-76MF. After the Orange Revolution in late 2004, and with Ukraine openly aiming for NATO membership, political will for the project evaporated. In April 2006, General Mikhaylov announced that Russia was withdrawing from the project, although at the time there was no official confirmation from the Russian government itself. Mikhaylov had reportedly been a staunch opponent of the An-70, claiming that the D-27 engine was &quot;unreliable&quot;, and had advocated for the adoption of the Il-76MF, which was estimated to cost half that of the An-70. Up until then, Russia had provided around 60 percent of the estimated $5 billion invested in the project.

===Subsequent development===
Intermittent commitment from the Russian side plagued the project, as Russia owed the programme an outstanding debt for the three years through 2009. According to various reports, Russia&#x27;s conflict with Georgia in August 2008 highlighted the need for an airlifter in the class of the An-70, one that had a spacious cargo bay and the ability to operate from unpaved airstrips. Consequently, in August 2009, both countries agreed to resume development of the An-70. Ukraine continued to pursue flight testing of the sole prototype while making upgrades to the aircraft&#x27;s avionics, sensors and propulsion system. It was reported that the Ukrainian Air Force would take delivery of its first two An-70s in 2011 and 2012; Volga-Dnepr Airlines had also signed an MoU with Antonov for five commercial-standard An-70Ts. A requirement for 60 An-70s was included in Russia&#x27;s 2011–2020 national armament programme when it was issued in December 2010.

In late July 2010, Antonov suspended the flight test programme to update the aircraft. After an extensive series of modifications, including revised avionics (which reduced the flight crew from five to four) and changes to the aircraft&#x27;s propellers to improve reliability and decrease noise, the second prototype An-70 flew again on 27 September 2012 and took part in the Aviasvit XXI airshow in Kyiv. During the same year, Russian and Ukrainian authorities agreed on the basic workshare of the production programme. Antonov in Kyiv would now produce the wings, tail surfaces and engine nacelles. The KAPO factory in Kazan, Russia, would be responsible for the manufacture of the fuselage, the final assembly of the aircraft, and flight testing. Other major components would come from Novosibirsk, Ulyanovsk and Voronezh; construction of the fuselage of the first production aircraft was reportedly complete in December 2012.

The test programme would last from September 2012 until April 2014, when the aircraft passed state acceptance trials. During that time, the An-70 conducted approximately 120 flights totalling 220 hours, with much of the certification effort carried out by Ukrainian specialists and officials. This is because, despite the aircraft&#x27;s inclusion in Russia&#x27;s state rearmament programme, Russia had withdrawn from the project in November 2012 reportedly due to slow progress, a fact that was disclosed only in April 2013. According to a report, the withdrawal of Russia from the project was, apart from a response to the Ukrainian government&#x27;s EU choices, the result of political manoeuvring by Russian government officials with links to Ilyushin to pressure the government to purchase the Il-476, a re-winged variant of the Il-76. In total, the An-70 had conducted some 735 flights and had accumulated 930 hours during state tests.

As a result of the Russian invasion of Crimea, the Ukrainian government, in April 2014, announced that it would halt all military-technical cooperation with Russia. In August 2014, a Ukrainian court ordered the Russian Defence Ministry to make outstanding payments to Antonov. In March 2015, Russia Defence Ministry declared that it is ruling out the An-70 for state procurement. It also declared that, as in their opinion, Ukraine has withdrawn from the military and defence agreements signed before the crisis between them by completing the aircraft without Russian involvement, it would request return of 2.95 billion rubles that Russian government had spent on An-70 project.

==Design==
The An-70 is a monoplane with a high-mounted wing design that features four distinctive propfan engines. Designed by the Progress Design Bureau, each of the D-27 engines is rated at 13,800 shp (which can be uprated to 16,000 shp), which is used to drive the SV-27 contra-rotating scimitar propellers designed by Aerosila; eight on the front propeller and six on the aft propeller. The propfan engines deliver slipstream to the supercritical wings that feature double-slotted trailing edges to provide high lift coefficients at low speeds. The modernisation of the aircraft during 2010–12 saw upgrades to the engines, including the incorporation of FADEC, and the further separation of the two propellers. The aircraft&#x27;s cruise speed is 750 km/h (405 kt) at an operational altitude of ; Antonov claimed in 1997 that the aircraft had a design maximum speed of 850 km/h (460 kt, or Mach 0.8), which would have compared favourably with Mach 0.77 of the larger turbofan-powered C-17. According to DASA&#x27;s evaluation, the propfan engines were 10 percent more efficient than conventional turboprops.

Similar to many aircraft designs of the Soviet Union, the An-70 was designed as an airlifter that could operate from unprepared fields. In short take-off and landing (STOL) configuration, the aircraft could lift off from a dirt strip with of cargo and fly for . Alternatively, it could fly the same distance with of cargo if it took off from a paved runway. For a payload-heavy mission, the An-70 can haul of cargo for a range of , but if range was essential, the aircraft can carry a load of over . In exceptional circumstances, the An-70 subjected to lower-&quot;g&quot; take-offs, can airlift a T-80U main battle tank and fly it for . The fully pressurised internal cabin measures wide and high, and has a length of from the front to the ramp; with the ramp included, the total cabin length is . In comparison, the turbofan-powered Il-76 has a lower cross-sectional cargo area, but exceeds the An-70 in payload capability and ramp length. The An-70&#x27;s cargo hold is serviced by four electrical hoists that facilitate autonomous cargo loading. A central floor can be rapidly installed for the accommodation of 300 soldiers or 200 injured personnel over two decks.

Similar to the An-124, the An-70 design makes extensive use of titanium and composites to keep weight to a minimum and increase damage resistance. Approximately 25 percent of the airframe is made of carbon-fibre composites, which are primarily used on control surfaces and the tail assembly, while aluminium and steel alloys are used for the rest of the structure. The An-70 has a designed life of 45,000 hours over 15,000 flights. The prototypes had a fly-by-wire flight-control system that comprised three digital channels and six analog channels; it was expected that production aircraft would have a four-channel digital fly-by-wire system. Aircraft and system information are mainly relayed to the pilot and co-pilot via six large multi-function CRT displays, with secondary electro-mechanical instruments and head-up displays; a flight engineer position is also present on the prototypes.

==Variants==

;An-70T: A version of the An-70 &quot;sans suffix&quot; adopted for the civilian market.

;An-70T-100: A proposed lighter version of the An-70T with two D-27 propfans and simplified landing gear for civilian use. The variant was intended to haul of cargo over a distance of , or for .

;An-7X: A proposed version of the An-70 intended for the Western European market.

;An-77: Proposed in July 2017 for joint development between the U.S. and Ukraine, this modernized version of the An-70 would fill the gap between the C-130 and the C-17. It could also replace the An-12 and Il-76 military transporters. At the Eurasia Airshow in April 2018, Antonov announced that it would work with Turkey&#x27;s Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) in redeveloping the An-77 aircraft to meet current-day requirements.

;An-112KC: A proposed aerial refueling version of the An-70, except with two jet engines from the team of U.S. Aerospace and Antonov for the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s KC-X program. The USAF rejected the proposal, and the appeal was later dismissed.
;An-170: A heavy-lift version with a stretched fuselage and greater wing span. The aircraft would be powered by the Progress D-227, a more powerful derivative of the Progress D-27 producing of output.
;An-171: Proposed maritime patrol version of An-170.
;An-188: A program to develop this variant was launched at the 2015 Paris Air Show. This variant will essentially be a four jet engine powered heavy-medium transport with modernized NATO- compatible western cockpit, slightly enlarged wings, winglets and aerial refueling capabilities. The An-188 is intended to fill the gap between a C-130 and C-17 while being a direct competitor to the A400M. Plans include incorporating a western engine option along with the D-27 to appeal to western markets and reduce dependency on eastern markets. In May 2018, Ukroboronprom announced at the Eurasia-2018 Airshow held in Turkey&#x27;s Antalya, that Ukraine and Turkey had agreed to jointly implement the production of the aircraft.

==Operators==
* Ukrainian Air Force – In 2010, two deliveries were expected in 2011 and 2012. Finally, in January 2015, Ukrainian Defence Minister Stepan Poltorak signed an order for the type, allowing the An-70 to officially enter service with the Ukrainian Air Force, currently the sole operator of the type.

<doc id="908226" wikidata="Q367719" url="?curid=908226" title="Antonov An-140">
<text>The Antonov An-140 is a turboprop regional airliner, designed by the Ukrainian Antonov ASTC bureau as a successor to the Antonov An-24, with extended cargo capacity and the ability to use unprepared airstrips.

==Design and development==
First flown on 17 September 1997, the 52 passenger An-140 is manufactured at the main production line in Kharkiv by KHDABP, in Samara by Aviakor, and assembled under license by Iran Aircraft Manufacturing Industrial Company (HESA) in Iran as the IrAn-140. Assembly in Kazakhstan has also been discussed in tri-partite discussions between the Kazakh government, Ukraine and Russia.

Production in Kharkiv ended in 2005. In total 11 planes were manufactured.

Production in Isfahan ran from 2000 to 2015, made from Ukrainian and Iranian components. Iran has complained that Antonov did not fulfill its obligations on parts deliveries.

An identical-in-appearance airplane with the same name is also manufactured by Aviakor in Samara, Russia. Since Ukraine is no longer cooperating with Russia in aircraft production, the Aviakor version of the An-140 is manufactured entirely with Russian components. The P&amp;W Canada engine option is not offered. In 2016 Aviakor produced its last An-140 and in 2017 delivered it to the customer.

==Variants==
;An-140T (Tactical airlifter): The An-140T is a light military transport aircraft developed on the basis of the An-140-100 turboprop airliner. The An-140T features a rear ramp for loading/unloading of cargo and personnel. The An-140S is the same military transport aircraft equipped with a larger loading/unloading hatch. In 2013 Aviakor announced the first deliveries of the An-140T/S aircraft to the Russian Ministry of Defense were scheduled for 2017 as the replacement for the current fleet of 300 An-24 and An-26 airplanes operated by the Russian Aerospace Forces. However, in 2014, Russian deputy prime minister for military–industrial complex, Dmitry Rogozin, announced that Russia was abandoning the An-140T/S project due to worsening relations with Ukraine and would pursue development of the Ilyushin Il-112.

;An-140TK (convertible cargo-passenger)

;An-140 VIP:Regional aircraft An-140 in VIP-configuration is designed to carry up to 30 passengers in comfort. The passenger compartment of the aircraft can be divided into two or three zones—the exclusive lounge, equipped with four comfortable seats with audio and video, business class and economy class cabin, in which it has 24 standard seats with a standard aisle.

;An-140-100:The AN-140-100 aircraft differs from the basic version with the larger wingspan. Can be built for civilian, military and special purpose: maritime patrol, medical, aerial photography, geological exploration, freight etc.

;HESA IrAn-140: The IrAn-140 is a license-built version of the An-140, assembled by HESA in Shahin Shahr, Iran, from complete knock-down kits supplied by Antonov. , 13 aircraft per year were planned to be constructed. There were plans to produce maritime patrol (IrAn-140MP) and freighter (IrAn-140T) versions. 100 aircraft in total were planned to be built; 20 of them were to be acquired by the Iranian government for border patrol and surveillance.

:On 9 November 2010, during his opening speech of the Kish air show, the Iranian transport minister announced that 14 IrAn-140 aircraft had so far been completed; the first six entered commercial service on 19 February 2011. However, after the Sepahan Airlines Flight 5915 crash, An-140 operations were banned by the CAO of Iran, with all remaining Iranian-registered examples grounded. On 23 August 2014 Brigadier General Hossein Dehqan, Iran&#x27;s Minister of Defence, announced full compliance of IrAn-140 airplanes with ICAO requirements and that the aircraft is certified by Iran&#x27;s Civil Aviation Organisation.

=== HESA Simourgh ===
On 19 May 2022, a transport plane based on An-140/IrAn-140 was unveiled by Iran. The plane is named HESA Simourgh and can carry cargo up to 6 tonnes or troops. According to Iranian officials, this plane is a modified version of the Iranian IrAn-140 plane and its previous problems are solved. There are some changes in the tail, wings and the body of the plane and it also has a cargo ramp.

==Operators==

As of December 2022, 23 An-140 and further 10 HESA IrAn-140 have been built for airline and government service, including prototypes. Of these 33 aircraft, only 9 remain in active service. While 20 further aircraft are stored, four An-140 were lost in accidents.

==Accidents and incidents==
Since its introduction in 2002, the Antonov An-140 has been involved in five accidents and incidents, including four hull-loss accidents, resulting in 111 occupant fatalities. Of the aircraft lost, three were HESA IrAn-140 aircraft built in Iran from knock-down kits supplied by Antonov.
* On 23 December 2002, Aeromist-Kharkiv Flight 2137, an An-140 (UR-14003) carrying many of Ukraine&#x27;s top aviation designers and engineers, crashed into a mountainside as it was preparing to land at Isfahan, Iran, killing all 44 on board. The delegation was to have attended the inauguration ceremonies for the first HESA IrAn-140 airframe. The probable cause was controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) due to incorrect use of the cockpit satellite navigation system.
* On 12 August 2005, a Safiran Airlines HESA IrAn-140 diverted to Arak Airport due to an engine failure. During landing, the aircraft overran the runway and was badly damaged. There were no fatalities. The cause of the engine failure appeared to be technical problems with the fuel control unit. The airframe was eventually repaired in the early 2010s and is to be used by HESA as a test bed for the future versions of the aircraft. After the Arak incident, Safiran Airlines returned its two remaining examples to HESA. 
* On 23 December 2005, Azerbaijan Airlines Flight 217, an An-140-100 (4K-AZ48), crashed into the Caspian Sea at CA 22:40, killing all 23 passengers and crew on board. Investigations discovered that three independent gyroscopes were not providing stabilized heading and attitude information to the crew early in the flight. The airline grounded its remaining An-140 airplanes, and cancelled plans to purchase more of the type from Ukraine.
* On 15 February 2009, an IrAn-140-100 (test registration HESA 90-04) crashed at Shahin Shahr, Isfahan province, Iran, during a training flight, killing the five crew.
* On 10 August 2014, Sepahan Airlines Flight 5915, an IrAn-140-100 (registration EP-GPA), crashed shortly after taking off from Tehran Mehrabad International Airport. The aircraft was on a domestic service to Tabas. According to initial reports, around 40 passengers and 8 crew members were on board the aircraft, which broke up and burst into flames. It was reported that the aircraft suffered an engine failure shortly after take-off. There were 10 survivors. The aircraft was built in 2008 and was fitted with the Klimov TV3-117VMA-SBM1 engines. Survivors reported that the number two engine had stopped during the take off. Following this crash, the Iranian IrAn-140 fleet was grounded, pending outcome of the investigation. On 23 August 2014 Brigadier General Hossein Dehqan, Iran&#x27;s Minister of Defence, announced full compliance of IrAn-140 airplanes (Iranian licensed production of An-140-100) with ICAO requirements and that the aircraft is certified by Iran&#x27;s Civil Aviation Organisation. The announcement was made due to the investigation of IrAn-140 crash in Tehran on 10 August 2014.

<doc id="908242" wikidata="Q716341" url="?curid=908242" title="Korean nationalism">
<text>Korean nationalism can be viewed in two different contexts. One encompasses various movements throughout history to maintain a Korean cultural identity, history, and ethnicity (or &quot;race&quot;). This ethnic nationalism was mainly forged in opposition to foreign incursion and rule. The second context encompasses how Korean nationalism changed after the partition in 1945. Today, the former tends to predominate.

==History==
Historically, Korean nationalism, or its earliest concept can be found as early as Silla, who expressed its unification as a unification of Samhan. Other examples of this would be Goryeo, whose name signifies that it is a direct descendant of Goguryeo, as they took its exact name as its own. The same goes for Joseon, who took its name from Gojoseon.

However, the current concept of Korean nationalism came to be emphasized in order to resist Japanese influence during Japanese Occupation. The central objectives of Korea&#x27;s nationalist movement were the advancement and protection of Korea&#x27;s ancient culture and national identity from foreign influence, and the fostering of the independence movement during Japanese rule. In order to obtain political and cultural autonomy, it first had to promote Korea&#x27;s cultural dependency. For this reason, the nationalist movement demanded the restoration and preservation of Korea&#x27;s traditional culture. The Donghak (Eastern Learning) peasant movement, also known as the Donghak Peasant Revolution, that began in the 1870s, could be seen as an early form of what would become the Korean nationalist resistance movement against foreign influences. It was succeeded by the Righteous Army movement and later a series of Korean resistance movements that led, in part, to the current status of the two Korean nations.

===National resistance movements===
Nationalism in late 19th century Korea was a form of resistance movements, but with significant differences between the north and south. Since the intrusion by foreign powers in the late 19th century, Koreans have had to construct their identity in ways that pitted them against foreigners. They have witnessed and participated in a wide range of nationalist actions over the past century, but all of them have been some form of resistance against foreign influences. During the colonial period, the Korean nationalists carried on the struggle for independence, fighting against Imperial Japan in Korea, China particularly Manchuria and China proper and Far East Russia. They formed &#x27;governments in exile&#x27;, armies, and secret groups to fight the imperial Japanese wherever they are.

===Partition of Korea===
Korea was divided at the 38th parallel between north and south by the Allied powers in 1945 as part of the disarmament of Imperial Japan, and the division persists to this day. The split is perpetuated by rival regimes, opposing ideologies, and global politics; it is further deepened by a differing sense of national identity derived from the unique histories, polities, class systems, and gender roles experienced by Koreans on different sides of the border. As a result, Korean nationalism in the late 20th century has been permeated by the split between North and South. Each regime espouses its own distinctive form of nationalism, different from the opposing side&#x27;s, that nonetheless seeks to encompass the entire Korean Peninsula in its scope.

===Korean reunification===
With regard to Korean nationalism, the reunification of the two Koreas is a highly related issue. Ethnic nationalism that is prevalent in Korean society is likely to play a significant role in the unification process, if it does occur. As Gi-Wook Shin claims, &quot;Ethnic consciousness would not only legitimize the drive for unification but it could also be a common ground, especially in the early stages of the unification process, that is needed to facilitate a smooth integration of the two systems.&quot;

Korean reunification () refers to the hypothetical future reunification of North and South Korea under a single government. South Korea had adopted a sunshine policy towards the North that was based on the hope that one day, the two countries would be re-united in the 1990s. The process towards this was started by the historic June 15th North–South Joint Declaration in August 2000, where the two countries agreed to work towards a peaceful reunification in the future. However, there are a number of hurdles in this process due to the large political and economic differences between the two countries and other state actors such as China, Russia, and the United States. Short-term problems such as a large number of refugees that would migrate from the North into the South and initial economic and political instability would need to be overcome.

==Ethnic nationalism==

Korean ethnic nationalism () or &quot;minjok&quot; nationalism emphasizes descent as a key part of Korean identity. A number of scholars argue that it exists in both North and South Korea. It is centered on the notion of the &quot;minjok&quot; (), a term that had been coined in Imperial Japan (&quot;minzoku&quot;) in the early Meiji period. &quot;Minjok&quot; has a similar meaning to the German &quot;volk&quot;, officially translated as &quot;nation&quot;, &quot;people&quot;, and &quot;ethnic group&quot;, or &quot;race&quot;. A number of scholars have argued that this concept has influenced Korean society and politics, and has influenced Korean reunification sentiment.

=== History ===
In the colonial period, the Imperial Japanese&#x27;s assimilation policy claimed that Koreans and Japanese were of common origin but the former always subordinate. The pure blood theory was used to justify colonialist policies and to replace Korean cultural traditions with Japanese ones in order to supposedly eliminate all distinctions and achieve equality between Koreans and Japanese. As was previously done with the Ainu and Ryukyuans, Japan&#x27;s extensive policy of cultural genocide included changing Korean names into Japanese, exclusive use of Japanese language, school instruction in the Japanese &quot;ethical system&quot;, and Shinto worship. This policy was an attempt of forced assimilation, in which Korean language, culture, and history were suppressed. Around the 1920s, the term &quot;white-clothed people&quot; () developed as an ethnonationalist term for Korean people. The term was a reference to the historic Korean practice of wearing white clothing. It also arose in response to unsuccessful Japanese attempts to end the practice. Shin Chae-ho (1880–1936), the founder of the nationalistic historiography of modern Korea and a Korean independence movement activist, published his influential book of reconstructed history &quot;Chosŏn sanggosa&quot; (&quot;The Early History of Joseon&quot;) from 1924 to 1922. In it, he proclaimed that Koreans are descendants of Dangun, the legendary ancestor of Korean people, who merged with Buyo of Manchuria to form the Goguryeo people. Dangun nationalism () is based around this principle. In the March First Movement, the Korean Declaration of Independence marked the date of declaration as , and the identity of the Korean &quot;minjok&quot; and the subject of independence were set as &#x27;the descendants of Dangun&#x27;.

After the liberation of Korea in the 1940s, despite the split between North and South Korea, neither side disputed the ethnic homogeneity of the Korean nation based on a firm conviction that they are purest descendant of a legendary progenitor and half-god figure called Dangun who founded Gojoseon in 2333 BCE based on the description of the &quot;Tongguk t&#x27;onggam&quot; (1485).

From 1945 until 1950, &quot;minjok&quot; nationalism was a factor in Korean reunification sentiment, especially among political centrists. This has been dubbed &quot;centrist [minjok] nationalism&quot; (). For example, centre-right Kim Kyu-sik formed the National Independence Federation (centered around the &quot;minjok&quot;) and opposed the construction of a South Korean independent government promoted by Syngman Rhee; centre-left Lyuh Woon-hyung also opposed far-left proletarian internationalism and argued that &quot;Korean &quot;minjok&quot;&#x27;&quot; interests were more important. Centrist nationalists tried to prevent the division of the Korean Peninsula through the Left-Right Coalition Movement.

One South Korean scholar argued that ethnic nationalism served as a useful tool for the South Korean government to make its people obedient and easy to govern when the country was embroiled in ideological turmoil, especially during the presidencies of Syngman Rhee and Park Chung Hee, when nationalism was incorporated into anti-communism.

Noted Korea scholar Brian Reynolds Myers argues in his 2010 book &quot;The Cleanest Race: How North Koreans See Themselves and Why It Matters&quot; that the North Korean ideology of a purest race arose from 20th century Japanese fascism. Japanese collaborators are said to have introduced the notion of racial unity in an effort to assert that Japanese and Koreans came from the same racial stock. After Japan relinquished control of Korea, Myers argues, the theory was subsequently adjusted to promote the idea of a pure Korean ethnicity.

=== In South Korea ===
South Korea is a highly homogenous society, but has in recent decades become home to a number of foreign residents (4.9%), whereas North Korea has not experienced this trend. A number of its foreign residents are ethnic Koreans (&quot;Overseas Koreans&quot;) with foreign citizenship. Many residents from China, post-Soviet states, the United States and Japan are who may meet criteria for expedited acquisition of South Korean citizenship. In recent decades, discussions have continued to be held both abroad and in Korea on the topics of race and multi-culturalism.

Emma Campbell from the Australian National University argues that the conceptions of South Korean nationalism are evolving among young people and that a new form is emerging that has globalised cultural characteristics. According to Campbell&#x27;s study, for which she interviewed 150 South Koreans in their twenties, the desire for reunification is declining. However, these who are in favor of a Korean unification state reasons different from ethnic nationalism. The respondents stated that they only wanted unification if it would not disrupt life in the South or if North Korea achieves economic parity with the South. A small number of respondents further mentioned that they support a &quot;unification on the condition that it did not take place in their lifetime.&quot; Campbell argued that her interviews showed that many young South Koreans have no problems to accepting foreigners as part of &quot;uri nara&quot;.

The South Korean nationality law is based on jus sanguinis instead of jus solis, which is a territorial principle that takes into account the place of birth when bestowing nationality. In this context, most South Koreans have stronger attachment to South Koreans residing in foreign countries and foreigners of South Korean descent, than to naturalized South Korean citizens and expatriates residing in South Korea. In 2005, the opposition Grand National Party suggested a revision of the current South Korean nationality law to allow South Korean nationality to be bestowed to people who are born in South Korea regardless of the nationalities of their parents but it was discarded due to unfavorable public opinion against such a measure.

A poll by the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in 2015 found that only 5.4% of South Koreans in their twenties saw North Koreans as people sharing the same bloodline with them. The poll also found that only 11% of South Koreans associated North Korea with Koreans, with most people associating them with words like military, war or nuclear weapons. It also found that most South Koreans expressed deeper feelings of &quot;closeness&quot; with Americans and Chinese than with North Koreans. According to a December 2017 survey released by the Korea Institute for National Unification, 72.1% of South Koreans in their 20s believe reunification is unnecessary. At the same time, Steven Denney from the University of Toronto found that, &quot;Younger South Koreans feel closer to North Korean migrants than, say, foreign workers, but they will feel closer to a native born child of non-Korean ethnicity than a former resident of North Korea.&quot;

==State-aligned nationalism==
Unlike pan-Korean nationalism, state-aligned nationalism (), state nationalism, statism is a nation building based on &#x27;state/country&#x27; () identity; it appears in South Korea as ROC nationalism emphasizing the &quot;Republic of Korea&quot; identity and in North Korea as DPRK nationalism emphasizing the &quot;Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea&quot; identity.

===North Korea===

In North Korea, ethnic nationalism is incorporated as part of the state-sponsored ideology of &quot;Juche&quot;. The &quot;Juche&quot; Idea teaches that &quot;man is the master of everything and decides everything&quot;, 
under a central figure, &quot;Suryong&quot;, or 
&quot;central leader&quot;. &quot;Juche&quot; is a component of North Korea&#x27;s political system. The word literally means &quot;main body&quot; or &quot;subject&quot;; it has also been translated in North Korean sources as &quot;independent stand&quot; and the &quot;spirit of self-reliance&quot;. The idea of Juche places the Korean people above any other ethnicities in that it is superior to others traditionally, historically, and culturally, but that it is useless without the role of the &quot;Suryong&quot; It also argues that the reason why the Korean people is the most superior is that it was led by Kim Jong Il, who stressed the concept of the idea of Korean Ethnic National Superiority(조선민족제일주의朝鮮民族第一主義) in multiple speeches.

The &quot;Juche&quot; Idea gradually emerged as a systematic ideological doctrine in the 1960s. Kim Il Sung outlined the three fundamental principles of &quot;Juche&quot; as being:
#&quot;independence in politics&quot; (자주, 自主, &quot;chaju&quot;).
#&quot;self-sustenance in the economy&quot; (자립, 自立, &quot;charip&quot;).
#&quot;self-defense in national defense&quot; (자위, 自衛, &quot;chawi&quot;)

Brian Myers observed that North Koreans generally believe that their (North Korean) state and the &quot;Korean ethnicity&quot; (, &quot;minjok&quot;) are analogous due to the work of propaganda.

One such nationalistic effect of the propaganda is the North Korean&#x27;s perception on the origins of the North Korean flag. The North Korean government spread nationalistic propaganda that Kim Il Sung himself had created this flag, which most North Koreans believe. However, contrary to how the North Korean government have stated on this matter, Park Il, a Koryo Saram who worked as a translator for the 25th Army of the Soviet Union, recalled that Doobong Kim, the vice chairman of the Interim People&#x27;s Committee, who was summoned by general Lebedv explained the meaning of the taoist symbol in the middle and the four markings on each corner to Lebedv, who dismissed this by responding that &quot;These symbols represent East Asian feudalism&quot;, and that &quot;Today seems to mark the very day that the decision to abolish the Taegukki has been made&quot;. Park also reminisced that after a few months, he had received a call from Moscow where the design for the flag of the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea was explained to him in Russian, which he then translated to Korean. This was also confirmed by Chŏng Sangjin, who was the First Vice Minister of the Ministry of Culture and Propaganda of the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea. 
Furthermore, the Taegukki was used in North Korea until July 10, 1948. In 1948, North Korean civilians and Kim Il Sung were filmed bowing in respect to the Taegukki, to pay respects for the elections.

===South Korea===
South Koreans tend to see the &quot;Korean ethnicity&quot; and their (South Korean) state differently. According to Korea scholar Brian Reynolds Myers, a professor at Dongseo University

Today, state nationalism is advocated by some conservative forces, including the New Right Movement, while left-leaning forces are more inclined to anti-imperialistic ethnic nationalism.

A holiday marking the mythological formation of the &quot;Korean ethnicity&quot;, a concept shared and celebrated in both Koreas (as can be seen with the presence of the Mausoleum of Tangun in North Korea), in 2333 BC can be seen commemorated with a national holiday (National Foundation Day) in South Korea each October.

Myers believes the lack of state-based nationalism manifests itself in diplomacy as well; the lack of a strong, resolute response by South Korea to North Korea&#x27;s attacks against it in 2010 (i.e. the sinking of ROKS &quot;Cheonan&quot; and the bombardment of Yeonpyeong) has been attributed to the former&#x27;s lack of state-aligned nationalistic sentiment, as these attacks were viewed as mere affronts against the state. In contrast, Japanese claims to South Korean-claimed territory are seen as affronts against the Korean ethnicity and are thus responded to with more vigor from South Koreans.

The South Korean flag is often seen by South Koreans as representing the &quot;Korean ethnicity&quot; rather than merely South Korea itself.

The prioritization of ethno nationalism was also reflected in the pre-2011 South Korean military oath and pre-2007 pledge of allegiance, both of which pledged allegiance to the &quot;Korean ethnicity&quot;.

Examples of ethno nationalism can be seen in Korean history, such as the anti-Japanese resistance independence movement in Japanese colonial era and the anti-American/anti-dictatorship democracy movement in the 1980s.
However, an example of state nationalism can also be seen in South Korea, such as Park Chung Hee&#x27;s authoritarian politics, which was similar to the Japanese Shōwa statism

==Discrimination==
In 2007, the U.N. Committee on the International Convention Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination urged better education on the pure blood theory, especially for judicial workers such as police officers, lawyers, prosecutors and judges. In 2007, the South Korean government passed the &quot;Act on Treatment of Foreigners&quot;. Later in 2007, the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination praised the Act on Treatment of Foreigners, but also expressed a number of concerns. The committee was concerned &quot;about the persistence of widespread societal discrimination against foreigners, including migrant workers and children born from inter-ethnic unions, in all areas of life, including employment, marriage, housing, education and interpersonal relationships.&quot; It also argued that the terminology such as &quot;pure blood&quot; and &quot;mixed blood&quot; were prevalent in South Korea.

Existing provisions in South Korean criminal law may be used to punish acts of racial discrimination, but were never used for that purpose until 2009, when the first case of a South Korean citizen verbally insulting a foreigner was brought to court. Another legislation aimed at improving the integration of ethnic minorities into South Korean society, the &quot;Support for Multicultural Families Act&quot; was passed in 2008 but revised in 2011. According to 2009, statistics published by South Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare, there were 144,385 couples of international marriage in South Korea as of May 2008. 88.4% of immigrants were female, and 61.9% were from China. Recently it has been argued that South Korean society had already become a multicultural society, although foreigners make up for 3.4% of the South Korean population. As of 2011, ten ministries and agencies of South Korean government are supporting international couples and foreign workers in the country.

A poll from 2015 found that Koreans tend to amalgamate Korean ethnic nationalism with classism, resulting in a &quot;hierarchy&quot;, viewing immigrants from more affluent countries less negatively than those who came from poorer countries.

==Geopolitics==
===Impact of ethnic nationalism on South and North Korean relations===
Scholar B. R. Myers argued in a 2010 &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial that there was relatively little public outrage in South Korea over the sinking of the ROKS &quot;Cheonan&quot; earlier that year, which he attributed partly to a feeling of sympathy towards North Korea among South Koreans, resulting from a closer identification with the Korean race than with the South Korean state. Myers also argued that racialized nationalism in South Korea undermines the South Korean citizenry&#x27;s patriotism towards South Korea by increasing sympathy towards North Korea, thus threatening the country&#x27;s national security in the face of North Korean aggression, a sentiment shared by &quot;Korea Times&quot; columnist Jon Huer. He stated that South Koreans&#x27; racialized nationalism &quot;is no problem when you have a nation state like Japan or Denmark, but is a problem when you have a state divided&quot;. Myers has also stated that conversely, North Korea does not suffer from this dilemma as by and large the North Korean people tend to equate the &quot;Korean ethnicity&quot; and the country of North Korea as being one and the same, unlike in South Korea where the &quot;Korean ethnicity&quot; and South Korea are largely seen as different entities.

===Anti-Japanese sentiment===
Contemporary Korean nationalism, at least in South Korea, often incorporates anti-Japanese sentiment as a core component of its ideology, even being described by some scholars as constituting an integral part of South Korea&#x27;s civil religion.

The legacy of the colonial period of Korean history continues to fuel recriminations and demands for restitution in both Koreas. North and South Korea have both lodged severe protests against visits by Japanese officials to the Yasukuni Shrine, which is seen as glorifying the Class A war criminals whose remains are held there. South Koreans claim that a number of Korean women who worked near Japanese military bases as comfort women were forced to serve as sex slaves against their will for Japanese soldiers during World War II which had been a persistent thorn in the side of Japan-South Korea relations from the 1990s to the 2010s. Disagreements over demands for reparations and a formal apology still remain unresolved despite the previous agreement and compensation in 1965, South Koreans started peaceful vigils in 1992 held by survivors on a weekly basis. Recent Japanese history textbook controversies have emerged as a result of what some see as an attempt at historical negationism with the aim of whitewashing or ignoring Japan&#x27;s war crimes during World War II. These issues continue to separate the two countries diplomatically, and provide fuel for nationalism in both Koreas as well as anti-Japanese sentiment.

According to Robert E. Kelly, a professor at Pusan National University, anti-Japanese sentiment in South Korea stems not just from Japanese atrocities during the occupation period, but also from the Korean Peninsula&#x27;s division. As a result, Kelly says, South Koreans take out their anger, whether rising from Korean division or otherwise, against Japan, as due to the racialized nature of Korean nationalism it is considered gauche for South Koreans to be overly hostile towards North Korea. This view is supported by another professor, Brian Reynolds Myers of Dongseo University. Theoretical explanation for the link between Korean division and persistent anti-Japanese sentiment has been offered in scholarship utilizing an ontological security framework.

====Liancourt Rocks dispute====
The Liancourt Rocks dispute has been ongoing since the end of World War II after the United States rejected Korea&#x27;s claim to give sovereignty of the Liancourt Rocks islands, known as Dokdo or Tokto (독도/獨島, literally &quot;solitary island&quot;) in Korean and Takeshima in Japanese, to Korea in the 1951.

Since 1954, the South Koreans have administered the islands but bickering on both sides involving nationalism and lingering historical acrimony has led to the current impasse. Adding to this problem is political pressure from conservative politicians and nationalist groups in both South Korea and Japan to have more assertive territorial policies.

With the introduction of the 1994 UN Law of the Sea Convention, South Korea and Japan began to set their new maritime boundaries, particularly in overlapping terrain in the Sea of Japan (East Sea), where some exclusive economic zone (EEZ) borders was less than apart. Tensions escalated in 1996 when both governments declared a EEZ that encompassed the island, which brought Japan-South Korean relations to an all-time low.

This has not only complicated bilateral relations but heightened nationalist sentiments on both sides. In spite of generational change and the passage of time, the institutionalization of Korean collective memory is causing young Koreans to be as anti-Japanese, if not more so, than the older generation. For Koreans, &quot;historical memory and feelings of &quot;han&quot; (resentment) run deeply and can influence Korea&#x27;s relations with its neighbors, allies, and enemies in ways not easily predicted by models of policy-making predicated on realpolitik or other geo-strategic or economic concerns.&quot;

Due to Korea&#x27;s colonial past, safeguarding the island has become equivalent to safeguarding the nation-state and its national identity. A territory&#x27;s value and importance is not limited to its physical dimensions but also the psychological value it holds as a source of sovereignty and identity. Triggered by perceptions and strong feelings of injustice and humiliation, Korean nationalistic sentiment has become involved in the dispute. The island itself has become to symbolize South Korean national identity and pride, making it an issue even more difficult to resolve. South Korea&#x27;s claim to the island holds emotional content that goes beyond material significance, and giving way on the island issue to Japan would be seen as compromising the sovereignty of the entire peninsula. The dispute has taken on the form of a national grievance rather than a simple territorial dispute.

The South Korean government has also played a role in fanning nationalism in this dispute. President Roh Moo-hyun began a speech on Korea-Japan relations in April 2006 by bluntly stating, &quot;The island is our land&quot; and &quot;for Koreans, the island is a symbol of the complete recovery of sovereignty.&quot; The issue of the island is clearly tied to the protection of the nation-state that was once taken away by Japan. President Roh emphasizes this point again by saying:

Later on in his speech Roh also mentions the Yasukuni Shrine and Japanese history textbook controversy, saying that they will be dealt with together. Having placed the Liancourt Rocks issue &quot;in the context of rectifying the historical record between Korea and Japan&quot; and &quot;the safeguarding of [Korea&#x27;s] sovereignty&quot;, compromise becomes impossible. As the French theorist Ernest Renan said, &quot;Where national memories are concerned, griefs are of more value than triumphs, for they impose duties, and require a common effort.&quot;

The Liancourt Rocks dispute has affected the Korean and Japanese perceptions of each other. According to a 2008 survey by Gallup Korea and the Japan Research Center, 20% of Koreans had friendly feelings towards Japan and 36% of Japanese the same towards Korea. When asked for the reason of their antipathy, most Koreans mentioned the territorial dispute over the island, and the Japanese the anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea. This is in contrast to a 2002 survey (post 2002 FIFA World Cup) conducted by the Chosun Ilbo and Mainichi Shimbun, where 35% of Koreans and 69% of Japanese had friendly views of the other country.

===Anti-U.S. sentiment===
Anti-Americanism in Korea began with the earliest contact between the two nations and continued after the division of Korea. In both North Korea and South Korea, anti-Americanism after the Korean War has focused on the presence and behavior of American military personnel (USFK), aggravated especially by high-profile accidents or crimes by U.S. servicemembers, with various crimes including rape and assault, among others.

The 2002 Yangju highway incident especially ignited Anti-American passions. The ongoing U.S. military presence in South Korea, especially at the Yongsan Garrison (on a base previously used by the Imperial Japanese Army during Colonial Korea) in central Seoul, remains a contentious issue. While protests have arisen over specific incidents, they are often reflective of deeper historical resentments. Robert Hathaway, director of the Wilson Center&#x27;s Asia program, suggests: &quot;the growth of anti-American sentiment in both Japan and South Korea must be seen not simply as a response to American policies and actions, but as reflective of deeper domestic trends and developments within these Asian countries.&quot;

Korean anti-Americanism after the war was fueled by American occupation of USFK troops and support for the authoritarian rule of Park Chung Hee, and what was perceived as an American endorsement of the brutal tactics used in the Gwangju massacre. Speaking to the Wilson Center, Katherine Moon was noted by Hathaway as suggesting that &quot;anti-Americanism also represents the collective venting of accumulated grievances that in many instances have lain hidden for decades&quot;, but that despite the &quot;very public demonstrations of anger toward the United States [...] the majority of Koreans of all age groups supports the continuation of the American alliance.&quot;

===Manchuria and Gando disputes===
Historical Korean claims of Manchuria can be traced back to the late Joseon dynasty. It was common in late Joseon dynasty to write about &quot;old lands of Goguryeo&quot;, an expression of nostalgia for the north. In the early 20th century, Korean nationalist historians like Shin Chaeho, advocated a complete unification of Korean peninsula and Manchuria in order to restore the &quot;ancient lands of Dangun&quot;.

Today, irredentist Korean nationalist historians have claimed that Manchuria (now called Northeast China), in particular Gando (known in China as Jiandao), a region bordering China, North Korea, and Russia, and home to the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture should be part of Korea, based on ancient Gojoseon, Goguryeo and Balhae control of the area. The term Greater Korea, sometimes used in nationalist works, usually encompasses those regions located. The claim for Gando is said to be stronger than the claim for the whole of Manchuria, due to later Balhae presence in Gando after the fall of the Koguryo kingdom, the current area population&#x27;s consisting of 1/3 ethnic Koreans, and the circumstances of the 1909 Gando Convention that relegated the area to Chinese control. While the Manchurian claims have not received official attention in South Korea, claims for Gando were the subject of a bill introduced in 2004, at a time when China had been claiming that Balhae and Koguryo had been &quot;minority states&quot; within China and the resulting controversy was at its height. The legislation proposed by 59 South Korean lawmakers would have declared the Gando Convention signed under Japanese rule to be &quot;null and void&quot;. Later that year, the two countries reached an understanding that their governments would refrain from further involvement in the historical controversy.

<text>Alpha Theta () is a gender-inclusive Greek house at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, United States. It was established as a local fraternity in 1920. It Alpha Theta is a non-profit corporation. 

==History==
=== Early years===
Seven students at Dartmouth College formed a local fraternity named Iota Sigma Upsilon on March 3, 1920. Its founders were:
Loeb was its first president. In 1921, the fraternity received a charter as the &quot;Alpha Theta chapter&quot; of Theta Chi. John Sloan Dickey, later president of the college, joined the fraternity in 1928 and was elected house president only two weeks later, while still a pledge.

===Breaking from Theta Chi===

Alpha Theta was one of the first collegiate fraternities in the United States to break from its national organization over civil rights issues, and the first at the Greek-dominated Dartmouth College. In 1951, while Dickey served as president of the college, the student body passed a resolution calling on all fraternities to eliminate racial discrimination from their constitutions. The Theta Chi national organization&#x27;s constitution contained a clause limiting membership in fraternity to &quot;Caucasians&quot; only. 

On April 24, 1952, the members of the Dartmouth chapter voted unanimously to stop recognizing the racial clause in Theta Chi&#x27;s constitution. Upon learning that the Dartmouth delegation to Theta Chi&#x27;s national convention later that year planned to raise questions about the clause, the Alpha Theta chapter was derecognized by the national organization on July 25, 1952. The house reincorporated as a local fraternity and adopted the name Alpha Theta.

===Coeducation===

Alpha Theta was one of the first all-male fraternities to admit female members. In 1972, Dartmouth admitted the first class of female students and officially became a coeducational institution. Alpha Theta also voted to become coeducational. After a few years, most of the women in the fraternity had become inactive and the house voted to become male-only again on November 10, 1976. The house returned to a coeducational membership policy in 1980.

==Symbols==
The fraternity&#x27;s colors are red and white. Alpha Theta ideals or pillars are Unity, Loyalty, Scholarship, Integrity, and Siblinghood.

==Chapter house==

The current building and property, called Appalachia, is owned by the Alpha Theta House Corporation, a New Hampshire nonprofit corporation.

The original physical plant used by Theta Chi fraternity was built by 1852 and was used as a candy shop by confectioner E. K. Smith. Of Smith&#x27;s confectionery operation, only the building housing his candy factory to the north of Alpha Theta still survives (now the Native Americans at Dartmouth house). Subsequent owners used the candy shop as a dwelling and Theta Chi fraternity eventually bought it from J. V. Hazen in 1921.

After the tragic fire of 1934, membership suffered and it was decided to build a new chapter house. The former house was demolished and the current building was constructed in 1940. The only part of the original building that remains is part of the basement that leads to the back stair and contains the laundry room, called &quot;Appalachia&quot;.

Appalachia gets its name from its proximity to the Appalachian Trail. Hikers from the trail used to be able to stop in the house, an activity which is no longer possible. House tradition still has it that ghosts walk this part of Alpha Theta, and in 2007, a ghost-hunter attempted to gain access to this part of the house. Believing it would be disrespectful to the spirits, Alpha Theta refused access, though they did allow a student to take a look.

In 2008, the Alpha Theta House Corporation did an extensive two-year renovation of the house to improve the safety features of the building and the quality of life for members.

==Notable members==
* John Sloan Dickey – class of 1929, president of Dartmouth College from 1945 to 1970
* Owen Chamberlain – class of 1941, Nobel Prize winners (Physics 1959), participated in the Manhattan Project
* Ira Michael Heyman – class of 1951, chancellor of University of California-Berkeley, 1980–1990
* Mark Mitchell – class of 1956, architect and member of the Vermont House of Representatives from 2006 to 2011
* Cameron Myler – class of 1992, member of four US Olympic luge team, seven-time US national champion and winner of eleven World Cup medals.

==Scandals and misconduct==

=== Coal furnace accident ===

Nine brothers of Alpha Theta chapter of Theta Chi died in a tragic accident on the morning of Sunday, February 25, 1934, when the metal chimney of the building&#x27;s old coal furnace blew out in the night and the residence filled with poisonous carbon monoxide gas.

The bodies were not discovered until the afternoon of the same day, when M. B. Little, a janitor, entered the chapter house and found the students dead in their beds. A pet collie was also found dead in one of the bedrooms. This is still the most fatal accident ever to occur at Dartmouth College.

At the time the chapter had 35–40 members (reports vary), and seventeen of them lived in the chapter house. Eight residents escaped death because they had left campus for the weekend. The deceased were: 
* William F. Fullerton &#x27;34
* Edward F. Moldenke &#x27;34 (president)
* William M. Smith Jr. &#x27;34
* Edward N. Wentworth Jr. &#x27;34
* Americo S. De Masi &#x27;35 (vice president)
* Harold D. Watson &#x27;35
* Wilmot H. Schooley &#x27;35
* John J. Griffin &#x27;36
* Alfred H. Moldenke &#x27;36 (Edward&#x27;s younger brother)

Following the tragedy people asked if the members would move out of the house, but faculty advisor Professor William H. Woods said: &quot;Of course they will move back, we have men with blood in them.&quot; The surviving members met at the Hanover Inn shortly after the disaster. John Trickey Jr. &#x27;33 T&#x27;34, past president of the chapter and a student at the Tuck School of Business, was elected to replace Moldenke. The surviving members moved back into the house after the furnace that caused the accident was replaced. But membership did suffer after 1934, and eventually the chapter house was razed in 1940 and a new building, the current chapter house, opened in 1941.

=== Embezzlement ===

In February 2011, the Alpha Theta House Corporation filed suit against a former treasurer, Bruce McAllister, alleging that he stole hundreds of thousands of dollars from the fraternity. McAllister was also sued by the Meccawe Club, a private fishing club in Vermont, and became the target of a federal investigation later that year. In November 2011 McAllister, a former financial auditor at Dartmouth College, was indicted for wire fraud following an investigation by the United States Secret Service. McAllister was sentenced on November 26, 2012, in United States District Court in Burlington, Vermont, to eighteen months of imprisonment following his guilty plea to wire fraud. U.S. District Judge William K. Sessions III also ordered that McAllister serve three years of supervised release after he completes his prison term and pay slightly more than $800,000 in restitution to Alpha Theta and the Meccawe Club. McAllister was ordered to surrender to the Bureau of Prisons on January 8, 2013, to begin serving his sentence. McAllister&#x27;s sentence was reduced due to a medical condition, which included bladder cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and kidney blockage. The court recommended that McAllister be confined at the Bureau of Prison&#x27;s medical facility in Massachusetts.

<text>AnimEigo is an American entertainment company that licenses and distributes anime, samurai films and Japanese cinema. Founded in 1988 by Robert Woodhead and Roe R. Adams III, the company was one of the first in North America dedicated to licensing anime and helped give anime a noticeable following in the region. Over its history, the company has released many anime titles, such as &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Under Arrest&quot;, &quot;Vampire Princess Miyu&quot;, &quot;Otaku no Video&quot;, the original &quot;Bubblegum Crisis&quot; OVA series, and &quot;Kimagure Orange Road&quot;.

Their name is a portmanteau of &quot;anime&quot; and &quot;eigo&quot; (英語), the Japanese word for the English language.

==History==
The company was founded in 1988 in Ithaca, New York, by Robert Woodhead and Roe R. Adams III. It is now based in Wilmington, North Carolina, and run by Natsumi Ueki, Woodhead&#x27;s wife. Their first release was &quot;Metal Skin Panic Madox 01&quot;. In July 2003, the company signed a deal with Koch Entertainment to help market and distribute their titles in the United States and Canada.

Between 2010 and 2013 the company lost a lot of its titles. For example, in February 2010, they announced they lost the rights to the &quot;Oh My Goddess!&quot; OVAs. In April 2010, the company announced they were unable to license the remaining episodes of &quot;Yawara!&quot;. They later lost the rights to the episodes they had previously licensed. In February 2011, the company announced they had lost the rights to &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot;, one of their more popular titles. The company also lost the rights to the &quot;You&#x27;re Under Arrest&quot; and &quot;Battle Royal High School&quot; anime series, as well as the &quot;Zatoichi&quot;, &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot;, and &quot;Portrait of Hell&quot; live action movies.

In October 2013, AnimEigo launched their first Kickstarter campaign to crowdfund a new release, specifically to re-release &quot;Bubblegum Crisis&quot; as a limited edition Blu-ray. The Kickstarter was successfully funded in October 2013, and the Blu-ray was subsequently released in December 2014. They also successfully kickstarted re-releases of &quot;Otaku no Video&quot;, &quot;Riding Bean&quot;, &quot;A.D. Police Files&quot;, &quot;Gunsmith Cats&quot;, &quot;Megazone 23&quot;, &quot;Metal Skin Panic MADOX-01&quot;, and &quot;Macross II: Lovers Again&quot;.

In February 2024, MediaOCD, a post-production firm owned by Anime News Network founder Justin Sevakis, acquired AnimEigo&#x27;s video distribution business. Woodhead and Ueki will stay on to assist in the transition and see existing projects to completion. After that, they plan to retire.

==Distribution==
The company streams their titles on Hoopla, RetroCrush, Tubi, and CONtv. Some of their titles were on Hulu and VRV (via VRV Select), but they have been removed.

The company is well known for the quality of its translation and subtitles, and pioneered such techniques as multi-color subtitles, overlapping dialogue, and supertitles that explain important cultural, linguistic and historical tidbits. They also include comprehensive cultural and linguistic liner notes with their releases. Alert viewers will often find subtle references to pop culture and current events hidden in the subtitles when they match what the characters are actually saying. Sometimes the references are blatant; in episode 18 of &quot;Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot;, the dying Roy Fokker not only repeats the famous words of Mr. Spock from &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; – &quot;The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few...&quot; but adds Captain Kirk&#x27;s reply – &quot;or the one&quot;.

They also licensed two &quot;Lupin III&quot; films: &quot;Lupin III: The Fuma Conspiracy&quot; and &quot;Lupin III: Legend of the Gold of Babylon&quot;. Because of legal issues surrounding the Lupin name, which was used by author Monkey Punch without permission from the estate of Maurice Leblanc, the titles were released as &quot;Rupan III&quot;, which is the romaji pronunciation of Lupin. Even after the Lupin name passed into public domain in the 1990s, they continued to distribute the films as &quot;Rupan III&quot;.

==Productions==
Releases are only listed if the subtitling, dubbing, or other (localization) production work was handled by AnimEigo; rather than being licensed or redistributed from prior versions.

<doc id="908257" wikidata="Q611100" url="?curid=908257" title="Da Ali G Show">
<text>Da Ali G Show is an English satirical sketch comedy television series created by and starring English comedian Sacha Baron Cohen. In the series, Baron Cohen plays three unorthodox journalists: faux-streetwise poseur Ali G, Kazakh reporter Borat Sagdiyev, and gay Austrian fashion enthusiast Brüno Gehard. These characters conduct real interviews with unsuspecting people, many of whom are celebrities, high-ranking government officials, and other well-known figures, during which they are asked absurd and ridiculous questions.

The first (2000) series originally aired on Channel 4 in the UK, and the second and third (2003–2004) series on HBO in the United States. The second series was known as Ali G in da USAiii in the UK and Australia. In 2005, HBO stated they had no plans to make an additional series of the show.

Baron Cohen has gone on to make four films featuring each of his three characters from the show: &quot;Ali G Indahouse&quot; (2002), &quot;Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan&quot; (2006), &quot;Brüno&quot; (2009) and &quot;Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan&quot; (2020).

In 2014, FXX reaired the show (including episodes unaired in the United States) under the branding &quot;Ali G: Rezurection&quot;.

==Characters==

===Ali G===

Ali G (Alistair Leslie Graham) is the main character of &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot;. He is the self-proclaimed &quot;voice of da yoof&quot; and the leader of the &quot;West Staines Massiv&quot;. His mannerisms are a mix of stereotypical and often exaggerated British African-Caribbean and hip hop cultures, with some American urban influences thrown in. He interviews unsuspecting guests; in the American version of the show, he tells them he is a British talk show host and wants to discuss the media and politics. He often asks a question, and upon receiving an answer, instantly creates a story of an event relevant to the topic, employing his neighbours and fellow &quot;gangsters&quot; such as Ricky C, Dangerous Dave (who refuses to speak because he is terribly embarrassed about his voice) and Rainbow Jeremy (also known as Jezzy), his girlfriend, whom he refers as &quot;me Julie&quot; (Jamaican slang for girlfriend) or a family member such as his grandmother or his Uncle Jamal (who is apparently secretly gay). The character was later the basis of the film &quot;Ali G Indahouse&quot;.

===Borat Sagdiyev===
Borat Sagdiyev is another character featured frequently on the show, introduced as someone Ali G came across on obscure satellite TV &quot;whilst waiting for the 10-minute free preview on the Fantasy Channel&quot;. He comes from a fictionalized version of Kazakhstan, and travels around the United Kingdom and United States interviewing people and engaging in their activities. Though well-intentioned, Borat often makes his guests feel uncomfortable by introducing them to &quot;Kazakh&quot; customs, or by making misogynistic, anti-Semitic, or other politically incorrect comments based on his unfamiliar culture. The culture he presents is entirely fictional, however. For example, a real-world Roma (&quot;Gypsy&quot;) village in Romania stood in for Borat&#x27;s &quot;typical Kazakh village&quot;, while the character of Borat dislikes Gypsies and claims to have once been a &quot;Gypsy catcher&quot;. Similarly, the foreign language Baron Cohen speaks in this role is Hebrew, but interviewees and the average audience member are led to believe the anti-Semitic Borat is speaking in Kazakh. Borat makes references to his favourite sport called &quot;shurik&quot;, a &quot;Kazakh&quot; custom where dogs are shot and killed in a field. He also makes references to his dead wife, his brother Bilo, and his desire to have &quot;sexy time&quot; with many of his interviewees. There are two films based on the character, &quot;Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan&quot;, released in 2006; and the sequel &quot;Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan&quot;, released in 2020.

===Brüno===
Brüno Gehard is a gay Austrian fashion reporter and is the third character of &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot;. He claims to be the voice of &quot;Austrian gay television&quot;. He often makes others uncomfortable by flaunting his flagrant homosexuality. In one episode, Brüno performs cheers with exaggerated, limp-wristed, stereotypically gay mannerisms, along with University of Alabama cheerleaders, provoking the ire of some Crimson Tide fans during the 2002 Alabama–Mississippi State football game. He nevertheless convinces the students to say that they are gay, in Polish.

Brüno also interviews fashion aficionados and &#x27;party people&#x27; and exposes their extreme views of how unfashionable people should be treated and aims to show the superficiality, hypocrisy and inconsistency of the fashion world. For example, he gets them to say that they think fashion has saved more lives than doctors, that people who have bad fashion should be sent to concentration camps, that Osama bin Laden is cool, and that if house music were around in the 1930s, it would have prevented World War II. Universal Pictures released a film about the character, &quot;Brüno&quot;, in 2009.

==Episodes==

==Controversy==
Baron Cohen&#x27;s methods often caused considerable controversy. Some guests became upset upon learning they had been tricked, and various comments made on the show outraged viewers.

In one episode, Borat went to a bar in Tucson, Arizona, where he sang an antisemitic song called &quot;In My Country There Is Problem&quot; with lyrics including, &quot;Throw the Jew down the well/So my country can be free/You must grab him by his horns/Then we have a big party.&quot; Many patrons of the bar were shown responding gleefully and singing along, though a later investigation by &quot;The Jewish Daily Forward&quot; found that many or all of the audience members were aware that the song was a joke and that Borat was a comedian in disguise. A Jewish audience member shown laughing in the HBO clip said, &quot;You could tell right away it was a wig he was wearing, and a fake mustache. I would say 99% of the people in here saw that, too.&quot; The Anti-Defamation League complained about this segment, to which HBO spokesman Quentin Schaffer replied, &quot;Through his alter egos, [Cohen] delivers an obvious satire that exposes people&#x27;s ignorance and prejudice in much the way &quot;All in the Family&quot; did years ago.&quot; Baron Cohen, who is also Jewish, said in an interview that the show&#x27;s Borat segments are a &quot;dramatic demonstration of how racism feeds on dumb conformity as much as rabid bigotry&quot; rather than a display of racism by Baron Cohen himself.

One upset interviewee was James Broadwater, a Republican candidate for Congress. He was interviewed by Borat, who told him that the interview would be played in Kazakhstan and other foreign countries to teach others about the American political system. Borat&#x27;s questioning led Broadwater to state that Jews would go to Hell if they did not convert to Christianity. This comment upset some Jewish communities and prompted Broadwater to post a letter on his website denouncing &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot;, demanding the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) exert greater control over the &quot;liberal, anti-God media&quot;, and saying, &quot;I have had a logo on my website which says, &#x27;I am a proud friend of Israel.

==&quot;Ali G: Rezurection&quot;==
On 1 November 2013, FXX announced a deal to re-broadcast the show (including episodes unaired in America) under the branding &quot;Ali G: Rezurection&quot;, which started on 26 February 2014. The show featured new, original introductions starring Sacha Baron Cohen as Ali G. The show streamed under the name &quot;Da Ali G Show Remixed&quot; on Australian streaming service Stan.

==Opening sequence==
The show&#x27;s opening sequence, conceived and directed by Garth Jennings, has become well-known. It shows a naked Ali G standing under a spotlight in a black room, with each piece of his clothing flying in one by one (complete with action-packed sound effects) until he is fully dressed.

The intro has been parodied on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and in the 2005 BBC mini-series &quot;Casanova&quot; starring David Tennant.

He was educated at Eton, and joined the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve in 1943 and saw action in World War II, mainly based on destroyers in the Indian Ocean. Upon leaving the navy (with the rank of lieutenant), he studied at Christ Church, Oxford and received an honours degree in history.

With 43,752 residents as of the 2010 United States Census, it is the largest housing cooperative in the world. It is in New York City Council District 12.

Co-op City was formerly marshland before being occupied by an amusement park called Freedomland U.S.A. from 1960 to 1964. Construction began in 1966 and the first residents moved in two years later, though the project was not completed until 1973. The construction of the community was sponsored by the United Housing Foundation and financed with a mortgage loan from New York State Housing Finance Agency.

The community is part of Bronx Community District 10 and its ZIP Code is 10475. Nearby attractions include Pelham Bay Park, Orchard Beach and City Island.

== Description ==

Co-op City&#x27;s 15,372 residential units are composed of 35 high-rise buildings and seven clusters of townhouses, making it the largest residential development in the United States. It sits on , though only 20% of the land was developed, leaving many green spaces. The apartment buildings range from 24 to 33 floors. There are four types of buildings: 10 Triple Core (26 stories high with 500 apartment units per building), 10 chevron (24 stories, 414 units), 15 tower (33 stories, 384 units), and 236 town houses. The townhouses are three stories high and have a separate garden apartment and upper duplex apartment.

This &quot;city within a city&quot; also has eight parking garages, three shopping centers, a educational park, including a high school, two middle schools, and three grade schools. More than 40 offices are rented by doctors, lawyers, and other professionals, and there are 15 houses of worship. Spread throughout the community are six nursery schools and day care centers, four basketball courts, and five baseball diamonds. The adjacent Bay Plaza Shopping Center has a 13-screen multiplex movie theater, department stores, and a supermarket.

The development was built on landfill, and the original marshland still surrounds it. The building foundations extend down to bedrock through 50,000 pilings, but the land surrounding Co-op&#x27;s structures settles and sinks a fraction of an inch each year, creating cracks in sidewalks and entrances to buildings.

==History==

===Previous land use===

In the 1920s the land that would become Co-op City had been set aside, intended for a future municipal airport.

The land north of the Hutchinson River Parkway was a large swampy area known by residents as &quot;the dump&quot;, and most of the land on the north side of the Hutchinson River was flat land used for recreation.

The land to the south of the Hutchinson River (now Section 5 of Co-op City) was swampland. A tidal estuary reached from the Hutchinson River at the New Haven Railroad along a route just north of Hunter and Boller Avenue to pass under the Hutchinson River Parkway. The estuary was the site of boat yards and canoe rental sites during the 1950s.

The northern portion of the site became the home of a 205-acre theme park named Freedomland U.S.A. Freedomland operated from June 19, 1960 until September 1964, when it closed after going bankrupt. A small portion of the former park site at the northeast corner of Bartow and Baychester Avenues in Co-op City remains zoned as a C7 district, reserved &quot;for large open amusement parks&quot;. The zoning district is a holdover from Freedomland&#x27;s operation.

=== Development ===
In February 1965, plans were announced for the residential Co-op City development, the world&#x27;s largest housing cooperative, on the site. The plans for Co-op City were announced in May 1965, with no provisions for an amusement park. Construction on Co-op City began in May 1966. While much of the Freedomland site and some of the surrounding land was infilled, several existing houses were retained along Givans Creek (near Section 5 of Co-op City) because of opposition from residents there. These houses received sewage and other utilities, though these projects were delayed. There was a controversy when Co-op City builders filled the land to grade, because the existing houses were located as much as below grade, and filling for the main development caused storm runoff to flood the existing houses.

Residents began moving in during December 1968, and construction was completed in 1973. The project was sponsored and built by the United Housing Foundation, an organization established in 1951 by Abraham Kazan and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, and was designed by cooperative architect Herman J. Jessor. The name of the complex&#x27;s corporation itself was later changed to RiverBay at Co-op City.

=== Financing ===
The construction of the community was financed with a mortgage loan from New York State Housing Finance Agency (HFA). The complex defaulted on the loan in 1975 and has had ongoing agreements to pay back HFA.

Mismanagement, shoddy construction, and corruption led to the community&#x27;s defaulting on its loan in 1975. The original Kazan board resigned, and the state took over control. Cooperators, faced with a 25-percent increase in their monthly maintenance fees, organized residents to refuse to pay their monthly maintenance fees. New York State threatened to foreclose on the property and evict the residents, which would mean the loss of their equity. However, cooperators stayed united and held out for 13 months (the longest and largest strike of its kind in United States history) before a compromise was finally reached, with mediation from then-Bronx Borough President Robert Abrams and then-New York Secretary of State Mario Cuomo. Cooperators would remit $20 million in back payments of maintenance fees, but they would get to take over management of the complex and set their own fees.

The shares of stock that prospective purchasers bought to enable them to occupy Co-op City apartments became the subject of protracted litigation, culminating in a United States Supreme Court decision &quot;United Housing Foundation, Inc. v. Forman&quot;, 421 U.S. 837 (1975). 57 residents sued because they had been charged for costs that were not described in a 1965 Information Bulletin seeking to attract residents for apartments in Co-op City. The Supreme Court held that federal courts have no jurisdiction of shares of stock that allow the purchaser to live in an apartment in Co-op City because they are not federally-regulated shares of commercial stock.

In 2004, Co-op City was financially unable to continue payments to HFA due to the huge costs of emergency repairs. New York Community Bank helped RiverBay satisfy its $57 million mortgage obligation, except for $95 million in arrears, by refinancing the loan later that same year. This led to the agreement that Co-op City would remain in the Mitchell-Lama Housing Program for at least seven more years as a concession on the arrears and that any rehabilitation that Co-op City took on to improve the original poor construction (which happened under New York State&#x27;s watch) would earn credit toward eliminating the debt. By 2008, RiverBay had submitted enough proof of construction repairs to pay off the balance of arrears to New York State.

===Renovations===

Within the first decade of the 2000s, the aging development began undergoing a complex-wide $240 million renovation, replacing piping and garbage compactors, rehabilitating garages and roofs, upgrading the power plant, making facade and terrace repairs, switching to energy-efficient lighting and water-conserving technologies, replacing all 130,000 windows and 4,000 terrace doors (costing $57.9 million in material and labor) and all 179 elevators. The word &quot;renaissance&quot; is being used to describe this period in Co-op City history. Many of these efforts are also helping in the &quot;greening&quot; of the complex: the power-plant will be less polluting, the buildings will be more efficient and recycling efforts will become more extensive. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) awarded its largest ever grant—$5.2 million—to the community under its NY Energy $mart Assisted Multifamily Program.

In 2003, after a partial collapse in one garage, inspectors found 5 of the 8 garages to be unsafe and ordered them closed for extensive repairs. The other 3 garages were able to remain partially open during repairs. To deal with the parking crisis, New York City allowed angled parking in the community, the large greenways in the complex were paved over to make outdoor parking lots and agreements were made with nearby shopping centers to use their extra parking spaces. All garages were re-opened by January 2008, and work began to restore the greenways that had been paved.

Financial responsibility for these upgrades was the subject of a protracted dispute between RiverBay and the State of New York. Co-op City was developed under New York&#x27;s Mitchell-Lama Program, which subsidizes affordable housing. RiverBay charged that the state should help with the costs because of severe infrastructure failures stemming from the development&#x27;s original shoddy construction, which occurred under the supervision of the state. The state countered that RiverBay was responsible for the costs because of its lack of maintenance over the years. In the end, a compromise had the state supplying money and RiverBay refinancing the mortgage, borrowing $480 million from New York Community Bank in 2004, to cover the rest of the capital costs.

In 2007, the power plant was in the process of upgrading from solely managing the electricity brought in from Con Edison to a 40-megawatt tri-generation facility with the ability to use oil, gas or steam (depending on market conditions) to power turbines to produce its own energy. The final cost of this energy independence could be as much as $90 million, but it is hoped to pay for itself with the savings earned—with conservative estimates at $18 million annually—within several years. Also, whatever excess power generated after satisfying the community&#x27;s needs will be sold back to the electrical grid, adding another source of income for RiverBay.

In September 2007, a report by the New York Inspector General, Kristine Hamann, charged that the Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR), which is responsible for overseeing Mitchell-Lama developments, was negligent in its duties to supervise the contracting, financial reporting, budgeting and the enforcement of regulations in Co-op City (and other M-L participants) during the period of January 2003 to October 2006. The report also chided Marion Scott management for trying to influence the RiverBay Board by financing election candidates and providing jobs and sports tickets to Board members and their family/friends—all violations of DHCR and/or RiverBay regulations. The DHCR was instructed to overhaul its system of oversight to better protect the residents and taxpayer money.

In October 2007, a former board president, Iris Herskowitz Baez, and a former painting contractor, Nickhoulas Vitale, pleaded guilty to involvement in a kickback scheme. While on the RiverBay Board, Baez steered $3.5 million in subsidized painting contracts for needed work in Co-op City apartments, to Vitale&#x27;s company, Stadium Interior Painting, in exchange for $100,000 in taxpayer money. Herskowitz Baez was sentenced to 6 months in jail and 12 months&#x27; probation and given a $10,000 fine in March 2008.

=== 2010s to present ===
During January 2015, an outbreak of Legionnaires&#x27; disease sickened 8 people near Co-op City&#x27;s cooling towers. Twelve people were diagnosed with Legionnaires&#x27; disease between December 2014 and the end of the outbreak in January 2015. Another outbreak of Legionnaires&#x27; disease in 2018 sickened three people, one of whom died.

As a result of the continued presence of the amusement park zoning lot at Bartow and Baychester Avenues, there were no restrictions on the heights of signs on that lot. In late 2017, the site&#x27;s owner began erecting tall LED billboards on the lot, a move opposed by Co-op City residents since one of the billboards faced Co-op City, keeping residents awake at night. The following year, residents proposed changing the lot&#x27;s zoning to a standard commercial use. A tall wind turbine was erected on the lot in December 2019. The turbine toppled later that month, knocking down the billboard, but causing no injuries.

==Management==

RiverBay Corporation is the corporation that operates the community and is led by a 15-member board of directors. As a cooperative development, the tenants run the complex through this elected board. There is no pay for serving on the board. The corporation employs over 1000 people and has 32 administrative and operational departments to serve the development.

The complex has its own Public Safety Department with more than 100 sworn officers. In December 2007, the cable television company Cablevision gave RiverBay permission to use its fiber optic cables in order to install additional surveillance cameras throughout the complex to be viewed at the Public Safety Command Center. In 2008, trained supervisors were granted the power to write summonses for parking and noise violations and Segways were acquired – along with bikes – to help the officers patrol during the warmer months.

Co-op City was managed by Marion Scott Real Estate, Inc. from October 1999 to November 2014. Before then the property was run by in-house general managers. The development is currently managed by Douglas Elliman Property Management.

There are two weekly newspapers serving the community: &quot;Co-op City Times&quot; (the official RiverBay paper) and &quot;City News&quot;.

===Qualifications for resident application===

This is about the same as the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are youth and middle-aged adults: 20% are between the ages of between 0–17, 26% between 25–44, and 27% between 45–64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 9% and 18% respectively.

Because of its large senior citizen block—well over 8,300 residents above the age of sixty as of 2007—it is considered the largest naturally occurring retirement community (NORC) in the nation and its Senior Services Program has extensive outreach to help its aging residents, most of whom moved in as workers and remained after retiring.

Co-op City was home to a large Jewish community during its early years, as well as Italian Americans and Irish Americans; many of them had relocated from other areas of the Bronx, such as the Grand Concourse. With African Americans making up a large minority, the community became known for its ethnic diversity. As early tenants grew older and moved away, the newer residents reflected the current population of the Bronx, with African American and Hispanic residents comprising the majority of residents by 1987. In the 1990s, after the fall of the Soviet Union, the neighborhood received an influx of former Eastern Bloc émigrés, especially from Russia and Albania.

== Policing and crime ==
Community District 10 is patrolled by the 45th Precinct of the NYPD, located at 2877 Barkley Avenue in Throggs Neck.

<text>Chinese rock (; also , lit. &quot;Chinese rock and roll music&quot;) is a wide variety of rock and roll music made by rock bands and solo artists from Mainland China (other regions such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau are considered separate scenes). Rock music as an independent music genre first appeared in China in the 1980s, during the age of New Enlightenment. Typically, Chinese rock is described as an anti-traditional instrument, a music that defies mainstream ideology, commercial establishment, and cultural hegemony. Chinese rock is a fusion of forms integrating Western popular music and traditional Chinese music.

==History==

===The Northwest Wind (1980s)===
Rock music did not take hold in Mainland China until the end of the Cultural Revolution and the onset of the Reform and Opening. Peking All-Stars were a rock band formed in Beijing in 1979, by foreigners then resident in the Chinese capital. While the first rock band in China, they were not Chinese. The following year, Wan Xing, Li Shichao, Ma Xiaoyi, and Wang Xinbo formed their first rock band, Wanli Ma Wang, at Beijing Second Foreign Languages College (now Beijing Foreign Studies University), playing Western classic rock.

Chinese rock had its origins in Northwest Wind style of music, which emerged as a main genre in Mainland China. The new style was triggered by two new songs, &quot;Xintianyou&quot; () and &quot;Nothing To My Name&quot; (), both of which drew heavily on the folk song traditions of northern Shaanxi. They combined this with a western-style fast tempo, strong beat and aggressive bass lines. In contrast to the contemporary mellow cantopop style, Northwest Wind songs were sung loudly and forcefully. It represented the musical branch of the large-scale root-seeking (, &quot;xungen&quot;) cultural movement that also manifested itself in literature and in film. Cui Jian&#x27;s Northwest Wind album &quot;Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll on the New Long March&quot;, which included &quot;Nothing To My Name&quot;, has been called &quot;China&#x27;s first rock album&quot;.

Many Northwest Wind songs were highly idealistic and heavily political, parodying or alluding to the revolutionary songs of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), such as &quot;Nanniwan&quot; and &quot;The Internationale&quot;. It is associated with a non-Communist national music perspective instead of CCP revolutionary fervor. The music reflected disillusionment among Chinese youth, as well as the growing influence of Western concepts such as individuality and self-empowerment. Both the music and lyrics articulated a sense of pride in the independence and power of the northwest&#x27;s peasantry. Songs such as &quot;Sister Go Boldly Forward&quot; () came to represent an earthy, virile masculine (Yang) image of Mainland China, as opposed to the soft (Yin), civilized, polished urban gangtai Hong Kong style.

===Birth of Chinese rock and roll (1984)===
The birthplace of Chinese rock was the city of Beijing. In the nation&#x27;s capital, rock music was highly politicized and open to a wide range of foreign influences. For most of the 1980s, rock music existed on the margins, represented by live performances in small bars and hotels. The music was almost exclusively the domain of university students and &quot;underground&quot; bohemian intelligentsia circles. By the late 1989 and early 1990 Chinese rock partially emerged into mainstream music as a combination of the growing popularity of Northwest Wind and prison song fads.

The first Chinese rock song was arguably the Northwest Wind anthem &quot;Nothing To My Name&quot;, first performed in 1984 by Cui Jian, widely recognized as the father of Chinese rock. The song introduced into post-revolutionary China a whole new ethos that combined individualism, direct and bold expression. It soon came to symbolize the frustration harbored by a disillusioned generation of young intellectuals who had grown cynical about Communism and critical of China&#x27;s the sterility and hypocrisy in traditional and contemporary culture. It also expressed, even for older Chinese, a dissatisfaction with unrealized promises of the CCP.At that time, the media introduced and evaluated Cui Jian in such a voice: &quot;Rock music precisely meets the emotional needs of a generation of young people like him, and rock music has become another form of&quot; social criticism &quot;.&quot;.

In the spring of 1989, &quot;Nothing To My Name&quot; became the &quot;de facto&quot; anthem of the student protestors at Tiananmen Square. Additionally, in May and July of that year, three of China&#x27;s famous rock bands were established: Breathing (&quot;Huxi&quot;, ), Cobra (), and Zang Tianshuo&#x27;s () 1989. Earlier rock music groups include &quot;Infallible&quot; (&quot;Budaoweng&quot; ), formed by Zang Tianshuo and Tang Dynasty (&quot;Tang Chao&quot;, ) lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Ding Wu (), and probably the most famous of all Chinese rock bands: &quot;Black Panther&quot; (&quot;Hei Bao&quot; ), originally fronted by China&#x27;s alternative music pioneer Dou Wei ().

===Prison songs (1988–1989)===
&quot;Prison songs&quot; () became popular in 1988 and early 1989, parallel to the Northwest Wind style. The fad was initiated by Chi Zhiqiang (), who wrote lyrics about his time in jail and set them to folk melodies from northeast China. In contrast to Northwest Wind songs, prison songs were slow, &quot;weepy&quot; and invoked negative role models, often using vulgar language and expressing despair and cynicism. Their non-conformist values are apparent in such songs as &quot;Mother Is Very Muddle-Headed&quot; and &quot;There Is Not a Drop of Oil in the Dish&quot;. The popularity of these songs reflected the fact that many Chinese during the 1980s became tired of official artistic representations and discourse. The patrons of prison songs were the urban youth, and private entrepreneurs, who at that time were mostly from marginal backgrounds.

===Popular Chinese rock (1990–1993)===

After the Tiananmen Square protests, rock became part of general urban youth Chinese culture. At the same time, the central authorities of the CCP immediately adopted a crackdown, banning the performance and dissemination of rock music. Its rise from the margins was celebrated on 17 and 18 February 1990, when Beijing&#x27;s largest ever all-rock concert was held in the Capital Gymnasium, one of the city&#x27;s largest halls. The concert featured six rock bands, among them are Cui Jian&#x27;s ADO and Tang Dynasty. The criterion that the organizers set as qualification to participate was &quot;originality&quot;.

Chinese rock reached a peak of creativity and popularity between 1990 and 1993. In 1991, the glam metal band Black Panther released their self-titled debut album. With glossy production and hard rock melodies backing the sincere voice of lead singer Dou Wei, it featured hit singles such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Break My Heart and &quot;Ashamed&quot;. A year later, the album went on to sell more than 1,000,000 copies nationwide, a standard never before achieved in Chinese rock history. Another band, Tang Dynasty, whose style was comparable to British heavy metal, successfully broke another barrier. Their singles &quot;9/4 (a reference to the song&#x27;s time signature)&quot;, &quot;The Sun&quot;, and &quot;Choice&quot; climbed the charts. Once again, it was not until 1992, that their debut &quot;A Dream Return to Tang Dynasty&quot; sold over 2,000,000 copies throughout Asia, including Japan, Korea, and the Southeast. From there, other previously formed rock bands, such as the first all female band, Cobra, and hard rockers The Face (each established in 1989), achieved greater success than ever. In addition, dozens of newer bands formed during the peak of their success, and rock music was performed on a regular basis. Big name artists and bands were featured in media such as CCTV and MTV, while other lesser known acts made a presence in small-scale, underground rock parties such as band leader Fa Zi who was perhaps the most well-known musician at art colony Yuan Ming Yuan near Bei Da in Beijing before it was closed down. The core participants in rock subculture adopted characteristic nonconformist appearance and behaviour. These included glam rock styles: pretty face, long hair, jeans, silver metal ornaments, black leather coats, as well as emerging grunge styles: flannel shirts, and do it yourself ethics, coupled with a carefree, hippie-style behaviour. The decline of Northwest Wind and simultaneous rise of rock music represented a shift in the attitude of many of China&#x27;s intellectuals. Nostalgia changed into an unequivocally fierce negation, a sense of alienation from China&#x27;s traditional and rural culture.In 1993, the Southern Music Group organized the &quot;Music Commune&quot; in Guangzhou to hold a concert &quot;Remembrance of the Year Like Water&quot;.This is the first time Southern rock music has surfaced on a large scale.In the same year, a large-scale rock concert &quot;Olympics - China Dream&quot; was held at the Capital Gymnasium.

===Rock goes underground, earns newfound respect (1994-1998)===
By 1994, mainstream popularity of Chinese rock slowly began to ebb, due in no small part to strict censorship by the CCP, such as the banning of rock from television and restrictions on performances. Moreover, the decline of rock reflected a decline of public interest in politicised cultural products, thoughts, or behaviors. People became increasingly motivated to engage with the market economy, to make money and improve their living standard. Cross-border cultural exchange facilitated by increased economic openness, and the radical commercialization of the music industry in the mid-1990s led to importing overseas music, particularly from Taiwan and Hong Kong. Cantopop singers such as Andy Lau were sponsored by well-resourced record companies and derived revenues from film-making and advertising, two sources generally rejected by Chinese rock musicians. Moreover, the level of censorship imposed on c-pop was less strict, since gangtai culture is historically separate from mainland culture.

With the tragedy of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain&#x27;s death in 1994, a new underground movement emerged in popular music. That year, former Black Panther frontman Dou Wei released &quot;Dark Dreams&quot;. This album marked a complete departure from his &quot;glam metal&quot; days. Instead, this album emphasized thicker and more jangly guitars. Dou sang in a thin, almost apathetic drone-like voice and began experimenting with gothic and electronic sounds. This innovative direction earned him a whole new kind of reputation, as well as credibility in the alternative culture movement. Another unlikely figure in the scene was the father of Chinese rock himself, Cui Jian. A rare compilation album, titled &quot;Rock Pioneers&quot; was also released. The album showcased raw, rather unorthodox playing styles, as well as a rejection (even sometimes a mockery) of mainstream rock music. With the exception of Dream, the only band on the compilation to achieve mainstream success was Thin Man, who went on to revitalize the popularity of rock back for &quot;the masses.&quot; Self-styled punk He Yong fiercely resisted cantopop imitators on the mainland. His only album, &quot;Garbage Dump&quot;, was embraced by alienated Chinese youth, and earned him an enormous cult following. In 1995, a handful of younger punk bands (Brain Failure, Reflector, A Jerks, and 69) produced an album called &quot;Wuliao Contingent,&quot; (, alternate translation &quot;Battalion of Boredom&quot;) representing the boredom and frustration collectively felt within the urban landscape. Chinese punks resist the mainstream by adhering to their own cultural lifestyle and being willing to challenge state power directly on stage or organizing performances focused on sensitive topics to oppose the Chinese government. At the forefront was Brain Failure, the most successful of these bands, who continue to tour internationally with their ska/punk sound. English is used to both express what Chinese lyrics cannot, and also to crossover to the Western music market. In 1998 Hang on the Box were formed, the first all-girl Chinese punk band. One of the significant turning points for rock was Cui Jian&#x27;s performance with The Rolling Stones in 2003 at the age of 42. It opened the genre to the rest of the world for the first time.

In December 1994, Dou Wei, Zhang Chu, He Yong and Tang Dynasty participated in the concert held at Hung Hom Stadium in Hong Kong. This is an extremely important concert in the history of Chinese rock music, filled with media from all over the world and nearly 10,000 Hong Kong audiences, Hong Kong people were shocked by the music brought by mainland Chinese rock bands.It condensed a thunderous cry and a passionate release. It is the crimson mist in the Hung Hom Coliseum, igniting the unforgettable winter night of December 17, 1994 like flames.To this day, many people still miss the scorching, clean, and unforgettable moment 25 years ago, the youthful, talented, and fearless faces and voices.

In November 1994, the band &quot;43 Baojia Street&quot; was established at the Central Conservatory of Music, with Wang Feng as the lead vocalist.No. 43 Baojia Street is a famous academic band, with many members being highly talented students from the Central Conservatory of Music, each with their own understanding and persistence in music. Back then, they were young and energetic, boasting about themselves and feeling proud. In 1995, he formed &quot;43 Baojia Street&quot; as the soul vocalist.His first album, 43 Bow Street, was released in 1997.In 1998, she released her second album, Storm Comes.In 2000, the band disbanded, and that same year Wang Feng released the album &quot;Flower Fire&quot;.In 2002, she released her album Love is a Bullet for Happiness.In 2004, he released the album &quot;Smiling and Crying&quot;.In 2005, the album &quot;Raging Life&quot; was released.

===Rock Revival (2000–present)===

From 2000 to 2004 post punk and extreme metal entered the underground scene and gained popularity among fans.China made tremendous efforts during a brief and extraordinary period to make its &quot;rock history&quot; possible: this can be attributed to the great prosperity of the local heavy metal industry in the early 2000s, when many new brands such as Areadeath emerged, Mort Production and later Polywater, Stress Hormones et al., along with the integration of foreigners, have brought some research techniques to Chinese rock. In 2004–2005, Beijing&#x27;s Joyside went on their first tour of China. American filmmaker Kevin Fritz followed them to make the film &quot;Wasted Orient.&quot; It was released on DVD in 2007 by Plexifilm. The film is China&#x27;s version of Decline Of Western Civilization (about the LA punk scene). It comically depicts the pitfalls associated with trying to tour a country that has little taste for Chinese rock n&#x27; roll music. In this film the original line-up of Joyside including Bian Yuan, Liu Hao, Fan Bo, Yang Yang, and Xin Shuang shows these colorful characters drowning away in alcohol. The film also includes some of Joyside&#x27;s early music, which brought the band some public recognition. The film &quot;Wasted Orient&quot; is non-political, and avoids making superficial social commentary. While Joyside is not particularly known for the talent, the film presents Chinese rock music in the new millennium in a most authentic, raw, and genuine musical genre..

:Director Kevin Fritz:

Presently, Chinese rock enjoys a new media forum in the popular Chinese television program, the &quot;Pepsi Battle of the Bands&quot; () a weekly live program featuring top 10 Rock bands from all over China who compete for weekly survival. Each Episode features guest Celebrities such as, Cui Jian, Paul Wong, Richie Jen, Wang Feng, Van Fan, Jolin Tsai, Mayday, and Show Lo to name a few. The show is sponsored by Pepsi, and produced by Ato Ato Integrated Media.

===The Beijing Midi Modern School of Music and Music Festival===

Another important step in the development of Chinese rock music had been the Beijing Midi School of Music in Beijing.Rock and roll youth have become a small and permanent fixed group in urban youth culture in China. Despite facing opposition from mainstream culture, Chinese rock has successfully survived and continues to attract loyal audiences today. Although its exposure is not as high as pop music, in the past two decades, it has begun to move away from the margins of society and has made reasonable progress in gaining more and more organized followers. The establishment of Beijing Midi Music Academy in 1993 can be an important milestone. Beijing Midi Music School is the first modern music school in China approved by the Beijing Haidian District Board of Education. Established 1993 by Zhang Fan, it was the first school nationally to offer classes for jazz music and rock music. When the school was established in early 1993, it established a clear purpose of running the school: to spread the theory of modern music of the arts and humanities, and to educate and promote exquisite modern music interpretation techniques. Modern music covers blues, jazz, rock, pop, Latin, country, funk, and various genres of music developed from the beginning of the last century, as well as various styles of music derived from them.Started as a school festival in 1999, the Midi Modern Music Festival advanced to the largest rock music festival nationally with up to 80000 visitors and over 100 bands. Both the school and the festival supported the underground scene across the country and opened the door for over 18 foreign bands in 2006 to perform at the festival and elsewhere in the country. (i.e. Alev, Monokino, Yokohama Music Association, The Wombats, etc.). Every year, dozens of world-renowned bands are invited to perform, and tens of thousands of passionate fans flock from all over the world. More than a hundred well-known media outlets are paying attention to its dynamics and competing to report on related news. Midi, also known as China&#x27;s &quot;Woodstock“.

In addition to the Midi school, the &quot;Painkiller&quot; heavy music magazine started efforts to bring bands such as Edguy, Lacrimosa and Hatesphere to China and organized tours of the country for them. Especially in the metal and gothic genres these tours are considered milestones in China.

===The 2008 Olympics and the Sichuan earthquake===
A major drawback for the music scene in general was the cancellation of several events leading up to the 2008 Olympic Games, as well as the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. The 2008 Midi Modern Music Festival was cancelled and delayed to October 2008, the Soilwork gig had to be cancelled, as the band did not receive their visas and the German Esplanade in Chongqing was stopped by the organizers.

The Sichuan earthquake in general shook the music scene and spawned dozens of &quot;We are together&quot; and &quot;Think of Sichuan&quot; gigs and charity events throughout Beijing and other cities. London Chinese Radio made a Special Earthquake Edition on their New Sounds of China podcast to cover this.

===The Shanghai Scene===
Historically more open to the outside, Shanghai is home to musicians from around the world. The unofficial home of the local jazz scene is JZ club while DJs and Electronic Producers frequently play The Shelter. Underground rock bands converge at Yuyintang. The 2010 World Expo and auxiliary events brought legal limitations to live performances and dried up venues temporarily, even censoring Shanghainese indie rock band Top Floor Circus. But since late 2010, Shanghai has seen a surge in concert goers, bands and live music venues with websites, blogs and independent record labels in English and Chinese dedicated to promoting concerts and artists. With Shanghai being the home of the most creative young talents, high school students also became well-involved in the city&#x27;s rock scene. From 2010 to 2014, BRR Shanghai High School Music Festival held by The BRR Shanghai High School Music League (a coalition of the best high school musicians in Shanghai founded by Xu Qifei) grew increasingly influential and started the trend of high school music festivals in Shanghai.

===Rock in China===
The Rock in China website was founded by Yu Yang. It began in April 2004 as a subsection of &quot;Painkiller&quot; titled &quot;Metal in China&quot; before being migrated to its own domain name in mid-2005. Focused on Chinese rock, it had a bulletin board system, a wiki, album details, and musician biographies. According to G1, it was &quot;among the largest websites dedicated to promoting Chinese rock groups abroad&quot;. &quot;The Insider&#x27;s Guide to Beijing 2005–2006&quot; called it &quot;a hugely informative site&quot;, while &quot;Beijing Review&quot;″s Fu Mao Gou said it was &quot;the most comprehensive Web portal there is on Chinese rock&quot;. The website operated until at least July 2010.

== Significance ==
Chinese rock shows a complete rebellious spirit and fearless courage, whether in terms of lyrics and music creation, performance forms, or the audience&#x27;s love for it. It not only breaks away from the traditional etiquette and morality that has consumed our flesh and thoughts for thousands of years, but also from the hypocrisy and weakness that we have accumulated ourselves.

<text>Marino Torlonia (29 July 1861 – 5 March 1933), 4th Prince of Civitella-Cesi, duke of Poli and Guadagnolo, was an Italian nobleman.

==Biography==
He was born in Poli, Italy, the sixth son of Prince Don Giulio Torlonia, 2nd Duke di Poli e di Guadagnolo, and his wife, Princess Donna Teresa Chigi della Rovere-Albani.

Torlonia&#x27;s paternal grandmother was Princess Donna Anna Sforza-Cesarini, a descendant of Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan and patron of Leonardo da Vinci. Torlonia&#x27;s maternal grandmother was Princess Donna Leopoldina Doria-Pamphili-Landi, the granddaughter of Princess Leopoldina of Savoy, a princess of the royal family of Piedmont and Sardinia, which later became the Royal Family of Italy. The descendant of many popes, Torlonia inherited the administration of the Banca Torlonia, which worked the finances of the Vatican and several other investments. He was one of the richest noblemen in Italy around the beginning of the twentieth century, and introduced the first motor car in Rome.

==Personal life==
On August 15, 1907, Torlonia married Mary Elsie Moore (1889–1941), a Connecticut heiress who was studying in Rome. She was a daughter of the American shipping broker Charles Arthur Moore, a tool manufacturer in Greenwich, Connecticut, and of Mary L. Campbell. Mary Elsie Moore&#x27;s brothers were Eugene Maxwell Moore (who married &quot;Titanic&quot; survivor Margaret Graham) and her niece, Bettine Moore, daughter of another brother, Charles Arthur Moore, Jr. (who was a part of Robert Peary&#x27;s Arctic Expedition in the summer of 1897), married William Taliaferro Close (they are the parents of actress Glenn Close).

<doc id="908277" wikidata="Q7045357" url="?curid=908277" title="Noah Beauchamp">
<text>Noah Beauchamp (February 24, 1785 – December 30, 1842) was a blacksmith and an Indiana pioneer. He served as a lieutenant of the Eleventh Indiana Territorial Regiment. Beauchamp was also the first person to be legally hanged in Parke County, Indiana, after murdering his neighbor, George Mickelberry, over a dispute.

== Early life ==
Noah Beauchamp was born in Maryland to Thomas and Sarah Adams Beauchamp. As an adult Noah was over six feet tall, burly and had a ruddy complexion. He was said to have been quick to anger and as a young man, Beauchamp had a disagreement with his father over the morality of slavery. The younger Beauchamp was very religious, a devout Baptist, and he was vehemently against slavery. His father, who owned slaves, may have disowned Noah, who soon left for Kentucky and then Ohio, where he may have met Elizabeth Adams who became his wife. His first child, Noah Beauchamp Jr., was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on November 29, 1804.

By 1811, Beauchamp had moved with his family to Connersville Township in Fayette County in the Indiana Territory, where he set up a blacksmith shop. On December 14, 1812, Beauchamp purchased a tract of land in Fayette County and lived there until the 1820s, the family moved to Edgar County, Illinois. Noah was appointed a lieutenant of the Eleventh Indiana Territorial Regiment on April 29, 1814. The Eleventh regiment was one of the best organized of the Indiana regiments.

In an era where many whites would not deal with blacks, Noah and his wife Elizabeth sold a tract of land in Floyd Co., on September 11, 1828, to Caesar Findley. The Beauchamps resided in Illinois until the mid-1830s, when he relocated again to Indiana, this time to Vigo County.

== The murder ==
One of the neighboring families, in Sugar Creek Township, that abutted his farm was the Mickelberry family. George Mickelberry and Beauchamp became embroiled in a heated dispute over property boundaries, but the tension between the two families wasn&#x27;t bad enough to prevent Mrs. Mickelberry from hiring Beauchamp&#x27;s daughters to knit. It was after one of these knitting jobs, in July 1840, that a larger dispute took place, this time between the Mickelberry and Beauchamp women. The Mickelberry daughters were spreading the word around town that Beauchamp&#x27;s daughters stole some left over wool from the job. Beauchamp heard the accusations and quickly became very angry over the claims. He decided to confront George Mickelberry about the charges.

Beauchamp began walking over to George Mickelberry&#x27;s house and decided to stop and ask God for guidance. He stopped in a clearing, where meat had been prepared and where a large butcher&#x27;s knife was left on a stump. After Beauchamp prayed, he decided to take the knife with him in case Mickelberry&#x27;s farm hands were around to give him trouble. Instead, only Mickelberry answered the door when Beauchamp knocked. In the doorway, Beauchamp, in anger, began to berate Mickelberry over his daughters&#x27; behavior. One of the daughters was in the living room, and began talking back to Beauchamp. Becoming enraged, Beauchamp threatened the daughter saying, &quot;If you was a man I&#x27;d cut you into laces,&quot; as he brandished the knife. At that point, Mickelberry put his hand on Beauchamp&#x27;s shoulder and reflexively, Beauchamp plunged the knife into Mickelberry&#x27;s chest. His breast bone cracking at the force of the blade, he died almost instantly.

In a panic, Beauchamp immediately ran from the house toward the Wabash River. There he stole a row boat and escaped. When the word got out that Beauchamp had killed George Mickelberry, a large manhunt began, searching all over Vigo County and the surrounding area, but Beauchamp was nowhere to be found. George Mickelberry&#x27;s family grieved for their loss and Mickelberry was buried.

== Aftermath ==
In the meantime, Beauchamp had fled to Texas, where he borrowed money to open a blacksmith shop. He owed large debts and the son of one of the men who loaned him money saw the wanted poster in the local hotel that was brought down to Texas by a traveller in April 1841. Since Beauchamp had not thought to use an assumed name, it wasn&#x27;t long before the lenders son and another man went looking to collect the $500 reward on the fugitive.

Beauchamp was quickly apprehended and the two men set out for a river to ship Beauchamp back to Indiana in custody. Before they made it to the river, Beauchamp broke free and overpowered one of the men. He made a run for it but was soon recaptured. Beauchamp was locked in one of the cabins on the boat as it made its way up river. Unknown to his captors, Beauchamp used the sheets of the bed to fashion a noose and tried to kill himself in the cabin, but was foiled when someone came to check on him.

In Vigo County, before Beauchamp&#x27;s trial began in earnest, his lawyer got a change of venue to Parke County, since the case was so well known. His daughter-in-law&#x27;s parents Sanford and Rhoda Ransdell testified for the defense but to no avail. After a lengthy trial Beauchamp was sentenced to death on September 8, 1842.

The gallows were constructed in Rockville, Indiana. On the morning of December 30, 1842, Beauchamp&#x27;s old friend and minister, Reverend Newport, delivered a sermon outside of Beauchamp&#x27;s jail cell window. Beauchamp had his last meal, said his goodbyes to his family and friends and was taken to the gallows, where a large contingent from Vigo County waited. When he was asked if he had any last words, Beauchamp said, &quot;Goodbye,&quot; and he was hanged.

On November 7, 1825, Beauchamp&#x27;s cousin, Jereboam O. Beauchamp, was also involved in a fatal stabbing, with parallels to Noah Beauchamp&#x27;s case. Jereboam Beachamp fatally stabbed Colonel Solomon P. Sharp in a murder that became known as the Beauchamp–Sharp Tragedy. Jereboam Beauchamp, in an effort to defend the honor of his wife, killed Sharp in his own doorway with a knife. Just like Noah Beauchamp, this Beauchamp fled and a large manhunt took place. He was captured, tried to kill himself, was saved at the last minute, was tried and hanged.

Noah Beauchamp was a direct descendant of John Beauchamp (Plymouth Company), and the Quaker Ambrose Dixon, Dixon was Beauchamp&#x27;s great-great-great-grandfather.

<doc id="908280" wikidata="Q143020" url="?curid=908280" title="Netherlands Antilles at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>The Netherlands Antilles competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004, sending track athletes Churandy Martina and Geronimo Goeloe and equestrian athlete Eddy Stibbe. The 2004 Games were the Netherlands Antilles&#x27; twelfth appearance in the Summer Olympics; they first competed at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland. Before the 2004 games, the Netherlands Antilles had won one medal, a silver in sailing at the 1988 Summer Olympics, by Jan Boersma. There were no Dutch Antillean medalists at the Athens Olympics, although Martina advanced to the quarterfinal round in his event. The Dutch Antillean flagbearer at the ceremonies was Churandy Martina.

==Background==

The Netherlands Antilles were a union of five Caribbean islands–Curaçao, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, Saba and Sint Maarten–that, together, constituted a portion of the Realm of the Netherlands alongside the Netherlands themselves and Aruba, and held approximately 300,000 residents. The political power of the Dutch colonies was centered at Willemstad, the capital of both Curaçao and of the Netherlands Antilles. The first Dutch Antillean delegation to compete was an eleven-man team that arrived at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland. Excluding 1956 and 1980, athletes from the Netherlands Antilles had participated at twelve summer games between 1952 and 2004. It had additionally competed at the Winter Olympics of 1988 and 1992. The first female Dutch Antillean Olympians competed at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, and had only appeared sporadically between then and 2004 with the exception of in 1984, when female athletes comprised the majority of the Dutch Antillean delegation. The Netherlands Antilles experienced its greatest diversity of athletes at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, when athletes participated in six different sports.

There had been a single medalist from the Netherlands Antilles–Jan Boersma, a sailor, won the silver medal in his event at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. Up to and including the Athens games, there have been no other medalists from the Dutch colonies. Three male athletes comprised the Dutch Antillean delegation at the Athens Olympics–Geronimo Goeloe and Churandy Martina in track events, and Eddy Stibbe in equestrianism. Martina carried the flag of the Netherlands Antilles at the ceremonies.

==Athletics==
===Men&#x27;s 100 meters===

Churandy Martina represented the Netherlands Antilles at the Athens Olympics in the men&#x27;s 100 meters race. Born in Willemstad, the capital city of the island Curaçao, Martina was 20 years old upon his entrance to the 2004 Summer Olympics. He had not previously competed at any Olympic games. On August 21, Martina competed in the eighth heat, which included nine athletes. He finished the race in 10.23 seconds, placing in third ahead of Germany&#x27;s Alexander Kosenkow (10.28 seconds) and behind Jamaica&#x27;s Dwight Thomas (10.21 seconds). The heat itself was led by Maurice Greene of the United States. The Dutch Antillean progressed to the next round. During the course of the quarterfinals, which took place on the same day, Martina competed in the first heat against seven other athletes. This time, he finished in seventh place with a time of 10.24 seconds. Martina placed ahead of Brazil&#x27;s André da Silva (10.34 seconds) and behind Canada&#x27;s Pierre Browne in a heat led by national-record-setting Portuguese runner Francis Obikwelu (9.93 seconds) and season-best-setting British runner Mark Lewis-Francis (10.12 seconds). Churandy Martina did not advance to the semifinal rounds which took place the next day.

===Men&#x27;s 200 meters===
Geronimo Goeloe also represented the Netherlands Antilles in track and field at the Athenian Olympics. He competed on the Dutch colony&#x27;s behalf in the men&#x27;s 200 meters race. Goeloe was born in Willemstad on Curaçao in 1981, making him 22 years old at the time of his competition at the Athens Olympics. Goeloe had not previously competed at any Olympic games. The qualification round of Goeloe&#x27;s event took place on August 24. The Dutch Antillean was placed in the second heat, where he faced seven other athletes. Goeloe finished the event in 21.09 seconds, placing seventh out of eight athletes; Brazil&#x27;s Basilio Emidio de Morais ranked behind him (21.14 seconds), and South Africa&#x27;s Leigh Julius ranked directly ahead (20.80 seconds).

===Eventing===
Eduard Peter Nicolaas Stibbe, known also as Eddy Stibbe, competed for the Netherlands Antilles as its only equestrian athlete. Stibbe competed in individual eventing. Born in 1948 in &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch, Stibbe first competed, aged 23, in the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany, riding the horse Autumn Flash and representing the Netherlands. He returned at the age of 43 to the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, riding Olympic Bahlua on the Netherlands&#x27; behalf. At age 51, Stibbe represented the Netherlands Antilles for the first time at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia on horse Eton, finishing his event for the first time. He returned again to the Olympics at the age of 55, riding horse Dusky Moon, for his fourth Olympic appearance and sixth Olympic event. On August 16, Stibbe faced 74 other athletes during the dressage portion of the event. The Dutch Antillean competitor accrued 57.80 penalty points but was awarded 62.40 points by one judge and 61.20 points by another, tying Jaroslav Hatla of the Czech Republic for 38th place. During the August 17 cross-country phase of the event, Stibbe accrued 49.20 penalty points (20 from jumping, 29.20 from time), finishing the race in 10:59. This placed him at 60th place of the 71 athletes who advanced to the cross-country round. Overall, at this point, Eddy Stibbe&#x27;s combined point values placed him at 58th place.

On 23 August, Eddy Stibbe competed in the qualification round of the event&#x27;s jumping phase. He accrued eight penalty points as a result of jumping errors, and four points as a result of time penalties. Stibbe placed 25th out of the 68 athletes finishing this phase of the event, and placed 53rd overall when combining all scores. The Dutch-born athlete did not qualify for the final round of the jumping set of the event.

<text>Antis is a Lithuanian postmodernist rock band.

==Name==

Literally, &quot;antis&quot; means &quot;duck&quot; in Lithuanian, but is also a colloquial term, a short for &quot;newspaper duck&quot;, which in several European languages means a false newspaper report, a . Algirdas Kaušpėdas has stated in an interview that the latter was the intended meaning. Additionally, being a play on the name of the official Soviet-era newspaper &quot;Tiesa&quot; (&quot;Truth&quot;, a calque of the official Soviet communist newspaper &quot;Pravda&quot;), the name alluded to the biased reporting and truth-bending in Eastern Bloc media. The cover of the band&#x27;s 1987 album displays the name &quot;Antis&quot; assembled from cut-out letters of &quot;Tiesa&quot;&#x27;s logo, with a matching N added. According to Kaušpėdas, contrary to popular belief, &quot;Antis&quot; was not originally intended to read as &quot;Anti-S&quot; in order to stand for &quot;Anti-Soviet&quot; . However, upon first hearing the name being interpreted in this way, he found it appropriate and did not object.

==History==

===Establishment===
In 1986, in the last days of the Soviet Union, there was an alternative music explosion in Lithuania. Before then, all &quot;western low-quality music&quot; was officially forbidden, with lists of proscribed bands including Ramones, AC/DC and Alice Cooper.

Algirdas &quot;Pablo&quot; Kaušpėdas founded Antis in 1984 as a joke to entertain attendees at a New Year party that he organised for the architects&#x27; union in Kaunas. The band&#x27;s performance was such a success that word of it spread all over Lithuania. Antis was a politically motivated band that played proscribed music in several styles, including ska. They also wrote their own songs with jaunty horns and witty ironic lyrics. In January 1986, a horn section from Vilnius joined the band and Petras &quot;Sniegius&quot; Ubartas (another architect who was a composer, trumpeter and guitarist) took over the musical leadership of the band so that Pablo could concentrate on lyrics and promotion. Antis was invited to play at the semi-underground festival at Vilnius University and at similar events.

===Gaining popularity===

At the &quot;Lituanica ’86&quot; festival Antis&#x27;s performance overshadowed those of the headline Russian rock stars Aquarium and Bravo. The subsequent publicity turned Antis into a national sensation and they became known as one of the best rock bands in the whole of the former Soviet Union. Antis grew to such popularity that their audiences numbered hundreds of thousands. They toured most of Europe and the United States.

Algirdas Kaušpėdas designed a dramatic live show with painted faces, besuited musicians, motorbikes, and spaceship models on stage. The band made three video clips, which were later used in the 1986 musical film &quot;Kažkas Atsitiko&quot; (&quot;Something Happened&quot;). Kaušpėdas&#x27; lyrics were sharply critical of the Soviet regime; an appealing stance for many people during Perestroika. Personnel changes improved the band&#x27;s musicianship and their music became more sophisticated. Early Antis was heavily influenced by Talking Heads. One of their biggest hits was a cover version of a Men at Work song. Later Sniegius added sounds derived from the work of Frank Zappa.

At the end of 1986 Antis recorded their eponymous debut album at Melodya&#x27;s Vilnius studio. The self-titled LP was released in 1987 and became one of the best-sold records in Lithuania. Their second album was recorded in 1988 in the CCS studio in Warsaw. The band planned to release this independently but Melodya objected and the ensuing litigation delayed release by a year. The last recording session took place in a Vilnius studio in 1988. Those songs with some selected numbers from the Warsaw session appeared as &quot;Anties Dovanėlė&quot; (&quot;Antis&#x27;s Present&quot;) in 1989.

===Disbanding===
Antis gave their final tours in the second half of 1989 and early 1990 including appearances at festivals in Italy, Austria, Germany, France and USA, where they participated at the NY New Music Seminar and played at the CBGB. In 1990 Algirdas Kaušpėdas quit music for politics and then returned to architecture. The rest of the band continued rehearsing and composing, and auditioned some new vocalists but Pablo proved to have been the heart of the band, so they broke up. Some members left the music business and others joined other projects. Kaušpėdas manages a design company and is still an important figure in Lithuanian music and culture.

===Aftermath===
In 1994 Zona/BMK released two Antis microcassettes. The EP &quot;Bjaurioji Antis&quot; (&quot;Ugly Antis&quot;) included the earliest amateur recordings from Kaunas, before the arrival of the horns. &quot;Retas Paukštis&quot; (&quot;Rare Bird&quot;) contained all the songs that had not been released on the Melodya albums. The final album, &quot;Geriausios Dainos&quot;, was a &quot;best of&quot; compilation, released on CD and MC formats by Zona/BMK in May 1995.

Algirdas Kaušpėdas formed the &quot;Antis Orchestra&quot; briefly in 1996 using past members and session musicians to recreate the Antis sound for three open-air concerts as part of the Lithuanian Rock March. Most of the original members also reformed briefly in 2003 to promote the release by Zona of most Antis recordings on four CDs (&quot;Kažkas atsitiko&quot;, &quot;Antis&quot;, &quot;Ša!&quot; and &quot;Dovanėlė&quot;) and a box-set &quot;Visa Antis&quot;.

The band was a subject of Giedrė Žickytė&#x27;s 2011 documentary .

===Resurrection===
After 17 years of silence (the last album having been released in 1990), the band released &quot;Ančių dainos&quot; (&quot;Songs of Ducks&quot;) on 16 December 2007. Initial album sales beat the expectations and became best-selling album by Antis. The band played their official farewell concert on July 5, 2016 at Trakai Island Castle, followed by another performance the next day at Raudondvaris Castle, ending the story of Antis where it had begun.

<text>Portable art (sometimes called mobiliary art) refers to the small examples of Prehistoric art that could be carried from place to place, which is especially characteristic of the Art of the Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic eras. Often made of ivory, bone, antlers or stone, these pieces have been found in South Africa all the way up to Eurasia. It is one of the two main categories of Prehistoric art, the other being the immobile Parietal art, effectively synonymous with rock art.

Though the game hunted for food was a recurring subject within portable art, the over 10,000 pieces that have been discovered exhibit a great diversity in terms of scale, subject, use, date of creation, and media. Originally seen as less important than the cave paintings (see Lascaux, Chauvet, or Nawarla Gabarnmang) that also marked prehistoric art, portable art was thought to be merely preceding sketches or plans to be developed in later, larger parietal, or permanent, art. Over the years, however, the study of portable art has come into its own as archaeologists realize much information about prehistoric culture, livelihood, and societal structure can be gathered from these works or art.

== Categories of Portable Art ==

*Slightly Modified Natural Objects
Usually composed of fossils, teeth, shells, and bone, slightly modified natural objects were pre-existing objects which prehistoric man altered by etching lines or patterns, drilling holes, or other simple techniques which changed the original object into a piece of artwork, typically jewellery.
*Engraved or Painted Stone
As many as 1,000 sites with instances of decorated stone have been discovered. Sandstone, limestone, slate, or stalagmite were the most common types of material employed, and were usually adorned with animal figures or symbols. Such pieces have been interpreted by some archaeologists to be predecessors serving as sketches to a later, more developed cave painting.
*Engraved or Painted Bone

Similar to engraved or painted stone works, the subjects of the bone pieces were typically game animals and symbols. Unlike their stone counterparts, however, decorated bone works are often much smaller in scale and are seen less frequently, as bone is much more difficult than stone to engrave.
*Carved Bone and Antler
Most frequently used in the carving of spear-throwers, carved bone and antler pieces are significant because of the great amount of time, effort, and painstaking detail with which they were carved. As a result, a common belief among archaeologists is that such works were crafted in the hopes of bringing good luck on a hunt.
*Statuettes and Ivory Carvings
While it is the rounded female statuettes, dubbed venus figurines, that have garnered the most attention, sculpted objects also featured more &quot;normal&quot; human depictions, as well as that of animals. The statuettes and carvings were done using flint tools in a wide variety of materials, ranging from their simple inception as terracottas, to limestone, sandstone, ivory, stealite, coal, jet, and even amber.

* Figurative

This is a broader term that encapsulates many forms of the above portable art. Figurative art includes three dimensional statues of animals or humans, and figures carved, imprinted, or painted on media. Figurative art resembles animals or humans, or &quot;figures.&quot;

* Non-figurative

Non-figurative art is abstract designs imprinted on media. Often carved or painted, non-figurative art are objects that were often used for decor, or jewelry.

== Specific pieces ==

* Scored Ochre from Pinnacle Point Cave

This is the oldest portable are discovered to date. It was made approximately 134,000 years ago, and was discovered in Pinnacle Point Cave. Scored ochre has been found in other sites as well, such as a piece from 100,000 years ago in Klansies River Cave, and 17 found in Blombos Cave.

* Neschers antler
This was the first piece of portable art recognized by an archaeologist. Found at Neschers, it is a 12,500 year old reindeer antler with a carving of a horse on the surface.

* Plaques from Apollo 11 cave

These are the earliest forms of figurative portable art found in South Africa. Seven Plaques were found in Apollo 11 Cave, all with figures painted on them (such as rhinoceroses, horses, humans, and therianthropes.)

* Ivory Figurines from Swabian Alps

These are the oldest figurines from Eurasia. These figurines are dated from 35,000 to 30,000 years ago. Several ivory figurines depicting many types of animals were found all over the Swabian Alps.

== Dating and its difficulty ==
The vast span of time, as long as 40,000 years in some cases, separating the creation of portable art and its subsequent analysis poses a great problem in dating the works. The typical method for dating ancient material, radiocarbon dating, poses the possibility of destroying the piece, and also only works to date the animal bone, antler, or other material with which the art was created, not the date that the art itself was created. A common solution to this problem has been to study instead the stratigraphy of the piece within the deposits of its surroundings. In many cases, however, even stratigraphical dating is impossible, due to the disregard early archaeologists gave when excavating the caves or other sites portable art were discovered in. The destruction of a datable stratigraphy also commonly occurred as a result from ransacking and illegal digs focused not on the study of the material they discovered, but on its re-sale value. All disruptions of the stratigraphy destroy the provenance from which a date could be established.

Also posing a difficulty to stratigraphical analysis is the possibility that the time of an object&#x27;s creation and final deposit can vary greatly. Many portable objects are believed to have served as ritual objects, being passed down from generation to generation, keeping them in use for hundreds or thousands of years. Through the migration of prehistoric man, it is possible that the final resting place of an object is hundreds or even thousands of miles from the point of its original creation.

Though difficult, dating portable objects provides an important link in building a chronology of the art, and thus evolution of prehistoric man. While the specific trends associated with a given period are not always agreed on among all scientists due to the subjective nature of art, broad similarities and patterns can be formed which work to augment the archaeological study or prehistoric man by forming observations and theories on which other archaeologists can develop.

<doc id="908305" wikidata="Q1756519" url="?curid=908305" title="Judge Dee">
<text>Judge Dee, or Judge Di, is a semi-fictional character based on the historical figure Di Renjie, county magistrate and statesman of the Tang court. The character appeared in the 18th-century Chinese detective and &quot;gong&#x27;an&quot; crime novel &quot;Di Gong An&quot;. After Robert van Gulik came across it in an antiquarian book store in Tokyo, he translated the novel into English and then used the style and characters to write his own original Judge Dee historical mystery stories.

The series is set in Tang dynasty China and deals with criminal cases solved by the upright and shrewd Judge Dee, who as county magistrate in the Chinese imperial legal system was both the investigating magistrate and judge.

==Di Gong An==

The Judge Dee character is based on the historical figure Di Renjie (c. 630 – c. 700), magistrate and statesman of the Tang court. During the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) in China, a &quot;folk novel&quot; was written set in former times, but filled with anachronisms. 

Van Gulik found a copy of the 18th-century &quot;Di Gong An&quot; novel (; lit. &quot;Cases of Judge Dee&quot;) in a Tokyo book store. It&#x27;s an original tale dealing with three cases simultaneously. For the most part the overbearing supernatural plot elements, common among Chinese mystery tales of that period, were lacking in this case, making the story more accessible to Western readers. He translated it into English and had it published in 1949 under the title &quot;Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee&quot;.

==Van Gulik&#x27;s stories==
Van Gulik began writing his own novels with the character, eventually authoring sixteen books. Van Gulik was careful in writing the main novels to deal with cases wherein Dee was newly appointed to a city, thereby isolating him from the existing lifestyle and enabling him to maintain an objective role in the books. Van Gulik&#x27;s novels and stories are often referred to as the &quot;Shih Ti&quot;.

Dee is initially assisted only by his faithful clerk, Sergeant Hoong Liang, an old family retainer. In &quot;The Chinese Gold Murders&quot;, which describes Dee&#x27;s initial appointment and first criminal cases, the judge encounters two highwaymen, euphemistically called &quot;men of the green woods&quot;, Ma Joong and Chiao Tai, who attempt to rob him but are so impressed with his character that they give up their criminal careers and join his retinue on the spot. This encounter is recounted in a short flashback passage in the original &quot;Di Gong An&quot;, taking place when the two are already long-serving loyal members of his retinue. A little later, in &quot;The Chinese Lake Murders&quot;, a third criminal, Tao Gan, an itinerant confidence trickster and swindler, similarly joins. Judge Dee ends his career in &quot;Murder in Canton&quot; being promoted to the position of senior Metropolitan Judge in the capital, and his assistants obtain official ranks in the Army and civil service.

Van Gulik also wrote a series of newspaper comics about Judge Dee in 1964–1967, which totalled 19 adventures. The first four were regular balloon strips, but the later 15 had the more typically Dutch textblock under the pictures.

Judge Dee, naturally, is responsible for deciding sentences as well as assessing guilt or innocence, although van Gulik notes in the stories that all capital punishments must be referred to and decided by officials in the capital. One of the sentences he frequently has to deal with is slow slicing; if he is inclined to mercy, he orders the final, fatal, cut to be made first, thus rendering the ceremony anticlimactic.

Van Gulik&#x27;s Judge Dee novels have been translated into Chinese.

==Other authors==
Several other authors have created stories based on Van Gulik&#x27;s Judge Dee character:
* French author Frédéric Lenormand wrote 19 new Judge Dee mysteries from year 2004 at Editions Fayard, Paris (not yet translated into English). Some of them have been translated into Spanish (Ediciones Paidos Iberica), Portuguese (Europress), Bulgarian (Paradox), Czech (Garamond) and Polish.
* Sven Roussel, another French author, has written &quot;La dernière enquête du Juge Ti&quot;.
* The Chinese-American author Zhu Xiao Di wrote ten original short stories about Judge Dee collected in &quot;Tales of Judge Dee&quot; (2006), set when the Judge was the magistrate of Poo-yang (the same time period as &quot;The Chinese Bell Murders&quot; and several other novels). Zhu Xiao Di has no relation to Robert van Gulik but tried to stay faithful to the fictionalized history of van Gulik&#x27;s Judge Dee.
* Judge Dee appears, along with a fictionalized Wu Zetian, in books one (&quot;Iron Empress: A Novel of Mystery and Madness in Ancient China&quot;) and two (&quot;Shore of Pearls: A Novel of Murder, Plague, and the Prison Island of Hainan&quot;) of Eleanor Cooney &amp; Daniel Alteri&#x27;s historical T&#x27;ang Trilogy.
* Qiu Xiaolong, best known for his Inspector Chen series, released a new Judge Dee novel &quot;The Shadow of the Empire&quot; in 2021.

==Bibliography==
===By van Gulik===
The following novels and short stories were published in English by van Gulik. The short story collection &quot;Judge Dee at Work&quot; (published in 1967) contains a &quot;Judge Dee Chronology&quot; detailing Dee&#x27;s various posts in specific years and stories set in these times. Van Gulik&#x27;s last two books, &quot;Poets and Murder&quot; and &quot;Necklace and Calabash&quot;, were not listed in the chronology, as they were written after &quot;Judge Dee at Work&quot;, but they are both set in the time when Judge Dee was the magistrate in Poo-yang.

<doc id="908310" wikidata="Q3182471" url="?curid=908310" title="John Sloan Dickey">
<text>John Sloan Dickey (November 4, 1907 – February 9, 1991) was an American diplomat, scholar, and intellectual. Dickey served as the 12th President of Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, from 1945 to 1970, and helped revitalize the Ivy League institution.

==Early life and education==
Dickey was born in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, on November 4, 1907. He completed his undergraduate degree at Dartmouth College in 1929, and later graduated from Harvard Law School.

==Career==
Dickey had a varied career: partner at a major Boston law firm, special assistant to the Assistant Secretary of State and later to the Secretary of State, a member of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs and the division of World Trade Intelligence, and Director of the State Department&#x27;s Office of Public Affairs.

Even after 1945, when Dickey became President of Dartmouth College, he remained a figure in public policy. He served on President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s 1947 President&#x27;s Committee on Civil Rights. A strong believer in the value of efforts towards international cooperation, he was part of the United Nations&#x27; Collective Measures Committee in 1951. 

During 1952–53, he was one of five members chosen by Secretary of State Dean Acheson for the State Department Panel of Consultants on Disarmament, and he played a significant role in the panel&#x27;s stark report about the dangers of nuclear weapons and relations with the Soviet Union.

===Dartmouth College president===

Dickey served as the 12th President of Dartmouth College from 1945 to 1970. Regularly welcoming freshmen at Convocation with the phrase &quot;your business here is learning,&quot; Dickey was committed to making Dartmouth College the nation&#x27;s best liberal arts college.

Dickey&#x27;s commitment to the liberal arts, or, as he termed them &quot;the liberating arts,&quot; was perhaps best expressed in an innovative course on &quot;Great Issues,&quot; designed to introduce seniors to the problems of national and international relations they would face as citizens. President Dickey also reintroduced doctoral programs to Dartmouth, and a Northern Studies program and a Russian Civilization department. Dickey sought to expand the horizons of Dartmouth beyond Hanover and introduced foreign studies programs, a public affairs internship, and various social action programs. The William Jewett Tucker Foundation was opened by President Dickey, offering students opportunity and academic credit for social activism.

During his 25-year tenure, Dickey headed two capital campaigns, doubled African American student enrollment, reinvigorated Dartmouth Medical School, built the Hopkins Center and instituted continuing education for alumni. Consistent with his concern for, awareness of, and involvement in the great movements of the time, he saw the emerging importance of computers, a field then in its infancy, and built the Kiewit Computation Center in 1966. After stepping down as president, he continued his affiliation with the college by teaching Canadian-American relations as the Bicentennial Professor of Public Affairs.

In 1982, the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding was opened at Dartmouth to honor Dickey&#x27;s legacy and &quot;coordinate, sustain, and enrich the international dimension of liberal arts education at Dartmouth.&quot;

<doc id="908317" wikidata="Q1659560" url="?curid=908317" title="The White Horse Inn (operetta)">
<text>The White Horse Inn (or White Horse Inn) (German title: Im weißen Rößl) is an operetta or musical comedy by Ralph Benatzky and Robert Stolz in collaboration with a number of other composers and writers, set in the picturesque Salzkammergut region of Upper Austria. It is about the head waiter of the White Horse Inn in St. Wolfgang who is desperately in love with the owner of the inn, a resolute young woman who at first only has eyes for one of her regular guests.

Sometimes classified as an operetta, the show enjoyed huge successes in London&#x27;s West End (651 performances at the Coliseum starting 8 April 1931) and as a Broadway version; it was filmed several times. Like &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; and the three &quot;Sissi&quot; movies, the operetta and its several film adaptations have contributed to the popular image of Austria as an alpine idyll for tourists]]. Today, &quot;Im weißen Rößl&quot; is mainly remembered for its songs, many of which have become popular classics.

==The original play==

In the last decade of the 19th century, Oscar Blumenthal, a theatre director from Berlin, Germany, was on holiday in Lauffen (now part of Bad Ischl), a small town in the vicinity of St. Wolfgang. There, at the inn where he was staying, Blumenthal happened to witness the head waiter&#x27;s painful wooing of his boss, a widow. Amused, Blumenthal used the story as the basis of a comedy without music; which he co-authored with actor Gustav Kadelburg. However, Blumenthal and Kadelburg relocated the action from Lauffen to the much more prominent St. Wolfgang, where the actual Gasthof Weißes Rößl had existed since 1878. Having thus chanced upon a suitable title, the authors went to work, and &quot;Im weißen Rößl&quot; eventually premiered in Berlin in 1897.

The play was an immediate success. The Berlin audiences laughed at the comic portrayal of well-to-do city dwellers such as Wilhelm Giesecke, a manufacturer of underwear, and his daughter Ottilie, who have travelled all the way from Berlin to St. Wolfgang and now, on holiday, cannot help displaying many of the characteristics of the nouveaux-riches. &quot;Wär&#x27; ick bloß nach Ahlbeck jefahren&quot;—&quot;If only I had gone to Ahlbeck&quot;, Giesecke sighs as he considers his unfamiliar surroundings and the strange dialect spoken by the wild mountain people that inhabit the Salzkammergut. At the same time the play promoted tourism in Austria, especially in and around St. Wolfgang, with a contemporary edition of the Baedeker praising the natural beauty of the region and describing the White Horse Inn as nicely situated at the lakefront next to where the steamboat can be taken for a romantic trip across the Wolfgangsee. The White Horse Inn was even awarded a Baedeker star.

Sydney Rosenfeld, a prolific American adapter of foreign plays, premièred an English version of the play titled &quot;At the White Horse Tavern&quot; at Wallack&#x27;s Theatre in 1899, with a cast including Amelia Bingham and Leo Ditrichstein.

==The musical comedy==
Just as the play was about to be forgotten—a silent film &quot;The White Horse Inn&quot; directed by Richard Oswald and starring Liane Haid had been made in Germany in 1926—it was revived, again in Berlin, and this time as a musical comedy. During a visit to the Salzkammergut, the actor Emil Jannings told Berlin theatre manager Erik Charell about the comedy. Charell was interested and commissioned a group of prominent authors and composers to come up with a musical show based on Blumenthal and Kadelburg&#x27;s play. They were Ralph Benatzky, Robert Stolz and Bruno Granichstaedten (music), Robert Gilbert (lyrics), Hans Müller-Einigen and Charell himself.

The show premiered in Berlin on 8 November 1930. Immediately afterwards it became a success around the world, with long runs in cities like London, Paris, Vienna, Munich and New York. During the Third Reich the comedy was marginalized and not performed (Goebbels called it &quot;eine Revue, die uns heute zum Hals heraushängt&quot;—&quot;the kind of entertainment we find boring and superfluous today&quot;), whereas people in the 1950s, keen on harmony and shallow pleasures, eagerly greeted revivals of the show. German-language films based on the musical comedy were made in 1935, 1952 and 1960.

==Roles==
==Synopsis==
It is summertime at the Wolfgangsee. Josepha Vogelhuber, the young, attractive but resolute owner of the White Horse Inn, has been courted for some time by her head waiter, Leopold Brandmeyer. While appreciating his aptness for the job, she mistrusts all men as potential gold-diggers, rejects Leopold&#x27;s advances and longingly waits for the arrival of Dr Siedler, a lawyer who has been one of her regular guests for many years. This year, Josepha hopes, Siedler might eventually propose to her.

When Siedler arrives, he finds himself in the very same place as Wilhelm Giesecke, his client Sülzheimer&#x27;s business rival, and immediately falls in love with Giesecke&#x27;s beautiful daughter Ottilie. As it happens, Sülzheimer&#x27;s son Sigismund, a would-be beau, also arrives at the White Horse Inn. Angry at first about Siedler&#x27;s presence at the same inn, Giesecke soon has the idea of marrying off his daughter to Sigismund Sülzheimer, thus turning a pending lawsuit into an advantageous business merger. However, Siedler&#x27;s love is reciprocated by Ottilie, who adamantly refuses to marry Sigismund, while Sigismund himself has fallen for Klärchen Hinzelmann, a naive beauty who accompanies her professorial father on a tour through the Salzkammergut.

Seeing all this, Leopold Brandmeyer decides that he has had enough and quits his job. Josepha has also done a lot of thinking in the meantime, reconsiders her head waiter&#x27;s proposal of marriage, and can persuade him to stay—not just as an employee but also as proprietor. Love gets its way with the other two couples as well, and the play ends with the prospect of a triple marriage.

==Film adaptations==
A post-war Argentinian movie in Spanish, &quot;La Hostería del caballito blanco&quot;, was directed by Benito Perojo and released in 1948. A Danish film of 1964 by Erik Balling, &quot;Sommer i Tyrol&quot; (although Tyrol is the original setting), starred Dirch Passer and Susse Wold.

In addition, the musical triggered a number of spin-offs such as the 1961 Austrian comedy film &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Black Horse Inn&quot;), directed by Franz Antel, about a young woman (surprisingly, it was Karin Dor again, who had just played Giesecke&#x27;s daughter in the 1960 version) who inherits a dilapidated hotel on the shores of the Wolfgangsee. As a matter of fact, a number of hotels in St. Wolfgang do use similar names (Black Horse, White Stag, etc.).

Most recently, a new musical film adaptation of &quot;Im Weissen Rössl&quot; came out in November 2013 with the German title &quot;&quot; from director . Unlike its predecessors, however, the movie was not filmed on location at the Hotel Im Weissen Rössl in St. Wolfgang, Austria.

<doc id="908327" wikidata="Q1886410" url="?curid=908327" title="Viewtiful Joe (video game)">
<text>is a 2003 beat &#x27;em up platform video game developed by Team Viewtiful and published by Capcom for the GameCube. It was originally released as a part of the Capcom Five, under director Hideki Kamiya and producer Atsushi Inaba. The game was later ported to the PlayStation 2 by the same design team under the name Clover Studio, subtitled in Japan . The game&#x27;s story concerns Joe, an avid movie-goer whose girlfriend Silvia is kidnapped during a film starring Joe&#x27;s favorite superhero, Captain Blue. Joe is shortly thereafter thrust into Movieland, where Silvia is taken by the villainous group known as Jadow. After accepting a special V-Watch from Captain Blue, Joe transforms into the tokusatsu-style persona &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; and sets out to rescue her.

The gameplay of &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; features traditional 2D platform side-scrolling intermixed with 3D cel-shaded graphics. Abilities known as &quot;VFX Powers&quot; grant the player special actions for combat and puzzle-solving, such as slowing down or speeding up time. &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; was critically acclaimed for its unique visual style and gameplay, earning itself a number of awards from various media publications. A minor commercial success, the game spawned several sequels, with releases seen on other consoles such as the PlayStation Portable (PSP) and Nintendo DS. An anime adaption of the game and a manga series were also produced.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot;″s core gameplay is similar to a traditional side-scrolling beat &#x27;em up. Taking control of Joe, the player is mostly limited to moving left, right, up, and down on a fixed 2D path. The game contains platforming elements, such as the ability to jump and double jump. Combat consists of fighting multiple enemies on screen at once, with the enemies appearing from all directions, including the foreground and background. Joe has the ability to punch, kick, and dodge—which he can do by leaping upward or ducking. Dodging enemies&#x27; attacks successfully temporarily dazes them, leaving them wide open for attack. The player has certain number of hit points in the form of &quot;Life Marks&quot; located above the VFX Gauge, which decrease whenever Joe takes damage. Health can be restored by picking up hamburgers.

&quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; features unique gameplay elements in the form of Joe&#x27;s &quot;Viewtiful Effects (VFX) Power&quot;, which is designed to emulate camera tricks seen in films. VFX Power is used in both battling enemies, and solving various puzzles. These three powers are limited by the &quot;VFX Gauge&quot; located at the top of the screen. Normally, the meter is full, giving the player access to Joe&#x27;s super powers via his Viewtiful Joe transformation. The meter slowly empties when an ability is in use. Once it depletes, Viewtiful Joe changes to normal Joe, lowering his attack and defense and leaving him temporarily devoid of VFX Power. The VFX Gauge automatically refills over time, and can also be manually filled by picking up bottles of &quot;VFX Juice&quot;. The first VFX Power is &quot;Slow&quot;, which slows time, causing the player&#x27;s attacks to be more powerful, increasing Joe&#x27;s reflexes, and allowing him to dodge attacks more easily. The second VFX Power, &quot;Mach Speed&quot;, allows Joe to move at a faster speed, creating multiple after-images of him when he unleashes a flurry of attacks on all enemies on the screen. It can additionally cause his attacks to envelop Joe in a temporary heat shield, rendering him immune to flame attacks and setting enemies on fire when struck. The last VFX Power, &quot;Zoom In&quot;, causes a camera close-up of Joe, powering up his normal attacks, granting him a set of new attacks, and paralyzing all lesser foes in proximity to him. However, any damage dealt to Joe whilst zoomed in is increased too. Any two VFX Powers can be combined. The VFX Gauge can be extended by collecting a certain number of V-Films present in each stage. The bar reverts to its normal length when a new stage begins.

Defeating enemies gives the player &quot;V-Points&quot; in the form of small and large coins, while using special attacks gives them &quot;V-Marks&quot;, or &quot;Viewtifuls&quot;, which can be converted into V-Points. Viewtifuls can be quickly gained by using combos or long chains of attacks. For example, while using Slow, striking a dazed enemy sets up all other enemies on the screen for a chain reaction, causing all points accrued during the duration of Slow to be multiplied by the number of enemies struck. If used deftly, the player will accumulate a large number of Viewtifuls due to the multiplier effect called &quot;X-Bonus&quot;. Each stage in &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; consists of several interconnected missions, or scenes, that the player must complete in order to advance. When completing the stage, the player is graded on the number of V-Points earned, the amount of time taken, and how much damage Joe took. V-Points can be used between stages to purchase new abilities, expendable weapons (which include the &quot;Voomerang&quot; and &quot;Shocking Pink Bombs&quot;), more health, and health-restorative items. Clearing the game on various difficulties allows players to play as different characters such as Silvia, Captain Blue and Alastor, with the PlayStation 2 version also allowing players to play as &quot;Devil May Cry&quot;″s Dante.

==Plot==
&quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; is divided into seven stages, or &quot;episodes&quot;, interspersed with storyline cutscenes, and bookended by an opening and ending cinematic. The setting is divided between Earth, and &quot;Movieland&quot;, the game&#x27;s fictional world of films. The plot begins in a movie theatre on Earth, in which the game&#x27;s central character Joe and his girlfriend Silvia are watching a tokusatsu drama, starring the aged superhero Captain Blue. The movie&#x27;s antagonist, having seemingly defeated Captain Blue, suddenly reaches out of the screen and abducts Silvia, taking her into Movieland. Joe is likewise picked up and taken into Movieland by Captain Blue&#x27;s giant mecha, &quot;Six Majin&quot;. Inside the movie, Joe must rescue Silvia from the evil Jadow, the game&#x27;s organization of villains. To help him, Captain Blue entrusts him with a V-Watch, a device Joe can use to transform into a superhero upon saying the word &quot;henshin (transform).&quot; Joe promptly does so, inventing his own catchphrase: &quot;Henshin-a-go-go, baby!&quot;

With the guidance of Captain Blue, Joe fights his way through a number of Movieland&#x27;s locations such as cities, caves, an underwater base, and a submarine, often travelling via his trusty, robot aircraft &quot;Six Machine&quot;. One by one, Joe defeats the members of the Jadow, the game&#x27;s bosses. These include Dark Fiend Charles the 3rd, Iron Ogre Hulk Davidson, Aquatic Terror Gran Bruce, a doppelgänger of Viewtiful Joe, and Blade Master Alastor. Before fighting Alastor, he reveals that in order for the Jadow to break out of Movieland and into the land of humans, they need the &quot;DNA of the Creator&quot;, namely Silvia. Joe makes his way to her, trumping the Jadow&#x27;s leader Inferno Lord Fire Leo in combat, only to witness Silvia being kidnapped once again afterwards. Joe and Six Machine race off into outer space after her in the game&#x27;s final episode.

Finding Silvia atop the control room of a space station, Joe discovers that Captain Blue has been behind the plot the entire time. The former hero reveals that he is the creator of the film in which they currently exist, and that he is Silvia&#x27;s seemingly-deceased father. Transforming into the colossal robot King Blue, the villain proclaims that he will take Sylvia&#x27;s energy by force in order to break into the real world. Joe tells him off, telling him that he&#x27;s no hero. Joe summons Six Majin, and the two engage in combat. When the fight ends, Captain Blue and Viewtiful Joe abandon their respective vehicles, and face off in a final battle within the space station.

Joe is victorious, and Captain Blue, finally coming to his senses, thanks the young hero for stopping him. He explains that two decades earlier, Blue was a revolutionary film maker who was soon thought of as a fad. Wanting nothing more than to create heroes, Blue was sucked into one of his own films, allowing him to live out his dream as a hero. However, he had lost touch with reality, and wanted revenge on the people who had betrayed him. As Captain Blue and Silvia embrace in a heartfelt reunion, the director tells Joe that the story is not complete. He snaps his fingers, and the space station&#x27;s onboard computer warns of a large number of UFOs heading towards Earth. Blue tells Joe that a hero will be needed twice more to save the world. Joe attempts to leave, but not before Silvia requests a V-Watch from her father and to accompany her boyfriend. Viewtiful Joe and a newly transformed Silvia head out to stop the impending threat together.

==Development==
&quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; was developed by the design staff &quot;Team Viewtiful&quot;, a part of Capcom Production Studio 4. The game was announced in late 2002 as part of the Capcom Five, a line-up of five then-upcoming GameCube games to introduce new content to the console. It was directed by Capcom alumnus Hideki Kamiya, whose previous credits include the planning of &quot;Resident Evil&quot; and &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; and the direction of &quot;Devil May Cry&quot;. It was produced by Atsushi Inaba, who previously worked on the &quot;Ace Attorney&quot; series and &quot;Steel Battalion&quot;. In its earliest stages of development, &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; went under the working title &quot;Red Hot Man&quot;, but the name was changed due to copyright conflicts with the American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers. &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot;″s development team initially consisted of six people working under a twelve-month deadline. As work continued, the size of the team grew, and development ended up taking a full 21 months to complete. The game was conceived as a &quot;staff-focused project&quot; aimed at increasing the skill of its creators, specifically director Kamiya.

Inaba stated, &quot;We wanted to create a challenging game with stunning visuals and fluid gameplay&quot;. As a lifelong fan of superheroes, Inaba&#x27;s aim was to combine traditional Japanese tokusatsu with American comic books. The character designs created by Kumiko Suekane were inspired specifically by 1960s and 1970s Japanese-costumed tokusatsu television shows such as &quot;Kamen Rider&quot; and &quot;Ultraman&quot;. Graphically, the game adopted a 2D side-scrolling style mixed with 3D cel-shaded animation. Despite many games in the then-modern industry shying away from 2D graphical formats, Inaba said, &quot;We have been able to breathe new life into the genre because we are using a new stylistic way that hasn&#x27;t been seen before.&quot; The team chose the GameCube as its platform because of their target audience and because it lent itself well to &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot;″s gameplay.

The musical score for &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; was co-composed by Masakazu Sugimori and . It was released alongside the score for &quot;Viewtiful Joe 2&quot; on a double album titled &quot;Viewtiful Joe + Viewtiful Joe 2 Original Soundtrack&quot; in Japan on 22 December 2004 by Suleputer. A music video is played within the game featuring a rap vocal song titled &quot;Viewtiful World&quot; composed by D.A.I. The video features a group of people, including Inaba himself, motion captured as some of the game&#x27;s characters. On 11 June 2003, Avex released the video on DVD and released the song as a single. Both the North American and Japanese releases of &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; feature English voice acting in order to keep a &quot;western comic book feel to [the game].&quot; Voice-over work in &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; was provided by Soundelux Design Music Group. Voice actors for the game include Dee Bradley Baker, Christina Puccelli, Gregg Berger, Mikey Kelley, Roger Rose, and Kevin Michael Richardson. Director Hideki Kamiya provides the voice for Six Machine.

A budget re-release of the game for the GameCube titled &quot;Viewtiful Joe: Revival&quot; was released in Japan in late 2003, adding a &quot;Sweet Mode&quot; to decrease the difficulty setting from the original game&#x27;s &quot;Kids Mode&quot;. A PlayStation 2 port of &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; was released by Clover Studio in 2004. It was released in Japan with the subtitle &quot;A New Hope&quot;. The release added the character Dante of &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; as an unlockable character. The PlayStation 2 version does not feature progressive scan seen in the GameCube version. The game was also re-released under Nintendo&#x27;s GameCube Player&#x27;s Choice label in 2004 in North America and Europe.

It is said that Director Kamiya based Joe&#x27;s run animation on how he got to work, and the bosses of the game are based on Capcom executives.

In a 2017 interview with &quot;Dengeki PlayStation&quot;, Kamiya expressed interest in remaking the game.

==Reception==
===Reviews and sales===
&quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; received critical acclaim upon its release. Metacritic lists the GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions of the game at 93 out of 100 and 90 out of 100, respectively. The game&#x27;s graphics, gameplay, and challenge were all common areas of praise among many reviewers. &quot;IGN&quot; gave &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; an &quot;Outstanding&quot; rating, noting that the beautiful cel-shaded graphics and high-intensity action make it one of the best action games on the GameCube and PlayStation 2. Likewise, &quot;Eurogamer&quot; called it &quot;imaginative, beautiful, engaging and above all else entertaining&quot;. Game Informer praised it as &quot;a completely original and highly entertaining work of art&quot;. Criticisms about &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; have been few, but consistent among reviews. &quot;IGN&quot; complained of the game&#x27;s lack of boss variety. &quot;GameSpy&quot; has concurred, noting that the bosses were too easy due to a powerful attack that the player can perform. Reviewers have also criticized the lack of progressive scan in the game&#x27;s PlayStation 2 port. &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;Eurogamer&quot; have additionally pointed out that the PlayStation 2 port suffers slowdown in later stages of the game.

In Japan, the GameCube version of &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; sold through its initial shipment of less than 100,000 copies during the week of its release. Preorders of the GameCube version sold out on Capcom&#x27;s North American website prior to its ship date, and &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; debuted as the tenth best-selling game in the region. The PlayStation 2 version sold a poor 9,912 units in its first week of release in Japan. Worldwide, sales of the game reached 275,000 copies on the GameCube and 46,000 on the PlayStation 2. Sales of the game in both North America and Europe were lower than what Capcom had predicted, but due to its small budget, the game was considered by Inaba to be relatively successful commercially.

===Legacy===
&quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; garnered a number of awards and nominations from various magazines, popular gaming websites, and video game award programs. &quot;IGN&quot; named &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; &quot;GameCube Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Best Action Game of 2003&quot;. At &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Best of 2003, the game was nominated for &quot;Best Artistic Achievement in a Game&quot;, &quot;Coolest New Character&quot;, &quot;Best GameCube Game&quot;, &quot;Readers&#x27; Choice Best GameCube Action Game&quot;, and &quot;Readers&#x27; Choice GameCube Game of the Year&quot;. It was also named the fourth-best GameCube game of 2003 by &quot;GameSpy&quot;, winning the website&#x27;s &quot;Most Stylish&quot; award for the year. &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; won &quot;Most Innovative Game Design&quot; in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2003 Player&#x27;s Choice Awards. It won &quot;GameCube Game of the Year&quot; awards for 2003 from both &quot;USA Today&quot; and &quot;GMR&quot;. The game was nominated by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences for &quot;Console Platform Action/Adventure Game of the Year&quot; in 2004 and was nominated for three British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Awards including &quot;Best Design&quot;, &quot;Best Intro/Animation&quot;, and &quot;Best GameCube Game&quot;. The game won &quot;Unsung Hero Game of the Year&quot; at the 2003 Golden Joystick Awards and &quot;Best New Franchise&quot; at the 2004 &quot;G-Phoria&quot; awards. Finally, it was recognized at the 4th Annual Game Developers Choice Awards as one of three &quot;Game Innovation Spotlights&quot;.

&quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; has been included in a number of &quot;best games&quot; lists in the years following its release. It was rated the 27th best game made on a Nintendo system in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;″s &quot;Top 200 Games&quot; list in February 2006 and the 10th best game on the GameCube in its August 2008 issue reflecting on the top 20 games for each system. Both &quot;GameSpy&quot; and the G4 television program &quot;X-Play&quot; named &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; the ninth best game of all time for the GameCube. In 2007, &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; was named the 17th best GameCube game of all time in &quot;IGN&quot;″s feature reflecting on the system&#x27;s long lifespan. Later in 2007, &quot;ScrewAttack&quot; listed the game at seventh on their Top 10 GameCube Games of All Time.

&quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; was successful enough to establish a franchise, and a few other related media titles were released. &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; was followed by a direct sequel titled &quot;Viewtiful Joe 2&quot;—released for both the GameCube and PlayStation 2—and two spinoffs: &quot;Viewtiful Joe: Red Hot Rumble&quot; for the PSP and GameCube and &quot;Viewtiful Joe: Double Trouble!&quot; for the Nintendo DS. An anime adaption of the game was produced by Group TAC, airing on the Japanese television station TV Tokyo beginning in 2004 and being licensed for US distribution by Geneon Entertainment in 2005. A set of &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; trading figures was released by Agatsuma Entertainment in October 2005, while a series of action figures made by Jazwares was released in July 2006. V Jump published a manga series of Viewtiful Joe from November 2004.

In 2004, Capcom registered the domain name ViewtifulJoe3.com, suggesting another sequel. Shortly thereafter, the website was devoid of content. In January 2006, Atsushi Inaba expressed interest in developing a title in the series for the Wii. However, as none of Clover Studio&#x27;s games proved to be an outstanding financial success, Capcom officially dissolved the subsidiary in March 2007 after the release of its final two games, &quot;Ōkami&quot; and &quot;God Hand&quot;. Its key members left to form a new company called PlatinumGames. Capcom producer Jun Takeuchi commented at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con that there have been currently no plans to continue with the series, although Viewtiful Joe has appeared as a playable character in Capcom&#x27;s 2008 Wii fighting game &quot;Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All Stars&quot; and is a playable character in &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds&quot; and &quot;Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3&quot; for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

However, in 2012, PlatinumGames announced the development of &quot;The Wonderful 101&quot;, then known as &quot;Project P-100&quot;. This was the first project that reunited Kamiya and Inaba as director and producer on a title since the development of the &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; series. Furthermore, &quot;The Wonderful 101&quot; uses the same tokusatsu thematics of the &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; series, and the two share a similar art style albeit different gameplay. This has led fans to hail &quot;The Wonderful 101&quot; as a spiritual successor of sorts. The franchise would also later be featured in Archie Comics&#x27; &quot;Worlds Unite&quot; crossover with several other Capcom and Sega series, taking place in the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; and &quot;Mega Man&quot; comics.

In &quot;Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition&quot;, the fighter Rashid has an outfit based on Viewtiful Joe. It is unlocked through completing four extra battles.
