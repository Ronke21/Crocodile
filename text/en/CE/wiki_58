<text>William Lawrence Shirer (; February 23, 1904 – December 28, 1993) was an American journalist, war correspondent, and historian. His &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot;, a history of Nazi Germany, has been read by many and cited in scholarly works for more than 60 years; its 50th anniversary was marked by a new edition of the book. 

As a young man just out of college, in 1925 Shirer was hired by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and later worked for the International News Service; he was the first reporter hired by Edward R. Murrow for what became a CBS radio team of journalists known as &quot;Murrow&#x27;s Boys&quot;. He became well-known for his broadcasts from Berlin, from the rise of the Nazi dictatorship through the first year of World War II. Together with Murrow, on Sunday, March 13, 1938, he organized the first broadcast world news roundup, a format still followed by news broadcasts.

Shirer published 14 books besides &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot;, including &quot;Berlin Diary&quot; (published in 1941), &quot;The Collapse of the Third Republic&quot; (1969), several novels, and a three-volume autobiography, &quot;20th Century Journey&quot; (1976 to 1990).

== Personal life ==

Shirer&#x27;s father was a Chicago lawyer, when he was born in 1904. His father died of peritonitis in 1913, when Shirer was 9 years old. The family moved to Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Shirer attended Washington High School and Coe College in Cedar Rapids. He graduated from Coe in 1925. He had to deliver newspapers and sell eggs to help the family finances. After leaving school he worked on the local newspaper, but ultimately was determined to leave Iowa. Working his way to Europe on a cattle boat with the intention of spending the summer, he remained there for fifteen years.

He was a European correspondent for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; from 1925 to 1932, covering Europe, the Near East and India. In India he formed a friendship with Mohandas Gandhi. Shirer lived and worked in Paris for several years starting in 1925. He left in the early 1930s but returned briefly to Paris in 1934 and then after Hitler&#x27;s establishment of the Third Reich worked as a correspondent in Berlin from 1934 to 1940.

In 1931, Shirer married Theresa (&quot;Tess&quot;) Stiberitz, an Austrian photographer. The couple had two daughters, Eileen (&quot;Inga&quot;) and Linda. Shirer and his wife divorced in 1970. In 1972 he married Martha Pelton, whom he divorced in 1975. His third and final marriage was to Irina Lugovskaya, a long-time teacher of Russian at Simon&#x27;s Rock College. Shirer and Irina had no children. 

Shirer was residing in Lenox, Massachusetts at the time of his death.

== Pre-war years ==

As a journalist, Shirer covered the strengthening one-party rule in Nazi Germany from August 1934, reporting on Adolf Hitler&#x27;s peacetime triumphs like the return of the Saarland to Germany and the remilitarization of the Rhineland.

Shirer at first worked for the Berlin bureau of Universal Service, one of William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s two wire services. In &quot;Berlin Diary&quot;, Shirer described this move as going from &quot;bad to Hearst&quot;. When Universal Service folded in August 1937, Shirer was first taken on as second man by Hearst&#x27;s other wire service, International News Service, then laid off a few weeks later.

On the day when Shirer received two weeks&#x27; notice from INS, he received a wire from Edward R. Murrow, European manager of Columbia Broadcasting System, suggesting that the two meet. A few days later in Berlin, as he recounts in &quot;The Nightmare Years,&quot; Murrow offered Shirer a job subject to an audition—a &quot;trial broadcast&quot;—to let CBS directors and vice presidents in New York judge Shirer&#x27;s voice. Shirer feared that his reedy voice was unsuitable for radio, but he was hired. As European bureau chief, he set up headquarters in Vienna, a more central and more neutral spot than Berlin. His job was to arrange broadcasts, and early in his career he expressed disappointment at having to hire newspaper correspondents to do the broadcasting; at the time, CBS correspondents were prohibited from speaking on the radio. Shirer was thus the first of &quot;Murrow&#x27;s Boys&quot;, broadcast journalists who provided news coverage during World War II and afterward.

CBS&#x27;s prohibition of correspondents talking on the radio, viewed by Murrow and Shirer as &quot;absurd&quot;, ended in March 1938. Shirer was in Vienna on March 11, 1938, when the German annexation of Austria (&quot;Anschluss&quot;) took place after weeks of mounting pressure by Nazi Germany on the Austrian government. As the only American broadcaster in Vienna (NBC rival Max Jordan was not in town), Shirer had a scoop but lacked the facilities to report it to his audience. Occupying German troops controlling the Austrian state radio studio would not let him broadcast. At Murrow&#x27;s suggestion, Shirer flew to London via Berlin; he recalled in &quot;Berlin Diary&quot; that the direct flight to London was filled with Jews trying to escape from German-occupied Austria. Once in London, Shirer broadcast the first uncensored eyewitness account of the annexation. Meanwhile, Murrow flew from London to Vienna to cover for Shirer.

The next day, CBS&#x27;s New York headquarters asked Shirer and Murrow to produce a European roundup, a 30-minute broadcast featuring live reporting from five European capitals: Berlin, Vienna, Paris, Rome, and London. The broadcast, arranged in eight hours using the telephone and broadcasting facilities of the day, was a major feat. This first news roundup established a formula still used in broadcast journalism. It was also the genesis of what became &quot;CBS World News Roundup,&quot; still on the network each morning and evening, network broadcasting&#x27;s oldest news series.

Shirer reported on the Munich Agreement and Hitler&#x27;s occupation of Czechoslovakia before reporting on the growing tensions between Germany and Poland in 1939 and the German invasion of Poland that launched World War II on September 1, 1939. During much of the pre-war period, Shirer was based in Berlin and attended Hitler&#x27;s speeches and several party rallies in Nuremberg.

== Reporting the war from Berlin ==
When war broke out on the Western Front in 1940, Shirer moved forward with the German troops, reporting firsthand on the German &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot;. Shirer reported on the invasion of Denmark and Norway in April from Berlin and then on the invasion of the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium, and France in May. As German armies closed in on Paris, he traveled to France with the German forces.

Shirer reported the signing of the German armistice with France on June 22, 1940, to the American people before it had been announced by the Germans. His commentary from Compiègne was hailed as a masterpiece. On the day before the armistice was to be signed, Hitler ordered all foreign correspondents covering the German Army from Paris to move back to Berlin. It was Hitler&#x27;s intention that the Armistice should be reported to the world by Nazi sources. Shirer avoided being returned to Berlin by leaving the press hotel early in the morning and hitching a ride to Compiègne with a German officer who despised Hitler. Once on site, Shirer was able to give an eye-witness account of that historical moment, &quot;I am but fifty yards from [Hitler]. […] I have seen that face many times at the great moments of his life. But today! It is afire with scorn, anger, hate, revenge, triumph.&quot; Then he followed proceedings inside the railway car (as formerly used at signing of the 1918 armistice which Hitler intended to use to further humiliate France in addition to the recent defeat), listening to the transmission relayed to Berlin through a German army communications truck. After the armistice was signed, Shirer was allowed to transmit his own broadcast to Berlin, but only for recording and release after the Nazi version had been disseminated. Shirer spent five minutes before he went on the air calling CBS radio in New York, hoping that the broadcast would get through. It did. When German engineers in Berlin heard Shirer calling New York, they assumed that he was authorized to broadcast. Instead of sending his report to a recording machine as ordered, they put it on the shortwave transmitter. When CBS heard Shirer&#x27;s call, transmission was put through live, thus for six hours Shirer&#x27;s report was the only news the world had of the Armistice.

In peacetime, Shirer&#x27;s reporting was subject only to self-censorship. He and other reporters in Germany knew that if Nazi officials in Joseph Goebbels&#x27; Propaganda Ministry objected to their reporting, they could withdraw access to state-owned broadcasting facilities or expel them from Germany. Shirer was granted more freedom than German reporters writing or broadcasting for domestic audiences. At the beginning of the war, German officials established censorship; Shirer recalled that the restrictions were similar to wartime censorship elsewhere, restricting information that could be used to Germany&#x27;s military disadvantage.

However, as the war continued and as Britain began to bomb German cities, including Berlin, Nazi censorship became more onerous to Shirer and his colleagues. In contrast to Murrow&#x27;s live broadcasts of German bombing of London in the Blitz, foreign correspondents in Germany were not allowed to report British air raids on German cities. They were not permitted to cast doubt on statements by the Propaganda Ministry and Military High Command. Reporters were discouraged by the Propaganda Ministry from reporting news or from using terms like &quot;Nazi&quot; that might &quot;create an unfavorable impression&quot;. Shirer resorted to subtler ways until the censors caught on.

As the summer of 1940 progressed, the Nazi government pressed Shirer to broadcast official accounts that he knew were incomplete or false. As his frustration grew, he wrote to bosses in New York that tightening censorship was undermining his ability to report objectively and mused that he had outlived his usefulness in Berlin. Shirer was subsequently tipped off that the Gestapo was building an espionage case against him, which carried the death penalty. Shirer began making arrangements to leave Germany, which he did in December 1940.

Shirer smuggled his diaries and notes out of Germany and used them for his &quot;Berlin Diary&quot;, a firsthand, day-by-day account of events in Nazi Germany during five years of peace and one year of war. It was published in 1941. Historians comparing the original manuscript diary with the published text discovered that Shirer made many changes. Like many others his early impressions of Hitler had been favourable, and revised later. Much of the text about the pre-1934 to 1938 period was first written long after the war began.

He returned to Europe to report on the Nuremberg trials in 1945.

== Post-war years ==

During the war Shirer became a director of the Society for the Prevention of World War III, which lobbied after the war for a harsh peace with Germany.

Shirer received a 1946 Peabody Award for Outstanding Reporting and Interpretation of News for his work at CBS.

The friendship between Shirer and Murrow ended in 1947, culminating in Shirer&#x27;s leaving CBS in one of the great confrontations of American broadcast journalism (below).

Shirer briefly provided analysis for the Mutual Broadcasting System and then found himself unable to find regular radio work. He was named in &quot;Red Channels&quot; (1950), which practically barred him from broadcasting and print journalism, and he was forced into lecturing for income. Times remained tough for Shirer, his wife Tess, and daughters Inga and Linda until in 1960 Simon &amp; Schuster published Shirer&#x27;s best-known work, &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot;. In the summer of 1958, when Shirer was &quot;flat broke&quot; and desperate for funds that would permit him to finish writing, at the recommendation of Hamilton Fish Armstrong Frank Altschul&#x27;s Overbrook Foundation advanced Shirer $5,000 ($52,500 in 2024 dollars) and promised another $5,000 six months later, enabling Shirer to finish his monumental tome. In the third volume of his autobiography, Shirer writes: &quot;This saved my life and my book.&quot; 

The book became a bestseller. The hardback was reprinted 20 times in the first year and sold more than 600,000 copies through the Book of the Month Club edition alone, and one million copies overall. Serialization of a condensed version in &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; and critical acclaim ensured its success in the US. Fawcett Crest gained paperback rights for $400,000 – a record for the time – and a further 1 million copies were sold at $1.65 (). It won the 1961 National Book Award for Nonfiction and Carey–Thomas Award for nonfiction.

== Shirer and Murrow ==

The dispute between Shirer and Murrow started in 1947 when J. B. Williams, a maker of shaving soap, withdrew sponsorship of Shirer&#x27;s Sunday news show. CBS, through Murrow, who was then vice president for public affairs, and CBS head William S. Paley, did not seek another sponsor, moved Shirer&#x27;s program to Sunday midday and then stopped producing it, all within a month. CBS maintained that Shirer resigned based on a comment made in an impromptu interview, but Shirer said he was essentially forced out: &quot;I had no intention of staying on with CBS so that Paley and Murrow could humiliate me further.&quot;

Shirer contended that the root of his troubles was that the network and sponsor did not stand by him because of his on-air comments, such as those critical of the Truman Doctrine, and what he viewed as an emphasis on placating sponsors rather than an emphasis on journalism. He also said that the sponsor (as well as others) had hinted that he was &quot;too liberal&quot; at a time when the Cold War was beginning.

Shirer blamed Murrow for his departure from CBS, referring to Murrow as &quot;Paley&#x27;s toady&quot;. He admitted to being &quot;puzzled&quot; as to why Murrow (and Paley) did not stand by him in this situation. Shirer believed there were possibly several factors: he had turned down an offer from Phil Wrigley (who was the largest single advertiser on CBS at the time) to broadcast in Chicago (which upset Paley), a subtle rivalry between Shirer and Murrow (that Shirer contends he never felt), and the fact Paley and Murrow blamed Shirer for the negative publicity that arose from Shirer&#x27;s leaving. CBS received thousands of letters and phone calls protesting the end of Shirer&#x27;s broadcasts. Tuesday after the broadcast announcing Shirer&#x27;s final show would be in a week, picketers appeared in front of the entrance to CBS. The episode hastened Murrow&#x27;s desire to give up his vice-presidency and return to newscasting. It foreshadowed his misgivings about the future of broadcast journalism and his difficulties with Paley.

The friendship between Shirer and Murrow never recovered. In her preface to &quot;This is Berlin&quot;, a compilation of Shirer&#x27;s Berlin broadcasts published after his death, Shirer&#x27;s daughter Inga describes how Murrow, suffering from lung cancer which he knew could be terminal, tried to heal the breach with Shirer by inviting the Shirers to his farm in 1964. Murrow tried to discuss the breach. Though the two chatted, Shirer steered the conversation away from contentious issues between the two men, and they never had another opportunity to speak before Murrow died in 1965. Shirer&#x27;s daughter also writes that, shortly before her father&#x27;s death in 1993, he rebuffed her attempts to learn the source of the breach that opened between the two journalists 45 years earlier. However, in &quot;The Nightmare Years&quot; (1984), the second volume in Shirer&#x27;s three-volume memoir, &quot;20th Century Journey&quot;, Shirer describes the birth and growth of a warm relationship with Murrow in the 1930s, emphasizing that he and Murrow were close friends as well as colleagues.

<text>A receiver operating characteristic curve, or ROC curve, is a graphical plot that illustrates the performance of a binary classifier model (can be used for multi class classification as well) at varying threshold values.

The ROC curve is the plot of the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at each threshold setting.

The ROC can also be thought of as a plot of the statistical power as a function of the Type I Error of the decision rule (when the performance is calculated from just a sample of the population, it can be thought of as estimators of these quantities). The ROC curve is thus the sensitivity as a function of false positive rate.

Given that the probability distributions for both true positive and false positive are known, the ROC curve is obtained as the cumulative distribution function (CDF, area under the probability distribution from formula_1 to the discrimination threshold) of the detection probability in the &quot;y&quot;-axis versus the CDF of the false positive probability on the &quot;x&quot;-axis.

ROC analysis provides tools to select possibly optimal models and to discard suboptimal ones independently from (and prior to specifying) the cost context or the class distribution. ROC analysis is related in a direct and natural way to the cost/benefit analysis of diagnostic decision making.

== Terminology ==

The true-positive rate is also known as sensitivity or &quot;probability of detection&quot;. The false-positive rate is also known as the &quot;probability of false alarm&quot; and equals (1 − specificity). 
The ROC is also known as a relative operating characteristic curve, because it is a comparison of two operating characteristics (TPR and FPR) as the criterion changes.

== History ==
The ROC curve was first developed by electrical engineers and radar engineers during World War II for detecting enemy objects in battlefields, starting in 1941, which led to its name (&quot;receiver operating characteristic&quot;).

It was soon introduced to psychology to account for the perceptual detection of stimuli. ROC analysis has been used in medicine, radiology, biometrics, forecasting of natural hazards, meteorology, model performance assessment, and other areas for many decades and is increasingly used in machine learning and data mining research.

==Basic concept==

A classification model (classifier or diagnosis) is a mapping of instances between certain classes/groups. Because the classifier or diagnosis result can be an arbitrary real value (continuous output), the classifier boundary between classes must be determined by a threshold value (for instance, to determine whether a person has hypertension based on a blood pressure measure). Or it can be a discrete class label, indicating one of the classes.

Consider a two-class prediction problem (binary classification), in which the outcomes are labeled either as positive (&quot;p&quot;) or negative (&quot;n&quot;). There are four possible outcomes from a binary classifier. If the outcome from a prediction is &quot;p&quot; and the actual value is also &quot;p&quot;, then it is called a &quot;true positive&quot; (TP); however if the actual value is &quot;n&quot; then it is said to be a &quot;false positive&quot; (FP). Conversely, a &quot;true negative&quot; (TN) has occurred when both the prediction outcome and the actual value are &quot;n&quot;, and a &quot;false negative&quot; (FN) is when the prediction outcome is &quot;n&quot; while the actual value is &quot;p&quot;.

To get an appropriate example in a real-world problem, consider a diagnostic test that seeks to determine whether a person has a certain disease. A false positive in this case occurs when the person tests positive, but does not actually have the disease. A false negative, on the other hand, occurs when the person tests negative, suggesting they are healthy, when they actually do have the disease.

Consider an experiment from P positive instances and N negative instances for some condition. The four outcomes can be formulated in a 2×2 &quot;contingency table&quot; or &quot;confusion matrix&quot;, as follows:


==ROC space==

The contingency table can derive several evaluation &quot;metrics&quot; (see infobox). To draw a ROC curve, only the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) are needed (as functions of some classifier parameter). The TPR defines how many correct positive results occur among all positive samples available during the test. FPR, on the other hand, defines how many incorrect positive results occur among all negative samples available during the test.

A ROC space is defined by FPR and TPR as &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; axes, respectively, which depicts relative trade-offs between true positive (benefits) and false positive (costs). Since TPR is equivalent to sensitivity and FPR is equal to 1 − specificity, the ROC graph is sometimes called the sensitivity vs (1 − specificity) plot. Each prediction result or instance of a confusion matrix represents one point in the ROC space.

The best possible prediction method would yield a point in the upper left corner or coordinate (0,1) of the ROC space, representing 100% sensitivity (no false negatives) and 100% specificity (no false positives). The (0,1) point is also called a &quot;perfect classification&quot;. A random guess would give a point along a diagonal line (the so-called &quot;line of no-discrimination&quot;) from the bottom left to the top right corners (regardless of the positive and negative base rates). An intuitive example of random guessing is a decision by flipping coins. As the size of the sample increases, a random classifier&#x27;s ROC point tends towards the diagonal line. In the case of a balanced coin, it will tend to the point (0.5, 0.5).

The diagonal divides the ROC space. Points above the diagonal represent good classification results (better than random); points below the line represent bad results (worse than random). Note that the output of a consistently bad predictor could simply be inverted to obtain a good predictor.

Consider four prediction results from 100 positive and 100 negative instances:

Plots of the four results above in the ROC space are given in the figure. The result of method A clearly shows the best predictive power among A, B, and C. The result of B lies on the random guess line (the diagonal line), and it can be seen in the table that the accuracy of B is 50%. However, when C is mirrored across the center point (0.5,0.5), the resulting method C′ is even better than A. This mirrored method simply reverses the predictions of whatever method or test produced the C contingency table. Although the original C method has negative predictive power, simply reversing its decisions leads to a new predictive method C′ which has positive predictive power. When the C method predicts p or n, the C′ method would predict n or p, respectively. In this manner, the C′ test would perform the best. The closer a result from a contingency table is to the upper left corner, the better it predicts, but the distance from the random guess line in either direction is the best indicator of how much predictive power a method has. If the result is below the line (i.e. the method is worse than a random guess), all of the method&#x27;s predictions must be reversed in order to utilize its power, thereby moving the result above the random guess line.

==Curves in ROC space==

In binary classification, the class prediction for each instance is often made based on a continuous random variable formula_2, which is a &quot;score&quot; computed for the instance (e.g. the estimated probability in logistic regression). Given a threshold parameter formula_3, the instance is classified as &quot;positive&quot; if formula_4, and &quot;negative&quot; otherwise. formula_2 follows a probability density formula_6 if the instance actually belongs to class &quot;positive&quot;, and formula_7 if otherwise. Therefore, the true positive rate is given by formula_8 and the false positive rate is given by formula_9. 
The ROC curve plots parametrically formula_10 versus formula_11 with formula_12 as the varying parameter.

For example, imagine that the blood protein levels in diseased people and healthy people are normally distributed with means of 2 g/dL and 1 g/dL respectively. A medical test might measure the level of a certain protein in a blood sample and classify any number above a certain threshold as indicating disease. The experimenter can adjust the threshold (green vertical line in the figure), which will in turn change the false positive rate. Increasing the threshold would result in fewer false positives (and more false negatives), corresponding to a leftward movement on the curve. The actual shape of the curve is determined by how much overlap the two distributions have.

==Criticisms==
Several studies criticize certain applications of the ROC curve and its area under the curve as measurements for assessing binary classifications when they do not capture the information relevant to the application.

The main criticism to the ROC curve described in these studies regards the incorporation of areas with low sensitivity and low specificity (both lower than 0.5) for the calculation of the total area under the curve (AUC)., as described in the plot on the right.

According to the authors of these studies, that portion of area under the curve (with low sensitivity and low specificity) regards confusion matrices where binary predictions obtain bad results, and therefore should not be included for the assessment of the overall performance.
Moreover, that portion of AUC indicates a space with high or low confusion matrix threshold which is rarely of interest for scientists performing a binary classification in any field.

Another criticism to the ROC and its area under the curve is that they say nothing about precision and negative predictive value.

A high ROC AUC, such as 0.9 for example, might correspond to low values of precision and negative predictive value, such as 0.2 and 0.1 in the [0, 1] range.
If one performed a binary classification, obtained an ROC AUC of 0.9 and decided to focus only on this metric, they might overoptimistically believe their binary test was excellent. However, if this person took a look at the values of precision and negative predictive value, they might discover their values are low.

The ROC AUC summarizes sensitivity and specificity, but does not inform regarding precision and negative predictive value.

==Further interpretations==

Sometimes, the ROC is used to generate a summary statistic. Common versions are:
* the intercept of the ROC curve with the line at 45 degrees orthogonal to the no-discrimination line - the balance point where Sensitivity = Specificity 
* the intercept of the ROC curve with the tangent at 45 degrees parallel to the no-discrimination line that is closest to the error-free point (0,1) – also called Youden&#x27;s J statistic and generalized as Informedness
* the area between the ROC curve and the no-discrimination line multiplied by two is called the &quot;Gini coefficient&quot;, especially in the context of credit scoring. It should not be confused with the measure of statistical dispersion also called Gini coefficient.
* the area between the full ROC curve and the triangular ROC curve including only (0,0), (1,1) and one selected operating point formula_13 – Consistency
* the area under the ROC curve, or &quot;AUC&quot; (&quot;area under curve&quot;), or A&#x27; (pronounced &quot;a-prime&quot;), or &quot;c-statistic&quot; (&quot;concordance statistic&quot;).
* the sensitivity index &quot;d′&quot; (pronounced &quot;d-prime&quot;), the distance between the mean of the distribution of activity in the system under noise-alone conditions and its distribution under signal-alone conditions, divided by their standard deviation, under the assumption that both these distributions are normal with the same standard deviation. Under these assumptions, the shape of the ROC is entirely determined by &quot;d′&quot;.

However, any attempt to summarize the ROC curve into a single number loses information about the pattern of tradeoffs of the particular discriminator algorithm.

===Probabilistic interpretation===
The area under the curve (often referred to as simply the AUC) is equal to the probability that a classifier will rank a randomly chosen positive instance higher than a randomly chosen negative one (assuming &#x27;positive&#x27; ranks higher than &#x27;negative&#x27;). In other words, when given one randomly selected positive instance and one randomly selected negative instance, AUC is the probability that the classifier will be able to tell which one is which.

This can be seen as follows: the area under the curve is given by (the integral boundaries are reversed as large threshold formula_3 has a lower value on the &quot;x&quot;-axis)
:formula_15
:formula_16
:formula_17
where formula_18 is the score for a positive instance and formula_19 is the score for a negative instance, and formula_20 and formula_21 are probability densities as defined in previous section.

If formula_19 and formula_18 follows two Gaussian distributions, then formula_24.
===Area under the curve===
It can be shown that the AUC is closely related to the Mann–Whitney U, which tests whether positives are ranked higher than negatives. For a predictor formula_25, an unbiased estimator of its AUC can be expressed by the following &quot;Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney&quot; statistic:

: formula_26

where formula_27 denotes an &quot;indicator function&quot; which returns 1 if formula_28 otherwise return 0; formula_29 is the set of negative examples, and formula_30 is the set of positive examples.

In the context of credit scoring, a rescaled version of AUC is often used:

formula_31.

formula_32 is referred to as Gini index or Gini coefficient, but it should not be confused with the measure of statistical dispersion that is also called Gini coefficient. formula_32 is a special case of Somers&#x27; D.

It is also common to calculate the Area Under the ROC Convex Hull (ROC AUCH = ROCH AUC) as any point on the line segment between two prediction results can be achieved by randomly using one or the other system with probabilities proportional to the relative length of the opposite component of the segment. It is also possible to invert concavities – just as in the figure the worse solution can be reflected to become a better solution; concavities can be reflected in any line segment, but this more extreme form of fusion is much more likely to overfit the data.

The machine learning community most often uses the ROC AUC statistic for model comparison. This practice has been questioned because AUC estimates are quite noisy and suffer from other problems. Nonetheless, the coherence of AUC as a measure of aggregated classification performance has been vindicated, in terms of a uniform rate distribution, and AUC has been linked to a number of other performance metrics such as the Brier score.

Another problem with ROC AUC is that reducing the ROC Curve to a single number ignores the fact that it is about the tradeoffs between the different systems or performance points plotted and not the performance of an individual system, as well as ignoring the possibility of concavity repair, so that related alternative measures such as Informedness or DeltaP are recommended. These measures are essentially equivalent to the Gini for a single prediction point with DeltaP&#x27; = Informedness = 2AUC-1, whilst DeltaP = Markedness represents the dual (viz. predicting the prediction from the real class) and their geometric mean is the Matthews correlation coefficient.

Whereas ROC AUC varies between 0 and 1 — with an uninformative classifier yielding 0.5 — the alternative measures known as Informedness, Certainty and Gini Coefficient (in the single parameterization or single system case) all have the advantage that 0 represents chance performance whilst 1 represents perfect performance, and −1 represents the &quot;perverse&quot; case of full informedness always giving the wrong response. Bringing chance performance to 0 allows these alternative scales to be interpreted as Kappa statistics. Informedness has been shown to have desirable characteristics for Machine Learning versus other common definitions of Kappa such as Cohen Kappa and Fleiss Kappa.

Sometimes it can be more useful to look at a specific region of the ROC Curve rather than at the whole curve. It is possible to compute partial AUC. For example, one could focus on the region of the curve with low false positive rate, which is often of prime interest for population screening tests. Another common approach for classification problems in which P ≪ N (common in bioinformatics applications) is to use a logarithmic scale for the &quot;x&quot;-axis.

The ROC area under the curve is also called c-statistic or c statistic.

===Other measures===

The Total Operating Characteristic (TOC) also characterizes diagnostic ability while revealing more information than the ROC. For each threshold, ROC reveals two ratios, TP/(TP + FN) and FP/(FP + TN). In other words, ROC reveals formula_34 and formula_35. On the other hand, TOC shows the total information in the contingency table for each threshold. The TOC method reveals all of the information that the ROC method provides, plus additional important information that ROC does not reveal, i.e. the size of every entry in the contingency table for each threshold. TOC also provides the popular AUC of the ROC.

These figures are the TOC and ROC curves using the same data and thresholds.
Consider the point that corresponds to a threshold of 74. The TOC curve shows the number of hits, which is 3, and hence the number of misses, which is 7. Additionally, the TOC curve shows that the number of false alarms is 4 and the number of correct rejections is 16. At any given point in the ROC curve, it is possible to glean values for the ratios of formula_35 and formula_34. For example, at threshold 74, it is evident that the x coordinate is 0.2 and the y coordinate is 0.3. However, these two values are insufficient to construct all entries of the underlying two-by-two contingency table.
==Detection error tradeoff graph==

An alternative to the ROC curve is the detection error tradeoff (DET) graph, which plots the false negative rate (missed detections) vs. the false positive rate (false alarms) on non-linearly transformed x- and y-axes. The transformation function is the quantile function of the normal distribution, i.e., the inverse of the cumulative normal distribution. It is, in fact, the same transformation as zROC, below, except that the complement of the hit rate, the miss rate or false negative rate, is used. This alternative spends more graph area on the region of interest. Most of the ROC area is of little interest; one primarily cares about the region tight against the &quot;y&quot;-axis and the top left corner – which, because of using miss rate instead of its complement, the hit rate, is the lower left corner in a DET plot. Furthermore, DET graphs have the useful property of linearity and a linear threshold behavior for normal distributions. The DET plot is used extensively in the automatic speaker recognition community, where the name DET was first used. The analysis of the ROC performance in graphs with this warping of the axes was used by psychologists in perception studies halfway through the 20th century, where this was dubbed &quot;double probability paper&quot;.

==Z-score==

If a standard score is applied to the ROC curve, the curve will be transformed into a straight line. This z-score is based on a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. In memory strength theory, one must assume that the zROC is not only linear, but has a slope of 1.0. The normal distributions of targets (studied objects that the subjects need to recall) and lures (non studied objects that the subjects attempt to recall) is the factor causing the zROC to be linear.

The linearity of the zROC curve depends on the standard deviations of the target and lure strength distributions. If the standard deviations are equal, the slope will be 1.0. If the standard deviation of the target strength distribution is larger than the standard deviation of the lure strength distribution, then the slope will be smaller than 1.0. In most studies, it has been found that the zROC curve slopes constantly fall below 1, usually between 0.5 and 0.9. Many experiments yielded a zROC slope of 0.8. A slope of 0.8 implies that the variability of the target strength distribution is 25% larger than the variability of the lure strength distribution.

Another variable used is &quot;d&#x27;&quot; (d prime) (discussed above in &quot;Other measures&quot;), which can easily be expressed in terms of z-values. Although &quot;d&quot;&#x27; is a commonly used parameter, it must be recognized that it is only relevant when strictly adhering to the very strong assumptions of strength theory made above.

The z-score of an ROC curve is always linear, as assumed, except in special situations. The Yonelinas familiarity-recollection model is a two-dimensional account of recognition memory. Instead of the subject simply answering yes or no to a specific input, the subject gives the input a feeling of familiarity, which operates like the original ROC curve. What changes, though, is a parameter for Recollection (R). Recollection is assumed to be all-or-none, and it trumps familiarity. If there were no recollection component, zROC would have a predicted slope of 1. However, when adding the recollection component, the zROC curve will be concave up, with a decreased slope. This difference in shape and slope result from an added element of variability due to some items being recollected. Patients with anterograde amnesia are unable to recollect, so their Yonelinas zROC curve would have a slope close to 1.0.

==History==
The ROC curve was first used during World War II for the analysis of radar signals before it was employed in signal detection theory. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the United States military began new research to increase the prediction of correctly detected Japanese aircraft from their radar signals. For these purposes they measured the ability of a radar receiver operator to make these important distinctions, which was called the Receiver Operating Characteristic.

In the 1950s, ROC curves were employed in psychophysics to assess human (and occasionally non-human animal) detection of weak signals. In medicine, ROC analysis has been extensively used in the evaluation of diagnostic tests. ROC curves are also used extensively in epidemiology and medical research and are frequently mentioned in conjunction with evidence-based medicine. In radiology, ROC analysis is a common technique to evaluate new radiology techniques. In the social sciences, ROC analysis is often called the ROC Accuracy Ratio, a common technique for judging the accuracy of default probability models.
ROC curves are widely used in laboratory medicine to assess the diagnostic accuracy of a test, to choose the optimal cut-off of a test and to compare diagnostic accuracy of several tests.

ROC curves also proved useful for the evaluation of machine learning techniques. The first application of ROC in machine learning was by Spackman who demonstrated the value of ROC curves in comparing and evaluating different classification algorithms.

ROC curves are also used in verification of forecasts in meteorology.

=== Radar in detail ===
As mentioned ROC curves are critical to radar operation and theory. The signals received at a receiver station, as reflected by a target, are often of very low energy, in comparison to the noise floor. The ratio of signal to noise is an important metric when determining if a target will be detected. This signal to noise ratio is directly correlated to the receiver operating characteristics of the whole radar system, which is used to quantify the ability of a radar system.

Consider the development of a radar system. A specification for the abilities of the system may be provided in terms of probability of detect, formula_38, with a certain tolerance for false alarms, formula_39. A simplified approximation of the required signal to noise ratio at the receiver station can be calculated by solving

: formula_40

for the signal to noise ratio formula_41. Here, formula_41 is not in decibels, as is common in many radar applications. Conversion to decibels is through formula_43. From this figure, the common entries in the radar range equation (with noise factors) may be solved, to estimate the required effective radiated power.

==ROC curves beyond binary classification==
The extension of ROC curves for classification problems with more than two classes is cumbersome. Two common approaches for when there are multiple classes are (1) average over all pairwise AUC values and (2) compute the volume under surface (VUS). To average over all pairwise classes, one computes the AUC for each pair of classes, using only the examples from those two classes as if there were no other classes, and then averages these AUC values over all possible pairs. When there are classes there will be possible pairs of classes.

The volume under surface approach has one plot a hypersurface rather than a curve and then measure the hypervolume under that hypersurface. Every possible decision rule that one might use for a classifier for classes can be described in terms of its true positive rates . It is this set of rates that defines a point, and the set of all possible decision rules yields a cloud of points that define the hypersurface. With this definition, the VUS is the probability that the classifier will be able to correctly label all examples when it is given a set that has one randomly selected example from each class. The implementation of a classifier that knows that its input set consists of one example from each class might first compute a goodness-of-fit score for each of the possible pairings of an example to a class, and then employ the Hungarian algorithm to maximize the sum of the selected scores over all possible ways to assign exactly one example to each class.

Given the success of ROC curves for the assessment of classification models, the extension of ROC curves for other supervised tasks has also been investigated. Notable proposals for regression problems are the so-called regression error characteristic (REC) Curves and the Regression ROC (RROC) curves. In the latter, RROC curves become extremely similar to ROC curves for classification, with the notions of asymmetry, dominance and convex hull. Also, the area under RROC curves is proportional to the error variance of the regression model.

<doc id="922511" wikidata="Q993277" url="?curid=922511" title="Bruno Gerussi">
<text>Bruno Santos Gerussi (7 May 1928 – 21 November 1995) was a Canadian stage and television actor, best known for the lead role in the CBC Television series &quot;The Beachcombers&quot; from 1972 to 1990. He also performed onstage at the Stratford Festival, worked in radio, and hosted &quot;Celebrity Cooks&quot;, a daily cooking/variety show, on CBC from 1975 to 1979 then on the Global Television Network from 1980 to 1987.

==Early life and education==
Gerussi was born in Medicine Hat, Alberta, as the eldest son of Enrico Gerussi, a coal miner working in Lethbridge, who had trained in Italy as a stonemason, and his wife Teresina Lazzorotto. The two married in 1927 and moved to Medicine Hat. The family subsequently moved to Exshaw, where Enrico worked as a sectionman on the Canadian Pacific Railway.

Bruno Gerussi grew up in Exshaw and later moved with his family to New Westminster, British Columbia. He attended the Banff School of Fine Arts on a scholarship. Bruno was just 22 when his father committed suicide by hanging himself in the woods behind the provincial mental hospital at Essondale.

==Early career==
Gerussi began acting in high school in New Westminster, British Columbia, when he played the lead in a school production of &quot;The Valiant&quot;. He won a scholarship to the Banff School of Fine Arts and, after graduating, joined the Seattle Reparatory Theatre. In 1949, he returned to Vancouver where he played Stanley Kowalski in Totem Theatre&#x27;s production of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; and co-starred with Lon Chaney, Jr. in &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;.

In 1954, Gerussi joined the Stratford Festival in its second season. During the next few years he went on to act in many stage productions in Canada and the United States, including performing the role of Feste in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, which he later reprised on CBC Television in 1964, and as Romeo opposite Julie Harris in the Stratford Festival&#x27;s first production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; in 1960.

His wife Ida died in 1965. As a single parent raising two children, Gerussi was less able to travel for work and so he joined CHIN radio as its morning man hosting &quot;Gerussi, Words and Music&quot; for four hours a day from 6 to 10 AM. After the show began in January 1967, the &quot;Toronto Daily Star&quot;&#x27;s Barbara Frum reported that the show had no listeners for the first two-and-a-half hours of its premiere. The show became popular, however, and in the fall of 1967, CBC Radio gave him a national daily morning show, &quot;Gerussi!&quot;, which aired until 1971 and became the model for the network&#x27;s &quot;This Country in the Morning&quot; and &quot;Morningside&quot; in the 1970s and 1980s.

==&quot;The Beachcombers&quot; years==
Gerussi&#x27;s best-known role arrived in 1972, when he was signed to play Nick Adonidas in &quot;The Beachcombers&quot;, a comedy-adventure-drama created by Marc and Susan Strange and set on the west coast of Canada. &quot;The Beachcombers&quot; ran for 387 episodes between 1972 and 1990 and remains Canada&#x27;s longest-running weekly dramatic series.

During part of his time with &quot;The Beachcombers&quot;, Gerussi hosted the CBC cooking program &quot;Celebrity Cooks&quot; in the late 1970s and most of the 1980s. The series filmed for 12 seasons, with a Monday-to-Friday time slot for most of those years and Gerussi hosted 478 episodes before the show&#x27;s last season in production, 1987. The &quot;Celebrity Cooks&quot; episode featured the last public appearance of actor Bob Crane of &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; fame, who was murdered soon afterwards. The taping of Crane&#x27;s episode was dramatized in the 2002 film &quot;Auto Focus&quot;, in which actor John Kapelos portrayed Gerussi.

Gerussi&#x27;s appearances in &quot;Celebrity Cooks&quot; led him to become commercial spokesperson for a line of microwave ovens in the late-1970s/early-1980s. He appeared in commercials for a variety of food products.

He was the host of the first Genie Awards broadcast in 1980.

==After &quot;The Beachcombers&quot;==
On 21 November 1995, Bruno Gerussi died of a heart attack in Vancouver at the home of his companion, Judge Nancy Morrison.

The TV movie &quot;The New Beachcombers&quot; (2002), was dedicated in his memory. A new series was broadcast from 2002 to 2004.

==Awards and recognition==
Gerussi received a Gemini Award nomination for &quot;Best Performance by a Lead Actor in a Continuing Dramatic Role&quot; in 1990 for the final season of &quot;The Beachcombers&quot;.

He won the Geminis&#x27; Earle Grey Award posthumously for lifetime achievement in 1996. His children Rico and Tina accepted it on his behalf.

==Personal life==
Gerussi was married to Ida Edith Trento Gerussi. After she died in 1965, he left Stratford and raised their two children, then 13 and 10 years old, as a single parent. 

Both of Gerussi&#x27;s children went on to work in film and television. His daughter, Tina Gerussi, is a casting director. His son, Rico Gerussi, is an assistant director as well as a lead guitarist/vocalist in R&amp;B band The Raging Butanes in Toronto. He died at the age of 67 of an apparent heart attack.

<doc id="922515" wikidata="Q4932832" url="?curid=922515" title="Bob Homme">
<text>Robert Mandt Homme, [[Order of Canada|C.M.]] ( ; March 8, 1919 – May 2, 2000) was an American-Canadian television actor. Homme was best known as the host of &quot;The Friendly Giant&quot;, a popular children&#x27;s television program that aired from the 1950s through the 1980s and was broadcast on CBC Television.

==Background==
Homme was born in Stoughton, Wisconsin into a Norwegian family. His parents were high school woodworking teachers, Raymond and Roselyn Homme. He attended elementary school at West Side School before attending Stoughton High School where he graduated in 1937. He enrolled at the University of Wisconsin and graduated with a major in economics. He worked at a bank before joining the Air National Guard. His unit was activated in June 1941, prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor. He was soon promoted to Staff Sergeant, a rank he held for the duration of the war. One of his military assignments was to study psychology at Cornell University. He was later sent to study again at the University of Wisconsin. He finished the war processing and classifying discharging servicemen. Among the notable people he discharged was the actor and director, Captain John Huston.

Following graduation, Homme took a job with the University of Wisconsin State Radio Station WHA.

Homme was married to Esther Eleanor Anderson and had four children: Richard, Ann, Ruth and Peter. Richard was a Toronto-based jazz bassist who died on May 6, 2011.

Singer and voice actress Emilie-Claire Barlow is Homme&#x27;s stepgranddaughter.

==Career==
===&quot;The Friendly Giant&quot;===

While working at WHA radio, Homme regularly drove from Madison to Chicago to watch rehearsals of a pioneering network television variety show called &quot;The Dave Garroway Show&quot;. From these trips, Bob developed an interest in programming. In 1953 as he was driving back from Chicago to Madison, he imagined creating a children&#x27;s program. His wife Esther came up with the idea of a &quot;friendly giant.&quot; Bob recognized that taking what is usually associated with a scary character and making it nice makes it doubly nice. A friendly giant, therefore, becomes an even more friendly giant when compared to the Jack and the Beanstalk variety giant. Homme approached the program director of WHA radio, which was in the process of developing a television station. While continuing to work full-time on radio, he began developing the new children&#x27;s television show.

&quot;The Friendly Giant&quot; began on WHA-TV in Madison on May 8, 1954. National Educational Television carried it in the United States from 1955 to 1968. Kinescopes of early episodes caught the attention of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and production of the program moved to CBC Television&#x27;s Toronto studios in 1958. CBC produced and aired &quot;The Friendly Giant&quot; until 1986, and it was later run in syndication on Canada&#x27;s YTV.

The show was outlined but was never scripted. Homme&#x27;s style was minimalist. He recognized that television was a &quot;hot medium&quot; that tends to exaggerate actions and dialogue. Consistent with his personality, he tended to underplay his performances. This was in contrast to other high-energy early television programs such as &quot;Howdy Doody&quot;. Bob and his puppeteer partner (originally Ken Ohst in Wisconsin and then Rod Coneybeare in Canada) used the comfortable repartee of old radio programs Bob had enjoyed like &quot;Vic and Sade&quot;, &quot;Burns and Allen&quot;, &quot;Bob and Ray&quot;, and the &quot;Easy Aces&quot;.

====Television production innovation====
One of his television production innovations was to change the perspective of the camera. Instead of the usual camera angles, he had the miniatures raised to camera height and placed the human being (himself) as the unusual shot above the set, giving the impression of a giant. Using a tight cover-shot and a loose close-up might have violated the newly established rules of television, but in this case it worked. It contrasts with the &quot;Godzilla&quot; effect in which a full-size monster walks around a miniature set. Homme always kept the giant character somewhere in the shot to emotionally reassure his preschool audience and to minimize the jarring effect of appearing suddenly.

===Music===
Growing up in a musical family, they enjoyed singing together and performing for the extended family each other on a Saturday night. Young Homme and his father had a little vaudeville act that was available when needed in the community. He later joined the school band at the University of Wisconsin. While Bob is best known for playing the recorder, his first instruments were the clarinet and the saxophone. He first purchased a recorder while stationed in New York City during his military service to give him an inexpensive and portable instrument during his travels. The recorder would become his signature instrument. On each episode of the show, he played three different recorders to match the pitch of each to the desired tone at that stage of the show.

===Other===

Bob Homme was the model in a number of paintings by his friend and Canadian artist, James Lumbers. Lumbers&#x27; &quot;Moments in Time&quot; paintings often featured images from the present together with a faded image of a person and things from the past at the same location. Homme&#x27;s likeness was used in the images of grandfather types in these paintings such as &quot;Lucky Strike&quot; and &quot;Gone Fishing.&quot; The Springer spaniel in &quot;Old Friends&quot; was the Homme&#x27;s dog, Molly. In one painting of a honky-tonk piano player called &quot;Billy Nine Fingers,&quot; Bob and Esther are one of the couples sitting at a table in the foreground.

==Later life and retirement==
Homme became a citizen of Canada in the early 1990s, holding both American and Canadian citizenships, and was invested into the Order of Canada as a Member on November 2, 1998, in Grafton, Ontario. (As Homme was too ill to travel, the Governor General Roméo LeBlanc travelled to Grafton to present it, instead of Homme going to Rideau Hall where the award is usually bestowed).

Bob and Esther Homme retired to a rural property near Grafton, Ontario. In retirement, Bob joined the Cobourg Rotary Club and was active as a member. He and fellow Rotarian Wally Reid formed a group called &quot;Time Share&quot;, performing music in area retirement and nursing homes.

==Death==
Homme died on May 2, 2000, of prostate cancer. He was 81 years old. He is buried at the Fairview Cemetery, Grafton, Northumberland, Ontario, Canada.

<text>The patriarchs ( &quot;ʾAvot&quot;, &quot;fathers&quot;) of the Bible, when narrowly defined, are Abraham, his son Isaac, and Isaac&#x27;s son Jacob, also named Israel, the ancestor of the Israelites. These three figures are referred to collectively as &quot;the patriarchs&quot;, and the period in which they lived is known as the patriarchal age.

Judaism, Christianity, and Islam hold that the patriarchs, along with their primary wives, known as the matriarchs (Sarah, Rebekah and Leah), are entombed at the Cave of the Patriarchs, a site held holy by the three religions. Rachel, Jacob&#x27;s other wife, is said to be buried separately at what is known as Rachel&#x27;s Tomb, near Bethlehem, at the site where she is believed to have died in childbirth.

More widely, the term patriarchs can be used to refer to the twenty male ancestor-figures between Adam and Abraham. The first ten of these are called the antediluvian patriarchs, because they came before the Flood.

Most scholars view the patriarchal age as a late literary construct that does not relate to any particular historical era, and after a century of exhaustive archaeological investigation, no evidence has been found for the partiarchs.

==Definition==
The patriarchs of the Bible, when narrowly defined, are Abraham, his son Isaac, and Isaac&#x27;s son Jacob, also named Israel, the ancestor of the Israelites. These three figures are referred to collectively as the patriarchs, and the period in which they lived is known as the patriarchal age. They play significant roles in Hebrew scripture during and following their lifetimes. They are used as a significant marker by God in revelations and promises, and continue to play important roles in the Abrahamic faiths. Judaism, Christianity and Islam hold that the patriarchs, along with their primary wives, known as the matriarchs – Sarah (wife of Abraham), Rebekah (wife of Isaac) and Leah (one of the wives of Jacob) – are entombed at the Cave of Machpelah in Hebron, a site held holy by the three religions. Rachel is said to be buried separately at what is known as Rachel&#x27;s Tomb, near Bethlehem, at the site where she is believed to have died in childbirth.

More widely, the term patriarchs can be used to refer to the twenty male ancestor-figures between Adam and Abraham. The first ten of these are called the antediluvian patriarchs, because they came before the Flood.

==Lifespans==
The lifetimes given for the patriarchs in the Masoretic Text of the Book of Genesis are: Adam 930 years, Seth 912, Enos 905, Kenan 910, Mahalalel 895, Jared 962, Enoch 365 (did not die, but was taken away by God), Methuselah 969, Lamech 777, Noah 950. Gerhard von Rad said:

==Matriarchs==
The matriarchs, also known as &quot;the four mothers&quot; (ארבע האמהות), are:

* Sarah, the wife of Abraham
* Rebekah, the wife of Isaac
* Leah and Rachel, the wives of Jacob
* Secondary matriarchs: Some Jewish sources list Bilhah and Zilpah (Jacob&#x27;s concubines) as additional matriarchs, for a total of six matriarchs. Other sources also include an emphasis on Tamar (the daughter-in-law of Judah) and Asenath (Osnat) (the wife of Joseph).

<doc id="922525" wikidata="Q7346837" url="?curid=922525" title="Robert Leighton (bishop)">
<text>Robert Leighton (1611 – 25 June 1684) was a Scottish prelate and scholar, best known as a church minister, Bishop of Dunblane, Archbishop of Glasgow, and Principal of the University of Edinburgh from 1653 to 1662. He was &quot;noted for his Christian piety, his humility and gentleness, and his devotion to his calling&quot;.

==Early life==
Leighton lived through one of the most turbulent periods in Scottish history. His grandfather was a Pre-Reformation Catholic; his father, Doctor Alexander Leighton, was tortured during the reign of King Charles I for his Presbyterian beliefs after authoring a pamphlet, &quot;Zion&#x27;s Plea against Prelacy&quot;, in which he criticised the church, condemning bishops as &quot;anti-christian and satanic&quot;. Robert became an archbishop during one of the periods when the Church of Scotland was episcopal.

Robert Leighton was born in London to Scottish parents in 1611. Robert Leighton&#x27;s mother was Alexander Leighton&#x27;s first wife. According to Gilbert Burnet, Leighton was distinguished for his &quot;saintly disposition&quot; from his earliest childhood, despite the persecution of his family. In 1627 (before his father published his pamphlet) at the age of sixteen, Robert Leighton went to study at the University of Edinburgh, graduating with an MA in 1631.

Following his graduation, his father sent him to travel abroad, and he is understood to have spent several years in France, where he acquired a complete mastery of the French language. While there he passed a good deal of time with relatives at Douai who had become Roman Catholics, and with whom he kept up a correspondence for many years afterward. Either at this time or on some subsequent visit he had also a good deal of intercourse with members of the Jansenist party. This intercourse contributed to the charity towards those who differed from him in religious opinion which ever afterward formed a feature in his character.

==Church career==
Having returned to Scotland, at the age of thirty, Leighton was ordained as a Minister in the Church of Scotland on 16 December 1641. The ordination took place at Newbattle in Midlothian and thirty-year-old Leighton was installed as Parish Minister of Newbattle on the same date. Following the furore over his father&#x27;s actions, it took a while before Leighton was accepted as Minister. Parish records show that he had to deliver five trial sermons – two of which had to be delivered on the same day – before being accepted:
:&quot;On the 16th of December, decreed as a whilk day for the appointment of Mr Robert Lichtoune, a sermon was delivered by John Knox, based on Hebrews 13 Verse 17. After his sermon, Mr John Knox put to Robert Lichtoune and the parishioners, sundry questions competent to ye occasion and after the imposition of hands and ye solemne prayer, was admitted minister of Newbattle&quot; (Session Records)

Leighton signed the Solemn League and Covenant in 1643. Leighton served at Newbattle for eleven years, before resigning his charge in 1652. What led him to take this step is not immediately clear, though the account given is that he had little sympathy with the fiery zeal of his brother clergymen on certain political questions, and that this led to severe censures on their part.

==University of Edinburgh==
Early in 1653, Leighton was appointed principal of the University of Edinburgh, and primarius professor of divinity. The position was originally supposed to be filled by William Colvill, but Colvill was unable to take possession of it, since he was in the Netherlands and so the position was declared vacant again, and Leighton appointed in Colvill&#x27;s place. Leighton continued in this post until 1662, when he was succeeded by Colvill, who had since returned to Scotland.

A considerable number of his Latin prelections and other addresses (published after his death) are remarkable for the purity and elegance of their Latinity, and their subdued and meditative eloquence. They are valuable instructions in the art of living a holy life rather than a body of scientific divinity. Throughout, however, they bear the marks of a deeply learned and accomplished mind, saturated with both classical and patristic reading, and like all his works they breathe the spirit of one who lived very much above the world.

While at the university and afterwards he wrote commentaries on New Testament books and his theological and expository lectures were also published, notably &quot;An Exposition of the Creed, Lord&#x27;s prayer and Ten Commandments&quot;, &quot;Rules and Instructions for a Holy Life&quot; and &quot;A Modest Defence of Moderate Episcopacy&quot;.

==Bishop and Archbishop==
Although an ordained Presbyterian minister, in 1661 Leighton allowed himself to be appointed Bishop by King Charles II. Aware that he might be accused of seeking self-aggrandisement, he requested the post in Dunblane, the smallest and poorest see in the country. He sought to reconcile Presbyterians and Episcopalians in a United Church of Scotland, but his mild-mannered nature gave him problems in this role, Bishop Leighton suggested a system of ecclesiastical government in which the bishops were guided by the majority view of their presbyters but this found no favour with the other bishops. He attempted to resign in 1665, making a trip to London for that purpose, but did not go through with this after King Charles II agreed to milder measures. He repeated his trip to London again in 1669, but little result followed.

In 1670, he hesitantly agreed to accept appointment as Archbishop of Glasgow. In this higher sphere he redoubled his efforts with the Presbyterians to bring about some degree of conciliation with Episcopacy, but the only result was to embroil himself with the hot-headed Episcopal party as well as with the Presbyterians.

He resigned the archbishopric in 1674.

==Religious views==
Leighton saw good and bad in both the Episcopal and the English Puritan forms of worship. The Puritan Party gained such popularity that Leighton retired from the Ministry at Newbattle, citing the introduction of the Cromwellian ideas as to doctrine and ritual, as his main reason. Scotland&#x27;s &quot;Apostle of Peace&quot;, as he became known, took up the post at Edinburgh University as principal for a period of 8 years, before being summoned to London, by Charles II, to be one of four bishops appointed to look after the King&#x27;s Northern realm in the Westminster Way, hence his term at Dunblane as bishop and subsequently at Glasgow as archbishop.

==Later life==

After leaving his position as archbishop in 1674, Leighton retired to the mansion of his widowed sister Sapphira (Mrs Edward Lightmaker), and her son, at Broadhurst near Horsted Keynes in Sussex.

Leighton died suddenly on 25 June 1684 during a trip to London, in an inn in the shadow of a partly finished St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. His final parting wish was that &quot;At eventide there might be light&quot;.

Leighton was buried in Horsted Keynes. In his will, he bequeathed his collection of 1,400 volumes and a hundred pounds for the erection of the Leighton Library. He also gave instruction that all his personal papers and manuscripts be destroyed, though this never took place.

Following his death, a commentary of his on 1 Peter, was published in two volumes in 1693 and 1694, and has rarely been out of print ever since.

==Family==
Leighton never married, and had no children.

Father: Alexander Leighton&lt;br&gt;
Mother: Unknown (Alexander&#x27;s first wife)
:Brother: Elisha Leighton (???–1684) (later Sir Ellis Leighton) who was secretary to John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton when he was Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland in 1670 and British Ambassador to France in 1675.
:Sister: Sapphira (later Mrs Edward Lightmaker) (1623–1704)
:Other siblings who did not survive to maturity: James, Caleb, Elizabeth. However it is possible that Elizabeth &quot;did&quot; survive to maturity, as Leighton mentioned his mother and sisters (as opposed to sister) in some correspondence to his brother-in-law, Mr Edward Lightmaker (year unknown):
::&quot;My mother writes to me and presses my coming up. I know not yet if that can be. But I intend, God willing, so soon as I can conveniently ... Remember my love to my sisters. The Lord be with you, and lead you in his ways&quot;.
His brother, Adam Lighton or Leighton, was minister of Currie parish church, south of Edinburgh, and was succeeded in this role by his son (Robert&#x27;s nephew) Matthew Leighton.

==Leighton Library==

Leighton was a learned scholar, with wide-ranging interests. His legacy remains today in the Leighton Library (or &quot;Bibliotheca Leightoniana&quot;), which is the oldest purpose-built library in Scotland. It contains a collection of around 4,000 volumes and 78 manuscripts from the 16th to the 19th century, and is founded on the personal collection of Leighton, who bequeathed some 1,500 books to Dunblane Cathedral. A library building was erected between 1684 and 1688 in order to house the books for the use of the local clergy. From 1734 the library became one of the first subscription libraries in Scotland. The collection covers a variety of subject areas, including history and politics (particularly 17th century), theology, medicine, travel, and language.
Some of the collection was originally owned by Newbattle and was stored at the Old Manse, but it is now held in its entirety at The Cross, Dunblane. The catalogue of contents is now available to academics and researchers through arrangement with Stirling University.

<doc id="922528" wikidata="Q313433" url="?curid=922528" title="Héctor Elizondo">
<text>Héctor Elizondo (born December 22, 1936) is an American character actor. He is known for playing Phillip Watters in the television series &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; (1994–2000) and Ed Alzate in the television series &quot;Last Man Standing&quot; (2011–2021). His film roles include &quot;The Taking of Pelham One Two Three&quot; (1974), &quot;American Gigolo&quot; (1980), &quot;Leviathan&quot; (1989), &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; (1990), &quot;Beverly Hills Cop III&quot; (1994), &quot;Runaway Bride&quot; (1999), &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; (2001), and &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot; (2010).

Elizondo has received an Obie Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, and two ALMA Awards, and had been nominated for a Drama Desk Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Satellite Award, and five Screen Actors Guild Awards.

==Early life==
Elizondo was born in New York, the son of Carmen Medina Reyes and Martín Echevarría Elizondo, an accountant and notary public. His parents were Puerto Ricans of Spanish descent who moved from Puerto Rico to New York City with the hope of finding a better life. He grew up on the Upper West Side.

At a young age, he demonstrated a talent for sports and music. He sang for the Frank Murray Boys&#x27; Choir when he was 10 years old. Upon graduating from junior high school in 1950, he enrolled in the High School of the Performing Arts. He also attended another public high school, where he excelled in basketball and baseball. His baseball skills were good enough for him to be scouted by both the San Francisco Giants and the Pittsburgh Pirates. In 1954, Elizondo enrolled in City College of New York, intending to become a history teacher. However, during his freshman year, he became a father and dropped out of college, going to work full-time to support his family. Later, he divorced and gained full custody of his son, Rodd.

==Career==
From 1962 to 1963, Elizondo studied dance at the Ballet Arts Company at Carnegie Hall. During 1962–63, he also studied acting under Mario Stiletti at Stella Adler Theatre Studio when it was located in the Dryden East Hotel on East 39th St. In 1965, he landed a part in the off-Broadway show &quot;Kill the One-Eyed Man&quot;.

In 1968, he got a part in the play &quot;The Great White Hope&quot;. His first major success came when he played &quot;God&quot; in the guise of a Puerto Rican steam room attendant in &quot;Steambath&quot;, for his performance in which he won an Obie Award.

In 1974, Elizondo played an ex-mafioso-turned-subway hijacker, &quot;Mr. Grey,&quot; in &quot;The Taking of Pelham One Two Three&quot;.

He starred as a Puerto Rican widower on the CBS television series &quot;Popi&quot; (1975–1976). The short-lived series, which ran for 11 episodes, was one of the first American network television series to feature a Latino theme and cast. In 1975, he portrayed the murderer in an episode of &quot;Columbo&quot;, &quot;A Case of Immunity&quot;. He was a member of the cast of the 1985–86 CBS situation comedy &quot;Foley Square&quot;, starring Margaret Colin.

In the 1980s, Elizondo befriended Garry Marshall, who was impressed with his talent. Their first film together was &quot;Young Doctors in Love&quot;, in which Elizondo displays his guitar-playing talent. His role in &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; lasted only 10 minutes, but led to a Golden Globe nomination. In 1999, he co-starred in &quot;Runaway Bride&quot; as Fisher, the husband of the male protagonist&#x27;s ex-wife. Elizondo has participated in more than 80 films (18 of which have been Marshall&#x27;s). He appeared in every film that Marshall directed, including a brief appearance as a Portuguese fisherman in &quot;Overboard&quot;.

In 2001, he was featured in the short-lived television drama &quot;Kate Brasher&quot; and portrayed security head Joe in the film &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;, a role he reprised in the 2004 sequel, &quot;The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement&quot;. As a voice-actor, he played Bane in &quot;&quot;. He may be best known to television audiences as Dr. Phillip Watters on the CBS television series &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; created by well-known television creator David E. Kelley. He has won both an Emmy and ALMA award and was nominated for a Satellite Award and several SAG Awards for playing this role. He is one of only two people to remain on the show for its entire run, the other being Adam Arkin.

In 2008, Elizondo joined the cast of the USA Network series &quot;Monk&quot; as Dr. Neven Bell, Adrian Monk&#x27;s new psychiatrist, following the sudden death of Stanley Kamel, the actor who played Monk&#x27;s original psychiatrist. In 2023, he reprised his role in &quot;Mr. Monk&#x27;s Last Case: A Monk Movie&quot; after some convincing from Tony Shalhoub.

From 2011 to 2021, Elizondo played Ed Alzate on the Fox (formerly ABC) comedy &quot;Last Man Standing&quot;, starring Tim Allen and Nancy Travis.

In 2023, Elizondo guest voiced a character, Romar Adell, a local of Serenno who went into hiding after the Empire bombarded the planet, on &quot;Star Wars: The Bad Batch&quot;.

==Personal life==
Elizondo has been married three times. He became a father at the age of 19 with his first wife. His son Rodd was born on September 5, 1956, and died February 24, 2017 at the age of 60. Since 1969, he has been married to Carolee Campbell, an Emmy Award-winning actress who played nurse Carolee Simpson on &quot;The Doctors&quot;. They live in Sherman Oaks, California.

In April 2013, Elizondo participated in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Festival of Books, held at the University of Southern California, promoting children&#x27;s reading. Proud of his Latino heritage, Elizondo has said he does not accept roles that he feels are stereotypical or demeaning in any way.

<doc id="922533" wikidata="Q722795" url="?curid=922533" title="Armoured train">
<text>An armoured train (Commonwealth English) or armored train (American English) is a railway train protected with heavy metal plating and which often includes railway wagons armed with artillery, machine guns, and autocannons. Some have also had ports used to fire small arms from the inside of the train, especially in earlier armoured trains. For the most part, they were used during the late 19th and the early 20th centuries, when they offered an innovative way to quickly move large amounts of firepower into a new location.

Most countries have discontinued their use since road vehicles became much more powerful and offered more flexibility, train tracks proved too vulnerable to sabotage and attacks from the air, and air transportation was an even more flexible way to relocate firepower to a new location. However, there have been occasional uses in the late 20th century and early 21st century. Russia has used improvised armoured trains during the Second Chechen War (1999–2009) and in its invasion of Ukraine (2022–present).

Armoured trains were historically fighting systems, equipped with heavy weapons such as artillery. An exception was the US &quot;White Train&quot;, the Department of Energy Nuclear Weapons Transport Train, armoured and escorted by personnel armed with personal weapons.

== Definition ==
An armoured train is characterized by the armour from which it takes its name.

It is not to be confused with railway artillery, which includes a large-caliber gun and its crew, but without special protection from them. Trains simply equipped with light weapons without elaborate protective devices, e. g. a simple wagon with a few machine guns sheltered behind sandbags, are also not considered to be armoured trains.

== Design and equipment ==


The rail cars on an armoured train were designed for many tasks. Typical roles included:
* Artillery – equipped to carry artillery pieces, along with a mixture of other support weapons such as machine guns and rocket launchers. See also railway guns.
* Infantry – designed to carry infantry units, may also mount machine guns.
* Machine gun – equipped with machine guns.
* Anti-aircraft – equipped with anti-aircraft weapons.
* Command – similar to infantry wagons, but designed to be a train command centre
* Anti-tank – equipped with anti-tank guns, usually in a tank gun turret
* Platform – unarmoured, used for any purpose from the transport of ammunition or vehicles, through track repair or derailing protection, to railroad ploughs for track destruction.
* Troop sleepers
* The German Wehrmacht would sometimes use a flatbed car to carry a &quot;Fremdgerät&quot; light tank, such as a captured French Somua S-35 or Czech PzKpfw 38(t), or a Panzer II, which could quickly drive down a ramp and pursue enemy partisans away from the railway line
* Missile transport – the USSR had railway-based RT-23 Molodets ICBMs by the late 1980s (to reduce the chances of a first strike succeeding in destroying the launchers for a retaliatory strike). The US at one time proposed having a railway-based system for the MX Missile program, but this never got past the planning stage. The US also used an armoured Department of Energy Nuclear Weapons Transport Train, not for fighting but for transport within the country.

Different types of armour were used to protect from attack by tanks. In addition to various metal plates, concrete and sandbags were used in some cases for improvised armoured trains.

Armoured trains were sometimes escorted by a kind of rail-tank called a draisine. One such example was the &#x27;Littorina&#x27; armoured trolley which had a cab in the front and rear, each with a control set so it could be driven down the tracks in either direction. Littorina mounted two dual 7.92 mm MG13 machine gun turrets from Panzer I light tanks.

== History ==

=== Origins ===

Armoured and armed trains saw use during the 19th century in the American Civil War (1861–1865), the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871), the First and Second Boer Wars (1880–1881 and 1899–1902). During the Second Boer War Winston Churchill, then a war correspondent, was travelling on an armoured train which was ambushed by a Boer commando led by General Louis Botha on 15 November 1899; the Boers captured Churchill and many of the train&#x27;s contingent.

Early in the 20th century, Russia used armoured trains during the Russo-Japanese War. Armoured trains were also used during the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920) and World War I (1914–1918). The most intensive use of armoured trains was during the Russian Civil War (1918–1920). During the Chinese Civil War, White Russian emigrants in the service of Marshal Zhang Zuchang built 14 armored trains in 1924–1928. Some of them, for example &quot;Peking&quot; (&quot;Beijing&quot;) were built on the model of the First World War of the type &quot;Zaamurets&quot; (later the Czech &quot;Orlik&quot;). The Spanish Civil War saw a little use of armoured trains, though World War II (1939–1945) saw more. The French used them during the First Indochina War (1946–1954), a number of countries had armoured trains during the Cold War, and they were used during the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s and the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

===American Civil War===
The most successful armed train was a single armoured wagon built to defend the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad. The railroad had been attacked by southern forces to prevent transport of Union soldiers to the front, and snipers were discouraging men attempting to repair the damage. Baldwin Locomotive Works modified a baggage wagon in late April 1861. A 24-pounder howitzer was placed on a swivel mount at the opposite end of the wagon from the pushing locomotive. The sides of the wagon were sheathed with oak planks covered with boiler plate. The end of the wagon around the howitzer was fitted with hinged panels which could be temporarily lifted to aim and fire the howitzer and then lowered to protect the crew of six men loading the howitzer with canister shot or grapeshot. The remainder of the wagon contained fifty ports for riflemen. The wagon was effective for its original purpose, but vulnerability to artillery rendered such wagons of comparatively little use during later stages of the war. In August 1864, a Confederate raiding party disabled a Baltimore and Ohio Railroad locomotive pushing an armoured wagon, and then piled ties around the armoured wagon and set them afire.

===Volunteers===
In 1884 Charles Gervaise Boxall (1852–1914), a Brighton-born solicitor and officer in the 1st Sussex Artillery Volunteers, published &quot;The Armoured Train for Coast Defence in Great Britain&quot;, outlining a new way to employ heavy artillery. In 1894, when he had become commanding officer of the 1st Sussex AV, railway workers among the volunteers of No 6 Garrison Company manned an armoured train constructed in the workshops of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (of which the unit&#x27;s Honorary Colonel, Sir Julian Goldsmid, was a director).

===Second Boer War===
The British Army employed armoured trains during the Second Boer War, most famously a train that was extemporised in the railway workshops at Ladysmith just before the siege was closed round the town. On 15 November 1899 it left the town on reconnaissance manned by a company of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers under the command of Captain Aylmer Haldane, a company of volunteers of the Durban Light Infantry, and a 7-pounder mountain gun manned by sailors from HMS &quot;Tartar&quot;. Winston Churchill accompanied the mission as a war correspondent. The train was ambushed and part-derailed, and Haldane, Churchill and some 70 of the troops were captured after a fire-fight, although the locomotive got away with the wounded. Recalling his experience in &quot;My Early Life&quot;, Churchill wrote &quot;Nothing looks more formidable and impressive than an armoured train; but nothing is in fact more vulnerable and helpless. It was only necessary to blow up a bridge of culvert to leave the monster stranded, far from home and help, at the mercy of the enemy&quot;.

===World War I===
During World War I Russia used a mix of light and heavy armoured trains. The heavy trains mounted 4.2 inch or 6 inch guns; the light trains were equipped with 7.62 mm guns.

Austria-Hungary also fielded armoured trains against the Italians in World War I.

A Royal Navy armoured train from Britain, armed with four QF 6 inch naval guns and one QF 4 inch naval gun, was used in support of the British Expeditionary Force in the opening phase of the First Battle of Ypres in October 1914.

Two armoured trains were constructed at Crewe Works during 1915 for British coastal defense duties; one was based in Norfolk and one in Edinburgh to patrol rail routes on stretches of coast considered vulnerable to amphibious assault. The trains comprised two gun trucks, one at each end, mounted with a 12-pounder quick firing gun and a machine gun; an armoured cabin behind the artillery piece contained the magazine. Inboard of each gun truck was a truck for infantry quarters. This was also armoured, with observation ports and loops for rifle fire. The armoured locomotive, with the cab and motion protected, was marshalled into the centre of the train. The driver took up a position at whichever end of the train was leading, with the regulator controlled by a mechanical connection. The intention was that the infantry, with artillery support from the train&#x27;s guns, was to hold off a hostile landing force until reinforcements could be deployed.

Italy fitted twelve armed trains (under the control of the Regia Marina) to protect its Adriatic coast from raids on part of the k.u.k Kriegsmarine; each train was supplemented by a support one. Each armed train was formed by a FS Class 290 locomotive, three to five gun cars, two to four ammo cars and a command car; there were three types of armed train, one with 152 mm guns, another with 120 mm guns and the last with 76 mm AA guns. These trains were considered overall a success, and blunted attempted Austro-Hungarian raids on the Italian coast.

Two armoured trains were produced in the railway workshop located at Ajmer, India. One sent to Mesopotamia (now Iraq) by sea route for the Mesopotamian Campaign. Each train consists six wagons, Two wagons of each trains were ceiling less, each train consists 12-pounder guns, two Maxim heavy machine guns, two mine-exploding wagons, search light truck and a dynamo telegraph accommodation truck.

===Interwar years===

The Bolshevik forces in the Russian Civil War used a wide range of armoured trains, including Trotsky&#x27;s one. Many were improvised by locals, others were constructed by naval engineers at the Putilov and Izhorskiy factories. As a result, the trains ranged from little more than sandbagged flatbeds to the heavily armed and armoured trains produced by the naval engineers. An attempt to standardise the design from October 1919 only had limited success. By the end of the war the Bolshevik forces had 103 armoured trains of all types.

The Czechoslovak Legion used heavily armed and armoured trains to control large lengths of the Trans-Siberian Railway (and of Russia itself) during the Russian Civil War at the end of World War I.

Estonia built a total of 13 armoured trains during the Estonian War of Independence: six on broad-gauge and seven on narrow-gauge railways. The first three armoured trains with fully volunteer crews formed the backbone of the front in critical early stages of conflict. Carriages were former goods carriages and at first armor was limited to wood and sand, but later steel plating, machine guns, and cannons were added. Estonia later created a regiment for its armoured trains in 1934, called the Armoured Train Regiment, which consisted of 3 armoured trains. The regiment was dissolved in 1940, after the USSR invaded the Baltic States, and its railway artillery cannons were transferred to the Soviet army.
Lithuania had three armoured trains, named after the Grand Dukes of Lithuania: &quot;Gediminas&quot;, &quot;Kęstutis&quot; and &quot;Algirdas&quot;. The armoured trains were used from 1920 to 1935. The first of them, &quot;Gediminas&quot;, was used in the Polish–Lithuanian War.

After the First World War the use of armoured trains declined. They were used in China in the twenties and early thirties during the Chinese Civil War, most notably by the warlord Zhang Zongchang, who employed refugee Russians to man them.

===World War II===

Poland used armoured trains extensively during the invasion of Poland. One observer noted that &quot;Poland had only few armoured trains, but their officers and soldiers were fighting well. Again and again they were emerging from a cover in thick forests, disturbing German lines&quot;. One under-appreciated aspect of so many Polish armoured trains being deployed during the Polish Defensive War in 1939 is that when German planes attacked the railroads, it was usually the tracks themselves. As late as 17 September, three fresh divisions in the east were moved westward by train. On 18 September, three more divisions followed.

This in turn prompted Nazi Germany to reintroduce armoured trains into its own armies. Germany then used them to a small degree during World War II. They introduced significant designs of a versatile and well-equipped nature, including railcars which housed anti-aircraft gun turrets, or designed to load and unload tanks and railcars which had complete armour protection with a large concealed gun/howitzer. Germany also had fully armoured locomotives which were used on such trains. In July 1945 the German garrison of Lublin attempted to break out to the west, using an armoured train and an infantry battalion to cover the break. But Soviet tanks bought the train under close and heavy fire, blowing it o pieces and killing scores of escaping German soldiers. The commandant of Lublin was taken prisoner. 


During the Slovak National Uprising, the Slovak resistance used three armoured trains. They were named &quot;Hurban&quot;, &quot;Štefánik&quot; and &quot;Masaryk&quot;. They were built in the Zvolen railway factory in very short time – Štefánik was built just in 14 days, Hurban in 11 days. Boiler plates were used as the armor. In case of tank cars, whole tanks were used – LT-35 tanks were placed at the platform wagon and armored construction was built around the hull. Trains saw combat near Stará Kremnička, Čremošné, around Brezno. Later they were abandoned near Harmanec. Some of train cars were later used by Germans for training and for patrolling. Two original cars from the Štefánik train are preserved – the tank car (with original LT-35 tank inside) and machine gun car, and they are exhibited in the Museum of Slovak National Uprising in Banská Bystrica. Another train is exhibited in Zvolen – it is a replica of armoured train Hurban, which was built for the movie &quot;Deň, ktorý neumrie&quot;. This replica differs in comparison with the original trains by having bigger turrets from the T-34-85 tank, instead of turrets from LT-35.

The Red Army had a large number of armoured trains at the start of World War II but many were lost in 1941. Trains built later in the war tended to be fitted with T-34 or KV series tank turrets. Others were fitted as specialist anti-aircraft batteries. A few were fitted as heavy artillery batteries often using guns taken from ships.

Canada used an armoured train to patrol the Canadian National Railway along the Skeena River from Prince Rupert, British Columbia to the Pacific coast, against a possible Japanese seaborne raid. The train was equipped with a 75 mm gun, two Bofors 40 mm guns, and could accommodate a full infantry company. The No 1 Armoured Train entered service in June 1942, was put into reserve in September 1943, and dismantled the following year.

Twelve armoured trains were formed in Britain in 1940 as part of the preparations to face a German invasion; these were initially armed with QF 6 pounder 6 cwt Hotchkiss guns and six Bren Guns. They were operated by Royal Engineer crews and manned by Royal Armoured Corps troops. In late 1940 preparations began to hand the trains over to the Polish Army in the West, who operated them until 1942. They continued in use in Scotland and were operated by the Home Guard until the last one was withdrawn in November 1944. A 6-pounder wagon from one of these trains is preserved at the Tank Museum. A miniature armoured train ran on the 15-inch gauge Romney Hythe and Dymchurch Railway.

The Imperial Japanese Army also utilized armored trains. First in the 1920s, to guard the rail lines in Manchuria and later when they engaged Chinese NRA and CPC troops in Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945).

In 1940 Italy had twelve armed trains ready for use (again under Regia Marina control), nine for anti-ship duties and three for AA duties; six were assigned to La Spezia, and the other six to Taranto. One of them was heavily involved in the Battle of the Alps, shelling French forts in support of an Italian attack towards Menton, and suffering heavy damage by return fire. By 1943, eight trains had been deployed to Sicily; Allied air superiority did not allow them to have any meaningful role, and eventually they were all abandoned and destroyed by their crews.

===Post-World War II===
In the First Indochina War, the French Union used the armoured and armed train La Rafale as both a cargo-carrier and a mobile surveillance unit. In February 1951 the first Rafale was in service on the Saigon-Nha Trang line, Vietnam while from 1947 to May 1952 the second one which was escorted by onboard Cambodian troops of the BSPP (&quot;Brigade de Surveillance de Phnom Penh&quot;) was used on the Phnom Penh-Battambang line, Cambodia. In 1953 both trains were attacked by the Viet-Minh guerrillas who destroyed or mined stone bridges when passing by.

Fulgencio Batista&#x27;s army operated an armoured train during the Cuban Revolution; it was derailed and destroyed during the Battle of Santa Clara, and is commemorated by the &quot;Tren Blindado&quot; (armoured train) memorial.

An improvised armoured train named the &quot;Krajina express&quot; (&quot;Krajina ekspres&quot;) was used during the Croatian War of Independence of the early 1990s by the army of the Republic of Serbian Krajina. Composed of three fighting cars and three freight cars hooked to the front to protect it from mine blasts, the train carried a M18 Hellcat with a 76 mm cannon, a 40 mm Bofors, a 20 mm cannon, twin 57 mm rocket launchers and a 120 mm mortar, plus several machine guns of between 12.7 and 7.62 mm. During the Siege of Bihać in 1994, it was attacked on a few occasions with antitank rocket-propelled grenades and 76 mm guns and hit by a 9K11 Malyutka missile, but the damage was minor, as most of the train was covered with thick sheets of rubber which caused the missile&#x27;s warhead to explode too early to do any real damage. The train was eventually destroyed by its own crew lest it fall into enemy hands during Operation Storm, Croatia&#x27;s successful effort to reclaim the territories under occupation by Serbs. The Army of Republika Srpska operated a similar train that was ambushed and destroyed in October 1992 at the entrance to the town of Gradačac by Bosnian Muslim forces that included a T-55 tank. The wreckage was later converted into a museum. The Croatian Army deployed a two-wagon armoured train built in Split with a shield composed of two plates, one 8 mm and the other 6 mm thick, with a 30–50 mm gap filled with sand between them. The vehicle was armed with 12.7 mm machine guns.

One armoured train that remains in regular use is that of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, which the former received as a gift from the Soviet Union and the latter used heavily for state visits to China and Russia as he had a fear of flying.

====Soviet Union====

Facing the threat of Chinese cross-border raids during the Sino-Soviet split, the USSR developed armoured trains in the early 1970s to protect the Trans-Siberian Railway. According to different accounts, four or five trains were built. Every train included ten main battle tanks, two light amphibious tanks, several AA guns, as well as several armoured personnel carriers, supply vehicles and equipment for railway repairs. They were all mounted on open platforms or in special rail cars. Different parts of the train were protected with 5–20 mm thick armour. These trains were used by the Soviet Army to intimidate nationalist paramilitary units in 1990 during the early stages of the First Nagorno-Karabakh War.

Towards the end of the Cold War, both superpowers began to develop railway-based ICBMs mounted on armoured trains; the Soviets deployed the SS-24 missile in 1987, but budget costs and the changing international situation led to the cancellation of the programme, with all remaining railway-based missiles finally being deactivated in 2005.

====Russia====
Regular armoured trains have continued to be used by the post-Soviet Russian military. Two were deployed during the Second Chechen War, assisting in the Battle of Grozny (1999–2000); one was sent to the 2008 Russo-Georgian War. Outside of the formal Russian military hierarchy, Russian-backed militants in the Donbas region of Ukraine were pictured operating a homemade armoured train in late 2015.

An armoured train made up of two diesel locomotives powering eight various railcars, which carried anti-aircraft weaponry and unknown cargo supported the southern flank of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. A Russian Railway Troops armoured train named &quot;Yenisei&quot; used in Ukraine was later reported in more detail; it was made up of two locomotives and eight cars. Ukrainian sources accused Russia of stealing Ukrainian Railways assets to build Yenisei. Russia released video of another armoured train in June 2022. In total, Russia&#x27;s armoured train fleet consist of four known trains: &quot;Yenisei&quot;, &quot;Baikal&quot;, &quot;Volga&quot; and &quot;Amur&quot;.

== Armoured tram ==
Armoured trams have also been used, although not purpose-built. The just-formed Red Army used at least one armoured tram during the fighting for Moscow in the October Revolution in 1917. The Slovak National Uprising, better known for its armoured trains described above, also used at least one makeshift example.

<text>The Leitha (; , formerly ; ; Czech and ) is a river in Austria and Hungary, a right tributary of the Danube. It is long ( including its source river Schwarza). Its basin area is .

==Etymology==
The &quot;Lithaha&quot; River in the Carolingian Avar March was first mentioned in an 833 deed issued by Louis the German, son of the Carolingian emperor Louis the Pious and ruler over the stem duchy of Bavaria. The Old High German name probably referred to a Pannonian (Illyrian) denotation for &quot;mud&quot;, as maintained in the former Hungarian name (compare , &#x27;swamp&#x27;).

==Course==

The Leitha rises in Lower Austria at the confluence of its two headstreams, the Schwarza, discharging the Schneeberg, Rax and Schneealpe ranges of the Northern Limestone Alps, and the Pitten. Between Ebenfurth and Leithaprodersdorf, and between Bruck an der Leitha and Gattendorf, the Leitha forms part of the border between the Austrian states of Lower Austria and Burgenland. East of Nickelsdorf, the river passes into Hungary, where it flows into the Moson arm of the Danube west of Szigetköz Island near Mosonmagyaróvár. Important towns on its course are Wiener Neustadt, Bruck and Mosonmagyaróvár.

Large amounts of the Schwarza headstream waters are diverted to supply the Wiener Neustadt Canal and the drinking water supply of Vienna. Furthermore, several canals diverge from the Leitha, feeding spinning companies in the past, today small hydroelectric power plants. 

Between Seibersdorf and Hof am Leithaberge, most of the water in the Leitha is removed for this purpose. From there on, the Leitha usually runs dry, unless its flow further upstream is abnormally high. Downriver from Katzelsdorf the river bed is almost completely dry as well.

==Legends==

At the Leitha Ursprung (or Source) in the small town of Lanzenkirchen, there is a hiking trail, a stone with a plaque to mark the origin point and three wooden figures that represent the legendary Leitha Hexen (witches).

According to the sign next to the three wooden women, &quot;Once upon a time, real witches lived in the waters of the Leitha. They were small, like children, skinny and hunchbacked, with tangled hair that reached down to their knees and webbed fingers and toes.&quot;

&quot;The witches mostly splashed around under the bridges, but anyone who teased them or watched them met a bad end.&quot;

&quot;One evening a man was overcome by the desire to tempt the Leitha witches. When he heard them in the water, he put both hands around his mouth and shouted:
&#x27;Hoo hoo!&#x27; ”

&quot;Then he hurried away laughing. But he didn&#x27;t get far, because suddenly countless bony hands wrapped around him and pulled him to the ground! No amount of struggling and struggling helped; he couldn&#x27;t even call for help. He only felt a wet cloth being pressed over his mouth, then his senses faded.&quot;

&quot;When he came to again, he was lying on the banks of the Leitha, on the border with Katzelsdorf. But the Leitha witches were nowhere to be seen or heard.&quot;

==Historic border==
After the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin in the late 9th century, the Magyar horsemen dared further invasions into the adjacent West Frankish lands, until they were finally defeated by King Otto I in the 955 Battle of Lechfeld. Thereafter the forces of the Bavarian duke Henry the Wrangler gradually re-conquered the lands beyond the Vienna Woods up to the Leitha River, where about 976 the March of Austria (&quot;Ostarrîchi&quot;) was established under the Babenberg margrave Leopold I.

Around the turn to the 2nd millennium, the Hungarian frontier (&quot;Gyepű&quot;) ran along the Leitha shore, from 1156 onwards it formed the eastern border of the Duchy of Austria with fortresses erected at Wiener Neustadt, Bruck and Hainburg. The last Babenberg duke Frederick II of Austria was killed in the 1246 Battle of the Leitha River against King Béla IV of Hungary. The course of the border was confirmed in a 1411 deed issued by King Sigismund, when his daughter Elizabeth married the Habsburg duke Albert II of Austria. The placenames Cisleithania, Transleithania and Lajtabánság are all derived from the Leitha River. After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, which created the Dual Monarchy, &quot;Transleithanien&quot; (&quot;beyond the Leitha&quot;) was the Viennese colloquial word for the region beyond the Leitha (meaning Hungary or the Kingdom of Hungary), while &quot;Cisleithanien&quot; (&quot;on this side of the Leitha&quot;) denoted the Austrian lands. These names reflected the Viennese and Austrian perspectives towards the rest of the Empire, because Vienna lay on &#x27;this&#x27; side, and the other half, Hungary, lay on &#x27;that&#x27; side. Nevertheless, the Leitha did not form the entire border between the two: for instance Galicia and Bukovina, which were part of Cisleithania, were north-east of Hungary. Likewise, the Morava River formed the border between Cisleithanian Moravia and the Transleithanian lands of present-day Slovakia (Upper Hungary).

Upon the dissolution of Austria-Hungary after World War I, the 1920 Treaty of Trianon adjudicated the West Hungarian territory of the proclaimed Lajtabánság (Leitha Banat) to the Republic of Austria (as Burgenland), whereby the course of the river became an inner Austrian border.

<text>&quot;Side Saddle&quot; is a hit single which was number one in the UK Singles Chart for four weeks from 27 March 1959.

The honky-tonk style tune, composed by British popular music pianist Russ Conway under his real name Trevor Stanford, was written as part of the score for a television musical adaptation of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. Asked to compose a tune at short notice, Conway wrote an &quot;olde-world gavotte&quot; which he called &quot;Side Saddle&quot;. The song was a staple of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Housewives&#x27; Choice&quot; radio programme.

<text>Eloy is a German rock band. Founded in 1969 by guitarist Frank Bornemann, the band is best known for their progressive rock music.

== History ==
Founded in 1969 by guitarist Frank Bornemann, the band has endured several line-up changes, with Bornemann being the only consistent member of the group. In the 1980s, after a series of major splits in the group, Bornemann pursued a more commercial direction. However, in later years, former members of the band re-joined, and in 1998 released the album &quot;Ocean 2&quot;, a return to the classic symphonic progressive rock genre for which the band was well known. Despite attracting a large following in Germany, the band never gained popularity in the United States.

The name Eloy is based on the futurist race of humans from the book &quot;The Time Machine&quot; by H. G. Wells (there spelled &quot;Eloi&quot;). Bornemann described the origin of the name of the band thus: &quot;Wells describes in his book the situation of mankind about 800,000 years later, and &#x27;Eloy&#x27; is a human race in his story. The Eloy in Wells&#x27; story have made a new start with the help of the time traveler. In a way, it was a new beginning for the human race. German rock bands in the late 1960s played mainly covers from other bands instead of playing their own compositions. Record deals for German bands were absolutely rare and German bands generally were considered to be second class bands in their own country. At that time it was a strong effort for a German band to come out with only their own compositions. It was a start into an unknown future, and from this point of view, comparable to the human race in Wells&#x27; story. That is why I got the idea to name the band &#x27;Eloy&#x27;.&quot;

Bornemann reunited Eloy for its 40th anniversary in 2009. After a break of eleven years, the band released a new album called &quot;Visionary&quot;, aiming to recapture the spirit of the early years. A double DVD &quot;The Legacy Box&quot; was released in December 2010 and contains a number of videos and television recordings from all periods of the band, as well as a documentary of the band&#x27;s history.

The band played at festivals in Germany and Switzerland in July 2011 with largely the same personnel as those on the 1994–1995 tour. The band was booked to headline the North East Art Rock Festival in June 2012 – its first North American concert – but had to cancel after Bornemann was injured in road accident in March. In 2017 and 2019 two new CDs based on the legend of Jeanne d&#x27;Arc were released.

== Music ==
Although Eloy was a German rock band that debuted during the same time period as the introduction of krautrock, they are not a part of that music scene. Initially a hard rock band with blues rock influences, Eloy subsequently shifted into a different sound, which has been classified as progressive rock, symphonic rock and space rock.

<text>Leixões Sport Club, commonly known as Leixões (), is a Portuguese sports club from Matosinhos. It is organised into several departments for many sports, such as athletics, boxing, football, futsal, handball, karate, swimming, volleyball, water polo and billiards. It is most well known for its professional football department. Its football department has hosted a B reserve team called Leixões S.C. B.

Leixões won the 1960–61 Taça de Portugal.

== History ==
Leixões Sport Club was founded in 1907, making them one of Portugal&#x27;s oldest sports clubs in continuous operation. In 1961, they won their only Taça de Portugal, defeating Porto 2–0. This qualified Leixões to the 1961–62 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, in which they reached the quarter-finals before losing 4–2 on aggregate to East German side Motor Jena. Leixões had their best top-flight league performance in 1962–63, finishing fifth, 12 points behind champions Benfica.

Present in the top-flight since 1959–60, Leixões were relegated on goal difference in the 1976–77 season. Apart from the 1988–89 season, Leixões did not play in the top-flight again until 2007.

In 2002, Leixões beat Braga 3–1 away to secure a place in the Taça de Portugal final (the first and only third division club to play a final) against Sporting CP. The club, however, lost 1–0, but nonetheless secured a spot in the following season&#x27;s UEFA Cup and Portuguese Supercup after Sporting had also finished as national champions for the year. The following season, Leixões lost the Portuguese Supercup against Sporting CP by 5–1. That same year, Leixões lost 5–3 on aggregate to Greek side PAOK after winning the first leg 2–1 at home, thus suffering elimination in the first round of the UEFA Cup. They also romped to the Segunda Divisão B title with 94 points and with it they gained promotion to the Segunda Liga.

In 2004, they just avoided relegation back to Division Two and finished 14th. A year later, they battled to finish seventh in the league. Finally in 2006, they nearly reached the top-flight Primeira Liga, losing out to Desportivo das Aves in the promotion chase by finishing third, two points behind Aves. Third place used to merit a promotion, but due to a re-construction to all leagues, it meant only the top two would go up (Beira-Mar as champions and Aves as runners-up). Finally, in 2007, they gained promotion to the Liga, 18 years after their relegation. During this stint, which lasted three seasons, their best result was a sixth-place finish in 2008–09. Their last match in the Primeira Liga was a 1–0 away loss to Olhanense on 2 May 2010.

<doc id="922554" wikidata="Q8737769" url="?curid=922554" title="Discharge (hydrology)">
<text>In hydrology, discharge is the volumetric flow rate (volume per time, in units of m3/h or ft3/h) of a stream. It equals the product of average flow velocity (with dimension of length per time, in m/h or ft/h) and the cross-sectional area (in m2 or ft2). It includes any suspended solids (e.g. sediment), dissolved chemicals like (aq), or biologic material (e.g. diatoms) in addition to the water itself. Terms may vary between disciplines. For example, a fluvial hydrologist studying natural river systems may define discharge as streamflow, whereas an engineer operating a reservoir system may equate it with outflow, contrasted with inflow.

==Formulation==
A discharge is a measure of the quantity of any fluid flow over unit time. The quantity may be either volume or mass. Thus the water discharge of a tap (faucet) can be measured with a measuring jug and a stopwatch. Here the discharge might be 1 litre per 15 seconds, equivalent to 67 ml/second or 4 litres/minute. This is an average measure. For measuring the discharge of a river we need a different method and the most common is the &#x27;area-velocity&#x27; method. The area is the cross sectional area across a river and the average velocity across that section needs to be measured for a unit time, commonly a minute. Measurement of cross sectional area and average velocity, although simple in concept, are frequently non-trivial to determine.

The units that are typically used to express discharge in streams or rivers include m3/s (cubic meters per second), ft3/s (cubic feet per second or cfs) and/or acre-feet per day.

A commonly applied methodology for measuring, and estimating, the discharge of a river is based on a simplified form of the continuity equation. The equation implies that for any incompressible fluid, such as liquid water, the discharge (Q) is equal to the product of the stream&#x27;s cross-sectional area (A) and its mean velocity (formula_1), and is written as:
:formula_2
where
*formula_3 is the discharge ([L3T−1]; m3/s or ft3/s)
*formula_4 is the cross-sectional area of the portion of the channel occupied by the flow ([L2]; m2 or ft2)
*formula_1 is the average flow velocity ([LT−1]; m/s or ft/s)

For example, the average discharge of the Rhine river in Europe is or per day.

Because of the difficulties of measurement, a stream gauge is often used at a fixed location on the stream or river.

==Hydrograph==
==Catchment discharge==

The catchment of a river above a certain location is determined by the surface area of all land which drains toward the river from above that point. The river&#x27;s discharge at that location depends on the rainfall on the catchment or drainage area and the inflow or outflow of groundwater to or from the area, stream modifications such as dams and irrigation diversions, as well as evaporation and evapotranspiration from the area&#x27;s land and plant surfaces. In storm hydrology, an important consideration is the stream&#x27;s discharge hydrograph, a record of how the discharge varies over time after a precipitation event. The stream rises to a peak flow after each precipitation event, then falls in a slow recession. Because the peak flow also corresponds to the maximum water level reached during the event, it is of interest in flood studies. Analysis of the relationship between precipitation intensity and duration and the response of the stream discharge are aided by the concept of the unit hydrograph, which represents the response of stream discharge over time to the application of a hypothetical &quot;unit&quot; amount and duration of rainfall (e.g., half an inch over one hour). The amount of precipitation correlates to the volume of water (depending on the area of the catchment) that subsequently flows out of the river. Using the unit hydrograph method, actual historical rainfalls can be modeled mathematically to confirm characteristics of historical floods, and hypothetical &quot;design storms&quot; can be created for comparison to observed stream responses.

The relationship between the discharge in the stream at a given cross-section and the level of the stream is described by a rating curve. Average velocities and the cross-sectional area of the stream are measured for a given stream level. The velocity and the area give the discharge for that level. After measurements are made for several different levels, a rating table or rating curve may be developed. Once rated, the discharge in the stream may be determined by measuring the level, and determining the corresponding discharge from the rating curve. If a continuous level-recording device is located at a rated cross-section, the stream&#x27;s discharge may be continuously determined.

Larger flows (higher discharges) can transport more sediment and larger particles downstream than smaller flows due to their greater force. Larger flows can also erode stream banks and damage public infrastructure.

==Catchment effects on discharge and morphology==
G. H. Dury and M. J. Bradshaw are two geographers who devised models showing the relationship between discharge and other variables in a river. The Bradshaw model described how pebble size and other variables change from source to mouth; while Dury considered the relationships between discharge and variables such as stream slope and friction. These follow from the ideas presented by Leopold, Wolman and Miller in &quot;Fluvial Processes in Geomorphology&quot;. and on land use affecting river discharge and bedload supply.

== Inflow ==
Inflow is the sum of processes within the hydrologic cycle that increase the water levels of bodies of water.
Most precipitation occurs directly over bodies of water such as the oceans, or on land as surface runoff. A portion of runoff enters streams and rivers, and another portion soaks into the ground as groundwater seepage. The rest soaks into the ground as infiltration, some of which infiltrates deep into the ground to replenish aquifers.

<doc id="922556" wikidata="Q5340334" url="?curid=922556" title="Eddison Zvobgo">
<text>Eddison Jonasi Mudadirwa Zvobgo (2 October 1935 – 22 August 2004) was a Zimbabwean politician and the founder of Zimbabwe&#x27;s ruling party, ZANU–PF. He was the ZANU-PF&#x27;s spokesman at the Lancaster House in late 1979, a Harvard-educated lawyer, a poet, a guerrilla war strategist, a freedom fighter, a war veteran, a hotelier, and a national hero.

His name is often misspelled by the media, either as &quot;Edson&quot; instead of Eddison or &quot;Zvo&quot;gb&quot;o&quot; instead of Zvo&quot;bg&quot;o.

Zvobgo was born in dire poverty in then Southern Rhodesia in 1935, near Fort Victoria (now Masvingo), where his father was a minister in the Dutch Reformed Church. He comes from the Karanga subgroup of the Shona people. In 1960, Zvobgo won a scholarship to Tufts University in Boston, Massachusetts aged 25. After taking a bachelor&#x27;s degree there in 1964, he returned home to be arrested and detained for political activism against white rule in Rhodesia, along with Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo.

He was freed in 1971, and he spent a period in exile in Canada. He then studied law at Harvard University and International Relations at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, followed by a position as associate professor of criminal law at Lewis University College of Law in Illinois.

Zvobgo played a key role in international negotiations at Lancaster House that ended the bitter Rhodesian Bush War and led to British-sponsored all-race elections ahead of Zimbabwe&#x27;s independence in 1980. He was the Zanu-PF spokesman, and impressed many in the international press with his quick repartee and astute analysis of the negotiations. In the 1980 elections, he won a seat in Parliament for Masvingo, which he continued to hold until his death.

An influential member of Zimbabwe&#x27;s first fully independent cabinet, Zvobgo was Minister of Local Government and Housing until 1982, and Minister of Justice until 1985. In 1987, he had become Zimbabwe&#x27;s Minister of Parliamentary and Constitutional Affairs and it was in this capacity that he made several amendments to Zimbabwe&#x27;s Constitution.

Initially a staunch supporter of Zanu-PF policies, Zvobgo later criticized Robert Mugabe&#x27;s autocratic rule.

In 1992, Zvobgo was moved to the less influential post of Minister of Mines. In 1996, Zvobgo survived a car accident, in which both his legs were broken. This accident was considered suspicious by many. Shortly after the accident President Mugabe demoted Dr. Zvobgo further to Minister Without Portfolio, and, in 2000, Dr. Zvobgo was dropped from Zimbabwe&#x27;s cabinet altogether.

In the 2002 presidential elections, Zvobgo refused to campaign for Mugabe, but did not endorse the opposition challenger Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). He also voiced his opposition to the sweeping media law, passed the same year, calling it &quot;the most serious assault on our constitutional liberties since independence&quot;.

Despite his criticism, Zvobgo eventually voted for the legislation, which was used to close off Zimbabwe&#x27;s only privately owned daily newspaper, &quot;The Daily News&quot;, and to arrest at least 31 independent journalists.

Zvobgo became the subject of an internal party disciplinary inquiry in 2003 for his refusal to campaign for Mugabe and after describing the laws as a weapon to stifle opposition to the government, but allegations of disloyalty were eventually dropped. He was also accused of holding private talks with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change as the ruling party abandoned formal dialogue between the two parties.

Zvobgo died of cancer on 22 August 2004. He was declared a National Hero and buried at Zimbabwe&#x27;s National Heroes&#x27; Acre. He was survived by his seven children, Kerina, Eddison, Tsungirirai, Jonas, Tendai, Esther and Farai Emily.

<doc id="922567" wikidata="Q1073295" url="?curid=922567" title="Fermi's golden rule">
<text>In quantum physics, Fermi&#x27;s golden rule is a formula that describes the transition rate (the probability of a transition per unit time) from one energy eigenstate of a quantum system to a group of energy eigenstates in a continuum, as a result of a weak perturbation. This transition rate is effectively independent of time (so long as the strength of the perturbation is independent of time) and is proportional to the strength of the coupling between the initial and final states of the system (described by the square of the matrix element of the perturbation) as well as the density of states. It is also applicable when the final state is discrete, i.e. it is not part of a continuum, if there is some decoherence in the process, like relaxation or collision of the atoms, or like noise in the perturbation, in which case the density of states is replaced by the reciprocal of the decoherence bandwidth.

==Historical background==
Although the rule is named after Enrico Fermi, most of the work leading to it is due to Paul Dirac, who twenty years earlier had formulated a virtually identical equation, including the three components of a constant, the matrix element of the perturbation and an energy difference. It was given this name because, on account of its importance, Fermi called it &quot;golden rule No. 2&quot;.

Most uses of the term Fermi&#x27;s golden rule are referring to &quot;golden rule No. 2&quot;, but Fermi&#x27;s &quot;golden rule No. 1&quot; is of a similar form and considers the probability of indirect transitions per unit time.

==The rate and its derivation==
Fermi&#x27;s golden rule describes a system that begins in an eigenstate formula_1 of an unperturbed Hamiltonian and considers the effect of a perturbing Hamiltonian applied to the system. If is time-independent, the system goes only into those states in the continuum that have the same energy as the initial state. If is oscillating sinusoidally as a function of time (i.e. it is a harmonic perturbation) with an angular frequency , the transition is into states with energies that differ by from the energy of the initial state.

In both cases, the &quot;transition probability per unit of time&quot; from the initial state formula_1 to a set of final states formula_3 is essentially constant. It is given, to first-order approximation, by
formula_4
where formula_5 is the matrix element (in bra–ket notation) of the perturbation between the final and initial states, and formula_6 is the density of states (number of continuum states divided by formula_7 in the infinitesimally small energy interval formula_8 to formula_9) at the energy formula_10 of the final states. This transition probability is also called &quot;decay probability&quot; and is related to the inverse of the mean lifetime. Thus, the probability of finding the system in state formula_1 is proportional to formula_12.

The standard way to derive the equation is to start with time-dependent perturbation theory and to take the limit for absorption under the assumption that the time of the measurement is much larger than the time needed for the transition.

Only the magnitude of the matrix element formula_5 enters the Fermi&#x27;s golden rule. The phase of this matrix element, however, contains separate information about the transition process.
It appears in expressions that complement the golden rule in the semiclassical Boltzmann equation approach to electron transport.

While the Golden rule is commonly stated and derived in the terms above, the final state (continuum) wave function is often rather vaguely described, and not normalized correctly (and the normalisation is used in the derivation). The problem is that in order to produce a continuum there can be no spatial confinement (which would necessarily discretise the spectrum), and therefore the continuum wave functions must have infinite extent, and in turn this means that the normalisation formula_14 is infinite, not unity. If the interactions depend on the energy of the continuum state, but not any other quantum numbers, it is usual to normalise continuum wave-functions with energy formula_15 labelled formula_16, by writing formula_17 where formula_18 is the Dirac delta function, and effectively a factor of the square-root of the density of states is included into formula_19. In this case, the continuum wave function has dimensions of formula_20, and the Golden Rule is now
formula_21
where formula_22 refers to the continuum state with the same energy as the discrete state formula_23. For example, correctly normalized continuum wave functions for the case of a free electron in the vicinity of a hydrogen atom are available in Bethe and Salpeter.

==Applications==
===Semiconductors===
The Fermi&#x27;s golden rule can be used for calculating the transition probability rate for an electron that is excited by a photon from the valence band to the conduction band in a direct band-gap semiconductor, and also for when the electron recombines with the hole and emits a photon. Consider a photon of frequency formula_24 and wavevector formula_25, where the light dispersion relation is formula_26 and formula_27 is the index of refraction.

Using the Coulomb gauge where formula_28 and formula_29, the vector potential of light is given by formula_30 where the resulting electric field is
formula_31

For an electron in the valence band, the Hamiltonian is
formula_32
where formula_33 is the potential of the crystal, formula_34 and formula_35 are the charge and mass of an electron, and formula_36 is the momentum operator. Here we consider process involving one photon and first order in formula_37. The resulting Hamiltonian is
formula_38
where formula_39 is the perturbation of light.

From here on we consider vertical optical dipole transition, and thus have transition probability based on time-dependent perturbation theory that
formula_40
with formula_41
where formula_42 is the light polarization vector. formula_1 and formula_3 are the Bloch wavefunction of the initial and final states. Here the transition probability needs to satisfy the energy
conservation given by formula_45. From perturbation it is evident that the heart of the calculation lies in the matrix elements shown in the bracket.

For the initial and final states in valence and conduction bands, we have formula_46 and formula_47, respectively and if the formula_39 operator does not act on the spin, the electron stays in the same spin state and hence we can write the Bloch wavefunction of the initial and final states as
formula_49
formula_50
where formula_51 is the number of unit cells with volume formula_52. Calculating using these wavefunctions, and focusing on emission (photoluminescence) rather than absorption, we are led to the transition rate
formula_53
where formula_54 defined as the optical transition dipole moment is qualitatively the expectation value formula_55 and in this situation takes the form
formula_56

Finally, we want to know the total transition rate formula_57. Hence we need to sum over all possible initial and final states that can satisfy the energy conservation (i.e. an integral of the Brillouin zone in the &quot;k&quot;-space), and take into account spin degeneracy, which after calculation results in
formula_58
where formula_59 is the joint valence-conduction density of states (i.e. the density of pair of states; one occupied valence state, one empty conduction state). In 3D, this is
formula_60
but the joint DOS is different for 2D, 1D, and 0D.

We note that in a general way we can express the Fermi&#x27;s golden rule for semiconductors as
formula_61

In the same manner, the stationary DC photocurrent with amplitude proportional to the square of the field of light is
formula_62
where formula_63 is the relaxation time, formula_64 and formula_65 are the
difference of the group velocity and Fermi-Dirac distribution between possible the initial and
final states. Here formula_66 defines the optical transition dipole. Due to the commutation relation between position formula_67 and the Hamiltonian, we can also rewrite the transition dipole and photocurrent in terms of position operator matrix using formula_68. This effect can only exist in systems with broken inversion symmetry and nonzero components of the photocurrent can be obtained by symmetry arguments.

===Scanning tunneling microscopy===

In a scanning tunneling microscope, the Fermi&#x27;s golden rule is used in deriving the tunneling current. It takes the form
formula_69
where formula_70 is the tunneling matrix element.

===Quantum optics===
When considering energy level transitions between two discrete states, Fermi&#x27;s golden rule is written as
formula_71
where formula_72 is the density of photon states at a given energy, formula_73 is the photon energy, and formula_24 is the angular frequency. This alternative expression relies on the fact that there is a continuum of final (photon) states, i.e. the range of allowed photon energies is continuous.

===Drexhage experiment===

Fermi&#x27;s golden rule predicts that the probability that an excited state will decay depends on the density of states. This can be seen experimentally by measuring the decay rate of a dipole near a mirror: as the presence of the mirror creates regions of higher and lower density of states, the measured decay rate depends on the distance between the mirror and the dipole.

<text>The nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus) (, literally meaning &quot;blue cow&quot;) is the largest antelope of Asia, and is ubiquitous across the northern Indian subcontinent. It is the sole member of the genus Boselaphus, which was first scientifically described by Peter Simon Pallas in 1766. The nilgai stands at the shoulder; males weigh , and the lighter females . A sturdy thin-legged antelope, the nilgai is characterised by a sloping back, a deep neck with a white patch on the throat, a short crest of hair along the neck terminating in a tuft, and white facial spots. A column of pendant coarse hair hangs from the dewlap ridge below the white patch. Sexual dimorphism is prominent – while females and juveniles are orange to tawny, adult males have a bluish-grey coat. Only males possess horns, long.

The nilgai is diurnal (active mainly during the day). The animals band together in three distinct kinds of groups: one or two females with young calves, three to six adult and yearling females with calves, and all-male groups with two to 18 members. Typically tame, the nilgai may appear timid and cautious if harassed or alarmed; it flees up to , or even , galloping away from the source of danger. Herbivores, nilgai prefer grasses and herbs, though they commonly eat woody plants in the dry tropical forests of India. Females become sexually mature by two years, while males do not become sexually active until four or five years old. The time of the year when mating takes place varies geographically, but a peak breeding season lasting three to four months can be observed at most places. Gestation lasts eight to nine months, following which a single calf (sometimes twins or even triplets) is born. As typical of several bovid species, nilgai calves stay hidden for the first few weeks of their lives. The lifespan of the nilgai is around ten years.

The nilgai prefers areas with short bushes and scattered trees in scrub forests and grassy plains. It is commonly found on agricultural land and rarely in dense forests. Major populations occur in the Indian and Nepal Terai. It was thought to be extinct in Bangladesh. The nilgai was introduced to Texas in the 1920s to 1930s. the feral population in Texas is nearly 37,000. The nilgai is categorised as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. The nilgai has been associated with Indian culture since the Vedic period (1500–500 BCE). They were hunted in the Mughal era (16th to 19th centuries) and are depicted in numerous miniatures. Nilgai have been considered a pest in several north Indian states, as they ravage crop fields and cause considerable damage. In Bihar, authorities have classified the nilgai as vermin.

==Etymology==
The vernacular name &quot;nilgai&quot; comes from the fusion of the Hindi words &quot;nil&quot; (&quot;blue&quot;) and &quot;gai&quot; (&quot;cow&quot;). The word was first recorded in use in 1882. Alternative origins could be from the Persian &quot;gaw&quot; (&quot;cow&quot;). The nilgai has been referred to by a variety of names: neelghae, nilgau, nilgo, nylghau, and nylghai, constructions referring to other &quot;blue&quot; animals. They are also known as white-footed antelope. During Mughal emperor Aurangzeb&#x27;s reign (1658–1707) of India, the nilgai was known by the name &quot;nilghor&quot; (&quot;nil&quot; for &quot;blue&quot; and &quot;ghor&quot; for &quot;horse&quot;).

==Taxonomy==
The scientific name of the nilgai is &quot;Boselaphus tragocamelus.&quot; The nilgai is the sole member of the genus &quot;Boselaphus&quot; and placed in the family Bovidae. The species was described and given its binomial name by the German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in 1766. He based his description on a 1745 account of a male nilgai by British physician James Parsons in the 43rd volume of &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; (now known as the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot;). The nilgai has one other relative in the tribe Boselaphini, the four-horned antelope (the sole member of &quot;Tetracerus&quot;).

The generic name &quot;Boselaphus&quot; comes from the combination of the Latin &quot;bos&quot; (&quot;cow&quot; or &quot;ox&quot;) and the Greek (&quot;deer&quot;). The specific name &quot;tragocamelus&quot; comes from the join of the two Greek words &quot;tragos&quot; (&quot;he-goat&quot;) and &quot;kamelos&quot; (&quot;camel&quot;). The binomial combination was first used by English zoologist Philip Sclater in 1883. &quot;Boselaphus&quot; has often been misspelled as &quot;Buselaphus&quot; (first used by Ludwig Reichenbach in 1845 for the red hartebeest) and &quot;Bosephalus&quot; (first used by Thomas Horsfield in 1851, when he mistook a nilgai specimen for a hartebeest in a museum catalogue of the East India Company).

==Evolution==
A 1992 phylogenetic study of mitochondrial DNA sequences showed a strong possibility of a clade consisting of Boselaphini, Bovini, and Tragelaphini. Bovini consists of the genera &quot;Bubalus&quot;, &quot;Bos&quot;, &quot;Pseudoryx&quot; (saola), &quot;Syncerus&quot; (African Buffalo), &quot;Bison&quot; and the extinct &quot;Pelorovis&quot;. Tragelaphini consists of two genera: &quot;Taurotragus&quot; (eland) and &quot;Tragelaphus&quot;. A closer relationship between Boselaphini and Tragelaphini was predicted, and seconded by a similar study in 1999.

Though the tribe Boselaphini has no African representation today, fossil evidence supports its presence in the continent in the prehistoric times, as early as the late Miocene. The two living antelope species of this tribe have been found to have a closer relationship with the earliest bovids (like &quot;Eotragus&quot; species) than do the other bovids. This tribe originated at least 8.9 million years ago, in much the same area where the four-horned antelope lives today, and may represent the most &quot;primitive&quot; of all living bovids, having changed the least since the origins of the family. The extant and extinct boselaphine forms show similar development of the horn cores (the central bony part of the horn). Though the extant nilgai females lack horns, historic relatives of the antelope had horned females. Fossil relatives were once placed in the subfamily Cephalophinae which now contains only the African duikers. Fossils of &quot;Protragoceros&quot; and &quot;Sivoreas&quot; dating back to the late Miocene have been discovered not only in Asia and southern Europe but also in the Ngorora Formation (Kenya) and are thought to belong to the Boselaphini. Other Miocene fossils of boselaphines discovered are of &quot;Eotragus&quot;, &quot;Miotragocerus&quot; and &quot;Tragoportax&quot;; fossils of &quot;Miotragoceros&quot; are not apparent in Africa (only &quot;M. cyrenaicus&quot; has been reported from the continent), but have significant presence in the Shiwalik Hills in India and Pakistan, as do several &quot;Tragoportax&quot; species. A 2005 study showed the migration of &quot;Miotragoceros&quot; to eastern Asia around eight million years ago. Alan W. Gentry of the Natural History Museum reported the presence of another boselaphine, &quot;Mesembriportax&quot;, from Langebaanweg (South Africa).

Remains of the nilgai dating back to the Pleistocene have been discovered from the Kurnool caves in southern India. Evidence suggests that they were hunted by humans during the Mesolithic period (5,000 to 8,000 years ago).

==Description==
A sturdy thin-legged antelope, the nilgai is characterised by a sloping back, a deep neck with a white patch on the throat, a short mane of hair behind and along the back ending behind the shoulder, and around two white spots each on its face, ears, cheeks, lips and chin. The ears, tipped with black, are long. A column of coarse hair, known as the &quot;pendant&quot; and around long in males, can be observed along the dewlap ridge below the white throat patch. The tufted tail, up to , has a few white spots and is tipped with black. The forelegs are generally longer, and the legs are often marked with white &quot;socks&quot;.
While females and juveniles are orange to tawny, males are much darker – their coat is typically bluish grey. The ventral parts, the insides of the thighs and the tail are all white. A white stripe extends from the underbelly and broadens as it approaches the rump, forming a patch lined with dark hair. Almost white, though not albino, individuals have been observed in the Sariska National Park. while individuals with white patches have been recorded at zoos. The hairs, typically long, are fragile and brittle. Males have thicker skin on their head and neck that protect them in fights. The coat is not well-insulated with fat during winter, and consequently severe cold might be fatal for the nilgai.
Males are horned, and the occasional female. The horns are long but generally shorter than . Smooth and straight, these may point backward or forward. The horns of the nilgai lack the ringed structure typical of those of other bovids.

The nilgai is the largest antelope in Asia. It stands at the shoulder; the head-and-body length is typically between . Males weigh ; the maximum weight recorded is . Females are lighter, weighing . Sexual dimorphism is prominent; the males are larger than females and differ in colouration.

The maximum recorded length of the skull is . The dental formula is . The milk teeth are totally lost and the permanent dentition completed by three years of age. The permanent teeth get degraded with age, showing prominent signs of wear at six years of age. The nilgai has sharp ears and eyes, though its sense of smell is not as acute.

==Distribution and habitat==
The nilgai is endemic to the Indian subcontinent: major populations occur in India, Nepal and Pakistan. The population in Bangladesh was thought to be extinct, but some individuals from Indian and Nepalese populations cross the border into the northwest of the country. Significant numbers occur in the Terai lowlands in the foothills of the Himalayas; the antelope is abundant across northern India.
It prefers areas with short bushes and scattered trees in scrub forests and grassy plains. They are common in agricultural lands, but hardly occur in dense woods. In southern Texas, it roams in the prairies, scrub forests and oak forests. It is a generalist animal—it can adapt to a variety of habitats. Though sedentary and less dependent on water, nilgai may desert their territories if all water sources in and around it dry up. Territories in Texas are large.

The Indian population was estimated at one million in 2001. The nilgai were first introduced to Texas in the 1920s and the 1930s in a large ranch near the Norias Division of the King Ranch, one of the largest ranches in the world. The feral population saw a spurt toward the latter part of the 1940s, and gradually spread out to adjoining ranches.

Population densities show great geographical variation across India. Density can be as low as 0.23 to 0.34 individuals per km2 in Indravati National Park. and 0.4 individuals per km2 in the Pench Tiger Reserve, or as high as 6.6 to 11.36 individuals per km2 in Ranthambhore National Park, and seven individuals per km2 in Keoladeo National Park. Seasonal variations were noted in Bardiya National Park in a 1980 study; the density 3.2 individuals per km2 during the dry season and 5 per km2 in April, the start of the dry season. In southern Texas, densities were found to be nearly 3–5 individuals per km2 in 1976.

Historic notes mention nilgai in southern India, but these may have been feral:
==Behavior and ecology==

The nilgai is diurnal (active mainly during the day). A 1991 study investigated the daily routine of the antelope and found feeding peaks at dawn, in the morning, in the afternoon and during the evening. Females and juveniles do not interact appreciably with males, except during the mating season. Groups are generally small, with ten or fewer individuals, though groups of 20 to 70 individuals can occur at times. In a 1980 study in Bardiya National Park, the average herd size was of three individuals; In a 1995 study in the Gir National Park, herd membership varied with season. However, three distinct groupings are formed: one or two females with young calves, three to six adult and yearling females with calves, and male groups with two to 18 members.
Typically tame, the nilgai may appear timid and cautious if harassed or alarmed; instead of seeking cover like duikers it would flee up to -or even on galloping-away from the danger. Though generally quiet, nilgai have been reported to make short guttural grunts when alarmed, and females to make clicking noises when nursing young. Alarmed individuals, mainly juveniles below five months, give out a coughing roar (whose pitch is highest in case of the juveniles) that lasts half a second, but can be heard by herds less than away and responded to similarly.

Fights take place in both sexes and involve pushing their necks against each other or ramming into one another using horns. Fights can be gory; despite the protective skin deep, lacerated wounds and even deaths might occur. Display behaviour focuses on the throat patch and the beard, and threatening opponents by pointing the horns toward them. A young male was observed making a submissive display in the Sariska Reserve by kneeling before an adult male, who stood erect. The nilgai mark their territories by forming dung piles as much as in radius. The defecation process is elaborate-the antelope stands with his legs about a metre apart, with the rump lowered and the tail held almost vertical; it stays in the same posture for at least ten seconds after relieving itself. The process is not as elaborate in the females as it is in the males.
In India, the nilgai shares its habitat with the four-horned antelope, chinkara, chital and blackbuck; its association with the gaur and the water buffalo is less common. In Ranthambore National Park, the nilgai and the chinkara collectively prefer the area rich in &quot;Acacia&quot; and &quot;Butea&quot; species, while the sambar deer and the chital preferred the forests of &quot;Anogeissus&quot; and &quot;Grewia&quot; species. In India, the Bengal tiger and Asiatic lion prey on the nilgai but they are not significant predators of this antelope. Leopards also prey on the nilgai, though they prefer smaller prey. Dholes generally attack juveniles. Other predators includes the Indian wolf and striped hyena.

===Diet===
The nilgai is a browser or mixed feeder, but primarily a grazer in Texas. It prefers grasses and herbs, but also feeds on woody plants in the dry tropical forests of India. Diets generally suffice in protein and fats. The protein content of the nilgai&#x27;s should be at least seven percent. The nilgai can survive for long periods without water and does not drink regularly even in summer.
In Sariska Reserve, it prefers herbs and grasses; grasses become more important in the rainy season, while during winter and summer it feeds additionally on &quot;Butea monosperma&quot; flowers, foliage of &quot;Anogeissus pendula&quot;, &quot;Capparis sepiaria&quot;, &quot;Grewia flavescens&quot; and &quot;Zizyphus mauritiana&quot;), pods of &quot;Acacia nilotica&quot;, &quot;A. catechu&quot; and A. leucophloea, and fruits of &quot;Zizyphus mauritiana&quot;. Preferred grass species include &quot;Cenchrus&quot; species, &quot;Cynodon dactylon&quot;, &quot;Desmostachya bipinnata&quot;, &quot;Scirpus tuberosus&quot; and &quot;Vetiveria zizanoides&quot;. Woody plants eaten include &quot;Acacia nilotica&quot;, &quot;A. senegal&quot;, &quot;A. leucophloea&quot;, &quot;Clerodendrum phlomidis&quot;, &quot;Crotalaria burhia&quot;, &quot;Indigofera oblongifolia&quot;, &quot;Morus alba&quot; and &quot;Zizyphus nummularia&quot;; herbs favoured are &quot;Cocculus hirsutus&quot;, &quot;Euphorbia hirta&quot; and &quot;Sida rhombifolia&quot;. Seeds of &quot;Paspalum distichum&quot; occurred in the dung of nilgai most of the year; &quot;Acacia nilotica&quot; and &quot;Prosopis juliflora&quot; seeds were discovered in the dry season and those of &quot;Echinochloa crusgalli&quot; during the monsoon.

===Reproduction===
Observations of females in southern Texas revealed that ovaries are developed by two years of age and the first birth takes place typically a year later, though in a few cases females as young as one-and-a-half years may mate successfully. Females can breed again around a year after parturition. Males in the same location were found to have active testes by the age of three years, that matured considerably by the next year. Males become sexually active at four or five years. Mating may occur throughout the year, with peaks of three to four months. The time of the year when these peaks occur varies geographically. In Texas, a peak is apparent from December to March. In Bharatpur National Park, the breeding season is from October to February, peaking in November and December. Sariska reserve witnesses a similar peak in December and January.
In the mating season, rutting males move about in search of females in oestrus. Males become aggressive and fight among themselves for dominance. These fights are characterised by displays of the enlarged chest, the throat patch and the beard while holding the head upright; and threatening the opponent by running with the horns pointed toward him and circling him. The victorious bull would protect the vicinity of the targeted female from other males. The courtship typically lasts for 45 minutes. The male, stiff and composed, approaches the receptive female, who keeps her head low to the ground and may slowly walk forward. The male licks her genitalia, upon which the female holds her tail to a side and the male gives out a flehmen response. Finally, the male pushes his chest against her rump, and mounts her.

Gestation lasts eight to nine months, following which a single calf or twins (even triplets at times) are born. In a 2004 study in the Sariska reserve, twins accounted for as high as 80 percent of the total calf population. Births peak from June to October in the Bharatpur National Park, and from April to August in southern Texas. Calves are precocial; they are able to stand within 40 minutes of birth, and forage by the fourth week. Pregnant females isolate themselves before giving birth. As typical of several bovid species, nilgai calves are kept in hiding for the first few weeks of their lives. This period of concealment can last as long as a month in Texas. Calves, mainly males, bicker playfully by neck-fighting. Young males would leave their mothers at ten months to join bachelor groups. The lifespan of the nilgai is typically ten years in Texas.

==Threats and conservation==
The nilgai is categorised as of Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural resources (IUCN). While it is common in India, the nilgai occurs sparsely in Nepal and Pakistan. The major reasons behind its decimation in these two countries are rampant hunting, deforestation and habitat degradation in the 20th century. As of 2008, the feral population in Texas was nearly 37,000. Wild populations also exist in the US states of Alabama, Florida and Mississippi and the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, where they have escaped from private exotic ranches. The population around the Texas-Mexico border is estimated to be around 30,000 (as of 2011).

In India, the nilgai is protected under Schedule III of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. Major protected areas for the nilgai across India include: Gir National Park (Gujarat); Bandhavgarh National Park, Bori Wildlife Sanctuary, Kanha National Park, Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve, Panna Tiger Reserve, Pench Tiger Reserve, Sanjay National Park, Satpura National Park (Madhya Pradesh); Tadoba Andhari Reserve (Maharashtra); Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary, Sultanpur National Park in Gurgaon, Ranthambore National Park and Sariska Tiger Reserve (Rajasthan).

==Cultural significance==

Remains of nilgai have been excavated at Pandu Rajar Dhibi in West Bengal, suggesting that they were domesticated or hunted in eastern India in the Neolithic period (6500–1400 BCE) and during the Indus Valley civilisation (3300–1700 BCE) in the Indian subcontinent. There is a reference to the nilgai in the &quot;Aitareya Brahmana&quot; (a Hindu religious text dated 500–1000 BCE), where one of the Prajapatis (progenitor god) is said to have assumed the form of a nilgai:
Nilgai are extensively featured in paintings, dagger hilts and texts from the Mughal era (16th to 19th centuries); their representation, however, is less frequent than that of horses and camels. On being disturbed while hunting nilgai, the Mughal emperor Jahangir recorded his ire:
For centuries Indian villagers have associated the nilgai with the cow, a sacred animal revered by Hindus, and the name (&quot;gai&quot; means &quot;cow&quot; in Hindi) indicates the similarity they saw with the cow. The nilgai is rarely consumed by Hindus due to its religious significance. Tribes such as the Bishnois traditionally take care of wild animals like the nilgai. The nilgai was not widely hunted until the 20th century, when habitat degradation and poaching became rampant. The meat of nilgai is said to be lighter and milder flavoured than blackbuck meat.

===Culling and conservation===
The populations of nilgai in India are so large that farmers in the states of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh have pleaded to the government to cull them. Nilgai herds raid and trample crop fields across these states, often causing food shortages.
Farmers use live electric wires to guard their farms, which kills other animals as well. Farmers in Neemuch (Madhya Pradesh) went on a hunger strike in 2015 demanding compensation for the damage caused by nilgai. Although blackbuck cause a similar problem, the damage caused by them is significantly lower as they merely break off young shoots. A 1990 study suggested culling, building enclosures for the antelopes and fencing off agricultural areas as remedies.

The governments of Bihar, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand have urged the Government of India to declare the nilgai as vermin; the proposal has been implemented in Bihar, where nilgai can now be hunted to minimise the damages incurred by locals. The Uttar Pradesh government has given farmers and firearm licence holders the right to cull the animals. However, animal rights activists in various parts of India were unhappy with the decision. Shivanshu K. Srivastava, a columnist and social activist, wrote that &quot;The culling of nilgais (blue bulls) in Bihar in July 2016 was so deplorable that it doesn&#x27;t need any justification. The excuse given for this slew by the State government, the then environment minister Prakash Javadekar and the judiciary is so illogical that it mocks all the solutions available to stop the nilgais from destroying the farms. We live in the 21st century and culling is only the very last option we have. The farmers can either opt for fencing around the farmlands or if it&#x27;s unaffordable, then the government can give ordinances to relocate them to the forests.&quot; The state governments have attempted other initiatives to curb the nilgai: in November 2015, the Government of Rajasthan came up with a proposal to allow shooting nilgai with non-lethal darts to inhibit fertilisation in their bodies, so as to regulate their increasing populations. As the name &quot;nilgai&quot; appeals to the religious sentiments of Hindus, the Government of Madhya Pradesh has sought to officially rename it (Hindi for &quot;forest antelope&quot;) and the Government of Haryana to rename it as &quot;roze&quot; in a bid to make their culling acceptable.

A 1994 study drew attention to the ecological value provided by the nilgai in ravines lining the Yamuna River. In summer, the faeces of the antelope contained nearly 1.6 percent nitrogen, that could enhance the quality of the soil up to a depth of . Seeds in the droppings could easily germinate and assist in afforestation.

In September 2019, a video surfaced of a nilgai being buried alive with an excavator in Bihar as part of the culling. The state forest department has claimed to have begun an investigation to find those responsible.

<text>Sidesaddle riding is a form of equestrianism that uses a type of saddle which allows riders, generally female, to sit aside rather than astride an equine. Sitting aside dates back to antiquity and developed in European countries in the Middle Ages as a way for women in skirts to ride a horse in a modest fashion while also wearing fine clothing. It has retained a specialty niche even in the modern world.

==History==
The earliest depictions of women riding with both legs on the same side of the horse can be seen in Greek vases, sculptures, and Celtic stones. Medieval depictions show women seated aside with the horse being led by a man, or seated on a small padded seat (a &quot;pillion&quot;) behind a male rider. Ninth century depictions show a small footrest, or &quot;planchette&quot; added to the pillion. These designs did not allow a woman to control a horse; she could only be a passenger.

In Europe, the sidesaddle developed in part because of cultural norms which considered it unbecoming for a woman to straddle a horse while riding. This was initially conceived as a way to protect the hymen of aristocratic girls, and thus the appearance of their being virgins. Further, long skirts were the usual fashion and riding astride in such attire was often impractical, awkward, and could be viewed as immodest. However, women did ride horses and needed to be able to control their own horses, so there was a need for a saddle designed to allow control of the horse and modesty for the rider.

Anne of Bohemia is known to have made the sidesaddle more popular to ladies of the Middle Ages. The type of sidesaddle she used was a chair-like affair where the woman sat sideways on the horse with her feet on a small footrest. The design made it difficult for a woman to both stay on and use the reins to control the horse, so the animal was usually led by another rider, sitting astride. The insecure design of the early sidesaddle also contributed to the popularity of the Palfrey, a smaller horse with smooth ambling gaits, as a suitable mount for women.

A more practical design, developed in the 16th century, has been attributed to Catherine de&#x27; Medici. In her design, the rider sat facing forward, hooking her right leg around the pommel of the saddle with a horn added to the near side of the saddle to secure the rider&#x27;s right knee. The footrest was replaced with a &quot;slipper stirrup&quot;, a leather-covered stirrup iron into which the rider&#x27;s left foot was placed. This saddle allowed the rider both to stay on and to control her own horse, at least at slower speeds.

However, not all women adopted the sidesaddle at all times. Women such as Diane de Poitiers (mistress to Henry II of France) and Marie Antoinette were known to ride astride. Catherine the Great of Russia went so far as to commission a portrait showing her riding astride wearing a male officer&#x27;s uniform.

===Two-pommel design===
In the 1830s, Jules Pellier invented a sidesaddle design with a second, lower pommel to the sidesaddle. In this design, still in use today, one pommel is nearly vertical, mounted approximately 10 degrees left of top dead center and curved gently to the right and up. The rider’s right leg goes around the upright, or &quot;fixed&quot; pommel, which supports the right thigh of the rider when it is lying across the top center of the saddle. The lower right leg rests along the shoulder of the left (near) side of the horse and up against the second pommel (called the &quot;leaping head&quot; or &quot;leaping horn&quot;) which lies below the first on the left of the saddle. It is mounted about 20 degrees off the top of the saddle. This pommel is curved gently downward in order to curve over the top of the rider&#x27;s left thigh, and is attached in a manner so that it can pivot slightly, to adjust to the individual rider. The rider places her left leg beneath this pommel, with the top of the thigh close or lightly touching it, and places her left foot in a single stirrup on that side.

The impact of the second pommel was revolutionary; the additional horn gave women both increased security and additional freedom of movement when riding sidesaddle, which allowed them to stay on at a gallop and even to jump fences while fox hunting and show jumping. With this design, nearly all recreational equestrian pursuits were opened to women, yet they could also conform to expectations of modesty. For example, a world record in sidesaddle show jumping was set at at a horse show in Sydney, Australia in 1915. The leaping horn was the last major technological innovation for the sidesaddle and remains the core of basic design even for saddles of contemporary manufacture made with modern materials.

==Attire==
The riding habit worn by women riding sidesaddle originally was similar to clothing worn in everyday life. Skirts could be protected with a &quot;safeguard&quot;, and elites owned lavish versions of these overskirts. It was not until the second half of the 16th century that a riding habit specifically designed for sidesaddle riding was introduced, though sidesaddle habit design still tended to follow fashion of the day. In 1875, the first safety skirt was introduced and later evolved into the open-sided apron.

Sidesaddle habits, also known as riding habits, developed as women became more active in the hunting field following the development of the leaping horn.. Skirts were gradually replaced by the apron commonly worn by sidesaddle riders today—which is actually a half skirt worn over breeches, designed so the rider does not sit on any apron fabric. The sidesaddle apron can be attached to the right foot by a piece of elastic to hold it in place when riding. When dismounted the apron is wrapped behind the legs and attached to a button on the left hip to give the impression of a skirt.

In the early 20th century, as it became socially acceptable for women to ride astride while wearing split skirts, and eventually breeches, the sidesaddle fell out of general use. The rise of women&#x27;s suffrage also played a role as women rejected traditional restrictions in their physical activities as well as seeking greater social, political and economic freedoms. However, there remained a place for sidesaddle riding in certain traditional and ceremonial circumstances, and aficionados kept the tradition alive until the sport enjoyed a revival in the 1970s.
==Equipment==
Although sidesaddles are still manufactured today, it is a small niche market, and a new model is quite expensive. Thus, many riders who wish to ride sidesaddle are often found hunting for older saddles at antique shops, estate sales, attics or barn lofts. It is difficult to find an antique sidesaddle that not only fits the rider and horse but also is in good condition. Old sidesaddles usually need reconditioning, sometimes even requiring complete removal of the leather and examination of the tree. Antique sidesaddles are frequently a problem to fit, as many are too narrow for modern horses.

Modern sidesaddles are usually based on the Jules Pellier two pommel design. The underlying tree, girthing system, flap or fender design, styling features and type of leather used may differ, however, the structure of the fixed pommel and leaping horn is a consistent design feature across all riding styles. Sidesaddles built on a tree designed for sidesaddle use are properly balanced, but many modern sidesaddles are built on a modified astride tree, which may result in an unbalanced, unridable saddle.

Historical reenactment participants, notably those in American Civil War reenactments, also tend to use the two pommel sidesaddle, since the single pommel sidesaddle that was used into mid-19th century is now regarded as creating an insufficiently secure seat for safe riding. Most sidesaddles have a regular girth or cinch, an overgirth that holds the flaps down, and most have either a back cinch or a balancing strap to hold the saddle down in the back and provide additional stability.

A breastcollar can be added to stabilize the saddle, and, though seen less often, a crupper. There are few differences in the bridles used for sidesaddle and astride riding. Because riders&#x27; hands are farther from the horse&#x27;s mouth as the riders are seated further back than when astride, bridles may require reins that are a longer than standard astride reins. This is most often a problem for western-style riding with &quot;romal&quot; reins, which are sized for astride riders and sometimes require extensions for use by sidesaddle riders.

===Fitting===
The saddle must fit horse and rider. The sidesaddle tree differs from an astride tree, most notably by the structure of the pommels but also due to a much longer saddle point on the left side of the saddle. Horses are fitted in a manner similar to that of a regular saddle; the gullet must clear the withers, and the bars of the saddle should be the proper width to be comfortable on the horse. The seat is measured for the rider in three places: Length, from the front of the fixed pommel to the end of the cantle; width across the widest part of the seat; and the distance across the narrowest part of the seat, called the &quot;neck&quot;. To determine the correct seat length, which is based on the length of the rider&#x27;s femur, a person sits on a stool or chair with their back and hips against a wall or flat surface, and the length of a saddle is ideally one inch longer than the distance from the wall to the back of the person&#x27;s knee. Riders can more easily manage a saddle that is a bit too large than one that is too small, though a too-large saddle may leave the rider with an insecure seat.
== Riding techniques ==
Riding correctly is critical to protect the horse from injury as well as for the safety of the rider. Because both legs of the rider are on the same side of the horse, there is considerable concern that too much weight will be placed on only one side of the horse, which can cause physical harm to the animal. In addition, if a rider is not balanced, a sidesaddle may need to be cinched up far tighter than would a regular saddle, leading to discomfort in the animal..

Correct posture is essential for balance and security in a sidesaddle and is specifically judged in sidesaddle classes. The rider sits squarely on the horse with the spine of the rider centered over the spine of the horse. The shoulders and hips are square to the horse, not twisted or turned off-center. The hands must be carried square to the horse, keeping both reins at the same length and tension.

Only one stirrup is used and it places the rider&#x27;s heel higher on the horse&#x27;s body than when riding astride. The left ankle is flexed and the heel of the left leg is kept down for proper balance, accurate contact with the horse, and correct placement in the stirrup. For modern riders, there are competing schools of thought as to the position of the right leg. Some argue that the right heel is also to be flexed down and the toe up, the same as when riding astride, while others argue that the toe of the right leg should be pointed down. Advocates for each toe position both argue that the position is required to maintain correct balance and make effective use of the leg muscles. In either case, when needed, the rider can squeeze her right (top) leg downwards and against the upper pommel, and her left (bottom) leg upwards into the leaping head to create an extremely strong grip. It is tiring for both the rider and the horse to maintain this emergency hold, however, and most riders rely upon good position, balance, and coordination to maintain their seat.

The spur and the whip are employed as supportive riding aids, in addition to weight and seat, used for cueing, not punishment. The English rider&#x27;s whip is carried on the off (right) side, and is used in place of the rider&#x27;s right leg to cue the horse on that side. The sidesaddle whip is between two and four feet long, depending on style of equipment and competition rules, when applicable. Western riders generally use the &quot;romal&quot; (a type of long quirt attached to the end of a set of closed reins) to support cues in place of the right leg. If the rider wears a spur to assist the use of her leg, she will wear only one, on the left boot.

Riders hold the reins evenly, not allowing one rein to be longer than the other. Most sidesaddle designs also force the rider to carry her hands a bit higher and farther from the horse&#x27;s mouth than in a regular saddle. Because high hands on a direct pressure bit such as the snaffle bit may encourage the horse to carry its head too high, use of bits with curb bit pressure, such as a pelham bit or a double bridle, which help the horse lower its head to a proper position, are often seen in sidesaddle competition.

The horse used in sidesaddle riding will have additional training to accustom it to the placement of the rider and the use of the whip to replace off side leg commands. The horse also may need to adapt to a different and higher hand position. However, most well-trained horses adapt to the basics fairly quickly and generally can be used for riding both sidesaddle and astride.

In the early 1900s, some experts recommended riders periodically change from one side to another, to prevent irregular development of thigh muscles, . However, would be impractical unless the rider had available two sidesaddles, one left-sided and one right-sided.

==Sidesaddle today==
While sidesaddles came to be regarded as a quaint anachronism, some modern riders found new applications in the horse show ring, in historical reenactments, and in parades or other exhibitions. Specialty sidesaddle classes with either traditional equipment or period costume are popular in many equestrian disciplines, including dressage, eventing, show jumping, western pleasure, and saddle seat-style English pleasure. Many horse shows include sidesaddle classes, usually judged on manners and performance of the horse and rider, suitability of specific style, and appointments. 

Sidesaddle riding has also been revived in the fox hunting field, where the tradition is preserved by sidesaddle devotees. A small number of sidesaddle riders have also taken up steeplechasing with the creation of several side saddle steeplechases in Britain and the US. There have also been some flat racing competitions for sidesaddle riders. 

Riders with certain types of physical disabilities also find sidesaddles more comfortable than riding astride, and they are found useful by some people who have lost part of a leg. In addition, the sidesaddle has become a part of some therapeutic riding programs, because the design of the saddle provides extra security to certain types of riders.

=== English classes ===

English sidesaddle classes are based on style and norms found in the hunting field before the Second World War. Dress, appointments, riding style, and even the type of horse used are all judged against a formalized standard for an &quot;ideal&quot; appearance. The riding habit in such classes is the formal attire found in the hunting field, starting with a coat and apron. The apron used is based on the open-sided safety apron developed in the late 19th century. The rider wears ordinary breeches or jodhpurs, over which she will wear the apron, which can partially open in the back. The jacket is usually cut a bit longer than a standard riding jacket. A vest, shirt, choker or stock tie, gloves, boots, and riding breeches are similar to those used when riding astride. For classes on the flat, a derby or top hat is traditional. When jumping, however, tradition gives way to safety, and most riders use a modern equestrian helmet, which is often mandatory equipment in competition rules.

The saddle seat variation of English sidesaddle, now seen almost exclusively in the United States in certain breed shows, allows riders to emulate the &quot;Park&quot; riders who rode flashy, high-stepping horses on the flat, often in public parks. The sidesaddle is essentially the same, and the rider may wear almost the same attire as the &quot;hunt&quot; version, an apron with breeches underneath, but with a coat having a noticeably longer cut, sometimes in bright colors, sometimes with a contrasting lining, and either a top hat or a derby. The shirt and vest will be of the style used in astride saddle seat classes, in that the vest will match either the coat or the coat lining, the shirt is a standard menswear dress shirt, and a &quot;four-in-hand&quot; tie is worn. When show rules permit, some saddle seat style riders adopt a period costume, often based on an antique riding habit from the Victorian era.

=== Western classes ===

The western sidesaddle class is similar to the English class but with a sidesaddle having western design features, and riders wearing western style clothing. Riders generally wear a western-styled apron with belt, worn over some type of breeches or pants, but a modified two-leg chaps design in leather or ultrasuede is sometimes seen, though not legal in some types of competition. Period costumes are also seen in the western show ring. Western riders usually wear a short bolero-style jacket that matches the apron or skirt, often with elaborate decoration, gloves, cowboy boots and a cowboy hat.

A variation to western-style sidesaddle riding is use of Spanish or Mexican style regalia, often based on historic designs.
== Men ==

Novelist Rita Mae Brown once stated, &quot;If the world were a logical place, men would ride side saddle.&quot; There are occasional examples of men riding sideways or sidesaddle on a horse other than for humorous, drag, or satirical purposes:
* During World War II when riders laid field telephone cable from a cable-drum on the back of a galloping horse.
* Sometimes farm workmen riding very wide-backed draft horses bareback to or from the fields found it easier to sit sideways than astride.
* In the Macedonian front in World War I, in Salonica, which was a main Allied base area: Greek soldiers riding on horses which were equipped with heavy wooden packsaddles instead of riding saddles.
* In the Cycladic island of Folegandros, Greece, it is typical to ride side saddle on mules and donkeys as they have a pack saddle. 
*In northern Morocco, where mules are still sometimes used to carry water from wells and for working small farms, sitting sideways on a mule with a packsaddle has been observed.

<doc id="922580" wikidata="Q7074464" url="?curid=922580" title="Oath of Allegiance (Canada)">
<text>The Canadian Oath of Allegiance is a promise or declaration of fealty to the Canadian monarch—as personification of the Canadian state and its authority, rather than as an individual person—taken, along with other specific oaths of office, by new occupants of various federal and provincial government offices; members of federal, provincial, and municipal police forces; members of the Canadian Armed Forces; and, in some provinces, all lawyers upon admission to the bar. The Oath of Allegiance also makes up the first portion of the Oath of Citizenship, the taking of which is a requirement of obtaining Canadian nationality.

The vow&#x27;s roots lie in the oath taken in the United Kingdom, the modern form of which was implemented in 1689 by King William II and III and Queen Mary II and was used in Canada prior to Confederation. The Canadian oath was established at that time in the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot; (now &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;), meaning that alteration or elimination of the oath for parliamentarians requires a constitutional amendment. The Oath of Allegiance has also been slightly altered and made or removed as a requirement for admission to other offices or positions through act of Parliament or letters patent, to which proposals have been put forward for further abolishment or modification.

==Composition==
The present form of the Oath of Allegiance, which derives from that which was, and still is, taken by parliamentarians in the United Kingdom, is:

A person may choose to replace the word &quot;swear&quot; with &quot;affirm&quot; and to omit the phrase &quot;so help me God&quot;. The oath taker is also given the option of either swearing on a holy book or not.

The oath for senators and members of Parliament has stood the same since Confederation; according to Section IX.128 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;: &quot;Every member of the Senate and the House of Commons of Canada shall, before taking his seat therein, take and subscribe before the governor general, or some person authorized by him, and every member of a legislative council or legislative assembly of any province shall, before the lieutenant governor of the province, or some person authorized by him, the Oath of Allegiance contained in the Fifth Schedule to the act.&quot; The oath set out in said schedule is, &quot;I, [name], do swear, that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Victoria&quot;, with the further instruction that &quot;the name of the king or queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland for the time being is to be substituted from time to time, with proper terms of reference thereto.&quot; The oath thus currently reads as follows:

In French, this is:

For those parliamentarians whose religion prohibits the swearing of oaths, there exists a compromise affirmation, first instituted in 1905:

==Purpose==
The Oath of Allegiance was implemented to acknowledge the supremacy of the reigning monarch of Canada; allegiance is to the &quot;natural person of the king [or queen, as the case may be]&quot;, but, it is to them as the personification of the Canadian state. Professor Yan Campagnolo stated, &quot;an oath to the King is not an oath to the person who wears the Crown at a given time; rather, it is an oath to an institution that symbolizes our system of government, a democratic constitutional monarchy. An oath to the King is therefore an oath to our system of government and homeland, not an oath to a foreign monarch.&quot; Along that line, in the military context, specifically, the King is the highest authority in the Canadian Armed Forces. The giving of faithfulness to the monarch in that way is a manifestation of a key responsibility central to the Canadian system of government and serves to &quot;remind individuals taking it of the serious obligations and responsibilities that he or she is assuming.&quot;
Mike Harris, later Premier of Ontario, said in 1993 that &quot;the oath to the Queen is fundamental to the administration of the law in this country. It signifies that, here in Canada, justice is done—not in the name of the prime minister, or the mayor, or the police chief, as in totalitarian nations—but by the people, in the name of the Queen,&quot; while James Robertson stated that the oath was the way elected members of Parliament—who are assuming positions of public trust—promise to carry out their duties &quot;patriotically and in the best interests of the country.&quot; The Federal Court also expressed that giving allegiance to the sovereign was &quot;a solemn intention to adhere to the symbolic keystone of the Canadian constitution, thus pledging an acceptance of the whole of our constitution and national life,&quot; though, also reflecting, &quot;it may be argued that it strikes at the very heart of democracy to curtail collective opposition and incentive for change by demanding loyalty to a particular political theory.&quot;

The relationship between the oath taker and the monarch is a complex one, with roots reaching back to historical periods when a monarch ruled and accepted an oath of fealty from his or her subjects. The modern oath remains both fiduciary and ; mirroring citizens&#x27; oaths to the monarch, the sovereign takes the Coronation Oath, wherein he or she promises &quot;to govern the peoples of [...] Canada [...] according to their respective laws and customs.&quot; It has been said of this mutual verbal contract, &quot;except through the person of the Queen, Canada cannot take an oath to Canadians in return. It doesn&#x27;t exist in the sense that it can take an oath. It is fundamental to our tradition of law and freedom that the commitments made by the people are reciprocated by the state. Reciprocal oaths are essential to our Canadian concept of government.&quot; For members of the Canadian Armed Forces, the oath to the monarch is &quot;the soldier&#x27;s code of moral obligation.&quot;

The oath sworn by lawyers in Alberta includes the phrasing, &quot;I will uphold and maintain the sovereign&#x27;s interest and that of my fellow citizens, according to the law in force in Alberta.&quot; The sovereign&#x27;s interests entail a broad field of liberty for the monarch&#x27;s subjects.

===Those desiring to take the oath===
Anyone who desires to swear or affirm allegiance to the King may, while in Canada, do so before a justice of the peace or anyone else authorized or by commission from the Crown, under the terms of the Oaths of Allegiance Act.

==Administration of the oath==
===Crown appointees===
The Letters Patent issued in 1947 by King George VI outline that the Oath of Allegiance must be taken by a newly appointed governor general and stipulate that the oath must be administered by the chief justice or other judge of the Supreme Court of Canada in the presence of members of the King&#x27;s Privy Council. In the 19th century, the oath was recited by recently commissioned federal viceroys at whatever port they arrived at in Canada. However, the contemporary practice is to swear-in governors general as part of a ceremony in the Senate chamber on Parliament Hill.

New members of the King&#x27;s Privy Council recite, along with the Oath of Office, a specific oath that contains a variant on the Oath of Allegiance, as administered by the Clerk of the Privy Council, usually in the presence of the governor general at Government House (Rideau Hall) in Ottawa. Twice, however, the oath has been delivered in front of the reigning monarch: In 1967, the year of Canada&#x27;s centennial, the provincial premiers then in office were sworn in as members of the Privy Council before Elizabeth II in a ceremony on Parliament Hill and, during her tour of Canada to mark the 125th anniversary of Confederation, new appointees to the Privy Council recited the oath before the Queen at her Ottawa residence. The chief justice of the Supreme Court similarly recites the Oath of Allegiance in front of the governor general.

===Parliamentarians===
The clerk of the House, or an authorized designate, administers the Oath of Allegiance to both new and returning members of Parliament. Failure to take the oath constitutes an absolute bar on sitting or voting in Parliament, along with a denial of the associated salary; this does not mean the person ceases to be a member of the House; simply that they cannot sit or participate in it. In 1875, George Turner Orton, member for Wellington Centre, inadvertently failed to swear the oath. Though Orton did eventually take his Oath of Allegiance, the matter was referred to the Select Standing Committee on Privileges and Elections, which found that the votes Orton cast in the House prior to his swearing the oath were rendered invalid. The only way to change this stipulation would be to amend the constitution; though, it is not entirely clear whether or not this could be done under the general amending formula (through resolutions of the federal Parliament and of the parliaments of at least two-thirds of the provinces having at least 50% of the population), or if it would necessitate the undivided agreement of all the parliamentary houses across Canada, as is required for any constitutional alteration that affects the Crown.
A breach of the oath can also be seen as an act punishable by the denial of the offender&#x27;s ability to sit in the House of Commons. Actions such as making treasonous comments in a time of war could be considered a break of the oath, as the oath to the monarch is considered an oath to the country. But, expressing anti-Confederation sentiments is not, so long as the proponent continues to work for their cause within the laws and customs of Canada. Also, the King could remain head of any new state formed after secession from Canada.

As early as 1867, this notion was tested: Joseph Howe was an opponent to Confederation; but, was elected to the House of Commons and took the Oath of Allegiance, after which he continued to work towards dissolving the union. Later, in 1976, members of the sovereigntist (PQ) were elected to the National Assembly of Quebec; according to press reports, some of those persons swore the oath with their fingers crossed and others later added flippant commentary to their oath, such as, &quot;&quot; (&quot;and also to the king of France&quot;), and, &quot;&quot; (&quot;live the republic!&quot;), or whispered the words, &quot;&quot;. In 2003, Premier of Quebec Bernard Landry, leader of the PQ, added to the oath, &quot;for the duration of the present constitutional order, which will hopefully change one day in a democratic fashion.&quot; None of the actions had any effect on the enforcement of the oath itself, however.

===Canadian Armed Forces members===
Allegiance and loyalty to the monarch, and the manner in which they are expressed, are specifically outlined in the Canadian Armed Forces regulations and subordinate orders. Within the &quot;King&#x27;s Regulations and Orders for the Canadian Forces&quot;, it is stipulated that all Canadian citizens or British subjects who enroll in the forces must take the Oath of Allegiance before either a commissioned officer or a justice of the peace.

Those who are not Canadian citizens or British subjects must recite a longer oath:

The words &quot;so help me God&quot; are omitted if a solemn affirmation is taken.

==Opposition and augmentation==
===Federal===
Amendments to the Oath of Allegiance have been proposed in the federal scope. The difficulty in altering the constitution led members of Parliament (MPs) in Ottawa to table various bills aiming to alter the &quot;Parliament of Canada Act&quot;, instead. While none were ever successful, certain MPs have recited further pledges in the presence of their constituents or added their own pledge after reciting the Oath of Allegiance. In 2005, Senator Raymond Lavigne uttered the words, &quot;and to my country, Canada,&quot; at the end of the Oath of Allegiance, which raised questions from other senators and Lavigne was instructed to take the oath again, without the amendment. Following this, the Senator proposed that the Senate rules be changed to add an oath to Canada after the oath to the sovereign, in the form of, &quot;I, [name], do swear (or solemnly affirm) that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Canada.&quot; The motion never passed. René Arseneault tabled a private member&#x27;s bill in January 2024 seeking to replace the oath to the Canadian monarch with simply a promise to carry the duties of an MP &quot;in the best interest of Canada while upholding its constitution,&quot; without defining what &quot;Canada&quot; means. Pierre Vincent, speaking for Citizens for a Canadian Republic called the oath &quot;colonial, medieval stuff&quot; comparable to a former Mexican tradition of &quot;sacrificing virgins&quot;, while John Fraser, President of the Institute for the Study of the Crown in Canada, called the bill &quot;a stupid idea&quot; and &quot;all based on emotionalism&quot;, saying &quot;I don&#x27;t think we should marginalize something [the Crown] that is an integral part of our system of government.&quot; Barbara Messamore, a professor of history at the University of the Fraser Valley and an expert on the Canadian Crown, defined the move as a &quot;profound change by stealth&quot; and allegiance to Canada&#x27;s constitution and system of government as &quot;pretty significant.&quot; The bill was defeated in April 2024.

All members of the federal Civil Service were previously required to take the Oath of Allegiance before being officially hired; a stipulation that prompted Vincent, who is of Acadian descent and, at the time, a civil servant who refused to swear the oath, to undertake a three-year legal challenge against the Public Service Commission. The latter found that Vincent could keep his job with the Civil Service and, while the Supreme Court did rule that civil servants continued to be employees of the monarch, royal assent was granted to the &quot;Public Service Modernization Act&quot; in 2003, which removed the necessity of the bureaucratic civil servants to take the oath to their employer.

The inclusion of the Oath of Allegiance in the Oath of Citizenship has also met with opposition; though, this was never a constitutional matter, instead falling within the scope of the &quot;Citizenship Act&quot;.

===Alberta===
Thirty two law professors in Alberta sent a letter to Minister of Justice Tyler Shandro, in July 2022, asking that the Executive Council table legislation in the legislature that proposes to remove the requirement that prospective lawyers recite the Oath of Allegiance before being admitted to the provincial the bar. This followed Prabjot Singh Wirring, an articling student in Edmonton, suing the province on the basis that swearing the oath would contradict his religious beliefs. A similar claim against the Oath of Citizenship was made in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in 2007. In that case, the provision to take the oath was upheld. Alberta Crown attorneys have, in response to Wirring, argued the oath to the King is a commitment to the constitution of Canada, including its democratic principles, and is secular; Wirring has, they claimed, a &quot;misunderstanding of the oath.&quot;

Three Indigenous Canadian graduates of law schools in different provinces took legal action, on 7 September 2022, against the Alberta Crown and Law Society of Alberta seeking exemption from having to swear the Oath of Allegiance before being let into the Alberta bar. One of the women, Anita Cardinal, a member of the Woodland Cree First Nation, claimed the Canadian Crown does not have sovereignty over Indigenous peoples, contrary to multiple rulings by the Supreme Court of Canada. Another in the party, Rachel Snow, of the Wesley First Nation, stated she would not recognize the authority of &quot;the system [the legal order of the state as embodied in the monarch] that has caused generational and ongoing harms to her people&quot;; though, Snow believes the oath is to the British Crown.

===New Brunswick===
A loophole in provincial law was discovered by René Arseneault after he, in 1992, opposed taking the oath before being admitted to the bar. He argued successfully in court that the law did not permit the Court of Appeal to refuse his application to the Law Society until he recited the oath. Arseneault became the first member of the bar admitted without taking the oath.

===Ontario===
Ontario Member of Provincial Parliament Dominic Agostino proposed in 1996 that the Legislative Assembly of Ontario follow that of Quebec and add another requisite oath of allegiance to &quot;Canada&quot;, to be taken by MPPs following the oath to the sovereign. However, the Standing Committee on the Legislative Assembly found that the monarch referred to in the Oath of Allegiance was already the personification of the Canadian state and it was thus redundant to offer allegiance to both the Queen and to Canada.

A councillor in Prescott, Ontario, Lee McConnell, proposed in February 2023 that city council send a motion to the provincial Cabinet requesting that a bill be tabled in parliament to amend the &quot;Municipal Act&quot; so as to either remove or make optional the Oath of Allegiance required of all newly elected councillors. McConnell&#x27;s motion suggested, instead, that municipal representatives swear an oath to &quot;the country, province, and community&quot;. None of Prescott&#x27;s other councillors seconded the motion, leading to its immediate failure.

===Quebec===
Early opposition to the Oath of Allegiance was expressed by the inhabitants of the Province of Quebec shortly following the transfer of that territory from King Louis XV to King George III via the 1763 Treaty of Paris. The &quot;Quebec Act&quot;, issued in 1774, subsequently established a special Oath of Allegiance for the Roman Catholics of Quebec that, unlike the one sworn by others, which had remained the same since the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, bore no references to the Protestant faith. It read:

I [name] do sincerely promise and swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty King George and him will defend to the utmost of my power, against all traitorous conspiracies and attempts whatsoever, which shall be made against his person. Crown, and dignity; and I will do my utmost endeavor to disclose and make known to His Majesty, his heirs and successors, all treasons and traitorous conspiracies and attempts, which I shall know to be against him, or any of them; and all this I do swear without any equivocation, mental evasion, or secret reservation, and renouncing all pardons and dispensations from any power or person whomsoever to the contrary. So help me God.

In 1970, the recently elected members of the sovereigntist (PQ) refused to recite the Oath of Allegiance before taking their seats in the National Assembly of Quebec. At the time, all the other parties in the assembly agreed that the oath was outdated and needed to be amended. The &quot;Act Respecting the National Assembly of Quebec&quot; was granted royal assent in 1982, in which a supplementary oath pledging loyalty to &quot;the people of Quebec&quot; was included, though, it does not define what &quot;the people of Quebec&quot; means. The &quot;Members&#x27; Manual of the National Assembly&quot; outlines that this additional oath is to &quot;the people&quot; and constitution of Quebec, distinct from the Oath of Allegiance, which is an oath to the country via the then-Queen. Still, some saw the monarch, in that context, as representative of the Quebec state and not of Canada, taking into account Canada&#x27;s &quot;divisible&quot; Crown.

The PQ and its leader, Paul St-Pierre Plamondon, said after the general election in 2022 that they would not take the Oath of Allegiance upon attempting to take their seats in the National Assembly of Quebec, arguing, &quot;you can&#x27;t serve two masters at the same time.&quot; On 19 October 2022, the 11 MNAs announced they also did not wish to swear the Oath of Allegiance. In response, the President of the National Assembly, François Paradis, asserted that the PQ and MNAs were required to recite the oath or risk expulsion from the legislature. While QS members eventually did swear allegiance, on 1 December 2022, PQ MNAs continued to refuse and were stopped from entering the legislature. The Executive Council, occupied by the party, headed by François Legault, thereafter tabled a bill that purported to amend the constitution of Canada so as to add to Section 128 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;—the clause requiring the Oath of Allegiance for legislators—a statement that the section does not apply to Quebec. That bill passed the assembly with unanimous consent on 6 December 2022. It remains unclear if the law has any effect.

===Prince Edward Island===
Since 2022, Samuel LeBlanc, lawyer of Acadian descent practising mainly in New Brunswick, has refused to swear the Oath of Allegiance required to become a member of the bar in Prince Edward Island, drawing a connection between the modern oath to the Canadian monarch and the involvement of an oath to the monarch of Great Britain in the Expulsion of the Acadians between 1755 and 1764. In June 2023, the Ministry of Justice stated possible amendments to the &quot;Law on Legal Professions&quot; are being evaluated.

<text>Beef Stroganoff or beef Stroganov is a Russian dish of sautéed pieces of beef in a sauce of mustard and smetana (sour cream). From its origins in mid-19th-century Tsarist Russia, it has become popular around the world, with considerable variation from the original recipe. Mushrooms are common in many variants.

==History==
The dish is named after one of the members of the Stroganov family. A legend attributes its invention to French cooks working for the family, but several researchers point out that the recipe is a refined version of older Russian dishes. In Russian the dish is called from the French .
&#x27;s classic Russian cookbook &quot;A Gift to Young Housewives&quot; gives the first known recipe for &quot;Govjadina po-strogonovski, s gorchitseju&quot;, &quot;Beef &quot;à la&quot; Stroganov, with mustard&quot;, in its 1871 edition. The recipe involves beef &quot;cubes&quot; (not strips) prepared in a dry marinade of salt and allspice, and then sautéed in butter. The sauce is a simple roux mixed with prepared mustard and broth, and finished with a small amount of sour cream: no onions, no mushrooms and no alcohol.

In 1891, the French chef Charles Brière, who was working in Saint Petersburg, submitted a recipe for beef Stroganoff to a competition sponsored by the French magazine &quot;L&#x27;Art culinaire&quot;. This led &quot;Larousse Gastronomique&quot; to assume that he was the inventor of this dish, but both the recipe and the name existed before then.
Another recipe, this one from 1909, adds onions and tomato sauce, and serves it with crisp potato straws, which are considered the traditional side dish for beef Stroganoff in Russia. The version given in the 1938 &quot;Larousse Gastronomique&quot; includes beef &quot;strips&quot;, and onions, with either mustard or tomato paste optional.

After the fall of Tsarist Russia, the recipe was popularly served in the hotels and restaurants of China before the start of World War II. Russian and Chinese immigrants, as well as US servicemen stationed in pre-Communist China, brought several variants of the dish to the United States, which may account for its popularity during the 1950s. It came to Hong Kong in the late fifties, with Russian restaurants and hotels serving the dish with rice but not sour cream.

In 1960s United States, several manufacturers introduced dehydrated beef stroganoff mixes, which were mixed with cooked beef and sour cream. It was also available freeze-dried for campers.

==Around the world==

Beef Stroganoff preparation varies significantly not only based on geography, but based on other factors as well, such as the cut of meat and seasonings selected. Meat for the dish can be cut in different ways and is sometimes diced, cubed, or cut into strips. Some variations include mushrooms and onions or other vegetables and varied seasonings such as sugar, salt, black pepper, and bottled marinades (especially Worcestershire sauce) and rubs.

In the version often prepared in the United States today in restaurants and hotels, it consists of strips of beef filet with a mushroom, onion, and sour cream sauce, and is served over rice or noodles. Today, the dish is generally served over wide or twisted egg noodles in the United States. British pubs usually serve a version of the dish with a creamy white wine sauce, whereas more &quot;authentic&quot; versions are often red stews with a scoop of sour cream separately served on top.
&quot;Larousse Gastronomique&quot; lists Stroganoff as a cream, paprika, veal stock and white wine recipe.
The Brazilian variant includes diced beef or strips of beef with tomato sauce, onions, mushrooms and heavy cream. Brazilians also prepare Stroganoff with chicken or even shrimp instead of beef. It is commonly served with a side of shoe-string potatoes and white rice. In Portuguese it is called &quot;Strogonoff&quot; or &quot;Estrogonofe&quot;.

Stroganoff is also popular in Nordic countries. In Sweden, a common variant is &quot;Korv Stroganoff&quot; (), which uses the local &quot;falukorv&quot; sausage as a substitute for the beef. In Finland, the dish is called &quot;makkara-stroganoff&quot;, makkara meaning any kind of sausage. Beef Stroganoff is, however, also a common dish. Diced brined pickles are also a normal ingredient in Finnish Stroganoff.

Stroganoff&#x27;s popularity extends to Japan, where it is most commonly served with white rice, or white rice seasoned with parsley and butter. Its popularity increased dramatically with the introduction of &quot;instant sauce cubes&quot; from S&amp;B Foods. These are cubes with dried seasoning and thickening agents that can be added to water, onion, beef, and mushrooms to make a Stroganoff-style sauce. Additionally, Japanese home recipes for Stroganoff frequently call for ingredients that are outside of Russian tradition, such as small amounts of soy sauce.

<doc id="922586" wikidata="Q486047" url="?curid=922586" title="List of river systems by length">
<text>This is a list of the longest rivers on Earth. It includes river systems over in length.

==Definition of length==
There are many factors, such as the identification of the source, the identification or the definition of the mouth, and the scale of measurement of the river length between source and mouth, that determine the precise meaning of &quot;river length&quot;. As a result, the length measurements of many rivers are only approximations (see also coastline paradox). In particular, there seems to exist disagreement as to whether the Nile or the Amazon is the world&#x27;s longest river. The Nile has traditionally been considered longer, but in 2007 and 2008 some scientists claimed that the Amazon is longer by measuring the river plus the adjacent Pará estuary and the longest connecting tidal canal. A peer-reviewed article published 2009 in the &quot;International Journal of Digital Earth&quot; concludes that the Nile is longer.

While this does tie in with the coastline paradox in that the length increases with the resolution of the measurement, it does not tend to infinity because a river&#x27;s length is not a fractal. However, the path along the river&#x27;s deepest point is fractal in the same way that the coastline is.

Even when detailed maps are available, the length measurement is not always clear. A river may have multiple channels, or anabranches. The length may depend on whether the center or the edge of the river is measured. It may not be clear how to measure the length through a lake or reservoir. Seasonal and annual changes may alter both rivers and lakes. Other factors that can change the length of a river include cycles of erosion and flooding, dams, levees, and channelization. In addition, the length of meanders can change significantly over time due to natural or artificial cutoffs, when a new channel cuts across a narrow strip of land, bypassing a large river bend. For example, due to 18 cutoffs created between 1766 and 1885, the length of the Mississippi River from Cairo, Illinois, to New Orleans, Louisiana, was reduced by .

These points make it difficult, if not impossible, to get an accurate measurement of the length of a river. The varying accuracy and precision also makes it difficult to make length comparisons between different rivers without a degree of uncertainty. There is no strictly agreed upon standard for dealing with the nuances of measuring rivers and as such the true length of a river is not necessarily a single, discrete, correct number, nor is it static.

==List of river systems longer than 1,000 km==
For most rivers, different sources provide conflicting information on the length of a river system. The information in different sources is between parentheses.



===Notes===
*When the length of a river is followed by an asterisk, it is an average of multiple information sources. If the difference in lengths between given information sources is significant, all lengths are listed. But if the lengths from secondary information sources are similar, they are averaged and that figure has an asterisk.
*Scientists debate whether the Amazon or the Nile is the longest river in the world. Traditionally, the Nile is considered longer, but recent information suggests that the Amazon may be longer. Differences in the recorded length of the Amazon mainly depend on whether the course south of the Ilha de Marajó at the Amazon&#x27;s mouth is to be treated as part of the Amazon, or as part of the separate Tocantins River. New evidence, (dated 16 June 2007) obtained from a high-altitude scientific venture in the Andes, claims that &quot;the Amazon is longer than the Nile by 100 km, with its longest headwater being the Carhuasanta stream originating in the south of Peru on the Nevado Mismi mountain&#x27;s northern slopes and flowing into the Río Apurímac&quot;. However, the origin of the river at Nevado Mismi had already been known more than one decade earlier (see Jacek Palkiewicz), and satellite based measuring from this origin to the Amazon mouth has resulted in not more than 6,400 km.
*Generally, the most commonly used/anglicised name of the river is used. The name in a native language or alternate spelling may be shown.

==River systems that may have existed in the past==

===Amazon–Congo===
The Amazon basin formerly drained westwards into the Pacific Ocean, until the Andes rose and reversed the drainage.

The Congo basin is completely surrounded by high land, except for its long narrow exit valley past Kinshasa, including waterfalls around Manyanga. That gives the impression that most of the Congo basin was formerly on a much higher land level and that the Congo River was rejuvenated by much of its lower course being removed, likeliest when Africa split from South America when Gondwanaland broke up due to continental drift, and before that, the Congo would likely have flowed into the Amazon, producing a river around 6000 miles or 10,000 km long.

===West Siberian Glacial Lake drainage===

This river would have been about long, in the last ice age. Its longest headwater was the Selenga river of Mongolia: it drained through ice-dammed lakes and the Aral Sea and the Caspian Sea to the Black Sea.

===Lobourg===
During the last glacial maximum, much of what is now the southern part of the North Sea was land, known to archaeologists as Doggerland. At this time, the Thames, the Meuse, the Scheldt, and the Rhine probably joined before flowing into the sea, in a system known by palaeogeographers as the Loubourg or Lobourg River System. There is some debate as to whether this river would have flowed southwest into what is now the English Channel, or flowed north, emerging into the North Sea close to modern Yorkshire. If the latter hypothesis is true, the Rhine would have attained a length of close to . The former hypothesis would have produced a shorter river, some in length. Current scientific research favours the former opinion, with the Thames and Rhine meeting in a large lake, the outflow of which was close to the present-day Straits of Dover.

<text>Karl Sune Detlof Bergström (10 January 1916 – 15 August 2004) was a Swedish biochemist. In 1975, he was appointed to the Nobel Foundation Board of Directors in Sweden, and was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University, together with Bengt I. Samuelsson.
He shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Bengt I. Samuelsson and John R. Vane in 1982, for discoveries concerning prostaglandins and related substances.

Bergström was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1965, and its President in 1983. In 1965, he was also elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1966. He was also a member of both the United States National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society. Bergström was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh in 1977. In 1985, he was appointed member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. He was awarded the &quot;Illis quorum&quot; in 1985.

In 1943, Bergström married Maj Gernandt. He had two sons, the businessman Rurik Reenstierna, with Maj Gernandt; and the evolutionary geneticist Svante Pääbo (winner of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine), from an extramarital affair with Karin Pääbo, an Estonian chemist. Both sons were born in 1955, and Rurik learned about the existence of his half-brother Svante only around 2004.

<doc id="922591" wikidata="Q488790" url="?curid=922591" title="Guugu Yimithirr people">
<text>The Guugu Yimithirr, also spelt Gugu Yimithirr and also known as Kokoimudji, are an Aboriginal Australian people of Far North Queensland, many of whom today live at Hopevale, which is the administrative centre of Hopevale Shire. At the , Hopevale had a population of 1,005 people. It is about from Cooktown by road. It is also the name of their language. They were both a coastal and inland people, the former clans referring to themselves as a &quot;saltwater people&quot;.

==Country==

The traditional territory of the Guugu Yimithirr speakers extended from the Endeavour River outlet inland, ranged as far north as the mouth of the Starcke river, or, according to Norman Tindale, to the southern vicinity of Cape Flattery. Westwards it reached the source of the Jack River and south to Battle Camp, north-west of Cooktown. Tindale assigned them, in his estimations, an overall domain extent of some . Dialects of the same language were spoken north of Cape Bedford and the McIvor River, and inland as far as the source of the Jack River. 

David Horton&#x27;s 1996 representation of Tindale&#x27;s map shows the lands of the Guugu Yimithirr people extending from south of Hope Vale to an area which covers Lizard Island. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority states on their website that the traditional lands of the &quot;Guugu Yimidhirr Warra Nation&quot; extend from Lizard Island to the Hopevale region. The website &quot;Dingaals Lizard Island&quot; states that the island has been in the custodianship of the Dingaal people (possibly a clan name) for thousands of years. The Dingaals called the island &quot;Dyiigurra&quot;, and the website mentions that &quot;local Dingiil Aboriginal people have also been known to call the island Jiigurru&quot;. According to the Cairns Institute and Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service, the Dingaal people are the traditional owners of the Lizard Island group. 

==Post-contact history==

Lt. James Cook anchored at the mouth of the Endeavour River at the site of modern Cooktown, on 11 June 1770 after their ship, the HM Bark Endeavour was damaged on a reef, and stayed in the area for seven weeks while repair work was done on the hull. Though the modern population was displaced and pushed 30 miles northwards, this was the traditional land of the Guugu Yimithirr. The expedition&#x27;s members found them to be quite friendly, though they initially kept their distance. After a month, the Europeans were approached by five men, and an amicable relationship was established, as they were shown the Endeavour. The day after, things deteriorated quickly when, while visiting the Endeavour they found a catch of local turtles, and expected a share of the harvest, which Cook, already strained to feed his own, declined to do. He offered them bread, which they refused with disgust. Different concepts of hospitality and the rules of sharing clashed. Soon after, the natives set fire to grass in the bay, and in retaliation, some received injuries from shot.

One of the members of the crew, Joseph Banks&#x27;s botanical draughtsman Sydney Parkinson, set down in his journal (published posthumously as &quot;A Journal of a Voyage to the South Seas&quot;) a sketch of the local people. He described them as diminutive and small boned, agile, their skin painted with red and white ochre, with wood-sooty skin and generally given to shaving their hair off. They practised nose piercing. Women wore a feather headdress. They used wood from the &quot;ficus riduola&quot; as a rasp to sharpen their spears, which were tipped with bone. Their languages was quite mellifluous, with clear enunciation.

Captain Cook left a few pigs on the land, and they bred quickly, to become a major local source of food.

The tribes of the area around Cooktown were decimated, the Guugu Yimithirr being &quot;substantially exterminated&quot;, by a variety of factors: large-scale massacres, the kidnapping of women for rape and the abduction of their children, together with the lethal impact of consuming the opium that Chinese contractors paid to them for their work as hired labourers, and alcohol abuse.

On 20 February 1879 there were 28 Aboriginal men shot and drowned at Cape Bedford. Cooktown-based Native Police Sub-inspector Stanhope O&#x27;Connor with his troopers hunted down and trapped in a narrow gorge, a group of 28 Guugu-Yimidhirr men and 13 women. None of the men escaped: 24 were shot down on the beach, while four swam into the sea, never to be seen again.

In 1885 a curfew was imposed on them, disallowing their movement after dusk. In the same year, while delayed on his journey to Kaiser-Wilhelmsland (German New Guinea), the Lutheran missionary Johann Flierl founded the Elim Aboriginal Mission some to the north of Cooktown, at Cape Bedford, and the following year the governance of the mission was assumed by the G. H. Schwartz, who renamed it Hope Vale. He stayed on with his converted congregation right through to the Second World War, when the population was relocated inland from Rockhampton. Schwartz, who had been there since the age of 19 and who had forgotten to take naturalisation, had mastered the language, contributing greatly to the retention of traditional knowledge, was interned as an enemy alien at 74. The colder climate had serious consequences for the displaced congregation, and many died.

==Language==
Guugu Yimidhirr, meaning &#x27;language/speaking (&quot;guugu&quot;) &#x27;this way&#x27; (&quot;yimi-thirr&quot;), was one of the earliest Australian languages to be recorded, since Sydney Parkinson took down a list of 200 words during Captain Cook&#x27;s stop-over in the area in 1770. The major dialects are &quot;dhalun-dhirr&quot;, spoken on the coastal areas, and &quot;waguurr-ga&quot;, the inland vernacular. It is still spoken by approximately 200 people, and was listed by Peter Austin as one of the languages at immediate risk of extinction.

Guugu Yimithirr had several dialects: &quot;dhalan-dhirr&quot; (&#x27;with the sea&#x27;); &quot;wagurrr-ga&quot; (&#x27;of the outside&#x27;); &quot;guugu nyiiguudyi&quot;; &quot;guugu nyalaadyi&quot;; &quot;guugu yinaa&quot; and &quot;guugu diirrurru&quot;. Because they intermarried widely with tribes speaking other tongues, it was not unusual for Guugu Yimithirr people to be familiar with several languages.
===The word kangaroo===
Cook reported sighting on Sunday 24 June 1770 an animal which was:
of a light mouse Colour and the full size of a Grey Hound, and shaped in every respect like one, with a long tail, which it carried like a Grey hound; in short, I should have taken it for a wild dog but for its walking or running, in which it jumpd like a Hare or Deer.
Sir Joseph Banks entered into his journal that the natives called it a &quot;Kangooroo&quot;. The animal was thereafter called by this name by Europeans after settlement began. When Captain Phillip King stopped over on the same coast in 1820, however, and made the same enquiry, he was told that the animal in question was called &quot;minnar/meenuah&quot;. There arose an urban legend that in fact what the word &quot;kangaroo&quot; must have meant, when the Indigenous people of the Endeavour River responded to the incomprehensible English query, was &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot;. Light was shed on the point by the American anthropologist John Haviland, who studied the Guugu Yimithirr language intensively from 1971 onwards. He discovered that in fact a word like &quot;kangaroo&quot; did exist in Guugu Yimithirr, namely &quot;gangurru&quot;. This denoted however a species, the large grey kangaroo, that was relatively rare in the coastal territory, while the other word reported by King was an approximation to their word for meat or edible animal (&quot;minha&quot;). Cook&#x27;s report and reputation as a precise observer was vindicated.

==Society and customs==
Guugu Yimithirr practice certain forms of social avoidance. The language itself has a form of avoidance language in which, speaking in the presence of certain family members (like a man&#x27;s father-in-law or brother-in-law), one must adopt a different vocabulary from that normally employed. In everyday conversation &#x27;the man is going&#x27; is &quot;bama dhaday&quot;. In the presence of certain kin, this must be altered to &quot;yambaal bali&quot;. Speaking was totally forbidden in the presence of one&#x27;s mother-in-law, one being obliged to sit, with bowed head, silently (&quot;guugu-mu&quot;).

The system of spatial coordination inscribed in the language is totally different from that in Western languages, where the reference system is relative with respect to the subject. In Guugu Yimidhirr, as in Kayardild space is rendered in absolute terms, like the cardinal points, north, south, east, west, independent of whether something is in front of, behind, to the left or right of a person. The language thus provides them with a mental map, allowing quite a precise dead-reckoning of all points around them wherever they are. For example, if your Guugu Yimidhirr guest, on leaving your house, had to inform you he or she had left her tobacco behind, they would be required to state grammatically in their native language something like: &quot;I left it on the southern table in the western side of your house&quot;.

<text>Biohazard, subtitled The Chilling True Story of the Largest Covert Biological Weapons Program in the World - Told from Inside by the Man Who Ran It, is a 1999 book by former Soviet biological warfare researcher Ken Alibek that purports to expose the former Soviet Union&#x27;s extensive covert biological weapons program.

The book is a autobiography of Alibek&#x27;s life as a bioweapons developer in the former Soviet Union. It was first published by Hutchinson in the United Kingdom in 1999, and later then rereleased by Arrow Books in 2000.

The book also details the worst anthrax outbreak in history, the Sverdlovsk anthrax leak, which led to 68 confirmed deaths.

<text>Helios-A and Helios-B (after launch renamed and ) are a pair of probes that were launched into heliocentric orbit to study solar processes. As a joint venture between German Aerospace Center (DLR) and NASA, the probes were launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, on December10, 1974, and January15, 1976, respectively.

The Helios project set a maximum speed record for spacecraft of . &quot;Helios-B&quot; performed the closest flyby of the Sun of any spacecraft until that time. The probes are no longer functional, but as of 2024 remain in elliptical orbits around the Sun.

==Construction==
The Helios project was a joint venture of West Germany&#x27;s space agency DLR (70 percent share) and NASA (30 percent share). As built by the main contractor, Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm, they were the first space probes built outside the United States and the Soviet Union to leave Earth orbit.

=== Structure ===
The two &quot;Helios&quot; probes look similar. &quot;Helios-A&quot; has a mass of , and &quot;Helios-B&quot; has a mass of . Their scientific payloads have a mass of on &quot;Helios-A&quot; and on &quot;Helios-B&quot;. The central bodies are sixteen-sided prisms in diameter and high. Most of the equipment and instrumentation is mounted in this central body. The exceptions are the masts and antennae used during experiments and small telescopes that measure the zodiacal light and emerge from the central body. Two conical solar panels extend above and below the central body, giving the assembly the appearance of a diabolo or spool of thread.

At launch, each probe was tall with a maximum diameter of . Once in orbit, the telecommunications antennae unfolded on top of the probes and increased the heights to . Also deployed were two rigid booms carrying sensors and magnetometers, attached on both sides of the central bodies, and two flexible antennae used for the detection of radio waves, which extended perpendicular to the axes of the spacecraft for a design length of each.

The spacecraft spin around their axes, which are perpendicular to the ecliptic, at 60rpm.

==Systems==
=== Power ===
Electrical power is provided by solar cells attached to the two truncated cones. To keep the solar panels at a temperature below when in proximity to the Sun, the solar cells are interspersed with mirrors, covering 50% of the surface and reflecting part of the incident sunlight while dissipating the excess heat. The power supplied by the solar panels is a minimum of 240watts when the probe is at aphelion. Its voltage is regulated to 28volts DC. Silver-zinc batteries were used only during launch.

=== Thermal control ===
The biggest technical challenge was to avoid heating during orbit while close to the Sun. At from the Sun, approximate heat flow is 11 solar constants, (11 times the amount of solar irradiance received while in Earth orbit), or 15 kW per exposed square meter. At that distance, the probe could reach .

The solar cells, and the central compartment of instruments had to be maintained at much lower temperatures. The solar cells could not exceed , while the central compartment had to be maintained between . These restrictions required the rejection of 96 percent of the energy received from the Sun. The conical shape of the solar panels was decided on to reduce heating. Tilting the solar panels with respect to sunlight arriving perpendicularly to the axis of the probe, reflects a greater proportion of the solar radiation. &quot;Second surface mirrors&quot; specially developed by NASA cover the entire central body and 50 percent of the solar generators. These are made of fused quartz, with a silver film on the inner face, which is itself covered with a dielectric material. For additional protection, multi-layer insulationconsisting of 18 layers of Mylar or Kapton (depending on location), held apart from each other by small plastic pins intended to prevent the formation of thermal bridgeswas used to partially cover the core compartment. In addition to these passive devices, the probes used an active system of movable louvers arranged in a shutter-like pattern along the bottom and top side of the compartment. The opening thereof is controlled separately by a bimetal spring whose length varies with temperature and causes the opening or closing of the shutter. Resistors were also used to help maintain a temperature sufficient for certain equipment.

=== Telecommunications system ===
The telecommunication system uses a radio transceiver, whose power could be adjusted to between 0.5 and 20 watts. Three antennas are mounted on top of each probe. A high-gain antenna (23 dB) of 11° beam width, a medium-gain antenna (3 dB for transmission and 6.3 dB for reception) emits a signal in all directions of the ecliptic plane at the height of 15°, and a low-gain dipole antenna (0.3 dB transmission and 0.8 dB for reception). To be directed continuously toward Earth, the high-gain antenna is rotated by a motor at a speed that counterbalances the spin of the probe. Synchronizing the rotation speed is performed using data supplied by a Sun sensor. The maximum data rate obtained with the large antenna gain was 4096 bits per second upstream. The reception and transmission of signals were supported by the Deep Space Network antennas on Earth.

=== Altitude control ===
To maintain orientation during the mission, the spacecraft rotated continuously at 60 RPM around its main axis. The orientation control system manages the speed and orientation of the probe&#x27;s shafts. To determine its orientation, Helios used a crude Sun sensor. Guidance corrections were performed using cold gas thrusters (7.7 kg nitrogen) with a boost of 1Newton. The axis of the probe was permanently maintained keeping it both perpendicular to the direction of the Sun and to the ecliptic plane.

=== On-board computer and data storage ===
The onboard controllers were capable of handling 256 commands. The mass memory could store 500 kb, (this was a very large memory for space probes of the time), and was mainly used when the probes were in superior conjunction relative to the Earth (i.e. the Sun comes between the Earth and the spacecraft). A conjunction could last up to 65 days.

== Mission profile ==
&quot;Helios-A&quot; and &quot;Helios-B&quot; were launched on December 10, 1974, and January 15, 1976, respectively. &quot;Helios-B&quot; flew closer to the Sun than &quot;Helios-A&quot;, achieving perihelion on April17, 1976, at a record distance of , closer than the orbit of Mercury. &quot;Helios-B&quot; was sent into orbit 13 months after the launch of &quot;Helios-A&quot;. &quot;Helios-B&quot; performed the closest flyby of the Sun of any spacecraft until Parker Solar Probe in 2018, from the Sun.

The Helios space probes completed their primary missions by the early 1980s, but continued to send data until 1985.

== Scientific instruments and investigations ==
Both &quot;Helios&quot; probes had ten scientific instruments and two passive science investigations using the spacecraft telecommuniction system and the spacecraft orbit.

=== Plasma experiment investigation ===
Measures the velocity and distribution of solar wind plasma. Developed by the Max Planck Institute for Aeronomy for the study of low-energy particles. Data collected included the density, speed, and temperature of the solar wind. Measurements were taken every minute, with the exception of flux density, which occurred every 0.1 seconds to highlight irregularities in plasma waves. Instruments used included:
* Electron detector
* Detector for protons and heavy particles
* An analyzer for protons and alpha particles with energies between 231eV and 16,000eV

=== Flux-gate magnetometer ===
The flux-gate magnetometer measures the field strength and direction of low frequency magnetic fields in the Sun&#x27;s environment. It was developed by the University of Braunschweig, Germany. It measures three-vector components of solar wind and its magnetic field with high precision. The intensity is measured with an accuracy to within 0.4nT when below 102.4nT, and within 1.2nT at intensities below 409.6nT. Two sample rates are available: search every two seconds or eight readings per second.

===Flux-gate magnetometer 2===
Measures variations of the field strength and direction of low frequency magnetic fields in the Sol environment. Developed by the Goddard Space Flight Center of NASA; measures variations of the three-vector components of solar wind and its magnetic field with an accuracy to within 0.1nT at about 25nT, within 0.3nT at about 75nT, and within 0.9nT at an intensity of 225nT.

===Search coil magnetometer===
The search coil magnetometer complements the flux-gate magnetometer by measuring the magnetic fields between 0 and 3 kHz. Also developed by the University of Braunschweig, it detects fluctuations in the magnetic field in the 5Hz to 3000Hz range. The spectral resolution is performed on the probe&#x27;s rotation axis.

=== Plasma wave investigation ===
The Plasma Wave Investigation developed by the University of Iowa uses two 15 m antennas forming an electric dipole for the study of electrostatic and electromagnetic waves in the solar wind plasma in frequencies between 10 Hz and 3 MHz.

=== Cosmic radiation investigation ===
The Cosmic Radiation Investigation developed by the University of Kiel sought to determine the intensity, direction, and energy of the protons and heavy constituent particles in radiation to determine the distribution of cosmic rays. The three detectors (semiconductor detector, scintillation counter, and Cherenkov detector) were encapsulated in an anti-coincidence detector.

=== Cosmic ray instrument ===
The Cosmic Ray Instrument developed at the Goddard Space Flight Center measures the characteristics of protons with energies between 0.1 and 800MeV and electrons with energies between 0.05 and 5MeV. It uses three telescopes, which cover the ecliptic plane. A proportional counter studies the X-rays from the Sun.

=== Low energy electron and proton spectrometer ===
Developed by the Max Planck Institute for Aeronomy, the low energy electron and proton spectrometer uses spectrometers to measure particle characteristics (protons) with energies between 20 keV and 2 MeV and electrons and positrons with an energy between 80 keV and 1 MeV.

=== Zodiacal light photometer ===
The Zodiacal light instrument includes three photometers developed by the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy to measure the intensity and polarization of the zodiac light in white light and in the 550nm and 400 nm wavelength bands, using three telescopes whose optical axes form angles of 15, 30, and 90° to the ecliptic. From these observations, information is obtained about the spatial distribution of interplanetary dust and the size and nature of the dust particles.
=== Micrometeoroid analyzer ===
The Micrometeoroid analyzer developed by the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics is capable of detecting cosmic dust particles if their mass is greater than 10−15g. It can determine the mass and energy of a micro-meteorite greater than 10−14g. These measurements are made by exploiting the fact that micrometeorites vaporize and ionize when they hit a target. The instrument separates the ions and electrons in the plasma generated by the impacts, and measures the mass and energy of the incident particle. A low-resolution mass spectrometer determines the composition of impacting cosmic dust particles with a mass greater than 10−13g.

=== Celestial mechanic experiment ===
The Celestial Mechanic Experiment developed by the University of Hamburg uses the &quot;Helios&quot; orbit specifics to clarify astronomical measurements: flattening of the Sun; verification of predicted general relativity effects; determining the mass of the planet Mercury; the Earth–Moon mass ratio; and the integrated electron density between the Helios spacecraft and the data receiving station on Earth.

=== Coronal sounding experiment ===
The Coronal Sounding Experiment developed by the University of Bonn measures the rotation (Faraday effect) of the linear polarized radio beam from the spacecraft when it passes during opposition through the corona of the Sun. This rotation is a measure of the density of electrons and the intensity of the magnetic field in the traversed region.

== Mission specifications ==

=== Helios-A ===
&quot;Helios-A&quot; was launched on December 10, 1974, from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 41 in Cape Canaveral, Florida. This was the first operational flight of the Titan IIIE rocket. The rocket&#x27;s test flight had failed when the engine on the upper Centaur stage did not light, but the launch of &quot;Helios-A&quot; was uneventful.

The probe was placed in a heliocentric orbit of 192 days with a perihelion of from the Sun. Several problems affected operations. One of the two antennas did not deploy correctly, reducing the sensitivity of the radio plasma apparatus to low-frequency waves. When the high-gain antenna was connected, the mission team realized that their emissions interfered with the analyzer particles and the radio receiver. To reduce the interference, communications were carried out using reduced power, but this required using the large diameter terrestrial receivers already in place thanks to other space missions in progress.

During the first perihelion in late February 1975, the spacecraft came closer to the Sun than any previous spacecraft. The temperature of some components reached more than , while the solar panels reached , without affecting probe operations. During the second pass on September 21, however, temperatures reached , which affected the operation of certain instruments.

=== Helios-B ===
Before &quot;Helios-B&quot; was launched, some modifications were made to the spacecraft based on lessons learned from the operations of &quot;Helios-A&quot;. The small engines used for attitude control were improved. Changes were made to the implementation mechanism of the flexible antenna and high gain antenna emissions. The X-ray detectors were improved so that they could detect gamma ray bursts, allowing them to be used in conjunction with Earth-orbiting satellites to triangulate the location of the bursts. As temperatures on &quot;Helios-A&quot; were always greater than below the design maximum at perihelion, it was decided that &quot;Helios-B&quot; would orbit even closer to the Sun, and the thermal insulation was enhanced to allow the satellite to resist 15 percent higher temperatures.

Tight schedule constraints pressed on the &quot;Helios-B&quot; launch in early 1976. Facilities damaged during the launch of the &quot;Viking 2&quot; spacecraft in September 1975 had to be repaired, while the Viking landing on Mars in summer 1976 made the Deep Space Network antennas that &quot;Helios-B&quot; needed to conduct its science while at perihelion unavailable.

&quot;Helios-B&quot; was launched on January 10, 1976, using a Titan IIIE rocket. The probe was placed in an orbit with a 187-day period and a perihelion of . The orientation of &quot;Helios-B&quot; with respect to the ecliptic was reversed 180 degrees compared to &quot;Helios-A&quot; so that the micrometeorite detectors could have 360 degree coverage. On April 17, 1976, &quot;Helios-B&quot; made its closest pass of the Sun at a record heliocentric speed of . The maximum recorded temperature was higher than measured by &quot;Helios-A&quot;.

=== End of operations ===
The primary mission of each probe spanned 18 months, but they operated much longer. On March3, 1980, four years after its launch, the radio transceiver on &quot;Helios-B&quot; failed. On January7, 1981, a stop command was sent to prevent possible radio interference during future missions. &quot;Helios-A&quot; continued to function normally, but with the large-diameter DSN antennae not available, data was collected by small diameter antennae at a lower rate. By its 14th orbit, &quot;Helios-A&quot;&#x27;s degraded solar cells could no longer provide enough power for the simultaneous collection and transmission of data unless the probe was close to its perihelion. In 1984, the main and backup radio receivers failed, indicating that the high-gain antenna was no longer pointed towards Earth. The last telemetry data was received on February10, 1986.

== Mission results ==
Both probes collected important data about solar wind processes and the particles that make up the interplanetary medium and cosmic rays. These observations were made over a period from solar minimum in 1976 to a solar maximum in the early 1980s.

The observation of the zodiacal light established some of the properties of interplanetary dust present between 0.1 and 1 AU from the Sun, such as their spatial distribution, color and polarization. The amount of dust was observed to be 10 times that around the Earth. Heterogeneous distribution was generally expected due to the passage of comets, but observations have not confirmed this.

&quot;Helios&quot; collected data about comets, observing the passage of C/1975 V1 (West) in 1976, C/1978 H1 (Meir) in November 1978 and C/1979 Y1 (Bradfield) in February 1980. During the last event, probe detected disturbances in solar wind later explained by a break in the comet&#x27;s tail. The plasma analyzer showed that the acceleration phenomena of the high-speed solar wind were associated with the presence of coronal holes. This instrument also detected, for the first time, helium ions isolated in the solar wind. In 1981, during the peak of solar activity, the data collected by &quot;Helios-A&quot; at a short distance from the Sun helped to complete visual observations of coronal mass ejections performed from the Earth&#x27;s orbit. Data collected by &quot;Helios&quot; magnetometers supplemented data collected by &quot;Pioneer&quot; and &quot;Voyager&quot; and were used to determine the direction of the magnetic field at staggered distances from the Sun.

The radio and plasma wave detectors were used to detect radio explosions and shock waves associated with solar flares, usually during solar maximum. The cosmic ray detectors studied how the Sun and interplanetary medium influenced the spread of the same rays, of solar or galactic origin. The cosmic ray gradient, as a function of distance from the Sun, was measured. These observations, combined with those made by &quot;Pioneer11&quot; between 1977 and 1980 in a distance of 12–23AU from the Sun produced a good model of this gradient. Some features of the inner solar corona were measured during occultations. For this purpose, either a radio signal was sent from the spacecraft to Earth or the ground station sent a signal that was returned by the probe. Changes in signal propagation resulting from the solar corona crossing provided information on density fluctuations.

As of 2020, the probes are no longer functional, but remain in orbit around the Sun.

<text>Hélios 1A and Hélios 1B were French military photo-reconnaissance satellites in which Italy and Spain also participated. Hélios 1A was launched from the Guiana Space Centre, French Guiana on 7 July 1995 by an Ariane 4, riding alongside Cerise, another French military satellite. Hélios 1B was launched on 3 December 1999 by another Ariane 4, also co-manifested with another military satellite: Clementine.

==Mission==
The two Helios 1 satellites constitute the first generation of the program, the development of which was launched in 1985. They operated in a Sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of 678 km. Their instruments offered a resolution of the order of one or two meters on the ground.

Derived from SPOT 4, they retained the platform but were equipped with an attitude and orbit control system (SCAO). This system realized the kinematics of the orientation of the satellite via flywheels. This system allowed fine pointing of the shooting lens for several seconds, thus increasing the quality of the images. The SPOT 4 mirror was also replaced, making it possible to target targets outside the satellite&#x27;s trajectory. The control of the orientation kinematics is ensured by the SCAO via the stellar sensors. Three in number, these are the three cones that we see protruding from the platform. Only two are active at the same time. The flywheels are then controlled by the SCAO which tries to follow a selection of the brightest stars in order to ensure the desired kinematics. This selection of stars is programmed by the ground mission software.

Helios 1A and 1B are distinguished from SPOT 4 by the absence of polychromy of the images (they are in black and white) optimizing the image storage capacity.

Helios 1A was launched on July 7, 1995 by an Ariane 4 launcher. Due to power supply failures, it had to be left to disintegrate in 2005. Helios 1B was launched on December 3, 1999. Helios 1B was voluntarily de-orbited in October 2004 before definitively losing control. The satellite has been the victim of a loss of charge of an accumulator since May of the same year which in turn leads to the premature wear of the others. Helios 1A ceased to be operational in February 2012 and was also purposely de-orbited.

It has been replaced by Hélios 2A, launched in December 2004 on an Ariane 5 rocket.

<text>Peter Mattis is an American computer programmer, entrepreneur, and business executive. He is the CTO and co-founder for Cockroach Labs, a company he co-founded in 2014. His work as a programmer includes launching GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) while still in college, and assisting the source code development of CockroachDB, the namesake software of Cockroach Labs.

==Early life and education==
Mattis attended the University of California at Berkeley. While still a student in 1995, he developed the first version of GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP), along with his roommate Spencer Kimball. Mattis was also a member of a student club at Berkeley called the eXperimental Computing Facility (XCF). Mattis graduated from Berkeley in 1997 with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.

According to Mattis in 1999: 

On free software and the motivations to write it and what makes good and enduring free software: 

==Career==
Mattis was previously employed as an engineer for Google, and is credited for his work Google Servlet Engine as well as helping spearhead Colossus, a new version of the Google File System.

In 2013, Mattis launched the company Viewfinder along with Kimball and Brian McGinnis, formerly of Lehman Brothers. The company developed an app that allowed social media users to share photos, chat privately, and search photo history without leaving the app. The company was acquired by Square, Inc. in December 2013. Mattis moved to Square&#x27;s New York City office where he became a senior member of the company&#x27;s East Coast team.

While at Google, Mattis used a database known as Bigtable, and followed the development of its next generation, known as Spanner. The database organizes data between thousands of servers to allow Google applications to stay online, even if an entire data center were to go offline. Mattis wanted to use this software but found there was nothing available outside of Google as either closed or open source that was similar.

He launched CockroachDB as an open source project on GitHub with Kimball, along with ex-Google Reader team member Ben Darnell. They later formed the company Cockroach Labs in order to accelerate development of the CockroachDB software. Mattis serves as the company&#x27;s chief technical officer and also contributes to the source code development of CockroachDB.

==Personal life==
Mattis is active in CrossFit and was named CrossFit South Brooklyn&#x27;s athlete of the month in January 2014.

<text>The Banaras Locomotive Works (BLW), formerly Diesel Locomotive Works (DLW), is a production unit of Indian Railways situated in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh. DLW was renamed BLW in 2020.

==History==
Founded in 1956 as the &quot;DLW&quot;, it manufactures locomotives which are variants based on the original ALCO. In July 2006, it outsourced manufacture of some locomotives to Parel Workshop, Central Railway, Mumbai. DLW was renamed BLW in October 2020.

In March 2019, it developed the country&#x27;s first bi-mode locomotive, the WDAP-5. BLW today produces primarily the electric locomotives WAP-7 &amp; WAG-9.

==Market==
Besides the Indian Railways, BLW regularly exports locomotives to other countries such as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Mali, Senegal, Tanzania, Angola, Mozambique, and Vietnam and also to a few users within India, such as ports, large power and steel plants and private railways.

<doc id="922636" wikidata="Q3201971" url="?curid=922636" title="PET bottle recycling">
<text>Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) is one of the most common polymers in its polyester family. Its global market size was estimated to be worth 37.25 billion USD in 2021. Polyethylene terephthalate is used in several applications such as; textile fibres, bottles, rigid/flexible packaging, and electronics. However, it accounts for 12% in global solid waste. This is why bottle recycling is highly encourage and has reached its highest level in decades (33% in 2023). In 2023, the US collected 1,962 million pounds of bottles for recycling. Compared to glass bottles, the PET bottle is lightweight and has a lower carbon footprint in production and transportation. Recycling it would only help further the emission reduction. The recycled material can be put back into bottles, fibres, film, thermoformed packaging and strapping.

After collecting the bottles from landfills, they are sorted, cleaned and grinded. This grinded material is &#x27;bottle flake,&#x27; which is then processed by either:
* &#x27;Basic&#x27; or &#x27;physical&#x27; recycling. Bottle flake is melted into its new shape directly with basic changes in its physical properties.
* &#x27;Chemical&#x27; or &#x27;advanced&#x27; recycle. Bottle flake is partially or totally depolymerized then enabling purification. The resulting oligomers or monomers are repolymerized to PET polymer, which is then processed in the same way as virgin polymer.
In either case, the resulting feedstock is known as &quot;r-PET&quot; or &quot;rPET&quot;. This stands for &quot;recycled PET.&quot; The carbon footprint of this recycled PET is significantly lower than PET. In fact, it&#x27;s 79% lower than its virgin PET counterpart. Virgin PET has a carbon footprint of 2.5kg C02 per kg while rPET has a footprint of 0.45kg C02 per kg.

== Bottle manufacturing==
PET and rPET are both used in the creation of bottled water (still and carbonated). Bottled water companies have been voluntarily using rPET in the production and many companies are producing bottles using 100% rPET nowadays. Such companies include Dasani, Fiji and Nestlé Pure Life. Other goods bottled in PET include oil, vinegar, milk, and shampoo. These bottles are closed with polyolefin screw closure with antitamper ring, and have a label which may be printed on paper or plastic and may be glued on. The resin may be colourless or tinted blue, green or brown, or pigmented white.

When manufacturing these water bottles, the energy used to mold the resin into its shape varies based on the bottle shape and its thickness. Some bottles have complex shapes such as Dasani while other bottles have a very simple form such as Smartwater. Therefore, the energy used to create these bottles can range from 8.33 - 20 MJ/kg where the units &quot;MJ&quot; represent megajoules, a unit for energy. The emissions associated with the production range from 0.034 – 0.046 kg C02-eq per 500mL.

== Collection and sorting ==
The empty PET packaging is discarded by the consumer after its use and becomes PET waste. In the recycling industry, this is referred to as &quot;post-consumer PET.&quot; All types of PET packaging, including bottles are usually marked with the recycle symbol 1. The bottles are sent to trash centers (materials recovery facilities) and get sorted out from the other disposable items. There are times when the recyclables are taken to a transfer station first. At this facility, the materials are stored, sorted, and compacted before being transported to a true recycling facility where they are further processed. This step is especially common in areas where MRFs are located far from collection points Here the PET bottles are sorted and separated from other objects and bottles made of other materials

=== Collection and sorting process in Switzerland ===
*recyclables collected from bins and sent to facility
*metal collection
*ballistic sorting (items that fall slower or faster in air such as dust, films, glass bottles and stones are removed here)
*metal separation again
*spectral sorting: sensors detect polymer type and colour
*sorting on a conveyor belt (manual)
*baling: the flattened bottles are compressed into bales for shipment to the processing centre

=== Types of sorting at MRF&#x27;s ===

* Air classifiers: Stream of air directed towards conveyor belt that lifts away lighter materials (paper and light plastics)
* Eddy current / magnetic separators: Use magnets to separate magnetized and non-magnetized metals 
* Manual separation: Workers stationed along conveyor belt that sort out items and contaminants (usually assisting the machines and catching what they missed)
* Optical sorters: A camera or laser sorts items based on color, shape, and other properties (still a new technology)
* Screens: Rotating screens that separate materials based on size (like a colander)

The sorted post-consumer PET bottless are flattened, pressed into bales and offered for sale to recycling companies. Colourless/light blue post-consumer PET attract higher sales prices than the darker blue and green fractions. The mixed color fraction is the least valuable due simply to the fact unlike aluminium, there are few standards when it comes to the coloration of PET. Unlike clear varieties, PET with unique color characteristics are only useful to the particular manufacturer that uses that color. For material recovery facilities, colored PET bottles are therefore a cause for concern as they can impact the financial viability of recycling such materials. The Plastics Recyclers Europe (PRE, Brussels, Belgium), that an upsurge in a variety of PET colors would be a problem because no market exists for them in the current recycling climate. From there, there are two types of recycling; chemical or mechanical.

=== Types of collections: ===
*Deposit: some countries have legislated a deposit for packaging including PET bottles. In the EU, deposit schemes average an 86% recovery rate.
*Collect: waste collectors pick up PET bottles mixed into some other stream (54% recovery in EU).
*Bring: consumers take PET bottles and place them into a container (43% recovery in EU).

Different countries have opted for different systems.

*France: public voluntarily puts PET bottles into containers for plastic bottles and metal packaging. The stream in which PET bottles are collected comprises metallic packaging, plastic bottles, and unwanted contaminants.
*Germany: PET bottles carry a deposit, so PET bottles are collected by retailers. The collected stream consists almost entirely of PET bottles.
*Singapore: plastic bottles are collected with glass bottles. The stream in which PET bottles are collected comprises PET bottles, other plastic bottles and glass bottles, and contamination.
*Switzerland: Retailers contribute a fee to a national operator (PRS) who manages collection bins, sorting and production of rPET flake. The stream in which PET bottles are collected is intended to be PET bottles, but contains other PET packaging and other contamination.
*UK: Plastic producers pay a fee, and collection is devolved to municipalities. The stream in which PET bottles are collected varies by municipality, but always require further sorting.
*United States: curbside recycling to which most consumers have access. The waste hauler brings the recycled material to a material recovery facilities (MRFs) where it is further separated. The PET is then baled and sent on to a PET reclaimer. The PET reclaimer processes the bale, grinding the PET into flakes. Some do additional processing to make ready for food grade packaging.

== Chemical recycling ==
This method of recycling is not very common anymore since it is a more intensive and expensive process. Chemical recycling involves breaking down the plastic into its monomers which can be used as building blocks for new materials. Because of the use of more energy for the chemical reactions to take place, chemical recycling produces more emissions than mechanical recycling. This process is also known as &quot;Tertiary&quot; or &quot;Advanced&quot; recycling. Polyethylene terephthalate can be depolymerized partially or completely to yield the constituent oligomers or the monomers, MEG and PTA or DMT. The main processes are glycolysis, methanolysis or hydrolysis. After purification, the oligomers or monomers can be used to prepare new recycled polyethylene terephthalate (&quot;r-PET&quot;). The ester bonds in polyethylene terephthalate may be cleaved by hydrolysis, or by transesterification. The reactions are simply the reverse of those used in production.

=== Partial glycolysis ===
Partial glycolysis (transesterification with ethylene glycol) converts the rigid polymer into short-chained oligomers that can be melt-filtered at low temperature. Once freed of the impurities, the oligomers can be fed back into the production process for polymerization.

The task consists in feeding 10–25% bottle flakes while maintaining the quality of the bottle pellets that are manufactured on the line. This aim is solved by degrading the PET bottle flakes—already during their first plasticization, which can be carried out in a single- or multi-screw extruder—to an intrinsic viscosity of about 0.30 dℓ/g by adding small quantities of ethylene glycol and by subjecting the low-viscosity melt stream to an efficient filtration directly after plasticization. Furthermore, temperature is brought to the lowest possible limit. In addition, with this way of processing, the possibility of a chemical decomposition of the hydro peroxides is possible by adding a corresponding P-stabilizer directly when plasticizing.
The destruction of the hydro peroxide groups is, with other processes, already carried out during the last step of flake treatment for instance by adding H3PO3. The partially glycolyzed and finely filtered recycled material is continuously fed to the esterification or prepolycondensation reactor, the dosing quantities of the raw materials are being adjusted accordingly.

=== Total glycolysis ===
The treatment of polyester waste through total glycolysis to fully convert the polyester to bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (C6H4(CO2CH2CH2OH)2). This compound is purified by vacuum distillation, and is one of the intermediates used in polyester manufacture (see production). The reaction involved is as follows:

: [(CO)C6H4(CO2CH2CH2O)]n + &quot;n&quot; HOCH2CH2OH → &quot;n&quot; C6H4(CO2CH2CH2OH)2

This recycling route has been executed on an industrial scale in Japan as experimental production.

=== Methanolysis ===

converts the polyester to dimethyl terephthalate(DMT), which can be filtered and vacuum distilled:

: [(CO)C6H4(CO2CH2CH2O)]n + &quot;2n&quot; CH3OH → &quot;n&quot; C6H4(CO2CH3)2

Even though polyester production based on dimethyl terephthalate(DMT) is limited to legacy plants, investments were announced in 2021 and 2022 into methanolysis plants.

=== Hydrolysis ===
Hydrolysis can be done in a neutral, alkaline or acidic environment.

==== Neutral hydrolysis ====
Polyethylene terephthalate can be hydrolyzed to terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol under high temperature (200-300 °C) and pressure. The resultant crude terephthalic acid can be purified by recrystallization to yield material suitable for re-polymerization:

: [(CO)C6H4(CO2CH2CH2O)]n + 2&quot;n&quot; H2O → &quot;n&quot; C6H4(CO2H)2 + &quot;n&quot; HOCH2CH2OH

Avoiding a neutralization step consumes less resource than alkaline or acidic hydrolysis, but there is no opportunity to filter a solution, so mechanical impurities remain with the terephthalic acid. This method does not appear to have been commercialized as of 2022.

==== Alkaline hydrolysis ====

Alkaline hydrolysis is done in an aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide. The reaction yields ethylene glycol and the terephalate salt, in aqueous solution. After separation and filtration, in a second step, the salt is neutralized with strong mineral acid to precipitate the terephthalic acid.

: [(CO)C6H4(CO2CH2CH2O)]n + 2&quot;n&quot; MOH → &quot;n&quot; C6H4(CO2M)2 + &quot;n&quot; HOCH2CH2OH

: C6H4(CO2M)2 + 2HCl → C6H4(CO2H)2 + 2MCl

This method is particularly tolerant of contamination. The use of NaOH as a base is preferred and the addition of ethanol to the medium speeds up the process. Many catalysts have been evaluated in academic studies.

==== Acidic hydrolysis ====

The usual acid employed in this process is sulphuric. Sulphuric acid is corrosive, requiring expensive corrosion resistant alloys to be used in the reaction vessels. Also the recovery of ethylene glycol and the recovery and reuse of the sulphuric acid itself are expensive. These are the likely reasons why acid hydrolysis is not employed commercially in 2022.

==== Enzymatic hydrolysis ====
Most petroleum‐based plastics are resistant to microbial degradation, however the ester groups in PET can be targeted. A number of enzymes capable of hydrolysing PET (PETases) have been reported. The appeal of enzymatic hydrolysis is that it can operate at much milder conditions, reducing energy costs. Enzymes are also very precise in their action, reducing the formation of by-products. In April 2020, a French university in collaboration with Carbios announced the discovery of a highly efficient, optimized enzyme claimed to outperform all PET hydrolases reported so far. Enzymatic recycle may require size reduction and amorphisation prior to the depolymerization reaction.

=== Chemical recycle to molecules other than PET monomers ===
The chemical recycling where transesterification takes place and other glycols/polyols or glycerol are added to make a polyol which may be used in other ways such as polyurethane production or PU foam production
==Mechanical recycling==

The bales consisting mostly of PET mostly of a single colour are delivered to plants where the bottles may be treated by a variety of processes to convert them into usable feedstocks.

The preferred method for recycling this stream is mechanical recycle, a process in which the resin is remelted, filtered and extruded or molded into new PET articles, such as bottles, films strapping or fibers.(Bottles or flakes may be exported from one country to another) 

If the PET feedstock is not pure enough for mechanical recycle, then chemical recycling back to monomers or oligomers is used. Terephthalic acid (PTA) or dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) and ethylene glycol (EG), or bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) are popular reaction products. However, chemical recycling to other products is also done.

===Physical recycling===
For physical recycling, especially for recycle to food contact applications, rigorous sorting and cleaning is required.

In Switzerland, for example, the steps that the bottles follow are the following (similar processes are used elsewhere):
*metal separation (to protect the granulator)
*granulation to &#x27;flake&#x27;
*washing in hot water
*flotation (which separates materials with density &lt;1, notably PE caps and antitamper rings) and sedimentation
*drying
*air current sorting
*washing with caustic soda

This flake is suitable for fibre extrusion.
For &#x27;bottle to bottle&#x27; recycle the following additional steps are required to correct the molecular weight and meet food contact regulations:

*washing and drying under vacuum
*post washing and drying
*flake sorting
*melt filtration and regranulation
*solid phase polymerization
*moulding into preforms

Melt filtration is typically used to remove contaminants from polymer melts during the extrusion process. There is a mechanical separation of the contaminants within a machine called a ‘screen changer’. A typical system will consist of a steel housing with the filtration medium contained in moveable pistons or slide plates that enable the processor to remove the screens from the extruder flow without stopping production. The contaminants are usually collected on woven wire screens which are supported on a stainless steel plate called a ‘breaker plate’—a strong circular piece of steel drilled with large holes to allow the flow of the polymer melt. For the recycling of polyester it is typical to integrate a screen changer into the extrusion line. This can be in a pelletizing, sheet extrusion or strapping tape extrusion line.

====Purification and decontamination====
The success of any recycling concept is hidden in the efficiency of purification and decontamination at the right place during processing and to the necessary or desired extent.

In general, the following applies: The earlier in the process foreign substances are removed, and the more thoroughly this is done, the more efficient the process is.

The high plasticization temperature of PET in the range of is the reason why almost all common organic impurities such as PVC, PLA, polyolefin, chemical wood-pulp and paper fibers, polyvinyl acetate, melt adhesive, coloring agents, sugar, and protein residues are transformed into colored degradation products that, in their turn, might release in addition reactive degradation products. Then, the number of defects in the polymer chain increases considerably. The particle size distribution of impurities is very wide, the big particles of 60–1000 μm—which are visible by naked eye and easy to filter—representing the lesser evil, since their total surface is relatively small and the degradation speed is therefore lower. The influence of the microscopic particles, which—because they are many—increase the frequency of defects in the polymer, is relatively greater.

Besides efficient sorting, the removal of visible impurity particles by melt filtration processes plays a particular part in this case.


In general, one can say that the processes to make PET bottle flakes from collected bottles are as versatile as the different waste streams are different in their composition and quality. In view of technology there is not just one way to do it. Meanwhile, there are many engineering companies that are offering flake production plants and components, and it is difficult to decide for one or other plant design. Nevertheless, there are processes that are sharing most of these principles. Depending on composition and impurity level of input material, the general following process steps are applied.
#Bale opening, briquette opening
#Sorting and selection for different colors, foreign polymers especially PVC, foreign matter, removal of film, paper, glass, sand, soil, stones, and metals
#Pre-washing without cutting
#Coarse cutting dry or combined to pre-washing
#Removal of stones, glass, and metal
#Air sifting to remove film, paper, and labels
#Grinding, dry and / or wet
#Removal of low-density polymers (bottle caps) by density differences
#Hot-wash
#Caustic wash, and surface etching, maintaining intrinsic viscosity and decontamination
#Rinsing
#Clean water rinsing
#Drying
#Air-sifting of flakes
#Automatic flake sorting
#Water circuit and water treatment technology
#Flake quality control

====Impurities and material defects====
The number of possible impurities and material defects that accumulate in the polymeric material is increasing permanently—when processing as well as when using polymers—taking into account a growing service lifetime, growing final applications and repeated recycling. As far as recycled PET bottles are concerned, the defects mentioned can be sorted in the following groups:

# Reactive polyester OH- or COOH- end groups are transformed into dead or non-reactive end groups, e.g. formation of vinyl ester end groups through dehydration or decarboxylation of terephthalate acid, reaction of the OH- or COOH- end groups with mono-functional degradation products like mono-carbonic acids or alcohols. Results are decreased reactivity during re-polycondensation or re-SSP and broadening the molecular weight distribution.
# The end group proportion shifts toward the direction of the COOH end groups built up through a thermal and oxidative degradation. The results are decrease in reactivity, and increase in the acid autocatalytic decomposition during thermal treatment in presence of humidity.
# Number of polyfunctional macromolecules increases. Accumulation of gels and long-chain branching defects.
# Number, concentration, and variety of nonpolymer-identical organic and inorganic foreign substances are increasing. With every new thermal stress, the organic foreign substances will react by decomposition. This is causing the liberation of further degradation-supporting substances and coloring substances.
# Hydroxide and peroxide groups build up at the surface of the products made of polyester in presence of air (oxygen) and humidity. This process is accelerated by ultraviolet light. During an ulterior treatment process, hydro peroxides are a source of oxygen radicals, which are source of oxidative degradation. Destruction of hydro peroxides is to happen before the first thermal treatment or during plasticization and can be supported by suitable additives like antioxidants.

Taking into consideration the above-mentioned chemical defects and impurities, there is an ongoing modification of the following polymer characteristics during each recycling cycle, which are detectable by chemical and physical laboratory analysis.

In particular:

*Increase of COOH end-groups
*Increase of color number b
*Increase of haze (transparent products)
*Increase of oligomer content
*Reduction in filterability
*Increase of by-products content such as acetaldehyde, formaldehyde
*Increase of extractable foreign contaminants
*Decrease in color L
*Decrease of intrinsic viscosity or dynamic viscosity
*Decrease of crystallization temperature and increase of crystallization speed
*Decrease of the mechanical properties like tensile strength, elongation at break or elastic modulus
*Broadening of molecular weight distribution

The recycling of PET bottles is meanwhile an industrial standard process that is offered by a wide variety of engineering companies.

====Processing routes====
Recycling processes with polyester are almost as varied as the manufacturing processes based on primary pellets or melt. Depending on purity of the recycled materials, polyester can be used today in most of the polyester manufacturing processes as blend with virgin polymer or increasingly as 100% recycled polymer. Some exceptions like BOPET-film of low thickness, special applications like optical film or yarns through FDY-spinning at &gt; 6000 m/min, microfilaments, and micro-fibers are produced from virgin polyester only.

=====Simple re-pelletizing of bottle flakes=====

This process consists of transforming bottle waste into flakes, by drying and crystallizing the flakes, by plasticizing and filtering, as well as by pelletizing.
Product is an amorphous re-granulate of an intrinsic viscosity in the range of 0.55–0.7, depending on how complete pre-drying of PET flakes has been done.

Special feature are: Acetaldehyde and oligomers are contained in the pellets at lower level; the viscosity is reduced somehow, the pellets are amorphous and have to be crystallized and dried before further processing.

Processing to:
*A-PET film for thermoforming
*Addition to PET virgin production
*BoPET packaging film
*PET Bottle resin by SSP
*Carpet yarn
*Engineering plastic
*Filaments
*Non-woven
*Packaging stripes
*Staple fibre.

Choosing the re-pelletizing way means having an additional conversion process that is, at the one side, energy-intensive and cost-consuming, and causes thermal destruction. At the other side, the pelletizing step is providing the following advantages:

*Intensive melt filtration
*Intermediate quality control
*Modification by additives
*Product selection and separation by quality
*Processing flexibility increased
*Quality uniformization.

=====Manufacture of PET-pellets or flakes for bottles (bottle to bottle) and A-PET=====

This process is, in principle, similar to the one described above; however, the pellets produced are directly (continuously or discontinuously) crystallized and then subjected to a solid-state polycondensation (SSP) in a tumbling drier or a vertical tube reactor. During this processing step, the corresponding intrinsic viscosity of 0.80–0.085 dℓ/g is rebuilt again and, at the same time, the acetaldehyde content is reduced to &lt; 1 ppm.

The fact that some machine manufacturers and line builders in Europe and the United States make efforts to offer independent recycling processes, e.g. the so-called bottle-to-bottle (B-2-B) process, such as Next Generation Recycling (NGR), BePET, Starlinger, URRC or BÜHLER, aims at generally furnishing proof of the &quot;existence&quot; of the required extraction residues and of the removal of model contaminants according to FDA applying the so-called challenge test, which is necessary for the application of the treated polyester in the food sector. Besides this process approval it is nevertheless necessary that any user of such processes has to constantly check the FDA limits for the raw materials manufactured by themselves for their process.

=====Direct conversion of bottle flakes=====
In order to save costs, an increasing number of polyester intermediate producers like spinning mills, strapping mills, or cast film mills are working on the direct use of the PET-flakes, from the treatment of used bottles, with a view to manufacturing an increasing number of polyester intermediates. For the adjustment of the necessary viscosity, besides an efficient drying of the flakes, it is possibly necessary to also reconstitute the viscosity through polycondensation in the melt phase or solid-state polycondensation of the flakes. The latest PET flake conversion processes are applying twin screw extruders, multi-screw extruders or multi-rotation systems and coincidental vacuum degassing to remove moisture and avoid flake pre-drying. These processes allow the conversion of undried PET flakes without substantial viscosity decrease caused by hydrolysis.

With regard to the consumption of PET bottle flakes, the main portion of about 70% is converted to fibers and filaments. When using directly secondary materials such as bottle flakes in spinning processes, there are a few processing principles to obtain.

High-speed spinning processes for the manufacture of partially oriented yarn (&quot;POY&quot;) normally need an IV of 0.62–0.64. Starting from bottle flakes, the viscosity can be set via the degree of drying. The additional use of TiO2 is necessary for full dull or semi dull yarn. In order to protect the spinnerets, an efficient filtration of the melt is, in any case is necessary. For the time-being, the amount of POY made of 100% recycling polyester is rather low because this process requires high purity of spinning melt. Most of the time, a blend of virgin and recycled pellets is used.

Staple fibers are spun in an intrinsic viscosity range that lies rather somewhat lower and that should be between 0.58 and 0.62 dℓ/g. In this case, too, the required viscosity can be adjusted via drying or vacuum adjustment in case of vacuum extrusion. For adjusting the viscosity, however, an addition of chain length modifier like ethylene glycol or diethylene glycol can also be used.

Spinning non-woven—in the fine titer field for textile applications as well as heavy spinning non-woven as basic materials, e.g. for roof covers or in road building—can be manufactured by spinning bottle flakes. The spinning viscosity is again within a range of 0.58–0.65 dℓ/g.

One field of increasing interest where recycled materials are used is the manufacture of high-tenacity packaging stripes, and monofilaments. In both cases, the initial raw material is a mainly recycled material of higher intrinsic viscosity. High-tenacity packaging stripes as well as monofilament are then manufactured in the melt spinning process.

=====Drying=====
PET polymer is very sensitive to hydrolytic degradation, resulting in severe reduction in its molecular weight, thereby adversely affecting its subsequent melt processability. Therefore, it is essential to dry the PET flakes or granules to a very low moisture level prior to melt extrusion.

PET must be dried to &lt;100 parts per million (ppm) moisture and maintained at this moisture level to minimize hydrolysis during melt processing.

Dehumidifying Drying – These types of dryers circulate hot and de-humidified dry air onto the resin, suck the air back, dry it and then pump again in a closed loop operation. This process reduces moisture level in the PET down to 50ppm or lower. The efficiency of moisture removal depends on the air dew point. If the air dew point is not good, then some moisture remains in the chips and cause IV loss during processing.
Infrared Drying polyester pellets and flakes – A new type of dryer has been introduced in recent years, using Infrared drying (IRD). Due to the high rate of energy transfer with IR heating in combination with the specific wavelength used, the energy costs involved with these systems can be greatly reduced, along with the size. Polyester can be dried and amorphous flake crystallized and dried within only about 15 minutes down to a moisture level of approx. 300ppm in one step, and down to &lt;50 ppm using a buffer hopper to complete the drying in typically under 1 hour

== Global statistics ==
Worldwide, approximately 7.5 million tons of PET were collected in 2011. This gave 5.9 million tons of flake. In 2009 3.4 million tons were used to produce fibre, 500,000 tons to produce bottles, 500,000 tons to produce APET sheet for thermoforming, 200,000 tons to produce strapping tape and 100,000 tons for miscellaneous applications. Thus only approximately 15% of collected PET bottles were actually recycled into new bottles, the rest being used in generally non-recyclable products.

Petcore, the European trade association that fosters the collection and recycling of PET, reported that in the EU 28+2, out of 3.4 Mt bottles sold, 2.1Mt of PET bottles were collected in 2018 (so around 2/3). 1.35Mt of r-PET were produced for which the end uses were:
* 30% sheets &amp; films (half for food contact). (2010: 22%)
* 28% bottles (half for food contact). (2010: 25%)
* 24% fibres (2010: 38%)
* 10% strapping (2010: 10%)
* 8% other

NAPCOR reported that for the US and Canada in 2018:

out of 3 Mt bottles sold, 900kt of PET bottles (up from 600kt in 2008) were collected in 2018 (so around 1/3). 700kt of r-PET were produced for which the end uses were:
* 15% sheets &amp; films
* 35% bottles (1/5 for food contact).
* 40% fibres 
* 8% strapping
* 1% other

In 2019, 81% of the PET bottles sold in Switzerland were recycled, as in 2012.

In 2018, 90% of the PET bottles sold in Finland were recycled. The high rate of recycling is mostly result of the deposit system in use. The law demands a tax of €0,51 /l for bottles and cans that are not part of a refund system. Thus encouraged by the law, products are included to have a 10¢ to 40¢ deposit that is paid to the recycler of the can or bottle.

=== rPET end use in 2020 (total of 1,805 million pounds) ===

* 38% fiber
* 34% beverage bottles
* 14% sheet &amp; film
* 7% non-food bottles
* 5% strapping
* 2% other

PET bottles recycle-rate globally
==Uses==

===Re-use of PET bottles===

In 2019, 2 billion PET bottles were refilled with mineral water in Germany. There is a plan to make these refillable bottles from rPET.

PET bottles are also repurposed for various uses, including for use in school projects, and for use in solar water disinfection in developing nations, in which empty PET bottles are filled with water and left in the sun to allow disinfection by ultraviolet radiation. PET is useful for this purpose because many other materials (including window glass) that are transparent to visible light are opaque to ultraviolet radiation.

A novel use is as a building material in third-world countries. 
According to online sources, the bottles, in a labor-intensive process, are filled with sand, then stacked and either mudded or cemented together to form a wall. Some of the bottles can be filled instead with air or water, to admit light into the structure.

===Fibres===

Most recycled PET is used as apparel fiber. However rPET has also been sold in the form of carpet fiber. Mohawk Industries released everSTRAND in 1999, a 100% post-consumer recycled content PET fiber. Since that time, more than 17 billion bottles have been recycled into carpet fiber. Pharr Yarns, a supplier to numerous carpet manufacturers including Looptex, Dobbs Mills, and Berkshire Flooring, produces a BCF (bulk continuous filament) PET carpet fiber containing a minimum of 25% post-consumer recycled content.

=== Energy recovery ===
If it not possible to recycle PET bottles for whatever reason, PET works well as a fuel in waste to energy plants, composed as it is of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, with only trace amounts of catalyst elements (but no sulfur). PET has the energy content of soft coal.

==Life cycle analysis==
Studies have shown that mechanical recycle has a lower environmental impact than incineration, due to avoided new raw material production.

One study for the USA territory in 2018 concluded that recycle PET vs virgin gave reductions in environmental footprint (all forms are covered but bottles dominate the PET stream). Assuming that virgin PET will be used regardless of the existence of recycling:

*Energy 70 → 15 MJ/kg
*Water 9.9 → 10.3 L/kg (this increase due to the intense washing required for mechanical recycle)
*Greenhouse gas emissions 2.8 → 0.9 kgCO2 /kg

<doc id="922638" wikidata="Q156034" url="?curid=922638" title="Pioneer Corporation">
<text>, commonly referred to as Pioneer, is a Japanese multinational corporation based in Tokyo, that specializes in digital entertainment products. The company was founded by Nozomu Matsumoto on January 1, 1938 in Tokyo as a radio and speaker repair shop. Its current president is Shiro Yahara.

Pioneer played a role in the development of interactive cable TV, the LaserDisc player, the first automotive Compact Disc player, the first detachable face car stereo, Supertuner technology, DVD and DVD recording, the first AV receiver with Dolby Digital, plasma display (with the last 2 years of plasma models being branded as Kuro, lauded for their outstanding black levels) and Organic LED display (OLED). The company works with optical disc and display technology and software products and is also a manufacturer. BMW, Volkswagen Group and Daimler AG of Germany jointly acquired a 3% ownership stake in Pioneer through a joint venture company called Here B.V. Most of Pioneer&#x27;s shares are held by Mitsubishi.

In March 2010, Pioneer stopped producing televisions as announced on 12 February 2009. On June 25, 2009, Sharp Corporation agreed to form a joint venture on their optical business to be called Pioneer Digital Design and Manufacturing Corporation. In September 2014, Pioneer agreed to sell Pioneer Home Electronics (Home A/V) to Onkyo, and in March 2015, Pioneer sold its DJ equipment business division to KKR, which resulted in the establishment of Pioneer DJ as a separate entity, independent of Pioneer. In June 2021, Voxx International announced that it had finalized a licensing agreement with the Pioneer and Pioneer Elite brands &quot;for all markets, except China&quot; as part of their acquisition of Onkyo.

*October 2020: A significant incident occurred that impacted Pioneer Corporation&#x27;s ability to provide replacement logic boards for flagship digital mixers. During a three-day inferno, AKM&#x27;s semiconductor factory, a key supplier for Pioneer&#x27;s components, was completely burned down. This unfortunate event had a negative effect on Pioneer&#x27;s supply chain, leading to extended delays in replacing logic boards for their equipment. As of 2023, the replacement of a logic board still takes at least 7 months due to the aftermath of the fire. Despite these challenges, Pioneer continued to release and sell new equipment that used the same shortage-affected chips. This situation left consumers with limited options, as they faced extended waiting times for repairs. This incident also raised concerns regarding Pioneer&#x27;s compliance with the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, and gigging professionals experienced missed opportunities for wealth generation due to the prolonged equipment downtime. The situation has generated speculation about the possibility of class action lawsuits arising from Pioneer&#x27;s perceived negligence and unwillingness to allocate a suitable number of new chips to address the needs of purchased boards requiring repair.(AKM, 2020; Korosec, 2021; Pioneer DJ, 2023)

<doc id="922640" wikidata="Q1503180" url="?curid=922640" title="Laurie Records">
<text>Laurie Records was an American record label established in New York City in 1958, by brothers Robert and Gene Schwartz, and Allan I. Sussel. Among the recording artists on Laurie&#x27;s roster were Dion and the Belmonts (both together and as separate acts), The Chiffons, The Jarmels, The Mystics, Bobby Goldsboro, and The Royal Guardsmen.

==History==
Sussel&#x27;s earlier record company, Jamie Records (named after his elder daughter), had been unsuccessful, and as a result, Sussel (1924–2003) joined forces with Gene Schwartz (1920–1999) to found Laurie Records, named after his other daughter, Laura Sue Sussel. By the early 1960s, Elliot Greenberg, an arranger and friend of Schwartz&#x27;s, gained a 12% ownership of the company, and Gene&#x27;s younger brother Bob Schwartz also became involved. Songwriter Ernie Maresca also played an active role in the company. The company grew to include subsidiary labels, most notably Andie Records, named after Sussel&#x27;s youngest daughter, Andrea Jo Sussel; it later changed its name to Rust Records.

Dion and the Belmonts were responsible for the first of Laurie&#x27;s hit singles with their 1958 doo-wop song, &quot;I Wonder Why&quot;. Using top New York session musicians in leading recording studios, and produced by Gene Schwartz, Dion and the Belmonts had several national hits on Laurie. When Dion started a solo career, the hits on Laurie continued with &quot;Runaround Sue&quot; and &quot;The Wanderer&quot;. The label had continuing success especially with the Chiffons (&quot;He&#x27;s So Fine&quot; and &quot;One Fine Day&quot;, both 1963), and the Royal Guardsmen (&quot;Snoopy vs. the Red Baron&quot;, 1966). Then, with Dion&#x27;s return to the company after several years with Columbia, he had further success with &quot;Abraham, Martin and John&quot; (1968). The company also licensed English records during the British Invasion period, including &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Sun Catch You Crying&quot; (1964) and &quot;Ferry Cross the Mersey&quot; (1965) by Gerry and the Pacemakers. Jo Siopis, a well known record producer and wife of Gerry &amp; the Pacemakers&#x27; bass player, Les Chadwick, was instrumental in the distribution of Laurie Records albums in the United States.

Being a small independent record label, Laurie&#x27;s chart successes usually occurred one at a time and, for the most part, with one-off hits, as was the case with the Mystics, Randy &amp; the Rainbows, and the Jarmels. Another sizable hit for the label was the controversial song &quot;Once You Understand&quot;, written and produced by the songwriting team of Lou Stallman and Bobby Susser and released by the duo in 1971 under the pseudonym Think. In 1966, Laurie released a psychedelic single, &quot;Charity&quot; by the Gray Things, which appears on multiple compilation albums, including &quot;Mindrocker&quot;, a 13-CD anthology of US 1960s psychedelic recordings released in Germany in 1982. &quot;Charity&quot; was issued in limited quantities.

The label also distributed records under several subsidiary labels, including Rust, Legrand, Calico, President, Providence, Dolphin (not to be confused with the Liberty-owned Dolphin/Dolton label).

Laurie changed its name in the early 1980s to 3C Records. 3C stands for Continental Communications Corporation and the master recordings that 3C produced are owned by the Capitol Records unit of Universal Music Group.

==Label variations==
The label variations for Laurie singles were of three types: First, a grey label with Laurie Records written across the top. This was used for first release only, #3013. It then changed to a sky blue label, with the same basic printing of Laurie Records, from #3013 thru #3020. After the first few singles had been released, it changed to the typically recognized label of four red corners with the black square at the hole punch, with Laurie written at the top, from #3021 onward. Of those earlier releases, only #3013 and #3015, both releases by Dion &amp; the Belmonts, were regular re-issues as part of the more familiar label design.

<text>Steyning ( ) is a town and civil parish in the Horsham district of West Sussex, England. It is located at the north end of the River Adur gap in the South Downs, north of the coastal town of Shoreham-by-Sea.

The smaller villages of Bramber and Upper Beeding constitute, with Steyning, a built-up area at this crossing-point of the river.

== Demography ==
The parish has a land area of . In the 2001 census 5,812 people lived in 2,530 households, of whom 2,747 were economically active.

== History ==
===Saxon===

Steyning has existed since Anglo-Saxon times. Legend has it that St Cuthman built a church, at one time dedicated to him, later to St Andrew, and now jointly to St Andrew and St Cuthman, where he stopped after carrying his mother in a wheelbarrow. Several of the signs that can be seen on entering Steyning bear an image of his feat. King Alfred the Great&#x27;s father, Æthelwulf of Wessex, was originally buried in that church, before being transferred to Winchester – a Saxon grave slab (possibly his) remains in the church porch.

===Norman===
To thank his Norman protectors for refuge during his exile, Edward the Confessor granted his royal minster church in Steyning, with its large and wealthy manor lands, to the Abbey Church of the Holy Trinity at Fécamp, to take effect after the death of Aelfwine, the Bishop of Winchester, who had charge of Steyning. The bishop died in 1047 and ecclesiastical jurisdiction then passed directly to the Pope. (In the same way, Fécamp Abbey itself answered to no Norman bishop, only to the Pope.) This was confirmed in a charter by William. Confirming the gift of Steyning, made by Edward the Confessor, this charter acquitted the grantees of all earthly service and subjection to barons, princes and others, and gave them all royal liberties, custom and justice over all matters arising in their land, and threatened any who should infringe these liberties with an amercement of £100 of gold.
This was an addition to the nearby port with land around Rye, Winchelsea and Hastings, already given to the same Abbey by King Cnut, to honour a promise made by his wife Emma of Normandy&#x27;s first husband King Aethelred. By then Steyning was already a thriving and important port with a market, a royal mint, the church founded by St Cuthman and one other church, as Domesday Book relates 60 years later. Godwin, Earl of Wessex expelled the Norman monks in 1052 and seized Steyning for himself, and his son Harold decided to keep it upon his accession. This made commercial and strategic sense as Harold did not want a Norman toehold in a potential invasion port, but William responded by swearing on a knife before setting out for England to recover it for the monks:

:&quot;Of the land of Steyning [county of Sussex]; the Duke gave seisin to the Church by the token of a knife, before he went to England; the grant to take effect if God should give him victory in England&quot;.

:Witnesses: Aymeri the vicomte; Richard fitzGilbert; Pons.
This gained him a ship from Fécamp and, upon his victory at Hastings, he honoured his promise and returned it to the monks. However, its strategic importance made William place William de Braose in a new castle at nearby Bramber, who began a vigorous boundary dispute and power tussle with the monks, William&#x27;s settlement having lacked definite terms in the first place. Domesday Book, completed in 1086, brought this to a head. It found that de Braose had built a bridge at Bramber and demanded tolls from ships travelling further along the river to the port at Steyning. The monks challenged Bramber&#x27;s right to bury its parishioners in the churchyard at William de Braose&#x27;s new church of St Nicholas, and demanded its burial fees, despite it being built to serve the castle not the town. The monks produced forged documents to defend their position and were unhappy with the failure of their claim on Hastings. In 1086 the king called his sons, barons and bishops to court (the last time an English king presided personally, with his full court, to decide a matter of law) to settle this. It took a full day, and the Abbey won over the court, forcing de Braose to curtail his bridge tolls, give up various encroachments onto the abbey&#x27;s lands and organise a mass exhumation and transfer of all Bramber&#x27;s dead to the churchyard of Saint Cuthman&#x27;s Church in Steyning.

===Mid to Late Medieval===

Even the 1086 judgment did not settle the Steyning versus Bramber dispute once and for all; it continued for centuries afterwards, exacerbated by the Lord of Bramber founding his own religious establishments in his neighbouring parish. Meanwhile, in the 14th century, the River Adur began to silt up and the town&#x27;s use as a port became difficult leading to a loss of trade and population. The monks of Fécamp Abbey retained control of Steyning until the 15th century, and re-dedicated the church of St Cuthman to St Andrew in the 13th century.

Steyning began returning two members of parliament from 1278 and as a rotten borough made up of a depopulated port became similar to Dunwich until the Reform Act 1832.

===17th century===
In 1614, William Holland, Alderman of Chichester founded and endowed Steyning Grammar School.

===19th century===
The Steyning Line railway from London to Shoreham arrived in Steyning in 1861 and a station was opened to serve the town. The railway remained in service for over a century, closing in 1966 as result of the Beeching Axe. The route of the railway line has since been converted into a footpath and cycleway known as the Downs Link. The nearest railway station to the town today is Shoreham-by-Sea, some 5–6 miles away by road.

The Old Town Hall, currently used as an estate agents, at 38 High Street, was built in 1886.

The legendary Irish politician Charles Stewart Parnell married &#x27;Kitty&#x27; O&#x27;Shea (niece of Lord Hatherley) here in 1891, the culmination of an adulterous affair that saw his fall from power, catastrophically dividing Irish politics.

Besides much agriculture, brewing, a tannery (Tanyard Lane) and, to a small extent, brickmaking, more than 25 men were employed in sheep related trades as fellmongers, four or more were parchment makers, five were millers and there was a surgeon, James M. Burfield an oil painter, and a watch maker in the town during the 1881 census.

==Modern town==
Steyning has three pubs: the Star Inn, the Chequer Inn and the White Horse, as well as a number of restaurants and cafes. A fourth pub, the Grade II listed Norfolk Arms, closed in 2021., In addition there are a number of shops, a health centre, a public library and the Steyning Museum. The leisure centre was built with National Lottery funding.

A spring fair is held on the Spring bank holiday (the last Monday in May).

The Monarch&#x27;s Way long-distance footpath skirts the southern end of the town.

Steyning continues to be served by regular public transport. Bus operator Brighton &amp; Hove operates route 2 hourly to Steyning from Rottingdean via Brighton, Hove and Shoreham-by-Sea.

==Schools==
The town is home to Steyning Grammar School, now a comprehensive school of 2,500 pupils founded in the Stuart period, see above, with a sixth form comprising over 400 pupils. The school has a catchment area that extends as far as Dial Post and sometimes Worthing. It also has a primary school (400 pupils) and a pre-school.

==Steyning Festival==
The Steyning Festival was founded in 2006. The event is biennial and runs for two weeks at the end of May/start of June. It includes theatre, music, literature, talks, walks and community events.

In 2009, the Steyning Festival was awarded a lottery grant to bring international artist and psychogeographer Chris Dooks to Steyning for a month-long residency, resulting in a free MP3 tour.

==Sport and leisure==

There is a long established cricket club near the police station. 
Steyning has a non-league football club called Steyning Town Community Football Club, who play at the Shooting Field. The town also has its own leisure centre.

Steyning Athletic Club, established in 1951, offers a variety of sports to members - including Running, Swimming, Cycling, Race walking, Circuits/Fitness and Triathlon. Annual Club events include the Roundhill Romp (10k running race that is part of the Sussex Fun Run League) and the Steyning Stinger (Full Marathon and Half Marathon on the South Downs).

Steyning is also host to a detachment of the Army Cadet Force, a national voluntary youth organisation sponsored by the MoD.

<text>Zoila Augusta Emperatriz Chávarri del Castillo (born Zoila Emperatriz Chávarri Castillo; September 13, 1922 – November 1, 2008), known as Yma Sumac (or Imma Sumack), was a Peruvian vocalist, composer, producer, actress and model. She won a Guinness World Record for the Greatest Range of Musical Value in 1956. &quot;Ima sumaq&quot; means &quot;how beautiful&quot; in Quechua. She has also been called Queen of Exotica and is considered a pioneer of world music. Her debut album, &quot;Voice of the Xtabay&quot; (1950), peaked at number one in the Billboard 200, selling a million copies in the United States, and its single, &quot;Virgin of the Sun God (Taita Inty)&quot;, reached number one on the UK Singles Chart, becoming an international success in the 1950s. Albums like &quot;Legend of the Sun Virgin&quot; (1952), &quot;Fuego del Ande&quot; (1959) and &quot;Mambo!&quot; (1955), were other successes.

In 1951, Sumac became the first Latin American and Peruvian female singer to debut on Broadway. In &quot;Chuncho (The Forest Creatures)&quot; (1953), she developed her own technical singing, named &quot;double voice&quot; or &quot;triple coloratura&quot;. During the same period, she performed in Carnegie Hall and Lewisohn Stadium. In 1960 she became the first Latin American woman to get a phonograph record star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Afterwards she toured the Soviet Union, selling more than 20 million tickets. According to &quot;Variety&quot; in 1974, Sumac had more than 3,000 concerts &quot;covering the entire globe&quot;, breaking any previous records by a performer. Fashion magazine &quot;V&quot; listed her as one of the 9 international fashion icons of all time in 2010. She has sold over 40 million records, which makes her the best-selling Peruvian singer in history.

==Early life==
Sumac was born Zoila Emperatriz Chávarri Castillo on September 13, 1922 in Callao. Then the family (a middle class one) moved to Cajamarca, where she spent her childhood. Her parents were the civic leader Sixto Chávarri (Cajamarca) and the schoolteacher Emilia Castillo (Ancash). Sumac was the youngest of six children. Growing up with the air of the Andean mountains, imitating the birds and other animals, she was &quot;unintentionally making&quot; her huge vocal range. In 1934, she traveled to live in Lima with her relatives. After being privately tutored from the age of 5, she entered a Catholic school in 1935.

==Career==

Probably Sumac&#x27;s first public appearance was on August 16, 1938, with Moises Vivanco in a religious festival at Callao. She graduated high school in 1940. She recorded at least 18 tracks of Peruvian folk songs in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1943. These early recordings for the Odeon label featured composer Moisés Vivanco&#x27;s troupe &quot;Compañía Peruana de Arte&quot;, of 16 Peruvian dancers, singers, and musicians.

She was discovered by Les Baxter and signed by Capitol Records in 1950, at which time her stage name became Yma Sumac. Her first album, &quot;Voice of the Xtabay&quot;, launched a period of fame that included performances at the Hollywood Bowl and Carnegie Hall.

In 1950, she made her first tour to Europe and Africa, and debuted at the Royal Albert Hall in London and the Royal Festival Hall before the future Queen of England. She presented more than 80 concerts in London and 16 concerts in Paris. A second tour took her to the Far East: Persia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Burma, Thailand, Sumatra, the Philippines, and Australia. Her fame in countries like Greece, Israel and Russia made her change her two-week stay to six months. During the 1950s, she produced a series of best-selling recordings of lounge music featuring Hollywood-style arrangements of Incan and South American folk songs, working with Les Baxter and Billy May. The combination of her extraordinary voice, exotic looks, and stage personality made her a hit with American audiences. Sumac appeared in a Broadway musical, &quot;Flahooley&quot;, in 1951, as a foreign princess who brings Aladdin&#x27;s lamp to an American toy factory to have it repaired. The show&#x27;s score was by Sammy Fain and Yip Harburg, but her three numbers were the work of Vivanco, with one co-written by Vivanco and Fain. &quot;Flahooley&quot; closed quickly, but the Capitol recording of the show continues to sell well as a cult classic, in part because it also marked the Broadway debut of Barbara Cook.

The 1950s were the years of Sumac&#x27;s greatest popularity; She played Carnegie Hall, the Roxy Theatre with Danny Kaye, Las Vegas nightclubs and concert tours of South America and Europe. She put out a number of hit albums for Capitol Records, such as &quot;Mambo!&quot; (1954) and &quot;Fuego del Ande&quot; (1959). During the height of Sumac&#x27;s popularity, she appeared in the films &quot;Secret of the Incas&quot; (1954) with Charlton Heston and Robert Young, and &quot;Omar Khayyam&quot; (1957).

She became a U.S. citizen on July 22, 1955. In 1959, she performed Jorge Bravo de Rueda&#x27;s classic song &quot;Vírgenes del Sol&quot; on her album &quot;Fuego del Ande&quot;. In 1957 Sumac and Vivanco divorced, after Vivanco sired twins with another woman. They remarried that same year, but a second divorce followed in 1965. Apparently due to financial difficulties, Sumac and the original Inka Taky Trio went on a world tour in 1960, which lasted for five years. They performed in 40 cities in the Soviet Union for over six months, and a film was shot recording some moments of the tour, and afterward throughout Europe, Asia and Latin America. Their performance in Bucharest, Romania, was recorded as the album &quot;Recital&quot;, her only live in concert record. Sumac spent the rest of the 1960s performing sporadically.

==Personal life==

She married Moisés Vivanco on June 6, 1942. After this date, Moisés and Yma toured South America and Mexico as a group of fourteen musicians called Imma Sumack and the Conjunto Folklorico Peruano. Some people in Peru did not appreciate her style of singing, most notably the writer José María Arguedas (&quot;La Prensa&quot;, 1944). In 1946, Sumac and Vivanco moved to New York City, where they performed as the Inka Taqui Trio, Sumac singing soprano, Vivanco on guitar, and her cousin, Cholita Rivero, singing contralto and dancing. The group was unable to attain any success; however, their participation in the South American Music Festival in Carnegie Hall was reviewed positively. In 1949, Yma gave birth to their only child, Carlos.

== Vocal range ==
She had five octaves according to some reports, but other reports (and recordings) document four-and-a-half at the peak of her singing career. Shortly after her death, the &quot;BBC&quot; noted that a typical trained singer has a range of about three octaves.

In 1954, composer and music critic Virgil Thomson described Sumac&#x27;s voice as &quot;very low and warm, very high and birdlike,&quot; noting that her range &quot;is very close to five octaves, but is in no way inhuman or outlandish in sound.&quot;

==Later career==

In 1971, Sumac released a rock album, &quot;Miracles&quot;. She performed in concert from time to time during the 1970s in Peru and later in New York at the Chateau Madrid and Town Hall. In the 1980s, she resumed her career under the management of Alan Eichler, and had a number of concerts both in the United States and abroad, including the Hollywood Roosevelt Cinegrill, New York&#x27;s Ballroom in 1987 (where she was held over for seven weeks to SRO crowds) and several San Francisco shows at the Theatre on the Square among others.
In 1987, she recorded &quot;I Wonder&quot; from the Disney film &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; for &quot;Stay Awake&quot;, an album of songs from Disney movies, produced by Hal Willner. She sang &quot;Ataypura&quot; during a March 19, 1987, appearance on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;. She recorded a new German &quot;techno&quot; dance record, &quot;Mambo ConFusion&quot;.

In 1989, she sang again at the Ballroom in New York and returned to Europe for the first time in 30 years to headline the BRT&#x27;s &quot;Gala van de Gouden Bertjes&quot; New Year&#x27;s Eve TV special in Brussels as well as the &quot;Etoile Palace&quot; program in Paris hosted by Frederic Mitterrand. In March 1990, she played the role of Heidi in Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Follies&quot;, in Long Beach, California, her first attempt at serious theater since &quot;Flahooley&quot; in 1951.

She also gave several concerts in the summer of 1996 in San Francisco and Hollywood as well as two more in Montreal, Canada, in July 1997 as part of the Montreal International Jazz Festival. In 1992, she declined to appear in a documentary for German television entitled &quot;Yma Sumac – Hollywoods Inkaprinzessin&quot; (&quot;Yma Sumac – Hollywood&#x27;s Inca Princess&quot;). With the resurgence of lounge music in the late 1990s, Sumac&#x27;s profile rose again when the song &quot;Ataypura&quot; was featured in the Coen Brothers film &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;.

Her song &quot;Bo Mambo&quot; appeared in a commercial for Kahlúa liquor and was sampled for the song &quot;Hands Up&quot; by The Black Eyed Peas. The song &quot;Gopher Mambo&quot; was used in the films &quot;Ordinary Decent Criminal&quot;, &quot;Happy Texas&quot;, &quot;Spy Games&quot;, and &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot;, among others. &quot;Gopher Mambo&quot; was used in an act of the Cirque Du Soleil show &quot;Quidam&quot;, as a musical motif in the Russian show &quot;Kukhnya&quot; (along with &quot;Bo Mambo&quot; and &quot;Taki Rari&quot;), and in an iPhone commercial in 2020. The songs &quot;Goomba Boomba&quot; and &quot;Malambo No. 1&quot; appeared in &quot;Death to Smoochy&quot;. A sample from &quot;Malambo No.1&quot; was used in Robin Thicke&#x27;s &quot;Everything I Can&#x27;t Have&quot;. Sumac is also mentioned in the lyrics of the 1980s song &quot;Joe le taxi&quot; by Vanessa Paradis, and her album &quot;Mambo!&quot; is the record that Belinda Carlisle pulls out of its jacket in the video for &quot;Mad About You&quot;. &quot;Gopher Mambo&quot; is used as the opening song in the British version of the television series &quot;Ten Percent&quot;.

On May 6, 2006, Sumac flew to Lima, where she was presented the &quot;Orden del Sol&quot; award by Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo and the Jorge Basadre medal by the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos.

==Death==
Sumac died on November 1, 2008, aged 86, at an assisted living home in Los Angeles, California, nine months after being diagnosed with colon cancer. She was interred at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in the &quot;Sanctuary of Memories&quot; section.

On September 13, 2016, a Google Doodle depicted Sumac.

On September 20, 2022, a new memorial bust statue was unveiled at her final resting place, at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, in honor of what would have been her 100th birthday.

== Myths ==
Stories published in the 1950s claimed that she was an Incan princess, directly descended from Atahualpa. The government of Peru in 1946 formally supported her claim to be descended from Atahualpa, the last Incan emperor. However, her biographer, Nicholas E. Limansky, claimed that her Incan royal origin was not true. &quot;Hollywood took this nice girl who wanted to be a folk singer, dressed her up and said she was a princess. And she acted like it,&quot; according to Limansky.

For years, rumors circulated that Sumac was a housewife from Brooklyn whose real name was &quot;Amy Camus&quot;, which she reversed to become Yma Sumac. The origin of the rumor may plausibly be traced to a cleverly formulated review by influential jazz critic Leonard Feather, who used literary device, in a December 1950 column, to suggest that Sumac&#x27;s voice was in fact a theremin, that Xtabay—or Axterbay—was Pig Latin for Baxter, and that the name of the singer was Amy Camus, who took Serutan (a contemporary laxative: &quot;natures&quot; spelled backwards).

==Discography==
A 1943 recording session in Argentina included 23 songs, released on 78 rpm on Odeon Records. Sumac&#x27;s 1952 album &quot;Legend of the Sun Virgin&quot; was reissued in 2020 (digitally and on vinyl records) by Madrid label Ellas Rugen (Ladies Who Roar) Records, dedicated to the greatest female Latin American singers of the second half of the 20th century.

<text>Jeannie Longo (born 31 October 1958) is a French racing cyclist, 6-time French champion and 13-time world champion. Longo began racing in 1975 and was active in cycling through 2012. She was once widely considered the best female cyclist of all time, although that reputation is now clouded by suspicion of doping throughout her career. She is famous for her competitive nature and her longevity in the sport – when she was selected to compete for France in the 2008 Olympics, it was her seventh Olympic Games; some of Longo&#x27;s competitors that year had not yet been born when she took part in her first Olympics in 1984. She had stated that 2008 would be her final participation in the Olympics.
In the Women&#x27;s road race, she finished 24th, 33 seconds behind winner Nicole Cooke, who was one year old when Longo first rode in the Olympics.
At the same Olympics, she finished 4th in the road time trial, just two seconds shy of securing a bronze medal. She is currently number two on the all-time list of French female summer or winter Olympic medal winners, with a total of four medals including one in gold, which is one less than the total number won by the fencer Laura Flessel-Colovic.

==Early life and education==

Longo was born in Annecy, Haute-Savoie, in the French Alps .

==Career==
Longo began her athletic career as a downhill skier. After winning the French schools&#x27; ski championship and three university skiing championships, she switched to cycling at the urging of her coach (and later husband) Patrice Ciprelli. Within a few months, Longo won the French road race Championship at the age of 21. She competed both in road and track bicycle racing events, and is an Olympic gold-medalist and thirteen-time world champion.

===Doping affairs===
In September 1987 Longo tested positive for ephedrine following a 3 km world record attempt in Colorado Springs. She served a 1-month ban for this offense.

In September 2011, it was reported that Longo had missed three doping tests and was under investigation by the FFC. Normally, this would be penalized the same as a positive test, but AFLD had failed to notify Longo that she would be targeted for testing in that year, there was therefore no further action taken. It subsequently transpired that Longo&#x27;s husband, Patrice Ciprelli, had purchased the performance-enhancing drug EPO from China via former American professional cyclist Joe Papp. Ciprelli confessed and claimed that he purchased the EPO for his own personal use. He was found guilty in May 2016, and given a 1-year suspended jail sentence and €12,800 in fines and costs.
==Palmarès==
===Track===

Note: Beginning in 1997, the Union Cycliste Internationale awarded points to riders based on their performances. For this purpose, the races were classified. Although the system has evolved, the major stage races are category 1 (strongest) and 2. In the listings below, these categories, where known, are in parentheses. GC stands for general classification.

<text>Cantonists (; more properly: , &quot;military cantonists&quot;) were underage sons of conscripts in the Russian Empire. From 1721 on they were educated in special &quot;cantonist schools&quot; () for future military service (the schools were called garrison schools in the 18th century). The cantonist schools and the cantonist system were eventually abolished in 1857, following public and international criticism and the Russian defeat in the Crimean War.

== Cantonist schools during the 18th and early 19th centuries ==
Cantonist schools were established by the 1721 decree of Tsar Peter the Great that stipulated that every regiment was required to maintain a school for 50 boys. Their enrollment was increased in 1732, and the term was set from the age of 7 to 15. The curriculum included grammar and arithmetic, and those with a corresponding aptitude were taught artillery, fortification, music and singing, scrivenery, equine veterinary science, or mechanics. Those lacking such talents were taught carpentry, blacksmithing, shoemaking and other trades useful to the military. The most able were taught for a further three years, until the age of 18. All entered military service at the completion of their studies. The decree of 1758 required all male children of the military personnel to be taught in the cantonist schools. In 1798 a military &quot;asylum-orphanage&quot; was established in St Petersburg, and all regimental schools were renamed after it, the total enrollment reaching 16,400.

The schools were reorganized in 1805 and all children were now referred to as &quot;cantonists&quot;. After the Patriotic War of 1812 their number increased dramatically, when many orphaned sons of military personnel killed in the war enrolled in cantonist schools voluntarily. During this period the curriculum of cantonist schools was equivalent to that of gymnasia, and military subjects were not taught.

In 1824 all cantonist schools were made answerable to the Director of Military Settlements Count Aleksey Arakcheyev, and in 1826 they were organized into cantonist battalions. The standards of curriculum dropped significantly, and it was limited to the subjects useful to the military.

During the reign of Nicholas I of Russia the number of cantonists reached 36,000. Several cantonist battalions became specialized: they prepared auditors, artillerists, engineers, military surgeons, cartographers.

More boys were added to the category of cantonists. Eventually sons of the discharged soldiers were also included, illegitimate sons of soldiers&#x27; partners or widows, and even foundlings.

There were several exemptions:
#Legitimate sons of staff-officers, and all officers awarded the Order of St. Vladimir 4th class.
#A single son of a junior staff-officer, out of a total number of his children, if he had no sons born after his attainment of the officer&#x27;s rank.
#A single son of a junior officer maimed in battle.
#A single son of a widow of a junior officer or an enlisted man killed in action or deceased during service.

There were considerable differences in cantonists&#x27; service obligations:
* Children of nobility were required to serve for 3 years at the completion of their studies.
* Children of senior officers – 6 years.
* Children of clergy – 8 years.
* All other social categories – 25 years.

== Cantonism and ethnic minorities ==
There was forcible conscription of underage recruits from the populations of indigenous peoples, Old Believers, Romani people, and common vagabonds from 1805, Jews from 1827, and Poles from 1831.

There were some significant differences in treatment of Jews and non-Jews: all others were required to provide conscripts between 18 and 35, while for Jews the age limit was 12–25, and it was left to the discretion of the Jewish &quot;qahal&quot; to choose conscripts from whatever age they decided. Thus in practice, Jewish children were often conscripted as young as eight or nine years old. This system created a disproportionate number of Jewish cantonists, and betrayed the utilitarian agenda of the statute: to draft those more likely to be susceptible to external influence, and thus to assimilation.

=== Jews ===
After 1827, the term was applied to Jewish and Karaite boys, who were drafted to military service at the age of twelve and placed for their six-year military education in cantonist schools. Like all other conscripts, they were required to serve in the Imperial Russian army for 25 years after the completion of their studies (in 1834 the term was reduced to 20 years plus five years in reserve and in 1855 to 12 years plus three years of reserve). According to the &quot;Statute on Conscription Duty&quot; signed by Tsar Nicholas I of Russia on August 26 (September 7 new style), 1827, Jews were made liable to personal military service and were subject to the same conscription quota as all other tax-paying estates (&quot;sosloviya&quot;) in the Russian Empire. The total number of conscripts was uniform for all populations (four conscripts per each thousand subjects); however, the actual recruitment was implemented by the local &quot;qahals&quot; and so a disproportionate number of Jewish conscripts were underage.

In the aftermath of the Polish uprising of 1831, children of political prisoners and boys on the streets of captured cities often were abducted, and placed in cantonist schools, with the intent of their Russification, see Incorporation of Polish children into the Imperial Russian Army (1831–1832) for more.

The vast majority of Jews entered the Russian Empire with the territories acquired as the result of the last partitions of Poland of the 1790s; their civil rights were severely restricted (see Pale of Settlement). Most lacked knowledge of the official Russian language. Before 1827, Jews were doubly taxed en lieu of being obligated to serve in the army and their inclusion was supposed to alleviate this burden. However, the number of recruits reduced the number of young men that could go into the workforce, and this in combination with political restrictions led to widespread destitution.

Russia was divided into northern, southern, eastern, and western &quot;conscription zones&quot; and the levy was announced annually for only one of them. The Pale of Jewish settlement was outside conscription in the fallow years, so the conscription in general and of cantonists in particular occurred once every four years, except during the Crimean War, when conscription was annual. The first 1827 draft involved some 1,800 Jewish conscripts; by the &quot;qahal&#x27;s&quot; decision half of them were children. In 1843 the conscription system was extended to the Kingdom of Poland that was previously exempt from it.

==== Strains within the Jewish community ====
The &#x27;decree of August 26, 1827&#x27; made Jews liable for military service, and allowed their conscription between the ages of twelve and twenty-five. Every four years, the Jewish community had to supply four recruits per thousand of the population. Strict quotas were imposed on all communities and the &quot;qahals&quot; were given the unpleasant task of implementing conscription within the Jewish communities. Since the merchant-guild members, agricultural colonists, factory mechanics, clergy, and all Jews with secondary education were exempt, and the wealthy bribed their way out of having their children conscripted, fewer potential conscripts were available; the adopted policy deeply sharpened internal Jewish social tensions. Seeking to protect the socio-economic and religious integrity of Jewish society, the &quot;qahals&quot; did their best to include “non-useful Jews” in the draft lists so that the heads of tax-paying middle-class families were predominantly exempt from conscription, whereas single Jews, as well as &quot;heretics&quot; (Haskalah-influenced individuals), paupers, outcasts, and orphaned children were drafted. They used their power to suppress protests and intimidate potential informers who sought to expose the arbitrariness of the &quot;qahal&quot; to the Russian government. In some cases, communal elders had the most threatening informers murdered (such as the Ushitsa case, 1836), see mesirah.

The zoning rule was suspended during the Crimean War, when conscription became annual. During this period the &quot;qahals&quot; leaders would employ informers and kidnappers (, khappers), as many potential conscripts preferred to run away rather than voluntarily submit. In the case of unfulfilled quotas, younger boys of eight and even younger were frequently taken.

==== Training and pressures to convert ====
All cantonists were institutionally underfed, and encouraged to steal food from the local population, in emulation of the Spartan character building. On one occasion in 1856, a Jewish cantonist, Khodulevich, managed to steal the Tsar&#x27;s own watch during military games at Uman. Not only was he not punished, but he was given a reward of 25 roubles for his prowess.

The boys in cantonist schools were given extensive training in Russian grammar (and sometimes literature), and mathematics, in particular geometry necessary in naval and artillery service. Those who showed aptitude for music were trained in singing and instrumental music, as the Imperial Army had a large demand for military wind bands and choirs. Some cavalry regiments maintained equestrian bands of torban players, and cantonist schools supplied these as well. Some cantonist schools also prepared firearms mechanics, veterinarians for cavalry, and administrators (&quot;auditors&quot;).

The official policy was to encourage their conversion to the state religion of Orthodox Christianity and Jewish boys were coerced to baptism. As kosher food was unavailable, they were faced with the necessity of abandoning of Jewish dietary laws. Polish Catholic boys were subject to similar pressure to convert and assimilate as the Russian Empire was hostile to Catholicism and Polish nationalism. Initially conversions were few, but after the escalation of missionary activities in the cantonist schools in 1844, about one third of all Jewish cantonists would have undergone conversion.

=== Other ===
In the era of Arakcheev&#x27;s military settlements (1809–1831), indigenous peasants who fell within the territory of a military settlement were subject to incorporation into the military in various ways. In particular, indigenous children (under the age of 18) were considered military cantonists and divided into three age groups: minor (under the age of 7), middle (ages 8–12), and senior, with the latter group assigned to the military school of the settlement. Minors stayed with the parents, while minor orphans were transferred to military settlers, with an award of 10 roubles. All male newborns automatically became cantonists. Later it turned out that instead of 11 years, 8 years of military training were enough. Correspondingly, the age groups were changed: under 10, under 14, and under 18.

In the aftermath of the Polish uprising of 1831, children of political prisoners and boys on the streets of captured cities were often abducted, and placed in cantonist schools for Russification: see Incorporation of Polish children into the Imperial Russian Army (1831–1832) for more.

== In the army ==
For all cantonists, their 25-year term of service began after they reached the age of 18 and were recruited into the army.

Discriminatory regulations ensured that unconverted Jews were held back in their army promotions. According to Benjamin Nathans,
... the formal incorporation of Jews into Nicolas I&#x27;s army was quickly compromised by laws distinguishing Jewish from non-Jewish soldiers. Less than two years after the 1827 decree on conscription, Jews were barred from certain elite units, and beginning in 1832 they were subject to separate, more stringent criteria for promotion, which required that they &quot;distinguish themselves in combat with the enemy.&quot;
Jews who refused to convert were barred from ascending above the rank of &quot;унтер-офицер&quot; i.e. NCO; only eight exceptions were recorded during the 19th century. These restrictions were not lifted until the February Revolution in 1917.

Some baptized cantonists eventually reached high ranks in the Imperial Army and Navy; among them were generals Arnoldi, Zeil; admirals Kaufman, Sapsay, Kefali.

=== Literary references ===
The cantonists&#x27; fate was sometimes described by Yiddish and Russian literature classics.

Alexander Herzen in his &quot;My Past and Thoughts&quot; described his somber encounter with Jewish cantonists. While being convoyed to his exile in 1835 at Vyatka, Herzen met a unit of emaciated Jewish cantonists, some eight years old, who were marched to Kazan. Their (sympathetic) officer complained that a third had already died.

Nikolai Leskov described underage Jewish cantonists in his 1863 story &quot;The Musk-Ox&quot; (Ovtsebyk).

Judah Steinberg described underage Jewish cantonists in his novel &quot;In Those Days&quot; (English translation in 1915, from the Hebrew).

The agony of Polish children incorporated into the Imperial Russian Army was presented in Juliusz Słowacki&#x27;s narrative poem &quot;Anhelli&quot;.

== Abolition and results of cantonist policy ==
The cantonist policy was abolished by Tsar Alexander II&#x27;s decree on 26 August 1856, in the aftermath of the Russian defeat in the Crimean War, which made evident the dire necessity for the modernisation of the Russian military forces. Nonetheless, the drafting of children lasted through 1859. All unconverted cantonists and recruits under the age of 20 were returned to their families. The underage converted cantonists were given to their godparents. However the implementation of the abolition took nearly 3 years.

It is estimated that between 30,000 and 70,000 Jewish boys served as cantonists, their numbers were disproportionately high in relation to the total number of cantonists. Jewish boys comprised about 20% of cantonists at the schools in Riga and Vitebsk, and as much as 50% at Kazan and Kiev schools. A general estimate for the years 1840–1850 seems to have been about 15%. In general Jews comprised a disproportionate number of recruits (ten for every thousand of the male population as opposed to seven out of every thousand), the number was tripled during the Crimean War (1853–1856).

At the conclusion of the conscription term, former cantonists were allowed to live and own land anywhere in the Empire, outside the Pale of Settlement. The earliest Jewish communities in Finland were Jewish cantonists who had completed their service. The rate of conversion was generally high, at about one third, as was eventual intermarriage. Most never returned to their homes.

== Statistics ==

Peter Koelewijn was born on 29 December 1940, the son of a fishmonger in the southern Dutch city of Eindhoven. At the age of thirteen, he received his first guitar. In 1957, he started writing his first songs in English. He started his first band at secondary school with guitarists Karel Jansen and Roelof Egmond and singer Anneke Grönloh. Later on, Harry van Hoof (who later became a famous conductor), and drummer Peter van der Voort, joined the band. Around the same time, Grönloh left the band. Koelewijn has two children, Kim and Joep, who share his musical talent.

=== 1959–1969: Kom van dat dak af! ===
In 1959 the band, now called &#x27;Peter and his Rockets&#x27;, was joined by saxophone player Klaus Buchholz and bass guitarist Karel Jansen. In December, the band recorded &quot;Kom Van Dat Dak Af&quot; for record company Bovema. The combination of American rock and roll and Dutch lyrics was quite revolutionary at the time. In May 1960, &quot;Kom Van Dat Dak Af&quot; was a massive success in both the Netherlands and Belgium. Koelewijn, who moved on to grammar school, was told by his parents that he had to finish his schooling. Peter and His Rockets signed at Philips.

Follow-up singles &quot;Laat Me Los&quot; (&quot;Let Me Go&quot;) and &quot;Marijke&quot; charted lower. By 1967 Koelewijn disbanded the Rockets to focus on writing and producing for other artists; he also hosted radio shows.

===1970s: Glamrock and first album===

In 1970, he reformed the Rockets for what would become his glam rock era; this period lasted five years.

His 1973 composition, &quot;Klap Maar in Je Handen&quot; (&quot;Clap Your Hands and Stamp Your Feet&quot;) was a no. 1 hit for South African singer Maria in South Africa and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), where it is still popular at dances.

In 1977, Koelewijn released his debut solo album &quot;Het Beste in Mij Is Niet Goed Genoeg Voor Jou&quot; (&quot;The Best I Can Give Is Still Unworthy Of You&quot;) which spawned two singles; the Rockets-like &quot;Je Wordt Ouder Papa&quot; (&quot;You&#x27;re Growing Older Papa&quot;; a jocular comment by Golden Earring guitarist George Kooymans) and &quot;KL 204 (Als Ik God Was)&quot;, originally intended as the lead single and reissued in 1990. Engelbert Humperdinck recorded the English version &quot;The Road To Nowhere&quot;, although Koelewijn had done likewise at the start. &quot;Flight 204&quot; was released in 2019 on the bilingual album-reissue.

=== 1980s–1990s: New Rockets lineup and Gompie ===
In 1981, Koelewijn recruited musicians from the band Bunny for a new Rockets line-up that lasted till 1997; their first release was the live-album &quot;Peter Live&quot; of which &quot;Kom Van Dat Dak Af&quot; and &quot;Klap Maar in Je Handen&quot; hit the charts. In 1982, the band appeared in an insurance-commercial.

Early 1985, Koelewijn had a top 40 hit with &quot;Sprong in Het Duister&quot; (&quot;Leap in the Dark&quot;), the lead single of his otherwise unsuccessful second solo album. In 1987, he released &quot;De Loop Van Een Geweer&quot; (&quot;Barrel of a Gun&quot;) which was loosely based on The Commodores&#x27; &quot;Nightshift&quot;. In 1995, Koelewijn fronted the novelty group Gompie; their version of Smokie&#x27;s &quot;Living Next Door to Alice&quot; topped the charts.

=== 2000s–2010s: Anniversaries, awards, and tributes ===

In 2002, Peter and His Rockets reformed for seven shows. In 2007, Koelewijn received a lifetime achievement award. A tribute concert was held where he performed a few songs himself. In 2008, Koelewijn appeared at the 50th-anniversary concert for Dutch pop. He opened the show by performing &quot;Kom Van Dat Dak Af&quot; as a duet with singer-songwriter Boudewijn de Groot. In 2009, the year of his own 50th career anniversary, Koelewijn released a solo album titled &quot;Een Gelukkig Man&quot; (&quot;A Happy Man&quot;). Koelewijn was a chairman of Buma/Stemra.

In 2011, Koelewijn appeared on the &quot;Ali B op volle toeren&quot; with rapper Typhoon. In 2013 he appeared in the &quot;Beste Zangers&quot;, selecting songs and cover versions from his own repertoire to be performed by the other contesters.

<doc id="922667" wikidata="Q5520508" url="?curid=922667" title="Ganas">
<text>Ganas is an intentional community founded in 1979 in Tompkinsville, Staten Island. Ganas has non-egalitarian, tiered membership groups, and is thus a partial member at the Federation of Egalitarian Communities. The community uses a group problem-solving process called &quot;Feedback Learning&quot;, which was begun by co-founder Mildred Gordon. The community attracted press attention after a 2006 shooting incident which led to lurid tabloid headlines. The community was founded by a group of six people, and has grown to consist of 10–12 core group members plus 60 to 70 members of varying involvement. There are three businesses run by Ganas, including a bookstore-cafe.

==History==
Ganas started in Staten Island in 1979 with six founders including Mildred Gordon and Jeff Gross. In 1973 Gordon left New York City where she had founded GROW, an unaccredited school of group therapy that &quot;turned out unlicensed group psychotherapists.&quot; Throughout 1972 GROW was the subject of state Attorney General and city fraud investigations into &quot;fraudulent use of Ph.D.&#x27;s from unaccredited universities&quot;. Gordon went to San Francisco where she studied biofeedback which became the basis of what she termed &quot;Feedback Learning&quot;. Gordon met the five people who would become the original core-group of the Ganas community and incorporated the tax-exempt 501(c)(3) non-profit organization Foundation for Feedback Learning (FFL) in 1974. The new community went by the name FFL until changing their name to Ganas in the early 1990s. In the late 1970s they returned to New York and moved into a Lower East Side apartment, finally settling in Tompkinsville, Staten Island in 1979. On Staten Island the core-group shares ownership of eight houses and three commercial buildings that house their retail stores. There are about 65 non-core group residents who live in Ganas houses and cover expenses by either paying rent or working in the stores.

==Culture==
Ganas operates on four primary rules forbidding violence, freeloading, illegal activities, and non-negotiable negativity (requiring that complaints be discussed in group process or not discussed at all either in private or public). The primary focus of Ganas is Feedback Learning, an &quot;intense brand of communication&quot; according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, about which journalist Jonah Owen Lamb writes: &quot;Those new to Ganas would share their life story with the group, who would respond by picking apart their issues and deciding how those issues should be dealt with. By &#x27;killing their buddhas,&#x27; it was felt, Ganas members could begin to take control of how they reacted to the world.&quot; Mildred Gordon describes Feedback Learning as an &quot;indispensable day-to-day guiding experience&quot; in which members of the community provide feedback—helpful criticism—to each other. Through daily discussions of every community member&#x27;s behaviour members can learn about themselves and their motivations, gain from hearing unpleasant truths, and &quot;accept negative information with the excitement of discovery&quot;. Mildred Gordon left Ganas in 2001 but still returned weekly to conduct Feedback Learning sessions at the commune. Profiles of Ganas today suggest the community has become less insular, with a more diverse group living there relatively less engaged in feedback learning.

==Finances==

Though Ganas is portrayed as a commune in the media, only the core group participates in income and property sharing.

Ganas runs three stores under the name &quot;Every Thing Goes&quot; that are dedicated to the re-use and re-sale of used goods. The stores include a furniture store, a clothing store and a bookstore/cafe with a performance stage. The businesses support the community but are labor-intensive and only marginally profitable. For most of its life Ganas&#x27; income was declared on FFL&#x27;s IRS form 990 for tax-exempt organizations. Since 2001 FFL has taken in an average of $475,000 in total annual revenue, including direct public support and program service revenue. FFL&#x27;s program services are listed as &quot;Feedback Learning Skills Development&quot; and &quot;Interpersonal Skills Development&quot;. FFL&#x27;s revenues do not include income from their &quot;Everything Goes&quot; stores, as those are for-profit entities.

In late 2006 the core group reorganized as Ganas Community LLC, and began a new business called Ganas Food Company LLC. Mildred Gordon continued to draw an annual salary of $40,000 as the executive director of FFL. In 2007 the legal address of FFL changed from Ganas headquarters on Staten Island to Brooklyn, and the same year FFL&#x27;s tax return declared only $15,550 in total revenue and $75 in direct public support. The following year total revenue fell to $2295 with direct public support of $0. Ganas has a real estate portfolio estimated at $10 million with holdings in upstate New York, Brooklyn, Virginia, California and Spain.

== Controversy ==
Two ex-members have made allegations about Ganas, including that it is a cult, that it pressures residents into sex and green-card marriages, and that &quot;they control minds with drugs that are used by psychotherapists&quot;. Ganas opposes being described as a cult.

===2006 shooting===
In May 2006 Ganas co-founder Jeff Gross was shot outside of his home on Ganas property. Gross survived and at trial identified the shooter as Rebekah Johnson, a former member who lived at Ganas periodically until she was evicted in 1996. Johnson&#x27;s attorney denied that she had shot Gross, but said that she was &quot;wrongfully accused by Gross as payback for portraying him as a brainwashing rapist and the commune as a kinky cult.&quot; Johnson had unsuccessfully sued the group for sexual harassment in 2000. In August 2008 Johnson was acquitted of all charges.

Jeff Gross left the group after the shooting, and filed several lawsuits against Ganas and Rebekah Johnson. Gross claimed that the leadership rejected his requests that the group upgrade security, that his personal daily schedule was published in a Ganas newsletter, and that he was &quot;booted out&quot; of Ganas in October 2007. Gross is seeking damages totaling over $20 million. A 2022 Esquire article followed up with Jeff, who was living in hiding. He was granted $1.3 million judgment against his shooter but it is outstanding.

<doc id="922670" wikidata="Q7933038" url="?curid=922670" title="Viola Slaughter">
<text>Cora Viola Howell (September 18, 1860–March 1941), later to become Viola Slaughter, was an Arizona rancher and the wife of Sheriff John Horton Slaughter, known as Texas John Slaughter.

==Early years==
Viola Slaughter was born in Missouri to Amazon and Mary Ann Howell.

By the time Viola was eighteen, the Howell family had moved to a ranch near Roswell in the New Mexico Territory. It was while living there that Viola met John Slaughter, and they quickly fell in love. Viola would confess herself that &quot;it was love at first sight&quot; to a writer. John was thirty-seven and Viola only eighteen when they met. John had two small children from his first marriage to the former Eliza Adeline Harris, who died in 1877 of smallpox.

==Marriage==
Viola&#x27;s mother vehemently opposed her daughter&#x27;s interest in Slaughter. Her father, however, thought more positively about the relationship. By April 1879, Viola told her mother that she would marry John in about two weeks. Her mother screamed. With her father&#x27;s blessing, the couple parted the next morning to Tularosa, also in the New Mexico Territory, where they wed on April 16.

==Motherly devotion==
Viola Slaughter wanted to be a mother all of her life; because of this, she admittedly took a motherly love towards John&#x27;s two children. Slaughter would never become a natural mother, but she and John adopted several children, among them, an Apache baby girl found by Slaughter in Mexico. Apache May had been abandoned there.

Apache May Slaughter died at the age of five, in 1900, the victim of a fire.

==From Arizona and back==
Soon after marrying, the Slaughters arrived at Sulphur Springs, where they lived in a two-room house. This would mark the beginning of the relationship between her and John&#x27;s two children, Addie and Willie. John told her that he would send them to Texas to live with his brother, Viola convinced him not to do so because she was already feeling love for the children.

The Slaughters opened a supermarket near Tombstone in 1880. In order to get supplies, such as meat, the Slaughters had to travel through Apache territory, a trip which frightened Viola. In 1881, the Slaughters returned to New Mexico, by train. John needed more cattle for his ranch. During the return trip, the Slaughters faced a blizzard, and sixteen of the seventeen travellers in the Slaughter group suffered from frostbite. Only Addie Slaughter escaped unharmed. She was attached to a buffalo robe, which protected her from harm.

Beginning in the spring of 1883, John took his family on a trip that he thought would land him in Oregon, where he dreamed of having a ranch by Snake River. His plans were ruined, however, when he began hemorrhaging while in Idaho from an old condition of tuberculosis. The Slaughters had to return immediately to Arizona. Soon, they purchased the San Bernardino Mexican land grant. Their new home was large enough to be located in two countries: half of the ranch was in the United States, the other half in Mexico. The San Bernardino Ranch had , which John had bought for one dollar and twenty five cents each.

==Sheriff&#x27;s wife==
Although the house had been abandoned, and deteriorated, for fifty years, Viola Slaughter was very happy with her new house. She marveled at the views nearby and the fact that, just by walking from one side of the house to the other, she would be crossing countries every time. From 1886 to 1890, Slaughter lived in Tombstone, where he was the sheriff. However, they kept the ranch.

In 1887, one of the few earthquakes in the history of Arizona destroyed part of the San Bernardino Ranch. Slaughter felt quite disappointed about his life as a rancher and decided to retire from being a working rancher once his days as sheriff were over. Viola, however, convinced him otherwise. She promised to help with the ranching and said, &quot;just give me a plain house with wide board floors, muslin ceilings and board finish around the adobes. That&#x27;s all I want&quot;.

In 1892, the Slaughters, having remodeled their ranch, moved there permanently. Viola Slaughter also became famous across the west for her curing abilities, and cowboys would come from as far as New Mexico to get treatments from her. She also joined Slaughter on his frequent trips to Mexico; they helped catch a killer there, and usually brought cattle from as far as Hermosillo. Viola Slaughter would later tell Charles Morgan Wood that she heard one time that John had been killed in Mexico by Apaches, and she got on a wagon and headed towards the frontier. Three days later, she saw her husband from afar. Viola was so happy that she felt ill, but she hid her weak feeling when her husband got to her, and he did not notice that she was not feeling good.

In 1896, Slaughter went on the attack and followed Apaches to Mexico. Instead, he found the abandoned baby, Apache May.

==Wealth==
The Slaughters became wealthy. Viola was able to wear expensive dresses to dinner. The family dinners were equally known in Arizona society circles, as these usually included fresh vegetables, jam, cream, and other exquisite ingredients of the era.

The Slaughters were known for being an affable family, and the San Bernardino Ranch became a hang-out place for the rich, the poor, neighbors, friends, and passersby who happened to come along and felt like talking to someone. 

==Murder, death==
On May 4, 1921, a foreman, Jesse Fisher, was murdered at the San Bernardino Ranch by robbers. As the ranch was being robbed, Slaughter believed that he was in danger; so he asked Fisher to check on the horses, and Slaughter moved into a bedroom without windows. Seconds later, Fisher was murdered. One of the killers was one of the Slaughters&#x27; adopted children, a fact which left the couple distraught. Convinced that they needed to leave the ranch, the Slaughters moved to Douglas. On his last overnight visit to the ranch in 1922, John Slaughter died there.

Viola remained active, although she stayed in Douglas for the remainder of her life. She traveled for news interviews. In 1939, as the grand marshal of Douglas&#x27; town rodeo parade, she rode a horse through the streets of the border city. On February 27, 1941, Addie Slaughter suffered a fatal heart attack while visiting Viola. About a month later, overcome with depression, Viola herself died.

<text>Olaf Karl Tufte (born 27 April 1976 in Tønsberg) is a Norwegian rower, firefighter, and farmer. He is a seven-time Olympian, and as a single sculler he was twice the Olympic champion and twice the world champion. He has been consistently selected to the Norwegian men&#x27;s senior national rowing squad since 1996, including his selection as a 2020 Tokyo Olympian – where he made his seventh Olympic appearance, racing in the men&#x27;s quadruple sculls.

== Early rowing career ==
Tufte started rowing at age 17, initially as a means to improve his handle on motor cross. He rows from the Horten Roklubb in Horten, Vestfold on the Oslofjord. He quickly displayed an aptitude for the sport and one year later, in 1994, he debuted internationally for Norway, rowing a single scull at the 1994 Junior World Rowing Championships. He finished sixth. In 1995, he raced in a Norwegian U23 quad scull which took silver at the Nations Cup in Holland.

==Representative rowing career==
Tufte&#x27;s senior debut for Norway came at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996. He rowed in the men&#x27;s coxless four which finished in overall eighth place. He moved back into sculling boats in 1997 and rowed in the Norwegian quad at the 1997 World Rowing Championships in Aiguebelette for an overall thirteenth finish. He secured a seat in men&#x27;s coxless four in 1998, rowing at two World Rowing Cups and then at the 1998 World Rowing Championships where they made the A final and placed sixth.

In 1999 Tufte moved into a double scull with Fredrik Bekken and commenced their 2000 Olympics campaign. They won gold at all three World Rowing Cups in the European international season of 1999 and then took the bronze medal at the 1999 World Championships in St. Catharines, Canada. They preserved their elite ranking all through 2000 and won the silver medal in the men&#x27;s double scull at the 2000 Sydney Olympics.

Tufte rowed on without a break after Sydney 2000, taking to a single scull. He finished on the podium at all four World Rowing Cups of 2001 and then won his first world championship title with a gold medal row at the 2001 World Rowing Championships in Lucerne. His performance that year saw him named as the 2001 Norwegian Sportsperson of the Year. Tufte then won silver medals at three World Rowing Cups of 2002 and brought home a bronze medal from the 2002 World Rowing Championships in Spain. In 2003 he timed his build-up to win gold and his second world champion title at the World Championships in Milan.

In 2004 Tufte planned his Olympic build-up perfectly. He was fourth at the World Rowing Cup I, second at WRC II, then won gold at WRC III in the June before heading to the 2004 Athens Olympics, where in the men&#x27;s single scull he beat the Estonian Jueri Jaanson to win his first Olympic gold medal. He carried on relentlessly into 2005 racing at three World Rowing Cups before finishing in second place at the 2005 World Championships in Gifu, Japan for a silver medal behind New Zealand&#x27;s Mahe Drysdale who was at that point commencing his own world-class dominant run.

2006 and 2007 saw business as usual for Tufte in his disciplined participation at all the International events but at the 2006 and 2007 World Championships he finished respectively fourth and third with Drysdale now the world champion top man. For the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Tufte was defending his title as Olympic champion. He won his heat and his quarter-final, finished second in his semi but brought it home in the final beating out Ondrej Synek of the Czech Republic and relegating Drysdale to a bronze position. Tufte was now a dual Olympic champion. Between Athens and Beijing, Tufte&#x27;s performance had not yielded gold in world championships, but he was viewed as an athlete who rose to the big occasion and he was awarded with the title &quot;number one male rower of 2009&quot; in the 2010 FOCUS issue of FISA&#x27;s World Rowing Magazine.

Tuft placed fourth at the 2010 World Championships in New Zealand and sixth in 2011 in Slovenia. By the time of the 2012 London Olympics Tuft&#x27;s star and form was waning. He was unsuccessful in defending his Olympic title missing the A final and finishing with an overall ninth ranking. After the 2012 Olympics, Tufte took a year off to treat and recover from a liver disease which had been affecting his form for some years. He returned to the elite level in the single scull but found himself outside the top placings in the 2014 international season. He lifted in 2015 and at that year&#x27;s World Championships managed a fourth place behind his old rivals Synek, Drysdale and the Lithuanian Mindaugas Griskonis.

Tufte&#x27;s career was reborn in 2016 when he paired up with his Horten Roklubb clubmate, the world champion Kjetil Borch in a double scull. They lifted their ranking throughout 2016, qualified for the Rio Olympics at the final European qualification regatta and ultimately won a bronze medal in the men&#x27;s double sculls in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. They rowed on together in 2017 and placed fifth at the 2017 World Rowing Championships.

In 2018 Tufte moved back into the quad scull where his career had started. He secured a seat as stroke of the Norwegian quad and they rowed at World Rowing Cups and European Championships through 2018 and 2019. Their seventh-place ranking at the 2019 World Rowing Championships saw them qualify that boat for Tokyo 2020. By the time of the 2021 crew selections for those delayed Olympics, Tufte had held his seat and looked set to make his seventh Olympic rowing appearance.

== Personal life ==
When not rowing, Tufte earns a living growing cereals at the family farm in the Nykirke part of Horten, and he also works as a fire-fighter.

<doc id="922688" wikidata="Q954199" url="?curid=922688" title="MHTML">
<text>MHTML, an initialism of &quot;MIME encapsulation of aggregate HTML documents&quot;, is a Web archive file format used to combine, in a single computer file, the HTML code and its companion resources (such as images) that are represented by external hyperlinks in the web page&#x27;s HTML code. The content of an MHTML file is encoded using the same techniques that were first developed for HTML email messages, using the MIME content type codice_1. MHTML files use an .mhtml or .mht filename extension.

The first part of the file is an e-mail header. The second part is normally HTML code. Subsequent parts are additional resources identified by their original uniform resource locators (URLs) and encoded in base64 binary-to-text encoding. MHTML was proposed as an open standard, then circulated in a revised edition in 1999 as RFC 2557.

The .mhtml (Web archive) and .eml (email) filename extensions are interchangeable: either filename extension can be changed from one to the other. An .eml message can be sent by e-mail, and it can be displayed by an email client. An email message can be saved using a .mhtml or .mht filename extension and then opened for display in a web browser or for editing other programs, including word processors and text editors.

== Layout ==
The header of an MHTML file contains metadata such as a date and time stamp, page title, the source URL, and a unique randomized boundary string for separating resources contained within the file. The boundary string is defined at the beginning and used throughout the file.

Then, the page resources are contained sequentially, starting with the page&#x27;s rendered HTML source code. Each resource has its own metadata header which specifies its MIME type and the original location.

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
The MHTML file ends with a boundary string that is not followed by any data.

==Browser support==
Some browsers support the MHTML format, either directly or through third-party extensions, but the process for saving a web page along with its resources as an MHTML file is not standardized. Due to this, a web page saved as an MHTML file using one browser may render differently on another.

===Internet Explorer===
As of version 5.0, IE was the first browser to support reading and saving web pages and external resources to a single MHTML file.

===Microsoft Edge===
After switching to the Chromium source code, Microsoft Edge supports saving as MHTML.

===Opera===
Support for saving web pages as MHTML files was made available in the Opera 9.0 web browser. From Opera 9.50 through the rest of the Presto-based Opera product line (currently at Opera 12.16 as of 19 July 2013), the default format for saving pages is MHTML. The initial release of the new Webkit/Blink-based Opera (Opera 15) did not support MHTML, but subsequent releases (Opera 16 onwards) do.

MHTML can be enabled by typing &quot;opera://flags#save-page-as-mhtml&quot; at the address bar.

=== Google Chrome ===
Creating MHTML files in Google Chrome is enabled by default in version 86.

=== Yandex Browser ===
Creating MHTML (multipart/related) files in Yandex Browser is enabled by default in version 22.7.4.960 (July 2022).

=== Vivaldi ===
Similarly to Google Chrome, the Chromium-based Vivaldi browser can save webpages as MHTML files since the 2.3 release.

It supports both reading and writing MHTML files by toggling the &quot;vivaldi://flags/#save-page-as-mhtml&quot; option.

=== Firefox ===
Mozilla Firefox does not support MHTML. Until the advent of version 57 (&quot;Firefox Quantum&quot;), MHT files could be read and written by installing a browser extension, such as Mozilla Archive Format or UnMHT.

=== Safari ===
From version 3.1.1 onwards, Apple Inc.&#x27;s Safari web browser does not natively support the MHTML format. Instead, Safari supports the webarchive format, and the macOS version includes a print-to-PDF feature.

As with most other modern web browsers, support for MHTML files can be added to Safari via various third-party extensions.

=== Konqueror ===
As of version 3.5.7, KDE&#x27;s Konqueror web browser does not support MHTML files. An extension project, mhtconv, can be used to allow saving and viewing of MHTML files.

===ACCESS NetFront===
NetFront 3.4 (on devices such as the Sony Ericsson K850) can view and save MHTML files.

===Pale Moon===
Pale Moon requires an extension to be installed to read and write MHT files. One extension is freely available, MozArchiver, a fork of Mozilla Archive Format extension.

=== GNOME Web ===
GNOME Web added support for read and save web pages in MHTML since version 3.14.1 released in September 2014.

=== MHT viewers ===
There are commercial software products for viewing MHTML files and converting them to other formats, such as PDF and ePub. Some HTML editor programs can view and edit MHTML files.

==MIME type==
MIME type for MHTML is not well agreed upon. Used MIME types include:
* multipart/related
* application/x-mimearchive
* message/rfc822

==Other apps==

=== Problem Steps Recorder ===
Problem Steps Recorder for Windows can save its output to MHT format.

=== Save to Google Drive extension ===
The &quot;Save to Google Drive&quot; extension for Google Chrome can save as MHTML as one of its outputs.

===Microsoft OneNote===
Microsoft OneNote, starting with OneNote 2010, emails individual pages as .mht files.

===Evernote===
Evernote for Windows can export notes as MHT format, as an alternative to HTML or its own native .enex format.

== Exploits ==
In May 2015, a researcher noted that attackers could build malicious documents by creating an MHT file, appending an MSO object at the end (MSO is a file format used by the Microsoft Outlook e-mail application), and renaming the resulting file with a .doc extension. The delivery method would be by spam emails.

In April 2019, a security researcher published details about an XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability that could be exploited when a user opens an MHT file. Since the Windows operating system is set to automatically open all MHT files, by default, in Internet Explorer, the exploit could be triggered when a user double-clicked on a file that they received via email, instant messaging, or another vector, including a different browser.

== Alternatives ==
=== data URI scheme ===
The data URI scheme offers an alternative for including separate elements such as images, style-sheets and scripts in-line when serving an HTML request or saving an HTML resource for offline use. Like the embedded content within MHTML, data URIs use Base64 encoding of the external resources (which may be binary or text) to embed them in-line within the HTML markup. HTML pages saved with external elements embedded using the data URI scheme are standard web pages, and can be opened by any modern browser, including browsers not supporting MHTML such as Mozilla Firefox. Unlike MHTML, saving web pages with their external resources embedded using data URIs requires a third-party extension to be installed in the browser.

=== Mozilla Archive Format ===
The Mozilla Archive Format (MAFF) is a legacy Web archive file format that was supported by Firefox from 2004 to 2018 through an add-on. Unlike both MHTML and data URIs, MAFF uses a ZIP container to preserve both the HTML file and its external elements. In October 2017 the add-on developer announced the format would no longer be supported in future versions of Firefox.

<text>Otto Muehl (16 June 1925 – 26 May 2013) was an Austrian artist and convicted sex criminal, who was known as one of the co-founders as well as a main participant of Viennese Actionism and for founding the Friedrichshof Commune.

In 1943, Muehl had to serve in the German Wehrmacht. There he registered for officer training. He was promoted to lieutenant, and in 1944 he took part in infantry battles in the course of the Ardennes Offensive.

After the war, he studied teaching German and History, and Pedagogy of Art at the Wiener Akademie der bildenden Künste.

In 1972 he founded the Friedrichshof Commune, which has been viewed by some as an authoritarian sect, and that existed for several years before falling apart in the 1990s. In 1991, Muehl was convicted of sexual offences with minors and drugs offences and sentenced to 7 years imprisonment. He was released in 1997, after serving six and a half years, and set up a smaller commune in Portugal. After his release, he also published his memoirs from the prison (&quot;Aus dem Gefängnis&quot;).

== Viennese Actionism ==
In the 1960s, Muehl&#x27;s aim was &#x27;to overcome easel painting by representing its destruction process&#x27;. He made rhizomatic structures with scrap iron (&quot;&quot;Gerümpelplastiken&quot;), but soon proceeded to the &quot;Aktion&quot; in the vein of the New York Happenings. In 1962, when he was 37, the first &quot;Aktion&quot; &quot;Die Blutorgel&quot; was performed in Muehl&#x27;s atelier on Perinetgasse by Muehl himself, Adolf Frohner, and Hermann Nitsch. The &quot;Fest des psycho-physischen Naturalismus&quot; and &quot;Versumpfung einer Venus&quot; followed in 1963. From 1964 to 1966, many &quot;Malaktionen&quot; were filmed by Kurt Kren and photographed by Ludwig Hoffenreich. In 1966, a new concept of Aktion was developed with Günter Brus: instead of the canvas, the body became the scene of action. In 1968, Muehl, Brus, and Oswald Wiener organized an Aktionsveranstaltung titled &quot;Kunst und Revolution&quot; in the University of Vienna, which caused a scandal in the press; they were arrested and Brus emigrated to Berlin.

== From art to life ==

Gradually, Muehl began to distance himself from &quot;Aktion&quot;&quot;. He regarded the &quot;happening as a bourgeois art form, mere art&quot;. The &quot;transition from art to life&quot; resulted in the founding of the Friedrichshof commune as a kind of anti-society. The declared aim was the destruction of bourgeois marriage and private property, free love, and collective education of the children. In 1974 he played a small role as a member of an anarchic/therapy commune in Dusan Makavejev&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Movie&quot;. In the eighties, tensions within the commune increased until they culminated in a revolt. When, on top of that, Muehl was arrested and imprisoned in 1991, the commune fell apart. In 1998, Muehl moved to Faro, Portugal to live in a new commune experiment.

== Muehl&#x27;s authoritarianism at Friedrichshof commune ==

Critics such as former community member Andreas Schlothauer point to Muehl&#x27;s strong authoritarian tendencies. For example, Muehl did not expose himself to the rituals of the Aktionsanalyse. He required members to crush the &quot;body armor&quot; (after Wilhelm Reich) and in some individual cases he experimented with the so-called “Watschenanalyse” (&quot;slapping analysis&quot;). He also created a &quot;structure&quot;, in which all community members were placed in a hierarchical pecking order by numbering them. He established a &quot;first wife&quot; and prepared his son to become his successor. Paradoxically, in the hierarchical level right below Muehl was a strong matriarchal element of rival women, according to Schlothauer.

== Artistic activity after Actionism (1971 to 2013) ==

From 1971 onward, Muehl produced no more public actions. He became a painter in the expressionist style, and held regular lessons on painting for his communards in his Friedrichshof commune. He also directed several short movies there, such as the &quot;Friedrichshofer Kinderfilme&quot; (Children&#x27;s Films of Friedrichshof), which starred the children born within the commune. 

While serving prison time for the sexual abuse of minors, Muehl continued to be artistically engaged: he painted around 300 pictures and wrote about art theory.

In spite of his Parkinson&#x27;s disease, Muehl continued to be artistically active into old age. In 2002, he developed a method of digital painting that he called &quot;electric painting films&quot;.
Between 1998 and his death Muehl had two major solo exhibitions at the Vienna Museum for applied art. 
In 2010 Muehl celebrated his 85th birthday, on this occasion the Leopold Museum in Vienna showed an extensive exhibition of his late work.

== Public apology ==
In 2010 Muehl issued a public apology regarding the role he played in the Friedrichshof Commune. The apology was read out in a press conference before the opening of his exhibition at Vienna&#x27;s Leopold Museum.

== Quotes ==

* &quot;I&#x27;ve surely made mistakes in the community, but certainly not in sexuality.&quot; (Arte Metropolis, 8 December 2001)
* &quot;Why should the government dictate when you should have sex?” (FAZ, 22 February 2004)
* &quot;I&#x27;m not a child molester. This is nonsense. The girls were all developed. &quot;(DIE ZEIT, 26 February 2004)
* &quot;The statement of young people in the courtroom at that time made me speechless. I wanted to free them, but instead, I overwhelmed and offended them with sexual transgression. It definitely was not my intention. I hope they forgive me.&quot;

<text>The Cumans or Kumans were a Turkic nomadic people from Central Asia comprising the western branch of the Cuman–Kipchak confederation who spoke the Cuman language. They are referred to as Polovtsy in Rus&#x27;, Cumans in Western and Kipchaks in Eastern sources.

Related to the Pecheneg, they inhabited a shifting area north of the Black Sea and along the Volga River known as Cumania, from which the Cuman–Kipchaks meddled in the politics of the Caucasus and the Khwarazmian Empire. The Cumans were fierce and formidable nomadic warriors of the Eurasian Steppe who exerted an enduring influence on the medieval Balkans. They were numerous, culturally sophisticated, and militarily powerful.

Many eventually settled west of the Black Sea, influencing the politics of Kievan Rus&#x27;, the Galicia–Volhynia Principality, the Golden Horde Khanate, the Second Bulgarian Empire, the Kingdom of Serbia, the Kingdom of Hungary, Moldavia, the Kingdom of Georgia, the Byzantine Empire, the Empire of Nicaea, the Latin Empire, and Wallachia, with Cuman immigrants becoming integrated into each country&#x27;s elite. The Cumans played a role in the creation of the Second Bulgarian Empire. Cuman and Kipchak tribes joined politically to create the Cuman–Kipchak confederation. 
After the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus&#x27; in 1237, many Cumans sought asylum in the Kingdom of Hungary, as many of them had already settled there in the previous decades. The Cumans also played an important role in the Second Bulgarian Empire, the Byzantine Empire, the Latin Empire, and the Nicaea Empire&#x27;s Anatolia.

The Cuman language is attested in some medieval documents and is the best-known of the early Turkic languages. The &quot;Codex Cumanicus&quot; was a linguistic manual written to help Catholic missionaries communicate with the Cuman people.

== Names and etymology==
=== Cuman ===
&quot;Cuman&quot; appears in ancient Roman texts as the name of a fortress or gate. The Roman natural philosopher Pliny the Elder (who lived in the 1st century AD), mentions &quot;a fortress, the name of which is Cumania, erected for the purpose of preventing the passage of the innumerable tribes that lay beyond&quot; while describing the &quot;Gates of Caucasus&quot; (Derbent, or Darial Gorge). The Greek philosopher Strabo (died 24 AD) refers to the Darial Gorge (also known as the Iberian Gates or the Caucasian Gates) as &quot;Porta Caucasica&quot; and &quot;Porta Cumana&quot;.

The original meaning of the endonym Cuman is unknown. It is also often unclear whether a particular name refers to the Cumans alone, or to both the Cumans and the Kipchaks, as the two tribes often lived side by side.

Most other Turkic-speaking people (as well as most Muslim sources) called the Cumans some variant of &quot;Qipchaqs&quot;, while Armenians called them &quot;Xartesk&#x27;ns&quot;. Qumans were primarily used by Byzantine authors (and a few Arab sources), while the name used in Rus&#x27; tended to be &quot;Polovtsian&quot;.

In Turkic languages &quot;qu&quot;, &quot;qun&quot;, &quot;qūn&quot;, &quot;quman&quot; or &quot;qoman&quot; means &quot;pale, sallow, cream coloured&quot;, &quot;pale yellow&quot;, or &quot;yellowish grey&quot;. While it is normally assumed that the name referred to the Cumans&#x27; hair, Imre Baski—a prominent Turkologist—has suggested that it may have other origins, including:
* the color of the Cumans&#x27; horses (i.e. cream tones are found among Central Asian breeds such as the Akhal-Teke);
* a traditional water vessel, known as a &quot;quman&quot;; or
* a Turkic word for &quot;force&quot; or &quot;power&quot;.

Observing that the Hungarian exonym for Cumans—i.e. &quot;Kun&quot;, &quot;Kunok&quot;—appeared as &quot;Cunus&quot;, &quot;Cuni&quot; in the chronicles and was applied to earlier nomads such as Pechenegs or Oghuzes, György Györffy derived Kun from Huns, instead of &quot;Qun&quot;, which he kept separate from &quot;Kun&quot;. However, István Vásáry rejected Györffy&#x27;s hypothesis and contended that &quot;the Hungarian name of the Cumans must go back to one of their self-appellations, i.e. to &quot;Qun&quot;.&quot; In the Hypatian Codex, a certain individual is called &quot;Kuman&quot;, while in the parallel account of the Laurentian Codex he is called &quot;Kun&quot; (&quot;Polovčinu menem Kunui&quot;, Vásáry considers this a corruption of &quot;Kunu&quot;, Russian dative of &quot;Kun&quot;).

=== Cumania ===
Even after the Cumans were no longer the dominant power in their territory, people still referred to the area as Cumania. The Moroccan traveler, Ibn Battuta said of Cumania: &quot;This wilderness is green and grassy with no trees, nor hills, high or low ... there is no means of travelling in this desert except in wagons.&quot; The Persian historian Hamdallah Mustawfi (1281–1349) wrote that Cumania has a cold climate and that it has excellent pasturage and numerous cattle and horses. The 14th-century &quot;Travels&quot; of Sir John Mandeville, note that Cumania

=== Polovtsy ===
In East Slavic languages and Polish, they are known as the , derived from the Slavic root &quot;*polvъ&quot; &quot;pale; light yellow; blonde&quot;. &quot;Polovtsy&quot; or &quot;Polovec&quot; is often said to be derived from the Old East Slavic &quot;polovŭ&quot; (половъ) &quot;yellow; pale&quot; by the Russians—all meaning &quot;blond&quot;. The old Ukrainian word &quot;polovtsy&quot; (Пóловці), derived from &quot;polovo&quot; &quot;straw&quot;—means &quot;blond, pale yellow&quot;. The western Cumans, or Polovtsy, were also called &quot;Sorochinetses&quot; by the Rus&#x27;—apparently derived from the Turkic &quot;sary chechle&quot; &quot;yellow-haired&quot;. A similar etymology may have been at work in the name of the &quot;Śārī&quot;, who also migrated westward ahead of the Qun.

However, according to O. Suleymenov &quot;polovtsy&quot; may come from a Slavic word for &quot;blue-eyed&quot;, i.e. the &quot;plȃv&quot; (пла̑в) means &quot;blue&quot;, but this word also means &quot;fair, blonde&quot; and is a cognate of the above; cf. West Slavic Polish &quot;płowy&quot; ,Eastern Slavic &quot;polovŭ&quot;, Russian &quot;polóvyj&quot; (поло́вый), Ukrainian &quot;polovýj&quot; (полови́й). Blonde individuals likely existed among the Kipchaks, yet anthropologically speaking the majority of Turkic peoples had East Asian admixture and generally Kimeks–Kipchaks were dark-haired and brown-eyed. An alternative etymology of is also possible: the Slavic root &quot;*pȍlje&quot; &quot;field&quot; (cf. Polish, Russian &quot;pole&quot;), which would therefore imply that were &quot;men of the field&quot; or &quot;men of the steppe&quot; in contrast to the Lipovtsi.

=== Folban, Vallani, Valwe ===
In Germanic languages, the Cumans were called &quot;Folban&quot;, &quot;Vallani&quot; or &quot;Valwe&quot;—all derivatives of Proto-Germanic root *&quot;falwa-&quot; meaning &quot;pale&quot; (&gt; English &quot;fallow&quot;). In the German account by Adam of Bremen, and in Matthaios of Edessa, the Cumans were referred to as the &quot;Blond Ones&quot;.

=== Kipchak ===
As stated above, it is unknown whether the name Kipchak referred only to the Kipchaks proper, or to the Cumans as well. The two tribes eventually fused, lived together and probably exchanged weaponry, culture and languages; the Cumans encompassed the western half of the confederation, while the Kipchaks and (presumably) the Kangli/Kankalis (possibly connected to three Pecheneg tribes known collectively as Kangars) encompassed the eastern half. This confederation and their living together may have made it difficult for historians to write exclusively about either nation.

The Kipchaks&#x27; folk-etymology posited that their name meant &#x27;hollow tree&#x27;; according to them, inside a hollow tree, their original human ancestress gave birth to her son. Németh points to the Siberian &quot;qıpčaq&quot; &quot;angry, quick-tempered&quot; attested only in the Siberian Sağay dialect. Klyashtorny links Kipchak to &quot;qovï&quot;, &quot;qovuq&quot; &quot;unfortunate, unlucky&quot;; yet Golden sees a better match in &quot;qïv&quot; &quot;good fortune&quot; and adjectival suffix &quot;-čāq&quot;. Regardless, Golden notes that the ethnonym&#x27;s original form and etymology &quot;remain a matter of contention and speculation&quot;.

Seven Cuman tribes eventually settled in Hungary, namely:

*Toqsoba (meaning either &quot;plump leather bottle&quot;, &quot;tribe of the dusty steppe&quot;, or &quot;nine clans&quot; [compare Toquz Oghuz &quot;nine tribes&quot;]),
*Borcsol (&quot;Pepper Sons&quot;),

*Kór ~ Kól (&quot;little, few&quot;), 
*Iloncsuk (&quot;little snake&quot;), and 
*Koncsog (&quot;leather trouser&quot;).

Baskakov thought that the Moguty, Tatrany, Revugy, Shelьbiry, and Topchaki belonged to the Chorni Klobuky.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
The original homeland of the Cumans is unknown before their eventual settlement in the Eurasian steppe&#x27;s western part.

==== Qun ====
Chinese authors mentioned a Tiele tribe named 渾 (Mand. &quot;Hún&quot; (&lt; MC *&quot;ɦuon&quot;), possibly a transcription of underlying *&quot;Qun&quot;) located north of the Tuul River. The writings of al-Marwazi (c. 1120) state that a Turkic &quot;Qun&quot; people came from the northern Chinese borders—&quot;the land of Qitay&quot; (possibly during a part of a migration from further east). After leaving the lands of the Khitans (possibly due to the Khitans&#x27; expansion), the Qun entered the territory of the &quot;Śari&quot; people, whom the Quns expelled. Marwazi wrote that the Qun were Nestorian Christians.

Golden surmised that these Quns might have sprung &quot;from that same conglomeration of Mongolic peoples from which the Qitañ sprang&quot;; however, Golden later suggested that the Quns were Turkic. Despite this, it is possible that certain tribes forming a part of the Cuman–Kipchak conglomerate were of Mongolic origin. Golden considers the Ölberli to have originally been Mongolic-speaking and argues that they were pushed westwards as a result of socio-political changes among the Khitans.

The Syrian historian Yaqut (1179–1229) also mentions the Qun in &quot;The Dictionary of Countries&quot;, where he notes that &quot;(the sixth iqlim) begins where the meridian shadow of the equinox is seven, six-tenths, and one-sixth of one-tenth of a foot. Its end exceeds its beginning by only one foot. It begins in the homeland of the Qayi, Qun, Khirkhiz, Kimak, at-Tagazgaz, the lands of the Turkomans, Fārāb, and the country of the Khazars.&quot; The Armenian historian, Matthew of Edessa (died 1144), also mentioned the Cumans, using the name &quot;χarteš&quot;, meaning &quot;blond&quot;, &quot;pale&quot;, &quot;fair&quot;.

==== Kipchak relationship ====
It cannot be established whether the Cumans conquered the Kipchaks, if the Śari whom the Quns had defeated were to be identified as Kipchaks, or whether they simply represent the western mass of largely Kipchak-Turkic speaking tribes. The Quns and Śari (whom Czeglédy (1949:47-48,50) identifies with Yellow Uyghurs) were possibly induced into the Kimek union or took over said union and absorbed the Kimek. As a result, the Kipchaks presumably replaced the Kimeks as the union&#x27;s dominant group, while the Quns gained ascendancy over the westernmost tribes and became Quman (though difficulties remain with the Qun-Cuman link and how Qun became Cuman, e.g. &quot;qun&quot; + &quot;man&quot; &quot;the real Quns&quot;? &gt; *&quot;qumman&quot; &gt; &quot;quman&quot;?). Kimeks were still represented amongst the Cuman–Kipchaks as Yimek ~ Yemek.

Potapov writes that:

====Conquests====
The Cumans entered the grasslands of the present-day southern Russian steppe in the 11th century AD and went on to assault the Byzantine Empire, the Kingdom of Hungary, the Principality of Pereyaslavl and Kievan Rus&#x27;. The Cumans&#x27; entry into the area pressed the Oghuz Turks to shift west, which in turn caused the Pechenegs to move to the west of the Dnieper River. Cuman and Rus&#x27; attacks contributed to the departure of the Oghuz from the steppes north of the Black Sea. Mahmud al-Kashgari, writing in 1076, says that in the east Cuman territory bordered a town near Talas. The Cumans first entered the Bugeac (Bessarabia) at some point around 1068–1078. They launched a joint expedition with the Pechenegs against Adrianople in 1078. During that same year the Cumans were also fighting the Rus&#x27;. The Russian &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; mentions Yemek Cumans who were active in the region of Volga Bulgaria.

====Political organization====
The vast territory of the Cuman–Kipchak realm consisted of loosely connected tribal units that represented a dominant military force but were never politically united by a strong central power; the khans acted on their own initiative. The Cuman–Kipchaks never established a state, instead forming a Cuman–Kipchak confederation (Cumania/Desht-i Qipchaq/Zemlja Poloveckaja (Polovcian Land)/Pole Poloveckoe (Polovcian Plain)), which stretched from the Danube in the west to Taraz, Kazakhstan in the east. This was possibly due to their facing no prolonged threat before the Mongol invasion, and it may have either prolonged their existence or quickened their destruction.

Robert Wolff states that it was discipline and cohesion that permitted the Cuman–Kipchaks to conquer such a vast territory. Al-Idrīsī states that Cumania got its name from the city of Cumania; he wrote, &quot;From the city of Khazaria to the city of Kirait is 25 miles. From there to Cumanie, which has given its name to the Cumans, it is 25 miles; this city is called Black Cumania. From the city of Black Cumania to the city of Tmutorakan (MaTlUqa), which is called White Cumania, it is 50 miles. White Cumania is a large inhabited city ... Indeed, in this fifth part of the seventh section there is the northern part of the land of Russia and the northern part of the land of Cumania ... In this sixth part there is a description of the land of Inner Cumania and parts of the land of Bulgaria.&quot;

According to the 12th-century Jewish traveler Petachiah of Regensburg &quot;they have no king, only princes and royal families&quot;. Cumans interacted with the Rus&#x27; principalities, Bulgaria, the Byzantine Empire, and the Wallachian states in the Balkans; with Armenia and the Kingdom of Georgia (see Kipchaks in Georgia) in the Caucasus; and with the Khwarezm Empire in Central Asia. The Cumans–Kipchaks constituted an important element and were closely associated with the Khwarazmian royal house via marital alliances. The Cumans were also active in commerce with traders from Central Asia to Venice.

The Cumans had a commercial interest in Crimea, where they also took tribute from Crimean cities. A major area of commerce was the ancient city of Sudak, which Ibn al-Air viewed as the &quot;city of the Qifjaq from which (flow) their material possessions. It is on the Khazar Sea. Ships come to it bearing clothes. The Qifjiqs buy from them and sell them slaves. Burtas furs, beaver, squirrels...&quot; Due to their political dominance, the Cuman language became Crimea&#x27;s &quot;lingua franca&quot;. Thus the language was adopted by the Karaite Jewish and Crimean Armenian communities (who produced many documents written in Kipchak with the Armenian alphabet), where it was preserved for centuries up to the modern day.

=== Battles in Kievan Rus&#x27;, in Hungary, and in the Balkans ===
The Cumans first encountered the Rus&#x27; in 1055, when they advanced towards the Rus&#x27; Pereyaslavl principality, but Prince Vsevolod reached an agreement with them thus avoiding a military confrontation. In 1061, however, the Cumans, under the chieftain Sokal, invaded and devastated the Pereyaslavl principality; this began a war that would go on for 175 years. In 1068 at the Battle of the Alta River, the Cumans defeated the armies of the three sons of Yaroslav the Wise, Grand Prince Iziaslav I of Kiev, Prince Sviatoslav of Chernigov, and Prince Vsevolod of Pereyaslavl. After the Cuman victory, they repeatedly invaded Kievan Rus&#x27;, devastating the land and taking captives, who became either their slaves or were sold at markets in the south. The most vulnerable regions were the Principality of Pereyaslavl, the Principality of Novgorod-Seversk and the Principality of Chernigov.


The Cumans invaded and plundered the eastern part of the Kingdom of Hungary in 1091. The invading Cumans were leading by chieftain Kapolcs, they broke first in Transylvania, then the territory between the Danube and Tisza rivers. The Cumans tried to leave Hungary with their huge booty and prisoners, but King Ladislaus I of Hungary reached and defeated them near the Temes river. King Ladislaus offered the Christianity for the Cuman survivors, the majority of them accepted, thus the king settled them in Jászság. The rumor of the losing battle reached the Cuman camp, the Cumans threatened King Ladislaus with revenge and demanded to free the Cuman prisoners. King Ladislaus marched to the Hungarian border to prevent the next invasion. The two armies clashed near Severin, the Hungarian army was victorious, King Ladislaus killed Ákos, the Cuman chieftain.

The Cumans initially managed to defeat the Grand Prince Vladimir II Monomakh of Kievan Rus&#x27; in 1093 at the Battle of the Stugna River, but they were defeated later by the combined forces of Rus principalities led by Monomakh and were forced out of the Rus&#x27; borders to the Caucasus. In these battles some Pecheneg and Oghuz groups were liberated from the Cumans and incorporated into the Rus&#x27; border-guard system. Khan Boniak launched invasions on Kiev in 1096, 1097, 1105, and 1107.

In 1096, Boniak attacked Kiev and burned down the princely palace in Berestove; he also plundered the Kievan Cave Monastery. Boniak was defeated near Lubny in 1107 by the forces of the Kievan Rus&#x27; princes. The Cumans led by Boniak crushed the Hungarian army led by Coloman in 1099 and seized the royal treasury. In 1109, Monomakh launched another raid against the Cumans and captured &quot;1000 tents&quot;. In 1111, 1113, and 1116, further raids were launched against the Cumans and resulted in the liberation and incorporation of more Pecheneg and Oghuz tribes.

During this time, the Cumans raided the Byzantine Empire and Volga Bulgaria. Volga Bulgaria was attacked again at a later stage, by Khan Ayepa, father-in-law of Grand Prince of Kiev Yuri Dolgorukiy, perhaps at his instigation. The Volga Bulgars in turn poisoned Ayepa &quot;and the other princes; all of them died.&quot; In 1089, Ladislaus I of Hungary defeated the Cumans after they attacked the Kingdom of Hungary. In 1091, the Pechenegs, a semi-nomadic Turkic people of the prairies of southwestern Eurasia, were decisively defeated as an independent force at the Battle of Levounion by the combined forces of a Byzantine army under Emperor Alexios I Komnenos and a Cuman army under Togortok/Tugorkan and Boniak. Attacked again in 1094 by the Cumans, many Pechenegs were again slain. Some of the Pechenegs fled to Hungary, as the Cumans themselves would do a few decades later. In 1091/1092 the Cumans, under Kopulch, raided Transylvania and Hungary, moving to Bihor and getting as far as the Tisza and Timiș rivers. Loaded with goods and prisoners they then split into three groups, after which they were attacked and defeated by King Ladislaus I.

In 1092, the Cumans resumed their raids against the Rus&#x27; and also attacked the Kingdom of Poland: and reportedly reached northern cities located in Lithuania. In 1094-1095 the Cumans, led by Tugorkan, in support of the exiled Byzantine pretender Constantine Diogenes (as a pretext to plundering), invaded the Balkans and conquered the Byzantine province of Paristrion. The Cumans then advanced all the way to Adrianople and Anchialos but could not conquer them. In the following years, when knights of the First Crusade were passing through the empire, Byzantium offered the Cumans prestige titles and gifts in order to appease them; subsequently good relations ensued. From 1097 to 1099, Sviatopolk II of Kiev requested help from the Cumans against Coloman, King of Hungary, who was involved in a feud with Volodar of Peremyshl, Prince of Przemyśl. King Coloman and his army crossed the Carpathian Mountains and laid siege on Przemyśl, which prompted David Igorevich, an ally of Volodar Rostislavich, to persuade the Cumans, under Khan Boniak and Altunopa, to attack the Hungarians.

The Hungarian army was soundly crushed by the Cumans; the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; mentions that &quot;rarely did Hungarians suffer such slaughter as in this battle.&quot; In 1104 the Cumans were allied with Prince Volodar. In 1106, the Cumans advanced into the Principality of Volhynia, but were repelled by Sviatopolk II. In 1114, the Cumans launched an invasion, from the western Romanian Plain, into the Byzantine Balkans once more. This was followed up by another incursion in 1123/1124. In 1135, the Cumans again invaded the Kingdom of Poland. During the second and third crusades, in 1147 and 1189, crusaders were attacked by Cumans, who were allied to the Asen dynasty of the Second Bulgarian Empire, or who were in Byzantine service.

Cumans at that time also resettled in the Kingdom of Georgia and were Christianized. There they achieved prominent positions, helped Georgians to stop the advance of Seljuk Turks, and helped make Georgia the most powerful kingdom of the region (they were referred to as naqivchaqari). After the death of the warlike Monomakh in 1125, Cumans returned to the steppe along the Rus&#x27; borders. Fighting resumed in 1128; Rus&#x27; sources mention that Sevinch, son of Khan Boniak, expressed the desire to plant his sword &quot;in the Golden gate of Kiev&quot;, as his father had done before him.

On 20 March 1155, Prince Gleb Yuryevich took Kiev with the help of a Cuman army under the Cuman prince Chemgura. By 1160 Cuman raids into Rus&#x27; had become an annual event. These attacks put pressure on Rus&#x27; and affected trade routes to the Black Sea and Constantinople, in turn leading Rus&#x27; to again attempt action. Offenses were halted during 1166–1169, when Grand prince Andrey Bogolyubsky, son of Khan Ayepa&#x27;s daughter, took control of Kiev in 1169 and installed Gleb as his puppet. Gleb brought in &quot;wild&quot; Cumans as well as Oghuz and Berendei units. Later, the princes of the Principality of Chernigov attempted to use Khan Konchek&#x27;s army against Kievan Rus&#x27; and Suzdal. This Chernigov-Cuman alliance suffered a disastrous defeat in 1180; Elrut, Konchek&#x27;s brother died in battle. In 1177, a Cuman army that was allied with Ryazan sacked six cities that belonged to the Berendei and Torkil. In 1183, the Rus&#x27; defeated a large Cuman army and captured Khan Kobiak (Kobek) as well as his sons and other notables.

Subsequently, Khan Konchek concluded negotiations. Like his son Khan Köten, preceding the Mongol invasion, Khan Konchek was successful in creating a more cohesive force out of the many Cuman groups—he united the western and eastern Cuman–Kipchak tribes. Khan Konchek also changed the old Cuman system of government whereby rulership went to the most senior tribal leader; he instead passed it on to his son Koten. Igor Svyatoslavich, prince of the Principality of Novgorod-Seversk, attacked the Cumans in the vicinity of the Kayala river in 1185 but was defeated; this battle was immortalized in the Rus&#x27; epic poem The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign, and Alexander Borodin&#x27;s opera, &quot;Prince Igor&quot;. The dynamic pattern of attacks and counterattacks between the Rus&#x27; and the Cumans indicates that both rarely, if ever, were able to attain the unity needed to deal a fatal blow. The Cuman attacks on the Rus&#x27; often had Caucasian and Danubian European implications.

In the Balkans, the Cumans were in contact with all the statal entities. They fought with the Kingdom of Hungary, allied with the Bulgarians of the Second Bulgarian Empire (they were the empire&#x27;s most effective military component) and with the Vlachs against the Byzantine Empire. A variant of the oldest Turkic chronicle, Oghuzname (The Oghuz Khan&#x27;s Tale), mentions the Cumans fighting the Magyars, Rus&#x27;, Romanians (Ulak), and Bashkirs, who had refused to submit to their authority.

In alliance with the Bulgarians and Vlachs, the Cumans are believed to have played a significant role in the uprising led by brothers Asen and Peter of Tarnovo, resulting in victory over Byzantium and the restoration of Bulgaria&#x27;s independence in 1185. István Vásáry states that without the active participation of the Cumans, the Vlakho-Bulgarian rebels could never have gained the upper hand over the Byzantines, and ultimately without the military support of the Cumans, the process of Bulgarian restoration could never have been realized.

The Cuman participation in the creation of the Second Bulgarian Empire in 1185 and thereafter brought about basic changes in the political and ethnic sphere of Bulgaria and the Balkans. The Cumans were allies in the Bulgarian–Latin Wars with emperor Kaloyan of Bulgaria. In 1205, at the Battle of Adrianople (1205), 14,000 Cuman light cavalry contributed to Kaloyan&#x27;s crushing victory over the Latin Crusaders.

Cuman troops continued to be hired throughout the 13th and 14th century by both the Bulgarians and Byzantines. The Cumans who remained east and south of the Carpathian Mountains established a county named Cumania, which was a strong military base in an area consisting of parts of Moldavia and Wallachia.

=== Mongol invasions ===

Like most other peoples of medieval Eastern Europe, the Cumans put up a resistance against the relentlessly advancing Mongols led by Jebe and Subutai. The Mongols crossed the Caucasus mountains in pursuit of Muhammad II, the shah of the Khwarezmid Empire, and met and defeated the Cumans in Subcaucasia in 1220. The Cuman khans Danylo Kobiakovych and Yurii Konchakovych died in battle, while the other Cumans, commanded by Khan Köten, managed to get aid from the Rus&#x27; princes.

As the Mongols were approaching Russia, Khan Köten fled to the court of his son-in-law, Prince Mstislav the Bold of Galich, where he gave &quot;numerous presents: horses, camels, buffaloes and girls. And he presented these gifts to them, and said the following, &#x27;Today the Mongols took away our land and tomorrow they will come and take away yours&#x27;.&quot; The Cumans were ignored for almost a year, however, as the Rus&#x27; had suffered from their raids for decades. But when news reached Kiev that the Mongols were marching along the Dniester River, the Rus&#x27; responded. Mstislav of Galich then arranged a council of war in Kiev, which was attended by Mstislav Romanovich, Prince Yuri II of Vladimir-Suzdal and Mstislav Svyatoslavich of Chernigov.

The princes promised support to Khan Koten&#x27;s Cumans and an alliance between the Rus&#x27; and Cumans was formed. It was decided that the Rus&#x27; and Cumans would move east to seek and destroy any Mongols they found. The Rus&#x27; princes then began mustering their armies and moved towards the rendezvous point. The army of the alliance of the Rus&#x27; and Cumans numbered around 80,000. When the alliance reached Pereyaslavl, they were met by a Mongol envoy that tried to persuade them not to fight. This as well as a second attempt by the Mongols failed; the alliance then crossed the Dnieper River and marched eastward for nine days pursuing a small Mongol contingent, unknowingly being led by a false retreat. The battle took place near the Kalka River in 1223.

Due to confusion and mistakes, and the superb military tactics and fighting-qualities of the Mongols, the Rus&#x27; and Cumans were defeated. In the chaos the Cumans managed to retreat, but the Rus&#x27; failed to regroup and were crushed. The Cumans were allied at Kalka River with Wallach warriors named Brodnics, led by Ploscanea. Brodnics&#x27; territory was in the lower parts of the Prut river in modern Romania and Moldova. During the second Mongol invasion of Eastern Europe in 1237–1240 the Cumans were defeated again; at this time groups of Cumans went to live with the Volga Bulgars, who had not been attacked yet.

Istvan Vassary states that after the Mongol conquest, &quot;A large-scale westward migration of the Cumans began.&quot; Certain Cumans also moved to Anatolia, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. In the summer of 1237 the first wave of this Cuman exodus appeared in Bulgaria. The Cumans crossed the Danube, and this time Tsar Ivan Asen II could not tame them, as he had often been able to do earlier; the only possibility left for him was to let them march through Bulgaria in a southerly direction. They proceeded through Thrace as far as Hadrianoupolis and Didymotoichon, plundering and pillaging the towns and the countryside, just as before. The whole of Thrace became, as Akropolites put it, a &quot;Scythian desert.&quot;

A direct attack on Cumania came only in 1238–1239, and encountered serious resistance by various Cuman khans. The final blow came in 1241, when Cuman control over the Pontic steppes ended and the Cuman–Kipchak confederation ceased to exist as a political entity, with the remaining Cuman tribes being dispersed, either becoming subjects and mixing with their Mongol conquerors, as part of what was to be known as the Golden Horde (Kipchak Khanate) and Nogai Horde, or fleeing to the west, to the Byzantine Empire, the Second Bulgarian Empire, and the Kingdom of Hungary, where they integrated into the elite and became kings and nobles with many privileges. Other Cuman captives were sold as slaves, who would go on to become Mamluks in Egypt, who would attain the rank of Sultan or hold regional power as emirs or beys. Some of these Mamluks led by Sultan Baibars would fight the Mongols again, defeating them at the Battle of Ain Jalut and the Battle of Elbistan.

A group of Cumans under two leaders named Jonas and Saronius, the former of whom was higher in rank, entered the Latin Empire of Constantinople as allies about 1240, probably fleeing the Mongols. The name Saronius (found in Alberic of Trois-Fontaines, who calls the leaders kings) is probably a corruption of the Cuman name Sïčgan, meaning &quot;mouse&quot;. They assisted the Emperor Baldwin II in the capture of Tzurullon from the Nicaeans in that year. The following year the Christian daughters of Saronius married two of the leading noblemen of the empire, Baldwin of Hainaut and William of Meri, while Jonas&#x27;s daughter married Narjot III de Toucy, who had once served as regent of the empire in Baldwin&#x27;s absence. When Narjot died in 1241, his wife became a nun. Jonas died that same year and was buried in a tumulus outside Constantinople in a pagan ceremony. According to Aubrey, eight volunteer warriors and twenty-six horses were sacrificed at the funeral.

=== Settlement on the Hungarian plain ===


They became one of the important Turkic groups in Desht-i Kipchak region. After Kipchak unity was destroyed by the Mongol attack in 1239, one branch of the Cumans migrated to the Balkans, and another branch went down to the Anatolia. They later came into contact with Georgians, Hungarians and Turks.

The architect of the Georgian-Cuman relations was the David IV of Georgia. This event, which was one of the most important military reforms of David&#x27;s against the Seljuk invaders, took place when a high-level Georgian delegation visited the Cuman headquarters. To strengthen this alliance with the nomads, David married with Cuman King Atrak&#x27;s daughter Guranduht, and invited her relatives to settle in Georgia. David brokered a truce between the Kipchaks and Alans. Later on he has held some consultations with Vladimir II Monomakh, Grand Duke of Kiev who defeated Atrak in 1109, to ensure free passage of nomadic tribes into Georgia.

King Andrew II of Hungary granted the Burzenland region to the Teutonic Knights in 1211, with the purpose of ensuring security of the southeastern borders of his kingdom against the Cumans. The Teutonic Knights campaigned against the Cumans, on behalf of King Andrew, during the years of 1221–1225. However, the Teutonic Knights failed to defeat the Cumans and began to establish a country independent of the King of Hungary. In 1238, after Mongol attacks on Cumania, King Béla IV of Hungary offered refuge to the remainder of the Cuman people under their leader Khan Köten, who in turn vowed to convert his 40,000 families to Christianity. King Béla hoped to use the new subjects as auxiliary troops against the Mongols, who were already threatening Hungary. The Cumans were joined by the Iranian Jasz people, who had been living with the Cumans. Batu Khan of the Mongols then ordered Bela to stop giving refuge to the Cumans and made a particular point that if attacked the Cumans could easily run away, for they were skilled horseman, but not so for the Hungarians, who were a sedentary nation and had no such luxury. Bela rejected this ultimatum.

Around December 1240, news came that the Mongols were advancing towards Hungary. King Bela then installed front line defenses at the Carpathian Mountains, after which he returned to Buda and called a council of war and ordered unity against the Mongols. The opposite happened, however, as many of the barons were hostile towards the Cumans. The Hungarian barons noted that there were Cumans in the Mongol armies, but they did not realize that this was because they were conscripted into it and had no say in the matter. In particular the barons did not trust Köten, despite the fact that the Mongols had attacked his people for nearly 20 years. This chaos pushed Bela into a corner; feeling he needed to show his strength and keep the rebellious barons on his side, he ordered Köten to be placed under house arrest. This did not placate the barons and had an opposite effect of erroneously seeming to admit that the King harboured doubts about Köten, too. This angered the Cumans, who were far from happy about the actions taken against them, and who had done nothing to invite such actions and hated the Mongols. News arrived on 10 March that the Mongols had attacked the Hungarian defenses at the Carpathian passes. This prompted Bela to send a letter to Duke Frederick of Austria asking for help. Frederick had previously wanted Bela&#x27;s throne, but Bela responded by amassing a vast army and marching to the gates of Vienna, which forced Frederick to step back. On 14 March, news had arrived that the Carpathian defense forces were defeated by the Mongols. Ironically, given the suspicion of the Cumans, they were the only ones who seemed willing to fight the Mongols, the memory of the fate that had befallen them on the steppes still being fresh in their minds. By this time Bela had lost control of his army and many towns were destroyed. Soon thereafter Frederick arrived, and, wishing to harm the country&#x27;s defense (in revenge to Bela), he stirred up further feelings against the Cumans.

After crushing defeats and facing complete collapse, the Hungarians engaged in a suicidal betrayal of the Cumans, the people that had done the most in repelling the Mongols. Some of the barons went to Köten&#x27;s house with the intent of killing him as scapegoat or handing him over to the Mongols, possibly believing the Cuman–Kipchaks were Mongol spies. However, the barons had Köten assassinated in Pest on 17 March 1241. When news of this outrage reached the Cuman camp there was an eruption of &quot;Vesuvian intensity&quot;. In revenge for this victimization they slaughtered a vast number of Hungarians. The Cumans then left for the Balkans and the Second Bulgarian Empire, going on a rampage of destruction through Hungary &quot;equal to that which Europe had not experienced since the incursions of the Mongols&quot;.


With this departure of its only ally and most efficient and reliable military force, Hungary was now further weakened to attack, and a month later it was destroyed by the Mongols. After the invasion, King Béla IV, now penniless and humiliated after the confiscation of his treasury and loss of three of his border areas, begged the Cumans to return to Hungary and help rebuild the country. In return for their military service, Béla invited the Cumans to settle in areas of the Great Plain between the Danube and the Tisza rivers; this region had become almost uninhabited after the Mongol raids of 1241–1242. The Cuman tribes subsequently settled throughout the Great Hungarian Plain, creating two regions incorporating the name Cumania (&quot;Kunság&quot; in Hungarian): Greater Cumania (&quot;Nagykunság&quot;) and Little Cumania (&quot;Kiskunság&quot;). Six of these tribes were the Borchol (Borscol), who settled in county of Temes (the Borchol clan was also active around Rus&#x27;; they were also a tribe of the Golden Horde mentioned as Burcoylu); Csertan, who settled in Little Cumania; Olas, who settled in Greater Cumania; Iloncsuk, who settled in Little Cumania; Kor, who settled in the county of Csanad and the sixth being, possibly, Koncsog.

As the Cumans came into the kingdom, the Hungarian nobility suspected that the king intended to use the Cumans to strengthen his royal power at their expense. During the following centuries, the Cumans in Hungary were granted rights and privileges, the extent of which depended on the prevailing political situation. Some of these rights survived until the end of the 19th century, although the Cumans had long since assimilated with Hungarians. The Cumans were different in every way to the local population of Hungary—their appearance, attire, and hairstyle set them apart. In 1270, Elizabeth the Cuman, the daughter of a Cuman chieftain Seyhan, became queen of Hungary. Elizabeth ruled during the minority of her son (future king Ladislaus IV of Hungary) in the years of 1272–1277. A struggle took place between her and the noble opposition, which led to her imprisonment by the rebels; but supporters freed her in 1274. During her reign, gifts of precious clothes, land, and other objects were given to the Cumans with the intent to ensure their continued support, and in particular during the civil war between King Béla IV and Stephen V of Hungary, when both sides tried to gain Cuman support. During this conflict, in 1264, Béla sent Cuman troops commanded by the chieftain Menk to fight his son Stephen. Elizabeth married Stephen V; they were parents of six children. Their son, Ladislaus IV became the king of Hungary while her other son, Andrew of Hungary, became Duke of Slavonia.
By 1262, Stephen V had taken the title of &#x27;Dominus Cumanorum&#x27; and became the Cumans&#x27; highest judge. After his enthronement, the Cumans came directly under the power of the king of Hungary and the title of &#x27;Dominus Cumanorum&#x27; (judge of the Cumans) had passed to the count palatine, who was the highest official after the king. The Cumans had their own representatives and were exempt from the jurisdiction of county officials.

By the 15th century, the Cumans were permanently settled in Hungary, in villages whose structure corresponded to that of the local population, and they were Christianized. The Cumans did not always ally with the Hungarian kings—they assassinated Ladislaus IV; however, other sources suggest that certain Hungarian barons had a role in his murder, thus Ladislaus fell victim to his political enemies. The royal and ecclesiastical authorities incorporated, rather than excluded, the Cumans. The Cumans served as light cavalry in the royal army, an obligation since they were granted asylum. Being fierce and capable warriors (as noted by Istvan Vassary), they had an important role in the royal army. The king led them in numerous expeditions against neighbouring countries; most notably they played an important part in the Battle on the Marchfeld between Rudolf of Habsburg and Ottokar II of Bohemia in 1278—King Ladislaus IV and the Cumans (which numbered 16,000) were on Rudolf&#x27;s side.

Hungarian kings relied on the Cumans to counterbalance the growing independent power of the nobility. Royal policy towards the Cumans was determined by their military and political importance. The Hungarian kings continuously hoped to use Cuman military support, the main reason for the invitation to settle and continued royal favors to them. The kings&#x27; main aim was to secure Cuman loyalty by various means, including intermarriage between the Cumans and the Hungarian royal family. Ladislaus IV &quot;the Cuman&quot; (whose mother was Queen Elizabeth the Cuman) was particularly fond of the Cumans and abandoned Hungarian culture and dress for Cuman culture, dress, and hairstyle; he lived with his Cuman entourage and concubines, who were Küpçeç, Mandola, and Ayduva.

There were clashes between the Hungarians and Cumans in 1280 and 1282. The first involved the king convincing the Cumans not to leave the country, yet a small group still moved to Wallachia. The second was a battle between Cuman rebels and the king&#x27;s forces. The Battle of Lake Hód was a battle between the Kingdom of Hungary and the Cumans in 1282 and King Ladislaus IV of Hungary defeated the Cumans. The Cumans initially lived in felt yurts, but as time went by they gradually gave up their nomadic way of life. The head of Cuman clans served the dual role of a military leader and a judge. The Cumans, having their own jurisdiction, were exempt from Hungarian jurisdiction and appealed to the king only in cases of unsettled disagreements. The Cumans paid 3000 gold bullions a year to the king, as well as other products and animals (since King Béla IV). They had own priests and they were not paying port and custom dues. Cuman villages did not have landlords and thus no manors were established; this meant that the people of these villages bought off statute labour. The royal guard of the Hungarian kings were Cumans, called &quot;nyoger&quot;. From the 16th century onwards, the Cumans between the Danube and Tisza rivers were referred to as &quot;Kiskun&quot;, while who lived to the east of the Tisza river were referred to as &quot;nagykun&quot;. The majority of Cumans were exterminated during the Great Turkish War.


The Cumanians&#x27; settlements were destroyed during the Turkish wars in the 16th and 17th centuries; more Cumans than Hungarians were killed. Around 1702, Cuman and Jasz privileges were lost. The court sold all three districts to the Teutonic Knights, though the lordship of these three regions was returned to Hungary. In 1734, Karcag became a market town, due to the permission to organize fairs. During this time, it had bought off its borders as its own property for 43,200 Rhenish florins. On May 6, 1745, due to the cooperation between the Cumans and Jasz people, as well as their material strength of their communities, they were able to officially buy off their freedom by paying off more than 500,000 Rhenish florins and by arming and sending to camp 1000 cavalry. At the beginning of the 18th century, the Cumanian territories were resettled by Hungarian-speaking descendants of the Cumans. In the middle of the 18th century they got their status by becoming free farmers and no longer serfs. Here, the Cumans maintained their autonomy, language, and some ethnic customs well into the modern era. According to Pálóczi&#x27;s estimation, originally 70–80,000 Cumans settled in Hungary. Other estimations are 180–200,000.

Today there are still villages in Turkey, Kazakhstan and Ukraine founded by Cumans.

This prayer, which was translated into the Cuman language in order to Christianize Shamanist Cumans in Hungary, was recorded in the TRT Documentary Özü Türk program:

=== Cuman involvement in Serbia ===
Cuman involvement in Serbia first occurred as a result of marital ties between Serbia and Hungary. King Stephen V of Hungary gave his daughter, Catherine (whose mother was Queen Elizabeth the Cuman, daughter of the Cuman chieftain Seyhan) in marriage to Stefan Dragutin, son of King Stefan Uroš I of Serbia. King Uroš had promised both his son and King Stephen that he would make Dragutin king during his own lifetime; but he later declined this. Dragutin, in disappointment, requested aid from King Stephen, who said he would lend his Hungarian and Cuman troops. Subsequently, Dragutin set out with his troops and marched on his father. King Uroš had declined once more, and in 1276 Dragutin clashed with his father&#x27;s army in Gacko, winning the battle. Afterwards, Dragutin took the throne and became king of Serbia. After King Stephen&#x27;s death, his son, Ladislaus IV the Cuman, continued to support Dragutin, his brother-in-law. From 1270 onwards Cuman mercenaries and auxiliaries were present on both sides of the warring factions, sometimes ignoring the orders of the party they were fighting for, instead acting on their own and looting the countryside. The Cumans had also burned down Žiča, the former see of the archbishopric of the Serbian Church.

By 1272, the region of Braničevo in Serbia had become a Hungarian banate, but soon afterwards, its rulers, Kudelin and Darman succeeded in making it an independent state. Kudelin and Darman were either Cuman warriors in Bulgarian service or Bulgarian nobles of Cuman origin. This move to independence had angered Ladislaus IV as well as Dragutin, who wanted to crush the rebellion. Darman and Kudelin were supported by the Tatars of the Golden Horde (Kipchak Khanate) against the Hungarians and Serbs. Subsequently, Dragutin attacked the brothers but failed to defeat them. After this attack the brothers hired Cuman and Tatar mercenaries. Dragutin in turn went to his brother, King Milutin for help. Dragutin battled the brothers again, this time with King Milutin&#x27;s help as well as support from King Ladislaus IV (Cuman troops), and defeated them. After this King Ladislaus continued negotiations with Darman and Kudelin, but this had failed so he sent Transylvanian and Cuman troops against them. The Cumans had fought on both the Bulgarian and Hungarian-Serbian sides.

The Cumans were also involved with the semi-independent Bulgarian Tsardom of Vidin between 1290 and 1300, which had become a target of Serbian expansion. In 1280, a Bulgarian noble of Cuman origin, Shishman, became the ruler of Vidin. He was perhaps granted the position of despot of Vidin soon after the accession of another Bulgarian noble of Cuman origin, the Tsar George Terter I (r. 1280–1292), to the Bulgarian throne in 1280. Shishman was either a close relative or a brother of George Terter I. Shishman may have established his authority over the Vidin region as early as the 1270s, after the death of the previous ruler of that area, Jacob Svetoslav. Danilo, a Serbian archbishop, reported, &quot;At that time in the land of the Bulgars a prince called Shishman emerged. He lived in the town of Vidin, and obtained the adjacent countries and much of the Bulgarian land.&quot; Some years after, Shishman invaded Serbia and got as far as Hvosno. After failing to capture Ždrelo, he returned to Vidin, which was subsequently attacked and devastated by King Milutin. However, Milutin replaced him on his throne on the basis that he would become Shishman&#x27;s ally. In fact, the alliance was strengthened by Shishman marrying the daughter of the Serbian grand župan Dragos. Further security came about when Milutin later gave his daughter Anna as a wife to Shishman&#x27;s son Michael, who in 1323 became Tsar of Bulgaria.

=== Golden Horde and Byzantine mercenaries ===

The Cumans who remained scattered in the prairie of what is now southwest Russia joined the Mongol Golden Horde Khanate, and their descendants became assimilated with local populations including the Tatars. The cultural heritage of those Cuman–Kipchaks who remained was transferred to the Mongols, whose élite adopted many of the traits, customs, and language of the Cumans and Kipchaks; the Cumans, Kipchaks, and Mongols finally became assimilated through intermarriage and became the Golden Horde. Those Cumans, with the Turko-Mongols, adopted Islam in the second half of the 13th and the first half of the 14th century.

In 1071, Cumans participated in the Battle of Manzikert as mercenaries in the Byzantine army against the Seljuks. Emperor Romanus had sent the Cumans and Franks to secure the fortress of Ahlat on the shore of Lake Van. The Cumans, who did not receive their pay, later defected to the Seljuks. In 1086 Cumans devastated Byzantine settlements in the Balkans. Later the Cumans joined the Pechenegs and the former Hungarian king, Salomon, in plundering the Byzantine Balkan provinces. Subsequent to this, the Cumans gave aid to Tatos, the chief of Distra. In 1091 there was a disagreement in plunder shares between the Cumans and Pechenegs, which resulted in a breach between the two peoples; this contributed to the Cumans (led by Togortok/Tugorkan and Boniak, who had repeatedly raided Kievan Rus&#x27;) joining Alexios I Komnenos against the Pechenegs in the Battle of Levounion.

A couple of weeks afterwards the Cumans invaded the Balkans. After the Battle of Kalka River a large group with an estimated population of over 10,000 Cumans invaded Thrace where they pillaged towns that had recently come under the control of the Nicaean Empire. This continued until 1242 when Nicaean emperor John III Doukas Vatatzes, in response to the situation, won their favour with &quot;gifts and diplomacy&quot;. Thereafter he succeeded in settling most of them in Anatolia throughout the Meander valley and the region east of Philadelphia. Most of these Cumans enrolled in the army and soon afterwards were baptized. Vatatzes&#x27; policy towards the Cumans was distinguished by its enormous scale and relatively successful outcome.

Cumans had served as mercenaries in the armies of the Byzantine Empire since the reign of Alexios I Komnenos (1081–1118) and were one of the most important elements of the Byzantine army until the mid-14th century. They served as light cavalry (horse-archers) and as standing troops; those in the central army were collectively called &quot;Skythikoi/Skythikon&quot;. Other Cumans lived a more dangerous life as highlanders on the fringes of the empire, possibly being involved in a mixture of agriculture and transhumance, acting as a buffer between Nicaean farmers and Turkic nomads.

These Cumans were frequently mustered for Byzantine campaigns in Europe. In 1242 they were employed by Vatatzes in his siege of Thessaloniki. In 1256 emperor Theodore II Laskaris left a force of 300 Cumans with the Nicaean governor of Thessaloniki. In 1259, 2000 Cuman light cavalry fought for the Nicaean Empire at the Battle of Pelagonia. Cumans were again involved in 1261, where the majority of the 800 troops under Alexios Strategopoulos that retook Constantinople, were Cumans. Large Cuman contingents were also part of the Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos&#x27; European campaigns of 1263–1264, 1270–1272 and 1275. Cumans were again employed by emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos in 1292, in his campaign against the Despotate of Epirus. The Cumans, together with Turk mercenaries, terminated the campaign by an unauthorized retreat.

In contrast to their light cavalry counterparts, Cuman standing troops appear as a distinct group only once, albeit very significantly. During the election of Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos to the regency in 1258, after the consultation of Latin mercenaries, the Cumans present at the court offered their opinion on the matter in &quot;good Greek&quot;. This is indicative of the Cumans spending considerable time in the company of Greek speakers. The importance of this Cuman group came from its tendency to foster assimilation (Hellenization) and, through time, the social advancement of its members. An example of this influential group was Sytzigan (known as Syrgiannes after baptism), who before 1290 became &quot;Megas Domestikos&quot; (Commander-in-Chief of the Army) under Emperor Andronikos II. His son, Syrgiannes Palaiologos, attained the title of Pinkernes and was a friend of Andronikos III Palaiologos and John Kantakouzenos. An act from the archive of the Lavra of Athanasios mentions Cuman &quot;Stratioti&quot; (mercenaries from the Balkans) in the region of Almopia who received two &quot;douloparoikoi&quot; in &#x27;pronoia&#x27; (a Byzantine form of feudalism based on government assignment of revenue-yielding property to prominent individuals in return for military service) some time before 1184. CultureHorses were central to Cuman culture and way of life, and their main activity was animal husbandry. The knight Robert de Clari described the Cumans as nomadic warriors who raised horses, sheep, goats, camels, and cattle. They moved north with their herds in summer and returned south in winter. Some of the Cumans led a semi-settled life and took part in trading and farming, as well as blacksmithing, furriery, shoe making, saddle making, bow making, and clothes making.

They mainly sold and exported animals, mostly horses, and animal products. They attached feeding sacks to the bridles of their horses, allowing them to cover great distances. They could go on campaign with little baggage and carry everything they needed. They wore sheepskin and were armed with composite bows and arrows. They prayed to the first animal they saw in the morning. Like the Bulgars, the Cumans were known to drink blood from their horse (they would cut a vein) when they ran out of water far from an available source. Their traditional diet consisted of soup with millet and meat and included beer, curdled mare&#x27;s milk, kumis, and bread (though bread could be rare depending on location).

=== Traces of Cumans in Anatolia ===

In 1239–1240, a large group of Cumans fleeing from the Mongols crossed the Danube. This group, which had an estimated population of over 10 thousand, wandered for a long time to find a suitable place to settle in Thrace. John III Doukas Vatatzes who wanted to prevent Cumans invasion of Byzantine lands and to benefit from their military capabilities invited Cumans in Byzantine service. He settled some of them in Thrace and Macedonia, and some in Anatolia to the Meander (Menderes) Valley and some to the Phrygia and Bithynia. When the Ottomans conquered the lands they lived in, these Cumans intermixed with the Turkmen and were assimilated among Turks. It is thought that some of the Cumans who settled in Western Anatolia during the reign of  are the ancestors of a part of a community called Manav living in Northwest Anatolia today.

===Traces of Cumans in Romania===

Toponyms pointing at a Cuman presence were preserved in names of villages and places in the Wallachian Plain, for example: Comana, Comanca, Câmpia Comancei and Valea Comancei in Olt County, Comanii Vechi, Comăneanca (Prahova County), Vadul Cumanilor (near Calafat).

==Culture==
Horses were central to Cuman culture and way of life, and their main activity was animal husbandry. The knight Robert de Clari described the Cumans as nomadic warriors who raised horses, sheep, goats, camels, and cattle. They moved north with their herds in summer and returned south in winter. Some of the Cumans led a semi-settled life and took part in trading and farming, as well as blacksmithing, furriery, shoe making, saddle making, bow making, and clothes making. They mainly sold and exported animals, mostly horses, and animal products. They attached feeding sacks to the bridles of their horses, allowing them to cover great distances. They could go on campaign with little baggage and carry everything they needed. They wore sheepskin and were armed with composite bows and arrows. They prayed to the first animal they saw in the morning. Like the Bulgars, the Cumans were known to drink blood from their horse (they would cut a vein) when they ran out of water far from an available source. Their traditional diet consisted of soup with millet and meat and included beer, curdled mare&#x27;s milk, kumis, and bread (though bread could be rare depending on location).

The fundamental unit of Cuman society was the family, made up of blood relatives. A group of families formed a clan, led by a chief; a group of clans formed a tribe, led by a khan. A typical Cuman clan was named after an object, animal, or a leader of the clan. The names of the leaders of clans or tribes sometimes ended in &quot;apa/aba&quot;. Cuman names were descriptive and represented a personal trait or an idea. Clans lived together in movable settlements named &#x27;Cuman towers&#x27; by Kievan Rus&#x27; chroniclers.

The Cuman–Kipchak tribes formed sub-confederations governed by charismatic ruling houses—they acted independently of each other and had opposing policies. The territory controlled distinguished each Cuman tribe: the &quot;seashore&quot; Cuman tribes lived in the steppes between the mouths of the Dnieper and the Dniester; the &quot;coastal&quot; tribes lived on the coast of the Sea of Azov; the &quot;Dnieper&quot; tribes lived on both banks of the bend in the Dnieper Valley; and the &quot;Don&quot; Cumans lived in the Don River Valley. D. A. Rasovskii notes five separate independent Cuman groups: the central Asiatic, the Volga-Yayik (or Ural), the Donets-Don (between the Volga and the Dnieper), the lower course of the Dnieper, and the Danube.

The Rus&#x27; grouped the Cuman–Kipchaks into two categories: the Non Wild Polvcians—&#x27;civilized&#x27; Cumans of the western part of the Cuman–Kipchak confederation who had friendly relations with Kievan Rus&#x27;—and the Wild Polvcians —who formed the eastern part of the confederation and who had hostile relations with Kievan Rus&#x27;. As the Cuman–Kipchaks gained more territory, they drove off or dominated many tribes—such as the Oghuz, various Iranian and Finno-Ugric tribes, Pechenegs, and Slavs. They also raided the Byzantine Empire and a few times joined the Normans from southern Italy and the Hungarians in doing so. Over the course of time feudalism would take over the traditional social structure of the Cumans, and this led to the changing of identity from kinship to territory-based. Some of the Cumans eventually settled and led sedentary lives involved in agriculture and crafts such as leather and iron working and weapon making. Others became merchants and traded from their towns along the ancient trade routes to regions such as the Orient, Middle East, and Italy.

The Cumans also played the role of middlemen in trade between Byzantium and the East, which passed through the Cuman-
controlled ports of Sudak (Surozh), Oziv, and Saksyn. Several land routes between Europe and the Near East ran through Cuman territories: the Zaloznyi, the Solianyi, and the Varangian. Cuman towns—Sharukan, Suhrov/Sugrov, and Balin—appeared in the Donets River Basin; they were also inhabitted by other peoples besides the Cumans. Due to the practice of Cuman towns being named after their khans, town names changed over time—the town of Sharukan appears as Osenev, Sharuk, and Cheshuev. Rock figures called stone babas, which are found throughout southern Ukraine and other areas on the steppes of Russia, were closely connected with the Cuman religious cult of shamanism.

The Cumans tolerated all religions, and Islam and Christianity spread quickly among them. As they were close to the Kievan Rus&#x27; principalities, Cuman khans and important families began to slavicize their names—for example, Yaroslav Tomzakovych, Hlib Tyriievych, Yurii Konchakovych, and Danylo Kobiakovych. Ukrainian princely families were often connected by marriage with Cuman khans, lessening wars and conflicts. Sometimes the princes and khans waged joint campaigns; for example, in 1221 they attacked the trading town of Sudak on the Black Sea, which was held by the Seljuk Turks and which interfered with Rus&#x27;-Cuman trade.
The Cumans were reported to be handsome people with blond hair, fair skin and blue eyes, and attractive women. Cuman women had a high reputation for their beauty amongst the Russian aristocracy. Robert de Clari reported that the Cumans often wore a sleeveless sheepskin vest, usually worn in conjunction with bracers. Underneath the vest was worn a short or long sleeved tunic/tabard, extended to the mid calf, splitting in the front and back between the legs. Men wore trousers and a kaftan, each fastened by a belt, which was the traditional costume.

The women also wore caftans, as well as pants, dresses, and tunics shorter than those worn by men, sometimes split along the front, back, and sides. Clothes were commonly coloured deep crimson for decoration. Cuman men wore distinguishing conical felt or leather hats, pointed at the top with a broad brim (if made of felt) or a fur trim around the base (if made of leather). The brim of the hat formed a sharp angle at the front and upturned on the rear and at the sides. Women wore a large variety of head dresses and also wore conical hats but with a felt top and a cloth veil extending down the back.

This veil only covered the back neck and not the hair or face; another source states that it did cover the hair and that sometimes one or two braids were visible. Women wore a variety of jewellery, such as torques, a type of neck ornament consisting of one or several metal strands attached to a ribbon or necklace and hung around the neck, and head dresses that were made of a series of silver rings on a solid, cylindrically shaped material that was fastened at the temples. The men shaved the top of their head, while the rest of the hair was plaited into several braids; they also had prominent moustaches. Other Cumans also wore their hair very long, without shaving the top. The women had their hair loose or braided with buns twisting at the side. Both men and women followed a tradition of braiding coloured ribbons into their hair. For footwear, Cuman men and women wore long leather or felt boots with support straps connected to their belt. Both men and women wore cloth or metal arm bands.

When the Cuman–Kipchaks swore oaths, it was done with swords in the hands that touched the body of a dog cut in two. The Italian Franciscan friar, traveler, and historian, John of Plano Carpini, says that when the Hungarian prince married the Cuman princess, ten Cumans swore over a dog cut in half with a sword that they would defend the Kingdom of Hungary. The Christian writer and historian of the crusades, Jean de Joinville (c. 1224–c. 1317), mentions that when the Cumans and Byzantines made an alliance, the Cumans made a dog pass between both sides and cut it with a sword, obliging the Byzantines to do the same; the Cumans said that both they and the Byzantines should be cut in pieces if they failed each other. Joinville described a Cuman noble&#x27;s funeral: he was buried seated on a chair whilst his best horse and best sergeant were placed beside him alive.

Prior to this the sergeant was given a large sum of money by the Cuman leaders for the purpose of handing it back to them when they too would come into the afterlife. The Cuman khan also gave a letter of recommendation to the sergeant, which was addressed to the first king of the Cumans, in which the present king testified to the sergeant&#x27;s good character. After these proceedings a huge mound was raised above the tomb. Cumans were buried in their warrior outfits. Wolves were greatly respected by the Cuman–Kipchaks, and they would sometimes howl along with them in commune. The personal bodyguard of the khan were called Bori (wolf in Turkic). Like other nomadic nations, the Cuman–Kipchaks initiated blood bonds (with the purpose of symbolically cementing a bond) by the drinking or mixing of each other&#x27;s blood.
Amongst the Cuman–Kipchaks ethnic names often became personal names—this was also practiced amongst the Mongols. This practice involved naming newborns after the names of conquered tribes and people. Names such as &#x27;Baskord&#x27; (from the Bashkirs), &#x27;Imek&#x27; (from the Kimeks), &#x27;Kitan&#x27; (from the Mongol Khitan people), and &#x27;Urus&#x27; were used by the Cumans.

Friar William of Rubruck, a Franciscan traveler who visited the Mongols in 1253–55, provides another account of Cuman customs. He mentions that Cumans built statues for dead notables, facing east and holding a cup (these statues are not to be confused with the balbals, which represent the enemies that were killed by him). He also notes that for richer notables, the Cumans built tombs in the form of houses. Rubruk gives an eyewitness account of a man who had recently died: the Cumans had hung up sixteen horses&#x27; hides, in groups of four, between high poles, facing the four points of the compass. The mourners then also placed &quot;kumis&quot; for the dead man to consume. Other graves had plenty of stones statues placed around them (balbals), with four tall ones placed to face the points of the compass.

Rubrick also wrote &quot;Here the Cumans, who are called Chapchat [Kipchak] used to pasture their flocks, but the Germans call them Valans and their province Valania, and Isidorus calls (the region stretching) from the river Don as far as the Azov Sea and the Danube, Alania. And this land stretches from the Danube as far as the Don, the borderline of Asia and Europe; one can reach there in two months with quick riding as the Tatars ride... and this country which extends from the Danube to the Tanais [Don] was all inhabited by the Chapcat Comans, and even further from the Don to the Volga, which rivers are at a distance of ten days&#x27; journey...And in the territory between these two rivers [i.e. the Don and the Volga] where we continued our way, the Cuman Kipchaks lived.&quot;

For many years before the Mongol invasion, the Cuman–Kipchaks were in ambiguous relationships with their neighbours (often through marital and martial alliances), the Kwarizmians, Byzantines, Georgians, and the Rus&#x27;; at a given time they could be at peace with one, at war with another. The Byzantine Empire hesitated to go to war with the Cuman–Kipchaks north of the Danube River; instead, like the Hungarians, they chose to bribe them. Since Kwarizm had more important enemies, they hired the Cuman–Kipchaks for garrison duty. There were numerous ways the Cuman–Kipchaks could make a living as nomadic warriors. One could partake in questing and raiding with their tribe and subsequently keep the spoils. Another avenue was to seek employment as a mercenary in exchange for the guarantee of loot. One could serve in a garrison, although this caused those Cumans to eventually forget their light cavalry skills and become poor infantry. This was fully exploited when the Mongol army destroyed the Cuman–Kipchak garrison in Samarkand. Cuman–Kipchak women fought beside their fellow male warriors. Women were shown great respect and would often ride on a horse or wagon while the men walked.

In their travels, the Cumans used wagons to transport supplies as well as weapons such as mangonels and ballistas. Light felt tents with a frame consisting of wooden laths could be carried on top of wagons and easily be placed on the ground. The windows of the tents were &quot;grilled&quot; in such a way that it was difficult to see in but easy to see out. As the Cumans became more settled, they constructed forts for defence and settlement purposes. The Cuman–Kipchaks used dung for fires when firewood was not available. The Cumans had very strict rules (taboos) against theft, and thus would, without prohibition, loosen their horses, camels, and livestock (sheep, oxen) without shepherds or guards when they were stationary. The law of blood vengeance was common among the Cuman–Kipchaks.
The Cuman calendar was atypical, as it showed neither specific Christian influences nor any trace of the Chinese–Turkic twelve-year animal cycle; it appeared to be an archaic system.

=== Military tactics ===
Up until the late 11th and early 12th centuries, the Cumans fought mainly as light cavalry, later developing heavy cavalry. The main weapons of the Cumans were the recurved and, later, the composite bow (worn on the hip with the quiver), and the javelin, curved sword (a sabre less curved than a scimitar), mace, and heavy spear for lancing. Due to European influence, some of the later period Cumans wielded war hammers and axes. For defense they used a round or almond shaped shield, short sleeved mail armour, consisting of commonly alternating solid and riveted rows, Lamellar armour (iron or leather), leather cuirass, shoulder spaulders, conical or dome shaped iron helmet with a detachable iron or bronze anthropomorphic face plate (gold for princes and khans), and at times a camail suspended from the helmet, consisting of chain or leather.

The armour was strengthened by leather or felt disks that were attached to the chest and back. The items suspended from the belts were a bow case with bow, a quiver, a knife and a comb. They also wore elaborate masks in battle, shaped like and worn over the face. The Cuman Mamluks in Egypt were, in general, more heavily armed than Mongol warriors, sometimes having body armour and carrying a bow and arrow, axe, club, sword, dagger, mace, shield, and a lance. The Cuman Mamluks rode on larger Arabian horses in comparison to steppe ones.

The commonly employed Cuman battle tactic was repeated attacks by light cavalry archers, facing and shooting to the rear of the horse, then a feigned retreat and skilled ambush. To maintain this tactic to optimum efficiency, the Cumans kept a large number of reserve horses (10–12 remounts) to replace fatigued ones, so that a fresh horse was available at all times. The horsemen used oval shaped stirrups and employed a large bridle for their horses. Another important accessory was a small whip attached to the rider&#x27;s wrist. Tribal banners were either made of cloth with tribal emblems or dyed horse hair—with more tails signifying greater importance of the warrior or group. Some of the Cumans who moved west were influenced by Western heraldry, and they eventually displayed hybridized European-Cuman heraldry.

Niketas Choniates, while describing a Battle of Beroia in the late 12th century, gave an interesting description of the nomadic battle techniques of the Cumans:

They [The Cumans] fought in their habitual manner, learnt from their fathers. They would attack, shoot their arrows and begin to fight with spears. Before long they would turn their attack into flight and induce their enemy to pursue them. Then they would show their faces instead of their backs, like birds cutting through the air, and would fight face to face with their assailants and struggle even more bravely. This they would do several times, and when they gained the upper hand over the Romans [Byzantines], they would stop turning back again. Then they would draw their swords, release an appalling roar, and fall upon the Romans quicker than a thought. They would seize and massacre those who fought bravely and those who behaved cowardly alike.&quot;

Robert de Clari gave another description:

Each one has at least ten or twelve horses, and they have them so well-trained that they follow them wherever they want to take them, and they mount first on one and then on another. When they are on a raid, each horse has a bag hung on his nose, in which his fodder is put, and he feeds as he follows his master, and they do not stop going by night or by day. And they ride so hard that they cover in one day and one night fully six days&#x27; journey or seven or eight. And while they are on the way they will not seize anything or carry it along, before their return, but when they are returning, then they seize plunder and make captives and take anything they can get. Nor do they go armed, except that they wear a garment of sheepskin and carry bows and arrows.

The Cuman people practiced the shamanistic religion of Tengrism. Their belief system had animistic and shamanistic elements; they celebrated their ancestors and provided the dead with objects whose lavishness was considered an indicator to the recipient&#x27;s social rank.

The Cumans referred to their shamans as Kam (female: kam katun); their activities were referred to as qamlyqet, meaning &quot;to prophesy&quot;. The Cumans used Iranian words to designate certain concepts: &quot;uchuchmak&quot; (a native Turkic word cognate with Turkish &quot;uçuşmak&quot;) meaning &quot;fly away, paradise&quot; and &quot;keshene&quot; meaning &quot;nest&quot; (an Iranian borrowing; the concept was that the soul has the form of a bird).

Funerals for important members involved firstly creating a mound, then placing the dead inside, along with various items deemed useful in the afterlife, a horse (like the Bulgars), and sometimes a servant or slave.

Cuman divination practices used animals, especially the wolf and dog. The dog &quot;It/Kopec&quot; was sacred to the Cuman–Kipchaks, to the extent that an individual, tribe, or clan would be named after the dog or type of dog. Cumans had shamans who communicated with the spirit world; they were consulted for questions of outcomes.

The Cumans in Christian territories were baptized in 1227 by Robert, Archbishop of Esztergom, in a mass baptism in Moldavia on the orders of Bortz Khan, who swore allegiance to King Andrew II of Hungary.

== Codex Cumanicus ==

The Codex Cumanicus, which was written by Italian merchants and German missionaries between 1294 and 1356, was a linguistic manual for the Turkic Cuman language of the Middle Ages, designed to help Catholic missionaries communicate with the Cumans. It consisted of a Latin–Persian–Cuman glossary, grammar observations, lists of consumer goods and Cuman riddles. The first copy was written in the monastery of St. John near Saray. A later copy (1330–1340) is thought to have been written in a Franciscan friary. Later, different sections of the codex, such as the Interpreter&#x27;s Book (which was for commercial, merchant use) and the Missionaries&#x27; Book (which contains sermons, psalms and other religious texts along with Cuman riddles) were combined.

The Interpreter&#x27;s Book consists of 110 pages; pages 1–63 contain alphabetically arranged verbs in Latin, Persian and Cuman. The Missionaries&#x27; Book contains vocabulary listings, grammatical notes, Cuman riddles, religious texts and some Italian verses. The Cuman riddles are the oldest documented material of Turkic riddles and constitute Turkic folklore. Some of the riddles have almost identical modern equivalents (for example Kazakh). The Codex Cumanicus is composed of several Cuman–Kipchak dialects.

The Cumans&#x27; language was a form of Kipchak Turkic and was, until the 14th century, a lingua franca over much of the Eurasian steppes. A number of Cuman–Kipchak–Arabic grammar glossaries appeared in Mamluk lands in the 14th and 15th centuries. It is supposed that the Cumans had their own writing system (mentioned by the historian Gyárfás), which could have been a runic script. The supposition that the Cumans had a runic script is also suggested by the academic Hakan Aydemir, who mentioned a buckle with runic writing from a Cuman grave There was also some Khazar Jewish linguistic influence upon the Cumans—the Cuman words &quot;shabat&quot; and &quot;shabat kun&quot; (meaning Saturday) are related to the Hebrew word &quot;Shabbat&quot; (meaning Sabbath). These Hebrew influences in the language may have resulted from contact or intermarriage between Khazars and some of the Cumans in the mid-11th century.

== Cuman leaders ==

* Iskal or Eskel (compare OTrk 𐰔𐰏𐰠 &quot;Izgil&quot;, the endonym of a Western Turkic Nushibi tribe who would later join and be assimilated into the Volga Bulgars) who were mentioned by Ahmad ibn Fadlan after visiting Volga region in 921–922. They also were mentioned by Abu Saʿīd Gardēzī in his &quot;Zayn al-Akhbār&quot;. According to Bernhard Karlgren, Eskels became the Hungarian people Székelys. Yury Zuev thought that &quot;Iskal&quot; who is mentioned in the Laurentian Codex about the first military encounter of Cumans against the Ruthenians on February 2, 1061, is personification of a tribal name.
* Sharukan/Sharagan (also known as Sharukan the Elder), grand father of Konchak. He was another Polovotsian khan who was victorious against the Ruthenian army of Yaroslavichi at the Alta river (Battle of the Alta River). According to the Novgorod First Chronicle Sharukan was taken as prisoner by Svyatoslav II of Kiev in 1068, while no such information is provided in the Laurentian Codex. In May 1107 along with Bonyak, Sharukan raided a couple of Ruthenian cities (Pereyaslav and Lubny); however, already in August of the same year the collective Ruthenian army led by Svyatoslav carried out a devastating defeat to the Cuman Horde forcing Sharukan to flee.
* Bonyak/Maniak, Cuman khan who was actively involved in civil conflicts of Ruthenia. He had a brother Taz who perished at the battle on the Sula River in 1107. Bonyak was last mentioned in 1167 when he was defeated by Oleg of Siveria. Bonyak was a leader of the Cuman tribe Burchevichi that resided in steppes of the East Ukraine between modern cities of Zaporizhia and Donetsk.
* Tugorkan (1028–1096), was mentioned in essays of the Byzantine Princess Anna Komnene along with his compatriot Bonyak. He perished with his son at the battle on the Trubizh River against the Ruthenian army.
* Syrchan, a son of Sharukan. He was a leader of a Cuman tribe that lived on the right banks of Siversky Donets. Chronicles mentioned that after the death of Vladimir II Monomakh, grand prince of Kiev, Syrchan sent out an emissary and a singer Orev to Georgia after his brother Atrak/Otrok (who, with 40,000 Cuman troops, was in Georgia at the time), urging him to return. Khan Otrok agreed (giving up the fame and security he had won in Georgia), after smelling &quot;eyevshan&quot;, the grass of his native steppe. Syrchan was mentioned in the poem of Apollon Maykov (1821–1897) &quot;Emshan&quot;.
* Otrok/Atrak, a son of Sharukan and a brother of Syrchan. In 1111 he, along with his brother, withdrew to the Lower Don region after losing a battle against the Ruthenians. There Atrak&#x27;s horde joined the local Alans. In 1117 his army sacked Sarkel and 5 other cities belonging to the Torkils and Berendei forcing the local Pechenegs, Berendei and Torkils to flee to Ruthenia. Around the same time Atrak invaded the Northern Caucasus where he entered into conflict with local Circassians pushing them beyond the Kuban River. The conflict was settled by a Georgian King David IV of Georgia who offered military service to Atrak against Seljuks in 1118. David also married the daughter of Atrak—Gurandukht. After withdrawal of Atrak away from the Don region, the Alan&#x27;s duchy in East Ukraine was liquidated in 1116–17. Atrak returned after the death of Vladimir Monomakh in 1125.
* Khan Konchek/Konchak/Kumcheg (meaning &#x27;trousers&#x27;), grandson of Sharukan, son of Khan Otrok. He united the tribes of the eastern Cumans in the later half of the 12th century, after which in the 1170s and 1180s he launched a number of particularly destructive attacks on the settlements in the Duchy of Kiev, the Principality of Chernigov and the Principality of Pereyaslavl. Konchak gave aid to the princes of the Principality of Novgorod-Seversk in their struggle for control with the other Rus&#x27; princes. Along with Khan Kobiak/Kobek, Khan Konchak was routed on the Khorol River in 1184 during an assault on Kievan Rus&#x27;. In 1185, he defeated the army of Ihor Sviatoslavych, who was taken as a prisoner. Later, Konchak laid siege to Pereiaslav and ravaged the Chernihiv and Kyiv areas. His daughter married prince Vladimir Igorevich of Putivl (Igor&#x27;s son). It is hypothesized that Konchek was with the Cumans who helped Riurik Rostislavovich seizure and sack of Kiev in 1202. Khan Konchek is credited with certain technological advancements, such as Greek fire and a special bow that needed 50 men to operate. Konchek was noted by the Rus&#x27; to be &quot;greater than all the Cumans&quot;. He died in a skirmish that preceded the Battle of Kalka River. The struggle to repel Khan Konchak and his army by Ihor Sviatoslavych and the Rus&#x27; princes is immortalized in the epic The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign (&quot;Slovo o polku Ihorevi).&quot;
* Syrgiannés/Sıçğan It is seen that some of the Cumans, who were on the way to prevent the Seljuk Turks expansion and were taken into Byzantine service after a Mongolian invasion, also served in the imperial palace and rose to high positions in time. As a matter of fact, Syrgiannés (Sytzigan: Sıçğan: Rat), who was the son of one of the Cuman begs, was baptized and married a woman from the Palaiologos family, and later received the title of Megas Domestic. The presence of his descendants in the Byzantine Empire continued for nearly 100 years. The last representative of this The Cuman Family, which was later assimilated into Byzantine Culture was also named Syrgiannés, just like the first member of the family. Syrgiannés, who was the governor of Macedonia and Thrace, was the elder emperor II. After participating in the struggles between Andronikos and his grandson that started in 1320, he fell out of favor and led a dull life until he was killed by the emperor&#x27;s men in 1334.

== Appearance ==
The looks of a typical Cuman are a matter of debate. This is because in spite of their Eastern origins, several sources point at them being white, blue-eyed, and blond. It is important to elaborate, however, that the full range of available data sketches a more complex picture. While the written sources predominantly emphasize a fair complexion (e.g. Adam of Bremen referring to them as &quot;the blond ones&quot;) the craniometric and genetic data, as well as contemporary art, support the image of a people highly heterogenous in appearance. Skulls with East Asian features are often found in burials associated with the Cumans and Pechenegs in Europe.

The genetic material is mixed, albeit that European matrilineal DNA predominates (see also below). Unlike the written sources, paintings and miniatures from between the 12th and 14th century (close in time to the settlement of Cumans to Central Europe) tend to support the picture of a mixed population that is suggested by the craniometric and genetic analyses. In the Anjou Legendarium Cumans are depicted with East Asian features and dark hair, while a fresco in the Kraskovo church in Slovakia confirms the stereotype of the blond Cuman.

There are also depictions of Cumans with Caucasian features, but dark complexion (e.g. in the Képes Krónika Pictum). Notably, all of these phenotypes can be traced to groups described in Chinese and Arab sources, that are assumed to have later merged in the Cuman–Kipchak confederation. Fair complexion, e.g. red hair and blue or green eyes, were already noted by the Chinese among the Qincha (Kipchak), while the Tiele (to whom the Qun belonged) were not described as foreign looking, i.e. they were likely East Asian in appearance. A dark complexion was attributed to the Pechenegs by Ibn Fadlan, who did not specify, however, if their features are European or Asian. The Kipchak, Qun and Pechenegs all assimilated into the Cuman–Kipchak confederation, eventually.

==Legacy==
As the Cumans ceased to have a state of their own, they were gradually absorbed into Eurasian populations (certain families in Hungary, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Turkey, Romania, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Tatars in Crimea). The Cumans in Dobruja were assimilated into Bulgarian and Romanian people. Traces of the Cumans can still be found in placenames stretching from China to the Balkans, such as:
* the city of Kumanovo in North Macedonia;
* a Slavic village named Kumanichevo in the Kastoria region of Greece (renamed to &quot;Lithia&quot; in 1928);
* a Slavic village named Kumanich in the Drama region of Greece (renamed to &quot;Dasoto&quot; in 1927);
* Comăneşti in Romania;
* Kuman, a city in Xinjiang, China;
* Polovtsy, a town in Smolensk Oblast, Russia;
* Polovtsy in Mogilev Region, Belarus;

Some famous Crimean Tatar historians such as Halil Inalcik and Ilber Ortayli refused to use the term Tatar, Crimean Tatars are direct descendants of Cumans who were settled in Pontic Steppes before the Tatar migration. Historically, Cuman language is considered the direct ancestor of the current language of the Crimean Tatars with possible incorporations of the other languages, like Crimean Gothic.

By the end of the 15th century, the main prerequisites that led to the formation of an independent Crimean Tatar ethnic group were created: the political dominance of the Crimean Khanate was established in Crimea, the Turkic languages (Cuman–Kipchak on the territory of the khanate) became dominant, and Islam acquired the status of a state religion throughout the Peninsula. By a preponderance Cumanian population of the Crimea acquired the name &quot;Tatars&quot;, the Islamic religion and Turkic language, and the process of consolidating the multi-ethnic conglomerate of the Peninsula began, which has led to the emergence of the Crimean Tatar people. Over several centuries, on the basis of Cuman language with a noticeable Oghuz influence, the Crimean Tatar language has developed.

The flower, &quot;Kumoniga&quot; (melilot), is also a relic of the Cumans. The Gagauz people are believed by some historians to be descendants of the Cumans; the name Qipcakli occurs as a modern Gagauz surname. The etymology of the Sea of Azov is popularly said to derive from a certain Cuman prince named Azum or Asuf, who was killed defending a town in this region in 1067.

As the Mongols pushed westward and devastated their state, most of the Cumans fled to Hungary, as well as the Second Bulgarian Empire since they were major military allies. The Cuman participation in the creation of the Second Bulgarian Empire in 1185 and thereafter brought about basic changes in the political and ethnic sphere of Bulgaria and the Balkans. Bulgarian Tsar Ivan-Asen II was descended from Cumans and settled them in the southern parts of the country, bordering the Latin Empire and the Despotate of Thessalonica. Those territories are in present-day Turkish Europe, Bulgaria, and North Macedonia.

The Cumans who settled in Hungary had their own self-government in a territory that bore their name, Kunság, that survived until the 19th century. Two regions—Little Cumania and Greater Cumania—exist in Hungary. The name of the Cumans (&quot;Kun&quot;) is preserved in county names Bács-Kiskun and Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok and several municipalities such as Kunbaja or Kunhegyes. The Cumans were organized into four tribes in Hungary: Kolbasz/Olas in upper Cumania around Karcag and the other three in lower Cumania.
The Cuman language disappeared from Hungary in the 17th or 18th century, possibly following the Turkish occupation. The last person who was able to speak some Cumanian on a decaying level was István Varró from Karcag, who died in 1770. During the 1740s, when Cuman was no longer spoken, a Cuman version of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer suddenly surfaced. It was taught in schools in Greater Cumania and Little Cumania until the mid-20th century, in turn becoming a cornerstone of Cuman identity. In the 20th century enthusiastic self-styled Cumans collected &#x27;Cuman folklore&#x27;, which consisted of elements such as a traditional Cuman dance, Cuman characteristics such as pride and staunch Calvinism. (By religion, as may be seen by figures for religion in Hungary, the Kiskunság is almost entirely Roman Catholic, whereas in Nagykunság, Protestants do outnumber Catholics, but only narrowly.) This ethnic consciousness was linked to the legal privileges attached to the Cumans&#x27; territory. Their 19th-century biographer, Gyárfás István, in 1870 was of the opinion that they originally spoke Hungarian, together with the Iazyges population. Despite this mistake, he has the best overview on the subject concerning details of material used. Cuman influence is also present in the modern Hungarian language in the form of loanwords, particularly in the areas of horse-breeding, eating, hunting and fighting.

In 1918, after World War I, the Cuman National Council was formed in Hungary, which was an attempt to separate the Kunság region (Greater Cumania and Little Cumania) from the Hungarian state, with the aim of forming a new independent Cuman state in Europe. The Cuman National Council declared the independence of Kunság, and elected its president Count Gedeon Ráday on 18 December. However, the council&#x27;s efforts remained unsuccessful. In 1939, Cuman descendants organized celebrations for the 700th anniversary of their arrival in Hungary, where they emphasized their separate ethnic existence and identity with ceremonial speeches. In 1995, The Cuman Memorial Site was inaugurated as a tribute to the Cuman ancestors and the redemption of the former Nagykun District. In 2009, and subsequently 2012, a World Meeting of the Cumans was held in Karcag. During the first meeting, which lasted two weeks, academic conferences, historical exhibitions, publications, presentations of traditional and cultural festivals and lectures in relation to the Cumans were held. In the 2012 meeting, the minister for rural development, Sándor Fazekas, mentioned how Cuman traditions are still kept alive, such as costumes, folk songs, and food.

Toponyms of the Cuman language origin can be found in some Romanian counties of Galați, Teleorman and Vaslui, including the names of those three counties(-for Galați, debatable). When some of the Cumans moved to Hungary, they brought with them their Komondor dogs. The Komondor breed has been declared one of Hungary&#x27;s national treasures, to be preserved and protected from modification. The name Komondor derives from Koman-dor, meaning &quot;Cuman dog&quot;.

In the countries where the Cumans were assimilated, family surnames derived from the words for &quot;Cuman&quot; (such as &quot;coman&quot; or &quot;kun&quot;, &quot;kuman&quot;) are not uncommon. Traces of the Cumans are the Bulgarian surnames Kunev or Kumanov (feminine Kuneva, Kumanova) and Asenov, its variants in North Macedonia Kunevski, Kumanovski (feminine Kumanovska); the Kazakh surname Kumanov; the widespread Hungarian surname Kun; the Hungarian surnames of Csertan, Csoreg, Kokscor, Karacs, Kekcse; the Hungarian surname of Kangur—a byname of one of the families of Karcag (the words Kangur and Karcag derive from Qongur and Qarsaq respectively, and occur as modern day clan names of the Kazakhs—the Kipchak tribes Qongur and Qarsaq, as well as names used by the Kirgyz in the Manas epic—mentioned as Kongur-bay, lord of the Mongol Kalmyk people and the warrior Kongrolu); the Hungarian surname of Kapscog (from &quot;Kipchak&quot;)—Kapsog Tojasos Kovacs, a byname of Kovacs family, as well as the name of Eszenyi Kopscog of Hungary; and the Greek surname Asan. The names &quot;Coman&quot; in Romania and its derivatives, however, do not appear to have any connection to the medieval Cumans, as it was unrecorded until very recent times and the places with the highest frequency of such names has not produced any archaeological evidence of Cuman settlement.

Over time, Cuman culture exerted an influence on the Ceangăi/Hungarian Csangos and Romanian culture in Moldavia, due to the Hungarians in Moldavia socializing and mingling with the Cumans between the 14th and 15th centuries. Hakan Aydemir, a Turkic linguist, states that the &#x27;ir&#x27; of the Ceangăi/Csangos and Székelys dialect, which means &#x27;carve&#x27;, &#x27;notch&#x27;, as well as the words &#x27;urk/uruk&#x27; (meaning &#x27;lasso&#x27;, &#x27;noose&#x27;), &#x27;dszepu (meaning &#x27;wool&#x27;) and &#x27;korhany&#x27; (meaning &#x27;small mountain&#x27;, &#x27;hill&#x27;) are of Cuman–Kipchak origin. Additionally, the Cumans could have also had some connection with Székelys runes. Several Romanian as well as Hungarian academics believe that a significant Cuman population lived in Moldavia in the 15th century; these Cumans later assimilated into the Romanian population. People in Hungary with the surname Palóc are descended from the Cumans (and possibly Kabars and Pechenegs)—&quot;Palóc&quot; origintates from the Slavic word &quot;Polovets&quot;/&quot;Polovtsy&quot;. Although the Palócs were similar to the Hungarians in origins and culture, they were considered distinct groups by the Turks. The first written record of the word &quot;palóc&quot; as the name of a people appears in the Mezőkövesd register in 1784.
Some scholars believe there is also no connection between the Cumans and the Dutch surnames Kooman(s), Koman(s), Koeman(s), (De) Cooman(s) and Coman(s), used particularly in the Flemish area and the Dutch county of Zeeland. They believe these surnames are medieval and were used in the meaning of &#x27;merchant&#x27;. However, other scholars believe the Coumans surname found in the Low Countries and France has its origins in the Cumans.

The Cumans appear in Rus&#x27; culture in the Rus&#x27; epic poem &quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot; and are the military enemies of the Rus&#x27; in Alexander Borodin&#x27;s opera &quot;Prince Igor&quot;, which features a set of Polovtsian Dances.

The name Cuman is the name of several villages in Turkey, such as Kumanlar, including the Black Sea region. The indigenous people in the Altai Republic, Kumandins (Kumandy), are descended from the Cumans.
By the 17th century, the Kumandins lived along the river Charysh, near its confluence with the river Ob. A subsequent relocation to the Altai was driven by their unwillingness to pay &quot;yasak&quot; (financial tribute) to the Russian sovereign. N. Aristov linked the Kumandins—and the Chelkans—to the ancient Turks, &quot;who in the 6th–8th century AD created in Central Asia a powerful nomadic state, which received ... the name Turkic Kaganate&quot;.

Persons of Cuman/Kipchak origin also became Mamluk leaders: a prominent Cuman Sultan of the Egyptian Mamluk Sultanate, Sultan Baibars (reigned 1260–1277), defeated King Louis IX of France, and resisted the Mongol invasion, defeating the Mongol army at the Battle of Ain Jalut (1260) and the Battle of Elbistan (1277) (by using the feigned-retreat tactic). Mamluks in the empire retained a particularly strong sense of Cuman identity, to the degree that the biography of Sultan Baibars, as reflected by Ibn Shaddad, focused on his birth and early years in Desht-i-Kipchak (&quot;Steppe of the Kipchaks&quot;/Cumania), as well as enslavement and subsequent travels to Bulgaria and the Near East.

The historian Dimitri Korobeinikov relates how Baibars&#x27; story sums up the tragic fate of many Cumans after the Battle of the Kalka River (1223) and the Mongol invasion of Europe (1223–1242). Roman Kovalev states that this story can further be seen as a mechanism for the preservation of a collective memory broadly reflecting a sense of Cuman identity in the Mamluk Sultanate. In the latter part of the 1260s the Mamluks were allied with the Golden Horde against the Ilkhanate. The creation of this specific warrior class, described as the &quot;mamluk phenomenon&quot; by David Ayalon, was of great political importance.

In the Hungarian village of Csengele, on the borders of what is still called Kiskunsag (&quot;Little Cumania&quot;), an archeological excavation in 1975 revealed the ruins of a medieval church with 38 burials. Several burials had all the characteristics of a Cumanian group: richly jeweled, non-Hungarian, and definitely Cumanian-type costumes; the 12-spiked mace as a weapon; bone girdles; and associated pig bones. In view of the cultural objects and the historical data, the archeologists concluded that the burials were indeed Cumanian from the mid-13th century; hence some of the early settlers in Hungary were from that ethnic group. In 1999 the grave of a high-status Cumanian from the same period was discovered about 50 meters from the church of Csengele; this was the first anthropologically authenticated grave of a Cumanian chieftain in Hungary, and the contents are consistent with the ethnic identity of the excavated remains from the church burials. A separated area of the chieftain grave contained a complete skeleton of a horse.

=== Genetics ===

The ethnic origins of the Cumans are uncertain. According to some contemporary sources, the Cumans were reported to have had blond hair, fair skin and blue eyes (which set them apart from other groups and later puzzled historians), however, craniometric and genetic data, as well as contemporary art, support a picture of a people who were very heterogeneous in appearance.

A genetic study analyzing putatively Cuman specimens in Hungary determined that they had a high frequency of western Eurasian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineages. In a 2005 study by Erika Bogacsi-Szabo &quot;et al.&quot; of the mtDNA of the Cuman nomad population that migrated into the Carpathian basin during the 13th century, six haplogroups were revealed.

One of these haplogroups belongs to the M lineage (haplogroup D) and is characteristic of Eastern Asia, but this is the second most frequent haplogroup in southern Siberia too. All the other haplogroups (H, V, U, U3, and JT) are West Eurasian, belonging to the N macrohaplogroup. Out of the eleven remains, four samples belonged to haplogroup H, two to haplogroup U, two to haplogroup V, and one each to the JT, U3, and D haplogroups. In comparison to the Cumans, modern Hungarian samples represent 15 haplogroups. All but one is a West Eurasian haplogroup [the remaining one is East Asian (haplogroup F)], but all belong to the N lineage. Four haplogroups (H, V, U*, JT), present in the ancient samples, can also be found in the modern Hungarians, but only for haplogroups H and V were identical haplotypes found. Haplogroups U3 and D occur exclusively in the ancient group, and 11 haplogroups (HV, U4, U5, K, J, J1a, T, T1, T2, W, and F) occur only in the modern Hungarian population. Haplogroup frequency in the modern Hungarian population is similar to other European populations, although haplogroup F is almost absent in continental Europe; therefore the presence of this haplogroup in the modern Hungarian population can reflect some past contribution. &quot;The results suggested that the Cumanians, as seen in the excavation at Csengele, were far from genetic homogeneity. Nevertheless, the grave artifacts are typical of the Cumanian steppe culture; and five of the six skeletons that were complete enough for anthropometric analysis appeared Asian rather than European (Horváth 1978, 2001), including two from the mitochondrial haplogroup H, which is typically European. It is interesting that the only skeleton for which anthropological examination indicated a partly European ancestry was that of the chieftain, whose haplotype is most frequently found in the Balkans.&quot;

The study concluded that the mitochondrial motifs of Cumans from Csengele show the genetic admixtures with other populations rather than the ultimate genetic origins of the founders of Cuman culture. The study further mentioned, &quot;This may be the result of the habits of the Cumanian nomads. Horsemen of the steppes formed a political unit that was independent from their maternal descent or their language and became members of a tribal confederation. According to legends, Cumanians frequently carried off women from raided territories. So the maternal lineages of a large part of the group would reflect the maternal lineage of those populations that had geographic connection with Cumanians during their migrations. Nevertheless, the Asian mitochondrial haplotype in sample Cu26 may still reflect the Asian origins of the Cumanians of Csengele. However, by the time the Cumanians left the Trans-Carpathian steppes and settled in Hungary, they had acquired several more westerly genetic elements, probably from the Slavic, Ugric, and Turkic-speaking peoples who inhabited the regions north of the Black and Caspian Seas.&quot; The results from the Cuman samples were plotted on a graph with other Eurasian populations, showing the genetic distances between them. The Eurasian populations were divided into two distinct clusters. One cluster contained all the Eastern and Central Asian populations and can be divided into two subclusters; one subcluster includes mainly Eastern Asian populations (Buryat, Korean and Kirghiz Lowland populations), and the other subcluster harbors mainly Central Asian populations (Mongolian, Kazakh, Kirghiz Highland and Uyghur populations). The second cluster contained the European populations. Inside the second cluster, based on HVS I motifs, a clear structure was not detectable, but almost all European populations, including the modern Hungarians, assembled in one section with small distances between each other. Cumans were outside this section; they were found to be above the abscissa of the graph—this is the population from the second cluster, which is closest to the East-Central Asian cluster. The modern Cumans of Csengele, Hungary are genetically nearest to the Finnish, Komi and Turkish populations. The modern day Cuman descendants in Hungary are differentiated genetically from the Hungarians and other European populations.

In relation to the Kumandins, Pankratov regarded the Kumandins as being related anthropologically to the Urals, and suggested that they were less East Asian than the Altaians proper. A majority of mitochondrial DNA lines belonged to the North East Asian haplogroups C or D with also a large minority of west Eurasian lineages such as U.

=== In popular culture ===
Cumans appear as one of the civilizations that players can play as in the 2019 strategy game Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition. In addition, players can play a campaign which tells the story of their flight westwards as they retreat from the Mongols.

Cumans appear as antagonists in the 2018 role-playing game Kingdom Come: Deliverance and also in the 2025 sequel Kingdom Come: Deliverance II.

<text>The University of Vaasa (, ) is a multidisciplinary, business-oriented university in Vaasa, Finland. The campus of the university is situated by the Gulf of Bothnia adjacent to downtown Vaasa. The university has evolved from a school of economics founded in 1968 to a university consisting of four different schools: The School of Accounting and Finance, The School of Management, The School of Marketing and Communications and the School of Technology and Innovations. University of Vaasa is one of the largest business universities in Finland. The university has personnel of around 500 which includes a teaching staff of 180 and 54 professors. Around 5000 students are currently studying in various degree programs at the university.

== History ==
In 1966 the Council of State made the decision to establish a School of Economics and Business Administration in Vaasa, and so Vaasa got its first institution of higher education which the region of Vaasa had worked for since the 1940s. The very next year the first students started their studies; 90 business and 60 correspondence students. The first principal to be chosen for the school was Tryggve Saxén and the first vice principal was Mauri Palomäki, who later would become the longest serving principal the school has seen so far. The lectures were first held in a yard building of Vaasa Commercial College in Raastuvankatu street, but in its second year the school moved into the whole house as the commercial college moved to a new building.

In 1977 the school became a state institution along with all other academic institutions in Finland.

In 1980 education in Humanities (languages) began and so the school became a &quot;School of higher education&quot; (in Finland the term is &quot;Korkeakoulu&quot;). In 1983 studies in the Social Sciences began and in 1990 Technology studies began in connection with Helsinki University of Technology. In 1991 it changed its name to University of Vaasa. In 1992 the school was organised into four faculties; The Humanities, Business Administration, Accounting and Industrial Management, and Social Sciences. In 1994 the university moved into its new premises on Palosaari. The university got the right to award master&#x27;s degrees in Technology in 2004. In 2010 the university also reorganized its faculties to three, namely Faculty of Business Studies, Faculty of Technology and Faculty of Philosophy which includes previous faculties of Humanities and Social Sciences. In 2018 the university reorganized its structure again. Instead of three faculties, the University of Vaasa has four different schools: the School of Accounting and Finance, the School of Management, the School of Marketing and Communication studies and the School of Technology and Innovations.

== Campus ==
The university can be found in the neighbourhood of Palosaari beside the city&#x27;s old cotton mill, which also houses part of the university. Each building has its own name, like the main building of &quot;Tervahovi&quot; () and the governing building of &quot;Luotsi&quot; (). These buildings were finished in 1994 and planned in the spirit of the former county architect Carl Axel Setterberg who planned most of Vaasa&#x27;s public buildings in 1860. The part of the university placed in the old mill is called &quot;Fabriikki&quot; (). There is also the academic library of Tritonia, which the university shares with the other academic institutions in the city, and the laboratory of Technobothnia, which is shared with the city&#x27;s two universities of applied sciences. The whole campus is near the waterfront and surrounded by park areas. It is sometimes called the most beautiful campus in Finland.

<doc id="922693" wikidata="Q1122052" url="?curid=922693" title="Cumania">
<text>The name Cumania originated as the Latin exonym for the Cuman–Kipchak confederation, which was a tribal confederation in the western part of the Eurasian Steppe, between the 10th and 13th centuries. The confederation was dominated by two Turkic nomadic tribes: the Cumans (also known as the Polovtsians or &quot;Folban&quot;) and the Kipchaks. Cumania was known in Islamic sources as Dasht-i Qipchaq, which means &quot;Steppe of the Kipchaks&quot; or &quot;Kipchak Plains&quot; in Persian, and al-Qumāniyīn in Arabic. Russian sources have referred to Cumania as the &quot;Polovtsian Steppe&quot; (&quot;Polovetskaia Step&quot;), or the &quot;Polovtsian Plain&quot; (&quot;Pole Polovetskoe&quot;).

A different, more organized entity that was later known as the Golden Horde was also referred to as &quot;Comania&quot; by Armenian chronicler Hethum (Hayton) of Korykos. &quot;Cumania&quot; was also the source of names, or alternate names, for several smaller areas – some of them unconnected geographically to the area of the federation – in which Cumans and/or Kipchaks settled, such as the historic region of Kunság in Hungary, and the former Diocese of Cumania (in Romania and Hungary). Hethum of Korykos described Cumania as &quot;wholly flat and with no trees&quot;. Ibn Battuta said of Cumania, &quot;This wilderness is green and grassy with no trees, nor hills, high or low ... there is no means of travelling in this desert except in wagons.&quot; Battuta&#x27;s contemporary, Hamdallah Mustawfi, elaborated, 

==History and political interactions==

By the 11th and 12th centuries, the nomadic confederacy of the Cumans and (Eastern) Kipchaks (who were a distinct tribe with whom the Cumans created a confederacy, although other sources say that Cumans and Kipchak are simply different names for the same tribe ) were the dominant force over the vast territories stretching from present-day Kazakhstan, southern Russia, Ukraine, to southern Moldavia and eastern Wallachia in present-day Romania. Considering the nomadic way of life of these peoples, these frontiers can be regarded only as approximate; hence there were various definitions over what Cumania meant over the course of time. Depending on their region and their time, different sources each used their own vision to denote different sections of the vast Cuman territory: in Byzantine, Russian, Georgian, Armenian, Persian and Muslim sources, Cumania meant the Pontic steppe, that is the steppelands to the north of the Black Sea and on its eastern side as far as the Caspian Sea, where the lowlands between the Dnieper, the Volga, the Ural and the Irtysh rivers were favorable to the nomadic lifestyle of the Cumans. Later, for a short time period, in Western sources Cumania also referred to the area in eastern Wallachia and southern Ukraine (centered on the lowlands of Budjak and the Bărăgan Plain), referring to the area where the first contact between the Cumans and the Western Christians took place, and where, later, the Cumans of the region would accept Catholicism.

Using the traditional Turkic assignment of colours to the cardinal points, White Cumania used to be located to the west and may have denoted eastern Wallachia, while Black Cumania was located to its north and may have denoted Moldavia.
As in the case of many other large nomadic Eurasian confederacies, the ethnonym &quot;Cuman&quot; (referring to the inhabitants of Cumania) denoted different ethnic realities. While the main component was probably the Turkic-speaking tribes, the confederacy included other ethnic components as well. &quot;Cumania&quot; was primarily a political name, referring to the leading, integrating tribe or clan of the confederacy or state. The Cumans, when they first appear in written sources, are members of a confederacy irrespective of their tribal origin. Former tribal names disappeared when the tribe in question became part of a political unit. For instance, when we hear of an incursion of Cumans, it means that certain tribes of the Cuman confederacy took part in a military enterprise. In his &quot;History of the Mongols&quot;, the Persian historian Rashid-al-Din Hamadani, referred to Cumania around 1236–1237, during the Mongol invasion of Möngke, the future Great Khan of the Mongol Empire. Among others, he mentions the Kipchaks, the Turkophone Asi (probably the same as the later Jassic tribe) and the &quot;Karaulaghi&quot; (Black, i.e. &quot;from the north&quot;, Vlachs).

The vast territory of this Cuman-Kipchak realm, consisting of loosely connected tribal units who were the military dominating force, was never politically united by a strong central power. Cumania was neither a state nor an empire, but different groups under independent rulers, or khans, who acted on their own initiative, meddling in the political life of the surrounding states: the Russian principalities, Bulgaria, Byzantium and the Wallachian states in the Balkans, Armenia and Georgia (see Kipchaks in Georgia) in the Caucasus, and Khwarezm, having reached as far as to create a powerful caste of warriors, the Mamluks, serving the Muslim Arab and Turkish Caliphs and Sultans.

In the Balkans, we find the Cumans in contact with all of the statal entities of that time, fighting with the Kingdom of Hungary, allied with the Bulgarians and Vlachs against the Byzantine Empire. For example, Thocomerius, by name apparently a Cuman warlord (also known as Tihomir, he might have been a Bulgarian noble), was possibly the first one to unite the Bulgarian states, north from the Danube, from the west and the east of the Olt River, and his son Basarab I is considered the first ruler of the united and independent Wallachia. This interpretation corresponds with the general view of the situation of the Romanian lands in the 11th century, with the natives living in collections of village communities, united in various small confederacies, with more or less powerful chiefs trying to create little kingdoms, some paying tribute to the various militarily dominant nomadic tribes (see Romania in the Middle Ages).

This Pontic Cumania, (and the rest of the Cumanias to the east), ended its existence in the middle of the 13th century, with the Mongol invasion of Europe. In 1223, Genghis Khan defeated the Cumans and their Rus&#x27; allies at the Battle of Kalka (in modern Ukraine), and the final blow came in 1241, when the Cuman confederacy ceased to exist as a political entity, with the remaining Cuman tribes being dispersed, either becoming subjects of the Mongol conquerors as part of what was to be known as the Golden Horde, or fleeing to the west, to the Byzantine Empire, the Bulgarian Empire, and the Kingdom of Hungary.

==&quot;Kunság&quot; and the Catholic Diocese of Cumania==

On the Great Hungarian Plain, Cuman settlers gave their name to two regions known as Kunság, the Hungarian word for Cumania: Greater Cumania (&quot;Nagykunság&quot;) and Little Cumania (&quot;Kiskunság&quot;), located on the Great Hungarian Plain. Here, the Cumans maintained their language and some ethnic customs well into the modern era.

Cumania name was also preserved as part of the Catholic ecclesiastical structure with a &quot;Diocese of Cumania&quot; existing until 1523 in what is now Romania, long after the Cumans ceased to be a distinct group in the area. At Milcovul, years earlier, in 1227, the Cuman warlord Bortz accepted Catholic Christianity from missionary Dominican friars. Pope Gregory IX heard about the mass conversion of the Cumans, and on 1 July 1227 empowered Robert, Archbishop of Esztergom, to represent him to Cumania and in neighbouring Land of the Brodnici. Teodoric, the bishop of this new diocese, became the guardian of the Dominican Order in the Kingdom of Hungary.
Hence, Cumania diocese became part of the superior archbishopric of Esztergom, determining King Béla IV of Hungary to add &quot;Rex Cumaniae&quot; (King of Cumania) to his titles in 1228, and later to grant asylum to the Cumans in face of the Mongol invasion. The Diocese of Cumania, or of Milcovul, had subordinated in Transylvania the abbacy of Sibiu, the dioceses of Burzenland, Brasso and Orbai, and over the Carpathians, in the lands of the &quot;infidel&quot; Orthodox Vlachs (&quot;in partibus infidelium&quot;), all the Christian Catholics, irrespective of their ethnicity, despite the fact that many believers fell under the influence of the Romanian Orthodox &quot;pseudo&quot; bishops (&quot;episcopo Cumanorum, qui loci diocesanus existit, sed a quibusdam pseudoepiscopis Graecorum ritum tenentibus&quot;).

So, at that moment, Hungarian and Papal documents use the name Cumania to refer to the land between the eastern border of the lands of Seneslau and the land of the Brodnici (Buzău, southern Vrancea and southern Galați): that is Cumania meant, more or less, Muntenia. At that time, the use of the name &quot;Cumania&quot; should not to be understood as asserting the existence of a Cuman state, nor even a land inhabited by Cuman tribes (as the bulk of them had either fled, or were destroyed by the Mongols, and the rest had been absorbed) but rather to the Diocese of Cumania. From the military point of view, the land comprising the Diocese of Cumania was held either by the Teutonic Order (as early as 1222), or by the Vlachs (Brodnics or the Vlachs of Seneslau). The term Cumania had come to mean any Catholic subordinated to the Milcovul Diocese, so much so that in some cases, the terms Cuman and Wallach (more precisely, Catholic Wallach, as the Orthodox Christians were considered schismatic, and the Pope did not officially recognise them) were interchangeable.
In a charter from 1247, parts of this earlier Cumania were granted to the Knights Hospitaller, as were the Banate of Severin and the Romanian cnezats of Ioan and Lupu (&quot;a fluvio Olth et Alpibus Ultrasylvanis totam Cumaniam …excepta terra Szeneslai Woiavode Olacorum&quot;). These, from a juridical point of view, had an inferior status than the states of Seneslau (east of the Olt River) and Litovoi (west of the Olt River), cnezats which continued to belong to the Romanians (&quot;quam Olacis relinquimus prout iidem hactenus tenuerant&quot;), &quot;like they held them so far&quot;.

<text>Banaras Hindu University (BHU), formerly Benares Hindu University, is a collegiate, central, and research university located in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India, and founded in 1916. The university incorporated the Central Hindu College, which had been founded by theosophist and future Indian Home Rule leader Annie Besant in 1898. By 1911 Besant was marginalised on the governing board of the College by Madan Mohan Malviya who preferred a more traditional Hinduism with its hereditary caste system to Besant&#x27;s more theosophical one. Five years later Malaviya established the university with the support of the maharaja of Darbhanga Rameshwar Singh, the maharaja of Benares Prabhu Narayan Singh, and the lawyer Sunder Lal.

With over 30,000 students, and 18,000 residing on campus, BHU is the largest residential university in Asia. The university is one of the eight public institutions declared as an Institute of Eminence by the Government of India. It is also one of the 12 institutions from India in BRICS Universities League, a consortium of leading research universities from BRICS countries. The university&#x27;s main campus spread over , was built on land donated by Prabhu Narayan Singh, the hereditary ruler of Benares State. The south campus, spread over is built on land donated later by Aditya Narayan Singh in Sunderpur, hosts the Krishi Vigyan Kendra (Agriculture Science Centre) and is located in Barkachha in Mirzapur district, about from Varanasi.

BHU is organized into six institutes, 14 faculties (streams) and about 140 departments. , the total student enrolment at the university is 30,698 coming from 48 countries. It has over 65 hostels for resident students. Several of its faculties and institutes include Arts, Social Sciences, Commerce, Management Studies, Science, Performing Arts, Law, Agricultural Science, Medical Science, and Environment and Sustainable Development along with departments of Linguistics, Journalism &amp; Mass Communication, among others. The university&#x27;s engineering institute was designated as an Indian Institute of Technology in June 2012, and henceforth is Indian Institute of Technology (BHU). Centralised in 1916 through the Banaras Hindu University Act, Banaras Hindu University is India&#x27;s first central university. BHU celebrated its centenary year in 2015–2016.

==History==
The Banaras Hindu University was jointly established by Madan Mohan Malaviya, Annie Besant, Maharaja Rameshwar Singh of Darbhanga Raj and Prabhu Narayan Singh and Aditya Narayan Singh of Narayan dynasty, while the university is the brainchild of Malviya.

At the 21st Conference of the Indian National Congress in Benares in December 1905, Malaviya publicly announced his intent to establish a university in Banaras. Malaviya continued to develop his vision for the university with inputs from other Indian nationalists and educationists. He published his plan in 1911. The focus of his arguments was the prevailing poverty in India and the decline in income of Indians compared to Europeans. The plan called for the focus on technology and science, besides the study of India&#x27;s religion and culture:
&quot;The millions mired in poverty here can only get rid (of it) when science is used in their interest. Such maximum application of science is only possible when scientific knowledge is available to Indians in their own country.&quot;

-- Madan Mohan Malviya
Malaviya&#x27;s plan evaluated whether to seek government recognition for the university or operate without its control. He decided in favour of the former for various reasons. Malaviya also considered the question of medium of instruction and decided to start with English given the prevalent environment, and gradually add Hindi and other Indian languages. A distinguishing characteristic of Malaviya&#x27;s vision was the preference for a residential university. All other Indian universities of the period, such as the universities in Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, etc., were affiliating universities which only conducted examinations and awarded degrees to students of their affiliated colleges. Malaviya had supported Annie Besant&#x27;s cause and in 1903, he had raised 250,000 Rupees in donations to finance the construction of the school&#x27;s hostel. In 1907 Besant had applied for a royal charter to establish a university. However, there was no response from the British government.

Following the publication of Malviya&#x27;s plan, Besant met Malviya and in April 1911 they agreed to unite their forces to build the university in Varanasi.

Malaviya soon left his legal practice to focus exclusively on developing the university and his independence activities. On 22 November 1911, he registered the Hindu University Society to gather support and raise funds for building the university. He spent the next four years gathering support and raising funds for the university. Malaviya sought and received early support from the Kashi Naresh Prabhu Narayan Singh and Rameshwar Singh Bahadur of Raj Darbhanga. Thakur Jadunath Singh of Arkha along with other noble houses of United Provinces contributed for the development of the university.

On 22 March 1915, then Education Minister Harcourt Butler introduced the &quot;Benares Hindu University Bill&quot; in the Imperial Legislative Council&quot;.&quot; In his speech, he remarked about the university:The Benares Hindu University Bill was passed on 1 October 1915 and assented by the Viceroy and Governor-General of India on the same day.

BHU was finally established in 1916, the first university in India that was the result of people&#x27;s efforts. The foundation for the main campus of the university was laid by Lord Hardinge, the then Viceroy of India, on Vasant Panchami 4 February 1916. To promote the university&#x27;s expansion, Malviya invited eminent guest speakers such as Mahatma Gandhi, Jagadish Chandra Bose, C. V. Raman, Prafulla Chandra Ray, Sam Higginbottom, Patrick Geddes, and Besant to deliver a series of what are now called &quot;The University Extension Lectures&quot; between 5–8 February 1916. Gandhi&#x27;s lecture on the occasion was his first public address in India.

Sunder Lal was appointed the first vice-chancellor, and the university began its academic session the same month with classes initially held at the Central Hindu School in the Kamachha area, while the campus was being built on over of land donated by the Kashi Naresh on the outskirts of the city. The Nizam of Hyderabad and Berar, Mir Osman Ali Khan, also made a donation for the university.

The university&#x27;s anthem, called &quot;Kulgeet&quot;, was composed by university professor and eminent scientist Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar.

===Library===
The Banaras Hindu University Library system was established from a collection donated by P.K. Telang in the memory of his father Justice Kashinath Trimbak Telang in 1917. The collection was housed in the Telang Hall of the Central Hindu College, Kamachha. In 1921, the library was moved to the Central Hall of the Arts College (now the Faculty of Arts).

The present Central Library of BHU was established with a donation from Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III of Baroda. Upon his return from the First round Table Conference, Gaekwad wanted a library built on the pattern of the British Library and its reading room, which was then located in the British Museum. On Malviya&#x27;s suggestion, he made the donation to build the library on the BHU campus.

The Gaekwad Library is a designated &quot;Manuscript Conservation Centre&quot; (MCC) of the National Mission for Manuscripts, established in 2003.

By 1931, the library had built a collection of around 60,000 volumes. The trend of donation of personal and family collection to the library continued as late as the 1940s with the result that it has unique pieces of rarities of books and journals dating back to the 18th century.

As of 2011, the BHU Library System consisted of the Central Library and 3 Institute Libraries, 8 Faculty Libraries and over 25 Departmental Libraries, with a collection of at least 1.3 million volumes. The digital library is available to students and staff and provides online access to thousands of journals, besides access to large collections of online resources through the National Informatics Centre&#x27;s DELNET and UGC&#x27;s INFLIBNET.

==Student life==

===Festivals and traditions===

The Banaras Hindu University observes Saraswati puja day (also known as Vasant Panchami) as its foundation day. Goddess Saraswati is the Hindu goddess of knowledge, music, arts, wisdom and nature. She is also the revered mascot of the university, and is a part of the university seal.

There is an intra-university fest, Spandan, where students represent their faculty/institute in various art competitions such as literature (essay-writing, poems, debates), painting, sketches, vocal music, dancing, singing, drama, and mimicry. It is held every year after Vasant Panchami in the month of February or March. Apart from &quot;Spandan&quot;, each faculty and institute have their own in-house annual festivals.

Since 1971, annual flower exhibition is organised on &quot;Malaviya Jayanti&quot; (Malaviya&#x27;s birthday - 25 December).

The university anthem, &quot;Banaras Hindu University Kulgeet&quot;, is sung in chorus before the convocation or any other official event begins.

<text>Andrew Patrick Wood (January 8, 1966 – March 19, 1990) was an American musician who was the lead singer and lyricist for the alternative rock bands Malfunkshun and Mother Love Bone. He formed Malfunkshun in 1980 with his older brother Kevin Wood on guitar and Regan Hagar on drums. The band used alter ego personas onstage; Wood performed as Landrew the Love Child. Though the band only released two songs before going on an extended hiatus, &quot;With Yo&#x27; Heart (Not Yo&#x27; Hands)&quot; and &quot;Stars-n-You&quot;, on the &quot;Deep Six&quot; compilation album, they are often cited as being among the originators of the Seattle grunge movement. While in Malfunkshun, Wood started using drugs, entering rehab in 1985.

In 1988, Wood began jamming with Green River members Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament while Malfunkshun was on hiatus. They began writing original material and formed Mother Love Bone the same year, adding guitarist Bruce Fairweather (also a former member of Green River) and drummer Greg Gilmore to the lineup. In 1989, the band signed a deal with PolyGram issuing an EP, &quot;Shine&quot;, before going on tour, supporting The Dogs D&#x27;Amour. Near the end of the year, the band recorded their debut album, &quot;Apple&quot;, which was scheduled for release in 1990.

Struggling with drug dependence, Wood checked himself into rehab in 1989, hoping to get clean for the release of Mother Love Bone&#x27;s debut album. He died in Seattle on March 19, 1990, at the age of 24, after being found in a comatose state by his girlfriend following a heroin overdose.

==Early life==
Wood was born on January 8, 1966, in Columbus, Mississippi, to David C. Wood and Toni Wood; he grew up in Bainbridge Island, Washington. He was the youngest of three children; he had two older brothers, Kevin and Brian. Andrew and his brothers were exposed to various types of music by their parents, who also supported their children when they were learning how to play instruments. Andrew became a fan of acts including Elton John, Queen, Aerosmith, and Kiss.

==Career==

===Malfunkshun (1980–1988)===
In 1980, at the age of 14, Andrew Wood formed Malfunkshun with his brother Kevin, recording their first demo tape in April 1980. Drummer Regan Hagar joined the band soon afterwards, playing shows in Seattle. Each member adopted onstage alter egos, with Andrew becoming Landrew the Love Child, Kevin performing as Kevinstein, and Hagar becoming Thundarr. Unlike most grunge groups in Seattle, Malfunkshun were influenced by glam rock with Wood described as &quot;a hippie, glammed-out rock and roll god, equal parts Marc Bolan and Jim Morrison,&quot; with his look and vocal style influenced by frontmen such as Freddie Mercury, Paul Stanley, and Marc Bolan. Andrew Wood developed a drug habit at a young age, having smoked marijuana and cigarettes when he was 11 or 12. By 1985, he began to rely heavily on drugs to cope with having a &quot;rock star&quot; persona; he entered rehab later that year.

Malfunkshun recorded a number of demos in 1986, two of which, &quot;With Yo&#x27; Heart (Not Yo&#x27; Hands)&quot; and &quot;Stars-n-You,&quot; were included on the &quot;legendary&quot; &quot;Deep Six&quot; compilation album released by C/Z Records the same year. The band played shows in Seattle, opening for Soundgarden, The U-Men, and Skin Yard. However, in 1988, Malfunkshun disbanded.

Although the band never released an album during Wood&#x27;s lifetime and were turned down by Sub Pop for &quot;not [being] grunge enough,&quot; Malfunkshun, along with Green River, are often cited as an originator of the grunge movement.

===Mother Love Bone and final years (1988–1990)===

Wood and Hagar started playing with Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament of Green River, which disbanded in 1988, on occasion performing as the cover band Lords of the Wasteland. Former Green River guitarist Bruce Fairweather joined the lineup; former 10 Minute Warning and Skin Yard drummer Greg Gilmore replaced Hagar, forming Mother Love Bone in the same year.

The band soon signed a deal with PolyGram, and, through their own subsidiary label Stardog released a six-song EP, &quot;Shine&quot;, in 1989. John Book, of Allmusic, stated that the EP &quot;contributed to the buzz about the Seattle music scene.&quot; The rest of the year the band toured, including shows supporting The Dogs D&#x27;Amour; they also recorded their debut album. 

With high expectations for the album, Wood checked himself into rehab for heroin addiction, hoping to get clean before the album was released. In 1990, the band continued to play shows in Seattle, waiting for the release of their album, &quot;Apple&quot;. Wood died weeks before the release of the record.

==Death==
On March 16, 1990, Wood was found in a comatose state by his girlfriend, having overdosed on heroin. He was taken to Harborview Hospital and placed on life support. On March 19, physicians suggested that Wood be removed from life support and he was pronounced dead at 3:15 pm that day. The official cause of death recorded on Wood&#x27;s death certificate is hypoxic encephalopathy.

&quot;Apple&quot; was released posthumously later in the year, receiving positive reviews. David Browne of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Apple&quot; may be one of the first great hard-rock records of the 90s&quot; and that &quot;Andrew Wood could have been the first of the big-league Seattle rock stars.&quot;

==Legacy==
Shortly after Wood&#x27;s death, former roommate and friend Chris Cornell of Soundgarden wrote two songs, &quot;Reach Down&quot; and &quot;Say Hello 2 Heaven&quot;, as a tribute to him. Cornell approached Gossard and Ament about releasing the songs as singles before collaborating on an album. Adding drummer Matt Cameron, future Pearl Jam lead guitarist Mike McCready, and future Pearl Jam lead singer Eddie Vedder, they formed Temple of the Dog in 1990 to pay tribute to Wood, releasing a band-titled album in 1991.

Fellow Seattle band Alice in Chains dedicated their debut album &quot;Facelift&quot; to Wood. The song &quot;Would?&quot;, included in their second album &quot;Dirt&quot; and on the to the film &quot;Singles&quot; (1992), was written as an ode to Wood. In the liner notes of Alice in Chains&#x27; &quot;Music Bank&quot; box set collection, Jerry Cantrell said of the song:
In 1992, PolyGram reissued both &quot;Shine&quot; and &quot;Apple&quot; as the compilation album &quot;Mother Love Bone&quot;, while the song &quot;Chloe Dancer/Crown of Thorns&quot; was included on the to the film &quot;Singles&quot;. The same year, Los Angeles band Faster Pussycat wrote the song &quot;Mr. Lovedog&quot;, from the album &quot;Whipped!&quot;, in tribute to Wood. Bradley Torreano of Allmusic stated that the song &quot;offered a sad elegy to another charismatic figure in the metal world.&quot;

The Seattle rock band War Babies, which briefly featured Mother Love Bone&#x27;s Jeff Ament on bass, dedicated the song &quot;Blue Tomorrow&quot; off their eponymous 1992 debut album to Wood. In 1993, Seattle grunge band Candlebox released their self-titled debut featuring the single &quot;Far Behind&quot;, which was written in Wood&#x27;s memory.

Wood&#x27;s former bandmate Stone Gossard compiled Malfunkshun recordings from 1986 to 1987 and released a studio album &quot;Return to Olympus&quot; with the songs through his Loosegroove Records label in 1995. In 2005, director Scot Barbour completed production on the documentary &quot;&quot;. 

The film is about Wood&#x27;s music career as well as his family background. It premiered at the Seattle International Film Festival. In October of the same year, the film was screened at the FAIF Film Festival in Hollywood, California. The film was released in 2011 on DVD as part of a 2CD+DVD set entitled &quot;Malfunkshun: The Andrew Wood Story&quot; including the &quot;Return to Olympus&quot; album, a bonus CD including many interviews and demos, and the movie on the DVD disc.

In 2011, the album &quot;Melodies &amp; Dreams&quot; was released. It featured unreleased songs and demos which Wood had recorded throughout his life, including a song that he recorded with Chris Cornell, &quot;Island of Summer&quot;, &quot;Island of Summer&quot; is the only existing recording which has both of them singing together. Wood is featured in the 2011 documentary &quot;Pearl Jam Twenty;&quot; it is about the story of Pearl Jam. Friends including Chris Cornell, Jeff Ament and Stone Gossard talk about Wood in the film and home-made footage featuring Wood is shown.

<doc id="922711" wikidata="Q708858" url="?curid=922711" title="Jacques Lemercier">
<text>Jacques Lemercier (; c. 1585 in Pontoise – 13 January 1654 in Paris) was a French architect and engineer, one of the influential trio that included Louis Le Vau and François Mansart who formed the classicizing French Baroque manner, drawing from French traditions of the previous century and current Roman practice the fresh, essentially French synthesis associated with Cardinal Richelieu and Louis XIII.

==Life and career==
Lemercier was born in Pontoise. He was the son of a master mason, probably Nicolas Lemercier, one of a large interrelated tribe of professionals. Profiting by a voyage to Italy with a long stay in Rome, presumably from about 1607 to 1610, Lemercier developed the simplified classicizing manner established by Salomon de Brosse, who died in 1636, and whose &quot;Palais du Luxembourg&quot; for Marie de Medici Lemercier would see to completion.

On his return to France, after several years working as an engineer building bridges, his first major commission, however, was to complete the Parisian Church of the Oratorians, (1616), which had been begun by Clément Métezeau; its success made his reputation. As early as 1618 he appears as &quot;architecte du roy&quot;, with a salary of 1200 livres, out of which he had to reimburse his atelier. In 1625 Richelieu put him in charge of the main royal project, the galleries being added to the Louvre, where Lemercier was working to the design established by Pierre Lescot a generation before; for the sake of regularity, Lescot&#x27;s ranges in the &quot;Cour Carré&quot; were multiplied round further courtyards, quadrupling the building area, each of the four sides having a pavilion at its center. In this manner Lemercier built the northern half of the west side and the famous &quot;Pavillon de l&#x27;Horloge&quot; at the center of the west wing. Its high squared dome breaks the wing&#x27;s roofline and three arched openings provide access to the enclosed court. Two superposed orders of columns and rich sculptural decor in pediments and niches, on piers and panels are kept under control by strong horizontal cornice lines.

During 1638 and 1639, Lemercier was appointed &quot;premier architecte&quot; charged with supervision of all the royal building enterprises, in which capacity he fell into a disagreeable dispute with the cultivated Nicolas Poussin about the decorations in the Louvre.

The Hôtel de Liancourt (1623) stands out among Lemercier&#x27;s Paris &quot;hôtels particuliers&quot; for aristocratic patrons.

Lemercier built (from 1627 on) Richelieu&#x27;s Paris residence, the Palais-Cardinal, today&#x27;s Palais Royal. &quot;Richelieu&#x27;s palace was destroyed by fire in 1763. Only one remnant survives: a wall fragment with a relief of ship anchors and prows, signs of the Cardinal&#x27;s role as Superintendent of the Navy, which appeared throughout the palace.&quot; This remnant is located in the Galerie des Proues, on the east side of the second court (on the garden side), the so-called Cour d&#x27;Honneur. A more expansive town-planning project, one of the most ambitious non-military French projects of the century, was the palatial residence, the grand parish church and the entire new town of Richelieu, in Poitou (Indre-et-Loire). The lost Château de Richelieu itself was an improvisation on the theme set by Brosse&#x27;s Luxembourg. Also for the Cardinal Lemercier rebuilt the Château de Rueil, not so far from Paris, also demolished. The Château of Thouars, with its majestic long façade, is his also, and survives.

Less known, because gardens are less permanent, are parterre gardens laid out to Lemercier&#x27;s designs, at Montjeu, at Richelieu and at Rueil (Mignot; Gady).

At the Sorbonne, the college has been rebuilt, but its domed church (1635) is the acknowledged surviving masterpiece of Lemercier. The hemispherical dome on a tall octagonal drum, first of its type in France, has four small cupolas in the angles of the Greek cross above the two Corinthian orders on the façade, of full columns below, flat pilasters above. The interior was intended to be frescoed. The square intersection is surrounded by cylindrical vaults and a semicircular choir apse. The north side consists of a portico. In the church Richelieu was interred in 1642.

At the royal abbey church of Val-de-Grâce Lemercier succeeded the elder Mansart who completed the structure to the cornice line, and refused to agree to a change in the building&#x27;s design. Lemercier completed it with a dome.

Lemercier was engaged by Louis XIII in initial planning for an expansion of the hunting lodge at Versailles, a project which was only realized by other architects, notably Louis Le Vau and Jules Hardouin-Mansart, under the guidance of Louis XIV.

One of his last commissions was the design of the Church of Saint-Roch, where the cornerstone was laid by Louis XIV in 1653. With a length of 126 m. it is one of the largest churches of Paris. the deep choir emphasizes the extent of the interior, scarcely interrupted by the discreet low dome over the crossing, which is hidden on the exterior beneath the transept roof. Lemercier completed the choir and crossing and the rest of the interior was carried out to his plan. Work was interrupted 1701–1740 save for a chapel inserted 1705–1710 designed by Jules Hardouin-Mansart. The present façade is an 18th-century composition by Robert de Cotte.

In a long career, the scrupulous Lemercier amassed no fortune. Through in 1645, Lemercier was receiving, as first among the royal architects (&quot;premier architecte du Roi&quot;), a salary of 3,000 livres, after his death— in the house he had built for himself, still standing at n° 46 rue de l’Arbre Sec (Gady)— it was necessary to sell the large library he had collected, in order to settle his debts.

Lemercier died in Paris. He was succeeded as first royal architect by Louis Le Vau.

<doc id="922714" wikidata="Q871126" url="?curid=922714" title="Czech Republic at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Czech Republic competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s third appearance at the Summer Olympics after gaining its independence from the former &quot;Czechoslovakia&quot;. The Czech Olympic Committee sent the nation&#x27;s largest team to the Games since the post-Czechoslovak era. A total of 142 athletes, 80 men and 62 women, competed in 19 sports; the nation&#x27;s team size was roughly denser from Sydney by one sixth of the athletes. Women&#x27;s basketball was the only team-based sport in which the Czech Republic had its representation at these Olympic Games. There was only a single competitor in equestrian, artistic and trampoline gymnastics, judo, and weightlifting.

The Czech team featured two defending Olympic champions: slalom kayaker Štěpánka Hilgertová, who made her fourth Olympic appearance as the most experienced female athlete, and javelin throwing legend Jan Železný, who had won three consecutive Olympic titles throughout his illustrious sporting career, and competed at his fifth Olympics. Meanwhile, freestyle swimmer and top medal favorite Květoslav Svoboda was appointed by the committee to carry the Czech flag in the opening ceremony. Other notable Czech athletes featured decathletes and Olympic medalists Roman Šebrle and Tomáš Dvořák, double Olympic champion Martin Doktor in men&#x27;s sprint canoeing, and rifle shooter Kateřina Kůrková, who eventually married to the American and Olympic rifle prone titleholder Matt Emmons.

Czech Republic left Athens with a total of nine Olympic medals (one gold, three silver, and four bronze), surpassing the record set in Sydney four years earlier by just a single medal. Roman Šebrle, who previously won silver in Sydney, ended a 20-year drought to set an Olympic record and to receive the nation&#x27;s only gold medal in men&#x27;s decathlon, while Libor Capalini set a historic milestone for Czech Republic to pick up its first Olympic medal in modern pentathlon. Meanwhile, Věra Pospíšilová-Cechlová originally finished fourth in women&#x27;s discus throw. On December 5, 2012, the International Olympic Committee stripped off Belarusian Iryna Yatchenko&#x27;s silver medal after drug re-testings of her samples were found positive, lifting Cechlova&#x27;s spot to the bronze medal position. For Jan Železný, he ended his sparkling career with a disappointing ninth-place finish in men&#x27;s javelin throw at his fifth Olympic Games. On August 29, 2004, at the time of the closing ceremony, Zelezny was elected to the IOC Athletes&#x27; Commission, along with three other athletes.
