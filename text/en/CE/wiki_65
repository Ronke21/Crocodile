<text>The Isle of Man Railway (IMR) is a narrow gauge steam-operated railway connecting Douglas with Castletown and Port Erin in the Isle of Man. The line is narrow gauge and long. It is the remainder of what was a much larger network (over ) that also served the western town of Peel, the northern town of Ramsey and the mining village of Foxdale. Now in government ownership, it uses original rolling stock and locomotives and there are few concessions to modernity.

==History==
The line from Douglas to Port Erin is the last remaining line of the former Isle of Man Railway Company, formed in 1870. Its first line, from Douglas to Peel, opened on 1 July 1873, followed by the Port Erin line on 1 August 1874. Initially the Port Erin line had been planned to terminate at Castletown, but the construction of deep water docks at Port Erin caused an extension to the line. A few years after completion, the dock was destroyed by heavy seas and the idea of deep water vessels abandoned there. The remains of the breakwater are still visible at low tide.

A third line was built in 1878–1879 by the Manx Northern Railway, from St John&#x27;s (on the Douglas to Peel line) to Ramsey. A further short line was constructed from St John&#x27;s to Foxdale in 1885 to serve the lead mines there. Although it was built by the nominally independent Foxdale Railway, it was leased to and operated by the Manx Northern. The loss of the mineral traffic from Foxdale and competition for the Douglas-Ramsey passenger traffic from the Manx Electric Railway placed the Manx Northern Railway in financial difficulties. It was taken over by the IMR in 1904.

During the mid-1920s the IMR formed a bus subsidiary that operated most of the island&#x27;s bus services, and helped the railway to remain profitable into the 1960s. The first serious examination of the long term viability of the railway came with the Howden Report in 1949, which recommended the closure of the Ramsey line, which was already losing money; the eventual closure of the Peel line, which was breaking even in the late 1940s; and the retention of the then profitable Port Erin line. Howden also reported that the existing equipment of the railway had an economic life of 10–25 years. Economies were made throughout the 1950s and early 1960s. These included the ending of evening and Sunday services, the deferral of track maintenance, and cuts to train mileage as locomotives became unserviceable. To further reduce expenses, there were winter closures of the Peel line (1960–61 only) and the Ramsey line after September 1961, but A. M. Sheard, the then general manager, refused to close the Ramsey line which by this time was losing a considerable amount of money each year.

Following the closure of the County Donegal Railways in 1960, the IMR purchased the CDR&#x27;s two most modern diesel railcars, which were then largely used on the Peel line in summer, and after 1962 worked the whole of the winter service except when withdrawn for maintenance. The system closed after the 1965 season but was briefly revived when the Marquess of Ailsa obtained a lease and reopened all three routes in 1967. Both the Peel and Ramsey lines shut following the 1968 season, but goods services between Peel and Milntown (just short of Ramsey) continued until mid-1969. Traffic was poor on the two northern lines, especially that to Ramsey, so after the end of the 1968 season, Ailsa decided to concentrate on passenger service on the South Line for three more seasons until he took the option to end his lease at the close of the 1971 season.

There were occasional empty coaching stock workings between Douglas and St John&#x27;s in 1970 and 1971 for the retrieval of stored stock between seasons. During this time most of the early wooden framed carriages were moved to St John&#x27;s, where they were lost in a fire in July 1975. The Peel and Ramsey routes and the Foxdale line were lifted in 1975. The IMR operated services between Douglas and Port Erin after Lord Ailsa took his five-year option, beginning in 1972 through the centenaries of the Peel and Port Erin lines in 1973 and 1974 respectively. In 1975, the Port Erin line operated only from its southwestern terminus to Castletown, but it was found that half a railway made twice the loss. The government sponsored a short extension of the service from Castletown to Ballasalla in 1976, and, after extensive campaigning during the 1976 Tynwald elections, the railway returned to Douglas in 1977, the last year in which the railway was operated by the IMR. Following nationalisation the railway has continued to be operated seasonally, for many years from Easter weekend until the end of September, more recently from around 1 March to early November.

==Ownership==

Formed in 1870 with the first line following three years later, the Isle of Man Railway Company operated services until 1977 (see below) merging with the Manx Northern Railway and Foxdale Railway in 1905. The railway is now marketed as the &quot;Steam Railway&quot; to differentiate it from the Manx Electric Railway, operated by the same department. It was marketed as &quot;Isle of Man Railway&quot; until closure in 1965. From 1969 to 1972, it operated as the &quot;Isle of Mann Victorian Steam Railway Company Limited&quot;, reverting to Isle of Man Railway. When nationalised in 1978 it fell under the banner of &quot;Isle of Man Railways&quot;, along with the Manx Electric Railway. Re-branding to &quot;Isle of Man Passenger Transport&quot; took place from 1984 but the steam line was not affected, and this reverted to &quot;Isle of Man Railways&quot; from 1990, when a re-branding exercise took place with the emphasis on the Victorian origins of the railway. A change in management style occurred in 1999, and trains, trams and buses were presented as &quot;Isle of Man Transport&quot;. The electric railway was affected more by this change, with a series of non-historical and modern liveries, but in 2007 this was changed and the railway is marketed once more as the &quot;Isle of Man Railway&quot;. In keeping with the historical aspect, coaches and locomotives carry original names and transfers. The banner heading of all the railways was again changed in 2009 and became collectively known as &quot;Isle of Man Heritage Railways&quot;, although the &quot;heritage&quot; tag has been dropped latterly. Joint timetabling with the Manx Electric Railway sees the line titled as the &quot;Steam Railway&quot; in marketing material.

==Locations and Maps==
===South Line===
===Peel Line===
===North Line===
===Foxdale Line===
===Knockaloe Branch===
In addition to the main routes there was also a short-lived branch line/spur off the Peel Line between the terminus and St. John&#x27;s, serving an alien internment camp of the same name; this operated between 1915 and 1920. The line was on the outskirts of Peel near Glenfaba Mill, and climbed steeply in a southerly direction for about 0.7 miles until it reached the village of Patrick. It then turned west along the access road into the internment camp, which had been built in the grounds of Knockaloe Farm. The total length of the branch line was about 1.2 miles.

==South Line described==


Today&#x27;s railway is a fraction of its original size: it once served the western town of Peel, the northern town of Ramsey and the small mining village of Foxdale. Since 1969 only the southern line has been operational. Although it is only about half of its former size, Douglas Station is still an impressive complex. After crossing the River Douglas, the line climbs the two-and-a-half-mile-long 1-in-65 Nunnery Bank through a wide rock cutting that brings it through a large estate, and past an industrial estate to the White Hoe, where the island&#x27;s largest brewery is passed on the left of the train before crossing the first bridge.

The train continues to climb to Port Soderick, just before which passengers get the first view of the sea at Keristal, before descending into the railway station. The train then passes through Crogga Woods, under another bridge at Meary Veg (centre for the island&#x27;s sewage treatment works) and climbs, reaching its summit (, marked by a board visible from the train) close to the site of Ballacostain Halt. The train descends to Santon, the only intermediate station in substantially original condition. From here the train descends at 1 in 60 to Ballasalla railway station, with interesting sea-cliff views to the east. Regular service trains formerly passed each other here. After Ballasalla the line runs over relatively flat land past the request halt at Ronaldsway to the ancient capital of Castletown.

After Castletown the railway crosses the Silver Burn and heads northwest across country to the diminutive request stop at Ballabeg Station. It then turns west for the short run to Colby, which is popular with the locals. After a request stop at the Level the train continues to Port St Mary, with views of Bradda Head and Milner&#x27;s Tower on this stretch of line to Port Erin. Port Erin railway station is home to the Whistle Stop Coffee Shop, providing light refreshments, and the Isle of Man Railway Museum, established in 1975 with two locomotives and rolling stock including the Governor&#x27;s Saloon from the opening of the line in 1873.

The majority of the line runs through countryside, with only small stretches close to built-up areas. Many people start or end their journey in Port Erin, a Victorian seaside resort, or in Castletown, the ancient capital. Ronaldsway Halt, between Ballasalla and Castletown, is a few hundred yards&#x27; walk from the airport. There are several farm crossings and rural request stops, which largely serve adjoining fields and local communities, especially on the southernmost section which passes through agricultural land. The line passes along the southern plain after traversing the more hilly landscape north of Ballasalla.

==Post-Nationalisation==

When the railway was nationalised in 1978 Bill Jackson was appointed the first manager. During his time in office much progress was made, not all liked by the preservationists and supporters: negative developments overshadowing his tenure included the loss of the large railway yard at Douglas and the unpopular rebuild of No. 12 locomotive &quot;Hutchinson&quot;. Upon his retirement in 1987 he was replaced by Robert Smith, whose style was totally different and who made many changes. Smith masterminded the &quot;Year of Railways&quot; in 1993 and the celebrations that followed. Rolling stock returned to original &quot;purple lake&quot; livery and Nos. 10, 15 and 1 (in that order) were returned to service. When he resigned in 1999 he was replaced by David Howard, with previous bus experience at various UK operators and rail experience from his time at Tyne and Wear Metro. He was more inclined to a corporate approach and the railway had to follow suit. His time in office, finishing in 2006, will be remembered for the thrust on health and safety issues, such as high-visibility clothing and warning signs, as part of a Government-wide drive.

The government commissioned a study to see if it would be worthwhile to operate commuter services to help relieve the road traffic congestion in and around Douglas, and although experimental services were implemented in 2007, these operate only during TT race periods. The study recommended against such development. Nevertheless, almost all the line was relaid in the first few years of this century as part of the Department of Transport&#x27;s IRIS sewerage scheme, with all but one of the numerous level crossings converted from manual to automatic operation, saving the cost of employing crossing keepers. After Howard resigned, the Department of Tourism and Leisure&#x27;s Director of Leisure, Mike Ball, stepped in as acting director of public transport, and in early 2007 the leisure and public transport divisions of the department combined into &quot;service delivery&quot;, Ball becoming &quot;Director of service delivery&quot; under the minister Adrian Earnshaw appointed in November 2006. Ian Longworth was appointed Director of Public Transport in 2009 and since then the railway been the responsibility of the Department of Community, Culture and Leisure.

A number of new services have been introduced since the arrival of the new director, including evening excursion trains, a &quot;Rush Hour&quot; event at the start of each season, and family-oriented events including a &quot;Teddy Bears&#x27; Picnic&quot; and &quot;Fathers&#x27; Day&quot; specials. A restoration programme for the unique collection of rolling stock and locomotives remains ongoing; this has seen two saloon-type carriages completely rebuilt and back in traffic as part of the popular dining train with several more carriages to be restored, one of which has been out of traffic for nearly half a century. Locomotive restorations also continue, though the director retired in September 2022 and to date a successor has not been appointed. The 150th anniversary of the closed Peel Line was commemorated in 2023 with an extended &quot;Manx Heritage Transport Festival&quot; (billed once again as the &quot;Year of Railways&quot;) echoing the 1993 events, with the similar anniversary of the Port Erin Line due to be similarly celebrated in the summer of 2024 during another week-long event, original locomotives No.4 &quot;Loch&quot; and No.5 &quot;Mona&quot; taking a central part in the event with a combined age of three hundred years, though the latter is not operational, having been cosmetically restored by the Isle of Man Steam Railway Supporters&#x27; Association for the 2023 event.

==Locomotives==


===Steam===
All but one of the railway&#x27;s distinctive locomotives were built by Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company of Manchester between 1873 and 1926, with 16 steam locomotives in total. As of October 2023 there are four locomotives in traffic: No.4 &quot;Loch&quot;, No.11 &quot;Maitland&quot;, No.13 &quot;Kissack&quot; and M.N.Ry. No.4 &quot;Caledonia&quot;. In addition, No. 10 &quot;G.H. Wood&quot; and No.12 &quot;Hutchinson&quot; as of May 2024 are undergoing rebuilds. The Isle of Man Railway Museum is home to No.1 &quot;Sutherland&quot; of 1873 and No.5 &quot;Mona&quot; of 1874, with other locomotives No.6 &quot;Peveril&quot; at Port St. Mary Station and No.9 &quot;Douglas&quot; being cosmetically restored by the Isle of Man Steam Railway Supporters&#x27; Association. Only No.2 &quot;Derby&quot; has been lost, with only the frames of No.7 &quot;Tynwald&quot; in existence, privately owned off-island and No.3 &quot;Pender&quot; in the Manchester Science Museum.

===Diesel===
The railway also possesses three diesel locomotives: No.17 &quot;Viking&quot; which was withdrawn in 2010, No.18 &quot;Ailsa&quot;, used as shunting locomotive at Douglas station and the unnamed No. 21, a diesel electric locomotive delivered in December 2013. A number of smaller shunting locomotives and people carriers for departmental use also exist including two Motor-Rail units (No.24 &quot;Betsy&quot; and No.25 &quot;Sprout&quot;) based at Port Erin and Douglas stations respectively, and two Wickham people carriers (No.22 and No.23) used on departmental work and fire train duties as well as spells in use on the Manx Electric Railway when required. There are also two diesel railcar units (No.19 &amp; No.20) which are in storage at Douglas station partially restored having last operated in 1995.

In 2024 two modern, small diesel locomotives were acquired secondhand from Bord na Móna in Ireland, whose industrial rail system is being closed down due to the end of peat harvesting.

==Carriages==

About 30 carriages remain on the railway, of which 18 are in service, two in the Isle of Man Railway Museum, and the rest in storage. Several vehicles were sold off-island in 1975 for preservation, and at least one has been preserved privately on the island. Over 12 out-of-use carriages were lost in a fire that engulfed the large carriage shed at St John&#x27;s in 1975, and more were damaged beyond economic repair, including most of the remaining Manx Northern six-wheelers. There is an ongoing maintenance programme for returning carriages to traffic, which saw two saloons completely rebuilt and returned to traffic in 2011, with a further two in 2012, all of which now form part of the dining train.

In the winter of 2013, a replica of &quot;Empress Van&quot; F.27 was built on a steel underframe as a kitchen to work with the saloons as a dining train. Significant work was also done on the &quot;Cardinal&#x27;s Saloon&quot; F.35, which is used as the bar carriage, and the other saloons have being converted recently to dining cars seating 66 in total, giving the six saloon set as of 2015. Further restored stock include &#x27;pairs&#x27; carriages F.62 and F.63 in 2021 and 2022 respectively, timber framed F.11 in 2022 and work also ongoing on sister F.10 which is receiving similar treatment. F.15 also returned to service in the summer of 2022 with the programme of restorations ultimately to aim for three rakes of five or six compartment carriages.

Serviceable carriages at May 2024 are F.9, F.15, F.18, F.26, F.39 (the Foxdale Coach, numbered M.N.Ry. No.17 and restored to 1887 appearance), F.45, F.46, F.47, F.48, F.49, F.54, F.62 and F.63 with both F.10 and F.11 undergoing restoration works. In addition to these the dining train is made up of F.27 (ii) (a replica 1897-built &quot;Empress Van&quot;) and saloons F.29, F.30, F.31, F.32 and F.35. The remaining surviving carriages are stored in various states of repair, with Ducal Saloon F.75 in the museum with other non-passenger stock. Also on the railway is privately owned six-wheel Manx Northern Railway carriage M.N.Ry. No.6 which occasionally sees use during events. Withdrawn and stored carriages which remain on the island are F.21, F.25, F.43 - all at Port Erin Station with F.66, F.67 and F.74 at Jurby Airfield. A number of carriages are off-island, notably M.N.Ry. No.3 in Suffolk with M.N.Ry. No.1 amnd M.N.Ry. No.14 in private ownership with F.68 displayed at the Vale of Rheidol Railway since 2024 in restored condition.

==Operation==
The IMR has always had a marked seasonal pattern in traffic. Services evolved around two main considerations: the need to connect with ferries to and from the UK and Ireland, and to transport day trippers out of the major termini. The railway never evolved appreciable commuter traffic, so local traffic tended to revolve around shopping, attending markets, and trips to &quot;Town&quot;.

===1873–1879===
When the Isle of Man and Manx Northern Railways opened between 1873 and 1879, the basic service on all three main routes consisted of four or five trains a day. The first departures were timed to arrive in Douglas just before 08:30 to connect with the morning ferries to the UK. The trains returned from Douglas shortly after 09:00, crossing the second inbound trains of the day en route. All three routes then had a late morning/lunchtime, and late afternoon trains in both the up and down directions, with the day&#x27;s service ending with an early evening departure from Douglas. The February 1878 timetable shows departures from Douglas to Peel at 09:00, 11:00, 14:15, 17:15 and 19:40, and to Port Erin at 08:30, 10:10, 14:10, 17:00, and 19:35. From Peel to Douglas trains departed at 07:40, 10:05, 13:00, 16:00, and 18:30, and from Port Erin at 07:20, 09:50, 12:30, 15:40, and 18:20. This rather basic service tended to increase until after World War Two: seven trains each way on the three main routes was the usual winter timetable in the 1920s and 30s. From 1886 to 1940, the Foxdale branch was served by up to four round trips on weekdays from St John&#x27;s.

Additional trains were added to the basic service at Easter and again at Whitsun. The high season timetable usually came into effect on the first Monday of July, or immediately following Tynwald Day (5 July). This often stretched the railway&#x27;s resources to the limit. At its height in the 1920s, the railway was carrying well over a million passengers a year. In this timetable there were up to 15 round trips on the Peel and Port Erin lines, and up to 14 on the Ramsey line, with even Foxdale seeing a half dozen trains each day. In 1927, during the &quot;Bus War&quot;, the IMR boasted that it ran &quot;100 trains a day at pre-war prices.&quot;

===1930–1945===
In the 1930s, following the integration of train and bus services, the summer train service was trimmed to about a dozen trains each way on all three main routes. This intensive service ran on an entirely single-track system controlled by staff and ticket safeworking, with limited semaphore signalling. As the UK&#x27;s 1889 Railways Act did not apply on the island, there were no signal interlockings except at Douglas and St John&#x27;s, though limited interlocking in the form of slot detectors was fitted at passing loops from 1927 onwards. Continuous vacuum brakes were not fitted until 1925–27. In spite of this the railway has seen very few serious accidents (see below).

During World War II, the usual winter timetable of seven or eight trains each way a day on all three main routes between 07:00 and 20:00 ran throughout. However, as the number of servicemen on the island increased, additional late trains were run on Fridays and Saturdays: the last arrivals in Port Erin, Peel, and Ramsey were often around midnight. Military requirements led to a large number of special trains being run, some of them in the small hours of the morning, which led to some minor mishaps. Foxdale passenger services ceased in 1940, but the branch was heavily used for spoil trains during the construction of Jurby and Ronaldsway aerodromes.

===1945–1959===
Traffic levels remained very high in the late 1940s due to petrol rationing, but the 1948 Howden Report foresaw the eventual closure of both the Ramsey and Peel lines, with goods services transferred to road transport. The brief post-war resurgence of the Manx tourist industry kept the trains well filled into the mid-1950s, and postponed the day when significant economies and modernisation would be required. From 1955 onwards usage declined sharply; a million passengers were carried for the last time in 1957. By then the high season schedule had been reduced to seven round trips to Port Erin, and five each on the Peel and Ramsey lines. However individual trains, such as the boat trains, and the 10:35 to Port Erin could load very heavily: 9 carriages and almost 500 passengers on a single train was common in high season.

===1960–1965===
The last re-boilering before the 1965 closure took place in 1959; by then the active fleet had been reduced to 11 locomotives from the 16 of 1939 by the withdrawal of Nos. 7, 2, 9, 4, and 3. Loco Nos. 1, 6, 13, 14 and 16 were known to have limited lives left on their existing boilers, so the future looked grim. Although the railway was still intensively used in summer, winter train services had been reduced to morning and afternoon round trips to Port Erin and Peel, and a solitary working to Ramsey. These trains operated mainly for parcels traffic, and were run at a considerable loss. Winter trains usually consisted of a locomotive and one or two carriages. The St John&#x27;s – Peel section closed for the winter of 1960, reopening the following Easter, whilst in 1961–65 the St John&#x27;s to Ramsey service was withdrawn for the winter months, after the long-established Kirk Michael to Ramsey school trains were replaced by buses. From 1962 the ex-County Donegal railcars handled most of the winter service; they were used between Douglas and Peel in the summer. The last two summer timetables reflect the tourism of the mid-1960s. These show six round trips on the Port Erin line, three to five on the Peel line, and two to Ramsey. Except for the Port Erin-Douglas boat train July and August, all trains operated between 09:30 and 17:30: quite a contrast with the 15 or 16 hours-a-day operation of the 1920s and 1930s. Almost the whole of the Peel line service was handled by the ex-Donegal Railcars, allowing the remaining steam locomotives to be divided between the South Line and the service to Ramsey.

===1967–1968===
In June 1967 Ailsa issued an ambitious summer timetable that pushed a reduced locomotive fleet to its limit, leaving no contingency in the event of failure, as by now only five Beyer Peacock steam locomotives and the railcars were available for service. The timetable was modified by mid-August to four round trips to Castletown (unchanged), three to Peel (down from 7) and two to Ramsey. This pattern carried over to the 1968 season, except that the Ramsey service was reduced to one train thrice-weekly by the end of the season.

===Closure of the Peel and Ramsey lines===
Since the closure of the Peel and Ramsey lines, the basic service has generally been four trains a day between Douglas and Port Erin and return, at roughly two-hour intervals between 10:00 and 16:00. In most seasons an extra train has operated from Douglas around 10:45 during July and August, returning from Port Erin at about 15.30. A brief 1990s experiment of six trains each way in high season was abandoned on grounds of cost. In the 2012, 2013, and 2014 seasons, a six train service has again been run in high season. The service in 2012 followed the conventional pattern of a third locomotive and third set of carriages providing additional departures at 10:50 and 14:50 from Douglas, and 12:50 and 16:50 from Port Erin; but in 2013, a third locomotive was used to shorten turn around times at Douglas, and trains departed at 90-minute intervals through the day. This allowed the use of only two rakes of carriages for the scheduled service, allowing the saloons to be reserved for excursion and charter trains.

In the period 1945–1965 most trains consisted of two and three-carriage sets hauled by a single locomotive. Each three-car set consisted of a brake third or brake-composite, a first-third composite, and a luggage-brake-third, with two car sets omitting the either the brake-composite, or the luggage-brake-third. Three car sets had seats for 120 third class, 12 first class; two car sets carried up to 60 third and 12 first class passengers. Additional carriages – usually older stock such as &quot;the Pairs&quot; and &quot;small Fs&quot; – were added when loadings increased in mid-summer. The official maximum loading for a single locomotive was seven carriages until 1977, when it was reduced to six (SRN Spring 1978). However, during locomotive shortages a single Medium Boiler locomotive sometimes handled eight or nine carriages on Port Erin trains, banked as far as Keristal by the Douglas station pilot. Peel and Ramsey trains were usually combined between Douglas and St John&#x27;s. These trains were often double-headed, usually to balance locomotive workings rather than on account of loading.

Apart from the Ramsey Cattle Mart specials and the transport of materials for projects such as the completion of an airfield in the north of the island, freight trains rarely operated. Most freight was conveyed by attaching freight wagons, loose coupled, to the rear of passenger trains. This practice was contrary to UK regulations, but legal in the Isle of Man. The consequent shunting often delayed passenger trains at intermediate stations, but was cost effective for the railway. A miscommunication while detaching a van from a Douglas train at Union Mills was a contributory factor to the 22 August 1925 accident at Douglas.

Freight traffic ceased in the 1960s, as road transport was much more effective over the island&#x27;s short distances. Ailsa&#x27;s manager, Sir Philip Wombwell, did try to bring container traffic to the railway in 1967/8 and stripped 12 carriages from the F50-75 series of the bodies to act as container flats. The experiment proved unsuccessful as clearance issues prevented containers being carried north of Douglas, and the double transshipment of containers at Castletown – from ship to lorry and from lorry to train – made the traffic uneconomic. Some of the underframes from this project eventually found their way to the Ffestiniog Railway, where they were placed on two foot gauge bogies and used as the basis for some of the &quot;Barn&quot; carriages running on the FR. Far more successful was a contract to haul oil between Peel and Milntown (near Ramsey) for the Electricity Board. Three &#x27;M&#x27; series wagons were fitted with tanks, and the oil was worked as tail traffic until passenger trains ceased in September. The service continued through the winter of 1968/9, but was abandoned in May 1969 following the decision to close the Peel and Ramsey lines.

==Timetabling==




===1873–1966===

The railway operated a modest local train service throughout the year, which was considerably augmented during the summer months to accommodate tourist traffic. Traffic was driven by three requirements: the need to connect with the ferries to and from Britain and Ireland, on-island transportation for tourists, and local passenger traffic. It was common for three or four timetables to be produced each year reflecting seasonal trends, and these would be published in the local newspapers. Winter traffic declined sharply after the 1920s, but it was not until 1960 that the railway was effectively &quot;closed&quot; for spells during the winter, with services only operating on certain days mainly for parcels traffic. This continued until November 1965 when the railway was closed &quot;for essential maintenance to take place&quot;. No trains ran in 1966 but the following year it reopened on a seasonal basis as a tourist attraction as detailed above.

===1967–1968 Lord Ailsa===

The entire network was leased by Archibald Kennedy, 7th Marquess of Ailsa and the lines reopened on 3 June 1967 operating an intensive service, especially on the Peel Line, until September; the following year saw a reduced timetable of operation but proved to be the final year of the lines serving Peel and Ramsey. This has become known as the &quot;Ailsa Period&quot; known for the change of livery to spring green carried by the locomotives. The timetables utilised the Peel and Port Erin lines heavily whilst there was no service to Ramsey on certain days, and then only a limited service ran.

===1969–1972 Port Erin Line only===
From 1969 only the southern route to Port Erin was operated. Services generally operated from May to September thereafter still under the auspices of Lord Ailsa; the former lines remained in situ but disused, save for occasional stock movements to the carriage shed at St John&#x27;s for the winter storage of rolling stock. A limited oil tanker service operated only in 1969. At this time the now traditional pattern of four trains each way per day was adopted and it is this pattern of operation that broadly speaking remains in place today.

===1973–1974 Centenaries===

Lord Ailsa took his five-year option on a 21-year lease and relinquished duties to operate trains from the close of the 1972 season and the Railway Company again took over services with subsidy from the Isle of Man Tourist Board. The centenaries of the Peel and Port Erin lines were commemorated with special trains on the anniversary days in these two years. Services continued to operate on the four each way per day pattern with additional services at peak times in the summer months to coincide with island events.

===1975–1977 Curtailments===

In a cost-cutting measure, trains only operated between Port Erin and Castletown in 1975, and Port Erin and Ballasalla in 1976. The line to Douglas was still maintained as locomotives and rolling stock returned there to receive maintenance. There was much political controversy over the short-line workings and services were ultimately restored in 1977 although rails were lifted on the closed sections during this time. 1977 proved to be the final year of Railway Company operation of the line, again on a familiar seasonal basis with four trains each way per day between May and September.

===1978–1986 Nationalisation===

Various timetables were experimented with in the early period of nationalisation; Notable in this period were the Friday only &quot;Winter Shoppers&quot; trains which ran during the 1981–1982 and 1983-1983 winter periods, with only one train from Port Erin and return each day. Generally trains operated for Easter Week and the full season began at the end of May to coincide with the annual T.T. race period and ran until the last weekend of September. Aside from the popular &quot;Santa Trains&quot;, which have operated since 1985 the line remained closed in the winter months. Also of note are the shuttle services which operated between Douglas and the country park at Lough Ned (mid-way to Port Soderick), these ran in peak season and often utilised the railcars; a platform was provided for this service which saw the last regular use of the railcars in passenger service.

===1987–1999 Anniversaries===

Trains operated for Easter Week with the main season running from mid-May each year; from 1987 trains ran seven days a week in this period (previously there had been no Saturday service for several years) and many additional and extra timetables ran for the &quot;Year of Railways&quot; in 1993, the &quot;International Railway Festival&quot; in 1995 and &quot;Steam 125&quot; event in 1998. Certain years also saw skeleton services operating in October and November in conjunction with various off-season attractions on the island, although the pattern of passing trains at Ballasalla was adhered to. A familiar pattern during this period was the operation of an additional train on Mondays-Thursdays in July and August which left Douglas mid morning (10:50) and returned from Port Erin at 17:30, utilising the long-closed station at Port Soderick to pass the regular service trains. It was common for a shuttle service to link Port Erin and Castletown during the closure of the Billown Circuit for racing during this time.

===2000–2009 New millennium===
The season was extended so that a daily service also operated during October half term with a three-week closure from the end of September. During this time certain seasons saw trains passing at Castletown rather than the more traditional Ballasalla. There was major disruption to services from 2000 when a sewer pipe was laid beneath the railway seeing short line workings from Douglas to Santon, and various shuttles between Port Erin, Port St Mary and Castletown over three seasons before the full line was reinstated. A courtesy coach for passenger bridging the gap of the closed sections was laid on during this period. The extra peak season train was dropped during this period and only four departures from either termini was the standard operational procedure. From 2007 a commuter service operated during the T.T. period, in the first two years this also ran for Manx Grand Prix week.

==Use in film==
The BBC adaptation of &quot;The Ginger Tree&quot; in which it doubled for communist Russia using the carriage shed at Douglas, lineside scenes and (No.11 &quot;Maitland&quot; was painted matte black for this production and remained in this guise for the remainder of the 1989 season) as well as being the subject of a 1988 BBC documentary as part of the &quot;Train Now Departing...&quot; series in an episode called &quot;Steam in the Isle of Man&quot;. Other television credits include an adaptation of &quot;The Legend of the Tamworth Two&quot;, the television movie &quot;Stiff Upper Lips&quot; and the long-running travelogue show &quot;Wish You Were Here...?&quot; which featured Sir Norman Wisdom. In more recent times &quot;Great Coastal Railway Journeys&quot; has showcased the railway as well as &quot;Oz and James&#x27;s Big Wine Adventure&quot;

==Incidents==

* 28 October 1916: The steam locomotive No.5 &quot;Mona&quot; was derailed in the Nunnery cutting after running into a heap of sand placed on each rail by teenage boys. Only the engine driver was injured; the passenger carriages remained on the track.
* 22 August 1925: A train hauled by No.3 &quot;Pender&quot; ran into Douglas station with insufficient braking power. Due to a misunderstanding, the guard and brakesman had been left behind at Union Mills, so there was no-one on board the forward and rear brake vans to apply the train handbrakes. The fireman of the train was killed, but the driver, William Costain, escaped unhurt. Vacuum brakes were introduced as a result of the accident.
* 28 November 1928: J.I.C. Boyd mentions a serious head-on collision between a light engine (No.7 &quot;Tynwald&quot;) and a passenger train on Port Soderick bank, which resulted in the frames of No.10 &quot;G.H. Wood&quot; being bent. They were bent again in a minor collision at Union Mills in 1968.
* 14 August 2005: A train hauled by No.13 &quot;Kissack&quot; was derailed on the facing points of the loop when entering Castletown, resulting in the locomotive and carriage F.54 becoming derailed. There were no serious injuries and services were replaced by buses for the remainder of the day while the locomotive was re-railed.
* 19 May 2008: A train hauled by No.4&quot; Loch&quot; to Port Erin was involved in a collision with a van at Port Soderick station. There were no reported injuries to the driver of the van or to the 74 passengers and crew on board the train.
* 7 May 2012: A train again hauled by No.4 &quot;Loch&quot; was involved in a minor collision with a train hauled by No. 13 &quot;Kissack&quot;, which was awaiting departure from the bay platform at Port Erin, due to the points being incorrectly set.
* 31 December 2022: A New Year dining train hauled by No.11 &quot;Maitland&quot; struck a tree near Ballabeg Station, causing some damage to the rolling stock, reported in the local media; so later services were cancelled.

<text>The Catechetical School of Antioch was one of the two major Christian centers of the study of biblical exegesis and theology during Late Antiquity; the other was the School of Alexandria. This group was known by this name because the advocates of this tradition were based in the city of Antioch in Turkey, one of the major cities of the ancient Roman Empire. Although there were early interpreters from Antioch, like Theophilus of Antioch, the proper school of exegesis at Antioch belongs to the period of the late fourth and the fifth centuries. 

While the Christian intellectuals of Alexandria emphasized the allegorical interpretation of Scriptures and tended toward a Christology that emphasized the union of the human and the divine, those in Antioch held to a more literal and occasionally typological exegesis and a Christology that emphasized the distinction between the human and the divine in the person of Jesus Christ. They rejected notions of instantaneous creation held by other figures such as Augustine, and instead literally held to the notion of the progressive creation of the Genesis creation narrative: those things created on the sixth day did not exist in the fifth, that made on the fifth day did not exist in the fourth, and so on. Advocates included Acacius of Caesarea, Severian of Gabala, Theodore of Mopsuestia, Theodoret, and others.

Nestorius, before becoming Patriarch of Constantinople, had also been a monk at Antioch and had there become imbued with the principles of the Antiochene theological school.

==Periods==

The school of Antioch is best divided into three periods: 

=== The early school (170–early fourth century) ===
The earliest author known of this period is Theophilus of Antioch. Then there is a gap of a century and in the first half of the fourth century there are three known antiochene authors: the best known is Eusebius of Emesa; other representatives are Acacius of Caesarea and Theodore bishop of Heraklea.

=== The middle school (350–433) ===
This period includes at least three different generations: Diodorus of Tarsus, who directed an ἀσκητήριον (school) he may have founded. Among his disciples, the best known are John Chrysostom and Theodore of Mopsuestia. The main figure of the third generation was Nestorius.

===The late school (after 433)===
After the Council of Ephesus (431), the School of Antioch lost some of its prestige. However, after the Council of Chalcedon (451), the Antiochian school became the sole theological school within Eastern and Western Christianity, where the Oriental Orthodox adopted the Alexandrian School of Theology. Apparently only two later authors are known: Basil of Seleucia and Gennadius of Constantinople.

<text>Diodore of Tarsus (Greek Διόδωρος ὁ Ταρσεύς; died c. 390) was a Christian bishop, monastic reformer, and theologian. A strong supporter of the orthodoxy of Nicaea, Diodore played a pivotal role in the Council of Constantinople and opposed the anti-Christian policies of Julian the Apostate. Diodore founded one of the most influential centers of Christian thought in the early church, and many of his students became notable theologians in their own right.

==Early life==

Diodore was born into a noble family in the area of Antioch. He received a classic philosophical education at the school of Athens, and very quickly after his education he entered into the monastic life. During this period, Diodore&#x27;s work focused on philosophical treatises and opposing Emperor Julian&#x27;s attempts to restore paganism in the empire. When an Arian named Leontius was made bishop of Antioch, Diodore and his friend Flavian (who later was appointed as bishop of Antioch) organized those who followed the Nicene orthodoxy outside the walls of the city for worship. Those services are seen as the beginning of antiphonal singing in the church, a practice that became widespread among Christians.

During his time at the monastery in Antioch, Diodore came under the tutelage of Meletius of Antioch. Meletius was elected bishop in 360 and ordained Diodore as a priest. When the Antioch split into factions, Diodore was a strong supporter of Meletius and of his move towards Nicene orthodoxy. Diodore was noted for living with few possessions, being dependent on alms for food, frequently being imprisoned on account of his beliefs. His physical appearance was rough, but John Chrysostom describes his expression as angelic.

==Priesthood==

During his priesthood, Diodore founded a monastery and catechetical school near the city of Antioch. It was through this school that Diodore became the mentor of the controversial theologian and liturgist Theodore of Mopsuestia as well as Chrysostom. This school would give rise to the unique Antiochene perspectives on both biblical interpretation and Christology known as the Antiochene School. Ultimately, taken to the extreme, the perspective set out for this school by Diodore led to the teachings of Nestorius, which were first condemned at the First Council of Ephesus in 431.

It was Diodore&#x27;s role as the head of the Antiochene School which led to his exile in 372. Banished to Armenia by Emperor Valens, Diodore encountered a fellow supporter of the Nicene faction, Basil of Caesarea, during his exile. When Diodore returned from exile following the death of Valens in 378, Basil was serving as the archbishop (or patriarch) of Caesarea, and he appointed Diodore as the bishop of Tarsus.

==Episcopate==

As bishop of the see of Tarsus, Diodore continued to speak out for the Nicene understanding of the relationship between the human and the divine in the person of Jesus Christ. He actively opposed both the Arianism and the Apollinarianism of his day (Arius taught that Jesus Christ was a creation of god, rather than a child and subordinate to him; Apollinaris of Laodicea spoke of the Incarnation in ways that left him open to the charge that Christ was not in all aspects human by saying that his mind was divine and non-rational).

Diodore played key roles in both the local Council of Antioch (379) and the ecumenical First Council of Constantinople in 381. When their mentor Meletius died in 381, Diodore recommended his friend Flavian as his successor, thus prolonging the division in the Antiochene church. Diodore died around 394.

==Theology==

The Christology of Diodore was condemned as heretical by later generations, most explicitly at a local synod in Constantinople in 499 which described Diodore&#x27;s views as Nestorian. Certainly, a similarly negative view of Diodore was held by Cyril of Alexandria. However, in his own generation Diodore was seen as someone who supported the orthodoxy of Nicaea, and in his official decree ratifying the actions of the First Council of Constantinople, Emperor Theodosius I describes Diodore as a &quot;champion of the faith.&quot;

The specifics of Diodore&#x27;s theology are difficult to reconstruct, as all that remains of his works are fragments of uncertain provenance.
 Much of Diodore&#x27;s theology has been inferred from the later statements of his students and the intellectual heirs of the Antiochene School.

According to universalist clergyman John Mather Austin (1855) Diodorus was also a universalist since Saloman, Bishop of Bassorah in his Book of the Bee (1222) proclaimed the salvation of all men and cited the opinions of both Diodorus and Theodore of Mopsuestia in support of his view. According to Universalist writer J. W. Hanson (1899) Diodorus believed that God&#x27;s mercy would punish the wicked less than their sins deserved, inasmuch as his mercy gave the good more than they deserved and he denied that God would bestow immortality for the purpose of prolonging or perpetuating suffering.

<doc id="924507" wikidata="Q507058" url="?curid=924507" title="Billy Walker (footballer, born 1897)">
<text>William Henry Walker (29 October 1897 – 28 November 1964) was a prominent English footballer of the 1920s and 1930s. He is considered by many to be one of the greatest footballers to ever play for Aston Villa and England. As a manager he won the FA Cup with each of Sheffield Wednesday and Nottingham Forest, some 24 years apart, a record which still stands.

==Early life==
Billy Walker was born in Wednesbury, Staffordshire. His father George Walker had played professional football for Wolves and Crystal Palace. His teenage years saw him play for a number of football clubs at junior level, starting at Hednesford Town in 1912. He went onto play for Fallings Heath, Darlaston, Wednesbury Old Park and Wednesbury Old Athletic. In 1915 he was signed by Aston Villa on a part-time contract, signing professional forms after the first world war in May 1919.

==Playing career==
Walker made his senior debut in January 1920 in the FA Cup, scoring twice as Aston Villa won 2–1 in the first round against non-league side Queens Park Rangers. He played in five more FA Cup games, scoring another three, helping Aston Villa reach the FA Cup Final, against second division Huddersfield Town. An extra time winner at Stamford Bridge by Billy Kirton saw Walker become an FA Cup winner in his debut season. Walker also scored 8 league goals in 15 matches at the back end of the 1919–20 season, including a hat-trick against Newcastle United, as Villa ended the first season after the first world war in ninth place.

On the opening day of the 1920–21 season he scored four goals as Villa beat Arsenal 5–0. In November 1921, Walker became the first player to score a hat-trick of penalty kicks in a first division match, the second ever after William McAulay for Walsall in 1900, doing so in a 7–1 win against Bradford City. Walker is one of twelve players to score this rare hat-trick in a league game – five more in cup games – only matched later in the top flight by Charlie Mitten (Man Utd, 1950), Ken Barnes (Man City, 1957). and Justin Kluivert (Bournemouth, 2024). Walker would score 26 goals this season which would be his best in the league and also 4 in the FA Cup. He scored over 20 league goals in each of the next two seasons also.

The 1923–24 season saw Villa again reach the FA Cup final, Walker scoring three in six games, but disappointment this time as they lost 2–0 to Newcastle United at Wembley. Walker scored 21 goals in the 1925–26 season, the fourth and final time he would score over twenty league goals. He became Aston Villa&#x27;s captain in 1926, leading the team for five years before handing it over to Alec Talbot in 1931. He scored 10 in 1927–28 but the next season saw him net 19 times in 36 league appearances. The following season he failed to reach double figures, scoring only 8 times.

The 1930–31 season saw Walker come close to leading Aston Villa becoming English champions, finishing second in the league, scoring a record total of goals, but losing out to a tighter Arsenal defence. Villa scored 128 goals, Arsenal scored 127 but Villa conceded 78. Costly away defeats left the Villains seven points adrift of the Gunners. 33 year old Walker contributed with 15 goals that season, adding to the 49 scored by Pongo Waring and Eric Houghton&#x27;s 30. Walker again came close to a league title with Villa, again finishing second to Arsenal, this time by four points in 1932–33. Away form the difference again as Villa managed only twenty points and thirty two goals away from Villa Park, from their twenty one matches. That season would be Walkers last; he had scored 5 goals in 30 league games. He played in five matches the next season before deciding to retire in September 1933 and by December that year had become manager of Sheffield Wednesday.

A one-club man, Walker made 531 appearances for Villa, scoring 244 goals between 1920 and 1934. He scored 214 goals in 478 matches in the league, that ranks him 17th in the all time top flight league scorers in England. He finished his league career only a goal behind Harry Hampton (215), however still to this day; he is Aston Villa&#x27;s all-time top goalscorer, beating Hampton&#x27;s 242.

Walker was capped 18 times by England, scoring nine goals. He scored on his debut as England beat Ireland 2–0 at Roker Park, Sunderland in October 1920. He has the distinction of scoring England&#x27;s first ever goal at Wembley, although he wasn&#x27;t the first Englishman to score that day. Scotland were the first visitors for an international match at Wembley on 12 April 1924, and led at half time through an Eddie Taylor own goal. The ball hitting the keeper after rebounding off the post following a Billy Cowan shot. Walker equalised on the hour mark for a 1–1 draw. Five of his goals came in the British Home Championship, with two braces in friendly matches making up his tally. In the friendly against Belgium in December 1924 at The Hawthorns, Walker missed a penalty after fifteen minutes, but scored twice in the second half. His final cap came nearly six years after earning his 17th, when he was made captain for a friendly in December 1932, against Austria which England won 4–3. He became the second Aston Villa player to captain England, after Howard Spencer.

Billy Walker was Villa&#x27;s talisman throughout the 1920s and into the 1930s, netting double figures in 12 consecutive seasons from 1919–20. Full-back Tommy Smart is said to have once been asked: &quot;What&#x27;s the team for the match, Tommy?&quot;. &quot;Oh, Billy Walker and ten others!&quot; was the reply.

In March 2003, nearly 40 years after his death, he was named by BBC Sport as the former player Aston Villa needed in their modern-day team – who were struggling for goals that season and narrowly avoided relegation from the FA Premier League.

==Managerial career==
===Sheffield Wednesday===
Walker became manager of Sheffield Wednesday in December 1933, and he successfully steered them away from relegation. In 1935 he led them to an FA Cup victory, but Wednesday were relegated two years later and Walker resigned in November 1937.

===Chelmsford City===
On 24 January 1938, Walker was appointed secretary-manager of newly formed club Chelmsford City. Walker&#x27;s first signings as Chelmsford manager included former England international Eric Keen, Ireland international Jackie Coulter and Jack Palethorpe, whom he had managed at Sheffield Wednesday. On 20 October 1938, Walker resigned from Chelmsford due to conflict with Chelmsford&#x27;s directors over transfers. Walker had intended to sign a player from Plymouth Argyle for free, before discovering a £500 fee was demanded, believing &quot;that money was going to take a lot of finding&quot; from the club.

===Nottingham Forest===
Walker managed Nottingham Forest from 1939 to 1960, bringing promotion to the First Division in 1956–57 and an FA Cup final triumph two years later, beating former team Aston Villa in the semi-finals and becoming the only manager to win the trophy both before and after the Second World War. He retired in 1960.

==Death==
Walker died on 28 November 1964 in Saxondale Hospital, Radcliffe-on-Trent, near Nottingham, after a long illness. Another former Sheffield Wednesday manager, Jimmy McMullan, died on the same day.

<doc id="924512" wikidata="Q3918697" url="?curid=924512" title="Denby Pottery Company">
<text>Denby Pottery Company Ltd is a British manufacturer of pottery, named after the village of Denby in Derbyshire where it is based. It primarily sells hand-crafted stoneware tableware, kitchenware and serveware products including dinner sets, mugs and serving dishes, as well as a variety of glassware products and cast-iron cookware.

==History==

The pottery at Denby was founded on the estate of William Drury-Lowe in 1809 as a manufacturer of stoneware bottles. It was run by Joseph Jager in partnership with Robert Charles George Brohier; the partnership was dissolved in 1814. By this time, clay from a deposit on the land was already in use at the Belper Pottery. At the beginning of 1815 William Bourne of the Belper Pottery and his sons William, John and Joseph took a 21-year lease on Brohier and Jager&#x27;s factory. Joseph Bourne ran the works at Denby and Belper in tandem until 1834, when he closed down the Belper pottery and moved its equipment and workforce to Denby. Bourne later took over the Codnor Park and Shipley Potteries, and merged them into the Denby works in a similar manner. Joseph Bourne took his son Joseph Harvey Bourne into partnership, and the company became known as Joseph Bourne and Son, a name it kept even after the death of Joseph Bourne in 1860.

Using a new patent process for drying slip invented by Needham and Kite of Vauxhall, the pottery produced at least 25 tons of workable clay each day. In the nineteenth century most of the ware produced was salt-glazed stoneware. Bourne patented improved kilns for stoneware in 1823 and 1848. By the 1870s the pottery was producing a wide range of utilitarian stoneware products including telegraph insulators, ink bottles, pickle and marmalade jars, spirit and liquor bottles, foot warmers, churns, mortars and pestles, pipkins, feeding-bottles, pork pie moulds, druggists&#x27; shop-jars, snuff-jars, spirit-barrels, pudding-moulds, and water filters. They also made more decorative &quot;hunting jugs&quot; sprigged with moulded decorations of huntsmen, windmills, men smoking or beehives, sometimes with the handle in the form of a greyhound, and terracotta goods, both practical and decorative.

The company benefited greatly from its transport links into Derby and beyond, particularly when the Midland Railway opened its Ripley Branch. It had a siding at Denby Wharf (the terminus of the Little Eaton Gangway) approximately opposite to the factory. Each week around three or four vans would be dispatched to Chaddesden sidings (near Derby station) where they would be connected to an express to St Pancras in London and the company&#x27;s warehouse at the Granary.
The company, whose name is now principally associated with stoneware, initially produced bottles and jars, before specialising in kitchenware and, eventually, in tableware, for which it is best known today. In order to increase capacity the nearby Langley Mill Pottery was acquired in October 1959. During the 1950s and 1960s a number of designers worked for Denby, including Gill Pemberton who designed the renowned and admired Denby Chevron, and Arabesque amongst others.

In 1987 the company was taken over by the Coloroll Group. After Coloroll went into receivership in 1990, Denby was subject to a management buyout, and was floated in 1994.

In the early twenty-first century Denby expanded its use of materials to include glass (wine glasses, tumblers and bowls) and metal (cutlery and cooking utensils). It also introduced fine dining ranges in porcelain and bone china.

The company was subject to a £30 million management buyout in 2009, after suffering a decline in sales. The company had £72 million of debt written off at the time of the buyout.

In 2010 Denby acquired Burleigh Pottery in Stoke-on-Trent. Shortly afterwards in 2012, the Denby Group acquired Poole Pottery.

In February 2014, the company was put up for sale by its owner Hilco Capital following expressions of interest from other companies. Hilco cancelled the sale in January 2015 due to improvements in the company&#x27;s growth. As of 2021, one of the Board members of Denby Holdings Ltd was from Valco Capital Partners LP.

In 2019, Denby launched the Conscious Choice campaign which focused on the versatile, sustainable and functional nature of Denby&#x27;s stoneware products and aimed to inspire customers to try and live more sustainably by reusing their pottery around the home.

In a departure from its tradition of stoneware production, in 2021 Denby launched a Porcelain collection. The venture into a new material saw Denby repurpose part of its existing factory, with additional staff taken on to produce the new lines. 4 ranges - Classic White, Arc (textured) White, Arc Blue and Modern Deco (a patterned range) make up the Porcelain collection, and use the same ceramics and glaze techniques practised for over 200 years at Denby.

In 2021 the television programme &quot;Inside the Factory&quot; visited the Denby factory to follow the journey of a Halo Heritage mug, broadcast on 2 February 2022.

<text>Erraid () is a tidal island approximately square located in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland. It lies west of Mull (to which it is linked by a beach at low tide) and southeast of Iona. The island receives about of rain and 1,350 hours of sunshine annually, making it one of the driest and sunniest places on the western seaboard of Scotland. It is attended by numerous uninhabited small islets, the largest being Eilean Dubh (of which there are two), Eilean nam Muc, Eilean Chalmain, Eilean Ghomain and Eilean na Seamair.

The island features a disused signal station for the lighthouses on Dubh Artach and Skerryvore and a row of cottages built for the lighthouse keepers.

Satish Kumar has also visited the island and his autobiography includes an account of the event.

The island is privately owned and is home to an intentional community, part of the Findhorn Foundation.

There is a well-known anchorage on the western side of the island called &#x27;Tinker&#x27;s Hole&#x27;. It is a deep but narrow channel between Erraid and the westernmost of the islets called Eilean Dubh.

In 2021, Ben Fogle&#x27;s long-running hit Channel 5 series &#x27;New Lives in the Wild&#x27; visited the island to record an episode with one of the permanent community members living there (Philip Hetherington). The episode aired on 21 September 2021.

== &quot;Kidnapped&quot; ==


Erraid is one of the locations featured in the novel &quot;Kidnapped&quot; by Robert Louis Stevenson. David Balfour, the hero of this tale was marooned for a while on the island having been shipwrecked on the Torran Rocks, which lie to the south. Stevenson&#x27;s father, Thomas was involved in the construction of the nearby lighthouses, and the stones for Dhu Heartach were quarried on the island, and the young Robert Louis visited the island on several occasions, recalling one such excursion in his book &quot;Memories and Portraits&quot;. He later based the fictional island of Aros, the setting of his short story &quot;The Merry Men&quot;, on the island.

Davie Balfour is trapped on the island by his ignorance, and as he says in &quot;Kidnapped: Chapter XIV&quot;-

A sea-bred boy would not have stayed a day on Earraid; which is only what they call a tidal islet, and except in the bottom of the neaps, can be entered and left twice in every twenty-four hours, either dry-shod, or at the most by wading. Even I, who had the tide going out and in before me in the bay, and even watched for the ebbs, the better to get my shellfish—even I (I say) if I had sat down to think, instead of raging at my fate, must have soon guessed the secret, and got free. It was no wonder the fishers had not understood me. The wonder was rather that they had ever guessed my pitiful illusion, and taken the trouble to come back. I had starved with cold and hunger on that island for close upon one hundred hours. But for the fishers, I might have left my bones there, in pure folly. And even as it was, I had paid for it pretty dear, not only in past sufferings, but in my present case; being clothed like a beggar-man, scarce able to walk, and in great pain of my sore throat.
Stevenson also includes a description of the island:

It was still the roughest kind of walking; indeed the whole, not only of Earraid, but of the neighbouring part of Mull (which they call the Ross) is nothing but a jumble of granite rocks with heather in among.
Davie Balfour stayed alive during his stay on the island by eating limpets:

I knew indeed that shell-fish were counted good to eat; and among the rocks of the isle I found a great plenty of limpets, which at first I could scarcely strike from their places, not knowing quickness to be needful. There were, besides, some of the little shells that we call buckies; I think periwinkle is the English name. Of these two I made my whole diet, devouring them cold and raw as I found them; and so hungry was I, that at first they seemed to me delicious.

<doc id="924516" wikidata="Q7337612" url="?curid=924516" title="River Lynher">
<text>The River Lynher () (or St Germans River downstream from its confluence with the Tiddy) flows through east Cornwall, England, and enters the River Tamar at the Hamoaze, which in turn flows into Plymouth Sound.

==Navigation==

The normal tidal limit is a weir upstream of Notter Bridge. St Germans is a historic fishing village situated on the River Tiddy just upstream of its confluence with the Lynher. The Quay Sailing Club are based at St Germans Quay. The Queen&#x27;s Harbour Master for Plymouth is responsible for managing navigation on the tidal Lynher and its tributaries (up to the normal tidal limits).

==Geography==
The river is about 21 miles (34 km long), rising at a height of about 920 feet (280m) on Bodmin Moor and flowing into the Tamar Estuary near Plymouth. It has four main tributaries, the largest of which is the River Tiddy. The smaller tributaries include Deans Brook, Withey Brook, Marke Valley and Darleyford streams and Kelly Brook.

==Ecology==
The Lynher and its tributaries are largely used for rod and line fishing, particularly for brown trout and Atlantic salmon.

Its estuary is a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest and also a Special Protection Area. Many species of animals can be found here, including the kingfisher, otter, white-throated dipper, avocet, and black-tailed godwit; the triangular club-rush (scirpus) also grows on the banks. The estuary, along with the Tamar–Tavy Estuary system and St John&#x27;s Lake, form the &quot;Tamar Estuaries Complex&quot; Special Protection Area (SPA), as well as forming part of the &quot;Plymouth Sound and Estuaries&quot; Special Area of Conservation (SAC).

Park Wood, in the Lyhner valley south-west of Callington off the A390 road, is also designated an SSSI for its biological interest.

<text>In Sweden, a folkpark (approximately &quot;people&#x27;s park&quot; in English) is a public recreation space, usually featuring large grassed areas, trees, children&#x27;s play facilities, etc. Most towns and cities have a folkpark. These parks were originally created by the labour movement as places where political rallies could be held and where workers and their families could unwind. In larger folkparks, there is sometimes a bandstand or stage, and they are used for concerts and other entertainment. Summer folkpark tours are a traditional part of the touring circuit for bands, etc.

<text>John Q. Public (and several similar names; see the Variations section below) is a generic name and placeholder name, especially in American English, to denote a hypothetical member of society, deemed a &quot;common man&quot;, who is presumed to represent the randomly selected &quot;man on the street&quot;.

The equivalent term in British English is Joe Public.

==Variations==

There are various similar terms for the average Joe, including John Q. Citizen and John Q. Taxpayer, or Jane Q. Public, Jane Q. Citizen, and Jane Q. Taxpayer for a woman. The name John Doe is used in a similar manner. The term Tom, Dick, and Harry is often used to denote multiple hypothetical persons. An equivalent term is Joe Public which is used in the United Kingdom.

Roughly equivalent are the names Joe Blow, Joe Six-pack, and the nowadays rather less popular Joe Doakes and Joe Shmoe, the last of which implies a lower-class citizen (from the Yiddish שמאָ &quot;schmo&quot;: simpleton, or possibly Hebrew שמו &quot;sh&#x27;mo&quot;: (what&#x27;s)-his-name). On a higher plane, the Talmudic generic place-marker name Plony (which can be translated to Mr. X. or Anonymous) is used as a reference in any case which is applicable to anyone – Sanhedrin 43a provides an example.

==Usage==
In the United States, the term &quot;John Q. Public&quot; is used by law enforcement officers to refer to an individual with no criminal bent, as opposed to terms like &quot;perp&quot; (short for perpetrator) or &quot;skell&quot; to qualify unsavory individuals.

2008 Republican Vice Presidential nominee Sarah Palin infamously referred to &quot;Joe Sixpack and Hockey moms&quot; during a debate. Presidential candidate John McCain referenced a similar symbol, this time represented by an actual person, saying that Senator Obama&#x27;s tax plan would hurt Joe the Plumber&#x27;s bottom line. A fifteen-minute debate on this issue ensued, with both candidates speaking directly to &quot;Joe&quot;.

==History==
John, Quisquam and &quot;The Public&quot; first appears in the formation of the United States in the later 1700s. Many new Americans of Lutheran German heritage also spoke Latin and used the term &quot;quisquam&quot; with a gender neutral meaning of &quot;anyone&quot; where, in English, John was the generic male term for a person.

The term John Q. Public was the name of a character created by Vaughn Shoemaker, an editorial cartoonist for the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;, in 1922. Jim Lange, the editorial cartoonist for &quot;The Oklahoman&quot; for 58 years, was closely identified with a version of the John Q. Public character, whom he sometimes also called &quot;Mr. Voter&quot;. Lange&#x27;s version of the character was described as &quot;bespectacled, mustachioed, fedora-wearing&quot;. In 2006 the Oklahoma State Senate voted to make this character the &quot;state&#x27;s official editorial cartoon.&quot;

==Other English-speaking countries==
The equivalent in the United Kingdom is Joe (or Jane) Public, John Smith, or Fred Bloggs or Joe Bloggs. Also, the man in the street, the man on the Clapham omnibus, and the aforementioned Tom, Dick and Harry. Tommy or Tommy Atkins is used as a generic soldier&#x27;s name.

In Australia and New Zealand, John (or Jane) Citizen is usually seen as a placeholder in credit card advertisements, while Joe (or Jane) Bloggs is also commonly used in speech. Joe Blow is also used, often to suggest a possibly undesirable person. For example: &quot;You left the door open so any Joe Blow could have walked in.&quot; Also used: Fred Nurk, Joe Farnarkle.

In Ireland Joe Soap is used as a generic reference to a male. Also Seán and Síle Citizen; Irish: Seán Ó Rudaí, from rud = thing(s).

In Canada, during the 1960s, a person appeared in editorial cartoons called Uno Who, representing an average, downtrodden citizen. He was always shown wearing a bankruptcy barrel (as did Will Johnstone&#x27;s earlier and similar character, &quot;the Taxpayer&quot;, for the American &quot;New York World Telegram&quot;). Québecers also use Monsieur-Madame-Tout-le-Monde (&quot;Mr-and-Ms-Everybody&quot;) or Monsieur Untel (&quot;Mr-So-and-so&quot;). Jos Bleau (&quot;Joe Blow&quot;, spelled according to the rules of French) and G. Raymond are also used in Canada. Occasionally, names which are invariant when translated between English and French are favoured in advertising material (such as &quot;Nicole Martin&quot; or &quot;Carole Martin&quot; on packets of retail coupons).

<text>The Jubilee River is an artificial flood-relief channel in southern England. It is long and is on average wide. It was constructed in the late 1990s and early 2000s to take overflow from the River Thames and so alleviate flooding to areas in and around the towns of Maidenhead, Windsor, and Eton in the counties of Berkshire and Buckinghamshire. It achieves this by taking water from the left (at this point eastern) bank of the Thames upstream of Boulter&#x27;s Lock near Maidenhead and returning it via the north bank downstream of Eton. Although successful in its stated aims, residents of villages downstream, such as Wraysbury, claim it has increased flooding in those locations.
==Construction==
Parts of the towns of Windsor, Eton and Maidenhead are prone to flooding, because they are built on the flood plain of the River Thames. The concept of a parallel channel which could take water from the Thames above Maidenhead and return it below Windsor was conceived in the 1980s, and became known as the Maidenhead, Windsor and Eton Flood Alleviation Scheme. When the ten regional water authorities were privatised, as a result of the Water Act 1989, responsibility for rivers passed to the National Rivers Authority, which soon afterwards submitted plans for a channel which would be wide and long. In October 1992, a planning enquiry was held to consider the proposals. During that enquiry, P. Ackers, one of the assessors, expressed grave doubts about the hydraulic modelling that had been used to justify the scheme, suggesting that it was too optimistic.

The scheme did not receive government approval until 1995; around the same time, there was further reorganisation of the water industry, with the Environment Agency replacing the National Rivers Authority. Although Ackers&#x27; concerns had not been addressed, it commissioned the design and construction of the scheme as originally conceived, at a cost of £110 million. Throughout the planning process, from initial feasibility studies to delivery of the project, Lewin, Fryer and Partners were the consulting engineers. Principal works were the creation of the channel, various flow control mechanisms and bridges for road, rail and foot traffic.
One of the challenges was the Dorney Bridge, built to take the channel beneath the Great Western Main Line. The 19th-century Brunel-designed railway embankment continued in use, carrying passenger and goods trains between London and destinations including South Wales, Cornwall and Bristol throughout construction. The high embankment was stabilised along 30m of its length by freezing over a period of three months, using 175 brine tubes cooled to . A tunnel was excavated through the frozen ground to just wider than the two long preformed concrete box sections, which were jacked through as the excavation proceeded. This created a wide by high concrete culvert which can be seen from the Bath Road Bridge.
The channel also had to be taken through Black Potts Viaduct, a series of 13 brick arches carrying the Waterloo to Windsor railway line over the Thames flood plain. Protective concrete and blue brick barriers were built around the older brickwork to preserve the viaduct&#x27;s structural integrity, as well as to control gates to adjust the amount of water rejoining the Thames immediately downstream.

The channel involved complex civil engineering to deal with utility conduits, roads and railways, as well as ecological and social issues, entailing compulsory purchases, community lectures and consultations and a public enquiry. For example, at Manor Farm a weir was constructed. Conception to fruition took about 20 years.

Water is admitted to the river through sluice gates at the upstream end of the channel near Taplow. This is normally controlled by measurements of the water levels below Boulters Lock and the estimated flow of the Thames at the Datchet gauging station near Windsor. The first serious test of the new structure occurred during the flooding of early January 2003, and revealed a number of defects in the design. With both the Boulters Lock levels and the Datchet flow indicating that the channel was needed, the Taplow sluices were opened briefly on 1 January, but were then shut again until 4 January, by which time the Boulters Lock levels were above the target levels, and the flow at Datchet was some 320 cubic metres per second, 140 cubic metres per second above the recommended flow. A subsequent investigation revealed that the Environment Agency had known there were defects in the channel since November 2002, and this had been a major factor in not operating it correctly.
When flood water was admitted to the channel, the flows were well short of its designed maximum flow capacity, and yet there was significant erosion of the banks in several places. There was considerable erosion at the Taplow Sluice, due to the lack of a stilling basin; embankments at Marsh Lane were badly damaged; the weir at Manor Farm was bent in the middle; the protection on the downstream face of Slough weir was swept away; and in Datchet, the Myrke embankment nearly collapsed. An independent assessment by the engineering consultancy WS Atkins identified that the actual capacity of the channel was around two-thirds of its design capacity, and factors affecting this were the banks being too low, the use of inappropriate materials, and failure to follow standard design criteria. A programme of repairs and upgrades to rectify the problems began, at a cost of £3.5 million, and took until 2006 to complete. The Environment Agency sued their lead design consultants for recovery of the remedial costs, and were refunded £2.75 million in an out-of-court settlement, after they admitted that the design and construction were sub-standard.

==Name==
The name used during planning was the &quot;Maidenhead, Windsor and Eton Flood Alleviation Scheme&quot; (MWEFAS). The choice of a name for the river was put to the local population in a poll. The result was a strong preference for &#x27;Jubilee&#x27;, as it was being completed in Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Golden Jubilee year of 2002 and one of the Queen&#x27;s main residences was at Windsor Castle, in one of the three towns being protected by the scheme.

==In use==
The watercourse was designed to look like a natural river; its banks have artificially constructed wildlife habitats intended to replace those lost from the banks of the Thames during urban expansion in the 19th and 20th centuries. During construction of reed beds and of wet woodland were laid down and about 250,000 trees were planted.

The river is well used by walkers, runners, swimmers, canoeists, wildlife enthusiasts and cyclists: a footpath combined with National Cycle Route 61 runs along virtually its entire length. A wide variety of bird life can be seen along the river, including green woodpeckers, cormorants, lapwing and red kites.

During flooding in the early months of 2014, some residents of Ham Island (in Old Windsor) and Wraysbury said that the Jubilee River had increased the height of the flooded Thames in those villages which, along with much of the river upstream of London, saw water levels unprecedented since 1947. Wraysbury had also suffered significant flooding in 2003. The Environment Agency in the 2010s is undertaking a widening and dredging programme of Thames works to assist with downstream flows.

<text>Don Chevrier (December 29, 1937December 17, 2007) was a Canadian sports announcer. He worked in television and radio, and was born in Toronto, 
Ontario.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
He began his broadcasting career at CJCA in Edmonton, Alberta at the age of 16 covering high school sports for radio. From 1972 to 1981, he was co-host of &quot;Curling Classic&quot;, a television program on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) that was earlier hosted by Alex Trebek. 

In 1972, Chevrier was the ringside commentator for the World Heavyweight Championship between Joe Frazier and Ron Stander.

===Toronto Blue Jays, CFL, Ottawa Senators===
In 1977, he became the original television voice of the Toronto Blue Jays Major League Baseball team. He spent the next 20 years as a commentator on the Jays&#x27; television broadcast crew. He called Nolan Ryan&#x27;s seventh no-hitter when the Rangers played against the Blue Jays on May 1, 1991. Throughout the 1970s, he broadcast curling and the Canadian Football League for CBC, calling several Grey Cups as well as Briers. In the early 1980s he moved to CTV, where he remained a fixture in its sports department into the early nineties. In 1991, he called the Canada Cup hockey tournament for the network and from 1992–93 until 1997–98 he was the television voice for the NHL&#x27;s Ottawa Senators for CHRO-TV, working alongside Greg Millen.

<text>Dean Benjamin McLaughlin (born October 25, 1901, Brooklyn, New York City; died December 8, 1965, Ann Arbor, Michigan, US) was an American astronomer. He was a professor of astronomy at the University of Michigan. He was the father of the science fiction author Dean B. McLaughlin, Jr. He received his B.S. (1923), his M.S. (1924) and his Ph.D. (1927) all from Michigan. McLaughlin married fellow astronomer Laura Elizabeth Hill in 1927. 

In 1954, he proposed the theory that there are volcanoes on Mars and that their eruptions change the albedo features called &quot;mare&quot; (The Martian equivalent of Lunar mare). His proposal was partially confirmed in 1971 with the arrival of Mariner 9, which showed that strong winds could move dust around the planet, creating the changes of appearance formerly attributed to some kind of vegetation.

A crater on Mars was named in his honor, as is the crater McLaughlin on the far side of the Moon and the asteroid 2024 McLaughlin. In 2014 NASA scientists announced they had discovered evidence of water in Mars&#x27; McLaughlin Crater.

<doc id="924586" wikidata="Q295521" url="?curid=924586" title="Tayshaun Prince">
<text>Tayshaun Durell Prince (born February 28, 1980) is an American professional basketball executive and former player. The small forward graduated from Dominguez High School before playing college basketball for the University of Kentucky. He was drafted 23rd overall by the Detroit Pistons in the 2002 NBA draft and went on to win a championship with the team in 2004.

==College career==
Prince played four seasons (1998 to 2002) for the Kentucky Wildcats, averaging 13.2 points and 5.7 rebounds as the Wildcats posted a 97–39 record and advanced to the NCAA Tournament each year. Prince won SEC Player of the Year in his junior season (2000–2001)—also leading the SEC in free throw percentage (84.3%)—and was named to the Associated Press All-SEC Teams in both his junior and senior years. Kentucky won the SEC Tournament in 1999 and 2001, and Prince was awarded the 2001 tournament&#x27;s Most Valuable Player award. He was a three-time team MVP with the Wildcats.

Notable individual performances included a 31-point, 11-rebound, four-assist, and four-steal effort in a 79–59 victory over North Carolina. In scoring Kentucky&#x27;s first fifteen points, Prince made five consecutive three-point shots. Kentucky shooting guard Keith Bogans compared Prince&#x27;s performance to &quot;the Chicago Bulls&#x27; Michael Jordan blistering Portland in the 1992 NBA Finals.&quot; In an 87–82 victory over Tulsa during the 2002 NCAA Tournament, Prince scored a career-high 41 points (along with nine rebounds, four assists and three blocks) to lead Kentucky to the Sweet 16. He graduated from Kentucky in 2002 with a degree in sociology.

==Professional career==

===Detroit Pistons (2002–2013)===

==== Rookie season and championship (2002–2004) ====
In his rookie season under head coach Rick Carlisle, Prince was not a member of the team&#x27;s playing rotation and appeared in just 42 of 82 regular-season games. However, in the first round of the 2003 NBA playoffs, Detroit trailed the Orlando Magic three games to one, forcing Carlisle to experiment with a different rotation. Prince was inserted into the lineup and received heavy minutes. He then became the only player in NBA history to score more points in the playoffs than in the regular season (137 in the season, 141 in the playoffs).

The Pistons rallied to win the series, and Prince had a breakout performance during the decisive seventh game, scoring 20 points in 24 minutes. In the second round against the Philadelphia 76ers, Prince continued to see action and made several memorable plays, including a turnaround hook shot during the final seconds of Game 2, forcing an overtime period that the Pistons went on to win.

After the Pistons were swept by the New Jersey Nets in the Eastern Conference Finals, Carlisle was fired and former Sixers coach Larry Brown took over as head coach. Under Brown, Prince became the Pistons&#x27; starting small forward and increased his scoring average to 10.3 points per game, up from 3.3 as a rookie. In that 2003–04 season, Prince was also selected to play for the Sophomores (second-year players) in the NBA Rookie Challenge.

In Game 2 of the 2004 Eastern Conference Finals against the Indiana Pacers, Prince made a memorable defensive play. In the final minute of the game, Prince spectacularly blocked the ball from Pacers star shooting guard Reggie Miller; effectively ending the game. The Pistons went on to win the series and, eventually, the NBA championship. When the Pistons defeated the Los Angeles Lakers four games to one in the NBA Finals, Prince&#x27;s tough defense on Lakers guard Kobe Bryant was credited as a key factor in the Pistons&#x27; victory, holding Bryant to only 11 points in an 88–68 win in Game 3 of the 2004 NBA Finals.

==== All-Defensive Team regular (2004–2008) ====
Prince continued to show improvement in the 2004–05 season, setting career highs in scoring (14.7 points per game), rebounding (5.3 per game), assists (3.0) and blocks (0.9). He was selected for the NBA&#x27;s NBA All-Defensive Second Team and was a candidate for the NBA Most Improved Player Award, where he came in third behind winner Bobby Simmons of the Los Angeles Clippers and Primož Brezec of the Charlotte Bobcats. Although he and the Pistons made it back to the NBA Finals in 2005, they lost to the San Antonio Spurs in seven games. During the Malice at the Palace brawl, Prince was the only player on either team who did not leave the bench during the entire incident.

Prince&#x27;s play was rewarded by the Pistons with a five-year contract extension worth $49 million on October 31, 2005.

In the 2005–06 season, Prince played in all 82 regular season games, averaging 14.1 points and 4.2 rebounds a game. In the playoffs, the Pistons were eliminated by the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals in six games, following the controversial decision by Flip Saunders to bench Ben Wallace in game 6 entire fourth quarter. In Game 5 of that series, he scored a playoff career-high 29 points to go along with 7 rebounds in a 91–78 win.

In the 2006–07 season, Prince returned similar statistics to his 2004–05 campaign: 14.3 points, 5.2 rebounds, and 2.8 assists per game. In the playoffs the Pistons were eliminated in the Eastern Conference Finals by the Cleveland Cavaliers in six games as his point average are 14.1 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 3.8 assists per game as his struggle to defend LeBron James.
In the 2007–08 season, Prince played and started in all 82 regular season games, averaging 13.2 points, 4.9 rebounds, and 3.3 assists per game. In the playoffs, Prince averaged 13.8 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 3.2 assists, but the Pistons were eliminated in the Eastern Conference Finals by the Boston Celtics in game six as Prince&#x27;s poor game play in game 6 along with Rasheed Wallace contributed the downfall of the team&#x27;s demise.

==== Later years in Detroit (2008–2013) ====
Prince started the season off strong while averaging nearly 16 points and seven rebounds a game. As the season started to progress Prince&#x27;s production started to slump and by the end of the season he averaged 14.2 points and 5.8 rebounds. Although his points per game average dropped, he averaged a career high in rebounds per game. Prince&#x27;s effort helped push the Pistons to the playoffs as they gained the 8th seed with 39 wins. Although the Pistons made the playoffs, they were seeded against the top-seed Cleveland Cavaliers. The Cavaliers swept the Pistons in four games, and Prince&#x27;s production from the season dropped drastically, as he averaged only 3.8 points and 3.5 rebounds.

===Memphis Grizzlies (2013–2015)===

On January 30, 2013, Prince and Austin Daye were traded to the Memphis Grizzlies in a three-team trade which sent Rudy Gay and Hamed Haddadi to the Toronto Raptors and José Calderón to the Pistons. The Grizzlies also received Ed Davis. Though Rudy Gay had been the longtime starting small forward in Memphis, Prince appeared to be a better fit with the team, as his style of play complemented the team&#x27;s &quot;Grit-N-Grind&quot; mantra. The Grizzlies finished with their best record in franchise history at 56–26, and their first-ever appearance in the Western Conference Finals.

Despite an injury sustained in pre-season, Prince still managed to start and play 76 games in 2013–14, averaging 6.0 points, 3.1 rebounds and 1.6 assists per game—the second-lowest stat line of his career behind his rookie season. His 29% from the three-point line was also a career low.

===Boston Celtics (2015)===
On January 12, 2015, Prince was traded to the Boston Celtics in a three-team deal involving the Memphis Grizzlies and the New Orleans Pelicans in which the Celtics also received guard Austin Rivers, who was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers 3 days later, and a first round draft pick. The Grizzlies received forward Jeff Green and guard Russ Smith in the trade. The Pelicans received forward Quincy Pondexter and a 2015 second round draft pick (forward Branden Dawson). On January 26, he made his debut for the Celtics, and in 30 minutes of action off the bench, he recorded 19 points and 5 assists to lead the Celtics to a 99–90 win over the Utah Jazz.

===Return to Detroit (2015)===
On February 19, 2015, Prince was traded by the Celtics back to the Pistons in exchange for Luigi Datome and Jonas Jerebko.

===Minnesota Timberwolves (2015–2016)===
On August 20, 2015, Prince signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves. He made his debut for the Timberwolves in the team&#x27;s season opener against the Los Angeles Lakers on October 28, recording 2 points and 2 rebounds in a 112–111 win.

Prince&#x27;s final NBA game was played on April 11, 2016, in a 105 - 129 loss to the Houston Rockets where he recorded 3 assists, 2 rebounds but no points in 13 minutes of playing time.

==National team career==
On August 20, 2007, Prince was selected to be a part of Team USA that competed at the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship, a qualifying tournament for the Beijing Olympics. With his defensive poise, he contributed in the USA&#x27;s unbeaten record at the tournament held in Las Vegas, Nevada and earned a spot at the 2008 Summer Olympics.

On June 23, 2008, Prince was selected for the Olympic squad along with eleven others in the hope of fulfilling the ambition of winning their first gold medal since the 2000 Summer Olympics. Team USA went on to do exactly that, going unbeaten in the tournament with Prince coming off the bench and defeating 2006 World Champion Spain in the final, living up to their &quot;Redeem Team&quot; moniker.

==Executive career==
On August 15, 2017, Prince joined the Memphis Grizzlies as special assistant to general manager. On April 27, 2019, the Grizzlies promoted him to Vice President of Basketball Affairs.

<text>The Agios Kosmas Olympic Sailing Centre hosted the sailing events at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. The center is located about four miles from downtown Athens along the coast. It was officially opened on August 2, 2004, a few weeks before the Olympics, though test events were conducted at the site in August 2002 and 2003. The center had a capacity of 1,600 for the medal ceremonies.

After the Olympics, the site was turned over to the private sector (Seirios AE), and will become a marina with a 1,000+ yacht capacity, as part of Athens&#x27; revitalized waterfront.

<doc id="924589" wikidata="Q2905610" url="?curid=924589" title="River Blackwater, Essex">
<text>The River Blackwater is a river in Essex, England. It rises as the River Pant in the northwest of the county, just east of Saffron Walden, and flows in a generally southeast direction to Bocking, near Braintree, via Great Sampford and Great Bardfield. At Bocking, it becomes the River Blackwater, and veers east to flow past Bradwell Juxta Coggeshall and Coggeshall. It then veers south, flowing past Kelvedon and Witham, before reaching Maldon. There, it veers east again and empties into the Blackwater Estuary, which in turn meets the North Sea at Mersea Island.

The River Blackwater has two major tributaries: the River Brain, which meets it just south of Witham, and the River Chelmer, which meets it just east of Maldon. The lower reaches of the Chelmer, from Chelmsford, were canalised in the 1790s, and the navigation diverts water north of the Blackwater through Maldon before emptying into the Blackwater Estuary at Heybridge Basin.

==History==
One of the most famous Viking battles in Britain, the Battle of Maldon, possibly took place at the mouth of the river in 991. The Battle of Maldon, an early-11th-century fragmentary poem which describes the battle, mentions the &quot;Panta&quot; and describes a tidal causeway which could be the causeway leading to Northey Island. The Saxons were defeated and their leader, Byrhtnoth, was killed.

The Blackwater was a source of fish and oysters for the town of Maldon during the Roman occupation. The remains of Saxon fish traps were discovered in the river in the 1990s. During the winter of 1776 the Blackwater froze from Maldon to Osea island, a distance of some four miles. The ice trapped fishing and cargo carrying vessels and blocked any imports of coal, oil, wool to Maldon.

In 1793 the Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation Company was formed by act of Parliament. Over the next four years, the company built a navigation from Chelmsford to meet the tidal estuary of the River Blackwater in Colliers Reach at the place that is today called Heybridge Basin (after the canal basin there).

The burgers of the borough of Maldon refused to allow the canal to pass through their borough, so the company routed it just outside the borough boundary, which is why it ended up at Colliers Reach, rather than at Maldon. From Chelmsford, the navigation mainly followed the course of the River Chelmer until it reached Beeleigh, near Maldon. Then it followed the course of the River Blackwater to Heybridge, and from there via a canal to the sea lock at Colliers Reach.

A weir connected the navigation to the tidal river Blackwater at Heybridge, where it powered a water mill. Heybridge mill was demolished after severe flooding in this area in 1953, but the mill house still stands. The river (known here as &quot;Heybridge Creek&quot;) was dammed between Heybridge Hall and Potman marsh in 1954 as part of a programme of flood defence improvements. Most of the water flowing down the River Blackwater nowadays flows over a weir at Beeleigh and along the tidal section of the Chelmer before rejoining the Blackwater at Heybridge Basin.

In 1865 HM Government passed the Maldon Harbour Act authorized construction of a wharf on the west side of the southern end of Heybridge Creek on land belonging to the Great Eastern Railway Company, and improving the channels of the rivers Chelmer and Blackwater. Ten thousand pounds were spent on widening, deepening and improving the river from the Fullbridge to just downriver from Herring&#x27;s Point, near Heybridge Basin. After this, vessels had to pay a toll of 3 pence a ton if they were under 50 tons register or 6 pence a ton if they were over that.

A medieval 5-arched stone bridge over the River Blackwater at Heybridge (from which that village got its name) was replaced in 1870 by a 2-arched brick one. That bridge was at the north end of the Causeway, at its junction with Heybridge Street and Holloway Road, but the bridge there now is hardly distinguishable as such.

==Industry==
The Maldon Crystal Salt Company produces crystalline sea salt by traditional panning techniques from the waters of the Blackwater.

==Osea Island==

Osea Island is a privately owned Island that is situated on the Blackwater Estuary, north of Steeple.

==Northey Island==
Northey Island owned by the National Trust, is approximately one mile to the west of Osea Island. It is part of an ancient landscape and is connected to the shore by a tidal causeway. It is believed by some to have been the site of the Battle of Maldon in 991 AD and offers birdwatching opportunities.

<text>Frank Yablans (August 27, 1935 – November 27, 2014) was an American studio executive, film producer, and screenwriter. Yablans served as an executive at Paramount Pictures, including President of the studio, in the 1960s and 1970s.

== Early life ==
Frank Yablans was born in Brooklyn, New York to Annette and Morris Yablans. Yablans&#x27; father was a taxi driver. His older brother, Irwin Yablans, produced &quot;Halloween&quot; (1978). Yablans was Jewish.

== Career ==
Yablans entered the motion picture business in 1956, joining Warner Bros. sales. In 1959, he joined Buena Vista as the Milwaukee sales manager where he stayed until 1966. He joined Sigma III and later transitioned to Filmways after it acquired Sigma III.

He became executive vice president of sales for Paramount Pictures in June 1969, where his marketing of the film &quot;Love Story&quot; (1970), led to his appointment as Paramount Studios&#x27; president on May 10, 1971.

As head of Paramount, he oversaw the release and marketing of &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972), &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; (1974), and &quot;Chinatown&quot; (1974). He also personally supervised the 100th birthday celebrations of studio founder Adolph Zukor in January 1973. Following a reorganization at Paramount in which Charles Bluhdorn, the chairman and CEO of Gulf &amp; Western Industries, was replaced by Barry Diller, Yablans announced his resignation as president on November 8, 1974.

After leaving Paramount he became an independent producer, working primarily through Paramount and 20th Century Fox. He was executive producer of &quot;Silver Streak&quot; (1976), &quot;The Other Side of Midnight&quot; (1977), &quot;Congo&quot; (1995), and the HBO series &quot;Rome&quot;. He also produced and adapted the screenplays for &quot;North Dallas Forty&quot; (1979) and &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot; (1981), both based on books.

Yablans was recruited by Kirk Kerkorian to head his troubled and debt-laden film company Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). While Yablans&#x27; reorganization of MGM and United Artists (UA) into a single entity (as MGM/UA) served to reduce costs and overhead, the company continued to lose value, and in 1986 was purchased by Ted Turner Productions for a reported $1.25 billion. He then formed Northstar Entertainment Corporation, with a partnership at Producers Sales Organization. In 1986, he set up a two-year, seven-picture agreement with low-budget studio Empire International to produce feature films. In 1987, director Arthur Seidelman partnered with Yablans to produce feature films.

In 2000, Yablans and partners Cindy Bond, Charlie Stuart Gay and Ron Booth founded Promenade Pictures, a production and marketing company committed to &quot;family-friendly&quot; entertainment. Its most ambitious project was the &quot;Epic Stories of the Bible&quot; series of CGI-animated features, starting with &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (2007) and &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark: The New Beginning&quot; (2012).

== Death ==
Yablans died on Thanksgiving, November 27, 2014, from natural causes at the age of 79. He had three children – Robert Yablans (deceased), Sharon Abrams, and Edward Yablans.

<text>Charles Elmer Sawyer (January 24, 1860 – September 23, 1924), was a homeopathic physician who was the longtime personal doctor to U.S. President Warren G. Harding and First Lady Florence Kling Harding. Sawyer is often blamed in the matter of Harding&#x27;s death in 1923.

==Education and private practice==
Sawyer was born in Wyandot, Ohio and raised in Nevada, Ohio, in Wyandot County, the eldest of six children and only one to survive to adulthood. He married May Elizabeth Barron. Sawyer had one son, Carl, born in 1881.

Sawyer was an 1881 graduate of the Cleveland Homeopathic Hospital College, Cleveland, Ohio, earning his degree in homeopathy, and began his practice outside of LaRue, Ohio in western Marion County, Ohio. Following a brief period in Indianapolis, the Sawyers returned to Marion in 1895 where Dr. Sawyer began the construction of a modern sanatorium for the treatment of medical and emotional maladies. This building was built in three stages and is currently located on South Main Street in Marion, Ohio; the building is currently known as the Elite (E-light) Apartments. Sawyer also operated the Parkview Sanatorium in Columbus, Ohio under the corporate name of &quot;Ohio Sanatorium Company&quot;.

He also became the director of the Marion National Bank and president of the Marion Masonic Temple Company. Sawyer was also a director of the Marion Commercial Club. He was an atheist.

In the early years of the 20th century, Sawyer expanded his practice with the construction of the White Oaks Sanatorium immediately south of Marion, Ohio. The sanatorium&#x27;s name was derived from the White Oaks Farm, which the Sawyers purchased and used as the location of their new facility. White Oaks was a compound of buildings which enclosed a courtyard. Buildings included patient wards, called cottages, which were located inside the cloister. Buildings ringing the outside of the cloister included a Nurses dormitory, administrative offices, dining hall for patients who were ambulatory, sterile surgery, physical rehabilitation building, facilities for dental work and doctors offices.

It was here, in Rose Cottage, that former First Lady Florence Kling Harding spent time near the end of her life. She then returned to live in Sawyer&#x27;s former home at 1201 Bellefontaine Avenue in Marion, where she died in November 1924. The home on Bellefontaine Avenue was destroyed by fire on August 19, 2010. White Oaks institution continued to operate until the late 1960s. The site is now known as Sawyer Ludwig Park and is operated by the Marion, Ohio Department of Parks and Recreation.

Dr. Sawyer&#x27;s relationship with the family of Warren G. Harding’s parents began when Sawyer stepped forward to save the reputation of Harding’s mother, Dr. Phoebe Dickerson Harding. Harding’s mother had been caring for a sick child and provided a prescription for the child, which unknown to her also contained an opiate; the child died from the drug. Sawyer stepped forward to validate Phoebe Harding’s diagnosis and treatment, thus saving her career.

==President Harding&#x27;s death==

Sawyer acted as the personal physician to Warren G. Harding and to Florence Harding as well. He never accepted payment from them for his services; in doing so he felt that he provided himself a level of protection in the event that either died while under his care. Sawyer diagnosed and successfully treated Mrs. Harding’s &quot;floating kidney&quot; condition, the first doctor to do so, and thus gained her loyalty.

Harding gave Sawyer the rank of brigadier general in the Army Medical Corps.

Sawyer&#x27;s reliance on dated medical practices resulted in the misdiagnosis of the President&#x27;s coronary condition that led to the President&#x27;s death in San Francisco in 1923. Joel Boone, M.D., the Vice Admiral in the United States Naval Medical Corps, had diagnosed the condition while Harding was on tour in Alaska. Sawyer deferred to the attending physician; however, Harding insisted on finishing the trip. It has even been speculated that Sawyer&#x27;s use of harsh purgatives was the cause of Harding&#x27;s fatal heart attack. The nursing notes from President Harding&#x27;s medical records do not support this contention. Harding died of congestive heart failure and suffered a fatal heart attack. Harding&#x27;s medical records from the western trip (the six-week trip during which he died) exist, and they show a man suffering from high blood pressure, chest pains, respiratory discomfort, indigestion, etc. Cardiac medicine was in its infancy, and these symptoms, while very recognizable symptoms in the modern day, were not automatic signals then for an impending catastrophic event. At Sawyer&#x27;s recommendation, Mrs. Harding did not have an autopsy performed.

Following the President&#x27;s death, Sawyer resigned his commission, and focused his attention on the formation of the Harding Memorial Association, to which the task of designing and building the Harding Memorial in Marion fell. Sawyer died within a month of the announcement that a location had been secured, which delayed completion of the marble memorial until December 1927. The memorial was dedicated in 1931 by President Herbert Hoover.

Sawyer&#x27;s practice and leadership within the Harding Memorial Association fell to his son, Dr. Carl Sawyer, who ran both organizations until his death in the late 1960s. In the 1980s, the Harding Memorial and the Harding Home were transferred to the Ohio Historical Society.

<doc id="924595" wikidata="Q5065783" url="?curid=924595" title="Ceylon Defence Force">
<text>The Ceylon Defence Force (CDF) was established in 1910 by the Ceylonese legislation &quot;Ceylon Defence Force Ordinance&quot;, which reformed the Ceylon Volunteer Force (CVF) that existed previously as the military reserve in the British Crown colony of Ceylon. At the time of forming it was only a reserve force but soon developed into a regular force responsible for the defence of Ceylon. The CDF was under the command of the General Officer Commanding, Ceylon of the British Army in Ceylon if mobilised. However mobilisation could be carried out only under orders from the Governor.

==History==
The origins of the Ceylon Defence Force can be traced back to the formation of the Ceylon Volunteers in 1881, whereby the Citizens&#x27; Rifle Society rifle section was designated the 1st Battalion Ceylon Light Infantry with Lieutenant Colonel John Scott Armtage appointed as the first Commanding Officer. The Ceylon Volunteers subsequently were renamed the Ceylon Volunteer Force and finally was renamed the Ceylon Defence Force in 1910. Units of the Ceylon Volunteer Force in 1910.

* Ceylon Artillery Volunteers (CAV)
* Ceylon Light Infantry (CLI)
* Ceylon Mounted Infantry (CMI)
* Ceylon Planters Rifle Corps (CPRC)
* Ceylon Volunteer Medical Corps (CVMC)
* Ceylon Engineers (CE)
* Cadet Battalion Ceylon Light Infantry

===Second Boer War===
In 1900 Ceylon Mounted Infantry saw action and in 1902 a contingent of Ceylon Planters Rifle Corps, took part in the Second Boer War in South Africa. Their services were recognised by presentation, in 1902, of a colour to the Ceylon Mounted Infantry, and a presentation in 1904, of a Banner to the Ceylon Planters Rifle Corps.

Although there were Ceylonese officers much of the officer corps was made up of British officers and the other ranks were mostly Ceylonese with the exception of the Ceylon Planters Rifle Corps which was completely made up of Europeans.

===First World War===
In 1914, with the outbreak of the First World War, the Ceylon Defence Force was mobilised and expanded. Many volunteers from the Defence Force traveled to England and joined the British Army, and many of them were killed in action. One of them mentioned by Arthur Conan Doyle was Private Jacotine of the Ceylon Light Infantry, who was the last man left alive in his unit at the Battle of Lys, and who continued to fight for 20 minutes before he was killed. The CPRC sent a force of 8 officers and 229 other ranks commanded by Major J. Hall Brown to the Great War. The unit sailed for Egypt in October 1914, and was deployed in defence of the Suez Canal. This unit was officially attached to the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) and was in 1915 dispatched to Anzac Cove (‘Z’ Beach) on the Gallipoli Peninsula. The CPRC performed operational duties as guards to ANZAC headquarter staff, including the General Officer Commanding ANZAC, Lieutenant General William Birdwood, who remarked, “I have an excellent guard of Ceylon Planters who are such a nice lot of fellows.” According to its onetime Commanding Officer (CO), Colonel T.Y. Wright (1904–1912), the Ceylon Planters Rifle Corps had sustained overall losses of 80 killed and 99 wounded in the Great War. Soon after the war the 80th Carnatics, who were the last regular military unit stationed in Ceylon on garrison duties, left. This resulted in the Ceylon Defence Force becoming a regular military unit with some units, such as the Mobilized Detachment of Ceylon Light Infantry Volunteers having troops mobilised on a permanent basis.

===Second World War===


In 1939, when the Second World War began, the Ceylon Defence Force was mobilised and expanded to fortify Ceylon to meet a possible threat posed by the Japanese. CDF came direct command of the South East Asia Command (SEAC) and formed part of the British 11th Army Group. It was sometimes referred to as the British Army in Ceylon or Ceylon Army Command during this time. South East Asia Command under Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten had its headquarters located at Kandy, Ceylon.

Troops from the Ceylon Defence Force, mainly the Ceylon Light Infantry and the Ceylon Garrison Artillery were placed outside Ceylon undertaking garrison duties on the Seychelles and the Cocos Islands. In Cocos Islands Mutiny took place (encouraged by Trotskyist Lanka Sama Samaja Party) by a few members of the Ceylon Garrison Artillery but was immediately put down by the Ceylon Light Infantry. CLI troops in 1941 escorted Italian POWs from the Middle East to Ceylon, and later in 1946 Japanese POWs from Ceylon to India.

In 1945 reached its wartime peak at 645 officers and 14,247 other ranks. At the centre of the expansion was the Ceylon Light Infantry which grew by 1946 from one to five battalions.

===Post war===
In 1947 the CDF was again mobilised in its last major internal security operation to suppress a left wing hartal, or mass stoppage of work. The Ceylon Defence Force was given additional support by an armed detachment of British Royal Marines from HMS &quot;Glasgow&quot;, who were utilised to deter strikers in Colombo.

The Ceylon Defence Force was officially disbanded on 11 April 1949 and reconstituted by &quot;Army Act No. 17 of 1949&quot; which revoked the &quot;Ceylon Defence Force Ordinance of 1910&quot; as the Ceylon Volunteer Force (CVF), itself becoming the Sri Lanka Army Volunteer Force (SLAVF) in 1972.

==Impact on the Ceylon Army==
Soldiers who had experience in the CDF were actively recruited into the newly constructed regular force, and reconstituted volunteer force of the new Ceylon Army. In its first few years, and with few exceptions, the only new recruits enlisted were officer cadets and soldiers below the rank of warrant officer. Ceylon Defence Force veterans featured prominently in the post-independence regular Ceylon Army until General D. S. Attygalle (1967–1977) finished his term as Commander. The last Ceylon Defence Force veteran to leave the Army was Brigadier T. S. B. Sally, who ended his service tenure in 1979.

* Ceylon Cadet Battalion (CCB) (1902–Present)
* Ceylon Mounted Rifles (CMR) (1906–1938)
* Ceylon Engineers (CE) (1911–Present)

* Auxiliary Territorial Service (Ceylon) (ATS (Ceylon)) (1943–1946)
* Royal Military Police (Ceylon) (1944–1949)

==Personnel==
Its commissioned officers received their commission from the Governor, instead of the British Monarch which was the case in the British Army. Since the force was a volunteer force, its personnel were made up of exclusively of the upper and middle class of the island who could spare the free time. Much of the officer carder was made up of Europeans, Burghers and a smaller extent from the Sinhalese, Tamils and Moor communities. A few Europeans had served with the British Army, vast majority were planters, landowners and professionals such as lawyers, doctors engineers and civil servants. Oxbridge graduates could easily gain a commission. Officer training was limited with, much of the training and activity were planned on weekends and at the annual training camp and exercise that took place in Diyatalawa. Infantry companies were formed in cities and towns with local volunteers.

===Recruitment===
Recruitment took place at regiment and unit level, with the commanding officer of the regiment deciding on both the officer and other ranks recruited into their respective units, following an application and an interview by a recruitment board. This meant that regiments retained exclusiveness such as the Ceylon Mounted Rifles and the Ceylon Planters Rifle Corps which was limited to Europeans and not opened to native Ceylonese.

===Training===
As volunteer units, the CDF personal served in a part-time basis. They would carryout dills and practice during a weekend per month and would undertake a training camp of two week duration once a year at Imperial Camp in the Diyatalawa Garrison.

<doc id="924596" wikidata="Q2707712" url="?curid=924596" title="SUNEL Arena">
<text>SUNEL Arena, also known as the Ano Liosia Olympic Hall, is a multi-purpose indoor arena located in Ano Liosia, in the western section of Athens, Greece. Originally built to host martial arts events during the 2004 Athens Summer Olympics, the arena has since been adapted for various uses. In 2021, the arena became the home for AEK B.C., for their games in the Greek Basket League and the Basketball Champions League.

The arena can accommodate 8,327 spectators for sports events with fixed tiered seating. This number rises to 9,327 when the retractable seating is fully extended, allowing for a versatile setup that suits sports events, concerts, and other large-scale gatherings. For AEK BC basketball games, the capacity is 9,025. Additionally, the arena can host up to 11,600 spectators for concerts. It ranks as the third-largest basketball arena in Greece, behind O.A.C.A. Olympic Indoor Hall and Peace and Friendship Stadium.

== History ==

=== Athens 2004 and the years after ===
Ano Liosia Olympic Hall was opened in 2004. The arena was used to host the judo and wrestling events at the 2004 Athens Summer Olympics.

After the 2004 Athens Summer Olympics, the venue became the site of various television productions, including the Greek version of the reality show &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot;. From 19 May to 6 June 2010, the arena hosted the Greek Ice Hockey Championship, for both men and women. At one point in time, the arena was scheduled to be the home of the Hellenic Academy of Culture and Hellenic Digital Archive.

=== AEK B.C. ===
On May 13, 2019, the Greek Government decided to cede the venue to the General Secretariat of Sports, with the aim of subsequently ceding it to AEK B.C.. On June 22, 2020, it was announced that the arena&#x27;s use until the year 2040, was granted to the professional basketball club A.E.K., of the Greek Basket League, in order for the arena to host the home games of the club.
== Basketball ==

=== AEK B.C. ===
A.E.K began using the arena for the 2021–22 season. The club made its unofficial debut at the facilities in a victorious (102-81) friendly match against the London Lions, and its official debut in the context of the Basket League in a victorious (81-69) match against Larisa. The strategic goal is to create a new cultural identity and brand name for the wider region, with the long-term aim being the redevelopment of the surrounding area of the Olympic Center. 

Serbian player Stevan Jelovac, who played for AEK Athens before his sudden death, was honored by the club with a gesture meant to stand the test of time. The gym of the arena was renamed &quot;Stevan Jelovac Gymnasium&quot; (Greek: «ΓΥΜΝΑΣΤΗΡΙΟ STEVAN JELOVAC»). Jelovac&#x27;s number 13 jersey was retired by the club during a ceremony on December 14, 2021.
=== Greece men&#x27;s national basketball team ===
The SUNEL Arena hosted two crucial FIBA World Cup 2023 qualifying matches for Greece&#x27;s men&#x27;s national basketball team. On February 25, 2022, Greece secured a thrilling 72-71 victory against Turkey. A year later, on February 24, 2023, Greece triumphed over Serbia with a 97-92 win in overtime, led by stellar performances from Nikos Rogkavopoulos (28 points) and Dimitris Moraitis (23 points). Despite trailing by 13 points, Greece rallied in the final period and overtime, but could not surpass the point difference from their previous loss to Serbia.

=== Elite League Final 4 ===
The Ano Liosia Olympic Hall hosted the Elite League Final Four from May 17-19, 2024. Milonas claimed the championship after defeating Panionios 87-79 in a thrilling final, securing promotion to the Basket League for the third time in their history. Iraklis beat Ermis Schimatariou 80-73 to face Panionios for the second promotion spot. Panionios claimed the second promotion spot with a 75-70 victory over Iraklis. The match was intense, with Panionios pulling ahead in the final moments thanks to key plays by Milintejevic, Gikas, and Kaklamanakis.

== Naming rights ==
AEK BC and SUNEL Group, on September 18, 2024, announced a major partnership renaming their home arena to &quot;SUNEL Arena&quot;. This historic collaboration marks the first time a Greek basketball team has sold the naming rights to its home arena. The arena, a former Olympic facility, is set to become the first in Greece to achieve a zero carbon footprint as part of a long-term sustainability project.The five-year agreement, running through 2029, reflects AEK&#x27;s environmental commitment, with an option to extend the deal for an additional 10 years until 2039. SUNEL, an energy group operating in 12 countries, specializes in renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions.

== Accessibility and transportation ==
To access the SUNEL Arena fans have several transportation options. Those using public transport can take the suburban railway (Proastiakos) to Ano Liosia Station and then transfer to bus line 749 that stops outside the Olympic Hall. Additionally, metro users can take bus line B12 from the Attiki Metro Station and disembark at the 23rd stop on Fylis Street (Greek: 23η ΦΥΛΗΣ), which is a 15 minutes walk to the venue. For those driving, exit 5 on the Attiki Odos highway provides easy access to the arena, with parking available.

== Other uses ==

=== Concerts ===
SUNEL Arena has quickly established itself as a premier destination for live music, with a seating capacity of 8,600 and an arena floor accommodating 3,000 standing or 1,200 seated attendees. On November 16, 2024, it hosted its first rap concert, headlined by Albanian superstar Noizy, joined by Greek trap icon Light and other Greek artists, drawing over 3,000 fans. A week later, on November 23, the arena transformed for its debut techno event, featuring Amelie Lens and KI/KI, supported by Greek DJs.

=== Tennis ===
In February 2024, Greece faced Romania in the Davis Cup World Group I playoffs at the Ano Liosia Olympic Hall, marking a critical match for the Greek team. Led by Stefanos Tsitsipas, the Greek team secured a decisive 3-0 victory. Tsitsipas won his singles match on the first day, while his brother, Petros Tsitsipas, teamed up with him for a thrilling doubles victory against Romania’s Marius Copil and Victor Vlad Cornea. The Tsitsipas brothers overcame an initial set loss to win the match 6-7(4), 6-3, 6-4, sealing Greece’s spot in the World Group I for only the second time in its history.

=== Handball ===
The final of the Greek Men&#x27;s Handball Cup took place on March 19, 2014, at the Ano Liosia Olympic Hall. It was AEK&#x27;s first match in this venue, where they defeated Diomidis Argous 18–16 to win their third Greek Cup. Since then, AEK&#x27;s handball team has played several games for the Greek Men&#x27;s Handball Championship and the EHF European Cup at the SUNEL Arena.

=== Karate ===
The Ano Liosia Olympic Hall has hosted the WKF Karate 1 Series A twice, in January 2023 and 2024. These events attracted over 1,100 athletes from more than 70 countries each year. The tournaments marked significant milestones for Greek Karate.

<doc id="924598" wikidata="Q3242393" url="?curid=924598" title="River Fal">
<text>The River Fal () flows through Cornwall, rising at Pentevale on Goss Moor (between St. Columb and Roche) and reaching the English Channel at Falmouth. On or near the banks of the Fal are the castles of Pendennis and St Mawes as well as Trelissick Garden. The River Fal separates the Roseland peninsula from the rest of Cornwall. Like most of its kind on the south coast of Cornwall and Devon, the Fal estuary is a classic ria, or drowned river valley. The Fal estuary from Tregony to the Truro River was originally called Hafaraell (, meaning &quot;fallow place&quot;).

==Toponymy==
The origin and meaning of the name of the river are unknown. The earliest occurrences of the name are in documents from AD 969 and 1049. Falmouth is named after the River Fal. The word &quot;Fal&quot; in Cornish may refer to a prince, or perhaps to a spade or shovel. Robert Williams notes these meanings in his 1865 Cornish dictionary. However, he notes FÂL as the word PÂL after undergoing aspirate mutation; and a word FAL meaning prince, but apparently a ghost word. 
He does not link either of these to the name of the river Fal.

==History==
The river mouth and Falmouth harbour served as an anchorage in the immediate years after the Second World War for scores of laid-up Royal Navy vessels (including battleships, carriers, and cruisers) awaiting sale for scrap. Its size and depth of water made it ideal for this use. 

The River Fal suffered a severe, high-profile pollution accident in February 1992, when a nearby tin mine was flooded. The river turned red and an extensive cleaning-up operation was needed to decontaminate the water. During times of reduced global trade, ships are mothballed in the upper parts of the estuary of the River Fal. The ships, using the Fal estuary due to its depth and protection from the elements, keep a skeleton crew for ship maintenance. A large number of ships were moored in the estuary during the Great Recession, as falling global trade meant a smaller demand for cargo ships. Falmouth Harbour authority charges companies for usage of the river, until the ships are either reactivated, scrapped or sold.

==Geography and hydrology==
The source can be traced to Pentevale, (more correctly Pentivale ) (, meaning &quot;head spring of the Fal&quot;). The catchment of the Fal is predominantly Devonian slates, shales and grits, with granite in the upper reaches. Land use is mainly agricultural with some woodland.

Tributaries of the River Fal include the Truro River, River Kennal, Penryn River and Carnon River. Several tidal creeks discharge into the River Fal including Mylor Creek, Pill Creek, Penpol Creek, the Percuil River and Restronguet Creek. The Fal/Truro waterway is navigable between Falmouth and Truro. The River Fal is crossed by the King Harry Ferry, a vehicular chain ferry that links the villages of Feock and Philleigh approximately equidistant between Truro and Falmouth. The river flows through the Carrick Roads, a large ria that creates a natural harbour. Here, pedestrian ferries connect Falmouth with St Mawes.

==Wildlife and conservation==
Five Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) have been designated along the River Fal. The river rises on Goss Moor which is both a National Nature Reserve and part of a SSSI. The wetland habitats and western dry heath communities were formed, since the Bronze Age, by the mining of the alluvial tin deposits. South Terras Mine SSSI is also a Geological Conservation Review (GCR) site of national importance and was once a commercial uranium mine. The Crowhill Valley SSSI between Grampound and St Stephen is an ancient woodland dominated by sessile oak on the slopes, and of willow and alder carr on the floodplain which has a rich ground flora. The species list includes many ancient woodland indicators including lichens such as &quot;Parmelia endochlora&quot;.

The Upper Fal Estuary and Woods SSSI is mostly within the tidal area of the river between Tregony and Turnaware Point and includes mudflats, salt marsh and ancient woodland. The mudflats support nationally important numbers of black-tailed godwit as well as large populations of wintering waders and wildfowl such as curlew and golden plover. A series of transition zones occur from the salt marsh to scrub, where young trees attempt to grow despite the threat of the highest tides, to ancient woodland on the higher slopes. These zones and the estuary itself are important for otters. The lowest part of the Fal along with the Helford River is designated as the Fal and Helford Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive for the shallow bays and inlets, sandbanks and mudflats, and for its salt marshes. Part of the area is also designated as an Important Plant Area and a SSSI (Lower Fal &amp; Helford Intertidal) for the relatively undisturbed transitions from tidal mud through saltmarsh and scrub to woodland.

Three institutional landowners that own land within Upper Fal Estuary and Woods SSSI include the Duchy of Cornwall, the National Trust (for example, the Trelissick estate) and the Diocese of Truro (via its Diocesan Board of Finance).

==Water quality==
The Fal has been described as the most polluted river in England. in 2021, raw sewage was discharged straight into the river for over 7,500 hours as a consequence of the 100-year old sewage system being overwhelmed by heavy rain.

==Recreation==
The River Fal is accessible for kayaking, sailing and other watersports.

<text>The Faliro Coastal Zone Olympic Sports Complex is a complex in the coastal zone of Piraeus, Greece. It consists of two indoor arenas and a beach volleyball stadium, and it hosted Handball, Taekwondo, and volleyball events at the 2004 Summer Olympics. The complex is located in Faliro, Attica.

The complex consists of the following venues:

==Peace and Friendship Stadium==

The Peace and Friendship Stadium SEF, known as &quot;S.E.F.&quot; is an indoor arena located in Faliro, Athens that hosted indoor volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.

The arena which was built in 1981 and it opened in 1985 had previously hosted various major international events, including the Final tournament of the 1987 Men&#x27;s European Basketball Championships and preliminary games of the 1998 FIBA World Basketball Championships.

Renovations for the Olympics commenced in April 2002 and were completed on June 30, 2004. The new stadium was officially opened on August 11, 2004, shortly before the opening of the games. The venue&#x27;s current regular seating capacity is 14,940 seats, while the regular capacity was 17,000 seats before the 2004 Summer Olympics renovation.

However, for home playoff matches of the Olympiacos basketball club, for which the SEF arena is their regular home court, the seating capacity can be increased to 16,000-17,000 with temporary seating.

==Sports Pavilion==
The Faliro Sports Pavilion Arena () is an indoor arena in Palaio Faliro, in Attica, Greece. It was the site of preliminary matches in handball and the taekwondo competition in the 2004 Summer Olympics at Athens. The arena was completed on December 20, 2003, and officially opened on August 12, 2004, shortly before the Olympics. The arena seats 8,536, though only 5,800 seats were publicly available during the Olympics.

==Olympic Beach Volleyball Centre==
==After the games==
The Peace &amp; Friendship Stadium is used by Olympiacos Basketball Club (as it was before the Olympics) and regularly holds crowds of up to 14,905 fans, especially for Euroleague basketball games.

Some of the facilities are presently in use or in the process of being converted for post-Olympics use, as shown below:

<doc id="924625" wikidata="Q751363" url="?curid=924625" title="Philip Taylor Kramer">
<text>Philip Taylor Kramer (July 12, 1952 – ) was an American bass guitar player for the rock group Iron Butterfly and associated groups between 1974 and 1980. He later became a computer engineering executive and inventor. He disappeared in February 1995 and was found dead in May 1999.

==Early life and music career==
Philip Taylor Kramer was born in 1952 in Youngstown, Ohio. In 1974, he joined Iron Butterfly as its bass player, playing on two of the group&#x27;s albums, &quot;Scorching Beauty&quot; and &quot;Sun and Steel&quot;, both released in 1975. After the breakup of Iron Butterfly, Kramer continued to play with founding member Ron Bushy in the groups Magic and Gold between 1977 and 1980.

==Engineering career==
Kramer later obtained a degree in aerospace engineering. He worked on the MX missile guidance system for a contractor of the US Department of Defense and later in the computer industry on fractal compression, facial recognition systems, and advanced communications.

Kramer, the son of a professor of electrical engineering, had a lifelong interest in science and mathematical theorems. In 1964, at the age of 12, he won the science fair at Liberty School in Youngstown, Ohio, by building a laser with a beam strong enough to pop a balloon. In 1990, at the age of 38, Kramer co-founded Total Multimedia Inc. with Randy Jackson (brother of Michael Jackson) to develop data compression techniques for CD-ROMs. The firm claims it developed the first video compression capable of producing full motion video from a single speed CD-ROM in 1992. In 1994 the company was reorganized under bankruptcy and hired new leadership. Kramer continued working there until his disappearance, though he was profoundly affected by the bankruptcy and reorganization. Kramer co-developed SoftVideo based on fractal compression and he also claimed to work on a transmission project that would result in faster-than-light speed communications. The latter related to his father Ray&#x27;s long-running family effort to discredit Albert Einstein&#x27;s theories.

==Death and investigation==
On February 12, 1995, Kramer drove to Los Angeles International Airport to pick up a business associate and the associate&#x27;s wife. The business associate had been a principal investor in Total Multimedia and also a principal instigator of its bankruptcy reorganization. On his way to the airport, Kramer telephoned his wife to advise her that plans had changed, and that the business associate and his wife should go directly from the airport to a hotel, where Kramer and his wife would meet them later. Kramer nonetheless appears to have spent forty-five minutes at the airport, for unexplained reasons.

During his travel to and from the airport, Kramer made a flurry of cell phone calls, including calls to his wife, Ron Bushy and finally to the police. In the latter call, Kramer said, &quot;I&#x27;m going to kill myself. And I want everyone to know O. J. Simpson is innocent. They did it.&quot; Prior to his disappearance, Kramer was hired to analyze the authenticity of a video tape that the FBI and the DEA had on the O.J. Simpson murder trial. 

Kramer was never heard from again. His disappearance led to a massive search, many news reports, and talk show segments including an episode of &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;, &quot;The Unexplained&quot; (&quot;Strange Disappearances,&quot; first aired June 7, 2000) and &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; (Season 8 Episode 3). An article in &quot;Skeptic Vol. 4, No. 2, 1996&quot;, by Fredric L. Rice reported numerous conspiracy theories about his death. In the beginning of the March 6, 1997, episode of Coast to Coast AM, remote viewer Ed Dames told Kathy Kramer-Peterssen, Phil&#x27;s sister, that his team&#x27;s findings were that Phil was murdered, the body was buried but quickly decayed due to water, and it was brought to Montana from California. More recently, the mysterious disappearance of Kramer was highlighted in an episode titled &quot;CONSPIRACY: Philip Taylor Kramer&quot; on an audio podcast named &quot;Supernatural with Ashley Flowers&quot;, released on August 24, 2021. The office of James Traficant investigated Kramer&#x27;s case, and twice asked the FBI to look into it. The FBI did not believe there was enough reason to launch a separate criminal investigation of its own, although it assisted the Ventura County sheriff&#x27;s office.

===Discovery===
On May 29, 1999, Kramer&#x27;s Ford Aerostar minivan and skeletal remains were found by photographers looking for old car wrecks to shoot at the bottom of Decker Canyon near Malibu, California. However, his father never believed he killed himself and is quoted as saying, &quot;Taylor had told me a long time before there were people bothering him. They wanted what he was doing and some of them threatened him. He once told me that if I ever say I&#x27;m gonna kill myself, don&#x27;t you believe it one bit. I&#x27;ll be needing help.&quot;

<doc id="924633" wikidata="Q4951110" url="?curid=924633" title="Bowles Hall">
<text>Bowles Hall is a coed residential college at the University of California, Berkeley, known for its unique traditions, parties, and camaraderie. Designed by George W. Kelham, the building was the first residence hall on campus, dedicated in 1929, and was California&#x27;s first state-owned residence hall. It was built in 1928 with a $350,000 grant from Mary McNear Bowles in memory of her husband, Berkeley alumnus and University of California Regent Phillip E. Bowles. Mr. Bowles was said to have three loves: horses, horticulture and the University of California.

Although a university-operated residence hall, its male-only tradition, classic façade, partitioned four-man rooms, and common areas gave it a social, fraternity-like atmosphere. &quot;Bowlesmen&quot; have traditionally been a tight-knit group of students who regularly practice various traditions and rituals that are exclusive to the Hall. With its pale stone exterior, five-arch entry arcade, and crenelated tower, it was listed in 1989 in the National Register of Historic Places as an example of &#x27;Collegiate Gothic&#x27; architecture.

From 2006 to 2014, a group of former residents worked with Berkeley officials, planning the Hall&#x27;s restoration and reconstitution as a co-ed residential college. Following a 14-month restoration in a public-private partnership, the Hall reopened in August 2016, welcoming female students for the first time.

==The building==

Designed by George W. Kelham, the building has eight levels comprising two-room suites and a common room (originally designed to house two, but now housing four). The Julien and Helen Hart Memorial Library was added to the building in 1939 through the gift of James D. Hart, their son, and their daughter, Ellen, and her husband, San Francisco architect and engineer Joseph Bransten. Hart was a professor of English and the editor of the Oxford Handbook of American Literature. Bowles Hall also sits on top of the Hayward Fault.

In order to avoid having the aging residence hall dismantled in the late 1980s, a group of Bowlesmen successfully petitioned to have the building added to the National Register of Historic Places (#89000195, 1989). The hall was also designated a City of Berkeley landmark on October 17, 1988, a mere 11 years after the first recorded &quot;high five&quot;.

The hall earned LEED Silver certification in August 2017.

==Recent history – restoration==
The university administration attempted to dismantle Bowles Hall and build a new residence hall in its place, but this was deterred when Bowles Hall was entered into the National Register of Historic Places. In April 2001, food service in the dining hall was ended and the dining room made into a generic &quot;recreation room.&quot; The dining hall had previously hosted popular barbecue dinners on Friday evenings.

In 2006, the Haas School of Business was planning to turn Bowles into an educational center and conference facility, but the university backed down from the decision. At about this time, a group of alumni formed the Bowles Hall Alumni Association, and then the Bowles Hall Foundation, with the aim of establishing Bowles Hall as a modern residential college.

In 2014, the Regents of the University of California approved a plan that enabled the Bowles Hall Foundation, a 501c(3) entity, to renovate and operate Bowles Hall as a residential college under a 45-year lease. The Foundation developed a plan to completely renovate and refurnish Bowles Hall. In June 2015, formal agreements with the Regents of the University of California were executed. The restored Hall reopened in August 2016. It serves 188 undergraduate students, three live-in faculty members, and several graduate residents. It is considered on-campus housing for the purposes of financial aid.

== History ==

In the late 1940s and the 1950s, Rose Gilmore, the widow of a Berkeley professor who was looking for her own calling at Cal, fulfilled the position of Head Resident.

Women have been welcomed as residents since 2016.

* &quot;Boys and Girls&quot; - Known as Carmen Hall in the movie.

==Bowles Hall drinking song==
Traditionally the Cal Band parades from nearby Memorial Stadium through the campus and streets of Berkeley after a home football game. The band will play in front of Bowles Hall during their tour, playing &quot;By&quot; for the Bowlesmen. The tradition of playing &quot;By&quot; for Bowles Hall is said to have begun back when the entire football team lived there. The band would play for the players as they walked back to their residence hall after the game. However, when the football team was relocated, the band decided not to play in front of Bowles Hall. Subsequently, some of the men of Bowles lay down in the road, blocking the Cal Band from playing, until the band was forced to oblige them.
&quot;We&#x27;re the men of Bowles Association,&quot;
&quot;Coming here from over all the nation.&quot;
&quot;Drinking here together one and all,&quot;
&quot;We lift our voices loud for Bowles Hall!&quot;

&quot;(Chorus)

&quot;Here&#x27;s to Bowles Association.&quot;
&quot;Drink it down and then,&quot;
&quot;Drink a toast to home sweet home,&quot;
&quot;Of California men. Rah! Rah! Rah!&quot;
&quot;Fill your glasses to the brim,&quot;
&quot;And lift them in the air.&quot;
&quot;And drink a toast to Bowles Association,&quot;
&quot;And the Golden Bear.&quot;

&quot;Men of Bowles are gathered here together,&quot;
&quot;Toasting everything from girls to weather.&quot;
&quot;But the very greatest toast of all,&quot;
&quot;Is the one that we now give to Bowles Hall!&quot;

&quot;(Chorus)&quot;

--Joseph Ehrman III, 1948

<text>The Advanced Computing Environment (ACE) was defined by an industry consortium in the early 1990s to be the next generation commodity computing platform, the successor to personal computers based on Intel&#x27;s 32-bit instruction set architecture. The effort found little support in the market and dissolved due to infighting within the group and a lack of sales.

==History==
=== Formation ===
The consortium was announced on the 9th of April 1991 by Compaq, Microsoft, MIPS Computer Systems, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), and the Santa Cruz Operation (SCO). Although the consortium&#x27;s definition of the Advanced RISC Computing (ARC) specification, indicating the details of an &quot;open and scalable&quot; hardware platform based on the MIPS architecture, was a significant focus of the initiative, the &quot;key force&quot; behind it was said to be Compaq recognising that it needed to pursue a strategy with MIPS in order to compete in the emerging personal workstation market. A week prior to the ACE announcement, Compaq had entered into a relationship with Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI) involving an investment in SGI, the payment of advance royalties, and a strategy to co-develop low-cost workstation systems targeting a price range of &quot;about $8,000 or $7,000 for a really usable system&quot;.

At the time it was widely believed that RISC-based systems would maintain a price/performance advantage over the &quot;ad hoc&quot; Wintel systems. However, it was also widely believed that Windows NT would quickly displace many other operating systems through the combined effects of a wide selection of software and the ease of building Wintel machines that supported it. ACE was formed to provide an alternative platform to Wintel, providing a viable alternative with the same advantages in terms of software support, and greater advantages in terms of performance.

The environment standardized on two hardware platforms: a personal computer platform based on the Intel 80386 and 80486 processors, and a workstation platform based on the ARC specification. To be supported by both hardware platforms were two operating systems: SCO UNIX with Open Desktop and what would become Windows NT (originally named OS/2 3.0). Other members of the consortium included Acer, Control Data Corporation, Kubota, NEC Corporation, NKK, Olivetti, Prime Computer, Pyramid Technology, Siemens, Silicon Graphics, Sony, Sumitomo, Tandem Computers, Wang Laboratories, and Zenith Data Systems. Besides these large companies, several startup companies built ACE-compliant systems as well.

Each of the companies involved had their own reasons for joining the ACE effort. MIPS wanted to reverse the fragmentation seen with existing MIPS-based systems that had limited wider adoption of the architecture. Various semiconductor companies, particularly &quot;giants&quot; such as Toshiba and NEC, were perceived as embracing the initiative to establish themselves and to take market share from Intel. DEC used the initiative as an attempt to take market share away from the workstation leader, Sun Microsystems, to respond to gains by Hewlett-Packard and IBM, and to proliferate its own technologies. Compaq, Microsoft and SCO were perceived to be using it as a defensive strategy to prevent &quot;Sun taking over the desktop and replacing Intel-architecture PCs with RISC, Unix SparcStations&quot; with the consequent loss of opportunities for those companies. By joining the initiative, SCO was able to broaden its portfolio to RISC platforms alongside its existing Intel platform products, and Microsoft needed vendor support for its &quot;Portable OS/2&quot;, later Windows NT, strategy.

===The Apache Group===
Even prior to the announcement of the initiative, a number of companies headed by Compaq and including Siemens, Sony, Silicon Graphics, Unisys and Control Data Corporation favoured the adoption of Unix System V Release 4 (SVR4) as the means to provide portability between the MIPS and Intel architectures. Since SVR4 favoured big-endian operation, this subgroup of members was known as the Apache group, reportedly conceived as a pun on &quot;Big Indian&quot;. At that early stage, a different group known as the Gibraltar group, consisting primarily of DEC and SCO, sought to define interoperability with DEC&#x27;s Ultrix operating system. The Apache group later adopted the name MIPS ABI after the demise of the ACE initiative.

The emerging rift within the ACE consortium was averted when it was decided to add support for SVR4 alongside OSF/1, thus placating the group which, by then, included Siemens, Sony, NEC, Prime Computer, Olivetti, Tandem and Pyramid among its members. Although concerns persisted about the domination of the initiative by the founding members, the introduction of SVR4 complicated the position of DEC and SCO whose involvement focused on SCO Open Desktop built on the OSF/1 kernel. However, the availability of SVR4 was regarded as a way of satisfying end-user demand, particularly by Compaq.

===Dissolution===
Even so, the ACE initiative (and consortium) began to fall apart little more than a year after it started, as it became apparent that there was not a mass market for an alternative to the Wintel computing platform. The upstart platforms did not offer enough performance improvement from the incumbent PC and there were major cost disadvantages of such systems due to the low volume production. When the initiative started, RISC based systems (running at 100-200 MHz at the time) had substantial performance advantages over Intel 80486 chips (running at approximately 60 MHz at the time), but the Pentium promised to reduce such advantages.

Compaq was the first company to leave the consortium, stating that with the departure of CEO Rod Canion, one of the primary backers behind the formation of ACE, they were shifting priorities away from higher-end systems. Other factors included Compaq&#x27;s ongoing restructuring amidst disappointing financial results, the accelerated introduction of the Pentium, and increasing availability of Unix software for the Intel architecture. This was followed in short order by SCO announcing that they were suspending all work on moving their version of Unix to the MIPS platform. Canion&#x27;s departure from Compaq had precipitated the dissolution of a technology development agreement between Compaq and SGI in early 1992 that had been established for the co-development of MIPS-based computers, although Compaq denied that this would result in the company withdrawing from the ACE consortium, which happened only months later.

There were other potential conflicts and difficulties for the consortium. In early 1992, SGI had announced its intention to acquire MIPS Computer Systems, leading vendors such as Control Data (&quot;the largest OEM customer of both MIPS and SGI&quot;) to consider switching to other architectures over concerns about this pending acquisition and SGI&#x27;s resulting control over the target platform. DEC had released their Alpha processor and were less interested in promoting a competing architecture, indicating continued low-end support for MIPS, but exhibiting a lack of commitment to future products, notably in relation to the MIPS R4000 line of processors and support for OSF/1 on the company&#x27;s DECstation products.

Meanwhile, the accelerated delivery and anticipated performance improvements of Intel&#x27;s upcoming Pentium processor, combined with more competitive pricing, made the &quot;20 to 30 percent premium&quot; of MIPS-based systems less attractive to vendors such as Compaq and their customers. Although ACE originally supported the x86 architecture, customers were reportedly confused by an incoherent message around the different hardware and software options encompassed by the initiative. Consequently, an increased emphasis on the MIPS architecture &quot;as an informal recognition of what the organization has really been doing all along&quot; was envisaged, focusing more on ARC as a way of delivering MIPS-based hardware. In April 1992, the ACE Executive Advisory Board refocused the initiative on systems software availability for the ARC platform.

Intel was never itself a member of ACE, with its processor architecture having been introduced to the effort by Compaq. Since MIPS had been seeking to gain market share at Intel&#x27;s expense, the initiative was a competitive threat to Intel, forcing the company &quot;to take greater steps to accommodate its customers&quot;. Indeed, one reported motivation for Compaq&#x27;s involvement in ACE was to &quot;light a fire under Intel&quot; and get the company to produce a roadmap that was competitive enough for Compaq&#x27;s customers. Intel&#x27;s response was to accelerate the delivery of the Pentium and to pursue parallel development of three generations of future products (P5, P6 and P7), thus providing a roadmap that could dissuade its customers from adopting RISC architectures.

==ARC==
The main product of the ACE group is the Advanced RISC Computing specification, or ARC. It was initially based on MIPS-based computer hardware and firmware environment. Although ACE went defunct, and no computer was ever manufactured which fully complied with the ARC standard, the ARC system still exerts a widespread legacy in that all Microsoft Windows NT-based operating systems (such as Windows XP) used ARC conventions for naming boot devices before Windows Vista. Further, SGI used a modified version of the ARC firmware (which it called ARCS) in its systems. All SGI computers which run IRIX 6.1 or later (such as the Indy, Octane, &quot;etc.&quot;) boot from an ARCS console (which uses the same drive naming conventions as Windows, accordingly).

In addition, most of the various RISC-based computers designed to run Windows NT used versions of the ARC boot console to boot NT. Among these computers were:

* MIPS R4000-based systems such as the MIPS Magnum workstation
* all Alpha-based machines with a PCI bus designed prior to the end of support for Windows NT Alpha in September 1999 (the Alpha ARC firmware was also known as AlphaBIOS)
* most Windows NT-capable PowerPC computers (such as the IBM RS/6000 40P).

It was also predicted that Intel IA-32-based computers would adopt the ARC console, although only SGI ever marketed such IA-32-based machines with ARC firmware (namely, the SGI Visual Workstation series, which went on sale in 1999).

<doc id="924636" wikidata="Q8346462" url="?curid=924636" title="Nestorian schism">
<text>The Nestorian schism ( 431–544) was a split between the Christian churches of Sassanid Persia, which affiliated with Nestorius, and those that later became the Catholic and Orthodox churches. The schism rose out of a Christological dispute, notably involving Cyril (Patriarch of Alexandria) and Nestorius (Patriarch of Constantinople). 

The First Council of Ephesus in 431 and the Council of Chalcedon in 451 condemned Nestorius and his doctrine, which emphasized the radical distinctness between Christ&#x27;s human and divine natures. That forced a breach between the churches that defended Nestorius and the state church of the Roman Empire, which caused the Church of the East, the Christian church of Sassanid Persia, to become known as the Nestorian Church, as it took the side of Nestorius.

==History==
The doctrine of Nestorianism is associated with Nestorius, the Patriarch of Constantinople from 428 to 431. Prior to becoming Patriarch, Nestorius had been a student of Theodore of Mopsuestia at the School of Antioch. Nestorius argued that Christ&#x27;s human and divine natures were distinct and so he was against using the title &quot;Theotokos&quot; (Greek: &quot;God bearer&quot;) for the Virgin Mary. He preferred to call her &quot;Christotokos&quot; (&quot;Christ bearer&quot;). Cyril of Alexandria considered the doctrine contrary to Orthodox teaching and encouraged measures against it.

Finally, Nestorius and his doctrine were condemned at the First Council of Ephesus in 431, which was reiterated at the Council of Chalcedon in 451.

Afterward, churches aligned with Nestorius were centred on the School of Edessa and were separated from the rest of the Christian Church. Anathemised in the Roman Empire, they relocated to the Sassanid Empire, where they were welcomed by Persian Christians, who had already declared independence from Constantinople in an attempt to cast off accusations of foreign allegiance.

The School of Edessa relocated to the Mesopotamian city of Nisibis. The School of Nisibis thereafter became a centre of Nestorianism. In 484, the Sassanids executed the pro-Byzantine Catholicos Babowai and enabled the Nestorian bishop of Nisibis, Barsauma, to increase his influence over the bishops of the region.

Modern research suggests that also the Church of the East in China did not teach a doctrine of two distinct natures of Christ.

<doc id="924661" wikidata="Q4034049" url="?curid=924661" title="Animerica">
<text>Animerica was a monthly magazine published by Viz Media containing news, feature articles, and reviews on manga, anime, and related media, as well as a section that serialized manga published by Viz. After an initial November 1992 preview issue, &quot;Animerica&quot; first regular issue was released in February 1993 with a March 1993 cover date. In 1998, &quot;Animerica Extra&quot; was launched as a separate manga anthology magazine which eventually focused specifically on &quot;shōjo&quot; titles. It was canceled in 2004.

Viz changed the magazine&#x27;s format in April 2005, with the new magazine being three different free publications of the same name. One is advertising-oriented and created specially for distribution at anime and manga conventions while the other is more general in scope and with a version each for distribution through Waldenbooks and Borders stores. A similar version was later added for Best Buy stores. All three versions have fewer and briefer articles and a lower page count.

&quot;Animerica&quot; was one of the first top professional anime and manga magazines released in the United States, and one of the most popular in the 1990s. In 2004, it had a circulation of 45,000 readers, but low sales and high competition from &quot;Newtype USA&quot; resulted in the essential cancellation of the original magazine and its reformatting as a free digest. One hundred copies each of the first issue of the free digest were sent to 1,000 Waldenbooks and Border stores.

==History==
&quot;Animerica&quot; was introduced in 1992 with the release of a very low print preview issue (#0 November 1992). Its first official issue followed in March 1993. With Viz&#x27;s connections to Shogakukan, the magazine was one of the first professional-quality anime and manga-oriented magazine to be released in the United States. At the magazine&#x27;s launch, it was co-edited by Seiji Horibuchi, Satoru Fujii, and Trish Ledoux. In 1998, Viz introduced a related magazine, &quot;Animerica Extra&quot;, which was its first monthly manga anthology. This secondary magazine was canceled in 2004. To celebrate the magazine&#x27;s ninth anniversary, Viz launched a redesign of the magazine starting with the November 2001 issue that included a new cover design, a new logo, and an increased focus on news, reviews, and Japanese trends. Fold-out posters were also added to every issue. During 2002 the magazine was published in a square-bound, full-colour format without a manga serial that had previously been included. By 2003, the magazine had also doubled its initial page count.

When Viz began publication of &quot;Animerica&quot;, it registered the name as a trademark. In 1997, a Japanese company named Redsun began using the domain name &quot;animerica.com&quot; to host an adult-oriented and &quot;hentai&quot; distribution website. Viz attempted to purchase the domain name from the company, but Redsun refused. Viz filed a lawsuit claiming the website infringed on its trademark. The court agreed that the website was causing confusion with Viz&#x27;s publication, but that the confusion was primarily limited to American audiences. The court refused Viz&#x27;s request that the site be shut down and its assets frozen. It did, however, require that Redsun put a disclaimer on its website and all advertising noting that it was not affiliated with the &quot;Animerica&quot; magazine nor with Viz Media and that it provide a link to Viz&#x27;s existing official website for the magazine at &quot;www.animerica-mag.com.&quot; In November 2004, Redsun&#x27;s adult website closed. Viz claimed the name in 2005, and by October the site had been relaunched as the official website of the new &quot;Animerica&quot; magazine.

===Reformatted===
In April 2005, Viz announced that the magazine would be reformatted into two different free versions, and the monthly subscription version would be discontinued. The first version, similar to the original but with a lower page count, is advertising-sponsored and produced exclusively for specific anime and manga conventions and made available at those conventions for free. The second version is a quarterly digest-sized magazine that focuses more on content and has a wider range of content versus the convention version. Termed &quot;magalogs&quot; by Viz, these digest versions are distributed freely at Borders and Waldenbooks. A third variety, specifically for Best Buy stores was later added to the line up.

The last monthly issue of the original &quot;Animerica&quot; was released with a cover date of June 2005 (Volume 13, No. 6). Subscriptions to the original magazine were replaced with subscriptions to Viz&#x27;s &quot;Shojo Beat&quot; manga anthology which was launched in July 2005.

==Features==
Each issue of the original &quot;Animerica&quot; included articles covering anime and manga releases in both the United States and Japan, interviews with industry professionals such as voice actors and directors, reviews of anime and manga series, and articles and reviews on related areas such as games, model kits, and music releases. They would also include a single chapter from a current Viz manga series. Over the course of the magazine&#x27;s history, chapters from &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Area 88&quot;, &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot;, &quot;One-Pound Gospel&quot;, and &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; appeared in it.

Final issues of the magazine still included articles on anime and manga releases, reviews of titles, and manga previews, but they were all shorter and more concise than the original. The new version had a much lower page count, leaving fewer articles in each issue.

==Circulation and reception==
&quot;Animerica&quot; was one of the most popular anime and manga magazines in North America for nearly a decade. In July 2000, &quot;Animerica&quot; was named the Best English-language publication at the Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation awards at Anime Expo. In 2004, the magazine had a circulation of 45,000, with 80% of its issues bought via newsstands rather than by subscription. This number was a drop from previous years, due to greater competition from other magazines, resulting in Viz&#x27;s changing its format. Approximately 100 copies of the first issue of the free version of &quot;Animerica&quot; were sent to 1,000 Borders and Waldenbooks stores around the United States.

<text>Elbegdorj Tsakhia (; born 30 March 1963) is a Mongolian politician and journalist who served as President of Mongolia from 2009 to 2017. He previously served as prime minister in 1998 and again from 2004 to 2006.

Elbegdorj was one of the key leaders of the 1990 Mongolian democratic revolution that ended 70 years of communist rule in Mongolia, and co-drafted the country&#x27;s 1992 constitution that guaranteed democracy and a free market economy. Elbegdorj has been labeled by his supporters as a &quot;freedom fighter&quot; and the &quot;Golden Sparrow of Democracy,&quot; alluding to a bird that comes with spring sunshine after a long, harsh winter.

Currently, Elbegdorj is a member of The Elders – established by Nelson Mandela in 2007 – that works for peace, justice, human rights and a sustainable planet. Moreover, he is a member of Club de Madrid which commits to advancing democracy worldwide. In addition, Elbegdorj is a commissioner of International Commission Against Death Penalty.
Furthermore, he is a vice chairman of International Democracy Union -an international alliance of centre right political parties. Elbegdorj is a patron of World Sustainable Development Forum. He is the Bernard and Susan Liautaud visiting fellow at Stanford University&#x27;s Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies. Elbegdorj is a president of World Mongol Federation - an international federation of Mongols around the world. 

His tenure has focused on fighting corruption, environmental protection, women&#x27;s rights, judicial reform, civic engagement, economic liberalization and privatization, property rights, and the abolition of the death penalty.

Elbegdorj is the founder of the &quot;Ardchilal&quot; (English: &quot;Democracy&quot;) newspaper – the country&#x27;s first independent newspaper – and helped to establish the first independent television station in Mongolia.

== Early life and education ==
Elbegdorj was born into a nomadic herding family in Zereg sum, Khovd province, on 30 March 1963. He was the youngest of eight sons. Elbegdorj spent most of his early childhood herding livestock through the high mountains of Zereg sum. His father, Mongolyn Tsakhia, was a veteran of Mongolia&#x27;s border conflict with the Empire of Japan that resulted in the 1939 Battle of Khalkhyn Gol. Elbegdorj finished the sum&#x27;s eight-year school (Primary &amp; middle school) in 1979. Afterwards, his family moved to Erdenet City, and he finished Erdenet&#x27;s No. 1 ten-year school (High school) in 1981.

=== Army and studies in the USSR ===
In 1981–82, Elbegdorj worked in copper ore mining and processing plant Erdenet Concern (currently Erdenet Mining Corporation) as a machinist. In 1982, he was drafted into military service. For submitting poems to the army newspaper &quot;Ulaan Od&quot; (Red Star), which impressed army authorities, and heading a Revolutionary Youth Unit in the army, he was awarded with the possibility to study military journalism and Marxism–Leninism at the USSR&#x27;s Military Political Institute (present day - Hetman Petro Sahaidachnyi National Ground Forces Academy) under the umbrella of Lviv Polytechnic National University in Lviv, Ukraine from 1983 on. He graduated from the academy in 1988 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in journalism and then began working for the newspaper &quot;Ulaan Od&quot;.

=== Harvard Kennedy School ===
After his first term as prime minister, he spent a year at the University of Colorado Boulder&#x27;s Economic Institute. Then Elbegdorj studied with a full scholarship at Harvard University and graduated from Harvard&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government with a Master of Public Administration (MPA) in 2002.

== Leading democratic movement ==
During his studies in the USSR, Elbegdorj learned about Glasnost, the concepts such as freedom of speech and economic liberties. After returning to Mongolia, he met other like-minded people and tried to present those ideas to a wider audience, despite attempts of repression from the Politburo-authority of the government, and threats by his employer to lose his job. At the end of a speech at the Young Artists&#x27; Second National Congress on 28 November 1989, Elbegdorj said that Mongolia needed democracy and appealed to youth to collaborate to create democracy in Mongolia. He told the audience &quot;We consider that Perestroika is a timely and brave step. Youth&#x27;s contribution to this revolutionary matter is not by supportive talks but by certain work. Our contribution is our objectives to be fulfilled. Our objectives are: ... following democracy and transparency and contributing to glasnost, ... and supporting fair progressive power ... These are the objectives of an initiatives&#x27; group-an organization that shall work. After the congress I hope we will gather and discuss with you about it in this (newly forming group). The organization shall be based on public, voluntary and democratic principles.&quot;

The chairman of the congress stopped Elbegdorj&#x27;s speech and warned him not to say such things. It was 1989 and Mongolia had been a communist country for 68 years. At that time, it was alleged that every other person was an unofficial communist party spy who would report people who expressed opinions other than socialism and communism. During the break of the congress, two young individuals met Elbegdorj and the three agreed to found a democratic movement and to secretly spread the news to other young people. Later the three met and united with ten other individuals and they are known as the Thirteen Leaders of Mongolia&#x27;s Democratic Revolution. On his return from Congress, his boss at the newspaper &quot;Ulaan Od&quot; warned Elbegdorj that he would be fired if he participated further in any activities out of work or engaged in any conduct inconsistent with communist and socialist ideology. Despite the warning, Elbegdorj and his friends met secretly with other young people in the circle auditorium of the National University of Mongolia and discussed democracy, free market economic policy, and other prohibited subjects of the time, and began to draft a plan to organize a democratic movement. They met many times and brought new friends and new supporters to join them secretly. One night they placed ads for their open demonstration in the streets.

On the morning of 10 December 1989, the first open pro-democracy demonstration met in front of the Youth Cultural Center in Ulaanbaatar. There, Elbegdorj announced the creation of the Mongolian Democratic Union. The Mongolian Democratic Union founders publicly petitioned the government for a real implementation of perestroika, including allowing a multi-party system, the total implementation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in all party and government affairs. In subsequent months activists led by Elbegdorj and others continued to organize demonstrations, rallies, protests and hunger strikes, as well as teachers&#x27; and workers&#x27; strikes. Activists had growing support from Mongolians, both in the capital and the countryside and the union&#x27;s activities led to other calls for democracy all over the country.

After numerous demonstrations of many thousands of people in the capital city as well as provincial centres, the Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party&#x27;s Politburo – the authority of the government – eventually gave way to the pressure and entered negotiations with the leaders of the democratic movement. Jambyn Batmönkh, chairman of Politburo of MPRP&#x27;s Central Committee decided to dissolve the Politburo and to resign on 9 March 1990. This paved the way for the first multi-party elections in Mongolia. Elbegdorj announced this news to the hunger strikers and to people who&#x27;d gathered on Sükhbaatar Square at 10 PM on that day after the negotiations between leaders of MPRP and Mongolian Democratic Union. As a result, Mongolia became the first Asia country to successfully transition from communist rule to democracy. Elbegdorj worked as the Leader of the Mongolian Democratic Union in 1989–1997.

In a documentary film about the President (titled: &quot;Man of the People&quot;) released in the year of the 25th-anniversary celebrations of the Mongolian democratic changes, President Elbegdorj tells the story of the historical political change and reinventing democracy.

== Journalism career ==
Elbegdorj worked as a correspondent at &quot;Ulaan Od&quot;-newspaper of the Mongolian Armed Forces and as a chief of an army literature unit between 1988 and 1990. While in these positions, Elbegdorj wrote articles disclosing all the good and bad in the army units and suggested improvements for the army prior to democratic movement&#x27;s beginning.

Elbegdorj founded Mongolia&#x27;s first independent newspaper &quot;Ardchilal (Democracy)&quot; and worked as its first editor-in-chief in 1990. The newspaper played a major role in completing the country&#x27;s democratic revolution. He co-introduced freedom of the press in the country by co-initiating the Law on Press Freedom and playing a key role in passing the law in 1998.

Elbegdorj also helped to create Mongolia&#x27;s first independent TV station Eagle TV in 1994. It was run by the former Mongolian Broadcasting Company, a joint venture of the U.S. Christian missionary organization AMONG Foundation, and the Mongolia Media Corporation.

== Legislative career ==
Elbegdorj was elected to the Parliament four times, in 1990, 1992, 1996 and 2008. As a Member of the People&#x27;s Congress, Elbegdorj co-drafted and co-adopted Mongolia&#x27;s new Constitution on 13 January 1992. The new Constitution guaranteed human rights, democracy, freedom of religion, and free speech. An international intellectual once referred Elbegdorj as &quot;Mongolia&#x27;s Thomas Jefferson.&quot; Elbegdorj, as the chairman of the Democratic Party, co-led the Democratic Union Coalition to its historic victory in the 1996 parliamentary elections. He served as the Majority Leader of the State Great Hural (Parliament) in 1996–2000 and as the Vice Speaker of the Parliament in 1996–1998.

Elbegdorj founded and worked as the head of Mongolia&#x27;s first Entrepreneurs Association in 1991 as well. The association helped to privatize livestock for free to their herders from the socialist collective farms. As a result, the first private property was given to almost half of Mongolia&#x27;s entire population. He supported the privatization of state-owned properties and assets and land.

While as the chairman of the State Commission on Rehabilitation, Elbegdorj initiated and brought the state to apologize for the victims and families of over 36,000 people who had been persecuted and mass massacred during the years of Mongolian People&#x27;s Party&#x27;s communist rule. He played a key role in the approval of the Rehabilitation Law, which provided rehabilitation and compensation to the survivors and families of political victims, and recovery from the Stalinist purges and prohibited future violation of human rights. In addition, the law established a Memorial Day for Political Victims.

Furthermore, Elbegdorj was a member of the National Counseling Committee of the Democratic Party in 1994–2009; leader and chairman of the Democratic Party in 1996–1999, and April 2006 – September 2008 respectively; and chairman of the Democratic Union Coalition of the Mongolian National Democratic Party and Mongolian Social Democratic Party in 1996–2000.

== Prime minister ==
Elbegdorj served as the prime minister of Mongolia twice; 1998 and 2004–2006.

=== First term as prime minister ===
In 1998, a clause in the constitution was removed that prohibited members of parliament from taking cabinet responsibility. Thus on 23 April 1998, the Parliament elected (61–6) Elbegdorj as the prime minister. During his first term, Elbegdorj attempted to solve looming economic, structural and political issues through several policy initiatives such as co-initiating Law on Press Freedom and playing a key role to pass the law in 1998. Based on this law, another law was passed that changed all daily state newspapers into public newspapers without direct control and censorship from the government.

Elbegdorj&#x27;s most significant achievement during his first term as prime minister was to collect tax and create tax income. The biggest taxpayer and only significant income contributor to the government&#x27;s budget at the time was the copper ore mining and processing Erdenet Mining Corporation(EMC) – a joint stock company owned by the governments of Mongolia and the Russian Federation. EMC hadn&#x27;t paid due tax, income and royalty to Mongolia&#x27;s government between 1997 and 1998 which resulted in the financial crumbling of the government. Because of it, previous prime minister Enkhsaikhan stepped down due to pressure from the opposition party, MPRP. After becoming prime minister, Elbegdorj ordered an audit of EMC. The audit result revealed that the state-due income did not enter the state account, instead, it went to dubious accounts of directors at EMC. This embezzlement case was reported in detail in investigative series &quot;Swindle of the Century&quot; on Eagle television. Elbegdorj dismissed the EMC&#x27;s chairman. As a result, the government began to receive due tax, royalty and income from the EMC.

In addition, at the recommendations of international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank – aid granters to Mongolia, and discount interest rate loan giver Asian Development Bank, Elbegdorj made a decision to sell state-owned Reconstruction Bank which became illiquid and was experiencing tremendous loss, the biggest financial burden to the economy since its establishment in 1997. Golomt Bank was the only one that offered to buy Reconstruction Bank.

In response to this and the change of EMC&#x27;s chairman, the minority group at the Parliament MPRP demanded Elbegdorj to resign and thus resulted Elbegdorj to lose confidence vote at the Parliament. The Parliament had prevented Elbegdorj&#x27;s government from selling the bank. Elbegdorj&#x27;s decision to sell the Reconstruction Bank was proven to be correct. The bank bankrupted soon after Elbegdorj&#x27;s first term as prime minister was over and the bankruptcy led the government to suffer a gigantic amount of financial loss. Moreover, Elbegdorj made a decision to financially assist from a tight budget to complete the construction of Mongolia&#x27;s first Wrestling Palace which was half built for a long time. He stayed in office until Janlavyn Narantsatsralt replaced him on 9 December 1998.

=== 1998–2004 ===
Elbegdorj served as the chairman of the Majority Group of the Parliament and the leader of the Democratic Union Coalition and a Member of Parliament respectively from 1996–2000.

In 2000–2001, he studied at the University of Colorado Boulder&#x27;s Economic Institute, and earned a diploma. Then he studied with a full scholarship of Harvard University at Harvard&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government and graduated with a Master of Public Administration (M.P.A.) in 2002.

Then he worked as a consultant at the Millennium Development Goal Project, United Nations Headquarters in New York City and as a consultant at Radio Free Asia in Washington, D.C. in 2002–2003. Afterwards, he returned to Mongolia and made series of public speeches touring in Mongolian provinces inspiring the people and the youth sharing his new ideas and perspectives based on his knowledge from Harvard University and the United States in combination with Mongolian way of life in 2003–2004. His lectures played a significant role to make Democratic Party get majority seats in 2004 Mongolian Parliamentary elections.

=== Second term as prime minister ===
On 20 August 2004, Elbegdorj became the prime minister of Mongolia for the second time. This time, he headed a grand coalition government after the vote in the parliamentary elections had been evenly split between the two major political forces – Democratic Coalition and the Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party.

U.S. President George W. Bush highlighted about Elbegdorj as one of the country&#x27;s democratic leaders to have been serving as the prime minister in his speech in Ulaanbaatar on 21 November 2005. &quot;The world needs more people such as yourself who are willing to admire liberty,&quot; President Bush wrote to Elbegdorj immediately after his visit to Mongolia.

During Elbegdorj&#x27;s term, on 27 January 2005, the government-controlled National State Television and Radio were converted into formally independent public organisations with increasingly smaller control by the government. Also, legal provisions that prohibited demonstrations on Ulaanbaatar&#x27;s Sükhbaatar Square were abolished on 17 November 2005.

In his second term as prime minister, Elbegdorj proclaimed a fight against corruption and poverty, which he saw as the biggest challenges to Mongolia&#x27;s economic development. Elbegdorj&#x27;s government signed the United Nations Convention Against Corruption in April 2005 and ratified it in January 2006. His administration revealed the Customs chairman&#x27;s corruption case amounting to millions of dollars from which the ex-chairman donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the MPRP in 2005.

Elbegdorj attempted to support domestic businesses by eliminating excessive regulations, many licensing requirements, and import taxes for key category products. Mongolia was accepted into the European Union&#x27;s GSP+ system, which allows Mongolian exporters to pay lower customs tariffs when exporting to the European Union during Elbegdorj&#x27;s term as prime minister.

To promote affordable computers and internet access, Elbegdorj established the Information and Communication Agency under the government. He subsidized and supported technical schools and specialized professions to reduce unemployment. By a decision of his government English replaced Russian as the first foreign language to be taught in public schools. In addition, Elbegdorj initiated the erection of the Genghis Khan memorial complex in front of Mongolia&#x27;s government house for the 800th Anniversary of the Great Mongol Empire. Besides, Elbegdorj initiated a &quot;Green Wall&quot; environmental project to plant trees in barren areas and desert zones to prevent from massive sandstorms from Mongolia reaching to North America and to reduce air pollution.

In August 2005, Elbegdorj wanted to run in by-elections in Ulaanbaatar&#x27;s Bayangol district. However, the MPRP threatened to leave the coalition if Elbegdorj ran against MPRP candidate Miyeegombyn Enkhbold, and Elbegdorj withdrew. On 13 January 2006, the MPRP left the coalition anyway, and Elbegdorj was forced to resign. The MPRP proceeded to form a new government with the help of DP defectors and independent MPs, and Miyeegombyn Enkhbold became the new prime minister. The events triggered protests from some civic groups and their followers. Mongolian economy had real GDP growth of 10.4% in 2004, 7.3% in 2005 and 8.6% in 2006 respectively during Elbegdorj&#x27;s second term as prime minister compared to 7% in 2003 prior to Elbegdorj&#x27;s government.

== 2009 presidential election ==
At the Democratic Party&#x27;s convention on 3 April 2009, Elbegdorj defeated Erdeniin Bat-Üül in a contest for the party&#x27;s nomination for the presidency of Mongolia. Elbegdorj won with 65.3% of the total vote. After Elbegdorj was announced as the candidate, the Civic Will Party and the Mongolian Green Party endorsed Elbegdorj&#x27;s presidential candidacy.

Elbegdorj won the 2009 Mongolian presidential election on 24 May 2009 with 51.21% of the votes. Defeating incumbent president Enkhbayar who got 47.41%, Elbegdorj was sworn into office as President of Mongolia on 18 June 2009.

== 2013 presidential election ==
The Democratic Party&#x27;s National Consultative Committee held its convention on 7 May 2013 and decided to re-nominate Elbegdorj as a presidential candidate with 100% votes. And the Congress of Democratic Party, with 7,000 participants in Ulaanbaatar plus participants in all provincial centers connected via live internet video conference voted 100% for Elbegdorj&#x27;s nomination from the Democratic Party for the 2013 presidential election on 8 May 2013. Civil Will-Green Party and Mongolian National Democratic Party – which have seats at both the parliament and the government cabinet – endorsed Elbegdorj&#x27;s presidential candidacy. The Republican Party and the Motherland Party expressed their full support for Elbegdorj&#x27;s candidacy also.

Elbegdorj won the 2013 Mongolian presidential election on 26 June 2013 with 50.23% of total votes while opposition Mongolian People&#x27;s Party&#x27;s candidate Badmaanyambuugiin Bat-Erdene received 41.97%, and Natsagiin Udval, candidate of Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party got 6.5% of total votes.

=== Reaction to election result ===
U.S. President Barack Obama issued a statement on the presidential election in Mongolia on 27 June 2013, the same day the election result was announced. President Obama stated: &quot;President Elbegdorj has been an important leader in advancing democracy and freedom in his country and a key partner for the United States in Asia and globally ... Through its impressive democratic achievements and its progress on economic liberalization, Mongolia serves as a significant example of positive reform and transformation for peoples around the world.&quot;

Vuk Jeremić, President of the United Nations General Assembly for the 67th session expressed satisfaction with the fair and successful election in his congratulations Elbegdorj on 27 June 2013. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon congratulated for successful presidential election in Mongolia in his congratulatory message to Elbegdorj.

European Commission President José Manuel Barroso said &quot;The European Commission considers that the presidential election has become another vital step of the Mongolian people to establish a democratic society that respects the rule of law and human rights&quot; in his congratulatory note to Elbegdorj on 28 June 2013. German Chancellor Angela Merkel pointed out &quot;The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe sent its group to Mongolia for the first time to observe the presidential election, and it was an expression of strengthening democracy and transparency in Mongolia,&quot; in her congratulations to Elbegdorj.

Elbegdorj is also the third Mongolian president to be reelected.

== Presidency ==
Elbegdorj won the Mongolian presidential elections twice: on 24 May 2009 and 26 June 2013. Elbegdorj was sworn into office on 18 June 2009 for his first term, and on 10 July 2013 for his second term as President of Mongolia. Elbegdorj is Mongolia&#x27;s first president to never have been a member of the former communist Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party and the first to obtain a Western education.
=== Inauguration ===
Elbegdorj was sworn into office for his first term as President of Mongolia in State House in front of the Parliament and guests on 18 June 2009. His inauguration ceremony included his address to the nation and a military parade on Sükhbaatar Square. The United States Senate passed Resolution Number 192 supporting Mongolia&#x27;s democracy and economic development and noting Elbegdorj&#x27;s election victory on the day he was sworn in on 18 June 2009.

For his second term as President of Mongolia, Elbegdorj was sworn into office in front of the Chinggis Khaan (also referred as Genghis Khan) monument, Nine White Banners of Mongolia, the Parliament and public on Sükhbaatar Square on 10 July 2013. This is the first time a Mongolian president made an oath in front of public in the country&#x27;s history. After making an oath, he addressed to the nation, and a military parade followed. Nobel Peace Laureate, co-founder of the Soviet bloc&#x27;s first independent trade union Solidarity, former Polish President Lech Wałęsa attended Elbegdorj&#x27;s second inauguration as president.

=== Democracy and human rights ===
==== Presidency of the Community of Democracies ====
Elbegdorj served as a chair of the Community of Democracies from 2011 to 2013, an intergovernmental coalition of democratic countries of which Mongolia is a participating member. Under his presidency, Mongolia successfully organized the VII Ministerial Conference of the Community of Democracies with democracy icon guest speakers namely chairperson of the National League for Democracy in Burma and Nobel Peace Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, &quot;Mother of the Revolution&quot; of 2011 Yemeni uprising and Nobel Peace Laureate Tawakkol Karman, Elbegdorj, Thailand&#x27;s Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and others, on 27–29 April 2013. The conference had over 1300 participants from more than 100 countries and issued Ulaanbaatar Declaration &quot;Community&#x27;s Attainments and Global Challenges.&quot;

Within the coalition, Elbegdorj led initiatives such as &quot;Zero Tolerance of Corruption&quot; and &quot;Education for Democracy&quot; and spoke on behalf of the initiatives at the 66th session of the General Assembly of the United Nations on 21 September 2011. He worked with the coalition members to form an agenda to consolidate civil society and strengthen democracy.

==== Advocating democracy and human rights ====
Elbegdorj is a frequent lecturer on democracy and human rights, both domestically and abroad. Elbegdorj said in his speech &quot;It is a human desire to live free that is an eternal power&quot; at Kim Il Sung University in North Korea. Elbegdorj remarked &quot;I truly believe in freedom for each and every individual&quot; at the Bundestag. One of his latest public speeches is &quot;Myanmar and Mongolia: On the Road to Freedom and Democracy&quot; made jointly with Nobel Peace Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi in Ulaanbaatar on 30 April 2013. Aung San Suu Kyi publicly expressed her appreciation in person to Elbegdorj for having been a strong voice in Asia for her release from house arrest in Myanmar (Burma) until her release. At the ASEM8 Summit on 3 October 2010, Elbegdorj openly called on Myanmar&#x27;s authorities to free Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest, and not long after she was released. In June 2016 President Elbegdorj visited the newly elected State Counsellor and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Aung San Suu Kyi &quot;in honor of the 60th anniversary of the diplomatic ties between Mongolia and Myanmar&quot;. During the same visit he addressed a full house audience of civil servants sharing the values of democratic societies, urging them to fight against corruption.
In 2012, following his talks at the Parliament of Kyrgyzstan and meeting with Kyrgyz NGO leaders and students to share Mongolia&#x27;s experience towards democracy for two decades, Elbegdorj began the establishment of the Democratic Transition Assistance Foundation of Mongolia. The new initiative calls for the allocation of certain funds from the Mongolian budget to be used to support democratic transitions in Kyrgyzstan and Afghanistan along with economic reforms in countries such as North Korea and Myanmar while using Mongolia&#x27;s democratic reform and consolidation as a model. In the summer of 2012, the foundation hosted several delegations from Kyrgyzstan, North Korea and Myanmar to study Mongolia&#x27;s experience of judicial reform and mineral legislation.

To encourage the adoption of democratic governance in Asian countries, Elbegdorj, along with Korean President Lee Myung Bak, started the Asian Partnership for Democracy initiative in 2011 as an arm of the Community of Democracies with a particular focus on the region in which Mongolia is one of the longest standing democracies.

Elbegdorj condemned the violence in Syria and called on world leaders to unify to end the bloodshed. He criticized the attack on the US Embassy in Libya by saying &quot;The mission of diplomacy is peaceful. Attacking diplomatic compounds are violation of both the letter and spirit of international law,&quot; in his address to the 67th session of the United Nations General Assembly on 27 September 2012. The U.S. Foreign Policy Association and the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) awarded Elbegdorj with the New York Democracy Forum&#x27;s Presidential Medal on 22 September 2011. The award recognized &quot;the vital role Elbegdorj played in Mongolia&#x27;s historic democratic revolution in 1989, the country&#x27;s successful democratic transition, the consolidation of its new democratic institutions and his solidarity with other democrats in Asia, the Middle East and other regions.&quot;

In 2000 Elbegdorj founded Mongolia&#x27;s Liberty Center, a non-governmental organization advocating human rights, freedom of expression and education. Elbegdorj spoke at many democracy conferences including &quot;Re-founding America&quot; conference sponsored by the International Society for Individual Liberty in Williamsburg, Virginia, United States in 2007 prior to his presidency.

==== Direct democracy and civic participation ====
In 2008, Elbegdorj opened the Citizens&#x27; Hall – a public hearing forum which encourages the participation of Mongolian citizens in the parliament&#x27;s decision-making. In each proceeding, citizens are given time to speak and express their opinions on pending legislation. The hall is open to any of Mongolia&#x27;s 2.9 million people and is located in Ulaanbaatar; some additional halls have been opened in other provinces. They are designed to encourage civil participation to have a consensus between legislators and citizens before any open issue becomes law.

Elbegdorj emphasized &quot;Democracy is about empowering the people and not bestowing power to someone,&quot; &quot;The time has come to transfer to the discretion of the people, to the business and professional communities especially in the countryside the power to make decisions for themselves and to engage in businesses and services they are naturally entitled to,&quot; &quot;The progress and prosperity of a civil society is defined not by centralization of power, but with transfer of rights, effective exercise of the rights by people,&quot; in his inaugural address for his first term as president.

Elbegdorj created a concept for decentralization: increasing local powers with civic participation, creating local development funds, and giving financial support to local authorities from central government budget. He submitted the concept to the Parliament to make it a part of the new Organic Budget Law and the law was passed with the part. When the bill was under discussion, the Presidential Office in collaboration with the Budget Standing Committee of the Parliament organized &quot;Empowering Local Administration with Civic Participation&quot; forum with guest speakers from Direct Democracy Center in Switzerland at Elbegdorj&#x27;s invitation on 27 May 2011. The centre&#x27;s director also lectured on &quot;Local level structure of direct democracy in Switzerland&quot; to Mongolian students. Then Elbegdorj&#x27;s office developed a policy document reflecting suggestions of citizens discussed in the Citizens&#x27; Hall and Elbegdorj issued a decree to approve &quot;Medium and long term national policy document on decentralization through direct democracy and civic participation.&quot;

Then, from 8 September 2012 through April 2013, his office jointly with local governments and parliaments organized nationwide training &quot;Direct democracy – Budget management with civic participation&quot; for ordinary citizens, civil servants and local authorities about how citizens can participate in local government budget spending from local development funds to decide life in their localities. Elbegdorj said &quot;citizen participation and monitoring are still missing in the public decision making. There cannot be a civil society without citizen participation,&quot; in his remarks at the National Diet of Japan in 2010.

==== Women&#x27;s rights ====
Elbegdorj has long been an advocate for women&#x27;s rights and more proportional representation of women in the decision-making level of governments. He stressed the importance of women in leadership, highlighting the three-fold increase of women representatives elected in the 2012 Mongolian parliamentary elections in his speech at the UN General Assembly in September 2012. &quot;We need more women leaders. Women tend to see the whole picture. For society to advance, we need more women in public service at all levels – local to global. They bring a unique perspective often missing in global challenges,&quot; Elbegdorj said &quot;Have you ever heard of a woman bloody dictator or tyrant? I think not. If there were more women in power, I think we would have more harmony, more engagement and less suffering and less conflict.&quot;

On 9 July 2011 during the meeting with Elbegdorj in Ulaanbaatar, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton praised Mongolia&#x27;s recent parliamentary elections in which nine women were elected and applauded Mongolia for its &quot;courage&quot; in building a democratic system in a country surrounded by Russia and China. &quot;Mongolia encourages women’s involvement in the political system with the intention of improving their role in society&quot; Elbegdorj said in his lecture at the Diplomatic Academy of Vietnam in November 2013. In the 2013 Mongolian presidential election, Natsagiin Udval, Mongolia&#x27;s first female presidential contender ran against Elbegdorj. Elbegdorj said &quot;Public policies on social welfare or protection should reflect kindness and tenderness of mothers,&quot; in his public lecture at Yangon University in Yangon, Myanmar.

==== Abolition of capital punishment ====
On 14 January 2010, Elbegdorj announced that he would, henceforth, systematically use his prerogative to pardon all persons sentenced to death. He stated that most countries in the world had abolished the death penalty, and Mongolia should follow their example. He suggested that capital punishment would be commuted to a thirty-year prison sentence. The decision was controversial; when Elbegdorj announced it in Parliament, MPRP representatives did not give the applause customarily due after a presidential speech. (See: Capital punishment in Mongolia)

Elbegdorj stated &quot;Capital punishment is wrong–it degrades human dignity. It brings no peace to society. It does not deter crime and does not lift up mankind,&quot; at the High-Level Meeting on the Rule of Law of the 67th session of the United Nations General Assembly on 24 September 2012. &quot;By ratifying the Second Optional Protocol Mongolia would add yet one more country in the world community to fully abolish the death penalty. Pardoning a life does not mean pardoning a penalty. The punishment for serious and cruel felonies must be severe and must be just. However, I do not think it is just to deprive any citizens of life in the name of the state. The right to life is one of the fundamental rights of a human being and cannot depend on anyone, not even on the head of state. The state should respect very fundamental human rights, and secure them by law,&quot; Elbegdorj pointed out in his greeting to the delegation of the 5th international meeting of Justice Ministers on 18 May 2010.

Four months after Elbegdorj&#x27;s announcement of a moratorium on the death penalty by his pardon, a survey was conducted among Mongolian legal academics asking whether it is right or wrong to abolish the death penalty in Mongolia. 83% of the survey participants responded that it was wrong. They criticized &quot;By pardoning death row inmates, the Mongolian President directly interferes in criminal procedures. Nobody has the right to change court rulings.&quot; According to Article 33.1.8 of the Constitution, the Mongolian president has the prerogative &quot;to grant pardon.&quot; Some academics and critics considered that it is too early and wrong to abolish death penalty in Mongolia, explaining that murder crimes are becoming too brutal and severe since the death penalty would not be implemented.

Despite much criticism from domestic conservative politicians, the opposition, and critics, Elbegdorj&#x27;s decision was positively received internationally. Amnesty International noted &quot;President Elbegdorj&#x27;s actions demonstrate commitment to the protection of human rights and set a good example for other Asian countries in the region,&quot; on 18 February 2010. International organization &quot;Hands off Cain&quot; awarded Elbegdorj with &quot;Abolitionist of the Year 2011&quot; noting Mongolia as an example that fosters the right to life among Asian countries.

Finally, in 2012, the Mongolian parliament amended a law to join the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, making Mongolia a state party to the convention and reinforcing the country&#x27;s commitment to the abolition of capital punishment.

For the 6th World Congress Against the Death Penalty in June 2016, President Elbegdorj sent a video message in which he stands up against capital punishment and shares his views and taken actions to fully abolish death penalty in Mongolia. He did share the same views during his visit to Strasbourg in 2015 addressing the European Parliament.

=== Foreign policy ===

==== Mongolia hosts 11th Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) Summit ====
 Under the leadership of Elbegdorj, Mongolia hosted the 11th Asia-Europe Summit (ASEM 11) in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia on 15 and 16 July 2016 for the first time. Leaders, heads of state, prime ministers and delegates from 51 countries, the European Commission and ASEAN participated in the summit under theme &quot;20 Years of ASEM: Partnership for the Future through Connectivity.&quot;

About foreign policy, &quot;Mongolia shall remain an active member of the international community and shall actively cooperate in addressing regional and global challenges,&quot; Elbegdorj emphasized in his inaugural address for his first term as President of Mongolia on 18 June 2009. Moreover, he noted that Mongolia shall foster and expand cooperation with the country&#x27;s two neighbours and &quot;third neighbours,&quot; in the same address. &quot;Mongolia shall consistently continue her traditional foreign policies enriched with new content and dimensions,&quot; he stated in the same speech.

To strengthen the relations with the countries of the European Union President Elbegdorj addressed the European Parliament in Strasbourg, in June 2015. In his speech, Elbegdorj defines Mongolia as a strategic anchor for the EU in the East: &quot;The EU is the world’s premier invention for advancing global prosperity, peace and harmony. Mongolia will be a strategic anchor for the EU in the East, helping advance our shared values and interests, and for building peace, democracy and engagement in Asia.&quot; In a documentary film titled &quot;Mongolia – Democratic Anchor of the East&quot; Elbegdorj was interviewed about the third-neighbour policy and foreign affairs.

Elbegdorj reiterated &quot;Mongolia shall continue her open and pro-active engagement and cooperation at the regional and international fora,&quot; &quot;Mongolia shall continue her constructive cooperation with other countries and international organizations. We shall work to promote mutually beneficial and constructive decisions in bilateral relations with our neighbours in infrastructure, investment, trade, transit transport and other pending issues,&quot; in his inaugural address for his second term as president on 10 July 2013. Elbegdorj praised the choice of the Kyrgyz people for parliamentary governance and their resolute struggle for freedom and justice in his speech at the Kyrgyz Parliament in April 2012. Following traditional friendly relations with North Korea, Elbegdorj has a good relationship with North Korea. 50,000 North Korean football fans cheered Elbegdorj in a stadium for his football kick during his official visit to North Korea in October 2013. Elbegdorj gave a lecture titled &quot;It is the human desire to live free that is an eternal power,&quot; as the first foreign Head of State to read a lecture on this topic at the Kim Il Sung University.

==== Participation in UN Peacekeeping operations ====
As commander-in-chief of the Mongolian Armed Forces, Elbegdorj supports Mongolia&#x27;s commitment and participation in United Nations Peacekeeping operations. Since 2001, Mongolian troops have participated in international peacekeeping missions in Iraq, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Congo, Eritrea, Chad, Darfur, Western Sahara, Georgia, and Afghanistan. Under Elbegdorj&#x27;s presidency, Mongolia became one of the top 20 peacekeeping contributors to the United Nations peacekeeping missions in 2009.
Elbegdorj visited South Sudan to encourage Mongolian soldiers on 15 February 2013.

&quot;Elbegdorj&#x27;s visit was the first to South Sudan by a head of state from outside Africa. His visit is also the first from a country contributing troops to the UN mission,&quot; Hiruy Amanuel, chief political affairs representative at UNMISS said. As an officer in the Mongolian Armed Forces, Elbegdorj&#x27;s son Erdene Elbegdorj participated in the United Nations peacekeeping mission in South Sudan from March to November 2013.

In addition, as an active member of the UN peacekeeping missions, &quot;Mongolia stands committed to enhancing its contribution, including through hosting training for civil police and medical personnel at its training centre,&quot; Elbegdorj stated at the General Debate of the 64th session of the United Nations General Assembly on 28 September 2009.

Analysing the role of peacekeeping in Mongolia&#x27;s military strategy, Christopher Pultz mentions in his article the related &quot;third neighbours&quot; policy of the President: &quot;Mongolia is developing a unique military strategy that attempts to balance conventional and peacekeeping capabilities. Having moved away from its previous security arrangements with Russia, Mongolia now pursues a foreign policy that will facilitate global engagement while allowing the country to maintain its sovereignty, national identity, and diplomatic freedom of maneuver through a &quot;third neighbor&quot; policy.&quot; In an interview with the President in a documentary (titled &quot;Mongolia – Democratic Anchor of the East&quot;), Elbegdorj explained the same policy in details.

==== Nuclear-free status ====
Elbegdorj has committed Mongolia to be nuclear-free and a nuclear free world as a principal component of his foreign policy agenda. The United Nations Security Council recognized Mongolia&#x27;s nuclear-weapon-free status on 17 September 2012 despite the fact that it cannot join one of the World&#x27;s Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zones, in part, because of the country&#x27;s close proximity to nuclear-armed states Russia and China. Mongolia renounced nuclear materials and became a member of Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in 2013 and UN General Assembly&#x27;s President Vuk Jeremic congratulated Elbegdorj for these.

Elbegdorj made international headlines in 2012 after being the first world leader invited to visit the Iranian nuclear facility in Natanz. After his visit, he stressed &quot;the program has to be transparent to the world; in particular, the program must be under permanent supervision of the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency. Iran&#x27;s nuclear program must not endanger or cause threat to the interests and security of regional peace as well as of any other nation. Mongolia remains committed to safeguarding her nuclear free status, supported by the special UN resolutions. Mongolia will seek to contribute to securing universal peace by fully banning nuclear weapons in East Asia and the world at large.&quot;

Opposing to storing nuclear waste in Mongolia, Elbegdorj said &quot;We ... firmly oppose to storing nuclear waste on Mongolian soil,&quot; in his speech at the High-Level Meeting on the Rule of Law of the 67th session of the United Nations General Assembly on 24 September 2012. Before, he noted it in his speech at the General Debate of the 66th session of the United Nations General Assembly on 21 September 2011.

==== Foreign investment policy ====
About foreign investment policy, Elbegdorj stated &quot;I stand open to cooperate with responsible, transparent and law-obedient investors aligned with the development interests of Mongolia,&quot; in his inaugural address for his second term as the country&#x27;s president on 10 July 2013.

Furthermore, while speaking about judicial reforms to protect domestic and foreign investors, Elbegdorj said &quot;Our goal is to change it from a system that serves those in power to one that serves the public. It is important to note that when we say &#x27;the people&#x27; we are also referring to our foreign investment partners.&quot;

The United States Senate passed Resolution Number 208 on the occasion of Elbegdorj&#x27;s visit to the United States on 15 June 2011. The resolution title is &quot;Expressing the sense of the Senate regarding Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj&#x27;s visit to Washington, D.C., and its support for the growing partnership between the United States and Mongolia.&quot; The resolution noted &quot;Whereas on May 24, 2009, the people of Mongolia completed the country&#x27;s fourth free, fair, and peaceful democratic election, which resulted in the election of opposition Democratic Party candidate Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj.&quot; The Senate&#x27;s resolution resolved &quot;It is the sense of the Senate that Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj&#x27;s historic visit to Washington, D.C. cements the growing friendship between the governments and peoples of the United States and Mongolia; the continued commitment of the Mongolian people and the Government of Mongolia to advancing democratic reforms, strengthening transparency and the rule of law, and protecting investment deserves acknowledgment and celebration.&quot;
Elbegdorj initiated and co-hosted with the World Economic Forum &quot;Fair Mineral Development&quot; roundtable in Ulaanbaatar in June 2010. It was the first multi-stakeholder meeting in the mineral resource rich country focusing on determining the key stakeholders for negotiating mineral development agreements, and decision-making authorities in the licensing negotiation process; transparency issues in the negotiation process; issues related to land tenure, royalties and taxes; reopening and renegotiation of mineral agreements; dispute resolution mechanisms; and revenue distribution, work force and community development. With the World Economic Forum, Elbegdorj co-organized second roundtable &quot;Responsible Mineral Development Initiative&quot; in the Citizens&#x27; Hall under the Office of the President of Mongolia during the Mongolia Economic Forum on 3–4 March 2011. &quot;More and more mineral development agreements are expected for Mongolia in this century,&quot; Elbegdorj noted in his opening remarks at this second roundtable. He highlighted &quot;Supporting sustainable development and making the minerals sector beneficial to the people and the country&#x27;s development, while working in good cooperation with foreign investors, and making the government&#x27;s operations transparent to the public are some of the issues of utmost concern for countries such as ours.&quot;

==== Dinosaur fossil return ====
The auction of a nearly complete dinosaur&#x27;s skeleton eight feet tall and 24 feet long rare &quot;Tarbosaurus T. bataar&quot; scavenged from Mongolia was announced at Heritage Auctions in New York City on 20 May 2012 with the asking price of one million dollars. Fossils found in Mongolia are the property of Mongolia and its people by law. Receiving a complaint from a Mongolian paleontologist, Elbegdorj promptly filed a lawsuit claiming the illegally smuggled skeleton from Mongolia in the United States Court through his American lawyer. Elbegdorj won the case with the professional help of internationally well known American and Mongolian paleontologists. The U.S. authorities handed the fossils to the Mongolian party in May 2013 after the case was resolved. The skeleton, returned to Mongolia along with other dinosaur fossils, was on public display at Sükhbaatar Square in Ulaanbaatar for a few months. This is the first lawsuit ever claimed abroad by a Mongolian president. The dinosaur fossil dealer pleaded guilty and faced a sentence of up to 17 years in prison in the USA.

=== Domestic policy ===
==== Anti-corruption ====
Elbegdorj&#x27;s presidential actions have focused on advocating anti-corruption measures. &quot;I sincerely believe that the true enemy of democracy and freedom is corruption ... The worst theft is corruption which damages people&#x27;s common rights and liberties ... I am convinced that fighting corruption must be one of the most important duties of the Mongolian State today,&quot; Elbegdorj noted. Previously, during his two terms as a prime minister, he worked to uncover and eliminate several corruption scandals including his handling of the Erdenet Mining Corporation&#x27;s embezzlement scandal in 1998, and his administration dug out the Customs chairman&#x27;s corruption case in 2005. In September 2009 Elbegdorj replaced the Community Council of Independent Authority Against Corruption (IAAC) formed by former President Nambaryn Enkhbayar which included sports and music stars and supreme clergy while expressing his dissatisfaction with its investigation of petty corruption instead of political level corruption. He then reorganized the council with professional lawyers.

To create a dialogue among different stakeholders in the natural resources and mining community to stop corruption Elbegdorj opened a roundtable in Ulaanbaatar in collaboration with the World Economic Forum&#x27;s &quot;Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI)&quot; in March 2011. The meeting brought together top executives of Mongolian industries and NGOs to discuss anti-corruption initiatives in Mongolia. Moreover, he encouraged the parliament to take actions to prevent from corruption and jointly organized with the parliament&#x27;s State Standing Committee and the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance &quot;Policy Reform and the Funding of Political Activities&quot; forum.
Elbegdorj sees Chinggis Khaan (also referred to as Genghis Khan) as a leader from whom to learn for anti-corruption efforts. He said that Genghis Khan sought equal protection under the law for all citizens regardless of status or wealth. &quot;Chinggis ... was a man who deeply realized that the justice begins and consolidates with the equality of law, and not with distinctions between people. He was a man who knew that good laws and rules lived longer than fancy palaces,&quot; Elbegdorj highlighted in his speech on the 850th anniversary of Chinggis Khaan&#x27;s birth.

&quot;The crime called corruption is committed by public servants, and not citizens,&quot; Elbegdorj pointed out at the High-Level Meeting on the Rule of Law of the 67th session of the United Nations General Assembly on 24 September 2012. &quot;Today we put an end to ... amorality. We cannot afford to let Mongolia&#x27;s future be tortured by corrupt officials for another year, another decade ... We must put an end to this,&quot; Elbegdorj pointed out in his first inaugural address. Thus under Elbegdorj&#x27;s presidency, embezzlement and corruption cases amounting from millions to hundreds of millions of dollars, ranging from misappropriation of state properties and assets such as a printing factory, buildings, funds and taxes have been tried and the courts convicted high level statesmen including a former president of Mongolia, a former chairman of Mineral Resources Authority, ex-chairmen of state owned Mongolian Airlines MIAT and their allies. In addition, big scale corruption cases involving suspects such as former health and education ministers, former deputy chairman of Tax Authority are under investigation.

Mongolia&#x27;s corruption perception ranking reduced by 26 places in one year from 2011 to 2012 comparing to the 120th place to the 94th according to Transparency International. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton applauded Elbegdorj and Mongolia on the country&#x27;s democratic progress and efforts to end corruption in her speech at the International Women&#x27;s Leadership Forum in Ulaanbaatar on 9 July 2012.

==== Judicial reform ====
By the Constitution of Mongolia, the President of Mongolia appoints the justices and judges of all levels of courts of Mongolia. Elbegdorj convened &quot;Judicial Reform and Justice&quot; Forum in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia in April 2011. Mongolian parliament passed a package law on judicial reform submitted by Elbegdorj in 2011. Those laws were designed to ensure the impartiality of judges and justices and created a merit-based system for the selection of new judges and justices. In addition, the judicial reform allows citizens&#x27; representatives to participate in court hearings and trials and requires that all judicial decisions be placed on the Internet open to the public.

==== Environmental protection ====
The United Nations Environmental Programme awarded Elbegdorj as a Champion of the Earth for his commitment to environmental protection on 4 June 2012. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon highly appreciates Elbegdorj&#x27;s contribution to the international community&#x27;s efforts for ensuring sustainable development and keeping climate change issues under control, as he emphasized in his congratulatory note to Elbegdorj for his re-election as President of Mongolia on 2 July 2013. In addition, Elbegdorj worked as a member of the World Economic Forum&#x27;s Global Agenda Council on Climate Change for the year of 2011.

Elbegdorj declared a day as Tree Planting Day by decree on 4 April 2010 and has been organizing a tree planting campaign around the country. On that day organizations and people plant trees to alleviate desertification in Mongolia. Many non-governmental organizations and social networks support Elbegdorj&#x27;s call to plant trees. He ordered schools to have environmental subjects in schools&#x27; curricula. With support from his office, students began to plant and take care of trees they planted around their schools and television serials on planting trees have been broadcast. On 14 May 2011, Tree Planting Day, Mongolians planted two million trees. The event became a tradition of planting two million trees on every Tree Planting Day annually. In addition, his policy includes an environmentally friendly policy in the mining industry.

At the invitation of Elbegdorj, the World Economic Forum-Water Resources Group and Office of the President of Mongolia co-organized the &quot;Water Secure Future in Mongolia&quot; conference in Ulaanbaatar on 3 June 2011 in which over 100 government officials, parliamentarians, civil society and private sector representatives participated to find ways to safeguard Mongolia&#x27;s scarce water resources in the context of its rapid economic growth. They discussed water use in the mining, agricultural and municipal sectors, shared case studies of international good practice for boosting water efficiency and ways of safeguarding Mongolia&#x27;s water supplies. As a result, Elbegdorj and Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, Chairman of the World Economic Forum-Water Resources Group and Member of the World Economic Forum Foundation Board, committed to forming a Mongolian Water Alliance of key government entities, civil society representatives and private sector participants to support the transformation of Mongolia&#x27;s water sector. Elbegdorj defined the purpose of the alliance by saying &quot;Managing our future water needs is key to sustaining Mongolia&#x27;s economic growth. We must ensure fast and effective implementation of our National Water Plan. We will benefit from the international networks and experience of the Water Resources Group to help us do so.&quot;

President Elbegdorj took part in the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21), in Paris, France. He delivered remarks at the Conference. Heads of State and Governments of 195 countries, and more than 50 thousand representatives of civil society and private sector have gathered for the Climate Change Conference which will be held in Le Bourget, from 30 November – 11 December 2015.

==== Smart Government ====
Elbegdorj introduced the Smart Government platform at the publicly broadcast event, &quot;From A Big Government To A Smart Government&quot; on 16 November 2013. Elbegdorj defines &quot;smart government&quot; as a combination of skilled people, technological advancements, research, and laws that all add up to creating a new mindset of how government must serve its citizens and enable (and not hinder) private sector development. The Smart Government program strives to reduce government involvement in business and economic matters, bolster property rights, modernize legal framework of the country, streamline the bureaucratic process, and combat corruption to further promote long-term sustainable growth in Mongolia. Shortly after its introduction, the Members of the Parliament of Mongolia expressed their &quot;full and unwavering support of the goal to move to a smart government.&quot;

Elbegdorj&#x27;s Smart Government Program has fifteen key initiatives as follows:
# Enhance all government systems, policies and operations in conformity with the values of democracy and principles of market economy;
# Ensure the integrity and cohesion of the state policies and actions;
# Reform the organization, operations and processes of public service and institute accountability mechanisms at every level of the government;
# Improve the capacities and efficiency of the public service;
# Eliminate government participation in business activities;
# Affirm our full and unwavering support of the goal to make political discourse immune to business influences;
# Intensify the fight against corruption;
# Support domestic industries;
# Ensure economic growth by securing property rights and supporting the private sector;
# Create government structures based on the rule of law and provide for inclusiveness, producing research-based decisions and services;
# Instill the discipline to honour/implement contracts;
# Support direct democracy, sovereignty of local governments and local development funds;
# Create a long-term national development strategy and codify it by law;
# Improve the election law;
# Introduce information technologies to streamline and modernize government.

==== Supporting education ====
On 20 May 2013, Elbegdorj issued a decree that directed the government to provide financial support to Mongolian students to study at the world&#x27;s top universities. By the implementation of the decree, Mongolian students accepted at the world&#x27;s top 20 universities will receive funding from the government regardless of their major, and those accepted at the world&#x27;s top 100 universities will be financed by the government if their major is included in the government&#x27;s preferred profession list.

Elbegdorj vetoed a section of a law amendment that would have increased his salary; in return, he submitted a bill to the Parliament to give allowance as salary from the government to all Mongolian students studying in Mongolia. The law was passed and all Mongolian students studying at any university or college in Mongolia have received monthly allowances of 70,000 tugrugs since 2011 and the allowance may be increased to 96,000 tugrugs as per government decision in September 2013.

Elbegdorj was a member of the board of directors of the &quot;Young Leader&quot; foundation of Mongolia in 1992–2009 and a member of the director&#x27;s board of the Mongolian Academy of Political Education in 1993–2009.

==== Campaign to stop alcoholism ====
Elbegdorj has been calling for a curb on the abuse of alcohol in Mongolia. Under his auspices and in collaboration with his office, civil society and non-governmental organizations organized many activities such as the Alcohol-Free Mongolia campaign, Elbegdorj banned the use of all alcoholic beverages at state dinners and state ceremonies under his name. Also he called upon government and its agencies not to serve alcohol at official ceremonies and functions. The World Health Organization awarded Elbegdorj its Regional Director&#x27;s special recognition plaque. The award honours the public health leadership of a country leader and it is the first award for alcohol control in the Western Pacific Region.

==== Naming 3 millionth citizen ====
When Mongolia&#x27;s population officially reached 3 million with the birth of a baby girl in Umnugobi province in February 2015, President Elbegdorj welcomed the news with a cheer, personally calling the parents to congratulate the new-born citizen. As a symbol of unity and harmony, Elbegdorj requested that the girl be named Mongoljin.

==Post-presidency==

On 23 September 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine and following the start of the Russian mobilization, Elbegdorj published a video address in YouTube, where he criticised the invasion and urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to &quot;stop this senseless killing and destruction.&quot; He honoured Russians protesting against their government and instructed Russian draftees not to &quot;shoot Ukrainians&quot; and &quot;kill that country&quot;. Elbegdorj also claimed that Buryats, Tuvans, and Kalmyks are &quot;used as nothing more than cannon fodder&quot;, and that Mongolia is ready to shelter refugees fleeing Russia to avoid the military draft. He praised the &quot;brave people&quot; of Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky. 

In response to Vladmir Putin&#x27;s usage of former administrative boundaries as a justification of the Russo-Ukrainian War, Elbegdorj tweeted &quot;After Putin&#x27;s talk, I found [a] Mongolian historic map&quot;, linking maps of modern-day Russia being included in the lands of the Mongol Empire. Included in his tweet was a humorous clarification that Mongolia would not invade Russia, because Mongolia is &quot;a peaceful and free nation.&quot; 
On 24 January 2023 in Washington, DC, USA, Elbegdorj participated in setting the Doomsday Clock at 90 seconds to midnight due to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine and the increased risk of nuclear escalation. The Doomsday Clock&#x27;s time is set by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists’ Science and Security Board and the Bulletin&#x27;s Board of Sponsors including 10 Nobel Laureates. Elbegdorj said: &quot;Today our world faces multiple crises. A common thread runs through them all: failure of leadership. We need a collective response rooted in the spirit and values of the UN Charter that can put us back on a pathway to peaceful co-existence and sustainable development.&quot;

On 31 August 2020, following the protests by Chinese Mongols against the Chinese authorities’ decision to replace their native Mongolian language in some school subjects with Chinese Mandarin in the Chinese autonomous region of Inner Mongolia, Elbegdorj voiced his support in media, and social media and youtube.com. and wrote a letter to Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Since stepping down from the presidency, Elbegdorj has been vocal about Mongolia&#x27;s future of democracy and a market economy.

== Family and personal life ==
Elbegdorj met Khajidsuren Bolormaa at a Mongolian students&#x27; party in Lviv, Ukraine when they were students. After their marriage in Ulaanbaatar, their first son was born in Lviv, Ukraine. They helped over 300 orphans through their Bolor Foundation. They adopted twenty children from the state-run Orphan Care Center (orphanage) in Ulaanbaatar after being the children&#x27;s patrons for some time. Now they have twenty-five children: four sons of their own and twenty-one adopted children.

 Elbegdorj became the first president to dive to the bottom of the world&#x27;s deepest lake, Baikal, in the Mir-1 mini-submersible on 16 July 2010.

Due to being president, in 2012 Elbegdorj asked his elder brother Arslandorj to give up his new position as a director of City Landscaping Department of Ulaanbaatar City though Arslandorj had worked there for more than 20 years before his brother&#x27;s presidency. Long-time Democratic Party member Arslandorj quit his career at his brother&#x27;s request. Arlsandorj is upset about stopping his professional career due to his brother&#x27;s top political position. Arslandorj said: &quot;As a brother, I followed to protect and helped Elbegdorj in difficult times, when Elbegdorj was facing life threatening risks during his co-organizing and co-leading the 1990 Mongolian democratic revolution.&quot; Arslandorj said that he would establish a private company specialized in his profession in future.

After Elbegdorj tweeted his job search in Mongolia for his eldest son Orgil (who had gotten a PhD. in medicinal chemistry from Virginia Commonwealth University in the United States), the son got a job at a private pharmaceutical company in Mongolia later. Elbegdorj&#x27;s second son Erdene works in the Mongolian Armed Forces and served in the United Nations peacekeeping mission in South Sudan from March to November 2013.

<text>Patricia &quot;Pat&quot; Christine Hodgell (born March 16, 1951) is an American fantasy writer and former academic. Hodgell taught in the English Department at University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh, but retired in 2006 to pursue a full-time writing career. She has won several awards for her works.

==Academic career==
Hodgell holds a master&#x27;s in English literature and a doctorate in 19th-century English literature, both earned at the University of Minnesota. She completed her Ph.D. and subsequent dissertation on Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; between the publication of her first two fantasy novels, &quot;God Stalk&quot; and &quot;Dark of the Moon.&quot; She is a graduate of the Clarion and the Milford Writer&#x27;s Workshops. In academia, Hodgell produced an audio-cassette-based course on science fiction and fantasy for the University of Minnesota. She taught for many years in the English Department at University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh, but retired in 2006 to pursue a full-time writing career. While at the University of Wisconsin, P. C. Hodgell divided her time between teaching and writing, with a strong emphasis on &quot;anything that stirs the imagination&quot;. This included attending science fiction conventions, and hobbies such as collecting yarn, knitting, embroidering, and raising cats.

==Writing==

Over the years, P. C. Hodgell was published by several publishing houses. Two of her more recent publishers, Hypatia Press and Meisha Merlin, went out of business, the latter in 2007, respectively, temporarily leaving her without a venue for future works. Her work was picked up by Baen in or shortly before 2010, who published the fifth &quot;Jame&quot; novel, &quot;Bound in Blood&quot;, and reissued the previous four books as a pair of omnibus editions, &quot;The God Stalker Chronicles&quot; and &quot;Seeker&#x27;s Bane&quot;. Baen has also released the novels as e-books.

===Series synopsis===
The Kencyr books, beginning with &quot;God Stalk,&quot; focus on the three peoples of the Kencyrath, Highborn (leaders), Kendar (artisans and soldiers) and Arrin-Ken (cat-like judges). They were brought together by the Three-Faced God to oppose the threat of chaos called Perimal Darkling 30,000 years before the events of the books. For eons the Kencyrath have waged a long retreat, seemingly abandoned by their god, awaiting the birth of the promised Tyr-Ridan, the three who would lead the final battle against Perimal Darkling. Three thousand years have passed since the Kencyrath retreated to Rathillien after a devastating betrayal. Much diminished, they remain outsiders to the native powers of Rathillien.

Jame (Jamethiel), a Highborn woman, flees into Rathillien after years in the Shadows of the last world to fall, her memories incomplete. Gradually discovers that her twin brother Tori, now known as Torisen Black Lord, has regained their father&#x27;s place as Highlord of the Kencyrath. She also suspects, from her connection to the destructive side of the Kencyr deity, that she may be one of the Tyr-Ridan. Her brother and her cousin Kindrie, a healer, seem likely to be the other two, representing Creation and Preservation, respectively. The Kencyrath are by no means at peace, beset by the peoples and powers of Rathillien, riven by divisions between the three people and by the political discord between the nine major Houses of the Highborn.

Behind this story is another one, the betrayal of the Kencyrath by Gerridon Highlord three thousand years earlier on another world. He and his sister, Jamethiel Dream Weaver, almost destroyed the entire Kencyr host. From his house in the Shadows of the fallen world, Gerridon and his remaining adherents scheme to maintain their immortality, having played no small role in the decline of House Knorth, of which Jame, Tori and Kindrie are the last survivors. As Tori struggles to find his place as leader of their people, Jame struggles to find a place amongst them and unravels the dark secrets of their heritage she learns Gerridon has plans for her other than as one of the Tyr-Ridan. The three young Knorths are products of Gerridon&#x27;s dealings to create a replacement for his fading sister, a new Dream Weaver to harvest more Kencyr souls to sustain him, for the Dream Weaver was Tori and Jame&#x27;s mother, while Gerridon himself sired Kindrie.

<doc id="924664" wikidata="Q3314120" url="?curid=924664" title="Galatsi Olympic Hall">
<text>The Galatsi Olympic Hall is a multi-use indoor arena that is located in Galatsi, Athens, Greece. It was the site of table tennis and rhythmic gymnastics at the 2004 Summer Olympics. The Galatsi Olympic Hall has a seating capacity of 6,200, which includes 5,141 permanent seats in the upper tier, and the removable lower tier seats.

==History==
The arena was completed in May 2004, and officially opened on July 30, 2004, shortly before the beginning of the 2004 Summer Olympic Games. After the 2004 Olympics, Galatsi Olympic Hall served as the home court of the Greek Basketball League club AEK BC, before the team moved to the larger Olympic Indoor Hall in 2006. The arena was then turned over to the private sector (Acropol Haragionis AE and Sonae Sierra SGPS S.A), and was used as a shopping center.

In autumn of 2015, the hall was used as temporary shelter for migrants.

In early 2016, the hall was used for the recording of The X Factor (Greece series 4). In 2017, it was used for the recording of The Voice of Greece (season 3), while it was also once again used for The X Factor (Greece series 5), as well as the for the live finale of Survivor Greece 5.

In autumn 2018, Galatsi Olympic Hall was re-established as &quot;Christmas Theater&quot;, where various artistic and cultural events started taking place. It has the capacity of 100.000 spectators but, due to the Sars-coV-2 pandemic, events ceased in spring 2020. For Christmas 2020, some events were scheduled online and in summer 2021 live events started anew.

<doc id="924668" wikidata="Q183156" url="?curid=924668" title="Elvis has left the building">
<text>&quot;Elvis has left the building&quot; is a phrase that was often used by public address announcers at the conclusion of Elvis Presley concerts in order to disperse audiences who lingered in hopes of an encore. It has since become a catchphrase and punchline.

== Origin ==
The phrase was first used by promoter Horace Logan on December 15, 1956, at end of Elvis’s last appearance on &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot;. In order to accommodate a larger crowd the show was moved from the Municipal Memorial Auditorium in Shreveport, Louisiana, to the then-new Hirsch Memorial Coliseum on the grounds of the Louisiana State Fair. Presley had appeared in the middle of the night&#x27;s lineup, and Logan needed to quiet the audience so that the remaining performers could play. The full quotation was:

&quot;Elvis has left the building&quot; is also heard at the end of Presley&#x27;s March 1961 Pearl Harbor Memorial benefit concert, after he exits at the end of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; and a short coda from the band.

Throughout the 1970s, the phrase was captured on record several times, spoken by Al Dvorin. In later years the phrase would be spoken by some of Presley&#x27;s backup singers to calm down the audience after concerts.

== In popular culture ==
The phrase has since become a catchphrase and punchline, used to refer to anyone who has exited in some sense (even death). For instance, it might be used when someone makes a dramatic exit from an argument, to relieve tension among those who remain. Baseball broadcasters on radio or television sometimes use the phrase as a humorous way to describe a home run, which is typically hit over the outfield fence, leaving the field of play. Other examples or variants include:
*Former Pittsburgh Penguins hockey hall-of-fame broadcaster Mike Lange used the phrase after Penguins home game wins.
*In the early part of his original heel run, WWE wrestler Shawn Michaels&#x27;s departure from the arena during live events would be announced as &quot;The Heartbreak Kid Shawn Michaels has left the building.&quot;
*&quot;Elvis Has Just Left the Building&quot; is a song by Frank Zappa, first released in 1988 on &quot;Broadway the Hard Way&quot;.
*Australian Football League commentator Dennis Cometti reversed the phrase while commentating on a skirmish between Paul Salmon and Nicky Elvis Winmar: &quot;Just as Winmar landed, big Salmon came crashing down on top of him. They&#x27;re slowly getting up, and now I can report the building has left the Elvis.&quot;
* A bonus with this name in the video game &quot;GTA 2,&quot; where the player must kill Presley lookalikes moving through the streets in a single line in less than 5 seconds to get it (the phrase is then spoken, as well as visible on the screen).
* American rapper Tyler, the Creator spoke the phrase on the track &quot;Window&quot; in his first studio album &quot;Goblin&quot;, before sounds of gunshots and screaming could be heard in the background.

<text>Penshurst Place is a historic building near Penshurst, Kent, south east of London, England. It is the ancestral home of the Sidney family, and was the birthplace of the great Elizabethan poets and courtiers, siblings Mary Sidney and Philip Sidney. The original medieval house is one of the most complete surviving examples of 14th-century domestic architecture in England. Part of the house and its gardens are open for public viewing. Many TV shows and movies have been filmed at Penshurst.

==History==

Penshurst Place was built as a hall house in 1341 for Sir John de Pulteney, a London merchant and four times Lord Mayor of London who wanted a country residence within easy distance of London. This was at the time when such properties ceased to be castles: they were more dwellings that could be defended in an emergency. When Henry IV&#x27;s third son, John, Duke of Bedford, occupied Penshurst, the second hall, known as the Buckingham Building, was built: so called after the subsequent owners, the Dukes of Buckingham. Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham was executed in 1521 by Henry VIII following a lavish feast held at Penshurst Place hosted by the Duke in honour of Henry in 1519; it then stayed in the crown estate for the rest of Henry&#x27;s reign, with documented evidence Henry used Penshurst Place as a hunting lodge and visiting with his courtier Brandon, the property being only a few miles from Hever Castle, childhood home of Henry&#x27;s second wife Anne Boleyn. 

In 1550, Henry VIII&#x27;s son, King Edward VI, granted the house and estate to Sir Ralph Fane, a supporter of Protector Somerset, but it was forfeited two years later after Sir Ralph was executed for treason.

===Sidney family===

Penshurst Place was enlarged after 1552 when King Edward VI granted the house to Sir William Sidney (1482–1554), who had been a courtier to the King&#x27;s father, Henry VIII. Sir William&#x27;s son Henry (1529–1586) married Lady Mary Dudley, whose family became implicated in the Lady Jane Grey affair, although Henry himself escaped any such implications. During his lifetime he added apartments and the &quot;King&#x27;s Tower&quot; to Penshurst. He employed a joiner Evan Lucas to supply panelling and carve ornaments including leopard&#x27;s heads for the hall and gallery. Henry Sidney also created what is now one of England&#x27;s oldest private gardens, with records going back to 1346.

Philip Sidney (1554–1586), Henry&#x27;s son, was born at Penshurst Place in 1554. Poet and courtier, he was buried in Old St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London, having died twenty-five days after a bullet wound to the thigh at the battle of Zutphen; his tomb was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666.

Philip&#x27;s brother Robert Sidney inherited Penshurst. His time there resulted in more additions to the state rooms, including an impressive &quot;Long Gallery&quot;. He had also inherited the Earldom of Leicester, and his descendants for the next seven generations continued to live at the mansion.

=== Restoration ===
By the 19th century, the building was falling into disrepair, but a new occupant in 1818, Sir John Shelley-Sidney, uncle of Percy Bysshe Shelley, gained ownership of the property. He began to restore the building with architect J. Rebecca. 

His son Philip Sidney, 1st Lord De L&#x27;Isle and Dudley, continued the restoration. Under Philip&#x27;s care, a stable wing was constructed, which currently houses a Toy Museum.

=== Opening to the public ===
The 5th Baron, William Sidney (1909–1991), inherited Penshurst Place in 1945. He was one of only two men who held both the Victoria Cross and membership of the Order of the Garter; he was created 1st Viscount De L&#x27;Isle in 1956. Much of the modern restoration of Penshurst is due to him and to his son, the 2nd Viscount; it had suffered neglect during World War I. Penshurst Place opened to the public in 1946 to help offset the cost of wartime damages.

Many members of the family are buried or commemorated in the Sidney Chapel at St John the Baptist, Penshurst.

==Main features of the house==

It is possible to see in the house the evidence of occupation over its 670-year history:
*The State Rooms, filled with a collection acquired by generations of the Sidney family.
*The West Solar, or State Dining Room, part of the medieval building, contains a collection of family portraits, furniture and porcelain.
*The Queen Elizabeth Room, named after Queen Elizabeth I, with its display of early upholstered furniture.
*The Tapestry Room
*The Long Gallery, full of royal and family portraits
*The Nether Gallery: with an array of arms and armour
*Toy Museum – features toys from several generations of the Sidney family, includes dolls, doll houses, teddies, toy soldiers, mechanical toys and general play items
*Queen Victoria&#x27;s stool: in one of the smallest rooms of the house, there is a green stool on display. Queen Victoria sat on this stool when she was pronounced Empress of India in 1876.

=== Sidney Oak ===
One notable element of the property was the Sidney Oak tree, estimated to have grown for more than 1000 years. It died in 2016 and was commemorated with a plaque on the property in 2017. It was listed as one of Britain&#x27;s 50 Great Trees during Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Golden Jubilee. An oil painting depicting the tree and the Penhurst property was gifted to the Victoria &amp; Albert museum in 1857, where it is still housed.

==Filming location==

Penshurst has been used as a filming location, including: &quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot;; the 1971 BBC series &quot;Elizabeth R&quot;; the 1992 television series &quot;Covington Cross&quot;; &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot;; &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;; the BBC TV show &quot;Merlin&quot;; &quot;The Hollow Crown&quot;; and the BBC’s 2015 series &quot;Wolf Hall&quot;.

<doc id="924687" wikidata="Q949033" url="?curid=924687" title="Predatory lending">
<text>Predatory lending refers to unethical practices conducted by lending organizations during a loan origination process that are unfair, deceptive, or fraudulent. While there are no internationally agreed legal definitions for predatory lending, a 2006 audit report from the office of inspector general of the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) broadly defines predatory lending as &quot;imposing unfair and abusive loan terms on borrowers&quot;, though &quot;unfair&quot; and &quot;abusive&quot; were not specifically defined. Though there are laws against some of the specific practices commonly identified as predatory, various federal agencies use the phrase as a catch-all term for many specific illegal activities in the loan industry. Predatory lending should not be confused with predatory mortgage servicing which is mortgage practices described by critics as unfair, deceptive, or fraudulent practices during the loan or mortgage servicing process, post loan origination.

One less contentious definition of the term is proposed by an investing website as &quot;the practice of a lender deceptively convincing borrowers to agree to unfair and abusive loan terms, or systematically violating those terms in ways that make it difficult for the borrower to defend against&quot;. Other types of lending sometimes also referred to as predatory include payday loans, certain types of credit cards, mainly subprime, or other forms of (again, often subprime) consumer debt, and overdraft loans, when the interest rates are considered unreasonably high.
Although predatory lenders are most likely to target the less educated, the poor, racial minorities, and the elderly, victims of predatory lending are represented across all demographics. The continued occurrence of predatory lending can be viewed as a litmus test for the effectiveness of philanthropic lending that aims to foster entrepreneurship. Where such philanthropic lending initiatives (microfinance) are widely available, loan sharks and other predatory lenders should not continue to thrive.

Predatory lending typically occurs on loans backed by some kind of collateral, such as a car or house, so that if the borrower defaults on the loan, the lender can repossess or foreclose and profit by selling the repossessed or foreclosed property. Lenders may be accused of tricking a borrower into believing that an interest rate is lower than it actually is, or that the borrower&#x27;s ability to pay is greater than it actually is. The lender, or others as agents of the lender, may well profit from repossession or foreclosure upon the collateral.

Predatory lending is often compared to (but not to be confused with) loan sharking; however, a key difference between the two is that loan sharks do not seriously attempt to operate within the law.

==Abusive or unfair lending practices==
There are many lending practices which have been called abusive and labeled with the term &quot;predatory lending&quot;. There is a great deal of dispute between lenders and consumer groups as to what exactly constitutes &quot;unfair&quot; or &quot;predatory&quot; practices, but the following are sometimes cited:
* Unjustified risk-based pricing. This is the practice of charging more (in the form of higher interest rates and fees) for extending credit to borrowers identified by the lender as posing a greater credit risk. The lending industry argues that risk-based pricing is a legitimate practice; since a greater percentage of loans made to less creditworthy borrowers can be expected to go into default, higher prices are necessary to obtain the same yield on the portfolio as a whole. Some consumer groups argue that higher prices paid by more vulnerable consumers cannot always be justified by increased credit risk.
* Single-premium credit insurance. This is the purchase of insurance which will pay off the loan in case the homebuyer dies. It is more expensive than other forms of insurance because it does not involve any medical checkups, but customers almost always are not shown their choices, because usually the lender is not licensed to sell other forms of insurance. In addition, this insurance is usually financed into the loan which causes the loan to be more expensive, but at the same time encourages people to buy the insurance because they do not have to pay up front.
* Failure to present the loan price as negotiable. Many lenders will negotiate the price structure of the loan with borrowers. In some situations, borrowers can even negotiate an outright reduction in the interest rate or other charges on the loan. Consumer advocates argue that borrowers, especially unsophisticated borrowers, are not aware of their ability to negotiate and might even be under the mistaken impression that the lender is placing the borrower&#x27;s interests above its own. Thus, many borrowers do not take advantage of their ability to negotiate.
* Failure to clearly and accurately disclose terms and conditions, particularly in cases where an unsophisticated borrower is involved. Mortgage loans are complex transactions involving multiple parties and dozens of pages of legal documents. In the most egregious of predatory cases, lenders or brokers have not only misled borrowers but have also altered documents after they have been signed.
* Short-term loans with disproportionally high fees, such as payday loans, credit card late fees, checking account overdraft fees, and Tax Refund Anticipation Loans, where the fee paid for advancing the money for a short period of time works out to an annual interest rate significantly in excess of the market rate for high-risk loans. The originators of such loans dispute that the fees are interest.
* Servicing agent and securitization abuses. The mortgage servicing agent is the entity that receives the mortgage payment, maintains the payment records, provides borrowers with account statements, imposes late charges when the payment is late, and pursues delinquent borrowers. A securitization is a financial transaction in which assets, especially debt instruments, are pooled and securities representing interests in the pool are issued. Most loans are subject to being bundled and sold, and the rights to act as servicing agent sold, without the consent of the borrower. A federal statute requires notice to the borrower of a change in servicing agent, but does not protect the borrower from being held delinquent on the note for payments made to the servicing agent who fails to forward the payments to the owner of the note, especially if that servicing agent goes bankrupt, and borrowers who have made all payments on time can find themselves being foreclosed on and becoming unsecured creditors of the servicing agent. Foreclosures can sometimes be conducted without proper notice to the borrower. In some states (see Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 746), there is no defense against eviction, forcing the borrower to move and incur the expense of hiring a lawyer and finding another place to live while litigating the claim of the &quot;new owner&quot; to own the house, especially after it is resold one or more times. When the debtor demands, under the best evidence rule, that the current claimed note owner produce the original note with the debtor&#x27;s signature on it, the note owner typically is unable or unwilling to do so, and tries to establish his or her claim with an affidavit that it is the owner, without proving it is the &quot;holder in due course&quot;, the traditional standard for a debt claim, and the courts often allow them to do that. In the meantime, the note continues to be traded, its physical whereabouts difficult to discover.

OCC Advisory Letter AL 2003-2 describes predatory lending as including the following:
* Loan &quot;flipping&quot; – frequent refinancings that result in little or no economic benefit to the borrower and are undertaken with the primary or sole objective of generating additional loan fees, prepayment penalties, and fees from the financing of credit-related products;
* Refinancings of special subsidized mortgages that result in the loss of beneficial loan terms;
* &quot;Packing&quot; of excessive and sometimes &quot;hidden&quot; fees in the amount financed;
* Using loan terms or structures – such as negative amortization – to make it more difficult or impossible for borrowers to reduce or repay their indebtedness;
* Using balloon payments to conceal the true burden of the financing and to force borrowers into costly refinancing transactions or foreclosures;
* Targeting inappropriate or excessively expensive credit products to older borrowers, to persons who are not financially sophisticated or who may be otherwise vulnerable to abusive practices, and to persons who could qualify for mainstream credit products and terms;
* Inadequate disclosure of the true costs, risks and, where necessary, appropriateness to the borrower of loan transactions;
* The offering of single premium credit life insurance; and
* The use of mandatory arbitration clauses.

== Predatory lending towards minority groups ==
Because many minority communities have been excluded from loans in the past, they are and have been more vulnerable to deception. Oftentimes, they are targeted because of these vulnerabilities. Organizations and agencies including ACORN, HUD, the American Civil Liberties Union, United for a Fair Economy and more prove that predatory loans are disproportionately made in poor and minority neighborhoods. Brokers and lenders preyed on these neighborhoods with the knowledge that these people were often denied for loans and the demand for loans were high. Lenders called these neighborhoods never-never land. This created the subprime predatory lending world.

Subprime lenders specialize in B, C, and D paper. Predatory lending is the practice of overcharging a borrower for rates and fees, average fee should be 1%, these lenders were charging borrowers over 5%.

Consumers without challenged credit loans should be underwritten with prime lenders. In 2004, 69% of borrowers were from subprime lending. The 2007 mortgage drop and economy fail were from over lending.

Organizations such as AARP, Inner City Press, and ACORN have worked to stop what they describe as predatory lending. ACORN has targeted specific companies such as HSBC Finance, successfully forcing them to change their practices.

Some subprime lending practices have raised concerns about mortgage discrimination on the basis of race. African Americans and other minorities are being disproportionately led to sub-prime mortgages with higher interest rates than their white counterparts. Even when median income levels were comparable, home buyers in minority neighborhoods were more likely to get a loan from a subprime lender, though not necessarily a sub-prime loan.

== Other targeted groups ==
In addition, studies by leading consumer groups have concluded that women have become a key component to the subprime mortgage crunch. Professor Anita F. Hill wrote that a large percentage of first-time home buyers were women, and that loan officers took advantage of the lack of financial knowledge of many female loan applicants.
Consumers believe that they are protected by consumer protection laws, when their lender is really operating wholly outside the laws. Refer to 15 U.S.C. 1601 and 12 C.F.R. 226.

Media investigations have disclosed that mortgage lenders used bait-and-switch salesmanship and fraud to take advantage of borrowers during the home-loan boom. In February 2005, for example, reporters Michael Hudson and Scott Reckard broke a story in the Los Angeles Times about &quot;boiler room&quot; sales tactics at Ameriquest Mortgage, the nation&#x27;s largest subprime lender. Hudson and Reckard cited interviews and court statements by 32 former Ameriquest employees who said the company had abused its customers and broken the law, &quot;deceiving borrowers about the terms of their loans, forging documents, falsifying appraisals and fabricating borrowers&#x27; income to qualify them for loans they couldn&#x27;t afford&quot;. Ameriquest later agreed to pay a $325 million (~$ in ) predatory lending settlement with state authorities across the nation.

==Disputes over predatory lending==
Some subprime lending advocates, such as the National Home Equity Mortgage Association (NHEMA), say many practices commonly called &quot;predatory,&quot; particularly the practice of risk-based pricing, are not actually predatory, and that many laws aimed at reducing &quot;predatory lending&quot; significantly restrict the availability of mortgage finance to lower-income borrowers. Such parties consider &quot;predatory lending&quot; a pejorative term.

==Underlying issues==
There are many underlying issues in the predatory lending debate:
* Judicial practices: Some argue that much of the problem arises from a tendency of the courts to favor lenders, and to shift the burden of proof of compliance with the terms of the debt instrument to the debtor. According to this argument, it should not be the duty of the borrower to make sure his or her payments are getting to the current note-owner, but to make evidence that all payments were made to the last known agent for collection sufficient to block or reverse repossession or foreclosure, and eviction, and to cancel the debt if the current note owner cannot prove he or she is the &quot;holder in due course&quot; by producing the actual original debt instrument in court. 
* Risk-based pricing: The basic idea is that borrowers who are thought of as more likely to default on their loans should pay higher interest rates and finance charges to compensate lenders for the increased risk. In essence, high returns motivate lenders to lend to a group they might not otherwise lend to – &quot;subprime&quot; or risky borrowers. Advocates of this system believe that it would be unfair – or a poor business strategy – to raise interest rates globally to accommodate risky borrowers, thus penalizing low-risk borrowers who are unlikely to default. Opponents argue that the practice tends to disproportionately create capital gains for the affluent while oppressing working-class borrowers with modest financial resources. Some people consider risk-based pricing to be unfair in principle. Lenders contend that interest rates are generally set fairly considering the risk that the lender assumes, and that competition between lenders will ensure availability of appropriately-priced loans to high-risk customers. Still others feel that while the rates themselves may be justifiable with respect to the risks, it is irresponsible for lenders to encourage or allow borrowers with credit problems to take out high-priced loans. For all of its pros and cons, risk-based pricing remains a universal practice in bond markets and the insurance industry, and it is implied in the stock market and in many other open-market venues; it is only controversial in the case of consumer loans. 
* Competition: Some believe that risk-based pricing is fair but feel that many loans charge prices far above the risk, using the risk as an excuse to overcharge. These criticisms are not levied on all products, but only on those specifically deemed predatory. Proponents counter that competition among lenders should prevent or reduce overcharging.
* Financial education: Many observers feel that competition in the markets served by what critics describe as &quot;predatory lenders&quot; is not affected by price because the targeted consumers are completely uneducated about the time value of money and the concept of Annual percentage rate, a different measure of price than what many are used to. Recent research looked at a legislative experiment in which the State of Illinois, which required “high-risk” mortgage applicants acquiring or refinancing properties in 10 specific zip codes to submit loan offers from state-licensed lenders to review by HUD-certified financial counselors. The experiment found that the legislation pushed some borrowers to choose less risky loan products in order to avoid counseling.
* Caveat emptor: There is an underlying debate about whether a lender should be allowed to charge whatever it wants for a service, even if there is no evidence that it attempted to deceive the consumer about the price. At issue here is the belief that lending is a commodity and that the lending community has an almost fiduciary duty to advise the borrower that funds can be obtained more cheaply. Also at issue are certain financial products which appear to be profitable only due to adverse selection or a lack of knowledge on the part of the customers relative to the lenders. For example, some people allege that credit insurance would not be profitable to lending companies if only those customers who had the right &quot;fit&quot; for the product actually bought it (i.e., only those customers who were not able to get the generally cheaper term life insurance). Regardless, the majority of U.S. courts have refused to treat the lender-borrower relationship as a fiduciary one and declined to impose a duty of care upon lenders in the making of loans. Thus, once the lender has complied with all relevant statutory disclosure obligations, it remains solely the borrower&#x27;s problem to ascertain whether the loan they are getting is the right fit for them.

==Predatory borrowing==
In an article in the January 17, 2008, &quot;New York Times&quot;, George Mason University economics professor Tyler Cowen described &quot;predatory borrowing&quot; as potentially a larger problem than predatory lending:As much as 70 percent of recent early payment defaults had fraudulent misrepresentations on their original loan applications, according to one recent study. The research was done by BasePoint Analytics, which helps banks and lenders identify fraudulent transactions; the study looked at more than three million loans from 1997 to 2006, with a majority from 2005 to 2006. Applications with misrepresentations were also five times as likely to go into default. Many of the frauds were simple rather than ingenious. In some cases, borrowers who were asked to state their incomes just lied, sometimes reporting five times actual income; other borrowers falsified income documents by using computers.Mortgage applications are usually completed by mortgage brokers or lenders&#x27; in-house loan officers, rather than by borrowers themselves, making it difficult for borrowers to control the information that was submitted with their applications.

A stated income loan application is done by the borrower, and no proof of income is needed. When the broker files the loan, they have to go by whatever income is stated. This opened the doors for borrowers to be approved for loans that they otherwise would not qualify for, or afford. However, lawsuits and testimony from former industry insiders indicated that mortgage company employees frequently were behind overstatements of borrower income on mortgage applications.

Borrowers had little or no ability to manipulate other key data points that were frequently falsified during the mortgage process. These included credit scores, home appraisals and loan-to-value ratios. These were all factors that were under the control of mortgage professionals. In 2012, for example, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman reached a $7.8 million (~$ in ) settlement of allegations that a leading appraisal management firm had helped inflate real estate appraisals on a wide scale basis in order to help a major lender push through more loan deals. The attorney general office&#x27;s lawsuit alleged that eAppraiseIT, which did more than 260,000 appraisals nationally for Washington Mutual, caved to pressure from WaMu loan officers to select pliable appraisers who were willing to submit inflated property valuations.

Several commentators have dismissed the notion of &quot;predatory borrowing&quot;, accusing those making this argument as being apologists for the lack of lending standards and other excesses during the credit bubble.

Predatory servicing is also a component of predatory lending, characterized by unfair, deceptive, or fraudulent practices by a lender or another company that services a loan on behalf of the lender, after the loan is granted. Those practices include also charging excessive and unsubstantiated fees and expenses for servicing the loan, wrongfully disclosing credit defaults by a borrower, harassing a borrower for repayment and refusing to act in good faith in working with a borrower to effectuate a mortgage modification as required by federal law.

==Legislation==
In many countries, legislation aims to control this, but research has found ambiguous results, including finding that high-cost mortgage applications can possibly rise after adoption of laws against predatory lending.

===United States===
Many laws at both the Federal and state government level are aimed at preventing predatory lending. Although not specifically anti-predatory in nature, the Federal Truth in Lending Act requires certain disclosures of APR and loan terms. Also, in 1994, section 32 of the Truth in Lending Act, entitled the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994, was created. This law is devoted to identifying certain high-cost, potentially predatory mortgage loans and reining in their terms. Twenty-five states have passed anti-predatory lending laws. Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, North Carolina, New York, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Carolina are among those states considered to have the strongest laws. Other states with predatory lending laws include: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Wisconsin, and West Virginia. These laws usually describe one or more classes of &quot;high-cost&quot; or &quot;covered&quot; loans, which are defined by the fees charged to the borrower at origination or the APR. While lenders are not prohibited from making &quot;high-cost&quot; or &quot;covered&quot; loans, a number of additional restrictions are placed on these loans, and the penalties for noncompliance can be substantial.

A graduate of the Universidad Central de Venezuela, Chaderton is one of the most experienced members of the Venezuelan diplomatic corps. He was foreign minister from May 2002 to July 2004 in the government of Hugo Chávez.

Chaderton is a senior member of the Venezuelan Diplomatic Service. He served in Poland, Germany, Belgium and the Permanent Mission of Venezuela to the United Nations. He was Ambassador to Gabon from 1985 to 1987; Ambassador to Norway from 1987 to 1990; director general of international policy from 1990 to 1993; Ambassador to Canada from 1993 to 1994; Vice Minister of Foreign Relations from 1994 to 1995; Ambassador to the United Kingdom from 1996 to 2000; Ambassador to Colombia from 2001 to 2002; Minister of Foreign Relations from 2002 to 2004; Ambassador to France from 2004 to 2007; Ambassador to Mexico and Ambassador Permanent Representative to the Organization of American States (OAS) from 2008 to 2015.

In 2015, the group Venezuelans Persecuted in Exile (Veppex) in Miami asked the Secretary General of the Organization of American States José Miguel Insulza to sanction Roy Chaderton, then ambassador to the organization, for a controversial statement made during an interview on the program of the state-owned Venezolana de Televisión. Veppex highlighted in a statement that the description made by the ambassador was &quot;a comparison that incites violence&quot;. Chaderton apologized for his comment saying that his statements were taken out of context, and that what he was trying to warn was that in the face of an &quot;invasion by the United States&quot; there would be no distinction between Chavistas and opponents.

Canada sanctioned 40 Venezuelan officials, including Chaderton, in September 2017. The sanctions were for behaviors that undermined democracy after at least 125 people were killed in the 2017 Venezuelan protests and &quot;in response to the government of Venezuela&#x27;s deepening descent into dictatorship&quot;; Chrystia Freeland, Foreign Minister said, &quot;Canada will not stand by silently as the government of Venezuela robs its people of their fundamental democratic rights&quot;.

<doc id="924703" wikidata="Q2055606" url="?curid=924703" title="Luis Ernesto Derbez">
<text>Luis Ernesto Derbez Bautista (born April 1, 1947, in Mexico City) is a Mexican politician and rector of the Universidad de las Américas Puebla (UDLAP). He served as Mexico&#x27;s Secretary of Economy from 2000 to 2002 and Secretary of Foreign Affairs from 2003 to 2006.

== Early life and education ==
Luis Ernesto Derbez Bautista was born April 1, 1947, in Mexico City, Mexico. His parents were small business owners that ran a clothing factory that employed 20 workers. He has a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1970 in economics, from the Universidad Autónoma de San Luis Potosí, in San Luis Potosí City. He studied at the University of Oregon and has a Master&#x27;s degree in economics. He earned a Doctorate in economics in 1980 from the Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa. After graduating in 1980, Derbez was appointed vice rector for academics at the Universidad de las Américas Puebla in Puebla, Mexico.

Before joining the Fox campaign in 1997, he worked 14 years for the World Bank, managing economic adjustment programs in Africa, Asia and Central America. He also was a visiting professor at the Johns Hopkins University, within the School of Advanced International Studies. He began his career in politics in 2000.

== Political career ==

=== Secretary of Economy ===
Upon assuming power in December 2000, President Vicente Fox chose him to serve as his Secretary of Economy. As Minister of Economy, Derbez was in charge of Mexico&#x27;s international trade negotiations. In 2001, he finalized the trade agreement between China and Mexico which allowed China&#x27;s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), and led the Mexican team which defined the terms for a Free Trade Agreement between Mexico and Japan; in 2004 the FTA was signed. At the 2001 WTO&#x27;s Ministerial Meetings in Qatar he was a member of the Director&#x27;s Team which successfully negotiated the start of the Doha Development Round.

Following his participation, Derbez became the Chairman-elect for WTO&#x27;s 2003 Ministerial Meeting. As such, during 2002 and 2003 he co-chaired preparatory Ministerial Meetings in Mexico, Sydney, Geneva, Sharm-el-Sheik, and Paris. In September 2003, Derbez chaired the WTO Ministerial Meeting which produced the so named Cancun Text that served as the basic text for follow up negotiations at the 2005 WTO&#x27;s Hong Kong Ministerial Meeting. During that period, Derbez also played a key role in the successful outcome of the U.N. International Conference on Financing for Development held in Monterrey, Mexico, where developed nations agreed to contribute 0.7% of its GDP in development aid by the year 2015. Derbez also chaired the 2002 APEC Meeting in Los Cabos, Baja California.

In domestic issues, as Minister of Economy, Derbez proposed ten industrial policy programs for key sectors of the Mexican economy. By 2005, over $10 billion in new investments were attracted by those programs in the automotive, electronics, and maquiladora industries, allowing the nation to regain some of its presence in world markets despite the failure to reach structural economic reforms sought by the Fox government. He also created the Undersecretariat for Medium and Small Enterprises, and launched the successful Microcredit program PRONAFIM, which by 2005 had financed over 1.5 million microcredits.

=== Secretary of Foreign Affairs ===
In January 2003, following the resignation of Jorge Castañeda, Derbez took over as Secretary of Foreign Affairs, a position that he held until President Vicente Fox&#x27;s term ended on December 1, 2006. As Minister of Foreign Affairs, Derbez has strengthened Mexico&#x27;s bilateral and multilateral relations with the USA and Canada. Today, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is a key player in the negotiations to improve NAFTA. Its work has led to a program entitled Security and Prosperity Agreement (ASPAN for its acronym in Spanish), launched in 2003 in Waco, Texas, by the three leaders of the North American countries. One of the major results of ASPAN was the constitution of a private-public Competitiveness Council which is defining sector specific policies to standardize the region&#x27;s economic environment. Derbez has also played a key role in shaping the migration reform debate in the US by organizing and leading a group of 10 Latin American countries (from Mexico to Ecuador), which has presented a common position in discussions with key Senators and Representatives of the US Congress.

Reversing a 15-year trend, Derbez has refocused Mexico&#x27;s policy towards Latin America. At the sub-regional level, increased cooperation with the seven Central American countries has resulted in the creation of the Mesoamerican Group, which currently defines common sub-regional policies in energy development, border security, fight against organized crime, and regional infrastructure. Under Derbez&#x27;s leadership, Mexico gained associated status in the Andean Countries Group and MERCOSUR, while at the same time signed a strategic, political, and economic alliance with Chile. On the other hand, he gave high priority to the Asia Pacific region. In addition to the FTA with Japan, Mexico created a Ministerial Level Commission with China, the only one of this kind that China has. Under his leadership, Mexico initiated negotiations agreements with India&#x27;s government in the technology and pharmaceutical sectors.

While representing Mexico at the UN Security Council during the Iraq crisis, Derbez realized that a major overhaul of the UN system was required. In 2004, Mexico invited 15 nations to form a group called Friends of the Reform, to propose administrative and organizational changes for the UN. He also organized another 16 nations into a group named United for a Consensus, to propose reforms to the UN Security Council. The proposals of both groups played a major role in the reform decisions approved by the UN Assembly in September 2005.

Since January 2007, Luis Ernesto Derbez has been the General Director of the Centre for Globalization, Competitiveness and Democracy at the Instituto Tecnológico de Monterrey, Campus Santa Fe, and Secretary for International Affairs of the PAN. Between January 2003 and December 2006, he was the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Mexico; and between December 2000 and December 2002, he was the Minister of Economy. From July to November 2000, he chaired President-elect Vicente Fox transition team, which defined Mexico&#x27;s 2000-2006 economic and social programs.

==Awards and memberships==
Derbez was a member of the Board of Directors of PEMEX and Pemex International (PMI), Banco Nacional de Comercio Exterior (Bancomext), and Mexico&#x27;s Science and Technology Council (CONACYT). In 2001 and 2002, he was Chairman of the Board for Exportadora de Sal, S.A. and Transportes de Sal, S.A., joint ventures between the Mexican Government and the Mitsubishi Corporation.

He was granted by Iowa State University the Distinguished Achievement Alumni Award in 2006, the first time ever given to a non-US national.

== Personal life ==
Derbez is married and has 2 daughters.
He has published many articles and book chapters, and has lectured extensively in many countries. He speaks fluently Spanish, English and French. Derbez is a member of Sigma Xi and Phi Kappa Phi.

<doc id="924712" wikidata="Q435200" url="?curid=924712" title="Mircea Geoană">
<text>Dan Mircea Geoană (; born 14 July 1958) is a Romanian politician and diplomat, who served as the deputy secretary general of NATO between 2019 and 2024. He previously served as president of the Senate of Romania from December 2008 until he was revoked in November 2011. From April 2005 until February 2010, he was the head of the Social Democratic Party (PSD, ).

Geoană was the candidate of the party for the position of President of Romania in the 2009 presidential election which he narrowly lost to Traian Băsescu. He was dismissed from PSD on 22 November 2011 but rejoined the party in late 2012. From 2015 to 2018, he was the founder and leader of the Romanian Social Party. Additionally, he was also the president of Aspen Institute Romania, which is an apolitical and non-profit organisation. 

On 17 July 2019, he was appointed deputy secretary general of NATO, replacing Rose Gottemoeller and assisted Jens Stoltenberg as No. 2 and Chairman of NATO&#x27;s Innovation Committee, during a mandate marked in particular by the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

He resigned 3 September 2024 to run for President of Romania in the election later that year, where he finished in sixth place.

== Early life and career ==

Mircea Geoană was born in Bucharest, on 14 July 1958. His father, Ioan Geoană, was a general in the Romanian Army from 1965 to 1992 and was head of the Civil Defense Command. He was among the defendants of the investigation into the Romanian Revolution of 1989. His mother, Elena Iuliana Geoană, was an engineer at ITB. Mircea Geoană grew up in the Cișmigiu and neighborhoods of Bucharest.

=== Education ===
He graduated from Saint Sava High School in Bucharest in 1977, where he followed the real profile. Then he attended the Faculty of Mechanics at the Bucharest Polytechnic Institute, as well as the Faculty of Law at the University of Bucharest. He attended the École nationale d&#x27;administration in Paris in 1992, as well as the course on Democratic Institutions of NATO.

Geoană obtained his PhD in world economy from the Academy of Economic Studies in Bucharest on 18 July 2005. According to an analysis by investigative journalist , Geoană&#x27;s 279-page thesis contains significant plagiarism, with 21 graphs and ten tables copied from other sources without proper attribution, and 72 pages with text content plagiarised from United States (US) presidential reports from 1999, 2002, and 2003. According to Șercan, there are 36 citations in the thesis, but 81 works listed in the bibliography. Geoană responded to the analysis, stating, &quot;there were things we mentioned ... I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m telling you that what I did with my doctoral thesis was done absolutely honestly and I don&#x27;t feel anything outside the rules of that time. Now ... if the rules have changed in the meantime, that&#x27;s something else.&quot; According to the ASE Ethics Committee, Mircea Geoana plagiarised only 43 lines and two tables, a decision that Emilia Sercan criticised.

During the period in which he was Romania&#x27;s ambassador to Washington, he attended the World Bank Group&#x27;s Managerial Development Program, within the Harvard Business School.

=== Family and personal life ===
Mircea Geoană is married to Mihaela Geoană, an architect by profession, with whom he has a daughter (Ana Maria) and a son (Alexandru). Mihaela Geoană&#x27;s brother, Ionuț Costea, was the president of Eximbank.

=== Interests ===
Mihaela Geoană was President of the &quot;National Red Cross Society of Romania&quot; since April 2007, of the &quot;Renaissance for Education, Health and Culture&quot; Foundation, as well as of the &quot;Millenium for Human Rights&quot; NGO.

Mircea Geoană occupied, for two or three years, a place among the domestic football referees at Bragadiru and Voluntari. &quot;I took it from below, from the Honor Division&quot; – he said in an interview. &quot;Only I know how much swearing I heard, but also how much physical conditioning I did. You cannot imagine how much passion there can be at an Honor Division match, at Bragadiru or Voluntari. I did it with passion.&quot; He is a supporter of the football team Rapid București.

== Activity in civil society ==
Geoană is the President of the Aspen Institute Romania, &quot;an apolitical organization that aims to promote dialogue between the political, intellectual and business leaders.&quot; Geoană serves on the advisory council of the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue University, which is dedicated to accelerating the innovation and adoption of trusted technology to advances freedom. He is also Honorary President of the George Marshall Romania Association. 

== Diplomatic activity ==

A speaker of the French language, in 1990 he was hired by the Foreign Ministry as responsible for relations with France. The following year, Minister Adrian Năstase promoted him to head the European Affairs Directorate for relations with NATO, the European Union, the OSCE, the WEU, and the Council of Europe. In this capacity in 1991 he led the Romanian delegation to the committee of senior officials of the OSCE. In 1994 he became director general of the directorate general for Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa and in 1995 also for Europe and North America. Between 1993 and 1995 he was simultaneously the spokesman of the Foreign Ministry then led by Teodor Meleșcanu.

In 2019, Mircea Geoană was appointed Deputy Secretary General of NATO, after the position was opened to a person from Eastern Europe. During his term, he is chairman of NATO&#x27;s Innovation Committee and under his leadership, NATO approves its digital transformation strategy. At the Brussels Forum panel discussion in 2024 celebrating 75 years of NATO, Geoană says &quot;&quot;Now nations investing in new generation, defence and deterrence, investing in our partnerships, investing in innovation, investing in cyber, investing in space, investing in countering disinformation and this and fake news, I would say is nothing short of remarkable&quot;.&quot;

In 2024, Geoană was quoted as saying about the United States&#x27; foreign policy, &quot;As much Europe needs America, America, I think needs all its allies. The strategic reality is that China is a formidable challenger and that Russia and China and all the others together will create massive attempts to disrupt American power. There is an intense aggressive interest from these countries to basically challenge the world order which was introduced after the end of the Second World War. In this epic struggle America will need not only its own strength, but also all the allies in the Alliance.&quot;

== Political career ==
=== Ambassador ===
In February 1996 he was appointed to transfer to Washington, D.C., becoming the youngest ambassador in Romania&#x27;s diplomatic corps at 37. A career diplomat, from 1996 to 2000 Geoană served as Romania&#x27;s ambassador to the United States.

According to former PNȚCD leader Ion Diaconescu, in 1996, Geoană was close to his party, calling Diaconescu after the 1996 general elections and telling him that &quot;we won against them&quot; (i. e. - the Party of Social Democracy in Romania), with Geoană becoming close to the Social Democrats in the 2000s, after PNȚCD lost its popularity.

=== Foreign minister ===
From 28 December 2000 to 28 December 2004, Geoană was the foreign minister of Romania, as part of the PSD government of Adrian Năstase. After the Romanian legislative elections of 2004, he was replaced by Mihai Răzvan Ungureanu from the Justice and Truth Alliance (DA).

As foreign minister on 11 January 2001, on the occasion of the permanent council of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, he assumed the rotating presidency of the OSCE for one year. Among the objectives of his mandate he listed the resolution of the ongoing conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, Moldova, and Chechnya. In 2005 he was then personal representative of the OSCE chairman-in-office for Georgia.

The Năstase government considered membership of NATO and the European Union a priority, succeeding in both cases. Relations with the United States were marked by various official visits and by the constant support of American diplomacy for Romania. The government and parliament guaranteed their support to the United States in President George W. Bush&#x27;s War on terror, and in November 2002 the admission of Romania to NATO was approved with effect from March 2004.

In terms of negotiations with the European Union, despite the misgivings of the allies about the reform of the economy and the successes in the fight against corruption, the meeting of the heads of state and government of the EU 16–17 December 2004 ratified the admission of Romania, scheduling the signing of the treaty for 2005 and the accession alongside Bulgaria for 2007.

Thanks to the improvement of illegal emigration control policies, on 7 December 2001 the Justice and Home Affairs Council of the EU decided to abolish the visa system for Romanian citizens traveling in the Schengen Area starting from 1 January 2002.

The foreign policy of 2001–2004 was also distinguished by the normalization of relations with Russia. During the Romanian presidency of the OSCE, Geoană elaborated various projects for the Caucasus area without encountering obstruction by Russia. Negotiations for a treaty between the two countries began in October 2001 and concluded with the signing of the agreement in Moscow on 4 July 2003. Under the terms of the treaty, both states could join any political alliance or military they wanted. The topic of historical problems was not included in the provisions of the pact, but in a statement by the foreign ministers Geoană and Igor Ivanov.

From 1 July 2004 Geoană held the position of president of the United Nations Security Council for a month and in this capacity he was the first Western politician to visit Iraq after the transfer of sovereignty from the US army to the newborn Iraqi government. In 2001, Geoană was the chairman of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.

=== 2004 local election ===
While he was in office as foreign minister, the PSD presented him as its representative for the nomination as mayor of Bucharest in the local elections of 6 June 2004

In 2004, during the local elections in Romania, he ran for Mayor of Bucharest, but lost to incumbent mayor Traian Băsescu of the Democratic Party (PD), right in the first round. Five months later the party proposed Năstase for the presidency of Romania and Geoană as possible prime minister of a new PSD government resulting from the 2004 parliamentary elections. Năstase&#x27;s defeat by Băsescu in the presidential elections, however, opened the door for a government led by the center-right coalition Justice and Truth Alliance, despite Geoană having already entered into negotiations for the birth of a coalition executive between the PSD and other minor forces.

Because of his statements between the first round and the presidential ballot, in which he maintained that the party was on the verge of achieving a government alliance with the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania, in March 2005 the former head of state Ion Iliescu publicly called him &quot;fool&quot; (in Romanian &quot;&quot;prostănac&quot; &quot;). According to these, in fact, the rumors of a possible coalition with the UDMR would have had weight at the electoral level and contributed to the defeat of Năstase.

At the parliamentarians he was elected senator in the constituency of Dolj County. He was for the entire legislature president of the foreign policy commission of the senate and member of the joint one with the chamber of deputies for European affairs.

=== President of the Social Democratic Party ===
Considered a young reformer, Geoană was elected president of the party on 25 April 2005 by delegates at a PSD Party Congress held in Bucharest. His victory represented a surprise defeat for the former president and founder of the PSD Ion Iliescu, who was expected to defeat Geoană easily. Geoană&#x27;s win was attributed by the media to last minute backroom dealing by party leaders opposed to Iliescu as well as to public gaffes made by Iliescu at the Party Congress, including using the term &quot;comrades&quot; (&quot;tovarăși&quot;) when referring to his fellow party colleagues.

At the PSD Congress on 10 December 2006, Geoană was re-elected as party President, with his platform, &quot;Social Romania&quot;, defeating Sorin Oprescu&#x27;s.

=== Senate presidency ===
On 22 November 2011, after refusing to step down as the President of the Senate of Romania following the request of the PSD leadership, he was ousted as member of the party, losing the confidence of his colleagues in the Executive National Council of PSD where his dismissal was voted 50 to 5 while 3 abstained. In the following days he will have to step down as President of the Upper House of the Romanian Parliament as he no longer has the support of a party group in the Senate. The following day he was revoked by the senators in the plenary meeting with 112 votes for, 2 against, and 5 abstentions. He remains an independent senator. He was readmitted into the party ranks in Autumn 2012, after a reconciliation with the PSD leadership.

=== First expulsion from the Social Democratic Party ===

Weakened by the defeat in the presidential elections, Geoană tried to run again as leader of the PSD at the congress of 20 February 2010, but was defeated by Victor Ponta, who was elected new leader of the party with 856 votes to 781.

Critical of the new leadership, on 14 December 2010, the party&#x27;s executive office suspended him for six months due to various statements considered harmful to the unity of the PSD. In the autumn of 2011 he issued polemic statements against Iliescu and other members of the leadership, also announcing that he wanted to run again for the presidency of Romania. Geoană also made a public visit to the United States where he met with several local authorities, without informing the party leaders. This led to new frictions with Ponta.

On 31 October 2011, therefore, the PSD parliamentary group demanded the dismissal of Geoană from the presidency of the Senate. On 7 November, the PSD senators expressed themselves with 25 votes in favor and 5 abstentions, while Geoană refused to resign. On 14 November, with 43 votes in favor and 5 against, the party&#x27;s integrity commission proposed his expulsion from the PSD for violations of the statute. The decision was validated by the executive committee of 22 November (50 in favour, 5 against, and 3 abstentions). The next day the Senate voted for his revocation of the post of president of the upper house, with 112 in favour, 2 against, and 5 abstentions.

Marginalized by the PSD, on 16 March 2012 he presented an association called &quot;România noastră&quot;, while on the following 3 April some of his supporters founded its political branch, the Prodemo party. In May 2012 he assumed the chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Policy Committee.

=== Second expulsion from the Social Democratic Party ===

After the summer of 2012 he managed to re-establish relations with the PSD, which included him in the electoral lists of the Social-Liberal Union, a coalition set up together with the PNL in an anti-Băsescu function. At the parliamentarians of 9 December 2012 he obtained his third term as senator, obtaining the election in the district of Dăbuleni–Segarcea with 46,833 votes, equal to 70.75% of the preferences. During the legislature he was a member of the commission for European affairs (from December 2012 to October 2013), of that for Romanians abroad (from February 2014 to December 2016) and president of the joint commission with the chamber of deputies for the accession of Romania to the Schengen area (from June 2013 to December 2014).

Following new tensions that arose within the PSD, resulting from the defeat of Victor Ponta in the 2014 presidential elections, the executive committee decided on 27 November 2014 to definitively remove him from the party alongside Dan Șova and Marian Vanghelie, who had criticized the leadership. As a result of the expulsion from the party, he also lost the function of high representative of the prime minister for the promotion of strategic economic projects, which he held since 12 February 2014. For this reason he was also forced to vacate the apartment owned by the state assets to which he was entitled thanks to this position.

Accusing Ponta of deviation from the centre-left identity of the PSD, in March 2015 he founded the Romanian Social Party, which in June 2015 supported a motion of no confidence against the Ponta IV government. The PSRO did not go beyond 1.2% in the 2016 local elections and in 2017 it dissolved.

== Presidential campaigns ==

=== 2009 presidential election ===

On 3 December 2009, candidates in the second round, Băsescu and Geoană met in a televised debate that marked the final confrontation of the campaign. The event was held at the Palace of the Parliament. The debate started with a presentation of arguments that Băsescu and Geoană tried in turn to explain why Romanians should vote for them. The candidate of the PSD+PC Alliance said he came up with a project to develop the country and has demonstrated that he can unite the Romanians and keep &quot;a constructive tone and a positive approach.&quot; He discussed the three pillars that he sustains: redefining the way that Romania is working, agriculture, and developing the working field. Geoană specified that his alliance with the liberals, initialed in Timișoara, is sincere and not based on political interests. He expressed hope that Băsescu will not use in the debate means and personal attacks, &quot;like the way in which he designed the campaign, which was based on lies and personal attacks on the family.&quot;

In turn, Băsescu said that the presidency is a privilege and a &quot;huge obligation&quot; which marked him every day in the five-year term when he was president of Romania. His speech was focused on supporting the accelerated reform of the state in which the &quot;voice of Romanians must be heard&quot;. The head of state proposed &quot;a government of politicians for politicians&quot;. Băsescu spoke about the Social Democrats (PSD), whom he accused that they do not understand the country&#x27;s priorities, and are instead interested in acquiring political privileges. The candidate supported by the Liberal Democrats (PDL) recalled the possibility of the return to power of former communist government officials and Iliescu should Geoană win the presidential election. Additionally, Băsescu promised that it would immediately pass Romanians outcome of the referendum of 22 November to reduce the number of MPs and creating a unicameral parliament, which he never did. The two candidates&#x27; approaches were often strewn during the three hours of debate with personal attacks and mutual accusations. The President stated that the support structure of Geoană&#x27;s campaign was linked to television stations owned by Sorin Ovidiu Vântu and Dan Voiculescu, and supported by Dinu Patriciu&#x27;s public interventions. The two presidential candidates swore with the hand on a Bible provided by Robert Turcescu, the moderator of the debate. While Geoană vowed he had not promised any benefits to Patriciu, Vântu, and Voiculescu, Băsescu vowed that he &quot;never punched a child in the plexus or in the face&quot;.

A flashpoint of the 2009 presidential election was the revelation that Geoană, then President of the Senate and vice-president of the Supreme Council of National Defence, made a private visit to Moscow on 27 April 2009, where he met with Dmitry Medvedev, then President of the Russian Federation. The visit was confirmed by Cristian Diaconescu, the Romanian Minister of Foreign Affairs at the time of the visit and by his campaign team although initially dening knowledge of such a meeting taking place. Geoană&#x27;s opponents, including Traian Băsecu and Crin Antonescu, criticized Geoană for this visit and the manner in which it was organized. The visit became an important topic during the presidential election because it raised questions about Geoană&#x27;s stance on Russia at that time. Concerns were also brought up about Geoană&#x27;s possible ties to Boris Golovin, a Russian businessman with interests in the Romanian energy sector who presents himself as a former Soviet GRU/Spetsnaz officer, and the person who allegedly organized the visit.

=== 2024 presidential election ===

On 3 September 2024, Geoană resigned as deputy secretary-general of NATO to again seek the presidency of Romania. Geoană&#x27;s independent candidacy in the 2024 presidential election is backed by the România Renaște (Romania Renaissance) non-governmental organization (NGO). Previously, in 2023, various opinion polls for the presidential election have placed Geoană in the first place.

Throughout his 2024 presidential campaign, there have been numerous allegations against Geoană. Notably, during a debate hosted by Antena 3 CNN on 29 October 2024, Geoană has been accused by Elena Lasconi, the USR candidate for the Romanian presidency, of meeting with Tal Hanan, known for manipulating elections in over 30 countries worldwide, allegations that have been denied by Geoană. Concerns have also been brought up by the PSD candidate and Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu about potential troll farm servers on the floor of a building in Bucharest that help Geoană in the election. In response, Geoană asked Ciolacu to disclose &quot;the political source of [the] information, the address of the so-called troll farms, [...] and whether this was done on the basis of explicit instructions from the Prime Minister or Marcel Ciolacu, the candidate for the Presidency of Romania&quot;.

<text>The Nikaia Olympic Weightlifting Hall is an indoor arena in Nikaia, in Piraeus. It hosted the weightlifting events at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Greece. The venue was officially opened on August 14, 2004, the day after the beginning of the Games. The building had a capacity of 5,100, though only 3,500 seats are publicly available for the games.

==History==
After the 2004 Olympics, the facility has hosted fencing competitions, but was recently turned over to the University of Piraeus, for use as an academic lecture and conference center.

<doc id="924719" wikidata="Q4698483" url="?curid=924719" title="Airchain">
<text>In broadcast engineering for radio or television, the airchain or transmission chain (UK) (sometimes air chain (US) or just chain (UK)) is the path or route an audio or video signal takes on its way through a radio station or television station.

The airchain begins with cameras, microphones, CD players, turntables, telephone hybrids, video tape recorders, satellite and other remote feeds, and other input devices in the studio and control room. These feed into a mixing console, possibly via a router. The output then goes to an audio processor, and finally to the transmitter, feedline, and antenna. Often, there is a studio-transmitter link via radio or broadband dedicated circuit (usually T1 or E1 line). 

The airchain may be all-analogue, all-digital, or most likely some hybrid of the two.

All-analog airchains typically use cables terminated in XLR connectors between each device. All-digital airchains also often use XLR connectors, except carrying AES/EBU digital audio instead. Alternatively, some digital airchains have significant portions of audio carried over TCP/IP, in which case Ethernet is used.

<text>Henry M. Gunn Senior High School is one of two public high schools in Palo Alto, California, the other being Palo Alto High School.

Established in , Gunn High School was named after Henry Martin Gunn, who served as the Palo Alto superintendent from 1950 to 1961. In 1964, the Palo Alto Unified School District announced that it would name the district&#x27;s third high school after him. The Class of 1966 was the first class to graduate from Gunn High School.
In 1992, the school was honored as a California Distinguished School.

1,713 students attended the school in the 2023–2024 school year.

== History ==
The land under Gunn High School was purchased in 1963 by the school district from Stanford University for $358,641 (), under the condition that it could not be sold to another entity. The land was originally part of Stanford&#x27;s campus, but it was deeded to the Palo Alto Unified School District in 1964 for the construction of Gunn High School. Gunn High School opened in August 1964 with an initial enrollment of 600 students, comprising 300 sophomores and 300 juniors. It was named after Henry Gunn, the superintendent of the Palo Alto Unified School District from 1950 to 1961. Students were drawn from Fletcher Middle School and from the other two PAUSD high schools then open—Palo Alto High and Cubberley High. The 974-seat auditorium was named in 1965 after Karl Spangenberg, a recently deceased school district trustee. The school held its first football game in 1965, with Cubberley High. The 1966 class was first to graduate.

Gunn High School received national attention in 2009 after four of its students died of suicide over a span of seven months. Over the period of 2006–2016, the school&#x27;s suicide rate was four to five times higher than the national average. In 2017, a senior student died of suicide. In 2024, a 16-year-old girl who was a student at the school, died of suicide. In the past decade, attempts have been made to improve the psychological health of students attending the school.

==Academics==
Gunn offers 29 Advanced Placement (AP) classes and 16 Honors classes which are included in the weighted Grade Point Average (GPA).

In May 2023, 846 students took 2504 AP tests. 95.1% scored 3 or higher, and 52.8% scored a grade of 5. Gunn no longer ranks students, but ranking was previously recorded by decile.

Hanna Rosin wrote in a 2015 &quot;The Atlantic&quot; article that due to the emphasis on academics and competition between students, Gunn became &quot;an extreme distillation of what parents in the meritocratic elite expect from a school.&quot; Around that time, families clamored to buy houses in Gunn&#x27;s attendance boundary so their children could attend the school. According to Rosin, after a spate of suicide deaths of Gunn students in the 2010s, parents began to worry about whether the competitive atmosphere was harming students&#x27; mental well-being.

===Mathematics===
Gunn offers a wide selection of mathematics courses ranging from Algebra to AP Calculus BC. There are often three tracks of each subject offered: one at the college-prep level, another at the Advanced level, and one at the Honors level. Students who have completed the AP Calculus pathway before their senior year also have the opportunity to take Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra as a dual enrollment pathway in partnership with Foothill College. There are also two mathematics electives at Gunn: Applied Math H and AP Statistics, available to juniors and seniors. 

The math circle is one of the largest clubs on the Gunn High School campus, and its corresponding math team has participated in many competitions. Each year, the school has about 30 American Invitational Mathematics Examination qualifiers. After placing 15th nationally in 4 different tournaments during the 2020–21 school year, the 2021–22 math team won HMMT November and placed 4th in the Berkeley Math Tournament.

In 2023, a group of 25 students spoke out at a Palo Alto school board meeting, urging for PAUSD to implement more fluid math lanes, offer multivariable calculus during the school day, and more. They emphasized the importance of math classes meeting the needs of all students.

===PLTW===
Gunn is a host to Project Lead the Way (PLTW), an organization that promotes STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) education. Courses from this program include Digital Electronics and Introduction to Engineering Design, as well as Principles of Engineering.

<text>Solomon Isaac Passy (; born 22 December 1956) is a Bulgarian scientist and politician. According to Alpha Research, he is the most recognized Bulgarian of Jewish descent.

Currently, he is Chief Governance &amp; Compliance Officer in EPIX.AI, a company working on improving human health and extending people’s healthspan through epigenetics and artificial intelligence, and Chairman of the Advisory board of M3 Communications, a professional public relations and marketing company headed by Maxim Behar.

==Career and politics==

===The Berlin Wall era===
In the 1980s Passy was an activist of various opposition, underground and ecological movements opposing communism, including in defense of the oppressed Turkish minority in Bulgaria; in solidarity with them he assumed the Turkish pseudonym Syuleyman Tehlikeli when publishing mathematical papers and graphics art in the 1980s.

He attended the Solidarity Trade Union Congress in Gdansk in the fall of 1981. In May 1987 Passy was the co-host-organizer of the first public opposition happening in Sofia University. After his efforts in communist Bulgaria, in 1990-1991, as MP in the Grand National Assembly, he co-authored the first democratic Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria and tabled the bill for abolishment of the death penalty in Bulgaria.

=== Atlantic and European integration ===
In August 1990 Passy, as a Member of Parliament, appealed to the Grand National Assembly and drafted the Parliamentary Bill for the withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact and Bulgaria&#x27;s accession to NATO.

Passy and others founded the ACB, which was succeeded by dozens of other Atlantic NGOs in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), Asia, and Africa. The logo of the Atlantic Club – the NATO compass rose encircled by the 12 EU stars – became the symbol of unity of the Euro-Atlantic area adopted by number of the emerging Atlantic NGOs.

In November 1990 the ACB founders led by Passy made the first visit of an East European delegation to NATO HQ by invitation of NATO SG Manfred Wörner and the US Permanent Representative to NATO Ambassador William Taft IV, who supported the Bulgarian idea to establish ACB on a Warsaw Pact territory. Subsequently, the Bulgarian know-how was replicated in a joint statement by US Secretary of State James Baker and the Foreign Minister of Germany Hans-Dietrich Genscher in May 1991 who advocated the creation of Atlantic councils in other Warsaw Pact countries.

In June 1991 NATO SG Manfred Wörner agreed to be &quot;kidnapped&quot; in Sofia by Solomon Passy in his East German car Trabant. Manfred Wörner became a supporter of ACB and personally endorsed in 1992 ACB&#x27;s accession as first CEE member of ATA. ACB erected a monument in Sofia of him in 1996, which was inaugurated by his successor Javier Solana.

For 14 years Solomon Passy worked on Bulgaria&#x27;s membership of NATO, which was finalized on 2 April 2004 when Minister Passy raised the Bulgarian flag over NATO HQ in Brussels.

Passy co-authored the bill concerning Bulgaria’s membership in the EU, adopted by the Grand National Assembly in December 1990. He negotiated as Foreign Minister the EU Accession Treaty of Bulgaria and signed it on 25 April 2005. The Bulgarian Cyrillic alphabet was adopted as the third official EU alphabet.

In September 1990 Passy became co-author of the draft of the Parliamentary Bill for Bulgaria&#x27;s participation in the US-led coalition that liberated Kuwait from Saddam Hussein&#x27;s occupation.

Passy proposed in 2003 the creation of joint US-Bulgarian defense facilities in Bulgaria - a project he ratified in 2006 as Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Parliamentary Committee.

===Globalization of Bulgaria===
ACB is the first non-NATO NGO invited to join the Atlantic Treaty Association, in 1992. Passy is the first non-NATO Vice-President of ATA (1996-1999). Bulgaria is the first non-NATO member state to host an ATA General Assembly (1997).

Passy and ACB in November 1994, invited Pope John Paul II to Bulgaria. The visit, the first papal visit to Bulgaria, took place in 2002 when Passy was Foreign Minister; the Pope announced in Sofia that Bulgaria – contrary to widespread allegations — had not been involved in the 1981 attempt to assassinate the Pope.

Passy co-chaired the host committee of the ACB-Tibetan Friendship Society for the visit to Bulgaria of the XIV Dalai Lama of Tibet in October 1991.

Passy&#x27;s ACB hosted Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew in 1993, subsequent dialogue between the Bulgarian Orthodox Church and the Vatican eventually made the Bulgarian visit of Pope John Paul II possible.

In 1993 Passy and ACB were involved in establishing the Bulgarian Antarctic Institute and the annual Antarctic Expedition as part of the national Antarctic Program. Bulgaria became the 28th Consultative Party to the Antarctic Treaty in 1998.

In 1999 Passy became co-chair of the Host Committee for the first US presidential visit to Bulgaria, by President Bill Clinton.

===Scientific===
Solomon Passy holds a PhD (1985) and MSc (1979) in Mathematical Logic and Computer Sciences from Sofia University St. Kliment Ohridski.

He has published dozens of academic papers on mathematical logic and computer sciences. The Combinatory Dynamic Logic (Modal Logic with Nominals) was developed in Bulgaria by Solomon Passy and Professors Tinko Tinchev, George Gargov, Valentin Goranko, and Dimitar Vakarelov. Solomon’s scientific publications from 1980-1990s are widely cited.

Mr. Passy is the initiator of the STEAM and Space festival “HELLO SPACE | Bulgaria Calling!”. Its first edition was in 2021, and since then, it has become an annual event. The initiative is organized by the STEAM &amp; Space Cluster and coordinated by the Atlantic Club of Bulgaria.

In the first edition of the festival, a live chat with two astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) – Mark Vande Hei (NASA) and Thomas Pesquet (ESA) took place, while in 2022 there was a live connection with the first astronaut mother from NASA - Anna Lee Fisher. In 2023 Bulgarian students and children had the opportunity to watch a live presentation from Dr. Swati Mohan, an aerospace engineer who also served as the Guidance and Controls Operations Lead for the NASA Mars 2020 mission.

The festival includes diverse activities, such as a visual flight by Nikolay Kalaydzhiey, a world record holder, a virtual tour of CERN, demonstrations by the Special Operations Forces and inspirational lectures by scientists and experts, workshops, interactive exhibits, and scientific experiments on open air.

The project&#x27;s primary goal is to inspire young minds, fostering their curiosity in STEM fields and space exploration, while also nurturing their artistic talents by hosting a range of competitions with prizes.

==Views==
===Arab-Israeli conflict===
Solomon Passy is Jewish and expresses pride in his personal relations with four Israeli presidents. In 2003, Passy canceled a scheduled meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at Israel&#x27;s request.

In 2012, Passy proposed Israel join both NATO and EU. In 2013, Passy urged the West to conduct military strikes against Syria &quot;even in the absence of agreement at the UN Security Council.&quot;

<text>The Intel 8087, announced in 1980, was the first floating-point coprocessor for the 8086 line of microprocessors. The purpose of the chip was to speed up floating-point arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square root. It also computes transcendental functions such as exponential, logarithmic or trigonometric calculations. The performance enhancements were from approximately 20% to over 500%, depending on the specific application. The 8087 could perform about 50,000 FLOPS using around 2.4 watts.

The 8087 was an advanced integrated circuit, pushing the limits of manufacturing technology of the period. Basic operations on the 8087 such as addition and subtraction can take over 100 machine cycles to execute and some instructions exceed 1000 cycles. The chip lacks a hardware multiplier and implements calculations using the CORDIC algorithm.

Sales of the 8087 received a significant boost when a coprocessor socket was included on the 1981 IBM PC motherboard. Development of the 8087 led to the IEEE 754-1985 standard for floating-point arithmetic. The available speed version were 4.77 (5), 8, and 10 MHz. There were later x87 coprocessors for the 80186, 80286, 80386, and 80386SX processors. Starting with the 80486DX, Intel x86 processors featured integrated floating-point coprocessors; floating-point functions were integrated with the processor. Intel 486SX processors have a disabled or absent floating-point unit but allow for a separate 80487.

== Variants ==

==Design and development==
Intel had previously manufactured the 8231 &quot;Arithmetic processing unit&quot;, and the 8232 &quot;Floating Point Processor&quot;. These were designed for use with 8080 or similar processors and used an 8-bit data bus. They were interfaced to a host system either through programmed I/O or a DMA controller.

The 8087 was initially conceived by Bill Pohlman, the engineering manager at Intel who oversaw the development of the 8086 chip. Bill took steps to be sure that the 8086 chip could support a yet-to-be-developed math chip.

In 1977 Pohlman got the go ahead to design the 8087 math chip. Bruce Ravenel was assigned as architect, and John Palmer was hired to be co-architect and mathematician for the project. The two came up with a revolutionary design with 64 bits of mantissa and 16 bits of exponent for the longest-format real number, with a stack architecture CPU and eight 80-bit stack registers, with a computationally rich instruction set. The design solved a few outstanding known problems in numerical computing and numerical software: rounding-error problems were eliminated for 64-bit operands, and numerical mode conversions were solved for all 64-bit numbers. Palmer credited William Kahan&#x27;s writings on floating point as a significant influence on their design.

The 8087 design initially met a cool reception in Santa Clara due to its aggressive design. Eventually, the design was assigned to Intel Israel, and Rafi Nave was assigned to lead the implementation of the chip. Palmer, Ravenel and Nave were awarded patents for the design. Robert Koehler and John Bayliss were also awarded a patent for the technique where some instructions with a particular bit pattern were offloaded to the coprocessor.

The 8087 had 65,000 transistors and was manufactured as a 4.5 μm (then shrunk to 3 μm) depletion-load HMOS circuit. It worked in tandem with the 8086 or 8088 and introduced about 60 new instructions. Most 8087 assembly mnemonics begin with F, such as FADD, FMUL, FCOM and so on, making them easily distinguishable from 8086 instructions. The binary encodings for all 8087 instructions begin with the bit pattern 11011, decimal 27, the same as the ASCII character ESC, although in the higher-order bits of a byte; similar instruction prefixes are also sometimes referred to as &quot;escape codes.&quot; The instruction mnemonic assigned by Intel for these coprocessor instructions is &quot;ESC.&quot; The 8087 was expensive and difficult to manufacture with low yields. It also ran quite hot, forcing Intel to use a more expensive ceramic package for improved thermal dissipation.

When the 8086 or 8088 CPU executed the ESC instruction, if the second byte (the ModR/M byte) specified a memory operand, the CPU would execute a bus cycle to read one word from the memory location specified in the instruction (using any 8086 addressing mode), but it would not store the read operand into any CPU register or perform any operation on it; the 8087 would observe the bus and decode the instruction stream in sync with the 8086, recognizing the coprocessor instructions meant for itself. For an 8087 instruction with a memory operand, if the instruction called for the operand to be read, the 8087 would take the word of data read by the main CPU from the data bus. If the operand to be read was longer than one word, the 8087 would also copy the address from the address bus; then, after completion of the data read cycle driven by the CPU, the 8087 would immediately use DMA to take control of the bus and transfer the additional bytes of the operand itself. If an 8087 instruction with a memory operand called for that operand to be written, the 8087 would ignore the read word on the data bus and just copy the address, then request DMA and write the entire operand, in the same way that it would read the end of an extended operand. In this way, the main CPU maintained general control of the bus and bus timing, while the 8087 handled all other aspects of execution of coprocessor instructions, except for brief DMA periods when the 8087 would take over the bus to read or write operands to/from its own internal registers. As a consequence of this design, the 8087 could only operate on operands taken either from memory or from its own registers, and any exchange of data between the 8087 and the 8086 or 8088 was only through RAM.

The main CPU program continued to execute while the 8087 executed an instruction; from the perspective of the main 8086 or 8088 CPU, a coprocessor instruction took only as long as the processing of the opcode and any memory operand cycle (2 clock cycles for no operand, 8 clock cycles plus the EA calculation time [5 to 12 clock cycles] for a memory operand [plus 4 more clock cycles on an 8088], to transfer the second byte of the operand word), after which the CPU would begin executing the next instruction of the program. Thus, a system with an 8087 was capable of true parallel processing, performing one operation in the integer ALU of the main CPU while at the same time performing a floating-point operation in the 8087 coprocessor. Since the 8086 or 8088 exclusively controlled the instruction flow and timing and had no direct access to the internal status of the 8087, and because the 8087 could execute only one instruction at a time, programs for the combined 8086/8087 or 8088/8087 system had to ensure that the 8087 had time to complete the last instruction issued to it before it was issued another one. The WAIT instruction (of the main CPU) was provided for this purpose, and most assemblers implicitly asserted a WAIT instruction before each instance of most floating-point coprocessor instructions. (It is not necessary to use a WAIT instruction before an 8087 operation if the program uses other means to ensure that enough time elapses between the issuance of timing-sensitive 8087 instructions so that the 8087 can never receive such an instruction before it completes the previous one. It is also not necessary, if a WAIT is used, that it immediately precede the next 8087 instruction.) The WAIT instruction waited for the −TEST input pin of the 8086/8088 to be asserted (low), and this pin was connected to the BUSY pin of the 8087 in all systems that had an 8087 (so TEST was asserted when BUSY was deasserted).

Because the instruction prefetch queues of the 8086 and 8088 make the time when an instruction is executed not always the same as the time it is fetched, a coprocessor such as the 8087 cannot determine when an instruction for itself is the next instruction to be executed purely by watching the CPU bus. The 8086 and 8088 have two queue status signals connected to the coprocessor to allow it to synchronize with the CPU&#x27;s internal timing of execution of instructions from its prefetch queue. The 8087 maintains its own identical prefetch queue, from which it reads the coprocessor opcodes that it actually executes. Because the 8086 and 8088 prefetch queues have different sizes and different management algorithms, the 8087 determines which type of CPU it is attached to by observing a certain CPU bus line when the system is reset, and the 8087 adjusts its internal instruction queue accordingly. The redundant duplication of prefetch queue hardware in the CPU and the coprocessor is inefficient in terms of power usage and total die area, but it allowed the coprocessor interface to use very few dedicated IC pins, which was important. At the time when the 8086, which defined the coprocessor interface, was introduced, IC packages with more than 40 pins were rare, expensive, and suffered from problems such as excessive lead capacitance, a major limiting factor for signalling speeds.

The coprocessor operation codes are encoded in 6 bits across 2 bytes, beginning with the escape sequence:
 │ 1101 1xxx │ mmxx xrrr │

The first three &quot;x&quot; bits are the first three bits of the floating-point opcode. Then two &quot;m&quot; bits, then the latter half three bits of the floating-point opcode, followed by three &quot;r&quot; bits. The &quot;m&quot; and &quot;r&quot; bits specify the addressing-mode information.

Application programs had to be written to make use of the special floating-point instructions. At run time, software could detect the coprocessor and use it for floating-point operations. When detected absent, similar floating-point functions had to be calculated in software, or the whole coprocessor could be emulated in software for more precise numerical compatibility.

===Registers===

The x87 family does not use a directly addressable register set such as the main registers of the x86 processors; instead, the x87 registers form an eight-level deep stack structure ranging from st0 to st7, where st0 is the top. The x87 instructions operate by pushing, calculating, and popping values on this stack. However, dyadic operations such as FADD, FMUL, FCMP, and so on may either &quot;implicitly&quot; use the topmost st0 and st1 or may use st0 together with an &quot;explicit&quot; memory operand or register; the st0 register may thus be used as an accumulator (i.e. as a combined destination and left operand) and can also be exchanged with any of the eight stack registers using an instruction called FXCH st&quot;X&quot; (codes D9C8–D9CFh). This makes the x87 stack usable as seven freely addressable registers plus an accumulator. This is especially applicable on superscalar x86 processors (Pentium of 1993 and later), where these exchange instructions are optimized down to a zero-clock penalty.

===IEEE floating-point standard===
When Intel designed the 8087, it aimed to make a standard floating-point format for future designs. An important aspect of the 8087 from a historical perspective was that it became the basis for the IEEE 754 floating-point standard. The 8087 did not implement the eventual IEEE 754 standard in all its details, as the standard was not finished until 1985, but the 80387 did. The 8087 provided two basic 32/64-bit floating-point data types and an additional extended 80-bit internal temporary format (that could also be stored in memory) to improve accuracy over large and complex calculations. Apart from this, the 8087 offered an 80-bit/18-digit packed BCD (binary-coded decimal) format and 16-, 32-, and 64-bit integer data types.

===Infinity===

The 8087 handles infinity values by either affine closure or projective closure (selected by the status register). With affine closure, positive and negative infinities are treated as different values. With projective closure, infinity is treated as an unsigned representation for very small or very large numbers. These two methods of handling infinity were incorporated into the draft version of the IEEE 754 floating-point standard. However, projective closure (projectively extended real number system) was dropped from the later formal issue of IEEE 754-1985. The 80287 retained projective closure as an option, but the 80387 and subsequent floating-point processors (including the 80187) only supported affine closure.

===Coprocessor interface===
The 8087 differed from subsequent Intel coprocessors in that it was directly connected to the address and data buses. The 8087 looked for instructions that commenced with the &quot;11011&quot; sequence and acted on them, immediately requesting DMA from the main CPU as necessary to access memory operands longer than one word (16 bits), then immediately releasing bus control back to the main CPU. The coprocessor &quot;did not&quot; hold up execution of the program until the coprocessor instruction was complete, and the program had to explicitly synchronize the two processors, as explained above (in the &quot;Design and development&quot; section). There was a potential crash problem if the coprocessor instruction failed to decode to one that the coprocessor understood. Intel&#x27;s later coprocessors did not connect to the buses in the same way, but received instructions through the main processor I/O ports. This yielded an execution time penalty, but the potential crash problem was avoided because the main processor would ignore the instruction if the coprocessor refused to accept it. The 8087 was able to detect whether it was connected to an 8088 or an 8086 by monitoring the data bus during the reset cycle.

The 8087 was, in theory, capable of working concurrently while the 8086/8 processes additional instructions. In practice, there was the potential for program failure if the coprocessor issued a new instruction before the last one had completed. The assembler would automatically insert an FWAIT instruction after every coprocessor opcode, forcing the 8086/8 to halt execution until the 8087 signalled that it had finished. This limitation was removed from later designs.

==Successors==
Just as the 8088 and 8086 processors were superseded by later parts, so was the 8087 superseded. Other Intel coprocessors were the 80287 (actually - 80C287, as Intel moved to a CMOS process by that time), 80387, and the 80187. Starting with the 80486, the later Intel processors did not use a separate floating-point coprocessor; virtually all included it on the main processor die, with the significant exception of the 80486SX, which was a modified 80486DX with the FPU disabled. 80487 was in fact a full-blown 80486DX chip with an extra pin. When installed, it disabled the 80486SX CPU. The 80486DX, Pentium, and later processors include floating-point functionality on the CPU core.

<text>Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc. is the second largest tax-preparation service in the United States; responsible for preparing over 2 million federal, state, and local income-tax returns each year.

The headquarters is located in Jersey City, New Jersey. It operated more than 6,000 franchised and company-owned locations throughout the United States, including nearly 3,000 located in Walmart stores nationwide.

In January 1998, the Cendant Corporation, a consumer conglomerate, purchased Jackson Hewitt in a transaction valued at approximately $480 million. In 2004, Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc. was spun off as a separate company.

==History==

=== Foundation===
Jackson Hewitt was founded in 1982 by John Hewitt with a variety of investors who purchased the six-location, Norfolk, Virginia-based Mel Jackson&#x27;s Tax Service and renamed it Jackson Hewitt. For the next few years, the company grew slowly, adding a handful of additional outlets.

===Expansion===
In 1986, the same year the Internal Revenue Service first began to experiment with computerized tax filing, the company began selling franchises. By the following tax season there were 22 offices.

In October 1989, the Montgomery Ward department-store chain contracted with Jackson Hewitt to open offices in 169 stores across the United States. For years, Sears a competitor of Montgomery Ward had been host to H&amp;R Block in its stores. The sudden growth was too much for the company and to avoid entering bankruptcy during tax season, Jackson Hewitt closed 67 of those offices. However, by the end of 1990, the company had returned to profitability and opened more locations in Montgomery Ward stores.

By 1992, Jackson Hewitt had 515 offices in almost 30 states and was preparing 311,000 returns for taxpayers per year, making it second-largest tax preparation chain in the United States. During the following year, the company raised funds for expansion and moved into new headquarters in Virginia Beach, Virginia. By 1993, the company had 900 offices in 37 states.

In January 1994, the company went public but no new stock was issued; the company&#x27;s 700 investors&#x27; private shares simply converted into public ones. During that same year, the company made a deal to set up offices in Sam&#x27;s Club stores on a trial basis. The trial was a success, and later that year the company launched plans to establish eighteen offices in Walmart stores, leasing space for use as combined tax preparation and business mail service sites.

===Cendant===
In December 1997, Jackson Hewitt announced that it was being acquired by HFS Inc. for $480 million. Before the sale was complete, HFS merged with another firm and changed its name to Cendant Corporation. Cendant owned a number of franchise operations, ranging from Ramada Inn, Days Inn and Avis Car Rental to chains including Coldwell Banker and Century 21.

Under Cendant, Jackson Hewitt opened a total of 1,000 new offices, and started experimenting with kiosk locations in shopping malls and offices at Century 21 real estate agencies.

Following the 1999 tax season, Jackson Hewitt moved its headquarters to Cendant&#x27;s headquarters in Parsippany, New Jersey, and started acquiring of independent tax preparation offices through its largest franchisee, Tax Services of America.

Starting in 2001, Jackson Hewitt began opening offices in Kmart stores. During that year, the company also introduced the issuance of MasterCard cash cards – so that their customers would have easier access to accelerated refund accounts – as well as the creation of a Premier Tax Service for complex returns. Some Jackson Hewitt locations began to offer ATMs where clients could cash their refund checks on-site. Independent tax-service acquisitions continued throughout the year, with more than 3,300 offices, owned by 600 franchisees.

By year&#x27;s end, the company was handling over 2.2 million tax returns a year.

At its peak, Jackson Hewitt was the second-largest tax preparation firm in the U.S., a position it still holds. The firm prepared some 3.4 million tax returns for low- and middle-income customers through more than 7,400 franchised company-owned offices, including locations within Kmart, Walmart Stores and mall kiosks.

Jackson Hewitt maintained two business segments: its franchise operations – consisting of its franchise business and associated royalty, marketing-advertising revenue, financial product fees and other revenues and its company owned income tax return preparation offices. During 2008, Jackson Hewitt maintained company-owned offices in 28 markets across the United States and 5,763 franchised offices – responsible for preparing 87 percent of the total number of tax returns prepared by its network.

Jackson Hewitt Inc. operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of Jackson Hewitt. Its company-owned office operations are conducted through a wholly owned subsidiary of Jackson Hewitt Tax Services Inc., Tax Services of America, Inc.

In 2008, the company partnered with the Magic Johnson Foundation to create Community Empowerment Centers that offered comprehensive tax information seminars and financial educational resources in Sacramento, Houston, Chicago, New Orleans and Cleveland. The free seminars offered individuals in underserved communities basic tax information and budget-planning resources. For example, each attendee received free access to the Jackson Hewitt Money Manager, a Web-based home budgeting tool that helps users create and manage a budget and a detailed savings plan.

==Default==
In May 2009, the company negotiated out of a default on its debt and technically defaulted for several days in May 2010 (although an agreement with creditors was announced within one week of the &quot;default&quot;).

On May 4, 2011, the company announced it had agreed to a twenty-day extension of its debt under its various credit agreements with Wachovia/Wells Fargo Bank. The company mentioned at that time that it was considering many options including a prepackaged bankruptcy filing. On May 20, 2011, the extension expired and the company had yet to file for bankruptcy protection or to announce another extension of its debt.

On May 7, 2011, Jackson Hewitt ceased being traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The ending share price was $.19. On May 9, 2011, its stock symbol was changed from JTX to JHTX and began trading on a different stock exchange. On May 24, 2011, Jackson Hewitt officially filed for bankruptcy.

In August 2011, Jackson Hewitt became a privately held company with Philip Sanford as its president, chief executive officer and a member of the board of directors.

==Post-2011==

H.I.G. Bayside Capital recapitalized the Company in 2011 and sold the business to Corsair Capital in 2018.

Jackson Hewitt has a strong retail presence and has re-emerged after bankruptcy as the second-largest and fastest growing tax preparation company in America, having been named Vendor of the Year for Walmart. During the 2013 tax season, it expanded its presence into Sears throughout the U.S. and Puerto Rico. on January 7, 2015 Jackson Hewitt unveiled its new brand logo and slogan &quot;Working hard for the hardest working&quot; and the return of refund anticipation loans with 0% interest and no credit check.

==Products and services==

===Tax-return preparation===
Jackson Hewitt provides its customers with tax-return preparation services and electronic filing. Through the use of its tax software, ProFiler, the company provides computerized federal income tax preparation, state income tax, and individual tax preparation services to customers through its brick-and-mortar operations. In 2014, Jackson Hewitt and Tax Preparer Solutions partnered to provide online federal and state preparation and e-filing services through the Jackson Hewitt website.

===Franchise sales===
The company supports more than 5,763 franchise locations throughout the United States. Start-up costs range from around 
$75,000 to $150,000 per franchise. Jackson Hewitt offers support to franchise owners for approved Jackson Hewitt products, software, and computer hardware. The company offers an online Support Center, as well as staff trained to respond to software and technology needs. The online Support Center also provides remote assistance, email, chat and telephone support. Furthermore, in tax year 2005 Jackson Hewitt unveiled its new ESS scan system which enables paperless uploading of customer documents to its secure server.

===Tax School===
Jackson Hewitt offers &quot;Tax School&quot; throughout the country with two ways to learn: in a classroom or online, through the University of Phoenix. Jackson Hewitt is an IRS-Approved Continuation Education Provider.

<text>Anime Play is a trademark used to refer to the visual novel games distributed by Hirameki International and a discontinued magazine profiling these games.

==Anime Play DVD==
Anime Play DVDs are the only English-language visual novels that are playable on standard DVD players; they can also be played on PCs with DVD-ROM drives or video game consoles that can play DVDs like the PlayStation 2 or Xbox. The restrictions of the DVD format mean that these games are missing many features present in most visual novels such as separate volume controls for music and voices; controlling the speed at which text is played; and ability to save the game at any point.

The following games have been released in Anime Play format:

* &quot;Phantom of Inferno&quot;, a crime/romance drama
* &quot;Amusement Park&quot;, a romantic drama
* &quot;Day of Love&quot;, a high school romance
* &quot;Tea Society of a Witch&quot;, a magical fantasy
* &quot;Hourglass of Summer&quot;, a time travel romance
* &quot;Ishika and Honori&quot;, a spiritual detective drama
* &quot;Dragonia&quot;, a fantasy adventure game
* &quot;Exodus Guilty: Vol. 1 - Present&quot;, part one of a three-part adventure taking place over three time periods

Hirameki International announced in 2003 that having released &quot;Phantom of Inferno&quot; earlier that year, they would be releasing fifteen more titles in AnimePlay format in the fourth quarter of 2003, and described all sixteen on their website; however, in summer of 2003 most of these titles were removed from the website. &quot;Phantom of Inferno&quot;, &quot;Amusement Park&quot; and &quot;Day of Love&quot; were the only games released in 2003. The full list of visual novels to which they apparently acquired the rights is:

* &quot;Phantom of Inferno&quot;: released in 2003
* &quot;Day of Love&quot;: released in 2003
* &quot;The Sixteenth Night Love Song&quot;, a love adventure game: status unknown
* &quot;The Bride of Ergeners&quot;, a marriage adventure game: status unknown
* &quot;Lying on Yoshia Heights&quot;, a fantasy adventure game: status unknown
* &quot;Koimusubi (Lovers&#x27; Knot)&quot;, a romance story: status unknown
* &quot;Amusement Park&quot;: released in 2003
* &quot;Snow Talk&quot;, a fantasy simulation game: status unknown
* &quot;Separate Blue&quot;, a school love story: status unknown
* &quot;Azrael&quot;, a ghost story: status unknown
* &quot;Sweet Legacy&quot;, a cooking love story: status unknown
* &quot;Five O One&quot;, an action story: status unknown
* &quot;Canary&quot;, a school love story: status unknown
* &quot;Hooligan&quot;, an action love comedy: status unknown
* &quot;Tea Society of a Witch&quot;: released in summer 2004
* &quot;Hourglass of Summer&quot;: released in summer 2004

In late 2005, Hirameki announced on their blog that after releasing the remaining two volumes of &quot;Exodus Guilty&quot;, the Anime Play DVD series will be discontinued, and all of their visual novel titles will be released on PC.

==AnimePlay PC==
AnimePlay PC games are the visual novels released in the United States by Hirameki International. Currently, they include:

* &quot;Ai Yori Aoshi&quot;, a port of the PlayStation 2 game.
* &quot;Animamundi&quot;, a gothic horror game.
* &quot;Ever17&quot;, a mystery/suspense/romance game.
* &quot;Piece of Wonder&quot;, a strategy game/romance.
* &quot;Yo-Jin-Bo&quot;, an action/romance game.

Hirameki has announced that all of their future releases (after finishing releasing the &quot;Exodus Guilty&quot; trilogy on Interactive DVD) will be on this product line. It is unknown whether any of the 15 titles announced for DVD release in 2003 are currently slated for a PC release.

As of January 2, 2008, Hirameki &quot;has decided to bow out of publishing Interactive Visual Novels&quot;. The only retail store selling Anime Play products has also gone out of business.

Because of this, no more Anime Play DVDs or PC games will be sold.

==&quot;Anime Play&quot; magazine==
Anime Play was also a quarterly magazine published by Hirameki International. It featured a thin print edition, with the majority of its material on an interactive DVD. The magazine mostly reviewed the Anime Play DVD releases, but anime and manga as well. The magazine published its first issue in July 2003. It was announced shortly after the opening of the Hirameki Community Site that Hirameki will no longer publish &quot;Anime Play&quot; magazine, choosing instead to focus on releasing PC titles.

<doc id="924735" wikidata="Q2087380" url="?curid=924735" title="Northfleet">
<text>Northfleet is a town in the borough of Gravesham in Kent, England. It is located immediately west of Gravesend, and on the border with the Borough of Dartford. Northfleet has its own railway station on the North Kent Line, just east of Ebbsfleet International railway station on the High Speed 1 line. According to the 2021 census, Northfleet has a population of 29,900 (rounded to the nearest 100).

==Area==
Northfleet&#x27;s name is derived from being situated on the northern reach of what was once called the River Fleet, today known as the Ebbsfleet River. There is a village at the other end of the river named Southfleet.

Northfleet has been the site of a settlement on the shore of the River Thames, adjacent to Gravesend since Roman times. It was known as &quot;Fleote&quot; by the Saxons c. 600 AD, &quot;Flyote&quot; c. 900 AD, and &quot;Flete&quot; c. 1000 AD. It was recorded as &quot;Norfluet&quot; in the Domesday Book, and &quot;Northflet&quot; in 1201. By 1610 the name of Northfleet had become established.

A battle took place during the Civil War at the stone bridge over the Ebbsfleet river.

Northfleet became a town in 1874 with Northfleet Urban District Council being established c. 1894. In 1974 it was merged with the adjacent Borough of Gravesend. The first council offices were off the Hill, but the council then moved to Northfleet House which is now a nursing home for the elderly.

Northfleet House was the home of Thomas Sturge, owner of a cement works.

Northfleet was in the lathe of Aylesford and hundred of Toltingtrough.

Romans lived in the area now known as Springhead, which they called &quot;Vagniacae&quot;. Springhead, the source of the Ebbsfleet River, was the first site in Britain where watercress was grown commercially in the early 19th century.

Watling Street, a Roman road which forms the basis of the A2 from London to Dover, bisects the area.

==History==

===Rosherville Gardens===

In 1815 the first steamboat started plying between Gravesend, Kent, and London, an event which was to bring much prosperity to the area. The number of visitors steadily increased, and in the course of the next ten years several new and rival steam packets were started. The regular service led entrepreneurs to establish amenities for the entertainment of visitors, one of which was Rosherville Gardens.

George Jones laid out the gardens in 1837 in one of the disused chalk pits, covering an area of 17 acres (69,000 m2). Their full title was the &#x27;Kent Zoological and Botanical Gardens Institution&#x27;. They occupied an area in what was to become Rosherville New Town (see below).

Robert Hiscock, in his &quot;A History of Gravesend&quot; (Phillimore, 1976) describes them thus:

They were a place of surpassing beauty and a favourite resort of Londoners. Adorned with small Greek temples and statuary set in the cliffs, there were terraces, and archery lawn, Bijou theatre, and Baronial Hall for refreshments, and at one time a lake. At night the gardens were illuminated with thousands of coloured lights and there were fireworks displays and dancing. Famous bands such as the American Sousa were engaged during the season. Blondin, the trapeze artist, performed ... In 1857 as many as 20,000 visitors passed through the turnstiles in one week. By 1880 the gardens had reached the peak of their popularity ... in 1901 they were closed.
During a brief revival 1903–1911, they were used in the making of early films.

A pier was built to carry these crowds ashore, and a railway station opened on the Gravesend West branch railway. It was one of the steamboats from Rosherville Gardens that was involved in a horrific accident in 1878. The passenger steamer, after leaving Rosherville pier, was in a collision with the collier &quot;Bywell Castle&quot;, from Woolwich. 640 people died from the collision, 240 being children. An inquest was held at Woolwich, but no conclusive reason was ever established as to the cause of the disaster at the Devils Elbow on the Thames.

===Rosherville New Town===

Joseph Rosher gave his name to a building scheme which began with the building of new houses in 1830. A prospectus states that &#x27; this spot will ultimate become to Gravesend what St Leonards is to Hastings and Broadstairs to Margate&#x27;. That grandiose scheme did not materialise in quite that way, but the area of Northfleet still bears that name.

===Northfleet Harbour===
Northfleet Harbour is formed from a natural river inlet of the River Ebbsfleet into the Thames. The Harbour formed over solid chalk, and created a marine facility that was originally used by the Romans. Remains of Roman buildings have been found further up the River Ebbsfleet, and during the High Speed 1 railway works, evidence of Saxon occupation was also found. By the 18th century, a flour mill was placed within the Harbour, and later it was home to the cement industry. A local community trust is now aiming to restore the harbour and bring it back into public use.

===Northfleet during the Second World War===
On Friday, 16 August 1941 150 German aircraft flew through the Kent skies, to deal the worst blow to civilian life the county had experienced to that point in the war. With the formation splitting into groups to be variously challenged from Manston, Kenley, Hornchurch, Biggin Hill and Hawkinge airfields, a group of Dorniers made it to Northfleet a little after midday. They dropped about 106 bombs ranging from 50 to 250 kilos over the town. The bombs killed 29 people, injured 27, and badly damaged two schools.

==Governance==
Northfleet Urban District Council was set up under the Local Government Act 1894. Within its boundaries were the hamlets of Northfleet Green and Nash Street, as well as the now built-up Perry Street; and the later estates at Shears Green, Istead Rise and Downs Road. Northfleet was merged, inter alia, with Gravesend to become Gravesham District Council on 1 April 1974.

== Demographics ==
According to the 2021 census, Northfleet has a population of 29,900 (rounded to the nearest 100). 30.0% of people in Northfleet are aged 25 to 44, above the borough average of 26.7%. The largest ethnic group is White who make up 72.0% of the population, below the borough average of 76.6%, with the second largest being Asian/Asian British who comprise 12.4% of the population, above the borough average of 11.2%. The largest religious group in Northfleet is Christianity who make up 47.3% of the population, below the borough average of 49.2%, with the second largest being No religion, who amount to 32.2% of the population, on par for the borough average.

==Industry and commerce==

With its situation on a busy waterway such as the River Thames, at a point where higher land came close to the river, it was an obvious place for industry to be located. The river provided water supplies and the means whereby raw materials and products could be transported. The forests of the area provided timber for various aspects of most industries. It was an area famous for Gun Flint manufacturing as Flint is found in amongst the Chalk. Flint was also used as a local building material. Flint walls can still be found in the area. The Springhead/Ebbsfleet Valley area was used for the growing of Watercress much of which supplied the London market.

===Cement===

The Romans first began to dig chalk from the area, but the making of cement came later. The industry requires plentiful water supplies, and chalk as its main ingredient, both of which were to hand. When in 1796, James Parker set up kilns on Northfleet creek to make his Roman cement, it was the beginning of a large complex of cement works along this stretch of the river. The manufacture of Portland cement began in April 1846 when William Aspdin, son of Joseph Aspdin, its inventor, acquired Parker&#x27;s works and built new kilns.

Aspdin&#x27;s works became Robins &amp; Co in 1853, sold on to the Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers (APCM) in 1900, which was taken over by the Lafarge Group in 2001. By 1900, there were nine cement works operating on the Thames between Swanscombe and Gravesend. The last cement plant in Northfleet ceased operation in 2008.

Now under water, one of the largest chalk pits, known locally as The Blue Lake, can be found between the A226 and the North Kent Railway line. It is about 200 metres south of the access tunnel to the old (now demolished) Lafarge cement plant, that runs under the North Kent / Channel Tunnel rail-link railway lines.

===Paper===
Kimberly-Clark&#x27;s paper mill, previously Bowaters and Bowater-Scott, was established in 1923 and makes Andrex toilet tissue.

===Metals===
Britannia Refined Metals, now part of Glencore, has a refinery producing lead and silver in Northfleet.

===Northfleet Dockyard===

By 1800, Northfleet had several shipyards. Thomas Pitcher&#x27;s, laid out in 1788, built at least 25 merchant vessels for East Indies and West Indies service, and about the same number for the Navy. There is a model of one in St. Botolph&#x27;s Church. The yard&#x27;s first ship was , an East Indiaman of 1252 tons burthem, for the East India Company. In 1839 the company was in the hands of Pitcher&#x27;s sons William and Henry. The docks were in decline by 1843, and the yard closed in 1860.

===Cable works===

Henley&#x27;s cable works, now AEI, occupied land once used by Rosherville Gardens and was a significant employer. PLUTO pipeline was built there.

AEI Cables closed in 2005 and Henley moved in 2006. The Henley works were completely demolished by 2010. The area is being redeveloped by Keepmoat Homes as Cable Wharf.

==Transport==

=== Rail ===
Northfleet railway station opened in 1849 as part of an extension of the North Kent Line from Gravesend to London and runs services operated by Southeastern and Thameslink. Southeastern trains run to Gravesend and London Charing Cross, and Thameslink ones to Rainham and Luton.

Gravesend railway station is closer to much of Northfleet&#x27;s residential area than its own station and Access For All is available there and not at Northfleet.

Ebbsfleet International railway station on the High Speed 1 line is located less than a mile from Northfleet. It is served by Eurostar and Southeastern trains, both running to and from London St Pancras.

Ebbsfleet International has poor pedestrian connections to Northfleet station and although it&#x27;s domestic passenger entrance is within a quarter of a mile, the walking distance between the two is greater.

==Education==

==Northfleet churches==

The ancient parish church of Northfleet (dating from the 14th century, but with work from earlier periods) is dedicated to St Botolph. Its tower was built in 1717, after the original had fallen. The church contains a 14th-century carved oak screen, which is thought to be the oldest in Kent. Rosherville St Mark&#x27;s Church is now part of the Team ministry with St. Botolph&#x27;s church. The other active church in Northfleet is All Saints, Perry Street which is Anglo Catholic. All Saints Perry Street is the largest Anglican parish in Gravesham Borough with a quarter of the Gravesham population living within its boundaries.

The Roman Catholic church, Our Lady Of The Assumption designed by Giles Gilbert Scott and with its tower foreshadowing his Liverpool Cathedral, is built entirely of brown brick. It was constructed in 1914 on the site of a former Tram Depot. During WW2, and the blitz, the German Air Force used the tower of the Church as a guide into London. The pilots used the tower as a reference point for direct access into London.

There is a United Reformed Church (URC) on Dover Road in Northfleet. The Dover Road Chapel was opened on Wednesday 20 June 1850 as a Congregational Church. Northfleet URC is grouped with three other churches in the North Kent URC group. These are St Paul&#x27;s URC, Singlewell Road, Gravesend; Hartley URC and Southfleet URC.

==Culture and community==

===Rotary Club===
The Rotary Club of Northfleet was founded in 1954, originally with members drawn from the major river front industries, but as these declined membership changed. In 2005, it was renamed Northfleet with Ebbsfleet Rotary Club, to reflect the growing importance of Ebbsfleet.

===Portlands===
The Portlands Factory Club, opened on July 31, 1878. It was later named the Blue Circle Club and eventually Portlands Spectrums until 2007. It was built by Parr and Strong for Thomas Bevan. The building includes a basement, double-height ground floor, and ornate attic with slate roofs. It has central recessed sections with round-headed windows and tower-like terminal parts accessible by bridges. These segments are adorned with Corinthian pilasters, ascending to pitched roofs with dormer windows. The building&#x27;s well-preserved decorations exhibit early uses of Portland cement.

It had halls, sports facilities, a library, and hosted local clubs and societies. A bowling green and outdoor pool were added in 1907.

The building was listed Grade 2 in 1983, and closed in 2009. Since then it has fallen in to disrepair and suffered damage from suspected arson attacks.

==Sports==

===Ebbsfleet United Football Club===

Gravesend &amp; Northfleet FC was formed through amalgamation in 1946 of Gravesend United FC and Northfleet United FC which prevented the almost certain bankruptcy of the latter. Gravesend (being by far the larger of the two towns, in terms of population), was always going to be the first name of the new club. Although one would suppose Gravesend to be the main influence in the history of this club, as it was listed first when the towns&#x27; clubs merged, it was in fact Northfleet that was to be responsible for the early significant accomplishment of the association football club now known as Ebbsfleet United F.C. As of the start of the 2023–2024 season, Ebbsfleet are in the National League.

===Northfleet Football Academy===
Northfleet Football Academy was started in 2009 by local school Northfleet Technology College. Northfleet Football Academy was designed to recruit the elite of Graveshams football players and give them the best possible coaching to help them develop as players. It also offers its participants the opportunity to take a BTEC in Sports and one other additional subject like Science to help the players gain nationally recognised qualifications at key stage 4 whilst the players develop their playing skills. The academy is run by Northfleet Technology College teachers Brian Meaney (manager) and Lisa Donaldson (chairman) and also boasts the professional coaching of former Welsh international and current Ashford Town manager Steve Lovell. The academy is based in Colyer Road, Northfleet. 

===Fleet Leisure Football Club===
Fleet Leisure F.C. were a Non-League football team who played in the Kent Invicta Football League. The team were originally based at Nelson Road, and then groundshared with Rochester United F.C. For the 2014–15 season the club changed its name from Fleet Leaisure to Gravesham Borough. The 2016–17 season saw the club enter the FA Cup for the first time in their history when they entered the competition in the preliminary qualification round. They folded prior to the 2018–19 season after being unable to raise the funding required to continue playing.
The club name has been continued by Gravesham Borough Youth Football Club.

===Gravesham Borough Football Club===
Gravesham Borough F.C. were a non-League football team who played in the Southern Counties East Football League. The team was originally based at Nelson Road, then groundshared with Chatham Town F.C.

<text>Charles Richard Moll (January 13, 1943 – October 26, 2023) was an American actor known for playing Aristotle Nostradamus &quot;Bull&quot; Shannon, a bailiff on the NBC sitcom &quot;Night Court&quot; from 1984 to 1992 and voicing Harvey Dent/Two-Face in the DC Animated Universe series &quot;&quot; and &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot;.

==Early life==
Charles Richard Moll was born in Pasadena, California, the son of Violet Anita (née Grill), a nurse, and Harry Findley Moll, a lawyer. He was tall early in his life, reaching by age 12. He kept growing until he was about tall. As a child, he and his family would often visit Jackson Hole, Wyoming. He attended the University of California, Berkeley, and was a member of the Kappa Alpha Order fraternity. During his time at UC Berkeley, Moll performed in works of William Shakespeare.

==Career==
In the 1977 film &quot;Brigham&quot;, Moll (credited as Charles Moll) appeared as Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement. Moll would go on to often portray hulking or imposing characters due to his height and deep voice. In 1979, Moll played the part of Eugene, a gangster on the television series &quot;Happy Days&quot; in the episode &quot;Fonzie&#x27;s Funeral&quot;. In 1981, Moll co-starred with Jan-Michael Vincent and Kim Basinger in the film &quot;Hard Country&quot;, and he also played the abominable snowman in the comedy feature film &quot;Caveman&quot;. The same year, he had a small part in the &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot; episode &quot;Alienation&quot;, where he appeared with future fellow &quot;Night Court&quot; cast member John Larroquette. In 1982, he played the sorcerer Xusia in &quot;The Sword and the Sorcerer&quot;.

In 1983, Moll shaved his head for the role of Hurok in the science fiction B movie &quot;&quot;. The producers of the TV sitcom &quot;Night Court&quot; liked the look so much in his audition that they asked him to keep it. He played bailiff Aristotle Nostradamus &quot;Bull&quot; Shannon on &quot;Night Court&quot; from 1984 to 1992. He also used the Bull persona in commercials for the Washington Lottery.

Moll played the role of Big Ben in the 1985 horror film &quot;House&quot;. He earned a Saturn Award nomination for the role. Moll made an appearance in the first episode of &quot;&quot; as Slan Quince, the villain who reunites Connor MacLeod with his kinsman and the show&#x27;s protagonist, Duncan MacLeod. Moll made a guest appearance on &quot;Babylon 5&quot; in the episode &quot;Hunter, Prey&quot; as a lurker criminal who was holding a VIP hostage, and as a gangster on &quot;Married... with Children&quot;. Moll made another guest appearance in the TV series &quot;&quot;, playing the cyclops in episode two, &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot;.

In &quot;Super Password&quot;, Moll appeared with Judy Norton Taylor, Nancy Lane, Markie Post, Gloria Loring, Florence Halop, Debra Maffett, Elaine Joyce, and Kim Morgan Greene, with Bert Convy as the game show&#x27;s host from 1984 to 1987.

Moll played himself in &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; (Season 9, episodes 1 and 2: &quot;Down and Out in Malibu&quot;).

Moll appeared in &quot;The Flintstones&quot; and &quot;Casper Meets Wendy&quot;, both TV spin-offs. In 1999&#x27;s &quot;But I&#x27;m a Cheerleader&quot;, Moll played a gay man who, with his partner (Wesley Mann), helps gay teenagers escape from a nearby camp where parents send their teenage offspring for conversion therapy. He played the drifter on the Nickelodeon show &quot;100 Deeds for Eddie McDowd&quot;.

In 2001, he played Hugh Kane, the ghost haunting a mansion in &quot;Scary Movie 2&quot;. In 2007, he played (along with M. Steven Felty) Kolchak Jefferson Stillwall in the Anthony C. Ferrante horror film &quot;Headless Horseman&quot;. In 2014, Moll appeared as a security guard on an episode of &quot;Anger Management&quot; with Charlie Sheen.

===Voiceover work===
Moll can be heard in many animated productions, often as a villain with a deep, growling voice. He voiced Two-Face in &quot;&quot;, Scorpion in later episodes of &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (who was originally voiced by Martin Landau) and the Abomination in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (who was originally voiced by Kevin Schon).

Moll also provided voice work in the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Chill of the Night!&quot; voicing Lew Moxon as well as briefly reprising Two-Face (who was mainly voiced by James Remar). His first role in an animated film was as a beat poet in Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s &quot;American Pop&quot;. He starred as Norman in the animated series &quot;Mighty Max&quot;. He also voiced Vorn the Unspeakable, a Cthulhu-like character in the &quot;Freakazoid!&quot; episode &quot;Statuesque&quot;.

Moll voiced the Devil Hulk in the 2005 video game &quot;Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction&quot;. In the 2010 video game &quot;Dante&#x27;s Inferno&quot;, he voiced Death (which he shared with Dee Bradley Baker) and King Minos.

==Personal life and death==
Moll was married twice: he was married to Laura Class from 1989 to 1992 and Susan Brown from 1993 to 2005. He had two children with Brown as well as stepchildren.
Moll was an avid bird watcher who spent his retirement in Big Bear Lake, California. 

Moll died at his home in Big Bear Lake on October 26, 2023, at the age of 80.

<doc id="924744" wikidata="Q7993820" url="?curid=924744" title="Whirlwind Heat">
<text>Whirlwind Heat was a three-piece band from the city of Grand Rapids, Michigan. Although they are avid genre-hoppers, they are often categorized as indie rock.

==History==
The band was formed in 1996 by synthesizer-player/vocalist David James Swanson, bassist Steve Damstra, and drummer Brad Holland, all sixteen years old at the time. The band&#x27;s name originates from the cover art done by Raymond Pettibon for Sonic Youth&#x27;s 1990 release &quot;Goo&quot;. They played their first show on March 17, 1997. In 1999 the group was joined by guitarist Jason Eberspeaker and released a 45, continuing to play gigs around Michigan.

One such gig was attended by Jack White of The White Stripes, who offered to record them. On June 20, 2000, the same day as the release of the White Stripes&#x27; album &quot;De Stijl&quot;, Whirlwind Heat recorded a handful of songs in White&#x27;s attic studio. A single entitled &quot;Glaxefusion&quot; was released on Italy Records soon after, as well as a track on White&#x27;s 2001 compilation, Sympathetic Sounds of Detroit released by Sympathy Records.

Eberspeaker soon left the band to follow a career in fine arts. In August 2002, over a brief four-day period, the remaining trio recorded what would be the debut album not only for the band, but for White&#x27;s label collaboration with V2 Records, Third Man Records. (White also produced the album.) The album, &quot;Do Rabbits Wonder?&quot;, was released on Third Man Records with distribution by V2 Records and XL Recordings on April 15, 2003, as well as later releasing a cover of the White Stripes song &quot;You&#x27;re Pretty Good Looking&quot; for the soundtrack of &quot;The Hot Chick&quot;. The music video for the single &quot;Purple&quot; was shot by fashion/celebrity photographer Terry Richardson in New Paltz, NY. The video featured models Susan Eldridge and Kemp Muhl.

In 2004 the band released a short EP entitled &quot;Flamingo Honey&quot;, written and recorded in five hours. The EP features ten songs, all approximately one minute in length.

The band&#x27;s second full-length album &quot;Types of Wood&quot; was released on April 24, 2006, in the UK by Brille Records. The album photos of model Susan Eldridge were shot by Terry Richardson . &quot;Types of Wood&quot; has 11 tracks including the singles Reagan which also features on the &quot;Reagan EP&quot;. Along with the release of the album, the band filmed a video for each song. The video for Reagan was directed by Matthew Gray Gubler who cast his younger brother in the video as a fourth member of the band.

Whirlwind Heat&#x27;s last live performance was at Summer Sonic Festival in Tokyo, Japan on August 13, 2006.

In 2007 Whirlwind Heat collaborated with Devonte Hynes (of the now defunct Test Icicles, Lightspeed Champion, and currently Blood Orange) and called the project &quot;Lightspeed Heat&quot;.

The band self-released Self Titled or Scoop Du Jour on July 4, 2008, under their own record label imprint Heat Enterprises. The artwork was screen-printed in black ink on a sticker and applied to a blank white LP sleeve. The ice cream in the design was then colored green with a marker. The model on the cover is Erin Wasson and was photographed by Terry Richardson. Illustrations of the band members and art were done by actor/director/artist Matthew Gray Gubler. 
On April 19, 2014 Record Store Day, Whirlwind Heat performed in the blue room at Third Man Records in Nashville, TN. The first time on stage since playing in 2006 at Summer Sonic Festival in Tokyo, Japan. It was likely their last performance. Their debut album, Do Rabbits Wonder? was reissued, in a variety of colored vinyl. Jack White performed at 10am this day, creating the world&#x27;s fastest record. Whirlwind Heat performed at 2pm.

<doc id="924746" wikidata="Q333833" url="?curid=924746" title="Franco Frattini">
<text>Franco Frattini (14 March 1957 – 24 December 2022) was an Italian politician and magistrate. He served as the President of the Council of State from January to December 2022.

Frattini previously served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2002 to 2004 and from 2008 to 2011 in the governments of Silvio Berlusconi and Minister of Public Function from 1995 to 1996 and from 2001 to 2002, in the government of Lamberto Dini and Silvio Berlusconi. From 2004 to 2008, he was also the European Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security in the first Barroso Commission.

==Education and career==
Frattini was born in Rome in 1957. He attended the &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; Classical High School in Rome and graduated in law in 1979 at the Sapienza University.

From 1984 he was State Attorney and magistrate of the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) in Piedmont. In 1986, Frattini was named member of the Italian Council of State and legal adviser of the Treasury Ministry. During these years, he served as secretary of the Federation of Young Italian Socialists (FGSI) and member of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI).

In 1990 and 1991, he worked as a legal adviser to the deputy secretary of the PSI, Claudio Martelli, in the Andreotti VI Cabinet.

==Early political career==
In 1994, Frattini was appointed Secretary General to the Presidency of the Council of Ministers during the first government of Silvio Berlusconi. However, in January 1995, the government lost its majority in the parliament and Lamberto Dini, an independent technocrat who was serving as Minister of Treasury, became the new Prime Minister. Frattini was appointed Minister for Public Function.

In 1996, he joined Berlusconi&#x27;s Forza Italia (FI) and was candidated in the upcoming election within the Pole for Freedoms, the electoral coalition between FI, National Alliance and other minor conservative parties. He was elected in the northern constituency of Bolzano–Laives. However, the centre-left coalition of Romano Prodi won the election and from 1996 to 2001, Frattini served as chairman of the parliamentary committee for the supervision of intelligence (COPACO). Moreover, from November 1997 until August 2000 he was also a City Councillor in Rome.

==Minister in Berlusconi&#x27;s cabinets (2001–2004)==
===Minister of Public Function===
In 2001, Frattini was a candidate for the Chamber of Deputies in the constituency of Bolzano, supported by House of Freedom. From 2001, he took part in the Berlusconi II Cabinet as Minister for Public Administration. The so-called Frattini Act, namely Law no. 215/2004, on &quot;Rules on conflicts of interest&quot;, approved by Parliament on 13 July 2004, received criticism from the Council of Europe&#x27;s Venice Commission on its compatibility with international standards on freedom of expression and pluralism of the media.

===Minister of Foreign Affairs===

From 14 November 2002 to 18 November 2004, Frattini served as Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs: the appointment of Frattini followed ten months of &quot;interim&quot; by Berlusconi himself, after the resignation of the former minister Renato Ruggiero due to his contrasts with the foreign policies of the government.

During his ministerial tenure, Italy supported the invasion of Iraq by the United States led by president George W. Bush; Frattini called it a &quot;legitimate intervention&quot; even in the absence of a United Nations mandate. Frattini authorized the overflight and the use of Italian military bases by the Anglo-American coalition. Frattini later sent an Italian military and police contingent to Iraq, in what he called a &quot;humanitarian emergency intervention,&quot; of about 3,200 men. This force made Italy the 3rd largest participant in the Coalition of the willing after the United States and the United Kingdom.

Italian forces took part in Operation Ancient Babylon which began in July 2003 together with British forces in the southern Dhi Qar province, centered in the town of Nassiriya; the Italian Barbara Contini was charged with civilian administration by the Coalition Provisional Administration. A suicide attack there killed 19 Italians, among military and civilians.

During the Italian military presence in the south of Iraq, eight Italians were kidnapped, of whom two were later murdered: the mercenary Fabrizio Quattrocchi and the journalist Enzo Baldoni, in addition to the SISMI agent Nicola Calipari, killed by U.S. soldiers during the liberation of kidnapped journalist Giuliana Sgrena. It remains unclear whether Italy offered a ransom for the release of the other six hostages. The killing of Quattrocchi was reported live on the late night Italian television program Porta a Porta, at the time of which Frattini was a guest in the studio, which raised criticism of Frattini for the lack of tact in not informing the victim&#x27;s family in advance. Frattini was later also criticized for saying Quattrocchi &quot;died bravely, I would say as a hero&quot;.

In 2004, Frattini had to leave office at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which passed to Gianfranco Fini following a government reshuffle. Italy&#x27;s participation in the post-war occupation of Iraq remained unpopular within the Italian public opinion. At the beginning of 2006, the Berlusconi III government announced its intention to withdraw the Italian contingent from Iraq by the end of the year, a decision confirmed by the new government of Romano Prodi that succeeded it.

==Vice President of the European Commission and European Commissioner (2004–2008)==

On 4 November 2004, Frattini was named by Berlusconi to take up the Justice and security portfolio in the European Commission, replacing the controversial Rocco Buttiglione, whose appointment had been rejected by the European Parliament. The appointment of Frattini as European Commissioner for Justice, Freedom, and Security raised concerns from the British Liberal Democrat MEP Sarah Ludford, due to accusations of belonging to Freemasonry, raised by Buttiglione himself towards Frattini and denied by the latter. Frattini was also afforded one of the five seats as vice-president of the European Commission.

In February 2006, during the Danish cartoons row, Frattini defended the media&#x27;s freedom of speech, though he did express disagreement with subject of the cartoons. In November 2006, the commissioner&#x27;s concern for child welfare extended to video games, calling for tougher controls; anything relating to stricter self-regulation to an outright ban. In 2007, Frattini called for a ban on the horror title &quot;Rule of Rose&quot;, and criticised the EU-endorsed PEGI system for granting the game a 16-years-or-over age rating. Reports on &quot;GameSpot&quot; showed he was seeking a Europe-wide ban on violent videogames. On 6 February 2007, during the Safer Internet Day 2007, Frattini recalled the need to protect children&#x27;s rights, saying: &quot;I am deeply concerned at this potential harm by the internet to children. This could involve people preying on them or children accessing racist, cruel or violent material.&quot;

At the start of 2007, Frattini backed an Italian push for EU support of a worldwide ban on the death penalty, while in April 2007, he asked for more powers to be given to Eurojust, advocating the power to initiate prosecutions with a European Public Prosecutor. Moreover, following the 2007 Glasgow International Airport attack, he criticised the handling of Islam by member-states and called for a &quot;European Islam&quot;. Interviewed by Reuters he declared his intention to promote online communications monitoring and censorship of &quot;dangerous words&quot; like &quot;bomb, kill, genocide or terrorism&quot;.

As European Commissioner, he promoted a &quot;visa facilitation agreement between the European Community and the Russian Federation&quot; (2007/340/EC: Council Decision of 19 April 2007), which however led to the expulsion of countless citizens Europeans domiciled for a long time in Russia on the basis of annual visas, which due to the introduction by the agreement of a limit of stay in the territory of maximum 90 days out of 180 were forced to leave the country, not being able to reside on the spot on the basis of unlimited annual visas as happened in the past. Article 5 of the law of the Russian Federation 25 July 2002 n.115, provides in fact the limit of 90 days of stay only to those who are not subject to the visa regime, but the agreement drawn up by Frattini extends this limit to all the citizens of the Union.

In 2008, Frattini joined the newly formed People of Freedom (PdL) and left on unpaid leave as Commissioner to run for election in Italy. He did not directly resign from his Commissioner post, to avoid that his successor be appointed by the out-going Prodi II Cabinet. He only resigned as Commissioner after taking up the position of Foreign Minister in the Berlusconi IV government. The role of European Commissioner from Italy was then assigned to Antonio Tajani, another member of PdL, with responsibility for transports rather than for justice. Frattini was the second ever European Commissioner from Italy to choose Italian over European politics, after the resignation of Franco Maria Malfatti in 1972.

During his term as European Commissioner, Frattini was also appointed by Prime Minister Berlusconi to the coordinate assistance from the government for the conduct of the Winter Olympics in Turin 2006.

==Minister of Foreign Affairs (2008–2011)==

At the 2008 snap election Frattini ran in north-eastern constituency of Friuli-Venezia Giulia and was elected to the Chamber of Deputies. From 2008 to 2011, Frattini once again served as foreign minister.

===Benghazi Treaty and migration policy===

During the first summer of his second foreign ministry the &quot;Treaty of friendship between Italy and Libya&quot; was signed (so-called Benghazi agreement); with this treaty, Libya under Muammar Gaddafi agreed to repatriate the boats of sub-Saharan migrants from the Libyan coast to Italy. Cooperation between the two coast guards started in May 2009, with protests from international groups for the protection of human rights, which criticized the return of migrants – including eligible asylum seekers – to Libya, which had not ratified the UN Convention on Refugees; the policy was subsequently suspended but not officially repudiated. Frattini had openly supported the policy of &quot;respingimenti&quot;, contrary to the international humanitarian law principle of non-refoulement, describing such policy as a &quot;due application of European rules&quot;, and stamping as &quot;unworthy&quot; the 2010 report by Amnesty International that highlighted the critical nature of this policy in light of international and European law.

In September 2010, on the occasion of the second visit of Gaddafi to Rome, Frattini declared &quot;We have blocked the trafficking of illegal immigrants&quot;, despite the figures showing the continuation of migratory flows, and despite being mainly people entitled to forms of international protection. In February 2011, in a set-up changed by the Arab spring uprisings, Frattini claimed to want to &quot;mobilize the Mediterranean countries&quot; and the EU, through the Frontex agency, for patrols and refoulements. However following the fall of the governments of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in Tunisia and Gaddafi in Libya, the number of migrants attempting to reach Italy and Europe surged. Italy&#x27;s response to these migrants has been criticized by organizations including Amnesty International and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

The European Court of Human Rights, in the &quot;Hirsi v. Italy&quot; ruling of 23 February 2012, condemned Italy for breach of the convention, in particular with regard to Article 3 (prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment) and Article 4 of Protocol IV (prohibition of collective expulsions); in this case, 200 Somali and Eritrean migrants had been rejected in Libya under the Benghazi agreement, without having the possibility of applying for asylum in Europe.

===Foreign policy===

The reaction of Italian diplomacy, led by Frattini, to the revolts of the Arab spring and the Libyan civil war was defined as &quot;reactive&quot; and &quot;unrealistic&quot; by the ISPI-IAI 2012 report edited by Alessandro Colombo and Ettore Greco.

Like other Western countries, Italy was completely taken aback by the Arab uprisings, and after a first moment at a loss for words it tried to frame the phenomenon in the reassuring discourse of democratization, reassured by the absence of Islamist symbols or anti-Western slogans. If the initial hesitations and the abrupt U-turn on the Qaddafi regime can constitute an element in common with other countries, Italy is the only international actor who long sought to &quot;cling to its own imaginary role of mediator &quot;, for which however lacked both power and necessary authority. With the evolution of the conflict, Frattini and Italian diplomacy resorted to the &quot;usual option to follow the stronger allies&quot;, facilitated in this by the &quot;dilution of Franco-British unilateralism in the multilateral framework of NATO&quot; and by the guarantee of U.S. participation.

As far as European politics is concerned, according to Colombo and Greco, the reaction capacity of the Berlusconi IV government proved to be &quot;totally insufficient&quot;, in the absence of a coherent long-term and vulnerable strategy to the internal divisions of the majority and to a &quot;persistent underestimation of risks &quot;. According to Colombo and Greco, the attitude of the Berlusconi IV government over the EU was &quot;particularly erratic&quot;, pointing to the Union from time to time as a mandatory external constraint, the cause of national evils, or the only source of salvation. This volatility led to the projection of an image of an unreliable Italy in Europe.
Frattini and Italian diplomacy also lost the initiative in proposing themselves in Europe as an engine or co-star of pro-integration coalitions, dealing with Europe only in an &quot;occasional and distracted&quot; manner, and rather caring for important bilateral relations (with Russia and Turkey, for example), regardless of the international and European context, according to a &quot;small cabotage&quot; policy. All of this, coupled with the Merkel-Sarkozy duo&#x27;s inclination to leave other actors out, led to Italy&#x27;s exclusion from the main European policy initiatives.
This deficit of attention to the European Union, resulting in a growing isolation, has also had implications in other areas of foreign policy: the difficulties in relations with the United States, for example, are traced by Colombo and Greco to the widespread overseas perception of a growing marginalization of Italy in the European context.

===Controversies===
During the Russian invasion of Georgia in the summer of 2008, Frattini was on vacation in the Maldives. The representation of Italy during the urgent meetings of EU foreign ministers was ensured by the undersecretary Vincenzo Scotti. While at the end of December 2008, during Israel&#x27;s war on Gaza (Operation Cast Lead), Frattini was on holiday again. Frattini&#x27;s live interview with TG1 in a skiing suit raised controversy over inappropriate and disrespectful clothing.

In November 2010, Frattini dubbed the WikiLeaks revelations as the &quot;September 11 of diplomacy&quot; and stated that Julian Assange &quot;wants to destroy the world&quot;. The U.S. ambassador in Italy, Ronald Spogli, informed Washington, in a confidential cable distributed by WikiLeaks, of how Berlusconi &quot;constantly refuses the strategic advice of his Foreign Ministry, demoralized, devoid of resources and increasingly irrelevant&quot;. Frattini&#x27;s weakness was detected by the United States particularly with regard to Italian-Russian relations.

==Later activities==

In 2011 Frattini was briefly president of the Alcide De Gasperi Foundation and from 2011 he was president of the Italian Society for International Organization (SIOI), an emanation of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Frattini was the first politician to hold SIOI chairmanship, until then reserved for diplomats and academics of the highest level. He later joined the &quot;Institute of Eurasian Studies&quot; and served as its president.

In December 2012, Frattini left the PdL, later defining the leadership of the new party, Forza Italia, as &quot;extremists&quot;. In 2012, Frattini received the honorary citizenship of the city of Tirana.

Frattini did not run for the 2013 Italian general election,
while supporting the &quot;Agenda Monti&quot; and Scelta Civica.
Frattini later recovered his position as a member of the judiciary and Chamber President of the Italian Council of State.

Since 2013, Frattini was a consultant to the Serbian government of Aleksandar Vučić for the European integration of Serbia, succeeding Dominique Strauss-Kahn and Alfred Gusenbauer.

Since 2014, Frattini was a member of the high court of sports justice of CONI, a court of last resort of the Italian sports system. He exercised his function as judge for the Parma case, decreeing in May 2014 that the Emilian soccer team could not play in the Europa League.

In May 2014, Frattini was awarded an honorary degree from the Diplomatic Academy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation for his commitment to the development of “mutual understanding and relations” between Italy and Russia.

Frattini was a candidate to succeed Anders Fogh Rasmussen for the post of NATO&#x27;s secretary general in October 2014, but the post was given to Jens Stoltenberg.

In 2018, on the occasion of the Italian presidency of the OSCE, Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano appointed Frattini as &quot;Special representative of the OSCE presidency for the process of resolving the conflict in Transnistria&quot;. Among his credentials, Frattini said: &quot;I have excellent relations with the Russian authorities, which undoubtedly played a fundamental role in the resolution [of the conflict] in Transnistria,&quot; in addition to reminding all of his own role in starting the process of liberalization of Schengen visas for Moldova.

In 2020, while holding a sport judge position in the trial of the doping case of PRC swimmer Sun Yang, it was revealed that Frattimi had made comments about dog meat eating in China and used derogatory terms against the Chinese people on social media over a number of years. Concerns over his anti-China bias persuaded the federal court that Frattini should not have presided over banning the PRC swimmer.

As of September 2020, he was a member of the Italian Aspen Institute.

==Positions==
Interviewed by &quot;Reuters&quot; in 2007, Frattini said it was his intention to investigate technical possibilities for implementing internet monitoring of &quot;dangerous words&quot; such as &quot;bombs&quot;, &quot;killing&quot;, &quot;genocide&quot;, and &quot;terrorism&quot;. The project did not see the light of day.

In 2007, Frattini was censured by the European Parliament for his statements against the freedom of movement of people in the EU. In the interview granted and published on 2 November 2007, Frattini stressed that, to respond to the security problem, &quot;what is to be done is simple: you go to a nomad camp in Rome, for example on the Christopher Columbus, and to those who are there you ask&quot; what&#x27;s your life? If all year &#x27;I do not know&#x27;, you take it and send it back to Romania. This is how the European directive works: simple and without escape.&quot; The motion of censure, presented by the European left, was voted to a large extent: 306 yes, 86 no, and 37 abstentions.

In March 2009, Frattini condemned the 2009 Durban Review Conference, terming the final document unacceptable, since it included positions that emerged in the 2001 conference, which qualified Zionism as a form of racism.

Frattini later made declarations against multiculturalism,
but in favour of the administrative vote for regular migrants, and pleaded for a common European policy on migration.

In November 2009, he called &quot;suggestive&quot; Roberto Castelli&#x27;s proposal for a constitutional amendment to include a cross in the Italian flag: &quot;For now we wish to defend the right to keep the crucifix in our [school] classes, later we&#x27;ll see if we can do more.&quot; He added: &quot;There are nine European countries that have the cross in their flag, it&#x27;s an absolutely normal proposal.&quot;

On 22 October 2010, he declared to the &quot;Osservatore Romano&quot; that Judaism, Christianity, and Islam should ally to fight atheism, which he defined, in the same interview, as a &quot;perverse phenomenon&quot; on a par with extremism. These statements raised criticisms of numerous commentators and members of UAAR, who requested his resignation. Frattini reiterated in 2017 that relativism is the third threat to Europe after religious extremism and militant secularism.

In November 2010, he defined the revelations of WikiLeaks as &quot;the 9/11 of world diplomacy&quot;. and said that Julian Assange &quot;wants to destroy the world&quot;.

Frattini died of cancer on 24 December 2022, at the age of 65.

<doc id="924747" wikidata="Q754488" url="?curid=924747" title="Liga Portugal 2">
<text>The Liga Portugal 2 (), also known as Liga Portugal Meu Super for sponsorship reasons, is the second-highest division of the Portuguese football league system. At the end of each season, the two top-finishing teams are promoted to the top-tier Liga Portugal and the two lowest-ranked teams are relegated to the third-tier league. Starting with the 2021–22 season, relegated teams will no longer compete in the Campeonato de Portugal, which will become the fourth tier, but in a newly created third-level competition named Liga 3 (League 3).

The division began in 1990 as the Segunda Divisão de Honra (Second Division of Honour), a unified national tier, superseding the regionalized Segunda Divisão (Second Division) as the second tier of Portuguese football. When the division came under the auspices of the Liga Portuguesa de Futebol Profissional (LPFP) in 1999, it was renamed the Segunda Liga (Second League), a name that was kept until 2016, except between 2005 and 2012, when it was known as the Liga de Honra (League of Honour). Rebranded as LigaPro in 2016, the competition assumed its current naming in the early stages of the 2020–21 season.

As of the 2018–19 season, it is contested nationwide by 18 teams, including the reserve sides (B teams) of several top-flight clubs. Twenty different teams have won the division title; the most successful is Paços de Ferreira, with four wins, including the inaugural season and the most recently concluded 2018–19 season.

== History ==
Before 1990, there was only one professional nationwide football league in Portugal, the &quot;Primeira Divisão&quot; (First Division). Lower placed teams were relegated to the &quot;Segunda Divisão&quot; (Second Division), a regional league, while the top teams from that league were promoted to the First Division. Starting with the 1990–91 season, a new second-tier professional league was created, taking the name &quot;Segunda Divisão de Honra&quot;, while the previous &quot;Segunda Divisão&quot; became the third-tier league and was renamed &quot;Segunda Divisão B&quot;.

In 1999, the Portuguese League for Professional Football (LPFP) took control of the two nationwide levels and renamed the league &quot;Segunda Liga&quot; (Second League), while in 2005 it was renamed &quot;Liga de Honra&quot; and the &quot;Segunda Divisão B&quot; reverted to its original name. In 2012, the second tier of Portuguese football was renamed again &quot;Segunda Liga&quot; and in 2016 it was renamed &quot;LigaPro&quot;.

== Format ==
In the 2016–17 season, there were 22 clubs in the Segunda Liga (24 in the seasons before). Then the number of teams was reduced every season until it reached 18 teams in the 2018–19 season.
During the course of a season, each club plays every other team twice — once at their home stadium and once at their opponent&#x27;s — for a total of 34 games. At the end of each season, the two top teams are promoted to the Liga Portugal and the two lowest ranked teams will be relegated to the new Liga 3 (previously they were relegated to Campeonato de Portugal). There will be also a two-legged promotion/relegation play-off involving the 16th placed teams of Primeira Liga and 3rd placed team from Liga Portugal 2. The B teams cannot be promoted to Liga Portugal but can be demoted if they end the season in one of the relegation positions or if the main team is also relegated.

== Broadcasting ==
Since 2018–19, all the matches are broadcast by Sport TV, though some of them are only broadcast through online streaming. The exceptions are Benfica B and Porto B home games, broadcast by Benfica TV and Porto Canal.

==All-time table==
The all-time Liga Portugal 2 table is an overall record of all match results, points, and goals of every team that has played in Liga Portugal 2 since its inception in 1990. The table is accurate as of the end of the 2023–24 season. 2019–20 league standings are not attributed due to the competition being abandoned. For comparison, older seasons have been calculated according to the three-points-per-win rule.

<text>The Peristeri Olympic Boxing Hall is an indoor arena that is located in Peristeri, west Athens. The hall was the site of the boxing events at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. The venue originally seated 8,400, though it had a public capacity of only 5,600 for the 2004 Olympics.

==History==
After the 2004 Summer Olympics, the indoor facility was partially converted into a 3,000 seat outdoor football pitch. This lowered the seating capacity of the indoor arena from 8,400 to 2,305. The indoor arena has since been mainly used for gymnastics competitions, and at times to host basketball games of the Greek club Peristeri.

Since the summer of 2007, the outdoor association football pitch has been used as a training center by the Greek club Atromitos.

<doc id="924751" wikidata="Q17158822" url="?curid=924751" title="Refund anticipation loan">
<text>Refund anticipation loan (RAL) is a short-term consumer loan in the United States provided by a third party against an expected tax refund for the duration it takes the tax authority to pay the refund. The loan term was usually about two to three weeks, related to the time it took the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to deposit refunds in electronic accounts. The loans were designed to make the refund available in as little as 24 hours. They were secured by a taxpayer&#x27;s expected tax refund, and designed to offer customers quicker access to funds.

The costs to the borrower could be significant compared to other lending and some consumer organizations warned consumers of the risk involved in this type of loan. They are a largely discontinued financial product and beginning with the 2013 tax filing season, they have been largely replaced with the similar refund anticipation checks (RAC), as well as a hodge podge of other financial products.

RACs are temporary accounts which wait for the client&#x27;s IRS tax refund, and which also provides a way for the client to pay for tax preparation out of the refund. Both financial products have similar fees and similar risks of third-party bank &quot;cross-collection&quot;.

A similar process in Canada to a RAL is termed &quot;tax rebate discounting&quot;.

==United States==
In the United States prior to the 2013 tax filing season, taxpayers could apply for a refund anticipation loan through a paid professional tax preparation service, where a fee is typically charged for the preparation of the tax return. Internal Revenue Service rules prohibit basing this fee on the amount of the expected refund. An additional fee was usually charged for the services of originating a bank product and establishing a short-term bank account. By law this fee must be the same on both loan and non-loan bank products, and in 2004 the average fee was $32. The bank through which the loan was made charges finance charges.

According to the National Consumer Law Center, 12 million taxpayers used a RAL in 2004. With e-filing and IRS partnerships that help consumers e-file for free, U.S. taxpayers can generally receive their tax refunds within three weeks and sometimes as quickly as ten to fourteen days if they choose to receive their refund via direct deposit. As of 2017, 70% of US taxpayers have access to free e-file and tax preparation services. This rendered RALs less attractive to some.

==History==
Refund advance loans began in 1985 when Ronald Smith, an accountant in Virginia Beach, VA started the practice of at his accounting firm, Action Accounting &amp; Taxes. This service of loans-on-tax-refunds was advertised in the local area between 1985 and 1987. The refund advance loans became a success from the start and a sensation in the area in 1986 and 1987 and was the first and only firm in the United States that was offering that service according to the IRS.

In 1986 a salesman from Charlie Falk&#x27;s Auto asked if they could make an arrangement where Action Accounting &amp; Taxes could prepare taxes for customers seeking to purchase cars in order to supplement their down payments on used or new car purchases. The practice of tax refunds being used in conjunction with car financing quickly spread throughout the area and then throughout the entire United States.

John Hewitt purchased Mel Jackson&#x27;s Tax Service and began to offer refund anticipation loans in 1988, building a national franchise out of the idea: Jackson Hewitt Tax Service. In 1989 H &amp; R Block joined in, coopting into thousands of accounting firms and tax practices across the United States and becoming a billion-dollar industry. It was reported in 1989 that H &amp; R Block had doubled its business at over 4,000 locations due to the introduction of this new refund loan service.

Refund advance loans spread to Canada through Liberty Tax Service and in time this company also moved into the United States market offering the same service. The proliferation of this tax loan practice coincided with the introduction of electronic filing by the IRS. Previous to this time refunds would take on average two to three months to come back from the IRS which is why loans on tax refund are also known as refund anticipations loans.

In 1988, Ronald Smith as well as Mr. Coplon were jointly sued by the Attorney General of Virginia in a Richmond state court for charging usurious interest. Ronald Smith was eventually dismissed from the case and it was reported by the State&#x27;s Attorney at the time that the reason for his dismissal from the case was that Mr. Smith was &quot;not culpable&quot;.

A tax preparer would, within 24 hours of submission, receive from the IRS confirmation that the submission was free of mathematical errors, and that the filer had no liens or delinquent federal student loans. This meant that there was good chance that the IRS would pay the refund within weeks, barring fraudulent income reporting. At that point the preparer would issue the filer a check for the amount of the expected refund minus a commission. In 1995, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Beneficial&#x27;s $30 electronic filing fee and $59 loan fee amounted to a 250 percent APR on a refund of $1,000.

Exploitation of the system had begun by the early 1990s; filers misreported their income to inflate their refund. As a result of this, and also to discourage filers from this rather uneconomical offer, in 1994 the IRS stopped providing tax preparers with a confirmation that a deposit would take place for a certain amount and that it would begin sending refunds directly to taxpayers instead of banks that made the loan, but not having the desired effects, the confirmations were re-instated the following year.

==Controversy==
According to the Consumer Federation of America and the National Consumer Law Center, RALs are controversial because, like payday loans and title loans, RALs are high-profit, low-risk loans marketed toward the working poor. A 2006 study by the NCLC and the Consumer Federation of America found that &quot;Based upon the prices for RALs in 2006, a consumer can expect to pay about $100 in order to get a RAL for the average refund of about $2,150 from a commercial tax preparation chain this year&quot;.

Opponents of RALs, like the National Consumer Law Center, argue that the profit motive of the lender results in RALs being issued too often to low-income individuals who are made to believe the wait for their refund is longer than it really is, who do not realize they are taking a loan, do not understand the high interest rates charged by the loan (often exceeding 100% APR until the last two tax filing seasons), and who do not actually need the funds immediately.

==Third-party cross-collection of bank debt (&quot;previous debt&quot;) for both RALs and RACs==
As part of applying for both financial products, the client is directing his or her refund to the account-issuing bank. Cross-collection occurs in cases where the bank uses this occasion to collect debt owed another bank. As the IRS Taxpayer Advocate described the practice in 2006: &quot;if a taxpayer owes money on a defaulted RAL to Bank A and subsequently attempts to buy another RAL from Bank B, Bank B is authorized to collect the outstanding debt from the RAL proceeds, transmit the funds to Bank A&quot;. It is somewhat unclear how broad is the type of debt for which banks cross-collect. This practice is often not adequately disclosed to the tax preparation client. As a lawsuit filing against H&amp;R Block by the California Attorney General in February 2006 stated, &quot;H&amp;R Block does not adequately tell such customers about any alleged debts, or that when they sign the new RAL application, they agree to automatic debt collection—including collection on alleged RAL-related debts from other tax preparers or banks. These applications are denied, and the customer&#x27;s anticipated refund is used to pay off the debt, plus a fee&quot;. Tax prep firms often vaguely refer to this practice merely as &quot;previous debt&quot;.

This risk exists even if the client is only using the RAC account for purposes of taking the tax preparation fees out of the refund.

==Jan. 2011: IRS will not be providing &quot;debt indicator&quot;==
On August 5, 2010, the IRS announced that for the upcoming 2011 tax filing season, the agency would no longer be providing preparers and associated financial institutions with the &quot;debt indicator&quot; (a one-letter code that discloses whether or not the taxpayer owes back taxes and whether or not the taxpayer owes federally collected obligations such as child support, student loans, etc.).

Taxpayers themselves will continue to have access to information about their refund through the &quot;Where&#x27;s My Refund?&quot; feature at the irs.gov website.

In the same news release, the IRS stated it was exploring ways to allow filers to directly split off part of the refund to pay for professional tax preparation, possibly starting in January 2012. The IRS is asking for input from filers, consumer advocates, and those in the tax preparation community regarding whether this would be cost-effective.

==Jan. 2013: Major U.S. banks stop offering RALs==
Beginning with the 2013 tax season, major U.S. banks will no longer be offering RALs. They will instead be offering the similar financial products of RACs, which are not loans but are rather temporary accounts which sit empty waiting for the client&#x27;s IRS refund.

<doc id="924756" wikidata="Q253259" url="?curid=924756" title="Floor Jansen">
<text>Floor Jansen (; born 21 February 1981) is a Dutch singer and songwriter. She is the third and current lead vocalist of Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish.

Jansen first became known as the lead vocalist of symphonic metal band After Forever from 1997, when she joined at age 16, to their disbanding in 2009. When After Forever disbanded, she formed ReVamp and has released two albums with them. In 2012 following the departure of their lead vocalist Anette Olzon, Nightwish brought in Jansen as a touring member until the end of their Imaginaerum World Tour. In 2013, they announced Jansen was now their full-time lead vocalist; she subsequently disbanded ReVamp to focus on Nightwish. In 2018, she and Pagan&#x27;s Mind guitarist Jørn Viggo Lofstad premiered their hard rock duo Northward.

A frequent collaborator of Arjen Anthony Lucassen, Jansen is a member of his progressive metal supergroup Star One, and sang in the Ayreon albums &quot;Universal Migrator Part 1: The Dream Sequencer&quot;, &quot;01011001&quot;, and &quot;The Source&quot;, as well as the live album &quot;Ayreon Universe – The Best of Ayreon Live&quot;. She also sang lead vocals in several songs of the MaYan album &quot;Quarterpast&quot; and in Avalon&#x27;s &quot;Angels of the Apocalypse&quot;. She is the older sister of fellow singer Irene Jansen, who also worked with Ayreon.
==Biography==

===After Forever (1997–2009)===

Jansen was sixteen when she joined Apocalypse (later known as After Forever) in 1997. Three years later the band released its first album, &quot;Prison of Desire&quot;. She co-wrote the band&#x27;s words and music with Mark Jansen (no relation) until he left in 2002, after which she was the band&#x27;s sole composer. Before becoming a full-time musician, she worked as a singing teacher.

Because of the burnout that After Forever bandmate Sander Gommans underwent, the band took a year off starting in January 2008 but ultimately decided to call it quits in February 2009. Jansen posted on her website that she was writing music with Jørn Viggo Lofstad (Pagan&#x27;s Mind, Jørn Lande) for a new musical project, but the two did not publish as Northward until ten years later.

===ReVamp (2009–2016)===

On 17 October 2009, Jansen announced via MySpace that the name of her new band was ReVamp. ReVamp&#x27;s first album was produced with After Forever keyboardist Joost van den Broek, bass player Jaap Melman (formerly of Dreadlock Pussy) and guitarist Waldemar Sorychta (Grip Inc., Voodoocult, Eyes of Eden and Despair) as songwriters and producers. The final line-up of ReVamp featured keyboardist Ruben Wijga, bass player Jaap Melman, guitarists Jord Otto and Arjan Rijnen and drummer Matthias Landes.

In August 2011, Van Canto announced on Facebook, that ReVamp would no longer participate in their &quot;Out of the Dark&quot; tour, as Jansen suffered a burnout herself.

In late 2011, Jansen joined her former bandmate Mark Jansen in his band Mayan&#x27;s Latin American tour, performing in São Paulo. In 2012, Jansen joined Adrenaline Mob on stage in Bochum and Weert. ReVamp&#x27;s second album, &quot;Wild Card,&quot; was released in 2013.

ReVamp announced its breakup in September 2016, citing Floor Jansen&#x27;s inability to participate fully in both ReVamp and Nightwish.

===Nightwish (2012–present)===
After Nightwish&#x27;s previous lead vocalist Anette Olzon parted ways with the band, Jansen acted as Nightwish&#x27;s live lead vocalist for the remainder of the &quot;Imaginaerum World Tour&quot; in 2012. Her first show with the band was in Seattle in October. When commenting on the experience, she said:


On 9 October 2013, Nightwish announced Jansen as Olzon&#x27;s permanent replacement in the band. In 2015, Nightwish released their first studio album featuring Jansen as the lead vocalist, which was &quot;Endless Forms Most Beautiful&quot;. The second studio album with Jansen as lead vocalist, &quot;Human. :II: Nature.&quot;, was released on 10 April 2020. The third studio album with Jansen as lead vocalist, &quot;Yesterwynde&quot;, was released on 20 September 2024.
=== Solo career (2020–present) ===
Jansen performed her first solo concert in January 2020. Due to the restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, the final shows of the tour had to be postponed, and finally took place in summer 2021. On 2 August 2021, Jansen had confirmed in an interview that she is working on a solo album. The album has been aimed for a 2023 release. Jansen released her first single &quot;Fire&quot; on 25 March 2022. Her second solo single, &quot;Storm&quot;, was released on 27 May 2022. Her third solo single, &quot;Me Without You&quot;, was released on 8 September 2022. The fourth solo single called &quot;Invincible&quot; was released on 13 January 2023. The album, called &quot;Paragon&quot; was released on 24 March 2023.

Jansen was the opening act for Metallica in Amsterdam on 29 April 2023 at the last minute, when American heavy metal band Five Finger Death Punch had canceled their appearance that night.

=== Other works ===
Three albums by the Dutch composer and multi-instrumentalist Arjen Anthony Lucassen&#x27;s project Ayreon include guest vocals from Jansen: she sang backing vocals on &quot;My House on Mars&quot; from the album &quot;Universal Migrator Part 1: The Dream Sequencer&quot;, played the character of Forever, referred to as Ω, (Coincidentally, Jansen used the Ω symbol as an emblem for her band Revamp, and she has the symbol tattooed on her wrist) on seven songs from the album &quot;01011001&quot;, and was featured as a character named The Biologist on the album &quot;The Source&quot;. She is also a member of Lucassen&#x27;s heavy metal supergroup Star One, and was featured on the studio albums &quot;Space Metal&quot; and &quot;Victims of the Modern Age&quot;. She was also featured in the 2018 live album &quot;Ayreon Universe – The Best of Ayreon Live&quot;.

On 9 December 2013, she was also announced as the main vocalist, playing the lead role, for the second full-length album of former Stratovarius guitarist Timo Tolkki&#x27;s metal opera act Avalon. The album, &quot;Angels of the Apocalypse&quot;, was released on 16 May 2014. She has also been a guest for the metal band Nightmare.

On 22 February 2018, Northward, a hard rock project by Jansen and Pagan&#x27;s Mind guitarist Jørn Viggo Lofstad, was unveiled. The two created the project in 2007, writing an entire album worth of music in 2008 but being unable to record previously due to their busy schedules; they ultimately reunited in 2017 to finally record the album, which was released on 19 October 2018 under their signed label Nuclear Blast. The album features a duet between Jansen and her sister Irene.

In 2019, Jansen participated in the Dutch reality TV show &quot;Beste Zangers&quot;. In the last episode she partnered with classical singer Henk Poort to perform &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, which was later released as a single. It reached number one on the Dutch single charts, and allowed Jansen to go on a sold-out solo tour in the Netherlands. She also won the Popprijs 2019, a prestigious Dutch award for the artist or band with an important contribution to Dutch pop music in the past year. Among her other performances for &quot;Beste Zangers&quot; was a solo version of &quot;Shallow&quot;, and a separate acoustic duet version of the same song with Tim Akkerman. In 2022, she performed in the German version of &quot;Beste Zangers&quot;: &quot;Sing meinen Song - Das Tauschkonzert&quot;.

==Personal life==
Jansen is vegetarian. As a child, she wanted to be a biologist; coincidentally, she played the character &quot;The Biologist&quot; in the Ayreon album &quot;The Source&quot;. In 2018, a new species of beetle was discovered by scientist Andreas Weigel and named &quot;Tmesisternus floorjansenae&quot; after Jansen. Jansen thereby became the second Nightwish member to be a namesake for a newly discovered species, following Tuomas Holopainen, after whom had been named a species of fungus gnat discovered in 2017 by Finnish biologist Jukka Salmela. In 2020, a new species of brittle star, &quot;Ophiomitrella floorae&quot; of the late Maastrichtian age (c. 66.7 Ma), was named after her.

Jansen is over six feet tall, but she has said that she does not understand people&#x27;s fascination with her height.

Between 2014 and 2015, Jansen lived in Joensuu, the capital of North Karelia.

Jansen was previously in a relationship with After Forever guitarist Sander Gommans. On 18 September 2016, it was announced that Jansen and her husband, Sabaton drummer Hannes Van Dahl, were expecting their first child. On 15 March 2017, Jansen announced via Instagram that she had given birth to a girl. On 20 October 2023, she announced the birth of their second daughter.

On 26 October 2022, Jansen announced that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer, undergoing surgery the following day. Two days following the announcement, Jansen confirmed that the surgery had gone well. On 18 November, Jansen announced that she was now cancer free.

==Singing style==
Jansen can sing from classical to belting and raspy vocals like screaming and death growls. She is a soprano with a range of more than three octaves (C3 to F6).

Jansen started studying music at the Dutch Rock Academy in 1999, entering the Conservatorium Tilburg three years later. She studied musical theatre and a year of opera. When After Forever split up, she started teaching, performing in her own course called &quot;Wanna be a Star?!&quot;

She used to play the guitar, piano and flute and has completed several years of music studies.

<doc id="924757" wikidata="Q5651141" url="?curid=924757" title="Borat Sagdiyev">
<text>Borat Margaret Sagdiyev (, ) is a satirical fictional character created and performed by Sacha Baron Cohen. Depicted as a Kazakh television journalist, the character serves as the main protagonist of the mockumentary &quot;Borat! Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan&quot; (2006) and its sequel &quot;Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan&quot; (2020), and a main character of &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot;.

Borat&#x27;s humour arises from his espousal of outrageous sociocultural viewpoints, his violation of social taboos, and his use of vulgar language and behaviour in inappropriate settings. Most often the comedy relies on Borat&#x27;s obliviousness to First World natives not sharing his regressive worldview, but occasionally Borat&#x27;s innocent and collegial demeanor will provoke his targets to reveal biases they would otherwise be reluctant to share publicly. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; put the 2006 film on its end-of-the-decade &quot;best-of&quot; list, saying, &quot;The Kazakhstani journalist gave us some of the most incisive cultural commentary ever filmed. That, and a wrestling match between butt-naked men. Something for everyone.&quot;

==Origins==
The character was first developed for the purpose of short skits on &quot;F2F&quot; on Granada Talk TV that Baron Cohen presented in 1996–1997, with the character at this time being known as Alexi Krickler. The character, now known as Kristo Shqiptari, was picked by BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Comedy Nation&quot;. Alexi and Kristo were nearly identical in looks and demeanor to the later incarnation, although Alexi claimed to be Moldovan and Kristo claimed to be Albanian rather than coming from Kazakhstan. The character remained dormant while Baron Cohen concentrated on his popular Ali G persona for Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The 11 O&#x27;Clock Show&quot;, but with the subsequent success of Ali G and the creation of &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot; (also on Channel 4) Baron Cohen revisited his Borat character.

==Fictional character biography==

Borat was born and raised in the village of Kuzcek, Kazakh SSR to Maryam Tulyakbay and Boltok the Rapist (who is also stated to be his grandfather, uncle and former father-in-law until the demise of Oksana). He stated that his mother gave birth to him when she was 10 years old. She is shown as a short old lady (revealed to be 43 years old in 2005) in his 2006 film, where he gives the viewer a guided tour of his hometown. He has a (remarkably well-endowed) 13-year-old son named Hueylewis, 12-year-old twin boys named Bilak and Biram, as well as 17 grandchildren. He has a sister, Natalya, whom at different times he has described as the &quot;number four prostitute in all of Kazakhstan&quot;. Another sister who appears to be a very young teenage girl is shown at the beginning of &quot;Borat&#x27;s Guide to Britain&quot;. It has been revealed in an interview with a general practitioner that he caught syphilis from one of his sisters during a Kazakh folk festival. He also has a younger brother, Bilo, who is intellectually disabled and kept locked in a cage. Bilo was not always disabled and was shown as an average early teenage boy in &quot;Borat&#x27;s Guide to Britain&quot;. At some point, Bilo sustained brain damage during an exorcism, when another brother of Borat&#x27;s tried to release a demon from Bilo through the &quot;traditional Kazakh folk remedy&quot; of opening the skull and sticking the tooth of a red-haired woman in the brain.

Borat&#x27;s neighbours are Nursultan Tuyakbay (whom Borat considers &quot;a pain in my assholes&quot;) and Dr. Yamak, a scientist who works for the Kazakh government and claims to have proven that women have &quot;brain the size of squirrel&quot;. In &quot;Borat&#x27;s Guide to Britain&quot;, Borat and Yamak settle a dispute in the traditional Kazakh &quot;civilised way&quot; by beating each other&#x27;s genitals with a leather glove until one of them gives up.

It is unknown how many times Borat has been married, but he has had at least five wives. In &quot;Borat&#x27;s Guide to Britain&quot;, he admits to being a bigamist and has three additional lovers (two of whom he describes as his &quot;mistress&quot; and his &quot;girlfriend&quot; respectively, while he &quot;has to pay money for&quot; the third). One of his wives (Ludmilla) is said to have been shot by a hunter when he mistook her for a bear as she ploughed the fields. His bad-tempered, obese former wife, Oksana (who was also his half-sister as they had the same biological father), is reported in the &quot;Borat&quot; film to have been attacked, &quot;violated&quot; and &quot;broken&quot; by a bear while taking his brother Bilo for a walk in the forest. Borat is not saddened at all by the tragedy. He thanks the man who brings him this &quot;good news&quot; by giving him a high five and celebrates his new-found freedom by pursuing Baywatch star Pamela Anderson and eventually reunites with and marries Luenell, an African-American prostitute he met whilst filming his documentary. In the sequel, Luenell is nowhere to be seen and can be assumed to have either left Borat or died in the fourteen years since the first film. Borat goes on to ask a professional babysitter late in the film to be his &quot;new black wife&quot;, to which she politely declines.

According to various in-character interviews with Sacha Baron Cohen, Borat attended Astana University, where he studied English, journalism and plague research. He created five new plagues which &quot;killed over five million goats&quot; in Uzbekistan, the country that he has a strong hatred of. Prior to his plague research, Borat worked as an ice maker, &quot;gypsy-catcher&quot;, &quot;animal-puller&quot; (one who produces semen from animals) and computer maintenance engineer (specifically removing dead birds which had nested in the vents of computers&#x27; casings). He now works as a journalist and announcer on Kazakh television. This job helps Borat and other Kazakhs &quot;express themselves in ways they otherwise would not have been able to do&quot;.

Borat mostly speaks English during his reports. His supposed Kazakh language in some scenes is in fact a mix of Hebrew and Polish (both of which Baron Cohen has good knowledge of). Borat usually introduces himself with the term &quot;Jagshemash&quot; (&quot;Jak się masz?&quot;, meaning &quot;How are you?&quot; in Polish) and ends reports with &quot;Chenquieh&quot; (&quot;Dziękuję&quot;, meaning &quot;Thank you&quot; in Polish). He often uses the phrase &quot;Wa wa wee wa!&quot;, an expression of surprised delight which came from a skit by Dov Glickman on the popular Israeli comedy show &quot;Zehu Ze!&quot;.

Although nominally pagan most of his life, sometimes remarking that he &quot;follow[s] the hawk&quot;, during his trip to the US, he attends a Pentecostal church service and later converts his entire village to Christianity, his version of which involves crucifying Jews. Borat is a keen admirer of Joseph Stalin and claims that both he and Stalin are strong men with powerful &quot;khram&quot; (genitals). He strongly opposes women&#x27;s rights and is quite aghast upon learning that in Britain and the US, women can vote while horses cannot. He frequently comments that allowing women to vote is like &quot;allowing a monkey to drive a car&quot;. In his spare time, he enjoys playing table tennis (ping pong), sun-bathing while clad in a lime-green mankini, disco dancing, spitting, sitting on comfortable chairs, shooting dogs and taking pictures of women when they &quot;make a toilet&quot;. He also enjoys hunting Jews in his homeland. He is extremely fond of &quot;sexy time&quot;, particularly &quot;mouth-party&quot; and &quot;hand-party&quot;. Borat also states that he &quot;very much like Korki Butchek&quot; (a fictional Kazakh musician).

==Ali G==
In each episode of &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot;, Borat is shown doing satirical interviews with often unwitting subjects in the United Kingdom and the United States. The segments were shot in a low-quality video style to maintain the impression of low-quality television broadcasts in a poor country (similar to the Chanel 9 segments on &quot;The Fast Show&quot;). In &quot;Ali G Indahouse&quot;, the British Prime Minister and Ali G greet Borat who proceeds to hug and then kiss Ali G, who pushes him away in disgust.

The Borat segments on &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot; use a rock rendition of a Russian folk tune, &quot;Korobeiniki&quot;, as the theme song.

===Guide to Britain===
This was created as part of a six-part series of &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot; that was originally broadcast on Channel 4 (UK) starting in March 2000.

Five Borat sketches were shown, in the form of &quot;Guides&quot; to &quot;Etiquette&quot;, Hunting, Cambridge, Edinburgh, and Henley. The &quot;Guides&quot; to &quot;English Gentlemen&quot;, &quot;Politics&quot; and &quot;Sport&quot; were also filmed at this time but released at a later date as part of &quot;Ali G&quot; DVDs. The Cambridge sketch is the only major Borat material from this series not to have made it onto the compilation DVDs.

===Guide to USA 1===
Shown as part of a six-part &quot;Ali G Show&quot; originally on HBO (US) in February 2003. This series was screened and released in the UK as &quot;Ali G in the USA&quot;.

Six Borat sketches were shown in the form of &quot;Guides&quot; to &quot;Dating&quot;,
&quot;Etiquette&quot;, &quot;Acting&quot;, &quot;Men&quot;, &quot;Baseballs&quot; and &quot;The (Deep) South&quot;. A &quot;Guide to Animals&quot; was filmed but released at a later date as part of an &quot;Ali G&quot; DVD.

===Guide to USA 2===
Shown as part of a six-part &quot;Ali G Show&quot; originally on HBO (US) in July 2004. (Channel 4 was the UK channel where Ali G and Borat originally appeared, and the series for America was a joint HBO/Channel 4 co-production). This series was re-edited for the UK to remove all the Ali G material, becoming two prime-time &quot;Borat&#x27;s Television Programme&quot; specials for Channel 4. These specials also embodied the Brüno segments from the series and Borat&#x27;s &quot;Guide To Hunting&quot;, not screened in the US version. The uncut second series as it appeared on HBO was later given a UK courtesy transmission on digital channel E4.

Six Borat sketches were shown in the form of &quot;Guides&quot; to &quot;Wine Tasting&quot;, &quot;Politics&quot;, &quot;Country Music&quot;, &quot;Hobbies&quot;, &quot;Buying a House&quot; and &quot;Jobs&quot; (careers), with &quot;Hunting&quot; airing in the UK only.

==Films==

===&quot;Ali G Indahouse&quot;===
Borat had a small cameo role in Baron Cohen&#x27;s film &quot;Ali G Indahouse&quot; as a Kazakhstani diplomat.

===&quot;Borat&quot;===
Subtitled &quot;Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan&quot;, the film &quot;Borat&quot; is a mockumentary comedy. Most of those appearing in the film are not paid performers, but real people whom Borat met on his journey. The film was distributed by 20th Century Fox, and directed by Larry Charles. It premiered at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival, and was released across Europe on 2 November 2006 and North America on 3 November 2006.

The film follows Borat in his travels across the United States, as he commits cultural and exposes a few American ones. Over the course of the film, Borat falls in love with Pamela Anderson after watching a rerun of &quot;Baywatch&quot;, and vows to make her his wife.

The film opened at No. 1 in the U.S., taking in $26.4 million on a limited release of 837 screens during its first weekend, beating &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; as the biggest opening weekend for a film released in fewer than 1,000 cinemas. Baron Cohen celebrated the release of the film with a host of promotional in-character interviews. The film expanded its release on the second weekend to 2,566 screens, where it took in an additional $29 million.

In 2007, Baron Cohen won a Golden Globe for &quot;Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical Or Comedy&quot;. With a production budget of $18,000,000 the film has grossed $128,501,044 in the United States of America and another $128,848,505 internationally, for a worldwide gross of $257,349,549 by mid-March 2007.

===&quot;Borat Subsequent Moviefilm&quot;===
In 2020, Baron Cohen filmed several pranks for a sequel film, a mockumentary comedy just like the first film.

Since the end of the previous film, Borat was sentenced to a labor camp for the dishonor he had inflicted on his country. The sequel follows Borat as he is ordered to deliver a monkey, and later his daughter to Mike Pence, and later Rudy Giuliani. Borat then goes back to Kazakhstan in defeat, however, realizes that the Kazakh government has deliberately infected the world with coronavirus and is paid to keep the secret and is forgiven. The film ends with a message encouraging viewers to vote in the then-upcoming US presidential election.

==Book==
In 2007, Baron Cohen released a book titled &quot;Touristic Guidings to Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan/Touristic Guidings to Minor Nation of U.S. and A.&quot;, with humour about both countries in a similar vein to the movie.

|-
|style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;|Notes:
In 2007, Sacha Baron Cohen stated that the character of Borat, alongside his Ali G character, would be retired. Borat&#x27;s last appearances were at &quot;Night of Too Many Stars: An Overbooked Event for Autism Education 2006&quot; television special and an online public service announcement ahead of the 2008 United States elections. However, in 2016, to promote the trailer release of his film &quot;Grimsby&quot;, Baron Cohen appeared in character as Borat on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; He then made an appearance on the show on 7 November 2018 as a part of a guest appearance by Baron Cohen to promote his show &quot;Who Is America?&quot; In 2020, Baron Cohen officially rekindled Borat with the filming of &quot;Borat Subsequent Moviefilm&quot;, which was released on 23 October 2020, introducing the character of Borat&#x27;s daughter Tutar Sagdiyev, portrayed by Maria Bakalova.

==In other films==
Borat himself was parodied in the critically panned 2007 parody film &quot;Epic Movie&quot; and was played by Danny Jacobs.

==Criticism and controversy==
===Criticized as unfair smear against Kazakhstan===
There have been arguments that the film&#x27;s portrayal of the people of Kazakhstan is unfair and unjustified.

On 19 October 2006, the BBC reported that Kazakhstan&#x27;s Deputy Foreign Minister, Rakhat Aliyev, had invited Baron Cohen to visit Kazakhstan to see how inaccurate his portrayals were. In an interview, Aliyev asserted that &quot;His trip could yield a lot of discoveries—that women not only travel inside buses but also drive their own cars, that we make wine from grapes, that Jews can freely attend synagogues and so on.&quot;

===Denigration of Roma===
Borat&#x27;s movie has been accused of promoting antiziganism. The film has been criticised for several scenes portraying Borat&#x27;s fictional &quot;Kazakh&quot; village which were actually filmed in the impoverished Roma village of Glod in Romania. &quot;USA Today&quot; reports that poverty-stricken villagers were offered between $3.30 and $5.50 to bring animals into their houses and other gag scenes for the movie that some people described as humiliating. The studio contends that participants were paid double the rate recommended by the Romanian film office for extras. Additionally, Baron Cohen personally donated $5,000 to the village, as well as computers and school supplies.

Two villagers of Glod hired controversial reparation attorney Ed Fagan to sue the makers of the film for $30 million for human rights abuses. Fagan intended to submit lawsuits in New York and Florida state courts, as well as in Frankfurt, Germany. Fagan said that he hoped to &quot;teach Hollywood a very expensive lesson.&quot; The lawsuit was thrown out by U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in a hearing in early December 2006 on the ground that the charges were too vague to stand up in court. Fagan planned to refile, but has since been disbarred.

===Denigration of Jews===
The Borat character has been accused of anti-Semitism but Baron Cohen, himself a Jew, has explained that the segments are a &quot;dramatic demonstration of how racism feeds on dumb conformity, as much as rabid bigotry.&quot; &quot;Borat essentially works as a tool. By himself pretending to be anti-Semitic, he lets people lower their guard and expose their own prejudice,&quot; Baron Cohen explained to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;finally_speaks/page/2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Baron Cohen, the grandson of a Holocaust survivor, says he wishes in particular to expose the role of indifference:

(The exact line from Kershaw&#x27;s 1983 book &quot;Popular Opinion and Political Dissent in the Third Reich&quot; was that &quot;the road to Auschwitz was built by hate, but paved with indifference&quot;.)

However, the Anti-Defamation League, a United States–based group that &quot;...combat[s] anti-Semitism and bigotry of all kinds&quot;, complained to HBO after Borat performed his country and western song &quot;In My Country There Is Problem&quot;. It called on people to &quot;throw the Jew down the well&quot;, warning that &quot;you must be careful of his teeth&quot; and that &quot;you must grab him by his money&quot;, and was welcomed with applause and participation by some members of an audience in Tucson, Arizona. The full chorus goes: &quot;Throw the Jew down the well / So my country can be free / You must grab him by his horns / Then we have a big party.&quot; Regarding the enthusiastic response to &quot;In My Country There Is Problem&quot;, he says, &quot;Did it reveal that they were anti-Semitic? Perhaps. But maybe it just revealed that they were indifferent to anti-Semitism.&quot;

In another scene, Borat visits the Serengeti Range ranch in Texas, where the owner of the ranch, Gene Gordon confides that he believes the Holocaust was a necessity for Germany. He further implies that he would have no moral qualms about running a ranch where people can hunt, in Borat&#x27;s words, &quot;deer...then Jew.&quot;

An interview with James Broadwater, an evangelical Christian and Republican candidate for the United States&#x27; Congress from Mississippi, caused Broadwater to receive some hate emails after an episode of &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot; aired in which Broadwater stated that all non-Christians (including Jews) will go to Hell. He was told that the interview would be played in foreign countries to teach others about the American political system. Broadwater later posted a letter on his website denouncing &quot;Da Ali G Show,&quot; explaining that his statement referred to a theological belief that anyone that &quot;accepts Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour will spend eternity in Heaven, while everyone who rejects Him will spend eternity in Hell.&quot; Broadwater did not apologise for his comments. Instead, he insisted that &quot;the liberal, anti-God media needs to be brought under the strict control of the FCC, and that as soon as possible.&quot;

In the film, Borat continues his anti-Semitic stance. When he mentions his decision to avoid flying while in America, Borat says that his colleague &quot;insists we not fly in case the Jews repeat their attack of 9/11&quot;. Later, he finds himself in a bed &amp; breakfast run by a kind elderly Jewish couple. He tries to &quot;escape&quot;, and throws money at two woodlice that have crawled into his room, apparently believing that the Jewish hosts have shapeshifted into the tiny woodlice. He was amazed that they had managed to look human, and states that one &quot;can hardly see their horns&quot;. Borat is completely oblivious to his hosts&#x27; religious beliefs or ethnicity when he first meets them, despite how obvious it is: the man wears a kippah and the woman openly displays her paintings of Jewish people all over the house. Borat does not understand until the woman explicitly states to him: &quot;I&#x27;m Jewish.&quot;

The film has enjoyed particular success in Israel because Israeli filmgoers understand what Borat is really saying when he is supposedly spouting Kazakh: throughout the film, Borat speaks fluent Hebrew with some phrases in Polish, and his assistant speaks Armenian.

===Views on the Iraq War===
On 7 January 2005, after convincing the authorities that he was shooting a documentary film, Baron Cohen managed to infuriate a crowd at a rodeo in Salem, Virginia. Even though the crowd first cheered at the beginning of his statements of support for the Iraq War:

He then went on to sing an out-of-tune rendition of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; with the lyrics replaced by those of the fictitious &quot;Kazakh national anthem&quot; &quot;O Kazakhstan&quot; used at the end of the film (composed by Erran Baron Cohen), beginning with &quot;Kazakhstan, greatest country in the world / All other countries are run by little girls...&quot;

The crowd was not pleased. One witness stated that &quot;if he [Baron Cohen] had been out there a minute longer, I think somebody would have shot him [...] people were booing him, flipping him off.&quot; For his own safety, Baron Cohen was escorted from the venue (much of the event appears in the movie). A credible news report about the incident, aired on a local television station, is included in the DVD extras.

<text>James Edward Carr (June 13, 1942 – January 7, 2001) was an American R&amp;B and soul singer, described as &quot;one of the greatest pure vocalists that deep Southern soul ever produced&quot;.

==Biography==
Born to a Baptist preacher&#x27;s family in Coahoma, Mississippi, he moved with his parents to Memphis, Tennessee, at the age of three. Carr began singing in church, and performed in gospel groups including the Harmony Echoes, at the same time as making tables on an assembly line in Memphis. After being turned down by Stax, he made his first recordings for Goldwax Records, a small Memphis-based independent record label, in 1964. He released several singles for the label before achieving his first success in 1966, when &quot;You&#x27;ve Got My Mind Messed Up&quot; reached number 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart and number 63 on the pop chart. He also released the successful and critically acclaimed album &quot;You Got My Mind Messed Up&quot;.

Carr continued to have chart entries with his later singles on Goldwax, including &quot;Pouring Water on a Drowning Man&quot;, but his greatest success and most critically acclaimed performance came in 1967 with his original recording of &quot;The Dark End of the Street&quot;, written by Dan Penn and Chips Moman. The song reached number 10 on the R&amp;B chart and number 77 on the pop chart. Carr continued to record for Goldwax until the label closed in 1969, but failed to reach the same heights with his subsequent releases, though &quot;A Man Needs a Woman&quot; in 1968 reached number 16 on the R&amp;B chart and number 63 on the pop chart, and he recorded an album of the same title. After Goldwax closed down in 1969, he released a single on Atlantic Records in 1971, and another on his manager Roosevelt Jamison&#x27;s River City label in 1977.

Carr suffered from bipolar disorder for most of his life. This frequently found him unable to deal with the stress of performing and touring, which became most evident during a tour of Japan in 1979 when he froze in front of an audience, following an overdose of antidepressants. Despite this he was dubbed &quot;the world&#x27;s greatest Soul Singer&quot;. However, he completed the Japan tour before returning to Memphis. Thereafter he lived with his sister but was frequently hospitalized. A resurgence in interest in his music, spurred by his portrayal in Peter Guralnick&#x27;s 1986 book &quot;Sweet Soul Music&quot;, helped return Carr to the recording studio, and he was able to complete another album, &quot;Take Me to the Limit&quot;, for a revived Goldwax label in 1991. He also performed at festivals in the US and Europe, and released another album, &quot;Soul Survivor&quot;, in 1994.

He was diagnosed with lung cancer in the mid-1990s, and died in a Memphis nursing home in 2001, aged 58.

<text>Paula Poundstone (born December 29, 1959) is an American stand-up comedian, author, actress, interviewer, and commentator. Beginning in the late 1980s, she performed a series of one-hour HBO comedy specials. She provided backstage commentary during the 1992 presidential election on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.&quot; She is the host of the podcast &quot;Nobody Listens to Paula Poundstone&quot;, which is the successor to the National Public Radio program &quot;Live from the Poundstone Institute.&quot; She is a frequent panelist on NPR&#x27;s weekly news quiz show &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot;, and was a recurring guest on the network&#x27;s &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; variety program during Garrison Keillor&#x27;s years as host.

== Early life ==
Poundstone was born in Huntsville, Alabama, the daughter of Vera, a housewife, and Jack Poundstone, an engineer. Her family moved to Sudbury, Massachusetts, about a month after her birth.

== Career ==

Poundstone started doing stand-up comedy at open-mic nights in Boston in 1979. In the early 1980s, she traveled across the United States by Greyhound bus, stopping in at open-mic nights at comedy clubs en route. She stayed in San Francisco, where she became known for improvisational sets at Holy City Zoo on Clement Street and The Other Café comedy club in Cole Valley.

In 1984, Robin Williams saw her act and encouraged her to move to Los Angeles. She performed her act when Williams hosted an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. That year, Poundstone was cast in the movie &quot;Gremloids&quot;. She continued as a comedian and began appearing on several talk shows. In 1989, she won the American Comedy Award for &quot;Best Female Stand-Up Comic&quot;.

In 1990, she wrote and starred in an HBO special called &quot;Cats, Cops and Stuff,&quot; for which she won a CableACE Award, making her the first woman to win the ACE for best Standup Comedy Special. In March 2019, comedian Tig Notaro named &quot;Cats, Cops and Stuff&quot; one of The 5 Funniest Stand-Up Specials Ever for TIME Magazine. Poundstone went on to another first with her second HBO stand-up special, &quot;Paula Poundstone Goes to Harvard,&quot; taped on campus in Sanders Theatre. Poundstone had her own Bravo special in 2006 as part of their three-part &quot;Funny Girls&quot; series, along with Caroline Rhea and Joan Rivers, titled &quot;Paula Poundstone: Look What the Cat Dragged In.&quot;

Poundstone worked as a political correspondent for &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; during the 1992 US presidential campaign and did field pieces for &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot; in 1996. In 1993, Poundstone won a second CableACE Award for &quot;Best Program Interviewer&quot; for her HBO series &quot;The Paula Poundstone Show.&quot; She was then featured in her own variety show, &quot;The Paula Poundstone Show,&quot; on ABC (which lasted two episodes). She also appeared on &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; and was a regular panelist for the remake of &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. Poundstone had a recurring role in Cybill Shepherd&#x27;s TV series &quot;Cybill&quot; (1997).

In the mid-1990s, she was featured in a series of instructional, hybrid animation shorts that were called &quot;Another Pointer from Paula Poundstone.&quot; These were used as bumpers for PTV Park, a PBS children&#x27;s programming block that was the precursor to PBS Kids. These were directed by Francesca Rizzo and animated by Gene Mackles.

Poundstone has also worked as a voice actress. She voiced Judge Stone on &quot;Science Court&quot; (also known as &quot;Squigglevision&quot;), an edutainment cartoon series done in the Squigglevision style that aired on Saturday mornings, on ABC Kids in 1997.

Staying with the makers of &quot;Science Court&quot;, Tom Snyder Productions, she was the voice of the mom, Paula Small, in the cartoon series &quot;Home Movies&quot; for the show&#x27;s first five episodes, which aired on UPN. Between the show&#x27;s 1999 UPN cancellation and 2000 revival on Cartoon Network, Poundstone chose to leave the show and was replaced by Janine Ditullio. The show&#x27;s character, Paula Small, was named after and loosely modeled on Poundstone.

Poundstone is a frequent panelist on National Public Radio (NPR)&#x27;s weekly news quiz show, &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot;. In 2017, she launched a new science-comedy-interview program on NPR called &quot;Live from the Poundstone Institute&quot; that released episodes weekly, then stopped suddenly, saying “the semester is over”. In July 2018, Poundstone began hosting the information-based, comedy podcast &quot;Nobody Listens to Paula Poundstone&quot; with Adam Felber, who appears on every show.

Poundstone tours the country extensively, performing stand-up comedy in theaters and performing arts centers. She is known for never doing the same act twice and spontaneously interacting with the crowd. Writes Nick Zaino III of the &quot;Boston Globe,&quot; &quot;Her crowd work has always been unusual—her natural disposition, curious and ever-perplexed, allows Poundstone to aggressively question audience members without ever seeming threatening. And no one does the callback better.&quot; She has released three comedy CDs: &quot;I Heart Jokes: Paula Tells Them in Boston&quot; on April Fools&#x27; Day 2013; &quot;North by Northwest: Paula Poundstone Live!&quot; (her first double album) in June 2016; and &quot;I Heart Jokes: Paula Tells Them in Maine&quot; in January 2009.
Poundstone&#x27;s first book, &quot;There Is Nothing in This Book That I Meant to Say&quot;, was published by Crown in 2006. Her second book, published by Algonquin in May 2017, is titled &quot;The Totally Unscientific Study of the Search for Human Happiness.&quot; She also wrote the column &quot;Hey, Paula!&quot; for &quot;Mother Jones&quot; (1993–1998) and articles for &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Glamour&quot;, and &quot;Entertainment Weekly,&quot; among others.

An avid reader, Poundstone has been the National Spokesperson for the American Library Association&#x27;s &quot;United for Libraries&quot; since 2007. It is a citizens&#x27; support group that works to raise funds and awareness for their local libraries.

Poundstone is No. 88 on Comedy Central&#x27;s 2004 list of the 100 greatest stand-ups of all time.

In 2023, she performed at Comedy Day in San Francisco alongside Marga Gomez.

== Personal life ==
Poundstone began serving as a foster parent in the 1990s. She has fostered eight children, and eventually adopted two daughters and a son.

Poundstone identifies as asexual and an atheist.

In October 2001, Poundstone was charged with felony child endangerment in connection with driving while intoxicated with her children in the car. She was also charged with three counts of lewd acts upon a girl younger than 14. The charge involved inappropriate touching of a 12-year-old girl. In a plea bargain, she changed her earlier plea of not guilty, and in exchange prosecutors asked for the court records to be sealed, dropped three counts of committing lewd acts against a child, and added a misdemeanor count of inflicting injury upon a child. Poundstone also pleaded no contest to one count of felony child endangerment. She was barred from taking in foster children again, sentenced to five years of probation and six months in rehabilitation, and ordered to perform 200 hours of community service, attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and a child-abuse program, and receive random drug and alcohol tests. In 2002, Poundstone talked about the events that led to her arrest and the steps she has taken, including a six-month treatment program for alcoholism, but she said that she did not commit any lewd acts or child abuse.

<text>The William Crooks is a 4-4-0 steam locomotive that was the first locomotive to operate in the State of Minnesota, beginning in 1861. It was named after William Crooks, the Chief Mechanical Engineer for the St. Paul and Pacific Railroad. He served as a colonel and commander of the 6th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War. Crooks laid the initial track between Minneapolis and St. Paul, and the &quot;William Crooks&quot; was the first locomotive to run on the line.

== History ==
=== 1861–1900 ===
Constructed in 1861 for the Minnesota and Pacific Railroad as their number 1, The &quot;William Crooks&quot; first provided service a year later, in 1862, for the St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (into which the M&amp;P had been reorganized). After completion, the locomotive traveled by rail to La Crosse, Wisconsin, then the nearest rail point to St. Paul. From there, it was loaded onto a Mississippi River barge bound for St. Paul. Though it arrived in St. Paul on September 9, 1861, it was not until June 28, 1862, that the passenger equipment arrived and of track could be laid. The &quot;William Crooks&quot; carried its first train load of passengers on the same day. The trip began at 2:30 PM from St. Paul with the train and its passengers returning from their trip to St. Anthony (now Minneapolis) at 6 PM. Though the governor of Minnesota, the founder of the railroad, and other dignitaries were the train&#x27;s first passengers, the train moved into regular service four days later.

The locomotive was originally a wood-burner with a tender that held just two cords of wood. Often the tender&#x27;s wood was used before the train could reach a wood pile, forcing the crew to make use of the wooden right-of-way fences to keep the train moving. Later the locomotive was converted into a coal-burner. As built, the engine had a straight boiler (not tapered from a larger diameter at the firebox end to a smaller diameter at the smokebox end), had the balloon stack typical of wood burning engines, and three domes—the center of which was for sanding the rails to improve traction when needed. As the engine aged and parts replaced, the engine&#x27;s appearance changed. The engine received a diamond stack for burning coal, its boiler replaced with a tapered design, and was reduced to a two dome configuration.

In 1868, a fire partially destroyed the &quot;William Crooks&quot;. Albion B. Smith was tasked with restoring the locomotive and became the locomotive&#x27;s engineer once it returned to service. He became a personal friend to James J. Hill through his works and service with the &quot;William Crooks&quot;. The old locomotive had served almost 50 years and had eventually been assigned to runs in Montana and Washington. The &quot;William Crooks&quot; was in passenger service until September 30, 1897, after which it was retired, and by the turn of the century was sitting decommissioned in a corner of the Great Northern yard in St. Paul. The locomotive was restored to operation for Hill&#x27;s 70th birthday in 1908, as he had insisted when informed of its condition. Smith, who worked a regular schedule for the Great Northern Railway, would be reassigned to duty with the &quot;William Crooks&quot; for special events such as this and, later, the Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition. After he received word that the &quot;William Crooks&quot; was to be scrapped, it was Smith who spoke to Hill about it, with Hill declaring, &quot;Not as long as I live&quot;. After Hill&#x27;s death in 1916, the Great Northern continued to exhibit the train at special events. The railroad gave the engine a balloon stack similar in appearance to its original, but internally designed to be suitable for coal as well as wood.

=== 1900–present ===
In 1924, the locomotive went on an exhibition tour from Chicago to Seattle. For this event, the railroad rebuilt the engine to further resemble its original form, restoring it to the original three-dome configuration, though it retained the tapered boiler. The &quot;William Crooks&quot; was displayed at the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Fair of the Iron Horse&quot; in 1927, then at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair, and finally at the Chicago Railroad Fair in 1948 as part of the &quot;Wheels A-Rolling&quot; pageant, traveling to and from all three events under its own power. Though the locomotive had been converted from burning wood to burning coal as fuel, its headlight remained lit by kerosene; this restricted the &quot;William Crooks&quot;&#x27; travel to daylight hours only.

On the way to the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair, the locomotive made a stop in Paterson, New Jersey, where it had been built 78 years before. The old locomotive made many stops en route to New York City, drawing crowds everywhere it went. At that time it was the oldest locomotive operating under its own power. Accompanying the &quot;William Crooks&quot; was John J. Maher, a retired Great Northern engineer. Maher began his career with the railroad in 1881 as a fireman for the &quot;William Crooks&quot;; he became the locomotive&#x27;s engineer in 1888. He indicated that there had been no breakdowns during the trip from St. Paul and speculated that the locomotive could probably travel at up to without difficulty.

Maher, whose work as a fireman took place before the &quot;William Crooks&quot; was converted to burning coal, recalled that in the early days, part of a fireman&#x27;s equipment was an axe, so wood could be chopped if the wood in the locomotive&#x27;s tender ran out. He said he often needed to go out and look for wood to keep the &quot;William Crooks&quot; moving. The locomotive was accompanied to the World&#x27;s Fair by two 1880s vintage coaches which still had their original candle holders from the days when they were lit by candle light, and their original wood stoves for warmth.

Its cylinders, rods and bearings were all rebuilt at the Great Northern&#x27;s Dale Street Shops in St. Paul in 1947-48 by machinist George A. Halvorsen as his last job before retirement.

The &quot;William Crooks&quot; was placed on display at the St. Paul Union Depot in June 1954. In June 1962 the Great Northern transferred ownership of the engine to the Minnesota Historical Society, though the engine remained displayed in the depot. The St. Paul Union Depot closed to passenger traffic in 1971; however, the engine was not removed until 1975, when it was moved to the newly established Lake Superior Railroad Museum in Duluth, Minnesota, where it remains.

== Legacy ==
The &quot;William Crooks&quot; is one of only a few locomotives from the time of the Civil War that survive today. For the celebration of the 150th anniversary of rail service in Minnesota, the locomotive&#x27;s whistle was blown for the first time since 1948, when it appeared at the Chicago Railroad Fair.

In 1959-1960 Marx Toy Company retailed, through Montgomery Ward, an electric toy train using the William Crooks locomotive design and freight express cars for their Tales of Wells Fargo play-set. In 1973 the train was reissued, as a Heritage play-set, The Pioneer Express, retailed through Sears &amp; Roebuck, with the locomotive pulling the tender, an open lumber car and caboose.

<text>Jeremy Allen Bonderman (born October 28, 1982) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. Bonderman played in Major League Baseball for the Detroit Tigers and Seattle Mariners from 2003 to 2010 and in 2013.

==High school==
Bonderman attended Pasco High School in Pasco, Washington. In his last year of high school baseball, he went 5–2 and recorded a 3.60 earned run average (ERA). He is the only high school junior ever to be drafted with a first round pick in baseball history. He had passed his GED tests and successfully petitioned Major League Baseball (MLB) to become draft-eligible.

==Professional career==

===Draft and minor leagues===
The Oakland Athletics selected Bonderman out of high school with the 26th pick in the 2001 Major League Baseball draft, a selection that, according to Michael Lewis&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, caused Athletics general manager Billy Beane to throw a chair through a wall in fury.

On July 6, 2002, Bonderman was involved in a three-team deal. The Athletics had sent Carlos Peña, a player to be named later (who later became Bonderman), and Franklyn Germán to the Detroit Tigers. The New York Yankees sent Ted Lilly, John-Ford Griffin, and Jason Arnold to the Athletics. The Tigers sent Jeff Weaver to the Yankees and cash to the Athletics.

===Detroit Tigers===
Bonderman debuted in the major leagues when he was 20 years old. His major league debut came against the Minnesota Twins, who scored six runs in four innings. In his rookie campaign of 2003, the Tigers finished with the second-worst record in MLB history at 43–119 and came close to being the first team with two pitchers who each lost 20 games in a season since Wilbur Wood and Stan Bahnsen with the 1973 Chicago White Sox. With a 6–18 record, he was removed from the starting rotation by manager Alan Trammell on September 3. One night after Mike Maroth lost his 21st of the year, Bonderman was reinstated into the rotation but cemented a 6–19 record as the losing pitcher in his last decision of the season in a 6–2 defeat to the Twins at the Metrodome on September 19. The next season, Bonderman went 11–13 with a 4.89 ERA. In 2005, he had a 14–13 record and a 4.57 ERA. Bonderman was the Tigers Opening Day starter for the 2005 season.

In 2006 Bonderman finished with a 14–8 record, his career best and posted a 4.08 ERA. He started game four of the 2006 American League Division Series against the Yankees. He pitched five perfect innings before giving up a hit. He then pitched 3 more innings, surrendering only one run. Bonderman was the winning pitcher in the game that gave the Tigers the series. He pitched again in game four of the 2006 American League Championship Series, pitching six innings and giving up three runs. The Tigers would go on to win the game and series for the American League Pennant. In the World Series, he pitched six innings giving up two runs. He left the game with the Tigers in the lead. However, the Tigers would ultimately lose the game, as well as the series the following day.

In 2007, Bonderman had the best start of his career, but after the all-star break he struggled only winning four games, finishing 11–9 with a 5.01 ERA. He finished second in the 2007 All-Star Game Final vote.

Bonderman missed most of the 2008 season because he had procedures done to remove a blood clot in his axillary vein.

On June 13, 2009, five days after his only start of the season, Bonderman was placed on the disabled list indefinitely because of recurring pain in his pitching shoulder.

Bonderman started 29 games for the Tigers in 2010, going 8–10 with a league-worst 5.53 ERA. Following the season, he was granted free agency. &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; reported that the Indians had interest in Bonderman, but for only a minor league contract. Bonderman remained unsigned through the 2011 season.

===Seattle Mariners===
On December 21, 2012, Bonderman signed a minor league contract with the Seattle Mariners. The deal included an invitation to spring training. He made his first start for the major league club on June 2, and took the loss in a 10–0 win by the Minnesota Twins. On June 7, in his second start, he pitched three-hit ball for six innings to beat the New York Yankees and earn his first win since 2010. He was designated for assignment on July 8, 2013, following consecutive poor starts. He elected free agency on July 11.

===Detroit Tigers (second stint)===
On July 14, 2013, Bonderman was signed to a minor league deal bringing him back to Detroit, playing for the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens. On August 5, 2013, Bonderman was recalled from the Mud Hens, to join the Tigers bullpen. In his first appearance back with Detroit, Bonderman pitched three innings of scoreless relief in the Tigers 6–5 victory over the Cleveland Indians, to earn his first career victory in relief. He became a free agent following the season.

==Pitching style==
Bonderman threw four pitches, relying primarily on a two-seam fastball at 89–93 mph. His other pitches included a slider at 80–82 mph, a four-seam fastball at 89–92 mph, a changeup at 85–88 mph, and rarely a cutter at 86 mph.

==Personal life==
Bonderman resides in Pasco, Washington with his wife Amber and their two children.

<doc id="924767" wikidata="Q1193347" url="?curid=924767" title="Sleeping with the Enemy">
<text>Sleeping with the Enemy is a 1991 American psychological thriller film directed by Joseph Ruben and starring Julia Roberts, Patrick Bergin, and Kevin Anderson. The film is based on Nancy Price&#x27;s 1987 novel of the same name. Roberts plays a woman who fakes her own death and moves from Cape Cod to Cedar Falls, Iowa to escape from her controlling, obsessive, and abusive husband, but finds her peaceful new life interrupted when he discovers her actions and tracks her down.

&quot;Sleeping with the Enemy&quot; was released theatrically on February 8, 1991. It received generally negative reviews from the critics, but it was a box-office success, grossing $175 million on a production budget of $19 million. The film also broke the record at the time for the highest domestic opening for a film with a female lead, grossing $13 million on its opening weekend and surpassing the previous record held by &quot;Aliens&quot;, which grossed $10 million in its first weekend.

==Plot==
Laura Burney has a seemingly idyllic life and a happy marriage to Martin, a successful Boston investment counselor, and they live in a luxurious home overlooking the sea of Cape Cod. Beneath Martin&#x27;s charming, handsome exterior, however, is an obsessive and controlling person who has physically, emotionally, and sexually abused Laura throughout their nearly four-year marriage. Then, in a recurring pattern, he apologetically showers her with flowers and gifts.

Martin accepts the invitation of their neighbor, a doctor, for an evening sail, despite knowing that Laura fears water and cannot swim. As a severe storm unexpectedly rolls in, Martin and the doctor struggle to control the vessel. Laura is swept overboard. After an extensive Coast Guard search, Laura’s body is never recovered, and she is presumed dead from drowning, and Martin is inconsolable.

Laura is revealed to actually be alive. After secretly learning to swim, she planned to fake her own death to escape Martin&#x27;s abuse. During the storm, she jumped overboard, swam ashore, and returned home. She cut her hair, donned a wig, flushed her wedding ring down the toilet, and took her stashed belongings and money and headed to a nearby bus station.

Laura moves to Cedar Falls, Iowa. Previously, she had told Martin that her blind, stroke-impaired mother, Chloe, had died, but Laura had secretly moved Chloe to an Iowa nursing home. Laura rents a house, finds a job, and settles into a new life as &quot;Sara Waters&quot;. Her neighbor, Ben Woodward, a young drama teacher at a local college, is attracted to Laura, though he suspects she has a checkered past. They have an agreeable date, but when a kiss turns more physical, Laura resists and demands that Ben leave. She later admits to him that she escaped an abusive marriage.

Martin learns that Laura had taken swim lessons, leading him to believe she did not drown and is alive. This is confirmed when he finds Laura&#x27;s wedding ring in the toilet, which hadn&#x27;t properly flushed as she had believed. Martin travels to Chloe&#x27;s nursing home, masquerading as a detective, and learns that Chloe&#x27;s &quot;nephew&quot; has just visited. Laura, disguised as a man, is also at the nursing home and barely misses encountering Martin. Martin discovers Laura&#x27;s whereabouts and learns about Ben. He trails the couple to Laura&#x27;s new house and breaks in while she and Ben are outside. He also stalks them during their date at a local carnival. When Laura returns home, she notices the small clues Martin deliberately left inside the house: the hand towels perfectly aligned and the contents of the kitchen cabinets lined up to Martin&#x27;s exacting standards.

Martin then confronts Laura as Ben smashes the door down and attempts to subdue Martin, who knocks him unconscious. As Martin aims his gun at Ben, Laura distracts him by slamming her knee into his groin. She grabs Martin&#x27;s gun and holds him at gunpoint. As Laura calls the police, Martin expects her to tell the police to protect her from him, as she had done in the past, but Laura shocks Martin by informing the police she has killed an intruder and then shoots Martin three times in the chest. A wounded Martin seizes Laura by the hair and grabs the gun, aiming it at her in a desperate attempt to kill her, but the gun clicks empty. Martin then dies from his wounds, while Laura and Ben embrace and wait for the police.

==Filming==

==Release==
===Critical reception===
, the film held a 24% &quot;Rotten&quot; rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 38 reviews with an average rating of 4.6/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;A game Julia Roberts gives it her all, but &quot;Sleeping with the Enemy&quot; is one stalker thriller that&#x27;s unlikely to inspire many obsessions of its own.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 48 out of 100, based on 22 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A-&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film 1.5 stars out of a possible 4 upon its release, saying while the film had good performances and the opening scenes &quot;briefly seemed to have greatness in its grasp&quot;, &quot;Sleeping with the Enemy&quot; quickly fell into cliches and plot holes and became &quot;a slasher movie in disguise, an up-market version of the old exploitation formula where the victim can run, but she can&#x27;t hide.&quot; Another mostly negative review came from Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, who wrote that the film &quot;has the bare bones of a tantalizing thriller&quot; and praised Robert&#x27;s performance (&quot;you can practically feel her pulse&quot;), but also felt Bergin&#x27;s role was too &quot;mechanical&quot; to be believed, and placing blame on the &quot;deadwood&quot; script.

===Box office===
The film&#x27;s opening ended &quot;Home Alone&quot;″s twelve week run atop the box office. By the end of its run, the film had grossed $101,599,005 in the domestic box office; with an international total of $73,400,000, the film&#x27;s worldwide gross was $174,999,005; based on a $19 million budget, the film was a box office success. The film was released in the United Kingdom on April 12, 1991, and opened on #2, behind &quot;Highlander II: The Quickening&quot;. The next week, the film remained in the same position.

==Soundtrack==
The original music for the film was composed and conducted by Jerry Goldsmith. Columbia Records released an album concurrently with the film containing just over 38 minutes of score plus the Van Morrison song &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot;. In 2011, La-La Land Records issued a limited edition album of 3500 copies expanding Goldsmith&#x27;s score (but omitting the song).

==Home media==
The film reached #1 in the rental charts in September 1991, and ended up as the ninth most rented movie that year in the United States. It was released on LaserDisc in Australia, the United States, United Kingdom and Japan by Fox Video in 1991. It also received various releases on VHS, was released on DVD on 2 September 2003, and subsequently entered the market of Blu-ray in June 2011. As of August 2023, it still hasn&#x27;t been released on 4K.

===Awards===
The score by Jerry Goldsmith won the BMI Film Music Award, 1992, and the film was nominated for the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films Saturn Award for 1992 in four categories: Best Actress (Roberts), Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor (Bergin), Best Horror Film and Best Music (Goldsmith).

==Remakes==
In February 2019, it was reported that a remake of &quot;Sleeping with the Enemy&quot; was in development at Searchlight Pictures, with Nia DaCosta helming the project.

<doc id="924773" wikidata="Q472710" url="?curid=924773" title="Kaftanzoglio Stadium">
<text>Kaftanzoglio National Stadium () is a sports stadium in Thessaloniki, Greece. It currently has 27,560 seats, owing to conversion of terraces to seats in 2000 and a comprehensive renovation before reopening to host football matches for the 2004 Summer Olympics, which was centered in Athens. It has been the home stadium of Iraklis Thessaloniki F.C. since 1960.

==History==
The stadium was built with money donated by the Kaftanzoglou Foundation, in honour of Lysandros Kaftanzoglou, hence its name. At the time of its opening on 27 October 1960, the stadium was one of the highest quality stadiums in the Balkans. It was the largest stadium in Greece until 1982, but has since been surpassed in capacity by the Olympic Stadium in Athens.

On 15 October 1969, the attendance record was set with 47,458 fans present for a FIFA World Cup qualifying match, witnessing Greece defeat Switzerland by a 4–1 score. In 1973 it hosted the European Cup Winners Cup Final, which resulted in a 1–0 victory for AC Milan over Leeds United.

The complex has become increasingly dilapidated and derelict following the 2002–2004 renovations, with the stadium being temporarily closed after failed safety inspections concurrently with the Athens Olympic Sports Complex, which includes the Olympic Stadium. Iraklis temporarily relocated football activities to Chalastra Stadium for the remainder of the 2023–24 season.

==Athletics events==
The stadium regularly hosts athletics events. It hosted the Greek national championships in 2009 and it has been used for both athletics at the Mediterranean Games and the European Cup in athletics. It was the host stadium for the 2009 IAAF World Athletics Final.

<text>Aker Solutions ASA is a Norwegian engineering firm headquartered in Oslo. The firm&#x27;s production is focused on energy infrastructure, including systems and services required to de-carbonize oil and gas production, build wind-to-grid infrastructure and engineer capture and sequestration.

Founded in 1841 as Akers Mekaniske Verksted, the company has been known as Aker, Aker Kvaerner and Aker Solutions (2008). Aker Kværner was founded in 2004 from the major restructuring of a complex &quot;Aker Kværner&quot; business unit formed in 2002 by the merger of Aker Maritime and Kværner Oil &amp; Gas. The company was majority controlled by Aker ASA until 2007. Then, via major ownership restructuring on 22 June 2007, Aker ASA gave up its holding in Aker Solutions and transferred a 40% stake to Aker Holding, which in turn was owned by Aker ASA (60%), the Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry (30%), SAAB (7.5%) and Investor AB (2.5%). On 3 April 2008, Aker Kværner was renamed Aker Solutions. 

In 2020, the company merged with Kværner ASA. As of 2023, the company trades on the Oslo stock exchange under the symbol &#x27;AKSO&#x27;.

==History==
===1841 to 2002: Evolution of Aker Kvaerner ===
Aker Solutions derives from a series of start-ups and mergers of Norwegian companies across the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries.

In 1841, Aker established its first workshop along the Aker river in Oslo, called Aker Mechanical Workshop (Aker Mekaniske Verksted). 

Kværner Brug was founded in Oslo in 1853. In 1943, Kværner Brug and partner Myrens Verksted jointly acquired a majority shareholding in Thunes Mekaniske Verksted.

Joint holding company Kværner Industries AS was established in December 1967, listing on the Oslo Stock Exchange. The Kværner Group entered the offshore oil and gas market from its base in Oslo, and Kværner Engineering, an engineering and contracting company, was set-up in the late 1960s.

In 1993, construction work began at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp through jointly owned subsidiary, Kværner Process Services Inc. (KPSI), initiating a business partnership with the US Department of Defense that lasted until 2006.

In 1996, Kværner acquired UK-based conglomerate Trafalgar House, increasing its interests in shipbuilding, oil and gas, pulp and paper, engineering and construction. The company&#x27;s international headquarters was moved to London.

In 1999, the company initiated a major sell-off to raise money via divestment, but financial and operational problems persisted, and the company entered an acute liquidity crisis in August 2001. In July 2000, Aker Maritime ASA, a Norway-based offshore products, technology and services provider, bought 26% of the shares in Kværner ASA. In November 2001, Aker Maritime ASA and Kværner ASA reached an agreement, whereby Aker Maritime injected NOK 2.8 bn in net assets, raised another NOK 3.5 bn through two direct issues, and renegotiated NOK 8.6 bn of Kværner&#x27;s debt. The following year the group adopt the Aker Kvaerner brand for the entire group.

===2002 to 2008: Aker Kværner and Aker Solutions===

Having resulted from a merger of Aker Maritime and Kværner Oil &amp; Gas in 2002, a major business restructuring of Aker Kværner was launched in 2004. This led to the formation of two industrial groups: Aker Kværner, working with oil, gas, energy and process engineering, and shipbuilding Aker Yards. Aker Kværner also became a minor shareholder in the Finnish engineering company Aker Arctic in 2004. Aker Kvaerner started trading on the Oslo Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol &#x27;AKVER&#x27; on 2 April 2004.

In 2006, the company&#x27;s pulp-and-paper and power businesses were sold to Finnish-based Metso for €335 million. On 7 June 2007, a deal was announced to sell a 40.1 percent stake of the company from Aker ASA to Aker Holding. The new company was owned by Aker ASA (60%), the Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry (30%), SAAB (7.5%) and Investor (2.5%).

In 2007, the company was identified by Amnesty International as an accessory to torture and other human rights abuses for its collaboration in constructing and maintaining the US detention camp at Guantanamo Bay.

===2008 to 2020: Aker Solutions===
During the AGM held on 3 April 2008, Aker Kværner announced that it would rebrand as Aker Solutions.

Between April 2010 and June 2010, the company won three contracts from Noble Energy to supply steel tube umbilicals, a complete mono-ethylene glycol (MEG) reclamation unit, and subsea control equipment for the construction of offshore oil platforms in the Tamar gas field in Israel. Together, the contracts were worth NOK 1.1 billion.

On 6 May 2011, Aker Solutions&#x27; EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) division was re-branded and spun off as a new company, Kværner ASA, listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange in the third-quarter of 2011. Aker Solutions&#x27; holding company — Aker Holdings AS — was renamed Aker Kværner Holding AS, and held around 40% of Kværner ASA. Aker ASA took over the 10% stake owned by Saab and Investor AB, raising its stake in Aker Kværner Holdings AS to 70%.

In 2014, Aker Solutions was further divided into two companies, Aker Solutions and Akastor, and in August Aker Solutions leased the entire first phase of the new Aberdeen International Business Park.

On 18 February 2015, the company announced the loss of around 300 jobs in Norway as a response to falling oil prices and the decline in demand for drilling services.

In November 2020, Aker Solutions merged with Kværner ASA.

<doc id="924793" wikidata="Q7097681" url="?curid=924793" title="Operation Urban Warrior">
<text>Operation Urban Warrior was a United States Marine Corps program created as an exercise meant to plan and test Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain (MOUT) and urban warfare in general. It was developed in the mid-1990s by the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory partly in response to growing problem on inner-city fighting, and especially made urgent following the Battle of Mogadishu in 1993.

Press materials from the Warfighting Lab in 1997 stated, &quot;..the world is becoming increasingly urbanized and increasingly dangerous&quot; and described a new fight zone called the &quot;urban littoral,&quot; or coastal zone where most of the world&#x27;s population will reside. &quot;Parts of the urban littoral will contain all the classic ingredients for conflict. There will be social, cultural, religious and tribal strife between different groups. Many areas will have scarce resources, including the most basic ones like food and shelter as populations grow and resources shrink even further. The chances for conflict will naturally grow with it&quot;.

Some preferred to call it the &quot;Three Block War&quot;. The concern that Marines would be made responsible for humanitarian assistance, as evidenced by the Bosnian War, was part of the original planning of the program. According to a 1997 &quot;Defense Monitor&quot; brief, the Marines were facing the burden of excessive operational tempo related to humanitarian concerns. The importance of getting the military out of humanitarian relief was expressed in the 1997 Center for Defense Information brief.

==Background==

The program has been called one of the most important in the United States Armed Forces. This is because, even though the U.S. is believed to have one of the most powerful conventional military forces in the world, many of the more powerful weapons systems intended for use fighting in open places are useless in urban settings. This was the case in some forested regions of Europe, and in open deserts encountered during the Gulf War and Iraq War. Lines of approach through cities tend to be long and narrow, with sharp turns, civilians, street traffic and local commerce. This environment is one where heavy fighting vehicles like the M1 Abrams can not maneuver well, avoid being seen from a long distance by potential hostiles, nor be certain that all ground surfaces will support vehicle weight.

Inhabitants may have any of a huge number of possible reactions, including anger, resentment, disrespect, and a strong potential for spontaneous protest, disorder, and uninitiated response. Those who are friendly may be desperate for assistance but afraid, increasing the risk of stampedes and other problems. Those who are hostile will be on their home ground, have familiarity with the terrain, and decide to defend their home turf. Furthermore, those who use unconventional warfare will have found protection among inhabitants. To use options like airstrikes, artillery, and mortars against cities will have a high cost in missed targets and civilian casualties. History records many military operations involving cities, of which a large number degenerated into torturous situations with massive casualties. Stalingrad and Saigon are two modern examples.

As the world&#x27;s population becomes concentrated in cities, current and future fighting will likely to take place within them. This means that there will be an increase in the demand for infantrymen, because infantrymen are uniquely able to enter built-up areas, uproot and clear them, defend them, and even search the local residence. This is one reason why United States military leaders plans include the reasonable assumption that the infantryman&#x27;s role in combat operations will increase rather than decrease in the coming years, such as the Land Warrior system.

Urban Warrior is seen as having one primary purpose: to fight enemies in urban environments; with a secondary purpose is to conduct and refine disaster relief and humanitarian assistance for use in the United States and abroad. Doing so supposedly involves gaining the support and trust of the local population by engaging in humanitarian efforts, a project the Marine Corps has more recently sought to distance itself from.

Some lessons learned from Urban Warrior were applied in the 2003 invasion of Iraq and subsequent occupation. Fighting in Najaf and Fallujah has once again made it clear that local irregular forces tend to have the advantage of home territory and plentiful local support. Religion, ideology, and culture may also play in the local insurgent&#x27;s favor. Non-combatants often side with them because of nationalism, ethnic connections, general dislike or even hatred, of a foreign invading force. For example, this tendency became clear in Mogadishu, Somalia, when civilians chose to support the Habar Gidir (as opposed to United Nations and U.S. forces), and in Fallujah, where most of the remaining civilians decided the invasion forces were less favorable than the insurgent defenders.


An experimental urban camouflage Battle Dress Uniform was developed and used during the Urban Warrior exercises of 1999. The pattern, sometimes called T-pattern or T-block, consists of three gray tones arranged in a geometric pattern, intended as a &#x27;pattern breaker&#x27; to make Marine troops harder to locate when in such environments. Like all modern BDUs, it is made of a lightweight rip-stop material. The pattern was never officially adopted, and it has since been superseded by MARPAT.

==History==

===Exercises in Chicago, May 1998===
Eighty Marines from 1st Battalion, 8th Marines, stationed in Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, toured Chicago to enhance knowledge of urban infrastructure, such as a gas plant, water facility, tunnels, bridges, and police and Fire stations.

===Exercises in the San Francisco East Bay, March 1999===
A four-day military exercise was planned and executed in Oakland, California in March 1999. A combined force of 6,000 Marines and 700 sailors took control of the grounds and buildings of the defunct Oak Knoll Naval Hospital invaded the defunct Naval Air Station Alameda on the second day as part of a national effort called Operation Sea Dragon.

After original plans to use the San Francisco Presidio were rejected by the National Park Service based on the size of the spectacle and its inherent environmental damage, and a trial run at the Naval Postgraduate School beach in Monterey, California, Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown and Alameda Mayor Ralph Appezzato welcomed the Marines to use their cities as a proving ground. The operations included numerous aviation assets, such as AV-8B Harrier IIs, CH-46 Sea Knights, CH-53 Sea Stallions, AH-1 SuperCobras, and UH-1N Twin Hueys, as well as several Landing Craft Air Cushion. Five Navy ships, including and , were brought in and opened for public view during the operations.

<text>The Pankritio Stadium (, &quot;Pagkritio Stadio&quot;, literally: &quot;Pancretan Stadium&quot;) is a multi-purpose sports stadium located in Heraklion on the island of Crete. It was completed on 31 December 2003, and officially opened on 11 August 2004. As one of the most modern sports venues in Greece at the time, it was used as one of the football venues to host matches of the 2004 Summer Olympic football tournament. It has a capacity of 26,240 seats, and is currently the home ground of local association football club Ergotelis, and on occasion, of Greece.

==Location==
The Pankritio Stadium is located in Heraklion, at the Lido district to the west of the city center. It has been built about 50 meters from the island coast, and is neighbored by the Lido Indoor Hall and the city&#x27;s outdoor pool venue, of which the whole district is named after (Lido).

==History==
The stadium broke ground sometime during the late 80s, however construction work was not completed on time, and was eventually indefinitely postponed. Once Greece won the bid to host the 2004 Summer Olympics, construction of the stadium was finally picked up once again in 2001. It was eventually completed on 31 December 2003. The total construction cost was estimated at €50,000,000. The new stadium was officially opened on 11 August 2004, to host an international friendly game between Greece and Switzerland.

Due to its size, age and ranking, the Pankritio was selected as one of the football venues of the 2004 Summer Olympics Football Tournament, hosting in total 10 matches (5 men&#x27;s Group Stage matches, 2 women&#x27;s Group Stage matches, one men&#x27;s Quarterfinals match, one women&#x27;s Quarterfinals match and one women&#x27;s Semi-Final match). After the tournament, the stadium was rented out, and has since been used as a training and home ground of the city&#x27;s football club Ergotelis, and occasionally also by Greece. In 2006, the Pankritio hosted the 2005–06 Greek Cup Final, the first to be played in Heraklion since 1931.

Although primarily considered a football stadium, the Pankritio, has also been used to host major athletics events, such as the 2004 Tsiklitiria annual IAAF World Challenge meeting and the 2015 European Team Championships First League. The stadium has also been used for a number of music concerts, most notably hosting Deep Purple and Vasilis Papakonstantinou on May 6, 2011.

==Facilities==
The Pankritio Stadium sports complex features in total two football grounds built to international standards (main stadium and training ground), an 8-lane track, an auxiliary 6-lane track, an indoor gym and swimming pool, multi-purpose halls for boxing, wrestling, fencing, dance, weightlifting, shooting, and tae kwon do, a rowing simulator and a physiotherapy room with sauna and hot tub. Additionally, the stadium features seminar meeting rooms, a dining room, and a showroom featuring exhibits from the 2004 Summer Olympics and 2011 Special Olympics.

The complex is neighbored by the city&#x27;s outdoor swimming pool and the Lido Indoor Hall.

==Tenants==
The stadium has been used as the home ground of Football League football team Ergotelis, since its opening in 2004, as their traditional home turf Nikos Kazantzakis Stadium was declared unfit for use in official matches at any level of the Greek football league system since 2004. Between 2006 and 2009, the stadium was also used by Ergotelis&#x27; rival OFI, until their original home ground, Theodoros Vardinogiannis Stadium, upgrade was done.

On occasion, the Pankritio has also hosted home games of the Greece, notably attracting large numbers of spectators from all over the island.

==Records==
The stadium attendance record and first ever sold-out event was set on 20 February 2005, in a Superleague match between Ergotelis and reigning champions Olympiacos with 27,950 tickets being sold. The result was a 2−1 victory for the home team.

==2004 Summer Olympics==

Pankritio Stadium hosted six games of the men&#x27;s football tournament at the 2004 Summer Olympics, and four games of the women&#x27;s Olympic Football tournament.

<doc id="924799" wikidata="Q1517554" url="?curid=924799" title="Honey, I Blew Up the Kid">
<text>Honey, I Blew Up the Kid is a 1992 American science fiction comedy film directed by Randal Kleiser and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It is the sequel to &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot; (1989) and the second installment of the &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot; film series. Rick Moranis, Marcia Strassman, Amy O&#x27;Neill, and Robert Oliveri return as the Szalinski family, while Keri Russell makes her film debut as Mandy Park. In the film, the family&#x27;s two-year-old son Adam is accidentally exposed to Wayne&#x27;s new industrial-sized growth machine, which causes him to gradually grow to enormous size. Wayne&#x27;s coworker, Dr. Charles Hendrickson, wants the giant Adam stopped at all costs, and wishes to take control of Wayne&#x27;s invention. The franchise continued with a direct-to-home video sequel, a television series, and theme-park attractions.

==Plot==

Three years after the events of the first film, inventor Wayne Szalinski has moved to Nevada with his wife Diane and their children. Their older son Nick is now a teenager, their daughter Amy is preparing to leave for college, and their younger son, Adam, is two years old. When Diane leaves with Amy to help her settle into her college dorm, Wayne and Nick are left in charge of Adam. The three of them go to Sterling Labs, where Wayne has constructed a version of his shrink ray machine which enlarges objects. He tests it on Adam&#x27;s favorite toy, Big Bunny. When Wayne and Nick are distracted, Adam is zapped by the machine, which short-circuits and does not enlarge Big Bunny.

Back home, Adam and Big Bunny are exposed to electrical waves from the microwave oven and grow to a height of seven feet. Wayne and Nick take Adam back to the lab to reverse the growth process, but are kicked out by Wayne&#x27;s colleague, Dr. Charles Hendrickson, who wants control of Wayne&#x27;s invention. Diane returns home and joins Wayne and Nick as they struggle to prevent Adam from demolishing the house. In another attempt to shrink Adam back to normal size, Wayne and Diane retrieve Wayne&#x27;s original shrink ray machine from a warehouse. Meanwhile, a girl named Mandy arrives to babysit Adam, but faints when she sees him. Nick, who has a crush on Mandy, restrains her to prevent her from alerting the neighbors to Adam&#x27;s condition. As Nick explains the situation to Mandy, Adam is exposed to the television&#x27;s electrical waves and grows to fourteen feet before escaping through a wall.

Nick and Mandy search for Adam, but are taken into custody, while Adam is confined in a truck. Wayne and Diane return home to find Hendrickson and a US Marshal waiting for them. Hendrickson has summoned Clifford Sterling, the company chairman, hoping he will fire Wayne, but Sterling fires Hendrickson instead. Meanwhile, the truck carrying Adam passes by high-voltage power lines, causing him to grow to fifty feet. He escapes confinement and puts Nick and Mandy in his overalls pocket, mistaking them for toys. He then heads towards Las Vegas, pursued by his parents and the authorities. As Wayne and Sterling realize that exposure to the neon lights of the city will make him grow even larger, Hendrickson devises a plan to sedate Adam with tranquilizer cartridges.

Now over a hundred feet tall, Adam causes mass panic as he wanders through Las Vegas. Wayne attempts various plans such as attempting to put him to sleep with Big Bunny by helicopter, and the US Marshal attempting to lure him from the city with an Ice Cream Truck, which utterly fail. Hendrickson arrives by helicopter and starts firing tranquilizer darts at Adam, who is carrying the neon guitar sign of a Hard Rock Cafe. The sign is hit and releases an electrical charge which causes him to cry. Hendrickson is stopped by a colossal Diane, who was enlarged with Wayne&#x27;s original machine. She comforts Adam and holds him still while Wayne shrinks them both back to normal size. When Hendrickson arrives to reluctantly congratulate Wayne, Diane knocks him out with a punch. Wayne and Diane then realize that Nick and Mandy are now tiny, since they were in Adam&#x27;s pocket when he was shrunk. Wayne finds them, but gives them a few minutes of privacy since they are having a romantic moment. In the end they are all confused as to what to do with the still enlarged Big Bunny.

==Production==
The original film, &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot; (1989), was co-written by Stuart Gordon. Meanwhile, Garry Goodrow and Peter Elbling had written an unrelated script titled &quot;Big Baby&quot;. It was about a toddler who grew to giant size by a freak accident involving a growth ray and eventually terrorized Las Vegas. The story was inspired by the film &quot;The Amazing Colossal Man&quot; (1957). Gordon optioned &quot;Big Baby&quot; and pitched it to Disney along with the script that would become &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot;; Disney passed on &quot;Big Baby&quot; initially.

&quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot; was a financial success, prompting Disney to register numerous names for a potential sequel. Gordon successfully pitched the &quot;Big Baby&quot; script to Disney as the basis for a sequel. Screenwriter Thom Eberhardt was hired to make revisions to &quot;Big Baby&quot;; a year and a half was spent reworking the script to feature the Szalinskis. A new climax set among Las Vegas&#x27; neon lights was also added, as opposed to a power plant in the original script. The project was retitled &quot;Honey, I Blew Up the Baby&quot;, before taking on the name &quot;Honey, I Blew Up the Kid&quot;.

Gordon turned down the chance to direct the film, believing he would have limited creative control under Disney, although he remained as executive producer and made suggestions on-set. Jeremiah Chechik was hired to direct, as Disney considered him ideal after seeing his previous film, &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation&quot; (1989). Dawn Steel, the former president of Columbia Pictures, was hired as producer, marking her debut in such a position. Disney removed Chechik from the project a few months into pre-production, out of concern that his ideas were too ambitious and costly. The studio was also concerned about Steel&#x27;s lack of experience, hiring Edward Feldman to handle most of her on-set duties.

Randal Kleiser was hired as the new director, due to his prior experience with special effects while directing Disney&#x27;s &quot;Flight of the Navigator&quot; (1986). He had also taken over directing responsibility on Disney&#x27;s &quot;White Fang&quot; (1991), which demonstrated to the studio that he could bring a project in on time and budget.

===Casting===
Rick Moranis, Marcia Strassman, Amy O&#x27;Neill, and Robert Oliveri reprised their respective roles from the original film: Wayne, Diane, Amy, and Nick Szalinski. &quot;Honey, I Blew Up the Kid&quot; marked the feature film debut of Keri Russell, who plays Mandy Park. Kleiser and the main cast would later return for the 3D show &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Audience&quot;, presented at several Disney parks from the 1990s to 2010.

The film&#x27;s casting director, Renée Rousselot, considered more than 1,000 small children for the role of Adam. She searched for three- to four-year-old boys because a younger child was expected to be problematic. When she came across the two-year-old twins Daniel and Joshua Shalikar in December 1990, she immediately cast them. It was rare for actors as young as them to be cast in such a large role.

Feldman said the twins were initially &quot;undirectable&quot;, stating, &quot;We couldn&#x27;t get them to respond or smile or do anything.&quot; However, the film crew retained them, as a recasting would cost $2 million. A variety of methods were used to resolve the acting issue. The twins were allowed to do whatever they wanted on set, and were filmed the entire time in hopes of acquiring usable footage, some of it requiring script alterations to suit the material that was shot. Some scenes between Moranis and the twins were improvised. At the suggestion of the child psychologist Joann Smith, the film crew began staging faux birthday parties on set for various crewmembers. According to Smith, &quot;If the boys think it&#x27;s a party, they&#x27;re more willing to work.&quot; Kleiser recalled, &quot;You can&#x27;t just tell a 2-year-old, &#x27;Go stand on your mark.&#x27; They have to be tricked into doing everything. The amount of film we shot was astronomical. Danny was generally better at improvising and fresh reactions. Josh was better at following directions, so we would alternate.&quot;

Kleiser and a baby consultant would plan the twins&#x27; scenes several days in advance. One twin would act in the morning while the other was eating lunch or taking a nap. They were sometimes better-behaved and worked more efficiently while together on set. Effects producer Tom Smith said, &quot;On his own, Dan was almost too adventuresome to repeat one move, and Josh seemed very cautious. Put them together and they could do anything.&quot; At the time of production, the twins were contracted for potential appearances in two more &quot;Honey&quot; films. However, the role was recast for the 1997 sequel &quot;Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves&quot;.

===Filming and effects===
Filming began on June 17, 1991, and concluded on October 10. The first filming location was in Simi Valley, California, for scenes involving the Szalinskis&#x27; house. Two replicas of the house were also built by production designer Leslie Dilley, one of them scaled down 43 percent for scenes where Adam has been enlarged. A significant filming location was Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. Wayne&#x27;s laboratory was among the sets built at the Burbank facility. On-site filming also took place in Las Vegas, including the climax along Fremont Street, which was closed off for filming. A scene involving a water park – where Nick works and Mandy is introduced – was filmed at Wet &#x27;n Wild, also in Las Vegas. The final shooting location was Orlando, with filming at Disney-MGM Studios. This was followed by a warehouse scene shot at the nearby Disney World merchandise distribution center.

The film was produced on a $32 million budget, with $8 million going toward special and visual effects. Because Kleiser had only minimal experience with special effects, he relied heavily on Smith. The film was originally scheduled to release in March 1992, but this was pushed back several months to avoid rushing the digital compositing work. While post-production special effects were used heavily throughout the film, some effects were practical (shot on-set). When Adam knocks down his bedroom door, Dilley created a set with miniature furniture about four feet away from the camera, while the adult actors would be about fifteen feet away.

Various props, created by Peter Chesney&#x27;s Image Engineering, were used for giant Adam&#x27;s rampage in Las Vegas. Among these was a 28-foot-high replica of Adam&#x27;s chest, used for scenes involving Nick and Mandy in his oversized pocket. Other props included a pair of giant sneakers measuring 17 feet long, and a replica of the Vegas Vickie sign. A portion of this sequence also depicts giant Adam playing a neon guitar sign from a Hard Rock Cafe.

Stunt double Alex Daniels was used for scenes featuring seven-foot Adam, with an oversized puppet head worn to depict the character&#x27;s face. Daniels studied videotapes of the twins to replicate their movements. The head was created by Kevin Yagher and was an early idea of Chechik&#x27;s. Kleiser said &quot;when we didn&#x27;t light that baby head properly, it came across as a giant Chucky doll! Most of those shots worked by fluke.&quot; The hair on the puppet had to be dyed to match the twins, after their mother declined to have their own hair color modified.

===Lawsuits===
Disney was sued in 1991 by Paul Alter, a game show television director, who claimed to have come up with the idea of an oversized toddler after babysitting his granddaughter and watching her topple over building blocks. He wrote a film treatment titled &quot;Now, That&#x27;s a Baby!&quot; Alter claimed there were several similarities between the film and his treatment, which consisted of the baby daughter of two scientists falling victim to a genetic experiment gone wrong instead of an enlarging ray. The case went to trial in 1993, with the jury finding in Alter&#x27;s favor. Disney was forced to pay $300,000 in damages.

Author Kit Reed also filed a lawsuit, alleging similarities with her short story &quot;The Attack of the Giant Baby&quot;. The case was settled with Reed getting a &quot;special recognition&quot; credit.

==Release==

===Home media===
The film was first released on VHS and LaserDisc on January 6, 1993. It was released on a bare-bones DVD in 2002.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened on July 17, 1992 in 2,492 theaters in the United States and Canada, almost twice as many as the first film. It opened at number one ahead of &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; on its opening weekend with $11 million. The film ultimately grossed a total of $58.7 million in the United States and Canada. Internationally it grossed $37 million for a worldwide total of $96 million.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Honey, I Blew Up the Kid&quot; has an approval rating of 38% based on reviews from 21 critics, with an average rating of 4.80/10. On Metacritic the film has a score of 50 based on reviews from 14 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; claimed that the film &quot;feels narratively limited. It&#x27;s a one-joke movie: Adam just gets bigger and bigger. All Moranis needs to do is get the shrinker from the last movie and turn it on Adam.&quot; Also from &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Hal Hinson agreed that it was &quot;a one-joke film&quot; while also adding the film &quot;squanders most of the comic opportunities its premise offers. As one-joke movies go, it&#x27;s fairly inoffensive but also never better than mildly diverting.&quot; Roger Ebert, reviewing for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, criticized the weak story writing that there &quot;may be, for all I know, comic possibilities in a giant kid, but this movie doesn&#x27;t find them.&quot; He further concluded that the &quot;special effects, on the other hand, are terrific, as they were in the first movie. The filmmakers are able to combine the giant baby and the &quot;real world&quot; in shots that seem convincing, and the image of the toddler walking down Glitter Gulch is state-of-the-art. Too bad the movie relies on special effects to carry the show, and doesn&#x27;t bring much else to the party.&quot;

==Soundtrack==
Intrada Records released the record in 1992, in time for the film&#x27;s release. The score was composed and conducted by Bruce Broughton, who would return to provide the score for &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Audience&quot;. &quot;Stayin Alive&quot; by the Bee Gees appears in it. So does &quot;Loco-Motion&quot; by Carole King, Gerry Goffin, and &quot;Ours If We Want It&quot; written by Tom Snow and Mark Mueller. The soundtrack album consists of just the score. In 2017, the label released an expanded edition included Broughton&#x27;s score for &quot;Off His Rockers&quot;, the animated short that preceded the film in cinemas.

<doc id="924803" wikidata="Q3606488" url="?curid=924803" title="Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education">
<text>The Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (usually referred to simply as the Quality Assurance Agency or QAA) is the United Kingdom higher education sector&#x27;s independent expert quality body. It has a remit to maintain and enhance the quality of teaching and learning in tertiary education in the United Kingdom and beyond. It conducts quality assessment reviews, develops reference points and guidance for providers, and conducts or commissions research on relevant issues.

QAA has a United Kingdom-wide role on behalf of the sector maintaining sector-owned reference points including the United Kingdom Quality Code for Higher Education and Subject Benchmark Statements; QAA also maintains the Credit Frameworks used in the various nations of the United Kingdom, and the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications which applies throughout the United Kingdom except in Scotland.

QAA provides guidance and other publications, and runs events, relating to the maintenance of standards and the enhancement of quality of teaching and learning. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland these enhancement activities are part of the formal quality arrangements; in England they are provided through a separate membership scheme, through which the sector in England also contributes to the funding of the sector-owned reference points. 

QAA undertakes cyclical quality review of higher education institutions throughout the United Kingdom, except currently in England, where the regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), has not implemented a cyclical review approach and QAA has chosen to focus on its enhancement activity, including new paid-for services to help the sector meet regulatory requirements and enhance quality. 

In addition to its role in sustaining the reputation of United Kingdom higher education, QAA also regulates the Access to Higher Education Diploma, a qualification that enables individuals without A Levels or the usual equivalent to enter higher education.

QAA works closely with other organisations that have an interest in the reputation of United Kingdom higher education, including the Scottish Funding Council, HEFCW, Department for the Economy in Northern Ireland, Universities United Kingdom and GuildHE.

==Purpose and focus areas==
QAA&#x27;s purpose is &#x27;to ensure that students and learners experience the highest possible quality of education.&#x27; Its strategy sets out the scope of its work in terms of four focus areas: Standards (QAA is custodian of various sector reference points); Assurance and enhancement; International; Leadership (QAA advises governments and has a high public profile on matters of quality).

==Status and funding==
QAA is an independent body, a company limited by guarantee, and a registered charity in England, Wales and Scotland. Its objects and constitution are set out in its Articles of Association. Its board includes representatives of United Kingdom universities and other higher education institutions, further education colleges, funding councils, and students.

QAA&#x27;s funding comes from a combination of membership subscriptions from universities and colleges in the United Kingdom and internationally, contracts with United Kingdom higher education regulators, funding bodies and government departments, and commissioned work including international reviews and business development work.

It operates a flexible working policy but continues to maintain offices in Gloucester.

==Role and responsibilities==

===Higher education review work===
United Kingdom degree-awarding bodies (mainly universities) set their own standards for the degrees and other qualifications they award (academic degrees), but since most courses are partly or entirely publicly funded (including through student loans) there is a requirement that they undergo external review to demonstrate that a national &#x27;threshold&#x27; standard is met, and that quality is satisfactory. QAA is the body that undertakes this independent role in the United Kingdom. It does so through processes of peer review. Reviewers have extensive experience of higher education at a senior level, or are current or recent students.

While there are some differences between the methods used by QAA to achieve this, they have some key features in common. All reviews check that United Kingdom expectations are met; currently this is done by benchmarking the provision against QAA&#x27;s Quality Code (see below). Other resources used for benchmarks of academic standards include the &#x27;subject benchmark statements&#x27; (maintained by QAA in consultation with the academic community), relevant qualifications and credit frameworks, institutions&#x27; own rules and handbooks, standards set by professional bodies, and the European Standards and Guidelines maintained by the European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education (ENQA).

Each review results in a published report containing judgements on whether United Kingdom expectations are met. Separate judgements comment on academic standards, academic quality, and the public information provided about courses. Reports include recommendations for improvement, citations of good practice, and affirmations of actions taken by the higher education provider to improve since the last review.

QAA&#x27;s review methods are informed by a self-evaluation submitted in advance by each university or college, and by a &#x27;student submission&#x27; - a commentary by its students. At time of writing, review places an emphasis on the existence of robust academic management structures, and policies and approaches that enable national expectations to be fulfilled, combined with evidence that this is happening. Evidence is obtained in a variety of ways, including interviews with relevant individuals and structured discussions with student and staff focus groups.

QAA reviews do not generally look at individual courses or programmes of study, neither do they review or evaluate students&#x27; work.

===Guidance on quality and standards===
In cooperation with the United Kingdom higher education sector, QAA maintains the United Kingdom Quality Code for Higher Education (Quality Code - see below), the subject benchmark statements for bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees, and other guidance for helping higher education providers to meet agreed United Kingdom expectations. Where appropriate, QAA also works with professional, regulatory and statutory bodies, and employers, to ensure that its guidance is fit for purpose. Draft guidance is published on QAA&#x27;s website (via a tab on the home page), where it is accessible for public consultation before being formally published.

====The Quality Code====
The Quality Code (full name: United Kingdom Quality Code for Higher Education) sets out four expectations for standards and quality that must be met by United Kingdom higher education providers that receive any kind of public or student loan funding. These expectations are underpinned by core practices, which are mandatory for all United Kingdom providers, and common practices, which are mandatory in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

The Quality Code replaced the &#x27;Academic Infrastructure&#x27; (see below) in 2012 as the main reference point for checking on the quality of United Kingdom higher education, having been developed in close consultation with the United Kingdom higher education sector. In 2015 the Quality Code was extended to include the United Kingdom &#x27;frameworks for higher education qualifications&#x27; (specifying levels for the different higher education qualifications and defining these through &#x27;level descriptors&#x27;) and the subject benchmark statements (specifying what outcomes - knowledge, understanding, skills and attributes - are expected of bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s graduates in specific disciplines). The Code was revised in 2018 following the passing of the Higher Education and Research Act. Owned and maintained by QAA, it sets out &#x27;fundamental principles that should apply to higher education quality across the United Kingdom&#x27;.

The Quality Code covers:
* setting and maintaining standards, as determined by the United Kingdom qualifications frameworks and subject benchmark statements, together with other relevant guidance
* meeting United Kingdom expectations about the quality of the student experience, and seeking ways to enhance this
* providing trustworthy and reliable information about courses.

In Scotland the levels are different, being part of the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework). Wales also has an integrated academic credit and qualifications framework, while England has a separate credit framework maintained by QAA.

Higher education providers use the Quality Code, in conjunction with their own internal policies and other guidance, to design the programmes of study that lead to their higher education awards (including academic degrees). QAA reviewers use it to check that expectations are met when they conduct a review.

====Other guidance====
QAA provides other guidance to supplement the Quality Code (but which unlike the Quality Code is advisory rather than mandatory). The Quality Code is supported by advice and guidance, divided into twelve Themes. The Higher Education Credit Framework for England (see previous note) enables providers to allocate a credit tariff to courses and modules. Other guidance documents help universities and colleges to address particular student needs, such as learning about sustainable practices or enterprise and entrepreneurship, or they inform the public and students about the higher education experience, for example the balance between self-directed and structured learning.

QAA conducts or sponsors research projects and consultation events relating to quality in United Kingdom higher education and publishes guidance on topical issues. It also publishes analysis of the collective findings of its reports to identify emergent trends.

===Investigation of complaints and concerns===
QAA investigates allegations of &#x27;systemic failings&#x27; by higher education providers, whereas the Office of the Independent Adjudicator deals with individual complaints and grievances. Both systems are designed as a recourse for students who have already asked for an internal investigation into their complaint and have not found the outcome of this to be satisfactory.

Systemic failings are taken to mean a failure by a university or college in meeting its responsibilities for standards and quality. The concern needs to be supported by evidence. Where QAA deems a full investigation necessary it publishes its findings in a report.

===Advisory role on degree awarding powers and university title===
QAA advises the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, via government ministers, on the merits of applications for degree awarding powers or the right to be called a university. No organisation may award degrees or call itself a university in the United Kingdom unless authorised to do so by the government. Applications are considered by a dedicated QAA committee, the United Kingdom Advisory Committee on Degree Awarding Powers, enabling its board to offer advice to ministers.

===Regulation of the Access to Higher Education Diploma===
QAA is the regulator for the Access to Higher Education Diploma which enables adults without A-Levels or their equivalent to progress to higher education. Organisations known as Access Validating Agencies (AVAs) are responsible for validating and reviewing Access courses and awarding the Diploma to successful students. QAA licenses and monitors the AVAs and publishes information about its findings.

==International relations==
QAA conducts reviews of locations where courses are provided by, or on behalf of, United Kingdom degree-awarding bodies. It is a member of ENQA, and of the International Network for Quality Assurance Agencies in Higher Education (INQAAHE), meeting the quality criteria of both organisations in full. In 2014 the agency was added to the European Quality Assurance Register (EQAR). Having signed memoranda of cooperation with a number of overseas quality assurance bodies, QAA has been endorsed by the Asia Pacific Quality Network (APQN) for promoting international cooperation in quality assurance.

==History==
In 1996 the Joint Planning Group for Quality Assurance in Higher Education recommended that the then two streams of quality assurance in higher education - Subject Review and Academic Audit (which had been in use since 1991) - should be brought together under a single body. QAA was established In April 1997 through the transfer of functions and staff from the former Higher Education Quality Council and the quality assessment divisions of HEFCE and HEFCW.

===The Dearing Report and its legacy===
The Dearing Report published in 1997 &quot;gave the QAA the remit of providing assurance about standards and quality&quot;, following which it developed a higher education qualifications framework, a code of practice and subject benchmark statements, and established a pool of external examiners.

This laid the foundations for the so-called Academic Infrastructure, which QAA developed between 1997 and 2001 (a set of United Kingdom benchmarks for quality and standards) and the development of a new, United Kingdom-wide process of Academic Review which comprised elements of both Subject Review and Academic Audit - with an emphasis on the latter. The new process was introduced in Scotland, but before it had become fully operational across the United Kingdom a number of English universities complained about the administrative burden that this approach entailed, leading to a rethink by the Westminster government. The Scottish and Welsh higher education authorities took this opportunity to set up their own national arrangements, while in England QAA worked with the bodies representing higher education institutions (Universities United Kingdom and Guild HE) to devise a modified approach known as Institutional Audit. QAA Scotland developed the procedure known as Enhancement-Led Institutional Review (ELIR), while in Wales the method known as Institutional Review was established. Northern Ireland followed England and adopted Institutional Audit. QAA remained the organisation charged with developing and undertaking these activities.

It was agreed that in England there would be a transitional period of three years (2002 to 2005) during which all higher education institutions would undergo their first Institutional Audit. Thereafter audits would take place on a six-yearly cycle. In the year prior to their audit, institutions underwent &#x27;developmental engagements&#x27; - unpublished subject-based reviews to support internal quality assurance. There were also &#x27;discipline audit trails&#x27; (DATs) - selective subject-based enquiries that enabled a phased reduction of the subject focus of QAA reviews. In 2005 a revised Institutional Audit model was developed and adopted with the agreement of the representative bodies and HEFCE. This removed the DATs, thereby freeing time in the audit process to explore a broader range of topics and themes. This model continued in use on a six-year cycle until 2011.

===Criticism and reform===
In 2008, Professor Geoffrey Alderman, former chairman of University of London&#x27;s academic council, asserted there was a decline of academic standards in British higher education that resulted in grade inflation. At a parliamentary inquiry (17 July 2008), the then CEO of QAA, Peter Williams, told a select committee that there was no evidence of consistency in grades given between degree subjects and between institutions. A QAA report published prior to the inquiry said degree classifications were &quot;arbitrary and unreliable&quot;. The Select Committee published a report (2 August 2009) which proposed policy changes to expand QAA remit to ensure the meeting of consistent standards. The report claimed QAA at the time focused mainly on evaluating processes not standards. According to the report: 

In October 2009 a new Chief Executive was appointed (Anthony McClaran, formerly of UCAS), and measures were put in place to strengthen QAA&#x27;s reputation. These included an agenda to increase student participation and public engagement.
===The Browne Report and policy change===
The Browne Report (October 2010) commissioned by the Labour government, and the subsequent White Paper &#x27;Students at the heart of the system&#x27; published by the new Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition in summer 2011 had a substantial impact on QAA&#x27;s work. The introduction of tuition fees led to increased focus on how quality in higher education was managed and verified. Between 2011 and 2013, in consultation with the higher education sector, QAA phased in a new Quality Code to replace the Academic Infrastructure, and developed a new method of Institutional Review applicable to degree-awarding bodies in England and Northern Ireland, and (with some variation) in Wales. Under a separate method QAA also continued to review degree courses provided at further education colleges (validated by universities).

===Designation to review alternative providers===

In spring 2011, under the coalition government, the United Kingdom Border Agency announced a requirement for all private colleges that recruit students to United Kingdom higher education to undergo a standards and quality review by QAA. A successful outcome would be essential in order to obtain &#x27;Tier 4 accreditation&#x27; also known as &#x27;highly trusted sponsor&#x27; status. QAA accordingly conducted 260 of these &#x27;educational oversight&#x27; reviews in the first two years of operation, with 29 providers failing their review. Since the abolition of United KingdomBA, QAA has continued this work under the auspices of United Kingdom Visas and Immigration.

===Continuing questions about quality and risk===

Following the coalition government&#x27;s policy changes there was considerable opening up of higher education to more private providers, leading questions to be raised about the efficacy of the quality assurance system. It was thought by many opinion formers and academics that the &#x27;burden&#x27; of review needed to be adjusted according to the &#x27;risk&#x27; posed by a particular institution. There was an appetite for established universities to be subject to a lighter touch than further education colleges or new private providers.

In 2012 the Science and Technology Committee of the House of Lords, after considering the working of QAA, concluded that it was still not fit for purpose because its reviews were based on a &#x27;threshold level&#x27; of standards that &#x27;allowed no assessment of quality above that threshold&#x27; (paragraph 124) and that more needed to be done to improve quality (paragraph 125). The report recommended that QAA should involve employers in the development of subject benchmark statements and in the quality assurance of standards (paragraphs 130-132).

Accordingly, in parallel with its recently introduced &#x27;educational oversight&#x27; review methods, QAA developed Higher Education Review, which accommodated more flexibility and was applicable to all institutions subscribing to QAA (recognised and listed bodies).

===Regulatory reform and designation in England===

In 2017, the passing of the Higher Education and Research Act created a new regulatory framework for higher education in England, which included a &quot;Designated Quality Body&quot; (DQB). In February 2018, following Department for Education consultation in which 98% of respondents endorsed QAA, the Office for Students recommended QAA&#x27;s appointment as DQB in England. In addition to this role, QAA continued to maintain United Kingdom-wide responsibilities, including the United Kingdom Quality Code, subject benchmarks and review of United Kingdom transnational education (TNE).

<text>Hunter Dunagan Hancock (April 21, 1916 – September 11, 2001) was an American disc jockey regarded as the first in the Western United States to play rhythm and blues records on the radio, and among the first to broadcast rock and roll.

He was born in Uvalde, Texas, and raised away in San Antonio. After schooling, he took on many jobs, including singing in a vaudeville troupe and a stint at a Massachusetts burlesque club. After moving to Los Angeles in the early 1940s he entered radio and was heard on the following stations there: KFVD (1947–1951), KFOX (1951–1954), KFVD/KPOP (1954–1957) and KGFJ (1957–1966). Inspired by local black record store owner John Dolphin of Dolphin&#x27;s of Hollywood record shop, he called himself &quot;Ol&#x27; H.H.&quot; He hosted several shows on different stations, often at the same time, including &quot;Harlem Holiday&quot;, &quot;Harlematinee&quot;, &quot;Huntin&#x27; With Hunter&quot; and the gospel show &quot;Songs of Soul and Spirit&quot;.

Hancock became one of the emcees for the famed Cavalcade of Jazz concerts held at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles which were produced by Leon Hefflin Sr. starting with the fifth concert on July 10, 1949. He also emceed for the Cavalcade of Jazz concert held in San Diego at Lane Field on September 3, 1949. Hancock also wrote a column in the &quot;Los Angeles Sentinel&quot; newspaper. Hancock would continue to emcee until the fourteenth Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at the Shrine Auditorium on August 3, 1958. The final Cavalcade of Jazz concert was a tribute to the city&#x27;s most prominent R&amp;B disc-jockeys of the time as Charles Trammel, Huggy Boy (Dick Hugg) and Jim Randolph teamed up with Hancock for this event. Lionel Hampton, Big Jay McNeely, Dinah Washington, Betty Carter, Billy Eckstine, Jimmy Witherspoon, Louis Jordan, Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole, Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, and Sam Cooke were just a few of the numerous artists that performed over the years at the Cavalcade of Jazz concerts.

Hancock also appeared briefly on the L.A. CBS TV station, KNXT in 1955 with the Friday night show &quot;Rhythm and Bluesville&quot;, interviewing such musicians as Duke Ellington, Fats Domino, Little Richard, Gene &amp; Eunice and The Platters.

For several years, the Pulse radio listener survey rated Hancock&#x27;s shows No. 1 among black listeners in Southern California. In 1950, the &quot;Los Angeles Sentinel&quot; newspaper rated Hancock the most popular DJ in Los Angeles among blacks. He was also one of the first DJs to play rock and roll music, and landed a cameo spot in a 1957 British rock and roll film called &quot;Rock Around the World&quot;.

A recreated example of Hancock&#x27;s program on Los Angeles&#x27; former R&amp;B radio station KGFJ can be found on Ron Jacobs&#x27; &quot;Cruisin&#x27; 1959&quot; (Increase Records INCR 5-2004). This recreation includes several classic R&amp;B songs of that era, contemporary commercials (e.g., Champion spark plugs, the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;, and others), and DJ patter.
He was convicted in 1962 and sentenced to probation for failing to report $18,000 income on tax forms for 1956–1958. Allegedly, the money was payola from record companies. Hancock believed the money had been given as gifts.

Hancock died August 4, 2004, of natural causes in a retirement home in Claremont, California.

<doc id="924814" wikidata="Q396204" url="?curid=924814" title="Patriot Games">
<text>Patriot Games is a thriller novel, written by Tom Clancy and published in July 1987. &quot;Without Remorse&quot;, released six years later, is an indirect prequel, and it is chronologically the first book featuring Jack Ryan, the main character in most of Clancy&#x27;s novels. The novel focuses on Ryan being the target of Irish terrorist group Ulster Liberation Army for thwarting their kidnapping attempt on the Prince and Princess of Wales in London. It debuted at number one on the New York Times bestseller list. A film adaptation, starring Harrison Ford as Ryan, premiered on June 5, 1992.

==Plot==
An attempt to kidnap the Prince and Princess of Wales and their infant son occurs on the Mall in London. The attack is orchestrated by the Ulster Liberation Army, a splinter group of the Provisional Irish Republican Army. However, Jack Ryan intervenes, incapacitating one attacker, Sean Miller. During the gun battle, Ryan is wounded by John Michael McCrory as they exchange gunfire. McCrory is killed and Miller is arrested.

While recovering, Ryan is honored by the British government and is knighted. Meanwhile, Miller is sentenced to life imprisonment for the kidnapping attempt; however, his ULA compatriots led by Kevin O&#x27;Donnell free him while he is being transported to a maximum security prison. Their Libyan allies aid them in escaping to their secret camp in the North African desert; Miller vows revenge on Ryan.

Ryan returns to teach history at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, confident that the ULA will not attack him in the United States. Unbeknownst to him, Miller had persuaded O&#x27;Donnell to launch an operation in the U.S. aimed at targeting Ryan and his family, and had recruited the assistance of an African-American domestic terrorist group known as &quot;the Movement&quot; to do so. Though primarily for revenge, the operation is also designed to reduce American support for the rival PIRA, which is to be blamed for the upcoming attack. The assassin sent to kill Ryan is intercepted before he completes his task, however his wife, Cathy, and daughter, Sally, are seriously injured when Miller causes their car to crash on a freeway; they are transported to the hospital for treatment.

After the attack on his family, Ryan returns to Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as an analyst. Later, the Prince and Princess of Wales visit Ryan at the Ryan&#x27;s Maryland home. However, this provides another opportunity for the ULA, once again recruiting the services of &quot;the Movement&quot;. They launch a sneak attack on the Ryan home to kidnap the Prince and Princess of Wales, as well as Ryan&#x27;s family.

Although several guards around the house are killed, Ryan, his friend, Robert &quot;Robby&quot; Jackson, and the Prince dispatch several terrorists. The local police, the United States Marines, and U.S. Naval Academy sailors prevent the remaining terrorists from escaping the country. Ryan tries to kill a cornered Miller, but is restrained. After the ULA terrorists are apprehended, Ryan arrives in Annapolis for his son, Jack Ryan, Jr.&#x27;s birth.

==Themes==
&quot;Patriot Games&quot; was notable for subverting the moral ambiguity of the antagonists in espionage novels by John le Carré, Len Deighton, and Robert Ludlum. According to Marc Cerasini&#x27;s essay on the novel, &quot;Clancy&#x27;s sensible revulsion toward the terrorists is so strident and intense...that it verges on the physical.&quot; He added that &quot;the author&#x27;s understandable disgust toward his villains is &#x27;bourgeois&#x27;, for there is not a shred of sympathy for these Irish &#x27;patriots&#x27;.&quot;

The novel is also said to be inspired by the gothic horror genre in the depiction of the ULA as &quot;twisted political misfits&quot; who practice political violence in the vein of Count Dracula and his &quot;family&quot;, as well as other gothic elements like the presence of the Prince and Princess of Wales.

==Development==
Clancy started working on &quot;Patriot Games&quot; in 1979, along with other novels which would later be published: &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; (1984) and &quot;The Cardinal of the Kremlin&quot; (1988). He says of his passion for accuracy and detail: &quot;When I was in London, researching &quot;Patriot Games&quot;, I spent 20 hours walking around the Mall with a camera, clipboard and tape recorder, just choreographing my opening chapter, to make sure it would happen exactly the way I wrote it. Later, when I took my kids there, I could tell them, &#x27;This is the tree that Jack Ryan hid his wife and daughter behind, and that&#x27;s the road where the bad guys escaped.&#x27; I feel a moral obligation to my readers to get it right. In the insurance business, you have to pay attention to details or a client could lose everything. A doctor has to, a cop, a fireman, why not a writer?&quot; Although he was criticized for doubling down on technical details in the novel, Clancy considers &quot;Patriot Games&quot; to be his best.

Discussing the final scene where Jack Ryan lets the primary antagonist Sean Miller live instead of killing him, Clancy remarked: &quot;Of all the letters I got on &quot;Patriot Games&quot;, not one said, &#x27;He should have killed the little bastard.&#x27; Personally I&#x27;d have done it. You harm my kids and I&#x27;ll blow you away. You don&#x27;t touch my kids. But I&#x27;m not Jack Ryan. He has to be in control. He plays by the rules.&quot;

==Reception==
Commercially, &quot;Patriot Games&quot; debuted at number one on the New York Times bestseller list for the week of August 2, 1987. It has since sold over 1,063,000 hardcover copies by the next year.

Critically, the book received generally positive reviews. &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised it as &quot;a powerful piece of popular fiction; its plot, if implausible, is irresistible, and its emotions are universal.&quot; However, Kirkus Reviews&#x27;s verdict is mixed, stating that &quot;Exciting shoot-outs and chases, and lots of Royal wish-fulfillment; but without naval authenticity to bolster the prose, Clancy is a fish out of water.&quot;

==Film adaptation==

The novel was adapted as a feature film, which was released on June 5, 1992. Jack Ryan was played by Harrison Ford and Sean Miller was played by Sean Bean. The film is notable for being the sequel to the previous movie &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; (1990), although the order is the opposite in the books. Additionally, the Prince and Princess of Wales were replaced by Lord Holmes, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Queen&#x27;s cousin, as the ULA&#x27;s primary target. &quot;Patriot Games&quot; spent two weeks as the No. 1 film, eventually grossing $178,051,587 in worldwide box office business. It has garnered generally positive reviews, and earned a 73% &quot;Fresh&quot; rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 33 reviews.

Conversely, the movie was criticized by Clancy for deviating too much from the source material, stating that &quot;I don&#x27;t like eating dirt, and I won&#x27;t eat any from these guys.&quot; &quot;There is only one, maybe two, scenes in the shooting script that correspond to a scene in the book,&quot; Clancy later added. &quot;They have a movie called &quot;Patriot Games&quot; that uses my characters—but it&#x27;s not my story.&quot; He eventually asked for his name to be removed from the film&#x27;s promotional materials, and in an apparent countermove, entered negotiations with the same team at Paramount Pictures to sell the rights to his other novel &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot; (1991). By the time the film was released in 2002, the author had cooled off on the idea of having his books made into films.
