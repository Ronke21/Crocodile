<doc id="929809" wikidata="Q1051987" url="?curid=929809" title="Characters of the Mortal Kombat series">
<text>This is a list of playable and boss characters from the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; fighting game franchise and the games in which they appear. Created by Ed Boon and John Tobias, the series depicts conflicts between various realms. Most characters fight on behalf of their realm, with the primary heroes defending Earthrealm against conquering villains from Outworld and the Netherrealm. Early installments feature the characters participating in the eponymous Mortal Kombat tournament to decide their realm&#x27;s fate. In later installments, Earthrealm is often invaded by force.

A total of 77 playable fighters have been featured in the series, in addition to unplayable bosses and guest characters. Much of the franchise&#x27;s mainstays were introduced during the first three games. Nearly all of the characters have been killed at a point in the story, but have rarely stayed dead.
==Introduced in &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (1992)==
===Goro===
: Portrayed by: Tom Woodruff Jr. (1995 film)
: Voiced by: Herman Sanchez (&quot;MK4&quot;); Ken Lally (2011 game); Vic Chao (&quot;MKX&quot;, &quot;MK1&quot;); Kevin Michael Richardson (1995 film, &quot;Scorpion&#x27;s Revenge&quot;); Ron Feinberg (&quot;The Journey Begins&quot;); Angus Sampson (2021 film)

Goro is the sub-boss of the first &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; game. He is a Shokan, a half-human, half-dragon race distinguished by his four arms and enormous size. He became Grand Champion of the Mortal Kombat tournament after defeating the Great Kung Lao, and held the title for the next 500 years as part of evil sorcerer Shang Tsung&#x27;s plan to manipulate the tournament in order to achieve Outworld emperor Shao Kahn&#x27;s goal of dominance of Earthrealm. However, these plans were thwarted when the Earthrealm warrior Liu Kang defeated both Goro and Shang Tsung, allowing Earthrealm to regain control of the tournament. Goro disappeared thereafter and was believed to be dead. In &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;, Goro is succeeded by another member of his race, Kintaro, and is not seen again until the 1996 compilation game &quot;Mortal Kombat Trilogy&quot;, in which all the characters from the first three series games were playable. Goro was initially omitted from &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; (1997), but was included as a sub-boss in the home versions of the game.

In the training mode of &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance&quot; (2002), Goro is mortally wounded and presumed dead. In the 2004 follow-up game &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot;, he has been saved from death by Shao Kahn, with the promise of returning his fellow Shokan to their former glory and the banishment of their archenemies, the Centaurs, in exchange for his allegiance, and resumes his place at Shao Kahn&#x27;s side. Goro was not playable in either game. He is a boss character in the 2005 beat &#x27;em up title &quot;Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks&quot;. In the 2011 &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series reboot, Goro resumes his role as the sub-boss of the Shaolin Tournament from the first game, and is again defeated by Liu Kang in the story mode. He is playable in the 2015 title &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; (2015) as a bonus pre-order character, again serving as a sub-boss in the game&#x27;s arcade-ladder mode. In &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; (2019), Goro&#x27;s corpse appears in the story mode and in his &quot;Lair&quot; stage during gameplay. Goro appears in &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot; as an assist character, or &quot;Kameo Fighter&quot;, and via a minor appearance in the story mode as a member of General Shao&#x27;s army.

Goro&#x27;s original design was as a two-armed humanoid character named Rokuro, a member of &quot;a race of demon warriors&quot; who would join the tournament &quot;to restore the pride and respect of his race&quot;. Series creators Ed Boon and John Tobias drew design inspiration from the stop motion adventure films of Ray Harryhausen, especially his depiction of Kali in &quot;The Golden Voyage of Sinbad&quot; in redesigning Goro with four arms. He was originally named &quot;Gongoro&quot; before his final name was determined, and was constructed as a stop-motion clay figurine that eventually fell apart after excessive use in capturing its movements for the game.

Goro has a prominent role in Malibu Comics&#x27; &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series that followed the events of the first game, and was the subject of the 1994 three-issue miniseries &quot;Goro: Prince of Pain&quot;. In the 2015 DC Comics &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; prequel series, he is featured in a subplot that shows him fighting and being maimed by Kotal Kahn in a battle for the Outworld throne. Goro is the reigning champion in the 1995 film &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; that follows the events of the original game, and was a life-sized animatronic model that cost over $1 million to construct and required over a dozen puppeteers to operate. Goro again reprised his role as the defending tournament champion in the 2020 animated film &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion&#x27;s Revenge&quot; that retold the events of the original game, but was a supporting villain in the 2021 live-action reboot film &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, in which he was computer-generated.

Goro has received positive critical reception for his formidableness as a boss character in the games, but his cinematic portrayals, particularly in the 2021 film, have been negatively received. Michael Kennedy of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; commented in 2021, &quot;While the puppetry used to bring Goro to life [in the 1995 film] had its limitations, Goro played a vital role in the story, serving as a major roadblock to thunder god Raiden&#x27;s defense of Earthrealm. While he returned in &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; 2021, his inclusion felt more like an afterthought than anything.&quot;

==Introduced in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;==
===Baraka===
:Portrayed by: Richard Divizio (&quot;MKII&quot;); Sean Okerberg (&quot;MKvsDCU&quot;); Dennis Keiffer (&quot;Annihilation&quot;); Lateef Crowder (&quot;Rebirth&quot;); Fraser Aitcheson (&quot;Legacy&quot;); CJ Bloomfield (&quot;Mortal Kombat 2&quot;)
:Voiced by: Dan Forden (&quot;MKG&quot;); Eric Wackerfuss (&quot;MK:D&quot;); Dan Washington (&quot;MKvsDCU&quot;); Bob Carter (&quot;MK9&quot;); Greg Eagles (&quot;MKX&quot;); Steve Blum (2019-present)

Baraka is a member of a lowly Outworld race called the Tarkatans, who are known for their violent and unpredictable behavior and characterized by long gnashing teeth and a set of forearm-implanted retractable blades. He spearheads the attack on Liu Kang&#x27;s Shaolin temple following the conclusion of the first Mortal Kombat tournament, which in turn lures Liu Kang into Outworld to seek vengeance. In &quot;Mortal Kombat Trilogy&quot;, he is a member of Shao Kahn&#x27;s forces that takes part in the invasion of Earthrealm. Baraka is not playable in the next fighting installment, &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; (1997), but was added to the roster of the 2000 Sega Dreamcast-exclusive upgrade &quot;Mortal Kombat Gold&quot;, in which Quan Chi offers him a chance to rule the Outworld realm of Edenia by his side if he agrees to join the fallen Elder God Shinnok&#x27;s army. While Baraka accepts, he secretly plans to betray his new masters. In &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot;, Baraka and the remainder of his Tarkatan (formerly &quot;Nomad&quot;) race ally themselves with the arisen Dragon King Onaga, and recruits the mutant clone Mileena into Onaga&#x27;s ranks in order to pose as Kitana. While Baraka is playable along with the entire series roster in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot; (2006), he was not among the seventeen characters therein who received an official biography by Midway and he played no part in the game&#x27;s storyline.

Baraka is a recurring foe in the story mode of 2011 &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; reboot, in which the events of the first three games are retold, and he is defeated by Johnny Cage, Cyrax, Jax, and Jade. In the retold storyline of &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;, he leads his Tarkatan armies in an invasion of Earthrealm. He is not playable in &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot;, but appears in the game&#x27;s story mode when his fellow Tarkatans aid D&#x27;Vorah in loading captive Shaolin monks before they are confronted and defeated by Raiden, Liu Kang, and Kung Lao. In a flashback sequence, Baraka serves under then-Outworld ruler Mileena alongside D&#x27;Vorah, but during a meeting with the Osh-Tekk Kotal Kahn, Baraka is killed after D&#x27;Vorah betrays Mileena. In &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;, a past version of Baraka is brought to the present by the keeper of time Kronika. After learning of his death and Kotal Kahn rendering the Tarkatans to near-extinction, he initially allies himself with Kronika and a similarly time-displaced Shao Kahn. However, Kitana convinces him to aid her in rescuing Kotal, and he and the Tarkatans take part in Kitana&#x27;s battle against Shao Kahn and in the final battle against Kronika.

In the new third timeline depicted in 2023 &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;, he was once a well-respected Outworld merchant prior to becoming a leader of the Tarkatans, a species of mutated individuals who are exposed to the mysterious Tarkat virus and outcast to a disarrayed Outworld colony.

The character was first conceived by &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; co-creator John Tobias as a &quot;savage barbarian demon warrior&quot; who was initially planned to be in the first &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; game. He was visualized for &quot;MKII&quot; with a Nosferatu mask adorned with silver-painted false fingernails serving as his teeth, while his arm blades were constructed from silver cardboard.

Baraka appears briefly in the 1997 feature film &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot;, played by stuntman Dennis Keiffer. He has no dialogue and is killed in a fight scene with Liu Kang, and is only identified by name in the closing credits. In the 2010 short film &quot;Mortal Kombat: Rebirth&quot;, Baraka is played by martial artist Lateef Crowder and depicted in the film&#x27;s alternate modern setting as a psychotic former plastic surgeon named &quot;Dr. Alan Zane&quot;, who surgically attaches a pair of long metal blades to his forearms. He later kills Jax&#x27;s undercover operative, Johnny Cage, in a fight. These changes were not carried over into the 2011 web series &quot;Mortal Kombat: Legacy&quot;, in which he was played by Fraser Aitcheson and was reverted to his original Outworld origins. Baraka makes a brief appearance in the 2021 animated film &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, in which he has no dialogue and is killed in a fight against Cage. CJ Bloomfield will play the character in the feature film &quot;Mortal Kombat 2&quot;.

In 2009, Baraka ranked third on GameDaily&#x27;s list of the &quot;top ten ugliest game characters&quot;. Dan Ryckert of &quot;Game Informer&quot;, in 2010, noted him among the characters wanted for the 2011 reboot game, as he felt that &quot;people love Baraka&quot; yet noted his absence in subsequent releases since his series debut. Baraka has otherwise received positive reception from gaming media outlets for his character and Fatalities.

===Jade===
===Jax===
===Kintaro===
: Voiced by: Rhasaan Orange (2011 game), Dave B. Mitchell (&quot;Battle of the Realms&quot;)

Kintaro is the sub-boss for both &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; and also in the 2011 reboot. He is also the penultimate boss of Mortal Kombat&quot;Shaolin Monks&quot;. A Shokan, he shares his species&#x27; four arms and imposing size, but is distinguished by his tiger-like stripes. Kintaro participates in Shao Kahn&#x27;s attempt to conquer Earthrealm during the second game&#x27;s tournament, in which he is defeated by Liu Kang. In the reboot, he is defeated by Kung Lao during the tournament. The reboot also establishes him as being responsible for Kabal&#x27;s injuries. In the 2015 &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; prequel comic, Kintaro is killed by Sonya Blade while she is under Havik&#x27;s control.

The character was a stop-motion clay figure whose design was inspired by the Japanese mythological character Kintarō. He was initially conceived for &quot;MKII&quot; as an anthropomorphic fur-lined bipedal tiger, but the concept was scrapped due to the difficulty of creating such a complicated outfit. According to series co-creator John Tobias, Kintaro was redesigned as a &quot;Goro spinoff&quot; who was possibly a Shokan general, but not royalty.

Kintaro appears in the animated film &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Battle of the Realms&quot;, voiced by Dave B. Mitchell.

Kintaro has received a middling reception due to his minor role in the series and is often unfavorably compared to Goro; UGO Networks opined in 2012 that Kintaro &quot;serves no real purpose except for being a reskinned Goro whose sole purpose is to avenge the aforementioned&#x27;s death&quot; in the conclusion of the original game. &quot;Game Informer&quot;, in 2021, rated him 56th among the series&#x27; 76 playable characters: &quot;Kintaro’s arrival wasn’t as impactful as Goro&#x27;s since the Shokan boss thing had already been done before. NetherRealm also seems content with giving him more and more feline attributes in place of a personality.&quot; &quot;Den of Geek&quot; wrote that he &quot;has virtually no story to speak of outside of the [&quot;MK9&quot;] retcon&quot;. His &quot;Reverse Rip&quot; from the reboot was rated 35th by Prima Games in their 2014 list of the series&#x27; top fifty Fatalities.

===Noob Saibot===
:Portrayed by: Daniel Pesina (&quot;MKII&quot;); John Turk (&quot;UMK3&quot;, &quot;MK4&quot;); Lawrence Kern (2011 game, &quot;MK11&quot;); J. J. Perry (&quot;Annihilation&quot;); Kimball Uddin (&quot;Conquest&quot;), Joe Taslim (&quot;Mortal Kombat 2&quot;)
:Voiced by: Ed Boon (&quot;MK:D&quot;); Jamieson Price (2011 game); Sean Chiplock (&quot;MK11&quot;); Kaiji Tang (&quot;MK1&quot;)

Noob Saibot is an undead wraith from the Netherrealm and a member of a cult called the Brotherhood of the Shadow who worships a fallen Elder God, later revealed to be Shinnok. In &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot;, he discovers, reactivates, and reprograms the cyborg ninja Smoke, intending to use his body as the basis for an undead cyborg army. In his ending, he is revealed to be a resurrected Bi-Han, who previously operated as Sub-Zero before he was killed by Scorpion. In &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (2011), Saibot is resurrected off-screen by Quan Chi and Shao Kahn. While defending the former&#x27;s &quot;Soulnado&quot;, Saibot is defeated by his brother and new Sub-Zero Kuai Liang and presumed dead after being pulled into the Soulnado. In &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;, Saibot resurfaces as a servant of Kronika, having gained increased power. In the new timeline depicted in &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;″s DLC expansion &quot;Khaos Reigns&quot; (2024), Bi-Han is captured by Titan Havik, who converts him into Saibot.

The character&#x27;s name comes from the last names of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;″s creators, Ed Boon and John Tobias, spelled backwards. Saibot first appeared in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; (&quot;MKII&quot;) as a non-playable hidden character and a solid-black palette swap of the game&#x27;s other male ninja characters, whom players could fight after winning fifty straight matches. Spurred by the positive reaction to the hidden character Reptile from the first game, Boon added Saibot to &quot;MKII&quot; without Tobias&#x27; knowledge, though Tobias would later create the character&#x27;s initial backstory as a Netherrealm wraith.

He makes a cameo appearance in &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot;, played by J. J. Perry, and in a self-titled episode of &quot;Mortal Kombat: Conquest&quot;, played by martial artist Kimball Uddin.

Noob Saibot has received positive critical reception, and particularly for his &quot;Make a Wish&quot; Fatality from the 2011 reboot game. In July 2011, &quot;The Daily Show&quot;″s Jon Stewart played a video of the finisher while explaining the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling that the ESRB could regulate video games without government intervention.

===Shao Kahn===
===Smoke===
: Portrayed by: Daniel Pesina (&quot;MKII&quot;); John Turk (&quot;UMK3&quot;); Noah Fleder (&quot;MK1&quot;); Ridley Tsui (&quot;Annihilation&quot;)
: Voiced by: Ed Boon (&quot;MKII&quot;, &quot;UMK3&quot;, &quot;MK:A&quot;); Ken Lally (2011 game); Andrew Bowen (&quot;MKX&quot;); Jeremy Ratchford (&quot;Defenders of the Realm&quot;); Matthew Mercer (&quot;Battle of the Realms&quot;); Yuri Lowenthal (&quot;MK1&quot;)

Smoke debuted in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; (&quot;MKII&quot;) as a non-playable hidden character who emanates smoke from his body and randomly appears at the start of a match to provide vague clues on how to find and fight him, for which specific requirements had to be met by players. Appearing as an unlockable playable character in &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; (&quot;MK3&quot;), he is stated to be a Lin Kuei assassin who works with Kuai Liang / Sub-Zero. After their clan starts turning their best warriors into cyborgs, Smoke attempts to join Kuai Liang in leaving the Lin Kuei. However, the former is captured, converted, and forced to hunt the latter against his will. With Kuai Liang&#x27;s help, Smoke discovers he still retains his soul and aids him in defeating Lin Kuei cyborgs Cyrax and Sektor, only to be captured by Shao Kahn&#x27;s forces. During the events of &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot;, Smoke is reactivated and reprogrammed by Noob Saibot into serving him as his ally and template for an army of cyber-demons. In &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot;, Smoke helps Saibot stage an assault on a Lin Kuei temple in Arctika until he is defeated by Taven.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (2011), during which Raiden creates a new timeline while attempting to avert the events of &quot;Armageddon&quot;, Smoke is rewritten to become Tomas Vrbada, a Czech member of the Lin Kuei who can transform into his namesake. As a child, he was kidnapped by a cult who sought to sacrifice him to a demon, only for Smoke to become an enenra and slay the cultists. In the present, Smoke is chosen by Raiden to help him stop Shao Kahn from taking over Earthrealm. Though Raiden saves Smoke from becoming a cyborg, Kuai Liang is converted in his place before Smoke is killed by Shao Kahn&#x27;s queen Sindel. Following this, Smoke is resurrected by Quan Chi as an undead revenant, a role he fulfills while making a minor non-playable appearance in &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; (&quot;MKX&quot;). Additionally, the downloadable playable character Triborg possesses a form based on Smoke&#x27;s cyborg form.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot; (&quot;MK1&quot;), in which Fire God Liu Kang creates a third new timeline, Tomas / Smoke is rewritten once more to become an adoptive brother to Bi-Han / Sub-Zero and Kuai Liang / Scorpion after Smoke&#x27;s family was killed for accidentally trespassing on Lin Kuei grounds. Though he lacks supernatural abilities, Smoke is skilled in practical magic. After Bi-Han betrays them to join forces with Shang Tsung, Smoke joins Kuai Liang in breaking off to found the Shirai Ryu clan to oppose him.

Smoke, based on his &quot;MK3&quot; portrayal, appears in the &quot;Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm&quot; episode &quot;Old Friends Never Die&quot;. He appears in &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot;, in which he is killed in battle by Liu Kang.

Smoke has received mostly positive reception, while his &quot;Earth Detonation&quot; Fatality from &quot;MK3&quot; has been noted by critics for its outlandish nature.

==Introduced in &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; and updates==
===Chameleon===
: Portrayed by: John Turk (&quot;MKT&quot;)
: Voiced by: Ed Boon (&quot;MKT&quot;)

Chameleon is a mysterious warrior who possesses the abilities of all the franchise&#x27; male ninjas. He is distinguished by his partially transparent appearance and an outfit that constantly changes its colors. Chameleon appeared in the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and PC versions of &quot;Mortal Kombat Trilogy&quot; with no biography or ending; he is instead only referred to as &quot;one of Shao Kahn&#x27;s deadliest warriors&quot;. His &quot;Armageddon&quot; ending is also vague, revealing only that he had sought to become Mortal Kombat champion since the events of the first game.

The character was ranked 32nd in UGO&#x27;s 2012 selection of the top fifty series characters, who wrote &quot;They say copying is a form of flattery, so Chameleon makes our list.&quot; &quot;Complex&quot; rated him tenth in their 2011 selection of the series&#x27; ten &quot;most underrated characters&quot;, but &quot;IGN&quot;&#x27;s Mitchell Saltzman listed Chameleon and Khameleon as two of the worst &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; characters. &quot;Unlike all of the other ninja palette swaps that eventually gained their own identity and playstyle, both Chameleons ... feel more like gimmicks than anything.&quot;

===Cyrax===
:Portrayed by: Sal Divita (&quot;MK3&quot;, &quot;UMK3&quot;); Shane Warren Jones (&quot;Legacy&quot;)
:Voiced by: Rhasaan Orange (2011 game); Ike Amadi (&quot;MK11&quot;); Artt Butler (&quot;Battle of the Realms&quot;); Enuka Okuma(&quot;MK1&quot;)

Cyrax is an assassin and Botswanan member of the Lin Kuei clan who agreed to become a cyborg. First appearing in &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot;, he and fellow cyborg Sektor are tasked with finding and killing former member Kuai Liang. Amidst Outworld emperor Shao Kahn&#x27;s invasion of Earthrealm however, Cyrax is captured by Kuai Liang, who reprograms him to help him defeat Shao. In &quot;Mortal Kombat Gold&quot; (2000), Cyrax experiences flashbacks of his former life as Sonya Blade and Jax Briggs bring him to the Outer World Investigation Agency (OIA) headquarters to restore his humanity. In return, Cyrax joins the agency as a scout. In &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance&quot;, Cyrax encounters the vampire Nitara, who offers to help him return to Earthrealm in exchange for his assistance in finding Onaga&#x27;s egg.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (2011), following Raiden&#x27;s alterations to the timeline, Cyrax is rewritten to become a human Tswana member of the Lin Kuei who relies on his chi and opposes the &quot;Cyber Initiative&quot;. Nonetheless, he is captured and forcibly converted off-screen. He and Sektor later capture Kuai Liang and take him to be converted as well before aligning themselves with Shao Kahn and assisting him in his invasion of Earthrealm, only to be defeated by Nightwolf. As of &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;, Cyrax joined forces with Kronika to help Sektor bolster her forces with more cyborgs. However, Kuai Liang and Hanzo Hasashi defeat Cyrax, causing him to realize what happened to him, then convince him to help them stop her instead. Though Kuai Liang promises to help restore him, Cyrax chooses to sacrifice himself to destroy Sektor&#x27;s cyber factory.

Two incarnations of Cyrax appear in &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;. The original appears as an assist character, or &quot;Kameo Fighter&quot;, while a female incarnation appears as a downloadable playable character via the &quot;Khaos Reigns&quot; DLC. After Fire God Liu Kang creates another new timeline while stopping Kronika, Cyrax was rewritten once more to become a Nigerien Lin Kuei clanswoman and Sektor&#x27;s apprentice who wears a powered suit developed by the latter. Initially believing her grandmaster Bi-Han&#x27;s deception, she later discovers his corrupt nature and defects to the Shirai Ryu.

The original Cyrax appears in the &quot;Mortal Kombat: Legacy&quot; episode &quot;Cyrax &amp; Sektor&quot;, played by Shane Warren Jones.

According to John Tobias, Cyrax and the cyber ninjas were inspired by the Predator and Boba Fett.

The original Cyrax was included in GamesRadar&#x27;s 2011 list of &quot;gaming&#x27;s most malicious machines&quot;, and &quot;Complex&quot; ranked him the fourth-coolest robot in video games in 2012. His episode of &quot;Legacy&quot; was well received, but critical reaction to his Fatalities has been mixed.

===Ermac===
===Kabal===
:Portrayed by: Richard Divizio (&quot;MK3&quot;, &quot;UMK3&quot; and &quot;MKT&quot;); Carlos Pesina (&quot;MK:D, MK:A&quot;); Daniel Nelson (2021 film)
:Voiced by: Jarod Pranno (&quot;MK:A&quot;); David Lodge (2011 game); Jonathan Cahill (&quot;MK11&quot;); Kevin Michael Richardson (&quot;Defenders of the Realm&quot;); Damon Herriman (2021 film); Keith Silverstein (&quot;Snow Blind&quot;)

Kabal is a former member of Kano&#x27;s Black Dragon crime syndicate and one of Raiden&#x27;s champions in defending Earthrealm who was attacked, maimed, and scarred by Shao Kahn&#x27;s extermination squads. As a result, Kabal was forced to wear a respirator to survive and left the Black Dragon. Following an appearance as a non-playable character (NPC) in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance&quot;, Kabal returns in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot;, in which he is tasked by Havik with restoring the Black Dragon. In pursuit of this, he recruits arms dealer Kira and martial artist turned killer Kobra. In &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot;, Kabal confronts the demigod Taven and offers the latter membership into the Black Dragon, but is defeated.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (2011), after Raiden alters the timeline to avert the events of &quot;Armageddon&quot;, Kabal is rewritten to become a former Black Dragon member who became a NYPD riot control officer partnered with Kurtis Stryker. Amidst Shao Kahn&#x27;s invasion of Earthrealm, Kabal is grievously injured by Kintaro and kidnapped by Kano, who nurses him back to health with help from the sorcerer Shang Tsung and outfits him with a respirator due to his lungs being damaged beyond repair. Kabal eventually escapes to join Raiden and his champions in defending Earthrealm, only to be killed by Shao&#x27;s queen, Sindel and converted by the necromancer Quan Chi into one of his undead revenant slaves. In this state, Kabal makes minor appearances in &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot;, in which he appears as an NPC, and &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;, which additionally features a young time-displaced Kabal who had yet to leave the Black Dragon.

Kabal appears in the &quot;Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm&quot; episode &quot;Amends&quot;, which is based on his &quot;MK3&quot; backstory; the script for &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot; before he was cut during production; &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (2021) as one of Shang Tsung&#x27;s champions before he is killed by Liu Kang; and &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Snow Blind&quot; as a member of the Black Dragon.

Kabal was originally nicknamed &quot;Sandman&quot; during production of &quot;MK3&quot; before his name was determined. According to &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; co-creator John Tobias, Kabal&#x27;s overall design was inspired by the Tusken Raiders from &quot;Star Wars&quot; while his mask&#x27;s circular lenses were inspired by 1940s-style aviator goggles. Tobias, however, expressed his dissatisfaction with Kabal&#x27;s original design in a 2012 interview.

Kabal has received mostly positive critical reception, but received notoriety for being overpowered in &quot;MK3&quot;, while response to his Fatalities throughout his series appearances has been mixed.

===Khameleon===
: Portrayed by: Becky Gable (&quot;MKT&quot;)
: Voiced by: Johanna Añonuevo (&quot;Armageddon&quot;), Courtenay Taylor (&quot;MK1&quot;)

Khameleon is a Zaterran who possesses the abilities of the franchise&#x27;s female ninjas. She is the last known female of her race. She was introduced in the Nintendo 64 version of &quot;Mortal Kombat Trilogy&quot;. Due to Shao Kahn&#x27;s role in her race&#x27;s near extinction, Khameleon seeks revenge against him. Khameleon was the franchise&#x27;s only previously playable character excluded in the original release of &quot;Armageddon&quot;, but was added to the Wii version. Series art director Steve Beran acknowledged that she was included in &quot;Armageddon&quot; due to heavy fan demand.

In the new timeline depicted in &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;, Khameleon is a Saurian and the first of her kind to join the Umgadi, warrior priestesses who guard Outworld&#x27;s royal family. Additionally, she also appears as a downloadable assist character, or &quot;Kameo Fighter&quot;.

The character placed 33rd in UGO&#x27;s selection of the top fifty series characters, but &quot;IGN&quot;&#x27;s Mitchell Saltzman listed Khameleon with Chameleon among the series&#x27; worst. &quot;Unlike all of the other ninja palette swaps that eventually gained their own identity and playstyle, both Chameleons ... feel more like gimmicks than anything.&quot;

===Motaro===
:Portrayed by: Deron McBee (&quot;Annihilation&quot;)
Motaro is a Centaurian from Outworld who possesses immense strength, the ability to teleport, fire energy blasts from his tail, and deflect incoming projectiles. First appearing as a sub-boss in &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; and its updates, he leads Shao Kahn&#x27;s extermination squads during his invasion of Earthrealm. Motaro returns in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot; as a minotaur due to a curse on his species placed by the Shokan.

Motaro makes minor non-speaking appearances in &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (2011) and &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot; (MK1), with the former seeing him being killed by Raiden and the latter seeing him serve as a member of General Shao&#x27;s rebellion. Additionally, Motaro appears as an unlockable assist character, or &quot;Kameo Fighter&quot;, in MK1 and his quadrupedal physique was restored for both games.

Motaro has also appeared in &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot;, &quot;Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm&quot;, and &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion&#x27;s Revenge&quot;.

John Tobias said that Motaro was inspired by a Micronauts toy figure of Baron Karza, which could be turned into a centaur by combining the toy with a horse figure packaged alongside it. Described by Ed Boon as one of the &quot;oddest shaped&quot; &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; characters, Motaro was nearly excluded from &quot;Armageddon&quot; due to the developers&#x27; difficulty of compensating for his unique half-horse body shape. With fans desiring to see the character return, the developers removed Motaro&#x27;s hind legs to allow him in the game.

Motaro placed 31st in UGO&#x27;s 2012 ranking of the top fifty &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; characters, noting him being a tough sub-boss to defeat. Den of Geek ranked Motaro 42nd in their 2015 rating of the franchise&#x27;s then-64 playable characters. Marcus Stewart of &quot;Game Informer&quot; rated Motaro 57th in his 2021 ranking of the 76 playable series characters. &quot;You&#x27;d think a centaur would be a cooler character, but Motaro hasn&#x27;t made a ton of noise since his &#x27;90s heyday.&quot; The bipedal version of Motaro was criticized by Robert Naytor of Hardcore Gaming 101 and ScrewAttack, with the former considering his four legs &quot;the one cool thing he had going for him&quot; and the latter stating that he had lost his most defining trait.

===Nightwolf===
===Rain===
: Portrayed by: John Turk (&quot;MKT&quot;); Tyrone Wiggins (&quot;Annihilation&quot;); Percy Brown (&quot;Conquest&quot;)
: Voiced by: Rino Romano (&quot;Defenders of the Realm&quot;); Andrew Bowen (&quot;MKX&quot;); Dempsey Pappion (&quot;MK11&quot;); Noshir Dalal (&quot;MK1&quot;)

First appearing as a non-player character (NPC) in &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot;″s attract mode before becoming a playable character in the home version of &quot;UMK3&quot; and the compilation title &quot;Mortal Kombat Trilogy&quot; (1996), Rain is an Edenian prince who had been smuggled from his homeland amidst Outworld emperor Shao Kahn&#x27;s takeover. Millennia later, the former resurfaces during Shao&#x27;s invasion of Earthrealm to join him. Following a minor appearance in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot;″s (2004) training mode, Rain returns in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot; (2006), in which he learns from Outworld sorcerer Quan Chi that he is a direct descendant of Argus, Edenia&#x27;s protector god and half-sibling of Taven and Daegon, both of whom were favored by their father to assume his mantle as Edenia&#x27;s protector. He later confronts the former, only to be defeated.

Returning as a downloadable playable character in &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (2011), Raiden alters the timeline to avert the events of &quot;Armageddon&quot;. Due to this, Rain is stated to have been orphaned at a young age during Shao Kahn&#x27;s invasion of Edenia and raised by Edenian resistance fighters. Growing up, he developed a reputation as an exceptional yet arrogant warrior before betraying his comrades after being refused leadership of the resistance. This caught Shao&#x27;s attention, who offered Rain a place in his army in exchange for his services. Appearing as an NPC in &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; (2015), Rain served as advisor to Shao&#x27;s successor Mileena before she was overthrown by Kotal Kahn. In the present, Rain attempts to help Mileena reassume the throne, but is thwarted by D&#x27;Vorah. Following this, Rain returns as a downloadable playable character once more in &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;. In his ending, he discovers his father Argus betrayed his birth mother Amara by faking his death, leading to her committing suicide while Rain was sold to another family. Swearing vengeance, he leaves his stepmother Delia to suffer a similar fate as Amara.

Rain appears as a playable character in &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;. While creating a second new timeline, Fire God Liu Kang removed Rain&#x27;s divinity and made him Zeffeero, an ambitious sorcerer who went on to become High Mage of Outworld&#x27;s royal court. After aiding in Quan Chi, Shang Tsung, and General Shao&#x27;s failed attempt to conquer Outworld and Earthrealm, Rain goes into hiding and allies himself with Havik, who has him destroy Orderrealm&#x27;s capital, Seido. Wracked with guilt over what he did, Rain subsequently turns himself in to Empress Mileena. Additionally, an alternate timeline variant of Rain who became emperor of Outworld and married Tanya appears in the &quot;Khaos Reigns&quot; DLC.

Rain was inspired by the 1984 Prince song &quot;Purple Rain&quot;, along with &quot;MK&quot; co-creator Ed Boon, a longtime fan of the musician, also jokingly wondering what color palette had not yet been used for the series&#x27; ninja characters at the time &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot; was in production. After &quot;MK Trilogy&quot;, the character was given his own distinct designs in future appearances.

Rain has received mixed to negative critical reception for his origins and his Fatalities. UGO ranked him 28th out of the series&#x27; top 50 characters in 2012. His later appearances were better received; &quot;Den of Geek&quot; ranked Rain 36th in his 2015 rating of the 64 series characters due to his &quot;MK9&quot; ending and the expansion of his backstory in &quot;Armageddon&quot; as &quot;a power-hungry jerk who believed that he was owed everything.&quot; &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; noted his purple palette in the 2011 reboot as &quot;a nice, rarely used color for male fighting game characters&quot;, while &quot;his moves are so weird and confounding that they make every match a constant guessing game.&quot; &quot;Bleeding Cool&quot; considered Rain&#x27;s &quot;MK11&quot; appearance as his best to date due to his evolved moveset.

===Sektor===
:Portrayed by: Sal Divita (&quot;MK3&quot;, &quot;UMK3&quot;); Peter Shinkoda (&quot;Legacy&quot;)
:Voiced by: Andrew Kishino (2011 game); Dave B. Mitchell (&quot;MK11&quot;, &quot;Battle of the Realms&quot;); Erika Ishii (MK1) 

Sektor is an assassin and member of the Lin Kuei clan who agreed to became a cyborg. First appearing in &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot;, he and fellow cyborg Cyrax are tasked with finding and killing former member Kuai Liang. Returning as a hidden character in &quot;Mortal Kombat Gold&quot;, Sektor comes to view the Lin Kuei&#x27;s grandmaster as inferior and kills him, but is defeated by Kuai Liang before he can claim the title and flees to Japan to form his own clan of cyborg ninjas. Following this, Sektor makes a minor appearance in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot;.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (2011), after Raiden alters the timeline to avert the events of &quot;Armageddon&quot;, Sektor initially appears as a human Chinese member of the Lin Kuei who fervently supports the impending Cyber Lin Kuei initiative. After becoming a cyborg, he captures Kuai Liang to convert him as well before aligning himself with Outworld emperor Shao Kahn and assisting in his invasion of Earthrealm, only to be defeated by Nightwolf. As of &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot;, Sektor was killed. While studying his memories, Kuai Liang discovers the former contributed to the Shirai Ryu clan&#x27;s destruction and the feud between Kuai Liang and Hanzo Hasashi. Furthermore, the downloadable playable character Triborg sports a variation based on Sektor.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;, a time-displaced Sektor was recruited by Kronika to help bolster her forces. To fulfill this task, he kidnapped several Lin Kuei clansmen and forcibly converted them into cyborgs until Kuai Liang, Hasashi, and Cyrax destroy his factory. Nonetheless, Kronika&#x27;s forces recover Sektor&#x27;s body and use him to complete the cyborg army before sacrificing them to destroy the Special Forces&#x27; base.

Two incarnations of Sektor appear in &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;, with the original appearing as an assist character, or &quot;Kameo Fighter&quot;, while a female incarnation appears as a downloadable playable character via the &quot;Khaos Reigns&quot; DLC. After Fire God Liu Kang creates another new timeline while stopping Kronika, Sektor was rewritten to become the daughter of the Lin Kuei&#x27;s master armorer, Longwei, and one of its leading warriors, Madam Bo. Growing up, Sektor would go on to become Longwei&#x27;s apprentice, later successor, in addition to being a warrior. In the present, Sektor advises the Lin Kuei&#x27;s grandmaster, Bi-Han, to bolster their forces with machinery. This would lead to her developing two powered suits for the clan&#x27;s use and becoming one of his most trusted advisors and lover. In the &quot;Khaos Reigns&quot; DLC, she joins the Lin Kuei in ambushing the Shirai Ryu to test the suits, only to be captured. When Titan Havik&#x27;s forces attack their timeline, capture Bi-Han, and convert him into Noob Saibot, Sektor reluctantly joins forces with Scorpion and Cyrax to rescue him. Once Havik is defeated, Bi-Han is captured by Liu Kang, who allows Sektor to leave and become the Lin Kuei&#x27;s acting grandmaster while he works to cure Bi-Han. In her ending, Sektor rescues Bi-Han and vows revenge on Liu Kang, believing he had no intention of curing the former.

The original Sektor appears in the &quot;Mortal Kombat: Legacy&quot; episode &quot;Cyrax &amp; Sektor&quot;, played by Peter Shinkoda; plays a minor role in DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Mortal Kombat X: Blood Ties&quot; comic miniseries; and appears in &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Battle of the Realms&quot; (2021).

Sektor was nicknamed &quot;Ketchup&quot; during production of &quot;MK3&quot; before his official name was determined, while the robot ninjas&#x27; designs were inspired by Boba Fett and the Predator. He has been lauded by gaming media outlets for his Fatalities over the course of the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series. UGO placed him 26th in their 2012 list of their top fifty series characters.

===Sheeva===
:Portrayed by: Marjean Holden (&quot;Annihilation&quot;)
:Voiced by: Dawnn Lewis (&quot;Defenders of the Realm&quot;); Lori McClain (&quot;Armageddon&quot;); Lani Minella (2011 game); Vanessa Marshall (&quot;MK11&quot;)

Sheeva is a Shokan warrior like Goro and Kintaro, and is the series&#x27; lone female representative of the four-armed race. She has a long-standing rivalry with Motaro, as the Shokan and his race of Centaurians are bitter enemies. She debuts in &quot;MK3&quot; as Queen Sindel&#x27;s appointed bodyguard and protector following Shao Kahn&#x27;s invasion of Earth. She is not playable in the series again until &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot;, in which the then-entire series roster is playable. In the 2011 reboot that retells the continuity of the first three games, she is immediately playable and plays a minor role in the game&#x27;s story mode as Kahn&#x27;s bodyguard and jailer. In &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;, Sheeva was a late addition to the roster as downloadable content as part of the game&#x27;s &quot;Aftermath&quot; expansion pack. She additionally has a more significant role in the series for the first time, as she aids a time-traveling Shang Tsung in retrieving Kronika&#x27;s Crown of Souls so Liu Kang can restore history after exploiting her blood oath to Sindel. Sheeva assists in reviving Sindel so she can join them as well, but upon learning of her treachery Sheeva attempts to stop her but is defeated.

The character&#x27;s name was derived from Shiva, the Hindu deity of destruction. She was added to the game due to fan requests for a playable version of Goro, like whom she was created as a stop motion-animated clay figurine. Series co-creator John Tobias opted for a female version of the character as she would be physically smaller in size and thus take up less room on the screen. She was omitted from the home versions of &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot; due to memory constraints.

Sheeva (voiced by Dawnn Lewis) had a recurring role in the 1996 animated series &quot;Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm&quot;. In the 1997 film &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot;, she was played by Marjean Holden in a minor role with her only action sequence being a brief scuffle with Motaro, though the film acknowledges her then-current role in the games as Sindel&#x27;s personal protector. In the 2015 &quot;Mortal Kombat X: Blood Ties&quot; prequel comic miniseries produced by DC Comics, Sheeva is crowned by Kintaro as the current leader of the Shokan in a peaceful treaty with Kotal Kahn, following the death of previous rule King Gorbak. Sheeva mourns Kintaro&#x27;s death after Sonya — possessed by Havik — kills him in battle.

Reception of the character has been mixed. While Wirtualna Polska featured Sheeva among gaming&#x27;s top ten female villains in 2011, she placed a middling 28th in UGO.com&#x27;s 2012 ranking of their top fifty &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; characters, and 47th in Den of Geek&#x27;s 2019 ranking of the series&#x27; 77 playable characters. &quot;Game Informer&quot;, in 2010, stated that &quot;despite a somewhat cool ground-pound move [in &quot;MK3&quot;], she was an addition to the series that never really served a purpose or did anything particularly noteworthy.&quot; However, her Fatalities over the course of her appearances have been fairly well received.

===Sindel===
:Portrayed by: Lia Montelongo (&quot;MK3&quot;); Musetta Vander (&quot;Annihilation&quot;); Beatrice Ilg (&quot;Legacy&quot;); Ana Thu Nguyen (&quot;Mortal Kombat 2&quot;)
:Voiced by: Laura Boton (&quot;MK:D&quot;); Lani Minella (&quot;MK&quot; 2011); Kelly Hu (&quot;MKX&quot;); Mara Junot (2019–present)

Sindel debuts as a playable character in &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; (&quot;MK3&quot;) as the queen of Edenia alongside her daughter, Princess Kitana, before their kingdom lost ten consecutive Mortal Kombat tournaments, leading to Shao Kahn invading them to forcibly merge their realms. After he killed her husband King Jerrod and adopted the then-infant Kitana, Sindel committed suicide to avoid becoming his consort. Years later however, Shao and Shang Tsung resurrect her without her memories and brainwash her to assist in the former&#x27;s invasion of Earthrealm. After Earthrealm&#x27;s defenders defeat Shao, Kitana convinces Sindel of her true past, turning her against Shao.

Sindel appears as a non-playable character (NPC) in &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; (&quot;MK4&quot;), in which her subject Tanya betrays Edenia and allows Shinnok&#x27;s Netherrealm forces to invade her palace. Kitana escapes, but Sindel is imprisoned in her dungeon until Shinnok&#x27;s forces are defeated. Following this, she sends Kitana to form an alliance with the Shokan armies and lead them into battle against a weakened Shao while Sindel stays behind to restore Edenia. Returning as a playable character in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot; (&quot;MK:D&quot;), Edenia is invaded by Onaga, who killed, resurrected, and brainwashed Sindel, among others, before imprisoning her until she is freed by Jade. Sindel appears as a playable character in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot;, though she does not play a role in the story mode.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (2011), due to Raiden altering the timeline and changing the events of the franchise&#x27;s first three games, Sindel is instead resurrected by Quan Chi and receives Shang Tsung&#x27;s powers before she kills most of Earthrealm&#x27;s warriors and Kitana before Nightwolf sacrifices himself to kill her. Quan Chi subsequently converts the dead warriors into his undead revenant servants, a role Sindel fulfills while making a minor appearance as a NPC in &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot;.

Sindel appears as a downloadable playable character in &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; (&quot;MK11&quot;) via the &quot;Aftermath&quot; expansion pack, in which her history is retconned. When Shao invaded Edenia, she willingly sided and married him, killed Jerrod herself for his perceived weakness, and claimed Shao did so to appease her subjects. Quan Chi, believing she was distracting Shao, later killed her and staged it as a suicide before using her soul to temporarily stop Shao from invading Earthrealm. In the present, Shang Tsung captures her revenant and revives her to help him steal Kronika&#x27;s Crown of Souls. Sindel agrees while also reconsolidating her power with Shao before betraying and defeating Kitana and Earthrealm&#x27;s forces. After helping Shang Tsung breach Kronika&#x27;s keep however, the sorcerer in turn betrays Sindel and Shao, absorbing their souls in retaliation for killing him to empower Sindel.

Sindel appears as a playable character in &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;. After Fire God Liu Kang created a second new timeline while stopping Kronika, Sindel is rewritten to become the firm yet fair empress of Outworld and biological mother of Kitana and Mileena, the latter of whom is set to inherit her throne, who maintains the Mortal Kombat tournaments alongside Liu Kang in the late Jerrod&#x27;s memory. Though she is a just ruler, Sindel is strict in preparing Mileena to succeed her and becomes more determined to protect her realm and the throne following Jerrod&#x27;s death. She also employs Shang Tsung to help with Mileena&#x27;s Tarkat disease, unaware that he and General Shao are conspiring against her and encouraging her to turn against Earthrealm until they are exposed by Liu Kang and Earthrealm&#x27;s warriors. Sindel is later reunited with Jerrod after Quan Chi uses his soul, among others, to create Ermac and the former gains control of the body, before she is killed by her counterpart from Titan Shang Tsung&#x27;s timeline. Before she dies, she entrusts Mileena with Outworld&#x27;s throne before Jerrod preserves her soul within Ermac, where the pair work together to fight off the other souls and maintain control of the body.

During production of &quot;MK3&quot;, Sindel was nicknamed &quot;The Bride&quot; and &quot;Muchacha&quot; by the developers before her official name was determined. She was played by actress Lia Montelongo, who was nineteen years old at the time.

Sindel appears as a supporting character in &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot;, portrayed by Musetta Vander. In addition to her original trilogy backstory and role, she is also named the new general of Shao Kahn&#x27;s extermination squads following her resurrection and brainwashing. Amidst Earthrealm&#x27;s warriors&#x27; final battle with Shao, Kitana defeats and spares Sindel. After Liu Kang defeats Shao, the latter&#x27;s curse on Sindel is broken. She also appears in the &quot;Mortal Kombat Legacy&quot; episode &quot;Kitana and Mileena - Part 1&quot;, portrayed by Beatrice Ilg, and will appear in the upcoming &quot;Mortal Kombat 2&quot;, portrayed by Ana Thu Nguyen.

Sindel has been positively received for her role in the games and her Fatalities, but her &quot;MK11&quot; retcon was met with heavy fan criticism, while her portrayal in &quot;Annihilation&quot; has been ridiculed.

===Stryker===
:Portrayed by: Michael O&#x27;Brien (&quot;MK3&quot;); Lawrence Kern (&quot;MK 2011&quot;); Tahmoh Penikett (&quot;Legacy&quot;); Eric Jacobus (&quot;Legacy II&quot;)
: Voiced by: Ron Perlman (&quot;Defenders of the Realm&quot;); Matthew Mercer (&quot;MK 2011&quot;, &quot;Battle of the Realms&quot;)
Kurtis Stryker is a coast NYPD riot control officer selected by Raiden to help defend Earthrealm against invading forces from Outworld. One of the franchise&#x27;s few characters who does not possess any special powers, he employs modern weaponry such as explosives, firearms, tasers and nightsticks for his special moves and Fatalities. During the events of &quot;MK3&quot;, he was the leader of the riot control brigade when Outworld&#x27;s portal opened over New York City. Stryker attempted to keep order among the populace in the ensuing chaos, but soon all human souls were usurped by Shao Kahn with the exception of those that belonged to Raiden&#x27;s chosen warriors, including himself. Initially ignorant of why he was spared, he entered the fray with the intention of avenging the lives of the innocent that he had vowed to protect and serve. Along with the other warriors, he assisted in liberating Earthrealm from Shao Kahn&#x27;s clutches. His next playable appearance is in &quot;MK Armageddon&quot;, in which he is still oblivious as to why he was chosen by the Elder Gods. In the Battle of Armageddon, he fights Mileena, Kabal and Kano, yet he is ultimately slain along with the other combatants. In the 2011 series reboot, Stryker is Kabal&#x27;s SWAT team leader who joins Raiden and his followers in repelling the Outworld invasion. He is later killed, along with most of the Earthrealm heroes, by Sindel and subsequently resurrected by Quan Chi and forced to fight Raiden, in a losing effort. He makes brief nonplayable appearances in &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; as an undead revenant fighting for Quan Chi and Shinnok.

A character named &quot;Kurtis Stryker&quot; was originally slated to appear in the first &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, but the idea was dropped in place of a female fighter (Sonya Blade). The character would appear in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; renamed Jax, and Stryker was finally made an original character in &quot;MK3&quot;. Stryker was originally conceived by the developers as a SWAT-type character with several additional weapons, but the game&#x27;s memory limitations prevented this. He appeared in &quot;Armageddon&quot; with a complete redesign into a much more futuristic-looking character, armed with two back-mounted knives that were never used.

Stryker has made several appearances in alternate series media, starting as a featured character (voiced by Ron Perlman) in the 1996 animated series &quot;Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm.&quot; He appeared in the premiere episode of the 2011 first season of the web series &quot;Mortal Kombat: Legacy&quot; as a SWAT leader under Jax&#x27;s command, and had a recurring role in the 2013 second season. In the 2021 animated film &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Battle of the Realms&quot;, he represents Earthrealm in the tournament, defeating Baraka in battle but losing to Shang Tsung, after which he is magically manipulated into killing himself by the sorcerer.

The character has received negative reception for his &quot;common man&quot; presence in the otherworldly atmosphere of the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series. However, Den of Geek ranked Stryker 21st in their 2015 rating of the franchise&#x27;s 64 playable characters, citing his sucker-punching of Mileena in &quot;Armageddon&#x27;s&quot; opening cinematic sequence and Perlman&#x27;s portrayal in the animated series, in addition to &quot;really [becoming] something worth caring about in the reboot, where he came off as a likeable, disgruntled smart-ass.&quot; Robert Naytor of Hardcore Gaming 101 praised Stryker in the reboot as being &quot;so badass&quot; and &quot;the closest thing you&#x27;ll get to being John McClane in a fighting game.&quot;

==Introduced in &quot;Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero&quot;==
===Fujin===
: Portrayed by: Anthony Marquez (&quot;MKM:SZ&quot;); Nic Toussaint (&quot;MKX&quot;)
: Voiced by: Herman Sanchez (&quot;MK4&quot;), David Horachek (&quot;MK:A&quot;), Troy Baker (&quot;MKX&quot;), Matthew Yang King (&quot;MK11&quot;)
Fujin is the god of wind based on the Japanese deity of the same name. He first appears as an unnamed boss in &quot;Mythologies: Sub-Zero&quot;, in which he unsuccessfully guards Shinnok&#x27;s amulet from Sub-Zero. He makes his playable debut in &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; and succeeds Raiden as Earthrealm&#x27;s protector when Raiden becomes an Elder God. Fujin returns in &quot;Armageddon&quot; and is defeated by Taven after attempting to prevent him from continuing his quest. In the rebooted timeline, Fujin appears in &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot;″s story mode fighting the Netherrealm&#x27;s forces alongside Raiden, but is not playable until his inclusion in the &quot;Aftermath&quot; expansion for &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;, in which he, Shang Tsung, and Nightwolf try to save their universe by obtaining Kronika&#x27;s crown. Fujin is ultimately betrayed by Shang Tsung, who drains his soul, but keeps him alive to continue draining his powers for eternity. In Shang Tsung&#x27;s ending, Fujin and Raiden become his servants.

Fujin placed 40th in UGO&#x27;s 2012 listing of the top 50 series characters. In 2014, Prima Games included Fujin among their twenty &quot;cheapest&quot; characters in the series due to having a crossbow as his primary weapon in &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot;. For his later appearances, the crossbow could only be used for special attacks.

===Quan Chi===
: Portrayed by: Richard Divizio (&quot;MKM:SZ&quot;, &quot;MK4&quot;); Carlos Pesina (&quot;MK:D&quot;, &quot;MK:A&quot;); Adoni Maropis (&quot;Conquest&quot;); Michael Rogers (&quot;Legacy&quot;); Damon Herriman (&quot;MK 2021&quot; sequel)
: Voiced by: Herman Sanchez (&quot;MK4, MK:A&quot;); Nigel Casey (&quot;MK:D&quot;); Ronald M. Banks (&quot;MK vs DC&quot;,&quot;2011 game&quot;, &quot;MKX&quot;); Nick Chinlund (&quot;Defenders of the Realm&quot;); Darin De Paul (&quot;Scorpion&#x27;s Revenge&quot;); Sean T. Krishnan (&quot;MK1&quot;)

Quan Chi is a nefarious free-roaming sorcerer who is one of the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series&#x27; main villains. He is first seen in &quot;MK Mythologies&quot; when he hires both Sub-Zero and his rival Scorpion to find a map leading to the amulet in hopes that they would meet in combat; indeed, Sub-Zero kills Scorpion in battle, after which Quan Chi eliminates Scorpion&#x27;s Shirai Ryu clan and sends Sub-Zero to find the amulet, which is later revealed to be a fake while Quan Chi kept the real one for himself. After reviving Scorpion as an undead revenant, Quan Chi tells him that Sub-Zero was responsible for the deaths of his clan and family. He makes his playable debut in &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot;, in which he joins forces with disgraced Elder God Shinnok, who had been banished to the Netherealm by the thunder god Raiden after centuries of warring, in ruling the realm. He is the title character along with Shang Tsung in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance&quot; (2002), in which he brokers a deal with Shang Tsung for his assistance in reviving the army of Onaga (the game&#x27;s final boss) in exchange for souls that would preserve Shang Tsung&#x27;s youth, then eliminate evil Outworld emperor Shao Kahn and the perennial Mortal Kombat champion Liu Kang. They kill Raiden&#x27;s Earthrealm defenders, but the partnership dissolves when Shang Tsung attempts to steal Shinnok&#x27;s amulet to take control of Onaga&#x27;s army for himself. In his futile attempt to stop Onaga, Raiden sacrifices himself by triggering a violent explosion and seemingly killing the Deadly Alliance as well. In &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot; (2006), Quan Chi attempts to acquire the godlike power of the elemental Blaze. During the battle royal among the combatants on the Pyramid of Argus in the game&#x27;s opening cinematic sequence, Quan Chi wounds Kenshi in battle before Shang Tsung (disguised as Ermac) throws him off the pyramid. In the game&#x27;s training mode, Quan Chi suggests that he, Shang Tsung, Shao Kahn, and Onaga work together to defeat the forces of good, but is secretly serving as a double agent for Shinnok.

Quan Chi was the lone playable character from the three-dimensional series of games included in the immediate roster of the 2011 &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; reboot. In the game&#x27;s story mode, Quan Chi is present at the Shaolin Tournament from the outset, with the resurrected Scorpion serving as his personal assassin. They join forces in the tournament to face the Shaolin monk Liu Kang, but both are defeated. During the second tournament in Shao Kahn&#x27;s Outworld arena, Quan Chi and Shang Tsung join forces against Kung Lao but are defeated. In the retold events of &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; therein, Quan Chi revives the deceased Queen Sindel in order to enable Shao Kahn to invade Earthrealm, after having resurrected the dead elder Sub-Zero — killed by Scorpion in the first tournament — as Noob Saibot to assist him in his plans. He later constructs a Soulnado to take every soul on Earth, but his plans are thwarted by Nightwolf. After Sindel massacres the Earthrealm warriors assembled to stop Shao Kahn&#x27;s takeover, Raiden seeks cooperation between Earth and the Netherealm by offering Quan Chi their souls as compensation, but Quan Chi has transformed them into his revenant slaves. However, he inadvertently causes Shao Kahn&#x27;s downfall when he reveals the Elder Gods are obligated to stop the tyrant for failing to honor Mortal Kombat&#x27;s rules. Raiden kills Shao Kahn and halts his invasion, but Quan Chi makes preparations for Shinnok&#x27;s invasion, leading Netherrealm&#x27;s forces in attacking the weakened Earthrealm and Outworld. In &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; (2015), Quan Chi uses the Earthrealm revenants to aid him in retrieving Shinnok&#x27;s amulet over the course of two years. Though he succeeds in doing so with the aid of D&#x27;Vorah, he is decapitated by the resurrected Hanzo Hasashi (Scorpion) once he learns the sorcerer conspired with the Lin Kuei ninja Sektor to kill the Shirai Ryu.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;, Quan Chi appears as a DLC character, but makes frequent appearances in the story. In Liu Kang&#x27;s new timeline, Quan Chi led a meaningless life in the mines before being contacted by &quot;Damashi&quot;, who helps him learn his sorcerer abilities. He begins working with Shang Tsung and General Shao to deceive Empress Sindel into turning against Earthrealm and preparing a coup to overthrow her. While creating Ermac, Quan Chi attempts to prepare a soul stealer to unleash on Earthrealm before he is stopped by Ashrah. One of the souls that escapes the contraptions attacks him, resulting in his skin turning white. After discovering that Damashi is Titan Shang Tsung, who is intent on killing everyone in the timeline, Quan Chi and Shang Tsung assist Liu Kang in stopping him. During the final battle, Titan Shang Tsung summons a Titan Quan Chi to assist him, but both ultimately lose.

According to &quot;MK&quot; co-creator John Tobias, Quan Chi was created as a replacement for Shang Tsung as the main sorcerer character of the series. NetherRealm Studios character artist Solomon Gaitan initially referenced actor Yul Brynner when digitally sculpting Quan Chi&#x27;s facial features for &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot;. Gaitan said that series art director Steve Beran &quot;wanted me to merge Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff&#x27;s features&quot; during the design process, in addition to researching vultures: &quot;I wanted him to feel like he was in a permanent state of lurking and stalking; waiting for death to happen.&quot;

Quan Chi made his &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series debut in one episode of the 1996 animated series &quot;Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm&quot;, and was voiced by Nick Chinlund. The character appeared in four episodes of the 1998 television series &quot;Mortal Kombat: Conquest&quot;, and in the 2011 web series &quot;Mortal Kombat: Legacy&quot;, Quan Chi appears at the climax of a two-part episode featuring Sub-Zero and Scorpion. In the 2020 animated film &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, Quan Chi serves as one of the two main antagonists along with Shang Tsung, and resurrects Hanzo Hasashi to turn him into Scorpion and employ him as his servant for eternity. Damon Herriman will play Quan Chi in the upcoming feature film &quot;Mortal Kombat 2&quot;.

Quan Chi has received mainly positive critical reception for his role in the games, though Destructoid commented in 2015: &quot;Quan Chi is a dark sorcerer shitbag that nobody likes, both in the fandom and in the series&#x27; narrative [for] unsuccessfully scheming behind the back of whatever master he is currently serving like an incompetent, bald Starscream.&quot; However, Topless Robot cited Quan Chi in &quot;Defenders of the Realm&quot; as &quot;the only contribution to [the] franchise that this series made.&quot; Reception to his Fatalities has been divisive, with his &quot;Leg Beatdown&quot; from &quot;MK4&quot; rated among the series&#x27; best, and the &quot;Neck Stretch&quot; from &quot;Deadly Alliance&quot; among the worst, a sentiment shared by the &quot;MK&quot; series&#x27; developers.

===Sareena===
: Portrayed by: Lia Montelongo (&quot;MKM:SZ&quot;)
: Voiced by: Danielle Nicolet (&quot;MKX&quot;), Mara Junot (&quot;MK1&quot;), Jennifer Grey (&quot;Cage Match&quot;)
Sareena is a demon from the Netherrealm. She debuts in &quot;Mythologies: Sub-Zero&quot; as an assassin assigned by Quan Chi to kill Sub-Zero. After being spared by him, she assists him in defeating Quan Chi but is killed by Shinnok. Sareena returns as a playable character in the &quot;Tournament Edition&quot; port of &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance&quot;, which reveals Shinnok&#x27;s attack banished her to a lower plane of the Netherrealm. Escaping through a portal, she is offered asylum in Earthrealm by the younger Sub-Zero. However, the training mode of &quot;Armageddon&quot; sees her again serving Quan Chi, leading to her being defeated by Taven. Following a background cameo in the 2011 reboot, Sareena appears in the story mode of &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot;, in which she assists the Special Forces in battling the Netherrealm&#x27;s forces. In &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;, she appears as an assist-based Kameo fighter, where she is able to switch between a human-like appearance and her true, demonic form. She also appears in Ashrah&#x27;s Klassic Towers ending, in which Ashrah rescues her from Quan Chi&#x27;s control.

Sareena appears as one of the main antagonists of the 2023 animated film &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Cage Match&quot; voiced by Jennifer Grey. She initially appears as a fictionalized version of Grey herself that Johnny Cage attempts to find in Los Angeles to shoot &quot;Ninja Mime&quot; with, only to reveal she had been cut off from the Neatherrealm for decades and helped set up Cage&#x27;s film career with her allies from the Brotherhood of Shadows after she discovered he possessed the &quot;blood of the gods&quot; needed to open a portal to the Neatherrealm and summon Shinnok. While Cage fights Shinnok, she faces off against her former ally Ashrah and unleashes her true demonic form in the process. With help from Cage&#x27;s assistant Chuck Golden, Ashrah is able to kill and defeat her.

Sareena was ranked 26th on Den of Geek&#x27;s 2015 rating of the series&#x27; 64 playable characters, for being &quot;Sub-Zero&#x27;s one moment of humanity snowballing into something meaningful&quot;.

===Shinnok===
: Portrayed by: Gary Wingert (&quot;MKM:SZ&quot;); Carlos Pesina (&quot;MK:A&quot;); Chris Bashen (&quot;MKX&quot;); Reiner Schöne (&quot;Annihilation&quot;)
: Voiced by: John Tobias (&quot;MK4, MKG&quot;); Knute Horwitz (&quot;MK:A&quot;); Ken Lally (2011 game); Troy Baker (&quot;MKX&quot;, &quot;MK11&quot;); Robin Atkin Downes (&quot;Battle of the Realms&quot;, &quot;Cage Match&quot;)
One of the franchise&#x27;s primary villains, Shinnok debuted as the boss of &quot;MK Mythologies&quot; and made his first playable appearance in the main series with &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; in 1997. He appears in &quot;MK4&quot; as both a playable character and the final boss of &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; (2015). He is a banished former Elder God who invades and annexes the realm of Edenia with the aid of Quan Chi&#x27;s forces and the traitorous Edenian Tanya before declaring war against the Elder Gods, specifically Raiden for his punishment, but his mission fails after he is defeated by perennial Mortal Kombat champion Liu Kang. Shinnok&#x27;s next selectable appearance is along with the then-entire series roster in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot; (2006), and he features in the game&#x27;s training mode as having been a longtime friend of the game&#x27;s main protagonist Taven, who is under the impression that Shinnok is still a force of good as he rescues him from an attack by Li Mei. Shinnok also makes a brief appearance alongside the forces of evil in the battle royal in the opening cinematic sequence against the other combatants at the Pyramid of Argus, when he summons giant subterranean skeletal hands that pin Raiden to the ground before he is struck with a lightning blast.

Shinnok only appears in the closing of the story mode of the 2011 &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; reboot, but is the main villain of &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot;. At the start of the story mode, he is sealed inside his own magical amulet, which is possessed over the next twenty-five years by many other characters until Quan Chi is beheaded by Scorpion, freeing Shinnok from inside the amulet. With the aid of D&#x27;Vorah and the undead Earthrealm warriors from the previous game, Shinnok invades the Sky Temple, where he subdues Raiden and corrupts the Jinsei (the source of Earthrealm&#x27;s life force) until a Special Forces unit led by the game&#x27;s protagonist Cassie Cage arrives to battle the transformed Shinnok (now known as &quot;Corrupted Shinnok&quot;) and the revenant army. After Cassie is victorious over Shinnok, Raiden then purifies the Jinsei, which strips Shinnok of his powers. Shinnok returns in the prologue of &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; (2019), in which he is tortured and decapitated by Raiden after the events of &quot;MKX&quot;. His severed head is visited by new boss character Kronika, the Keeper of Time, who expresses sadness at his current state. The game&#x27;s story mode reveals that Shinnok is actually Kronika&#x27;s son, as well the brother of fellow Elder God Cetrion.

Shinnok&#x27;s likeness in &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; was based on that of series art director Steve Beran, and like Shang Tsung in the digitized &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; games, he was able to mimic the special moves of his opponents, but the graphical limitations of Midway&#x27;s then-new 3D software prevented him from physically transforming into the characters. Series co-creator and programmer Ed Boon admitted in turn that he felt Shinnok was not imposing enough as a final boss in &quot;MK4&quot; due to his having no special moves of his own. He was playable in &quot;MKX&quot; upon completion of the story mode.

Shinnok appears in the 1997 film &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot;, played by Reiner Schöne and depicted as the father of both Shao Kahn and Raiden. He is not identified by name onscreen until the film&#x27;s conclusion. The character appeared in the 2021 animated film &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Battle of the Realms&quot; and 2023&#x27;s &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Cage Match&quot; and was voiced by Robin Atkin Downes.

Critical reception has been mainly negative due to his perceived weak stature as a final boss in the series, though his Fatalities have been better received. &quot;Den of Geek&quot; ranked Shinnok 35th in their 2015 rating of the series&#x27; 73 playable characters, critical of how he was &quot;just a lazy Shang Tsung&quot; in &quot;MK4,&quot; while &quot;it wasn&#x27;t until &quot;Armageddon&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat 9&quot; that they were able to make him seem like an actual threat,&quot; and further adding that in &quot;MKX,&quot; he &quot;was pretty fun as a hybrid of Emperor Palpatine and Loki.&quot;

==Introduced in &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot;==

===Jarek===
:Performed by: Mark Myers (&quot;MK4&quot;)
:Voiced by: Jon Hey (&quot;MK4&quot;), James Freeman-Hargis (&quot;MK:A&quot;)
Jarek is a member of the Black Dragon clan. Established as the last known member of the Black Dragon, he possesses Kano&#x27;s special moves and Fatalities. He helps defend Earthrealm against Shinnok, but falls off a cliff in the aftermath when the Special Forces attempt to arrest him. In &quot;Armageddon&quot;, Jarek is revealed to have survived and develops an obsession with killing all of his opponents. Jarek also appears as one of the bosses in &quot;Special Forces&quot; (2000), in which he is defeated by Jax. In the &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; prequel comic, he is imprisoned in Outworld by Kotal Kahn.

The character makes an appearance in the 2022 animated film &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Snow Blind&quot;.

Modeled after Midway character artist Hernan Sanchez, Jarek received a tepid reception for his similarities to Kano. The endings featuring him in &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; have also been maligned for their voice acting and dialogue.

===Kai===
: Portrayed by: Kimball Uddin (&quot;MK4&quot;)
: Voiced by: Ed Boon (&quot;MK4&quot;)
Kai is a Shaolin Monk and member of the White Lotus Society who is one of the chosen warriors defending Earthrealm from Shinnok. Afterwards, he goes on quest for self-enlightenment, although he returns in &quot;Armageddon&quot;.

According to Ed Boon, Kai was developed as an &quot;African American character who was very nimble like Liu Kang&quot; with vertical fireball projectiles. He was also the first character to perform a handstand during gameplay, which was intended to be his main fighting style in &quot;Armageddon&quot;, but Boon stated this was prevented by time limitations.

Kai came in at 47th on UGO&#x27;s 2012 list of the top 50 &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; characters. Robert Naytor of Hardcore Gaming 101 said, &quot;With all his projectile moves, he&#x27;s basically the black Liu Kang&quot;.

===Meat===
Meat was originally a skin created by art director Tony Goskie that would depict each fighter in &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; as a bloodied corpse. After being established as a canonical character in &quot;Deception&quot;″s Konquest mode, he received a backstory and unique special moves in &quot;Armageddon&quot;. His &quot;Armageddon&quot; ending reveals that he is an experiment created by Shang Tsung who escaped the sorcerer&#x27;s clutches before he could be completed. Prima Games&#x27; strategy guide for &quot;Armageddon&quot; also states that Meat assists Shinnok, although this relationship is not established in the game.

Meat placed 49th in UGO&#x27;s 2012 listing of the top fifty &quot;MK&quot; characters, noting that he became a fan favorite for his &quot;ridiculously gruesome moves&quot;. Conversely, ScrewAttack ranked Meat fourth in its 2011 ranking of the series&#x27; ten worst characters for being &quot;a generic [character] model&quot; without flesh. Ryan Aston of Topless Robot placed Meat second in his selection of eight characters &quot;that are goofy even by &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; standards,&quot; calling him &quot;a gory riff&quot; on &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; character Charade and his storyline &quot;a truly flimsy excuse for his existence&quot;.

===Reiko===
: Portrayed by: Jim Helsinger (&quot;Conquest&quot;), Nathan Jones (2021 film)
: Voiced by: Ed Boon (&quot;MK:D&quot;), David Beron (&quot;MK:A&quot;), Robin Atkin Downes (&quot;Battle of the Realms&quot;), Derek Phillips (&quot;MK1&quot;)
Reiko is a general who has served Shinnok and Shao Kahn. He first appears assisting Shinnok&#x27;s invasion in &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot;, while &quot;Armageddon&quot; depicts him under Shao Kahn&#x27;s command. After making a background cameo in the 2011 reboot, he appears in the &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; prequel comics, in which he becomes a blood god before being betrayed and killed by Havik.

The character was added to &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; to replace Noob Saibot after the developers found the game had too many ninja characters. While his original ending simply depicted him walking through a portal, Reiko&#x27;s FMV ending showed him wearing the helmet of Shao Kahn. This led to speculation that Reiko was Shao Kahn, which was dispelled when the Konquest mode of &quot;Deception&quot; revealed that Reiko would sneak into Shao Kahn&#x27;s throne room to wear his helmet. In an interview, John Tobias stated Reiko was intended to be a reincarnation of Shao Kahn, but this story would be disregarded in later installments. Nevertheless, Reiko&#x27;s appearance and special moves in &quot;Armageddon&quot; would be stylized after Shao Kahn.

Reiko was played by Jim Helsinger in the 1998 television series &quot;Mortal Kombat: Conquest&quot;, where he is one of Shao Kahn&#x27;s generals. Reiko also appeared in the 2021 &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; film, portrayed by Nathan Jones, as one of the Outworld champions. In the 2021 animated film &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Battle of the Realms&quot;, he is voiced by Robin Atkin Downes. In the 2023 game &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;, he is voiced by Derek Phillips.

Reiko placed 42nd on UGO&#x27;s 2012 list of the top 50 &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; characters. Gavin Jasper of Den of Geek rated Reiko last in his 2015 ranking of the series&#x27; playable characters for what he considered the wasted potential of his storyline in regards to his connection to Shao Kahn. WhatCulture ranked him fourteenth in their 2015 selection of the series&#x27; twenty worst characters for &quot;having zero individuality&quot;.

===Tanya===
: Performed by: Lia Montelongo (&quot;MK4&quot;)
: Voiced by: Rosalind Dugas (&quot;MK4&quot;), Beth Melewski (&quot;MK:D&quot;), Jennifer Hale (&quot;MKX&quot;), Cherise Boothe (&quot;MK1&quot;)
Tanya is an Edenian who often acts out of self-preservation. During &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; (&quot;MK4&quot;) and &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot;, she betrayed Edenia to join Shinnok and Onaga respectively. In &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; (&quot;MKX&quot;), she joins Mileena&#x27;s rebellion against Kotal Kahn with the intention of liberating Edenia from Outworld, only to be defeated by D&#x27;Vorah and spared at Cassie Cage&#x27;s behest. In Mileena&#x27;s ending in &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; (&quot;MK11&quot;), she and Tanya are revealed to be lovers.

In the new timeline depicted in &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot; (&quot;MK1&quot;), Tanya is the leader of the Umgadi, a group of warrior priestesses that guard Outworld&#x27;s royal family, having become one of its most trusted members after Emperor Jerrod was murdered on her predecessor Li Mei&#x27;s watch and she quit in disgrace. Additionally, Tanya is Princess Mileena&#x27;s girlfriend despite the Umgadi&#x27;s rules forbidding relationships. After Jerrod is restored through Ermac and reveals Li Mei was not responsible for his death, Tanya investigates the incident and discovers the Umgadi&#x27;s Matron Superiors were the true culprits and framed Li Mei. The newly crowned Empress Mileena subsequently puts Tanya in charge of reforming the Umgadi.

Named after Ed Boon&#x27;s sister Tania, Tanya was created to replace Kitana in &quot;MK4&quot;. She placed 34th on UGO&#x27;s 2012 list of the top 50 &quot;MK&quot; characters. &quot;Complex&quot; named Tanya seventh in their 2011 selection of the top ten underrated &quot;MK&quot; characters, calling her &quot;the traitor of all traitors in the series, switching her allegiance more times than we can count&quot;. Conversely, Den of Geek rated her 68th in their 2015 ranking of the franchise&#x27;s 73 player characters for being &quot;a one-dimensional villain whose only quality is betrayal&quot;.

==Introduced in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Special Forces&quot;==
===Tremor===
: Voiced by: Fred Tatasciore (&quot;MKX&quot;), Imari Williams (&quot;Snow Blind&quot;)
Tremor is a ninja member of the Black Dragon clan. As implied by his name, he is able to manipulate the Earth with his immense strength. He is initially depicted as a brown-clad ninja, but would be redesigned to have a body made out of rocks. Originally intended as a playable character for &quot;Mortal Kombat Trilogy&quot;, Tremor instead debuted as a boss in &quot;Special Forces&quot;, in which he is defeated by Jax. He made his playable debut as a downloadable character in &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot;, although he has no involvement in the story. In the &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; prequel comic, it is revealed Tremor was imprisoned in Outworld by Kotal Kahn.

==Introduced in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance&quot;==

===Blaze===
: Voiced by: Simeon Norfleet (&quot;MK:A&quot;)
Blaze is a fire elemental created to monitor the warriors of the realms. He appears as a hidden character who is forced to protect the last known dragon egg by Onaga&#x27;s followers. After the egg hatches, completing Onaga&#x27;s resurrection, Blaze is able to continue monitoring the warriors and discovers they have become too powerful for the realms in his absence. He serves as the final boss of &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot;, in which he brings all the fighters together for a final battle. As part of his mission to prevent an impending Armageddon, Blaze has Taven face him in a fight intended to either kill all the warriors or strip them of their powers. The story mode of the 2011 reboot reveals Blaze was instead defeated by Shao Kahn, prompting Raiden&#x27;s efforts to change the timeline.

Prior to becoming to becoming a playable character, Blaze originated in the background of &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;″s Pit II stage as a Liu Kang palette swap covered in flames and facing off against another Liu Kang palette swap. The character was nicknamed &quot;Torch&quot; by fans, but due to the risk of copyright infringement on the Marvel character Human Torch, Midway officially named him Blaze. In reference to his original role, he has made cameo appearances in &quot;Shaolin Monks&quot;, the 2011 reboot, &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot;, and &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;.

The character placed 37th on UGO&#x27;s 2012 list of the top 50 &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; characters, which remarked, &quot;Although [guarding the Dragon Egg] doesn&#x27;t sound like the job of a badass, you&#x27;ll change your mind once you see Blaze steamrolling his way towards you&quot;.

===Bo&#x27; Rai Cho===
: Voiced by: Carlos Pesina (&quot;MK:DA&quot;, &quot;MK:D&quot;, &quot;MK:A&quot;); Steve Blum (&quot;MKX&quot;)
Bo&#x27; Rai Cho is a martial arts master skilled in the style of drunken boxing. His attacks mostly center around his weight and bodily functions. An Outworld native, but an opponent of Shao Kahn&#x27;s tyranny, he trained Liu Kang and many other Earthrealm warriors for the Mortal Kombat tournament as his participation would be on the behalf of Shao Kahn. Bo&#x27; Rai Cho trains Kung Lao after he learns of Liu Kang&#x27;s death, and in &quot;Deception&quot;, he rescues Li Mei from having her soul trapped inside one of the corpses of Onaga&#x27;s army. Bo&#x27; Rai Cho is later tricked by Mileena, posing as Kitana, into leading Kitana&#x27;s army to certain defeat against Baraka&#x27;s forces, but Bo&#x27; Rai Cho emerges victorious with the help of Liu Kang. He returns in &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot;, in which he is attacked by Shinnok.

The character&#x27;s name is a play on &quot;borracho&quot;, the Spanish word for &quot;drunk&quot;. According to Herman Sanchez, Bo&#x27; Rai Cho was created because Ed Boon sought to have a &quot;slob&quot; fighter, while John Vogel found that he filled the &quot;master&quot; role for the franchise.

Reception to Bo&#x27; Rai Cho has been generally negative for his appearance and gross-out nature. Den of Geek ranked him 55th in their rating of the series&#x27; 73 characters, calling Bo&#x27; Rai Cho &quot;a Shaw Brothers , and the gag wears thin after the third time you use his puke attack&quot;. Robert Naytor of Hardcore Gaming 101 unfavorably compared him to &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; character Shun Di as &quot;a big, fat guy&quot; who is utilized to &quot;throw up and fart a lot&quot;. ScrewAttack rated him tenth in their 2011 list of the series&#x27; 10 worst characters, noting that his in-game weapon was plain wooden staff. The character was listed as the eighth-worst &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; character by Mitchell Saltzman of IGN, who opined, &quot;Bo&#x27; Rai Cho feels like a mess of ideas all sloppily thrown together to create a character of contradictions.&quot; However, Bo&#x27; Rai Cho placed 37th on UGO&#x27;s 2012 list of the top 50 &quot;MK&quot; characters, which called his comic relief role &quot;a breath of fresh air. Or, in his case, a belch of fresh air&quot;. &quot;Complex&quot; named him one of the series&#x27; most underrated characters in 2011.

===Drahmin===
: Voiced by: Rich Carle (&quot;MK:D&quot;)
Drahmin is a demonic Oni who resides in the Netherrealm. He and Moloch are hired by Quan Chi to protect him against Scorpion in exchange for freedom from the Netherrealm, but after Quan Chi betrays them, they align themselves with Shang Tsung to help him counter Quan Chi&#x27;s treachery. While in Shang Tsung&#x27;s palace, Drahmin and Moloch encounter Scorpion, who they defeat by throwing into the palace&#x27;s Soulnado. Drahmin returns in the &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; prequel comic, in which he is killed by Quan Chi.

Ed Boon described Drahmin as one of the most difficult characters to program because specific code had to be written to prevent Drahmin&#x27;s arm-mounted club from switching sides whenever the character turned around during gameplay. Den of Geek rated him 47th in their 2015 ranking of the 64 series characters, describing him as &quot;a collection of cool concepts that doesn&#x27;t make for much of a sum&quot; whereas &quot;Moloch does a lot more with less&quot;.

===Frost===
:Voiced by: Christine Rios (&quot;MK:A&quot;); Kelly Hu (&quot;MKX&quot;); Sara Cravens (&quot;MK11&quot;)
Frost is a Lin Kuei warrior who possesses the ability to control ice. She was trained directly by Sub-Zero due to the similarities between them and the potential he saw in her, but her skills were compounded by her arrogant nature. When Sub-Zero has her accompany him to help battle Quan Chi and Shang Tsung, Frost steals his Dragon Medallion and becomes frozen by her own powers. Frost is revealed to have survived in the &quot;Unchained&quot; port of &quot;Deception&quot;, in which Sub-Zero traps her in a block of ice after she attempts to kill him. She is freed by Taven in the Konquest mode of &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot;, but attacks him after mistaking him for Sub-Zero and is defeated. Frost returns as a playable character in &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;, which depicts her receiving cybernetic enhancements. Aligning herself with Kronika by leading the Cyber Lin Kuei against Earthrealm&#x27;s heroes, she is defeated by Raiden, who shuts down the cyborgs by deactivating her link to them. Frost returns in &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot; as a kameo fighter.

The character was the first designed by Herman Sanchez for &quot;Deadly Alliance&quot;. She was placed eighth in &quot;Complex&quot;″s selection of the series&#x27; ten most underrated characters in 2011. Den of Geek placed Frost 37th in their 2015 ranking of the series&#x27; 73 player characters, calling her addition &quot;a nice touch&quot; to Sub-Zero&#x27;s rebuilding of the Lin Kuei.

===Hsu Hao===
Hsu Hao is a member of the Red Dragon clan distinguished by his cybernetic heart. After infiltrating the Special Forces, Hsu Hao destroys their Outerworld Investigation Agency branch with a nuclear device. He is eventually found by Jax, who kills him by ripping out his cybernetic heart. Despite this, he returns in &quot;Armageddon&quot;. Hsu Hao also appears in the &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; comic prequel, in which he is killed by Scorpion.

During development, the character was called Kublai Khan after the Mongolian emperor of the same name. Steve Beran described him as &quot;the anti-Jax&quot; whose cybernetic heart was the result of experiments performed on him by the Chinese army. According to Ed Boon, Hsu Hao had a number of different iterations, with his &quot;Hand Clap&quot; special move inspired by superhero comics.

Hsu Hao is widely regarded as one of the worst characters in the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; franchise. Den of Geek&#x27;s 2015 ranking of the series&#x27; 73 characters placed him as the second-worst. Robert Naytor of Hardcore Gaming 101 described the character as &quot;a slightly racist take at a Village Person&quot;. Naming him the series&#x27; worst character in 2014, Destructoid noted that &quot;in a game that was littered with lackluster new additions, he was without a doubt the runt of that litter&quot;. This negative reception is also present in the development team, with John Vogel intending his death in &quot;Deadly Alliance&quot; to be canon and Boon making him the first character officially omitted from the &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; playable character roster. In reference to the negative reception, one of Erron Black&#x27;s pre-match introductions in &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; depicts him tossing aside Hsu Hao&#x27;s severed head. However, Hsu Hao was included in the Joker&#x27;s &quot;MK11&quot; ending, in which they join forces with Havik and Mileena in attacking Orderrealm.

===Kenshi===
===Li Mei===
:Voiced by: Lina Chern (&quot;MK:D&quot;); Tara Strong (&quot;MKX&quot;); Kelly Hu (&quot;MK1&quot;); Grey DeLisle (&quot;Battle of the Realms&quot;) 
Li Mei is an Outworld native from a small village who was forced into a tournament by Shang Tsung and Quan Chi with the promise that her victory would free her village. However, upon winning the tournament, Shang Tsung attempts to place her soul into the corpse of one of Onaga&#x27;s soldiers. In &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot;, she was saved by Bo&#x27; Rai Cho, but her contact with the corpse causes her to feel a connection with Onaga. Following a cameo appearance in &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot;, Li Mei returns as a playable character in &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;, in which she is depicted as the First Constable of Outworld&#x27;s capitol Sun Do who once served Empress Sindel and led her royal guard, the Umgadi, until Emperor Jerrod was murdered.

Reception to Li Mei has been mixed, with criticism directed towards her &quot;Deception&quot; design. Den of Geek rated her 57th in their 2015 ranking of the series&#x27; entire 73-character roster, feeling she was &quot;only distinguished by her ridiculous outfit of a bandana and underwear&quot;. Joe Pring of WhatCulture rated Li Mei sixth in his 2015 selection of the twenty worst &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; characters for &quot;[wearing] a bandana while dancing around in metal-plated underwear&quot;, which he stated &quot;deserves to be ridiculed&quot;.

===Mavado===
:Voiced by: Alex Brandon (&quot;MK:A&quot;)
Mavado is a high-ranking member of the Red Dragon clan. As his clan&#x27;s top priority is the elimination of the Black Dragon, he aligns himself with Quan Chi and Shang Tsung when they promise to hand over Kano to him for his services. He also defeats Kenshi on their behest. &quot;Deception&quot; reveals Mavado was killed by Kabal after an unsuccessful attempt on Kabal&#x27;s life, but he returns in &quot;Armageddon&quot;, continuing to serve the Red Dragon. Mavado has a minor role in the &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; comic prequel, in which he is killed by Cassie Cage.

Originally named &quot;Malvado&quot;, the Spanish word for &quot;evil&quot;, Steve Beran conceived a matador-style look for the character, but the idea was nixed due to the belief that it did not fit in with the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; universe. He is the first character in the series to use a physical object for a body-propel special attack, which he performs by shooting two bungee cords into the ground and slingshotting himself feet-first to dropkick his opponent. This attack was incorporated into his &quot;Boot Thrust&quot; Fatality.

Robert Workman of GamePlayBook ranked him eighth in his 2010 selection of the worst &quot;MK&quot; characters, describing his Fatality as &quot;stupid&quot;, but Den of Geek, placed him 39th in their 2015 ranking of the series&#x27; 73 characters &quot;for his bungee hook attacks&quot; and taking Kabal&#x27;s weapons after killing him.

===Mokap===
: Voiced by: Dusan Brown (&quot;Cage Match&quot;)

Mokap is a motion capture actor with an extensive martial arts background. He debuted as a hidden character in &quot;Deadly Alliance&quot;, but has no involvement with the story; his biography follows Johnny Cage&#x27;s non-canonical ending of a &quot;Deadly Alliance&quot; film being created. Mokap also has a limited role in the conflict of &quot;Armageddon&quot;, in which his involvement is said to be by mistake.

Named after the contraction for motion capture, Mokap is based on Midway graphic artist Carlos Pesina, who provided the motion capture work for &quot;Deadly Alliance&quot;. Pesina admitted it was &quot;pretty flattering&quot; being included in the game, but also remarked it was &quot;weird&quot; seeing Fatalities performed on him.

Mokap is featured in &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Cage Match&quot;, as an African-American man named Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Golden. In the film, Golden is depicted as Johnny Cage&#x27;s loyal assistant who idolizes him. He works with Cage to investigate Jennifer&#x27;s disappearance before the two ally themselves with Ashrah to stop Shinnok from conquering Earthrealm. After they succeed, Golden attempts to follow in Cage&#x27;s footsteps, eventually becoming his double in video games and nicknames himself &quot;Mokap.&quot;

Reception to Mokap has been mostly negative. Den of Geek rated him 55th in their 2015 ranking of the series characters, stating that he &quot;didn&#x27;t really work well as a comedy character because the game did little to differentiate the characters in terms of personality&quot;. In their ranking of the 10 worst characters, ScrewAttack placed Mokap second because &quot;nobody wants to play as a dude with balls on his body&quot;.

===Moloch===
: Voiced by: Bob Ladewig (&quot;MK:D&quot;)
Moloch is the sub-boss of &quot;Deadly Alliance&quot;. An Oni demon of immense size and strength, he and Drahmin are hired by Quan Chi to protect him against Scorpion in exchange for freedom from the Netherrealm. After Quan Chi betrays them by leaving them behind, Moloch and Drahmin align themselves with Shang Tsung to help him counter Quan Chi&#x27;s treachery. They also defeat Scorpion by throwing him into the Soulnado at Shang Tsung&#x27;s palace. Moloch also appears in the &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; prequel comic, in which Quan Chi has him killed by the revenant Kitana. In reference to his comic death, Quan Chi is seen holding Moloch&#x27;s severed head during his &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; pre-match introductions.

Designed by Allen Ditzig, Moloch&#x27;s concept changed little from his finalized design. Den of Geek rated him 21st in their 2015 ranking of the series&#x27; 64 characters, praising his sub-boss role and possessing &quot;some utter brutality that hadn&#x27;t been felt in a &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; boss since Kintaro&quot;. Bryan Dawson of Prima Games named Moloch in his 2014 selection of the &quot;cheapest&quot; &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; characters for his playable version in &quot;Armageddon&quot; having &quot;a near infinite combo limited only by the size of the stage&quot; and &quot;ridiculous reach with most of his special moves&quot;.

===Nitara===
:Portrayed by: Megan Fox (&quot;MK1&quot;, voice/model); Cristina Vee (&quot;MK1&quot;, battle grunts); Mel Jarnson (2021 film)
Nitara is a vampire from the realm of Vaeternus who seeks to destroy the orb that binds her realm to Outworld. As the orb is inside of a lava pit that Cyrax is able to enter, Nitara orchestrates a series of events to force Cyrax into helping her in exchange for passage back to Earthrealm. She ultimately succeeds in destroying the orb with Cyrax&#x27;s assistance, freeing Vaeternus. Her biography in &quot;Armageddon&quot; states that Nitara leaves Vaeternus for Edenia in an effort to prevent her species from being exterminated by Ashrah, although this is not established during the game.

In the rebooted timeline of &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;, Nitara has a minor role in the game&#x27;s story mode, in which she allies herself with Quan Chi to conquer Earthrealm in order to prevent mass starvation of her people after they overfed on Vaeternus&#x27; creatures. An alternate Nitara appears as the second boss in Invasion Mode, where she hails from a timeline conquered by Vaternians that sought to feed on other worlds. After her defeat, Liu Kang recruited another Nitara variant who used her powers for good to cure his allies infected by her evil counterpart.

The character was designed by Luis Mangubat, and a male vampire counterpart was also planned for &quot;Deadly Alliance&quot; but the developers were unable to add him to the game in time. Megan Fox, who voiced Nitara in &quot;MK1&quot;, described the character as &quot;evil but she&#x27;s also good. She&#x27;s trying to save her people. I really like her. She&#x27;s a vampire which obviously resonates for whatever reason.&quot;

Nitara was played by Mel Jarnson in the 2021 feature film &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, in which she briefly appears as one of Shang Tsung&#x27;s Outworld champions before she is killed by Kung Lao.

UGO ranked Nitara 46th on their 2012 list of the top fifty series characters. In 2011, &quot;Complex&quot; named her one of the series&#x27; most underrated characters, stating that &quot;Buffy would get her ass handed to her by this chick&quot;. However, Fox&#x27;s voicework in &quot;MK1&quot; was criticized by fans as &quot;lifeless and boring&quot;.

==Introduced in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot;==

===Ashrah===
: Voiced by: Johanna Añonuevo (&quot;MK:D&quot;, &quot;MK:A&quot;); Kelly Hu (&quot;Cage Match&quot;); Susan Eisenberg (&quot;MK1&quot;)
Ashrah is a demon from the Netherrealm who discovers a magical sword that cleanses her soul when she uses it to kill demons. As having a purified soul will allow her to escape the Netherrealm, Ashrah plots to kill Noob Saibot to complete her redemption. Her &quot;Armageddon&quot; biography reveals that after leaving the Netherrealm, she is tasked with killing the vampires in Vaeternus. Ashrah returns in &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;. While hunting down demons to cleanse her soul, she allies herself with Earthrealm&#x27;s warriors to stop Shang Tsung and Quan Chi, and is welcomed into the Earthrealm by Liu Kang. After the defeat of Titan Shang Tsung, she began studying with the Shaolin Monks before briefly returning to Outworld to rescue Sareena from Quan Chi&#x27;s control. After Liu Kang assists her in removing Quan Chi&#x27;s control over her, Sareena joins Ashrah in Earthrealm to form the Order of Light. The pre-fight intros also reveal she and Reptile began dating each other.

Ed Boon commented that the character was commonly misconceived as a female version of Raiden due to her similar outfit and believed she would have the &quot;biggest impact&quot; out of the new characters from &quot;Deception&quot;. Ashrah was ranked 45th on UGO&#x27;s 2012 list of the top 50 &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; characters. Den of Geek placed her 53rd in their 2015 ranking of the 64 series characters, opining that there was &quot;nothing special about her&quot;. Robert Naytor of Hardcore Gaming 101 made note of the character&#x27;s &quot;modest outfit&quot; in contrast to the franchise&#x27;s other female characters, but criticized her minor role in the story. Although Kevin Wong of &quot;Complex&quot; found Ashrah to be &quot;a Raiden knockoff&quot;, he praised her &quot;Voodoo Doll&quot; Fatality from &quot;Deception&quot;.

===Dairou===
: Voiced by: Josh Schmittstenstein (&quot;MK:D&quot;)
Dairou is a former guardsman from Orderrealm who was arrested for killing an assailant in anger. After breaking out prison, he became a mercenary who follows a personal code. Following his introduction in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot;, he was slated to appear in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance&quot; as an armored samurai wielding a pair of katanas. However, he was cut due to time constraints and his complex design.

Dairou, amalgamated with Havik, appears as a playable character in &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;.

Dairou makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Snow Blind&quot; as a member of the Black Dragon crime syndicate.

Although Boon had praise for Dairou&#x27;s appearance, reception to the character has been negative. He was ranked 67th by Den of Geek in their 2015 rating of the series&#x27; 73 playable characters, describing him as &quot;unbelievably generic&quot;, and Dustin Thomas of Destructoid stated &quot;there really isn&#x27;t a whole lot to say about him&quot; while ranking him third in his 2014 list of the series&#x27; five worst &quot;MK&quot; characters. Despite this, his &quot;Ribs to the Eyes&quot; Fatality in &quot;Deception&quot; is regarded as one of the franchise&#x27;s best.

===Darrius===
: Voiced by: Steve Jones (&quot;MK:D&quot;)
Darrius is the leader of a resistance movement in Orderrealm. He seeks to overthrow his realm&#x27;s government, believing they are too oppressive towards their citizens. To accomplish his goal, Darrius exploits the laws of his realm to manipulate others into joining his movement; his biography implies he had Dairou&#x27;s family murdered to instigate Dairou&#x27;s removal from the guardsmen.

Designed by Steve Beran, Darrius was the last new addition to the &quot;Deception&quot; roster. Beran described Darrius as having &quot;a &#x27;take no B.S.&#x27; attitude, like a star athlete who had made his way to fame from a rough upbringing and humble beginnings&quot;, while Ed Boon considered him a more &quot;Americanized&quot; fighting game character who had an indescribable &quot;appeal&quot; about him and Herman Sanchez called the character &quot;lean and mean, aggressive, [and with] style.&quot; According to Beran, the character&#x27;s look was inspired by 1960s and &#x27;70s comic book art, with his final appearance &quot;intended to be a mixture of those elements fused with a sleek modern approach&quot;. His alternate costume was a homage to actor Jim Kelly. Lead storyteller John Vogel expressed his desire to see Darrius in future &quot;MK&quot; installments, although he has not reappeared since &quot;Armageddon&quot;. He eventually made his return in &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot; as a kameo fighter with appearances in the story mode.

Darrius was rated 44th in the 2015 ranking of the series&#x27; 73 player characters by Gavin Jasper of Den of Geek, who found him &quot;worth revisiting down the line&quot;. Conversely, ScrewAttack named Darrius the sixth worst &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; character, calling him a &quot;knock-off&quot; of the Marvel Comics hero Blade.

===Havik===
: Voiced by: Ryan Rosenberg (&quot;MK:D&quot;, &quot;MK:A&quot;); Jacob Craner (&quot;MK1&quot;)
Havik is a denizen of Chaosrealm who, like its other inhabitants, seeks to spread disorder. In pursuit of this goal, he pits Earthrealm and Outworld&#x27;s warriors against Onaga, rescues Kabal, and convinces him to reform the Black Dragon. Following his introduction in &quot;Deception&quot;, Havik makes subsequent appearances in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot; and DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Mortal Kombat X: Blood Ties&quot;.

Two incarnations of Havik appear in &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;. The first, who bears elements of Dairou, makes a minor appearance in the story mode as a former inhabitant of Orderrealm who disagrees with their laws and seeks to destroy it. In his arcade mode ending, he succeeds in destroying Orderrealm&#x27;s capital, Seido, with Rain&#x27;s help. The second, a Titan, makes a cameo appearance in the story mode, and serves as the final boss of the &quot;Khaos Reigns&quot; DLC.

Havik, originally named &quot;Skab&quot;, was designed by Steve Beran as an alternate outfit for Noob Saibot before being given a storyline of his own. Ed Boon said that Havik was envisioned as a &quot;decaying&quot; character whose specials would look &quot;disturbing&quot; due to often featuring his limbs breaking.

Havik is generally regarded as the best character introduced in &quot;Deception&quot;. Dustin Thomas of Destructoid called him &quot;the only new character in &quot;Deception&quot; worthy of being a &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; character&quot;. Hardcore Gaming 101 described Havik as &quot;probably the least lamest of the newcomers in &quot;Deception&quot;, even though that&#x27;s not saying much&quot;. Ranking him 30th in their 2015 rating of the series&#x27; 73 characters, Den of Geek said, &quot;While the whole Orderrealm/Chaosrealm subplot never quite caught on, Havik is strong enough to exist on his own.&quot;

===Hotaru===
: Voiced by: Chase Ashbaker (&quot;MK:D&quot;)
Hotaru is a high-ranking guardsman in Orderrealm. Although not inherently evil, he aligns himself with Onaga due to Onaga&#x27;s reputation for preserving order. As part of his alignment, Hotaru pursues Sub-Zero for killing many of Onaga&#x27;s Tarkatan warriors. In turn, Hotaru is pursued by Dairou, who received a contract to assassinate him. He is depicted being killed by Dairou, Darrius, and Kenshi in their respective endings, but the 2011 reboot reveals that his death occurred during the final battle of &quot;Armageddon&quot;.

The character was conceived as a foil to Havik. His name is the Japanese word for firefly, which serves as the motif for his costume that was designed by Jennifer Hedrick.

Hotaru was ranked 43rd on UGO&#x27;s 2012 list of the top 50 &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; characters. Ranking him 60th in their 2015 rating of the series&#x27; 73 characters, Den of Geek remarked that &quot;order tends to be the more boring [compared to chaos], but Hotaru has just enough of a cool factor&quot;. Robert Workman of GamePlayBook rated Hotaru 10th in his selection of the worst series characters for his using lava as a weapon and &quot;stealing&quot; Liu Kang&#x27;s Bicycle Kick for one of his special moves.

===Kira===
:Voiced by: Christine Rios (&quot;MK:A&quot;); Courtenay Taylor (&quot;Snow Blind&quot;)
Kira is a member of the Black Dragon clan who possesses the abilities of Kano and Sonya Blade. She also wields the same daggers as Kano. Formerly an arms dealer, she becomes the first recruit of Kabal&#x27;s new clan in &quot;Deception&quot;. Early into the Konquest mode of &quot;MK: Armageddon&quot;, Kira is seen guarding a bridge alongside Kobra. Kira, however, abandons Kobra during his battle with Taven.

John Vogel described Kira as the &quot;most disciplined&quot; of the Black Dragons, while Jay Biondo called her &quot;the &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; character&quot;. Describing her as an &quot;evil Sonya Blade&quot; who was &quot;a bit easier to take seriously&quot; than Kobra, Den of Geek placed Kira 32nd in their 2015 ranking of the franchise&#x27;s 64 player characters. Her storyline as an arms dealer who disguised herself as a man was ranked fourth by John Harty of WhatCulture in his 2015 selection of the series&#x27; ten &quot;Most Badass Backstories&quot;, calling it &quot;a concept that speaks to a person having some serious balls&quot;.

===Kobra===
:Voiced by: Alex Brandon (&quot;MK:A&quot;); Yuri Lowenthal (&quot;Snow Blind&quot;)
Kobra is a martial artist who serves the Black Dragon clan. Once a disciplined fighter, he turns criminal after he starts using his training to kill others. His bloodlust catches the attention of Kabal, who makes him the second recruit of his clan in &quot;Deception&quot;. Kobra appears as Taven&#x27;s first opponent in the Konquest mode of &quot;Armageddon&quot;, in which he unsuccessfully attempts to prevent Taven from crossing a bridge.

Kobra was given the placeholder name of &quot;Ben Masters&quot; while &quot;Deception&quot; was in production, due to his physical resemblance to &quot;Street Fighter&quot; character Ken Masters. Ed Boon described Kobra in &quot;Deception&quot; as &quot;the simple character that everybody can pick up and play&quot; with easy-to-execute special moves.

In the 2022 animated film &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Snow Blind&quot;, Kobra is one of Kano&#x27;s main Black Dragon henchmen.

&quot;GamePlayBook&quot; placed Kobra sixth in their 2010 listing of the 10 worst &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; characters, unfavorably comparing him to Ken. Den of Geek rated Kobra 35th in their 2015 ranking of the 64 series characters, calling him an &quot;evil Johnny Cage&quot;.

===Onaga===
:Voiced by: Nigel Casey (&quot;MK:D&quot;, &quot;MK:A&quot;)
Onaga is the final boss of &quot;Deception&quot;. Also known as the Dragon King, he was the emperor of Outworld until he was poisoned by Shao Kahn. Once resurrected, Onaga derives his power from the Kamidogu, six mystical relics that contain the essence of each main realm. Unbeknownst to Onaga, however, he is being manipulated by the One Being into unmaking reality through the Kamidogu. The Konquest mode of &quot;Deception&quot; reveals how he manipulated Shujinko into collecting the Kamidogu for him under the identity of his avatar Damashi. He is ultimately defeated by Shujinko, but returns in &quot; Armageddon&quot;, in which he begrudgingly enters an alliance with Shao Kahn and other major villains to destroy Blaze. Onaga does not appear in the rebooted timeline, although he is occasionally referenced. In &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;&#x27;s new timeline, Onaga was defeated and captured centuries ago by General Shao&#x27;s ancestors, and General Shao tasks Reiko with taming him to use as a weapon against Outworld&#x27;s Royal Court.

The character was ranked 39th on UGO&#x27;s 2012 list of the top 50 &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; fighters.

===Shujinko===
: Voiced by: Max Crawford (&quot;MK:D&quot;, &quot;MK:A&quot;)
Shujinko is a veteran adventurer with the ability to copy the powers of his opponents. He serves as the protagonist of &quot;Deception&quot;″s Konquest mode, which depicts how he was deceived into collecting the six mystical Kamidogu for Onaga. Upon learning of the deception, Shujinko seeks redemption by using the power he received from Onaga to defeat him. Shujinko emerges victorious by destroying the Kamidogu, but believing that he has not redeemed himself, he plots to destroy Onaga and the other villains during the events of &quot;MK: Armageddon&quot;. He appears in the &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; prequel comic, where he guards Chaosrealm&#x27;s Kamidogu but becomes possessed by Havik. He also appears in Cassie Cage&#x27;s ending in the &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; game, where he is defeated by Cassie after Raiden reported him stealing souls. In &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;, he appears as an assist-based Kameo fighter. The new timeline&#x27;s version also appears in Kung Lao&#x27;s ending, where he trains under him. Due to Kung Lao not teaching him humility, he becomes a threat to the realms. After Liu Kang erases his memory, Kung Lao agrees to train him again but with Raiden at his side.

Ed Boon deemed Shujinko the series&#x27; &quot;next-generation Liu Kang&quot;, but the character was not well received. Describing him as &quot;one of the most gullible, susceptible dumbasses in video games&quot;, Den of Geek placed Shujinko 65th in their 2015 ranking of the series&#x27; 73 playable characters. ScrewAttack ranked Shujinko the eighth worst &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; character for being an &quot;older and boring&quot; Liu Kang. Bryan Dawson of Prima Games named him one of the series&#x27; &quot;cheapest&quot; characters due to his moveset of other fighters&#x27; special attacks.

==Introduced in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot;==
===Daegon===
: Voiced by: Tom Taylorson (&quot;MK:A&quot;)
Daegon is the younger of the brothers tasked with preventing Armageddon. Due to being awoken prematurely from his incubation, however, he appears physically older than Taven. The premature awakening causes Daegon to become unbalanced, resulting in him killing his parents and forming the Red Dragon clan. When Taven is properly awoken during the events of &quot;Armageddon&quot;, Daegon fights him for the right to face Blaze, but he is defeated by his older brother. Along with a background cameo in the 2011 reboot, he appears in the &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; prequel comic, which establishes him as the killer of Takeda&#x27;s mother.

The character was initially called &quot;Doug&quot; during the production of &quot;Armageddon&quot; as the developers had difficulty finding a name for him. Daegon finished 56th in Den of Geek&#x27;s 2015 ranking of the series&#x27; 73 characters. He was criticized by Hardcore Gaming 101, who opined that his in-development name was &quot;probably the most interesting thing about him&quot;.

===Taven===
: Voiced by: Shaun Himmerick (&quot;MK:A&quot;)
Taven is the older of the brothers tasked with preventing Armageddon. He serves as the protagonist of &quot;Armageddon&quot;″s training mode, which depicts his quest to save the realms by claiming Blaze&#x27;s power. The mode ends with Taven defeating Blaze, but his victory does not stop the final battle as it instead causes the other warriors to become more powerful. The 2011 reboot, however, establishes Shao Kahn claiming Blaze&#x27;s power, implying Taven was defeated by Blaze. Taven has not been featured in the storyline of the rebooted timeline, although he has appeared in non-canonical endings.

Due to difficulty in naming the character, Taven was originally called &quot;Bob&quot; until his final name was determined. Ed Boon revealed that he initially opposed Taven&#x27;s final name before it made &quot;perfect sense&quot; to him. Reception to Taven was mostly negative; Hardcore Gaming 101 called him &quot;utterly generic&quot;. Destructoid named him the series&#x27; second-worst fighter, describing him as &quot;the most bland character in &quot;MK&quot; history&quot;. Similar criticism was shared by Den of Geek in their 2015 ranking of the series&#x27; 73 playable characters, which placed him 58th and opined &quot;Taven&#x27;s generic design didn&#x27;t do him any favors&quot; when &quot;Armageddon&quot; was &quot;based around including every single playable &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; character&quot;.

==Introduced in &quot;Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe&quot;==
===Dark Kahn===
: Voiced by: Perry Brown and Patrick Seitz
Dark Kahn is the final boss of &quot;Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe&quot;. He is an amalgamation of Shao Kahn and DC Comics supervillain Darkseid, created through the accidental merging of their universes. Deriving his power from conflict, he attempts to fully merge the universes by manipulating the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; and DC warriors into fighting each other. Dark Kahn is ultimately defeated by Raiden and Superman, who manage to overcome his manipulation. Following Dark Kahn&#x27;s destruction, Shao Kahn and Darkseid become trapped in their counterparts&#x27; universe; Darkseid is sent to the Netherrealm, while Shao Kahn is imprisoned in the Phantom Zone.

==Introduced in &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (2011)==
===Skarlet===
:Voiced by: Beata Poźniak
Skarlet is a warrior created by Shao Kahn using sorcery and the blood of countless warriors. She debuts in the 2011 series reboot, where her purpose is to discern Quan Chi&#x27;s true reason for attending the Mortal Kombat tournament. In &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;, her background is changed to that as an orphan adopted by Shao Kahn to learn blood magic upon her eventual transformation into an imperial bodyguard and assassin. Skarlet uses kodachi swords and kunai knives as well as her power to turn into, and absorb the blood of her victims in addition to being able to manipulate her victim&#x27;s blood.

Similar to the Ermac rumors in the first &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, Skarlet originated as a nonexistent character in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; due to false reports of a glitch nicknamed &quot;Scarlet&quot; by players in which the palette swaps of either Kitana or Mileena would turn red. Nearly two decades after the rumors originated, she was announced as one of the 2011 reboot&#x27;s first downloadable (DLC) playable characters. She plays a minor role in DC Comics&#x27; 2015 &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; comic series set before the events of the game, but does not appear in the game itself. Skarlet has been noted by gaming media outlets for the graphic nature of her character and her Fatalities.

===Cassie Cage===
===D&#x27;Vorah===
: Voiced by: Kelly Hu (&quot;MKX&quot;, &quot;MK11&quot;), Debra Wilson (&quot;Battle of the Realms&quot;)
D&#x27;Vorah is a Kytinn, a humanoid race with insect/arachnid traits. Her name is derived from the Hebrew word for bee. She is first seen serving Kotal Kahn in &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot;, but is secretly in allegiance with Shinnok, which results in her being defeated by Cassie Cage. In &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;, D&#x27;Vorah joins Kronika&#x27;s efforts in restarting the timeline. Although she kills the present version of Scorpion, she is forced to retreat after his past counterpart injures her; her subsequent fate is unknown.

D&#x27;Vorah appears in the 2021 animated film &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Battle of the Realms&quot;, voiced by Debra Wilson.

The character has received a polarizing reception. Melody MacReady of Screen Rant noted that while D&#x27;Vorah is praised for her design, she has generated controversy for killing popular characters such as Baraka, Mileena, and Scorpion in the games&#x27; storyline. She ranked 25th in &quot;Den of Geek&#x27;s&quot; 2015 rating of the series&#x27; 73 playable characters, which called her &quot;a great new addition to the roster&quot; and lauded that she was &quot;filled with all sorts of creepy surprises&quot;.

===Erron Black===
: Voiced by: Troy Baker
Erron Black is a mercenary from Earthrealm, but in the service of Outworld. Depicted as a 19th-century gunfighter from the Old West, his backstory reveals that his body&#x27;s aging was slowed by Shang Tsung in exchange for murdering an unidentified Earthrealm warrior. As a result, he utilizes 19th century weaponry. He serves Kotal Kahn in &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot;, which puts him into conflict with Earthrealm&#x27;s warriors. &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; features a past version of Erron Black who both serves Shao Kahn and is a member of the Black Dragon, while his present counterpart assists Kitana in defeating Shao Kahn&#x27;s forces.

Black appears in the 2022 animated film &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Snow Blind&quot; as one of Kano&#x27;s Black Dragon henchmen.

The character placed 10th in &quot;Den of Geek&#x27;s&quot; rating of the series&#x27; 73 playable characters in 2015, the highest of any fighter not introduced in the first three games, which described him as &quot;the Boba Fett of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;&quot;.

===Ferra/Torr===
: Voiced by: Tara Strong (Ferra); Fred Tatasciore (Torr)
Ferra and Torr are a duo belonging to an Outworld symbiotic species. Through their relationship, the diminutive Ferra rides the massive Torr into battle, while Torr serves as their enforcer. During gameplay, the player controls Torr, with Ferra utilized for special attacks; as such, fatalities and brutalities are performed directly on Torr. Their ending in &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; establishes Ferra is a juvenile who will be mounted by a rider when she reaches maturity and Torr will die without her. In the story mode of &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot;, Ferra and Torr serve Kotal Kahn, which leads to them fighting Earthrealm&#x27;s warriors; they are ultimately incapacitated by Sub-Zero.

Ebenezer Samuel of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; called Ferra and Torr a &quot;highlight&quot; of the game, with their in-gameplay mannerisms &quot;distracting enough to take your eye off the battle, and quirky enough that it&#x27;s worth watching.&quot; They ranked 39th in the ranking of the series characters by Den of Geek, who praised them as &quot;the most original new race the series has introduced in years&quot;.

===Jacqui Briggs===
: Voiced by: Danielle Nicolet (&quot;MKX&quot;); Megalyn Echikunwoke (&quot;MK11&quot;)
Jacqui Briggs is a Special Forces operative who uses a pair of electronic gauntlets as her primary weapon. The daughter of Jax and best friend of Cassie Cage, she debuts in &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; as a member of Cassie Cage&#x27;s unit, with whom she helps defeat the threatening forces of Outworld and the Netherrealm. She also becomes the love interest to Takeda. In &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;, Jacqui and the past version of her father are forced to face the present version of Jax when he aligns himself with Kronika. After the present version realizes his mistakes, she fights alongside both versions of her father in the battle against Kronika&#x27;s forces. In &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;, Jacqui is not present in the new timeline as Jax had not married yet, but appears in the final battle as one of Shang Tsung&#x27;s minions summoned to oppose Liu Kang.

Den of Geek ranked Jacqui 47th in their ranking of the 73 series characters, praising her for being &quot;fun to play as&quot; while finding that &quot;she doesn&#x27;t stand out nearly enough&quot;. Ikhtear Shahrukh of &quot;The Daily Star&quot; opined that Jacqui &quot;fit[s] into typical generic fighter game character stereotypes instead of being &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; material&quot;.

===Kotal Kahn===
: Voiced by: Phil LaMarr
Kotal Kahn is the emperor of Outworld in &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;. He is an Osh-Tekk, an Aztec-inspired species whose powers originate from the sun, and wields a macuahuitl as his primary weapon. Embroiled in a civil war against Mileena in &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot;, he receives support from the Earthrealm warriors, but turns against them due to D&#x27;Vorah&#x27;s deception. Kotal Kahn later leads an invasion of Earthrealm, which is driven back by the Lin Kuei. In &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;, his rule is threatened by the return of Shao Kahn. After Shao Kahn cripples him, he names Kitana the new ruler of Outworld. He does not appear during the battle against Kronika in the original story mode, but &quot;Aftermath&quot; sees him participate after his injures heal; he is killed by Shao Kahn in a surprise attack. Although he does not physically appear in Mortal Kombat 1 he is mentioned to have been defeated off screen by Raiden as part of the tournament.

The character was ranked 15th on Den of Geek&#x27;s list of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; characters, which compared him to Black Adam and Namor as an &quot;honorable&quot; emperor who &quot;will do anything to protect his planetary kingdom&quot;.

===Kung Jin===
===Takeda Takahashi===
: Voiced by: Parry Shen
Takeda is the son of Kenshi and a member of the Shirai Ryu clan and Cassie Cage&#x27;s Special Forces unit whose primary weapon is a pair of bladed whips. Following his mother&#x27;s murder, Takeda was raised and trained by Hanzo Hisashi as Kenshi wanted him to be properly prepared to avenge her. First appearing in &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot;, Takeda assists Cage in combatting Outworld and Netherrealm forces, forming a relationship with teammate Jacqui Briggs in the process. While he does not appear in &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;, Jacqui states that they have become engaged.

Three incarnations of Takeda appear in &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;. The first, an NPC, makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in the story mode as an evil alternate timeline variant summoned to aid Titan Shang Tsung, only to be killed by Titan Kitana. The second, a downloadable playable character, is Kenshi&#x27;s cousin instead of his son. Additionally, he previously worked for the Yakuza, who sent him to kill Kenshi for his betrayal. After being injured and put into the Shirai Ryu&#x27;s care, Takeda temporarily joins them before leaving to dismantle the Yakuza. In his arcade mode ending, he discovers the Yakuza answer to a more powerful crime syndicate called the Red Dragon and works to dismantle them instead. The third, also an NPC, appears in the &quot;Khaos Reigns&quot; DLC as a variant from Titan Havik&#x27;s timeline and a member of his army.

Takeda was ranked 36th in Den of Geek&#x27;s list of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; characters, which found that he &quot;works best as an accessory to Scorpion, finally giving him some semblance of family and helping to give him closure&quot;.

===Triborg===
: Voiced by: Vic Chao
Triborg is a cybernetic warrior created from the consciousnesses of Sektor, Cyrax, Smoke, and Sub-Zero. As a result, he is able to replicate the abilities of each. Depending on the variation selected by the player, Triborg will appear as one of the Lin Kuei cyborgs and utilize his special moves during gameplay. He debuted as a downloadable character in &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot;, where his backstory establishes that he seeks to destroy all organic life. However, he has no involvement in the storyline of the game. Triborg was excluded from the &quot;Den of Geek&quot; ranking of the series&#x27; fighters, as writer Gavin Jasper found him to be &quot;a Voltron of existing characters&quot;.

==Introduced in &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;==

===Cetrion===
: Voiced by: Mary Elizabeth McGlynn
Cetrion is the Elder Goddess of life and virtue. She utilizes nature and the elements as her primary powers. As the daughter of Kronika and sister of Shinnok, Cetrion is intended to balance the darkness represented by her brother. Despite her benevolent appearance, however, she maintains loyalty to Kronika. This loyalty leads to Cetrion allowing Kronika to absorb her essence in both the original story mode of &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; and the &quot;Aftermath&quot; expansion.

Ranking her 38th in his list of the series&#x27; characters, Gavin Jasper of Den of Geek called Cetrion &quot;more nightmarish&quot; than Shinnok.

===Geras===
: Voiced by: Dave B. Mitchell (&quot;MK11&quot;); Phil LaMarr (&quot;MK1&quot;)
Geras is an artificial construct created by Kronika to serve as her primary enforcer. Named after the Greek deity of old age, his powers are based around manipulating sand and time. The story mode of &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; establishes that he also possesses regenerative abilities, effectively rendering him immortal. As the Earthrealm heroes are unable to kill him, Raiden defeats Geras by throwing him into Netherrealm&#x27;s bottomless Sea of Blood. The &quot;Aftermath&quot; expansion, however, depicts Geras being incapacitated by Shao Kahn, despite his immortality powers. In &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;, Liu Kang makes Geras his advisor and entrusts him with monitoring the new timeline.

Gavin Jasper of Den of Geek ranked Geras 20th in his list of the series&#x27; characters, with praise for his time manipulation powers and calling his ability to alter the game&#x27;s match timer &quot;such a wonderful, brilliant asshole move&quot;.

===Kollector===
: Voiced by: Andrew Morgado
Kollector is a Naknadan, a six-armed species in Outworld. His multiple arms allow him to utilize a wide array of weaponry, including a lantern, chain mace, bag bomb, and vials of fire. As implied by his name, he served as tribute collector for Shao Kahn until the emperor&#x27;s death. When Shao Kahn returns in the story mode of &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;, Kollector rejoins his forces, but is defeated by Kitana. In the &quot;Aftermath&quot; expansion, he is the first to notice the time-displaced Shang Tsung, Fujin, and Nightwolf arrive in Outworld, leading to him being defeated by the lattermost. Kollector appears as a cameo in &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot; in the game&#x27;s Invasions mode where he acts as a shopkeeper players can purchase items from.

Ranked 45th in his list of the series&#x27; characters, Gavin Jasper of Den of Geek spoke highly of the Kollector&#x27;s animation and fighting style, but found that &quot;he showed up a little too late to the party&quot;.

===Kronika===
: Voiced by: Jennifer Hale
Kronika is the final boss of &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;. She is a Titan, a deity predating the Elder Gods, and responsible for maintaining the universe&#x27;s timeline. As such, her powers center around space and time manipulation. &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;″s story mode depicts her efforts to maintain the conflict between good and evil by restarting the timeline, while also removing Raiden from history. Although Kronika succeeds in bringing the timeline back to its beginning, she is destroyed by Fire God Liu Kang, who becomes the new keeper of time. Kronika returns in the &quot;Aftermath&quot; expansion when Shang Tsung goes back in time to retrieve her crown, which is required to control the timeline. She is ultimately erased from existence by Shang Tsung, while either Shang Tsung or Liu Kang becomes the keeper of time, depending on who the player selects in the battle between them. However, &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot; reveals the fight over the possession of Hourglass between both Liu Kang and Shang Tsung ripped apart the fabric of reality, creating a multiverse where the two rivals, alongside their allies and enemies, each become victors and Time Keeper Titans of their respective new timelines.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;, Titan Shang Tsung disguises himself as Kronika and calls himself &quot;Damashi&quot; when visiting Liu Kang&#x27;s new timeline to mentor his Outworlder counterpart, alongside that timeline&#x27;s Quan Chi, who is also an Outworlder, into becoming the powerful sorcerers they were in previous timelines. In truth, Titan Shang Tsung manipulates Liu Kang timeline&#x27;s Deadly Alliance, Shao and later Bi-Han into becoming villains like in previous timelines, then dispose of them alongside all lives in that timeline before merging it with his. It is revealed that the power Kronika possessed, combined with her obsession to find perfect balance drove her insane, and she was responsible for the creation of the Deadly Alliance, forging the destinies of Shang Tsung and Quan Chi as powerful sorcerers, something that would later backfire for not only Kronika, but for the realms entirely.

Originally developed as a male deity, Kronika is noted as the first female boss in the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; franchise. She was ranked 23rd in the Den of Geek&#x27;s series characters list, the second-highest final boss behind Shao Kahn, which praised her as &quot;a great major villain&quot; who was &quot;scary not because of her pure might, but because of her affronting divinity&quot;.

==Introduced in &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;==

===Floyd===
Floyd is a Pink-colored ninja who appears as an unplayable secret boss in &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;. His color scheme is a direct reference to the band Pink Floyd. Similar to Reptile in the original &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; title, as well both Smoke and Noob Saibot in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;, he is fought after completing various challenges and utilizes moves from all of the other male ninjas, much like Chameleon.

===Janet Cage===
:Voiced by: Courtenay Taylor
Debuting as a non-playable Kameo Fighter in &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;, Janet Cage is a gender-flipped variant of Johnny Cage from an unknown timeline that Liu Kang handpicked in the second Battle of Armageddon.

===Madam Bo===
:Voiced by: Kelly Hu
Originally debuting as a supporting character in the story mode of &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;, Madam Bo operates a tea house in Raiden and Kung Lao&#x27;s hometown of Fengjian and has trained them in martial arts since they were kids. When she believes that both of them are ready to become champions of Earthrealm, she assists Sub-Zero, Scorpion, and Smoke in testing them by playing dead after being thrown off the balcony by Smoke to get them to fight the Lin Kuei members. Madam Bo reappears at the end of the story mode, serving food and tea to Liu Kang, Johnny Cage, Kenshi, Raiden, and Kung Lao, before leaving the latter four with the bill. In various pre-fight dialogues, it is revealed that Madam Bo used to be a member of the Lin Kuei, and that she and Longwei, the Lin Kuei&#x27;s master armorer, are Sektor&#x27;s parents.

==Other==
===Belokk===
Belokk was originally slated for &quot;Mortal Kombat Gold&quot; but was cut from the final release. He was created by Eurocom and, according to Ed Boon, was removed from the game as the developers did not have time to complete him. Nevertheless, Eurocom accidentally sent information about the game with Belokk in it to &quot;Game Informer&quot;, and as a result, six screenshots of him were leaked to the public in a preview, upon special request.

==Guest characters==
Guest characters from various media franchises have appeared in subsequent &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; games following the 2008 crossover title &quot;Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe&quot;.

<text>Daniel M. Nakamura (born 1966), better known by his stage name Dan the Automator, is an American record producer. He is the founder of the publishing company Sharkman Music and the record label 75 Ark.

==Early life==
Daniel M. Nakamura was born in San Francisco, California, in 1966. His parents spent time in Japanese internment camps as children. His father worked for the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency and his mother taught at City College of San Francisco. As a child, he learned to play violin. While in high school, he became immersed in hip hop culture. He graduated from San Francisco State University.
==Career==
Nakamura started his career as a DJ when he was a teenager. After seeing the younger DJs DJ Qbert and Mix Master Mike performing live, he decided to focus on producing tracks. He first gained attention for his work on Kool Keith&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;Dr. Octagonecologyst&quot;. His debut EP, &quot;Music to Be Murdered By&quot;, was released in 1989. He released his debut album &quot;A Much Better Tomorrow&quot; in 2000, an expansion of his 1996 EP &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot;. Keith featured extensively across both versions.

He composed the score for the 2019 comedy film &quot;Booksmart&quot;, with the soundtrack album released that same year.

===Collaborations===
In 1999, Nakamura and Prince Paul formed the collaborative project Handsome Boy Modeling School, assuming the alter egos Nathaniel Merriweather and Chest Rockwell, respectively. Their debut album &quot;So... How&#x27;s Your Girl?&quot; featured numerous guest musicians, including Róisín Murphy, DJ Shadow, and Del the Funky Homosapien. They released a second album, &quot;White People&quot;, in November 2004, with collaborators including RZA, Cat Power, and Mike Patton. Nakamura used the Nathaniel Merriweather pseudonym for his Lovage project with Patton and Jennifer Charles. After Paul briefly left the duo over a business dispute, Handsome Boy Modelling School have since played further shows and spoken of a forthcoming third album.

In 2000, Nakamura joined Del the Funky Homosapien and Kid Koala to form Deltron 3030. They released their eponymous debut album the same year, featuring guest appearances by Sean Lennon and Damon Albarn. In 2001 he produced the debut album of Albarn&#x27;s &quot;animated&quot; band Gorillaz, appearing as a member of the band, alongside Del the Funky Homosapien. Both later appeared on the second Deltron 3030 record, &quot;Event 2&quot;, released in September 2013. The album also featured appearances by Jamie Cullum, Emily Wells and Zack De La Rocha, with interludes performed by actors David Cross, Amber Tamblyn and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

Nakamura is one half of Got a Girl, along with actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead. The duo&#x27;s debut album, &quot;I Love You but I Must Drive Off This Cliff Now&quot;, was released in 2014. In September 2015, they embarked on a four-city tour of Seattle, San Francisco, New York City, and Los Angeles, where they played their entire album live, including a cover of Handsome Boy Modeling School&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Thinking&quot;.

In 2023, Handsome Boy Modeling School released a limited release LP of 7 new songs in collaboration with Fords Gin.

In 2025, Nakamura was announced as one of the remixers for the 2026 FIFA World Cup theme, representing the San Francisco Bay Area.

<text>A currency future, also known as an FX future or a foreign exchange future, is a futures contract to exchange one currency for another at a specified date in the future at a price (exchange rate) that is fixed on the purchase date; see Foreign exchange derivative.

Typically, one of the currencies is the US dollar. The &quot;price&quot; of a future is then in terms of US dollars per unit of other currency. This can be different from the standard way of quoting in the spot foreign exchange markets. The &quot;trade unit&quot; of each contract is then a certain amount of other currency, for instance €125,000. Most contracts have physical delivery, so for those held at the end of the last trading day, actual payments are made in each currency. However, most contracts are closed out before that. Investors can close out the contract at any time prior to the contract&#x27;s delivery date.

==History==
Currency futures were first created in 1970 at the International Commercial Exchange in New York. But the contracts did not &quot;take off&quot; because the Bretton Woods system was still in effect. On 15 August 1971, President Richard Nixon abandoned both the gold standard and the system of fixed exchange rates. Some commodity traders at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) did not have access to the inter-bank exchange markets in the early 1970s, when they believed that significant changes were about to take place in the currency market. The CME established the International Monetary Market (IMM) and launched trading in seven currency futures on May 16, 1972.

The CME actually now gives credit to the International Commercial Exchange (not to be confused with ICE) for creating the currency contract, and state that they came up with the idea independently of the International Commercial Exchange. Today, the IMM is a division of CME. In the fourth quarter of 2009, CME Group FX volume averaged 754,000 contracts per day, reflecting average daily notional value of approximately $100 billion. Currently most of these are traded electronically.

Other futures exchanges that trade currency futures are Euronext.liffe and Intercontinental Exchange .

== Terms ==
For currency futures traded on the CME the conventional maturity dates are the IMM dates, namely the third Wednesday in March, June, September and December. The conventional option maturity dates are the first Friday after the first Wednesday for the given month.

More recently, serial months have been added. For instance, EUR/USD terms are now 20 consecutive quarters (5 years) plus 3 serial contract months.

==Uses==

===Hedging===
Investors use these futures contracts to hedge against foreign exchange risk. If an investor will receive a cashflow denominated in a foreign currency on some future date, that investor can lock in the current exchange rate by entering into an offsetting currency futures position that expires on the date of the cashflow.

For example, Jane is a US-based investor who will receive €1,000,000 on December 1. The current exchange rate implied by the futures is . She can lock in this exchange rate by selling €1,000,000 worth of futures contracts expiring on December 1. That way, she is guaranteed an exchange rate of regardless of exchange rate fluctuations in the meantime.

===Speculation===
Currency futures can also be used to speculate and, by incurring a risk, attempt to profit from rising or falling exchange rates.

For example, Peter buys 10 September CME Euro FX Futures for €1,250,000 (each contract worth €125,000), at . At the end of the day, the futures close at . The change in price is . As each contract is over €125,000, and he has 10 contracts, his profit is . As with any future, this is paid to him immediately.

More generally, each change of (the minimum Commodity tick size), is a profit or loss of per contract.

<text>Saint-Tropez ( , ; ) is a commune in the Var department and the region of Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur, Southern France. It is west of Nice and east of Marseille, on the French Riviera, of which it is one of the best-known towns. In 2018, Saint-Tropez had a population of 4,103. The adjacent narrow body of water is the Gulf of Saint-Tropez (French: &quot;Golfe de Saint-Tropez&quot;), stretching to Sainte-Maxime to the north under the Massif des Maures.

Saint-Tropez was a military stronghold and fishing village until the beginning of the 20th century. It was the first town on its coast to be liberated during World War II as part of Operation Dragoon. After the war, it became an internationally known seaside resort, renowned principally because of the influx of artists of the French New Wave in cinema and the Yé-yé movement in music. It later became a resort for the European and American jet set and tourists.

== History ==

In 599 BC, the Phocaeans from Ionia founded Massilia (present-day Marseille) and established other coastal mooring sites in the area. Through the writings of Roman historian and military commander Pliny the Elder, it was found that Saint-Tropez was known in ancient times as Athenopolis and that it belonged to the Massilians. In 31 BC, the Romans invaded the region. Their citizens built many opulent villas in the area, including one known as the &quot;Villa des Platanes&quot; (Villa of the Plane Trees). The closest settlement to Saint-Tropez in antiquity is attested as Heraclea-Caccabaria, today Cavalaire-sur-Mer, situated on the southern end of the peninsula, while the gulf of Saint-Tropez was called , which likely survives in the settlement name of Les Issambres.

The town owes its current name to the early Christian martyr Saint Torpes. Legend tells of his decapitation at Pisa during Nero&#x27;s reign, with his body placed in a rotten boat along with a rooster and a dog. The body purportedly landed at the present-day location of the town of Saint-Tropez.

Toward the end of the ninth century, long after the fall of the Roman Empire in the West, pirates and privateers began a hundred years of attacks and sackings. In the tenth century, the village of La Garde-Freinet was founded to the north of Saint-Tropez. From 890 to 972, Saint-Tropez and its surroundings became an Arab Muslim colony dominated by the nearby Saracenic settlement of Fraxinet; in 940, Saint-Tropez was controlled by Nasr ibn Ahmad. From 961 to 963, Adalbert, son of Berengar, the pretender to the throne of Lombardy who was pursued by Otto I, hid at Saint-Tropez. In 972, the Muslims of Saint-Tropez held Maïeul, the abbot of Cluny, for ransom.

In 976, William I, Count of Provence, Lord of Grimaud, began attacking the Muslims, and in 980 he built a tower where the Suffren tower now stands. In 1079 and 1218, Papal bulls mentioned the existence of a manor at Saint-Tropez.

From 1436, Count René I (the &quot;good King René&quot;) tried to repopulate Provence. He created the Barony of Grimaud and appealed to the Genoan Raphael de Garezzio, a wealthy gentleman who had sent a fleet of caravels carrying 60 Genoese families to the area. In return, Count René promised to exempt the citizens from taxation. On 14 February 1470, Jean de Cossa, Baron of Grimaud and Grand Seneschal of Provence, agreed that the Genoan could build city walls and two large towers, which still stand: one tower is at the end of the Grand Môle and the other is at the entrance to the Ponche.

The city became a small republic with its own fleet and army and was administered by two consuls and 12 elected councillors. In 1558, the city&#x27;s captain Honorat Coste was empowered to protect the city. The captain led a militia and mercenaries who successfully resisted attacks by the Turks and Spanish, succored Fréjus and Antibes and helped the Archbishop of Bordeaux regain control of the Lérins Islands.

In 1577, the daughter of the Marquis Lord of Castellane, Genevieve de Castilla, married Jean-Baptiste de Suffren, Marquis de Saint-Cannet, Baron de La Môle, and advisor to the parliament of Provence. The lordship of Saint-Tropez became the prerogative of the De Suffren family. One of the most notable members of this family was the later vice-admiral Pierre André de Suffren de Saint-Tropez (1729–1788), veteran of the War of the Austrian Succession, the Seven Years&#x27; War and the American Revolutionary War.

In September 1615, Saint-Tropez was visited by a delegation led by the Japanese samurai Hasekura Tsunenaga that was on its way to Rome but was forced by weather to stop in the town. This may have been the first contact between the French and the Japanese.

The local noblemen were responsible for raising an army that repulsed a fleet of Spanish galleons on 15 June 1637; &quot;Les Bravades des Espagnols&quot;, a local religious and military celebration, commemorates this victory of the Tropezian militia. Count René&#x27;s promise in 1436 to not tax the citizens of Saint-Tropez was honored until 1672, when Louis XIV abrogated it as he imposed French control.

The Gulf of Saint-Tropez was known as the Gulf of Grimaud until the end of the 19th century.

During the 1920s, Saint-Tropez attracted famous figures from the fashion world such as Coco Chanel and Elsa Schiaparelli. During World War II, the landing on 15 August 1944 began the Allied invasion of southern France, Operation Dragoon. In the 1950s, Saint-Tropez became internationally renowned as the setting for such films as &quot;And God Created Woman&quot;, which starred French actress Brigitte Bardot.

In May 1965, an Aérospatiale Super Frelon pre-production aircraft crashed in the gulf, killing its pilot.

On 4 March 1970, the French submarine &quot;Eurydice&quot;, with its home port as Saint-Tropez, disappeared in the Mediterranean with 57 crew aboard after a mysterious explosion.

The motto of Saint-Tropez is &quot;&quot;, Latin for &quot;faithful to the end&quot;. After the Dark Age of plundering the French Riviera, Raphaël de Garesio landed in Saint-Tropez on 14 February 1470, with 22 men, simple peasants or sailors who had left the overcrowded Italian Riviera. They rebuilt and repopulated the area, and in exchange were granted by a representative of the &quot;good king&quot;, Jean de Cossa, Baron of Grimaud and Seneschal of Provence, various privileges, including some previously reserved exclusively for lords, such as exemptions from taxes status and the right to bear arms. About ten years later, a great wall with towers stood watch to protect the new houses from sea and land attack; some 60 families formed the new community. On 19 July 1479, the new Home Act was signed, &quot;the rebirth charter of Saint-Tropez&quot;.

== Climate ==
Saint-Tropez has a hot-summer mediterranean climate with mild winters and hot summers, although daytime temperatures are somewhat moderated by its coastal position.
==Economy==

The main economic resource of Saint-Tropez is tourism. The city is well known for the Hôtel Byblos and for Les Caves du Roy, a member of the Leading Hotels of the World; its 1967 inauguration featuring Brigitte Bardot and Gunter Sachs was an international event.

===Beaches===

Tropezian beaches are located along the coast in the Baie de Pampelonne, which lies south of Saint-Tropez and east of Ramatuelle. Pampelonne offers a collection of beaches along its five-kilometre shore. Each beach is around 30 metres wide with its own beach hut and private or public tanning area.

Many of the beaches offer windsurfing, sailing and canoeing equipment for rent, while others offer motorized water sports, such as power boats, jet bikes, water skiing and scuba diving. Some of the beaches are naturist beaches. There are also many exclusive beach clubs that are popular among wealthy people from around the world.

====Toplessness and nudity====
Saint-Tropez&#x27;s Tahiti Beach, which had been popularised in the film &quot;And God Created Woman&quot; featuring Brigitte Bardot, emerged as a clothing-optional destination, but the mayor of Saint-Tropez ordered police to ban toplessness and to watch over the beach via helicopter. The &quot;clothing fights&quot; between the gendarmerie and nudists become the main topic of a famous French comedy film series, &quot;Le gendarme de Saint-Tropez&quot; (&quot;The Troops of St. Tropez&quot;) featuring Louis de Funès. In the end, the nudist side prevailed. Topless sunbathing is now the norm for both men and women from Pampelonne beaches to yachts in the centre of Saint-Tropez port. The Tahiti beach is now clothing-optional, but nudists often head to private nudist beaches, such as that in Cap d&#x27;Agde.

===Port===
The port was widely used during the 18th century; in 1789 it was visited by 80 ships. Saint-Tropez&#x27;s shipyards built tartanes and three-masted ships that could carry 1,000 to 12,200 barrels. The town was the site of various associated trades, including fishing, cork, wine and wood. The town had a school of hydrography. In 1860, the flagship of the merchant navy, named &quot;The Queen of the Angels&quot; (&quot;La Reine des Anges&quot;, a three-masted ship of 740 barrels capacity), was built at Saint-Tropez.

Its role as a commercial port declined, and it is now primarily a tourist spot and a base for many well-known sail regattas. There is fast boat transportation with Les Bateaux Verts to Sainte-Maxime on the other side of the bay and to Port Grimaud, Marines de Cogolin, Les Issambres and St-Aygulf.

===Events===

====Les Bravades de Saint-Tropez====
&quot;Les Bravades de Saint-Tropez&quot; is an annual celebration held in the middle of May when people of the town celebrate their patron saint, Torpes of Pisa, and their military achievements. One of the oldest traditions of Provence, it has been held for more than 450 years since the citizens of Saint-Tropez were first given special permission to form a militia to protect the town from the Barbary pirates. During the three-day celebration, the various militias in costumes of the time fire their muskets into the air at traditional stops, march to the sound of bands and parade St. Torpes&#x27;s bust. The townspeople also attend a mass wearing traditional Provençal costume.

====Les Voiles de Saint-Tropez====

Each year, at the end of September, a regatta is held in the bay of Saint-Tropez (). Many yachts are entered, some as long as 50 metres. Many tourists come to the location for this event, or as a stop on their trip to Cannes, Marseille or Nice.

== Traditional dishes ==
The Tarte tropézienne is a traditional cake invented by a Polish confectioner who had set up shop in Saint-Tropez in the mid-1950s, and made famous by actress Brigitte Bardot.

Saint-Tropez was also attractive for the next generation of painters: Bernard Buffet, David Hockney, Massimo Campigli and Donald Sultan lived and worked there. Today, Stefan Szczesny continues this tradition.

<doc id="929833" wikidata="Q595934" url="?curid=929833" title="Young Goodman Brown">
<text>&quot;Young Goodman Brown&quot; is a short story published in 1835 by American writer Nathaniel Hawthorne. The story takes place in 17th-century Puritan New England, a common setting for Hawthorne&#x27;s works, and addresses the Calvinist/Puritan belief that all of humanity exists in a state of depravity, but that God has destined some to unconditional election through unmerited grace. Hawthorne frequently focuses on the tensions within Puritan culture, yet steeps his stories in the Puritan sense of sin. In a symbolic fashion, the story follows Young Goodman Brown&#x27;s journey into self-scrutiny, which results in his loss of virtue and belief.

==Plot==
The story begins at dusk in Salem Village, Massachusetts as young Goodman Brown leaves Faith, his wife of three months, for some unknown errand in the forest. Faith pleads with her husband to stay with her, but he insists that the journey must be completed that night. In the forest he meets an older man, dressed in a similar manner and bearing a physical resemblance to himself. The man carries a black serpent-shaped staff. Deeper in the woods, the two encounter Goody Cloyse, an older woman, whom Young Goodman had known as a boy and who had taught him his catechism. Cloyse complains about the need to walk; the older man throws his staff on the ground for the woman and quickly leaves with Brown.

Other townspeople inhabit the woods that night, traveling in the same direction as Goodman Brown. When he hears his wife&#x27;s voice in the trees, he calls out but is not answered. He then runs angrily through the forest, distraught that his beautiful Faith is lost somewhere in the dark, sinful forest. He soon stumbles upon a clearing at midnight where all the townspeople assembled. At the ceremony, which is carried out at a flame-lit altar of rocks, the newest acolytes are brought forth—Goodman Brown and Faith. They are the only two of the townspeople not yet initiated. Goodman Brown calls to heaven and Faith to resist and instantly the scene vanishes. Arriving back at his home in Salem the next morning, Goodman Brown is uncertain whether the previous night&#x27;s events were real or a dream, but he is deeply shaken, and his belief that he lives in a devout Christian community is unsettled. He loses his faith in his wife, along with all of humanity. He lives out the rest of his life as an embittered and suspicious cynic, wary of everyone around him. The story concludes: &quot;And when he had lived long, and was borne to his grave...they carved no hopeful verse upon his tombstone, for his dying hour was gloom.&quot;

==Development and publication history==

The story is set during the Salem witch trials, at which Hawthorne&#x27;s great-great-grandfather John Hathorne was a judge, guilt over which inspired the author to change his family&#x27;s name, adding a &quot;w&quot; in his early twenties, shortly after graduating from college. In his writings Hawthorne questioned established thought—most specifically New England Puritanism and contemporary Transcendentalism. In &quot;Young Goodman Brown&quot;, as with much of his other writing, he utilizes ambiguity.

&quot;Young Goodman Brown&quot; was first published in the Boston-based &quot;The New-England Magazine&quot; in its April 1835 issue. It did not include Hawthorne&#x27;s name and was instead credited &quot;by the author of &#x27;The Gray Champion&#x27;&quot;. It was finally published with the author&#x27;s name in &quot;Mosses from an Old Manse&quot; in 1846.

==Analysis==

===Interpretation of Evil Human Nature===

&quot;Young Goodman Brown&quot; is often characterized as an allegory about the recognition of evil and depravity as the nature of humanity. Much of Hawthorne&#x27;s fiction, such as &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;, is set in 17th-century colonial America, particularly Salem Village. Language of the period is used to enhance the setting. Hawthorne gives the characters specific names that depict abstract pure and wholesome beliefs, such as &quot;Young Goodman Brown&quot; and &quot;Faith&quot;. The characters&#x27; names ultimately serve as a paradox in the conclusion of the story. The inclusion of this technique was to provide a definite contrast and irony. Hawthorne aims to critique the ideals of Puritan society and express his disdain for it, thus illustrating the difference between the appearance of those in society and their true identities.

Literary scholar Walter Shear writes that Hawthorne structured the story in three parts. The first part shows Goodman Brown at his home in his village integrated in his society. The second part of the story is an extended dreamlike/nightmare sequence in the forest for a single night. The third part shows his return to society and to his home, yet he is so profoundly changed that in rejecting the greeting of his wife Faith, Hawthorne shows Goodman Brown has lost faith and rejected the tenets of his Puritan world during the course of the night.

The story is about Brown&#x27;s loss of faith as one of the elect, according to scholar Jane Eberwein. Believing himself to be of the elect, Goodman Brown falls into self-doubt after three months of marriage which to him represents sin and depravity as opposed to salvation. His journey to the forest is symbolic of Christian &quot;self-exploration&quot; in which doubt immediately supplants faith. At the end of the forest experience he loses his wife Faith, his faith in salvation, and his faith in human goodness.

===Interpretation of Impossible Perfection===

One interpretation of the text is as an allegory to emphasize how perfection as impossible, through interactions in the forest. The author introduces the shadowy figure as an &quot;elder person as simply clad as a younger, [with] an indescribable air of one who knew the world&quot;. The author depicts this evil figure as not only similar to Goodman Brown, but also more educated in his age. After establishing the dark figure’s legitimacy, he delivers a message that only the young and naïve believe that perfection can be achieved. The devil claims to have helped his father &quot;set fire to an Indian village, in King Philip&#x27;s war.&quot; By shattering Young Goodman Brown&#x27;s conception that his fathers were paragons of Puritan ideals, Young Goodman Brown began his slow descent until his &quot;dying hour of gloom,&quot; setting up a perspective that perfection is merely an illusion by showing how believers set themselves up for a sad death. Similarly, the futility of perfection can also be ascertained at the final Devil meeting. The first thing Goodman Brown hears when he arrives is &quot;a familiar [tune] in the choir of the village meetinghouse.&quot; This comparison brings to mind a setting in which the piety and perfection preached by the church contrasts the reality of human imperfection. True to its set up, the dark sable figure presumed to be the devil delivers a conversion speech for the Goodman Brown by lecturing how Puritans &quot;shrank from your own sin, contrasting it with their lives of righteousness and prayerful aspirations heavenward... This night it shall be granted you to know their secret deeds: how hoary-bearded elders of the church have whispered wanton words to the young maids of their households.&quot; By highlighting the &quot;wanton words&quot; and &quot;secret deeds&quot; that Puritans conceal in fear of being found out, the devil elucidates the hypocrisy that the Puritans center their life upon; indeed, Young Goodman Brown&#x27;s world shatters when he realizes that what appears to be &quot;lives of righteousness&quot; are actually tainted by atrocious sin. Overall, the shadowy figure and the aura of the final demon meeting can imply an interpretation that perfection is simply a myth, and those in pursuit of it do so out of naivety of reality.

==Literary significance and reception==
Herman Melville said &quot;Young Goodman Brown&quot; was &quot;as deep as Dante&quot; and Henry James called it a &quot;magnificent little romance&quot;. Hawthorne himself believed the story made no more impact than any of his tales. Years later he wrote, &quot;These stories were published... in Magazines and Annuals, extending over a period of ten or twelve years, and comprising the whole of the writer&#x27;s young manhood, without making (so far as he has ever been aware) the slightest impression on the public&quot;. Contemporary critic Edgar Allan Poe disagreed, referring to Hawthorne&#x27;s short stories as &quot;the products of a truly imaginative intellect&quot;.

Stephen King has referred to &quot;Young Goodman Brown&quot; as &quot;one of the ten best stories written by an American&quot;. He calls it his favorite story by Hawthorne and cites it as an inspiration for his O. Henry Award-winning short story &quot;The Man in the Black Suit&quot;.

==Adaptations==
A 1972 short film directed by Donald Fox is based on the story. It features actors Mark Bramhall, Peter Kilman, and Maggie McOmie.

In 1982, the story was adapted for the CBC radio program &quot;Nightfall&quot;.

This is the only work of Hawthorne&#x27;s included in the Library of America&#x27;s 2009 anthology &quot;American Fantastic Tales: Terror and the Uncanny from Poe to the Pulps.&quot;

In 2011, playwright Lucas (Luke) Krueger, adapted the story for the stage. It was produced by Northern Illinois University. In 2012, Playscripts Inc. published the play. It has since been produced by several companies and high schools.

The 2015 music video for the Brandon Flowers song &quot;Can&#x27;t Deny My Love&quot; is based on Hawthorne&#x27;s story, with Flowers starring as the Goodman Brown figure and Evan Rachel Wood as his wife.

Comic artist Kate Beaton satirized the story in a series of comic strips for her webcomic &quot;Hark! A Vagrant&quot;, which focuses on mocking Goodman Brown&#x27;s obsessive, black-and-white morality and his hypocrisy toward his wife and friends.

<text>Dinard (; , ; Gallo: &quot;Dinard&quot;) is a commune in the Ille-et-Vilaine department, Brittany, northwestern France.

Dinard is on the Côte d&#x27;Émeraude of Brittany. Its beaches and mild climate make it a holiday destination, and this has resulted in the town having a variety of famous visitors and residents. The towns of Pleurtuit and Saint-Malo are nearby and the Dinard–Pleurtuit–Saint-Malo Airport is about 4 km south of Dinard.

With its international film festival, villas, sumptuous hotels and casino, Dinard is regarded as one of the most prestigious seaside resorts in all of France.

The official name of the town was successively Saint-Énogat (until 1879), Dinard-Saint-Énogat (from 1879 to 1921) and Dinard (since 1921). Today, moreover, Saint-Énogat is still a district belonging to the city, it is close to the sea and is home to many small shops.

The city also has a football club called FCD (Football Club Dinardais), which includes categories from U6 to Senior, the club is well helped by the town hall and the city of Dinard which helps with equipment, transport, grounds, and also the organization of the club.

The city also hosts the Jumping Internationnale in show jumping every year.

== History ==
In modern history Dinard was first settled by Saint-Malo&#x27;s shipping merchants, who built some of the town&#x27;s larger houses, very few of which survive. In the late 19th century, American and British aristocrats made Dinard a fashionable summer resort, and they built stunning villas on the cliff tops and exclusive hotels such as the &#x27;Le Grand Hotel&#x27; on the seafront during the French &quot;Belle Époque&quot;.

The name Dinard comes from the words &quot;Din&quot; (&quot;hill&quot;/&quot;fort&quot;) and &quot;Ard/Art&quot; (&quot;fortified&quot;). It has been claimed, probably erroneously, that the second element means &quot;bear&quot;/&quot;Arthur&quot;); the bear in Celtic mythology is a symbol of sovereignship. The town council is in the process of removing the bear from the municipal flag, a decision disputed by the former mayor.

Originally, Dinard was part of the parish of Saint-Énogat. In the late 19th century, the resort became popular with wealthy British nationals who built villas on the coast. Dinard rapidly expanded. It started declining in the 1930s when the fashionable social set started preferring the Côte d&#x27;Azur. Today, Dinard is considered one of the most &quot;British&quot; of coastal resorts in France. It has, however, retained its French charm. There are 407 listed villas.

The official name of the town was Saint-Énogat until 1879 when the name was changed to Dinard-Saint-Énogat. The name was changed once more in 1921 to become simply Dinard. Saint-Énogat is now just the name for the western area of the town.

The town was liberated by American forces in August 1944 during the Battle of Saint-Malo.

==Population==
Inhabitants of Dinard are called &quot;Dinardais&quot; in French.

== Climate ==
Dinard lies on the Gulf Stream which means it enjoys a warm climate, several degrees warmer than the surrounding areas. The Yacht club has fine examples of tropical palms and plants, which stretch round the coast on the Promenade du Clair de Lune.

== Hotels ==

The most exclusive hotels are the Grand Hôtel Barrière (5-star) which overlooks the Rance Estuary, and Castelbrac (5-star), the former Villa &quot;Bric à Brac&quot;. Other notable hotels are the Royal, which sits next to the Casino above the main Esplanade, and the Hotel de la Reine Hortense, with a direct view on the Ecluse beach and Saint Malo. Further round the coast in the Saint-Énogat area of Dinard is the Thalassa Dinard and Villas de La Falaise. This exclusive seawater therapy centre is one of only a few throughout Europe. The architecture of this building is sympathetic with the coastline, and from some angles becomes at one with the cliffside.

In the summer, the population swells to over 40,000 with the influx of holiday makers.

== Visitors ==
Dinard&#x27;s reputation as the &quot;Cannes of the North&quot; has attracted a wide variety of stars. Joan Collins is a frequent visitor, and Winston Churchill enjoyed holidaying on the River Rance. T. E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) lived in Dinard as a small child, long before his Arabian exploits, and Picasso painted here in the 1920s. Debussy is supposed to have had the idea for &quot;La Mer&quot; during a visit to Saint-Énogat in 1902. In 1996 Éric Rohmer filmed parts of Conte d&#x27;été in Dinard. Oscar Wilde also visited the place and mentions it in his De Profundis. Welsh singer-songwriter Iwan Rheon&#x27;s first studio album is named Dinard after the commune.

The Wales national football team used Dinard as its base during UEFA Euro 2016.

== Attractions ==
Dinard cannot boast much nightlife, but many bars and fine restaurants fill the town&#x27;s streets. The abundance of beaches coupled with a consistently sunny weather, however, attracts many visitors during the summer holidays. The attractions include a casino with a restaurant facing the sea and a hall which hosts many expositions. The nearby towns of Saint-Briac-sur-Mer and Saint-Lunaire also feature respectively a fairly large golf course and the beach of Longchamp, renowned as a &quot;surfers&#x27; spot&quot;.

Dinard holds every year a Festival of British Cinema in the first days of October.

Founded in 1989 by Thierry de la Fournière, the British Film Festival introduces professionals and film lovers to the richness of a dynamic and original production. The British Dinard Film Festival and the British film production have experienced a parallel progression. While the number of films produced in Great Britain doubled in the early 1990s, the Festival saw its reputation and attendance grow. From the social chronicle to the crazy comedy, English cinema is of great vigour. True to its original spirit, the Dinard Festival has become an important vector for all films wishing to conquer the European market. The event also allows the many distributors present to discover films that can find a network of rooms after the festival. Many film stars are also present during this festival. In 2023 José Garcia was part of the jury.
== Educational facilities ==
Many educational facilities may be found in Dinard, most of them elementary and primary schools, though there are two secondary schools. The most popular, the &quot;Collège Le Bocage&quot;, is a state school (the other being private) and has an estimated 700 pupils from Dinard and its vicinity. From there onward, children go to &quot;lycée&quot;, the closest being the &quot;Lycée Jacques Cartier&quot; in Saint-Malo.

== Beaches ==
The town has several beaches, all of which are sandy, clean and large. The main beach is Plage de l&#x27;Écluse and the second largest are Saint-Énogat and Prieuré beaches.
Dinard also has other little beaches near the city center, which offer another view of Dinard. They are all reachable by a path along the sea, called « le chemin de ronde»

== International relations ==
Dinard is twinned with:
* Newquay, United Kingdom (since 1986)
* Starnberg, Germany (since 1977)

== Notable residents ==
*Captain Philippe Koenigswerther, French Resistance fighter, , executed by the Nazis, born in Dinard in 1918,
*Virginia d&#x27;Albert-Lake, French Resistance fighter
*Robert W. Service – Scottish poet and writer of the Klondike Gold Rush spent winter seasons in Dinard from 1913 until 1929.

<doc id="929844" wikidata="Q704954" url="?curid=929844" title="Leo Baeck">
<text>Leo Baeck (; 23 May 1873 – 2 November 1956) was a 20th-century German rabbi, scholar, and theologian. He served as leader of Reform Judaism in his native country and internationally, and later represented all German Jews during the Nazi era. After the Second World War, he settled in London, in the United Kingdom, where he served as the chairman of the World Union for Progressive Judaism. In 1955, the Leo Baeck Institute for the study of the history and culture of German-speaking Jewry was established, and Baeck was its first international president. The Leo Baeck Medal has been awarded since 1978 to those who have helped preserve the spirit of German-speaking Jewry in culture, academia, politics, and philanthropy.

== Early years ==
Baeck was born in Lissa (Leszno) (then in the German Province of Posen, now in Poland), the son of Rabbi Samuel Baeck and his wife Eva (née Placzek). He began his education at the Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau in 1894. He also studied philosophy in Berlin with Wilhelm Dilthey. He served as a rabbi in Oppeln (now Opole), Düsseldorf, and Berlin. He also taught at the Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums (Higher Institute for Jewish Studies). 

In 1905 Baeck published &quot;The Essence of Judaism&quot;, in response to Adolf von Harnack&#x27;s &quot;What is Christianity?&quot;. This book, which interpreted and valorized Judaism through a prism of neo-Kantianism tempered with religious existentialism, made him a famous proponent for the Jewish people and their faith. During World War I, Baeck served as a chaplain in the German Imperial Army.

== Nazi persecution and deportation ==

In 1933, after the Nazis took power, Baeck worked to defend the Jewish community as president of the Reichsvertretung der Deutschen Juden, an umbrella organization that united German Jewry from 1933 to 1938. After the Reichsvertretung was disbanded during &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; in 1938, the Nazis reassembled the council&#x27;s members under the government controlled Reichsvereinigung. Baeck headed this organization as its president until his deportation. On 27 January 1943, he was deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp.

Baeck became the &quot;honorary head&quot; of the Council of Elders (&quot;Judenrat&quot;) in Theresienstadt. As such, he was protected from transports and with his protection list, could also save his relatives from transports, among others his grand-niece Ruth (b. 1925). Moreover, Baeck became &quot;prominent&quot;, which meant that he had better accommodation, better food and could receive mail more often.

Hannah Arendt in her 1963 book &quot;Eichmann in Jerusalem&quot; examined Jewish cooperation with the Nazi authorities during the Holocaust, and names Baeck as one of those functionaries who withheld the truth from their communities of the end awaiting them, believing it more &quot;humane&quot; to bear the secret since &quot;living in the expectation of death by gassing would only be the harder&quot;. Baeck, according to Arendt, also thought the existence of a Jewish police force within the camps would render the &quot;ordeal easier&quot; whereas in her view they turned out to be more brutal. Auschwitz escapee Siegfried Lederer testified to Baeck about the death camp, but Baeck believed that revealing the truth to the Theresienstadt prisoners could cause &quot;catastrophe&quot;.

He gave lectures, was active in the interfaith dialogue between traditional Jews and Christians of Jewish origin, worked in the youth care sector, which he directed from November 1944 on, and was friendly with many of the functionaries. After liberation, he headed the Council of Elders; the last Elder of the Jews was the Czech communist Jiří Vogel. Baeck&#x27;s lectures were credited with helping prisoners survive their confinement. Heinrich F. Liebrecht said Baeck&#x27;s lectures helped him to discover wellsprings of strength and the conviction that his life had a purpose. &quot;From here came the impulse to really endure, and the belief that we were able to do so.&quot;

Up until his deportation, numerous American institutions offered to help him escape the war and immigrate to the United States. Baeck refused to abandon his community and declined the offers. Nevertheless, he managed to survive the Holocaust, though three of his sisters perished in the ghetto.

== Post-war life and work ==
After the war, Baeck relocated to London, where he accepted the Presidency of the North Western Reform Synagogue in Temple Fortune. He taught at Hebrew Union College in the United States, and eventually became Chairman of the World Union for Progressive Judaism. It was during this time he published his second major work, &quot;This People Israel&quot;, which he partially penned during his imprisonment by the Nazis. His increased interfaith work also meant that he revised and, to an extent, reclaimed for Judaism, the founding figures of Christianity, Jesus and Paul.

He died on 2 November 1956, in London, England.

==The International Leo Baeck Institute==
In 1955, the Leo Baeck Institute for the study of the history and culture of German-speaking Jewry was established, and Baeck was the first international president of this institute. The Institute now includes branches around the world including the Leo Baeck Institute New York, and the Leo Baeck Institute London. 

There are institutions named after Leo Baeck, on every inhabited continent, including the Leo Baeck Centre for Progressive Judaism in Melbourne, Australia.

The asteroid 100047 Leobaeck is named in his honour, as is Leo Baeck College, the Reform/Progressive rabbinical college in London.

<doc id="929857" wikidata="Q7974095" url="?curid=929857" title="Waterfront Streetcar">
<text>The Waterfront Streetcar, officially the George Benson Waterfront Streetcar Line, was a heritage streetcar line run by King County Metro in Seattle, Washington, United States. It traveled for along Alaskan Way on the city&#x27;s waterfront facing Elliott Bay, under the Alaskan Way Viaduct. The Waterfront Streetcar used a fleet of five W2 trams from Melbourne, Australia.

Service began on May 29, 1982, the first streetcars to run in Seattle since the closure of the Seattle Municipal Street Railway on April 13, 1941. It initially terminated at Occidental Park in Pioneer Square until the line was extended to International District/Chinatown station in 1990. Service was officially suspended on November 18, 2005, when the maintenance barn and Broad Street station were demolished to make room for the Seattle Art Museum&#x27;s Olympic Sculpture Park. A large portion of the trackage and four stations were demolished in 2012 as part of the reconstruction of Alaskan Way.

Streetcar service was replaced by King County Metro Route 99, which operated along Alaskan Way until February 2011 when construction forced Metro to reroute the line to 1st Avenue. King County Metro announced in January 2016 that a private venture would launch a fundraising effort to retrofit two of the historic Waterfront Streetcar vehicles to run alongside modern Seattle Streetcar vehicles on the Center City Connector along 1st Avenue.

==History==

The original city streetcar system in Seattle ceased operations in April 1941 and was replaced with a network of electric trolleybuses and motor buses. City councilman George Benson first proposed the idea of building a streetcar line along the Seattle waterfront in 1974, a year after he was elected to the council, to be operational in time for the national Bicentennial on July 4, 1976. The line would use vintage streetcars, and the goal was to create an attraction that would bring tourists and local residents to the waterfront, to help rejuvenate the area, which had already begun a slow transition from a purely industrial district to one with shops and cultural attractions such as the (then-planned, later built) Seattle Aquarium. Eventually, the proposal garnered enough support from the public and Benson&#x27;s fellow council members that funds were allocated for an engineering and design study, ultimately leading to the approval of the project.

The line used previously existing freight railroad tracks adjacent to Alaskan Way, and construction for the streetcar project involved adding overhead trolley wires, high-platform stations, and a passing track near the middle of the line, which otherwise was single-track. The line started just north of Broad Street, near Pier 70, and until 1990 ran only as far south as Main Street, terminating at a station next to Alaskan Way, immediately south of Main.

Service began on May 29, 1982, which was the first streetcar run in Seattle since April 13, 1941. The first three streetcars had been brought to Seattle from Melbourne, Australia, by Councilman Benson in 1978. They had been Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Tramways Board cars 482, 512 and 518, and they kept those numbers in Seattle. Two more Melbourne streetcars were acquired between 1990 and 1993. All were W2-class trams that had originally been built between 1925 and 1930.

In 1989, construction began on a quarter-mile extension of the streetcar along Main Street and 5th Avenue to Jackson Street, to connect to the International District/Chinatown Station of the then-new Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel. The extension opened for regular service on June 23, 1990. The line&#x27;s fourth ex-Melbourne streetcar, No. 272, entered service earlier that month. A fifth car of the same type, No. 605, entered service on June 1, 1993. On June 1, 2002, the King County Council approved legislation to rename the line in honor of councilmember Benson, christening it the &quot;George Benson Waterfront Streetcar Line&quot;. The streetcar stations were rebranded and repainted in August 2003.

===Cancellation of service===
The streetcar ceased operation on November 18, 2005, when the maintenance barn was demolished to make room for the Seattle Art Museum&#x27;s Olympic Sculpture Park. A new maintenance barn was proposed to be built at Occidental Park to allow the resumption of operations as early as summer 2007. However, Metro cancelled involvement after delays made the new facility unlikely to be completed before the demolition of the Alaskan Way Viaduct began. An alternative proposal by the Port of Seattle was to extend the line northward along Myrtle Edwards Park to Smith Cove, where a new maintenance barn would be built on Port property. This proposal was not pursued.

In 2007, two years into the suspension of service, the route was named by National Geographic Society as one of the 10 Great Streetcar routes.

In spring 2012, a large portion of the trackage and the stations at Pike, University, Madison and Washington streets were demolished in as a part of the construction project drilling a deep bore tunnel to replace the Alaskan Way Viaduct.

The City of Seattle began studying the possibility of bringing streetcars back to the city center in late 2012. The locally preferred alternative for this project adopted in late 2014 supported a route along 1st Avenue and not Alaskan Way. James Corner Field Operations, the Manhattan-based landscape-architecture firm hired to recommend a new vision for the Seattle waterfront once the Viaduct has been demolished, also recommended the Streetcar not be returned to Alaskan Way, but to nearby First Avenue instead.

While future plans for the line were determined, the streetcars were stored in an old warehouse in SoDo for more than a decade. In 2015, the Federal Transit Administration informed King County that if the streetcars are not put back in service soon, Metro would need to pay $205,000 to compensate the agency for its remaining investment in the cars. At the same time, the warehouse used to store the streetcars was in poor condition and the land needed for expansion of a neighboring bus base.

In January 2016, it was announced that a private venture, Friends of the Benson Trolleys, was intending to raise the money required to retrofit two of the streetcars to allow them to be used on the future Center City Connector on 1st Avenue. The plan closely mirrors one suggested in May 2009 by then Seattle Mayor, Greg Nickels. The remaining three cars were sold by King County to St. Louis, for use on their heritage Delmar Loop Trolley, for which they will need several modifications before they can be used. Only one car has been retrofitted (by Gomaco) for service in St. Louis; the other two remain in storage for possible future use. The specific cars sold to St. Louis were Nos. 482, 512, and 518, and they left Seattle in early June 2016. The streetcars retained by King County Metro are Nos. 272 and 605 (along with 525, which never entered service, and has been kept only as a source of parts). Because the warehouse in which they had been stored since the end of Waterfront Streetcar service in 2005 was due to be torn down, to make way for expansion of a Metro bus garage, the streetcars were moved out in early June 2016, to a private site in Arlington, Washington, where they will be stored indefinitely, awaiting possible future developments in the proposals for their return to service.

==Route==

The line began at the Broad Street maintenance barn and mostly ran along the east side of Alaskan Way on Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway trackage under the Alaskan Way Viaduct. Its southernmost section in Pioneer Square consisted of an east–west track on South Main Street that passed Occidental Square and turned south onto 5th Avenue South. It terminated at South Jackson Street, across the street from International District station in the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel.

===Stations===

All of the stations (with the exception of the Occidental Park and Jackson Street stations) along the Alaskan Way were originally painted brown when the line first opened. In 2004, all of these stations were refurbished and repainted in Marine Blue. The Occidental and Jackson stations were designed to reflect the surrounding architecture along the streets when the line was extended in 1990. The Jackson Street stop featured an Asian Pagoda-style station while Occidental park had a vintage-style station.

==Service and operations==

Prior to its discontinuation in 2005, the Waterfront Streetcar line ran at a frequency of 20 minutes from 6:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. on weekdays, and 10:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. on weekends. The streetcar was located entirely within Metro&#x27;s Free Ride Area, but charged a normal fare paid with cash or a valid bus transfer or pass.

The fleet of streetcar vehicles had wooden bench seating for 43 passengers and standing room for 40. The high platforms at stations allowed for level boarding, and the vehicles had room for wheelchairs and other mobility devices. The streetcar line was labeled as Route 99, which also applied to its replacement bus route. In 2004, its final year of full operations, the streetcar line carried 403,600 passengers.

<doc id="929870" wikidata="Q4918129" url="?curid=929870" title="Bishop–Gromov inequality">
<text>In mathematics, the Bishop–Gromov inequality is a comparison theorem in Riemannian geometry, named after Richard L. Bishop and Mikhail Gromov. It is closely related to Myers&#x27; theorem, and is the key point in the proof of Gromov&#x27;s compactness theorem.

==Statement==
Let formula_1 be a complete &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Riemannian manifold whose Ricci curvature satisfies the lower bound

: formula_2

for a constant formula_3. Let formula_4 be the complete &quot;n&quot;-dimensional simply connected space of constant sectional curvature formula_5 (and hence of constant Ricci curvature formula_6); thus formula_4 is the &quot;n&quot;-sphere of radius formula_8 if formula_9, or &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space if formula_10, or an appropriately rescaled version of &quot;n&quot;-dimensional hyperbolic space if formula_11. Denote by formula_12 the ball of radius &quot;r&quot; around a point &quot;p&quot;, defined with respect to the Riemannian distance function.

Then, for any formula_13 and formula_14, the function

: formula_15

is non-increasing on formula_16.

As &quot;r&quot; goes to zero, the ratio approaches one, so together with the monotonicity this implies that
: formula_17
This is the version first proved by Bishop.

<doc id="929878" wikidata="Q142724" url="?curid=929878" title="Kenya at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Kenya competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s eleventh appearance at the Olympics, except the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow because of the African and United States boycott.

National Olympic Committee Kenya (NOCK) sent the nation&#x27;s smallest delegation to the Games since the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. A total of 46 athletes, 22 men and 24 women, competed only in athletics (specifically in the middle-distance events and marathon), rowing, swimming, and volleyball, the nation&#x27;s team-based sport at these games. For the first time in its Olympic history, Kenya was represented by more female than male athletes due to the participation of the women&#x27;s volleyball team. The Kenyan team featured Olympic medalists Paul Tergat in men&#x27;s marathon, and Bernard Lagat, who would emigrate to America a year later, in the men&#x27;s middle-distance running. Among these medalists, Lagat only managed to add a bronze medal to his career hardware for the Kenyan team at these Games before his impending transfer. Volleyball team captain Violet Barasa became the nation&#x27;s first ever female flag bearer in the opening ceremony.

Kenya left Athens with a total of seven Olympic medals (one gold, four silver, and two bronze), matching its record with Sydney four years earlier. Ezekiel Kemboi managed to capture the nation&#x27;s only gold medal in the men&#x27;s 3000 m steeplechase, and enjoyed his teammates Brimin Kipruto and Paul Kipsiele Koech taking home the silver and bronze, as they all climbed on top of the podium for the second time in Kenya&#x27;s Olympic history since 1992.

<text>DDB Worldwide Communications Group LLC, known internationally as DDB, is a worldwide marketing communications network. It is owned by Omnicom Group, one of the world&#x27;s largest advertising holding companies. The international advertising networks Doyle Dane Bernbach and Needham Harper merged their worldwide agency operations to become DDB Needham in 1986. At that same time the owners of Doyle Dane Bernbach, Needham Harper and BBDO merged their shareholdings to form the US listed holding company Omnicom. In 1996, DDB Needham became known as DDB Worldwide.

== History ==
=== Doyle Dane Bernbach ===
Bill Bernbach and Ned Doyle worked together at Grey Advertising in New York, where Bernbach was Creative Director. In 1949, they teamed up with Mac Dane, who was running a tiny agency. Together they started &quot;Doyle Dane Bernbach&quot; in Manhattan. Dane ran the administrative and promotional aspects of the business, Doyle had a client focus, and Bernbach played an integral role in the writing of advertising, leading the creative output of the agency.

The agency&#x27;s first ads were for Ohrbach&#x27;s department store exemplifying a new &quot;soft-sell&quot; approach to advertising - with catchy slogans and witty humour contrasting the repetitive and hard-sell style in vogue until then. The new agency was initially successful in winning business for clients with small budgets. Their campaigns for Volkswagen throughout the 1950s and 1960s were said to have revolutionized advertising. Notable campaigns included the 1959 &quot;Think Small&quot; series of Volkswagen advertisements, which was voted the No. 1 campaign of all time in Advertising Age&#x27;s 1999 &quot;The Century of Advertising.&quot; In 1959, the firm created the character Juan Valdez for the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia. In 1960, the agency won the account of Avis, then the number-two auto rental company. The tongue-in-cheek approach, &quot;We Try Harder Because We&#x27;re Number 2,&quot; was a major success (and remains part of the company&#x27;s slogan today: &quot;We Try Harder&quot;). The DDB &quot;Daisy&quot; campaign is considered to have been a significant factor in Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s defeat of Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election and landed Mac Dane on the infamous Nixon&#x27;s Enemies List. 1972&#x27;s Little Mikey commercial for Quaker Oats ran continuously in the United States for twelve years.

A branch office was opened in Los Angeles in 1954. In 1961, DDB opened its first international office in West Germany to service Volkswagen. Significant growth came in the mid-1960s after the firm signed Mobil and the available budgets grew materially. Offices in London and other European locations were opened. Bernbach was appointed chairman and chief executive officer in 1968 when the agency was publicly listed; he became chairman of the executive committee in 1976.

The impact of Doyle Dane Bernbach&#x27;s creativity on advertising around the world, and the history of management crises that led to merger in 1986, are detailed in the book &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Perfect: Bill Bernbach and the Golden Age of Advertising&quot;. Written by journalist Doris Willens, who was DDB&#x27;s Director of Public Relations for 18 years, the book is based on oral histories and interviews with the three founders, the line of the agency&#x27;s presidents, and key creative and account people. By 1986, four years after Bernbach&#x27;s death, the agency group had worldwide billings of US$1.67B, 54 offices in 19 countries, and 3,400 employees, but showed profits declining 30% on the prior year.

=== Needham Harper &amp; Steers ===
Needham Harper Worldwide started in Chicago in 1925 as Maurice H. Needham Co. with two clients and billings totalling $270,000. By 1934, it was named Needham, Louis and Brorby, Inc., with billings of US$1 million, had signed the Kraft Foods account and had opened a Hollywood office to service its clients&#x27; network radio program production needs.

In 1951, the agency opened a New York office to concentrate on the rapidly expanding television industry. That office merged with Doherty, Clifford, Steers and Shenfield in 1965 and changed its name to Needham, Harper &amp; Steers. The Chicago office grew with accounts such as the Morton Company, Household Finance Corporation, General Mills and Frigidaire. The firm won the Oklahoma gasoline account (later Esso, then ExxonMobil) after research indicated that American drivers wanted both &quot;power&quot; and &quot;play&quot;, and copywriter Sandy Sulcer, working with psychologist Ernest Dichter, chose the tiger to symbolize that desire, which led to the campaign &quot;Put a Tiger in Your Tank&quot;. In 1966, the agency opened a Los Angeles office to handle the Continental Airlines business. An office was opened in Washington D.C. in 1971 initially to service some local McDonald&#x27;s business. Soon, this agency was winning government and media business and an &quot;Issues and Images&quot; division was opened to service corporate public relations. This business would eventually become Biederman &amp; Company. The agency worked on public service campaigns called &quot;Buckle Up for Safety&quot; as well as a traffic safety campaign entitled &quot;Watch Out For The Other Guy&quot; for the Advertising Council.

Keith L. Reinhard came from Chicago to head the worldwide firm in 1982 and, by 1986, there were thirty two offices outside the US; American offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington, Boston, Phoenix, Sacramento, San Diego, Baltimore and Dayton; and diversification in Porter Novelli, Biederman &amp; Company and the international direct-response agency DR Group, Inc.

===Establishment of DDB Worldwide (1982–2006)===
Upon Bernbach&#x27;s death in 1982, the firm&#x27;s earnings fell to $1.7 million with some clients and top talent leaving. It had worldwide billings of $1.67 billion with 54 offices in 19 countries and 3,400 employees by 1986.

The trend of hostile takeovers of public companies during the 1980s caused the firm to merge its worldwide operations with Chicago-based Needham Harper to become DDB Needham. That same year, the owners of Doyle Dane Bernbach, Needham Harper and BBDO agreed to merge their shareholdings to form the Omnicom Group as a United States-listed holding company, becoming the world&#x27;s largest global advertising agency group at the time. It is referred to as the &quot;Big-Bang&quot; merger in direct response to competitive threats from other large advertising agency conglomerates. Keith L. Reinhard, who was previously at Needham Harper, became president and CEO of the merged DDB Needham. Reinhard reinvested in Bernbach&#x27;s writings about advertising and the agency shifted its methods to relevancy, originality and impact for clients. By 1987, the firm&#x27;s earnings were $358.5 million with $2.6 billion in billings.

DDB Needham executives were among the fatalities in a whitewater rafting accident along the Chilko River in British Columbia, Canada in 1987. Its United States president Al Wolfe had planned the whitewater rafting excursion. This was loosely portrayed in the film White_Mile.

By 1989, DDB Needham was the leading United States advertising agency in newspaper media billings. The firm started to guarantee the results of its advertising in 1990 which was questioned by the industry as compensation for campaigns was tied to clients meeting sales goals. It dropped from the third-largest to sixth-largest agency in the United States in 1993 with $229 million in earnings on $1.9 billion in billings. Billings grew in 1994 after the firm moved forward with a plan to centralize its media buying opening a branch called USA Media. DDB Canada opened in Vancouver in 1998 where Frank Palmer became its CEO after merging his own company Palmer Jarvis into DDB Worldwide. In 1999, DDB dropped Needham from its name on its fifty-year anniversary and became officially known as DDB Worldwide, a process that had started five years earlier. That same year, Reinhard became the firm&#x27;s chairman with Ken Kaess taking over as president, later becoming the global CEO from 2001 to 2006.

Since its foundation, DDB has been credited with staffing people of diverse ethnic backgrounds who found themselves unwelcome at other agencies. The firm hired Phyllis Robinson, the first female copywriter chief in United States history, amongst its initial team of 13. It uses a talent acquisition strategy known as &quot;no duplicates&quot; to look for professional, socio-economic and cultural diversity in employees to boost creativity.

=== Longstanding client relationships ===
Since Doyle Dane Bernbach commenced a US relationship with Volkswagen in 1959, it has been a consistent and significant client in various parts of the world. Needham Harper started working with McDonald&#x27;s in the 1960s and that client has worked with DDB in several countries unceasingly since then. A global relationship with ExxonMobil has been consistent since the 1960s. As of 2020, longstanding broad worldwide relationships continue to be held with Unilever and Johnson &amp; Johnson.

=== Leadership since 1986 ===

== Local office histories ==
=== London ===
At Omnicom&#x27;s 1986 foundation, the merging Needham and Doyle Dane Bernbach operation each had London offices, with the latter having been established in 1963. Reinhard made six trips to London, fired most of the Needham managers, and put DDB managers in charge. By 1989, the operation was struggling and Omnicom acquired Boase Massimi Pollitt to consume the DDB operation and renamed it as BMP DDB. It operated under that name until January 2004 when it was changed to DDB London, in line with the network&#x27;s decision to rebrand all agencies it had acquired. The agency struggled during 2006 with management problems and a string of account defections. Stability was restored in 2007, but the agency seemed unable to restore its lost billings. It continued to tumble down the UK agency rankings, ending up outside the Top 20 for 2010. In 2012, Adam &amp; Eve DDB was created from the merger of DDB London with the fast-expanding independent Adam &amp; Eve.

=== Australia ===
In Australia in 2020, DDB operates from Sydney and Melbourne. Both offices trace their history to the post-war foundation of United Services Publicity in Melbourne in 1945 by ex-servicemen rebuilding their careers. Founder John F. Barnes and other staff had worked antebellum at Samson Clark Price-Berry which closed down during WWII. United Services Publicity grew and in 1961 established international links when the British SH Benson group bought 25%. It was renamed USP Benson and opened in Sydney. Needham, Harper &amp; Steers bought into USP Benson in 1967 and by 1971 had effected a name change to USP Needham. The 1986 creation of the Omnicom holding company saw the Australian merger of the Needham and Doyle Dane Bernbach operations and becoming known as DDB Needham in 1986, DDB Worldwide from 1998 then in 2019 back to Doyle Dane Bernbach.

Australian agencies acquired at some point by USP Needham or DDB and which trace a lineage to DDB Australia today include the Sydney agencies SPASM; Bartlett, Murphy and McKenzie; Harriman and Hill; Beeby Advertising; Magnus, Nankervis &amp; Curl; and the Melbourne agencies Berry Currie; Hyde Everett Fuller Kutt; Leonardi &amp; Curtis; Walker Herbert &amp; Associates; Nowland, Robinson &amp; Perret; Kuczynski &amp; Zeigler; Whybin Dery Barnes.

=== Stockholm ===
DDB Stockholm is one of the largest agencies in Sweden, with high-profile clients such as the Swedish Armed Forces, McDonald&#x27;s, Telia, Volkswagen and Vattenfall.

=== Philippines ===
In 1958, the forerunner of DDB Group Philippines, the Advertising Marketing Associates (AMA) was formed by Antonio de Joya. The AMA became one of the leading advertising agencies of the Philippines before it became DDB Group Philippines in 1993. Today, DDB Group Philippines is operating in five different cities with at least 300 employees.

In July 2023, DDB Philippines publicly apologized to the Department of Tourism (DOT) for using non-original stock footage of travel destinations in other countries for the campaign&#x27;s promotional video. The DOT hired DDB Philippines for its latest tourism branding campaign. However, after the public apology, the DOT is now in the process of terminating the contract with DDB Philippines.

==Recognition==
In 1998, DDB Worldwide was named &quot;Ad Age&#x27;s&quot; first-ever &quot;Global Network of the Year&quot; which it also won in 2003. Its &quot;Think Small&quot; series of Volkswagen advertisements was voted the number one campaign of all time in Advertising Age&#x27;s 1999 &quot;The Century of Advertising.&quot; 

Under the leadership of Kaess, Bob Scarpelli and Lee Garfinkel, it won &quot;Global Network of the Year&quot; from &quot;Adweek&quot; in 2003 and 2004. Subsequently, its operating unit Tribal DDB became the first digital agency to be named &quot;Global Network of the Year&quot; by &quot;Ad Age&quot;.

DDB Worldwide was recognized as &quot;Network of the Year&quot; at the 2023 Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. It was the first time the firm had received the award. The firm also received &quot;Most Effective Agency Network&quot; for 2023 at the Effie Awards. Design and Art Direction (D&amp;AD) recognized adam&amp;eveDDB with &quot;Agency of the Year&quot; and DDB Worldwide as &quot;Network of the Year&quot; in 2023.

<text>River monitors are military craft designed to patrol rivers.
They are normally the largest of all riverine warships in river flotillas, and mount the heaviest weapons. The name originated from the US Navy&#x27;s , which made her first appearance in the American Civil War, and being distinguished by the use of revolving gun turrets, which were particularly useful in rivers, whose narrow channels could severely limit the directions vessels could face.

River monitors were used on inland waterways such as rivers, estuaries, deltas and lakes. Usually they had a shallow draft which was necessary for them to be able to operate in enclosed waters; but their displacement, size and draft varied depending on where they were used.

Most river monitors were lightly armored although this varied, with some carrying more armor. Exceptional examples, however, most notably the Royal Navy&#x27;s s, which could operate in coastal or certain riparian/estuarine situations, bore extra-thick armor plating and heavy shore-bombardment guns, up to a massive 18 inches (457 mm) in size. Typically, however, river monitors displayed a mixture of gun sizes from 3-inch (75 mm) to 6-inch (152 mm), plus machine guns. This type of vessel overlaps with the river gunboat that would be armed with relatively small caliber cannons, or a mix of cannons and machine guns.

==United States==

River monitors were used during the American Civil War, playing an important role in the Mississippi River Campaigns. 
They also played a role in the Battle of Mobile Bay. The American Civil War river monitors were very large, weighing up to 1,300 tons.

On 18 December 1965, the US Navy, for the second time in one hundred years, authorized the reactivation of a brown-water navy for riparian operations in South Vietnam. In July 1966, Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara authorized the formation of a Mobile Riverine Force (MRF); a force that would bring back the river monitor.
The US Navy operated its Monitors as part of their River Assault Flotilla One, which initially consisted of four River Assault Divisions (RAD); with RAD 91 containing three monitors, RAD 92 having two monitors, RAD 111 having three monitors, and RAD 112 operating two monitors.

The Vietnam monitors were divided into two programs; program 4 would consist of the 40 mm gun monitors, while the later program 5 would entail the eight Monitor (H) Howitzer versions, and the six Monitor (F) Flamethrower models. All of the monitors were converted from World War II long Landing Craft Mechanized (LCMs) Mk 6s. When completed, they were long, wide, with a draft of , had two screws driven by two Gray Marine model 64NH9 diesel engines, could do and were manned by usually 11 or more crewmen. They usually carried about ten tons of armor.

==Asia==
On Asian rivers, the Amur Military Flotilla on the Amur used large &quot;Taifun&quot;-class river monitors of the Imperial Russian Navy from around 1907; the Imperial Japanese Navy captured some of these ships in 1918. They were up to 1,000 tons displacement, armed with 130 mm guns. Some of these Russian monitors, such as the recommissioned &quot;Sverdlov&quot;, were still in use by the Soviet Navy in the 1945 Soviet invasion of Manchuria. The most powerful and largest riverine vessels were three Khasan-class monitors from 1940s, with 2,400 ton full displacement and limited seagoing capabilities.

During the Vietnam War, the United States Navy, in conjunction with other riverine craft, commissioned 24 monitors, ten of which mounted a single 40 mm cannon in a Mk 52 turret, eight which mounted an M49 105 mm howitzer within a T172 turret, and six monitors which mounted two M10-8 flamethrowers from two M8 turrets located on either side of the vessel&#x27;s 40 mm cannon. Referred to as &quot;river battleships&quot; by their crews, they provided the firepower of the brown-water navy.

==Europe==

On the Danube, river monitors were employed during World War I by Austria-Hungary and Romania. The Austro-Hungarian river monitor &quot;Bodrog&quot; fired the first shots of World War I, against the city of Belgrade, and later also fought in the Romanian Campaign, notably during the Flămânda Offensive in October 1916, when she was damaged. Another river monitor, &quot;Körös&quot;, was also heavily damaged by Romanian artillery, taking 12 hits and ran aground after her steam lines were severed. On 22 September 1917, the &quot;Enns&quot;-class river monitor &quot;Inn&quot; was sunk by a Romanian mine near Brăila. She was refloated but her repairs were not completed before the War ended, and she was eventually handed over to Romania as war reparation, being renamed &quot;Basarabia&quot;.

During World War I, the Romanian were the largest river monitors on the Danube, displacing 680 tons, armed mainly with three 120 mm guns and protected by at least 70 mm of armor around the belt, turrets and conning tower. They were built in sections at Triest in Austria-Hungary, transported to Romania by rail and assembled by the Romanians at the Galați shipyard in 1907–1908. They did not engage enemy ships, however, instead they were used to support ground forces during the Battle of Turtucaia and the First Battle of Cobadin, and also took part in the 1917 campaign, contributing to the stemming of the enemy advance. During the Interwar period, the Romanian Danube Flotilla was the most powerful riverine fleet in the world. In 1924, the Romanian river monitors helped suppress the Tatarbunary Uprising, along with the entire Romanian Danube Flotilla. In late 1980s and 1990s Romania commissioned newly built Smârdan-class river monitors (classified as large armoured boats), and three big Mihail Kogălniceanu-class river monitors, used still in the 21st century.
Czechoslovakia had one monitor, , of about 200 tons displacement. She was however classified as a patrol boat (&quot;hlídková loď&quot;). She was captured by the Germans in 1939 and commissioned as &quot;Bechelaren&quot;. She was extensively rebuilt in 1943 and her armament was also modified in February 1945. She supported German troops during Operation Spring Awakening and later fought in Austria, sinking two Soviet gunboats.

Yugoslav river monitors were former Austro-Hungarian warships received as reparations. They were renamed (ex-&quot;Bosna&quot;), (ex-&quot;Bodrog&quot;), (ex-&quot;Enns&quot;) and &quot;Morava&quot; (ex-&quot;Körös&quot;). After the fall of Yugoslavia in April 1941, &quot;Morava&quot; (renamed &quot;Bosna&quot;) and &quot;Sava&quot; were commissioned by the newly created Independent State of Croatia.

Six smaller monitors (70–100 ton displacement) were used by Poland in 1939 on shallow Pripyat River. Captured by the Soviet Union, they were used in 1941 by the Soviets on the Pripyat and Dnepr rivers, along with Soviet riverine ships. The Soviet Union also had five &quot;Zheleznyakov&quot;-class monitors of 263 tons, which served with the Danube Flotilla and Dnieper Flotilla in World War II.

Hungary also used river monitors, five of them notably taking part during the Kozara Offensive in 1942.

==South America==

The Brazilian river monitor was built for the navy in Rio de Janeiro and commissioned on 9 March 1938. She participated in the Second World War and is currently the world&#x27;s oldest commissioned warship still in active service. She is assigned to the Brazilian navy&#x27;s Mato Grosso Flotilla.

<doc id="929889" wikidata="Q1144475" url="?curid=929889" title="Ostankino Palace">
<text>Ostankino Palace is a former summer residence and private opera theatre of the Sheremetev family, originally situated several kilometres to the north of central Moscow. It is a part of the North-Eastern Administrative Okrug of the city. Extant historical grounds include the main wooden palace, built in 1792–1798 around a theatre hall, with adjacent Egyptian and Italian pavilions, a 17th-century Trinity church, and fragments of the old Ostankino park with a replica of &quot;Milovzor&quot; folly.
== History ==

=== 16th century to 1787 ===

The first documentary evidence of Ostankino—then known as Ostashkovo—dates to the middle of the 16th century, when Tsar Ivan IV of Russia granted these lands to the hold of Alexey Satin, relative of statesman Alexey Adashev. Satin, however, was executed by Ivan in 1560, and the lands passed to one Horn, a German mercenary, and, in 1585, to diak (statesman) Vasily Schelkalov. Under Schelkalov, the unpopulated lands of Ostashkovo developed into a manor estate with ponds and cedar park. 

This manor was destroyed by plunder and fire in the Time of Troubles. The end of hostilities and ascension of the House of Romanov brought the new owners: the princes Tcherkassky. They replanted the parks and established a hunting reserve, expanding east to Alekseyevskoye village.

In the first half of the 18th century Ostankino was gradually converted from a permanent country manor to a temporary retreat; empress Elizabeth of Russia paid a visit to Ostankino in 1742. The following year, through a marriage between princess Varvara, the sole heir of Tcherkassky fortunes, and Peter Sheremetev, son of field marshal Sheremetev, Ostankino passed to the Sheremetevs and remained their property until 1917.

=== Construction of the palace ===

In 1787 Nikolai Sheremetev inherited Ostankino upon the death of his father. Nikolai Sheremetev was a patron of theater. In the three following years Sheremetev established house theaters in Kuskovo, Kitai-gorod and Markovo. In 1790 he held an architectural contest for a &quot;Palace of Arts&quot; in Moscow, but eventually preferred to build it in the country, far from city life. Building a new large theater in Kuskovo would have ruined an already completed ensemble, so in the same 1790 Sheremetev finally chose Ostankino.
Sheremetev initially hired someone Casier (), a self-proclaimed architect employed by Golitsyn family. This project did not materialize; by 1792, Sheremetev built only a two-story wooden theater hall, apparently discarding Casier&#x27;s plans. Then, as Sheremetev recruited services of influential contemporary architects (most notably Francesco Camporesi, see Attribution dispute section), work accelerated and the wooden palace was structurally in its present shape, including pavilion wings, by the end of 1793. Contemporary witnesses reported that Sheremetev was so confident in perfection of his palace that he set up an unprecedented veil of secrecy around construction site: the manor was closed to any visitors, covered with shrouds, architects worked in parallel unaware of each other&#x27;s progress.

Interior works took another six years. Major work on the palace was completed by the end of 1798, while lesser decoration and landscaping projects continued until the end of Sheremetev&#x27;s life. 

=== Park ===

In 1761 Sheremetevs hired a garden manager, Johann Manstadt, who supervised expansion of the park and its conversion to a commercial enterprise.
Nikolai Sheremetev initially assigned landscaping to his serf architect, Mironov, but soon deemed Mironov&#x27;s plan inappropriate. The job passed to Pyotr Argunov, with consultancy by Francis Reid, manager of Tsaritsyno Park project. Reid and his associate, Nikolai Kuverin, worked in Ostankino in 1791–1794. A permanent garden manager, Robert Manners, was hired in 1796 and stayed in Ostankino for thirty years. Reid&#x27;s input apparently concentrated on the immediate vicinity of the palace; regular English garden north from the palace was planted in 1797 by Manners.

=== Two seasons of the theater ===

The theater opened in summer of 1795. Paul I, who ascended to the throne in November 1796, summoned Nikolai Sheremetev to Saint Petersburg. The theater operated publicly for just one season in spring 1797, with one show for emperor Paul and one for Stanisław Poniatowski, former king of partitioned Poland. In 1800 Sheremetev reduced the artistic company—barely sufficient for the private entertainment.

The 1802 death of Sheremetev&#x27;s wife, former actress Praskovya Kovaleva-Zhemchugova, spelled the end of the theater. Nikolai Sheremetev disbanded his theater company and abstained from public entertainment till the end of his life (1809). There were accounts of an 1801 show for Alexander I; however, modern scholars deem these reports incorrect: the show was planned but did not materialize.

=== 19th to 21st centuries ===
Sheremetev&#x27;s heirs barely maintained the palace; in the 1830s they demolished the old living quarters dating back to the 17th century, and demolished some of the free-standing service buildings.

Ostankino Park fell in neglect in the 1830s. In the second part of the 19th century parts of the park were sold to dacha developers and leased to farmers, while the greenhouses concentrated on commercial flower growing.

In the Soviet period the nationalized palace operated as a museum of serf art. In 1935 the eastern part of former Ostankino park grounds were allotted to the emerging Agricultural Exhibition and remodelled by 1939. Ostankino park proper shrunk to just one square kilometer as the lands further north became the State Botanical Garden.

Throughout the Soviet period the main theater hall was set up a single ballroom space. Partitions separating stage, orchestra pit and spectator areas were re-introduced during the controversial repairs of the 2000s, so the theater can once again be used in its original function.

== Attribution dispute ==

Nikolai Sheremetev managed construction himself, hiring architects at will; in addition to original architectural work, he reused drafts of Saint Petersburg architects. Contemporary academic studies agree on the fact that, while certain parts and details of the palace can be attributed to specific architects (with different degree of probability), the palace as a whole—even its basic layout—has no single author apart from Sheremetev himself.

Igor Grabar attributed design of the palace to Vasily Bazhenov; this viewpoint is discarded by modern studies as unsubstantiated.

<text>Sir George Radcliffe (1599 – May 1657) was an English lawyer and politician. He spent much of his political career in Ireland, where he was a key member of the firm and ruthless Strafford administration. He lived out his last years in exile in the Dutch Republic.

==Early career ==

Born the son of Nicholas Radcliffe (d. 1599) of Overthorpe, West Yorkshire and his wife Margaret Marsh, widow of John Bayley, Radcliffe was educated at Oldham and at University College, Oxford. As a student lawyer at Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1613, Radcliffe was asked to contribute to the costs of masques at the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Frederick V of the Palatinate.

He attained some measure of success as a barrister, and about 1626 became the confidential adviser of Sir Thomas Wentworth, afterwards Earl of Strafford, who was related to his wife, Anne Trappes (died 1659). Strafford was a man with a gift for making enemies, but Radcliffe remained his devoted friend for life. Strafford&#x27;s biographer notes that &quot;in all the crises of his life it was to Radcliffe that he opened his heart&quot;.

Like his master, he was imprisoned in 1627 for declining to contribute to a forced loan, but he shared the good, as well as the ill, fortunes of Wentworth, acting as his adviser when he was president of the Council of the North.

==In Ireland ==

When Wentworth was made Lord Deputy of Ireland, Radcliffe, in January 1633, preceded him to that country, and having been made a member of the Privy Council of Ireland he was trusted by the Deputy in the fullest possible way, his advice being of the greatest service. Wentworth wrote that of all the Privy Council, he confided only in Radcliffe and Christopher Wandesford, whose services to him could never be adequately rewarded. It was Radcliffe who persuaded Strafford to mend an early quarrel with James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde, arguing rightly that Ormonde would be a friend and ally of immense value.

On the other hand, he and Strafford showed very poor judgement in their campaign of harassment against the powerful magnate Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork, who became an implacable enemy of Strafford, and worked patiently over the years for his ruin.

Radcliffe sat in the Irish House of Commons as member for County Armagh in the Parliament of 1634–35 and for County Sligo in the Parliament of 1639–41, and was farmer of the customs revenues. He also acquired substantial lands in County Fermanagh and County Sligo. When Strafford returned to England in 1639, he entrusted Radcliffe with the management of Ireland&#x27;s finances and also Strafford&#x27;s own tangled financial affairs. Radcliffe built Rathmines Castle near Dublin: it was destroyed during the wars of the following decade but rebuilt in the eighteenth century.

In 1640, Radcliffe, like Strafford, was arrested and impeached, but the charges against him were not pressed. He was freed in 1642, and in 1643 he was with Charles I at Oxford. He remained loyal to Strafford&#x27;s family, and used his extensive knowledge of his master&#x27;s financial affairs to salvage something for his widow and children.

==Exile ==

In 1647 he fled to France, and joined the Court in exile. His association with Strafford, now seen as a martyr for the Royalist cause, made him a figure of some importance, and he became a confidential adviser to the future James II. Unfortunately, he was drawn into James&#x27;s quarrels with his mother Henrietta Maria and his brother Charles II, and for a time Charles declared him &quot;persona non grata&quot;. Through Ormonde&#x27;s goodwill, Radcliffe was eventually restored to favour, but had little influence in his last years. He wrote to his wife that he was &quot;as weary as a dog of his office&quot;, and that only loyalty to James deterred him from retirement. He also complained, like many exiled Royalists, of his dire poverty, &quot;not having had a new suit of clothes in five years&quot;. He died at Flushing in May 1657.

By his wife Anne, daughter of Sir Francis Trappes and Mary Atkinson, he had one son Thomas. Thomas regained the family estates in County Sligo at the Restoration of Charles II, but died without issue in Dublin in 1679. Anne died two years after her husband, and is buried in Westminster Abbey.

Radcliffe wrote &quot;An essay towards the life of my Lord Strafford&quot;, from which the material for the various lives of the statesman has been largely taken. His description of Strafford&#x27;s much-loved second wife Arabella Holles has been described as &quot;lyrical&quot;, and suggests that he had a romantic devotion to her memory.

==Character==

Veronica Wedgwood describes him as a pious man of simple tastes, not outstandingly intelligent, but courageous, thorough and a skilled lawyer. On the other hand, he could be irritable, intolerant, and indiscreet.

<doc id="929902" wikidata="Q5198674" url="?curid=929902" title="Cyclobenzaprine">
<text>Cyclobenzaprine, sold under several brand names including, historically, Flexeril, is a muscle relaxer used for muscle spasms from musculoskeletal conditions of sudden onset. It is not useful in cerebral palsy. It is taken by mouth.
Common side effects include headache, feeling tired, dizziness, and dry mouth. Serious side effects may include an irregular heartbeat. There is no evidence of harm in pregnancy, but it has not been well studied in this population. It should not be used together with MAOIs. How it works is unclear. In any case, it is known to inhibit serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and to block serotonin, adrenergic, histamine, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Chemically, it is very similar to tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline.
Cyclobenzaprine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1977. It is available by prescription as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 45th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 13million prescriptions. It was not available in the United Kingdom as of 2012.

== Medical uses ==
Cyclobenzaprine is used, in conjunction with physical therapy, to treat muscle spasms that occur because of acute musculoskeletal conditions. After sustaining an injury, muscle spasms occur to stabilize the affected body part, which may increase pain to prevent further damage. Cyclobenzaprine is used to treat such muscle spasms associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. It decreases pain in the first two weeks, peaking in the first few days, but has no proven benefit after two weeks. Since no benefit is proven beyond that, therapy should not be continued long-term. It is the best-studied muscle relaxer. It is not useful for spasticity due to neurologic conditions such as cerebral palsy. It may also be used along with other treatments for tetanus.

=== Comparison to other medications ===
Cyclobenzaprine has been found not to be inferior to tizanidine, orphenadrine, and carisoprodol in the treatment of acute lower back pain, although none have been proven to be effective for long-term use (beyond two weeks of treatment). No differences in pain or spasm scores were noted among these agents, nor when compared to benzodiazepines. However, nonbenzodiazepine (including cyclobenzaprine) treatment was found to have a lower risk of medication abuse and continuation of use against medical advice. Side effects such as sedation and ataxia are also less pronounced with nonbenzodiazepine antispasmodics.

In a study on the treatment of musculoskeletal pain treatment with cyclobenzaprine alone or in combination with ibuprofen, no significant differences in pain scores were noted among the three treatment groups. Peak benefit was found to occur on day seven of the treatment for all groups.

== Side effects ==
Cyclobenzaprine results in increased rates of drowsiness (38%), dry mouth (24%), and dizziness (10%). Drowsiness and dry mouth appear to intensify with increasing dose. The sedative effects of cyclobenzaprine are likely due to its antagonistic effect on histamine, serotonin, and muscarinic receptors.

Agitation is a common side effect observed, especially in the elderly. Some experts believe that cyclobenzaprine should be avoided in elderly patients because it can cause confusion, delirium, and cognitive impairment. In general, the National Committee for Quality Assurance recommends avoiding the use of cyclobenzaprine in the elderly because of the potential for more severe side effects.

Dysphagia, a life-threatening side-effect, may rarely occur. Treatment protocols and support should follow the same as for any structurally related tricyclic, such as tricyclic antidepressants.

== Overdose ==
The most common effects of overdose are drowsiness and tachycardia. Rare but potentially critical complications are cardiac arrest, abnormal heart rhythms, severe low blood pressure, seizures, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Life-threatening overdose is rare, however, as the median lethal dose is about 338 milligrams/kilogram in mice and 425 mg/kg in rats. The potential harm is increased when central nervous system depressants and antidepressants are also used; deliberate overdose often includes other drugs.

== Interactions ==
Cyclobenzaprine has major contraindications with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). At least one study also found increased risk of serotonin syndrome when cyclobenzaprine was taken with the serotonergic drugs duloxetine or phenelzine.

These substances may interact with cyclobenzaprine:

* Central nervous system depressants (e.g. alcohol, opioids, benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepines, phenothiazines, carbamates, barbiturates, major tranquilizers)
* Monoamine oxidase inhibitors taken within two weeks of cyclobenzaprine may result in serious, life-threatening side effects.

Cyclobenzaprine may affect the medications used in surgical sedation and some surgeons request that patients temporarily discontinue its use prior to surgery.

== Pharmacology ==
=== Pharmacodynamics ===
Cyclobenzaprine is a centrally acting muscle relaxant with a chemical structure that is very similar to those of tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline and imipramine.

Its known actions include serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibition, serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptor antagonism, α1- and α2-adrenergic receptor antagonism, histamine H1 receptor noncompetitive antagonism, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonism. In terms of its antimuscarinic activity, it is said to be an antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine M1, M2, and M3 receptors, but not of the muscarinic acetylcholine M4 or M5 receptor.

The mechanism of action of cyclobenzaprine as a muscle relaxant is unknown. However, it may work through modulating the serotonergic and noradrenergic systems. The antihistamine activity of cyclobenzaprine is thought to play a major role in its sedative effects. Similarly to tricyclic antidepressants, cyclobenzaprine shows antidepressant-like effects in animals.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Cyclobenzaprine has an oral bioavailability of about 55% and approximately 93% is bound to proteins in plasma. Its metabolite norcyclobenzaprine (NCBP) is active. The elimination half-life of cyclobenzaprine is 18hours and it has a clearance of 0.7L/min.

== Chemistry ==
Cyclobenzaprine is a tricyclic compound of the dibenzocycloheptene group. It is very similar in chemical structure to tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline and imipramine, which are likewise dibenzocycloheptenes. Cyclobenzaprine differs from amitriptyline in structure only by the presence of a single double bond within the tricyclic ring system.

== Society and culture ==
=== Formulations ===
By mouth, cyclobenzaprine is marketed as Apo-Cyclobenzaprine, Fexmid, Flexeril and Novo-Cycloprine. It is available in generic form. A once-a-day, extended-release formulation, Amrix, is available. Cyclobenzaprine is also used by compounding pharmacies in topical creams.

== Research ==
===Fibromyalgia===
A 2004 review found benefit for fibromyalgia symptoms, with a reported number needed to treat of 4.8 (meaning that 1 person out of every 4.8 benefits from treatment) for pain reduction, but no change in fatigue or tender points. A 2009 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to justify its use in myofascial pain syndrome.

Two Phase 3 clinical trials reported that an experimental sublingual formulation of cyclobenzaprine, TNX-102 SL, was able to reduce pain and improve sleep quality in patients with fibromyalgia. The RESILIENT trial reported significant reductions in daily pain and improvements in various fibromyalgia symptoms, including fatigue and depressive symptoms, compared to placebo. A separate Phase 3 clinical trial evaluated TNX-102 SL in patients with military-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and reported the drug did not provide a sustained, significant improvement in overall PTSD severity, but it did demonstrate improvements in sleep quality during the 12-week trial.

<text>John Whitaker Hulke FRCS FRS FGS (6 November 1830 – 19 February 1895) was a British surgeon, geologist and fossil collector. He was the son of a physician in Deal, who became a Huxleyite despite being deeply religious.

Hulke became Huxley&#x27;s colleague at the Royal College of Surgeons. He was a long-time collector from the Wealden cliffs of the Isle of Wight, and his work on vertebrate palaeontology included studies of &quot;Iguanodon&quot; and &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; from the Wealden (Lower Cretaceous). He became president of the Geological Society (1882–84); and was awarded Wollaston Medal in 1888. He was president of the Pathological Society of London in 1883, and president of the Royal College of Surgeons from 1893 until his death.

==Life==
Hulke was born in Deal, Kent, the son of a general practitioner. He was educated partly at a boarding-school in England, partly at the Moravian College at Neuwied (1843–1845), where he gained an intimate knowledge of German and an interest in geology through visits to the Eifel district. Of Dutch Reformed descent, and Calvinist leanings, he held strict views: &quot;his Protestantism was of the intolerant kind&quot;. He got on well with Huxley, whose agnosticism was also rather strait-laced. After returning from Germany he entered King&#x27;s College School, and three years later commenced work at the hospital. He qualified MRCS in 1852.

==Career==
In the Crimean War he volunteered, and was appointed (1855) assistant-surgeon at Smyrna and subsequently during the Siege of Sevastopol. On returning home he became medical tutor at his old hospital, was elected FRCS in 1857, and afterwards assistant-surgeon to the Royal Ophthalmic Hospital, Moorfields (1857), and surgeon (1868–1890).

In 1861, Hulke first described oculodermal melanosis (Nevus of Ota). In 1870 he became surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital, and here much of his more important surgical work was accomplished. His skill as an operator was widely known: he was an excellent general surgeon, but made his special mark as an ophthalmologist. As a geologist he attained a European reputation: he was elected FRS in 1867 for his researches on the anatomy and physiology of the retina in man and the lower animals, particularly the reptiles.

He subsequently devoted all his spare time to geology and especially to the fossil reptilia, describing many remains of dinosaurs from the Isle of Wight. He had access to one of the best private collections of the day: that of Rev. W. Fox on the Isle of Wight. Hulke located a complete &quot;Iguanodon&quot; braincase in 1869, and offered it to Huxley to describe. Huxley was too busy, but helped Hulke prepare and describe it. Hulke published a string of papers in the Geological Society of London&#x27;s &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;. In 1887 the Wollaston Medal was awarded to him by the Geological Society.

He was president of both the Geological and Pathological Societies in 1883, and president of the Clinical Society from 1893 to 1895 and of the Royal College of Surgeons from 1893 until his death. He was a man with a wide range of knowledge not only of science but of literature and art. In all, he published over fifty papers, 28 on dinosaurs. After his death his collection was donated to the Natural History Museum. He delivered the 1891 Bradshaw Lecture at the Royal College of Surgeons on spinal fractures and dislocations.

He was due to read the Hunterian Oration at the Royal College of Surgeons just before his death in February 1895. In the event it was delivered on his behalf by past president Thomas Bryant.

<doc id="929917" wikidata="Q3746796" url="?curid=929917" title="Brown-water navy">
<text>A brown-water navy or riverine navy, in the broadest sense, is a naval force capable of military operations in littoral zone waters. The term originated in the United States Navy during the American Civil War, when it referred to Union forces patrolling the muddy Mississippi River, and has since been used to describe the small gunboats and patrol boats commonly used in rivers, along with the larger &quot;mother ships&quot; that supported them. These mother ships include converted World War II-era mechanized landing craft and tank landing ships, among other vessels.

Brown-water navies are contrasted with seaworthy blue-water navies, which can independently conduct operations in the open ocean. Green-water navies, which can operate in brackish estuaries and littoral coasts, are the bridge between brown-water navies and blue-water navies.

==History==

===River Thames===

The River Thames was a regular thoroughfare for the Sovereign until the middle of the 19th century. Monarchs would be rowed up and down the river in a Royal barge, with transport and security organised by the King&#x27;s Bargemaster. The barges were operated by the Royal Watermen, drawn from the ranks of the Company of Watermen and Lightermen. In 1798, Watermen and other groups of river tradesmen on the River Thames voluntarily formed associations of River Fencibles. These were officially drawn together in 1803 as the &quot;Corps of River Fencibles of the City of London&quot;. Members of the Corps escorted the barge carrying the body of Lord Nelson along the Thames in small boats during his state funeral in 1806. The Corps of River Fencibles was eventually disbanded in 1813.

===Habsburg and Ottoman Empires===

Both the Habsburg Empire and the Ottoman Empire maintained river flotillas on the Danube in 18th and 19th centuries, most notable for the use of šajka boats.
Men who served in the Habsburg flotilla were known as Šajkaši.

===Napoleonic Wars===

After losing its blue-water fleet in the Battle of Copenhagen in 1807, the kingdom of Denmark-Norway quickly built a brown-water navy. The partial successes of the resulting Gunboat War were undone by land invasion.

===Mexican–American War===
During the Mexican–American War, Commodore Matthew C. Perry decided to invade the Mexican towns along the Gulf Coast near Tabasco. In October 1846 Perry was in command of USS &quot;Mississippi&quot;, USS &quot;Vixen&quot;, USRC &quot;McLane&quot;, USS &quot;Reefer&quot;, USS &quot;Bonito&quot;, USS &quot;Nonata&quot; and USRC &quot;Forward&quot; with a 253-man landing force. After capturing the port of Frontera on the Tabasco River, the ships under Perry&#x27;s command crossed the bar at the mouth of the river and traveled up river to the town of Tabasco. After several days of bombardment of Tabasco, Perry&#x27;s ships captured several Mexican ships on the river and brought them back to Frontera. Some were commissioned into U.S. Navy service and others were burned.

The city of Tampico was poorly defended and offered a base for operations for the conquest of the state of Tamaulipas. For these reasons Tampico became the next target for seizure by American naval forces. Commodore David Conner directed that it be attacked in late October 1846 and those plans were captured by General Antonio López de Santa Anna. Santa Anna directed that Tampico be almost abandoned and his forces be moved up river to Pánuco. This move was completed by 28 October. The bar at the mouth of the Pánuco River was only eight feet and hindered the movement of American ships up the river. The wife of the former American consul at Tampico sent word to Conner that the river was rising and that the town had been abandoned. Conner&#x27;s forces crossed the bar on 14 November and began shelling the town. Almost immediately the remaining garrison at Tampico surrendered and Conner learned that the troops stationed there had retreated to Pánuco 25 miles upstream from Tampico. After Conner&#x27;s ships moved to Pánuco and several days of naval bombardment, the Mexican forces at Pánuco surrendered. The American Army quickly occupied Tampico and used it for a staging point for a planned attack on Veracruz.

===American Civil War===

The U.S. Navy during the American Civil War (1861–1865) may be considered a &quot;brown-water navy&quot;. As a blueprint for the &quot;strangulation&quot; of the Confederate States of America, Winfield Scott&#x27;s Anaconda Plan called for a two-pronged approach by first blocking the South&#x27;s harbors and then pushing along the Mississippi River, effectively cutting the Confederate territory in two while also robbing the South of its main artery of transport. The U.S. Navy was assigned the blockade of the seaports, while a new force of gunboats and river ironclads, together with regular army units, would take, or at least lay siege to, the Confederate forts and cities along the Mississippi. In the early days of the war, U.S. Army built and crewed these boats, with the naval officers commanding them being the only direct connection to the U.S. Navy. By the autumn of 1862, the boats and their mission were transferred to the Department of the Navy. Because of the river&#x27;s murky brown water, the ships that participated in these Mississippi campaigns were quickly referred to as the &quot;brown-water navy&quot;, as opposed to the regular U.S. Navy (which was henceforth referred to as the &quot;deep-water&quot; or &quot;blue-water&quot; navy).

===Paraguayan War===
After the end of the American civil war the next major military conflict in the world was the Paraguayan War (1864–1870). In this the Brazilian brown-water navy, which comprised large ironclads as well as river monitors, had a crucial role.

The natural water highway to the Republic of Paraguay was the River Paraguay but this route was blocked by the formidable Fortress of Humaitá. It comprised a line of artillery batteries overlooking a sharp concave bend in the river, at a point where the channel was only wide. A chain boom could be raised to block the navigation. The fortress was exceedingly hard to take from the landward side for it was protected by impassible swamp, marsh or lagoons and, where not, by of trenches with a garrison of 18,000 men. The river was shallow, uncharted and capable of trapping large vessels if the water level should fall. In that environment the greatest threat to shipping was &quot;torpedoes&quot; (nineteenth-century floating naval mines).

Six vessels of the Brazilian ironclad squadron eventually succeeded in dashing past Humaitá in an incident known as the Passage of Humaitá, an event considered as nearly impossible. Although it could not operate far beyond its military forward base, nevertheless, Brazilian domination of the river meant that Paraguay could no longer resupply the fortress, and eventually it was starved out and captured by the land forces in the Siege of Humaitá.

Even after Humaitá was captured − which took more than two years – the Paraguayans improvised further strongpoints along the river, further delaying the Allies (the Empire of Brazil, the Argentine Republic and the Republic of Uruguay).

===U.S. gunboat diplomacy in China===
Save for an occasional river patrol boat, the United States&#x27; river ironclad navy was all but abolished at the end of the American Civil War. Yet the concept of a river defense force lived on in countries and regions where rivers enabled the U.S. to project its military presence, allowing it to protect its foreign interests abroad. U.S. river boats (gunboats) of the Asiatic Fleet operated in portions of Chinese rivers, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Asiatic Navy&quot; or &quot;China Navy&quot;, during the turbulent 1920s, patrolling for insurgents and river pirates. Two of the most notable China gunboats were , which was sunk in 1937 by Japanese military aircraft prior to World War II, and , which was captured by the Japanese in December 1941. The U.S. Navy of that era used the term for protecting U.S. foreign policy and its citizens abroad &quot;gunboat diplomacy&quot;. The U.S. Navy, China gunboat, , was sunk by the Japanese in March 1942.

===Second Sino-Japanese War===
During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Manchukuo Imperial Navy served principally to patrol the Sungari, Amur, and Ussuri rivers, support Army operations against Chinese resistance forces, and guard Manchukuo&#x27;s riverine borders with the Soviet Union. In 1939 the Navy&#x27;s forces came under the control of the Manchukuo Imperial Army as the River Defence Fleet.

=== Indochina War ===
During the First Indochina War, the French Navy created the Dinassaut (naval assault divisions), in 1947, to operate in the waters of the Mekong and Red rivers, conducting search and destroy missions, against communist guerillas and river pirates. They succeeded the river flotillas created in 1945, by the request of General Leclerc. The Dinassaut served until the end of the conflict in 1955, and its concept would be latter adopted by the United States Navy in the Vietnam War.

Ten Dinassauts were created, with five based in Cochinchina and the others in Tonkin. Each one was made of about ten vessels and one Commandos Marine unit. The types of vessels operated by a Dinassaut included LCI, LCT, LCM, LCVP, LCS, LCA, LSSL and fire support vessels.

The role of the Dinassaut was to transport, land and support the infantry, to patrol the watercourses and to assure the supply of the isolated posts.

The sailors that served in the Dinassaut were referred as the &quot;Navy in Khaki&quot;, in comparison with the sailors that served in the ocean that were referred as the &quot;Navy in White&quot;.

=== Portuguese Colonial War ===

In Portuguese service, the brown-water navy has been often referred as the &quot;Naval Dust&quot; (), for its use of a large number of small vessels, in comparison with the conventional blue-water navy that uses a smaller number of larger vessels. In several historical periods, the Portuguese Navy had to develop riverine forces to operate in then-Portuguese colonies in Asia, South America and Africa.

During the Portuguese Colonial War, from 1961 to 1974, the Portuguese Navy created a brown-water navy to operate in the rivers and lakes of Angola, Portuguese Guinea and Mozambique, against the separatist, communist guerrillas, as well as river pirates. For the organization of their riverine forces, the Portuguese were inspired by the French experience in Indochina with the Dinassaut and by their own historical experience in the operation of river flotillas in support of the Portuguese colonial pacification campaigns in Africa during the late 19th and early 20th
centuries.

Under the local commands of the Navy, the Portuguese created river boat flotillas (&quot;esquadrilhas de lanchas&quot;) in the Zaire River in Angola, in the Lake Nyasa in Mozambique and in the river system of the Portuguese Guinea. Smaller riverine forces were also created in the Cabinda Province of Angola, in Eastern Angola (to operate in the Cuito, Zambezi, Cuando, Lungué Bungo and Cuanza rivers) and in Tete to operate in the Mozambican section of the Zambezi river. These forces were responsible for reconnaissance, surveillance, the interdiction of the rivers and lakes to the enemy, and to avoid their use for the infiltration and supply of guerrillas in the interior of Portuguese territory. Additionally, the riverine forces were also tasked with the mobile fire support to the land forces, the movement of troops, the supply of the Portuguese garrisons and the support of the civilian population in the riverine areas.

For these riverine forces, the Portuguese Navy conceived five types of vessels: the LFG (large river patrol boats of 200–300 t), the LFP (small river patrol boats of 18–40 t), the LDG (large landing craft of 480–550 t), the LDM (medium landing craft of 50 t) and the LDP (small landing craft of 12 t). The LFGs were armed with 40 mm guns and the LDPs with 20 mm guns, with several units of both types being also armed with rocket launchers. The LDG, LDM and LDP types were based, respectively, in the LCT, LCM and LCVP/LCA designs, but were modified in order to have a greater mission endurance and to be used for patrolling, fire support and as a mobile base for the Marines. This modifications included the protection of sensitive parts with armor, the installation of 40 mm (LDGs) or 20 mm (LDMs and LDPs) guns and the improvement of the crew accommodations, partially at the expense of the cargo deck.

The river boat flotillas were complemented by assault units of Special Marines (&quot;fuzileiros especiais&quot;) and security units of Marines (&quot;fuzileiros&quot;). The Portuguese Marines operated based in the patrol boats and landing craft and also using their own rubber boats.

===Vietnam War===


On 18 December 1965, for the first time since the American Civil War, the United States Navy formalized its new, brown-water navy in Vietnam. Initially, the brown-water navy patrolled the inland waterways of the Mekong River, primarily with South Vietnamese river craft (RAG—River Assault Groups) boats, which were mostly inherited from the French Navy during the previous war and in turn, had been received from the U.S., as military aid, in the French fight against the Viet Minh, the Communist-led Vietnamese alliance. As the new fiberglass Patrol Boat, River using water jet propulsion, became available, it became the main interdiction vessel for patrolling the Vietnamese Mekong River country.

For coastal duty the South Vietnamese Navy used larger seaworthy craft. These were replaced by newer U.S. Navy Swift Boats (PCF—Patrol Craft Fast, aluminum 50 footers) and United States Coast Guard Point-class cutters. By the late 1960s, the Swift Boat would commence operations alongside the PBRs in the inland waters, as well as maintaining operations along the coastline. Navy and Coast Guard ships assumed coastal duties. The Swift boats were operated by small crews but became a staple asset in riverine operations; they patrolled waterways, performed special operations, gunfire support and insertion of troops into enemy territory.

The brown-water Mobile Riverine Force was a joint venture between the Navy and the Army, modeled after the earlier French Riverine and coastal patrols in the First Indochina War (1946–1954). In the beginning this force consisted of mostly modified surplus U.S. World War II landing craft (boats), such as the LCMs, LCVPs, LCIs, etc. The only entirely new riverine boat from the French Indochina War had been the French designed STCN (an all-steel &quot;V&quot; hulled boat, approximately 40 feet in length, whose design had been influenced by the U.S. LCVP). This particular craft influenced the design of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s only original riverine boat built for the Vietnam War—the 50-foot all-steel hull, aluminum superstructured Assault Support Patrol Boat (ASPB) or &quot;Alpha Boat&quot;. The ASPB was built by the Gunderson Company, in Oregon, USA, and was of reinforced construction, in order to survive exploding mines. As a consequence, the ASPB earned a reputation as the &quot;minesweeper&quot; of the riverine forces.

Along with the aforementioned PBRs, other riverine craft included PCFs, ASPBs, and monitors (modified LCMs). Together these craft formed a Mobile Riverine Force, that utilized various supporting facilities, such as the Yard Repair Berthing and Messings, advance bases, LSTs, helicopter and seawolf units.

The brown-water navy (in conjunction with other efforts, such as Operation Market Time and Operation Game Warden) was largely successful in its efforts to stop North Vietnam using the South Vietnamese coast and rivers to resupply its military and the Viet Cong. The flow of weapons and ammunition came to a virtual standstill during Operation Market Time, from 1965 and 1970.

Brown-water river assault units were formalized in January 1967 with the 2nd Brigade, 9th Infantry Division arriving under the command of Major General William Fulton. Later that same year, in combination with U.S. Navy Task Force 116 &amp; 117 they formed the Mobile Riverine Force. In 1970, for the last time since the Civil War, the Navy stood down the last of its brown-water navy units, as they were turned over to the South Vietnamese and Cambodian governments under the Vietnamization policy.

<text>Northeastern University (NEU) is a public university in Shenyang, Liaoning, China. It is affiliated with the Ministry of Education, and co-funded by the Ministry of Education, SASTIND, Liaoning Provincial People&#x27;s Government, and Shenyang Municipal People&#x27;s Government. The university is part of Project 211, Project 985, and the Double First-Class Construction.

==History==
In 1921, the parliament of Feng Tian province passed a bill on uniting Jilin and Heilongjiang province leading to the establishment of the Northeastern University. The main objective is to reserve talent and invigorate education.

In April 1923, Northeastern University was founded, with Wang Yongjiang, the then acting governor of Feng Tian Province, appointed as its first president. The university opened school of Literature and Laws at the former location of the Feng Tian Literature school, and school of science and engineering at the former Shenyang Higher Normal School.

In August 1928, General Zhang Xueliang served as the university president. In 1929, Zhang invited Liu Bannong to write the lyrics of the university song and Zhao Yuanren to compose the music. Later, the song was adapted and improved by Lv Yuan, a famous composer.

Following the Mukden incident in 1931, the Japanese army seized control of Shenyang, resulting in the university being forced into exile. In October, the university resumed academic activities in Beiping.

In 1936, the School of Engineering of Northeastern University moved to Xi&#x27;an, establishing a branch school. After the Xi&#x27;an Incident in December led to the imprisonment of university president Zhang, the Nationalist government of China appointed educator Zang Qifang as the acting president of the school in January 1937. Subsequently ,in June, the school moved to Xi&#x27;an entirely.

In the spring of 1938, due to heavy bombardment on Xi&#x27;an by the Japanese Air Force and the deteriorating situation, Northeastern University moved to Santai, Sichuan.

In May 1946, following the victory in the Second Sino-Japanese War, the faculty and students of Northeastern University relocated back to Shenyang. 

In March 1949, the Northeastern University was dissolved by the Northeast Administrative Commission. As the result, the School of engineering and part of the School of Science of the Northeastern University were transformed into Northeastern Engineering College, operating under the affiliation of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry of China. The campus is located in Nanhu, Shenyang. 

In 1997, the then Shenyang Gold College merged into Northeastern University.

== Academics ==
Northeastern University is the home to two national key laboratories, State Key Laboratory of Rolling and Automation, State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries and home to 4 national engineering (technology) research centers, 12 key laboratories, engineering centers and strategic research bases of Ministry of Education, 57 key laboratories, engineering centers and engineering laboratories affiliated to Liaoning Province.

There are currently 5 members of Chinese Academy of Engineering or of Sciences as full-time faculty in NEU, including Wen Bangchun (), Chai Tianyou (), Wang Guodong (), Feng Xiating (), and Tang Lixin ().

<doc id="929921" wikidata="Q3419341" url="?curid=929921" title="Checkers and Rally's">
<text>Checkers And Rally&#x27;s LLC is an American fast food double drive-through chain franchise in the United States. The brand operates Checkers and Rally&#x27;s restaurants in 28 states and the District of Columbia. They specialize in hamburgers, hot dogs, french fries, milkshakes, and drinks.

==Overview==
Originally separate companies serving different geographic areas (with Checkers serving the Southeast and Rally&#x27;s serving the Midwest), Checkers and Rally&#x27;s merged in August 1999. Generally speaking, the Checkers name remains used in the Southeast as well as the Northeast while the Rally&#x27;s name remains used in the Midwest as well as California; the two brands have overlapped in several areas.

The merged company is headquartered in Tampa, Florida. Most locations specialize in carryout service with drive-through and &quot;walk-up&quot; windows available, but no indoor seating, though some legacy Rally&#x27;s locations in the Midwest retain dining rooms, as well as two Checkers locations with indoor dining areas in Clearwater, Orlando, and Tavares, Florida.

Checkers was founded in 1986 in Mobile, Alabama by Jim Mattei and went public in 1991. Rally&#x27;s was founded in Louisville, Kentucky in 1985 by Jim Patterson. In 1991 and 1992, Rally&#x27;s absorbed Maxie&#x27;s of America, Snapps Drive-Thru and Zipps Drive-Thru.

In 1996, Rally&#x27;s was bought by CKE Restaurants, a parent company of Carl&#x27;s Jr. and Hardee&#x27;s. CKE sold Rally&#x27;s to Checkers in 1999. Unlike the two CKE chains (which have at various points flip flopped between marketing Carl&#x27;s Jr. &amp; Hardee&#x27;s as one chain or separate regional chains that both share Carl&#x27;s Jr&#x27;s Happy Star logo and imaging, but have largely separate menus), Checkers promptly merged Rally&#x27;s into its branding, and the two chains are now only different by name.

In June 2006, the company went private through a merger with Taxi Holdings Corp., an affiliate of Wellspring Capital Management, a private equity firm. In 2014, Wellspring sold Checkers to another private equity firm, Sentinel Capital Partners. On March 23, 2017, Checkers announced that it would be sold to Oak Hill Capital Partners for $525 million. The sale was completed a month later.

On May 23, 2018, Checkers announced a planned expansion for over two dozen locations in the Pittsburgh area. Despite Rally&#x27;s having brand recognition in the area the locations were to be branded as Checkers. The company made its official return in the area in 2019 under the Rally&#x27;s brand with the opening of a location in Penn Hills.
In February 2020, Checkers &amp; Rally&#x27;s named Frances Allen, former CEO of Boston Market, as their new CEO. She left the position in April 2024 and was replaced by Chris Tebben, former President of Mars Retail Group, in September 2024 . 

===Advertising and promotions===
One of the first advertising campaigns by Checkers and Rally&#x27;s from 1999 to late 2000 featured the slogan &quot;High Performance Human Fuel&quot;. The television advertisements for the campaign were animated in an anime style, featuring a woman named Holly, in pursuit of fast food. The ads were created by Crispin Porter &amp; Bogusky, and illustrated by Peter Chung, who was also responsible for the animation of MTV series &quot;Æon Flux&quot;.

In September 2007, ML Rogers, an advertising agency, won the advertising rights for Checkers Restaurants, and completely restructured the advertising campaign. Among the many changes is their new slogan, &quot;little place. BIG TASTE&quot;, beginning October 2007. In 2007, the chain used a character called Rap Cat, a stuffed animal cat who performs a rap song about the chain. The ad campaign became popular after it became a viral video on YouTube. The company gave away paper bags patterned like a basketball jersey to be worn by cats, with slots to cut out for the legs and tail, and asked customers to post videos of their cat wearing it to a Rap Cat website. This received criticism from animal rights activists, though Checkers stated that the packaging was &quot;intended only as a creative extension of our television campaign.&quot;

In September 2014, they started to have a character called Mr. Bag, a talking bag who appears in the new commercials for Checkers and Rally&#x27;s.

In September 2016, rapper and restaurateur Rick Ross stated his plans for a partnership with Checkers and Rally&#x27;s, including ownership of a few franchises. He opened his first franchise location in Miami in early 2017.

===Security and privacy===
On May 29, 2019, Checkers and Rally&#x27;s disclosed a long-running data breach that affected an unknown number of customers at 103 of its Checkers and Rally&#x27;s locations, with some being infected with a point-of-sale malware as early as 2015.

<doc id="929924" wikidata="Q196847" url="?curid=929924" title="Zeta Reticuli">
<text>Zeta Reticuli, Latinized from ζ Reticuli, is a wide binary star system in the southern constellation of Reticulum. From the southern hemisphere the pair can be seen with the naked eye as a double star in very dark skies. Based upon parallax measurements, this system is located at a distance of about from Earth. Both stars are solar analogs that have characteristics similar to those of the Sun. They belong to the Zeta Herculis Moving Group of co-moving stars that share a common origin.

==Nomenclature==
At a declination of −62°, the system is not visible from Britain&#x27;s latitude of +53°, so it never received a Flamsteed designation in John Flamsteed&#x27;s 1712 &quot;Historia Coelestis Britannica&quot;. The Bayer designation for this star system, Zeta (ζ) Reticuli, originated in a 1756 star map by the French astronomer Abbé Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille. Subsequently, the two stars received separate designations in the Cape Photographic Durchmusterung, which was processed between 1859 and 1903, then in the Henry Draper Catalogue, published between 1918 and 1924.

== Characteristics ==

The double star ζ Reticuli is located in the western part of the small Reticulum constellation, about 25′ from the constellation&#x27;s border with Horologium. In dark southern skies, the two stars can be viewed separately with the naked eye, or with a pair of binoculars. ζ1 Reticuli has an apparent magnitude of 5.52, placing it on the border between 5th- and 6th-magnitude stars. ζ2 Reticuli is slightly brighter at magnitude 5.22.

The two stars are located at similar distances from the Sun and share the same motion through space, confirming that they are gravitationally bound and form a wide binary star system. They have an angular separation of 309.2 arcseconds (5.2 arcminutes); far enough apart to appear as a close pair of separate stars to the naked eye under suitable viewing conditions. The distance between the two stars is at least (0.06 light-year, or almost a hundred times the average distance between Pluto and the Sun), so their orbital period is 170,000 years or more.

Both stars share similar physical characteristics to the Sun, so they are considered solar analogs. Their stellar classification is nearly identical to that of the Sun. ζ1 has 94% of the Sun&#x27;s mass and 90% of the Sun&#x27;s radius. ζ2 is slightly larger and more luminous than ζ1, with 96% of the Sun&#x27;s mass and 98% of the Sun&#x27;s radius. The two stars are somewhat deficient in metals, having only 60% of the proportion of elements other than hydrogen and helium as compared to the Sun. For reasons that remain uncertain, ζ1 has an anomalously low abundance of beryllium. Two possible explanations are: during the star&#x27;s formation it underwent multiple intense bursts of mass accretion from a rapidly rotating protostellar cloud, or else the star underwent rotational mixing brought on by a period of rapid rotation during the star&#x27;s youth.

Both stars were considered unusual because they were thought to have had a lower luminosity than is normal for main-sequence stars of their age and surface temperature. That is, they lie below the main-sequence curve on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram for newly formed stars. However, this was challenged, after using the much more accurate parallaxes from the &quot;Hipparcos&quot; catalogue (ESA, 1997), it was calculated that the stars actually have higher luminosities and so are shifted upwards, putting them in the main sequence. Most stars will evolve above this curve as they age.

ζ1 has an intermediate level of magnetic activity in its chromosphere with an erratic variability. A long-term activity cycle of ~4.2 years has been tentatively identified. ζ2 is more sedate, showing a much lower level of activity with a ~7.9-year cycle, which may indicate it is in a Maunder Minimum state. Although the kinematics of this system suggest that they belong to a population of older stars, the properties of their stellar chromospheres suggests that they are only about 2 billion years old.

This star system belongs to the Zeta Herculis Moving Group of stars that share a common motion through space, suggesting that they have a common origin. In the galactic coordinate system, the components of the space velocity for this system are equal to for ζ1 and for ζ2. They are currently following an orbit through the Milky Way galaxy that has an eccentricity of 0.24. This orbit will carry the system as close as and as far as from the Galactic Center. The inclination of this orbit will carry the stars as much as from the plane of the galactic disk. This likely puts them outside the thick disk population of stars.

==Alleged debris disk==
Zeta Reticuli has no known planets. In 2002, ζ1 was examined at an infrared wavelength of 25 μm, but no indication of an excess of infrared radiation was found.

In 2007, the Spitzer Space Telescope was used to find an apparent infrared excess at a wavelength of 70 μm around ζ2. This radiation was attributed to emission by a debris disk with a mean temperature of , theorized to be orbiting the host star at a distance of 4.3 AU. In 2010, the Herschel Space Observatory, a telescope with a comparatively superior spatial resolution and, unlike Spitzer, able to resolve radiation excesses beyond the wavelength of 70 μm, determined the infrared excess as coming from a two-lobed structure that looked like a debris disk seen edge-on. This debris disk interpreted as an analogy to the Kuiper belt with a semi-major axis of 100 AU and a temperature of 30–40 K.

However, observations with ALMA from October and November 2017 revealed that the structure observed by Herschel shows no common proper motion with Zeta Reticuli. In these observations, no significant flux has been detected around ζ2, showing that the alleged debris disk is not real, but rather a case of background confusion. The observations demonstrate the need to follow up &quot;Herschel&quot; observations of debris disks.

==In UFO folklore==

The 1966 bestseller &quot;The Interrupted Journey&quot; about Barney and Betty Hill reproduced a &quot;star map&quot; drawn by Betty, allegedly based on one she saw aboard an alien spaceship. Based on the map, a fan of the book named Marjorie Fish speculated that the aliens might originate from Zeta Reticuli. By 1974, the Hill case was referred to as the Zeta Reticuli incident. In a 1980 episode of &quot;,&quot; Carl Sagan demonstrated that the Hill map bore no resemblance to the real-life map. 

In the 1988 broadcast &quot;UFO Cover Up? Live&quot;, alleged government informant &quot;Falcon&quot; (Richard Doty) spread tales of Majestic 12, a hidden cabal that has made a secret treaty with gray aliens from Zeta Reticuli who operate out of Area 51. Alleged Area 51 worker Bob Lazar similarly spread tales of aliens from Zeta Reticuli.

<text>In abstract algebra, a normal extension is an algebraic field extension &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; for which every irreducible polynomial over &quot;K&quot; that has a root in &quot;L&quot; splits into linear factors over &quot;L&quot;. This is one of the conditions for an algebraic extension to be a Galois extension. Bourbaki calls such an extension a quasi-Galois extension. For finite extensions, a normal extension is identical to a splitting field.

== Definition ==
Let &quot;formula_1&quot; be an algebraic extension (i.e., &quot;L&quot; is an algebraic extension of &quot;K&quot;), such that formula_2 (i.e., &quot;L&quot; is contained in an algebraic closure of &quot;K&quot;). Then the following conditions, any of which can be regarded as a definition of normal extension, are equivalent:
* Every embedding of &quot;L&quot; in formula_3 over &quot;K&quot; induces an automorphism of &quot;L&quot;.
* &quot;L&quot; is the splitting field of a family of polynomials in formula_4.
* Every irreducible polynomial of formula_4 that has a root in &quot;L&quot; splits into linear factors in &quot;L&quot;.

== Other properties ==

Let &quot;L&quot; be an extension of a field &quot;K&quot;. Then:

* If &quot;L&quot; is a normal extension of &quot;K&quot; and if &quot;E&quot; is an intermediate extension (that is, &quot;L&quot; ⊇ &quot;E&quot; ⊇ &quot;K&quot;), then &quot;L&quot; is a normal extension of &quot;E&quot;.
* If &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot; are normal extensions of &quot;K&quot; contained in &quot;L&quot;, then the compositum &quot;EF&quot; and &quot;E&quot; ∩ &quot;F&quot; are also normal extensions of &quot;K&quot;.

== Equivalent conditions for normality ==

Let formula_1 be algebraic. The field &quot;L&quot; is a normal extension if and only if any of the equivalent conditions below hold.

* The minimal polynomial over &quot;K&quot; of every element in &quot;L&quot; splits in &quot;L&quot;;
* There is a set formula_7 of polynomials that each splits over &quot;L&quot;, such that if formula_8 are fields, then &quot;S&quot; has a polynomial that does not split in &quot;F&quot;;
* All homomorphisms formula_9 that fix all elements of &quot;K&quot; have the same image;
* The group of automorphisms, formula_10 of &quot;L&quot; that fix all elements of &quot;K&quot;, acts transitively on the set of homomorphisms formula_9 that fix all elements of &quot;K&quot;.

== Examples and counterexamples ==

For example, formula_12 is a normal extension of formula_13 since it is a splitting field of formula_14 On the other hand, formula_15 is not a normal extension of formula_16 since the irreducible polynomial formula_17 has one root in it (namely, formula_18), but not all of them (it does not have the non-real cubic roots of 2). Recall that the field formula_19 of algebraic numbers is the algebraic closure of formula_13 and thus it contains formula_21 Let formula_22 be a primitive cubic root of unity. Then since, 
formula_23 
the map
formula_24
is an embedding of formula_15 in formula_19 whose restriction to formula_27 is the identity. However, formula_28 is not an automorphism of formula_29

For any prime formula_30 the extension formula_31 is normal of degree formula_32 It is a splitting field of formula_33 Here formula_34 denotes any formula_35th primitive root of unity. The field formula_36 is the normal closure (see below) of formula_29

==Normal closure==

If &quot;K&quot; is a field and &quot;L&quot; is an algebraic extension of &quot;K&quot;, then there is some algebraic extension &quot;M&quot; of &quot;L&quot; such that &quot;M&quot; is a normal extension of &quot;K&quot;. Furthermore, up to isomorphism there is only one such extension that is minimal, that is, the only subfield of &quot;M&quot; that contains &quot;L&quot; and that is a normal extension of &quot;K&quot; is &quot;M&quot; itself. This extension is called the normal closure of the extension &quot;L&quot; of &quot;K&quot;.

If &quot;L&quot; is a finite extension of &quot;K&quot;, then its normal closure is also a finite extension.

<text>Matteo Maria Boiardo (, ; 144019/20 December 1494) was an Italian Renaissance poet, best known for his epic poem &quot;Orlando innamorato&quot;.

==Early life==
Boiardo was born in 1440, at or near, Scandiano (today&#x27;s province of Reggio Emilia); the son of Giovanni di Feltrino and Lucia Strozzi. His mother Lucia was the sister of the humanist poet Tito Vespasiano Strozzi, his father Giovanni the son of Feltrino Boiardo, whom Niccolò III d&#x27;Este, Marquis of Ferrara, had made Count of Scandiano, with seignorial power over Arceto, Casalgrande, Gesso, and Torricella. Boiardo was an ideal example of a gifted and accomplished courtier, possessing both a gallant heart and deep humanistic learning.

In 1441 the family moved to Ferrara, where Matteo Maria grew up until his father died in 1451. At an early age he entered the University of Ferrara, where he acquired a good knowledge of Greek and Latin, and even of the Oriental languages. He was in due time admitted doctor in philosophy and in law.

When his grandfather Feltrino died in 1460, Matteo Maria and his cousin Giovanni inherited the fief of Scandiano with its attached lands, but the joint administration gave rise to family feuds culminating in 1474, when Matteo Maria narrowly averted poisoning at the instigation of his aunt Taddea Pio, Giovanni&#x27;s mother. This caused the lands to be divided, and Boiardo became Lord of Scandiano. But already in 1461 disputes with relatives had forced him to take up residence in Ferrara.

==Career==

Up to the year of his marriage to Taddea Gonzaga, the daughter of the Count of Novellara (1472), he had received many marks of favour from Borso d&#x27;Este, Duke of Ferrara, having been sent to meet Frederick III (1469), and afterwards visiting Pope Paul II (1471) in the train of Borso. In 1473 he joined the retinue which escorted Eleonora of Aragon, the daughter of Ferdinand I, to meet her spouse, Ercole, at Ferrara.

In 1476 Boiardo returned to Ferrara to become Duke Ercole&#x27;s companion; here he witnessed the unfolding of Niccolò d&#x27;Este&#x27;s conspiracy against Ercole, his cousin, whose victory Boiardo promptly celebrated in his &quot;Latin&quot; Epigrammata. In 1478 Boiardo married Taddea dei Gonzaga of Novellara, by whom he had six children. 

In 1481 Boiardo was invested with the governorship of Reggio, an office which he filled with noted success till his death, except for a brief interval (1481–86) when he was governor of Modena. The outbreak of war between Ferrara and Venice, the vicissitudes of which are reflected in his &quot;Ecloghe volgari&quot;, and his concern for his native Scandiano, forced him to relinquish the post.

In 1487 Ercole appointed Boiardo ducal emissary for Reggio, an office which he was to hold until his death, and which has left us the largest nucleus of his &quot;Lettere&quot;, mostly of an administrative nature. When Charles VIII of France invaded Italy, in September 1494, Boiardo&#x27;s health had deteriorated. He died in Reggio on 19 December, his death, with that of Poliziano and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola in the same year, marking the end of an era.

==Writing==
In his youth Boiardo had been a successful imitator of Petrarch&#x27;s love poems. For Ercole d&#x27;Este he produced his first humanist works in Latin, the &quot;Carmina de laudibus Estensium&quot; and the &quot;Pastoralia&quot;, both dating from 1463–4; he also undertook a number of free translations into the vernacular, from Cornelius Nepos, Xenophon, Apuleius, Herodotus, and the chronicler Riccobaldo of Ferrara.

While in Reggio in 1469 Boiardo met Antonia Caprara, who inspired his &quot;canzoniere&quot;, his first original work in the vernacular, now regarded as one of the highest poetic achievements of the 15th century. Entitled &quot;Amorum libri tres&quot; and comprising 180 sonnets, canzoni, and madrigals, it recounts in Petrarchan mode the three phases of the poet&#x27;s love, from initial joy to subsequent disillusionment and final mourning. Shortly afterwards Boiardo wrote the comedy &quot;Il Timone&quot; (1487?), loosely based on the dialogue of the same name by Lucian. 

Around 1476 Boiardo began his major work, &quot;Orlando Innamorato&quot;, originally also called &quot;Inamoramento de Orlando&quot;, a grandiose poem of chivalry and romance absorbing the poetic experience of the &quot;canzoniere&quot; and the encomiastic intent of the earlier Latin works (the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition provides a detailed discussion of &quot;Orlando&quot; in its several editions). Within the chivalric tradition &quot;Orlando&quot; &quot;Innamorato&quot; is the first poem to effect a deliberate fusion of the Carolingian and Arthurian narrative cycles; hence the poem&#x27;s novelty, the fact that Orlando, the hero of the &quot;Song of Roland&quot;, is in love. Seen as a cosmic force as well as an essential attribute to chivalry, love is by far the main theme, alongside other major themes of arms, magic, honour, and adventure. Fabulous and anachronistic as this narrative material may seem, the poet relates it to the present by creating the illusion of a live recitation to a courtly audience, whose reactions he registers at various points. Within this frame the narration itself unfolds at a relentless pace, governed by the so-called &quot;entrelacement&quot; technique of suspending one story and shifting to another at the point of maximum expectation.

Almost all Boiardo&#x27;s works, and especially the &quot;Orlando innamorato&quot;, were composed for the amusement of Duke Ercole and his court, though not written within its precincts. His practice, it is said, was to retire to Scandiano or some other of his estates, and there to devote himself to composition, and historians state that he took care to insert in the descriptions of his poem those of the agreeable environs of his château, and that the greater part of the names of his heroes, as Mandricardo, Gradasse, Sacripant, Agramant and others, were merely the names of some of his peasants, which, from their uncouthness, appeared to him proper to be given to Saracen warriors.

===Tarot===
It is uncertain when Boiardo wrote a poem about a self-composed, unusual Tarot game (Tarocchi), which is of relevance to Tarot research of the 15th century and the question of when Tarot developed. 

A Tarocchi deck was produced according to the poem (probably created shortly after Boiardo&#x27;s death). The only known deck has partially survived (only 44 cards out of a deck of at least 56 - or possibly 78 if it originally included the 22 Trumps). It was composed of four unique suits, each representing a passion: Whips (&quot;Timor&quot; &gt; fear), Eyes (&quot;Gelosia&quot; &gt; jealousy), Vases (&quot;Speranza&quot; &gt; hope) and Arrows (&quot;Amor&quot; &gt; love). The suits were each composed of the 10 &quot;pip&quot; cards (Ace through 10) and the 4 Face Cards: &quot;Fante&quot; (&quot;Soldier&quot; / Knave), &quot;Cavallo&quot; (&quot;Cavalryman&quot; / Knight), &quot;Donna&quot; (&quot;Lady&quot; / Queen) and &quot;Re&quot; (&quot;King&quot;). Each card had three lines of verse from the poem in a rectangle at the top.

== Legacy ==
Boiardo&#x27;s &quot;Orlando Innamorato&quot; enjoyed great popularity amongst his contemporaries, its unfinished state prompting a number of sequels by, amongst others, Nicolò degli Agostini, Raffaele Valcieco, and above all Ludovico Ariosto in his &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;. But Pietro Bembo&#x27;s reformation of the language in 1525, the rediscovery of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot; in the 1530s, and the incipient Counter-Reformation in the 1540s all caused it to fall from favour amongst critics and writers, including Torquato Tasso, who found it lacking on linguistic, theoretical, and moral grounds. Gradually, Boiardo&#x27;s original version was supplanted by Francesco Berni&#x27;s &quot;rifacimento&quot; (1542), a recasting of the poem in literary Tuscan, and by Lodovico Domenichi&#x27;s contemporary revision, the publication of which (1544), significantly, coincided with the last edition of Boiardo to appear in the Renaissance in the original text.

Following centuries of neglect, the rediscovery of Boiardo took place in England during the Romantic period. Starting in 1830 Anthony Panizzi, the expatriate Italian professor later to become librarian of the British Museum, produced a historic combined edition of Boiardo&#x27;s &quot;Orlando&quot; &quot;Innamorato&quot; and Ariosto&#x27;s &quot;Orlando&quot; &quot;Furioso&quot;. This marked both the restoration of the &quot;Innamorato&quot;&#x27;s original text and the beginning of modern Boiardo criticism.

Described by the critic Carlo Dionisotti as the most misunderstood poet in Italian literature, and for a long time overshadowed by Ariosto, Boiardo has since emerged as one of the most forceful poets of the Renaissance, his work recognized as the first vernacular masterpiece by a Northern Italian author. As a result of this critical acclaim he now seems set to rival Ariosto&#x27;s long-standing supremacy.

== Translations ==
The first translation of Boiardo into English was Robert Tofte&#x27;s &quot;Orlando Inamorato: The Three First Bookes&quot; (1598), in reality the first three cantos of book 1 in Domenichi&#x27;s version. The Italian text was known to Spenser and Milton, but it was not until the 19th century that other partial translations were attempted, by Richard Wharton (1804), William Stewart Rose (1823), and Leigh Hunt (1846).

<doc id="929933" wikidata="Q8699" url="?curid=929933" title="Leeds Bradford Airport">
<text>Leeds Bradford Airport is located in Yeadon, in the City of Leeds Metropolitan District in West Yorkshire, England, about northwest of Leeds city centre, and about northeast from Bradford city centre. It serves Leeds and Bradford and the wider Yorkshire region including York, Wakefield and Harrogate, and is the largest airport in Yorkshire. The airport was in public ownership until May 2007, when it was bought by Bridgepoint Capital for £145.5 million. Bridgepoint sold it in 2017 to AMP Capital.

Leeds Bradford opened on 17 October 1931 when it was known as &quot;Leeds and Bradford Municipal Aerodrome&quot; or &quot;Yeadon Aerodrome&quot;; some locals still refer to it as Yeadon Airport. Largely used for general aviation and training purposes early on, the first scheduled flights commenced on 8 April 1935. To accommodate passenger traffic, work commenced on the first terminal in the late 1930s, although only the first wing was completed before the Second World War.

British aircraft manufacturer Avro constructed a shadow factory called the Leeds Bradford Airport Depot to the north of the airport, which was the largest free-standing structure in Europe at that time. Avro produced around 5,515 aircraft before it closed in December 1946 and civil flights recommenced the following year. It is located where Leeds Bradford Airport Industrial Estate is today.

In 1965, a new runway opened. After Yeadon&#x27;s terminal was destroyed in a fire, a replacement was completed in 1968. In the early 1980s, runway extensions were completed that enabled it to be classified as a regional airport. On 4 November 1984, the day a runway extension was opened, Wardair commenced transatlantic flights to Toronto, using Boeing 747s. On 2 August 1986, an Air France Concorde charter flight from Paris landed for the first time, drawing an estimated crowd of 70,000 people. More Concorde charter flights took place until 2000. In 1994, the airport&#x27;s operational hour restrictions were removed, enabling flights at any time of day. Since 1996, the terminal has been expanded in the terms of size and facilities. In 2007, nearly 2.9 million passengers passed through the airport, an 88% increase in seven years and more than twice as many compared with 1997 (1.2 million).

Leeds Bradford has a CAA Public Use Aerodrome Licence (Number P800) that allows flights for passenger transport and flight training. The airport operates scheduled flights to many European destinations and a limited number of domestic destinations. It is the highest airport in England at an elevation of . By the number of passengers handled in 2022, Leeds Bradford was the 13th busiest airport in the UK. It is a base for Jet2.com, which has its headquarters at the airport.

== History ==
=== Opening and early operations ===
What became Leeds Bradford Airport was built in the late 1920s and early 1930s on of grassland next to the old Bradford to Harrogate road. On 17 October 1931, the airport, which was interchangeably known as &quot;Leeds and Bradford Municipal Aerodrome&quot; or &quot;Yeadon Aerodrome&quot; in its early years, was officially opened. Initially, the airport was operated by the Yorkshire Aeroplane Club on behalf of Leeds and Bradford Corporations. Its early operations were typified by training and general aviation flights.

In 1935, the aerodrome was expanded by ; the first scheduled flights commenced on 8 April 1935 with a service by North Eastern Airways from London (Heston Aerodrome) to Newcastle upon Tyne (Cramlington). The service was extended to Edinburgh (Turnhouse). In June 1935, Blackpool and West Coast Air Services launched a service to the Isle of Man. By 1936, the London/Yeadon/Newcastle/Edinburgh service was flying three times a week and also stopped at Doncaster and continued to Aberdeen (Dyce).

Seasonal flights between Yeadon and Liverpool commenced during the 1930s. To accommodate the expanding passenger numbers, work commenced on a terminal building but progress was halted after a single wing had been completed. During this time, the German zeppelin LZ 129 Hindenburg overflew the aerodrome and while the flight was claimed to be for publicity purposes, it was later found to have been engaged in espionage.

=== Wartime use ===
At the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, all civil aviation operations were halted. The aircraft manufacturer Avro constructed a shadow factory to the north of the aerodrome to manufacture military aircraft. The factory was connected to the aerodrome by a taxiway from where the aircraft made their way to make their maiden flights. The Avro factory was camouflaged, its roof disguised as a field with dummy cattle and agricultural buildings so that from the air it resembled the surrounding fields. Large numbers of houses were constructed nearby to house the workforce. The factory, which commenced production in 1941, was reportedly the largest free-standing structure in Europe at the time.

To better accommodate the large military aircraft, improvements were made to the aerodrome including two runways, more taxiways and extra hangarage enabling Yeadon to become an important site for military test flying. About 5,515 aircraft were produced at Yeadon of the following main types: Anson (more than 4,500), Bristol Blenheim (250), Lancaster bomber (695), York (45) and the Lincoln (25). Decreased demand at the end of the conflict saw the factory closed in December 1946. On New Year&#x27;s Day 1947, the site was handed over to the Ministry of Civil Aviation. Many of the airport&#x27;s original hangars remain intact.

=== 1947 to 1969 ===

In 1947, civil flights recommenced. Local resident Geoff Rennard who had campaigned for Leeds and Bradford to have an aerodrome established an Aero Club. He was subsequently appointed airport manager, remaining for five years. In 1953, &quot;Yeadon Aviation Ltd&quot; was formed to manage and operate the airport and its Aero Club. In 1955, services to Belfast, Jersey, Ostend, Southend, the Isle of Wight and Düsseldorf were added to Yeadon&#x27;s destination list. Scheduled flights to London commenced in 1960; a route to Dublin by Aer Lingus was added shortly after. In 1965, a new runway was opened and in the same year the terminal building was accidentally destroyed in a fire. Its replacement was started shortly after and was operational by 1968.

=== 1970 to 1994 ===
By the mid-1970s, the package holiday had become popular in the British Isles. During 1976, the first holiday charter flight to the Iberian Peninsula by Britannia Airways departed from Leeds Bradford.

In 1978, it was recognised that, if the runway was extended, the airport could be upgraded to regional airport status. In 1982, construction commenced on the main runway necessitating the construction of a tunnel to take the A658 Bradford to Harrogate road beneath the runway. On 4 November 1984, the runway was completed. Around this time, the airport&#x27;s terminal building was extended and redeveloped. The first phase opened on 18 July 1985.

On 4 November 1984, the day the runway extension was officially opened, Wardair commenced transatlantic flights to Toronto, using Boeing 747s but these flights were discontinued in 1989 when Wardair ceased operations. Worldways Canada, Odyssey International, Air Transat, Nationair and Caledonian all operated transatlantic services from the airport well into the 1990s using Lockheed Tristar and Boeing 757–200 airliners.

On 2 August 1986, an Air France Concorde charter flight from Paris landed at the airport for the first time; an estimated 70,000 people were drawn to the airport to catch a glimpse of the supersonic airliner. Occasional Concorde charter flights using British Airways aircraft continued until June 2000, just one month before the Concorde disaster in Paris.

Leeds Bradford Airport had restricted operating hours that proved to be a deterrent to many charter airlines, whose cheap fares were heavily dependent on &#x27;round-the-clock&#x27; use of their aircraft. In 1994, the restrictions were removed, enabling planes to use the airport 24 hours per day, attracting more business.

=== 1995 to 2019 ===
Work on the airport terminal has been ongoing since 1996, and the result of this has been significant growth in terminal size and passenger facilities. The expanded terminal, along with new hangars, has accommodated the expanding use of airliners such as the Boeing 737.

On 6 October 2005, the original runway, 09/27, was permanently closed; it has since been redeveloped as a taxiway and to provide additional apron space.

In 2007, nearly 2.9 million passengers passed through the airport, an 88% increase in just seven years and more than twice as many compared with 1997 (1.2 million).

In February 2008, Shaheen Air commenced a link to Islamabad. Leeds Bradford&#x27;s first scheduled flight to Asia, the service catered to the Pakistani community in Yorkshire. Shaheen flew to Islamabad with an Airbus A310 that it had leased from a Turkish company. In order to comply with Pakistani government regulations, it needed to switch to a plane registered in Pakistan within three months. However, the airline was unable to obtain such an aircraft in time, so it had to end the route in May 2008. Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) launched a flight to the same city two months later. It also used an A310 on the route.

Between 2000 and 2013, the airport was home to the West/South air platform of the Yorkshire Air Ambulance. It moved to Nostell in November 2013. The following May, PIA terminated its Islamabad service due to financial losses. The A310s consumed fuel inefficiently, and the carrier did not possess enough fuel-efficient aircraft to replace them.

===2020 to present=== 
In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the construction of a temporary extension to the terminal front, titled the &#x27;Preparation Zone&#x27;, acting as a space to queue, maintain Social distancing measures, and to ensure all passengers were wearing face masks as per the UK Government&#x27;s COVID-19 strategy. The existing &#x27;Yorkshire Lounge&#x27; was converted into a takeaway food outlet called &#x27;Flight Bites&#x27;, and all travel money kiosks, other shops / food outlets and the &#x27;Fast Track&#x27; security lane were closed. On 15 July 2020, a new, refurbished Yorkshire Lounge opened; closing the Flight Bites temporary outlet. On the same day, Starbucks and Boots outlets reopened; coinciding with the relaunch of Jet2.com flights.

The effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic caused significant problems in the airport with staff shortages resulting in huge queues for check-in and security, as a result of the airport getting back up to pre-pandemic levels of passenger numbers, leading to it being ranked worst in the UK. This later led to threats of strike action in security over better pay, which were later suspended.

With the closure of Doncaster Sheffield Airport in November 2022, the majority of Wizz Air and TUI&#x27;s flights were transferred to Leeds Bradford, bringing new routes to destinations in Romania and Poland, as well as bringing more passengers in from further afield.

In late 2023, the airport had the introduction of two new destinations to a continent not currently served by the airport, Africa announced for 2024. Both located in Morocco the announcement of Agadir by Jet2 in October and Marrakesh by Ryanair in December.

In August 2024, the airport announced as part of its 2030 vision, plans to reintroduce long haul flights from the airport, stating that this could happen within the next 3 years. They also expect passenger numbers to go from 4 million to 7 million a year by 2030.

== Current facilities ==

The airport has a terminal and two air bridges. It has 21 aircraft stands capable of handling up to Boeing 757 aircraft. Stand 1 is at the western end of the apron with stands 5 to 18 running towards the eastern end of the apron. Remote stands include 19, 20A, 20B, 21A, 21B and 21C. The terminal has two check-in halls: Hall A is used by all airlines except Jet2 and Hall B is solely used by Jet2. Upstairs is a retail space with shops, restaurants, bars and a duty-free shopping area operated by World Duty Free. Food options include Greggs, Starbucks and Burger King. There are three lounges in the departures lounge. Long, medium and short-stay car parks provide 7,000 parking spaces at the airport, along with several drop off points.

The airport processes a small amount of freight from its two cargo sheds on site with a view to expanding this operation, a key focus of the business and master-plan objectives. The airport features a single runway of aligned as 14 and 32. Until 2005, there was a second shorter runway aligned 9 and 27, however it was closed in October 2005 and converted into a taxiway.

== Development ==
Leeds Bradford Airport published a masterplan in March 2017 outlining development needs at the airport through 2030. Planning permission was granted in January 2019 to renovate and expand the terminal to create additional departure gate access, extended seating areas, improved baggage reclaim facilities and enlarged immigration and customs facilities. Leeds City Council and the West Yorkshire Combined Authority (WYCA) also consulted in 2019 on the delivery of a new link road and parkway rail station which could provide a 10-minute connection to Leeds railway station. The link road was dropped, with plans for Leeds Bradford Airport Parkway railway station taken for further development.

However, AMP Capital stated that updating the old 1965 original terminal would neither improve facilities sufficiently nor be able to offer a carbon neutral facility for the future. A planning application for a new terminal was submitted in early 2020 with permission granted by Leeds City Council in February 2021, alongside a rise in annual passenger numbers from four to seven million. Local MPs, environmental action groups and local residents criticised the scheme on environmental grounds, while supporters emphasised the benefits it would bring to the local economy. Following these objections, the decision to expand the airport was referred to the government, which placed a temporary block on construction while it examined the decision further. By March 2022, citing &quot;excessive delays&quot;, the proposal for a new terminal was withdrawn and efforts were again placed into implementing the 2019 expansion plans.

In October 2023, the airport announced the &#x27;LBA:REGEN&#x27; regeneration scheme, committing over £100 million to improve accessibility, expanded retail and dining facilities and a more streamlined arrivals experience, alongside improvements which will allow the airport to meet their net-zero 2030 goal. Construction on this scheme began in autumn 2023 and is expected to be completed by late 2025 / early 2026.

== RAF Yeadon ==

609 (West Riding) Squadron AAF was based at Yeadon from its formation on 10 February 1936, until 27 August 1939 when it was relocated to Catterick. In 1946, 609 Squadron was reformed and returned to Yeadon the following year. The squadron was equipped with de Havilland Mosquito MK.XXX aircraft which were difficult to operate because the runways were too short. Safety speed (at which the aircraft needs to be flown and controlled on a single engine) was not reached until over flying central Leeds when taking off in that direction—with drastic results should things go wrong. The airfield sloped downhill and it was necessary to land at RAF Linton-on-Ouse (20 miles away) if the wind was coming from the wrong direction. Eventually, the Air Ministry re-equipped 609 with Spitfire LFXVIs. This was sufficient as a short-term measure, but the grass airstrip was not ideally suited to Spitfire operations, and it was decided that 609 Squadron should move to the hard runways of RAF Church Fenton in October 1950.

Yeadon was requisitioned by the Royal Air Force and became part of 13 Group and subsequently 12 Group. Once 609 (West Riding) Squadron left for Catterick, Yeadon served as a Flying Training School, bomber maintenance unit, and a scatter airfield. In January 1942, it was transferred to the Ministry of Aircraft Production and Avro built a shadow factory for the production of Albermarles, Ansons, Lancasters, Yorks, and Lincolns. It was also used by Hawker Aircraft for development work on its Tornado design. The Royal Air Force remained a part of Yeadons life until 1957, operating Austers, Supermarine Spitfires, de Havilland Mosquitoes out of here. RAF Yeadon finally closed in 1959.

* Slingsby Grunau Baby 1947–1950
* de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk 1955–1960
* Auster 1952–1957

== Airport ownership ==
Leeds and Bradford councils jointly bought the airport site in 1930 and it opened as Yeadon Aerodrome in 1931. The airport became a limited company in 1987, and was shared between the five boroughs, Leeds (40%), Bradford (40%) and Wakefield, Calderdale and Kirklees (sharing the remaining 20%).

In October 2006, plans to privatise the airport were confirmed and on 4 April 2007 the five controlling councils announced that Bridgepoint Capital had been selected as the preferred bidder. On 4 May 2007, Bridgepoint Capital acquired the airport from Leeds, Bradford, Wakefield, Calderdale and Kirklees councils for £145.5 million. Although Bridgepoint Capital owned the airport 100% financially, the councils hold a &quot;special share&quot; in the airport, to protect its name and continued operation as an air transport gateway for the Yorkshire region. In November 2017, Bridgepoint Capital sold the airport to AMP Capital who own several other airports around the world. AMP plans to expand the airport, improve the customer experience and secure more business flights.

== Airlines and destinations ==
The following airlines operate regular scheduled flights to and from Leeds Bradford:


== Statistics ==
=== Passengers and movements ===
=== Routes ===
== Ground transport ==
Bus services to and from the airport are currently operated by Transdev Blazefield under the Flyer brand. The network currently consists of three routes.
A1 to Rawdon, Horsforth, Hawksworth, Kirkstall and Leeds.
A2 to Pool, Pannal and Harrogate to the North, and Yeadon, Rawdon, Apperley Bridge, Greengates, and Bradford to the South.
A3 to Pool and Otley to the North, and Yeadon, Guiseley, Shipley and Bradford to the South.

Services were previously operated by Yorkshire Tiger, branded as &#x27;Flying Tiger&#x27;. The routes were numbered 737 (A3), 747 (A2) and 757 (A1). The tender was given to Transdev Blazefield in August 2020 due to Covid resulting in the routes no longer being commercially viable for Yorkshire Tiger.

Bus services to the cities of Leeds and Bradford link the airport with the National Rail network via Leeds railway station, Bradford Interchange and Bradford Forster Square and connects with long-distance coach services at Leeds City bus station and Bradford Interchange.

== Flight training and general aviation ==

Since 1994, the airport has been home to Multiflight, a flight training and aircraft engineering organisation. They are also the dedicated FBO at the airfield and provide helicopter and fixed wing charter flights as well as aircraft sales and management. General aviation operations are confined to the south-side of the airport, in order to maintain separation from commercial traffic utilising the main terminal.

During 2005, a pair of new hangars capable of housing up to four Boeing 737-800s were constructed, as well as a new apron and direct taxiway to the runway. A dedicated southside fuel farm was also installed.

The Aviation Academy is located within a hangar at Leeds Bradford Airport. It is operated by Craven College in conjunction with the Open University. The academy trains and prepares students to work within the commercial aviation industry.

Hields Aviation has operated from Leeds Bradford Airport since 2019, offering both fixed wing and helicopter training from the Flight Training Centre, based opposite the Multiflight west hangar.

== Incidents and accidents ==
Prior to 1985, there were two recorded incidents of runway overruns at Leeds Bradford Airport, both involving British Midland Airways Viscount aircraft, and both showing evidence of hydroplaning.
* On 27 May 1985, a Lockheed Tristar operated by British Airtours, registration G-BBAI, on British Airtours Flight 101 overran the runway surface on landing from Palma after a rain shower. The aircraft was evacuated, with only minor injuries sustained by the 14 crew and 398 passengers. The nose landing gear strut folded backwards during the overrun, leading to severe damage to the underside of the forward fuselage. The undersides of both wing-mounted engines were flattened and both engines suffered ingestion damage. The main wheels of the aircraft also dug deep troughs in the area beyond the end of the runway, damaging the buried airfield lighting cables. The accident report concluded that the overrun was caused by the inability of the aircraft to achieve the appropriate level of braking effectiveness and recommended that both the scheduled wet runway performance of the TriStar and the condition of the surface of runway 14 at Leeds Bradford Airport should be re-examined.
* On 24 May 1995, an Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante aircraft, registration G-OEAA operated by Knight Air on a flight between Leeds Bradford and Aberdeen (see Knight Air Flight 816), entered a steeply descending spiral dive, broke up in flight and crashed into farmland at Dunkeswick Moor near Leeds. All 12 occupants were killed. The probable cause of the accident was the failure of one or both artificial horizon instruments. There was no standby artificial horizon installed (as there was no airworthiness requirement for one on this aircraft) and the accident report concluded that this left the crew without a single instrument available for assured attitude reference or simple means of determining which flight instruments had failed. The aircraft entered a spiral dive from which the pilot, who was likely to have become spatially disoriented, was unable to recover.
* On 18 May 2005, a Jordanian Airbus A320, registration JY-JAR operating for Spanish charter airline LTE suffered a braking malfunction on landing at Leeds Bradford Airport following a flight from Fuerteventura. The aircraft touched down on runway 14 just beyond the touchdown zone, approximately beyond the aiming point. The pilots determined that the rate of deceleration was inadequate and applied full reverse thrust and full manual braking in an effort to stop the aircraft. However, the normal braking system malfunctioned and the Captain turned the aircraft onto a level grassed area to the right of the runway where it came to rest. There were no injuries to the passengers or crew. However, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch made seven safety recommendations in the final accident report.
* On 20 October 2023, a TUI Airways Boeing 737-800, registration G-TAWD skidded off the runway while attempting to land on runway 14 in heavy rain caused by Storm Babet. No injuries were reported but the airport subsequently closed while the aircraft was recovered. The airport reopened on 21 October 2023.

== Criticism ==
* In 2022, it was found that Leeds Bradford Airport had exceeded the number of nightly flights allowance of 2,800 during BST (British Summer Time) by 747, between March and October. Following on from this in 2023, it was rumoured that there had been an application for unlimited night flights. The airport denied this saying they wanted exceptions for quieter aircraft and emergency flights. However, protesters have said that this could easily lead to unlimited night flights.
* During summer of 2022, when the rush for summer getaways started after Covid, LBA was one of the worst for security queues, due to a combination of lack of staff and flights going back to pre pandemic levels. This caused passengers to be queuing out of the terminal in the early hours of the morning and having to be pulled out of the queue in order to make it in time for flights. Within all the mayhem, passengers turned up for flights several hours earlier than needed causing more chaos.
* In December 2022, it was found that Leeds Bradford Airport had been providing unacceptable service to disabled passengers with unduly delays throughout their airport journey. These findings were published in CAA latest reports. The airport has since spent £500,000 on new airport wheelchairs.
* As of November 2024, GALBA (Group for Action on Leeds Bradford Airport) claims that Leeds Bradford Airport has failed to limit the number of night flights during the summer season for the third consecutive year.

<text>The Embassy of the United States of America in Ottawa () is the diplomatic mission of the United States of America to Canada. Opened in 1999, the embassy complex is located at 490 Sussex Drive in Ottawa, Ontario.

==Former chancery==

Before 1999, the diplomatic mission occupied a 1930s-era building at 100 Wellington Street, directly across from Parliament Hill. The Beaux-Arts structure was designed by Cass Gilbert and opened in 1932 as an American legation (full ambassador status was with the Embassy of the United States in London at the time), then as a full embassy after 1943.

The Wellington Street building, a three-storey Indiana limestone structure built in 1930–1931, proved to be too small, however, and embassy employees were spread between eight other Ottawa buildings. Security concerns associated with this distribution necessitated centralization.

The road to a new chancery was a long and difficult one, with attempts made at getting a new structure beginning in the 1960s. Finding an appropriate site and receiving acceptance from both governments proved to be difficult; one proposal to build the embassy in Rockcliffe Park, near the Canada Aviation Museum, was opposed by locals who worried about security threats and congestion. The former chancery is now the Indigenous Peoples Space, dedicated to the indigenous peoples of Canada.

==New embassy==

The new embassy is located on what used to be a small hill and parking lot on the western edge of the ByWard Market. Early in Ottawa&#x27;s history, it had been the site of a number of small homes and businesses, but the land was expropriated by the federal government during the World War I and a temporary office building was built on the site for government workers. The building was torn down after the war, but another temporary structure was built on the site during World War II. This structure survived until 1972, when it was razed and left as a parking lot.

To the west of the embassy is Major&#x27;s Hill Park and Parliament Hill. The National Gallery of Canada is just to the northwest of the embassy, while the Peacekeeping Monument is to the north. To the east of the embassy is the Byward Market, and York Street is steps to the south.
The building&#x27;s design, by American architect David Childs of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, sought to reflect the close relationship of friendly neighbors, symbolizing a bridge.

The embassy&#x27;s interior, showcasing the art of 59 artists from the United States, is organized as two &quot;bars&quot; of office space, joined by an atrium in the center, visible as the tall structure seen from the outside. The design of the building took several years. The architect spoke about the challenge presented by the design project in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. It forced him, he said, to move the atrium to the center of the building, and the glass wall facing Sussex Drive, which had been intended as a fully transparent curtain wall, would now disguise a concrete blast wall with smaller windows punctuating the concrete. Interior furnishings in the atrium area feature &quot;Niagara blue&quot; a color chosen to &quot;reflect the shared experience, close relationship and free trade association between the United States and Canada — Niagara blue because of the shared beauty of Niagara Falls.&quot;

The embassy was dedicated by President Bill Clinton on October 8, 1999, the first time in American history that a president had personally dedicated a new embassy. The building was included amongst other architecturally interesting and historically significant buildings in Doors Open Ottawa, held on June 2 and 3, 2012.

==Controversy==
Local architects and citizens complained that the structure overshadowed the historic market and suggested that it looked like a battleship, or worried about the danger posed to local businesses by potential terrorist attacks against the embassy. These complaints were aggravated after the September 11 attacks, when a number of roads around the embassy were blocked, congesting traffic and hurting businesses. The immediately adjacent lane on Sussex Drive was permanently closed.

Security concerns voiced by the Bureau of Diplomatic Security before the completion of construction were overruled by its parent agency, the U.S. Department of State. In the aftermath of the 1998 embassy bombings in East Africa, there was serious consideration given at the time about whether the new U.S. Embassy should be completed, especially considering the large amount of glass on one side of the new Chancery that faced a public street.

<text>Surrender to the Air was a free jazz ensemble led by Trey Anastasio of Phish that included Marshall Allen, Damon Choice, and Michael Ray of the Sun Ra Orchestra, John Medeski, Marc Ribot, Oteil Burbridge, Jon Fishman, and several other musicians.

The group performed two concerts at the Academy of Music In New York City in April 1996 and disbanded shortly thereafter. The concerts, like the group&#x27;s sole album, consisted of completely improvised music.

Around the time of the group&#x27;s formation, Anastasio mentioned in interviews that he based the ensemble around Sun Ra&#x27;s free jazz ensembles of the mid-twentieth century. &quot;A lot of times, I think he was the pinnacle,&quot; said Anastasio. &quot;He was as good as it got. His values remained pure for his entire life, and there&#x27;s something to be said for that.&quot;

<text>The Museum of Lancashire is a museum with several historic collections in Preston in Lancashire, England. The museum, which is based in the old Sessions House, is a Grade II listed building.

==History==
Construction of the courthouse, which was commissioned to accommodate meetings of the nisi prius court and the quarter sessions, began in 1825. It was designed by Thomas Rickman in the Neo-Classical style.. Baines&#x27; 1825 History and Directory of Lancashire comments that, &#x27;The prison is on a very large scale, but the Court-house, which is inconveniently situated in the centre of the building, is not sufficiently commodious, and at the general session for the county, held by adjournment on 9 September 1824, the sum of ten thousand pounds was voted by magistrates, for the erection of a new court-house and records office, which are to be placed outside the walls of the present gaol&#x27;. Hewitson, in his History of Preston states that the building was erected in 1829 and refers to Mr Rickman as the architect. He goes on to add that a new dome was added in 1849 and in 1870, due to the dangerous state of the dome it was replaced by a ceiling light. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with five bays facing onto Stanley Street; the central section featured a porch with Doric order columns.

==Collections==
The collections include: Lancashire Through Time (archeological collections etc.), Lancashire at Work (local industries etc.), Lancashire at Play (the Hylda Baker costume collection and Les Dawson, George Formby and Gracie Fields material), Lancashire Goes to War (an atmospheric First World War trench), Lancashire Law and Order (court house material, Lancashire home front and the 14th/20th King&#x27;s Hussars.

==Closure==
In November 2015 it was announced that Lancashire County Council would withdraw funding from five of its museums: Fleetwood Museum, Helmshore Mills Textile Museum, Judges&#x27; Lodgings, Museum of Lancashire and Queen Street Mill because of what the leader of the council described as &quot;the financial challenges facing the county council as we deal with relentless cuts to central government funding combined with rising demand for our services&quot;. They were initially to close at the end of March 2016 but that month were reprieved until September 2016. The Museum closed on 30 September 2016, along with the other four Lancashire museums mentioned above, but remained open for pre-booked school groups. As of 3 June 2017 Lancashire County Council&#x27;s website stated that &quot;Negotiations are underway with a potential new operator. We will keep you updated on progress.&quot;, but by 16 August 2017 that statement had been removed and the website simply stated &quot;Museum of Lancashire is closed except for pre-booked school visits. Schools are still welcome to book all learning sessions.&quot; In July 2019 following approval of an ongoing annual budget of £155,000 to maintain the facility, the leader of Lancashire County Council, Keith Iddon, stated &quot;The &#x27;ultimate ambition&#x27; for the Museum of Lancashire in Preston is for it to reopen&quot;.

<doc id="929962" wikidata="Q7323465" url="?curid=929962" title="Mr. Monopoly">
<text>Mr. Monopoly is the mascot of the board game &quot;Monopoly&quot;. He is depicted as a portly old man with a moustache who wears a morning suit with a bowtie and top hat. In large parts of the world he is known, additionally or exclusively, as the Monopoly Man, &quot;Rich Uncle&quot; Pennybags, Milburn Pennybags, or the Monopoly Guy. He also appears in the related games &quot;Rich Uncle&quot;, &quot;Advance to Boardwalk&quot;, &quot;Free Parking&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Go to Jail&quot;, &quot;Monopoly City&quot;, &quot;Monopoly Junior&quot;, and &quot;Monopoly Deal&quot;.

The character first appeared on Chance and Community Chest cards in U.S. editions of &quot;Monopoly&quot; in 1936. The identity of the character&#x27;s designer, artist Daniel Fox, was unknown until 2013, when a former Parker Brothers executive, Philip Orbanes, was contacted by one of Fox&#x27;s grandchildren.

==History==
The unnamed character made his first appearance outside &quot;Monopoly&quot; in the Parker Brothers&#x27; game &quot;Dig&quot;, released in 1940. He did not receive a name until 1946, when Parker Brothers produced the game &quot;Rich Uncle&quot;, where his likeness appeared on the box lid, instructions, and currency. According to Orbanes, Rich Uncle Pennybags of the American version of Monopoly is modeled after American Progressive Era businessman J. P. Morgan.

Between 1985 and 2008, the character appeared in the second &quot;O&quot; in the word &quot;Monopoly&quot; as part of the game&#x27;s logo. More recently, he is depicted over the word &quot;Monopoly&quot;, drawn in a 3-D style, extending his right hand. However, he no longer appears uniformly on every Monopoly game box.

In 1988, Orbanes published the first edition of his book &quot;The Monopoly Companion&quot;. In the book, all of the characters that appear on the &quot;Monopoly&quot; board or within the decks of cards received a name. Uncle Pennybags&#x27; full name was given as Milburn Pennybags, the character &quot;In Jail&quot; is named &quot;Jake, the Jailbird&quot;, and the police officer on Go to Jail is named &quot;Officer Mallory&quot;.

In 1999, Rich Uncle Pennybags was renamed Mr. Monopoly. That year, a &quot;Monopoly Jr.&quot; CD-ROM game was released in cereal boxes as part of a General Mills promotion. It introduced Mr. Monopoly&#x27;s niece and nephew, Sandy and Andy.

According to the book, &quot;Monopoly: The World&#x27;s Most Famous Game &amp; How It Got That Way&quot; and &quot;The Monopoly Companion&quot;, Mr. Monopoly has a second nephew named Randy, although the &quot;Monopoly Companion&quot; mistakenly refers to Sandy as a boy. &quot;Monopoly: The World&#x27;s Most Famous Game &amp; How It Got That Way&quot; also states that Mr. Monopoly has a wife named Madge. He is named as the sixth richest fictional character in the 2006 &quot;Forbes Fictional 15&quot; list on its website and the ninth richest in 2011.

==Legacy==
In 2017, a staff member of the activist group Public Citizen who dressed as Mr. Monopoly with an added monocle gained Internet and media attention by photobombing the CEO of Equifax during a US Senate hearing relating to that credit bureau&#x27;s data security breach from earlier that same year. It was an attempt to bring attention to the use of &quot;forced arbitration&quot; to circumvent consumers&#x27; rights to sue financial companies in court.

While Google CEO Sundar Pichai testified before Congress on December 11, 2018, a person costumed in a white mustache and black bowler hat as the Monopoly Man was among those seated behind him.

On September 12, 2023, Ian Madrigal again dressed as the Monopoly Man following Kent Walker, the President of Global Affairs at Alphabet Inc., to Google&#x27;s antitrust trial &quot;United States v. Google LLC&quot; (2023) at federal court in Washington, D.C. 

&quot;Clue: Candlestick&quot;, a mystery comic book by Dash Shaw based on the board game &quot;Clue&quot;, features Rich Uncle Pennybags in a cameo. He is referred to as &quot;Milburn.&quot;

Vault Boy, the mascot of the &quot;Fallout&quot; video game series, is based partly on Rich Uncle Pennybags.

A false memory of Mr. Monopoly as wearing a monocle, which he did not do until after this false memory gained traction, is a common instance of the Mandela effect.

==Voices==
In licensed media, primarily including advertisements and video games, Mr. Monopoly has been voiced by several voice actors including Tony Waldman, Tony Pope, Wendell Johnson, Dean Hagopian, Mark Dodson, Larry Moran, Michael Cornacchia, Harry Aspinwall, Paul J. Kinney, Rowell Gormon, Richard Rapp, and Will Ferrell.

<text>Ding () are prehistoric and ancient Chinese cauldrons standing upon legs with a lid and two fancy facing handles. They are one of the most important shapes used in Chinese ritual bronzes. They were made in two shapes: round vessels with three legs and rectangular ones with four, the latter often called &quot;fāng dǐng&quot; (). They were used for cooking, storage, and ritual offerings to the gods or to ancestors.

The earliest recovered examples are ceramic tripods from the Neolithic Peiligang culture, but they are better known from the Chinese Bronze Age, particularly after the Zhou deemphasized the ritual use of &quot;huangjiu&quot; alcohol practiced by the Shang kings. Under the Zhou, the ding and the privilege to perform the associated rituals became symbols of authority. The number of permitted ding varied according to one&#x27;s rank in the Chinese nobility: the Nine Ding of the Zhou kings were a symbol of their rule over all China but were lost by the first emperor, Shi Huangdi in the late 3rd century BCE. Subsequently, imperial authority was represented by the Heirloom Seal of the Realm, carved out of the sacred Heshibi; it was lost at some point during the Five Dynasties after the collapse of the Tang.

==Function and use==
In Chinese history and culture, possession of one or more ancient ding is often associated with power and dominion over the land. Therefore, the ding is often used as an implicit symbolism for power. The term &quot;inquiring of the ding&quot; () is often used interchangeably with the quest for power.

In the early Bronze Age of China, the use of wine and food vessels served a religious purpose. While ding were the most important food vessels, wine vessels were the more prominent ritual bronzes of this time, likely due to the belief in Shamanism and spirit worship. Ding were used to make ritual sacrifices, both human and animal, to ancestors. They varied in size, but were generally quite large, indicating that whole animals were likely sacrificed. The sacrifices were meant to appease ancestors due to the Shang belief that spirits had the capability to affect the world of the living. If the ancestors were happy, the living would be blessed with good fortune.

During the early Western Zhou dynasty, the people underwent a political and cultural change. King Wu of Zhou believed that the Shang people were drunkards. He believed that their over-consumption of wine led their king to lose the Mandate of Heaven, thus leading to the downfall of the Shang dynasty. Because of this belief, food vessels (and ding in particular) replaced wine vessels in importance. Bronze vessels underwent what has been called the &quot;Ritual Revolution.&quot; This theory suggests that because there was a change in decor as well as the types and variations of vessels found in tombs, their function shifted from solely religious to a more secular one. Instead of sacrificing food to appease ancestors, the Zhou used ding to show off the status of the deceased to both the living and spirits. Ding symbolized status. For example, emperors were buried with nine ding, feudal lords with seven, ministers with five, and scholar-bureaucrats with three or one. The vessels served as symbols of authority for the elite far into the Warring States period.

==Form and construction==

Like other ritual bronze shapes, the ding was originally an ordinary ceramic cooking, serving and storage vessel, dating back to the Chinese Neolithic, and ceramic dings continued to be used during and after the period when ceremonial bronze versions were made. From the time of the Shang dynasty in the 2nd millennium BCE, dings were also cast in bronze as high-status &quot;ritual bronzes&quot;, which were often buried in the tomb of their owners for use in the afterlife. This is the period to which the oldest examples of bronze dings date. Inscriptions found on dings and zhongs are used to study bronzeware script.

==Theories on construction==

The most commonly believed bronze vessel casting process of ancient Chinese vessels is the piece mold process. In this process, a model of the finished vessel, complete with décor, is made of clay and left to harden. Next, a negative of this is made by adding a layer of wet clay to the completed model and allowed to harden to the point where it can still be cut away from it. The model would then be shaved down to form the core, which would eventually become the empty interior of the completed vessel. In the final step, the negative layer was replaced around the core; these were held apart by small bronze and copper pieces called chaplets until the molten bronze could be poured into the opening and fill the empty space between the two layers. When the bronze had cooled, the clay would be broken away from the vessel and the process was complete.

A newer variation on the piece mold process was put forth as a way to explain asymmetrical faces on vessels which, as a rule, should be symmetrical. It was proposed that décor was not made on a model and then transferred to the outer mold layer, but that the décor was carved into and built up on the outer, shell layer as the first step. Décor was added in a variety of ways. The first was by simply carving and incising lines into the clay mold layer. The second was to stamp or press an image, inscription, or design into the wet clay. The third was a technique called tube lining. In this technique, soft, liquid clay would be put into a leather bag and piped onto a surface through some kind of very fine tube made of metal or bone. This technique would have been quite intensive, as it was difficult to maintain constant pressure on the bag, which was needed to create even lines; however, because of certain types of décor, such as thunder or quill patterns, this would have been the most likely technique used to create low relief design in this process.

==Decoration==
Several common themes in decoration span across all types of vessel forms, from &quot;hu&quot; to &quot;pan&quot;, and &quot;guang&quot; to &quot;jia&quot;. Arguably, the most frequent, though also the most intriguing and mysterious, form of décor is the two eyed motif, often referred to as the taotie. This motif can range from as simple as two protruding half spheres in an otherwise featureless plane to as complex as highly detailed mask-like faces with various animal features such as snouts, fangs and horns. In ding vessels, these taotie faces most often appear on the bowl or cauldron portion of the body, but they can also appear on the legs of the vessels.

Decoration also tends to be used to fill in the background of most vessels, sometimes across the entire body of a vessel, but in other instances only a single band of décor is used. In these backgrounds, a whirl or thunder pattern, a low relief spiral design, is used to fill the space and create a texture across the surface of the vessel.

In later centuries, fully formed three-dimensional animal figures, such as cows, goats, birds, dragons, and lions, were occasionally included on bronze vessels. Some of these animals were purely decorative, while others also had a functional purpose. In one example, the lid of a Li Ding has three lions lying in relaxed positions, holding rings in their mouths; these rings could have been used to lift the lid off of the vessel when it was hot.

A final type of decoration, used in most types of vessels, is the inscription. Inscriptions could be used to identify owner and function; they could be poems or even stories. In one example, the Shi Wang Ding, the inscription is used to tell the story of why the ding was created, as well as make a wish for the lineage of the family who owned it. The Grand Captain&#x27;s young son Captain Wang says:
&quot;Illustriously august deceased-father Duke Jiu was beautifully capable of making accordant his heart and making wise his virtue, with which he served the past kings, and gained purity without flaw. Wang for the first time has gone on to emulate his august deceased-father, respectfully morning and night taking out and bringing in the king&#x27;s commands, not daring not to follow through or to manage. Because of this, the king has not forgotten the sagely man&#x27;s descendant, and has greatly praised his accomplishments and awarded him beneficence. Wang dares in response to extol the Son of Heaven&#x27;s illustriously fine beneficence, herewith making for my august deceased-father Duke Jiu this offertory caldron; may Captain Wang for ten thousand years have sons&#x27; sons and grandsons&#x27; grandsons eternally to treasure and use it.&quot;

==Historical development==
One of the many types of bronze vessels, the ding vessel had its origins in standard ceramic vessels with the shape of a tripod. A bronze ding vessel from Panlongcheng, Huangpi, Hubei, for example, inherits its shape from Neolithic pottery. Perhaps the most famous ancient dings were the legendary Nine Tripod Cauldrons. This set of bronze vessels is said to have been cast by King Yu of the Xia dynasty when he divided his territory into the &quot;Jiuzhou&quot; or Nine Provinces. Later on, possession of all nine was considered a sign of rightful authority over all. The whereabouts of the nine dings are presently unknown, but they are said to have been lost during the imperial Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE), having been passed through various royal dynasties and feudal states.

Ding vessels were used throughout the Shang and Zhou dynasties and later time periods. Round, tripod ding vessels are emblematic of the Shang and Western and Eastern Zhou periods. Western Zhou ding vessels departed from the Shang aesthetic in terms of their oddly-proportioned legs that were deliberately emphasized through the addition of flanged taotie motifs. In terms of their significance throughout history, bronze vessels came to assume a more political role in later dynasties than in the Shang period. Inscriptions cast on Western Zhou ding vessels, for example, commemorate political events and record gifts between monarchs and subjects. The Da Ke ding records a royal award to Ke of royal estate, which is seen as evidence of the breaking up of the estates of old families and their distribution to new families in the transition between different time periods.
In Late Western Zhou, sets of ding and gui were used to indicate rank; a feudal lord would be entitled to nine ding and six gui, while lesser officials were entitled to a smaller number of vessels. Likewise, late Zhou bronzes were often very large, suggesting corresponding wealth. Early Eastern Zhou bronzes descended directly from those of Western Zhou. In later times, in the middle Warring States period, the three-legged ding would be one of the most popular ceramic forms imitating bronzes.

In western China in an area controlled by Qin, small, shallow tripod ding vessels were produced. For these vessels, groups of ceramic and bronze vessels buried together reveal that Western Zhou vessel types continued to exist over different time periods. Tombs at Baoji and Hu Xian, for example, contain sets of ding among others that are shallow and have cabriole legs. The role of ding vessels in the Zhou period continued, as Qin cemeteries contained ding vessels that expressed rank.

Food vessels such as the &quot;fu&quot; (簠), &quot;gui&quot; (簋), and &quot;dui&quot; (敦) that were popular in the Zhou era disappeared by the Han dynasty, during which the &quot;ding&quot;, &quot;zhong&quot; (钟), &quot;hu&quot; (壶), and &quot;fang&quot; were the main vessel types used. In Western and Eastern Han, the ding was one of the most common bronze-derived shapes in pottery.

Today, the architecture of the Shanghai Museum is intended to resemble a bronze ding.

<doc id="929969" wikidata="Q141340" url="?curid=929969" title="Kiribati at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Kiribati competed in the Summer Olympic Games for the first time at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athen, from August 13–29, 2004. The country sent three representatives to the games: two in athletics and one in weightlifting. As of 2012, Meamea Thomas has the best finish of any I-Kiribati athlete in Olympic history. Kiribati did not win medals at these Games.

==Background==
The 2004 Olympics were Kiribati&#x27;s first games, along with East Timor. Kiribati had interest in Olympic participation in the 1980s, and the country later formed their National Olympic Committee (NOC) in 2002, which was recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 2003.

Weightlifter Meamea Thomas was the flagbearer for the Opening Ceremonies. During the ceremony, the men wore grass skirts with braided hair belts. Kaitinano Mwemweata wore a skirt of coconut leaves with a woven grass top. For the closing ceremonies, Mwemweata was the flagbearer.

==Athletics ==

Both athletes did not know they were going to compete until a couple of weeks prior to the Olympics. A competitor broke their foot, and another&#x27;s fear of flying prevented their trip to the Games, opening up two spots for I-Kiribati athletes. The I-Kiribati athletes had to travel to Australia early so they could learn how to use starting blocks.

Kakianako Nariki&#x27;s competed in his first and only Olympics. Nariki was afraid of being disqualified because there were false starts in his heat. He ended up finishing seventh in his heat, with a time of 11.62, beating disqualified athlete Marc Burns.

Kaitinano Mwemweata competed in the women&#x27;s 100 meter dash. She finished the race with a time of 13.07 seconds, a personal best she was excited about. She finished seventh in her heat, failing to advance to the next round.

===Key===
===Men===
===Women===
==Weightlifting ==

Although Meamea Thomas won gold in the men&#x27;s −85 kg in the Oceania Championships, he did not automatically qualify and later received a wildcard entry.

Thomas competed in the men&#x27;s −85 kg weightlifting competition, finishing 17th in the snatch and 13th in the clean and jerk. Overall, he finished 13th out of 21 competitors. As of the 2012 Olympics, Meamea Thomas has the highest finish of any I-Kiribati athlete in Olympic history.

<text>Diagnoses of autism have become more frequent since the 1980s, which has led to various controversies about both the cause of autism and the nature of the diagnoses themselves. Whether autism has mainly a genetic or developmental cause, and the degree of coincidence between autism and intellectual disability, are all matters of current scientific controversy as well as inquiry. There is also more sociopolitical debate as to whether autism should be considered a disability on its own.

== Epidemiology ==
The current accepted prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are around 1%, although previous research has shown far lower rates of incidence. ASD averages a 4.3:1 male-to-female ratio. The number of children on the autism spectrum has increased dramatically since the 1980s, at least partly due to changes in diagnostic practice; it is unclear whether prevalence has actually increased; and as-yet-unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out. The risk of autism is associated with several prenatal factors, including advanced parental age and diabetes in the mother during pregnancy. ASD is associated with several genetic disorders and epilepsy.

==Genetics==

The role of genetic influence on ASD has been heavily researched over the past few years. ASD is considered to have polygenic traits since there is not a single risk factor, but multiple ones.

Multiple twin and family studies have been conducted in order to observe any genetic influence in diagnosing ASD. The chance of both twins having ASD was significantly higher in identical twins than fraternal twins, concluding that ASD is heritable. A reoccurring finding is that &quot;de novo&quot; (new mutation) copy number variants (CNVs) are a primary cause of ASD – they alter synaptic functions; germ line mutations can produce &quot;de novo&quot; CNVs. These mutations can only be passed on to offspring; this explains the phenomenon that occurs when the child has symptoms of ASD, but the parents have no symptoms or history of ASD. &quot;De novo&quot; variants differ from person to person, i.e. one variant can cause ASD in one person, whereas another person would need multiple variants to cause the same disorder. Loss of function variants occur in 16-18% of ASD diagnoses, which is nearly double the normal population. These loss of function variants reduce function in the protein neurexin, which connects neurons at the synapse and is important for neurological development; deletion mutations of neurexin are also very common in people with autism, as well as other neurological disorders like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and ADHD.

There is also controversy over the Nature vs. Nurture debate. According to family studies, genetic and environmental factors have an equal influence on risk of ASD.

==Bacteria==

Gut microbiome has a relation to ASD. Excessive &quot;Clostridia&quot; spp. was found in children with ASD and gastrointestinal difficulties; &quot;Clostridia&quot; spp produces propionic acid, which is impaired or in excess in people with ASD. Specifically, &quot;C. tetani&quot; and &quot;C. histolyticum&quot; are two species of this bacteria that affect people with ASD. &quot;C. tetani&quot; produces tetanus neurotoxin in the intestinal tract; &quot;C. histolyticum&quot; is a toxin producer that is abundant in people diagnosed with ASD. Both of these could contribute to neurological symptoms.

==Vaccines==
A later-retracted article from &quot;The Lancet&quot; making false claims provoked concern about vaccines among parents. Its author was found to be on the payroll of litigants against vaccine manufacturers.

The idea of a link between vaccines and autism was extensively investigated and shown to be false. The scientific consensus is that there is no relationship, causal or otherwise, between vaccines and incidence of autism, and vaccine ingredients do not cause autism.

Nevertheless, the anti-vaccination movement continues to promote myths, conspiracy theories and misinformation linking the two. A developing tactic appears to be the &quot;promotion of irrelevant research [as] an active aggregation of several questionable or peripherally related research studies in an attempt to justify the science underlying a questionable claim.&quot;

==Intelligence==
The percentage of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for intellectual disability has been reported as anywhere from 25% to 70%, a wide variation illustrating the difficulty of assessing autistic intelligence. For pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), the association with intellectual disability is much weaker. The diagnosis of Asperger syndrome excludes clinically significant delays in mental or cognitive skills.

A 2007 study suggested that Raven&#x27;s Progressive Matrices (RPM), a test of abstract reasoning, may be a better indicator of intelligence for autistic children than the more commonly used Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC). Researchers suspected that the WISC relied too heavily on language to be an accurate measure of intelligence for autistic individuals. Their study revealed that the neurotypical children scored similarly on both tests, but the autistic children fared far better on the RPM than on the WISC. The RPM measures abstract, general and fluid reasoning, an ability autistic individuals have been presumed to lack. A 2008 study found a similar effect, but to a much lesser degree and only for individuals with IQs less than 85 on the Wechsler scales.

== Facilitated communication ==

Facilitated communication (FC) is a scientifically discredited technique that attempts to facilitate communication by people with severe educational and communication disabilities. The facilitator holds or gently touches the disabled person&#x27;s arm or hand during this process and attempts to help them move to type on a special keyboard. It was used by many hopeful parents of individuals with autism when it was first introduced during the early 1990s by Douglas Biklen, a professor at Syracuse University.

There is widespread agreement within the scientific community and multiple disability advocacy organizations that FC is not a valid technique for authentically augmenting the communication skills of those with autism spectrum disorder. Instead, research indicates that the facilitator is the source of the messages obtained through FC (involving ideomotor effect guidance of the arm of the patient by the facilitator).&lt;ref name=&quot;Ganz/Katsiyannis/Morin&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, studies have consistently found that patients are unable to provide the correct response to even simple questions when the facilitator does not know the answers to the questions (e.g., showing the patient but not the facilitator an object). In addition, numerous cases have been reported by investigators in which disabled persons were assumed by facilitators to be typing a coherent message while the patient&#x27;s eyes were closed or while they were looking away from or showing no particular interest in the letter board. Despite the evidence opposing FC, many continue to use and promote this technique.

Note that facilitated communication is separate and different from a range of scientifically supported augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices and processes that facilitate communication for people with communication difficulties.

==Advocacy initiatives==

There are two major conceptualizations of autism within autism advocacy. Those who favour the pathology paradigm, which aligns with the medical model of disability, see autism as a disorder to be treated or cured. Those who favor the pathology paradigm argue that atypical behaviors of autistic individuals are detrimental and should therefore be reduced or eliminated through behavior modification therapies. Their advocacy efforts focus primarily on medical research to identify genetic and environmental risk factors in autism. Those who favour the neurodiversity paradigm, which aligns with the social model of disability, see autism as a naturally-occurring variation in the brain. Neurodiversity advocates argue that efforts to eliminate autism should not be compared, for example, to curing cancer, but instead to the antiquated notion of curing left-handedness. Their advocacy efforts focus primarily on acceptance, accommodation, and support for autistic people as &quot;neuro-minorities&quot; in society. These two paradigms are not fully exclusive, and many people hold a combination of these viewpoints.

===Pathology paradigm===
The pathology paradigm is the traditional view of autism through a biomedical lens, in which it is seen as a disorder characterized by various impairments, mainly in communication and social interaction. Those taking this perspective believe that autism is generally a harmful dysfunction. Ways of functioning which diverge from a typical brain are perceived as harmful and disordered and must therefore be treated or cured. The atypical behaviors of autistic individuals are considered a detriment to social and professional success and should therefore be reduced or eliminated through therapy.

Advocates with this view include both a small but significant minority of autistic adults and large majority of parents of autistic children, but contain a higher percentage of parents when compared to those adopting the neurodiversity paradigm. These advocates believe that medical research is necessary to address the rapid rise in autism diagnoses (sometimes referred to as the &quot;autism epidemic&quot;), reduce suffering, and provide the best outcomes for autistic individuals. In addition to etiological research, other areas of focus may include biology, diagnosis, and treatment, including medication, behavioural and psychological interventions, and the treatment of co-existing medical conditions.

Advocacy groups that focus primarily on medical research include Autism Speaks, the Autism Science Foundation, and its predecessor organizations, the Autism Coalition for Research and Education, the National Alliance for Autism Research, and Cure Autism Now, and the former Autism Research Institute.

===Neurodiversity paradigm===
The neurodiversity paradigm is a view of autism as a different way of being rather than as a disease or disorder that must be cured. Autistic people are considered to have neurocognitive differences which give them distinct strengths and weaknesses, and are capable of succeeding when appropriately accommodated and supported. The belief is that efforts to eliminate autism should not be compared, for example, to curing cancer but instead to the antiquated notion of curing left-handedness.

There is no leader of the neurodiversity movement and little academic research has been conducted on it as a social phenomenon. As such, proponents of the neurodiversity paradigm have heterogenous beliefs, but are consistent in the view that autism cannot be separated from an autistic person. Advocacy efforts may include accommodations in schools and work environments, lobbying for the inclusion of autistic people when making decisions that affect them, and opposition to therapies that aim to make children &quot;indistinguishable from their peers&quot;.

Neurodiversity advocates are opposed to medical research for a cure, believing that it will lead to eugenics, and instead support research that helps autistic people thrive as they are. For example, &quot;NeuroTribes&quot; author Steve Silberman noted a lack of research in regards to seizure-controlling drugs and autistic brains; that sensory differences in autistic people were unheard of until Temple Grandin spoke about her experiences; and that only a small percentage of research funding goes towards the needs of autistic adults.

Advocacy groups that focus primarily on acceptance and accommodation include Autism Network International, Autism National Committee, Autistic Self Advocacy Network, and Autistic Women &amp; Nonbinary Network.

<doc id="929982" wikidata="Q370540" url="?curid=929982" title="Pierre de la Rue">
<text>Pierre de la Rue ( – 20 November 1518) was a Franco-Flemish composer and singer of the Renaissance. His name also appears as Piersson or variants of Pierchon and his toponymic, when present, as various forms of de Platea, de Robore, or de Vico. A member of the same generation as Josquin des Prez, and a long associate of the Habsburg-Burgundian musical chapel, he ranks with Agricola, Brumel, Compère, Isaac, Obrecht, and Weerbeke as one of the most famous and influential composers in the Netherlands polyphonic style in the decades around 1500.

==Biography==

===Early life===
La Rue was probably born at Tournai, in modern Belgium, and likely educated at the Notre-Dame Cathedral there, which had a substantial musical establishment. He may have been the son of Jean de la Rue, a master &quot;enlumineur&quot; of the town of Tournai.

While no records remain of his childhood, a Peter vander Straten (the Flemish equivalent of his name) is mentioned in the archives of the cathedral of Ste. Gudule in Brussels in 1469–1470, as an adult (tenor) singer; this is considered very likely to have been him. In 1471 he was in Ghent at the Jacobskerk as a part-time singer, paid from the cathedral&#x27;s miscellaneous fund, suggesting he was brought in for special performances of polyphony. Subsequently, he was employed in Nieuwpoort in 1472, at the church of Onze-Lieve-Vrouw, probably initially as a temporary arrangement, but by the end of the year the church authorities hired him on a more permanent basis. He was no longer employed there by 1477/8 for his name had vanished from the account-book.

His whereabouts during the 1480s are not very well known, although there is a record that he worked at a place called &quot;St Ode&quot; (date and city not known), and also possibly at the cathedral at Cambrai. Previous biographies of La Rue place him in Siena, Italy, between 1483 and 1485; however, it has been determined that the &quot;La Rue&quot; in the records there was a different singer. Pierre de la Rue probably never went to Italy, making him one of the few prominent Franco-Flemish composers of this generation never to travel there.

In 1489 he was paid by the Confraternity of the Illustre Lieve Vrouwe in &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch, again as &quot;Peter vander Straten&quot;, and the document indicates that he had come from Cologne, so he evidently had spent some time in Germany as a tenor singer. He remained at the Confraternity in &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch until 1492, at which time he simultaneously became a full member of the Confraternity, and joined the &quot;Grande chapelle&quot; of Holy Roman Emperor Maxmilian. He was to remain in the employ of the Habsburgs, and the &quot;Grande chapelle&quot;, for the rest of his life.

===The &quot;Grande chapelle&quot;===
The &quot;Grande chapelle&quot;, the musical establishment of the Burgundian-Habsburg court, already had a distinguished history by the time Philip the Handsome inherited it in 1494. This was the central institution of the Burgundian School, the venue in which composers such as Dufay and Busnois had worked and already left a body of music; music by Ockeghem had also recently been copied into manuscripts associated with the group immediately before La Rue&#x27;s hire. In addition, music by the composers favored by the previous dukes of Burgundy such as Charles the Bold – Adrien Basin, Gilles Joye, Hayne van Ghizeghem, and Robert Morton – was also probably still being performed and studied. It was a formidable musical organization, equalling in quality the papal chapel in Rome itself, and its quality continued to improve into the 16th century, with the addition of composers such as Marbrianus de Orto, Nicolas Champion, Gilles Reingot, Antonius Divitis, and Alexander Agricola. This was the musical environment into which La Rue entered his full maturity as a composer.

Once La Rue was engaged with the &quot;Grande chapelle&quot;, he made two trips to Spain. On the second trip, in 1506, he was shipwrecked in the English Channel, and spent three months at the court of Henry VII of England. After two more years in Spain, in the service of Juana of Castile – Joanna the Mad – he returned to the Netherlands in 1508, probably because Juana had been forced out of power (her husband, Philip, had died of typhus in 1506). Juana was inconsolable, unable to leave the corpse of her dead husband, and had become quite insane; why La Rue stayed as long as he did is not known, but it is not impossible that his dark, intensely expressive music was one of the few things that brought her solace. In addition, he was treated well. Juana promoted him to &quot;premier chapelain&quot;, the head of the chapel, and paid him twice what the other singers received; paying the singers was apparently one of the only practical administrative matters she was able to do during the period of her madness.

On his travels with the &quot;Grande chapelle&quot; he met many of the other Franco-Flemish composers who were working at the same time (for instance, Josquin, Isaac and Robert de Févin) and these meetings may also have proved decisive in the development of his style.

===Retirement and death===
Between 1508 and 1514, the court stayed at Mechelen and Brussels, rarely traveling. These are hypothesized to be the most productive years for La Rue as a composer, since he would have had the most free time, and spared the rigors of travel across Europe. Shortly after Charles V came of age in 1515, the court resumed its travels; La Rue retired shortly after a huge tour of all the cities in the northern portions of Charles&#x27; empire. Likely he left his job during one of the chapel&#x27;s visits to Kortrijk, in May or June 1516. He remained there until his death a little more than two years later. While his epitaph alludes to the possibility that he may have worked at the courts in France and Hungary at some time, no other corroborating evidence has been found; however there remain biographical gaps in the 1470s and 1480s: for example, the location of &quot;St Ode&quot; is not yet known.

La Rue was relatively wealthy when he died, especially for a singer who was not an aristocrat, and details of his will and the subsequent events surrounding its disposition survive in detail. Not only did his executors find chests of money in his lodgings, but he had considerable income from his prebends, which he distributed to many places, including relatives, charities, choirs, institutions; and he arranged for requiem masses to be sung every day for the month after his death, and a further 300 masses to be sung afterwards, in several different cathedrals. He asked to be buried on the left side of the altar in the church in Kortrijk, although the exact location can no longer be found, and the epitaph only survives in several partially contradictory copies. His epitaph indicates he was a thrifty, virtuous person, not &quot;given to the crimes of Venus&quot; (as, for example, composer Nicolas Gombert, who was sent to the galleys for molesting a choirboy, Ghiselin Danckerts, who was fired from the Sistine Chapel choir for being excessively &quot;given to women&quot;, or Gilles Joye, who wrote a mass based on the name of his favorite prostitute). La Rue seems to have been appreciated and well liked by his colleagues throughout his career.

==Music==

===General character===
La Rue wrote masses, motets, Magnificats, settings of the Lamentations, and chansons, a diverse range of compositions reflective of his status as the primary composer at one of Europe&#x27;s most renowned musical institutions, surrounded by other similarly creative people. Some scholars have suggested that he composed music only during the last 20 years of his life, mainly when he was in the imperial service; but it has proven difficult to date any of his works precisely, although it has been possible to suggest groupings based on a rough chronology. Stylistically, his works are more similar to those of Josquin than to those of any other composer working at the same time. In fact, misattribution of doubtful works has gone both ways.

Yet there are some unique features of La Rue&#x27;s style. He had a liking for extreme low voice ranges, descending sometimes to C or even the subterranean B flat below the bass staff; he employed more chromaticism than most of his contemporaries; and much of his work is rich in dissonance. He also broke up long, dense textures by inserting contrasting passages for two voices only, something done also by Ockeghem and Josquin. He was one of the first routinely to expand vocal forces from the standard four, to five or six. One of his masses for six voices, the &quot;Missa Ave sanctissima Maria&quot;, is a six-voice canon, a technically difficult feat reminiscent of some of the work of Ockeghem. This is also the earliest six-voice mass known to exist.

Canonic writing is a particularly important feature of La Rue&#x27;s style, for which he has been particularly celebrated. He liked to write canons of considerable complexity, rather than restrict himself to simple imitation. The second of his two masses based on the L&#x27;homme armé tune begins and ends with mensuration canons, canons in which all the voices sing the same material, but at different tempi; this is yet another feat of contrapuntal virtuosity worthy of Josquin or Ockeghem; indeed La Rue sometimes seemed to be in conscious competition with the more renowned Josquin. The closing Agnus Dei of this mass is the only known mensuration canon of the entire era for four voices, with all four voices singing the same tune. La Rue wrote six pieces that are completely canonic from start to finish, including two masses, three motets and a chanson; he wrote three more masses, two motets, and three chansons which are based on canon but contain some free sections; numerous other works include canonic sections. In his use of canons, he may have been influenced by Matthaeus Pipelare, who wrote an early canonic mass La Rue almost certainly knew, since it was part of the repertory of the Habsburg court chapel.

===Masses===
La Rue was one of the first to use the parody technique thoroughly, permeating the texture of a mass with music drawn from all voices of a pre-existing source. Some of his masses use cantus firmus technique, but rarely strictly; he often preferred the paraphrase technique, in which the monophonic source material is embellished and migrates between voices.

La Rue wrote one of the earliest polyphonic Requiem Masses to survive, and it is one of his most famous works. Unlike later Requiems, it includes polyphonic settings of only the Introit, Kyrie, Tract, Offertory, Sanctus, Agnus, and Communion – the Dies Iræ, often the center of gravity in more recent Requiems, was a later addition. This was the normal liturgical practice in Gallican France and the region of northern Europe in which he worked. This mass, more than many others, emphasises the low registers of voices, and even the lowest voices themselves.

===Motets and chansons===
Twenty-five motets by La Rue survive, being mostly for four voices. While they use imitation, the technique is more likely to occur within sections and phrases rather than at their openings, unlike in the style of Josquin. Another stylistic feature characteristic of La Rue&#x27;s motets is the use of ostinatos, which may be a single note, an interval, or a series of notes. In addition he uses germinal motifs – small easily recognizable patterns from which larger melodic units are derived, and which give unity to a composition. Overall the motets are complex contrapuntally, with the individual lines having a distinctive character, in the manner of Ockeghem. This is most true in the early works which were likely influenced by the older composer.

More than half of the motets are on the subject of the Virgin Mary. La Rue was the first composer to write a Magnificat on each of the eight tones, and additionally wrote six separate settings of the Marian antiphon &quot;Salve regina&quot;. Most likely these are early works.

===Chansons===
His thirty chansons show a diversity of style, some being akin to the late Burgundian style (for example, as seen in the works of Hayne van Ghizeghem or Gilles Binchois), and of others using a more current imitative polyphonic style. Since La Rue never spent time in Italy, he did not employ the Italian frottola style which featured light, homophonic textures (which Josquin used so effectively in his popular &quot;El Grillo&quot; and &quot;Scaramella&quot;), and which so charmed the other members of his generation.

<text>Dumbarton Oaks, formally the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection, is a historic estate in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C. It was the residence and gardens of wealthy U.S. diplomat Robert Woods Bliss and his wife Mildred Barnes Bliss. The estate was founded by the Bliss couple, who gave the home and gardens to Harvard University in 1940.

In 1944, it was the site of the Dumbarton Oaks Conference, which developed plans for the founding of the United Nations following World War II. The part of the landscaped portion of the estate that was designed as an enhanced &quot;natural&quot; area, was given to the National Park Service and is now Dumbarton Oaks Park.

The research institute that has emerged from the bequest to Harvard is dedicated to supporting scholarship in the fields of Byzantine and Pre-Columbian studies, as well as garden design and landscape architecture through its research fellowships, meetings, exhibitions, and publications. It also opens its garden and museum collections to the public, and hosts public lectures and a concert series. Dumbarton Oaks is distinct from Dumbarton House, a Federal Style historic house museum also located in the Georgetown area.

==History==
===Early history===
The land of Dumbarton Oaks was formerly part of the Rock of Dumbarton grant that Queen Anne made in 1702 to Colonel Ninian Beall (ca. 1625-1717). Around 1801, William Hammond Dorsey (1764–1818) built the first house on the property (the central block of the existing structure) and an orangery. Edward Magruder Linthicum (1787–1869) greatly enlarged the residence in the mid-nineteenth century and named it The Oaks. The Oaks also was the Washington residence of Senator and Vice President John C. Calhoun (1782–1850) between 1822 and 1829.

In 1846, Edward Linthicum bought the house and enlarged it. Henry F. Blount bought it in 1891.

===Bliss era===
Mildred and Robert Woods Bliss acquired the property in 1920, and in 1933 they gave it the name of Dumbarton Oaks, combining its two historic names. The Blisses engaged the architect Frederick H. Brooke (1876–1960) to renovate and enlarge the house (1921–1923), thereby creating a Colonial Revival residence from the existing Linthicum-era Italianate structure. Over time, the Blisses increased the grounds to approximately and engaged the landscape architect Beatrix Farrand (1872–1959) to design a series of terraced gardens and a wilderness on this acreage, in collaboration with Mildred Bliss (1921–1947). The Blisses&#x27; architectural additions to the estate included four service court buildings (1926) and a music room (1928), designed by Lawrence Grant White (1887–1956) of the New York City architectural firm of McKim, Mead and White, the superintendent&#x27;s dwelling (1933), designed by Farrand. Later renamed the Fellows Building, this building is now known as the Guest House.

After retiring to Dumbarton Oaks in 1933, the Blisses immediately began laying the groundwork for the creation of a research institute. They greatly increased their already considerable collection of artworks and reference books, forming the nucleus of what would become the Research Library and Collection. In 1938 they engaged the architect Thomas Tileston Waterman (1900–1951) to build two pavilions to house their Byzantine Collection and an 8,000-volume library, and in 1940 gave Dumbarton Oaks (which included about of land) to Harvard University, Robert Bliss&#x27;s alma mater. At the same time they gave a portion of the grounds—some 27 acres—to the National Park Service to establish the Dumbarton Oaks Park.

In 1941, the administrative structure of Dumbarton Oaks, now owned by Harvard University, was modeled according to the following design: the Trustees for Harvard University, composed primarily of the President and Fellows of Harvard College, made all appointments, including those to the Administrative Committee, which in turn would supervise the entire operation and refer to the Trustees such recommendations as may require their action. This committee was first chaired by Paul J. Sachs (1878–1965), Harvard Professor and Associate Director of the Fogg Art Museum, but by 1953 it was chaired by the Dean or Provost and, beginning in 1961 and thereafter, by the President of Harvard University.

In early years the Administrative Committee appointed a Board of Scholars to make recommendations in regard to all scholarly activities. The Board of Scholars was first organized in 1942 (with eleven members, of which seven were from Harvard); its membership was increased to twenty-two members by 1960. In 1952, this board was titled the Board for Scholars in Byzantine Studies. In 1953, a Garden Advisory Committee was created to make recommendations in regard to the garden and, later, to the Garden Library and its Fellows, and in 1963 an Advisory Committee for Pre-Columbian Art was created. The Administrative Committee also historically appointed a Visiting Committee consisting of persons interested in the welfare and broad aims of Dumbarton Oaks. This committee was abolished in 1960 when it was replaced by a Board of Advisors.

Wishing to increase the scholarly mission of Dumbarton Oaks, in the early 1960s the Blisses sponsored the construction of two new wings, one designed by Philip Johnson (1906–2005) to house the Robert Woods Bliss Collection of Pre-Columbian Art and its research library and, the other, a garden library designed by Frederic Rhinelander King (1887–1972), of the New York City architectural firm Wyeth and King, to house the botanical and garden architecture rare books and garden history reference materials that Mildred Bliss had collected.

====Dumbarton Oaks Concerto====
In 1937, Mildred Bliss commissioned Igor Stravinsky (1882–1971) to compose a concerto in the tradition of Bach&#x27;s Brandenburg concertos to celebrate the Blisses&#x27; thirtieth wedding anniversary. Nadia Boulanger (1887–1979) conducted its premiere on May 8, 1938 in the Dumbarton Oaks music room, due to the composer&#x27;s indisposition from tuberculosis. At Mildred Bliss&#x27;s request, the Concerto in E-flat was subtitled &quot;Dumbarton Oaks 8-v-1938,&quot; and the work is now generally known as The Dumbarton Oaks Concerto. Igor Stravinsky conducted the concerto in the Dumbarton Oaks music room on April 25, 1947 and again for the Bliss&#x27;s golden wedding anniversary, on May 8, 1958. He also conducted the first performance of his Septet, which is dedicated to the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection, in the music room on January 24, 1954.

====Dumbarton Oaks Conference====
In the late summer and early fall of 1944, at the height of the Second World War, a series of important diplomatic meetings took place at Dumbarton Oaks, officially known as the Washington Conversations on International Peace and Security Organization. Delegations from China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States deliberated over proposals for the establishment of an organization to maintain peace and security in the world. Their meetings resulted in the United Nations Charter that was adopted in San Francisco in 1945.

===Post-Bliss era===
In the preamble to her last will and testament, Mildred Bliss offered the following assessment of what she and her husband had created at Dumbarton Oaks:

:In applying the gifts to Harvard, I call upon the present and future President and Fellows of Harvard College and all those who determine its policies, to remember that Dumbarton Oaks is conceived in a new pattern, where quality and not number shall determine the choice of its scholars; that it is the home of the Humanities, not a mere aggregation of books and objects of art; that the house itself and the gardens have their educational importance and that all are of humanistic value.

:Those responsible for scholarship at Dumbarton Oaks should remember that the Humanities cannot be fostered by confusing Instruction with Education; that it was my husband&#x27;s as well as it is my wish that the Mediterranean interpretation of the Humanist disciplines shall predominate; that gardens have their place in the Humanist order of life; and that trees are noble elements to be protected by successive generations and are not to be neglected or lightly destroyed. I charge those responsible for carrying forward the life at Dumbarton Oaks to be guided by the standards set there during the lifetime of my husband and me. The distinction of the scholars themselves as well as of their writings; the interpretation of the texts and the arts; the quality of the music performed; the free discussion within the limits of good deportment, and the whole tempered by the serenity of open spaces and ancient trees; all these are as integral a part of Humanism at Dumbarton Oaks as are the Library and the Collections. The fulfillment of this vision of high intellectual adventure seen through the open gates of Dumbarton Oaks will add lustre to Harvard, to the academic tone of our country and to scholarship throughout the world.

To help the institution better fulfill its mandate, administrative changes were slowly introduced after 1969, the year Mildred Bliss died. The Garden Advisory Committee was abolished in 1974 and replaced in 1975 by the Advisory Committee for Studies in Landscape Architecture. In 1975, the Advisory Committee for Pre-Columbian Art similarly was renamed the Advisory Committee for Pre-Columbian Studies. The Board for Scholars in Byzantine Studies was abolished in 1975 and replaced by the Senior Fellows Committee. In 1981, the three advisory groups were uniformly named the Senior Fellows. Beginning in 1979, the Administrative Committee became composed of four members almost always including the President, the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, a senior faculty member of Harvard University, and (until 1994) the Director of Dumbarton Oaks. The Board of Advisors was abolished in 1991.

The institution has continued to be a major sponsor of archaeological excavations and art restoration projects. During the 1970s it funded major fieldwork projects work in Cyprus, Syria, and Turkey, efforts that today span the entire geographical breadth of the former Byzantine commonwealth. Dumbarton Oaks began to fund archaeology in Central and South America in the mid-1990s.

In 2005, Dumbarton Oaks inaugurated a new gardeners&#x27; court and a library, both designed by Robert Venturi (1925–2018) of the Philadelphia architectural firm of Venturi, Scott Brown &amp; Associates. In 2008 the institute also completed an extensive renovation of the main house and museum wing, including restoration of its historic period rooms, several of which were created by the Parisian designer, Armand-Albert Rateau (1882–1938).

==Research==
===Institutional program===
The mission of Dumbarton Oaks is to support and promote scholarship in three areas of study: Byzantine, Pre-Columbian, and garden and landscape architecture. Through a fellowship program, the institute invites scholars from around the world for an academic year or a summer to pursue individual research. A grants program also supports archaeological research, materials analysis, and photographic surveys of objects and monuments. In addition, each studies program sponsors public lectures, symposia, and colloquia as well as scholarly publications including annual journals, symposium proceedings, and occasional monographs.

===Byzantine Studies===
The program in Byzantine Studies, established in 1940, supports scholarship on the civilization of the Byzantine Empire from the fourth to the fifteenth centuries and its interactions with neighboring cultures and civilizations, including the late Roman, early Christian, western medieval, Slavic, and Near Eastern.

===Pre-Columbian Studies===
The program in Pre-Columbian Studies was founded in 1963 to support the study of the art and archaeology of the ancient Americas. The program focuses on the cultures that thrived in the western hemisphere from northern Mexico to southern South America, from the earliest times to the sixteenth century.

===Garden and Landscape Architecture Studies===
Dumbarton Oaks awarded the first fellowship in landscape architecture in 1956 under the provisions of the Dumbarton Oaks Garden Endowment Fund established in 1951 by the Blisses. However, the program in Garden and Landscape Studies (formerly known as Landscape Architecture Studies) was established in 1969 and inaugurated in 1972 to support the study of gardens and the history of landscape architecture around the world from ancient times to the present.

==Museum and collections==

The Dumbarton Oaks Museum features collections of Byzantine and Pre-Columbian art, as well as European artworks and furnishings. Mildred and Robert Woods Bliss initiated these collections in the first half of the twentieth century and provided the vision for future acquisitions even after giving Dumbarton Oaks to Harvard University.

The Byzantine Collection spans the imperial, ecclesiastical, and secular realms and comprises more than 1,200 objects from the fourth to the fifteenth centuries. Although the collection emphasizes objects of precious materials, underscoring the conception of Byzantine art as luxury art, the collection also includes large-scale works such as mosaics from Antioch and relief sculpture, as well as more than two hundred textiles and comprehensive holdings of coins and seals. It owns six manuscripts (see, e.g., Minuscule 705). In addition to its Byzantine holdings, the collection includes Greek, Roman, and western medieval artworks and objects from the ancient Near East, pharaonic and Ptolemaic Egypt, and various Islamic cultures.

The Robert Woods Bliss Collection of Pre-Columbian Art comprises objects from the ancient cultures of Mesoamerica, the Intermediate Area, and the Andes. Among its most important holdings are a variety of sculptures in stone, including carvings of Aztec deities and animals and several large relief panels bearing the likenesses of Maya kings. In addition there are sculpted anthropomorphic figurines and polished jade renderings of ritual objects from the Olmec, Veracruz, and Teotihuacan cultures as well as molded and painted ceramics of the Nasca, Moche, and Wari cultures. Gold and silver objects from the Chavín, Lambayeque, Chimú, and Inca cultures offer evidence of the expertise achieved by Andean metalsmiths, and over forty textiles and works in feathers testify to the importance of fiber arts in this region.

The House Collection consists primarily of Dumbarton Oaks&#x27; historic buildings and interiors, Asian, European, and American artworks, and interior furnishings. Principal to the collection is the renaissance-style Music Room. The ceiling and flooring of this room were inspired by examples at the guardroom of the historic Château de Cheverny near Paris and were fabricated by the Parisian designer, Armand Albert Rateau. The Music Room features displays of tapestries, sculptures, paintings, and furniture dating from the fifteenth to the eighteenth centuries. The Blisses used the room for hosting musical programs and scholarly lectures, and it continues to serve these purposes.

===Philip Johnson Pre-Columbian Pavilion===

In 1959, the Blisses commissioned the New York City architect Philip Johnson to design a pavilion for the Robert Woods Bliss Collection of Pre-Columbian Art. This building—eight domed circular galleries (having an unroofed fountain area at the center) set within a perfect square—recalls Islamic architectural ideas, and Johnson later credited the design to his interest in the early sixteenth-century Turkish architect Mimar Sinan. The pavilion was built in the Copse, one of the designed landscapes at Dumbarton Oaks, and Johnson employed curved glass walls to blend the landscape with the building. He later reminisced that his idea was to fit a small pavilion into an existing treescape, to make the building become part of the Copse. Johnson maintained that he wanted the garden to &quot;march right up to the museum displays and become part of them,&quot; with the plantings brushing the glass walls and the sound of splashing water audible in the central fountain. To further this idea, he incorporated four interior glazed planter areas situated between the galleries and the fountain.

Johnson also believed that the pavilion was to be best enjoyed from the inside. In addition to offering interesting garden views, the eight gallery spaces allow for a well-organized circulation plan. They also provide intimate areas for visitors to enjoy and study the Pre-Columbian objects. Each interconnected exhibition gallery is twenty-five feet in diameter, having curved glass walls supported by cylindrical columns sheathed in Illinois Agatan marble and shallow domes that rise from flat bronze rings. The floors are teak, laid radially and ended by wide rims of mottled green Vermont marble.

== Library ==
The Dumbarton Oaks Research Library contains more than 200,000 items that support the three studies programs. The Byzantine holdings of materials concerning late classical, early Christian, Byzantine, and medieval art and archaeology, which numbered 8,000 volumes at the time of the Blisses&#x27; gift, now number 149,000 volumes with more than 550 journal subscriptions. In 1964, the Research Library acquired Robert Woods Bliss&#x27;s personal collection of 2,000 rare and important works on Pre-Columbian art history, anthropology, and archaeology, which has since grown to more than 32,000 volumes, and Mildred Bliss&#x27;s garden library, including rare volumes and prints, which now includes 27,000 books and pamphlets. The Rare Book Collection has holdings of more than 10,000 volumes, prints, drawings, photographs, and blueprints.

The Rare Book Room, designed by Frederick Rhinelander King in the style of an 18th-century library, was completed in 1963 to house the collection of rare books and drawings which had been started by Mildred Bliss. Her library was enlarged, with advice from Beatrix Farrand, designer of the Dumbarton Oaks garden, once Mrs. Bliss conceived the idea in the 1950s of starting a program of studies in landscape architecture. The Research Library is housed separately from the Rare Book Collection, in a building designed by VSBA architects and completed in 2005.

The collection of books originated in Mrs. Bliss&#x27;s aim to preserve illustrated books from being broken up for individual plates. There are volumes of views which are especially valuable for the study of gardens since few of the sites survive as originally created. For example, Giovanni Battista Falda&#x27;s 17th-century plates showing the gardens of Rome; views of Versailles and other royal gardens in Louis XIV&#x27;s France by Perelle and Sylvestre; and Jan Kip and Leonard Knyff&#x27;s early-18th-century bird&#x27;s-eye views of English country estates. The latter works yield almost the only evidence of the appearance of these geometrical or regular designs before their supplanting by the irregular or &quot;picturesque&quot; taste.

Since landscape architecture grew out of other professions – most obviously, those of architecture, botany and horticulture – the collection also includes treatises by great architectural theorists such as Alberti, Palladio, and Serlio as well as works by such distinguished botanists as Clusius and Linnaeus, or Catesby&#x27;s &quot;Natural History of Carolina&quot;. Books on buildings that served as models for garden structures like pavilions and follies and others relating to the design and decoration of fountains, with the hydraulics necessary for their operation, are included, along with books on sculpture and iconography.

Many volumes in the library describe great gardens or garden practice, for example &#x27;s &quot;The Villas of the Ancients Illustrated&quot; and various editions of Andrew Jackson Downing&#x27;s &quot;A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening&quot;. The collection is also rich in works illustrating flowers and plants – early herbals and botanical writings, floras – works on horticulture, and even agriculture as it affects the life of country estates, such as a 1495 edition of Pietro de&#x27; Crescenzi&#x27;s &quot;Il libro della agricultura&quot;. The herbals represent early attempts to create a coherent system of plant description and are forerunners of today&#x27;s science of taxonomy. Two of them, the &quot;Herbarius Latinus&quot;, printed in Passau in 1486, and the &quot;Hortus Sanitatis&quot;, printed in Mainz in 1491, are among the earliest printed books with woodcut illustrations.

As the science of botany developed, so did the art of plant illustration. Early herbals had simple, not very realistic, woodcut illustrations of plants. By the 17th century new graphic techniques, such as metal plate engraving and etching, permitted highly detailed botanical renderings. These techniques were also used by artists who created the newly popular still lifes of flowers and fruits, and by artisans, such as jewelers, tapestry weavers, and furniture decorators, in pattern books recording their floral designs. The increasing sophistication of techniques of plant illustration in the 18th century culminated in the development of color printing. The library owns copies of works by Redouté, the first artist to exploit fully the potential of color printing of stipple engravings in such renowned books as &quot;Les Roses&quot; or the multi-volume &quot;Liliacées&quot;, and works by other masters of the period, including Georg Dionysius Ehret&#x27;s &quot;Plantae et papiliones rariores&quot;, 1748-1759.

In addition to printed books, there is a collection of manuscripts and drawings covering the same range of topics – a late 17th-century planting plan for an Italian garden; Hans Puechfeldner&#x27;s fine images of late 17th-century mannerist gardens; a number of paintings by oriental artists executed for western patrons to record discoveries of new plants made during the expansion of Europe into the East. The Library owns the original watercolors for Buchoz&#x27;s &quot;Collection des Fleurs dans les Jardins de la Chine&quot; as well as the gouaches by Clara Maria Pope for Samuel Curtis&#x27;s &quot;Beauties of Flora&quot;. Watercolors by Redouté, among other artists, a diminutive late 16th-century manuscript of flower illuminations attributed to &quot;Jacques le Moyne&quot;, and an early Italian manuscript herbal are just some of the library&#x27;s treasures.

The collection continues to be developed. Noteworthy acquisitions from recent years are Francesco Colonna&#x27;s &quot;La Hypnerotomachia di Poliphilo&quot;, 1545 edition; Salomon de Caus&#x27;s &quot;La pratique et demonstration des horloges solaire&quot;, published in Paris in 1624; and Humphry Repton&#x27;s album of 500 engraved views taken from William Peacock&#x27;s &quot;Polite Repository&quot;, arranged by year.

The garden rare book collection is both a unique tool for historical inquiry and a testimony to the enduring human delight in gardens and garden creation, which is, as Sir Francis Bacon wrote, &quot;the Purest of Humane pleasures.&quot; It was a claim echoed by Mrs. Bliss, whose testimony to the value of gardens and scholarship is inscribed upon the exterior walls of her library.

== Image Collections and Fieldwork Archives ==
The Image Collections and Fieldwork Archives hold more than 500,000 images in a variety of formats, the majority of which are of Byzantine subject matter. Photographs and archival collections supporting pre-Columbian and garden and landscape studies are being developed.

== Garden ==

In 1921, the Blisses hired landscape gardener Beatrix Farrand to design the garden at Dumbarton Oaks, and for almost thirty years Mildred Bliss collaborated closely with Farrand. Together they transformed the existing farmlands surrounding the house into terraced garden rooms and vistas, creating a garden landscape that progressed from formal and elegant stepped terraces, in the near vicinity of the house, to a more recreational and practical middle zone of pools, tennis court, orchards, vegetable beds, and cutting gardens, and concluding at the far reaches of the property with a rustic wilderness of meadows and stream. Within the garden rooms, Bliss and Farrand used a careful selection of plant materials and garden ornaments to define the rooms&#x27; character and use. Since that time, other architects working with Mildred Bliss—most notably Ruth Havey and Alden Hopkins—changed certain elements of the Farrand design.

The garden at Dumbarton Oaks was first opened to the public in 1939.
The Dumbarton Oaks Park is a 27-acre naturalistic streamside valley park, maintained as a part of Rock Creek Park.
== Events ==

=== Music at Dumbarton Oaks ===
In 1946, Dumbarton Oaks inaugurated the Friends of Music concerts to offer a yearly chamber music subscription series in the music room. This series was based on the similar Friends of Music at the Library of Congress, of which Mildred Bliss was a long-time member. In 1958, Dumbarton Oaks commissioned Aaron Copland (1900–1990) to compose Nonet for Solo Strings (generally known as Nonet for Strings) in honor of the Blisses&#x27; fiftieth wedding anniversary. Nadia Boulanger conducted its world premier with nine members of the National Symphony Orchestra on March 2, 1961. Copland dedicated the piece &quot;to Nadia Boulanger after forty years of friendship.&quot; In 2006, Dumbarton Oaks commissioned Joan Tower to compose Dumbarton Quintet, which was premiered in the music room on April 12, 2008, with the composer at the piano. In 2017 the series was renamed Music at Dumbarton Oaks.

=== Public lectures ===
Public lectures are offered regularly, held in the Oak Room of the Fellowship House. The lectures are noted for presenting recent discoveries or innovative scholarship that command public interest.

<doc id="929984" wikidata="Q6490529" url="?curid=929984" title="Larry Householder">
<text>Larry Lee Householder (born June 6, 1959) is an American former politician and convicted felon, who was convicted in the largest bribery corruption scandal in Ohio&#x27;s history. Householder was the state representative for Ohio&#x27;s 72nd district and was a two-time Speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives. He is a member of the Republican Party. Householder represented the same district from 1997 to 2004, including as speaker from 2001 to 2004. In 2016, he was elected to the Statehouse again, and on January 7, 2019, he was re-elected to serve as speaker. His district included Coshocton and Perry counties, as well as about half of Licking County.

On July 21, 2020, the FBI arrested Householder on federal RICO charges. The charges allege that his return to politics in 2016 was part of a criminal conspiracy. The Ohio House of Representatives unanimously removed Householder as speaker on July 30. In November 2020, Householder won reelection to his seat in the Ohio House of Representatives but he was expelled from the House on June 16, 2021. Householder was convicted of racketeering after a jury trial and received the maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison on June 29, 2023, for his role in the Ohio nuclear bribery scandal. As a convicted felon, Ohio law prohibits Householder from holding public office in the state. He is currently imprisoned at Federal Correctional Institution, Elkton in Elkton, Ohio.

==Early life and education==
Born in Zanesville, Ohio, Householder was raised in Junction City, Ohio where he worked on his family&#x27;s farm. He then attended Ohio University, earning a degree in political science. He is married with six children.

== Career ==
Householder ran an insurance agency and served as Perry County commissioner before seeking higher office.

=== Ohio House of Representatives ===

==== 1997–2004 ====
In 1996, he ran for Ohio&#x27;s 78th House district, challenging incumbent Democrat Mary Abel of Athens. Householder defeated Abel with 55.03% of the vote. He was reelected three times.

In 1998, Householder was elected to serve as assistant majority whip. In 2001, he was elected to serve as Speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives, the highest post in the House. He served two terms as speaker, during which he led major legislative reforms, including introducing concealed carry, passing tort reform, and defunding Planned Parenthood—making Ohio the first state to do so.

In 2004, Householder and several top advisers were investigated for alleged money laundering and irregular campaign practices. The government closed the case without filing charges. He was term-limited in 2004. Householder was later elected the Perry County Auditor.

====2017–2021====
When incumbent state Representative Bill Hayes ran for Licking County prosecutor in 2016, Householder ran for his old seat, renamed District 72 after redistricting. Householder defeated Cliff N. Biggers in the Republican primary with almost 64% of the vote. He won the general election against Democrat John Carlisle with 72% of the vote. A former Speaker, Householder became a freshman legislator along with former President of the Ohio Senate Keith Faber. On January 7, 2019, a bipartisan majority of legislators elected him to serve again as speaker of the Ohio House.

====Library programming controversy====

In May 2019, Householder criticized the Ohio Library Council and the Newark Library in Licking County for providing an event for teens in the LGBTQ community at the taxpayers&#x27; expense. In response, the Newark Ohio Pride Coalition issued a formal statement noting that their organization paid for the event with a non-governmental grant. Later that evening, the Newark Library canceled the event. The Newark Ohio Pride Coalition found a new location for it.

After his arrest for racketeering in 2020, the event organizers publicly asked Householder to reflect upon his own advice about being a good steward of public money.

== Arrest ==

On July 21, 2020, the FBI arrested Householder and four others in connection with a $60 million bribery case involving the financial rescue of First Energy&#x27;s two nuclear plants in Ohio, Davis–Besse and Perry. U.S. Attorney David M. DeVillers called it &quot;likely the largest bribery scheme ever perpetrated against the state of Ohio&quot;. During a July 21 press briefing, DeVillers said that money from First Energy was filtered through a fake nonprofit organization to pay for bribes and evade campaign finance laws.

Following DeVillers&#x27;s press conference, Republican Governor Mike DeWine asked Householder to resign. Later that day, Householder released a statement to the press saying he would not resign.

On July 30, 2020, the Ohio House of Representatives voted unanimously to remove Householder as Ohio House Speaker.

On June 16, 2021, the House voted to expel Householder by a bipartisan vote of 75–21.

On March 9, 2023, Householder was convicted of racketeering in relation to the First Energy scheme.

On June 29, 2023, Householder was sentenced to a maximum of 20 years for his crimes. Following sentencing, Householder was remanded into custody to begin serving his sentence in federal prison. Under federal law, he must serve at least 85% of his sentence after which time he may be eligible for early release in June 2040. As of August 28, 2023, Householder was transferred to federal prison in Oklahoma.

On May 31, 2024, Householder pleaded not guilty to 10 felony charges brought by the state of Ohio.

== Personal life ==
Larry Householder is married to Taundra Householder. They have five sons. They also had a daughter, who died in 1992.

<text>Dawn is a Pakistani English-language newspaper that was launched in British India by Muhammad Ali Jinnah in 1941. It is the largest English newspaper in Pakistan, and is widely considered the country&#x27;s newspaper of record. &quot;Dawn&quot; is the flagship publication of the Dawn Media Group, which also owns local radio station &quot;CityFM89&quot; as well as the marketing and media magazine &quot;Aurora&quot;.

Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Pakistan&#x27;s founding father, launched the newspaper in Delhi on 26 October 1941, with the goal of establishing it as a mouthpiece for the All-India Muslim League. The first issue was printed at Latifi Press on 12 October 1942. Based in Karachi, it also maintains offices in Lahore, Peshawar, Quetta and the capital city of Islamabad, in addition to having correspondents abroad. , it has a weekday circulation of over 109,000. The newspaper&#x27;s current chief editor is Zaffar Abbas.

==History==

&quot;Dawn&quot; began as a weekly publication, based in New Delhi. Under the instruction of Jinnah, it became the official organ of the All India Muslim League in Delhi, and the sole voice of the Muslims League in the English language, reflecting and espousing the cause of Pakistan&#x27;s creation. Jinnah summed up the paper&#x27;s purpose in these words:
&quot;The &quot;Dawn&quot; will mirror faithfully the views of Hindustan&#x27;s Muslims and the All Hindustan Muslim League in all its activities: economic, educational and social and more particularly political, throughout the country fearlessly and independently and while its policy will be, no doubt, mainly to advocate and champion the cause of the Muslims and the policy and programme of the All Hindustan Muslim League, it will not neglect the cause and welfare of the peoples of this sub-continent generally&quot;.

&quot;Dawn&quot; became a daily newspaper in October 1944 under the leadership of its editor, Pothan Joseph, who later resigned in 1944 to take up the position of the government&#x27;s principal information officer in part because of differences with Jinnah over the Pakistan Movement. He was succeeded by Altaf Husain who galvanized the Muslims of India for independence by his editorials, which earned him the ire of the Congress Party and of Lord Mountbatten, the last Viceroy and Governor-General of the British Raj both of whom wanted a united India.

In 1947, due to the Partition of India, senior &quot;Dawn&quot; staff led by Altaf Husain moved to Karachi, which led to that city becoming the head office of the newspaper.

In 1950, for a brief period, the owners discontinued &quot;Dawn&quot; over ownership issues and restarted it as &quot;Herald&quot;.

==Features==

&quot;Dawn&quot; regularly carries syndicated articles from western newspapers such as &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

On Sundays, the weekend advertiser carries three sections namely &quot;Ad Buzz&quot;, &quot;Career&quot;, and &quot;Real Estate&quot;.

==Publication of the US diplomatic cables==
On 19 May 2011, Dawn Media Group signed a memorandum of understanding with Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, for the exclusive first use in Pakistan of all the secret US diplomatic cables related to political and other developments in the country.

An announcement printed in the newspaper and posted on the website read:

== Resignation of Pervaiz Rashid ==
In 2016, a story, &quot;Act against militants or face international isolation, civilians tell military&quot; by Cyril Almeida, assistant editor and columnist for &quot;Dawn&quot;, triggered the resignation of Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid, after a preliminary investigation established a &quot;lapse&quot; on his part vis-à-vis the publication of the &quot;planted&quot; story.

==Editorial stance==
&quot;Dawn&quot;&#x27;s editorial stance has varied over time, influenced by its editors and the prevailing political context. Altaf Husain, the second editor of &quot;Dawn&quot;, was known for his confrontational editorials that often challenged governmental policies, maintaining the newspaper&#x27;s editorial independence despite financial pressures from advertising boycotts. He staunchly supported the Pakistan Muslim League and was critical of governments not aligned with it. Husain&#x27;s foreign policy views favored a military alliance with the United States, shifting only when geopolitical circumstances led him to support ties with China, regardless of its communist regime.

After Husain&#x27;s tenure, the newspaper experienced a rapid succession of editors, each introducing their own unique editorial policies. Jamil Ansari, for example, closely aligned with the Ayub Khan administration, exercising caution in editorial decisions to avoid offending the government. In contrast, Yusuf Haroon&#x27;s brief editorship was marked by a conservative approach to content and layout, aiming to preserve the newspaper&#x27;s independence from state influence. Altaf Gauhar, successor of Yusuf Haroon, notably transitioned from being an architect of restrictive press laws to advocating for free speech, critiquing government policies through his editorials. His successor, Mazhar Ali Khan, brought a progressive stance to the newspaper, focusing on professional journalism and reasoned critique of government policies.

Ahmad Ali Khan, the longest serving editor of &quot;Dawn&quot;, stabilized the newspaper&#x27;s editorial direction, blending a progressive outlook with cautious navigation of the restrictive political environment under Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. Despite the constraints, the newspaper managed to subtly critique the regime&#x27;s policies, especially those that contradicted the principles of democracy and civil liberties.

The period following Khan&#x27;s tenure saw editors such as Saleem Asmi, Tahir Mirza, and Abbas Nasir each contributing to &quot;Dawn&quot;&#x27;s development in their own unique ways. Asmi expanded the newspaper&#x27;s coverage to include the arts and launched new editions. Nasir adapted the newspaper to the digital age, enhancing its online presence and emphasizing the need for investigative journalism and a diverse range of op-ed contributors.

<text>The barber surgeon of Avebury is a skeleton discovered in 1938 at Avebury henge monument in Wiltshire, England.

The body was found underneath a buried megalith by archaeologist Alexander Keiller in 1938. It was dated by coins to the early 14th century, and identified as a barber surgeon by a pair of scissors and a medical-looking probe. The stone was re-erected by Keiller. Keiller assigned the stone as Stone 38, with Isobel Smith renumbering as Stone 9. Many stones of the Avebury stone circle had been buried, presumably as a result of attempts to de-paganise the site or to clear land for agriculture.
The story of the barber surgeon is one that most visitors to the prehistoric Avebury stone circle will have heard. The traditional interpretation goes as follows; a pious traveller was assisting the folk of Avebury village in burying the pagan standing stones during the fourteenth century. As he was digging out the underside of a stone it fell over, crushing him and entombing him beneath it. Keiller lifted the stone (which was 3 metres tall and weighed 13 tons) to reinstate it in 1938 and found the man&#x27;s remains underneath. Items found with the body including three silver coins dated to around 1320–25, as well as a pair of iron scissors and an iron probe led to him being identified as an itinerant mediaeval barber surgeon.

Keiller sent the remains to the curator of the museum at the Royal College of Surgeons, who he felt would appreciate the find. It was thought to have been destroyed during bombing in the Second World War but was rediscovered in a store at the Natural History Museum by Mike Pitts, the former curator of the Alexander Keiller Museum, Avebury, and re-examined in 1998. A large healed cut wound was noticed on the skull but no evidence of traumatic death was identified and it was suggested that the man had been buried beneath a stone rather than crushed by it.

<text>The Bushveldt Carbineers (BVC) were a short-lived, irregular mounted infantry regiment, raised in South Africa during the Second Boer War.

The 320-strong regiment was formed in February 1901 and commanded by an Australian, Colonel R. W. Lenehan. It was based at Pietersburg, 260 kilometres north-east of Pretoria, and saw action in the Spelonken region of northern Transvaal, during 1901–1902.

About two-fifths of the regiment&#x27;s members had previously belonged to units recruited in Australia. The BVC also included about 40 Boers, who had been recruited at internment camps; among the members of the BVC, these Boers were known as &quot;joiners&quot;.

The unit was later renamed as the Pietersburg Light Horse on 1 December 1902

==Breaker Morant==

The 1980 film Breaker Morant portrays the unit in which Australian Lieutenants Harry &quot;Breaker&quot; Morant and Peter Handcock were serving when they were court martialed. They were executed on 27 February 1902 by a firing squad of Cameron Highlanders, having been convicted by the British army of murdering a civilian and Boer prisoners of war. Morant claimed that the BVC had been ordered not to take prisoners. Lieutenant George Witton, who had been sentenced to death by the same court-martial but whose sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment, was released following a public outcry; he had served 32 months.

<text>The early timeline of [[Nazism]] begins with its origins and continues until Hitler&#x27;s rise to power.

== 19th century influences ==
*1841: German economist Friedrich List publishes &quot;National System of Political Economy&quot;, espousing settlement farming and agricultural expansion eastwards along with economic industrialization manipulated by the state, and the establishment of a German-dominated European economic sphere as part of the solution to Germany&#x27;s economic woes (predecessor ideas to Nazi imperialism). 
*1856: French aristocrat and author Arthur de Gobineau publishes his &quot;An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races&quot; in which he divides the human species into three races, black, white, and yellow; arguing therein that racial distinctions form a clear and natural genetic barrier of sorts. Gobineau wrote that racial mixing would lead to chaos. While not an anti-Semite, his work is often characterized as philosemitic (since he wrote positively about the Jews), but it is still considered an early manifestation of scientific racism. Historian Joachim C. Fest, in his biography of Hitler, claims that Arthur de Gobineau&#x27;s negative views on race mixing influenced Hitler and thereby, the ideology of Nazism. 
*1870s: German chancellor Otto von Bismarck promotes campaigns against Catholics (&quot;Kulturkampf&quot;) and, later, against the Social Democratic Party, in an attempt to unify Germans in common opposition to a minority. Later referred to as &quot;negative integration,&quot; historians cite it as setting a tone of exclusion in early Germany, which had a lasting influence on later German nationalism. 
*1882: The Linz Program, one of the most notable expressions of early German nationalism in Austria, is published. The program advocates a break with the Habsburg monarchy, the full Germanization of Austria and its annexation to Germany as a single nation. Ironically, several of its authors were Jews. 
*1888: German jurist and international law reformer, Franz von Liszt argues that criminal characteristics are innate as opposed to being determined by a person&#x27;s social environment and coins the term, &quot;Criminal Biology&quot;, a theory that would later influence Nazi anthropologists and racial hygiene proponents in their justification for sterilization and euthanasia.

<text>An interest rate future is a futures contract (a financial derivative) with an interest-bearing instrument as the underlying asset. It is a particular type of interest rate derivative. Examples include Treasury-bill futures, Treasury-bond futures and Eurodollar futures.

, the global market for exchange-traded interest rate futures was notionally valued by the Bank for International Settlements at $34,771 billion.

==Uses==
Interest rate futures are used to hedge against the risk that interest rates will move in an adverse direction, causing a cost to the company.

For example, borrowers face the risk of interest rates rising. Futures use the inverse relationship between interest rates and bond prices to hedge against the risk of rising interest rates. A borrower will enter to sell a future today. Then if interest rates rise in the future, the value of the future will fall (as it is linked to the underlying asset, bond prices), and hence a profit can be made when closing out of the future (i.e. buying the future).

Treasury futures are contracts sold on the Globex market for March, June, September and December contracts. As pressure to raise interest rates rises, futures contracts will reflect that speculation as a decline in price. Price and yield will always be in an inversely correlated relationship.

Interest rate futures are not directly correlated with the market interest rates. When one enters into an interest rate futures contract (like a bond future), the trader has ability to eventually take delivery of the underlying asset. In the case of notes and bonds this means the trader could potentially take delivery of a bunch of bonds if the contract is not cash settled. The bonds which the seller can deliver vary depending on the futures contract. The seller can choose to deliver a variety of bonds to the buyer that fit the definitions laid out in the contract. The futures contract price takes this into account, therefore prices have less to do with current market interest rates, and more to do with what existing bonds in the market are cheapest to deliver to the buyer.

==Short-term interest rate futures==

A short-term interest rate (STIR) future is a futures contract that derives its value from the interest rate at maturation. Common short-term interest rate futures are Eurodollar, Euribor, Euroyen, Short Sterling and Euroswiss, which are calculated on LIBOR at settlement, with the exception of Euribor which is based on Euribor and Euroyen which is based on TIBOR. This value is calculated as 100 minus the interest rate. Contracts vary, but are often defined upon an interest rate index such as 3-month sterling or US dollar LIBOR. 

They are traded across a wide range of currencies, including the G12 country currencies and many others.

Some representative contracts are:

&quot;United States&quot;

* 90-day Eurodollar (CME) - This will be terminated in June 2023 and converted to the Three-Month SOFR futures.
* SOFR 1-month and 3-month futures (CME)
* Federal funds 30-day (CBOT)

&quot;Europe&quot;

* 3-month Euribor (Euronext.liffe)
* 90-day Sterling LIBOR (Euronext.liffe)
* Euro Sfr (Euronext.liffe)

&quot;Asia&quot;

* 3-month Euroyen (TIF) - This will be terminated in 2024, and 3-month TONA futures will start in 2023.
* 90-day Bank Bill (SFE)
* 3-month BIBOR futures (BB3) (TFEX)

where

* CME is the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
* CBOT is the Chicago Board of Trade
* TIF is the Tokyo International Financial Futures Exchange
* SFE is the Sydney Futures Exchange
* TFEX is the Thailand Futures Exchange

As an example, consider the definition of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Eurodollar interest rate future, the most widely and deeply traded financial futures contract.

* They are listed on a 10-year cycle. Other markets only extend about 2–4 years.
* Last Trading Day is the second London business day preceding the third Wednesday of the contract month.
* Delivery Day is cash settlement on the third Wednesday.
* The minimum fluctuation (Commodity tick size) is half a basis point or 0.005%.
* Payment is the difference between the price paid for the contract (in ticks) multiplied by the &quot;tick value&quot; of the contract which is $12.50 per tick.
* Before the Last Trading Day the contract trades at market prices. The Final Settlement Price is the British Bankers Association (BBA) percentage rate for Three–Month Eurodollar Interbank Time Deposits, rounded to the nearest 1/10000th of a percentage point at 11:00 London time on that day, subtracted from 100. (Expressing financial futures prices as 100 minus the implied interest rate was originally intended to make the contract price behave similarly to a Bond price in that an increase in price corresponds to a decrease in yield).

Short-term interest rate futures are extensively used in the hedging of interest rate swaps.

===Exchange-traded Strategies===
A great deal of the trading on these contracts is exchange traded multi-leg strategies, essentially bets upon the future shape of the yield curve and/or basis. Both Liffe and CME allow direct exchange trading in calendar spreads (the order book for spreads is separate from that of the underlying futures), which are quoted in terms of implied prices (price differences between futures of different expiries). Exchange-traded futures spreads greatly reduce execution risk and slippage, allowing traders to place guaranteed limit orders for entire spreads, otherwise impossible when entering into spreads via two separate futures orders.

<text>Ours-Pierre-Armand Petit-Dufrénoy (5 September 1792 – 20 March 1857) was a French geologist and mineralogist.

==Education and career==
He was born at Sevran, in the &quot;département&quot; of Seine-et-Oise. After leaving the Imperial Lyceum in 1811, he studied until 1813 at the École Polytechnique, and then entered the Corps des mines. He subsequently assisted in the management of the École des Mines, of which he was professor of mineralogy and afterwards director. He was also professor of geology at the École des Ponts et Chaussées.

In conjunction with Élie de Beaumont in 1841 he published a great geological map of France, the result of investigations carried on during thirteen years (1823–1836). Five years (1836–1841) were spent in writing the text to accompany the map, the publication of the work with two quarto volumes of text extending from 1841 to 1848; a third volume was issued in 1873. The two authors had already together published &quot;Voyage Métallurgique en Angleterre&quot; (1827, 2nd ed. 1837–1839), &quot;Mémoires pour servir a une description géologique de la France&quot;, in four vols. (1830–1838), and a &quot;Mémoire&quot; on Cantal and Mont-Dore (1833).

Other literary productions of Dufrénoy are an account of the iron mines of the eastern Pyrenees (1834), and a treatise on mineralogy (3 vols. and atlas, 1844–1845; 2nd ed., 4 vols. and atlas, 1856–1859), in which the geological relations as well as the physical and chemical properties of minerals were dealt with; he likewise contributed numerous papers to the &quot;Annales des mines&quot; and other scientific publications, one of the most interesting of which is entitled &quot;Des terrains volcaniques des environs de Naples&quot;. He occupied the chair of mineralogy of the Muséum national d&#x27;histoire naturelle from 1847 to 1857.

With André Brochant de Villiers and Elie de Beaumont, he visited England to study processes for mining and metallurgical production. Their observations were published in &quot;Les Annales des Mines&quot;. As an eminent professor of mineralogy, Dufrénoy returned to London to acquire the mineral collection created by Abbé Haüy, one of the founders of crystallography, and this acquisition lead to the mineralogical collection of the Muséum national d&#x27;histoire naturelle becoming one of the world&#x27;s best.

== Honors and awards ==
Dufrénoy was a member of the Academy of Sciences, a commander of the Légion d&#x27;honneur, and an inspector-general of mines. In 1843 he received, along with Élie de Beaumont, the Wollaston medal from the Geological Society of London. In 1845 the newly discovered mineral dufrenoysite was named after him. There is a street in Paris named in his honor.

==Minerals described by Dufrénoy==
* &quot;confolensite&quot; — synonym for halloysite
* &quot;manganèse silicaté rose&quot; — synonym for rhodonite
* &quot;fer carbonaté&quot;, 1827 — (synonym for ), mixture of siderite and carbonaceous clays
* &quot;huréaulite&quot;, 1829
* &quot;nussièrite&quot;, 1835 — synonym for phosphohedyphane

<text>In mathematical logic, structural proof theory is the subdiscipline of proof theory that studies proof calculi that support a notion of analytic proof, a kind of proof whose semantic properties are exposed. When all the theorems of a logic formalised in a structural proof theory have analytic proofs, then the proof theory can be used to demonstrate such things as consistency, provide decision procedures, and allow mathematical or computational witnesses to be extracted as counterparts to theorems, the kind of task that is more often given to model theory.

==Analytic proof==
The notion of analytic proof was introduced into proof theory by Gerhard Gentzen for the sequent calculus; the analytic proofs are those that are cut-free. His natural deduction calculus also supports a notion of analytic proof, as was shown by Dag Prawitz; the definition is slightly more complex—the analytic proofs are the normal forms, which are related to the notion of normal form in term rewriting.

==Structures and connectives==
The term &quot;structure&quot; in structural proof theory comes from a technical notion introduced in the sequent calculus: the sequent calculus represents the judgement made at any stage of an inference using special, extra-logical operators called structural operators: in formula_1, the commas to the left of the turnstile are operators normally interpreted as conjunctions, those to the right as disjunctions, whilst the turnstile symbol itself is interpreted as an implication. However, it is important to note that there is a fundamental difference in behaviour between these operators and the logical connectives they are interpreted by in the sequent calculus: the structural operators are used in every rule of the calculus, and are not considered when asking whether the subformula property applies. Furthermore, the logical rules go one way only: logical structure is introduced by logical rules, and cannot be eliminated once created, while structural operators can be introduced and eliminated in the course of a derivation.

The idea of looking at the syntactic features of sequents as special, non-logical operators is not old, and was forced by innovations in proof theory: when the structural operators are as simple as in Getzen&#x27;s original sequent calculus there is little need to analyse them, but proof calculi of deep inference such as display logic (introduced by Nuel Belnap in 1982) support structural operators as complex as the logical connectives, and demand sophisticated treatment.

==Cut-elimination in the sequent calculus==

==Natural deduction and the formulae-as-types correspondence==

==Logical duality and harmony==

== Hypersequents ==
The hypersequent framework extends the ordinary sequent structure to a multiset of sequents, using an additional structural connective | (called the hypersequent bar) to separate different sequents. It has been used to provide analytic calculi for, e.g., modal, intermediate and substructural logics A hypersequent is a structure

formula_2

where each formula_3 is an ordinary sequent, called a component of the hypersequent. As for sequents, hypersequents can be based on sets, multisets, or sequences, and the components can be single-conclusion or multi-conclusion sequents. The formula interpretation of the hypersequents depends on the logic under consideration, but is nearly always some form of disjunction. The most common interpretations are as a simple disjunction

formula_4

for intermediate logics, or as a disjunction of boxes

formula_5

for modal logics.

In line with the disjunctive interpretation of the hypersequent bar, essentially all hypersequent calculi include the external structural rules, in particular the external weakening rule

formula_6

and the external contraction rule

formula_7

The additional expressivity of the hypersequent framework is provided by rules manipulating the hypersequent structure. An important example is provided by the modalised splitting rule

formula_8

for modal logic S5, where formula_9 means that every formula in formula_10 is of the form formula_11.

Another example is given by the communication rule for the intermediate logic LC

formula_12

Note that in the communication rule the components are single-conclusion sequents.

==Calculus of structures==

==Nested sequent calculus==

The nested sequent calculus is a formalisation that resembles a 2-sided calculus of structures.

<doc id="930002" wikidata="Q3282144" url="?curid=930002" title="Septerra Core">
<text>Septerra Core: Legacy of the Creator is a role-playing video game developed by Valkyrie Studios and published by Monolith Productions. It was originally released in 1999 for Windows; since then, it has been re-released via GOG.com for Windows in 2009, for OS X in 2013, and for Linux in 2017.

== Gameplay ==

The gameplay area has two different depths: the world map and the location maps, both using pre-rendered backdrops. The player is given the opportunity of interacting with other characters, visiting stores, fighting battles, and so forth, while the world map serves the purpose of transporting the player from one location map to the other. At some points in the story, such as the beginning, the game is linear on the world map; at other times the player can move to battlefields to gain more experience for the characters. Within dungeons there is a choice of movement to pick up the required magic items in any order, but one cannot rest to full health within. Each combat sequence is accompanied by a random battle-music track, during which the player characters and their opponents leap to their stations on an isometric grid. The player cannot alter their location during the game, not even if the villain directly in front of one is defeated. There is a &quot;dial&quot; for each of the three player characters, which moves past two break points, and ultimately to a maximum power level, as time goes along. After the first break point, the player may choose to have that player attack at a low level, or join with another character for a combined attack. Spells, either for a given character or combo, may be set up and cast at low, medium, or maximum power level as well. While the player chooses to wait until the characters are powered-up, the enemy attacks.

== Characters ==
=== Playable Characters ===
In total there are 9 playable characters to be unlocked. The player gets the choice to customize their roster of 3 characters at once. Certain characters have different interactions with different people, objects or scenery.

*Maya: The main protagonist of the game. She is a young woman from Shell 2, who scavenges useful items from the junk piles. As a girl, her village was destroyed and her parents killed when the Chosen, the inhabitants of the topmost Shell, decided to bring their airborne conflicts to her peaceful home town. You will start your adventure with Maya. She is the main character of the Septerra Core story; however, during the course of the game you will encounter a variety of characters who will join you in your quest to save Septerra from destruction.
*Grubb: He is Maya&#x27;s friend. A reclusive mechanical wizard who can turn the bounty of junk on Shell 2 into just about any machine he can think of. Grubb has the ability to repair things, which can be used in combat to heal mechanical/cyborg allies.
*Runner: Grubb&#x27;s oddest and best creations, an enormous and affable junk-bot that can walk on two legs or run on four. Runner seems like a massively overgrown puppy-dog at times, but he is a ferocious ally in combat. Runner has the ability to steal when browsing a shop.
*Corgan: A member of the courageous and dedicated Holy Guard, the protectors of Shell 3 and of the legacy of Marduk, Corgan is a skilled defensive sword fighter with a knack for diplomacy. Until a certain side mission is completed, Corgan does not completely trust Selina and there is a random of chance that Corgan will automatically use his turn during combat to attack Selina or vice versa, if they are paired on the same team.
*Led: The young daughter of a great military leader, General Campbell, Led is a skilled mechanic whose preferred Weapon is a giant wrench. She has two artificial legs which are the result of an accident during military training. Ever since then, her father has forbidden her to fight for her country. The only character other than Grubb who has the repair ability.
*Araym: A thief and bounty hunter, he can use his detachable, spider-like mechanical limbs for a variety of attacks. The only character other than Runner who has the steal ability when browsing a shop.
*Selina: One of Doskias’ generals and his lover, Selina is a dark, mysterious and powerful warrior with a knack for mystical Core Spells. Though in the start of the game Selina is an antagonist, as the game progresses, she has a change of heart and is unlocked as a playable character.
*Badu: A member of the inhuman race of the Underlost, the enormous Badu is a powerful warrior but a bad communicator — he only speaks his native tongue. This character has very few interactions with people outside of his homeland, but very useful when the player needs to communicate with other Underlost people who can only speak in their native tongue.
*Lobo: he was once a mindless cyborg created to defend his country from marauding pirates, but after crash landing during battle he was found and rebuilt by a renegade mechanic. After acquiring free thought, he became a pirate, to fight against the very country that made him. This characters attacks in combat are very similar to Maya, and they can share a lot of weapon accessories.

=== Non Playable Characters ===
There are a ton of non playable characters, or NPCs, that the player can interact with which have countless reactions to various playable characters which makes talking to the same NPC when playable characters are swapped always worth a try. Below some of the NPCs who are integral to the story are mentioned.
*Uncle: He is known simply as uncle because Maya, and many of the orphans in her hometown Oasis, were raised by this kindly man.
*Azziz: The orphans of Oasis are taught by Azziz, the wise master of the temple that celebrates the great Marduk. Azziz is a good source of information about the world of Septerra.
*Bowman: The leader of the Holy Guard. He has trained Corgan and other Holy Guard and is also the father of Layla.
*Layla: She is Corgan&#x27;s one true love, and also another member of the Holy Guard. She is the daughter of Bowman who worries about her when going into battle.

== Development ==
&quot;Septerra Core&quot; was originally being developed by Rabid Entertainment. After Rabid Entertainment closed its doors, Valkyrie Studios took over and finished development. The game was released by Monolith Productions in November 1999 for the PC. The game was scored by Martin O&#x27;Donnell and Michael Salvatori, and featured minor voice work from Steve Downes.

According to &quot;IGN&quot;, &quot;Many of the Valkyrie Studios team had previously worked on the Beavis &amp; Butthead game for Viacom, a highly acclaimed graphic adventure.&quot;

== Release ==
In 2006, version 1.04 was released, addressing compatibility issues with the game and newer versions of Windows operating systems.

In 2009, the digital distributor GOG.com released a version of the game pre-patched to v1.04.

In 2013, the game was also released on Steam.

== Reception ==
The game received &quot;average&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. John Lee of &quot;NextGen&quot; said, &quot;You don&#x27;t see many console-style RPGs on PC, but &quot;Septerra Core&quot; should make you look.&quot;

Jason Lambert of &quot;GameZone&quot; gave it 8.1 out of 10, saying, &quot;If you are wanting an exciting RPG while waiting on the other greats to hit the shelves, then you would want to pick &quot;Septerra Core&quot;.&quot;

<text>Alocasia is a genus of rhizomatous or tuberous, broad-leaved, perennial, flowering plants from the family Araceae. There are about 90 accepted species native to tropical and subtropical Asia and eastern Australia. Around the world, many growers widely cultivate a range of hybrids and cultivars as ornamentals.

== Description ==
The large, cordate or sagittate leaves grow to a length of on long petioles. Their araceous flowers grow at the end of a short stalk, but are not conspicuous; often hidden behind the leaf petioles.

The corms of some species can be processed to make them edible, however, the raw plants contain raphid or raphide crystals of calcium oxalate along with other irritants (possibly including proteases) that can numb and swell the tongue and pharynx. This can cause difficulty breathing and sharp pain in the throat. Lower parts of the plant contain the highest concentrations of the poison.

Prolonged boiling before serving or processing may reduce risk of adverse reactions. Additionally, acidic fruit such as tamarind may dissolve the raphides altogether. It&#x27;s important to note, however, that this genus varies in toxicity, and can still be dangerous to ingest, even after taking precautions.

==Species==
The following are the accepted species of &quot;Alocasia&quot; along with their common names (where available) and distribution ranges:


=== Nothospecies ===
: &quot;The following list is incomplete.&quot;
The following are hybrid species in the genus &quot;Alocasia&quot;:
* &quot;A.&quot; × &quot;mortfontanensis&quot; = &quot;A. longiloba&quot; × &quot;A. sanderiana&quot; (syn. &quot;A.&quot; × &quot;amazonica&quot;)

==Cultivation==

&quot;Alocasia&quot; are tropical plants that are increasingly becoming popular as houseplants. The hybrid &quot;A.&quot; × &quot;amazonica&quot; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. They are typically grown as pot plants, but a better way is to grow the plants permanently in the controlled conditions of a greenhouse. They can tolerate dim light and cannot withstand direct sunlight. They should be cared for as any other tropical plant with weekly cleaning of the leaves, frequent fertilization and medium to high humidity.

They rarely survive cold winters or the dryness of artificial heating, but an attempt to slowly acclimatize plants from the summer garden to the house can help. Once inside, the watering period must be reduced and the plants should be protected from spider mites or red spider attack.

<text>André-Jean-François-Marie Brochant de Villiers (6 August 177216 May 1840) was a French mineralogist and geologist.

==Life==

He was born at the Château de Villiers, near Mantes-la-Ville. After studying at the École Polytechnique, Paris, he was in 1794 the first pupil admitted to the École des Mines. In 1804, he was appointed professor of geology and mineralogy in the École des Mines, which had been temporarily transferred to Pezay in Savoy, and he returned with the school to Paris in 1815. Later on, he became inspector general of mines and a member of the Academy of Sciences.

He investigated the transition strata of the Tarantaise, wrote on the position of the granite rocks of Mont Blanc, and on the lead minerals of Derbyshire and Cumberland. He was charged with overseeing the construction of the geological map of France, undertaken by his pupils Dufrénoy and Elie de Beaumont.

Brochant de Villiers died in Paris on 16 May 1840.

<doc id="930011" wikidata="Q434516" url="?curid=930011" title="Oveta Culp Hobby">
<text>Oveta Culp Hobby (January 19, 1905 – August 16, 1995) was an American government official and businesswoman who served as the first United States Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare from 1953 to 1955. A member of the Republican Party, Hobby was the second woman ever to serve in a presidential cabinet. 

She also served as the first director of the Women&#x27;s Army Corps from 1942 to 1945, and was sequentially editor, publisher and chair of the board of the &quot;Houston Post&quot;. She entered public service when President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed her administrator of the Federal Security Agency, soon after reorganized as a federal executive department, known then as Department of Health, Education, and Welfare; and Hobby became its first head.

==Early life==
Culp was born on January 19, 1905, in Killeen, Texas, to Texas lawyer and legislator Isaac William Culp and Emma Elizabeth Hoover. She briefly attended Mary Hardin Baylor College for Women, and attended law classes at South Texas College of Law and Commerce, but did not graduate from either school. She went on to study law at the University of Texas Law School, but she did not formally enroll and therefore never received a degree. Starting at age 21, she served for several years as parliamentarian of the Texas House of Representatives and was an unsuccessful candidate for the legislature in 1930, before beginning a journalism career in 1931, at age 26.

== War service ==

During World War II, Hobby headed the Women&#x27;s Interest Section in the War Department&#x27;s Bureau of Public Relations for a short time and then became the director of the Women&#x27;s Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) (later the Women&#x27;s Army Corps [WAC]), which was created to fill gaps in the Army left by a shortage of men. She was commissioned a colonel in the U.S. Army on 5 July 1943. The members of the WAC were the first women other than nurses to wear U.S. Army uniforms and to receive military benefits through the GI Bill. Hobby devoted herself to integrating the WAC within the military, despite considering women&#x27;s military involvement a temporary necessity, and worked to protect and strengthen the WAC and its image. As director, she raised admission standards and created a Code of Conduct specific to the WAC to create a tightly regulated, high quality organization that portrayed women&#x27;s corps in a good light. These standards, along with actions to guard the morals and image of members, developed from Hobby&#x27;s prior experience with publicity and knowledge of the importance of media representation. Hobby achieved the rank of colonel and received the Distinguished Service Medal for efforts during the war. She was the first woman in the Army to receive this award. 

==Political career==
Hobby joined the Eisenhower administration in 1953 after appointed as head of the Federal Security Agency, a non-cabinet post, although she was invited to sit in on cabinet meetings. Soon, on April 11, 1953, she became the first secretary and first woman, of the new Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, which later became the Department of Health and Human Services. This was her second time organizing a new government agency. Among other decisions and actions at HEW, she made the decision to approve Jonas Salk&#x27;s polio vaccine.

Culp attempted to restructure Social Security payroll taxes (FICA and SECA), and was met with strong opposition. She resigned her post in 1955. At the time of her resignation she was embroiled in controversies related to the polio vaccine Cutter Incident. Back in Houston, Hobby resumed her position with the &quot;Houston Post&quot; as president and editor and cared for her ailing husband. She went on to serve on many boards and advisory positions with various civic and business institutions around the country. Seventeen colleges and universities, including Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania, awarded her honorary doctoral degrees. She was the first woman who was considered for a United States presidential candidacy by an incumbent United States President; Eisenhower encouraged her to run for president in 1960, but she did not run.

== Personal life and family ==
In 1931, she married William P. Hobby, an editor and future owner of the &quot;Houston Post&quot;, who served as the 27th governor of Texas from 1917 to 1921. They had two children together. She took a position on the editorial staff at the &quot;Post&quot;. In ensuing years she became the newspaper&#x27;s executive vice president, then its president, ultimately becoming its publisher and co-owner with her husband. In 1938, upon becoming vice president of the newspaper, she gave greater prominence to women&#x27;s news.

Hobby and her husband were both Southern Democrats, but soon became dissatisfied with the party throughout the 1930s. They believed Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s social programs overextended their original intent. After World War II, Hobby tried to sway Democratic voters to swing Republican for presidential nominees by establishing many statewide organizations.

She died of a stroke in 1995, in Houston, and was buried at Glenwood Cemetery.

Her son William P. Hobby, Jr., served as the 37th lieutenant governor of Texas from 1973 to 1991, the longest serving in that position. Her daughter Jessica was married to Henry E. Catto, Jr., the former United States Ambassador to Great Britain and was an activist for environmental causes and for the Democratic Party. Hobby&#x27;s grandson Paul Hobby narrowly lost the election for comptroller of Texas to Carole Strayhorn in the 1998 general election.

<doc id="930012" wikidata="Q5117344" url="?curid=930012" title="Church of St Walburge, Preston">
<text>St Walburge&#x27;s Church is a Roman Catholic church in Preston, Lancashire, England, northwest of the city centre on Weston Street. The church was built in the mid-19th century to a design by the Gothic Revival architect Joseph Hansom, the designer of the hansom cab, and is famous as having the tallest spire of any parish church in England. St Walburge&#x27;s is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a Grade I listed building.

In 2014 Michael Campbell, Roman Catholic Bishop of Lancaster, entrusted the church to the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest as a shrine for Eucharistic Devotion.

==Dedication==
St Walburge&#x27;s is dedicated to Saint Walpurga, an English saint, born 710 AD., daughter of St Richard, a West Saxon king. With her two brothers, St Willibald and St Winibald, she went to Germany as a missionary. She was renowned for her miraculous healing of illnesses.

==History==
St Walburge&#x27;s Church is situated in the Maudlands district of Preston, so called because of its association with St Mary Magdalene of which name the word &quot;Maudlands&quot; is a corruption. St Walburge&#x27;s is located near the site of a 12th-century leprosy hospital dedicated to St Mary Magdalene.

In 1847, at the time of the Roman Catholic revival in England, and with prosperity brought by the textile mills of Lancashire, the architect Joseph Hansom was commissioned to build a large church. Work began on the construction of the church in May 1850, and it was ready for its opening ceremony on 3 August 1854. The church was further extended in 1873 by the addition of a polygonal sanctuary with a central window high.

In 2007 St Walburge&#x27;s, along with several other churches in Preston, was threatened with closure by the Catholic Diocese of Lancaster. The quality of its architecture, its significance to the parish and its landmark status in Preston led to great interest in its fate, and the closure was given a stay of seven years from August 2008 while local fund-raising drives sought to supplement grants for the restoration of the building.
David Garrard, the Historic Churches Adviser of the Victorian Society said:

An outstanding building by an ingenious and imaginative architect, St Walburge’s is one of Preston’s greatest historic buildings. It was built to express the pride and confidence of the Roman Catholic community after legal restrictions on religious observance were lifted in the 19th century. To close it now would cost local people access to some of Lancashire’s richest heritage.

On 4 April 2014 Michael Campbell, Roman Catholic Bishop of Lancaster, announced in a pastoral letter that 
...Gilles Wach, General Prior of the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest, and I – together with Father Simon Hawksworth - have agreed, to establish a foundation of the Institute at the Church of St Walburge, Preston - hopefully in the autumn. 
The arrival and presence of the institute in the church and presbytery at St Walburge’s will enable the sustainability and care of this magnificent church so that it can be open each day as a shrine or centre for Eucharistic devotion and adoration. St Walburge’s will remain part of the Parish of St Walburge and the Sacred Heart but will specifically provide for the celebration of Holy Mass and the other Sacraments in the Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite. It is envisaged, however, that the current Ordinary Form Mass, will continue to be celebrated here on Sunday for as long as there is a pastoral need...

The Shrine Church was officially opened on 27 September 2014, with a High Mass celebrated by Gilles Wach, Prior General of the Institute of Christ the King, in the presence of Bishop Campbell. The Mass is celebrated daily at the Shrine and the Sacraments are offered in the Traditional Roman Rite according to the charter of the Institute of Christ the King.

==Architecture and features==

===Spire===

Externally, St Walburge&#x27;s spire, rising to is the dominant landmark in Preston and is one of the tallest structures of any sort in Lancashire. After Salisbury and Norwich Cathedrals, it is the third tallest spire in the United Kingdom, and is the tallest on a parish church. The steeple is constructed from limestone sleepers which originally carried the nearby Preston and Longridge Railway, giving the spire a red tint during sunset. In 2014 the church was featured in the BBC series &quot;Fred Dibnah&#x27;s Magnificent Monuments&quot; when the spire was the last to be worked upon by steeplejack and TV personality Fred Dibnah. Unable to complete the work due to television filming commitments, Dibnah&#x27;s ladders were left at the church and were eventually given to the workman who completed the job.

The tower contains a single bell of 31 cwt (1.5 tonnes) cast by Mears and Stainbank of Whitechapel which is the heaviest swinging bell in Lancashire. The use of the bell is restricted, due to protected birds nesting in the belfry, meaning it can only be rung in winter months.

The spire is occasionally open to the public at weekend evenings, via on-line booking. A small ticket charge is made in aid of church funds.

===Exterior===
St Walburge&#x27;s is renowned not just for its height but also for the inventive quality of its architecture, in which the architect has looked to Gothic models, employing the traditional features in a creative and harmonious way. The Open Churches Trust says of St Walburge&#x27;s that it &quot;undoubtedly an architectural gem of the North West of England.&quot;

The New Red Sandstone facade presents as an unaisled church with a very steep gable. A strongly horizontal arcade, divides the facade into two zones, balanced by strongly projecting buttresses and corner pinnacles typical of many English Gothic cathedrals. The arcade is countered by the verticality of strongly projecting buttresses and corner pinnacles typical of many English Gothic cathedrals. The upper zone is dominated by a rose window in diameter occupying almost the full width of the nave.

===Interior===
The interior, which seats about 1,000 people, is long and wide. The open wooden roof of is supported of fourteen hammerbeams, on the ends of which stand lifesized carved the figures of saints. The church contains an organ by William Hill of London, 1855. Other significant features include a wooden triptych and a crucifix with the shield of Preston and the motto &quot;Princeps Pacis&quot;. St. Ignatius of Loyola is also prominently represented to the right in the sanctuary, echoing the influence of the Jesuit priests still active in the city. The patron saints of Great Britain are also represented.

<doc id="930013" wikidata="Q171570" url="?curid=930013" title="Canadian Tire Motorsport Park">
<text>Canadian Tire Motorsport Park (formerly Mosport Park and Mosport International Raceway) is a multi-track motorsport venue located north of Bowmanville, Ontario, Canada, approximately 75 kilometers (47 miles) east of Toronto. The facility features a , 10-turn road course; a advance driver and race driver training facility with a skid pad (Driver Development Centre) and a kart track (Mosport Karting Centre Inc., previously &quot;Mosport Kartways&quot;). The name &quot;Mosport&quot;, a portmanteau of Motor Sport, came from the enterprise formed to build the track.

==History==

The circuit was the second purpose-built road race course in Canada after Westwood Motorsport Park in Coquitlam, British Columbia, succeeding Edenvale (Stayner, Ontario), Port Albert, Ontario&#x27;s Green Acres (ex-British Commonwealth Air Training Plan), and Nanticoke, Ontario&#x27;s Harewood Acres (ex-British Commonwealth Air Training Plan Number One Bombing and Gunnery School), all airport circuits, as Ontario racing venues.

The track was designed and built in the late 1950s. The first race to be held on the track was a local event organized by the Oakville Light Car Club in June 1961. Shortly thereafter, on June 25, the venue held its first major race, the Player&#x27;s 200, a sports car race bringing drivers from the world over to rural Ontario. Stirling Moss won the two-heat event in a Lotus 19. Second was Joakim Bonnier with Olivier Gendebien third. The proposed hairpin was expanded into two discrete corners, to be of greater challenge to the drivers and more interesting for the spectators, at his suggestion, and is named Moss Corner in his honour. This is a source of lingering confusion as many people call the track Mossport. Unlike many historic motorsport venues, Mosport&#x27;s track layout has remained mostly unchanged from its original form.

For 2001, the entire circuit was repaved to meet FIA specifications, and is now wide. Drivers were consulted to ensure the character of the &quot;old&quot; track was kept; almost all the &quot;racing lines&quot; have been maintained.

Mosport achieved acclaim through a series of international sports car races under the title &quot;Canadian Grand Prix&quot; normally reserved for Formula 1 races. Many events were wildly popular, breaking Canadian sports attendance records with each successive race. The success of these races led Mosport to be seen as a key component in the founding of the Can Am Series.

The Can-Am first visited the track in its inaugural season in 1966, and Mosport hosted at least one event in every year of the series&#x27; history, except 1968. In 1967, Canada&#x27;s centennial year, Mosport hosted Formula One, USAC, and a 500cc Motorcycle Grand Prix. F1&#x27;s Grand Prix of Canada remained at the track until 1977, until it was moved to Montreal. Mosport has hosted a wide variety of series throughout its history. The circuit has held Formula One, USAC, World Sportscar Championship, Can-Am, Formula 5000, and many other sports car, open-wheel, and motorcycle series.

Mosport has had several fatalities, both track crew, drivers, and riders, the most recognized being German Formula One driver Manfred Winkelhock who was killed in 1985 when his Porsche 962C crashed into a concrete wall. Another fatality at the track was in 2008 during the 29th annual Vintage Automobile Racing Association of Canada Racing Festival. Driver Dino Crescentini of Rochester Hills, MI – a ten-year veteran of vintage racing – lost control of his 1977 Wolf Dallara Can-Am car, which previously had been driven by Gilles Villeneuve. The most recent fatality was in 2018 when 61 year old former Pro Mazda driver Jeff Green speared off the racetrack at turn 8, and slammed into the barrier. He was attended to quickly but was unable to survive the crash.

Mosport has had a succession of owners since the original public company created to build the track. Two of those prior owners, Norm Namerow (who owned the track through his publishing company, CanTrack, until his death) and Harvey Hudes, have both been inducted into the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame for their contribution to the sport in Canada. In 1998, Panoz Motorsports purchased the facility, and in 1999, the newly formed American Le Mans Series visited Mosport for the first time.

Canadian Motorsports Ventures Ltd. (CMV) which includes Orlando Corp. Chairman Carlo Fidani and Canadian road racing driver Ron Fellows, purchased the facility in June 2011.

In February 2012, a partnership between Mosport and Canadian Tire was announced. The partnership includes a renaming of the track to Canadian Tire Motorsport Park.

==Driver Development Centre==

In the spring of 2000, Mosport opened the Driver Development Centre, a second , 12 turn training circuit designed for driver development. The new course was designed by the owners and instructors of the Bridgestone Racing Academy and was designed specifically with fewer guard rails, walls and minimum blind corners to meet the needs of their driver and mechanic training program.

Due to significant scheduling demands on the original Grand Prix circuit, the original academy course was reconstructed and lengthened to a full racing course in the fall of 2013. The new track features two configuration options; a intermediate course, a advanced course, as well as a skid pad, a pit lane, and a multi-storey event centre with classrooms and other facilities.

Prior to the Driver Development Centre, Mosport was home to the Bridgestone Racing Academy from 2000 to 2019, which conducted corporate programs, racing schools, and a Mechanics Training Program. The academy itself was originally established at Shannonville Motorsport Park, when owners Charlie and Brett Goodman acquired the cars and equipment of the former Spenard-David Racing School and teamed with then-Bridgestone/Firestone Canada Inc.

==Mosport Speedway==

Mosport Speedway was a oval speedway located on the northwest corner of Canadian Tire Motorsport Park. The track featured straightaways, 6-degree banked corners and two grandstands with seating for 8,500.

The oval was constructed in 1989 as a dirt track originally called Mosport&#x27;s Ascot North, named after the famous Ascot Park track in Gardena, California. The first event was scheduled in July 1989 and was to feature USAC Midgets and Sprint Cars and the World of Outlaws. The races were cancelled after the initial heat races caused deep ruts in the corners and dislodging stones hidden under the clay.

The track was paved that summer and renamed Mosport International Speedway. The track hosted a weekly Saturday night stock car racing program from May to September for 24 years. The stock car divisions included pure stock, sportsman and late models. The oval also featured regular touring series including the ACT Series, ISMA Supermodifieds, OSCAAR, Lucas Oil Sportsman Cup, CASCAR Super Series and the NASCAR Canadian Tire Series.

The park announced the closing of the oval in July 2013 to accommodate the expansion of the Driver Development Centre.

==Major series==
===IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship===
It was announced in September 2013 that Canadian Tire Motorsports Park was chosen to host an annual round of the IMSA SportsCar Championship beginning in 2014. The new series replaced the American Le Mans Series as the feature race during the tracks annual SportsCar Grand Prix, which is Canada&#x27;s largest annual sportscar race.

===NASCAR Pinty&#x27;s Series===
The NASCAR Pinty&#x27;s Series has visited the facility at least twice annually every year since its inaugural season in 2007. Currently the race is known as the Clarington 200 and takes place during the tracks Victoria Day SpeedFest Weekend and its Chevrolet Silverado 250 weekend.

<text>Ascidiacea, commonly known as the ascidians or sea squirts, is a paraphyletic class in the subphylum Tunicata of sac-like marine invertebrate filter feeders. Ascidians are characterized by a tough outer test or &quot;tunic&quot; made of the polysaccharide cellulose.

Ascidians are found all over the world, usually in shallow water with salinities over 2.5%. While members of the Thaliacea (salps, doliolids and pyrosomes) and Appendicularia (larvaceans) swim freely like plankton, sea squirts are sessile animals after their larval phase: they then remain firmly attached to their substratum, such as rocks and shells.

There are 2,300 species of ascidians and three main types: solitary ascidians, social ascidians that form clumped communities by attaching at their bases, and compound ascidians that consist of many small individuals (each individual is called a zooid) forming large colonies.

Sea squirts feed by taking in water through a tube, the oral siphon. The water enters the mouth and pharynx, flows through mucus-covered gill slits (also called pharyngeal stigmata) into a water chamber called the atrium, then exits through the atrial siphon.

Some authors now include the thaliaceans in Ascidiacea, making it monophyletic.

==Anatomy==
Sea squirts are rounded or cylindrical animals ranging from about in size. One end of the body is always firmly fixed to rock, coral, or some similar solid surface. The lower surface is pitted or ridged, and in some species has root-like extensions that help the animal grip the surface. The body wall is covered by a smooth thick tunic, which is often quite rigid. The tunic consists of cellulose, along with proteins and calcium salts. Unlike the shells of molluscs, the tunic is composed of living tissue and often has its own blood supply. In some colonial species, the tunics of adjacent individuals are fused into a single structure.

The upper surface of the animal, opposite to the part gripping the substratum, has two openings, or siphons. When removed from the water, the animal often violently expels water from these siphons, hence the common name of &quot;sea squirt&quot;. The body itself can be divided into up to three regions, although these are not clearly distinct in most species. The pharyngeal region contains the pharynx, while the abdomen contains most of the other bodily organs, and the postabdomen contains the heart and gonads. In many sea squirts, the postabdomen, or even the entire abdomen, are absent, with their respective organs being located more anteriorly.

As its name implies, the pharyngeal region is occupied mainly by the pharynx. The large buccal siphon opens into the pharynx, acting like a mouth. The pharynx itself is ciliated and contains numerous perforations, or stigmata, arranged in a grid-like pattern around its circumference. The beating of the cilia sucks water through the siphon, and then through the stigmata. A long ciliated groove, or endostyle, runs along one side of the pharynx, and a projecting ridge along the other. The endostyle may be homologous with the thyroid gland of vertebrates, despite its differing function.

The pharynx is surrounded by an atrium, through which water is expelled through a second, usually smaller, siphon. Cords of connective tissue cross the atrium to maintain the general shape of the body. The outer body wall consists of connective tissue, muscle fibres, and a simple epithelium directly underlying the tunic.

===Digestive system===
The pharynx forms the first part of the digestive system. The endostyle produces a supply of mucus which is then passed into the rest of the pharynx by the beating of flagella along its margins. The mucus then flows in a sheet across the surface of the pharynx, trapping planktonic food particles as they pass through the stigmata, and is collected in the ridge on the dorsal surface. The ridge bears a groove along one side, which passes the collected food downwards and into the oesophageal opening at the base of the pharynx.

The esophagus runs downwards to a stomach in the abdomen, which secretes enzymes that digest the food. An intestine runs upwards from the stomach parallel to the oesophagus and eventually opens, through a short rectum and anus, into a cloaca just below the atrial siphon. In some highly developed colonial species, clusters of individuals may share a single cloaca, with all the atrial siphons opening into it, although the buccal siphons all remain separate. A series of glands lie on the outer surface of the intestine, opening through collecting tubules into the stomach, although their precise function is unclear.

===Circulatory system===
The heart is a curved muscular tube lying in the postabdomen, or close to the stomach. Each end opens into a single vessel, one running to the endostyle, and the other to the dorsal surface of the pharynx. The vessels are connected by a series of sinuses, through which the blood flows. Additional sinuses run from that on the dorsal surface, supplying blood to the visceral organs, and smaller vessels commonly run from both sides into the tunic. Nitrogenous waste, in the form of ammonia, is excreted directly from the blood through the walls of the pharynx, and expelled through the atrial siphon.

Unusually, the heart of sea squirts alternates the direction in which it pumps blood every three to four minutes. There are two excitatory areas, one at each end of the heart, with first one being dominant, to push the blood through the ventral vessel, and then the other, pushing it dorsally.

There are four different types of blood cell: lymphocytes, phagocytic amoebocytes, &quot;nephrocytes&quot; and &quot;morula cells&quot;. The nephrocytes collect waste material such as uric acid and accumulate it in &quot;renal vesicles&quot; close to the digestive tract. The morula cells help to form the tunic, and can often be found within the tunic substance itself. In some species, the morula cells possess pigmented reducing agents containing iron (hemoglobin), giving the blood a red colour, or vanadium (hemovanadin) giving it a green colour. In that case the cells are also referred to as &quot;vanadocytes&quot;.

===Nervous system===
The ascidian central nervous system is formed from a plate that rolls up to form a neural tube. The number of cells within the central nervous system is very small. The neural tube is composed of the sensory vesicle, the neck, the visceral or tail ganglion, and the caudal nerve cord. The anteroposterior regionalization of the neural tube in ascidians is comparable to that in vertebrates.

Although there is no true brain, the largest ganglion is located in the connective tissue between the two siphons, and sends nerves throughout the body. Beneath this ganglion lies an exocrine gland that empties into the pharynx. The gland is formed from the nerve tube, and is therefore homologous to the spinal cord of vertebrates.

Sea squirts lack special sense organs, although the body wall incorporates numerous individual receptors for touch, chemoreception, and the detection of light.

==Life history==
Almost all ascidians are hermaphrodites and conspicuous mature ascidians are sessile. The gonads are located in the abdomen or postabdomen, and include one testis and one ovary, each of which opens via a duct into the cloaca. Broadly speaking, the ascidians can be divided into species which exist as independent animals (the solitary ascidians) and those which are interdependent (the colonial ascidians). Different species of ascidians can have markedly different reproductive strategies, with colonial forms having mixed modes of reproduction.

Solitary ascidians release many eggs from their atrial siphons; external fertilization in seawater takes place with the coincidental release of sperm from other individuals. A fertilized egg spends 12 hours to a few days developing into a free-swimming tadpole-like larva, which then takes no more than 36 hours to settle and metamorphose into a juvenile.

As a general rule, the larva possesses a long tail, containing muscles, a hollow dorsal nerve tube and a notochord, both features clearly indicative of the animal&#x27;s chordate affinities. One group though, the molgulid ascidians, have evolved tailless species on at least four separate occasions, and even direct development. A notochord is formed early in development and always consists of a row of exactly 40 cells. The nerve tube enlarges in the main body, and will eventually become the cerebral ganglion of the adult. The tunic develops early in embryonic life and extends to form a fin along the tail in the larva. The larva also has a statocyst and a pigmented cup above the mouth, which opens into a pharynx lined with small clefts opening into a surrounding atrium. The mouth and anus are originally at opposite ends of the animal, with the mouth only moving to its final (posterior) position during metamorphosis.

The larva selects and settles on appropriate surfaces using receptors sensitive to light, orientation to gravity, and tactile stimuli. When its anterior end touches a surface, (small, finger-like nervous projections) secrete an adhesive for attachment. Adhesive secretion prompts an irreversible metamorphosis: various organs (such as the larval tail and fins) are lost while others rearrange to their adult positions, the pharynx enlarges, and organs called ampullae grow from the body to permanently attach the animal to the substratum. The siphons of the juvenile ascidian become orientated to optimise current flow through the feeding apparatus. Sexual maturity can be reached in as little as a few weeks. Since the larva is more advanced than its adult, this type of metamorphosis is called &#x27;retrogressive metamorphosis&#x27;. This feature is a landmark for the &#x27;theory of retrogressive metamorphosis or ascidian larva theory&#x27;; the true chordates are hypothesized to have evolved from sexually mature larvae.

== Direct development in ascidians ==
Some ascidians, especially in Molgulidae family, have direct development in which the embryo develops directly into the juvenile without developing a tailed larva.

==Colonial species==
Colonial ascidians reproduce both asexually and sexually. Colonies can survive for decades. An ascidian colony consists of individual elements called &quot;zooids&quot;. Zooids within a colony are usually genetically identical and some have a shared circulation.

===Sexual reproduction===
Different colonial ascidian species produce sexually derived offspring by one of two dispersal strategies – colonial species are either broadcast spawners (long-range dispersal) or philopatric (very short-range dispersal). Broadcast spawners release sperm and ova into the water column and fertilization occurs near to the parent colonies. Some species are also viviparous. Resultant zygotes develop into microscopic larvae that may be carried great distances by oceanic currents. The larvae of sessile forms which survive eventually settle and complete maturation on the substratum- then they may bud asexually to form a colony of zooids.

The picture is more complicated for the philopatrically dispersed ascidians: sperm from a nearby colony (or from a zooid of the same colony) enter the atrial siphon and fertilization takes place &quot;within&quot; the atrium. Embryos are then brooded within the atrium where embryonic development takes place: this results in macroscopic tadpole-like larvae. When mature, these larvae exit the atrial siphon of the adult and then settle close to the parent colony (often within meters). The combined effect of short sperm range and philopatric larval dispersal results in local population structures of closely related individuals/inbred colonies. Generations of colonies which are restricted in dispersal are thought to accumulate adaptions to local conditions, thereby providing advantages over newcomers.

Trauma or predation often results in fragmentation of a colony into subcolonies. Subsequent zooid replication can lead to coalescence and circulatory fusion of the subcolonies. Closely related colonies which are proximate to each other may also fuse if they coalesce and if they are histocompatible. Ascidians were among the first animals to be able to immunologically distinguish self from non-self as a mechanism to prevent unrelated colonies from fusing to them and parasitizing them.

===Fertilization===
Sea squirt eggs are surrounded by a fibrous vitelline coat and a layer of follicle cells that produce sperm-attracting substances. In fertilization, the sperm passes through the follicle cells and binds to glycosides on the vitelline coat. The sperm&#x27;s mitochondria are left behind as the sperm enters and drives through the coat; this translocation of the mitochondria might provide the necessary force for penetration. The sperm swims through the perivitelline space, finally reaching the egg plasma membrane and entering the egg. This prompts rapid modification of the vitelline coat, through processes such as the egg&#x27;s release of glycosidase into the seawater, so no more sperm can bind and polyspermy is avoided. After fertilization, free calcium ions are released in the egg cytoplasm in waves, mostly from internal stores. The temporary large increase in calcium concentration prompts the physiological and structural changes of development.

The dramatic rearrangement of egg cytoplasm following fertilization, called ooplasmic segregation, determines the dorsoventral and anteroposterior axes of the embryo. There are at least three types of sea squirt egg cytoplasm: ectoplasm containing vesicles and fine particles, endoderm containing yolk platelets, and myoplasm containing pigment granules, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum. In the first phase of ooplasmic segregation, the myoplasmic actin-filament network contracts to rapidly move the peripheral cytoplasm (including the myoplasm) to the vegetal pole, which marks the dorsal side of the embryo. In the second phase, the myoplasm moves to the subequatorial zone and extends into a crescent, which marks the future posterior of the embryo. The ectoplasm with the zygote nucleus ends up at the animal hemisphere while the endoplasm ends up in the vegetal hemisphere.

===Promotion of out-crossing===
&quot;Ciona intestinalis&quot; is a hermaphrodite that releases sperm and eggs into the surrounding seawater almost simultaneously. It is self-sterile, and thus has been used for studies on the mechanism of self-incompatibility. Self/non-self-recognition molecules play a key role in the process of interaction between sperm and the vitelline coat of the egg. It appears that self/non-self recognition in ascidians such as &quot;C. intestinalis&quot; is mechanistically similar to self-incompatibility systems in flowering plants. Self-incompatibility promotes out-crossing, and thus provides the adaptive advantage at each generation of masking deleterious recessive mutations (i.e. genetic complementation).

&quot;Ciona savignyi&quot; is highly self-fertile. However, non-self sperm out-compete self-sperm in fertilization competition assays. Gamete recognition is not absolute allowing some self-fertilization. It was speculated that self-incompatibility evolved to avoid inbreeding depression, but that selfing ability was retained to allow reproduction at low population density.

&quot;Botryllus schlosseri&quot; is a colonial tunicate able to reproduce both sexually and asexually. &quot;B. schlosseri&quot; is a sequential (protogynous) hermaphrodite, and in a colony, eggs are ovulated about two days before the peak of sperm emission. Thus self-fertilization is avoided, and cross-fertilization is favored. Although avoided, self-fertilization is still possible in &quot;B. schlosseri&quot;. Self-fertilized eggs develop with a substantially higher frequency of anomalies during cleavage than cross-fertilized eggs (23% vs. 1.6%). Also, a significantly lower percentage of larvae derived from self-fertilized eggs metamorphose, and the growth of the colonies derived from their metamorphosis is significantly lower. These findings suggest that self-fertilization gives rise to inbreeding depression associated with developmental deficits that are likely caused by expression of deleterious recessive mutations.

===Asexual reproduction===
Many colonial sea squirts are also capable of asexual reproduction, although the means of doing so are highly variable between different families. In the simplest forms, the members of the colony are linked only by rootlike projections from their undersides known as stolons. Buds containing food storage cells can develop within the stolons and, when sufficiently separated from the &#x27;parent&#x27;, may grow into a new adult individual.

In other species, the postabdomen can elongate and break up into a string of separate buds, which can eventually form a new colony. In some, the pharyngeal part of the animal degenerates, and the abdomen breaks up into patches of germinal tissue, each combining parts of the epidermis, peritoneum, and digestive tract, and capable of growing into new individuals.

In yet others, budding begins shortly after the larva has settled onto the substrate. In the family Didemnidae, for instance, the individual essentially splits into two, with the pharynx growing a new digestive tract and the original digestive tract growing a new pharynx.

===DNA repair===
Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites are a common form of DNA damage that inhibit DNA replication and transcription. AP endonuclease 1 (APEX1), an enzyme produced by &quot;C. intestinalis&quot;, is employed in the repair of AP sites during early embryonic development. Lack of such repair leads to abnormal development. &quot;C. intestinalis&quot; also has a set of genes that encode proteins homologous to those employed in the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks in humans.

==Ecology==
The exceptional filtering capability of adult sea squirts causes them to accumulate pollutants that may be toxic to embryos and larvae as well as impede enzyme function in adult tissues. This property has made some species sensitive indicators of pollution.

Over the last few hundred years, most of the world&#x27;s harbors have been invaded by non-native sea squirts that have been introduced by accident from the shipping industry. Several factors, including quick attainment of sexual maturity, tolerance of a wide range of environments, and a lack of predators, allow sea squirt populations to grow rapidly. Unwanted populations on docks, ship hulls, and farmed shellfish cause significant economic problems, and sea squirt invasions have disrupted the ecosystem of several natural sub-tidal areas by smothering native animal species.

Sea squirts are the natural prey of many animals, including nudibranchs, flatworms, molluscs, rock crabs, sea stars, fish, birds, and sea otters. Some are also eaten by humans in many parts of the world, including Japan, Korea, Chile, and Europe (where they are sold under the name &quot;sea violet&quot;). As chemical defenses, many sea squirts intake and maintain an extremely high concentration of vanadium in the blood, have a very low pH of the tunic due to acid in easily ruptured bladder cells, and (or) produce secondary metabolites harmful to predators and invaders. Some of these metabolites are toxic to cells and are of potential use in pharmaceuticals.

==Evolution==
===Fossil record===
Ascidians are soft-bodied animals, and for this reason, their fossil record is almost entirely lacking. The earliest reliable ascidians is &quot;Shankouclava shankouense&quot; from the Lower Cambrian Maotianshan Shale (Yunnan, South China). There are also two enigmatic species from the Ediacaran period with some affinity to the ascidians – &quot;Ausia&quot; from the Nama Group of Namibia and &quot;Burykhia&quot; from the Onega Peninsula, White Sea of northern Russia.
They are also recorded from Lower Jurassic (Bonet and Benveniste-Velasquez, 1971; Buge and Monniot, 1972) and the Tertiary from France (Deflandre-Riguard, 1949, 1956; Durand, 1952; Deflandre and Deflandre-Rigaud, 1956; Bouche, 1962; Lezaud, 1966; Monniot and Buge, 1971; Varol and Houghton, 1996). Older (Triassic) records are ambiguous. From the Early Jurassic, the species &quot;Didemnum&quot; &quot;cassianum, Quadrifolium hesselboi, Palaeoquadrum ullmanni&quot; and other indet genera are recorded. The representatives of the genus Cystodytes (family Polycitoridae) have been described from the Pliocene of France by Monniot (1970, 1971) and Deflandre-Rigaud (1956), and from Eocene of France by Monniot and Buge (1971), and lately from the Late Eocene of S Australia by Łukowiak (2012).

===Phylogeny===
The ascidians were on morphological evidence treated as sister to the Thaliacea and Appendicularia, but molecular evidence has suggested that ascidians could be polyphyletic within the Tunicata, as shown in the following cladogram.

In 2017 and 2018, two studies were published, which suggested an alternate phylogeny, placing Appendicularia as sister to the rest of Tunicata, and Thaliacea nested inside Ascidiacea. A grouping of Thaliacea and Ascidiacea to the exclusion of Appendicularia had already been suggested for a long time, under the name of Acopa. Brusca &quot;et al&quot;. treat Ascidiacea as a monophyletic group including pelagic Thaliacea.

==Uses==
===Culinary===
Various ascidians are eaten by humans around the world as delicacies.

Sea pineapple (&quot;Halocynthia roretzi&quot;) is cultivated in Japan (&quot;hoya&quot;, &quot;maboya&quot;) and Korea (&quot;meongge&quot;). When served raw, they have a chewy texture and peculiar flavor likened to &quot;rubber dipped in ammonia&quot; which has been attributed to a naturally occurring chemical known as cynthiaol. &quot;Styela clava&quot; is farmed in parts of Korea where it is known as &quot;mideoduk&quot; and is added to various seafood dishes such as agujjim. Tunicate bibimbap is a specialty of Geoje Island, not far from Masan.

&quot;Microcosmus&quot; species from the Mediterranean Sea are eaten in France (&quot;figue de mer&quot;, &quot;violet&quot;), Italy (&quot;limone di mare&quot;, &quot;uova di mare&quot;) and Greece (&quot;fouska&quot;, &quot;φούσκα&quot;), for example, raw with lemon, or in salads with olive oil, lemon and parsley.

The &quot;piure&quot; (&quot;Pyura chilensis&quot;) is used in the cuisine of Chile – it is consumed both raw and in seafood stews similar to bouillabaisse.

&quot;Pyura praeputialis&quot; is known as &quot;cunjevoi&quot; in Australia. It was once used as a food source by Aboriginal people living around Botany Bay, but is now used mainly for fishing bait.

&quot;Ciona&quot; is being developed in Norway as a potential substitute meat protein, after processing to remove its &#x27;marine taste&#x27; and to make its texture less &#x27;squid-like&#x27;.

===Model organisms for research===
Several factors make sea squirts good models for studying the fundamental developmental processes of chordates, such as cell-fate specification. The embryonic development of sea squirts is simple, rapid, and easily manipulated. Because each embryo contains relatively few cells, complex processes can be studied at the cellular level, while remaining in the context of the whole embryo. 
The eggs of some species contain little yolk and are therefore transparent making them transparency ideal for fluorescent imaging. Its maternally-derived proteins are naturally associated with pigment (in a few species only), so cell lineages are easily labeled, allowing scientists to visualize embryogenesis from beginning to end.

Sea squirts are also valuable because of their unique evolutionary position: as an approximation of ancestral chordates, they can provide insight into the link between chordates and ancestral non-chordate deuterostomes, as well as the evolution of vertebrates from simple chordates. The sequenced genomes of the related sea squirts &quot;Ciona intestinalis&quot; and &quot;Ciona savignyi&quot; are small and easily manipulated; comparisons with the genomes of other organisms such as flies, nematodes, pufferfish and mammals provides valuable information regarding chordate evolution. A collection of over 480,000 cDNAs have been sequenced and are available to support further analysis of gene expression, which is expected to provide information about complex developmental processes and regulation of genes in vertebrates. Gene expression in embryos of sea squirts can be conveniently inhibited using Morpholino oligos.

<text>Cynegils () was King of Wessex from c. 611 to c. 642. Cynegils is traditionally considered to have been King of Wessex, even though the kingdoms of the Heptarchy had not yet formed from the patchwork of smaller kingdoms in his lifetime. The later kingdom of Wessex was centred on the counties of Hampshire, Dorset, Somerset and Wiltshire but the evidence of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; is that the kingdom of Cynegils was located on the upper River Thames, extending into northern Wiltshire and Somerset, southern Gloucestershire and Oxfordshire, and western Berkshire, with Dorchester-on-Thames as one of the major royal sites. This region, probably connected to the early tribal grouping known as the Gewisse, a term used by Bede for the West Saxons, lay on the frontier between the later kingdoms of Wessex and Mercia.

As for several other members of the ruling house of Wessex (including Cerdic, Ceawlin and Caedwalla) a Celtic, rather than Germanic, etymology for Cynegils&#x27;s name has been suggested, with the literal meaning of &#x27;grey dog&#x27;.

== Genealogy ==
It appears that Cynegils became king on the death of King Ceolwulf c. 611. His relationship with Ceolwulf is uncertain. Cynegils is variously described in West Saxon sources as being a son of Ceolwulf, a son of Ceol brother of Ceolwulf, a son of Ceola son of Cutha, a son of Cuthwine son of Ceawlin, and a son of Cuthwulf son of Cuthwine. Several of the sources give Cynegils a brother named Ceolwald, described as the grandfather of King Ine. Although the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; and Wessex king lists portray the West Saxons as ruled by a single king, the kingship was likely shared between two or more kings.

The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; for the year 611 states: &quot;This year Cynegils succeeded to the government in Wessex, and held it one and thirty winters. Cynegils was the son of Ceol, Ceol of Cutha, Cutha of Cynric.&quot; Contradicting this simple account, the entry under 614 states that &quot;This year Cynegils and Cwichelm fought at &quot;Beandun&quot;, and slew two thousand and forty-six of the Welsh.&quot; Likewise, Bede writes that the attempted assassination of King Edwin of Northumbria in 626 was ordered by Cwichelm, king of the West Saxons. Whether the King Cwichelm of 614 is the same person as the king of the late 620s, and whether this person is the same as the Cwichelm who was baptised, and died, c. 636, is disputed. Some historians presume Cwichelm to have been a son of Cynegils.

In 628, Cynegils and Cwichelm fought King Penda at Cirencester. &quot;The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; could be expected to report a victory, but does not, so Penda was likely the victor. Cynegils and Cwichelm appear to have been subject to Edwin of Northumbria by this time, paying an enormous tribute of a hundred thousand hides if Nick Higham&#x27;s conception of the Tribal Hidage&#x27;s origins is correct.

== Baptism ==
In the 630s, Bishop Birinus established himself at Dorchester, and both Cynegils and Cwichelm are said to have been baptised with King Oswald of Northumbria as their godfather. Another West Saxon king, named Cuthred, who died c. 661, appears at this time. Oswald married a daughter of Cynegils at this time. Her name is not recorded in early sources, but Reginald of Durham calls her Kyneburga (Cyneburg). This mission appears to have made a little long-term impact as Cynegils&#x27;s son Cenwalh was not baptised until 646, according to &quot;The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,&quot; after having been driven from his kingdom by Penda.

== Death ==
The date of Cynegils&#x27;s death is not certainly known. Bede states only that he was followed by his son Cenwalh. Different versions of &quot;The&quot; &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; give 641 (manuscripts B, C and E) or 643 (manuscripts A, G) for the year of Cenwalh&#x27;s accession. Many texts follow Dumville (1985), assuming that these variations both represent scribal deviations from 642, which would conform with the stated reign length of 31 years.

== Children ==
As well as Cenwalh, and the daughter who married Oswald, Cynegils is said to have had a son named Cwichelm, who may or may not be the same person as the king associated with Cynegils. It is said that King Centwine was a son of Cynegils, but there is strong circumstantial evidence that this identification was a later invention.

<doc id="930029" wikidata="Q5318249" url="?curid=930029" title="Dwight Tillery">
<text>Dwight Tillery (born March 10, 1948) is an American politician and social justice activist with more than 50 years of service working towards equity for African Americans and other minorities in politics, business and public health.  His leadership transformed the lives of Black residents in the city of Cincinnati in the areas of racial justice, education, civics, community health and politics.  Tillery was the first popularly elected Black Mayor in Cincinnati, Ohio, serving from 1991 to 1993, and he served on the Cincinnati City Council for 8 years.  Tillery co-founded the United Black Students Association at the University of Cincinnati, was the Founder, President and CEO of The Center for Closing the Health Gap, and co-founded The Black Agenda of Cincinnati.  Tillery also served as an adjunct professor at the University of Cincinnati and at Miami University.

== Early life ==
Tillery grew up in Cincinnati&#x27;s West End and Evanston and attended public schools, graduating from Withrow High School in 1966.

== Education ==
Tillery received a Bachelor of Arts in political science from the University of Cincinnati in 1970.  At UC he co-founded United Black Association, now the United Black Students Association, one of the first Black organizations to receive funding from the university. Tillery and his classmates’ activism was instrumental in the foundation of UC&#x27;s African American Studies department and recruitment of Black faculty members and trustees. Tillery and other members of the association pushed for creation of an African American Cultural and Resource Center, which would finally be established in 1990. Tillery received his Juris Doctor at University of Michigan Law School in 1972.  He also received an Honorary Doctorate of Technical Letters from Cincinnati Technical College in 1992.

== Career ==
Tillery is licensed to practice law in the State of Ohio, as well as the Federal District Court, the Sixth Circuit Appellate Court, and the United States Supreme Court.   He joined the law firm of Waite, Schneider, Bayless and Chesley Co., L.P.A. in 1991, and was the founding  partner at the law firm of Tillery and Associates in 1977.  He served as Assistant Solicitor for the City of Cincinnati from 1973 to 1974 and as Senior Assistant Attorney General of Ohio, 1983 to 1985.  He was also a consultant for the Office of Attorney General, Columbus in 1985.  He served for 2 years as the Vice President of the National Bar Association. He was a delegate to the 6th Circuit Judicial Conference from 1981 to 1985.  Tillery co-founded the Black Lawyers Association of Cincinnati in 1974.  He was elected twice as Vice President of the National Bar Association.

Tillery was an Adjunct Assistant Professor of Law and an assistant professor of African American Studies at the University of Cincinnati from 1975 to 1977, where he created the groundbreaking course “The Law and Black People,&quot; and he was an assistant professor of Business Law at Miami University in 1985.  He also served as University of Cincinnati Vice President from 1974 to 1977, and as Law School Consultant for UC from 1977 to 1978.  In 2016 the Tillery Fellowship was established in 2016 to recognize and support Master&#x27;s of Public Health students dedicated to improving public and community health for vulnerable populations.

Tillery stunned the city and became the first popularly elected Mayor of the city of Cincinnati in 1991 and served until 1993.  As Mayor, he established a task force on small business.  He was elected as Mayor after serving for ten months as a member of the Cincinnati City Council.   He again served on the Cincinnati City Council from 1993 to 1998. He served as the Chair of the City Council&#x27;s Finance Committee, Vice Chair of the Law and Public Safety Committee and a member of the Community Development, Housing and Zoning Committee. A major focus of Tillery&#x27;s political career was to increase involvement of the Black community in economic, political, and educational development.  As Mayor, he created the Mayor&#x27;s Commission on Children, Reshaping Youth Priorities, which was the first anti-violence initiative targeting youth offered by the Cincinnati Health Department. He played a key role in establishing a venture capital fund of eleven million dollars for African American businesses, and he assisted in establishing a mentoring program for minority businesses. One of the most significant businesses started through these efforts was the Blue Chip Broadcasting Company, which ultimately licensed 13 radio stations which was valued at $188 million when it merged with the Urban One family of companies in 1995. Mayor Tillery also enabled the first-time appointments of minorities to the operating boards of the OHIO Gas &amp; Electric Co. and the Cincinnati Bell Telephone Company. As a City Council member, Tillery founded Grassroots Academy, an organization which taught hundreds of people of “low to moderate income” leadership skills, strategic planning, understanding government and identifying resources, thus empowering residents to help their communities.  In response to concerns that the Avondale Community (a predominantly Black neighborhood) did not have a grocery store, Tillery persuaded City Council to provide the resources to a group of Avondale ministers interested in revitalizing the Avondale Town Center. He also negotiated the appointment of Cincinnati&#x27;s first Black Assistant Police Chief.

In 2004, Tillery founded The Center for Closing the Health Gap in order to address significant health differences between African American, Latino and White Appalachian populations.  The Center quickly gained national acclaim as a model for addressing health disparities. Tillery served as Founder, President and CEO until 2019.  The center works with more than 100  different organizations, including the City Council, the Cincinnati chapter of the National Action Network, the Baptist Ministers Conference, and the Black Nurses Association of Greater Cincinnati as well as a host of other universities, hospitals, government associations and businesses. Some of the center&#x27;s initiatives include the Do Right! Campaign which works with individuals to adopt healthier lifestyle choices regarding diet and exercise, the Cincinnati Fresh Food Retail Financing Fund and the City of Cincinnati Food Access Task force, which works to address the issue of food deserts in the city, and an Annual Health Expo attended by thousands which provides free health screenings for early detection of more than 20 health issues. The center also works to raise awareness of health disparities, increase cultural competency and encourage diversity in the health care provider work force.

In 2016, Tillery was the co-convener of The Black Agenda Cincinnati.  Among other things, the Black Agenda partnered with The Cincinnati Herald newspaper to create Cincinnati Black History, a digital platform that provides a space for people to “share and preserve unfiltered stories of Black Heritage.”

<doc id="930032" wikidata="Q765265" url="?curid=930032" title="Ariel Ze'evi">
<text>Ariel &quot;Arik&quot; Ze&#x27;evi (, born 16 January 1977) is an Israeli retired dan 6 black belt in judo. He had a long and successful career competing in half-heavyweight judo competitions. He won an Olympic bronze medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics in the men&#x27;s 100 kg judo competition.

==Biography==
Ze&#x27;evi is Jewish, and was born and raised in Bnei Brak, Israel, a predominantly Orthodox Jewish city in the Tel Aviv metropolitan area.

While growing up, he trained in the local judo club in his neighborhood, together with his older brother, Roni, who was also the club&#x27;s first local gold medal pioneer after having finished first in the national Israeli Judo Championships. Ze&#x27;evi, heavily influenced by his brother and his accomplishment, began training intensively, and at the age of 15 won his first national competition in the adult class, becoming the country&#x27;s youngest champion ever. Despite the lack of advanced training facilities, Ze&#x27;evi continued training in his local club and steadily closed the gap to world class level, and began competing abroad.

In his personal life, Ze&#x27;evi obtained a LLB degree from Reichman University (formerly Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya) in Herzliya.

He also hosted a sports television show for the Israeli Broadcasting Authority.

==Judo career==
Ze&#x27;evi won a bronze medal in judo in the 95 kg at the 1997 Maccabiah Games.

Ze&#x27;evi placed 5th competing for Israel at the 2000 Summer Olympics in the men&#x27;s 100 kg division, before winning a bronze medal representing Israel at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens 2004 in the men&#x27;s 100 kg division.

Ze&#x27;evi won European Championships gold in 2001, 2003, 2004 and 2012 and silve in 2005. He has also won four bronze medals in European Championships. Ze&#x27;evi also won the silver medal in the open category at the 2001 World Championships.

Ze&#x27;evi missed the 2005 World championships in Cairo due to a shoulder injury, and subsequently underwent surgery to repair the damage.

Representing Israel at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Ze&#x27;evi failed to win a medal after losing his second match in the repechage bracket. Ze&#x27;evi told the Israeli media he does not want to end his career without a victory (probably hinting at the Judo World Championships in 2009).

According to the International Judo Federation&#x27;s World Ranking List, as of April 2012, Ze&#x27;evi was ranked #8.

Ze&#x27;evi became a European champion for the fourth time in 2012, winning the competition in Chelyabinsk, Russia.

<text>The Lancashire Infantry Museum, formerly known as the Queen&#x27;s Lancashire Regiment Museum, is located at Fulwood Barracks in Preston, Lancashire, England. The museum claims to be &quot;largest Regimental archive and the premier centre for military historical research in the North of England.&quot;

==History==
The museum was founded as the museum of the Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire) in 1929. It chronicles the men of Lancashire who fought for their country during the wars. It also acts as an archive of battles fought by the Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment and its antecedent regiments, including the Queen&#x27;s Lancashire Regiment, the East Lancashire Regiment, the South Lancashire Regiment, the Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire) and the Lancashire Regiment (Prince of Wales&#x27;s Volunteers). In all, the museum&#x27;s collections cover 120 separate units, including the 59 battalions formed by the antecedent Lancashire regiments during the First World War, and all associated Militia, Rifle Volunteers, Territorials, Home Guard and Cadet units.

An important exhibit is the French Imperial Eagle captured by Ensign John Pratt of the 30th Regiment of Foot from the French &quot;22nd Régiment d&#x27;Infanterie de Ligne&quot; at the Battle of Salamanca in July 1812. The museum also displays items from its collections in other area museums, including the Museum of Lancashire, Blackburn Museum and Art Gallery, Towneley Hall and Warrington Museum &amp; Art Gallery.

<text>The British Commercial Vehicle Museum displays antiquarian buses, early fire engines and other historical and commercial vehicles produced by the British manufacturing industry.

The museum is located in King Street, Leyland, Lancashire on part of a site previously occupied by the Leyland Motors factory, the source of many exhibits.

Funding methods include the admission charges and membership tickets. More recently, a major investment by the Heritage Lottery Fund has contributed to a major refurbishment and website redesign by local digital agency Fertile Frog. The museum is now open throughout the year( see website for details ).

Events include Classic Vehicles, Model Makers Exhibition and the Spring Transport Show.

In 2010, the museum was one of three featured on Richard Macer&#x27;s BBC Four series Behind the Scenes at the Museum.

==Exhibits ==
Exhibits include the purpose built Popemobile from the Pastoral trip of Pope John Paul II to the United Kingdom in 1982. The 24-ton armour-plated vehicle was built for the visit by British Leyland.

Other exhibits that have been displayed include a WWI Gun Tractor, a Leyland Tiger Cub, historic lorries, vintage buses and a Steam Driven Showman&#x27;s Tractor.

<doc id="930043" wikidata="Q173890" url="?curid=930043" title="Danielle Dax">
<text>Danielle Gardner (born 23 September 1958), known professionally as Danielle Dax, is an English rock musician, music producer, and artist most active from the late-1970s to the mid-1990s.

==Early life==
She was born Danielle Gardner, in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, England. Dax&#x27;s first performance on stage in London was when she was a child. She sang in Benjamin Britten&#x27;s opera, &quot;Noye&#x27;s Fludde&quot; (Noah&#x27;s Flood), at the Royal Albert Hall. Preceding this, the first time Dax appeared on stage was at the age of three as an orange Jelly Baby on the Southend bandstand. After a short modelling career (she won the &quot;Miss Evening Echo&quot; competition in 1976), she turned to music.

==Career==
Dax made her popular music debut in 1979, within three weeks of joining the group Amii Toytal and the Croixroads (a pseudonym for Lemon Kittens) as keyboardist, flautist and saxophonist. It was their first gig and took place at Reading University&#x27;s Student Union Airport Bar. Karl Blake from Lemon Kittens had met her some three weeks earlier after he read an article about her in a local newspaper. Blake was in urgent need of an artist, so he attended the next meeting of Dax&#x27;s arts group and was introduced to her. Upon learning that she could also play saxophone and flute, he immediately recruited her for the band; in addition, he also got her to agree to do the cover artwork for the planned release. She ended up doing the cover artwork for all of Lemon Kittens releases.

During Dax&#x27;s time in the avant-garde new wave music band Lemon Kittens, she was included on Robert Fripp&#x27;s band The League of Gentlemen&#x27;s 1981 eponymous album, performing vocals (credited as &quot;Hamsprachtmusic&quot;) on the song &quot;Minor Man&quot;. However, that song was not included on the album when it was released on the CD compilation entitled &quot;God Save The King&quot;. Her artwork was retained for the cover. She also painted the cover for Robert Fripp&#x27;s solo album, &quot;Let the Power Fall&quot;. Dax supplied vocals to an unreleased track by the Bombay Ducks in which she sang a duet with Robert Wyatt, although they never met. The duet was done in studio, separately.

In early 1982, after the Lemon Kittens went into &quot;extended hibernation&quot;, Dax embarked on her solo career, recording and producing the albums &quot;Pop-Eyes&quot; (1983) wherein she played all the instruments herself, initially released on the IRC [Initial Recording Company] label with her own art cover, and re-released on Awesome Records with a Holly Warburton cover. On the mini-album that followed &quot;Jesus Egg That Wept&quot; (1984), she was aided on some tracks by Karl Blake or David Knight. Her third album &quot;Inky Bloaters&quot; (1987), cemented her collaborative recording work with David Knight; this as well as various EPs, up to that time, were released on the label Awesome Records. In 1988, she signed with Sire Records, which released her album &quot;Dark Adapted Eye&quot;, which contained material from her previous recordings.

In 1984, she made her first film appearance as the Wolfgirl (a non-speaking role) in &quot;The Company of Wolves&quot; by Neil Jordan. In 1988, her film credits came to include writing music for the short avant-garde film &quot;Axel&quot; by Nigel Wingrove.

In 1989, Dax appeared on the Channel 4 show &quot;Star Test&quot;.

In 1990, she released her one major-label studio album, &quot;Blast the Human Flower&quot;, produced by Stephen Street, except for the tracks &quot;Bayou&quot; and &quot;Daisy&quot;, which they produced together. The album&#x27;s single, &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;, joined &quot;Blue Christmas&quot; (her cover of an Elvis Presley tune), &quot;Kites&quot; by Simon Dupree and the Big Sound (during the Lemon Kittens period) and &quot;Hate on Sight&quot;, a track by Shock Headed Peters (included on her &quot;Comatose etc.&quot; release) as an addition to her covers of other artists&#x27; work. Her last two album releases were in 1995 and consisted of a career retrospective double-album entitled &quot;Comatose Non-Reaction: The Thwarted Pop Career of Danielle Dax&quot; and an EP of new avant-garde and almost completely instrumental material called &quot;Timber Tongue&quot; (both on her own Biter of Thorpe label). Dax&#x27;s career in the music business then went on indefinite hiatus and is often referred to as a retirement.

Since 1996, she has worked in interior design and has appeared several times on the BBC interior design show &quot;Homefront&quot;, where she won the Designer of the Year Award.

In 2017, Dax performed at London&#x27;s Cafe Oto as part of UnicaZürn with David Knight, David J. Smith and Stephen Thrower. She had previously contributed lyrics, vocals and artwork for the group&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;Temporal Bends&quot;.

On 4 November 2022, a new single was released by Danielle Dax titled &quot;Invictus Arduis&quot;. The single was released on transparent vinyl by the independent label Heaven&#x27;s Lathe. One hundred copies were printed and sold out within two minutes. The project was made with her longtime collaborator David Knight, and featured experimental instrumentation by Dax and Knight and a singing and spoken word by Dax. Lyrics from the previously released songs &quot;Cutting The Last Sheaf&quot;, &quot;Born To Be Bad&quot; and &quot;Whistling For His Love&quot; have been used for the project. This is the first newly released material in 27 years, since the release of the &quot;Timber Tongue&quot; EP in 1995.

<text>Charolais (; also Charollais) is a historic region of France, named after the central town of Charolles, and located in today&#x27;s Saône-et-Loire &quot;département&quot;, in Burgundy.

==History==
It was held by the French noble house of Chalon-Arlay, until in 1237 Count John the Old ceded it to Duke Hugh IV of Burgundy. The county of Charolais was inherited by Hugh&#x27;s granddaughter Beatrice, who in 1272 married Count Robert of Clermont, a younger son of King Louis IX of France and progenitor of the House of Bourbon. In 1314 it passed to Robert&#x27;s second son John, whose daughter Beatrice married Count John I of Armagnac in 1327.

John&#x27;s grandson Count Bernard VII of Armagnac sold the county to Duke Philip II of Burgundy in 1390. It thus became part of the Duchy of Burgundy and the title &#x27;Count of Charolais&#x27; was systematically given to the heir apparent of the incumbent duke. After the death of the last Valois-Burgundy duke Charles the Bold at the 1477 Battle of Nancy, the county was seized by King Louis XI of France–against the fierce resistance by the Habsburg archduke Maximilian I of Austria, husband of Charles&#x27; daughter Mary. The same year however, loyal to the duchess Mary, daughter of Charles the Bold, the County of Charolais rebelled and expelled the French. After the War of the Burgundian Succession, Charolais legally returned to the Habsburg dynasty according to the 1493 Treaty of Senlis, though it remained a French fief. Surrounded by French royal possessions, the County of Charolais, former inheritance of the heir to the ducal throne, remained the last reminder of Burgundy as a European power, when it was ruled by dukes from the House of Valois-Burgundy, also known as the Great Dukes of the West. 

The County of Charolais shared a common history with the Imperial County of Burgundy (&quot;Franche-Comté&quot;), as both passed to the future Emperor Charles V in 1506 and with the Imperial estates of the Burgundian Circle (the Franche-Comté and the Spanish Netherlands) were held by Habsburg Spain under Charles&#x27; son Philip II from 1555 onwards.

While the County of Burgundy fell to the French crown upon the 1678 Treaty of Nijmegen, Charolais was acquired by the Bourbon prince Louis of Condé in 1684. It was not awarded to the French crown until the death of Count Charles of Charolais in 1760, when Louis XV incorporated it into the Estates of Burgundy.

<text>René Just Haüy () FRS MWS FRSE (28 February 1743 – 1 June 1822) was a French priest and mineralogist, commonly styled the Abbé Haüy after he was made an honorary canon of Notre Dame. Due to his innovative work on crystal structure and his four-volume &quot;Traité de Minéralogie&quot; (1801), he is often referred to as the &quot;Father of Modern Crystallography&quot;. During the French Revolution he also helped to establish the metric system. 

==Biography==
=== Early life ===
René-Just Haüy was born at Saint-Just-en-Chaussée on February 28, 1743, in the province of Picardy (later the &quot;département&quot; of Oise). His parents were Just Haüy, a poor linen-weaver, and his wife Magdeleine Candelot.

Haüy&#x27;s interest in the services and music of the local church brought him to the attention of the prior of a nearby abbey of Premonstrants. Through him, Haüy was introduced to a colleague in Paris and obtained a scholarship to the College of Navarre. Haüy eventually became an usher, and in 1764, was appointed regent (master) of the fourth class.

Haüy also progressed in his religious training. He was tonsured in 1762, took minor orders in 1765, was appointed a subdeacon in 1767, became a deacon in 1769, and was ordained as a Roman Catholic priest in 1770.

After his ordination, Haüy became regent (teacher) of the second class at the Collège du Cardinal-Lemoine.
Through his friendship with his spiritual director, Abbé Lhomond, Haüy became interested first in botany, and after hearing a lecture by Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton, in mineralogy.

His brother Valentin Haüy was the founder of the first school for the blind, the Institution des Jeunes Aveugles (Institute for Blind Youth) in Paris.

===Crystallography===

An accident apparently directed René-Just Haüy&#x27;s attention to what became a new field in natural history, crystallography. Haüy was examining a broken specimen of calcareous spar in the collection of Jacques de France de Croisset. (According to some accounts, Haüy dropped the specimen and caused it to break.) He became intrigued by the perfectly smooth plane of the fracture.


Studying the fragments inspired Haüy to make further experiments in crystal cutting. Breaking down crystals to the smallest pieces possible, Haüy concluded that each type of crystal has a fundamental primitive, nucleus or “integrant molecule” of a particular shape, that could not be broken further without destroying both the physical and chemical nature of the crystal. He further argued that crystal structures are made up of orderly arrangements of these integrant molecules in successive layers, according to geometrical laws of crystallization. 
Crystals that had been classed together previously were identified as being of separate mineral species if their fundamental structure differed. Heavyspar, for example, was differentiated into specimens containing barium and strontium. 
The value of Haüy&#x27;s discovery was immediately recognized.

Haüy and his contemporaries worked with limited evidence. They could observe a crystal&#x27;s habit and cleavage planes and measure interfacial angles with an instrument called a goniometer. The internal structure underlying the crystal&#x27;s integrant molecule would not be determinable until the development of X-Ray diffraction technology many years later, in 1902. Haüy was not the only researcher to observe that calcite crystals could be composed of smaller rhombohedra, but it was he who introduced the idea of triple periodicity in crystals. This idea was fundamental to later developments in the field on crystal lattices.

Between 1784 and 1822, Haüy published more than 100 reports discussing his theories and their application to the structure of crystalline substances.
Haüy first stated his law of decrement in &quot;Essai d&#x27;une théorie sur la structure des crystaux&quot; (1784). It was a radical departure from his previous works, introducing his theory of &quot;molé constituantes&quot; or constituent molecules. By 1792, he had identified a number of parallelepipeds as possible primitive crystal forms. Haüy first lectured about his law of symmetry in 1795 but it was not until 1815 that it was finally published. Haüy worked out the mathematical theory of his work in his &quot;Traité de minéralogie&quot; (1801), which became a classic in the field. By then, Haüy had applied his ideas to the differentiation of different species. He systematically described all the known minerals, sorting them into classes, and giving their chemical and geometrical properties. His work, in four volumes, including an atlas of plates, was accounted among the most wonderful of the 19th century. It has been described as &quot;a work of comprehensive insight, and much of it, written with literary fluency&quot;. A second updated edition appeared as &quot;Traité de cristallographie&quot; in 1822.

Haüy created comprehensive collections containing hundreds of pear-wood models of crystal models for education and demonstrations. One such set was acquired by Martin van Marum, curator of the Teylers Museum and a director of the Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen.

Haüy is also known for his observations on pyroelectricity. He detected pyroelectricity in calamine, an oxide of zinc, as early as 1785. 
He studied pyroelectricity in a number of other minerals including tourmaline and related them to crystalline structure. He showed that electricity in tourmaline was strongest at the poles of the crystal and became imperceptible at the middle. Haüy published a book on electricity and magnetism, &quot;Exposition raisonné de la théorie de l&#x27;électricité et du magnétisme, d&#x27;après les principes d&#x27;Æpinus&quot;, in 1787.

On February 12, 1783, Haüy was elected to the Académie royale des sciences de Paris (French Academy of Sciences) with the rank of an adjoint in botany, there being no vacancy in either physics or mineralogy. In 1788, he became as an associate in natural history and mineralogy.

===French Revolution===
During the French Revolution, Haüy refused to take an oath accepting the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, and became a non-juring priest. He was thrown into prison after the monarchy was overthrown on August 10, 1792. Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire interceded on his behalf. Haüy was released just a few days before the September Massacres of September 2–7, 1792 in which many of the clergy were killed.

On August 8, 1793, in spite of the efforts of Antoine Lavoisier, the Académie royale des sciences de Paris was dissolved by the National Convention. It was not restored until August 22, 1795, when it became known as the Institut National des Sciences et des Arts (National Institute of Sciences and Arts).

Before its suppression, the Academy of Sciences had formed a working group to develop a uniform system of weights and measures for use throughout France. Lavoisier was a major proponent, and on March 30, 1791, he submitted a plan on behalf of the Commission on Weights and Measures, which was adopted by the Constituent Assembly. Lavoisier and Haüy were tasked with determining the density of water. As of January 4, 1793, they determined the weight of a cubic decimeter of distilled water at the temperature of melting ice, the kilogram.

On August 1, 1793, the National Convention passed a decree, in favor of developing uniform weights and measures across France. On September 11, 1793, they established a Temporary Commission of Weights and Measures made up of twelve scientists, including Haüy, whose task was to carry out the decree. 
The work of the commission was disrupted by political events. In November 1793, Lavoisier and several others were arrested and removed from the Commission. On May 8, 1794, Lavoisier was guillotined.
Nonetheless, Haüy remained secretary of the Commission through this turmoil. The law of 18 Germinal an III was enacted on April 7, 1795, formally establishing the metric system in France.

On July 12, 1794, a public decree reorganized the École des Mines (School of Mines) in Paris and specified the establishment of a Cabinet of Mineralogy, a collection of all Earth materials. In October 1794, René Just Haüy was appointed the first curator of the Cabinet of Mineralogy, later known as the Musée de Minéralogie. He may therefore be considered a founder of the Musée de Minéralogie.

On November 9, 1794, Haüy also became a professor of physics at the École normale supérieure.
In 1802, Haüy became a professor of mineralogy at the Muséum national d&#x27;Histoire naturelle (National Museum of Natural History).

Haüy&#x27;s work was appreciated by Napoleon, who made Haüy an Honorary Canon of the Eglise Métropolitain de Paris (Notre Dame) on April 5, 1802. On November 28, 1803, Haüy became one of the first recipients of the Order of the Légion d&#x27;Honneur. Napoleon encouraged Haüy to write &quot;Traité élémentaire de physique&quot; (1803), and is reported to have read it during his incarceration on Elba in 1814. During his brief return to power in 1815, Napoleon promoted Haüy to officer of the Légion d&#x27;Honneur.

After 1814 Haüy was deprived of his appointments by the Restoration government. He spent his final days in poverty, dying in Paris on June 1, 1822, even if &quot;June 3&quot; is systematically reported. The confusion in Haüy&#x27;s death date (June 1 instead of June 3) is an 1823 error by Cuvier, rectified in 1944 by A. Lacroix but still often misreported.

==Recognition==

In 1817, René-Just Haüy was elected an honorary member of the New York Academy of Sciences.

His name is the thirteenth inscribed on the south-east side of the Eiffel Tower.

The mineral Haüyne was named for Haüy in 1807 by Thomas-Christophe Bruun-Neergaard. It occurs in silica-deficient igneous rocks in a wide variety of locations.

<text>Huacachina is a village built around a small oasis and surrounded by sand dunes in southwestern Peru. It is about five kilometers from the city of Ica in the Ica District of Ica Province. The oasis was introduced as a feature on the back of the 50 nuevo sol note in 1991. Huacachina has a permanent population of around 100 people, although it hosts many tens of thousands of tourists each year.

The name comes from , possibly shortened from . 

==Oasis and lake==
Huacachina is built around a small natural desert lake, commonly referred to as the &quot;oasis of America&quot;. According to local legends, the water and mud of the area are therapeutic. Both locals and tourists often bathe in the waters or cover themselves with the mud in an attempt to cure ailments such as arthritis, rheumatism, asthma, and bronchitis.

Legend holds that the lagoon was created by a beautiful native princess, she removed her clothes to bathe, but after looking in a mirror she saw a male hunter approaching her from behind, startled at the intrusion, she fled the area, leaving behind her mirror, which turned into a lake. Other versions hold that she fled, leaving the pool of water she had been bathing in to become the lagoon. The folds of her mantle, streaming behind her as she ran, became the surrounding sand dunes. The woman herself is rumoured to still live in the oasis as a mermaid.

The lake was created by natural seepage from underground aquifers, but the increase in well-drilling started to threaten that supply in the early 2000s. To compensate for the loss, and preserve the oasis as a destination for tourists, local business groups began pumping water into the lake in 2015.

It was announced in 2016 that the Peruvian scientist Marino Morikawa, who created a nanobubble system to decontaminate lake El Cascajo, would lead a project to restore the Huacachina lagoon. , no further news of the proposal has been forthcoming.

==Activities==
Huacachina is a resort geared to local families from the nearby city of Ica, but is increasingly an attraction for tourists drawn by the sports of sandboarding on the sand dunes that reach heights of up to . Another popular activity is dune buggy rides on vehicles known locally as &quot;areneros. &quot;Huacachina has been a favourite family destination for decades, and in the 60s was a popular summer resort for tourists around the world.&quot;
