<text>Selebi-Phikwe (also spelt &quot;Selibe Phikwe&quot;) is a mining town located in the Central District of Botswana. It had a population of 42,488 in 2022. The town is an administrative district, separate from the surrounding Central District.

== Mining ==
Nickel mining commenced in 1973 and has been the main activity since. The complex includes a mine and a smelter. All operations are now deep mining. Originally there were two tiny places called Selebi and Phikwe, which straddled a large undiscovered deposit of copper and nickel in the area. When the mineral wealth of the area was discovered in the 1960s a mine and a township were built in the woodland between the places with the combined name of Selebi-Phikwe.

The main source of employment was the BCL Limited mine which excavated and smelted mixed copper-nickel ore from several shafts in deep and opencast mines. The opencast pit is now unused. Ore is transported from the shaft by rail for smelting. The locomotives used were steam-powered, having been bought from National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) and South African Railways (SAR).

BCL only intended to stay in operation until 2010 and more recently 2013. It finally ceased operations in September 2016 putting thousands out of work.

== Government and infrastructure ==
The Botswana Prison Service (BPS) operates the Selebi-Phikwe Prison.

Phikwe Industrial Area provides premises for Factories and Business Houses as ancillary for the Mine. Construction companies include Watson, GSP, etc., SP Electricals, Britannia Backers, George Backers and Change and CO.

The town is also home to the Eastern Military Garrison run by the Botswana Defence Force.

Voice of America Botswana Shortwave Relay Facility: in 1991 the VOA inaugurated a shortwave transmitter at Moepeng Hill, about 20 km. from Selebi-Phikwe, a nickel and copper mining center. Owned jointly by the VOA and Radio Botswana, the station had operated on mediumwave since 1981.

== Energy ==

A small coal-fired power station was built along with the mine to meet the electricity needs of the mining operation and the surrounding area. Until the late 1980s, this was the only power station in Botswana. It was closed down some years ago when the Morupule Power Station began to produce power. Most of the electricity demand was met by importing electricity from South Africa. In the current situation of &#x27;rationing&#x27; by the South African power supplier Eskom, Botswana suffers from power shortages.

In 2010, a private company ENERGY POINT (PTY) LTD, promoted by a foreign direct investor from India, started its operation of the Manufacturing of UPS, inverters, surge protectors etc. But the investor could not continue due to non compliance of BEDI and a government promise to provide basic infrastructure such as industrial land etc. Still, the company made a significant mark in this area giving most of the businesses and residences an uninterrupted power supply.

== Amenities and tourism ==

The town itself has a principal shopping mall, First Shopping Mall LESEDI shopping mall with ABC Bank and Barclays Extension Counter, Phikwe Square. There are five in-town hotels (Hotel Stonehouse, Hotel Selebi, Cresta Bosele, Syringa Lodge and Travel Inn), several guest houses and a number of serviced apartment complexes. The Phokoje Bush Lodge is about seven kilometres from town. The town has a small airport which only operates during daylight hours but does not have refuelling facilities. It has a technical college for artisan level training. A College of Applied Arts &amp; Technology is being planned.

The town is on a tourist route from South Africa to the popular destinations of Okavango and Chobe. There is significant potential for birdwatching and fishing (bass and bream are well established but are not indigenous) at the Letsibogo Dam but, unfortunately, it is difficult to gain access to the dam due to rough terrain and necessity to camp on the shore. An experimental population of tigerfish (indigenous to the Limpopo basin) was introduced in 2009 which has proven that the environment would be suitable. The introduced population is thought to be insufficient for breeding. There are some local camp sites a few kilometres away from the dam. The water and wildlife at Letsibogo do not appear to have been negatively impacted by the pollution from BCL.

Selebi-Phikwe has seven government schools and across the town, Selebi Phikwe Senior Secondary School. Private schools include Kopano Primary, Morula Primary and Mount Pleasant Primary.

Selebi Phikwe hosts the biggest marathon in Botswana, the Phikwe Marathon; it was started by the late Boet Kahts and Phill Roberts who was a teacher at Selebi Phikwe Senior Secondary School in 1985 as a gesture of Community Service. The Marathon is classified as one of the best in the world by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). A report for SPEDU (Selebi Phikwe Economic Development), a local Regional Development Agency, suggests that there is significant potential for expansion of the marathon and also to apply the skills and experience gained by running that event for other events such as cross country cycling and quad biking and for bass fishing competitions at the Letsibogo Dam. The latter site also offers potential for bird watching and sailing if the infrastructure mentioned above were to be established.

<text>The women&#x27;s 4 × 100 metre freestyle relay took place on 14 August at the Olympic Aquatic Centre of the Athens Olympic Sports Complex in Athens, Greece.

For the first time in 48 years, Australia (Alice Mills, Lisbeth Lenton, Petria Thomas, and Jodie Henry) won the gold medal in the event, overhauling Team USA on the final leg. When Henry touched the wall at 3:35.94, the Australians broke a new world record under a 0.06-second mark set by the Germans in 2002 (3:36.00). Henry also unleashed a remarkable relay split of 52.95, the fastest of all-time in Olympic history.

The U.S. team of Kara Lynn Joyce, Natalie Coughlin, Amanda Weir, and Jenny Thompson finished out an American record of 3:36.39 to earn a silver medal, while the Dutch took home the bronze in 3:37.59, after Inge de Bruijn swam a split of 53.37 to hold off the Germans anchored by Franziska van Almsick.

<text>Seva Foundation is an international non-profit health organization based in Berkeley, California, known for preventing and treating blindness and other visual impairments. It was co-founded in 1978 by Dr. Larry Brilliant, Ram Dass, Wavy Gravy, Nicole Grasset and Govindappa Venkataswamy. Steve Jobs served as an early adviser and major contributor.

Seva works with local communities in more than 20 countries around the world to develop locally-run, culturally appropriate, self-sustaining programs to increase access to eye care. Seva works with local eye health hospitals and clinics in central Asia, southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and throughout sub-Saharan Africa. The foundation also works with Native communities in North America through its American Indian Sight Initiative.

==History==
Seva Foundation, based in Berkeley, California, was founded in 1978 by public health expert Larry Brilliant, spiritual leader Ram Dass and humanitarian activist Wavy Gravy. Other co-founders include Dr. Govindappa Venkataswamy, founder of the Aravind Eye Foundation, and Nicole Grasset, the senior adviser for the World Health Organization smallpox eradication campaign. Steve Jobs also participated as an adviser at early Seva meetings and provided the first significant cash donation along with an Apple II to enter and analyze eye care survey results in the original Nepal program.

According to the Seva Foundation&#x27;s website, &quot;Seva (pronounced Say-Va) is a Sanskrit word meaning &#x27;selfless service to others&#x27; and came to represent for us the dream of relieving suffering and reducing poverty in the most effective ways possible.&quot;

<text>During the 1980s and 1990s, a relatively large number of companies appeared selling primarily 2D graphics cards and later 3D. Most of those companies have subsequently disappeared, as the increasing complexity of GPUs substantially increased research and development costs. Many of these companies subsequently went bankrupt or were bought out. Amongst the notable discrete graphics card vendors, AMD and Nvidia are the only ones that have lasted. In 2022, Intel entered the discrete GPU market with the Arc series and has three more generations confirmed on two year release schedules.

<doc id="906366" wikidata="Q5661696" url="?curid=906366" title="Harold Maxwell-Lefroy">
<text>Harold Maxwell-Lefroy (20 January 1877 – 14 October 1925) was an English entomologist. He served as a Professor of Entomology at Imperial College London before moving to India where he took over the position of entomologist to the government of India from Lionel de Niceville. He was later made the first Imperial Entomologist to India. He left India after two of his children died from insect-borne diseases. He worked on applied entomology and initiated experiments on the use of chemicals to control insects. A formula he developed was utilized to save Westminster Hall from destruction by wood-boring beetles, while others were used to control lice in the trenches during the First World War. The success of his chemicals led to increased demand and the founding of Rentokil, a company for insecticide production. He was killed in an accident while experimenting with fumigants to control insects.

==Biography==

Maxwell-Lefroy was born in the village of Crondall, Hampshire, to Charles James Maxwell Lefroy of the 14th Hussars (whose grandfather was James Walker who had designed the Regent or Vauxhall Bridge in 1816) and Elizabeth Catherine, daughter of Alfred Henry McClintock, a Dublin surgeon. The hyphenated form Maxwell-Lefroy was adopted in 1875. He grew up in the family&#x27;s Itchel Manor, on an ancient site which had once been property of the Bishop of Winchester. The manor itself is mentioned in the Domesday Book, and was filled with stories of ghosts and their hauntings (and demolished in 1954). As a child he was raised in an environment of opulence, with many servants at home to take care of the house and his needs.

=== Education ===
Harold was sent to school in Church Hill House in Crondall where one of his contemporaries, although a boarder unlike Maxwell-Lefroy, was Claude Grahame-White. He was later sent to study in Germany, and after returning to England in 1890 he was sent to Marlborough College where he was in Preshute House under master W.E. Mullins. Oddly he did not join the Natural History Society at school, contemporary members of which included William Keble Martin, Arthur Hill, and Lawrence C.H. Young (who went to Bombay in 1901 to work in a local business and also contributed to studies of the lepidoptera in the Bombay Natural History Society collections and died young in 1907). He finished school in 1895 and joined King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, receiving a BA in the natural science tripos with first class in 1898. His specialization in entomology was influenced by David Sharp. He received a master&#x27;s degree in 1902.

=== West Indies ===
Maxwell-Lefroy briefly served as assistant master at Seaford College, and then joined as an entomologist in Barbados from 1899. Before he left Barbados he got engaged to Kathleen Hamilton O&#x27;Meara, daughter of a former Provost Marshal in British Guiana from a Catholic family, leading to some disapproval from his mother and sister. His entomological work in this period was published in the form of several bulletins.

=== India ===

In 1903, Maxwell-Lefroy was appointed entomologist to the Government of India (succeeding Lionel de Nicéville, who was the first government entomologist, appointed in 1901). The appointment may have been influenced by David Sharp. The salary in India was set at 750 rupees a month rising 50 a year to a maximum of 1000 a month. He sailed aboard the P&amp;O steamer &quot;Borneo&quot; on 27 March and reached Bombay on 30 April 1903. He was then sent to Calcutta where he was to report to E.P. Stebbing. He married Kathleen on 22 January 1904 in a Catholic wedding at the Cathedral of the Holy Name, Bombay. 

In 1904, Maxwell-Lefroy was assisted by K. P. Ukkendan Unni Nair, a zoologist trained at the Madras Christian College. Several Indian assistants worked with him including S.C. Misra from Nagpur who had worked at Rajkumar College, C.C. Ghosh from Calcutta University who was in-charge of the Pusa insectary, Gobindram Dutt from Punjab and D. Nowroji from Madras University. In 1905 he was involved in the establishment of the Imperial Agricultural Research Institute in Pusa, in the Indian state of Bihar, and was appointed the first Imperial Entomologist. He was assisted by F.M. Howlett who was appointed the Second Imperial Entomologist (later called Imperial Pathological Entomologist, a position that was abolished in 1912). Although mainly involved in work on agricultural pests, he also took an interest in medical and veterinary entomology. In 1907 he oversaw studies to examine whether there was a possibility for Indian insects to spread sleeping sickness brought in by Indian workers returning from Africa.

In October 1908 he accepted permanent employment with the Government of India. Maxwell-Lefroy convened a series of meetings on an all-India basis, to bring together all the entomologists of the country. From 1915, five such meetings were held at the Imperial Agricultural Research Institute, and these formed the foundation of entomological knowledge in India. He was succeeded in the position of Imperial Entomologist by T. Bainbrigge Fletcher. Maxwell-Lefroy&#x27;s approaches to agricultural pest management was principally aimed at being practical and low-cost, often advocating cultural practices such as the removal and burning of crops material that may harbour pupating pests. He published &quot;Indian Insect Life&quot;, a summary of the major insects of economic importance in 1906, in association with Frank Milburn Howlett. On 10 November 1910 their son Denis Charles died, possibly from typhoid, dysentery or some other fly-borne disease and the other son Cecil was immediately sent away to safety in Darjeeling to be taken care of at the Loreto Convent. The death led to his taking leave and returning to England the next year. His son Cecil was also accompanied by his Indian &quot;ayah&quot; Elizabeth. He took privilege leave from January 1911 for three months and then extended it by going on furlough. Among his last works in India was an analysis of the role of birds in agriculture, written along with supernumerary entomologist Charles W. Mason. The study, begun in 1907, involved analysis of the gut contents of 1325 specimens of birds shot in agricultural fields. He gave lectures in England and he was appointed a lecturer at the Imperial College on 1 September 1911. He applied for resignation from his Indian government posting. He returned to Pusa on 29 July 1912 and an offer was made to retain him but he decided instead to take up a position at the Imperial College as professor of entomology. His resignation was formally accepted on 15 December 1912.

=== England ===
At the Imperial College, Maxwell-Lefroy&#x27;s focus was on applied and economic entomology. Maxwell-Lefroy moved to live initially in Strawberry Hill, and later Acton Lodge in Isleworth close to his workplace in South Kensington. In the early days, he used a motorbike with a sidecar to travel about. In 1913-1914, Lefroy was consulted by Frank Baines, Principal Architect of the Office of Works, to study ways of exterminating death watch beetles that had been found in Westminster Hall, beside England&#x27;s Houses of Parliament. He began to try out various chemicals and finally came up with a 50% dichlorobenzene, 47% mineral oil and 3% barium oleate mixture to brush the wood with. This treatment was used by Baines who was then knighted for saving Westminster Hall. He also designed a field trap for turnip flea beetles (&quot;Phyllotreta consobrina&quot;) which disturbed the beetles and trapped them on sticky surfaces. 

During the First World War, Maxwell-Lefroy volunteered but was rejected on medical grounds from military service. In 1915 he took up a position travelling across India as Imperial silk specialist. Along with E.C. Ansorge, magistrate and collector in Bihar and Orissa; and an amateur entomologist, he wrote a &quot;Report on an Inquiry into the Silk Industry in India&quot; (1917) in three volumes but not without a major interruption. While in Bangalore on the silk study, on 17 April 1916, he received a telegram from the government seeking help on fly control in Mesopotamia. Appointed as an acting Lt-Col, he was sent to assist C.F.C. Beeson and shipped out from Bombay. He published on his investigations into the control of flies and other pests, a note in the &quot;Agricultural Journal of India&quot; included a photograph of his assistants from Pusa. He also introduced a treatment for the control of lice in the trenches called &quot;&quot; that kept away jigger fleas and ticks. It was reported that there was a fall of 66% in cases of dysentery, cholera and typhoid after his measures were put in place. A bout of beri-beri invalided him and he returned to India, recovered and then travelled to England. Shortly after, there was a problem with weevils infesting wheat in Australia which hampered food supplies during the war. In October 1917 he sailed to San Francisco and then to Sydney where he examined the wheat weevil problem along with W.W. Froggatt, the Government entomologist and suggested various measures. He also examined the issue of sheep blowflies &quot;Lucilia sericata&quot; before setting off from Sydney to England in May 1919.

In 1924, Lefroy and his assistant Elizabeth Eades started producing bottles of woodworm treatment fluid from a small factory in Hatton Garden to manage a stream of requests, this led to the formation by them of a company called Rentokil Limited (now Rentokil Initial) in 1925. He registered the company on 29 September 1924, originally under the name of Entokill but this was objected to by the Board of Trade.

Maxwell-Lefroy&#x27;s students included Evelyn Cheesman who took up a position at the insect house in the zoo from 1919. Maxwell-Lefroy had been appointed honorary curator for the insect house. Cheesman and Olive Lodge also attended his classes which otherwise included only male students. He encouraged their studies and when Cheesman set off for South Africa, he emphasized the need for anyone interested in insects to spend time in the tropics to fully appreciate the subject. 

In 1922 he began to collaborate with Bruce Woolf who started a film company called New Era films to produce short documentaries on natural history. He helped in the production of several short films dealing with insects including one on wasps and another on tiger beetles in a series called &quot;Secrets of Nature&quot;.

=== Death ===
Lefroy once became unconscious in March 1925 while experimenting in his laboratory on poison gases to control houseflies. He was administered oxygen for an hour before he became conscious and returned to work in April. He again had a laboratory accident in October 1925 and this time he was found dead on the 15th of October after his wife alarmed at his absence went to the laboratory. It was estimated in the postmortem that he died at 6.35 PM on 14 October 1925. He had been trying out various gases to kill the larvae of houseflies (his biographer, Laurence Fleming, suggests that his hatred for houseflies may have to do with the death of his son. He also notes that Maxwell-Lefroy may have been suffering from cancer and that there had been suggestions that his death could have been a suicide.). His assistants, including Olive Lodge, had no knowledge of the composition of the poison gas. It is thought that he was experimenting with Lewisite. He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. His position at the Imperial College was taken up by Balfour Browne who ensured that the flasks with unknown chemicals that Maxwell-Lefroy was working with were buried.

=== Family ===
Maxwell-Lefroy and Kathleen had three children of whom the first, Gladys Kathleen died in infancy, and the second, Charles died in November 1910 while he was in Pusa and was the cause for his premature exit from India. The only child who survived was Cecil Anthony (d. 1995) who became a general manager of Burmah Oil Company and was later made CBE. He wrote an unfinished memoir on the life of his father which was posthumously edited as a biography published in 2015 by Laurence Fleming. Kathleen died on 4 December 1967.

==Publications==
Maxwell-Lefroy published numerous journal articles and memoirs published by government departments. Some of the major books include:
*Indian Insect Pests (1906) - a Bengali edition was produced with assistance of C.C.Ghosh
* (1907)

<doc id="906370" wikidata="Q7186657" url="?curid=906370" title="Murder of George Campbell">
<text>Phoebe McWain Campbell (c. 1847 – 20 June 1872) was a Canadian woman who was hanged for the murder of her husband.

Campbell had alleged that on the morning of July 15, 1871, in Thorndale, Middlesex County, Ontario, two black-faced men broke into George and Phoebe&#x27;s log cabin home and brutally hacked George to death with an axe because he refused to hand over some money. They had attempted to use a gun which misfired.

During the investigation, six local men were arrested, including Thomas Coyle, who was George&#x27;s farmhand. Doubt about Phoebe&#x27;s innocence arose rapidly as she was seen talking with Coyle; she also seemed to have done nothing to help save her husband as he was being murdered and seemed very unemotional following George&#x27;s funeral. A coroner&#x27;s autopsy showed that George was murdered by Phoebe and Coyle. &quot;I don&#x27;t care. I&#x27;m innocent and I don&#x27;t care&quot;, Phoebe stated. She then accused Coyle of the murder, then quickly changed her mind and accused her cousin.

Phoebe&#x27;s murder trial began on 1 April 1872, with much public interest. Phoebe accused George of having an affair with her cousin&#x27;s wife. During the trial, the crown prosecutor produced a letter which stated, &quot;I never shall say you done any such thing again—if I have to die for it.&quot; When asked why she changed her testimony, she claimed the ghost of her late husband visited her and declared her and Coyle innocent. The crown prosecutor responded, &quot;You can hardly expect anyone to believe such nonsense!&quot;

After the trial, the jury took just one hour to reach a guilty verdict. Phoebe then sobbed as the judge sentenced her to hanging. She later confessed that she and Coyle murdered George so they could marry. Coyle went to trial for his crime but was acquitted. He later moved to England.

She was hanged on 20 June at the age of 25 and was again said to be emotionless as she was about to be hanged, holding a lace handkerchief in her hand until after she died.

The story received so much public attention that postcards depicting the crime were made, which were bought by many.

<text>Dewas is a city in the Malwa region of the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. The municipality was formerly the seat of two 15-Gun Salute state princely states during the British Raj, Dewas Junior state and Dewas Senior state, ruled by the Pawar clan of the Marathas. The city is the administrative capital of Dewas district. Dewas is an industrialised city and houses a government bank note press.

==Etymology==

The name Dewas is derived from the Devi Vaishini hill in the city, commonly known as &quot;Tekri&quot;. The hill has a temple of the deities Devi Tulja Bhawani, Chamunda Mata and Kalika Mata. The word Dewas is believed to be a sandhi of the words Dev (deity) and Vas (abode in Marathi), so Dewas means &quot;house of the god&quot;. Swami Shivom Tirtha wrote the history of the hill (&quot;Tekri&quot; ) of Dewas in his book, &quot;Sadhan Shikhar&quot;. Inspired by the area, E.M. Forster wrote &quot;The Hill of Devi&quot; in 1953.

The district takes its name from its headquarters town, Dewas, which is said to be derived from the legend that Dewas rests at the foot of a 300-foot (91 m) conical hill known as Chamunda hill on whose summit is the shrine of Goddess Chamunda. The image of the goddess is cut into the wall of a cave, known as Devi Vashini or the goddess&#x27;s residence. From this, the name Dewas (&quot;dev&quot;-&quot;vas&quot;) seems to have been derived.

== History ==
Dewas was formerly the capital of two princely states of British India. The original state was founded in the first half of the 18th century by the brothers Tukaji Rao (Senior) and Jivaji Rao (Junior), from the Pawar clan of the Marathas. They had advanced into Malwa with the Maratha Peshwa, Baji Rao, in 1728. The brothers divided the territory among themselves; their descendants ruled as the senior and junior branches of the family. After 1841, each branch ruled its own portion as a separate state, though the lands belonging to each were intimately entangled; in Dewas, the capital town, the two sides of the main street were under different administrations and had different arrangements water supply and lighting.

The senior branch had an area of and a population of in 62,312 in 1901, while the area of the junior branch was and had a population of 54,904 that same year. Both Dewas states were in the Malwa Agency of the Central India Agency.

<text>The Emperor&#x27;s Shadow is a 1996 Chinese historical film directed by Zhou Xiaowen and starring Jiang Wen, Ge You, Xu Qing and Ge Zhijun. It was the most expensive Chinese film produced at the time of its release.

==Plot==
Set in third century BC China, the story of &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s Shadow&quot; revolves around the relationship between Ying Zheng, the King of Qin, and later the First Emperor; and the musician Gao Jianli. Gao Jianli&#x27;s mother was the king&#x27;s wet nurse when the young king was a hostage in the Zhao state, but they were separated after the former returns to Qin to become king.

After reaching adulthood, Ying Zheng embarks on a series of wars to fulfill his plan of unifying China. He kidnaps Gao Jianli from the Yan state to compose a powerful anthem for his new state. The two conflict over the new composition, the construction of grand public works, Ying Zheng&#x27;s ruthless mass killing policies, and Ying Zheng&#x27;s daughter, Princess Yueyang.

==Cast==
*Jiang Wen as Ying Zheng
**Tian Ming as young Ying Zheng
*Ge You as Gao Jianli
**Wang Peng as young Gao Jianli
*Xu Qing as Princess Yueyang
*Ge Zhijun as Zhao Gao
*Wang Qingxiang as Li Si
*Di Guoqiang as Wang Jian
*Wang Ning as Wang Ben
*Shu Yaoxuan as Xu Fu
*Li Mengnan as Jing Ke
*Yuan Yuan as Fan Yuqi
*Ren He as Huhai
*Zhao Yi
*Wang Hong
*Sun Bicheng
*Zhang Chunyuan

==Music and themes==
The political use of music and of the arts in general is one of the major themes in the film. In one of the climaxes of the film, the king states his belief that through music he can &quot;control the minds and hearts of the people&quot;, echoing Mao Zedong&#x27;s Yan&#x27;an talks of 1942. Music is perceived by the monarch as being as important as military power. Whereas his armies can conquer his rivals, he needs the arts to exert spiritual and ideological control. At the premiere of the film on 7 June 1996 in Beijing, director Zhou Xiaowen noted: &quot;Chinese rulers have always wanted to control our spirit. But they cannot succeed in doing so.&quot;

==Reception==
After &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s Shadow&quot; was released in five major Chinese cities, it was banned by state authorities without any clear reason being given. Eight months later permission was given for re-release.

The film has been criticized in China for its many historical inaccuracies. Chief among these is the distortion of the character of Gao Jianli. According to Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, Gao Jianli was a friend of the assassin Jing Ke, who fails in an attempt upon Ying Zheng&#x27;s life. Other minor errors, mostly of academic interest, also contribute to the film&#x27;s lack of historical authenticity. The director Zhou Xiaowen defended his film by saying that it was an exploration of ideas and values for the present day and was not intended as a strictly historical depiction of the First Emperor. In a 1999 interview, he said &quot;I don&#x27;t like history; I just like the buildings, the palaces, the dress.&quot;

The film influenced the creation of Tan Dun&#x27;s 2006 opera &quot;The First Emperor&quot;.

In a 1997 review by Joan Lau of the Malaysian newspaper &quot;New Straits Times&quot;, she wrote that &quot;As for you, never mind if you don&#x27;t know Seamus Heaney from Enid Blyton, go catch &quot;Emperor&#x27;s Shadow&quot;, you won&#x27;t regret it&quot;.

<text>The men&#x27;s 50 metre freestyle event at the 2004 Summer Olympics was contested at the Olympic Aquatic Centre of the Athens Olympic Sports Complex in Athens, Greece on August 19 and 20.

United States&#x27; Gary Hall Jr. defended his Olympic title in the event in 21.93, just two hundredths of a second off the record set by Alexander Popov in 1992. The silver medal was awarded to Croatia&#x27;s Duje Draganja, who placed behind Hall in 21.94. South Africa&#x27;s Roland Mark Schoeman completed his full set of medals by adding a bronze in 22.02.

Defending bronze medalist Pieter van den Hoogenband of the Netherlands (22.56), and dual Olympic champion Alexander Popov of Russia (22.58) missed the semifinals. By the following year, Popov announced his retirement from swimming, and became a full-time member of the International Olympic Committee.

<text>The Conference of Lausanne was a conference held in Lausanne, Switzerland, during 1922 and 1923. Its purpose was the negotiation of a treaty to replace the Treaty of Sèvres, which, under the new government of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, was no longer recognized by Turkey.

The conference opened in November 1922, with representatives from Great Britain, France, Italy and Turkey. The Grand National Assembly of Turkey selected İsmet İnönü, Rıza Nur and Chief Rabbi Chaim Nahum as their representatives. Lord Curzon, the British Foreign Secretary, was the co-ordinator of the conference, which he dominated. France and Italy had assumed that the Chanak Crisis had caused British prestige with Turkey to be irrevocably damaged, but they were shocked to discover that Turkish respect for Britain was undiminished. British troops had held their positions at Chanak, but the French had been ordered to withdraw.

The conference lasted for eleven weeks. It heard speeches from Benito Mussolini of Italy and Raymond Poincaré of France. The proceedings of the conference were notable for the stubborn diplomacy of İsmet Pasha. Already partially deaf, he would simply turn off his hearing aid when Curzon launched into lengthy speeches denouncing the Turkish position. Once Curzon was finished, İsmet Pasha would restate his original demands and be oblivious to Curzon&#x27;s denunciations.

At the conclusion, Turkey assented to the political clauses and the &quot;freedom of the straits&quot;, Britain&#x27;s main concern. The matter of the status of Mosul was deferred since Curzon refused to be budged from the British position that the area was part of Iraq. The French delegation, however, did not achieve any of its goals. On 30 January 1923, it issued a statement that it did not consider the draft treaty to be any more than a basis of discussion. The Turks, therefore, refused to sign the treaty. On 4 February 1923, Curzon made a final appeal to İsmet Pasha to sign, and when he refused, Curzon broke off negotiations and left that night on the &quot;Orient Express&quot;.

The Treaty of Lausanne was finally signed on 24 July 1923.

==Background==

The harsh Treaty of Sèvres imposed upon the government of the Ottoman Empire after World War I by the Allied Powers included provisions that demanded the partition of Anatolia. The treaty demanded the occupation of French and Italian zones of occupation in the southeast and southwest, the cession of much of western Anatolia to Greece and the establishment of two independent states: Armenia and Kurdistan in the east and the southwest. The Ottoman state was to have a small army and navy without heavy artillery, aeroplanes or battleships, and its budget was to be placed under the supervisions of an Allied financial commission. Turkish nationalists were vehemently opposed to those clauses and decided to fight to inhibit their effectiveness.

In the Turkish War of Independence that followed, the Turkish Nationalist Army defeated the Greeks and created resolutions with the French and Italians to secure a sovereign, independent Turkish state in Anatolia.

==Preliminary meetings==
The location of Lausanne, Switzerland, was chosen as a neutral venue by Britain, France and Italy to discuss their new policies in the Near East. Representatives of the Soviet Union would be invited solely to renegotiate the Straits Convention. Before the conference even began, Lord Curzon of Britain expressed doubts upon the reliability of France and Italy for support and stated, &quot;I am not going into the conference in order to find myself let down very likely on the first day by the French or Italians&quot;. He demanded a preliminary meeting of the three nations to reach a preliminary strategy before he travelled to Lausanne. Curzon prepared a list of British demands separated into two categories. Essential ones included the Greek retention of Western Thrace, the freedom of the Straits to shipping, demilitarised zones on the coasts and the retention of Allied troops in Istanbul until a new treaty was ratified. Most desirable ones included measures for the protection of the minorities in Turkey, preliminary safeguards of the Armenian population, the satisfaction of Allied requirements of the Ottoman debt, capitulations and the future financial and economic regime in Turkey.

Preliminary meetings, taking place in Paris between Curzon and French Prime Minister Raymond Poincaré on 18 November 1922, lasted five hours. Poincaré addressed each of Lord Curzon&#x27;s aims point by point and reluctantly agreed to most of them. Both then met with Benito Mussolini who quickly agreed to the agenda because of his overall indifference to the negotiations.

The first official meeting of the Lausanne Conference was held on 21 November 1922, and Curzon appointed himself president of the conference and instituted three subcommissions. The first and arguably most important one addressed territorial and military questions, the second one addressed the financial and economic questions and the third was meant to answer the future of judicial status of foreigners in Turkey. The first was chaired by Lord Curzon, the second by French Ambassador Camille Barrère and the third by the Italian diplomat Marquis Garone.

On 23 November, Curzon&#x27;s commission began its processions. İsmet Pasha delivered a long speech in which he demanded the cession of Karaagac, a suburb of Edirne, which had been retained by Greece as part of Western Thrace. Curzon responded by chastising the Turks for making what he considered to be excessive demands. He was met with widespread support by the French and Italians and went on to state that the &quot;exhibition of so firm an Allied front at this stage and on so important an issue took [the] Turks very much by surprise and will probably exercise a decisive influence in our future proceedings&quot;. That feeling did not last, however, since by December, Turkish obstruction and stubbornness and Italian concessions had all but halted negotiations.

The Soviet delegation arrived in Lausanne on 28 November 1922 with Georgy Vasilyevich Chicherin as its chief spokesman. It demanded to be admitted to the conference as a whole, and when the Straits Commission officially met on 5 December, it also demanded the closure of the Straits, both in peace and war, to warships and aircraft of all nations except Turkey. Both proposals were rejected, and any Soviet protest was ignored. Soviet envoy Vatslav Vorovsky was granted entry as an observer to the orient conference, but not as an official delegate, and the Soviets were not granted diplomatic protections by the Swiss government.

On 16 December, Curzon decided that he would remain at the conference over the Christmas holiday to expedite the conference&#x27;s conclusion. He intended to draw up a preliminary treaty containing the points already agreed to in the meetings with the Turks and then he would invite İsmet Pasha to accept or reject it as a statement of agreed principle. Curzon would let experts fill in the rest. After Christmas, however, the increasing Turkish inflexibility on generally all significant clauses and rumors of an imminent Turkish military advance on Istanbul led Curzon to seek a private meeting with İsmet. Curzon found the Turkish foreign minister &quot;impervious to argument, warning or appeal, and can only go on repeating the same catchwords, indulging in the same futil quibbles, and making the same childish complaints&quot;.

Curzon&#x27;s intention of presenting the Turks with a preliminary treaty was further hindered by a lack of correspondence from Poincaré in regards to the acceptability of the conditions presented to France. In mid-January 1923, Maurice Bompard, who had taken the place of the sickly Barrere as chief French delegate, visited Paris to relay with Poincaré and returned to the Conference with a document of 24 headings dictated by Poincaré that represented a French demand for substantial concessions to Turkey on most issues to bring about a faster conclusion. Curzon described an &quot;unconditional surrender to the Turks&quot;, adamantly refused to accept any of the &quot;eleventh hour proposals&quot; and went on to decide on a fixed date for the departure of the British delegation from the conference. On that day, he explained, the Turks would be asked to accept or to reject the text of the treaty that Britain was drawing up without including any of Poincaré&#x27;s amendments.

When the draft was presented to the Turks on 31 January, İsmet asked for an adjournment of eight days. There were further meetings of the Allied delegations on the morning of 2 February during which Curzon reluctantly agreed to further modifications on capitulations and the tariffs, the abandonment of reparations due from Turkey and the removal of all restrictions on the size of the Turkish Army in Thrace. On 4 February, the Turks accepted all territorial terms of the draft treaty with a reservation about Mosul, but they rejected the judicial, economic and financial clauses and demanded reparations from Greece for the damage its army caused in İzmir, a demand that Curzon had already rejected because of the poverty of Greece. Although the Allies agreed to further slight changes in the economic clauses, the Turks still refused to sign the treaty on the grounds that the economic and the judicial clauses were still unsatisfactory.

It was then reported that for the next several hours, İsmet Pasha feigned total ineptitude in the understanding of the simplest of propositions. The ploy of stubbornness aimed to force another revision of the treaty. Every warning, argument or plea to İsmet lacked even the smallest effect. Then, negotiations broke down, and all parties returned to their respective capitals.

==Resolution==
In early March 1923, a Turkish note suggested new propositions towards the still-unsettled financial, economic and judicial questions. Curzon accepted the Turkish proposals on the basis that the conference would be revived, but he ruled out any further revisions of the territorial clauses already resolved. Between 21 and 27 March 1923, British, French, Italian and Japanese experts met in London to discuss Allied criteria for the settlement of the still-unresolved issues of the conference.

The conference eventually reopened at Lausanne on 23 April 1923. Once again three commissions were set up. The first dealt with the remaining territorial questions and the rights of foreigners and was chaired by Sir Horace Rumbold, the primary British delegate, since Curzon refused to return to Lausanne. The second was under General Maurice Pellé, now the main French delegate, and dealt with financial questions. The third was under , the chief Italian delegate, and dealt with economic questions. Most of the proceedings were of a highly-technical nature and progressed slowly. France renewed its demand for the payment of reparations to the Allies by Turkey although, as Curzon pointed out, the Allies had agreed to abandon them in February.

No agreement be reached with Turks on the future judicial regime for foreigners in their country. Finally, the Turkish insistence for the Greeks to pay reparations to Turkey for war damage in İzmir almost led to a renewal of Turkish-Greek hostilities. On 24 April, the Greek delegation threatened to walk out of the conference on Saturday, the 26th, if the Turks did not accept the Greek offer of Karaağaç to replace reparations. Mustafa Kemal intervened, and his government agreed that İsmet could accept Karaagaç instead of reparations if it was coupled with a favourable settlement of the remaining questions. On the afternoon of the 26th, after appeals from all the delegates at the conference, İsmet accepted the compromise, which was coupled with rather-vague assurances by the Allies that every effort would be made to satisfy Turkish requirements on other issues.

However, after a further appeal to Poincaré by Crewe on 6 July, the former accepted a British proposal that a declaration about the debt interest should be omitted from the treaty, and the matter should be dealt with by a separate note from the Allies to Turkey. After a six-hour meeting on the subject between the Allied and the Turkish delegates, the issue was finally settled. At 1.30 a.m. on 9 July 1923, agreement was reached on the debt&#x27;s interest, on concessions and on the evaluation of the Allies from Constantinople after Turkey had ratified the peace treaty.

However, there were still delays over the settlement of other minor issues, and it was only on 24 July 1923 that the treaty was signed at a plenary session of the conference.

Meanwhile, on 10 May 1923 Vorovsky was shot dead and two other Soviet envoys were wounded in a busy restaurant by Maurice Conradi, a Russian expat. The trial, with unapologetic defendants who disputed few facts, quickly became a moral indictment of the Bolshevik government itself, and was an international sensation. Conradi&#x27;s acquittal severed formal Swiss-Russian relations until 1946.

==Treaty of Lausanne==
It was known from early on in the conference that Turkey was left in a perilous position since much of it had been destroyed in the War of Independence. The Turks needed an end to conflict and normal relations with Europe to build and sustain their economy. Though İsmet Pasha, was extremely stubborn and near unworkable during the conference, he acted so mainly in matters that threatened Turkish independence. On matters that did not touch the heart of Turkish independence, İsmet eventually accepted Allied wishes to secure Turkey&#x27;s place in the future economy. He easily accepted British and French colonial rule in Palestine, Syria and Iraq. Although İsmet would surely have loved to negate the old Ottoman debt, a great weight on the new state, he accepted a proportional division of the debt among the successor states of the empire.

On matters on independence, the Turks were resolute in their stance. The capitulations and the rules that had allowed foreigners to have their own legal systems in the Ottoman Empire, their own post offices and other extraterritorial rights were ended. Foreigners and minorities were to be governed by the same sets of laws and to have the same rights as Turks. Social and religious institutions of Christians were specifically allowed but not separate political institutions.

Furthermore, the treaty attempted to rectify the expulsion of entire populations in the Balkans by a population exchange. Greeks had lived in Anatolia for thousands of years, and the Turks had lived in what is now Greece for more than 500 years, but both Greece and Turkey had come to realise that the two populations could no longer live together in co-operation. The viciousness of the Balkan Wars essentially destroyed the tolerance between the cultures. Most of the Turks of Greece, in fact, had been expelled after 1878, especially in the Balkan Wars. Most Anatolian Greeks had fled in 1922. At Lausanne, Greece and Turkey agreed to relocate most of the Muslims and Greeks who had remained in the other&#x27;s country. Only the Greeks of Istanbul and the Turks of western Thrace were excluded.

===Mosul question===
On 4 February 1923, while the Lausanne Conference was still in session, both obstinate parties laying claim to the Mosul region, Turkey and Britain, deferred the dispute from the conference&#x27;s agenda since its deadlock was so firm. Since the First World War, the British had sought to contain the Bolshevik threat by expanding their presence in the Middle Eastern regions around Iraq, Iran, and Turkey. Turkey however remained adamant that the region was owed to them based on the racial unity of the Turks and the Kurds, arguments that most of the disputed area&#x27;s trade was with Anatolia, the illegal occupation of the Allies in Mosul and the presence of self-determination from which the inhabitants actually wanted to be a part of Turkey. Lord Curzon, however, addressed each of these claims individually claiming that most majority of the inhabitants were racially Kurds who were of Indo-European origin and fundamentally different from the Turks, most of the trade of Mosul was with Iraq but not Anatolia, the British government had been legally entrusted with the mandate over Iraq by the League of Nations and the frequent Kurdish revolts during the nineteenth century immediately before the war demonstrated that the Kurds were unwilling to be a part of Turkey. Britain eventually brought the dispute before the League of Nations, which ruled that neither party had any right to occupy and control the area. The Kurdish population was instead divided between Turkey, Syria and Iraq, which ended any aspirations the Kurds had for self-determination.

In return for Turkey&#x27;s concession, it was then afforded an invitation to join the League of Nations to complete the isolation of Bolshevik Russia.

===Straits question===
The Straits question of the conference further emphasised the prevailing paranoia of the encroaching Bolsheviks, especially by the Allies. At the end of the war, the victorious powers imposed the terms of the Treaty of Sèvres, which placed the control of the Straits under the Commission of the Straits. The commission would be composed of the representatives of the Great Powers and Greece, Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey. With the recovery of Turkish power in Anatolia, however, the peace treaty became inoperative within two years. The sessions of the conference devoted to the Straits became a duel between Curzon of Britain and Chicherin of Russia, the latter of whom demanded the passage of military vessels through the Straits to be prohibited at all times and the restoration of full Turkish sovereignty over the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles with an unrestricted right to fortify their shores. Eventually, the British prevailed by enacting Article I of the Straits Convention of 24 July 1923, which stated the principle of freedom of transit and of navigation through the Straits during both peace and war. Furthermore, Article IV stipulated that the shores of the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles as well as the contiguous islands in the Aegean and in Marmara would be demilitarised.

==Aftermath==
The Lausanne Conference officially recognized the sovereignty of the new Republic of Turkey internationally. Turkey, in a sense, achieved what the Ottoman Empire had set out to do prior to World War I: receive equal treatment by the Western powers and assert its place in the international political sphere. The treaty restricted the boundaries of Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey and formally relinquished all Turkish claims on the Dodecanese Islands, Cyprus, Egypt and Sudan, Syria and Iraq. In Article 3, Turkey had its southern border also become rigidly defined, and it officially ceded the territories of Yemen, Asir, and parts of Hejaz, including Medina. Turkey also officially ceded Adakale Island in the River Danube to Romania by Articles 25 and 26. According to Article 10, Turkey gave up any of its privileges in Libya. The Armenians also lost hope of reestablishing a large presence in East Anatolia under the treaty and were instead afforded a small homeland in Soviet Armenia, which in 1922 became a part of the Transcaucasian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic.

Aside from the redrawing of geographic borders, Robert Gerwarth stated that the conference sanctioned relocation of ethnic and religious populations had inauspicious consequences and &quot;had a significance that went well beyond the Greek and Turkish context to which it ostensibly applied. The Convention effectively established the legal right of state governments to expel large parts of their citizens on the grounds of &#x27;otherness&#x27;. It fatally undermined cultural, ethnic and religious plurality as an ideal to which to aspire and a reality with which - for all their contestations - most people in the European land empires had dealt with fairly well for centuries&quot;.

<doc id="906403" wikidata="Q410534" url="?curid=906403" title="Miconazole">
<text>Miconazole, sold under the brand name Monistat among others, is an antifungal medication used to treat ring worm, pityriasis versicolor, and yeast infections of the skin or vagina. It is used for ring worm of the body, groin (jock itch), and feet (athlete&#x27;s foot). It is applied to the skin or vagina as a cream or ointment.
Common side effects include itchiness or irritation of the area in which it was applied. Use in pregnancy is believed to be safe for the baby. Miconazole is in the imidazole family of medications. It works by decreasing the ability of fungi to make ergosterol, an important part of their cell membrane.
Miconazole was patented in 1968 and approved for medical use in 1971. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication.

==Medical uses==
Miconazole is used externally for the treatment of ringworm, jock itch, and athlete&#x27;s foot. Internal application is used for oral candidiasis or vaginal thrush (yeast infection).

==Side effects==
Miconazole is generally well tolerated. The oral gel can cause dry mouth, nausea and an unpleasant taste in about 1–10% of people. Anaphylactic reactions are rare. The drug prolongs the QT interval.

== Interactions ==
Miconazole is partly absorbed in the intestinal tract when used orally, as with the oral gel, and possibly when used vaginally. This can lead to increased concentrations of drugs that are metabolized by the liver enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, because miconazole inhibits these enzymes. Such interactions occur for example with anticoagulants of the warfarin type, phenytoin, some newer atypical antipsychotics, ciclosporin, and most statins used to treat hypercholesterolemia. These interactions are not relevant for miconazole that is applied to the skin.

==Contraindications==
Miconazole is contraindicated for people who use certain drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4, for the reasons mentioned above:
* drugs that also prolong the QT interval because of potential problems with the heart rhythm
* ergot alkaloids
* statins
* triazolam and oral midazolam
* sulfonamides with a potential to cause hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar)

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===
Miconazole inhibits the fungal enzyme 14α-sterol demethylase, resulting in a reduced production of ergosterol. In addition to its antifungal actions, miconazole, similarly to ketoconazole, is known to act as an antagonist of the glucocorticoid receptor.

===Pharmacokinetics===
After application to the skin, miconazole can be measured in the skin for up to four days, but less than 1% is absorbed into the bloodstream. When applied to the oral mucosa (and possibly also for vaginal use), it is significantly absorbed. In the bloodstream, 88.2% are bound to plasma proteins and 10.6% to blood cells. The substance is partly metabolized via the liver enzyme CYP3A4 and mainly eliminated via the faeces.

==Chemistry==
The solubilities of miconazole nitrate powder are 0.03% in water, 0.76% in ethanol and up to 4% in acetic acid. Miconazole crystallises as colourless prisms in the monoclinic space group P21/c.

==Other uses==
Miconazole is also used in Ektachrome film developing in the final rinse of the Kodak E-6 process and similar Fuji CR-56 process, replacing formaldehyde. Fuji Hunt also includes miconazole as a final rinse additive in their formulation of the C-41RA rapid access color negative developing process.

==Brands and formulations==
Oral treatment: (brand names Daktarin in UK, Fungimin Oral Gel in Bangladesh):

In 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration approved Oravig (miconazole) buccal tablets for the local treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis, more commonly known as thrush, in adults and children age 16 and older.

External skin treatment (brand names Desenex and Zeasorb in US and Canada, Micatin, Monistat-Derm, Daktarin in India, UK, Australia, Belgium and the Philippines, Daktar in Norway, Fungidal in Bangladesh, Decocort in Malaysia) (Note that Desenex originally contained not miconazole, but rather the fungistatic agents, undecylenic acid and zinc undecylenate, which were in the foot powder developed by the US government for troops during WWII.)

Vaginal treatment (brand names Miconazex, Monistat, Femizol or Gyno-Daktarin in UK):
In Japan, Mochida Healthcare, a subsidiary of Mochida Pharmaceutical, produces a line of body soaps and shampoo under the brand name Collage (コラージュ) that contain miconazole nitrate as their main ingredient.

<text>The University of Texas at Arlington (UTA or UT Arlington) is a public research university in Arlington, Texas, United States. The university was founded in 1895 and was in the Texas A&amp;M University System for several decades until joining the University of Texas System in 1965.

The university is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. The fall 2022 campus enrollment consisted of 40,990 students making it the second largest university in North Texas and fifth-largest in Texas. UT Arlington is the third-largest producer of college graduates in Texas and offers over 180 baccalaureate, masters, and doctoral degree programs.

UT Arlington participates in 15 intercollegiate sports as a Division I member of the NCAA and Western Athletic Conference. UTA sports teams have been known as the Mavericks since 1971.

==History==
===Establishment (1895–1916)===

The university traces its roots back to the opening of Arlington College in September 1895. Arlington College was established as a private school for primary through secondary level students, equivalent to the modern 1st to 10th grades. At the time, the public school system in the city of Arlington was underfunded and understaffed. Local merchant Edward Emmett Rankin organized fellow citizens of the city to donate materials and land to build a schoolhouse where the modern campus is now located.

Rankin also convinced the two co-principals of the public school in Arlington, Lee Morgan Hammond and William Marshall Trimble, to invest in and hold the same positions at Arlington College. In the first few years, between 75 and 150 students were enrolled in the college. The public school began to rent space at Arlington College, and was eventually sold to the city in 1900. The public school building became so unsafe that all of the space in Arlington College was rented for the 1901–1902 school year until the creation of the Arlington Independent School District in 1902. Although the public education system was set to improve, Arlington College was closed and the property was sold to James McCoy Carlisle.
Carlisle was already established as a respected educator in the North Texas region, and he opened the Carlisle Military Academy in the fall of 1902. His program consisted of a balance between course work and military training. Enrollment increased to 150 students by 1905, and he began a large expansion of the campus. Baseball, football, basketball, and track teams were begun between 1904 and 1908. Around the same time, new barracks, a track, a gymnasium, and an indoor pool were built. The academy became known as one of the best at its level in the country. Unfortunately, enrollment did not continue to increase with the expansion in facilities and Carlisle ran into serious financial problems.

Lawsuits for the mortgages on the property were filed in 1911, and Carlisle Military Academy was closed in 1913. In the fall of 1913, Henry Kirby Taylor moved from Missouri, where he was president of the Northwest State Teachers&#x27; College, to set up another military academy called Arlington Training School. He also was required to manage the finances and campus for the property owners. By the 1914–1915 school year, the campus contained 11 buildings on of land with 95 students enrolled. The school was incorporated in 1915 in order to raise funds to make improvements to the existing buildings, but more financial problems arose and another series of lawsuits were filed. Taylor left Arlington, and the property owners hired John B. Dodson to establish a third military academy for the 1916–1917 school year called Arlington Military Academy. Enrollment was apparently very low, and Arlington Military Academy closed after one year.

=== Texas A&amp;M University System (1917–1965) ===
Since the turn of the 20th century, the prospects for turning the campus into a public, junior vocational college had been discussed. By 1917, the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas in College Station was overcrowded and had only one branch campus, Prairie View A&amp;M. Vincent Woodbury Grubb, a lawyer and education advocate, organized Arlington officials to lobby the state legislature to create a new junior college. The Arlington campus was established as a branch of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas and was called Grubbs Vocational College. Students were either enrolled in a high school or junior college program, and all men were required to be cadets. Its name changed again in 1923 to the North Texas Agricultural College (NTAC). Edward Everett Davis replaced Williams as dean in 1925 and held that position for 21 years.

The Great Depression resulted in major cuts to funding and a decline in students, so more general college courses were gradually introduced at NTAC instead of vocational classes. During World War II, the college trained students with a &quot;war program&quot; focus and participated in the V-12 Navy College Training Program, offered at 131 colleges and universities in 1943, which gave students a path to a Navy commission.

Davis was also an enthusiastic support of eugenics and believed in the inherent inferiority of Mexicans and African-Americans in regards to literacy and genetics. He advised the leadership of the A&amp;M system to consolidate the white-only schools, else they would &quot;descend into decadence&quot;. Dean Davis appointed Ernest H. Hereford, then Registrar in 1942, to the position of associate dean in 1943. Following Davis&#x27;s retirement in 1946, Hereford was appointed dean of NTAC.

In 1948, the Texas A&amp;M System was created and Dean Hereford was named the first president of NTAC. The name was changed to Arlington State College (ASC) in 1949 to reflect the fact that agriculture was no longer an important part of the curriculum. Efforts began to turn ASC into a four-year institution, but the Texas A&amp;M system board refused to consider the idea since it was possible that ASC could grow to be larger than College Station. The growth of the city of Arlington in the 1950s led to a major expansion of ASC. The student population increased from 1,322 in 1952 to 6,528 in 1959, which led to land acquisition and construction of many buildings. Jack Woolf was named president in 1959 as serious efforts began to make ASC a four-year college. The Texas legislature approved the four-year status on April 27, 1959. ASC&#x27;s racial segregation would come to an end in the summer of 1962 due to NAACP member and Dallas lawyer Fred Finch, Jr threatening litigation on behalf of his clients Ernest Hooper, Jerry Hanes, and Leaston Chase III. President Woolf and Chancellor of the A&amp;M System Harrington would announce the desegregation of ASC on July 11 of that year, and the following fall semester being the first ever to have black students be enrolled. Enrollment reached 9,116 students in the fall of 1963, a larger total than the Texas A&amp;M College Station campus. Although Texas A&amp;M proposed a reorganization for the system to recognize ASC&#x27;s growth, A&amp;M System President James Earl Rudder resisted developing ASC into a university with graduate programs. Rudder and the Texas A&amp;M board of directors, viewing ASC as a threat to the College Station campus, withheld construction funding and blocked degree development.

===University of Texas System (1965–present)===

The decision by the Texas A&amp;M University governing board to block development at Arlington State College led officials of the college and a number of Arlington citizens to enlist the support of Governor John Connally and key members of the Texas Legislature to separate Arlington State College from the Texas A&amp;M University System and to join The University of Texas System. As part of a plan that reorganized several university systems in Texas, Arlington State College officially became a part of The University of Texas System on September 1, 1965. To reflect its new membership within the UT System, the university adopted its current name in 1967.

Joining the UT System was of immediate consequence. In 1966 the Graduate School was established with an initial slate of six master&#x27;s degrees and new construction projects started.

Controversy erupted in the late 1960s over the use of a rebel theme that was started in 1951, including Confederate symbols and mock-slave auctions as campus traditions. After several years of efforts by President Frank Harrison to give students an opportunity to pick another theme, the UT System abolished rebels. The Maverick theme was adopted after a student vote in 1971.

Wendell Nedderman served as acting president from 1972 to 1974 and president from 1974 to 1992. His tenure was characterized by increased growth and aspirations. In these years, the graduate student population increased from 936 to 4,200 and the overall university enrollment reached 25,135 students. Faculty research and publishing was emphasized along with the addition of doctoral programs in science, engineering, business, social work, and public and urban administration. The Texas Select Committee on Higher Education recognized UT Arlington as an emerging research institution in 1987.

In May 2023, UTA alumnus Kelcy Warren gave the largest single philanthropic investment in UTA&#x27;s history. He donated $12 million to grow the resource and energy engineering programs at UTA.

==Campuses==
===Main Campus surroundings===
The 420 acre main campus is at the southern edge of downtown Arlington, which also includes the largest branch of the public library, City Hall, Theatre Arlington, Levitt Pavilion, Arlington Museum of Art, churches, and numerous types of businesses just south of the Texas and Pacific Railway line, around which the city was established.

The Barnett Shale formation sits below the campus and has earned the university millions of dollars from natural gas production since 2008. These funds are used for scholarships, faculty recruitment, and campus infrastructure upgrades.

Trading House Creek, a tributary of the Trinity River, runs along the southern portion of the campus. Cooper Street (which forms a part of Farm to Market Road 157) runs through the campus and provides access to Interstate 20 and Interstate 30. AT&amp;T Stadium, Globe Life Park in Arlington, Globe Life Field, Six Flags Over Texas, and the International Bowling Museum are two miles to the northeast.

===Main Campus architecture===

The campus is organized on the city&#x27;s former street grid. The topography generally slopes to the south and east to landscaped creeks. The oldest buildings on campus, Ransom Hall, Preston Hall, and College Hall are on the Second Street Mall and date to 1919. The architecture of these pre-World War II buildings is traditional. Later buildings from the 1960s, &#x27;70s, and &#x27;80s are typical of much campus construction of the period: modern, functional, and not especially noteworthy. An exception is the Architecture Building (designed by the respected Dallas firm, Pratt, Box, and Henderson) which forms an intimate and visit-worthy courtyard; Pickard Hall, the Mathematics and Nursing Building, is noted for its unusual triangular shape. Texas Hall (George Dahl, architect) is a contributing building with its front portico, and Nedderman Hall is a contributing structure with its large atrium. An admirable feature of the campus is the aesthetic consistency of limestone and UTA-blend brick. Metal panels have appeared in construction since the late 1990s.

Recently as part of U.T.A.&#x27;s Land Acknowledgement announcement recognizing it is built on lands associated with the Caddo and Wichita people a section of the campus in front of the old planetarium was reconstructed to become a &#x27;Land Acknowledgement Park.&#x27;

The Central Library, designed by George Dahl, forms one side of a Library Quad which may be regarded as the heart of campus. Attention to building design and the creation of outdoor spaces is evident with the postmodern additions of the Chemistry &amp; Physics Building (Perkins + Will), Maverick Activities Center (Hughes Group with Page), Engineering Research Building (ZGF Architects with Page), College Park Center (HKS, Inc.), Science &amp; Engineering Innovation &amp; Research Building (ZGF with Page), Trinity Hall (Beck Group), and Nursing and Social Work (Smith Group). The Chemistry &amp; Physics Building contains one of the largest and most advanced planetariums in the state.
The north and east sides of campus have defined edges, being bounded by UTA Boulevard and Center Street, respectively. The south and west sides tend to blend more irregularly into the city. Cooper Street is a major artery that runs through campus and is partially depressed and spanned by three pedestrian bridges. Academic buildings erected over recent decades are on the east side of Cooper Street (defined by signage as &quot;east campus&quot;).

Surface parking is pushed to the outer edges of campus, particularly south of the academic core, resulting in students getting more exercise than they may want during peak periods. The West Campus Parking Garage and the College Park parking garages on the northwest and northeast campus corners, respectively, provide some relief and advance the master plan goal of reducing surface parking. Green spaces, or outdoor rooms, have increased in the 2000s most notably with the creation of the Greene Research Quad, the Green at College Park, a sunken courtyard at University Administration Building, Brazos Park, and the Davis Street west campus edge. Located in various regions of campus are fiberglass horse statues with uniquely colored blue and orange patterns called &quot;Spirit Horses.&quot;

The College Park District was completed in 2012 and significantly expanded the campus eastward. The district has an arena with seating for 7,000 spectators, dormitory, student apartments, retail space, an 1,800-car parking garage, a welcome center, a credit union, and a 5-acre park called The Green at College Park.

The on-campus resident population is over 5,000, creating a lively 24/7 environment. Large numbers of students live in Arlington Hall, Kalpana Chawla Hall, Vandergriff Hall, West Hall, and numerous on-campus apartments.

Shown below are: Nedderman Hall, Engineering Research Building, Arlington Hall, CAPPA Building, Texas Hall, Jack Woolf Hall, The Commons, and College of Business.

=== Fort Worth Campus ===
In 2007, UTA opened the historic and renovated Santa Fe Freight building in downtown Fort Worth for educational purposes. Initially, UTA offered only Masters of Business Administration classes but later expanded to offering more classes for several degree programs on the graduate and undergraduate levels. The Fort Worth campus has over 25,000 square feet of classrooms, services, and amenity space.

=== West Campus ===
On August 5, 2024, UTA announced a planned expansion to a 51 acre property in west Fort Worth within the Walsh Ranch development in Parker County. The new UTA West campus is expected to welcome students in fall 2028 with plans to eventually serve more than 10,000 students.

==Student life==

===Student profile===

The &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; consistently ranked UT Arlington in the top 10 in the nation for achieving the most ethnically diverse undergraduate student body. Females account for about 55% of the total population. The top four countries of origin for international students are India, China, Taiwan, and Nigeria.

===Residential life===
The campus has four residence halls with a total capacity of at least 5,600 students. The university also has 18 on-campus apartment complexes and a limited number of houses for students with dependent children.
The four halls are Arlington Hall, Kalpana Chawla Hall (KC Hall), Vandergriff Hall at College Park, and West Hall.

===Traditions===

*Bed Races: Since 1980, hundreds of students have gathered to watch teams consisting of four pushers and a rider race against each other in a race just over the length of a football field. Teams consist of student organizations, Greek organizations, and residence halls from around UT Arlington.
*Homecoming: Paired with the beginning of basketball season in the fall, UT Arlington Homecoming features numerous diverse activities. These include alumni events, The Bash, Boom at Noon firing of the Carlisle Cannons, the Parade, fireworks display, pep rally, and homecoming game match-ups.
*Mav Swap: This annual tradition encourages students to trade apparel from their high school or another college for free UT Arlington gear.
*International Week: &quot;I-Week&quot; is hosted by the International Student Organization, and branches out throughout the UT Arlington community in its entirety, celebrating diversity between cultures on campus. I-week typically includes a Food Fair, Fashion Show, Global Extravaganza, Exhibits, and more.
*MavsMeet Convocation: MavsMeet, the New Student Convocation, is a formal assembly commemorating the beginning of the academic year. Students, faculty and staff are welcomed by the university president, provost, student congress president, and a distinguished UT Arlington faculty speaker. This major academic event honors all undergraduate and graduate students, but particularly new UT Arlington students. Immediately following the New Student Convocation, the MavsMeet AfterParty kicks off the year with live music acts, free food, games and activities.
*Oozeball: An annual event hosted by the Student Alumni Association and Campus Recreation to raise money for the Student Alumni Association Sophomore Scholarship. Once the amount for the scholarship is reached, all excess funds are donated to charity. In Oozeball, students play volleyball in artificial mud pits. Since its creation in 1989 in the Greek Life community, Oozeball has become one of the most popular student traditions.
*Rubbing Hereford&#x27;s Head: Ernest H. Hereford was president of NTAC/ASC from 1946 until his death in late November 1958. His sculpted bust sits on a pedestal in the University Center, ever since it debuted in February 1959. Superstition holds that rubbing Hereford&#x27;s head gives good luck on exams. The bust, and name of the University Center, have come under recent controversy regarding allegations of Hereford&#x27;s administration being racist.
*UT Arlington Marching Band: Known as &quot;The Ambassadors of the University,&quot; the UT Arlington Marching Band is one of the few college marching bands in the nation to exist without a football team. The band performs annually for crowds numbering 100,000 and is featured in exhibition performances at state and local contests, such as Bands of America and Regional UIL, as well as festivals and high school and professional football games. In 2001, the band performed in exhibition at the Bands of America Grand Nationals Championship, held in Indianapolis, Indiana. The 175 student musicians in the band represent almost all academic disciplines and majors within the university.

===Greek life===
The fraternity and sorority community at UT Arlington consists of dozens of national and local groups with four governing councils. Traditionally, between five and ten percent of undergraduate students participate within the councils. In 2019, national news services reported that Greek life at Arlington was suspended due to allegations of rape, alcohol abuse, and hazing.

==Athletics==


UT Arlington&#x27;s athletic teams are known as the Mavericks (the selection was made in 1971 and predated the Dallas Mavericks&#x27; choice in 1980). UT Arlington was a charter member of the Southland Conference. UT Arlington won the Southland Conference&#x27;s Commissioners Cup three times since the award was first instituted in 1998. The Commissioners Cup is awarded to the athletics program with the highest all-around performance in all conference events, including all men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s events.

UT Arlington&#x27;s basketball and volleyball teams play at College Park Center, which opened with a women/men basketball double header on February 1, 2012. The new arena seats about 7,000.

UT Arlington became a member of the Western Athletic Conference on July 1, 2012. After a single season in the WAC, the Mavericks joined the Sun Belt Conference on July 1, 2013. The switch came after continued shakeups in college conference membership.

A later phase of conference realignment in the early 2020s saw the Sun Belt Conference announce the pending addition of four new football members, bringing that conference&#x27;s football membership to 14. Shortly after this expansion was announced, UTA announced that it would rejoin the WAC in July 2022.

===Varsity sports===

UT Arlington fields teams or competitors in 15 NCAA Division I events, including baseball, basketball (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), tennis, golf, softball, track, cross country and women&#x27;s volleyball.

Volleyball achieved the greatest team success in the history of the university by advancing to the 1989 NCAA Volleyball Final Four. The women&#x27;s basketball team played in the 2005, 2007 and 2022 NCAA tournaments; the men&#x27;s basketball team made its first appearance in the 2008 NCAA tournament, losing in the first round against No. 1 seed Memphis, who was later forced to vacate this and all other wins from the 2007–2008 season. The men&#x27;s basketball team earned a berth the National Invitation Tournament for the third time during the 2016–2017 season, advancing to the quarter finals. The quarter-final run included a win at BYU and two home games at College Park Center in front of large crowds (need citation). In 2011–2012, the men&#x27;s team advanced to the National Invitation Tournament, falling to the Washington Huskies on their home court in a highly competitive game in the opening round.

UT Arlington fielded a football team, playing out of Maverick Stadium, until it was discontinued after the 1985 season. The university administration noted major financial losses of about $1 million per year and low average attendance (5,600, the student body at the time was 23,100). The program was funded by the university&#x27;s auxiliary enterprise income while the other 14 sports were under-funded, as football accounted for half the total athletic budget. Discussions take place periodically about restarting football but have not gained traction as an institutional priority.

===UTA Cheer===
UTA&#x27;s small coed cheerleading team has become a perennial power in Division I competitive cheerleading. The team has been crowned National Cheerleaders Association Collegiate National Champions in 2010, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018.

===Sports rivalries===

UTA maintains a relatively heated non-conference rivalry with the University of North Texas Mean Green. Periodic sporting events between the two are among the best attended for each team. The longest standing sport rivalry is in men&#x27;s basketball, which began in 1925.
One of UTA&#x27;s most anticipated baseball rivalries is with the TCU Horned Frogs. The two Tarrant County teams play annually in games that generate high attendance from both universities. 4,015 people saw the UTA/TCU match-up at Globe Life Park in Arlington in 2013. Five of the top nine most attended games at Clay Gould Ballpark feature TCU as the visiting team.
During UTA&#x27;s nine years in the Sun Belt, the WAC experienced major membership turnover; when the Mavericks returned in 2022, the only WAC members who were in the league during their one season in that league was New Mexico State, which left for Conference USA in 2023, and Seattle. UTA joined five other Texas schools in the conference—Abilene Christian, Sam Houston, Stephen F. Austin, Tarleton, and UTRGV, though Sam Houston left the WAC for Conference USA in 2023.

<doc id="906412" wikidata="Q5365900" url="?curid=906412" title="Ellis Henican">
<text>Ellis Henican (born October 9, 1958) is an American columnist at &quot;Newsday&quot; and AM New York as well as a political analyst on the Fox News Channel. He hosts a nationally syndicated weekend show on Talk Radio Network and is the voice of &quot;Stormy&quot; on the Cartoon Network series &quot;Sealab 2021&quot;. He is the co-author of the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller &quot;The Party&#x27;s Over: How the Extreme Right Hijacked the GOP and I Became a Democrat&quot;.

==Biography==
Henican earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science from Hampshire College. He has a master&#x27;s degree from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, where he won the top student prize, the Pulitzer Traveling Fellowship. He began his career as a reporter at &quot;The Kentucky Post&quot; and the &quot;Albany (New York) Knickerbockers News&quot;.

Henican wrote &quot;Newsday&quot;″s subway column. In 1992, he was part of the &quot;Newsday&quot; staff when they received a Pulitzer Prize for spot reporting for their coverage of the 14th Street – Union Square (New York City Subway) train wreck.

In recent years, Henican has built a strong presence on television and radio, appearing on most of the major broadcast and cable networks. He has appeared on Fox News Channel, since 1999, where he has made appearances on &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;, &quot;Fox News Watch&quot;, &quot;Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld&quot; and other programs. He was also involved in coverage of the 2008 presidential campaign, the War in Iraq, and other major stories. Henican&#x27;s early television experience included co-hosting a weekly transit program on NY1, New York&#x27;s all-news channel. His weekly &quot;Culture Clash&quot; segments—an irreverent look at television, movies and pop-culture trends – were a popular daytime feature on the USA Network.

Henican&#x27;s weekend radio program, &quot;The Ellis Henican Show&quot;, is syndicated to stations across the country by Talk Radio Network. Henican has also guest-hosted for Alan Colmes, Michael Savage, Bob Grant and Jerry Doyle. He also co-hosts &quot;Henican &amp; White&quot; on WOR in New York, and has a news-driven weekend show on WBBR.

In 2010, Henican authored &quot;Home Team&quot; with New Orleans Saints coach Sean Payton. It was a &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller recounting the story of post-Katrina New Orleans and the Saints&#x27; Super Bowl championship that year. In 2011, to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the death of NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt, Henican wrote another bestseller, &quot;In the Blink of An Eye: Dale, Daytona, and the Day that Changed Everything&quot; with driver Michael Waltrip. Henican has ghost-written two books for Simon &amp; Schuster—an inside account of the nation&#x27;s largest drug-treatment program and a best-selling motivational business book.

His articles have been published in various national magazines, including &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; and &quot;Penthouse&quot;.

Henican also provided the voice for Derek &quot;Stormy&quot; Waters on the popular Cartoon Network series, &quot;Sealab 2021&quot;. A special feature called &quot;Stormy Waters, Pundit&quot; on the &quot;Sealab 2021&quot; Season 3 DVD animates Henican&#x27;s political commentary with visuals of Stormy Waters in and around Sealab. Henican also lent his voice to pundit Harper Ellis on &quot;Frisky Dingo&quot;, which was made by the creators of &quot;Sealab 2021&quot;.

In 2024, Ellis Henican co-wrote &quot;In the Shadows: True Stories of High-Stakes Negotiations to Free Americans Captured Abroad&quot; with Mickey Bergman. The memoir details Bergman&#x27;s role in high-stakes hostage negotiations, providing an insider&#x27;s perspective on the efforts to secure the release of Americans held captive overseas.

Henican lives in the Tribeca area of downtown New York City.

He is remembered for his roles as Dr. Bombay in the comedy fantasy series &quot;Bewitched&quot; (1964–1972) of which he was the last surviving adult cast member, Colonel Crittendon in the comedy series &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; (1965–1971), Malcolm Merriweather in &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; (1963–1965), Colonel Redford in &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot; (1975), Max in &quot;Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo&quot; (1977), and Archibald Gracie IV in the film &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997).

==Early life==
Fox was a fifth-generation performer. He was born in Port Talbot, Glamorgan, the son of Queenie (née Barrett) and Gerald Lawson, both stage actors. He had an older sister, Mavis, and his uncle was British actor Wilfrid Lawson.

==Career==

===Film===
Fox began his film career at the age of 18 months, and by age 14 was an apprentice assistant manager of a theatre. After serving with the Royal Navy in World War II and the Korean War, he resumed his acting career and appeared in over 30 cinema films from 1956 to 2004, including two cinematic dramatizations of the sinking of the doomed passenger liner the RMS &quot;Titanic,&quot; separated by 39 years, viz, &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997) (as Colonel Archibald Gracie IV) and an earlier version of the tragedy &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; (1958) uncredited as lookout in the Crow&#x27;s Nest Frederick Fleet, appearing very briefly in the film but the memorable line, &quot;Iceberg, dead ahead sir!&quot; as a lookout stationed in the ship&#x27;s crow&#x27;s nest. His other screen roles ranged from supporting parts in broad comedies (&quot;Yellowbeard&quot;, &quot;Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo&quot;, and &quot;The Private Eyes&quot;, playing a homicidal butler in the last) to supplying the voice of the Chairmouse in the Disney animated features &quot;The Rescuers&quot; and &quot;The Rescuers Down Under.&quot; He played the role of Winston Havelock, a put-out-to-grass former Royal Flying Corps airman in the 1999 adventure film &quot;The Mummy.&quot; In 2004, Fox made his final appearance in &quot;Surge of Power: The Stuff of Heroes&quot;.

===Television===

In 1961 he played Malcolm in all 26 episodes in the comedy series &quot;Three Live Wires&quot;.

Between 1967 and 1972, Fox portrayed the witch doctor Dr. Bombay on 18 episodes of the sitcom &quot;Bewitched&quot;. However, his first appearance on that show was not as Dr. Bombay, but as a professional witch debunker, Osgood Rightmire, in 1966. He reprised the role of Dr. Bombay on the 1977 sequel series &quot;Tabitha&quot;, and again in 1999 on the soap opera &quot;Passions&quot;, and spoofed it as a genie doctor (&quot;wish doctor&quot;) in a 1989 episode of &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;. Fox was the penultimate surviving adult recurring cast member of &quot;Bewitched&quot;, leaving Nancy Kovack (who portrayed character Darrin Stephens&#x27; ex-girlfriend Sheila throughout the series) and Bernie Kopell (who appeared as various characters in 9 episodes) as the only remaining adult cast members upon his death; child actors Erin Murphy and David Lawrence, who portrayed Darrin and Samantha&#x27;s children (Tabitha and Adam) are still alive.

Between 1965 and 1970, Fox portrayed the bumbling &quot;Colonel&quot; Rodney Crittendon on eight episodes of &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; (Crittendon is a Royal Air Force group captain, and since the United States military has no &quot;group captain&quot; rank, Crittendon was referred to as &quot;colonel,&quot; the equivalent American rank to avoid confusion for the show&#x27;s US audience). He appeared in two episodes in the detective mystery series &quot;Columbo&quot;, &quot;Dagger of the Mind&quot; and &quot;Troubled Waters&quot;. Fox also appeared as English valet Malcolm Meriweather in three episodes of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, and in &quot;Knight Rider&quot; as Commander Smiths in season 2, episode 8.

Fox appeared as a British Major in &quot;The Phantom Major&quot;, episode 3 of &quot;F Troop&quot;, and in &quot;Tea and Empathy&quot;, episode 18 of season 6 of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. In 1964, Fox appeared in episode 117 of &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, titled &quot;Girls Will Be Boys&quot;. Fox plays the father of a little girl who keeps beating up Richie Petrie. He also appeared in &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Petrie&quot;, where he played a night school creative writing teacher, and in &quot;Never Bathe on Saturday&quot; as the house detective. In 1965 Fox made a guest appearance on &quot;Perry Mason&quot; as Peter Stange in &quot;The Case of the Laughing Lady&quot;.

Fox also appeared in &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot;; in &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; (&quot;The Thor Affair&quot; episode as munitions magnate Brutus Thor, intent on assassinating a &quot;Gandhi-like&quot; figure who&#x27;s attempting to bring world peace (1966) as well as in the two-part episode &quot;The Bridge of Lions Affair&quot; in 1966, wherein he starred as THRUSH agent Jordin, whose constant response to each additional assignment is &quot;I&#x27;ll look into it&quot;); and in the &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; episode &quot;One White Rose for Death&quot; in 1986. In addition, he co-starred with Michael Evans as Dr. Watson in &quot;Sherlock &amp; Me&quot; in the early 1980s.

<text>Harry Reichenbach (1882 – 1931) was a US press agent and publicist who staged sensational publicity stunts to promote films. He was one of the founding members of the Associated Motion Picture Advertisers.

==Biography==
Born in Frostburg, Maryland, in 1882, Reichenbach worked both for actors as an agent and for the film studios as a promoter. Among his first jobs was to promote a woman called &quot;Sober Sue&quot; who was said never to smile. He got her a contract at the Victoria Theater on Broadway and suggested they offer $1,000 to any New York comedian who could make her laugh.

Between 1914-1916 he served as publicity director for various motion picture companies: Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Co.,
Alco Film Corp., Bosworth Inc., Metro Pictures, Equitable Motion Picture Corp., World Film Co., and Frohman Amusement Corp.
Reichenbach claims to have popularized lithographs of the 1913 nude painting &quot;September Morn&quot; while working at an art shop in New York, by having accomplices complain to the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice about the shop window display that he himself had arranged, and by staging a crowd outside the shop. Reichenbach&#x27;s story has been questioned, as the painting became notorious in Chicago before New York, and records only show a New York art shop complaining of lost business as a result.

For the 1915 film &quot;Trilby&quot;, which included nude scenes and hypnotism, Reichenbach hired a young woman to run several times around the block and take a seat besides him just before the movie ended. She looked agitated and exhausted and Reichenbach hinted that the hypnosis scenes in the movie might have something to do with it. He also arranged that various psychologists would speculate on possible effects of hypnosis through cinema.

In December 1916 Reichenbach founded his own public relations company. 
To promote the sequel &quot;the Return of Tarzan&quot;, Reichenbach hired an actor who checked into the Hotel Bellclaire under the name &quot;Thomas R. Zann&quot;. Zann had a huge crate that was hoisted to his room through a window, and upon arrival he ordered fifteen pounds of raw beef to be sent to his room. When the cook and the hotel detective arrived, they found that the meat was for the guest&#x27;s pet lion. Hotel called for police and the &quot;Mr Zann&quot; explained to them and the press that the lion would be appearing at the opening of the new Tarzan film.

In other publicity stunts, Reichenbach would stage fake kidnappings of actresses set to appear in his films. One attempt involved crossing the border into Mexico, which resulted in United States president Woodrow Wilson writing an angry letter to Reichenbach asking him to stop.

One of the actors Reichenbach worked for was Rudolf Valentino. Reichenbach convinced him to grow a goatee beard upon his return to the United States in 1924, with the intention of causing a negative public reaction which could be made good by shaving it off. Reichenbach then spoke at the Associated Master Barbers convention, calling for a boycott of Valentino films until he removed his beard. The story ran for months in American newspapers.

In 1928, Reichenbach was managing the Colony Theater in New York City and took Walt Disney&#x27;s animated film &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; for a two-week run.

When Reichenbach was working for actor Francis X. Bushman, he took him to see studio executives. He began to walk with Bushman from the railway station and dropped pennies to the street from his pocket. Many people followed them, picking up the coins. The crowd gave the studio executives an impression that Bushman was very popular and they signed him up for a big contract with Metro Pictures.

For &quot;The Virgin of Stamboul&quot;, he hired actors to pose as a clandestine Turkish rescue party that was hunting for a royal bride who had eloped with an American soldier. Reichenbach leaked the details to the press. His 1931 book, &quot;Phantom Fame&quot;, written with David Freedman, was the basis of the 1932 film &quot;The Half-Naked Truth&quot;.

Harry Reichenbach died July 4, 1931.

<doc id="906422" wikidata="Q6502242" url="?curid=906422" title="Lavaca Bay">
<text>Lavaca Bay () is a northwestern extension of the Matagorda Bay system found mostly in Calhoun County, Texas, United States. The ports of Port Lavaca and Point Comfort have been established on the bay, and are the main areas of human habitation. Linnville was located on the bay until its abandonment after the Great Raid of 1840, and the major port of Indianola was found near the confluence with the main Matagorda Bay, until the town&#x27;s final destruction following the massive hurricane of 1886. Smaller communities include Olivia, Alamo Beach and Magnolia Beach. Lavaca Bay is approximately northeast of Corpus Christi, about southwest of Houston, and southeast of San Antonio.

In the late 1680s, French explorer René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle built a colony dubbed Fort St. Louis in this area. A June 1996 dig at the site that was believed to be the correct location revealed eight French cannon. This led archeologists to excavate the Keeran Ranch site in the area, during 1996–2002; they concluded that the Spanish Presidio La Bahía fort &quot;was built on the La Salle settlement&quot;. Some 10 percent of the artifacts recovered are believed to have originated in France. 

The bay is noted for its superfund site, caused by mercury pollution from the heavy industry in Point Comfort (specifically Alcoa), across the bay from the largest settlement of Port Lavaca. Although fishing has declined in recent years due to fears of contamination, the bay supports a large finfish population, and the efforts of environmental organizations and the federal government have pressured Alcoa to reduce the polluted areas.

==History==

Lavaca Bay was formed when the sea level rose following the last ice age, flooding the Lavaca River-Garcitas Creek basin. The name comes from the Spanish adaptation of the French &quot;vache&quot; or cow, given to the area by French explorer René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle for the sightings of Plains Bison, which were once common near the bay and the creeks that feed it. It is believed La Salle established his Fort St. Louis colony near the bay on Garcitas Creek. The first sizable human settlement on the bay shore was at the town of New Port, established in 1831 by Irish merchant John J. Linn as part of De León&#x27;s colony. The site was later renamed Linnville, and grew to a population of 200 by 1839. It was described as &quot;a place of considerable business&quot; in &quot;Sketches of Texas in 1840&quot;, and was used extensively during the early years of the Republic of Texas. Future San Antonio Mayor Samuel Maverick owned a warehouse in the town, along with many other prominent Texans. The town was destroyed during the Great Raid of 1840, orchestrated by the Comanche Indians, and was later abandoned.

Port Lavaca or Lavaca, developed after the abandonment of Linnville. It grew substantially following the destruction of Indianola, and became a prominent shipping location and national leader in shrimp production. Across the bay and currently connected by Texas State Highway 35, the town of Point Comfort is found. It was incorporated in 1953 at a citywide vote and is known for its large aluminium and petrochemical plants built in the 1960s. The small town of Olivia, which was founded in 1892 as a Swedish Lutheran community, is located on the shores of Keller Bay. The unincorporated towns of Alamo Beach, established around 1900, and Magnolia Beach, founded sometime thereafter, and named for the Magnolia figs produced in the area, are found north of the remains of the ghost town of Indianola.

==Features==

Lavaca Bay is the largest extension of the Matagorda Bay system and includes its own extensions of Chocolate Bay to the southwest, Cox Bay to the east, and Keller Bay to the southeast. The Lavaca River as well as Garcitas Creek and Venado Creek supply the bay with fresh water from the north. Channels have been dredged to connect the bay to the Intracoastal Waterway, which runs to the south. On average, the bay is about in depth.

Unlike most of the Matagorda Bay system, Lavaca Bay has a mostly muddy bottom with large amounts of oyster reefs and spoils islands formed by the dredging of several canals. The shores are lined with grassy bluffs and a thick cover of trees. The Lavaca River enters near the Port Lavaca Causeway as it traverses Lavaca Bay from Port Lavaca to Point Comfort at the center of the bay, which is also its narrowest width. The river flows southeast from its source in northeast Gonzales County, draining approximately into Lavaca Bay. South of the Port Lavaca Causeway in Point Comfort, on the bay&#x27;s eastern shore, a heavy industrial sector is located, which lines the coast to Cox Bay, which extends to the east. South of Cox Bay is the larger Keller Bay extension, which extends the bay to its easternmost point near Olivia. Below the extension, is a narrow peninsula, bounded by Matagorda Bay to the south, which extends west to the mouth of Lavaca Bay. Across the mouth on the western shore, past the Matagorda Ship Channel, which runs through the middle of the bay to Point Comfort, the town of Magnolia Beach is found. To the northwest is the town of Alamo Beach, located on Gailinipper Point, from which a major oyster reef begins across the bay to Point Comfort. The point is located on the northeastern extreme of a headland that juts to the north, forming Chocolate Bay to the west. Port Lavaca is found north of Chocolate Bay, back at the Port Lavaca Causeway. North of the causeway is a large circular extension, forming the northern boundary of the Lavaca Bay. The northwestern extreme is formed by Garcitas Cove, fed by Garcitas Creek, which flows from its source in DeWitt County. To the east is Venado Creek, which converges with the bay, northwest of the mouth of the Lavaca River.

==Ecosystem==

Lavaca Bay hosts a wide range of finfish including Black drum, Flounder, Redfish, Sheepshead and Speckled trout, however it suffers from mercury pollution. An Alcoa plant in Point Comfort dumped an estimated of mercury into the bay per day in the 1960s, affecting . A mercury superfund was established at the site, and the processing of oysters and blue crab in certain locations was prohibited. A study revealed that the bay&#x27;s detritus is more than ten times as contaminated as nearby Keller Bay.

The pollution issue is a main concern of citizens of Calhoun County, and has attracted demonstrations against industry in Point Comfort. However, Alcoa has worked with state and federal officials, spending $110 million to reduce the size of the superfund site, as part of a 2005 settlement. Cooperation aims to create 70 additional acres of salt marsh and 11 acres of oyster reef habitat.

Locals have estimated that the only area still affected by contamination is just offshore from the Alcoa plant. Signs warning boaters of the water&#x27;s toxicity are found at the site. The stigma attached to the bay due to reports of pollution has discouraged fishing, enabling a healthy population to develop.

==Industry==

Industry is heavy along the bay, with an abundance of natural gas and oil wells at all corners. Natural gas was discovered at the site in 1934, and oil was discovered the next year. Point Comfort is home to several industrial plants along the shore, including Alcoa, Union Carbide, DuPont, and Formosa Plastics Corp. Despite the restrictions on the bay that prevent the production of fish and shellfish along the superfund site, seafood harvesting is a major industry. However, it is not as prominent as it was in the 1920s, when Port Lavaca led the nation in shrimp production, leading to the construction of a quick-freezing plant. Today, shrimping is only allowed south of the Port Lavaca Causeway, due to the north&#x27;s classification as a nursery location. Shellfish production is allowed in Keller Bay and Lavaca Bay south of Point Comfort, but is restricted along the eastern and northern coast and Chocolate Bay, and is conditionally approved in the remaining locations, including along the shore of Port Lavaca. A small tourism industry also fuels economic growth, spurred by the Port Lavaca State Fishing Pier found alongside the Port Lavaca Causeway. The pier once served as the causeway across the bay but was replaced in the 1960s and converted into a fishing pier of , billed as the longest in the world. However this pier is now memorialized by its remains, posts, and small platforms no longer accessible from the shore stand alongside the modern causeway.

<text>Alan Norman Cohen (December 19, 1930 – August 10, 2004) was the former co-owner of the Boston Celtics and the New Jersey Nets, and chairman and CEO of the Madison Square Garden Corporation, owner of the New York Knicks and the New York Rangers.

==Biography==
Born to a Jewish family, Cohen graduated from Columbia College in 1952 and Columbia Law School in 1954. While attending Columbia College, Cohen was initiated into the Delta chapter of Zeta Beta Tau fraternity. After school, he served in the U.S. Army and then went to work for Paul, Weiss, Rifkin, Wharton and Garrison in 1957 becoming a partner of the firm in 1964. In 1970 he accepted a position at Warner Communications (now WarnerMedia) as executive vice president where he was responsible for Atlantic Records, Elektra Records, and Warner Bros. Records. He joined with a group of investors including Warner CEO Steve Ross and purchased the New York Cosmos, which made international headlines by signing superstar Pelé.

In 1974 he became chairman and CEO of Madison Square Garden Corporation, a public corporation which owned the New York Knicks and the New York Rangers. In 1978, Cohen and a group of investors purchased the New Jersey Nets basketball team. In 1983, he sold his interest in the Nets, and together with his partners, Don Gaston and Paul Dupee, purchased the Boston Celtics. The Celtics won the NBA championship in 1984 and 1986, with superstar players Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, and Robert Parish. From 1985 to 1987, he served as chairman of the NBA Board of Governors helping to pioneer the concept of the salary cap.

While not known as an innovator, Cohen did come up with the idea of placing revolving advertisements courtside at NBA games. He was the founding Chairman of ANC Sports in Purchase, New York, a provider of rotational and LED signage at sports facilities; and served as co-chairman of Sportsco International which owns the SkyDome stadium in Toronto.

==Philanthropy==
Cohen served as a trustee or director of various entities including the Independence House, a youth offender rehabilitation facility; the Alvin Ailey Dance Theatre; the International Center for Photography; Haifa University; American Friends of the Hebrew University; the Educational Alliance; Columbia College; Columbia Law School; and the Graduate School of Management of the New School. He also served as the director of the American Friends of Tel Aviv University. He received Columbia University&#x27;s John Jay Award and was elected to Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. In 2001, Cohen was elected to the Board of Directors of the Jewish Federation of South Palm Beach County.

==Personal life==
Cohen was married twice. He had two children, Laurie Cohen Fenster and Gordon Cohen, with his first wife Joan Fields Cohen, who died in 1989; and one child, Rebecca Cohen, with his second wife Carol Cohen. Cohen died in Boca Raton, Florida, of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Services were held at the Park Avenue Synagogue in Manhattan.

<doc id="906424" wikidata="Q7048506" url="?curid=906424" title="Nome King">
<text>The Nome King is a fictional character created by American author L. Frank Baum, introduced in the 1907 book &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot;. The Nome King recurs in many of the &quot;Oz&quot; novels, being the most frequent antagonist in Baum&#x27;s book series.

==Precursor==
Katharine M. Rogers, a biographer of L. Frank Baum, has argued that there was a precursor of the Nome King in one of Baum&#x27;s pre-Oz works. In &quot;A New Wonderland&quot; (1899), later known as &quot;The Magical Monarch of Mo&quot;, there is a similar character called King Scowleyow. Rogers finds him a &quot;convincingly evil&quot; villain despite his ridiculous name. His people reportedly live in caves and mines. They dig iron and tin out of the rocks in their environment. They melt these metals into bars and sell them.

Scowleyow hates the King of Phunnyland and all his people, because they live so happily and &quot;care nothing for money. He decides to destroy Phunnyland and instructs his mechanics to build what is essentially a robot. It is described as a great man built of cast iron, and containing within him machinery. The robot is called &quot;the Cast-iron Man&quot;. The metallic creature roars, rolls his eyes, and gnashes his teeth. It is set on marching across a valley, destroying trees and houses on its path.

Rogers notes the similarities between Scowleyow and the Nome King: they represent the negation of good will and happiness, they are associated with the underground and material wealth, Scowleyow is a powerful figure who uses his technological knowledge to create a machine capable only of destruction, and both villains demonstrate the tendency of evil towards self-destruction.

==In the novels==
The character called the Nome King is originally named Roquat the Red. Later, he takes the name Ruggedo, which Baum first used in a stage adaptation. Even after Ruggedo loses his throne, he continues to think of himself as king and the Oz book authors politely refer to him that way. Authors Ruth Plumly Thompson and John R. Neill used the traditional spelling &quot;gnome&quot; so Ruggedo is the title character in Thompson&#x27;s &quot;The Gnome King of Oz&quot; (1927).

In Baum&#x27;s universe, the Nomes are immortal rock fairies who dwell underground. They hide jewels and precious metals in the earth, and resent the &quot;upstairs people&quot; who dig down for those valuables. Apparently as revenge, the Nome King enjoys keeping surface-dwellers as slaves—not for their labor but simply to have them.

The Nomes&#x27; greatest fear are eggs. Upon seeing Billina, Roquat is terrified, declaring that &quot;Eggs are poison to Nomes!&quot; He claims that any Nome who comes in contact with an egg will be weakened to the point that he can be easily destroyed unless he speaks a magic word only known to a few Nomes. Baum, however, strongly hints that the fear of eggs is unjustified, as the Scarecrow repeatedly pelts him with eggs at the end of the novel, causing him no apparent harm beyond stress enough to allow Dorothy Gale to remove his Magic Belt. Sally Roesch Wagner, in her pamphlet &quot;The Wonderful Mother of Oz&quot;, suggests that Matilda Joslyn Gage had made Baum aware that the egg is an important symbol of matriarchy, and that it is this that the Nomes (among whom no females are seen) actually fear.

In their first encounter with Roquat, in &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot; (1903), Princess Ozma, Dorothy Gale, and a party from the Emerald City free the royal family of Ev from his enslavement and, for good measure, take away his magic belt.

Roquat becomes so angry that he plots revenge in &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot; (1910). He has his subjects dig a tunnel under the Deadly Desert while his general recruits a host of evil spirits like the Whimsies, the Growleywogs, and the Phanfasms to conquer Oz. Fortunately at the moment of invasion, Ozma wishes (using her magic belt) for a large amount of dust to appear in the tunnel. Roquat and his allies thirstily taste the Water of Oblivion and forget everything where Roquat forgets his enmity and his name.

&quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot; (1914) reintroduces the Nome King with his new name, Ruggedo (all the Nomes, Whimsies, Growleywogs, and Phanfasms having forgotten the old one and old resentments). Using some personal magic, he has enslaved the Shaggy Man&#x27;s brother, a miner from Colorado. Shaggy, with the help of Betsy Bobbin, the Oogaboo army, some of Dorothy&#x27;s old friends, and Quox the dragon, conquer the Nome King again and Tititi-Hoochoo the Great Jinjin expels him from his kingdom, placing Chief Steward Kaliko on the throne. In &quot;Rinkitink in Oz&quot; (1916), Kaliko behaves much like his former master.

In &quot;The Magic of Oz&quot; (1919), the exile Ruggedo meets the young enchanter Kiki Aru and plans to destroy Oz again. He gets into the country without Ozma&#x27;s knowledge, creating havoc. However, he again drinks of the Water of Oblivion, and to stop him ever going bad again Ozma settles him in the Emerald City.

Soon after taking over the Oz series, Ruth Plumly Thompson brought back Ruggedo, his memory and rancor restored and living imprisoned under the city. Finding a box of mixed magic in &quot;Kabumpo in Oz&quot; (1922), he grows into a giant and runs away with Ozma&#x27;s royal palace on his head. He is placed on a Runaway Land which runs out to the Nonestic Ocean and strands him on an island.

In &quot;The Gnome King of Oz&quot; (1927), he is helped off the island by Peter Brown, an athletic boy from Philadelphia, making his first trip to Oz. As in &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot;, Ruggedo is quite friendly when he thinks he is going to get his way. After threatening the Emerald City utilizing a Cloak of Invisibility, he is hit with a Silence Stone and immediately struck dumb.

In &quot;Pirates in Oz&quot; (1931), the mute Ruggedo finds a town in the Land of Ev called Menankypoo, whose people speak with words across their foreheads and seek a dumb king. Peter, Pigasus and Captain Samuel Salt aid in his defeat and he is transformed into a jug.

In &quot;Handy Mandy in Oz&quot; (1937), the Wizard of Wutz, the handsome but cruel King of the Silver Mountain, restored Ruggedo&#x27;s proper form. At the end of that book, Himself the Elf transforms both of them into cacti, so that they can never make trouble again.

Ruggedo made no further appearances in the original Oz series, but his further adventures have been written in several later books (some of which harmonize with one another; others which are contradictory).

==The Nome King and the Gnome King==
Much fan discussion has revolved around the identity of the Gnome King in Baum&#x27;s &quot;The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus&quot; (1902), a jolly rock dweller who does not believe in giving, but only in even exchange. His gnomes watch over the rocks in the Forest of Burzee and make sleigh bells for each of Santa Claus&#x27;s ten reindeer that he gives in exchange for toys for his children. An editor&#x27;s note to Judy Pike&#x27;s article &quot;The Decline and Fall of the Nome King&quot; conjectures that the Gnome King is the Nome King&#x27;s father.

==Analysis==
Concerning the original depiction of the Nome King by L. Frank Baum, essayist Suzanne Rahn has suggested that he was a &quot;distinctly American kind of monarch&quot;. Rather than a traditional king, the Nome King was more of an industrial capitalist. His power resided in controlling a monopoly. Ozma&#x27;s relationship with the Nome Kingdom has been discussed as an example of imperialism in English literature. Rahn compares the king to industrialists Andrew Carnegie (1835–1919), J. P. Morgan (1837-1913), and John D. Rockefeller (1839–1937). Richard Tuerk expands this theory to include the other Nome King, Kaliko. In &quot;Rinkitink in Oz&quot; (1916), Kaliko says to his allies Queen Cor and King Gos: &quot;as a matter of business policy we powerful Kings must stand together and trample the weaker ones under our feet&quot;. In this case, Baum makes his replacement Nome king sound like a stereotypical capitalist from his time period.

According to Jack Zipes, the Gnome King represents materialist greed. He is driven by a lust for power for the sake of power. Once defeated, the King gains a new sinister motivation, revenge. He and his allies want to enslave people to attain wealth and power. Oz is Baum&#x27;s version of the utopia and the Nome King strives to undermine this utopian civilization.

Zipes believes that Baum was against any kind of violence. In &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot; (1910), the Nome King&#x27;s invasion of Oz is therefore defeated in a non-violent way. Baum invented a fountain filled with the water of oblivion. A single sip of this water makes the drinker forget everything, including any evil intentions. The would-be invaders of Oz drink from the fountain, forget everything, and return home. Zipes argues that Baum was not going for a message of turning the other cheek. He was aware that if one uses the same methods as one&#x27;s enemies, one risks becoming like them. If the defenders of Oz became cutthroat and militant like the Nome King and his forces, this would have tarnished the spirit and principles of Oz. So their victory, as orchestrated by Ozma is using a different method, oblivion. The method is creative, humane, and humanitarian.

Gore Vidal argued that Oz represents a &quot;pastoral dream&quot; deriving from the ideals of Thomas Jefferson, though here the slaves have been replaced by magic and good will. The Nome King and his black magic represent a technological civilization, driven by machines and industrialization. Vidal concluded that &quot;the Nome King has governed the United States for more than a century; and he shows no sign of wanting to abdicate.&quot;

Zipes believes that Baum was essentially a fairy tale writer. He places him in a group of writers with Charles Dickens (1812–1870), John Ruskin (1819-1900), George MacDonald (1824–1905), and Oscar Wilde (1854–1900). They brought an oppositional political perspective to their fairy tales and questioned the classical fairy tales and society at large. They reached out to young readers from the upper class, the petite bourgeoisie, and the working class. The literary fairy tale was their political weapon and they preached a message of social liberation. In Zipes words&#x27;: &quot;Their art was a subversive symbolic act intended to illuminate concrete utopias waiting to be realized once the authoritarian rule of the Nome King could be overcome&quot;.

Rogers points that &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot; (1910) was supposed to be the finale of the Oz series. Following the end of the Nome King&#x27;s invasion, Baum announced that the Land of Oz was forever closed from the outside world. The truth was that the writer had become tired of the series. In the preface of &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz&quot; (1908), Baum humorously complained that children kept asking him for more Oz tales. He claimed that he knew of many other stories and hoped to tell them as well. In other words, he was ready to move on to other works. This complain also appeared in &quot;The Road to Oz&quot; (1909), where he hinted at a coming finale to the series.

In this novel, the Nome King has lost all traces of being jolly and good-humored. He has long been stewing over his defeat and the loss of his magic belt. He feels nothing but a constant anger, which has destroyed his own capacity to feel happiness and makes his subjects miserable as well. The King himself points that he is now angry morning, noon, and night. He sees his situation as monotonous and preventing him from gaining any pleasure in life. Rogers observes that the King now resembles any number of historical rulers. He has become an irresponsible tyrant, and is driven only by malice. He also resembles a naughty child given to impotent rages. He starts the book by storming and raving &quot;all by himself&quot;. He walks up and down in his jewel-studded cavern and gets angrier all the time. He also turns his anger towards his own subjects, when they disagree with him. He punishes them by throwing them away, though Baum does not really explain the meaning of this punishment. Rogers suggests that it sounds &quot;mysteriously horrible&quot;.

Despite Baum&#x27;s intentions to end the Oz series, he eventually returned to it. He continued writing it from 1912 until his death in 1919. His motivations for returning to it were the readers&#x27; continued demand for new stories, his financial need for commercially successful stories, and his own fascination with the world of Oz. In this second period of Oz, Oz becomes a &quot;socialist paradise&quot;. The threats to it are genetic experimentation and abuse of magic. The Nome King returns in &quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot; (1914), where he represents cruel oppression.

Jason M. Bell and Jessica Bell trace the slavery and emancipation theme in the Oz tales to Baum&#x27;s own childhood. As a child, Baum experienced the American Civil War (1861-1865) and the consequent abolition of slavery in the United States. The heroes of the Oz tales tend to be abolitionists and strive to end slavery in any form. The villains are slave owners who seek to enslave others and institute slavery. The inevitable conflict between the two sides is a recurring theme in the Oz tales and has in their view contributed to the enduring popularity of the series. The Bells argue that it is no coincidence that abolitionist Dorothy Gale is from Kansas. Baum was a child during the Bleeding Kansas conflict (1854-1861). Thousands of abolitionists moved to Kansas to vote against slavery, while Border Ruffians from Missouri crossed the borders to stop them. The Nome King is a slave owner and a chauvinist. He is outsmarted and humiliated by Billina the hen, and literally left with egg on his face. The writers find it telling that the hyper-masculine Nomes and their King are terrified of feminine eggs.

==In other media==
The Nome King was first played by Paul de Dupont in &quot;The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays&quot; (1908). John Dunsmure played Ruggedo, the Metal Monarch in the stage play &quot;The Tik-Tok Man of Oz&quot; (1913), by Baum, Louis F. Gottschalk, and Victor Schertzinger, produced in Los Angeles by Oliver Morosco. In the play, he sings a duet with Polychrome titled &quot;When in Trouble Come to Papa&quot;. As in the novel, the lack of females among Nomes causes Ruggedo to be willing to take her as wife, sister, or daughter so long as she remains to brighten his kingdom, and the song has him trying out the father option.

Over the summer of 2007, South Coast Repertory performed a play called Time Again in Oz, featuring many familiar Oz characters, such as Roquat the Nome King, Tik-Tok, Uncle Henry, and, of course, Dorothy. Instead of being portrayed as an old man that looks like a mineral, Roquat is identified as being tall, rock-like with a boulder-like mass for his torso, and wears a large crown upon his rocky head. He controls the Nomes at will, headed by his lead Nome, Feldspar, who is very similar to Chistery, the flying monkey character from the Broadway adaptation, Wicked.

The Nome King was portrayed on film by Nicol Williamson in 1985&#x27;s &quot;Return to Oz&quot; which was based loosely on the books &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot; and &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot;. In that film, his rock-like nature was taken to the extreme via Will Vinton&#x27;s Claymation. His personality and characterization largely stays true to how he is portrayed in the original novels, being seemingly fair and courteous to Dorothy and her companions under the belief that they will fail a game he sets up for them (in which they touch an ornament from his collection and say &quot;Oz&quot; simultaneously, having three chances each to do so) in order to give them a chance to locate the Scarecrow, whom the Nome King transformed into an ornament shortly after their entering of his domain. Of the group, all but Dorothy fail and are subsequently transformed also. As this occurs, the Nome King progressively becomes more organic looking in appearance, and would have most likely became completely human should Dorothy failed on her last guess (why the Nome King so desires this is never elaborated upon). It is only when she successfully locates the Scarecrow and her friends, subsequently reverting the Nome King to his original form, does he reveal a more sadistic and threatening side to his character (hinted at throughout the film in his earlier exchanges with Princess Mombi and also his Nome Messenger). Hungry for revenge, he grows to an enormous size surrounded in a blaze of fire and tries to eat the protagonists in a scene inspired by Georges Méliès&#x27;s &quot;The Conquest of the Pole&quot; (1912). He is eventually destroyed by ingesting the hidden Billina&#x27;s chicken egg, laid in a panic by the hen (herself hiding in Jack Pumpkinhead&#x27;s hollow head), since eggs are poisonous to Nomes. In Kansas, his counterpart is Dr. J.B. Worley (also portrayed by Williamson) who is a psychiatrist obsessed with machines and has an interest in electro-therapy. Dorothy was taken to his clinic when she was unable to sleep. By the end of the movie, it was mentioned by Aunt Em that Dr. Worley perished in the fire trying to save his machines.

Roquat, having regained his original name, is the villain of &quot;The Oz-Wonderland War&quot;, published by DC Comics and starring Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew. Much of the story retreads material from &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot;, as he has also regained the Magic Belt, and it must be seized again. He uses Nomes that parody the Fantastic Four and the Hulk that get pelted by Easter Eggs, again to no apparent harm, as in the book.

Michael G. Ploog, who was a conceptual artist of &quot;Return to Oz&quot;, wrote and illustrated a graphic novel based on &quot;The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus&quot; in which the Gnome King looked like the Nome King&#x27;s likeness in the film, but whose function was greatly expanded from the novel to be the ruler of all the Immortals.

In L. Sprague de Camp&#x27;s &quot;Harold Shea&quot; series he teams his protagonist with the Nome King in &quot;Sir Harold and the Gnome King.&quot;

In Bill Willingham&#x27;s Vertigo comic book series &quot;Fables&quot;, the Nome King has sided with the Adversary and is now the ruler of Oz. He is later deposed in an uprising led by former Fabletown resident Bufkin, one of the winged monkeys native to Oz.

In the comic book &quot;The Oz/Wonderland Chronicles&quot; #1 (2006), Ruggedo is coerced by a new Witch to bring the Jabberwocky creature to life.

In the novel &quot;&quot;, the Nome King is alluded to once, along with other underground threats believed by the citizens of Wicked&#x27;s Oz to be mere legend. It is not officially stated whether the Nome King, or other figures undeniably real in Baum&#x27;s Oz such as Lurline, actually exist in Maguire&#x27;s Oz.

In &quot;&quot;, Zoe is read the Oz books by her mother and she later compares Drake to the Nome King in that he is bad simply because he has never tried to be good.

In &quot;Emerald City Confidential&quot;, the Nome King is now a bartender and is mostly reformed (although he is not above using illegal magic to gain back his fortune).

Sherwood Smith&#x27;s novels &quot;The Emerald Wand of Oz&quot; and &quot;Trouble Under Oz&quot; feature Ruggedo&#x27;s son, Prince Rikiki, who aspires to regain his father&#x27;s kingdom.

The Nome King appears in &quot;Dorothy and the Witches of Oz&quot; played by professional wrestler Al Snow. He is among the villains that accompanies the Wicked Witch of the West in her attack on Earth. During the climax of the film, the Nome King fights the Tin Man and is defeated by him.

The Nome King appears in the comic series &quot;Fables&quot;. He is the current ruler of that land, as well as many of the surrounding kingdoms and Imperial districts. Nome King attended the Imperial conference called after the destruction of the magic grove and was positively delighted by the plans outlined by the Snow Queen for the effective genocide of the mundane population. He did feel, however, that the plan could be improved with his assistance, feeling that he had many minions that could be of great use. In the wake of the fall of the Adversary&#x27;s Empire, the Nome King creates his own pan-Ozian empire. He was killed during Bufkin&#x27;s revolution when the Nome King&#x27;s own hanging rope magically came to life and snapped its master&#x27;s head off.
The Nome King appears in the season one finale of &quot;Emerald City&quot; portrayed by Julian Bleach. He appears as a flayed man trapped by Mistress East in the Prison of the Abject, possibly even the first to be imprisoned there. Dorothy Gale frees him in her search of someone able to control the stone giants. He manages to find his skin and puts it back on, before growing bat-like wings and flying to the Emerald City. While his name isn&#x27;t revealed, it appears he is a form of the so-called &quot;Beast Forever&quot; that the people of Oz are afraid of. The episode ends with Dorothy being called back to Oz to help save it from the Beast Forever. The Beast Forever&#x27;s identity is revealed in the credits, which list him as &quot;Roquat&quot;.

The Nome King appears in &quot;Tom and Jerry: Back to Oz&quot; voiced by Jason Alexander. He has taken over the Emerald City, captured Glinda and Tuffy, took Glinda&#x27;s wand, and now he wants to destroy Dorothy and seize her ruby slippers. Since his great fear of the Wizard has kept him underground, Dorothy and her friends journey to Topeka to get the Wizard to return to the Land of Oz and set everything straight. The Nome King is defeated when he falls under the Jitterbug&#x27;s dancing spell and loses the Ruby Slippers when Tom and Jerry try to keep him from falling into the Pit of Nome Return. His Kansas counterpart is Lucius Bibb who is the neighbor of Aunt Em and Uncle Henry. He files a lawsuit claiming that the twister released some of the Gale pigs who then plundered his prize watermelon patch. He takes the animals away unless Aunt Em, Uncle Henry, and their farmhands can get jobs to get the money to keep their farm animals in twenty-four hours. By the end of the film, Dorothy, Toto, Tom, and Jerry use the potion the Wizard gave them to help pay off Mr. Bibb and have him cancel his lawsuit against the Gale farm where he gets a larger watermelon.

The Nome King appears in &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz&quot; portrayed by J. P. Karliak. His plans to take over the Land of Oz and his fear of chickens remain intact with the series.

<doc id="906442" wikidata="Q886786" url="?curid=906442" title="Orélie-Antoine de Tounens">
<text>Orélie-Antoine de Tounens (born Antoine Tounens) (12 May 1825 – 17 September 1878) was a French &quot;avoué&quot; and adventurer who proclaimed by two decrees on 17 November 1860 and 20 November 1860 that Araucanía and Patagonia did not depend of any other states and that he himself was King of Araucanía and Patagonia. On 5 January 1862, he was arrested by the Chilean army and imprisoned. He was declared insane by the court of Santiago on 2 September 1862, and expelled to France on 28 October 1862. He tried three further times to go back to Araucanía to regain his &quot;kingdom&quot;, but without success, and he died in poverty on 17 September 1878, in Tourtoirac, France.

==Biography==
In 1858, Antoine de Tounens, a former &quot;avoué&quot; in Périgueux (France) had read the book of Alonso de Ercilla, &quot;La Araucana&quot;, and decided to go to Araucania, inspired by the book to become the King of Araucania. He disembarked at the port of Coquimbo in Chile and spent two years in Valparaíso and Santiago, studying Spanish. Later he moved South to the Bio-Bio where he met some loncos (Mapuche tribal leaders). He promised them arms and the help of France to maintain their independence from Chile. The indians elected him Great Toqui, Supreme Chieftain of the Mapuches. 

By two decrees on 17 November 1860 and 20 November 1860, he proclaimed himself king of Araucania and Patagonia under the name Orélie-Antoine I.

De Tounens wrote in his Memoirs in 1863 &quot;I took the title of king, by an ordinance of 17 November 1860, which established the bases of the hereditary constitutional government founded by me [...] On 17 November I returned to Araucania to be publicly recognized as king, which took place on 25, 26, 27 and 30 December. Weren&#x27;t we, the Araucanians, free to bestow power on me, and I to accept it?&quot;

De Tounens sent copies of the constitution of his kingdom to Chilean newspapers and &quot;El Mercurio&quot; published a portion of it on 29 December 1860. Then he returned to Valparaíso to wait for the representatives of the Chilean government. They ignored him. He also attempted to involve the French government in his idea, but the French consul, after making some inquiries, came to the conclusion that de Tounens was insane. He returned to Araucanía where many Mapuche tribes were again preparing to fight the incursions of the Chilean Army during the occupation of Araucanía.

The supposed founding of the Kingdom of Araucanía and Patagonia led to the Occupation of Araucanía by Chilean forces. Chilean president José Joaquín Pérez authorized Cornelio Saavedra Rodríguez, commander of the Chilean troops, to invade Araucanía.
His servant, Juan Bautista Rosales, contacted Chilean authorities and Antoine de Tounens was captured on 5 January 1862 by the Chilean army, then imprisoned and declared insane on 2 September 1862 by the court of Santiago and expelled to France on 28 October 1862.

De Tounens published his memoirs in 1863. In 1869, he returned to Araucanía, via Buenos Aires. The Mapuche were surprised to see him because Chileans had told them that they had executed him. De Tounens proceeded to reorganize his realm and again attracted the attention of the Chilean authorities. Colonel Cornelio Saavedra Rodríguez promised a reward for his head but the Mapuche decided to defend their unusual ally.

Without proper funds in 1871 he had to return to France, where he published a second set of his memoirs. He also founded an Araucanian newspaper &quot;La Corona de Acero&quot; (&quot;The Steel Crown&quot;). In 1872, he proclaimed that he was seeking a bride so that he might sire an heir; indeed, the next year, he wrote to tell his brother that he intended to marry a &quot;mademoiselle de Percy&quot;, but there is no evidence that he ever did.

In 1874, he tried again to return to his kingdom, this time with some arms and ammunition he was able to gather with the feeble support of a few entrepreneurs in Europe. Because he was &quot;persona non grata&quot; in Chile, he traveled with a false passport. However, he was recognized as soon as he landed in Bahía Blanca (on the Argentine coast) in July 1874, and was summarily deported to France.

De Tounens tried to return again in 1876. However, local settlers robbed him on his way to Patagonia and handed him over to Chilean authorities. He also fell ill and had to go through an operation to survive. His health did not allow him to continue his journey and he had to return to France.

On 28 August 1873 the Criminal Court of Paris ruled that Antoine de Tounens, first king of Araucania and Patagonia did not justify his status of sovereign.

De Tounens died in poverty on 17 September 1878 in Tourtoirac, France.

De Tounens had no children but since his death in 1878, some French citizens without familial relations declared themselves to be pretenders to the throne of Araucania and Patagonia. Whether the Mapuche themselves accept this, or are even aware of it, is unclear.

The pretenders to the throne of Araucania and Patagonia are called monarchs and sovereigns of fantasy, &quot;having only fanciful claims to a kingdom without legal existence and having no international recognition&quot;.

<text>Juan Antonio Lavalleja y de la Torre (June 24, 1784 – October 22, 1853) was an Uruguayan libertador, revolutionary, military general, and political figure. He was born in Minas, in a region now named after him as the Lavalleja Department of Uruguay.

==Pre-Independence role==

Lavalleja led the group called the Thirty-Three Orientals during Uruguay&#x27;s Declaration of Independence from the Empire of Brazil in 1825. His leadership of this group has taken on somewhat mythic proportions in popular Uruguayan historiography. 

Before leading the Thirty-Three, he had been captured by the Portuguese in 1818 and returned to Uruguay in 1821. Lavalleja first met Fructuoso Rivera, another leading Uruguayan politician of his era and a future rival, in 1825 during an event that would become known as the Abrazo del Monzón (Embrace of the Monsoon).

==Post-Independence career==

After Uruguay&#x27;s declaration of independence in 1825, Lavalleja was brigadier general and commander-in-chief of its national army between 1825 and 1828. He led his forces to victory at the Battle of Sarandí and commanded the forces of the Banda Oriental among allied forces of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata to victory in the Battle of Ituzaingó, creating conditions for Uruguayan independence to be recognized in the Treaty of Montevideo in 1828.

In 1830, under the Constitution of Uruguay of 1830, Lavalleja sought national presidency as a rival to Fructuoso Rivera, but he lost. In protest of his loss, Lavalleja contributed to what is now known as the Uruguayan Civil War until it ended in 1851. He was then part of a triumvirate chosen in 1852 to govern Uruguay, but he died shortly after his accession to power, on October 22, 1853 in Montevideo.

==Historical legacy==

Lavalleja is remembered as a rebel who led the fight against the Empire of Brazil. As one of the major figures in early, post-independence Uruguayan history he is identified as a skilled but reactionary warrior who contributed to the culture of intermittent civil war which dogged Uruguay for much of the 19th century.

==Family==
Lavalleja married Ana Monterroso in 1817; she was sister of José Benito Monterroso.

<text>Fibrosis, also known as fibrotic scarring, is the development of fibrous connective tissue in response to an injury. Fibrosis can be a normal connective tissue deposition or excessive tissue deposition caused by a disease.

Repeated injuries, chronic inflammation and repair are susceptible to fibrosis, where an accidental excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix components, such as the collagen, is produced by fibroblasts, leading to the formation of a permanent fibrotic scar.

In response to injury, this is called scarring, and if fibrosis arises from a single cell line, this is called a fibroma. Physiologically, fibrosis acts to deposit connective tissue, which can interfere with or totally inhibit the normal architecture and function of the underlying organ or tissue. Fibrosis can be used to describe the pathological state of excess deposition of fibrous tissue, as well as the process of connective tissue deposition in healing. Defined by the pathological accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, fibrosis results in scarring and thickening of the affected it is in essence a natural wound healing response which interferes with normal organ function.

==Physiology==
Fibrosis is similar to the process of scarring, in that both involve stimulated fibroblasts laying down connective tissue, including collagen and glycosaminoglycans. The process is initiated when immune cells such as macrophages release soluble factors that stimulate fibroblasts. The most well characterized pro-fibrotic mediator is TGF beta, which is released by macrophages as well as any damaged tissue between surfaces called interstitium. Other soluble mediators of fibrosis include CTGF, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and interleukin 10 (IL-10). These initiate signal transduction pathways such as the AKT/mTOR and SMAD pathways that ultimately lead to the proliferation and activation of fibroblasts, which deposit extracellular matrix into the surrounding connective tissue. This process of tissue repair is a complex one, with tight regulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis and degradation ensuring maintenance of normal tissue architecture. However, the entire process, although necessary, can lead to a progressive irreversible fibrotic response if tissue injury is severe or repetitive, or if the wound healing response itself becomes deregulated.

==Anatomical location==
Fibrosis can occur in many tissues within the body, typically as a result of inflammation or damage. Common sites of fibrosis include the lungs, liver, kidneys, brain, and heart:
=== Lungs ===
* Fibrothorax
* Pulmonary fibrosis
** Cystic fibrosis
** Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (&quot;idiopathic&quot; meaning &#x27;of unknown cause&#x27;)
* Radiation-induced lung injury (following radiation therapies commonly used to treat cancer)

=== Liver ===
* Bridging fibrosis – an advanced stage of liver fibrosis, seen in the progressive form of chronic liver diseases. The term &quot;bridging&quot; refers to the formation of a &quot;bridge&quot; by a band of mature and thick fibrous tissue from the portal area to the central vein. This form of fibrosis leads to the formation of pseudolobules. Long-term exposure to hepatotoxins, such as thioacetamide, carbon tetrachloride, and diethylnitrosamine, has been shown to cause bridging fibrosis in experimental animal models.
* Senescence of hepatic stellate cells could prevent progression of liver fibrosis, although has not yet been implemented as a therapy due to risks associated with hepatic dysfunction.
* Cirrhosis

=== Kidney ===
* CYR61 induction of cellular senescence in the kidney has shown potential to limit renal fibrosis.

=== Brain ===
* Glial scar

===Heart===
Myocardial fibrosis has two forms:
* Interstitial fibrosis, described in cases of congestive heart failure and hypertension, and as part of normal cellular aging.
* Replacement fibrosis, indicating tissue damage from previous myocardial infarction.
=== Other ===
* Arterial stiffness
* Arthrofibrosis (knee, shoulder, other joints)
* Chronic kidney disease
* Crohn&#x27;s disease (intestine)
* Dupuytren&#x27;s contracture (hands, fingers)
* Keloid (skin)
* Lipedema (fat cells, typically in lower limbs)
* Mediastinal fibrosis (soft tissue of the mediastinum)
* Myelofibrosis (bone marrow)
* Myofibrosis (skeletal muscle)
* Peyronie&#x27;s disease (penis)
* Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (skin)
* Progressive massive fibrosis (lungs); a complication of pneumoconiosis
* Retroperitoneal fibrosis (soft tissue of the retroperitoneum)
* Scleroderma/systemic sclerosis (skin, lungs)
* Some forms of adhesive capsulitis (shoulder)

Fibrosis reversal

Historically, fibrosis was considered an irreversible process. However, several recent studies have demonstrated reversal in liver and lung tissue, and in cases of renal, myocardial, and oral-submucosal fibrosis.

<text>Athlete&#x27;s foot, known medically as tinea pedis, is a common skin infection of the feet caused by a fungus. Signs and symptoms often include itching, scaling, cracking and redness. In rare cases the skin may blister. Athlete&#x27;s foot fungus may infect any part of the foot, but most often grows between the toes. The next most common area is the bottom of the foot. The same fungus may also affect the nails or the hands. It is a member of the group of diseases known as &quot;tinea&quot;.

Athlete&#x27;s foot is caused by a number of different funguses, including species of &quot;Trichophyton&quot;, &quot;Epidermophyton&quot;, and &quot;Microsporum&quot;. The condition is typically acquired by coming into contact with infected skin, or fungus in the environment. Common places where the funguses can survive are around swimming pools and in locker rooms. They may also be spread from other animals. Usually diagnosis is made based on signs and symptoms; however, it can be confirmed either by culture or seeing hyphae using a microscope.

Athlete&#x27;s foot is not limited to just athletes: it can be caused by going barefoot in public showers, letting toenails grow too long, wearing shoes that are too tight, or not changing socks daily. It can be treated with topical antifungal medications such as clotrimazole or, for persistent infections, using oral antifungal medications such as terbinafine. Topical creams are typically recommended to be used for four weeks. Keeping infected feet dry and wearing sandals also assists with treatment.

Athlete&#x27;s foot was first medically described in 1908. Globally, athlete&#x27;s foot affects about 15% of the population. Males are more often affected than females. It occurs most frequently in older children or younger adults. Historically it is believed to have been a rare condition that became more frequent in the 20th century due to the greater use of shoes, health clubs, war, and travel.

== Signs and symptoms ==

Athlete&#x27;s foot is divided into four categories or presentations: chronic interdigital, plantar (chronic scaly; aka &quot;moccasin foot&quot;), acute ulcerative, and vesiculobullous. &quot;Interdigital&quot; means between the toes. &quot;Plantar&quot; here refers to the sole of the foot. The ulcerative condition includes macerated lesions with scaly borders. Maceration is the softening and breaking down of skin due to extensive exposure to moisture. A vesiculobullous disease is a type of mucocutaneous disease characterized by vesicles and bullae (blisters). Both vesicles and bullae are fluid-filled lesions, and they are distinguished by size (vesicles being less than 5 mm and bullae being larger than 5 mm, depending upon what definition is used).

Athlete&#x27;s foot occurs most often between the toes (interdigital), with the space between the fourth and fifth digits (the little toe and the fore toe) most commonly affected. Cases of interdigital athlete&#x27;s foot caused by &quot;Trichophyton rubrum&quot; may be symptomless, it may itch, or the skin between the toes may appear red or ulcerative (scaly, flaky, with soft and white if skin has been kept wet), with or without itching. An acute ulcerative variant of interdigital athlete&#x27;s foot caused by &quot;T. mentagrophytes&quot; is characterized by pain, maceration of the skin, erosions and fissuring of the skin, crusting, and an odor due to secondary bacterial infection.

Plantar athlete&#x27;s foot (moccasin foot) is also caused by &quot;T. rubrum&quot; which typically causes asymptomatic, slightly erythematous plaques (areas of redness of the skin) to form on the plantar surface (sole) of the foot that are often covered by fine, powdery hyperkeratotic scales.

The vesiculobullous type of athlete&#x27;s foot is less common and is usually caused by &quot;T. mentagrophytes&quot; and is characterized by a sudden outbreak of itchy blisters and vesicles on an erythematous base, usually appearing on the sole of the foot. This subtype of athlete&#x27;s foot is often complicated by secondary bacterial infection by &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot; or &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;.

=== Complications ===
As the disease progresses, the skin may crack, leading to bacterial skin infection and inflammation of the lymphatic vessels. If allowed to grow for too long, athlete&#x27;s foot fungus may spread to infect the toenails, feeding on the keratin in them, a condition called onychomycosis.

Because athlete&#x27;s foot may itch, it may also elicit the scratch reflex, causing the host to scratch the infected area before they realize it. Scratching can further damage the skin and worsen the condition by allowing the fungus to more easily spread and thrive. The itching sensation associated with athlete&#x27;s foot can be so severe that it may cause hosts to scratch vigorously enough to inflict excoriations (open wounds), which are susceptible to bacterial infection. Further scratching may remove scabs, inhibiting the healing process. Scratching infected areas may also spread the fungus to the fingers and under the fingernails. If not washed away soon enough, it can infect the fingers and fingernails, growing in the skin and in the nails (not just underneath). After scratching, it can be spread to wherever the person touches, including other parts of the body and to one&#x27;s environment. Scratching also causes infected skin scales to fall off into one&#x27;s environment, leading to further possible spread. When athlete&#x27;s foot fungus or infested skin particles spread to one&#x27;s environment (such as to clothes, shoes, bathroom, etc.) whether through scratching, falling, or rubbing off, not only can they infect other people, they can also reinfect (or further infect) the host they came from. For example, infected feet infest one&#x27;s socks and shoes which further expose the feet to the fungus and its spores when worn again.

The ease with which the fungus spreads to other areas of the body (on one&#x27;s fingers) poses another complication. When the fungus is spread to other parts of the body, it can easily be spread back to the feet after the feet have been treated. And because the condition is called something else in each place it takes hold (e.g., tinea corporis (ringworm) or tinea cruris (jock itch)), persons infected may not be aware it is the same disease.

Some individuals may experience an allergic response to the fungus called an id reaction in which blisters or vesicles can appear in areas such as the hands, chest, and arms. Treatment of the underlying infection typically results in the disappearance of the id reaction.

== Causes ==
Athlete&#x27;s foot is a form of dermatophytosis (fungal infection of the skin), caused by dermatophytes, funguses (most of which are mold) which inhabit dead layers of skin and digest keratin. Dermatophytes are anthropophilic, meaning these parasitic funguses prefer human hosts. Athlete&#x27;s foot is most commonly caused by the molds known as &quot;Trichophyton rubrum&quot; and &quot;T. mentagrophytes&quot;, but may also be caused by &quot;Epidermophyton floccosum&quot;. Most cases of athlete&#x27;s foot in the general population are caused by &quot;T. rubrum&quot;; however, the majority of athlete&#x27;s foot cases in athletes are caused by &quot;T. mentagrophytes&quot;.

=== Transmission ===
According to the UK&#x27;s National Health Service, &quot;Athlete&#x27;s foot is very contagious and can be spread through direct and indirect contact.&quot; The disease may spread to others directly when they touch the infection. People can contract the disease indirectly by coming into contact with contaminated items (clothes, towels, etc.) or surfaces (such as bathroom, shower, or locker room floors). The funguses that cause athlete&#x27;s foot can easily spread to one&#x27;s environment. Funguses rub off of fingers and bare feet, but also travel on the dead skin cells that continually fall off the body. Athlete&#x27;s foot funguses and infested skin particles and flakes may spread to socks, shoes, clothes, to other people, pets (via petting), bed sheets, bathtubs, showers, sinks, counters, towels, rugs, floors, and carpets.

When the fungus has spread to pets, it can subsequently spread to the hands and fingers of people who pet them. If a pet frequently gnaws upon itself, it might not be fleas it is reacting to, it may be the insatiable itch of tinea.

One way to contract athlete&#x27;s foot is to get a fungal infection somewhere else on the body first. The funguses causing athlete&#x27;s foot may spread from other areas of the body to the feet, usually by touching or scratching the affected area, thereby getting the fungus on the fingers, and then touching or scratching the feet. While the fungus remains the same, the name of the condition changes based on where on the body the infection is located. For example, the infection is known as tinea corporis (&quot;ringworm&quot;) when the torso or limbs are affected or tinea cruris (jock itch or dhobi itch) when the groin is affected. Clothes (or shoes), body heat, and sweat can keep the skin warm and moist, just the environment the fungus needs to thrive.

=== Risk factors ===
Besides being exposed to any of the modes of transmission presented above, there are additional risk factors that increase one&#x27;s chance of contracting athlete&#x27;s foot. Persons who have had athlete&#x27;s foot before are more likely to become infected than those who have not. Adults are more likely to catch athlete&#x27;s foot than children. Men have a higher chance of getting athlete&#x27;s foot than women. People with diabetes or weakened immune systems are more susceptible to the disease. HIV/AIDS hampers the immune system and increases the risk of acquiring athlete&#x27;s foot. Hyperhidrosis (abnormally increased sweating) increases the risk of infection and makes treatment more difficult.

== Diagnosis ==
When visiting a doctor, the basic diagnosis procedure applies. This includes checking the patient&#x27;s medical history and medical record for risk factors, a medical interview during which the doctor asks questions (such as about itching and scratching), and a physical examination. Athlete&#x27;s foot can usually be diagnosed by visual inspection of the skin and by identifying less obvious symptoms such as itching of the affected area.

If the diagnosis is uncertain, direct microscopy of a potassium hydroxide preparation of a skin scraping (known as a KOH test) can confirm the diagnosis of athlete&#x27;s foot and help rule out other possible causes, such as candidiasis, pitted keratolysis, erythrasma, contact dermatitis, eczema, or psoriasis. Dermatophytes known to cause athlete&#x27;s foot will demonstrate multiple septate branching hyphae on microscopy.

A Wood&#x27;s lamp (black light), although useful in diagnosing fungal infections of the scalp (tinea capitis), is not usually helpful in diagnosing athlete&#x27;s foot, since the common dermatophytes that cause this disease do not fluoresce under ultraviolet light.

== Prevention ==
There are several preventive foot hygiene measures that can prevent athlete&#x27;s foot and reduce recurrence. Some of these include: keeping the feet dry; clipping toenails short; using a separate nail clipper for infected toenails; using socks made from well-ventilated cotton or synthetic moisture wicking materials (to soak moisture away from the skin to help keep it dry); avoiding tight-fitting footwear; changing socks frequently; and wearing sandals while walking through communal areas such as gym showers and locker rooms.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, &quot;Nails should be clipped short and kept clean. Nails can house and spread the infection.&quot; Recurrence of athlete&#x27;s foot can be prevented with the use of antifungal powder on the feet.

The funguses (molds) that cause athlete&#x27;s foot require warmth and moisture to survive and grow. There is an increased risk of infection with exposure to warm, moist environments (e.g., occlusive footwear—shoes or boots that enclose the feet) and in shared humid environments such as communal showers, shared pools, and treatment tubs. Chlorine bleach is a disinfectant and common household cleaner that kills mold. Cleaning surfaces with a chlorine bleach solution prevents the disease from spreading from subsequent contact. Cleaning bathtubs, showers, bathroom floors, sinks, and counters with bleach helps prevent the spread of the disease, including reinfection.

Keeping socks and shoes clean (using bleach in the wash) is one way to prevent funguses from taking hold and spreading. Avoiding the sharing of boots and shoes is another way to prevent transmission. Athlete&#x27;s foot can be transmitted by sharing footwear with an infected person. Not sharing also applies to towels, because, though less common, funguses can be passed along on towels, especially damp ones.

== Treatment ==
Athlete&#x27;s foot resolves without medication in 30 to 40% of cases. Topical antifungal medication consistently produces much higher rates of cure.

Conventional treatment typically involves thoroughly washing the feet daily or twice daily, followed by the application of a topical medication. Because the outer skin layers are damaged and susceptible to reinfection, topical treatment generally continues until all layers of the skin are replaced, about 2 to 6 weeks after symptoms disappear. Keeping feet dry and practicing good hygiene (as described in the above section on prevention) is crucial for killing the fungus and preventing reinfection.

Treating the feet is not always enough. Once socks or shoes are infested with funguses, wearing them again can reinfect (or further infect) the feet. Socks can be effectively cleaned in the wash by adding bleach or by washing in water . 

To be effective, treatment includes all infected areas (such as toenails, hands, torso, etc.). Otherwise, the infection may continue to spread, including back to treated areas. For example, leaving fungal infection of the nail untreated may allow it to spread back to the rest of the foot, to become athlete&#x27;s foot once again.

Systematic review found that allylamines such as terbinafine are not more efficacious than azoles for the treatment of athlete&#x27;s foot.

Severe or prolonged fungal skin infections may require treatment with oral antifungal medication.

=== Topical treatments ===
There are many topical antifungal drugs useful in the treatment of athlete&#x27;s foot including: miconazole nitrate, clotrimazole, tolnaftate (a synthetic thiocarbamate), terbinafine hydrochloride, butenafine hydrochloride and undecylenic acid. The fungal infection may be treated with topical antifungal agents, which can take the form of a spray, powder, cream, or gel. Topical application of an antifungal cream such as butenafine once daily for one week or terbinafine once daily for two weeks is effective in most cases of athlete&#x27;s foot and is more effective than application of miconazole or clotrimazole. Plantar-type athlete&#x27;s foot is more resistant to topical treatments due to the presence of thickened hyperkeratotic skin on the sole of the foot. Keratolytic and humectant medications such as urea, salicylic acid (Whitfield&#x27;s ointment), and lactic acid are useful adjunct medications and improve penetration of antifungal agents into the thickened skin. Topical glucocorticoids are sometimes prescribed to alleviate inflammation and itching associated with the infection.

A solution of 1% potassium permanganate dissolved in hot water is an alternative to antifungal drugs. Potassium permanganate is a salt and a strong oxidizing agent.

=== Oral treatments ===
For severe or refractory cases of athlete&#x27;s foot oral terbinafine is more effective than griseofulvin. Fluconazole or itraconazole may also be taken orally for severe athlete&#x27;s foot infections. The most commonly reported adverse effect from these medications is gastrointestinal upset.

==Epidemiology==
Globally, fungal infections affect about 15% of the population and 20% of adults. Additionally, 70% of the population will experience athlete&#x27;s foot at some point in life. Athlete&#x27;s foot is common in individuals who wear unventilated (occlusive) footwear, such as rubber boots or vinyl shoes. Upon exposure to an athlete&#x27;s foot-causing fungus, the moist conditions generated from poor foot ventilation promotes growth of the fungus on the foot or between the toes. Occupationally, studies have shown increased prevalence of athlete&#x27;s foot among miners, soldiers, and athletes. Likewise, activities such as marathon running have seen increased prevalence of athlete&#x27;s foot. Countries and regions where going barefoot is more common experience much lower rates of athlete&#x27;s foot than do populations which habitually wear shoes; as a result, the disease has been called &quot;a penalty of civilization&quot;. Studies have demonstrated that men are infected 2 to 4 times more often than women. 

Cases of athlete&#x27;s foot were first documented around 1916 during World War I, where infection among soldiers was common. By 1928 it was estimated that nearly ten million Americans with cases of athlete&#x27;s foot; the alarming prevalence of the disease caused for public health concern. In the following year, an epidemiologic study was conducted on incoming freshman to the University of California; it was found that 53% of incoming freshman men had athlete&#x27;s foot and by year&#x27;s end that number had risen to 78%. Prevalence of the disease increased in the 1930s, specifically among individuals of higher socioeconomic status; these individuals had more access to common shared spaced such as pools, colleges, and athletic clubs where transmission of athlete&#x27;s foot-causing fungus was common. Prevalence in the United States was high enough to call for the use of sterilizing footbaths in the 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles. It was at this time public health officials adopted the idea that athletes foot was a product of modernity and that dealing with this disease was &quot;a penalty of civilization&quot; as many treatments proved ineffective. Antifungal properties of compounds such as undecylenic acid were studied in the 1940s; products containing zinc undecylenate were shown to be the most effective topical treatment for curing the condition. The use of orally ingested Griseofulvin was shown in the 1960s to be effective in acute cases of athlete&#x27;s foot. Likewise, recorded incidence of athletes foot decreased among American soldiers in Vietnam who were given Griseofulvins as a preventative drug. In the 1990s, research supported the use of itraconazole and the Allylamine known as terbinafine as drugs effective at eliminating athlete&#x27;s foot and also dermatophyte infections on other parts of the body. As of 2012, research has shown that terbinafine is 2.26 times as likely to cure athlete&#x27;s foot than treatment with Griseofulvin; comparative studies between itraconazole and terbinafine have shown little difference in effectiveness.

<text>New Hanover Island, (), also called Lavongai, is a large volcanic island in the New Ireland Province of Papua New Guinea. This region is part of the Bismarck Archipelago and lies at . Measuring some , it had a population of 5,000 in 1960, which increased to approximately 17,160 by 2000.

In the interior the Tirpitz Range reaches a height of 2,800 feet.

==Culture==
Friedrich Ratzel in &quot;The History of Mankind&quot; reported in 1896, when discussing Melanesian ornament, that there were luxurious feather ornament displays in New Hanover, showing much taste in the combination of forms and colours with vegetable fibres and beads on sticks. An example was a delicately formed face in feather-mosaic forming the head of a hairpin.

<text>Rodolphe Adada (born 24 April 1946) is a Congolese politician and diplomat. During the single-party rule of the Congolese Labour Party (PCT), he served in the government of Congo-Brazzaville as Minister of Mines and Energy from 1977 to 1984, as Minister of Mines and Oil from 1984 to 1989, and as Minister of Secondary and Higher Education from 1989 to 1991. Later, he was Minister of Foreign Affairs under President Denis Sassou Nguesso from 1997 to 2007 and Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the African Union for Darfur from 2007 to 2009. He returned to the government of Congo-Brazzaville in 2009, serving as Minister of State for Industrial Development from 2009 to 2012, and as Minister of State for Transport from 2012 to 2016. He has been Ambassador to France since 2016.

==Political career==
Adada, an ethnic Mbochi, was born in Gamboma, French Congo on 24 April 1946. He obtained a doctorate in mathematics from France in the early 1970s. He was a mathematician by profession and elected to the Central Committee of the PCT in 1972. In January 1976, he became the head of the newly created scientific research department and member of the state council, with the rank of cabinet minister. Under Joachim Yhombi-Opango, he was appointed as Minister of Mines and Energy in the government named on 5 April 1977. He remained in the government under Sassou Nguesso, who took power in 1979. He remained in his post as Minister of Mines and Energy until 1984, when he was instead appointed as Minister of Mines and Oil. In the government named on 13 August 1989, he was moved to the position of Minister of Secondary and Higher Education, in charge of Scientific Research; he remained in that position until 1991. With the fall of Sassou Nguesso regime, he went into exile in France in 1992 and returned in 1997.

After Sassou Nguesso returned to power in October 1997, he appointed Adada as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation on 2 November 1997. In the May 2002 parliamentary election, Adada was elected to the National Assembly as the PCT candidate in the first constituency of Ouenzé, the fifth &quot;arrondissement&quot; of Brazzaville; he won the seat in the first round with 67.46% of the vote. After the election, he retained his post as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Cooperation, and La Francophonie in the government appointed on 18 August 2002.

In March 2003, Adada visited Bangui in the wake of François Bozizé&#x27;s seizure of power in the Central African Republic. He met with Bozizé and effectively endorsed the takeover, saying that Bozizé was trustworthy because he had expressed a &quot;vision&quot; of &quot;openness&quot; and &quot;reconciliation&quot;. In doing so, Adada ignored the African Union&#x27;s official condemnation of the takeover.

Adada was to visit the People&#x27;s Republic of China on behalf of Congo-Brazzaville, as announced by the Chinese government on their Ministry of Foreign Affairs website on 16 March 2004. He was promoted to the rank of Minister of State for Foreign Affairs in the government named on 7 January 2005.

On 8 May 2007, Adada was named Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the African Union for Darfur, in which capacity he was in charge of the peacekeeping mission there. On 31 May, Basile Ikouébé was appointed to replace him as Foreign Minister.

Speaking to the United Nations Security Council on 27 April 2009, Adada said the violence in Darfur had been reduced to the point that the conflict there was &quot;low-intensity&quot;. This claim outraged many of those involved in the Darfur situation.

The United Nations–African Union peacekeeping mission, UNAMID, announced on 25 August 2009 that Adada was resigning from his post and that his resignation would take effect on 31 August. UNAMID&#x27;s deployment was characterized as &quot;slow and difficult&quot;, and Adada had faced some criticism from diplomats who argued he was not effective. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon praised Adada, writing to him that he had &quot;led UNAMID with distinction during its most challenging initial deployment phase and in an environment of unprecedented difficulty.&quot; Speaking to Agence France-Presse in an interview, Adada argued that he had been successful in his mission because massacres no were no longer occurring: &quot;I would like to be judged, for UNAMID to be judged, on the number of deaths in Darfur.&quot; He said that he resigned as a matter of &quot;personal choice&quot;. He reiterated his view that &quot;there is no more fighting on the ground&quot; and that continued violence was due to crime, not warfare. Adada also said that the Sudanese government had not fully cooperated with UNAMID, but that he had no choice but to work with the government, and he criticized the international community for not sending helicopters to UNAMID. Before he departed Sudan, he was awarded the Order of the Two Niles by Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir on 7 September 2009.

Shortly after Adada left his post in Darfur, Sassou Nguesso reappointed him to the Congolese government as Minister of State for Industrial Development and the Promotion of the Private Sector on 15 September 2009. At the PCT&#x27;s Sixth Extraordinary Congress, held in July 2011, Adada was elected to the PCT&#x27;s 51-member Political Bureau.

Following the July–August 2012 parliamentary election, Adada was moved to the post of Minister of State for Transport, Civil Aviation, and the Merchant Marine on 25 September 2012. While Adada was serving in that post, a plane crash occurred at the Maya-Maya Airport in Brazzaville on the evening of 30 November 2012, killing 32 people. Adada visited the scene on the morning after the crash. At an official tribute to the victims held on 10 December 2012, he said that the cause of the crash was being investigated. Adada was believed to be &quot;completely marginalized&quot; by 2013, with matters falling under his ministerial portfolio effectively controlled by Jean-Jacques Bouya.

During the campaign for the September 2014 local elections, Adada was dispatched to Niari Department to campaign for the PCT&#x27;s candidates there.

After Sassou Nguesso&#x27;s victory in the March 2016 presidential election, Adada was dismissed from the government on 30 April 2016. He was appointed as Ambassador to France in July 2016, replacing Henri Lopes, and presented his credentials to French President François Hollande on 9 November 2016.

<text>Sir John Bennet Lawes, 1st Baronet, FRS (28 December 1814 – 31 August 1900) was an English entrepreneur and agricultural scientist. He founded an experimental farm at his home at Rothamsted Manor that eventually became Rothamsted Research, where he developed a superphosphate that would mark the beginnings of the chemical fertilizer industry.

== Life ==
John Bennet Lawes was born at Rothamsted, Harpenden, Hertfordshire, on 28 December 1814, the only son of John Bennet Lawes, owner of the Rothamsted estate and lord of the manor of Rothamsted. His father died when he was eight years old, so he was brought up mostly by his mother Marianne. He was educated at Eton College and Brasenose College, Oxford, although he didn&#x27;t graduate. In 1822 , his father died and Lawes inherited Rothamsted.

Before leaving Oxford in 1832, Lawes had begun to interest himself in growing various medicinal plants on the Estates and started to experiment on the effects of various manures on plants growing in pots. A year or two later the experiments were extended to crops in the field in order to free farmers from relying on animals to produce fertilizer. In 1839, an ostrich belonging to him escaped Rothamsted and caused a bit of property damage, although the only person it hurt was the first one to try and capture it.

In 1842, he patented a manure formed by treating phosphates with sulphuric acid, and thus initiated the artificial manure industry. In the succeeding year he enlisted the services of Joseph Henry Gilbert, with whom he experimented for more than half a century in raising crops and feeding animals, activities which have rendered Rothamsted famous to scientific agriculturists. In 1854, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, which in 1867 bestowed a Royal Medal on Lawes and Gilbert jointly, and in 1882 he was awarded the title of baronet. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1883.

Lawes died on 31 August 1900 and Rothamsted Manor and Estates passed to his son Charles. He was buried in the churchyard of St Nicholas Church, Harpenden with his wife Caroline (née Fountaine), who predeceased him (1822- 29 November 1895). They had two children, Caroline Lawes &amp; Charles Bennet Lawes (3 October 1843 - 6 October 1911) Charles married Maria Amelia Rose Fountaine (related?) on 8 April 1869 at St George&#x27;s Church, Hanover Square, London. He became Sir Charles Bennet Lawes-Wittewronge 2nd Bt on the death of his father in 1900 (the name Witteronge was his grandmother&#x27;s maiden name)
== Legacy ==
In 1889, Lawes took measures to ensure the continued existence of the Rothamsted experimental farm by setting aside money solely for that purpose and so established The Lawes Agricultural Trust. Rothamsted Experimental Station is the oldest agricultural research facility in the world.

Sir John Lawes School in Harpenden, Herts is named after him.

The locality of Lawes, Queensland, in Australia is named after him. The main feature of that locality is the University of Queensland Gatton Campus which specialises in agriculture.

<text>Rasipuram Krishnaswami Laxman (24 October 1921 – 26 January 2015) was an Indian cartoonist, illustrator, and humorist. He was best known for his creation &quot;The Common Man&quot; and for his daily cartoon strip, &quot;You Said It&quot; in &quot;The Times of India&quot;, which started in 1951.

R. K. Laxman started his career as a part-time cartoonist, working mostly for local newspapers and magazines. While as a college student, he illustrated his older brother R. K. Narayan&#x27;s stories in &quot;The Hindu&quot;. His first full-time job was as a political cartoonist for &quot;The Free Press Journal&quot; in Mumbai. Later, he joined &quot;The Times of India&quot;, and became famous for &quot;The Common Man&quot; character, which turned out to be the turning point in Laxman&#x27;s life.

==Birth and childhood==
R. K. Laxman was born in Mysore in 1921 in a Tamil Hindu family. His father was a headmaster and Laxman was the youngest of eight children: six sons and two daughters. His elder brother was novelist R.K. Narayan. Laxman was known as &quot;Pied Piper of Delhi&quot;.

An ill-mannered student in school, he was often punished by his teachers for misbehaving. In his words, “I felt wretched in the classroom. I am convinced that school-learning is unnatural and bad for human beings.” His academic performance was poor, and it was in this time that his inclination to art blossomed.

Laxman was fascinated by the illustrations in magazines such as &quot;The Strand&quot;, &quot;Punch&quot;, &quot;Bystander&quot;, &quot;Wide World&quot; and &quot;Tit-Bits&quot;, before he had even begun to read. Soon, at three years old, he was drawing on his own, on the floors, walls and doors of his house and doodling caricatures of his teachers at school; praised by a teacher for his drawing of a peepal leaf, he began to think of himself as an artist in the making. Laxman notes in his autobiography, &quot;The Tunnel of Time&quot;:

At age nine, Laxman decided to be an artist. He would cycle around Mysore and observe the nature around him while looking for something to paint. Eventually, he found and studied illustrations in foreign magazines, and was influenced by other artists like Sir David Low (whose signature he misread as “cow” for a long time), a British cartoonist who appeared now and then in &quot;The Hindu&quot;. He then began to illustrate cartoons satirizing international names like Winston Churchill, Adolf Hitler, and Mahatma Gandhi, and found local papers that were willing to publish them. 

Laxman was the captain of his local &quot;Rough and Tough and Jolly&quot; cricket team and his antics inspired the stories &quot;Dodu the Money Maker&quot; and &quot;The Regal Cricket Club&quot; written by his brother, Narayan. Laxman&#x27;s idyllic childhood was shaken for a while when his father suffered a paralytic stroke and died around a year later, but the elders at home bore most of the increased responsibility, while Laxman continued with his schooling.

After high school Maharaja&#x27;s Govt. High School, Mysore, Laxman applied to the Sir J.J. Institute of Applied Art hoping to concentrate on his lifelong interests of drawing and painting, but the dean of the school wrote to him that his drawings lacked &quot;the kind of talent to qualify for enrolment in our institution as a student&quot;, and refused admission. He finally graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Mysore. In the meantime he continued his freelance artistic activities and contributed cartoons to &quot;Swarajya&quot; and an animated film based on the mythological character Narada.

==Career==
===Beginning===

R.K Laxman&#x27;s earliest work was for newspapers Rohan and magazines including &quot;Swarajya&quot; and &quot;Blitz&quot;. While still at the Maharaja College of Mysore, he began to illustrate his elder brother R. K. Narayan&#x27;s stories in &quot;The Hindu&quot;, and he drew political cartoons for the local newspapers and for the &quot;Swatantra&quot;. Laxman also drew cartoons for the Kannada humour magazine, &quot;Koravanji&quot; which was founded in 1942 by M. Shivaram who had a clinic in the Majestic area of Bangalore. He started this monthly magazine, dedicating it to humorous and satirical articles and cartoons. Shivaram himself was an eminent humourist in Kannada. He encouraged Laxman.
Laxman held a summer job at the Gemini Studios, Madras. His first full-time job was as a political cartoonist for &quot;The Free Press Journal&quot; in Mumbai, where Bal Thackeray was his cartoonist colleague. In 1951, Laxman joined &quot;The Times of India&quot;, Mumbai, beginning a career that spanned over fifty years. His &quot;Common Man&quot; character, featured in his pocket cartoons, is portrayed as a witness to the making of democracy. Anthropologist Ritu G. Khanduri notes, &quot;R. K. Laxman structures his cartoon-news through a plot about corruption and a set of characters. This news is visualized and circulates through the recurring figures of the mantri (minister), the Common Man and the trope of modernity symbolized by the airplane (2012: 304).&quot;

===Other creations===
Laxman also created a popular mascot for the Asian Paints Ltd group called &quot;Gattu&quot; in 1954. He also wrote a few novels, the first one of which was titled &quot;The Hotel Riviera&quot;. His cartoons have appeared in Hindi films such as &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. &#x27;55&quot; and a Tamil film &quot;Kamaraj&quot;. His creations also include the sketches drawn for the television adaptation of &quot;Malgudi Days&quot; which was written by his elder brother R. K. Narayan, directed by Shankar Nag, and a Konkan coast based Hindi sitcom, Wagle Ki Duniya. Laxman also drew caricatures of David Low, T. S. Eliot, Dr. Rajkumar, Bertrand Russell, J. B. Priestley and Graham Greene.

==Personal life==
Laxman was first married to Kumari Kamala, a Bharatanatyam dancer and film actress who began her film career as a child actress named &quot;Baby Kamala&quot; and graduated into adult roles under the name &quot;Kumari Kamala&quot; (&quot;Miss Kamala&quot;). They had no children and after their divorce in 1960 Laxman married his niece whose first name was again Kamala. She was the author and children&#x27;s book writer- Kamala Laxman. In a cartoon series named &quot;The star I never met&quot; in film magazine &quot;Filmfare&quot; he painted a cartoon of Kamala Laxman, with the title &quot;The star I only met!&quot; The couple&#x27;s son Srinivas Laxman is a Mumbai-based freelance space journalist who has contributed regularly to The Times of India.

In September 2003, Laxman suffered a stroke that left him paralysed on his left side. He recovered from it partially. On the evening of 20 June 2010, Laxman was admitted to Breach Candy Hospital in Mumbai after being transported by an air ambulance from Pune.

==Death==

Laxman died in Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital in Pune on India&#x27;s Republic Day in 2015 at the age of 93. He was hospitalised three days earlier for a urinary tract infection and chest problems that ultimately led to multiple organ failure. He had reportedly suffered multiple strokes since 2010. A cartoon that Laxman had made following the successful landing of Mangalyaan on Mars was posted by the Indian Space Research Organisation on its Facebook and Twitter pages on 27 January. Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis announced that Laxman would be accorded a state funeral and a memorial would be built in his honour. Laxman&#x27;s body was kept at the Symbiosis Institute&#x27;s Pune premises near the &quot;Common Man&quot; statue and his body was cremated at the Vaikunth crematorium.

<text>The &quot;Harry Potter&quot; fandom is the community of fans of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books and films who participate in entertainment activities that revolve around the series, such as reading and writing fan fiction, creating and soliciting fan art, engaging in role-playing games, socialising on &quot;Harry Potter&quot;-based forums, and more. The fandom interacts online as well as offline through activities such as fan conventions, participating in cosplay, tours of iconic landmarks relevant to the books and production of the films, and parties held for the midnight release of each book and film.

By the fourth &quot;Harry Potter&quot; book, the legions of fans had grown so large that considerable security measures were taken to ensure that no copy of book was leaked before the official release date. &quot;Harry Potter&quot; is considered one of the few four-quadrant, multi-generation spanning franchises that exist today, despite Rowling&#x27;s original marketing of the books to tweens and teens.

==Pottermania==

Pottermania is an informal term first used around 1999 describing the craze &quot;Harry Potter&quot; fans have had over the series. Fans held midnight parties to celebrate the release of the final four books at bookstores which stayed open on the night leading into the date of the release. In 2005, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; listed the midnight release of &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; as one of &quot;Entertainment&#x27;s Top Moments&quot; of the previous 25 years.

Diehard fans of the series are called &quot;Potterheads&quot;. Some even theme their weddings around &quot;Harry Potter&quot;. A Bridal Guide featured two real weddings soon before the release of the final film, which quickly spread through the fandom via Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr.
The craze over the series was referenced in Lauren Weisberger&#x27;s 2003 novel &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; as well as its 2006 film adaptation. In the story, the protagonist Andrea Sachs is ordered to retrieve two copies of the next instalment in the series for her boss&#x27;s twins before they are published so that they can be privately flown to France, where the twins and their mother are on holiday.

Some celebrity fans of &quot;Harry Potter&quot; include Lily Allen, Guillermo del Toro, Ariana Grande, Stephen King, Keira Knightley, Jennifer Lawrence, Evanna Lynch, Barack Obama, Simon Pegg, ASAP Rocky, Seth Rogen, Matt Smith, Jeremy Davis, Kellan Lutz, and Margot Robbie. Robert Pattinson said of the series, &quot;&quot;Harry Potter&quot; was what made me become an actor. I credit &quot;Harry Potter&quot; with everything else that&#x27;s come since for me. I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing before that.&quot;

==Fan sites==
There are many fan web sites about &quot;Harry Potter&quot; on the Internet, the oldest ones dating to about 1997 or 1998. One of the most famous sites allows fans of the book an opportunity to be sorted into a house themselves. J. K. Rowling has an open relationship with her fan base, and since 2004 periodically hands out a &quot;fan site award&quot; on her official web site. The first site to receive the award was Immeritus, a fan site mostly devoted to Sirius Black, and about which Rowling wrote, &quot;I am so proud of the fact that a character, whom I always liked very much, though he never appeared as much more than a brooding presence in the books, has gained a passionate fan-club.&quot;

In 2004, after Immeritus, Rowling bestowed the honour upon four sites. The first was Godric&#x27;s Hollow; for some time however, the site&#x27;s domain name was occupied by advertisers and its content was lost and there is no further record on Rowling&#x27;s site that Godric&#x27;s Hollow ever received the award, although in 2010 the website came back online again albeit with a lot of content missing. The next site was the Harry Potter Lexicon, an online encyclopedia Rowling has admitted to visiting while writing away from home rather than buying a copy of her books in a store. She called it &quot;for the dangerously obsessive; my natural home.&quot; The third site of 2004 was MuggleNet, a web site featuring the latest news in the Potter world, among editorials, forums, and a podcast. Rowling wrote when giving the award, &quot;It&#x27;s high time I paid homage to the mighty MuggleNet,&quot; and listed all the features she loved, including &quot;the pretty-much-exhaustive information on all books and films.&quot; The last site was HPANA, the first fan site Rowling ever visited, &quot;faster off the mark with Harry Potter news than any other site&quot; Rowling knows, and &quot;fantastically user-friendly.&quot;

In 2005, only The Leaky Cauldron was honoured. In Rowling&#x27;s words, &quot;it is about the worst kept secret on this website that I am a huge fan of The Leaky Cauldron,&quot; which she calls a &quot;wonderfully well designed mine of accurate information on all things Harry Potter.&quot; On another occasion, Rowling has called the Leaky Cauldron her &quot;favourite fan site.&quot; In 2006, the Brazilian website Potterish was the only site honoured, in recognition of its &quot;style, [its] Potter-expertise and [its] responsible reporting.&quot;

In May 2007, Harry Potter Fan Zone received the award. Rowling recognised the insightful editorials as well as praised the site for its young and dedicated staff. In December 2007, the award went to The Harry Potter Alliance, a campaign that seeks to end discrimination, genocide, poverty, AIDS, global warming, and other &quot;real-world Dark Arts&quot;, relating these problems to the books. Rowling called the project &quot;extraordinary&quot; and &quot;most inspirational&quot;, and paralleled its mission to &quot;the values for which Dumbledore&#x27;s Army fought in the books&quot;. In an article about her in &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Rowling expressed her gratefulness at the site&#x27;s successful work raising awareness and sign-up levels among anti-genocide coalitions.

At one time, Warner Bros., which owns the rights to &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and its affiliates, tried to shut down the sites. The unsuccessful attempt eventually led to their inviting the webmasters of the top sites to premieres of the films and tours of the film sets, because of their close connection with the fans. Warner Bros. executives have acknowledged that many fans are disappointed that certain elements of the books are left out, but not trying to avoid criticism, &quot;bringing the fan sites into the process is what we feel is really important.&quot;

These fan sites contain news updates into the world of the books, films, and film cast members through the use of forums, image galleries, or video galleries. They also host user-submitted creations, such as fan art or fan fiction.

===Podcasts===

The Harry Potter fandom has embraced podcasts as a regular, often weekly, insight to the latest discussion in the fandom. Apple Inc. has featured two of the podcasts, MuggleCast and PotterCast. Both have reached the top spot of iTunes podcast rankings and have been polled one of the top 50 favorite podcasts. At the 2006 Podcast Awards, when MuggleCast and PotterCast each received two nominations for the same two categories, the two podcasts teamed up and requested listeners vote for PotterCast in the Best Entertainment category and MuggleCast in the People&#x27;s Choice category. Both podcasts won these respective categories.

MuggleCast, hosted by MuggleNet staffers, was created in August 2005, not long after the release of &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;. Topics of the first show focused on Horcruxes, &quot;R.A.B.&quot;, the &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; film, which was due for release two months later, and the website DumbledoreIsNotDead.com. Since then, MuggleCast has held chapter-by-chapter discussions, character analyses, and a discussion on a &quot;theory of the week&quot;. MuggleCast has also added humour to their podcast with segments like &quot;Spy on Spartz,&quot; where the hosts would call MuggleNet webmaster Emerson Spartz and reveal his current location or activity with the listening audience. British staff member Jamie Lawrence tells a British joke of the week, and host Andrew Sims reads an email sent to MuggleNet with a strange request or incoherent talk (dubbed &quot;Huh?! Email of the Week&quot;). MuggleCast is currently the highest-rated &quot;Harry Potter&quot; podcast on the Internet.

PotterCast was released less than two weeks after MuggleCast&#x27;s first episode. Produced by The Leaky Cauldron, it differed from MuggleCast with a more structured program, including various segments and involvement of more people on the Leaky Cauldron staff compared to MuggleCast. It also was the first Potter podcast to produce regular interviews with people directly involved with the books and films. The first show featured interviews with Stuart Craig, art director of the films, as well as Bonnie Wright, who plays Ginny Weasley. PotterCast has also interviewed Matthew Lewis (the actor who portrays Neville Longbottom), Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood), Jamie Waylett (Vincent Crabbe), Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley), Chris Columbus, Alfonso Cuarón, Mike Newell (directors of the first four films), Arthur A. Levine and Cheryl Klein (editors of the books at Scholastic), and Rowling herself.

The two sites are friendly rivals and have aired several combined episodes, which they call &quot;The Leaky Mug&quot;, a separate podcast released on a separate feed from time to time. Live joint podcasts have been held in New York City, Las Vegas, and California. From time to time, hosts on one podcast will appear on their counterpart.

Other notable &quot;Harry Potter&quot; podcasts include:
* &quot;Harry Potter and the Sacred Text&quot;, in which the books are read as if they were a religious text;
* &quot;Witch Please&quot;, which looks at the books through a feminist lens;
* &quot;Potterotica&quot;, in which actors read Harry Potter fan fiction aloud;
* &quot;Potterless&quot;, a comedy podcast in which an adult man reads the books for the first time and tries to predict future plot points;

==Fan fiction==

Rowling has backed fan fiction stories on the Internet, stories written by fans that involve Harry Potter or other characters in the books. A March 2007 study showed that &quot;Harry Potter&quot; is the most searched-for fan fiction subject online. Some fans will use canon established in the books to write stories of past and future events in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; world; others write stories that have little relation to the books other than the characters&#x27; names and the settings in which the fan fiction takes place. On FanFiction.Net, there are over 834,000, while Archive of Our Own has over 546,000 fan fictions on &quot;Harry Potter&quot; . There are numerous websites devoted solely to Harry Potter fan fiction. Of these, according to rankings on Alexa.com, HarryPotterFanfiction.com has grown to be the most popular.

A well-known work of fan fiction is The Shoebox Project, created by two LiveJournal users. Over 8500 people subscribed to the story so that they would be alerted when new posts update the story. The authors&#x27; works, including this project, were featured in an article in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; discussing the growth in popularity of fandoms.

The current most reviewed piece of fan fiction, with over 40,000 reviews, is &quot;All The Young Dudes&quot; by Archive of our Own user MsKingBean89. The work is the most-viewed piece of fan fiction on Archive of Our Own, with over 16,000,000 hits.

In 2006, the &quot;popular &#x27;bad&#x27; fanfic&quot; &quot;My Immortal&quot; was posted on FanFiction.Net by user &quot;Tara Gilesbie&quot;. It was deleted by the site&#x27;s administrators in 2008, but not before amassing over eight thousand negative reviews. It spawned a number of YouTube spoofs and a number of imitators created &quot;sequels&quot; claiming to be the original Tara.

In 2007, a web-based novel, &quot;James Potter and the Hall of Elders&#x27; Crossing&quot;, was written by a computer animator named George Lippert. The book was written as a supplement to fill the void after &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, and received eventual approval from Rowling herself.

Rowling has said, &quot;I find it very flattering that people love the characters that much.&quot; She has adopted a positive position on fan fiction, unlike authors such as Anne McCaffrey or Anne Rice who discourage fans from writing about their books and have asked sites like FanFiction.Net to remove all stories of their works, requests honored by the site. However, Rowling has been &quot;alarmed by pornographic or sexually explicit material clearly not meant for kids,&quot; according to Neil Blair, an attorney for her publisher. The attorneys have sent cease and desist letters to sites that host adult material.

Potter fan fiction has a large following in the slash fiction genre, stories which feature sexual relationships that do not exist in the books (&quot;shipping&quot;), often portraying homosexual pairings. Famous pairings include Harry with Draco Malfoy or Cedric Diggory, and Remus Lupin with Sirius Black. Harry Potter slash has eroded some of the antipathy towards underage sexuality in the wider slash fandom.

Tracey &quot;T&quot; Proctor, a moderator of FictionAlley.org, a &quot;Harry Potter&quot; fan fiction website, said &#x27;I don&#x27;t really get into the children&#x27;s aspect of it, but rather the teachers, the adult characters. I read someone once who said, &quot;If she didn&#x27;t want us fantasizing about her characters, she needs to stop having these handsome men portraying them.&quot; And that&#x27;s the truth: It&#x27;s very hard not to look at Alan Rickman [Professor Severus Snape] and Jason Isaacs [Lucius Malfoy] and not get erotic thoughts. I have some fan fiction at Fiction Alley. You want to write stories about the characters that J.K. is not writing, about their love lives that you don&#x27;t see in the book.&#x27;

In November 2006, Jason Isaacs, who played Lucius Malfoy in the &quot;Potter&quot; films, said that he had read fan fiction about his character and gets &quot;a huge kick out of the more far-out stuff.&quot;

===Discussion===
Prior to the publication of &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, much of the energy of the Potter fandom was devoted to speculation and debate about upcoming plot and character developments. To this end, clues from the earlier books and deliberate hints from J. K. Rowling (in interviews and on her website) were heavily scrutinised by fans. In particular, fan essays were published on websites such as Mugglenet (the &quot;world famous editorials&quot;), the Harry Potter Lexicon and The Leaky Cauldron (Scribbulus project) among others: offering theories, comment and analysis on all aspects of the series. The Yahoo discussion list Harry Potter for Grown Ups (founded in 1999) is also noteworthy for its detailed criticism and discussion of the Harry Potter books.

Speculation intensified with the July 2005 publication of &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot; and the detailed post-publication interview given by Rowling to Mugglenet and The Leaky Cauldron. Notably, DumbledoreIsNotDead.com sought to understand the events of the sixth book in a different way. (Rowling later confirmed, however – on 2 August 2006 – that Dumbledore was, in fact, dead, humorously apologising to the website as she did so.) A collection of essays, &quot;Who Killed Albus Dumbledore?: What Really Happened in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince? Six Expert Harry Potter Detectives Examine the Evidence&quot;, was published by Zossima Press in November 2006. Contributors included the Christian author John Granger and Joyce Odell of Red Hen Publications, whose own website contains numerous essays on the Potterverse and fandom itself.

In 2006, in advance of the arrival of the seventh Potter novel, five MuggleNet staff members co-authored the reference book &quot;Mugglenet.Com&#x27;s What Will Happen in Harry Potter 7: Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Falls in Love and How Will the Adventure Finally End&quot;, an anthology of unofficial fan predictions; while early in 2007, Leaky launched HarryPotterSeven.com, featuring &quot;roundups and predictions from some of the most knowledgeable fans online&quot; (including Steve Vander Ark of the Lexicon). Late additions to the fan scene (prior to the publication of &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;) included BeyondHogwarts.com (the successor to DumbledoreIsNotDead.com), which billed itself as &quot;the only ongoing online Harry Potter fan conference&quot;, as well as Book7.co.uk, which offered a hypothetical &quot;evidence-based synopsis&quot; of the seventh novel. To this day, debate and reaction to the novels and films continues on web forums (including Mugglenet&#x27;s Chamber of Secrets community and TLC&#x27;s Leaky Lounge).

==Fan film and television==

A 2018 Italian fan-made prequel to the series, &quot;&quot;, depicts the story of Tom Riddle&#x27;s rise to power. The teaser trailer was released on in June 2017, receiving exceeded thirty million views in less than 48 hours on Facebook. The full movie was later released on YouTube on 13 January 2018, receiving over twelve million views in ten days.

&quot;Hermione Granger and the Quarter Life Crisis&quot; is an online TV series focused on Hermione Granger&#x27;s life after Hogwarts. In the show, Granger, cast as a black woman played by Ashley Romans, has broken up with Ron Weasley and moved to Los Angeles to reevaluate her life and choices.

A 2020 Vulture Works&#x27; fan-made film, &quot;James Potter and the Heir of the Sword&quot;, starts with the epilogue of &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;. Jealous of the relationship between Scorpius Malfoy and Albus Severus Potter, Albus&#x27; brother James is in conflict with Scorpius to be the best brother, while the prophecy of King Arthur&#x27;s Monster, which occurs every 100 years, hits Hogwarts. 

==Conventions==

Fan conventions have been another way that the fandom has congregated. Conventions such as Prophecy, LeakyCon, Infinitus, Azkatraz, and Ascendio have maintained an academic emphasis, hosting professional keynote speakers as well as keeping the atmosphere playful and friendly. They have featured prominent members of the fandom such as Jennie Levine, owner of SugarQuill.net (Phoenix Rising, 2007); Melissa Anelli, current webmaster of The Leaky Cauldron (Phoenix Rising, 2007; Leakycon, 2009/2011/2012); Sue Upton, former Senior Editor of the Leaky Cauldron (Prophecy, 2007); Heidi Tandy, founder of Fiction Alley (Prophecy, 2007), Paul and Joe DeGeorge of the wizard rock band Harry and the Potters (along with several other more well-known Wizard Rock bands such as The Remus Lupins, The Parselmouths, Ministry of Magic, and The Whomping Willows) (see below) (Prophecy, 2007; Leakycon, 2009/2011/2012), Andrew Slack, founder of The Harry Potter Alliance, and StarKid, the cast of the fan made musicals &quot;A Very Potter Musical&quot;, &quot;A Very Potter Sequel&quot;, and &quot;A Very Potter Senior Year&quot;.

Still, the conventions try to attract the fandom with other fun-filled &quot;Potter&quot;-centric activities, often more interactive, such as wizarding chess, water Quidditch, a showing of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films, or local cultural immersions. Live podcasts are often recorded during these events, and live Wizard Rock shows have become a fairly large part of recent conventions. Members of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; cast have been brought in for the conferences; actors such as Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood) and Christopher Rankin (Percy Weasley), along with several others, have appeared to give live Q&amp;A sessions and keynote presentations about the series.

In addition to fandom-specific programming, LeakyCon 2011 and 2012 have hosted LitDays (as well as incorporating the many fandoms &quot;Harry Potter&quot; fans have branched into since the ending of the series). LitDays are full of programming with authors, agents, and editors. A few key examples are John Green, author of the young adult novels &quot;The Fault in Our Stars&quot; and &quot;Looking for Alaska&quot;; Scott Westerfeld, author of the &quot;Uglies&quot; series and &quot;Leviathan&quot;; and David Levithan, author of &quot;Nick &amp; Norah&#x27;s Infinite Playlist&quot; and &quot;The Lover&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;.

These conventions are now incorporating the recently opened theme park The Wizarding World of Harry Potter into their itinerary, built inside Universal&#x27;s Island of Adventure in Orlando, Florida. At the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; fan conventions Infinitus 2010, LeakyCon 2011, and Ascendio 2012, special events were held at the theme park dedicated to the series. These are after-hours events for convention attendees who purchased tickets to experience and explore the park by themselves. The event included talks given by creators of the park, free food and butterbeer, and live wizard rock shows inside the park.

==Festivals==
In addition to conventions, Harry Potter fandom has further expanded to town festivals, including the Chestertown Harry Potter Festival (Maryland), the Chestnut Hill Harry Potter Festival (Philadelphia), Edgerton&#x27;s Harry Potter Festival (Wisconsin), and the Spellbound Festival (Michigan, 2016; Ontario, 2018; New York, 2019), among others. The Chestnut Hill event had been held annually for seven years until 2018 when it was rebranded under a more general &quot;Witches and Wizards&quot; theme, following a cease and desist letter from Warner Bros.

==&quot;Ship debates&quot;==

In the fandom, the word &quot;ship&quot; and its derivatives like &quot;shipping&quot; or &quot;shipper&quot; are commonly used as shorthand for the word &quot;relationship&quot;. The &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series generated ship debates with supporters of the prospective relationship between Harry Potter and his close female friend Hermione Granger at odds with supporters of Hermione ending up instead with Ron Weasley, close friend of both, as well as supporters of Harry ending up with Ginny Weasley, Ron&#x27;s younger sister.

An interview with Rowling conducted by fansite webmasters Emerson Spartz (MuggleNet) and Melissa Anelli (The Leaky Cauldron) shortly after the book&#x27;s release proved to be controversial. During the interview, Spartz commented that Harry/Hermione shippers were &quot;delusional&quot;, to which Rowling chuckled, though making it clear that she did not share the sentiment and that the Harry/Hermione fans were &quot;still valued members of her readership&quot;. This incident resulted in an uproar among Harry/Hermione shippers. The uproar was loud enough to merit an article in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;.

Rowling&#x27;s attitude towards the shipping phenomenon has varied between amused and bewildered to frustrated, as she revealed in that interview. She explained:

In a later posting on MuggleNet, Spartz explained:

Rowling has continued to make references, less humorous and more, to the severity of the shipper conflicts. In one instance she has joked about trying to think of ways of proving to Emerson, when inviting him for the aforementioned interview, that it was really her and not &quot;some angry Harry/Hermione shipper trying to lure him down a dark alleyway&quot;;

Rowling stated in a 2014 interview with &quot;Wonderland&quot; magazine that she thought that realistically Ron and Hermione had &quot;too much fundamental incompatibility.&quot; She stated that Ron and Hermione were written together &quot;as a form of wish fulfillment&quot; as way to reconcile a relationship she herself was once in. She went on to say that perhaps with marriage counselling Ron and Hermione would have been all right. She also went on to say in a talk at Exeter University that Harry&#x27;s love for Ginny is true, thereby denying any potential canon relationship between Harry and Hermione.

===Other relationships===
On a less intense scale, other relationships have been doted upon in the fandom from suggestive hints or explicit statements throughout canon, such as those between Draco Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson, Harry&#x27;s parents James Potter and Lily Evans, Rubeus Hagrid and Olympe Maxime, or Percy Weasley and Penelope Clearwater, or Rose Granger-Weasley and Scorpius Malfoy. A potential relationship between Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood was originally dispelled by Rowling, though she later retracted this and said she noticed a slight attraction between them in &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;.

Some couples, besides Harry and Ginny and Ron and Hermione, have been explicitly stated in the series: Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour are married in &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; after dating throughout &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;. In &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;, Nymphadora Tonks keeps her feelings for Remus Lupin to herself, but remains depressed when he refuses her advances; he feels that his being a werewolf would not create a safe relationship. Tonks professes her love for him at the end of the book, and she and Lupin have been married by the beginning of &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; and have a son &#x27;Teddy&#x27; later in the book. Other couples, such as Harry and Draco or Lupin and Sirius Black, are favourites among fans who read fan fiction about them. There is also debate about Lily and Severus vs. James.

==Roleplaying games==

Roleplaying is a central feature of the Harry Potter fandom. There are two primary forms: internet-based roleplay and live-action roleplay, or LARP.

LARPing often involves re-enacting or creating an original Quidditch team. Match rules and style of play vary among fandom events, but they are generally kept as close as possible to the sport envisioned by Rowling. The 2006 Lumos symposium included a Quidditch tournament played in water. More common are ground-based games such as the handball style developed by USA Team Handball and featured at the MuggleNet-sponsored &quot;Spellbound&quot; event, as well as the Muggle Quidditch style played intramurally at Millikin University (at left). This version of quidditch has grown past intramural play, is far from LARPing, and has an international governing body, the IQA.

Internet-based roleplay tries to simulate the Hogwarts experience. Many sites are forum-based, emphasizing taking classes taught by staff members in order for the players to earn points for their respective houses. Some internet-based roleplay sites go more in depth into canon and storylines, and do not specifically rely on posting as the only method for gaining house points while others have expanded to include activities such as Quidditch, dueling, and board-wide plots. Hogwarts-school.net (est. 2000), for example, is a forum-based roleplaying game which allows players to take classes, engage in extracurriculars, and also has many options for adult characters in St. Mungos, the Daily Prophet, and the Ministry of Magic.

2007 saw the launch of World of Hogwarts, a completely free MMORPG Harry Potter roleplaying game in Second Life, set ten years after the Battle of Hogwarts. Here, roleplayers can create an avatar and interact with other students, attend lessons organized by other roleplayers, play Quidditch, sit for their exams, earn and lose points for their house, visit Hogsmeade, Diagon Alley and the Forbidden Forest, get a job at the Ministry of Magic, explore several secret passages within the castle, and even immerse themselves into intricate and well-composed storyline plots that have, through time, grown into the canon rules of the game.

A website created by ISO Interactive, called the Chamber of Chat is a free online interactive virtual world under a MMO format. Although not a full MMORPG format, Chamber of Chat is set up with 3D virtual chatrooms and avatars where fans can socially interact with each other in Pictionary and Harry Potter Trivial games or participate in discussion groups about Harry Potter or Film media or perform plays as a theater group to other fans as audience. They hold special community event such as Harry Potters Birthday or Halloween and have seasonal house competitions. Fans are able to create their own avatars, collect or be rewarded coins to purchase furniture items for their own &quot;clubhouse&quot;. However, the website emphasizes more social interaction between fans&#x27; avatars to stimulate the Hogwarts student experience. &quot;Chamber of Chat is a graphical Social Virtual World with a few Facebook plug-ins. The Harry Potter Virtual World is designed for fans. This give users the feeling that they are interacting in the actual 3D world. You can hang out with other students, relax in the common room, mingle at the pub, play games like Pictionary and even download cool looking wallpapers.&quot;

On 19 April 2007, Chamber of Chat was awarded Adobe Site of the day. Chamber of chat has also been awarded a place among the SmartFoxServer Showcase. &quot;Chamber of Chat is an MMO community inspired to the magic worlds of the Harry Potter saga. The application is a great example of integration between Director/Shockwave (client) and SmartFoxServer PRO.&quot;. Chamber of Chat has been a long time associated branch of The Leaky network and although as part of the network with The Leaky Cauldron, Pottercast and &quot;Ask Peeves&quot; search engine, it was ranked number two behind Indiana Jones&#x27;s TheRaider.Net out of 25 essential fansites of &quot;The Best of the Web&quot; by Entertainment Weekly in December 2007.

Other sites use modified versions of phpBB that allow for a certain level of interactive roleplaying and are what is commonly referred to as &quot;forum-based roleplaying&quot;. Interactive gaming can include player versus player features, a form of currency for making purchases in stores, and non-player characters such as monsters that must be fought to gain levels and experience points. However, these features are more prevalent in games that are not forum-based. Advancement in such games is usually dependent on live chat, multiplayer cooperation, and fighting as opposed to taking classes or simply posting to earn points for one&#x27;s &quot;house&quot;; like at Hogwarts, players in forum-based games are sometimes sorted into a different group distinguishing different values within a person.

==Landmarks tours==

Some travel agencies have organised a subdivision to create tours specifically highlighting iconic landmarks in the world of &quot;Harry Potter&quot;. HP Fan Trips, offered by Beyond Boundaries Travel since 2004 in conjunction with fan site HPANA, was designed by and for fans of the series, and tours noteworthy &quot;Potter&quot;-related locations in the United Kingdom. Since 2004, they have exclusively chartered steam locomotive #5972 Olton Hall, the locomotive used in the films as the Hogwarts Express, as well as the carriages labeled as such and seen in the movies. The travel agency Your Man in Europe began hosting Magical Tours in 2006, in conjunction with fan site MuggleNet. They offer four different tours through England and Scotland.
These tours primarily feature locations used for shooting in the films, though some trips include a Chinese restaurant in Edinburgh, which was once Nicholson&#x27;s Cafe, where Rowling wrote much of the manuscript for &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, and Edinburgh Castle, where Rowling read from the sixth book on the night of its release to an audience of children. Filming locations visited include Alnwick Castle, where some exterior locations of Hogwarts are shot, places in Fort William, Scotland; Glen Nevis, Scotland; the Glenfinnan viaduct; Christ Church Cathedral in Oxford and the Cloisters located within New College, Oxford.

==Wizard rock==
Wizard music (sometimes shorthanded as Wrock) is a musical movement dating from 2000 in Massachusetts with Harry and the Potters, though it has grown internationally and has expanded to at least 750 bands. Wrock bands mostly consist of young musicians that write and perform songs about the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; universe, and these songs are often written from the point of view of a particular character in the books, usually the character who features in the band&#x27;s name. If they are performing live, they may also cosplay, or dress as, that character.

In contrast to mainstream bands that have some songs incorporating literary references among a wider repertoire of music (notably Led Zeppelin to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;), wizard rock bands take their inspiration entirely from the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; universe. In preserving the promotion of reading, too, bands like to perform in libraries, bookstores, and schools. The bands have also performed at the fan conventions.

==Documentaries==
===&quot;We Are Wizards&quot;===
We Are Wizards is a feature-length documentary by Josh Koury about the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; fandom. It features Wizard rock bands Harry and the Potters, Draco and the Malfoys, The Hungarian Horntails, and The Whomping Willows. The film also features Heather Lawver, Melissa Anelli, and Brad Neely. &quot;We Are Wizards&quot; had its World Premiere at the SXSW film festival in 2008, then traveled to 20 film festivals worldwide. The film opened theatrically in 5 cities on 14 November 2008. The film can be seen on Hulu.com, and DVD.

===&quot;The Fandom Fan Diaries: Wizard&#x27;s Gone W!ld&quot;===
The Fandom Fan Diaries: Wizard&#x27;s Gone W!ld is a documentary web series that is based on fandom submissions. The producers Miranda Marshall and Amy Henderson starting accepting video submissions in early March 2009 and plan to accept them through 2013. &quot;WiZarDs Gone W!LD&quot; is affiliated with &quot;The Fan Book of HP Fans&quot;, yet another fandom project based on submissions that has recently extended its submission deadline date.

===&quot;The Wizard Rockumentary&quot;===
The Wizard Rockumentary: A Movie about Rocking and Rowling is a feature documentary chronicling the rise of Harry Potter tribute bands. Producers Megan and Mallory Schuyler travelled around the United States compiling interviews and concert footage of bands including Harry and the Potters, Draco and the Malfoys, The Remus Lupins, The Whomping Willow, The Moaning Myrtles, Roonil Wazlib, Snidget, and The Hermione Crookshanks Experience. The film was released in April 2008 and has screened in libraries around the country. The producers are currently negotiating broadcast and home video rights.

===&quot;Proyecto Patronus&quot;===
Project Patronus: Magic of a Generation (&quot;Proyecto Patronus: la magia de una generación&quot;) is a Spanish documentary based on the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; franchise. It covers the franchise&#x27;s influence on a generation of young people, and deals with the multiple values, such as friendship, love, courage and respect, which are reflected in the books. Numerous professionals in psychology and pedagogy who have studied the significance of the franchise appear. The film was released in 2016 and has screened in film festivals around Spain.

==Health==
In 2003, Dr. Howard J. Bennett coined the term &quot;Hogwarts headache&quot; in a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine shortly after the release of the longest book in the series, &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot;. He described it as a mild condition, a tension headache possibly accompanied by neck or wrist pains, caused by unhealthily long reading sessions of &quot;Harry Potter&quot;. The symptoms resolved themselves within days of finishing the book. His prescription of taking reading breaks was rejected by two of the patients on which he discovered this headache.

Researchers at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford found in 2005 that the admission rate of children with traumatic injuries to the city&#x27;s ERs plummeted on the publication weekends of both &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot; and &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;. This was due to the volume of children reading Harry Potter rather than engaging in riskier outdoor activities, such as riding of bicycles and scooters, climbing trees or playing sports. The study was led by Dr. Stephen Gwilym whose paper &quot;hypothesized that there is a place for a committee of safety-conscious, talented writers who could produce high quality books for the purpose of injury prevention,&quot; noting a potential problem with this strategy: &quot;Obviously, if children are always in reading books and not outside getting exercise, there is a long-term risk of obesity, rickets and lack of sunlight.&quot;

<doc id="906496" wikidata="Q1051127" url="?curid=906496" title="Nl (Unix)">
<text>nl is a Unix utility for numbering lines, either from a file or from standard input, reproducing output on standard output.

== History ==
 is part of the X/Open Portability Guide since issue 2 of 1987. It was inherited into the first version of POSIX.1 and the Single Unix Specification. It first appeared in System V release 2.

The version of codice_1 bundled in GNU coreutils was written by Scott Bartram and David MacKenzie.

The command is available as a separate package for Microsoft Windows as part of the UnxUtils collection of native Win32 ports of common GNU Unix-like utilities.

==Syntax==
The command has a number of switches:

*a - number all lines
*t - number lines with printable text only
*n - no line numbering
*string - number only those lines containing the regular expression defined in the &quot;string&quot; supplied.

The default applied switch is &quot;t&quot;.

nl also supports some command line options.

==Example==

 $ nl tf
 1 echo press cr
 2 read cr
 3 done

The following example numbers only the lines that begin with a capital letter A (matching on the regular expression /^A/). &quot;filename&quot; is optional.

$ nl -b p^A filename
 apple
 1 Apple
 BANANA
 2 Allspice
 strawberry

It can be useful as an alternative to :

$ cat somefile
aaaa
bbbb
cccc
dddc
$ nl somefile | grep cccc
 3 cccc

<text>Kuafu () is a giant in Chinese mythology who wished to capture the Sun. He was a grandson of Houtu.

==Story==
One day, Kuafu decided to chase and catch the Sun. He followed the Sun from the East to the West, draining the Yellow River and the Wei River (all rivers and lakes crossing his path) to quench his burning thirst. However, the big rivers were also unable to quench his thirst, and as he searched for more water, he eventually died of dehydration. The wooden club he was carrying grew into a vast forest of peach trees called the Deng Forest ().

In one version, Kuafu turns into a mountain range. This mountain range and the peach forest are said to be located in present day Lingbao.

In modern Chinese usage, the story of Kuafu chasing the Sun () is used to describe a person who is brave and optimistic and willing to overcome all the obstacles to reach the goal.

==Tribe==
&quot;Kuafu&quot; can also be taken to refer to his people, the Kuafu-shi () or &quot;Clan of Kuafu&quot;. Since &quot;shi&quot; can mean both &quot;clan&quot; and &quot;maiden name&quot;, as well as serving as a masculine honorific like &quot;mister&quot; or &quot;sir&quot;, it is sometimes used in reference to his people or the individual.

During the battle of Banquan, Chi You&#x27;s tribes allied themselves with the Kuafu tribe and the &quot;Sanmiao&quot; () tribe and attacked the Yan Emperor&#x27;s tribe, driving them into the lands of the Yellow Emperor.

<doc id="906506" wikidata="Q28658" url="?curid=906506" title="John Fisher Burns">
<text>John Fisher Burns (born 4 October 1944) is a British journalist, and the winner of two Pulitzer Prizes. He was the London bureau chief for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, where he covered international issues until March 2015. Burns also frequently appears on PBS. He has been called &quot;the dean of American foreign correspondents.&quot;

==Life and career==
From 1998 to 1999, he was a visiting fellow at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, studying Islamic history and culture.
He also speaks French and German. His father was a South African who served in the Royal Air Force.

In the early 1970s, Burns wrote for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; of Canada, as a local and later parliamentary reporter. During this stint, Burns completed a master&#x27;s in political science at McGill University. He was sent to China in 1971 to be one of a few Western journalists in China during the Cultural Revolution, after a confusion that led to his brief ban from the precincts of the Parliament of Canada by the Commons Speaker. Burns joined &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1975, reporting, at first, for the paper&#x27;s metropolitan section, and has written ever since for the newspaper in various capacities.

He has been assigned to and headed several of the &quot;Times&quot; foreign bureaus. He and fellow &quot;Times&quot; journalists John Darnton and Michael T. Kaufman won the 1978 George Polk Award for foreign reporting for coverage of Africa. Burns was the &quot;Times&quot; bureau chief in Moscow from 1981 to 1984. In 1986, while chief of the &quot;Times&quot; Beijing bureau, Burns was incarcerated on suspicion of espionage by the Chinese government. Charges were dropped after an investigation, but Burns was subsequently expelled from the country.

Burns was awarded the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting citing &quot;his courageous and thorough coverage of the destruction of Sarajevo and the barbarous killings in the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina&quot;.

In the early to mid-1990s, Burns headed the New York Times&#x27; bureau in New Delhi, with responsibility for the Indian Subcontinent and adjoining regions, from Afghanistan to Burma. He and his family resided in New Delhi though Burns was frequently on the road, travelling regularly to Kabul, Islamabad, Dhaka, Colombo and Kathmandu. He actively covered events in Afghanistan, which led to his second Pulitzer in 1997, this time &quot;For his courageous and insightful coverage of the harrowing regime imposed on Afghanistan by the Taliban&quot;. Burns was based in Baghdad during the lead up to the Iraq war in 2003 and has written extensively on the war and the subsequent occupation. In the run-up to U.S. invasion, Burns wrote pro-invasion pieces.

 In July 2007, Burns succeeded Alan Cowell as bureau chief in London. On 30 September 2007, Burns received the Elijah Parish Lovejoy Award as well as an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Colby College.

In an October 2008 interview with the Russian Ambassador to Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, Burns accused Kabulov of being a KGB operative.

Burns is a frequent contributor to PBS, including a number of appearances on the &quot;Charlie Rose show&quot; and &quot;The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer&quot; via satellite from Afghanistan and Iraq. In a January 2009 interview, Michael Barone called Burns &quot;one of the great foreign correspondents of our time&quot;. In an August 2010 interview with Charlie Rose, Christopher Hitchens, while recounting a tour of Sarajevo guided by Burns in which they were fired upon, called Burns &quot;the greatest war correspondent of our time&quot;.

On 26 March 2015, The New York Times announced that an article about the burial of Richard III would conclude Burns&#x27;s career at the New York Times.

==Personal life==
Burns married Jane Peque Gnat in 1972. The couple divorced in 1989. In 1991, Burns married Jane Scott-Long, who manages the New York Times Baghdad bureau. Burns has two children from his first marriage, Jamie and Emily, and one stepchild, Toby, from his second marriage.

<text>A water block is the watercooling equivalent of a heatsink. It is a type of plate heat exchanger and can be used on many different computer components, including the central processing unit (CPU), GPU, PPU, and northbridge chipset on the motherboard. There are also Monoblocks on the market that are mounted on PC motherboards and cover the CPU and its power delivery VRMs (Voltage Regulator Modules) that surround the CPU socket area. It consists of at least two main parts; the &quot;base&quot;, which is the area that makes contact with the device being cooled and is usually manufactured from metals with high thermal conductivity such as aluminum or copper. The second part, the &quot;top&quot; ensures the water is contained safely inside the water block and has connections that allow hosing to connect it with the water cooling loop. The top can be made of the same metal as the base, transparent Perspex, Delrin, Nylon, or HDPE. Most newer high-end water blocks also contain mid-plates which serve to add jet tubes, nozzles, and other flow altering devices.

The base, top, and mid-plate(s) are sealed together to form a &quot;block&quot; with some sort of path for water to flow through. The ends of the path have inlet/outlet connectors for the tubing that connects it to the rest of the watercooling system. Early designs included spiral, zig-zag pattern or heatsink like fins to allow the largest possible surface area for heat to transfer from the device being cooled to the water. These designs generally were used because the conjecture was that maximum flow was required for high performance. Trial and error and the evolution of water block design has shown that trading flow for turbulence can often improve performance. The Storm series of water blocks is an example of this. Its jet tube mid plate and cupped base design makes it more restrictive to the flow of water than early maze designs but the increased turbulence results in a large increase in performance. Newer designs include &quot;pin&quot; style blocks, &quot;jet cup&quot; blocks, further refined maze designs, micro-fin designs, and variations on these designs. Increasingly restrictive designs have only been possible because of increases in maximum head pressure of commercially viable water pumps.

A water block is better at dissipating heat than an air-cooled heatsink due to water&#x27;s higher specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity. The water is usually pumped through to a radiator which allows a fan pushing air through it to take the heat created from the device and expel it into the air. A radiator is more efficient than a standard CPU or GPU heatsink/air cooler at removing heat because it has a much larger surface area.

Installation of a water block is also similar to that of a heatsink, with a thermal pad or thermal grease placed between it and the device being cooled to aid in heat conduction.

<doc id="906517" wikidata="Q1428090" url="?curid=906517" title="Sicilian Defence, Najdorf Variation">
<text>The Najdorf Variation ( ) of the Sicilian Defence is one of the most popular, reputable, and deeply studied of all chess openings. &quot;Modern Chess Openings&quot; calls it the &quot;Cadillac&quot; or &quot;Rolls-Royce&quot; of chess openings. The opening is named after the Polish-Argentine grandmaster Miguel Najdorf, although he was not the first strong player to play the variation. Many players have relied on the Najdorf (notably Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov, although Kasparov would often transpose into a Scheveningen).

The Najdorf begins:

:1. 
:2. 
:3. 
:4. 
:5. 

Black&#x27;s 5...a6 aims to deny the b5-square to White&#x27;s knights and light-square bishop while maintaining flexible . If Black plays 5...e5 immediately, then after 6.Bb5+ Bd7 (or 6...Nbd7 7.Nf5) 7.Bxd7+ Nbxd7 (or Qxd7) 8.Nf5, the knight on f5 is difficult to dislodge without concessions. Games in the Najdorf frequently feature opposite-side castling, where White and both sides launch simultaneous attacks on their opponents&#x27; kings.

Black usually plans a to pressure White&#x27;s e4-pawn. This is often carried out by means of ...b5, ...Bb7, and placing a knight on d5, or c4 via b6.
== History and development ==
Players began experimenting with 5...a6 in the 1920s, often transposing to the Scheveningen after a subsequent ...e6. The Czech chess master Karel Opočenský was among the first to combine 5...a6 with ...e5, and in an attempt to have the variation named after him, claimed to have shown it to Miguel Najdorf himself. However, Najdorf was a stronger player and, with the help of other strong Argentine players in the 1950s, deepened the analysis of the opening. He played it as early as 1937.it was Miguel who realized that in this position the move 5...a6 was always useful for Black. If it is not played on the fifth move it will be played on the seventh or the fourteenth. So then, being a practical person, he thought &#x27;if you have to do something at 7:00AM or at 9:00 or at 10:00, better do it as soon as you get up, and get it over with&#x27;.Ironically, Najdorf would abandon the variation later when the theory developed to become very sophisticated:&quot;Here comes some kid who&#x27;s memorized the moves and he kills me. He arrives with his books, he gets me into something I don&#x27;t know and Najdorf dies at the hands of the Najdorf Variation.&quot; So from then on he played something else. A Ruy Lopez as Black, something classic in which the other had to know how to play chess to beat him.6.Bg5 is an aggressive attempt by White to refute the opening and was regarded as the main line until the 1980s when its use began to decline. Bobby Fischer, who called the Najdorf &quot;one of the greatest creations in chess theory&quot;, favoured the Lipnitzky/Fischer Attack (6.Bc4) for much of his career. He won numerous games with it as White, though in the following years counterattacking approaches were found for Black that led to its decline, though a modern variation (7...Nbd7) caused a resurgence and it appeared in the 1993 PCA World Championship match between Garry Kasparov and Nigel Short. Anatoly Karpov faced the Najdorf many times with the white pieces, and frequently opted for the Classical/Opočenský Variation (6.Be2) (inspired by Efim Geller, who acted as Karpov’s second). The Classical Variation aims to castle kingside for a more positional game, which suited Karpov&#x27;s style. He contributed both to the theory and the popularity of the variation while at his peak, finding ways to exploit the weakness of the d5-square created by the Black&#x27;s move 6...e5. Garry Kasparov would often transpose to the Scheveningen (6...e6) to avoid this problem when the two competed for the World Championships. In the 1980s and 1990s, a number of English players (John Nunn, Nigel Short, and Murray Chandler) began using an approach previously tried against other Sicilian variations, such as the Dragon. The English Attack, named for them, involves 6.Be3, and often leads to opposite-side castling with both sides launching a simultaneous pawn storm on opposite sides of the board. This approach has become the modern mainline and is seen regularly at the highest level.

== Variations ==

=== 6.Bg5 ===

==== Classical Main line: 6...e6 ====
The main move. In the early days of the Najdorf 7.Qf3 was popular, but the reply 7...h6 did not allow White to obtain any advantage. Nowadays, White players almost universally respond with the move: 7.f4. White threatens 8.e5, but Black has several options:
*7...Be7 8.Qf3 and now:
**8...Qc7 9.0-0-0 Nbd7, this is called the old main line. At this point White usually responds with 10.g4 or 10.Bd3. After each of these moves there is a huge body of opening theory.
**8...h6 9.Bh4 g5. This is known as the Argentine/Goteborg Variation. It was first played in round 14 of 1955 Goteborg Interzonal simultaneously by Argentine players Panno, Pilnik, and Najdorf who were facing the Soviet grandmasters Geller, Spassky, and Keres. The games in question proceeded as follows: 10.fxg5 Nfd7 (Black aims to route a knight to e5, and then back it up by a knight at d7 or c6) 11.Nxe6 (Efim Geller&#x27;s discovery) 11...fxe6 12.Qh5+ Kf8 13.Bb5. Here Panno played 13...Ne5, while Pilnik and Najdorf chose 13...Kg7; however, all three Argentine players lost in very short order and the line was, for a while, considered refuted. In 1958 Bobby Fischer played 13...Rh7!, versus Svetozar Gligorić at the Portorož Interzonal, in a critical last-round game. According to modern opening theory, this position is a draw at best for White. A 10,000 node analysis by Leela Lc0 departs from this line with 11.Bg3. Black can route the knight as intended 11...Ne5. White blockades the h-pawn 12.Qh5. Black can take the g5-pawn, leading to a knights exchange 12...Bxg5 13.Nf3 Nxf3 14.Qxf3.
*7...Qb6 one of the most popular choices at master level.
**8.Qd2 the extremely complicated Poisoned Pawn Variation: 8...Qxb2 9.Rb1 (9.Nb3 is the other less common option) 9...Qa3 and here White has played both 10.f5 and 10.e5. Both lead to extremely sharp play where the slightest inaccuracy is fatal for either side. Since 2006, when it was played in several high-level games, 10.e5 has become very popular. From the standpoint of the theory, it is regarded as White&#x27;s only attempt to play for a win against the Poisoned Pawn Variation since all other variations (and that includes the other pawn move, 10.f5) have been analysed to a draw with the best play. An example is a game Vallejo Pons–Kasparov, Moscow 2004, which was called &quot;a model modern grandmaster draw!&quot; by Kasparov himself in &quot;Revolution in the 70s&quot; (page 164).
**8.Nb3 White opts for a quiet game, but Black has nothing to worry about: 8...Be7 9.Qf3 Nbd7 10.0-0-0 Qc7 where we have reached a set-up very similar to that of the old main line mentioned above. Without the d4-knight, however, White will find it very hard to organize an attack.
**8.Qd3 is a modified version of the Poisoned Pawn Variation, often played to pose different challenges from what an opponent might be used to after Qd2. After 8...Qxb2 9.Rb1 Qa3, a key point is that the queen on d3 allows for future potential discovered attacks on Black&#x27;s queen. It is less popular than Qd2, however, as the queen covers more useful squares on d2. 
**8.a3 is a more challenging reply for White. It protects the pawn indirectly as 8...Qxb2 is met by 9.Na4! winning the queen. Black usually plays 8...Nc6, although 8...Nbd7 is also playable. The 8.a3 line has been seen several times at the grandmaster level recently.
*7...b5 the ultra-sharp Polugaevsky Variation. Black ignores White&#x27;s threat and expands on the queenside. 8.e5 dxe5 9.fxe5 Qc7 here White either plays 10.exf6 Qe5+ 11.Be2 Qxg5 or 10.Qe2 Nfd7 11.0-0-0 Bb7.
*7...Qc7 championed by Garry Kasparov before he switched to playing 7...Qb6 exclusively.
*7...Nbd7 popularised by Boris Gelfand.
*7...Nc6?! is risky and of a dubious theoretical reputation due to the response: 8.e5!
*7...h6!? the Poisoned Pawn Deferred. The line 8.Bh4 Qb6 9.a3 was played twice in the 2016 London Chess Classic (Caruana–Nakamura and Nakamura–Vachier-Lagrave), though White won both games.

==== 6...Nbd7 ====

Historically speaking, this was the usual reply until the mid-1960s, when the rejoinder 7.Bc4 put the move &quot;out of business&quot;. Recently, however, the line has seen a resurgence in high-level play. The idea for Black is to postpone ...e6 to retain more dynamic options (for example, to play ...e7–e5 in one move).
The most important developments include:
*7.Bc4 Qb6 This is a move introduced by Leinier Dominguez. The idea is to win a tempo by attacking b2, after which Black can finish his development beginning 8...e6. The last word on the line has not yet been given. The whole variation with 6...Nbd7 is covered in the book by Ľubomír Ftáčnik in the chapter &quot;Blood Diamond&quot;.
*7.f4 Qc7 8.Qf3:
**8...h6 9.Bh4 e5. The idea is to gain time over ...e6 by playing ...e7–e5 in one move. Later on it turned out that 9...g5! is even better. (This variation is covered by Ufuk Tuncer and Twan Burg in New In Chess, &quot;Yearbook 102&quot;.)
**8...b5. With the idea of fianchettoing the bishop to b7. (The variation is covered by Ufuk Tuncer in New In Chess, &quot;Yearbook 101&quot;.)
*7...g6 is another modern way to meet both 7.f4 and 7.Qe2. The idea is to castle kingside rapidly and then start to attack with ...b5–b4, while wasting no time with the e-pawn.

=== English Attack: 6.Be3 ===
This has become the modern main line. Since the early 1990s, the English Attack, 6.Be3 followed by f3, g4, Qd2 and 0-0-0 in some order, has become extremely popular and has been intensively analysed. Four lines are then usual for Black:

* The classical 6...e5:
**If White plays 7.Nb3, then Black usually continues 7...Be6, trying to control the d5-square. The most common move is then 8.f3, allowing White to play Qd2 next move. If White had tried to play 8.Qd2, then Black could respond with 8...Ng4. 
**But if White plays 7.Nf3, then Black&#x27;s main choices are 7...Be7 and 7...Qc7.

* Trying to transpose to the Scheveningen by playing 6...e6. White can either opt for the standard English Attack by playing 7.f3 or try the even sharper Hungarian Attack (also known as Perenyi Attack) by playing 7.g4. Black can revert to 7...e5, attempting to show that moving the g-pawn has created an overextension for White. After 8.Nf5 g6 9.g5 the game is dynamically balanced.

* The knight move: 6...Ng4. White continues: 7.Bg5 h6 8.Bh4 g5 9.Bg3 Bg7, but the nature of this position is quite different from the ones arising after 6...e6 and 6...e5, so sometimes White tries to avoid the knight jump by playing 6.f3 instead of 6.Be3. However, aside from eliminating the option to play the Hungarian Attack mentioned above, it gives Black other possibilities such as 6...Qb6 and 6...b5.

* 6...Nbd7. The objective of this move is to get into the English Attack while avoiding the Perenyi Attack. 7.g4 is less dangerous now because with 6...Nbd7 Black is more flexible as the bishop on c8 can attack g4 now and the knight on d7 can jump to interesting squares.

=== Fischer–Sozin/Lipnitzky Attack: 6.Bc4 ===
Introduced by Veniamin Sozin in the 1930s, this received little attention until Fischer regularly adopted it, and it was a frequent guest at the top level through the 1970s. White plays 6.Bc4 with the idea of playing against f7, so Black usually counters with 6...e6 7.Bb3 b5. The Sozin has become less popular because of 7...Nbd7 where Black intends to follow up with ...Nc5 later. It is possible to avoid the 7...Nbd7 option with 7.0-0, but this cuts out the aggressive possibility of castling long.

=== Classical/Opočenský Variation: 6.Be2 ===
Because of the success of various players with these variations, White often plays 6.Be2 and goes for a quieter, more positional game, whereupon Black has the option of transposing into a Scheveningen Variation by playing 6...e6 or keeping the game in Najdorf lines by playing 6...e5. Another option is to play 6...Nbd7.

=== Amsterdam Variation: 6.f4 ===

Some lines include:
*6...e5 7.Nf3 Nbd7 8.a4 Be7 9.Bd3 0-0
*6...Qc7 7.Bd3
*6...e6 7.Be2

GM Daniel King recommends 6...g6 against the Amsterdam Variation, leading to a more defensive kingside pawn structure. The idea is to eventually counterattack on the g1–a7 diagonal with a move like ...Qb6, preventing White from castling. An example line would be 6...g6 7.Nf3 Bg7 8.a4 Nc6 (note 8...Nc6 as opposed to the usual Najdorf ...Nbd7, as c6 is a more flexible square for the knight with a queen on b6) 9.Bd3 Qb6.

=== Adams Attack: 6.h3 ===
Introduced by Weaver Adams during the middle of the twentieth century, this odd-looking pawn move has mostly been used as a surprise weapon to combat the Najdorf. Should Black continue with 6...e5 anyway, White can respond with 7.Nde2 following up with g4 and Ng3, fighting for the weak light squares by playing g5. It is thus recommended that Black prevents g4 altogether with 7...h5.

Black can also employ a Scheveningen set-up with 6...e6 followed by 7.g4 b5 8.Bg2 Bb7, forcing White to lose more time by defending the e4-pawn, since ...b4 is a threat. It was not until early 2008 that an answer to Black was finally found. After 9.0-0 b4, White has the positional sacrifice 10.Nd5!, which gives Black long-term weaknesses and an open e-file for White to play on. Since then, it has been popular on all levels of play.

=== Other sixth moves for White ===
A notable feature of the Najdorf is the sheer amount of potential white replies - Grandmasters have played 22 different responses to 5...a6. Beside the main lines mentioned above, 6.f3, 6.g3, and 6.a4 are also respected responses to the Najdorf. Moves such as 6.Bd3, 6.Qf3, 6.Rg1 (the Petronic Attack), 6.Nb3, 6.a3, 6.h4, 6.Qe2, 6.Qf3, and 6.Qd3 are rarely played, but are not considered bad and may be used for surprise value. Other very rare moves include 6.g4, 6.Nf3, 6.b3, 6.Qd2, and 6.Bd2.

== Notable games ==
*Shakhriyar Mamedyarov vs. Boris Gelfand. 0–1. Candidates (2011), Kazan. Fischer-Sozin Attack: Flank Variation. After various sacrifices, Gelfand has six extra pawns for a rook.
*Sergey Karjakin vs. Viswanathan Anand. 0–1. Corus Group A (2006), Wijk aan Zee. English Attack. Anand sacrifices a knight and a bishop and Karjakin resigns with checkmate unstoppable.
*Michael Adams vs. Garry Kasparov. 0–1. Linares (2005). English Attack. Both players attack simultaneously and Kasparov claimed later that it was important to let his opponent think he was winning.
*Wolfgang Unzicker vs. Robert James Fischer. 0–1. Varna Olympiad Final-A (1962). Classical/Opočenský Variation. A nineteen-year-old Fischer outplays his opponent in a more positional line.

<text>Brian Spillett GC (21 July 1937 – 16 January 1965) was posthumously awarded the George Cross, the highest British (and Commonwealth) award for bravery out of combat. Spillett died of burns he received while trying to save a neighbour in Lodge Crescent, Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire in Chase Farm Hospital in Enfield. He was a Territorial Army Lance-Bombardier in P Battery, 289 Parachute Light Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery and in civilian life worked as a fitter. His George Cross was announced in a supplement to the London Gazette of 25 June 1965, and dated 29 June 1965.
The &quot;London Gazette&quot; citation describes how Spillett became aware that there was a fire at a neighbouring house where three generations of a family lived. Spillett arrived, still only partly dressed, to learn that the father Mr Palmer of the family was still in the house. The whole house was already well alight, but he went in despite being held back by other neighbours. He managed to fight his way upstairs but was unable to get through to the trapped man. He himself became trapped and had to escape the flames by jumping from a first floor window. Once the fire was over, he was found in the garden of a neighbour after crawling down the garden, through the alley and thinking he was crawling to his own back door to his wife, ended up at the back door of a neighbour, badly burned and with other serious injuries, from jumping and falling through the leanto. He was taken to hospital but died a week later. He was survived by a young wife Jean and four-month-old daughter, Jacqueline Spillett.

<text>Science and Industry is a multiplayer, teamplay mod for the video game &quot;Half-Life&quot;. It is one of the oldest &quot;Half-Life&quot; mods and has been described as a classic mod. The current version of the game is 1.4 beta 14, released on January 19, 2019. The game was first publicly released on July 31, 1999, as version 0.94.

== Gameplay ==
Players assume the role of a security guard for one of two fictional corporations Amalgamated Fluorodynamics (AFD) and Midland Carbide Labs (MCL).

The main objective on the standard map type is to capture enemy scientists (who are non-player characters) while defending your own. This is accomplished by locating your enemies research labs, hitting one of the scientists there over the head with your briefcase and then taking him back to your company&#x27;s administrator.

Additional scientists increase the rate of a company&#x27;s income which can be considered the team&#x27;s score.

Scientists also research new weapons, implants, armor upgrades and devices for their company. Each time a new technology is completed, players vote for the next one to be researched.

Players spawn in the &quot;Cloning Facilities&quot; of their company, where they can find weapons and ammo crates, as well as health and armor chargers. At the start of the game, the only weapons available are a briefcase and a pistol, but this arsenal grows bigger as new weapons are researched by the scientists. Players decide which technology to research next by voting for it. The available technologies are divided in 5 branches: Weapons, Armor, Implants, Devices and Process Upgrades.

Players decide to either defend their company or attack the other company. Attacking consists mainly of reaching the other company&#x27;s laboratories, grabbing a scientist by knocking him out with the briefcase, and carrying back to the administrator. If a player dies while carrying a scientist, the scientist stays on the ground unconscious for a limited amount of time before teleporting back to his laboratories. During that time the original carrier or one of his teammates can pick up the scientist again. Some maps feature alternative objectives such as stealing resources (discs, biospecimen) or breaking computers. Defending requires protecting the company&#x27;s laboratories, this is usually done by defending key areas (entries to the laboratories), killing intruders, and defending unconscious scientists.

===Objectives===
A standard game lasts 30 minutes. The company with the most money at the end wins.

The main way to earn money is to have more scientists than the enemy. Each company starts with three scientists, so a company is making more money than the enemy corporation if it employs at least 4 scientists. So the team with more scientists wins.

Some maps feature other objectives than capturing and protecting scientists. A first kind of alternative objective is breakables: these are computers or machinery that can be broken and cost money to replace. A second kind of alternative objective is resources: these are computer discs or research specimen that can be stolen and give a cash bonus.

Players also cost money to their company each time they die, since cloning them back to life is not free.

==Reception==

&quot;Science and Industry&quot; has received praise for the quality of its maps and unique weapons, but with some criticism over patchy online play.

<doc id="906538" wikidata="Q335657" url="?curid=906538" title="William Onslow, 4th Earl of Onslow">
<text>William Hillier Onslow, 4th Earl of Onslow, (7 March 1853 – 23 October 1911), was a British Conservative politician. He held several governmental positions between 1880 and 1905 and was also Governor of New Zealand between 1889 and 1892.

==Background and education==
Born at Old Alresford, Hampshire, Onslow was the only son of George Augustus Cranley Onslow, son of Thomas Cranley Onslow, second son of Thomas Onslow, 2nd Earl of Onslow. His mother was Mary Harriet Anne Loftus. In 1870, at the age of 17, he succeeded his great-uncle in the earldom of Onslow. He was educated at Eton and Exeter College, Oxford.

==Political career, 1880–1889==
Onslow briefly served as a Lord-in-waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) under the Earl of Beaconsfield (Benjamin Disraeli) between February and April 1880 and held the same position under Lord Salisbury between 1886 and 1887, and later served under Salisbury as Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies between 1887 and 1888 (in which post he was vice president of the first Colonial Conference in April 1887) and as Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade between 1888 and 1889.

==Governor of New Zealand, 1889–1892==
In November 1888 Onslow was appointed Governor of New Zealand. As a result of the economic downturn in the late 1880s, he had sought a salaried position as a colonial governor. At 35, he was the youngest governor of New Zealand since George Grey was appointed in 1845 and the first since Robert FitzRoy in 1843 to have no previous experience in a vice-regal position. The New Zealand government had recently cut allowances for the governor, and Onslow was able to obtain the position mainly as it was no longer attractive to more senior colonial administrators.

He assumed the office on 2 May 1889. Shortly after his arrival in Wellington, there was an outbreak of typhoid fever in the town. Onslow&#x27;s twelve-year-old son and heir, Viscount Cranley, caught the disease and was at one time seen to be in danger of his life. After this Onslow and his family avoided the capital as much as they could - which did not endear them to the New Zealand people. According to the &quot;Dictionary of New Zealand Biography&quot;, Onslow did not &quot;have the flair or flamboyance which helped some later governors win popular support&quot;.

In 1890 Onslow became embroiled in controversy over appointments to the Legislative Council (the upper house of the New Zealand parliament), which were made by the governor on the advice of his ministers. Up until then Prime Minister Harry Atkinson had not made any recommendations on appointments. However, this year Atkinson&#x27;s conservative supporters became more and more concerned that the Liberals under John Ballance would gain power. Atkinson was put under pressure to assure that there was a conservative majority in the council. Onslow, as a Conservative, is considered to have been sympathetic to the idea, especially as he was used to the system in Britain, where it was acceptable practice for an outgoing British government to nominate new members of the House of Lords. He informed Atkinson that a &quot;little list&quot; of nominations for the Legislative Council could be agreed upon and used &quot;if things go wrong with you in the House or Country&quot;.

Atkinson lost ground in the election of December 1890, although it was unclear if the Liberals under Ballance would get enough support to form an administration. Rumours of the &quot;little list&quot; began to spread and Onslow was made aware that, even if it was common practice for an outgoing government in Britain to nominate members for the House of Lords, this was not the case in New Zealand. However, despite public opposition, Onslow followed Atkinson&#x27;s recommendations and nominated six people to the council (although the number was reduced from eleven). He justified his decision to the Colonial Office in London on the basis that he could find no Royal instruction or colonial precedent for refusing Atkinson&#x27;s nomination and referred to &quot;the constant practice in England&quot;. Onslow&#x27;s actions even further damaged the reputation of the council. Several independent members were pressed to support Ballance, who was able to form an administration.

In 1891 Ballance asked Onslow to nominate 18 representatives to the council in order to counterbalance Atkinson&#x27;s nominations of the previous year. Onslow said he was unwilling to alter the composition of the council and replace the conservative majority with a liberal one, stating that in his view an upper house of parliament should always be conservative in its nature. He agreed to nominate eight representatives, a compromise Ballance declined. The matter was finally deferred to Onslow&#x27;s successor, the Earl of Glasgow. Onslow resigned in February 1892 and returned to England.

==Political career, 1892–1911==
When the Conservatives returned to power in 1895 under Lord Salisbury, Onslow was made Under-Secretary of State for India, a post he retained until 1900, and was then once again Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies between 1900 and 1903 (from 1902 to 1903 under the premiership of Arthur Balfour). In 1903 he entered Balfour&#x27;s cabinet as President of the Board of Agriculture and was sworn of the Privy Council the same year. He remained at the Board of Agriculture until the government fell in 1905. From 1905 to 1911 he was Lord Chairman of Committees of the House of Lords. He was also President of the Royal Statistical Society from 1905 to 1906. His death was considered a loss to the [RSPB].

==Family==

Lord Onslow married The Hon. Florence Coulston Gardner, daughter of Alan Gardner, 3rd Baron Gardner, in 1875. They had two sons and two daughters:

* Lady Dorothy Evelyn Augusta Onslow, married Edward Frederick Lindley Wood (later Baron Irwin and Earl of Halifax) on 21 September 1909.
* Richard William Alan Onslow, 5th Earl of Onslow (23 August 1876 – 9 June 1945), married Violet Marcia Catherine Warwick Bampfylde, the only daughter of Coplestone Bampfylde, 3rd Baron Poltimore, on 22 February 1906.
* Lady Gwendolen Florence Mary Onslow (22 July 1881 – 16 February 1966), married Rupert Edward Cecil Lee Guinness (later Earl of Iveagh).
* Victor Alexander Herbert Huia Onslow (13 November 1890 – 27 June 1922), married Muriel Wheldale on 3 February 1919. He was the first child of a governor to be born in the country; hence the Māori name &quot;Huia&quot;. He suffered a spinal accident when he dived into an Austrian lake in the Dolomites on 16 July 1911.

Lord Onslow died at Hendon, Middlesex, in October 1911, aged 58. He was succeeded in the earldom by his elder son, Richard. The Dowager Countess of Onslow died in August 1934.

<text>is a public high school located in Meirinchō, Uwajima, Ehime, Shikoku, Japan established in 1945 as the .
==Overview==
Established in 1945, Ehime Prefectural Uwajima Fisheries High School has produced a large number of alumni. The school was established on April 12, 1945 as an Ehime Prefectural Fisheries School with a capacity of 50 people. The school is the only fishery high school in Ehime Prefecture in Uwajima-shi, an area known for its production of Pagrus aquaculture and pearl aquaculture.

==&quot;Ehime Maru&quot; and USS &quot;Greeneville&quot; collision==

The school operated the vessel &quot;Ehime Maru&quot; (4th generation), which the USS &quot;Greenville&quot;, a U.S. Navy submarine, struck and sank on February 9, 2001 during the &quot;Ehime Maru&quot; and USS &quot;Greeneville&quot; collision.

The school acquired a new &quot;Ehime Maru&quot; (5th generation) ship with settlement money from the U.S. Navy. The new ship sailed to Hawaii in 2003. In Hawaii, the principal at the time of the disaster, Kazumitsu Joko (上甲 一光 &quot;Jōkō Kazumitsu&quot;), read a message from Moriyuki Kato (加戸 守行 &quot;Kato Moriyuki&quot;), the governor of Ehime Prefecture, addressed to the Hawaiian people.

<text>Charles Stewart (1729 – June 24, 1800) was an officer during the American Revolutionary War and a Continental Congressman.

==Early life==
Charles Stewart was born in 1729 in Gortlea, County Donegal, Ireland, to Robert Stewart, an Ulster Scots gentleman. His paternal grandfather, Charles Stewart, was an officer of dragoons and fought for William III of England at the Battle of the Boyne. Gortlea was given to his grandfather by William III for his war service. He emigrated to the United States in 1750 and pursued a career in agriculture. After 1763, he lived at Lansdown, his mansion in Landsdown, New Jersey.

==Personal life==
Stewart married Mary Oakley Johnston, daughter of Judge Samuel Johnston, who owned a large estate in Hunterdon County, New Jersey.

General Farrand Stewart Stranahan was his great-grandson. Another great-grandson was Charles Seaforth Stewart.

==Career==
Stewart was commissioned lieutenant colonel of militia in Hunterdon County, New Jersey on April 10, 1771, and commissioned colonel of a battalion of Minutemen on February 15, 1776. He served in four sessions of the Provincial Congress of New Jersey (1775–76).

After the outbreak of war, he was appointed commissary general of issues by the Continental Congress on June 18, 1777. Stewart later became a New Jersey delegate to the Second Continental Congress in 1784 and 1785.

==Death==
Stewart died June 24, 1800, at a farm he owned on Mt. Carmel (Coxe&#x27;s Hill) in Flemington. He is interred at the Bethlehem United Presbyterian Church Cemetery in Grandin.

<doc id="906547" wikidata="Q1680697" url="?curid=906547" title="James Lawrence">
<text>James Lawrence (October 1, 1781 – June 4, 1813) was an officer of the United States Navy. During the War of 1812, he commanded in a single-ship action against , commanded by Philip Broke. He is probably best known today for his last words, &quot;Don&#x27;t give up the ship!&quot;, uttered during the capture of the &quot;Chesapeake&quot;. The quotation is still a popular naval battle cry, and was invoked in Oliver Hazard Perry&#x27;s personal battle flag, adopted to commemorate his dead friend.

==Biography==
Lawrence was born on October 1, 1781, the son of John and Martha (Tallman) Lawrence, in Burlington, New Jersey, but raised in Woodbury. His mother died when he was an infant, and his Loyalist father fled to Canada during the American Revolution, leaving his half-sister to care for the young Lawrence. He attended Woodbury Academy. Though Lawrence studied law, he entered the United States Navy as a midshipman in 1798. Lawrence hailed from a New England family of English descent, as his first ancestor to the American Colonies was William Lawrence, sailing from Hertfordshire, England. 

During the Quasi-War with France, he served on and the frigate in the Caribbean. He was commissioned a lieutenant on April 6, 1802, and served aboard in the Mediterranean, taking part in a successful attack on enemy craft on June 2, 1803.

In February 1804, he was second in command during the expedition to destroy the captured frigate . Later in the conflict he commanded &quot;Enterprise&quot; and a gunboat in battles with the Tripolitans. He was also First Lieutenant of the frigate &quot;Adams&quot; and, in 1805, commanded the small &quot;Gunboat No. 6&quot; during a voyage across the Atlantic to North Africa.

Although Gunboats &quot;No. 2&quot; through &quot;10&quot; (minus &quot;No. 7&quot;) arrived in the Mediterranean too late to see action, they remained there with Commodore Rodgers&#x27;s squadron until summer 1806, at which time they sailed back to the United States. On June 12, 1805, &quot;Gunboat No. 6&quot; encountered a Royal Navy vessel that impressed three seamen.

Subsequently, Lieutenant Lawrence commanded the warships , and . In 1810, he also took part in trials of an experimental spar torpedo. Promoted to the rank of Master Commandant in November 1810, he took command of the sloop of war a year later and sailed her to Europe on a diplomatic mission. From the beginning of the War of 1812, Lawrence and &quot;Hornet&quot; cruised actively, capturing the privateer &quot;Dolphin&quot; in July 1812. Later in the year &quot;Hornet&quot; blockaded the British sloop at Bahia, Brazil, and on February 24, 1813 captured .

Upon his return to the United States in March, Lawrence learned of his promotion to captain. Two months later he took command of the frigate &quot;Chesapeake&quot;, then preparing for sea at Boston. He left port on June 1, 1813, and immediately engaged the blockading Royal Navy frigate &quot;Shannon&quot; in a fierce battle. Although slightly smaller, the British ship disabled &quot;Chesapeake&quot; with gunfire within the first few minutes. Captain Lawrence, mortally wounded by small arms fire, ordered his officers, &quot;Don&#x27;t give up the ship. Fight her till she sinks.&quot; or &quot;Tell the men to fire faster! Don&#x27;t give up the ship.&quot; Men carried him below, and his crew was overwhelmed by a British boarding party shortly afterward. James Lawrence died of his wounds on June 4, 1813, while his captors directed &quot;Chesapeake&quot; to Halifax, Nova Scotia.

After Lawrence&#x27;s death was reported to his friend and fellow officer Oliver Hazard Perry, he ordered a large blue battle ensign, stitched with the phrase &quot;DONT GIVE UP THE SHIP&quot; in bold white letters. The Perry Flag was displayed on his flagship during a victorious engagement against the British on Lake Erie in September 1813. The original flag is displayed in the Naval Academy Museum and a replica is displayed in Memorial Hall at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. A replica is also on view at Perry&#x27;s Victory and International Peace Memorial, on South Bass Island, Ohio.

Lawrence was buried with military honors at present-day CFB Halifax, Nova Scotia, but reinterred at Trinity Church Cemetery in New York City. He was survived by his wife, Julia (Montaudevert) Lawrence, who lived until 1865, and their two-year-old daughter, Mary Neill Lawrence. In 1838 Mary married a Navy officer, Lt. William Preston Griffin.

On July 4, 1813, Lawrence was posthumously elected to membership in the New York Society of the Cincinnati.

<text>ICCF numeric notation is the official chess notation system of the International Correspondence Chess Federation. The system was devised for use in international correspondence chess to avoid the potential confusion of using algebraic notation, as the chess pieces have different abbreviations depending on language.

In ICCF numeric notation, each square of the chessboard has a two-digit designation. The first digit is the number of the ; files are numbered 1 to 8 from left to right from White&#x27;s point of view. The second digit is the ; ranks are numbered 1 to 8 from nearest to farthest from White&#x27;s point of view. Each move is denoted by either four or five digits: the first two digits denote the square the moving piece leaves; the following two digits denote the square at which the moving piece arrives; and, where applicable, the fifth digit denotes the piece of promotion.

==Details==
In numeric notation, each square is designated with a two-digit number via a coordinate system. The first digit describes the file and the second digit the rank. Files are numbered 1 to 8 from White&#x27;s left to White&#x27;s right, and ranks are numbered 1 to 8 from White&#x27;s near side to White&#x27;s far side. A move is defined by pairing two square designations together, one for the starting square and one for the ending square. For example, the move that would be written &quot;1.e4&quot; in algebraic notation would be written &quot;1. 5254&quot; in numeric notation: the pawn starts from square 52 (file 5, rank 2) and moves to square 54 (file 5, rank 4). Numeric notation does not explicitly mark the type of moving piece, , or checks; every move is written as four digits unless resulting in promotion.

For promotion, a fifth digit is added to the move&#x27;s notation: 1 for queen, 2 for rook, 3 for bishop, and 4 for knight. For instance, a pawn on f7 moving to f8 and promoting to a rook would be written as &quot;67682&quot;. A variant four-digit notation where the ending rank is omitted (because it is always 8 for White and 1 for Black) also exists (e.g. &quot;6762&quot;); however, this is considered confusing and contradicts the standard.

Castling is written using the king&#x27;s start position and end position. Castling is written as &quot;5171&quot; for White and &quot;5878&quot; for Black, and castling is written as &quot;5131&quot; for White and &quot;5838&quot; for Black. The rook&#x27;s start and end positions are implied.

==History==
German professor J. W. D. Wildt of Göttingen devised numeric notation circa 1803. Johann Koch used the system 25 years later; the system is sometimes named after him. Ivan Savenkov supported its use in 1877, and it bears his name in Russia.

<text>William Sharpe (December 13, 1742 – July 1, 1818) was a lawyer, politician, American Revolution patriot, and a delegate to the Continental Congress from Rowan County, North Carolina, which became Iredell County in 1788.

==Early life==
Sharpe was born in Rock Church, Cecil County, Maryland, in 1742. He was the son of Thomas Sharp, Jr, and his wife, Elizabeth, of Maryland. He pursued classical studies and law. He was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina in 1763. He married Catherine Reese in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina on May 31, 1768. He moved to Rowan County, North Carolina in late 1768 or 1769. He lived in the area of Rowan County that became Iredell County in 1788.

==Career==
William Sharpe was a member of the Fourth Creek Congregation in Rowan County, North Carolina (near what became Statesville, North Carolina in 1789) and created a map of the church members in 1773. 
Sharpe was a member of the North Carolina Provincial Congress in 1775. Prior to the onset of the American Revolutionary War, he served on the Rowan County Committee of Safety.

During the war, he was an aide to General Griffith Rutherford of the Salisbury District Brigade in the Indian campaign in 1776. William was one of four commissioners appointed by Governor Caswell to form a treaty with the Indians in 1777. William served as Colonel commanding the 2nd Rowan County Regiment of the North Carolina militia from 1776-1777. When the 2nd Rowan County Regiment became the Burke County Regiment of militia, he served as its commander from 1777 to 1781. (Note there was another Captain William Sharpe, who served in the Rowan County Regiment from 1780 to 1781. The relation to Colonel William Sharpe is not known.)

Sharpe served as a delegate to the North Carolina constitutional convention in Halifax in 1776, and helped to frame the first constitution of the State. He was later appointed in 1779 as a delegate to the Continental Congress, 1779–1781, and elected to the North Carolina House of Representatives in 1781 and 1782.

Sharpe placed the first bill before the legislature of North Carolina to propose a publicly supported university in the state. This bill failed, but was taken up at the next seating of the legislature and was promoted by one of the state&#x27;s Revolutionary War leaders General William Richardson Davie. It subsequently passed in 1789, creating the University of North Carolina.

He died near Statesville, North Carolina on July 6, 1818 and is interred in Snow Creek Burying Ground.

<text>The Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) is a department of the state government of the U.S. state of Oregon responsible for systems of transportation. It was first established in 1969. It had been preceded by the Oregon State Highway Department which, along with the Oregon State Highway Commission, was created by an act of the Oregon Legislative Assembly in 1913. It works closely with the five-member Oregon Transportation Commission (the modern name of the Highway Commission) in managing the state&#x27;s transportation systems.

The Oregon Transportation Commission, formerly the Oregon State Highway Commission, is a five-member governor-appointed government agency that manages the state highways and other transportation in the U.S. state of Oregon, in conjunction with the Oregon Department of Transportation.

==Inception==

The first State Highway Commission was created on August 12, 1913, and was composed of Governor Oswald West, Secretary of State Ben W. Olcott and Treasurer Thomas B. Kay. On January 12, 1915, James Withycombe became Governor and replaced Oswald West on the commission. The 1917 Oregon Legislative Assembly redesigned the State Highway Commission, with citizens appointed to replace the elected officials.

The new commissioners held their first meeting on March 6, and the commission was then known as the Oregon Highway Division. As Oregon&#x27;s transportation needs started to grow, the division expanded and, in 1919, it employed their first State Bridge Engineer, Conde McCullough.

==Events==
By 1920, Oregon had of paved roads and of plank roads for a population of 783,389 and, by 1932, the work that had been started on the Oregon Coast Highway (also known as U.S. Route 101) in 1914 was completed, except for five bridges, which meant greater responsibility for the division. This work was complete when the construction of the bridges over the Yaquina, Alsea, Siuslaw, and Umpqua rivers and Coos Bay were completed, closing the last gaps in the highway. By 1940, the highway division was managing more than of state, market and country roads in Oregon, with nearly being hard-surfaced.

In 2018, the city government of Portland, Oregon and ODOT entered into an intergovernmental agreement in which the Portland city government takes over the cleanups of transient camps on ODOT right-of-way in select locations in Portland in exchange for payments from ODOT.

In 2019, ODOT installed boulders at five locations in Portland to deter transient camps around the freeways. The installations have received support from neighbors while criticized by homeless advocacy groups.

==Exploding whale incident==
On November 12, 1970, the department was tasked with disposing of a dead sperm whale that washed ashore on the beach near Florence. The department exploded the dead whale using half a ton of dynamite to blast it off the beach. Pieces of dead whale went everywhere including the beach, bystanders, a parking lot and a park, severely damaging at least one car. &quot;Willamette Week&quot; reports &quot;The decision to publicly dynamite an enormous mammal has become one of Oregon&#x27;s all-time most bizarre moments.&quot;

This became known as the &quot;exploding whale incident&quot;.

<doc id="906563" wikidata="Q2826927" url="?curid=906563" title="Agnes Mary Clerke">
<text>Agnes Mary Clerke (10 February 1842 – 20 January 1907) was an Irish astronomer and writer. She was born in Skibbereen, County Cork, Ireland, and died in London.

== Family ==
Agnes Clerke was the daughter of John William Clerke (c. 1814–1890) who was, at the time, a bank manager in Skibbereen, and his wife Catherine Mary Deasy (born circa 1819) whose father was a judge&#x27;s registrar. She had two siblings; her older sister, Ellen Mary (1840-1906) and her younger brother, Aubrey St. John (1843-1923). Her elder sister Ellen also wrote about astronomy. All of the Clerke children were entirely home schooled.

Catherine Clerke was educated at the Ursuline Convent school, and therefore placed a great deal of importance on the education of young girls.

== Life and work ==
Following in her father&#x27;s footsteps—while studying classics, he had also taken courses in astronomy—she developed an interest in astronomy from an early age. Using her father&#x27;s 4-inch telescope in her observations, she had begun to write a history of astronomy at the age of 15.

In 1861, aged 19, her family moved to Dublin, and in 1863 to Queenstown (present-day Cobh). At the age of 25, partly for health reasons together with her elder sister Ellen, she went to Italy where she stayed until 1877, chiefly at Florence, studying science, languages, and other subjects that would be useful in their later lives. In 1877, she settled in London.

Upon her return, she was able to get two articles written while she had been in Italy, &quot;Brigandage in Sicily&quot; and &quot;Copernicus in Italy&quot;, published in the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; of October 1877. This led to her being asked by Adam and Charles Black, publishers of the &quot;Review&quot;, who also published the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, to write biographies of a number of famous scientists for the ninth edition of the encyclopedia.

This led to a number of other commissions, including the publication of the article on astronomy for the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;.

During her career she wrote reviews of many books, including some written in French, German, Greek, or Italian. In 1885, she published her best known work, &quot;A Popular History of Astronomy during the Nineteenth Century&quot;. This book became commonly used for its discussion of the spectroscope.

In 1888 she spent three months at the observatory at the Cape of Good Hope.

In the autumn of 1890, Clerke and her brother Aubrey were founding members of the British Astronomical Association.

In 1893, Clerke was awarded the Actonian Prize of 100 guineas by the Royal Institution. As a member of the British Astronomical Association she attended its meetings regularly, as well as those of the Royal Astronomical Society. In 1903, with Margaret Lindsay Huggins, she was elected an honorary member of the Royal Astronomical Society, a rank previously held only by three other women, Caroline Herschel and Mary Somerville (in 1835), and Anne Sheepshanks (in 1862).

She died of pneumonia in 1907 at her home in South Kensington.

==Personal life==
Agnes and Ellen were devout Catholics all their lives. Neither ever married.

==Legacy==
The lunar crater Clerke is named after her.

In 2002, Mary Brück wrote &quot;Agnes Mary Clerke and the Rise of Astrophysics&quot;.

In 2017, the Royal Astronomical Society established the Agnes Clerke Medal for the History of Astronomy or Geophysics, which is awarded to individuals who have achieved outstanding research into the history of astronomy or geophysics. The first recipient was Clive Ruggles.

In 2022 Jessie Kennedy and the Celestial Quartet performed a concert in Skibbereen in honour of Clerke. The performance included songs specially composed by Jessie Kennedy and by Tess Leak, using words of Agnes and her sister, Ellen, and a cello trio, the Agnes Clerke Cello Trio, composed by Diana Llewellyn.

She also wrote 55 articles for the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;, mainly on subjects connected with astrophysics, and articles for the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; and the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, and several other periodicals. Her articles in the ninth edition (1875–89) of the &quot;Britannica&quot; included Galileo Galilei, Alexander von Humboldt, Johannes Kepler, Antoine Lavoisier and the zodiac.

Appointed to the committee of correspondence in 1774 and to the committee of observation in 1775, Smith also served in the Revolutionary War as deputy adjutant general to Generals Horatio Gates and Nathanael Greene.

In 1777, Smith was appointed by the Continental Congress to the naval board. That same year, Smith was chosen as a Maryland delegate to the Continental Congress.

He subsequently pursued a career as a merchant, and was then elected to the 1st United States Congress, serving in that capacity from March 4, 1789, until March 3, 1791.

Smith was subsequently appointed as the first auditor of the United States Treasury, and served in that post from July 16, 1791, to November 27, 1791. He then returned to local politics and was elected to the Maryland Senate in 1801.

<text>Famous in the Last Century is the twenty-fourth studio album by British rock band Status Quo, released in 2000. According to &quot;XS All Areas&quot; - band members Francis Rossi and Rick Parfitt&#x27;s duel 2004 autobiography - the idea to record a second covers album (following 1996&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot;) came from the band&#x27;s then-manager David Walker, who said they should celebrate the millennium with an album containing twenty of their favourite hits from the past century. &quot;Another bloody covers album!&quot; grumbled Rossi. &quot;We went along with it, as usual, but inside I felt like a fraud... for me it was the worst Quo album there had ever been - or ever will be!&quot;

&quot;We didn&#x27;t wanna do it,&quot; Rossi told &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine in 2002, &quot;but it sold. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll do another one.&quot; However, the band issued another covers album, &quot;Riffs&quot;, in 2003.

&quot;Famous in the Last Century&quot; reached No. 19 on the UK Albums Chart, a better position than the previous Quo album of mainly original material, &quot;Under the Influence&quot;. Two singles from it – &quot;Mony Mony&quot; and &quot;Old Time Rock and Roll&quot; – were minor hits.

Jeff Rich left the band after recording this album and was replaced by Matt Letley.

A DVD &amp; VHS of the same name was filmed at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire on 27 March 2000. It is a mimed performance of the album. The group did a live gig after the filming of the video, and a few tracks from it were released as B-sides.

<text>Major General Sir William George Gentry, (20 February 1899 – 13 October 1991) was a professional soldier in the New Zealand Military Forces who served during the Second World War. He was Chief of the General Staff of the New Zealand Military Forces from 1952 to 1955.

Born in 1899 in London, United Kingdom, Gentry&#x27;s family emigrated to New Zealand in 1910. He joined the New Zealand Military Forces in 1916 as a cadet. Following graduation from the Royal Military College in 1919, he was posted to the New Zealand Staff Corps and held a number of staff positions in New Zealand and abroad. He saw active service during the Second World War as part of the 2nd New Zealand Division, initially as a staff officer but later on as a brigade commander. After the cessation of hostilities in 1945 he held senior staff positions in the New Zealand Military Forces. From 1952 Gentry served as Chief of the General Staff until his retirement in 1955. He died in 1991 in Lower Hutt.

==Early life==
Gentry was born in London on 20 February 1899 to Frederick Gentry, a leather salesman, and his wife, Eliza . When he was 11 years old, his family emigrated to New Zealand, settling in Wellington. Educated at Wellington College, he was one of the limited number of New Zealand entrants in 1916 who enrolled in the Royal Military College at Duntroon in Australia.

==Military career==
Gentry graduated from Duntroon in 1919 and was posted to the New Zealand Staff Corps. He was seconded to the British Indian Army for two years, serving on the North-West Frontier during the Waziristan campaign and the Moplah rebellion. On returning to New Zealand, he held a number of staff positions in the Central Military District and was promoted to captain in 1926. In 1934 he was sent to England on attachment to the Corps of Royal Engineers for 18 months and also attended engineering courses. He then served at General Headquarters in Wellington as staff officer, Engineers, before returning to England to attend the Staff College at Camberley, graduating in 1939.

===Second World War===
Shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War, Gentry was promoted to major. He briefly served with the British Expeditionary Force in France before traveling to Egypt to join the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF). Promoted to lieutenant colonel, he served as assistant adjutant and quartermaster general of the 2nd New Zealand Division during the Battle of Greece. In the Battle of Crete he was acting general staff officer (GSO1) in the stead of Brigadier Keith Stewart, who was fulfilling an equivalent role with Creforce. Gentry performed his duties competently and was in the 1942 New Year Honours appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his services during this time. He was also, much later, awarded the Greek Military Cross.

In October 1941, after the departure of Stewart to take up the position of Deputy Chief of Staff in New Zealand, Gentry became GSO1 of the 2nd New Zealand Division. In this role, he served under Major-General Bernard Freyberg, who commanded the division, and developed a relationship where he could question Freyberg &quot;without arousing impatience or irritation&quot;. He earned a Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his conduct during the First Battle of El Alamein. The citation for his award read:

In September 1942, he was promoted to brigadier and appointed commander of the 6th Infantry Brigade, the previous commander having been made a prisoner of war. Despite having no experience in commanding infantry, he led the brigade well until August 1943, at which time he replaced Stewart as Deputy Chief of Staff to Lieutenant General Edward Puttick. He served in this role for nearly 18 months before rejoining the 2NZEF.

After a period in Egypt in command of New Zealand troops there, from February 1945 Gentry commanded the newly formed 9th Infantry Brigade. His new command included the Divisional Cavalry and Machine Gun Battalion, both of which had been converted to an infantry role and were joined by the 22nd Battalion. After a period of training, the brigade participated in the final stages of the Italian campaign and Gentry was awarded a Bar to his DSO for his leadership of the brigade during this time. Command of his brigade was passed to Stewart on 10 November 1945 and Gentry returned to New Zealand. He was discharged from the 2NZEF in March 1946.

==Later life==
After serving for a time with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the organisation responsible for the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) in Japan, Gentry had a second term as Deputy Chief of Staff, this time to Major General Norman Weir. In 1949 he attended the Imperial Defence College (now known as the Royal College of Defence Studies) in England. After completion of his courses, Gentry returned to staff duties in New Zealand, serving as Adjutant General to Stewart, now Chief of Staff, and worked with him in preparing plans for the Government&#x27;s commitment to deploy military forces to the Middle East in the event of hostilities with the Soviet Union. This work led to several clashes with the Government. In the 1950 Kings&#x27;s Birthday Honours,he was promoted Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). In 1953, he was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal.

Promoted to major general, from 1952 to 1955 Gentry served as Chief of the General Staff of the New Zealand Military Forces. He represented New Zealand in ANZUS and was involved in planning for the defence of Southeast Asia. In the 1954 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath. The following year he retired from the military. In a break with convention he was not rewarded with a knighthood for his services. This may have been due to some ill-feeling within the Government regarding his work developing proposed plans for New Zealand&#x27;s Middle East deployment. He was appointed knighted three years later by the newly elected Labour Government in the 1958 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours.

In his retirement Gentry had a strong relationship with the Boy Scouts Association and served as its New Zealand president from 1957 to 1967. He was awarded the association&#x27;s Silver Wolf. He died on 13 October 1991 in Lower Hutt, where he had lived for many years, at the age of 92. His wife, whom he married in 1926, died in 1994.

<text>XIO is a packet-based, high-performance computer bus employed by the SGI Origin 2000, Octane, Altix, Fuel and Tezro machines. The XIO forms a bus between high-performance system devices and the memory controller.

XIO is usually used in a star topology, using a router ASIC called Crossbow (Xbow) to connect up to eight fully symmetrical devices in a system (one of them is usually the memory controller / CPU bridge, called HEART in Octane or Hub in Origin). Other devices known to have XIO interfaces are:
* BRIDGE: XIO to PCI-64 bridge (Octane, Origin)
* XBRIDGE: XIO to PCI-X bridge (Altix)
* HQ4: command processor of ImpactSR cards (Octane)
* KTOWN: frontend for InfiniteReality2 cards (Onyx, Origin variation)
* XC: Crosstown converter
* BUZZ: &quot;OpenGL-on-a-Chip&quot; ASIC used in ODYSSEY/VPro graphics (V6/V8/V10/V12)

The XIO employs two source-synchronous channels (one in each direction), each 8 or 16 bits wide. They are clocked at 400 MHz to achieve peak rates of 800 MB/s (i.e. in megabytes). Each of the devices can utilize the full bandwidth, as the XBow router prevents collisions by being able to route between any two points.

Transfer is organized into micropackets. These contain a total of 128 bits of data and 32 bits of control. The control information encapsulates an 8 bit sideband (used by higher layers for framing), sequence numbers (for go-back-n link-layer retransmissions) and check bits (CRC-16).

It is probable that XIO uses STL (which SGI likes to call &quot;SGI transistor logic&quot;) low-voltage single-ended I/O standard. CrossTown is a version of XIO utilizing PECL for differential I/O standard (like NUMAlink) for longer connections.

Higher-level encapsulation differs from NUMAlink (like used to connect HUB chips in Origin-series machines). It is well suited for short memory transactions.

XIO uses very delicate compression connectors, which should be handled with extreme care.

<text>Teen Beat was an American magazine geared towards teenaged readers, published 1967–.

Over its history, the magazine had multiple teen idols on its cover, including John Travolta, David Cassidy, Leif Garrett, Menudo, Michael J. Fox, Debbie Gibson, the Coreys (Feldman and Haim), Molly Ringwald, Tom Cruise, New Kids on the Block, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Devon Sawa, Jonathan Brandis, and more recently, Hanson, Ricky Martin, Leonardo DiCaprio, Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC, Hilary Duff, Michael Jackson, Raven-Symoné, Lindsay Lohan, and many others.

==Publication history==
First published in August 1967, the magazine was preceded by sister publications &quot;16 Magazine&quot;, which debuted in 1956, and &quot;Tiger Beat&quot;, which was first published in 1965.

&quot;Teen Beat&quot; was published by Sterling&#x27;s Magazines from 1967–c. 1985, including a period when it was part of Sterling&#x27;s Ideal Publishing Company. (Sterling&#x27;s also published &quot;Metal Edge&quot;, &quot;Metal Maniacs&quot;, &quot;Country Music Special&quot;, and others.) In the mid-1980s, Sterling&#x27;s &#x27;Ideal teen magazines&#x27; &quot;Teen Beat&quot;, &quot;Tiger Beat&quot;, &quot;Super Teen&quot; and &quot;Super Teen&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Loudmouth&quot; were acquired by Macfadden Publications. In 1985 Michael Liben was the publisher of &quot;Teen Beat&quot;.

The mid-1990s saw a slump in the overall teen magazine market. In 1998, the conglomerate&#x27;s line of youth music publications was sold off to Primedia. In 2001, after publishing up to twelve magazines each year, Primedia decided to reduce its number of publications to only four magazines per year, deciding to keep &quot;16&quot;, &quot;Tiger Beat&quot;, &quot;Teen Beat&quot;, and &quot;BOP Magazine&quot;. In October 2001 the frequency of &quot;Teen Beat&quot; switched to quarterly.

&quot;Teen Beat&quot; ceased publishing c. 2007.

<text>Taraclia (; ) is a city located in the south of Moldova. It is the capital of Taraclia District, bordered by the autonomous region of Gagauzia, by the Cahul District and the Odesa Oblast of Ukraine. The great majority of its inhabitants are ethnic Bulgarians.

The Taraclia State University, co-funded by Bulgaria and Moldova, was established in 2004. The languages of education are Bulgarian and Romanian.

==History==
According to official figures, Taraclia was founded in 1813 by Bulgarian immigrants, although they have been settling there much earlier.
The city is one of the oldest Bulgarian settlements of the nineteenth century in what was then the southern Bessarabia.

The first settlers arrived at Taraclia during the Russo-Turkish war of 1806–1812. In 1821 it has settled a large group, which was originally located in the nearby village Aluatu. After the Russo-Turkish war of 1828–1829 a large proportion of Bulgarian immigrants settled in Bessarabia and specially in Taraclia, about 49 families have settled in the city. The last wave of migration happened in 1854, when 241 people settled there. Having the rights of colonists, they built houses and churches and had children, taking advantage of several decades of privileges granted to them by the Tsarist Russian government.

In the middle of the 19th century, the famous explorer Apollon Skalkowski wrote about them: &quot;Residents, good hosts, herds of large cattle, sheep, and a great deal to the success of horticulture and viticulture, and women bred mulberry trees, collect the cocoons and have silk in large quantities&quot;

During the interwar period, the city was the seat of Plasa Traian, in Cahul County, Romania.

==Demographics==
According to the 2014 census, the population of Taraclia amounted to 12,355 inhabitants, a decrease compared to the previous census in 2004, when 13,756 inhabitants were registered. Of these, 6,126 were men and 6,229 were women.


&quot;Footnotes&quot;:

* &quot;There is an ongoing controversy regarding the ethnic identification of Moldovans and Romanians.&quot;

* &quot;Moldovan language is one of the two local names for the Romanian language in Moldova. In 2013, the Constitutional Court of Moldova interpreted that Article 13 of the constitution is superseded by the Declaration of Independence, thus giving official status to the name &quot;Romanian&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="906601" wikidata="Q7565104" url="?curid=906601" title="Source-synchronous">
<text>Source-Synchronous clocking refers to a technique used for timing symbols on a digital interface. Specifically, it refers to the technique of having the transmitting device send a clock signal along with the data signals. The timing of the unidirectional data signals is referenced to the clock (often called the strobe) sourced by the same device that generates those signals, and not to a global clock (i.e. generated by a bus master). Compared to other digital clocking topologies like system-synchronous clocks, where a global clock source is fed to all devices in the system, a source-synchronous clock topology can attain far higher speeds.

This type of clocking is common in high-speed interfaces between micro-chips, including DDR SDRAM, SGI XIO interface, Intel Front Side Bus for the x86 and Itanium processors, HyperTransport, SPI-4.2 and many others.

== Reasons for usage ==

A reason that source-synchronous clocking is useful is that it has been observed that all of the circuits within a given semiconductor device experience roughly the same process-voltage-temperature (PVT) variation. This means signal propagation delay experienced by the data through a device tracks the delay experienced by the clock through that same device over PVT. This advantage allows higher speed operation as compared to the traditional technique of providing the clock from a third device to both the transmitter and the receiver. Another benefit is that higher complexity data-recovery or clock-data-recovery circuits (such as PLLs) are not required when this technique is used.

Or rather than higher clock speeds, large systems that take advantage of source-synchronous clocking can have the benefit of a higher tolerance of PVT variation of its individual components.

=== Timing Analysis ===

Synchronous logic elements such as flip-flops have static timing criteria that must be satisfied in order for them to work correctly. In a system-synchronous clock topology where a skew-aligned clock is fed to all devices, the criteria are

formula_1

A source-synchronous clock topology eliminates two of these factors, formula_2 and formula_3. The former is eliminated since both clock and data signals are driven by identical flip-flops on the same silicon at the same temperature and voltage, thereby equalizing the formula_2 seen by both clock and data. The latter is eliminated for the same reason - since the clock and data are driven by identical devices and (ideally) connected with wires of equal length, the skew between clock and data is greatly reduced. For this reason, formula_5 can be reduced significantly. Since frequency is inversely proportional to clock period, the clock frequency increases as a result.

== Drawbacks ==

One drawback of using source-synchronous clocking is the creation of a separate clock-domain at the receiving device, namely the clock-domain of the strobe generated by the transmitting device. This strobe clock-domain is often not synchronous to the core clock domain of the receiving device. For proper operation of the received data with other data already present in the device, an additional stage of synchronization logic is required to transfer the received data into the core clock-domain of the receiving device. This stage can often be found alongside source synchronous logic. This usually results in greater system complexity compared to globally clocked systems, but the benefits are generally much greater than this increase in complexity.

== Implementation Variations ==

In bi-directional data transfer buses, two opposing unidirectional strobes can be sent from each device. Often the strobe is free running in this case. That is, the strobe continues to toggle whether there is data being transferred or not.

Another variation is the sharing of the same bus to transfer the strobe. In this case the strobe can only be transferred by the device that is sending the data and may require transmission of pre-ambles and post-ambles to indicate the start and end of the strobes. (Example: DDR2).

In large ASICs or processors, multiple strobes and data groups (data bits that are associated to the same strobe) may exist between the same two devices to account for the slightly different PVT variations in different regions of the same die.

<text>George Cave, 1st Viscount Cave, (23 February 1856 – 29 March 1928) was a British lawyer and Conservative politician. He was Home Secretary under David Lloyd George from 1916 to 1919 and served as Lord Chancellor from 1922 to 1924 and again from 1924 to 1928.

==Background and education==

Cave was born in London, the son of Thomas Cave, Member of Parliament for Barnstaple, and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Jasper Shallcrass. He was educated at the Merchant Taylors&#x27; School, London and St John&#x27;s College, Oxford. After being called to the bar in 1880, he practised as a barrister for a number of years, being made King&#x27;s Counsel and recorder of Guildford in 1904.

==Political career==

In 1906 he was elected Conservative Member of Parliament for the Kingston Division of Surrey, was appointed Vice-Lieutenant of Surrey in 1907, and a member of the Royal Commission on Land Purchase in 1908. Having served as standing counsel to the University of Oxford for two years as well as attorney general to the Prince of Wales, in 1915 Cave was appointed solicitor general and knighted. The following year, he was made Home Secretary in Lloyd George&#x27;s coalition government, a post he held for three years. As Home Secretary, he introduced the Representation of the People Act 1918 and he was very prominent in the debates in the House of Commons on the police strike of August 1918.

In 1918, Sir George Cave was ennobled as Viscount Cave, of Richmond in the County of Surrey. The following year, he became a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, and chaired a number of commissions, including the Southern Rhodesian commission and the Munitions Enquiry Tribunal. In 1922, he became Lord Chancellor in Bonar Law&#x27;s government, and again served in this capacity in Baldwin&#x27;s first administration. He chaired the post war report that led to cuts to the minimum wages and regulation of collective bargaining, recommended by the Cave Committee in 1922.

Having been appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) in 1921, he was also elected Chancellor of the University of Oxford in 1925, defeating former Liberal Prime Minister H. H. Asquith. Asquith was deeply upset by the defeat, partly because he felt that Cave, an old friend, should not have stood against him.

Roy Jenkins, an admirer of Asquith, described him as the least distinguished Lord Chancellor in the first three decades of the twentieth century.

==Family==
Lord Cave married Annie Estella Sarah Penfold Mathews, daughter of Captain William Withey Mathews and Jane Wallas (née Penfold), and sister of Sir Lloyd Mathews, in 1885. They had met by 1880, and he proposed to her in 1883. Lord and Lady Cave had three sons and one daughter, although each of them died on the day they were born, or soon afterwards. Their names were Ralph Wallas (1885), Lloyd George (1893), Honor Elizabeth (1895), and Mathew George (1899). They are all buried at St. Mary&#x27;s in Richmond. Cave died in March 1928, aged 72, at St Ann&#x27;s, Burnham, Somerset, and was buried at Berrow in the same county - his wife&#x27;s brother-in-law, W. K. Laurence, had been buried there only a week or so earlier, after dying tragically after a fall at Clevedon. 

On the day of his death his resignation as Lord Chancellor had been accepted and it had been announced that he would be created an earl, and so his widow, Estella, was created Countess Cave of Richmond, with remainder to heirs male of her body. 

Having no children who lived to adulthood, the viscountcy became extinct on Lord Cave&#x27;s death, as did the earldom when his widow died in 1938.

<text>A mòd is a festival of Scottish Gaelic song, arts and culture. Historically, the Gaelic word &quot;mòd&quot; (), which came from Old Norse &quot;mót&quot;, refers to a Viking Age &quot;Thing&quot; or a similar kind of assembly. There are both local mòds, and an annual national mòd, the Royal National Mòd. Mòds are run under the auspices of An Comunn Gàidhealach. The term comes from a Gaelic word for a parliament or congress in common use during the Lordship of the Isles.
A mòd largely takes the form of formal competitions. Choral events (in Gaelic, both solo and choirs), and traditional music including fiddle, bagpipe and folk groups dominate. Spoken word events include children&#x27;s and adult&#x27;s poetry reading, storytelling and Bible reading, and categories such as Ancient Folk Tale or Humorous Monologue. Children can also present an original drama, and there are competitions in written Scottish Gaelic literature. Unlike the National Mòd, local mòds usually only last a day or two. They attract a much smaller crowd and the only notable social event is the winners&#x27; ceilidh. As there are fewer competitions than in the National Mòd, this ceilidh is often more like a traditional ceilidh with dancing and guest singers between the winners&#x27; performances.

Culturally, mòds are comparable to an Irish feis or the Seachtain na Gaeilge, or the Welsh eisteddfod.

In British Columbia, the Gaelic Society of Vancouver held a local Mòd biannually from 1990 to 2007.

The first US National Mòd was organized by Donald F. MacDonald, the founder of the Grandfather Mountain Highland games in North Carolina, and held at Alexandria, Virginia in 1988. The US National Mòd is now held as part of the annual Highland games at Ligonier, Pennsylvania and sponsored by &quot;An Comunn Gàidhealach Ameireaganach&quot; (&quot;The American Scottish Gaelic Society&quot;).

<text>The &quot;Admiral Petre Bărbuneanu&quot;-class corvette (also known as the Tetal-I class by NATO) is a series of four corvettes designed and constructed for the Romanian Naval Forces primarily for anti-submarine warfare. Only two corvettes out of a total of the four are still in service. Designed and constructed in the 1980s, they are a product of the Cold War with their armament and sensors based on Soviet designs. This class of corvettes was superseded by the &quot;Rear-Admiral Eustațiu Sebastian&quot; (Tetal-II) class.

==Design and description==
The &quot;Admiral Petre Bărbuneanu&quot; class was based on the Soviet Navy&#x27;s but designed in Romania to a smaller size, though retaining their anti-submarine warfare (ASW) role. They incorporated Soviet weapons and sensors into their design. Vessels of the class have a full load displacement of and measure long with a beam of and a draught of . The ships are powered by four diesel engines driving four shafts creating . This gives the corvettes a maximum speed of .

The vessels are armed with four Soviet-designed AK-276 /59 calibre guns in two twin turrets with one turret situated forward and aft. The 76  mm guns have a range of and fire up to 90 rounds per minute. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, the corvettes have four AK-230 /65 calibre AA guns in two twin mounts positioned aft, forward of the aft 76 mm turret. The 30 mm guns have a range of and can fire up to 500 rounds per minute. They also mount two single-mounted machine guns along the amidships. For ASW purposes, the &quot;Admiral Petre Bărbuneanu&quot; class mounts RBU 2500 16-tubed ASW rocket launchers that are trainable with a range of . The ships have four torpedo tubes in two twin mounts situated aft to either side of the aft 76 mm gun turret. They can fire Type 53-65 torpedoes which have a range of .

&quot;Admiral Petre Bărbuneanu&quot;-class corvettes are equipped with Soviet MR-302 (NATO reporting name: Strut Curve) air search/surface search radar, MR-104 &quot;Rys&quot; (NATO reporting name: Drum Tilt) and MR-105 &quot;Turel&quot; (NATO reporting name: Hawk Screech) fire control radar. They have Hercules MG-22 hull-mounted sonar for underwater search and two PK 16 chaff launchers and RW-23 (NATO reporting name: Watch Dog) electronic support measures. The corvettes have a complement of 98.

==Ships in class==
==Construction and career==
The vessels were constructed at the Mangalia Shipyard for the Romanian Naval Forces. The first ship to commission was &quot;Amiral Petre Bărbuneanu&quot; in 1983. Three more corvettes would follow before the project was terminated in 1987 in favour of a new design that incorporated a helicopter flight deck. In 2004, two of the corvettes, &quot;Vice-Amiral Vasile Urseanu&quot; and &quot;Vice-Amiral Vasile Scodrea&quot; were decommissioned. The remaining ships are based at Constanța.

<text>The Royal National Mòd () is an Eisteddfod-inspired international Celtic festival focusing upon Scottish Gaelic literature, traditional music, and culture which is held annually in Scotland. It is the largest of several major Scottish Mòds and is often referred to simply as the Mòd.

The Mòd is run by &quot;An Comunn Gàidhealach&quot; (The Gaelic Association) and includes competitions and awards.

==History==
The Mòd was founded by An Comunn Gàidhealach. St Columba&#x27;s Church, Glasgow, also greatly influenced the Mòd&#x27;s inception when, in 1891, its choir was invited to give a Gaelic Concert in Oban, presided over by Lord Archibald Campbell. The concert was attended by much of the Scottish nobility, including Louise, Princess Royal and Duchess of Fife. After the concert, the choir were entertained to supper at the Alexandra Hotel, and a description of the entertainment is given in one of William Black&#x27;s novels. This concert was the prelude to the first Mòd, which was held at Oban the following year and St. Columba Choir won the award in the Choral music competition. The poet, traditional singer, and Highland Land League activist Màiri Mhòr nan Òran (1821–1898), performed in the first Mòd&#x27;s Gaelic song competition, but she was not awarded a medal.

The Mòd has been held most years in October since 1892. The only years in which the National Mòd was not held were during the First World War of 1914–1919, the Second World War 1939–1946, and the Covid pandemic year of 2020. The &quot;Royal&quot; was not originally part of the name. It is still the practice of the St Columba&#x27;s Church to send a concert party to start off the fund-raising when the Mòd visits Oban. As well as winning the premier choir competition for the first three years, the congregation has also had many Mòd gold medallists over the years.

The Mòd itself has been greatly influenced by the National Eisteddfod of Wales, although it tends to be somewhat more restrained in its ceremonial aspects.

According to Ronald Black, &quot;In 1923, following the example of the Welsh Eisteddfod, &quot;An Commun Gàidhealach&quot; simplified the structure of its annual poetry competitions into a single contest for a Bardic Crown (&quot;Crùn na Bàrdachd&quot;), the winner to be acknowledged as Bard of An Commun (&quot;Bàird a&#x27; Chomuinn Ghàidhealaich&quot;) for the coming year. The man behind the move, not surprisingly, was Angus Robertson, then President of An Comunn. Offering a distinctive middle path between traditional and modern verse, the competition produced much work of note which deserves to be put into perspective... (Many subsidiary prizes remained; Sorley Maclean won a junior one in 1928, while in 1946 Derick Thomson won a gold medal as the most distinguished entrant in the literary competitions generally). The Bard was crowned each year at the closing concert of the Mòd. Astonishingly, unlike in Wales, the winning poem itself formed no part of the proceedings... In 1978 no award was made because no entry was of adequate quality. It was the second time in five years that this had happened, and in March 1979 An Comunn announced that the Bardic Crown would no longer be awarded.&quot;

A watershed moment took place during the 2011 Royal National Mòd at Stornoway, when the poetry of Lewis MacKinnon, composed in the Canadian Gaelic dialect spoken in Antigonish County, Nova Scotia, won the Bardic Crown. It was the first time in the history of the Mòd that such an award had been granted to a non-Scot.

==Competitions==
The Mòd largely takes the form of formal competitions. Choral events and traditional music including Gaelic song, fiddle, bagpipe, clarsach and folk groups dominate. Spoken word events include children&#x27;s and adults&#x27; poetry reading, storytelling and Bible reading, and categories such as Ancient Folk Tale or Humorous Monologue. Children can also present an original drama, and there are prose and poetry competitions in written Scottish Gaelic literature. The Mòd also runs an annual shinty competition, the Mòd Cup, between the two shinty teams closest to where the Mòd is taking place.

The winners of each day&#x27;s competitions are invited to perform in the winners&#x27; cèilidhs held every evening.

The Mòd is a celebration of [Scottish] Gaelic language and culture, which raises its profile and contributes towards the aim of securing its future.

Improvements in and the recent mass expansion of Scottish Gaelic-medium education across Scotland has meant that beginning in 2007 the junior fluent speakers&#x27; section increased to such an extent that the organisers were forced to extend some Mòd competitions beyond one day.

Culturally, the Mòd is comparable to the Welsh Eisteddfod and the Irish Oireachtas na Gaeilge.

==The Mòd Fringe==

The Mòd draws a large crowd, which leads local venues to put on various events in addition to the official Mòd events. These events are collectively referred to as the Mòd Fringe.

To participants, the Mòd is also an opportunity to meet with old friends and make new ones. 

==Controversy==
There has been some recent criticism of the &quot;Gold Medal&quot; event, which favors the style of Gaelic singing as adapted into the Victorian era art song tradition, which was popularized in the early 20th century by Marjory Kennedy-Fraser. Some 21st century Scottish traditional musicians now allege that the contest has long marginalised more traditional singers like the late Flora MacNeil and their styles. This is not a new criticism, however. In conversation with American ethnomusicologist Amy Murray, Fr. Allan MacDonald (1859-1905), an iconic poet in Scottish Gaelic literature, once said that the choral arrangements of Gaelic songs usually performed at the Mòd during its inception were based on &quot;collections noted both on the staff and in Tonic Sol-Fa, with of course all the twists and turns cut out&quot;, and were &quot;As though you were to fit a statue into a box by taking off the nose and ears.&quot;

More recently, Scottish traditional musician Fergus Munro has also gone on the record, as Scotland has grown increasingly secularised, as a critic of what he alleges is a growing tendency to exclude both Christian poetry and Gaelic psalm- and hymn-singing from the Mòd.

Furthermore, the Mòd is popularly known as the &quot;Whisky Olympics&quot;, which is considered, &quot;either a vicious slur or fair comment&quot;.

==Media coverage==
BBC Scotland has traditionally broadcast Mòd highlights on BBC One, BBC Two and Radio nan Gàidheal. Since its introduction in 2008, BBC Alba has provided coverage in Gaelic. Presenters have included traditional musician, Gaelic speaker and broadcaster, Mary Ann Kennedy and Gaelic broadcaster Cathy Crombie.

==Past and future festivals==
The Mòd is held each October, and has been held in the following locations throughout Scotland, both Highland and Lowland.

* Thurso - 2010
* Western Isles - 2005, 2011, 2016
The locations for upcoming Mòds are:
* Lochaber - October 2025
* Glasgow - October 2026
* Western Isles - October 2027

The southernmost host location is Ayr, the easternmost Aberdeen and the northernmost is Thurso. As can be seen from the list, certain locations are more favoured. Areas with large amounts of hall space and accommodation are favoured.

Some notable areas of Scotland that have never been visited by the Mòd include Arran, Islay (which has a significant Gaelic-speaking population), Campbelltown, Dumfries and Galloway, Fife, Angus (outwith Dundee), most of North East Scotland, Loch Lomond-side etc.

The Mòd has never been to the Scottish Borders or the Northern Isles, but there is little connection between these areas and the Gaelic language.

Unlike the National Eisteddfod, the National Mòd has never been held in England.

<doc id="906633" wikidata="Q844643" url="?curid=906633" title="Subantarctic fur seal">
<text>The subantarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus tropicalis) is a species of arctocephaline found in the southern parts of the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans. It was first described by Gray in 1872 from a specimen recovered in northern Australia—hence the inappropriate specific name &quot;tropicalis&quot;.

== Description ==
The subantarctic fur seal is medium in size compared with other fur seals. The two sexes are strongly sexually dimorphic: males grow to 2m and 160 kg, whereas females are substantially smaller—1.4m and 50 kg. Subantarctic fur seals have creamy-orange chests and faces. Their bellies are more brownish. Males have a dark grey to black back, while females are a lighter grey. Males have a characteristic dark tuft of hair on the top of their head that stands erect when they are excited. Pups are black at birth, but molt at about 3 months old. The snout is short and flat, and the flippers are short and broad. Subantarctic fur seals live for about 20–25 years.

== Distribution ==

&quot;Arctocephalus tropicalis&quot;, the subantarctic fur seal, is geographically widespread; as their specific and common names imply, they generally breed in and inhabit more northerly (subantarctic, or &quot;tropical&quot;) locations than the Antarctic fur seal (&quot;Arctocephalus gazella&quot;) does. The largest known breeding colonies are on Gough Island, in the South Atlantic, and Île Amsterdam, in the southern reaches of the Indian Ocean. Breeding grounds are also located on Marion Island in the Prince Edward Islands—which is shared with the Antarctic fur seal—as well as the Crozet Islands and Macquarie Island. In places where the two species intermingle, &quot;A. tropicalis&quot; can be identified visually by the lighter, orange colouring on its chest. Occasional hybridisation has been known to occur between the two seals in these areas.

About 300,000 subantarctic fur seals are remaining today, a number likely to be substantially lower than when they were first discovered in 1810, as they were hunted excessively for their pelts throughout the 19th century. Populations from ancient history, prior to human contact, were likely even higher. However, the species recovers rapidly, it seems, albeit in areas wherein it is protected by the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (CCAS). A small population on Heard Island is considered endangered. The Antarctic fur seal was also rigorously hunted, to the point of all but one breeding colony remaining by the year 1900, resulting in an increasingly low species-wide genetic variability; meanwhile, the genetic diversity amongst subantarctic fur seals has remained high. There appear to be three distinct genetic lineages in the subantarctic species, though none of them represent any particular geographical area.

==Behavior==
===Breeding===

As with other otariids, subantarctic fur seals gather in large rookeries on the shore to breed. They have a polygynous mating system in which dominant males will defend their harem of 6–20 females. Fights between males for mating rights are violent and can result in severe injuries. Males will also compete against each other through vocalizations and threat displays. The breeding season takes place from November to January. Gestation lasts around 51 weeks, at the end of which the female will give birth to a single pup. 8–12 days after giving birth, they will breed again. Males are capable of mating at around 3–4 years of age, but they are unlikely to be able to hold a harem until they are 10–11 years old. Females reach sexual maturity at around 5 years.

===Life cycle===

After being born, pups spend around 11 months feeding on their mother&#x27;s milk, which contains around 39% fat. The length of their lactation period is typical of otariid seals, and contrasts with the far shorter 4 month lactation period of the Antarctic fur seal. They stay at the rookery during this period. Weaning occurs shortly before the next offspring is born. They molt their black coat at around 3 months of age. As adults, they continue to molt their coat annually between March and May.

===Diet and foraging===
Subantarctic fur seals hunt in shallow waters at night, when myctophid fish come close to the surface. They also feed on squid. Other prey can include crustaceans, and occasionally rockhopper penguins and other seabirds.

A study conducted on subantarctic fur seals at Marion Island from 1996 to 2000 concluded that Myctophid fish constituted the largest part of the seals&#x27; diet, with fish from the families Channichthyidae, Paralepididae, Nototheniidae, Microstomatidae and Notosudidae being eaten in smaller numbers. The size of prey fish ranged from small Myctophids with an average length of 25mm, to large Patagonian toothfish with an average length of 70 cm.

===Travelling===

Subantarctic fur seals are unique in their tendency to occasionally travel very long distances from their home islands. Young males have been seen travelling thousands of miles from their native habitat, being sighted in countries such as Brazil, Angola, Australia and New Zealand. In July 2015, a young male seal was caught and later released by local fishermen off the coast of Kenya, more than 4,000 miles (6.400 km) from its home. This is the furthest north that a subantarctic fur seal has been recorded travelling to. Lactating females have been recorded travelling up to 530 km from their colonies in order to forage for food.

<text>Graham Philip Brazier (6 May 1952 – 4 September 2015) was a New Zealand musician and songwriter. He first came to prominence in the band Hello Sailor. After Hello Sailor, he formed a band called the Legionnaires. When he was growing up, he lived above his mother&#x27;s bookshop in Dominion Road in Auckland and he collected first editions.

== Early life ==
His childhood was fashioned seeing R.A.K. Mason, Rex Fairburn, Kevin Ireland and other writers in the shop. Graham left Mt Roskill Grammar at age 15 for his first job at Whitcombe &amp; Tombs. He began writing songs when he was 19.

== Career ==

Although Brazier claimed he turned down an offer to join The Doors post-Jim Morrison, it was stated by Doors ex-manager and biographer, Danny Sugerman, to be &quot;somewhat exaggerated&quot;.

Two Brazier associated songs are included in the official top 100 New Zealand songs. They are &quot;Blue Lady&quot; alongside his first band, Hello Sailor, as well as &quot;Billy Bold&quot; from his solo career.

It was reported on 7 October 2012 that Brazier was charged with assaulting his two former partners. He pleaded guilty to two counts of male assaults female and one count of common assault.

Brazier suffered a heart attack in August 2015, and died in Auckland on 4 September 2015.

Brazier&#x27;s posthumous solo album &quot;Left Turn at Midnite&quot;, completed after Brazier&#x27;s death by close friend producer Alan Jansson, was released in May 2017.

==Solo discography==
*&quot;Inside Out&quot; (Polygram), 1981
*&quot;Brazier&quot; (CBS), 1987 (spent one week in the NZ album chart at No. 49 in February 1988)
*&quot;East of Eden&quot; (Wildside) March 2004
*&quot;Left Turn at Midnite&quot; (Ripe Coconut) May 2017

<text>The Reaction Motors LR99 engine was the first large, throttleable, restartable liquid-propellant rocket engine. Development began in the 1950s by the Reaction Motors Division of Thiokol Chemical Company to power the North American X-15 hypersonic research aircraft. It could deliver up to of thrust with a specific impulse of or at sea level. Thrust was variable from 50 to 100 percent, and the restart capability allowed it to be shut down and restarted during flight when necessary.

==Design and development==
The engine is propelled by liquid oxygen and anhydrous ammonia, pumped into the engine by turbopumps at a mass flow rate of over per minute.

After one hour of operation, the XLR99 required an overhaul. Operating times nearly twice that were recorded in tests, but declared largely unsafe. The basic X-15 aircraft carried fuel for about 83 seconds of full-powered flight, while the X-15A-2 carried fuel for just over 150 seconds. Therefore, each XLR99 was capable, in theory, of between 20 and 40 flights before an overhaul.

Like many other liquid-fuel rocket engines, the XLR99s used regenerative cooling, in that the thrust chamber and nozzle had tubing surrounding it, through which the propellant and oxidizer passed before being burned. This kept the engine cool, and preheated the fuel. The basic engine has a mass of .

==Operational history==
The LR-99 was used exclusively to power the X-15 research aircraft after initial trials that used a pair of Reaction Motors XLR11s.

==Applications==
* North American X-15

==Variants==
;XLR99-RM-1: prototype engines for initial testing and flight trials.
;YLR99-RM-1: Service test engines fitted to X-15s for later flights.

<text>David Ewan McArtney (5 April 1951 – 15 April 2013) was a New Zealand musician and songwriter. He is best known for his work with the band Hello Sailor and his band Dave McArtney &amp; The Pink Flamingos.

In 1989, McArtney returned to university, completing his Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature, majoring in Renaissance poetry. He then went on to complete a Master of Arts (Music) degree in 2013.

He also produced for other musicians (including The Narcs) and composed music for film and television productions, including &quot;Incredible Mountains&quot; (1983), &quot;Queen City Rocker&quot; (1986) and &quot;Raglan by the Sea&quot; (1987). He worked as a tutor at the Music and Audio Institute of New Zealand (MAINZ) from 2003 until his death.

==Personal life==
McArtney was born in Oamaru on 5 April 1951. His family moved to Auckland and then Wellington in the early 1960s, as his father who was an accountant with ANZ Bank moved with his job. McArtney started studying law before forming Hello Sailor with Harry Lyon and Graham Brazier. He died in his home in Point Chevalier, Auckland, on 15 April 2013.

==The Pink Flamingos==
After Hello Sailor disbanded in 1980, McArtney formed the Pink Flamingos with Dragon keyboard player and songwriter Paul Hewson (not Bono) and a revolving line-up of players. McArtney was signed to PolyGram records and released their debut album &quot;Dave McArtney &amp; The Pink Flamingos&quot; in 1981. Paul Hewson left the band, which then released the EP &quot;Remember The Alamo&quot; and extensively toured New Zealand. The band then relocated to Sydney and signed to Polygram Australia, releasing their second album &quot;We Never Close&quot; in 1982. Later that year the group disbanded, with McArtney moving to London.

<text>The Church of Saint Sava () is a 79 m high Serbian Orthodox church, which sits on the Vračar plateau in Belgrade, Serbia. It was planned as the bishopric seat and main cathedral of the Serbian Orthodox Church. The church is dedicated to Saint Sava, the founder of the Serbian Orthodox Church and an important figure in medieval Serbia. It is built on the presumed location of St. Sava&#x27;s grave. His coffin had been moved from Mileševa Monastery to Belgrade. The coffin was placed on a pyre and burnt in 1595 by Ottoman Grand Vizier Sinan Pasha. Bogdan Nestorović and Aleksandar Deroko were finally chosen to be the architects in 1932 after a second revised competition in 1926–27 (for which no first award was granted, Nestorović being runner up). This sudden decision instigated an important debate in interwar Yugoslavia which centered around the temple&#x27;s size, design and symbolic national function. This was accompanied by a sizeable increase in the base area of the ambitiously conceived project. The new design departed from the competition guidelines issued in 1926, and was to replicate the dimensions and architecture of Hagia Sophia.

The first stone was laid in 1935. When Yugoslavia was under occupation in 1941, the construction was approximately ten metres high. The incomplete building was used as a depot by the German army and Tito&#x27;s partisans. After the war, the Orthodox Church was unsuccessful in its attempt to secure permission to complete the building. Permission was granted in 1984, and the architect Branko Pešić was commissioned to adapt the project to new construction techniques. On May 12, 1985, a liturgy was held at the temple with 100,000 people in attendance. This marked a turning point in the then-communist country; the church had reinstated its position and the communist elite had to back down from a decade-long ban prohibiting the construction of the church. In June 1989, the concrete dome of the temple, weighing 4,000 tonnes and constructed entirely on the ground, was raised to its present position. This was a landmark achievement in construction. 
It is the largest Orthodox church in Serbia, one of the largest Eastern Orthodox churches and it ranks among the largest churches in the world. It is the most recognisable building in Belgrade and a landmark, as its dominating dome resembles that of the Hagia Sophia, after which it had been modelled. The church contains a rigorous symmetrical layout with a great sensitivity to light due to its large dome and four apses. Its interior cladding with of gold mosaics is almost complete. The initiative for the mosaic decoration inside the dome was secured by a donation of the Russian Federation, while the larger remainder of the mosaic cladding was successively financed by the Republic of Serbia.

Vladimir Putin of Russia visited the church in January 2019 and announced that the Russian state would finance parts of the remaining works in the mosaic cladding. He symbolically laid a stone in a mosaic with the presentation of the Mandylion. Putin was formally invited to attend the consecration of the church, which was then scheduled for the end of 2020 but the ceremony has not yet occurred owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Following the conversion of the Hagia Sophia to a mosque in July 2020, the Patriarch of Serbia Irinej and Serbia&#x27;s president Aleksandar Vučić in August 2020 expressed their wish the Saint Sava Church would symbolically replace the Hagia Sophia, after which it was modelled, and become a &quot;New Hagia Sophia&quot;.

In May 2021, the entire Vračar plateau which surrounds the church was declared a spatial cultural-historical unit, and placed under the state protection as the Saint Sava&#x27;s Plateau. The rationale in government&#x27;s decision included &quot;symbolical, memorial, cultural-historical, architectural-urban and artistic values of the locality, which represents memory spot of two turning points in Serbian history: Burning of Saint Sava&#x27;s relics and the First Serbian Uprising&quot;.

== Site ==

The church stands on the Vračar plateau in Belgrade. It is located at the sight axes of the important commercial traffic artery from the old city to the SE outskirts. It is visible from the Kralja Milana street, between Terazije and Slavija Square, which is in extension of the axis. The church is the terminus and landmark of the intended boulevard in the first urban plan of Belgrade made by Emilijan Josimović from the second half of the 19th century. With its architectural form paraphrasing the Byzantine Hagia Sophia, the builders hoped that it will eventually evolve into a universal center of Orthodoxy. Moscow also had at the time lost prominence within Orthodoxy, as the October revolution sidelined religion in Russia and a compensation was intended. The Yugoslav communists also obstructed work on the church, as they banned further construction at the site after World War II. After a long delay, the church rose in 1985. In 2004 all works on the outside had been finished, the expected consecration with the finished interior space was expected to be held at the end of 2020.

The church lies on the western promontory of the Vračar-Plateau at 134 m height. It is located 500 m south of Belgrade&#x27;s main square, Slavija square. The base of the church is 18 m above Belgrade&#x27;s traditional geographic center, the Terazije square and the main pedestrian lane, the Knez Mihajlova ulica. It is also 10 m higher than Tašmajdan park, where the second biggest church in Belgrade St. Mark&#x27;s and the Serbian Parliament, the Skupština are located. As it lies also 63 m above the confluence of the Sava River into the Danube, St. Sava is a primary natural viewpoint and from its massive dome a visible landmark for the city. From the publicly accessible gallery around the dome, a view on the urban fabric of Belgrade is possible. A lift will be installed after interior works are finished for all visitors of the church. 
Below the foundation of St. Sava, pass the double-tubes of the Belgrade rail-commuter network, BG Voz This necessitated a redesign of the original plan of the crypt.

==History==
===Background===
Saint Sava (1175–1235), the patron saint and national hero of the Serbian people, was born Rastko Nemanja in 1175, the son of Serbian Grand Župan Stephen (r. 1166–1196). Serbia was still a relatively young nation, having freed itself from the Byzantine Empire in the previous century. In 1077 Duklja became the first Serb kingdom, its founding being intimately interconnected with the establishment of the Roman Catholic Bishopric of Bar. Toward the end of the 12th century, the new state Raška, centered in what is now southern Serbia, rose as a second Serbian nation. Stephen Nemanja ruled Raška. In 1196 he, like his son Rastko before him, moved to the Eastern Orthodox monastic center on Mount Athos in Greece, where he was known as the monk Simeon. Soon afterward, he joined with his son to rebuild the ruined Monastery of Hilandar, on Mount Athos, which had been given to the Serbian people by the Byzantine emperor. Simeon died there in 1199. Sava organized after his return to Serbia the Serbian Orthodox Church and was consecrated the first archbishop of the Serbian church by Patriarch Manul I of Constantinople (r. 1216–1222), the Ecumenical Patriarchate. Sava died in 1236 after his unparalleled second pilgrimage to the Holy Land, Egypt and Mount Sinai, in Veliko Tarnovo in Bulgaria. He was later canonized and named the patron saint of Serbian schools and school-children.

In 1594, Serbs rose up against Ottoman rule in Banat, during the Long War (1591–1606) which was fought at the Austrian-Ottoman border in the Balkans. The Serbian patriarchate and rebels had established relations with foreign states, and had in a short time captured several towns, including Vršac, Bečkerek, Lipova, Titel and Bečej, although the uprising was quickly suppressed. The rebels had, in the character of a holy war, carried war flags with the icon of Saint Sava.

The war banners had been consecrated by Patriarch John I Kantul, whom the Ottoman government later had hanged in Istanbul. Ottoman Grand Vizier Sinan Pasha ordered that the sarcophagus and relics of Saint Sava located in the Mileševa monastery be brought by military convoy to Belgrade. Along the way, the Ottoman convoy had people killed in their path so that the rebels in the woods would hear of it. The relics were publicly incinerated by the Ottomans, on 27 April 1595, as it was placed on a pyre and burnt on the Vračar plateau, and the ashes scattered. According to Nikolaj Velimirović the flames were seen over the Danube.

On the 300th anniversary of the burning of Saint Sava&#x27;s body, a group of Serbian Orthodox believers founded the Society for the Construction of the Cathedral of Saint Sava on Vračar with the idea of building a cathedral on the site. Initially a small church was constructed and the search began to find an adequate design.

The church is widely regarded as an important symbol of the Byzantine revival architecture, that dominated church architecture from Russia to the Balkans in the 19th and the first half of the 20th century. In particular, it had to serve Serbs as a symbol of the afterlife of the medieval Serbian empire. Especially in the context of Yugoslavia, a Serbo-Byzantine culture was favoured both by the Yugoslav king Aleksandar I Karadjordjević and the Patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church. The adoption of a pattern that followed the prototype of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople illustrates the idea that Serbs are legitimate heirs to imperial Byzantium. Belgrade was visioned as a new imperial center of Orthodoxy, which had a particular resonance in the context of the demise of Moscow being the communist capital when the church was planned.

===Planning===
Date and location of the Burning of Saint Sava&#x27;s relics remained disputed. Given years are 1594 and 1595, while the proposed locations, as the name Vračar was applied to the much wider territory than it occupies today, include: Crveni Krst, suggested by who erected reddish Vozarev Krst at the spot, which gave name to the entire neighborhood of Crveni Krst (&quot;Red Cross&quot;); mound of &quot;Čupina Humka&quot;, in Tašmajdan, previously known as Little Vračar, which is the preferred location of modern historians; Vračar plateau, which attracted the widest public acceptance.

In 1894, which was then celebrated as the 300th anniversary of the burning, consensus was reached to build the church on the third plateau location. In 1895 the &quot;Society for the Construction of the Church of Saint Sava on Vračar&quot; was founded in Belgrade. The major part of the parcel donated for the construction came from Scottish missionary Francis Mackenzie, who purchased and developed this part of the city in the late 19th century. By the 1900 &quot;ukaz&quot; of King Alexander Obrenović, the planned church was declared a &quot;nationwide edifice&quot;. A small church was built at the future place of the temple, and it was later moved so the construction of the temple could begin.

==== First competition ====
In 1906, an architectural design competition for the future church was announced. Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences was authorized to judge the project, and it rejected all five applications as insufficient. A series of wars followed (First Balkan War in 1912, Second Balkan War in 1913, World War I in 1914–1918), which stopped all construction activities. After the war, in 1919, the Society was re-established.

A renewed competition was announced in 1926. Beside the church itself, it was to include buildings of the Patriarchate, Ministry of Religion, Seminary and . The competition rules stipulated that the new church must be in the style of the Serbo-Byzantine architecture, from the period of Prince Lazar (late 14th century). There were 24 submissions. Though the first and third prizes were not awarded, a second-place submission was handed to the architect .

Soon, the project itself, but also the idea of the church and its proposed style became a matter of fierce public debate. In 1905, Croatian sculptor Ivan Meštrović proposed his idea of building the Vidovdan Temple. Fragments of the future building were exhibited in the pavilion of the Kingdom of Serbia at the major Rome 1911 exhibition. The full-scale model was then exhibited by Meštrović in London in 1915. The idea of Meštrović was that epics of all Yugoslav ethnicities are the same and he wanted to represent all &quot;three tribes&quot; (Serbs, Croats and Slovenes) in the monumental temple. He sculpted caryatides for the entrance of the future temple, which are today in the hallways of the National Museum in Belgrade. Meštrović planned to build it at Gazimestan, on Kosovo, between the rivers of Sitnica and Lab.

==== Second competition ====

After World War I, Serbia was integrated into the new Yugoslav State, thus the idea for the memorial church transformed into a more ambitious project. In the second competition a church with a ground area of 60 x 60 m was publicly announced.
A new impetus came from the foundation of an association to build a memorial church on Vračar. The managing board was held by the patriarch Dimitrije. The church was thought to have a built area of 3000 m2, to tower 80 m and offer space to 6.000 faithful. The church was to pay reference to close national building traditions and resemble edifices in late Byzantine art of the so-called &quot;Morava style&quot;, highlighting locally built churches commissioned under the reign of Lazar of Serbia (1329–1389) and his successors. The churches from the second half of the 14th century had all a trikonchic floor-plans, a cross-in-square design and some important royal burial places and memorial monasteries were also five-domed. One specification said that only Yugoslav or Russian architects are eligible for entries in the competition. It favoured especially Serbian nationals and Russian émigré architects, who were the main representatives in the neo-Byzantine movement which had graduated at the Vienna Academy of Arts, where Serbian students were lectured by Theophil von Hansen at the end of the 19th century in neo-Byzantine tendencies. They figured prominently in the competition of 1926–27.

The guidelines of the competition stated that the building should be the &quot;greatest and most monumental building in the country, and have ultimate artistic importance&quot;.

With the preparation and implementation of the second International Congress of Byzantine Studies 1927 in Belgrade, tendencies of the neo-Byzantine movement culminated in Yugoslavia. The clerical hierarchy sought a church in the tradition of historicism based on classical Byzantine models, more precisely on buildings in the then-called &quot;Serbo-Byzantine Style&quot;. The competition marked a climax in neo-Byzantine tendencies in Serbia which saw also the rising of Monastery Gračanica as the ultimate achievement of the late Byzantine architecture and an acclaimed model for the building of the new church on Vračar, even so it was not requested.

It was coincidental that the call for entries was listed on 3 November 1926 in Politika and the competition should be held on 30 April 1927, several months prior to the International Congress of Byzantine Studies 10–14 December 1927. Discourses in the Serbo-Byzantine movement derived not directly from the sphere of architecture, but established here from studies in humanities, which retrospectively sought to highlight the importance of the Byzantine commonwealth to the Serbian cultural tradition. The main proponents came from Russia. With an important Russian émigré community, Belgrade had become after World War I a center of this tendency. Russian émigré architects had become the main architects for public buildings during the reign of the Yugoslav king Aleksandar I, they were located atop the hierarchy and were preferably engaged for building representative government edifices.

The competition itself was not successful, no first-prize winner was announced. None of the entries sufficed the public and professional opinion. Most entries had even not fulfilled the guidelines, most proposed designs were based on models of the Gračanica Monastery as the main representative of national Serbian medieval architecture or even the Hagia Sophia. It is believed that the Jury had recommended the two models. As with the Katholikon of Gračanica, its design was regarded the highpoint of the national architecture, and the competition manifested as the initial point in an evolving discourse about architecture and national identity in Serbian art. Gračanica, even not belonging to the group of memorial monasteries whose royal founders build them as burial places, became a chosen inspiration for the architects. They saw it as a modern source of inspiration in the quest for a true national style.

The second competition saw 22 (24?) entries from major architects in the country. All final proposals had to be submitted before May 1927. Besides Bogdan Nestorović and Aleksandar Deroko, entries came from Dragiša Brašovan, Milan Zloković, Milutin Borisavljević, Branko Krstić and Petar Krstić, Žarko Tatić, Aleksej Papkov, Miladin Prljević, Branče Marinković and Žikica Piperski, Aleksander Vasić and others. The commission had Patriarch Dimitrije, Jovan Cvijić, Andra Stevanović and Bogdan Popović, Pera Popović and Momir Korunović. The commission declined to name a winning entry, as none of the entries had fulfilled the tender criteria. The commission criticised the minor quality of most of the entries.

==== Public controversy ====

Five years after the second competition, 1932, and two years after the new Patriarch Patriarch Varnava took office, the Committee unexpectedly announced that the second-prize entry and the runners-up were chosen to be combined for the final project. That was followed by the similarly unexpected suggestion that the new cathedral should be reminiscent of Hagia Sophia. Bogdan Nestorović&#x27;s entry 1927 was based upon the Gračanica model and had only touched some elements that resemble the plan of the Hagia Sophia, while the entry of Aleksandar Deroko even more reminiscent of Hagia Sophia was by no means a copy or anywhere close to the appearance of the imperial church. There were additional complaints about the plan to build an immense monument that was to be of national importance for Yugoslavs, given the fact that the cult of Saint Sava was a largely Serbian legacy. Despite the public debate, the realization of the Nestorović-Deroko project took shape after 1932. Vojislav Zađin was chosen as the engineer. Still, construction of the church couldn&#x27;t start for several more years, in which the architects finalized their plans, as the size of the church and the dimensions grew. The decision process occurred amidst political turmoil, the Yugoslav kingdom became a royal dictatorship in 1929, the Croatian politician Stjepan Radić was killed in parliament 1928 and King Alexander was assassinated in Marseilles, France in 1934, and the idea of integral &quot;Yugoslavism&quot; died with him. Especially during the hot phase of the debate 1931–32 a paradox happened, after two years of royal dictatorship the state adopted a new constitution (3 September 1931), following a new ideological path to unitarization. At the same time, the pan-Yugoslavian theme in building the church of Saint Sava was dropped, and its function in the Serbian tradition was adopted by the Serbian clergy. By the time the church was to announce the new plans, integral Yugoslavism had been adopted as state ideology, with the parallel decision of the Serbian Orthodox Church, Saint Sava was to represent only Serbian Orthodox believers, a genuine and active counterreaction was established. This path had started immediately after Varnava took office in 1930, vocal support of Yugoslav national unity remained only declarative, as Yugoslavism was meant only in the context of Serbian supremacy and under a Serbian sign.

During the debate, some even pushed for the construction of the Vidovdan Temple instead. Especially vocal was art historian . He and his supporters opted for the &quot;Yugoslav, not Serbian Pantheon&quot;. They also rejected the Byzantine design, as it only symbolized &quot;one tribe&quot;. Meštrović supported Strajnić, insisting that the new &quot;Yugoslav style&quot; should be created, instead of the sacred architecture that would fit only one of the denominations. King Alexander Karađorđević publicly didn&#x27;t support any solution, but privately pushed for the Meštrović&#x27;s temple. The King was a major proponent of integral Yugoslavism and changed the state&#x27;s name to Yugoslavia. Meštrović, as the most important representative of the idea of the &quot;autochthonous Yugoslav art and architecture&quot;, was his favorite artist.
After the 1926–27 competition had no winner, the project remained dormant for three years. The &quot;Society for the Construction of the Church of Saint Sava on Vračar&quot; called the University of Belgrade in 1930 to delegate &quot;two specialists&quot; to join the Society and Nestorović in further elaborating on the design of the church. The faculty proposed two professors, Dragutin Ðorđević, from the architectural department of the Technical University, a known project engineer and Aleksandar Deroko, lecturer at the chair of Byzantine and Old Serbian Architecture. Meanwhile, only Aleksandar Deroko joined Bogdan Nestorović in the fulfilment of the task. Both architects were asked to submit separate new plans based to the new guidelines defined by the technical department of the &quot;Society for the Construction of the Church of Saint Sava on Vračar&quot;. On 1 and 2 January 1932 their definitive plans were published for the first time by the newspaper Politika. The plans appeared as images of plaster models for the future church. Both of the new models differed from the previous competition entries of Nestorovic and Deroko in 1927. In contrast to their sketches from 1927, when their entries differed markedly in silhouette, materials, composition and general appearance, the new proposals now looked very similar. References to the national tradition had vanished, neither of the two models was based in any way in design on the &quot;Morava&quot;-churches or Gračanica. The visual difference to the five year older proposals was even substantiated by the information in the accompanying text, where a 33 m measuring dome, which would dominate the church, was quoted. Without doubt the two similar plans had now been drafted authoritatively through the supervision of the society. The two authors acknowledged the Hagia Sophia. The similarity to the Hagia Sophia was apparent, and it did not stem from the authors&#x27; preferences, but from authoritative requirements which they had been asked to follow. The obligation set by Patriarch Varnava in 1930, that the church should be reminiscent of Byzantium was now, two years later, fixed in the newspapers&#x27; headlines, which stated the &quot;Style was set definitively to be Byzantine&quot;. Varnavas and the Society&#x27;s decision was uncompromising as the newspaper article stated: &quot;With the model of Mr. Nestorović and the model of Mr. Deroko, it was exactly hit what was asked for – the church has to be completely Byzantine, resembling Hagia Sophia in Constantinople&quot;.

After this revelation, the newspaper headlines alleged that the Society had deliberately and unexpectedly given &quot;the directive, that the church of Saint Sava should resemble the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople&quot; and that its plan was accepted as the definitive design of the church. This was never denied. Nor the two architects, who accepted their part which they were assigned to. With it, a transition from the 1926–27 guidelines had happened, as Byzantium was now the key element for the identity in which the church would be built.

The resulting final result in the design process was set in the concept of Nestorović whereto certain corrections should be made in collaboration with Alekandar Deroko, which had been decided even before their two models were presented to the public. With this combination, both architects were to make the final blueprint. Despite the publicly announced models not being the final blueprint of the church, the accompanying newspaper text had announced them as the final appearance, which caused an avalanche of negative reactions in the public and among experts. The dispute from a sequence of opinions published by the newspaper Vreme started on 23 January 1931.

After the king dropped his earlier veto on the decision to stop the further planning on the church, the opposing Club of Architects dropped its critical campaign after they were invited to the patriarch. A critical stage of further work occurred in an unstable society from 1932 to 1935. National antagonisms increased and the state saw nine different governments. Under such circumstances the planned church became even more Byzantized, it became a symbol of a political identity and not only an esthetic and stylistic predilection of its planners. The stylistic transformation of its plans to the imperialistic architectural narration is a testimony to the phenomenon which by far surpassed questioning architecture per se and is a mirror to social and political contexts of the state. With it, the episode during which the church was debated, it bears conclusive witness to the drama behind the international political life of Yugoslavia.

==== Synthetic redraft and invocation of Hagia Sophia ====

With the invocation of Justinian&#x27;s Hagia Sophia the size of the church was even larger than that called for in the initial competition. As they developed their project, Nestoroviċ and Deroko reflected the growing enthusiasm of one part of the population that wanted Belgrade to have one of the largest Orthodox churches in the world. The size, height and weight of the dome were meant to surpass the grandeur of Hagia Sophia. From the initially planned 60 x 60 m, the church had now grown to a square of 80 x 90 m and could hold 10.000 instead of 6.000 worshippers. The diameter of the dome had much enlarged and was to compete with some of the great domed cathedrals of late antiquity, renaissance, baroque and the historicism epoch. As thus the only reference for the synthetic redraft of the Nestorović/Deroko design came from the Hagia Sophia, which possessed a dome that initially had a diameter of 33 m. As it had been the cathedral of the capital city of the Byzantine Empire, its design was naturally imposed on the Belgrade Cathedral, as it was more appropriate for its urban context, than were the minor monastic churches of rural areas. With it, the idea to orient to national tradition was abandoned. This decision was highly criticised by public opinion, but not by the professional public, which didn&#x27;t find many arguments for the proposal of building such a great church on the basis of the national tradition. The homogeneity of the interior space had come into consideration, which had been so successfully accomplished in the universally acclaimed Hagia Sophia. With the evolution of the model, Nestorović synthesized this with the proposal of Deroko into a final model, which resembled the dimensions of the Hagia Sophia and paraphrased several of its architectural achievements, but had created an interior space of its very own. It had a strictly centrally planned design with four apses which create a very dense, spacious and yet intimate interior. 
As Branko Pešić, who continued the building after the long building ban, described it in 1988:

The adoption of the &quot;Hagia Sophia&quot; was led by impulses from western academic circles and literature, above all French and German, which acknowledged the Byzantine tradition in the rationality of construction from which followed spatial clarity, shown in a logical visually apparent image of the constructive system in the building structure.

Since the beginning of the development of the scholarly discipline of architectural history in Serbia, St. Sophia has been referred to as a superior realization, equivalently in the importance of its constructive solution, structure and spatial effects. This was reasonably a reverberation of the global presentation of this church, whose modern life, from the beginning of the middle of the 19th century, became surprisingly dynamic and complex. The magnetic attraction of its architectural solution boosted towards the end of the 19th century and reached its highest amplitude in Serbia in the interwar years. Owing to its architectural uniqueness, St. Sophia is often regarded as a structure without examples and imitation, though the Justinianian church remained an &quot;archetype-building&quot; - and not in the context of its place in Byzantine architecture, rather as symbol of Byzantine cultural authenticity and partly superiority - from which it gained in importance in the narratives in the relationship between the Byzantine and Serbian identities and in the parentologic metaphor of the link between Byzantium and the medieval Serbian state.

=== Construction ===

Forty years after the initial idea, construction of the church began on 10 May 1935, 340 years after the burning of Saint Sava&#x27;s remains. The cornerstone was laid by Metropolitan Gavrilo of Montenegro, (the future Serbian Patriarch Gavrilo V). The project was designed by Aleksandar Deroko and Bogdan Nestorović, aided by civil engineer Vojislav Zađina. The work lasted until Second World War Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941.

The church&#x27;s foundation had been completed, and the walls erected to the height of 7 and 11 meters. After the 1941 bombing of Belgrade, work ceased altogether. The occupying German army used the unfinished church as the Wehrmacht&#x27;s parking lot, while in 1944 the Red Army, and later the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army used it for the same purpose. After that, it was used for storage by various companies. The Society for Building of the Church ceased to exist and has not been revived. Children who grew up in the vicinity, including the future President of Serbia Boris Tadić, didn&#x27;t know the intended purpose of the unfinished construction, so they played inside thinking it was a ruin of an old castle. The granite slabs, intended for the construction of the church, were used for the building of the Tomb of People&#x27;s Heroes in 1948, in the Kalemegdan section of the Belgrade Fortress.

==== Construction ban ====
After the end of World War II, the building site was closed due to the changing political situation and the dominant ideological position of communism in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

Soon after the war, the material and financial possibilities to resume construction were dim. The communist elite identified themselves as atheists and rejected the request of the Serbian Orthodox Church to build the site. The unfinished building was transformed to a playground and even various circus troupes used it for their purposes.

Despite decades of efforts by the Serbian Patriarch German to continue building (and after he made 88 requests from 1958 onwards, of which 82 were sent to the President of Yugoslavia Josip Broz Tito, to which Tito never personally replied) all of them were rejected by government authorities. Permission was finally granted in 1984 when the patriarch was invited to Dušan Čkrebić, President of Presidency of Serbia.

1948 saw the closing of the association to support the building of Saint Sava, her duties were transferred to the board of the patriarchy. In 1953 all belongings of the association to build Saint Sava were confiscated by the Secretary of the Interior Ministry via the decree 2/3-11.855. Even the existing foundation walls were seized and transferred to the people&#x27;s property.
The decree never arrived at church authorities. Despite this, the church took legal action to counter the nationalisation of its property. In 1962 they were told by the Bureau of Religious Affairs that nationalized property can not be returned to church.

After German had been named Patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church in 1958, he personally championed the issue. During his term of office it was one of his main concerns to commence with construction. He sent every month a titular bishop to the mayor of Belgrade, to request the removal of garages and all non-religious objects. After this was achieved, 88 requests were sent to various government agencies, who sent him from &quot;pillar to post&quot;, from the lowest state agencies to regional authorities, the agencies of the city and executive organs of Serbian and Yugoslav governments.

On 28 April 1966, the synod of the Serbian Orthodox church was offered by the president of the executive chamber of the Serbian government, Dragim Stamenković, to roof foundation walls and transform them into a church museum or a fresco gallery. As they were aware that no better offer would arrive, they agreed to transform it temporarily into a church museum, but rejected the fresco museum proposal. After that, the communist leader outplayed them, as the communist rulers declared that the church had consented to transfer the decision-making regarding all problems related to Saint Sava to the executive chamber of the Socialist Republic of Serbia. The church even received a changed record of their meeting, as it read that the church had agreed that the locality was to become a &quot;museum of church antiquities&quot; and &quot;fresco gallery&quot; under state supervision. The church, recognising its marginalisation, withdrew its consent and repeatedly demanded to build the planned church. Émigré circles were approached for financial support, which the government dismissed. After the Serbian National Library was erected before the entrance of the building, the church was asked by the president of the Serbian Parliament Dragoslav Draža Marković to relocate its property.

A sudden turn came after Dušan Čkrebić was elected president of the Serbian Collective State Presidency in May 1984. He decided to use a legal loophole. The decision to ban the construction came from the top of the Communist party, and had a status of &quot;political stand&quot; which no one challenged for decades. It was never published by any state, political organ, nor was printed in the State Gazette. Therefore, no changing or abolishing old decrees, or bringing a new one, was needed. He consulted numerous political figures, including President of the Assembly of Serbia Slobodan Gligorijević, secretary-general of the Serbian League of Communists Ivan Stambolić and Slobodan Milošević, then head of the city Communist organization. No one objected, except for the veteran&#x27;s organization branch in Vračar.

So, on 19 June 1985, Čkrebić informed German and all the members of synod the church had the full right to build Saint Sava as planned on the foreseen place, saying later that he felt this was his &quot;civilizational obligation&quot; and &quot;removal of shame from his generation&quot;. Čkrebić suggested to not make his decision public to avoid any counter action and restart work without notifying public. Suddenly all the functionaries, even those in highest positions, which had previously rejected the church building had implicitly tolerated the decision of their younger comrades and remained supportive. Naturally this decision was received as a media bomb and became a public sensation.

On 12 May 1985, 100,000 people gathered in Belgrade to celebrate with the Serbian Patriarch and twenty bishops a liturgy inside the walls of Saint Sava. Still a part of a communist country, the event marked one of the historic turning points that symbolised the fall of communism in Europe. It was a turning point not only for the building of Saint Sava, but also for the demise of the political concept that lay behind the state atheism of communist Yugoslavia. The rising of the building also marked the return of religion to Yugoslavia.

==== Resumption of work ====

Architect Branko Pešić was selected as the new architect of the church. He revised the original plans in order to make better use of new materials and building techniques. Construction of the building began again on 12 August 1985. The original design project proposed a structure composed of masonry and partly reinforced concrete. The state of the existing foundations was learned after detailed investigative work. The four central bell towers were founded on 532 &quot;Simplex&quot; piles, 6 m in depth. The massive perimeter walls are laid on strip foundation 4 m in depth. The quality of the various materials used, i.e. brick, concrete, reinforcement, marble, etc. had been established through investigative work. Detailed survey of the existing structure, the as-built outlines were determined, and served as a starting point for further design and construction work.

From the resumption of construction, the building was re-planned to use a very high level of assembling methods of all parts of the static system, although the complex geometrical shapes of the building made it necessary to use some new and unique methods. As the building was built from pre-assembled concrete slabs, a technological model had to be implemented to provide parallel works, secure quality and build economically. With innovation in the building procedure, the speed of &quot;assembling&quot; the building could be greatly enhanced. Construction was resumed on the level of the original design which used a combination of brick and concrete was cancelled. These lower levels were preserved with the foundation structure, which had to be repaired. The four-wing section had to be separated from the central part by way of expansion joints. Tying up of the foundations, the existing part and the new structure of forthcoming stages were achieved with reinforced concrete columns and tie-beams. Expansion joints in the wing sections were carried out along the line of intersection between the semi-domes and the main arches, and vertically down the bell towers up to the foundations.

The continued construction was designed as a fully prefabricated reinforced concrete element structure. From the geometrically complicated form in view of its structural points, the single elements had to be broken down into precast components outlined with straight lines to the greatest possible extent. Walls had been designed as hollow boxes, which, when assembled, give the building its massive appearance.

All arched shapes of the galleries and vaults were transformed into assemblies of elements curved into two dimensions, which, having been erected, formed three-dimensional shapes. The semi-domes and the dome have been linearized by designing a system of arched trusses and two layers of curved decking. The precast parts were bound into a whole by in-situ cast parts of the structure which provided the required safety and longevity of the building.

The bell towers were initially started as a combination of brick and concrete columns and were continued as concrete box-structures for providing the greatest possible resistance of the towers and the least possible weight. This part of the building was completed by applying the sliding shuttering method (slip-form), with the advantages of prefabrication.

The central part of the building includes four main arches between the bell towers and the central dome with the pendentive underneath and the dome on top. Each arch spans 24 m, which is one of the widest vault spans achieved, as most of the European great domes rest on 8 or 16 pillars. Only Hagia Sophia&#x27;s dome rests on only four pillars with a span between the arches reaching 31 m. It is still the widest span between the arches of any historical sacral building and still the biggest dome which was erected on only four pillars.

It was found that the type of foundation chosen in the initial design lacked adequate strength to carry the loads imposed from the whole building. With the new materials and design methods, weight was reduced by 30-40 %. Before the lifting of the main dome the &quot;Simplex&quot; piles below the main tower-column had to be improved for carrying gravity and other loads. The foundation pile was partly replaced. While the initial foundation were only 6 m deep, the new ones with 1,4 m diameter reached a depth of 17 m and reached solid rock.

The structural analyses were made with dynamic calculation models using the &quot;TABS&quot; model from Berkely University. All the dimensioning of the elements was done in accordance with European and Yugoslav codes. For the lifting procedures, instruments were placed into the structures to compute the data collected which were analysed by computers. All relevant data was monitored live during the lifting of the heavy assembled elements of the main arches, pendentif and the main dome. Deflection, jack&#x27;s strokes, leveling of supports, deformations and stresses of main elements were analysed.

==== Lifting of the dome ====

The greatest achievement of the construction process was lifting of the 4,000 ton central dome, which was built on the ground, together with the copper plate and the cross, and later lifted onto the vaulted arches. The lifting, which took 20 days with the specially constructed hydraulic machines, was finished on 26 June 1989.

Before the dome could be lifted, the four main arches had to be brought into place. The four arches are the elements linking the bell towers both physically and in terms of communication. All four pairs of arches were very successfully lifted and fixed into position between January and June 1988. On the outer arches, which belong to the wing section, the semi-domes were formed, each consisting of eight curved, reinforced concrete trusses covered with curved slab decking. The assembly of the arches was done on the ground from pre-fabricated slabs, with their weight of 4000 kN each, they were lifted with &quot;chains&quot; to their intended position. The lifting of heavy loads to great heights was remarkably easily achieved, which as an innovation was a completely new system especially designed for the building. The chains were tested against safety factor of overloading between 1.6 and 2.2. As the expansion-joint arch rests &quot;hanging&quot; from chains in the lifted position, its own columns had to be subsequently cast underneath. They were then relaxed and together with the columns, form a framed system in a &quot;portal&quot; configuration. As the arches are major elements in the structural safety of the dome, they were analyzed in detail in all stages of static live, both in terms of stresses and deflections. The dimensions of the arches were reduced, optimized, so that the resulting structure could become as light as possible for technological purposes, and at the same time strong enough for the lifespan of the building.

The main work was the heavy-assembly-pushing technology in the raising of the main dome. The dome, weighing 4000 tonnes, was lifted by pushing. For the, dome the main gallery, spanning 39,5 m in diameter, which bears the dome and connects to the four bell-towers was prefabricated inside the central square. It sat as a monolith on gravel embankment of 120 cm height.

As thus it could be completed in one phase with the supporting gallery, the dome and the cross and copper covering. Works began in November 1988 and assembly was finished at the end of February 1989. The main dome was assembled from 24 curved, reinforced concrete trusses with two layers of decking forming outer skins around either flanges of the trusses. The bottom decking was intended for mosaic ornament on the inner surface of the dome. The electro-hydraulic lifting equipment prescribed by KMG &quot;Trudbenik&quot; was designed and delivered by the Hydraulic and Pneumatic equipment and devices factory &quot;Prva Petoletka&quot;.

The assembly-lifting of the dome structure, with completely executed copper covering works and cross, weighing from the ground up to the designated position at +40,09 m was done at speeds restricted to 2,5 m/day for safety reasons. With a hydraulic integral lifting power of ca. , proportional serve-valves as well as strike and pressure pickup was done on all four reactive supports simultaneously. Computers led the unity lifting, vertical stepping of 110 mm in one step was realized by application of reinforced concrete slab-cribbing in all reactive supports by robots, which were successively placed under the jacks of the dome. Lifting to 13 m was done with supports passing by the bell-towers in order not to destroy the columns of the galleries. From there, the equipment and support steel (pi shaping) girder were moved into the slits which were left intentionally during the slip-forming of the columns. For each day, casting had to be done in situ around the cribbing slabs in order to finalize 2,5 m of columns per day. The columns were stiff enough for 2,5 m and lifting was restricted to five hours a day.

Over 280 electronic elastomers were placed throughout the dome and its elements, all hydraulic components, were supplied by measurement instruments on information about jack&#x27;s stroke and jack pressure which were fed to a specially designed computer to control the automatic lifting operation. A fully independent outside electronic leveling system was attached to the computer control, which secured the exact levelling information, and could stop the lifting operation in case of mislevelling greater than 5 mm. One of two working Pc-At clones was collecting and monitoring of over 24 essential data during the performance operation which was finished without mistakes.

The last lifting operations were performed at level +39,69 m, while the top of the dome had reach approximately 80 m in elevation. With the lifting method no risky and complicated assemblies were necessary at this height. All the covering works of the copper sheet on wooden basis and the cross had been performed in March and April, while the dome was still on the ground.

After the lifting of the dome, the pendentive was assembled again at ground level underneath the main dome. It represents the transitional tie element through which the rectilinear plan of the church naos changes to the circular plan of the main dome. With the lifting of the pendentive, the central part of the church was rounded off.

The structural connection between the pendentive and the main dome supports the dome in four positions. It was done by means of hydraulic jacks capable to produce 3000 kN each (12.000 kN in total). The pendentive will suffice for later additional loads from applied mortar, mosaic cladding and marble cladding on the facade.

The pendentive was lifted again by chains. The weight of the pendentive, about 1100 Mp, spanning in perpendicular direction 24*24 m and 14 m height was lifted to 28 m beneath the main dome. This was achieved during two days at the end of January 1990. It was lifted in 36 hours, with speeds at 2,0 m/h. It reached an accuracy within the prescribed technological design with 5 cm tolerance.

With this work the structural part of the church was finished.

==== Interruption of works ====
After the NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999, the works were halted again. Patriarch Pavle, known for his asceticism, thought that such an expensive works are inappropriate when people are beaten and impoverished. After becoming a prime minister in 2001, Zoran Đinđić talked with patriarch and convinced him to continue the works.

==== Final works ====

, the exterior of the church was complete. The bells and windows had been installed, and the façade completed. The Russian Academy of Arts under the guidance of Nikolay Aleksandrovich Mukhin is currently working on the internal decoration. On 22 February 2018, during the presentation of the new internal decoration, the decorated cupola was donated to the Serbian Orthodox Church.

== Financing ==
The financing of the church was accompanied by many problems. During the initial building phase 1935 to 1941 financing was secured through a public association and donations from the king. From 1985 to 1999 public donations and collections were the only available resources. In 2001 Zoran Đinđić reinstalled the association for the construction of the church which worked from 2002 on. In 2004 the exterior of the church would be completed. Greek donations financed the facade, for which marble slabs from the same country were installed. In 2004 Boris Tadiċ took the chair of the association, and at the end of 2004 help from the Russian Orthodox Church was asked for the finalization of the interior. A fundraising event was held at the Cathedral of Christ the Savior in Moscow, where the Russian Patriarch Alesej II welcomed Serbian president Tadić and Patriarch Pavle. The concretization of the interior works were discussed with Zurab Tseretelli 2009, In 2009, Russian president Dmitri Medvedev visited the church, asked if Russia was willing to finance part of the interior decoration he replied: &quot;why only a part, when we could do all&quot;?. Vladimir Putin&#x27;s first visit to the church in March 2011 secured his personal patronage for mosaic works. Patriarch Irenj, asked by Putin&#x27;s who would decorate the interior, answered &quot;with God&#x27;s help, we will do it and with Your support&quot; – Putin replied &quot;budet&quot; (&quot;it will be&quot;). State agreement was signed in Moscow 19 March 2012, a presidential decree Pr-1197 from 9 April 2011 enabled holding of a competition for the mosaics. From 2005 the Pošta Srbije collected funds through charity stamps worth 10 Dinar with every item of correspondence. The Serbian government also financed works with budgetary funds. As for 2019, approximately 100 million Euros had been spent on the church: for mosaics 40 million Euros, for other works in the interior 10 million, for the exterior construction approximately 50 million. This totalled roughly 100 million. Of these, 40 million came from government funds, Russia donated 10 million, and the rest was paid through private donations.

=== Exterior ===
==== General information ====

The church is centrally planned edifice, having the form of a Greek Cross. It has a large central dome supported on four pendentives and buttressed on each side by a lower semi-dome over an apse. Beneath each semi-dome is a gallery supported on an arcade. The general concept is heavily based on the Hagia Sophia. Its main construction idea stems from the central square beneath the dome, it is closely related to the geometry used by Isidore of Miletus and Anthemius of Tralles. The central square in both churches has sidelines of 31 m, resulting in domes with approximately the same diameter (the dome of Hagia Sophia is slightly larger as it extends by approximately 0,5 the central square). The main differences in the dome structure is the high tambour in Saint Sava and that it is double-shelled. The low dome of Hagia Sophia was designed as calotte in which base 40 windows were set. As thus, both domes are built on pendentives at 40 m height, the dome of Saint Sava is approximately 10 m higher (54 to 67 m). The naos of the church is 46 m wide and 46 m long. The space behind the iconostasis will not be public, it is 21,80 wide and 17 m long. The church interior has on three sides narthexes of which two have 9 m depth and 31,70 m width. Within the north and south narthex two small chapels will be created. The narthex to the main entrance in the west is 2 m longer and has four more columns than the other two. Above the narthexes are three galleries with the one of the west side assigned to the church choir. As of 2019 the marble iconostasis is in work and will have six main icons and three doors. On the left and right sides of the iconostasis are bishopric seats.

The dome is high, while the main gold-plated cross is another high, which gives a total of to the height Church of Saint Sava. The peak is above the sea level ( above the Sava River); therefore the church holds a dominant position in Belgrade&#x27;s cityscape and is visible from all approaches to the city.

The church is long from east to west, and from north to south. It is tall, with the main gold-plated cross extending for more. Its domes have 18 more gold-plated crosses of various sizes, while the bell towers have 49 bells of the Austrian Bell Foundry &quot;Grassmayr&quot;.

The church has a bigger floor area than Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow, which covers 3980 m2, compared to 4500 m2 of Saint Sava. Saint Sava is also longer 91 m vs 77,7 m and wider 81 m vs 72,42 m, it also has a bigger diameter of its dome 30,5 m vs 25 m. The dome of the Moscow cathedral is higher so, 77,37 m vs 103,4 m. Interestingly, both cathedrals resemble the Hagia Sophia in its structural design, they&#x27;ve been designed based on the arrangement of the central square in the Hagia Sophia. Thus they exemplify the importance of the imperial Byzantine church for main edifices in Orthodox sacral architecture.

On the inspiration that was drawn from Hagia Sophia, Deroko noted that two guiding principles were followed in designs for the Church of Saint Sava – the imperative of functionality of planning, and the monumentality of space and form. Looking back at the start of construction, Deroko commented on the challenges of designing a functional space for 10.000 people, which was done with reference to the architects&#x27; data, the seminal handbook by Ernst Neufert. He also noted information about the thirty-metre diameter of the dome, making an obviously important comparison with the dome of Hagia Sophia. Although the size of Saint Sava is not necessarily associated with monumentality in Deroko&#x27;s opinion, the appearance and size of the St. Sava&#x27;s church greatly mattered as it was to be a monument of national importance.

==== Dome ====

The dome of Saint Sava is built in the classical style as a compound dome with four pendentives from a sphere of greater radius than the dome. It has an inner diameter of 30,50 m and an outer of 35,15 m, resembling the dimensions of the Hagia Sophia (it had initially a realized diameter of 33 m). The dome rests on four 40 m-high vaults, the square of the central space below the dome is 39,72 m wide and occupies 1.578 m2. The double-shelled dome is 27 m high and reaches to 67 m on the outside and on its inner side to 64,56 m height. Thus the dome of Saint Sava is slightly higher than its archetype of the Hagia Sophia (56 m). The dome supports a cross weighing four metric tonnes and 12 m height (including its not visible base). Its visible part is 10 m.

After the Hagia Sophia, the dome of Saint Sava is the biggest in any Orthodox church. The celebrated dome of the Hagia Sophia, built by Isidore of Miletus and mathematician Anthemius of Tralles, was initially at 33 m which was reconstructed from the mathematical formulas used by its Byzantine architects. Today, after having been rebuilt three times, it has an elliptic form with the diameters 31.24 m and 30.86 m.

Among all Christian religious buildings, the pendentive domes of Hagia Sophia (33 m, initially realized diameter), St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral (30.8 m), Florence Cathedral (43 m), St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica (42 m), Berlin Cathedral (30.7 m), and Primatial Basilica of the Blessed Virgin Mary (33 m) have larger or approximately the same inner diameters to Saint Sava&#x27;s. Other than Hagia Sophia, none of them were built on four piers and with four vaults. Among the mentioned domes, Saint Sava&#x27;s has 24 m-wide vaults, only surpassed by Hagia Sophia&#x27;s (31 m). The much bigger dome of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica has main vaults of only 23 m.

If compared to the biggest domes realised in Orthodoxy, Saint Sava surpasses by large the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow, whose dome has 29.8 m (outer) and 25 m (inner) diameters, the Kronstadt Naval Cathedral with 29.8 m (outer) and 26.7 m (inner) diameters and the Saint Isaac&#x27;s Cathedral in Saint Petersburg with 25.8 m (outer) and 21.8 m (inner) diameters.

In addition to its big diameter, the dome of Saint Sava has significant interior height as well. With 65 m (from the floor to the ceiling) it is the fourth-tallest dome (by interior height) of Orthodox Christianity, surpassed only by the domes of People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral in Bucharest (104 m), Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow (69.5 m) and Saint Isaac&#x27;s Cathedral in Saint Petersburg (69 m).

The dome of Saint Sava also ranks among the tallest domes in the world.

==== Cross ====

The design of the cross is a blend of the conception of the sculptural ideas of Nebojša Mitrić, who was of Jewish descent and a survivor of the Holocaust, and the architectural ideas of Branko Pešić. The 12 m high, 5 m wide and 4 tonnes weighing cross was worked in the organization Modul, it was finished in Prva Iskra, Barić, where Mitrić oversaw the works. Afterwards it was transported to the building-site. Here it was put in a special hangar, where it could be gold-plated. The gold plating was done by Sava and Dragomir Dimitrijević, who did the gold plating for all 18 crosses of the church.

The cross was lifted in May 1989 prior to the lifting of the dome to its presumed location, which was achieved in only 15 minutes. After the cross became visible on the city scape, the media criticised its modernistic design. Mitrić and Pešić used a minimalistic approach, which was not to everyone&#x27;s taste. But most criticism stemmed from the invocation of the four S, symbolizing a Serbian Heraldic Cross, which was in former Yugoslavia seen as a symbol only of Serbdom. After the attacks, Mitrić, who lost his whole family in the Holocaust committed suicide on 23 August 1989. Later the cross became one of the most copied crosses in the Serbian Orthodox Church and is commonly referred as Sava&#x27;s Cross. Like Mitrić&#x27; previous works, which were famous for their miniature sculpturing (i.e. the medals for the Winter-Olympics 1984 in Sarajevo), the cross&#x27; elegance and harmonic shape with a minimalistic conception in the main emblems were unique.

==== Facade ====
The facade of the church was mainly executed in white marble. It covers 12.000 m2. The polished Grecian Volakas marble from Kavalla took 14 months to install. Cornices are made of red Balmoral granite from Finland. It covers 120 m2 on the dome and the half-domes. The pedestal is made of 80 m2 black Jablanica granite from Bosnia. The stones in the facade weigh 3.000 tonnes.

=== Interior ===
==== General information ====
The interior with naos, three side arms and the altar has a surface area of on the ground floor, with three galleries of on the first level, and a gallery on the second level. The church can hold 10,000 faithful. The choir gallery seats 800 singers. The basement contains a crypt, the treasury of Saint Sava, and the grave church of Saint Lazar the Hieromartyr, with a total surface of .

The church will offer a permanent exhibition about the construction of the church, a bell information gallery and one that informs on the life of Saint Sava. At the northeastern and southeastern pillar, two elevators are being installed to reach the dome galleries. The northern and southern entrance halls have baptism fonts, a third at gallery level is on the northern side of the altar.

The material of the sixteen great columns in the choir were imported from Italy in 1939. The capitals are made of Carrara marble, the columns by green marble from Baveno. The motifs of the capitals were designed by Aleksandar Deroko and were largely executed by Josif Grassi before WW II.

The main iconostasis is made of iron trusses on which slabs of Carrara marble will be installed. The whole construction of the approximately 20 metre-wide iconostasis will weigh 100 tonnes. It will be decorated with mosaic icons. Work on the iconostasis as of August 20, 2020 was in progress. It will consist of one row of icons.

The great central wheel chandelier () is the main circular lightning device of the church and will be cast in bronze. With a diameter of 20 m, it will weigh approximately 14 tonnes. The chandelier in Saint Sava will be the greatest and heaviest of the world. The author of the chandelier is Nikolaj Mukhin, who also designed the mosaic decoration in the church. It will be decorated with wooden icons. The chandelier at 7.5 m above the floor basement in the circular space below the dome will be attached with 12 suspension chains to anchors in the church walls. With its decoration of stylized ornaments it will be reminiscent of the Serbian of the Middle Ages for which Serbian kings had been royal patrons. The two who at least were commissioned by royal patrons are those from Dečani Monastery in Kosovo and Metohija and Markov Monastery near Skopje which have been preserved until today.

==== Mosaics ====
===== Political implementation =====
Information on Russian interests to contribute to the mosaic cladding became public during the 2009 visit of the director of the Russian Academy of Arts, Zurab Tsereteli, to the church. Gazprom Neft was mentioned as sponsor. 2011 saw a state visit of Vladimir Putin during which he announced financial contribution to the mosaics. First assessments showed that 30 million Euros would be necessary for having all the interior done in mosaic cladding. An initial donation of 4 million from Gazprom Neft allowed first stage works in the dome to start. Gazprom deployed a representative to the meetings of the Russian Academy. The central meeting discussing the implementation of works was held on 13 November 2015 in Belgrade. Rossotrudnicestvo and its director, Lubov Nikolaevna Glebova, the designated Russian representative for the interior decoration, were present, as were the president of Serbia and its minister of foreign affairs.
A second tranche over 5 million Euros was guaranteed personally by Vladimir Putin on 17 January 2019 during his visit to the church.
===== Competition =====

Putin advised a decrete, Pr-1197, 29 April 2011 that a state competition could be held in Moscow for the interior mosaic decoration of the Sava Cathedral. It was followed by a state agreement between the ministries of foreign affairs of Russia and Serbia on 19 March 2012. A competition with 50 entries was held in the gallery of the Russian Academy in Moscow, ul. Prechistenka 19, on 23 September 2014. On 5 October 2014, the work of Nikolay Aleksandrovich Mukhin was declared the best. His project was presented to the president of Serbia, the Serbian minister of foreign affairs and the bishop Amfilohije as the representative of the Serbian Orthodox church. Mukhin had chosen the classical Byzantine gold mosaics of the palaiologeen epoch of the 12th century as his inspiration.

===== Authors =====
Authors of the mosaics are Nikolay Aleksandrovich Mukhin (Николай Александрович Мухин, *1955), who composed the frescoes in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow, and his fellow Yevgeniy Nikolayevich Maksimov (Евгений Николаевич Максимов, *1948), director of the department of painting at the Russian Academy of Arts in Moscow. The authors scaled a model of the dome at 1:10 in the Russian Academy, which was later installed in the Russian Embassy in Belgrade. Mukhin visited the church for the first time 1994 in official company of Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow who held service with Patriarch Pavle. Alexy returned in 1999 during the bombardment of Yugoslavia. Mukhin later worked in Serbia in various church decorations from 2002. Prior to Saint Sava, his main work in Serbia was the decoration of the church in Ub (Crkva Vasnesenja Hrista) which had to be built anew after an earthquake shook the Kolubara basin in 1998 and where he worked from 2003. He then was a member of the board of cultural advisors to Putin, whom he had known since the early 2000s. Mukhin has painted 18 churches worldwide, four of them in Serbia, despite being a Russian painter, Mukhin stated that he tries to paint close to the culture that the church belongs to. He explained that in 1994 his first idea came to decorate Saint Sava. As the church encloses an immense space, he stated that for him a golden decoration was the only possibility and that it signified the Transfiguration of Jesus. His main task, he said, was to make the church interior shine from its golden surfaces, he as author saw it as symbol to transfiguration. The impression of the light as a medium of sacral illustration will also be enhanced by illumination of certain scenes according to the church calendar. An impulse in the lighting will change from warm to cool tones, dependent on the religious feast. The smelt of the Tessara was made in Moscow and for the golden and silver Tesserae, pure gold and silver were used. Despite having worked in the Moscow Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, the task in decorating Saint Sava was of different magnitude, as the dome and size of scenes are much larger and the artistic media more complex.

===== Structural implementation =====
Realization of the mosaic works began on 28 September 2016 with the visit of Hilarion, director of the church Foreign Office in the Moscow Patriarchate and chairman of the Russo-Serbian commission at the Russian Academy. Zurab Tsereteli, Nikolaj Mukhin, Yevgeniy Maksimov and the acting director to the support of UNESCO, Manana Popova, presented the approved scale model.
The first seating of the commission for the mosaic works took place on 17 March 2017 in the Moscow atelier where the mosaic artwork was created.

Zurab Tsereteli as the coordinator of the artistic works expressed his gratitude to the authors at this first meeting. All mosaics were commissioned in the Moscow atelier in their original size, then cut and transported to Belgrade. The first ten tonnes of mosaics arrived in Belgrade on 3 May 2017. With a working platform at 43 m in the church, the mosaics were lifted with a specially constructed elevator.

The artists of the mosaics were chosen from the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture in Moscow and the Repin Institute of Arts at the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg.

===== Decoration =====
The central mosaic in the dome depicts the Ascension of Jesus and represents Resurrected Christ, sitting on a rainbow and right hand raised in blessing, surrounded by four angels, Apostles and Theotokos. This composition is inspired by the mosaics in the main dome of St Mark&#x27;s Basilica in Venice. The lower sections are influenced by the Gospel of Luke and the first narratives of the Acts of the Apostles. The texts held by the angels are written in the Church Slavonic language, while the names of the depicted persons are written in Greek. The first indicates pan-Slavic sentiment while the latter connects it to the Byzantine traditions. The total painted area of the dome is .

It is one of the largest curved areas decorated with the mosaic techniques and when the work is completely finished, Saint Sava will be the 6th-largest church building in the world ornamented this way after St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Vatican City, the People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral in Bucharest (also unfinished), the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C., Primatial Basilica of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Esztergom and Berlin Cathedral. The mosaic was created for over a year in Russia, during 2016 and 2017. It was then cut and transported by special trucks to Belgrade. The total weight of the mosaic is 40 tons and it was placed on the dome from May 2017 to February 2018. The mosaic installed at the eastern wing section, the side of the altar covers 3,289 m2.

===== Materials used =====
The material for the tessera is produced by Smaltfactory in Moscow. The enterprise&#x27;s gold mosaics use pure gold (24k). It is reasonable to suggest that for approximately 400 tonnes of mosaic in total, that a great part of the costs comes from the price of precious materials. Beside pure gold, a great deal of the tessera also has pure silver in its content. The pure precious metal content prevents the materials from changing as time passes. Only pure gold&#x27;s natural colour is not changed by the high temperatures during the smelting process in the kiln. The highly reflective properties of the gold tessera and the differences of angles where the mosaics are installed will produce differences in reflection, a technique that is used to blur the background and constructive elements of a church&#x27;s interior.

==== Sculptures ====
Capitals and cornices show a variety of sculptures. The heraldic symbols of the Nemanjić-Dynasty are a dominant motif. Floral motifs and anthropomorphic figures are inspired by the rich sculptural tradition of the Morava school. The main author of the stone ornaments of the interior decoration was initially Aleksandar Deroko, whose plans were executed on all of the capitals at the columns between narthexes and naos and the altar apse. They were executed by the Swiss sculptor Josif Grassi prior to WW II. After the long delay during the communist period, the decorative work was overseen by Dragomir Acović and executed by Nebojša Savović Neš. A variety of different white marbles from Italy and Greece, green marbles from Italy, South America and India, dark and bright red marbles from Italy and India, yellow and greenish onyx, white limestone, red and white travertin and blue lapis lazuli. These decorative stones cover 1500 m2.

=== Plateau ===

Discontinuous construction over decades produced numerous mistakes, one of which is the surrounding of the church which remained unfinished and nonfunctional. The construction of the National Library in 1973 affected massively the originally envisioned 1926 design by Deroko and Nestorović. Three architectural design competitions for arranging the plateau which surrounds the church (Vračar or Saint Sava&#x27;s Plateau) were organized after World War II. One of the rejected but popular designs, Mihajlo Mitrović and Mario Jobst&#x27;s, was invoked. Using denivelation of the Bulevar Oslobođenja, they envisioned the wide pedestrian connection with the Park Milutin Milanković across the boulevard. Denivelation would also allow for two large garages one of which would be used by the church visitors. The square in front of the temple would have green areas on its rim, and would include the Alley of the Greats (with monuments to all major members of the medieval Nemanjić dynasty), while the section across the boulevard would be adapted into the green, children area.

==== 1990 project ====

On the fourth competition, organized in 1989, the project designed by architects Vladimir Macura and Đorđe Bobić was finally accepted in 1990. As with all the other aspects of the church construction, this one was controversial, too, as it was publicly criticized with disputes even reaching the courts of law. Citizens organized in groups and signed petitions against the project under the slogan &quot;We don&#x27;t want New Belgrade on Vračar, we want small Montmartre around the church&quot;. Construction finally began in 2003, and the works were ceremonially opened by prime minister Zoran Živković. The works were pushed in order to be finished by February 2004, for celebration of 200th anniversary of the First Serbian Uprising. The plateau covers some , of which was transformed into the park by 2010.

Bobić explained that the design was influenced by the Kalemegdan Park at Belgrade Fortress. Though it was envisioned by the church and politicians as the churchyard, the authors opted for public space, a green square, or even the park. This urban square was also envisioned as the ceremonial site of important events. The conceptualized &quot;walls&quot; of the square were the National Library on one side, and the Parochial Home (clergy house) and the planned Patriarchate Building on another. The building of the National library was designed by Ivo Kurtović and finished in 1973, while the Parochial Home, with facade of shining, white stone, is the work of Mateja Nenadović and his sons Miloš and Đorđe. The Patriarchate Building wasn&#x27;t built. When built, the Parochial Home was deemed especially problematic, including its location inside the planned green area. It was also deemed too big for its location while the Patriarchate Building, planned in its extension, was deemed even worse as it was to be three times larger. The old Church of Saint Sava remained dwarfed between the new church and the Parochial Home. The cubical design of the Parochial Home remained almost universally disliked.

The traffic around the church was rerouted, with all bordering streets becoming one-way in order to make circling the church possible. The bus stop for public transportation was envisioned in the Skerlićeva street, below the church, but the public transportation line was never established. A parking lot was built behind the library, but only for the library purpose. The architects reject the idea of a large garage, either above or below ground, as the regulation didn&#x27;t allow it at the time, plus, the authors believed that due to the nature of the object, people should come on foot anyway. Smaller underground garages, for Parochial Home and Patriarchate Building were planned, but never built. Krušedolska Street, along which the Patriarchate Building was planned, was to be expanded to become a &quot;major city thoroughfare&quot;. This never happened, but the avenue along the street was cut under the pretext of this plan. The traffic solution was also criticized as some urbanists stated that all of the small streets behind the church should become pedestrian zones, with galleries, coffee and sweet shops, artistic squares, souvenir shops, etc.

The physical churchyard and the public space are divided by the symbolical &quot;living fence&quot;, which consists only of columns, with spaces between. There is a ground floor fountain, made of glass and stone, which covers and is used as the pathway when not operational. The fountain is ornamented with lights. The entire square is used for walking, even the grassy areas, though there are relatively narrow pedestrian paths made of Jablanica marble. To enhance its &quot;friendly&quot; appearance. the plateau is completely flat, except for the mound with the Karađorđe Monument. Almost of earth was removed from the plateau to flatten it. The plan included the planting of 400 trees, but after the first ones began to dry soon, this was abandoned. The Russian Orthodox Church-donated statue of Saint Sava which was placed on the side facing the street bearing the saint&#x27;s name. There are two children&#x27;s playgrounds.

As the result of the accepted plan, even though the new buildings in Vračar and neighboring Neimar were to have only three floors, buildings with six or seven floors were allowed. Urban historians claim that this damaged the inherited urban tissue of Vračar and Neimar. Construction of tall buildings in the narrow, small streets destroyed the neighborhood&#x27;s ambiance and spirit.

==== 2020 project ====

In time, due to the lack of maintenance, the plateau had deteriorated. Among other things, numerous granite slabs, used for paving of the churchyard and the pathways, crumbled and fell out, leaving holes. Scandal broke out during the visit of Russian president Vladimir Putin in January 2019 because of the sloppy repairs by the city communal service. Instead of replacing the missing slabs, workers had even removed some more of them and created patches, filling the holes with asphalt concrete which became laugh of the town.

In January 2020, deputy mayor Goran Vesić announced a complete redesign of the plateau and the construction of the Patriarchate Building. The project was designed by architects Branislav Mitrović and Dejan Miljković. The project wasn&#x27;t adopted by the city or any experts&#x27; commission or jury, but by the Serbian Orthodox Church itself. The central pedestrian pathway is to be expanded and between the library and the new Patriarchate Building an artificial forest, partially growing out of the water, was to be planted. The existing fountain will be dismantled and the new one &quot;will not be a classical fountain&quot;. Though city officials claimed that there will be more green areas, from the officially presented architectural model it was obvious that there may be more trees, but less green areas overall. The first, smaller phase on the outskirts of the plateau were planned for October 2020, when the church should finally be finished.

The design was criticized by the Association of Serbian Architects. They stated that the planned “forest” would degrade the historical, symbolical and social importance by reducing the area to the profane city park. It was also noted that mass gatherings organized on the plateau (funeral processions for Patriarch Pavle and prime minister Zoran Đinđić, the visit of Russian president Vladimir Putin) showed that the area&#x27;s space is inadequate as it is. The massive Patriarchate Building, though planned from the start, is also deemed problematic. It is considered too big and robust for its location. It will also enclose the Krušedolska Street, the tenants in it, and obstruct the view from the street&#x27;s numerous cafés on the park which has a touristic value. There are calls for keeping the square-like shape of the present plateau or even expanding it as it basically functions as the extended, open-air narthex of the church and should have room for as many visitors as possible as the 1990 design only addressed local residents&#x27; needs, neglecting the area&#x27;s spiritual and religious character.

There were repeated calls for either an international or a domestic public design competition, instead of the clandestine process by which the church itself selected the design of public space.

=== Bells ===

The church has 49 bells. Four free-swinging bells are in the SW tower. The remaining 45 are part of a carillon, the only ones in the Balkans. All bells were manufactured at the Grassmayr Bell Foundry in Innsbruck, Austria. All bells have been paid for by private donations. The fourth-largest bell is dedicated to Zoran Đinđić during whose presidency the building of the church was restarted after the Yugoslav wars. The biggest bell is a donation of Svetislav Prlinčević for which 110.000 dollars were paid. The carillon plays regularly the hymn of Saint Sava.
== Criticism ==

The architecture of the church has been criticised in several ways through several epochs. It was especially debated after the second competition for Saint Sava in 1926–27, when no first prize was awarded, and after Patriarch Varnava assigned Bogdan Nestorović (1901–1975) in 1930 as winner of a second prize as principal architect to synthesise his plan with Aleksandar Deroko (1894-1988). The result was now asked to resemble the appearance of the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, which hadn&#x27;t been a requirement during the competition. The guidelines required an edifice in the Serbian tradition of the late medieval period under Stefan Lazar (i.e. the five-domed churches of the Morava monasteries). Nestorović&#x27;s own competition entry, based on the most-acclaimed achievement of Serbian medieval architecture, the katholikon of the Gračanica monastery, had also circumvented competition guidelines. Most of the 22 participants had deliberately chosen Hagia Sophia as inspiration. Few entries used modern designs with expressionistic features. Thus Hagia Sophia was the chosen archetype even during the official contest. Most Serbian critics considered this unfitting, as it was not in the national tradition. The universal sacral expression of the Hagia Sophia did albeit fit requirements in the heterogeneous Yugoslav state, which consisted of many different religions and nationalities.

After a criticism campaign started early 1932 in the newsletter Vreme, the most important art debate in the former Yugoslavia began to unfold. It led to the intervention of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia, who approved the reworked plans of Nestoroviċ and Deroko. Nestorović&#x27;s change of model from &quot;Gracanica&quot; to &quot;Hagia Sophia&quot; is attributed to the new demands of the king and the clerics. The architects had each to present a plaster model at 1:100 scale, that appeared on 6 and 7 January 1932 in the Politika newspaper. Later that year, a new design, the final model, was presented.

Even after this had been adopted, the debate continued. Especially modern art-critics, analyzing the ideological circumstances of the 1930 debate, labelled its appearance clumsy, non-inventive or a reproduction.

Ljubica Jelisavac, art historian and art critic from the University of Arts in Belgrade, noted that the criticism was primarily based on ideological differences between traditionalists and modernists. Thus the real architectural achievement of the building was left marginalized in the debate. It was not even a topic inside art critic and architecture circles, but it wasn&#x27;t omitted, that the decision to follow a traditionalistic design programme has been partly detrimental for architectural tendencies in Serbia in the interwar period.

Milica Ćeranić defended the architectural achievement and stylistical form. She stated that the well-proportioned and harmonic interior of the church is a result of a cohesion in designing the exterior and the interior. To achieve this, the architects used a rigorously centralized arrangement, which is especially known from early Christianity. The spheric and cubic elements are especially exponentiated - domes, exterior walls, shapes of openings, the stratification of facade surfaces, capitals and columns – with the excellent mastering of all these elements, apparent in their volume, a memorable impression is given.

She points to the fact that the greatest impression to the percipient lies in the gradual pyramidal composition of the structure, which starts harmoniously from its portals across the conchs and representatively culminates in the dome. Observable at all four sides of the wings, whereby the western, southern and northern are identical, this cascading of the masses is most interesting and has the strongest imprint on the east wing, the side of the altar. The apse is polygonal, or rather pentagonal, thereby showing on its upper surface five small conchs, which correspond to five conchs on the lower side of the east facade. Thereby a synchronized effect in the development of the masses is realized, which are linked in sophisticated wave-like structures, that break the monolithic, square-build forms of the rigid walls.

Italian art critic and professor of Architectural Design at Milan University, Pier Paolo Tamburelli, praised the building. He claimed that the building possesses an incredibly pure and dignified interior. With its large dome and with its four apses it has a unified and well-developed, profound and dense space. While based on classical examples, Tamburelli notes its own ferocity and gentleness which is expressed in the sensitivity to light. 

Tamburelli notes that he wonders if it would be possible to reproduce a theory capable of re-appropriating the resources that have been used to build Saint Sava, and whether it would be possible to find all necessary design techniques to build a construction theory on it, as its classical design layout was laid in subtle casts and shades of concrete slabs.

The church has been compared to Sagrada Familia because of their long-running construction phase and their cultural and artistic importance. And both churches have served for liturgy during their lengthy construction.

<text>The Novgorod Republic () was a medieval state that existed from the 12th to 15th centuries in northern Russia, stretching from the Gulf of Finland in the west to the northern Ural Mountains in the east. Its capital was the city of Novgorod. The republic prospered as the easternmost trading post of the Hanseatic League, and its people were much influenced by the culture of the Byzantines, with the Novgorod school of icon painting producing many fine works.

Novgorod won its independence in 1136 after the Novgorodians deposed their prince and the Novgorod &quot;veche&quot; began to elect and dismiss princes at its own will. The &quot;veche&quot; also elected the &quot;posadnik&quot;, who was the chief executive of the city, and the archbishop of Novgorod, subject to approval by the Russian metropolitan. The &quot;tysyatsky&quot; was also elected by the &quot;veche&quot;, who was originally the military commander, and served the interests of the common people. Novgorodian nobles known as boyars dominated the &quot;veche&quot;, and the offices of &quot;posadnik&quot; and &quot;tysyatsky&quot; remained in the hands of boyar families. The boyars also gave funding to the &quot;ushkuyniki&quot;, who contributed to the expansion of Novgorod&#x27;s trade and colonies in the north of European Russia.

By the 14th century, the prince of Moscow (who was almost always the grand prince of Vladimir) was usually the prince of Novgorod as well. As Moscow grew in power in the 15th century, Novgorod began to lose its autonomy. In a 1471 peace treaty with Moscow following the Battle of Shelon, Novgorod pledged allegiance to Moscow, with its system of government temporarily left intact. The end of the republic and the &quot;veche&quot; came in 1478 when Ivan III once again invaded and seized the city as part of his campaign to annex all other Russian states.

==Name==
The state was called &quot;Novgorod&quot; and &quot;Great Novgorod&quot; () with the form &quot;Sovereign Lord Novgorod the Great&quot; () becoming common in the 15th century. &quot;Novgorod Land&quot; and &quot;Novgorod volost&quot; usually referred to the land belonging to Novgorod. &quot;Novgorod Republic&quot; () itself is a much later term, although the polity was described as a republic as early as in the beginning of the 16th century. Soviet historians frequently used the terms &quot;Novgorod Feudal Republic&quot; and &quot;Novgorod Boyar Republic&quot;.

==History==
===Origins===

The area of Novgorod was populated by various East Slavic tribes that were constantly at war with one another for supremacy. However, these tribes came together during the beginning of the 9th century to try to form a negotiated settlement to end military aggression amongst each other. According to the legendary calling of the Varangians (recorded in diverging variations in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; and &quot;Novgorod First Chronicle&quot;), in the year 862, the Varangian brothers Rurik, Sineus and Truvor were each &quot;invited&quot; to reign in Novgorod, Beloozero, and Izborsk, respectively, in what is now in northwestern Russia. As a result, in Russian historiography, Novgorod is traditionally seen as the birthplace of the country&#x27;s monarchy. The &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; (PVL) states that when Oleg the Wise conquered Kiev (modern Kyiv) in 882, which marks the founding of Kievan Rus&#x27;, he ordered Novgorod to pay the Varangian princes in Kiev 300 &quot;grivny&quot; a year. In 1014, the PVL mentions this tribute had increased: &quot;When Yaroslav was in Novgorod, he paid two thousand &quot;grivny&quot; a year as tribute to Kiev, and another thousand was given to his garrison in Novgorod.&quot;

The &quot;Russian–Scandinavian cultural symbiosis&quot; became prevalent following the establishment of the Rus&#x27; state. The Novgorodians were the first to reach the regions between the Arctic Ocean and Lake Onega. Even though there is no definitive account of the precise timing of their arrival at the northern rivers that flowed into the Arctic, there are chronicles which mention that one expedition reached the Pechora River in 1032, and trading was established as early as 1096 with the Yugra tribes. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; mentions Novgorodians traveling &quot;beyond the portage&quot; as early as 1079. They also traveled to Pomorye, the &quot;summer [southern] coast&quot; of the &quot;Cold [White] Sea&quot; in search of furs as well as fish and salt. Historian George Lantzeff remarked that &quot;in the beginning of Russian history, two Russian principalities, Novgorod and Rostov-Suzdal, were engaged in exploring, conquering, exploiting, and colonizing the area west of the Ural Mountains&quot;. From the late 11th century, the Novgorodians asserted greater control over the determination of their rules, and rejected a politically dependent relationship to Kiev. The PVL claims that Novgorod ceased paying tribute to the Varangians at the death of Yaroslav the Wise (1054).

=== 12th century ===
Chronicles state that the Novgorodians paid tribute to the grand prince of Kiev by 1113. Some time after this, the administration of the principality seemed to have matured. The Novgorodian &quot;tysyatsky&quot; and &quot;posadniki&quot; appointed boyars from the cities and collected revenues for administration in the territories it held. A charter from the 1130s mentioned 30 administrative posts in the territory of Novgorod, where revenues were collected regularly and sent as a tithe to the Novgorod bishop. Throughout the 12th century, Novgorod utilized the Baltic-Volga-Caspian trade route, not only for trading but also for bringing food from the fertile Oka region to their city.

In 1136, the Novgorodians their prince Vsevolod Mstislavich, and over the next century and half, were able to invite in and dismiss a number of princes. However, these invitations or dismissals were often based on who was the dominant prince in Rus&#x27; at the time, and not on any independent thinking on the part of Novgorod.

Rostov-Suzdal comprised the territory of the important Oka region and lands along the vital Sheksna River. This river lay in the Northern Volga tributary region. Whoever controlled the river was able to block food supplies causing a famine in Novgorod. Perhaps due to these fears, Novgorod led a failed invasion of Suzdal in 1134. They tried again and succeeded in 1149. Alternatively, Novgorod, in a bid to appease Suzdal, accepted some Suzdalians as rulers of Novgorod. Despite these events, Suzdal still blocked off trade to Novgorod twice and intercepted Novgorod&#x27;s tributes.

=== 13th century ===
In 1228, there was a failed Novgorodian campaign against the Tavastians in present-day southern Finland, as reported in the &quot;Novgorod First Chronicle&quot; (NPL). The Novgorodian troops were disaffected by prince Yaroslav Vsevolodovich, a quarrel broke out within the army and the troops refused to fight. In the same year, Yaroslav tried to militarily overrun the rebellious town of Pskov (possibly because its throne was vacant), but the Pskovians closed their gates in time and denied him entry. Yaroslav retreated to Novgorod, claimed no ill will towards Pskov, but raised another army supposedly for the purpose of attacking Riga (a stronghold of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword). But the Pskovians distrusted him and allied with Riga instead, while the troop raising caused food prices in Novgorod to spike, stoking civil discontent against prince Yaroslav as well; opposition to the Suzdalian dynasty&#x27;s power grew amongst citizens of both Pskov and Novgorod. As they rejected support for his campaign against Riga, suspecting a ploy to seize Pskov along the way after the previous failed attempt, Yaroslav was forced to abandon his plans and disband his expensive army. When a bad harvest exacerbated the famine,the Novogorodians rose in revolt against the prince, who fled with his family and supporters to Pereslavl-Zalessky. With the Suzdalian princely threat gone, the Pskovians sent the Livonian auxiliaries home, while the &quot;veche&quot; elected Michael of Chernigov as Novgorod&#x27;s new &quot;knyaz&quot; in 1230. The NPL notes that in subsequent years, Pskov remained allied with Riga and the Rigans, and later Dorpat (modern Tartu) and Odenpäh (modern Otepää). Meanwhile, Yaroslav Vladimirovich, a son of the previous Pskovian prince sought to leverage his family ties with the bishops Hermann of Dorpat and Albert of Riga (died 1229) to gain his father&#x27;s throne. 
The famine in Novgorod continued, and in 1230, another popular revolt erupted against supporters of the brand new prince Michael of Chernigov, including &quot;tysiatskii&quot; Boris Negochevich. The desperate Novgorodian people asked for Yaroslav of Suzdal to return, which he did at the end of 1230, but the famine got even worse in spring 1231, until German merchants sailing from overseas were able to import sufficient amounts of grain and flour to relieve the Republic&#x27;s hunger. In autumn 1231, Yaroslav took Novgorodian troops on a campaign to Chernigov against his rival Michael. In 1232, there were anti-Yaroslav rebellions in Novgorod and Pskov, but only the latter was successful in chasing the Suzdalians out of town.

In 1233, Boris Negochevich and other Novgorodian nobles joined forces with Yaroslav Vladimirovich (pretender-prince of Pskov) and some Sword Brothers, occupying Izborsk in 1233, but they were soon expelled by the Pskovian army, while the pretender was captured, handed over to Yaroslav of Suzdal and imprisoned in Pereslavl-Zalessky. In 1234, Yaroslav of Suzdal campaigned against the bishopric of Dorpat. The 1234 peace agreement was based on that of 1224; it did not involve any territorial issues, but only a prisoner exchange and Dorpat&#x27;s promise to stop supporting factions in Pskov and Novgorod that opposed Yaroslav of Suzdal. Yaroslav went to Kiev in 1235, leaving his 15- or 16-year-old son Aleksandr Yaroslavich behind in Novgorod.

Although the Northern Crusades were aimed at pagan Balts and Finns, rather than Orthodox Russians, several unsuccessful attempts were made to persuade Novgorod to convert to Catholicism after the capture of Tartu. Novgorod also fought against the Crusaders for economic reasons, to protect their monopoly of the Karelian fur trade. In Livonia, although the missionaries and Crusaders had attempted to establish peaceful relations with Novgorod, Livonian missionary and Crusade activity in Estonia caused conflicts with Novgorod, which had also attempted to subjugate, raid and convert the pagan Estonians. The Estonians would also sometimes ally with the Russians against the Crusaders, since the eastern Baltic missions also constituted a threat to Russian interests and the tributary peoples.

According to Russian sources, during the Northern Crusades, the Novgorodian prince Alexander Yaroslavich defeated the Swedes at the Battle of the Neva in July 1240, from which he received the sobriquet &quot;Nevsky&quot; (&quot;of the Neva&quot;). Alexander then defeated German crusaders at the Battle on the Ice in 1242, after the forces of the exiled prince of Pskov and men from the Bishopric of Dorpat attacked Pskov Land and Votia, a tributary of Novgorod. This later led to him being depicted as an ideal ruler in chronicles such as the &quot;Life of Alexander Nevsky&quot;. Novgorod was also spared by the Mongol armies during the Mongol invasions after Alexander Nevsky agreed to pay tribute. Historians such as J. L. I. Fennell have called the proportions of Nevsky&#x27;s victories as having been overblown; he also argued that there was no existence of a unified Western scheme of aggression against Russia and that Nevsky appeased the Mongols, while many Russian historians have argued that Nevsky was being wise, with cooperation with the Mongols being the only sensible option at the time which averted further tragedy.

=== 14th century ===
Tver, Moscow and Lithuania fought over control of Novgorod and its enormous wealth from the 14th century. Upon receiving the &quot;jarlig&quot; for grand prince of Vladimir in 1304, Mikhail Yaroslavich of Tver sent his governors to Novgorod. A series of disagreements with Mikhail pushed Novgorod towards closer ties with Moscow during the reign of Yury. In part, Tver&#x27;s proximity (the Tver principality was contiguous with Novgorod Land) threatened Novgorod. It was feared that a Tverian prince would annex Novgorod&#x27;s territory, and thus weaken the republic. At the time, though, Moscow did not border Novgorod, and since the Muscovite princes were further afield, they were more acceptable as princes of Novgorod. They could come to Novgorod&#x27;s aid when needed but would be too far away to meddle too much in the republic&#x27;s affairs.

The city of Pskov, initially part of Novgorod Land, became &quot;de facto&quot; independent as early as the 13th century after opening a trading post for merchants of the Hanseatic League. Several princes such as Vsevolod Mstislavich () and Dovmont () reigned in Pskov without any deference to, or consultation with, the prince or other officials in Novgorod. Pskov won its formal independence in August 1348 after Magnus IV of Sweden captured the key fortress of Orekhov. The Pskovites sent a small detachment and took advantage of the situation by only agreeing to accompany the Novgorodian army on the condition that Pskov would be formally granted its independence. Novgorod sent an allied force to lay siege to the fortress and signed the Treaty of Bolotovo (1348) on the way to Orekhov. As per the terms of the treaty, the &quot;posadniki&quot; of Novgorod no longer had any administrative or judicial function in Pskov and the law-courts of the archbishop of Novgorod would only be run by representatives chosen by the Pskovites. However, the archbishop of Novgorod continued to head the church in Pskov and kept the title of archbishop of Novgorod the Great and Pskov until 1589.

As Moscow grew in strength, however, the Muscovite princes became a serious threat to Novgorod. Ivan I, Simeon, and other princes sought to limit Novgorod&#x27;s independence. In 1397, a critical conflict took place between Moscow and Novgorod, when Moscow annexed the Dvina Lands along the course of the Northern Dvina. These lands were crucial to Novgorod&#x27;s well-being since much of the city&#x27;s furs came from there. This territory was returned to Novgorod the following year.

=== 15th century ===
In the 12th to 15th centuries, the Novgorod Republic expanded east and northeast. The Novgorodians explored the areas around Lake Onega, along the Northern Dvina, and coastlines of the White Sea. At the beginning of the 14th century, the Novgorodians explored the Arctic Ocean, the Barents Sea, the Kara Sea, and the West-Siberian river Ob. The lands to the north of the city, rich with fur, sea fauna and salt among others were of great economic importance to the Novgorodians, who fought a protracted series of wars with Moscow beginning in the late 14th century in order to keep these lands. Losing them meant economic and cultural decline for the city and its inhabitants. The ultimate failure of the Novgorodians to win these wars led to the downfall of the Novgorod Republic.
Novgorod supported Dmitry Shemyaka against Vasily Vasilievich in the Muscovite War of Succession (1425–1453). After Vasily II returned to throne, a war between Moscow and Novgorod took place, which ended after the Treaty of Yazhelbitsy was signed in 1456. The treaty marked the beginning of the fall of Novgorod&#x27;s independence as it lost certain freedoms. Moscow began to gradually seize land in the northern territories that were formerly under Novgorod&#x27;s control for the next decade and half due to a desire for luxury furs in the area. This led to a struggle with Novgorod for the Russian fur trade, and thus, an economic rivalry for fur, land and trade ports.

Some Novgorodian boyars were opposed to Moscow as a result, while others pursued a pro-Muscovite policy in the hopes that good relations with Moscow would reduce disruption in Novgorod&#x27;s trade; Novgorod was also dependent on the Russian lands to its southwest for important imports such as grain. Some Novgorodians were also attracted to Moscow due to it being the center of Russian Orthodoxy as opposed to Lithuania, where Catholicism was dominant and its culture was being increasingly polonized, though some Novgorodian clergy adopted a pro-Lithuanian policy for political reasons due to fears that embracing the grand prince of Moscow would eventually lead to the end of Novgorod&#x27;s independence. Most Novgorodian boyars had hoped to maintain the republic&#x27;s independence since if Novgorod were to be conquered, the boyars&#x27; wealth would flow to the grand prince and Muscovite boyars, and the Novgorodians would fall into decline; most of them also did not earn enough to pay for war.

By 1470, with the pro-Lithuanian faction being dominant, the Novgorodian boyars questioned Ivan&#x27;s sovereignty over Novgorod as their prince. Novgorod negotiated with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania for a new prince to be sent over. This led to Mikhailo Olelkovich, a cousin of Ivan III, to be accepted. According to tradition, Marfa Boretskaya, the wife of the posadnik Isak Boretsky, was the main proponent of an alliance with Poland–Lithuania to save the republic. According to this legend, Boretskaya invited the Lithuanian princeling Mikhailo Olelkovich and asked him to become her husband and the ruler of Novgorod. She also concluded an alliance with Casimir, the king of Poland and grand duke of Lithuania. The prospects of changing allegiance in favor of the allied Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania caused a major commotion among the commoners. Janet Martin and Gail Lenhoff have recently argued that Boretskaya was scapegoated, probably by Archbishop Feofil () in order to shift the blame from him for his betrayal of the terms of the Treaty of Yazhelbitsy, which forbade Novgorod from conducting foreign affairs without grand princely approval. While the extent of Boretskaya&#x27;s role in the Lithuanian party is probably exaggerated, Novgorod did indeed try to turn to the king of Poland. A draft treaty, allegedly found among the loot after the Battle of Shelon River, was drawn up between Casimir and the Novgorodians.

The Muscovite authorities saw Novgorod&#x27;s behavior as a repudiation of the Treaty of Yazhelbitsy (1456), and went to war against the city. The army of Moscow won a decisive victory in the Battle of Shelon River in July 1471, which severely limited Novgorod&#x27;s freedom to act thereafter, although the city maintained its formal independence. For the next six years, pro-Moscow and anti-Moscow factions in Novgorod competed with one another. Ivan III visited Novgorod several times during this period, persecuting a number of pro-Lithuanian boyars and confiscating their lands. In 1478, Ivan III sent his army to take direct control of the city. He destroyed the veche, tore down the veche bell, the ancient symbol of participatory governance, civil society, and legal rights, and destroyed the library and archives, thus ending the independence of Novgorod. After the takeover, Ivan took more than four-fifths of Novgorod&#x27;s land: half for himself and the rest for his allies. The formal annexation of Novgorod marked a major step in the unification of Russia around Moscow, with Ivan III later adopting the title of sovereign of all Russia. The &quot;Novgorod Chronicle&quot; which had been critical of Ivan III before the fall of Novgorod thus described the conquest in its aftermath, justifying it on the grounds of purported conversion of Novgorodians to the Catholic faith:
Thus did Great Prince Ivan advance with all his host against his domain of Novgorod because of the rebellious spirit of its people, their pride and conversion to Latinism. With a great and overwhelming force did he occupy the entire territory of Novgorod from frontier to frontier, inflicting on every part of it the dread powers of his fire and sword.

==Government==

The city-state of Novgorod had developed procedures of governance that held a large measure of democratic participation far in advance of the rest of Europe, but that share several similarities with the democratic traditions of Scandinavian peasant republics. The people had the power to elect city officials and they even had the power to elect and remove the prince. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; writer then goes on to describe a &quot;town meeting&quot; where these decisions would have been made, which included people from all social classes ranging from the &quot;posadniki&quot; (burgomaster), to the &quot;chernye liudi&quot; () or the lowest free class. The precise constitution of the medieval Novgorodian republic is uncertain, although traditional histories have created the image of a highly institutionalized network of &quot;veches&quot; (public assemblies) and a government of &quot;posadniki&quot; (burgomaster), &quot;tysyatskys&quot; (&quot;thousandmen&quot;; originally the head of the town militia, but later a judicial and commercial official), other members of aristocratic families, and the archbishops of Novgorod.

The &quot;veche&quot; tradition convinced Novgorodians that they had the right to be consulted on important issues, though in practice, the &quot;posadniki&quot; came from a few rich merchant families. In the early years of the republic, the prince and &quot;posadnik&quot; shared power until the prince&#x27;s power was gradually restricted, while the archbishop of Novgorod increasingly played the role of head of state, particularly during times of feuds. Just before 1300, a series of reforms further curtailed the prince&#x27;s powers within the local administration while those of the archbishop rose. The Council of Lords () was also formed, and boyar families from each district were represented, typically by former &quot;posadniki&quot;, with each &quot;posadnik&quot; beginning to hold office for only one year. As feuds continued to grow, the structure was again changed so that each district had its own &quot;posadnik&quot;, with the number of &quot;posadniki&quot; increasing to 24 in 1423, though this failed to achieve stability, and feuds continued until the last days of independence.

The Novgorod Judicial Charter, inherited from the earlier &quot;Russkaya Pravda&quot;, served as the legal code of the Novgorod Republic from 1440. The latest version was supplemented in 1471 under the auspices of Ivan III and his son Ivan Ivanovich. The Novgorod Judicial Charter, along with the Pskov Judicial Charter, were later used for Ivan III&#x27;s &quot;Sudebnik&quot; of 1497 which served as the legal code for the entire Russian state.

Novgorod was called a republic by Sigismund von Herberstein in his &quot;Notes on Muscovite Affairs&quot; written at least half a century after the conquest of Novgorod. Soviet-era Marxist scholarship frequently described the political system of Novgorod as a &quot;feudal republic&quot;, placing it within the Marxist historiographic periodization (slavery – feudalism – capitalism – socialism – communism). Many scholars today, however, question whether Russia ever really had a feudal political system parallel to that of the medieval West. Historians have also described Novgorod&#x27;s political system as an oligarchy due to the dominance of rich merchant families in politics.

===Archbishop===
Some scholars argue that the archbishop was the head of the executive branch of the government, although it is difficult to determine the exact competence of the various officials. It is possible that there was a Council of Lords () that was headed by the archbishop and met in the archiepiscopal palace (and in the Chamber of Facets after 1433).

The executives of Novgorod, at least nominally, were always the princes of Novgorod, invited by Novgorodians from neighboring states, even though their power waned in the 13th and early 14th centuries. It is unclear if the archbishop of Novgorod was the true head of state or chief executive of the Novgorod Republic, but in any case, he remained an important town official. In addition to overseeing the church in Novgorod, he headed embassies, oversaw certain court cases of a secular nature, and carried out other secular tasks. However, the archbishops appear to have worked with the boyars to reach a consensus and almost never acted alone. The archbishop was not appointed, but elected by Novgorodians, and approved by the metropolitan bishop of Russia. The archbishops were probably the richest single land-owners in Novgorod, and they also made money off court fees, fees for the use of weights and measures in the marketplace, and through other means.

===Veche and posadnik===
Another important executive was the posadnik of Novgorod, who chaired the veche, co-chaired courts together with the prince, oversaw tax collection and managed current affairs of the city. Most of the prince&#x27;s major decisions had to be approved by the posadnik. In the mid-14th century, instead of one posadnik, the veche began electing six. These six posadniks kept their status for their lifetimes, and each year elected among themselves a &quot;stepennoy posadnik&quot;. Posadniks were almost invariably boyars – the city&#x27;s highest aristocracy. The precise makeup of the veche is also uncertain, although it appears to have comprised members of the urban population, as well as of the free rural population. Whether it was a democratic institution or one controlled by the boyars has been hotly debated. The posadniks, tysiatskys, and even the bishops and archbishops of Novgorod, were often elected or at least approved by the veche.

Tradespeople and craftsmen also participated in the political affairs of Novgorod. Traditional scholarship argues that they were organized into five &quot;kontsy&quot; (&quot;ends&quot; in Russian) – i.e., the boroughs of the city they lived in; each end was then organized by the streets in which they lived. The ends and streets often bore names indicating that certain trades were concentrated in certain parts of the city (there was a Carpenter&#x27;s End and a Potters&#x27; End, for example). The merchants were organised into associations, of which the most famous were those of wax traders (called Ivan&#x27;s Hundred) and of the merchants engaged in overseas trade.

Like much of the rest of Novgorod&#x27;s medieval history, the precise composition of these organizations is uncertain. It is quite possible that the &quot;ends&quot; and &quot;streets&quot; were simply neighborhood administrative groups rather than guilds or &quot;unions&quot;. Street organizations were known to build churches in their neighborhoods and to have buried the dead of their neighborhoods during outbreaks of the plague, but beyond that their activities are uncertain.

&quot;Streets&quot; and &quot;ends&quot; may have taken part in political decision-making in Novgorod in support of certain boyar factions or to protect their interests. Merchant &quot;elders&quot; are also noted in treaties and other charters, but only about a hundred of these charters exist. A half dozen date from the 12th century, while most are from after 1262. Thus it is difficult to determine Novgorod&#x27;s political structure due to the paucity of sources.

===Prince===

The prince, while his status in Novgorod was not inheritable and his power was much reduced, remained an important figure in Novgorodian life. Of around 100 princes of Novgorod, many, if not most, were invited in or dismissed by the Novgorodians. At least some of them signed a contract called a &quot;ryad&quot; (), which protected the interests of Novgorodian boyars and laid out the prince&#x27;s rights and responsibilities. The &quot;ryads&quot; that have been preserved in archives describe the relationship of Novgorod with twelve invited princes: five of them from Tver, four from Moscow, and three from Lithuania.

First and foremost among the prince&#x27;s functions, he was a military leader. He also patronized churches in the city and held court, although it was often presided over by his namestnik or lieutenant when he was personally absent from the city. The posadnik had always to be present in the court and no court decision could be made without his approval. Also, without the posadnik&#x27;s approval the prince could neither give out Novgorod lands nor issue laws. Besides, the prince could not own land in Novgorod and could not himself collect taxes from the territory of Novgorod. He lived from money given to him by the city.

According to several &quot;ryads&quot;, the prince could not extradite or prosecute a Novgorodian outside of Novgorod Land. The princes had two residences, one on the Marketplace (called Yaroslav&#x27;s Court), and another in Rurikovo Gorodische (Рюриково городище) several miles south of the Trade Side of the city.

===Administrative divisions===

The administrative division of Novgorod Republic is not definitely known; the country was divided into several &quot;tysyachi&quot; () in the core lands of the country, and &quot;volosti&quot; () in lands in the east and north that were being colonized or just paid tribute. The city of Novgorod and its vicinity, as well as a few other towns, were not part of any of those. Pskov achieved autonomy from Novgorod in the 13th century; its independence was confirmed by the Treaty of Bolotovo in 1348. Several other towns had special status as they were owned jointly by Novgorod and one of the neighbouring states.

==Geography==
The Novgorod Republic was the largest of the Russian states in terms of area until it was surpassed by Moscow following its annexation of other independent principalities in the 15th century. The Novgorod Republic occupied the northwest and north of European Russia, as well as the eastern part of Finland. To the east, it was bordered by the Principality of Tver and to the west, it was bordered by Lithuania as well as various Baltic powers, including the Teutonic Order and the bishoprics of Dorpat and Courland as well as the Hanseatic cities of Riga and Reval.

==Economy==
The economy of the Novgorod Republic included farming and animal husbandry (e.g., the archbishops of Novgorod and others raised horses for the Novgorodian army), while hunting, beekeeping, and fishing were also widespread. In most of the regions of the republic, these different &quot;industries&quot; were combined with farming. Iron was mined on the coast of the Gulf of Finland. Staraya Russa and other localities were known for their saltworks. Flax and hop cultivation were also of significant importance. Countryside products, such as furs, beeswax, honey, fish, lard, flax, and hops, were sold on the market and exported to other Russian cities or abroad.

The real wealth of Novgorod, however, came from the fur trade. Hanseatic merchants were particularly attracted to the Russian trade due to its vast resources of furs and beeswax, with Novgorod being the leading supplier of furs. The city was the main entrepôt for trade between Rus&#x27; and northwestern Europe as it was located at the eastern end of the Baltic trade network established by the Hanseatic League. From Novgorod&#x27;s northeastern lands (&quot;The Lands Beyond the Portages&quot; as they were called in the chronicles), the area stretching north of Lakes Ladoga and Onega up to the White Sea and east to the Ural Mountains had so much fur that medieval travel accounts tell of furry animals raining from the sky. The Novgorodian merchants traded with Swedish, German, and Danish cities. In early years, the Novgorodians sailed the Baltic themselves (several incidents involving Novgorodian merchants in Gotland and Denmark are reported in the &quot;Novgorodian First Chronicle&quot;). Orthodox churches for Novgorodian merchants have been excavated on Gotland. Likewise, merchants from Gotland had their own St. Olaf church and trading house in Novgorod. However, the Hanseatic League disputed the right of Novgorodian merchants to carry out sea trade independently and to deliver cargoes to Western European ports by their own ships. Silver, cloth, wine and herring were imported from Western Europe.

The amount of fur, especially squirrel and other relatively cheap furs, that Novgorod supplied to Hanseatic merchants was considerable. The Lübeck company of Wittenborg exported between 200,000 and 500,000 Lübeck marks from Novgorod to Livonia in the 1350s. Anna Khoroshkevich assumed that exports increased throughout the 14th century and was at its height in the beginning of the 15th century, but by the second half of the century, Novgorod suffered from the effects of exhaustion of its resources with hunting grounds moving considerably further north and Muscovite merchants accruing the main profit of the shift.

In spite of unfavorable natural conditions, Novgorod&#x27;s rural population was dependent upon agriculture and stock-rearing, while hunting and fishing were also important. The agricultural basis was also insecure, as the land passed almost fully into the hands of ruling boyars and clergy, with only a small area belonging to merchants. The peasants of Novgorod also paid dues to their lords in the products of agriculture, fishing, forestry, and stock-rearing.

Foreign coins and silver were used as a currency before Novgorod started minting its own &quot;novgorodka&quot; coins in 1420.

==Society==

More than half of all privately owned lands in Novgorod had been concentrated in the hands of some 30–40 noble boyar families by the 14th and 15th centuries. These vast estates served as material resources, which secured political supremacy of the boyars. The Cathedral of St. Sophia – the main ecclesiastic establishment of Novgorod – was their chief rival in terms of landownership. Its &quot;votchinas&quot; were located in the most economically developed regions of Novgorod Land. The Yuriev Monastery, Arkazhsky Monastery, Antoniev Monastery and some other privileged monasteries are known to have been big landowners. There were also the so-called &quot;zhityi lyudi&quot; (житьи люди), who owned less land than the boyars, and unprivileged small &quot;votchina&quot; owners called &quot;svoyezemtsy&quot; (своеземцы, or private landowners). The most common form of labor exploitation – the system of metayage – was typical for the afore-mentioned categories of landowners. Their household economies were mostly serviced by slaves (kholops), whose number had been constantly decreasing. Along with the metayage, monetary payments also gained significant importance by the second half of the 15th century.

Some scholars argue that the feudal lords tried to legally tie down the peasants to their land. Certain categories of feudally dependent peasants, such as &quot;davniye lyudi&quot; (давние люди), &quot;polovniki&quot; (половники), &quot;poruchniki&quot; (поручники), and &quot;dolzhniki&quot; (должники), were deprived of the right to leave their masters. The boyars and monasteries also tried to restrict other categories of peasants from switching their feudal lords. However, until the late 16th century peasants could leave their land in the weeks preceding and coming after George&#x27;s Day in Autumn.

Marxist scholars such as Aleksandr Khoroshev often spoke of a class struggle in Novgorod. There were some 80 major uprisings in the republic, which often turned into armed rebellions. The most notable among these took place in 1136, 1207, 1228–1229, 1270, 1418, and 1446–1447. The extent to which these were based on &quot;class struggle&quot; is unclear. Many were between various boyar factions or, if a revolt did involve the peasants or tradesmen against the boyars, it did not consist of the peasants wanting to overthrow the existing social order, but was more often than not a demand for better rule on the part of the ruling class. There did not seem to be a sense that the office of prince should be abolished or that the peasants should be allowed to run the city.

Throughout the republican period, the archbishop of Novgorod was the head of the Orthodox church in the city. The Finnic population of Novgorod Land underwent Christianization. The sect of the &quot;strigolniki&quot; spread to Novgorod from Pskov in the middle of the 14th century, with its members renouncing ecclesiastic hierarchy, monasticism and sacraments of priesthood, communion, repentance and baptism, before they disappeared by the early 15th century. Another sect, known as the Heresy of the Judaizers by its opponents, appeared in Novgorod in the second half of the 15th century and subsequently enjoyed support at the court in Moscow, before ultimately they were persecuted and several councils of the Russian Church condemned them.

==Military==
Like other Russian states, the military of Novgorod consisted of a levy and the prince&#x27;s retinue (&quot;druzhina&quot;). While potentially all free Novgorodians could be mobilised, in reality the number of recruits depended on the level of danger faced by Novgorod. The professional formations included the retinues of the archbishop and prominent boyars, as well as the garrisons of fortresses. Firearms were first mentioned in 1394, and in the 15th century, fortress artillery was used, and cannons were installed on ships.

==Foreign relations==

During the era of Kievan Rus&#x27;, Novgorod was a trade hub at the northern end of both the Volga trade route and the route from the Varangians to the Greeks along the Dnieper River system. A vast array of goods were transported along these routes and exchanged with local Novgorod merchants and other traders. The merchants of Gotland retained the Gothic Court trading house well into the 12th century. Later, German merchantmen also established trading houses in Novgorod. Scandinavian royalty would intermarry with Russian princes and princesses.

===Livonian Order and Sweden===
After the East–West Schism, Novgorod struggled from the beginning of the 13th century against Swedish, Danish, and German crusaders. During the Swedish–Novgorodian Wars, the Swedes invaded lands where some of the population had earlier paid tribute to Novgorod. The Germans had been trying to conquer the Baltic region since the late 12th century. Novgorod went to war 26 times with Sweden and 11 times with the Livonian Brothers of the Sword. The German knights, along with Danish and Swedish feudal lords, launched a series of uncoordinated attacks in 1240–1242. Russian sources mention that a Swedish army was defeated in the Battle of the Neva in 1240. The Baltic German campaigns ended in failure after the Battle on the Ice in 1242. After the foundation of the castle of Vyborg in 1293 the Swedes gained a foothold in Karelia. On August 12, 1323, Sweden and Novgorod signed the Treaty of Nöteborg, regulating their border for the first time.

===Golden Horde===
The Novgorod Republic was saved from the direct impact of the Mongol invasions as it was not conquered by the Mongols. In 1259, Mongol tax-collectors and census-takers arrived in the city, leading to political disturbances and forcing Alexander Nevsky to punish a number of town officials (by cutting off their noses) for defying him as the grand prince of Vladimir (soon to be the khan&#x27;s tax-collector in Russia) and his Mongol overlords.

==Culture==
===Art and iconography===
The Republic of Novgorod was famous for its high level of culture in relation to other Russian duchies like Suzdal. A great majority of the most important Eastern artwork of the period came from this city. Novgorodians produced large quantities of art, more specifically, religious icons. This high level of artistic production was due to the flourishing economy. Not only would prominent boyar families commission the creation of icons, but artists also had the backing of wealthy merchants and members of the strong artisan class. Icons became so prominent in Novgorod that by the end of the 13th century, a citizen did not have to be particularly rich to buy one; in fact, icons were often produced as exports as well as for churches and homes. However, scholars today have managed to find and preserve only a small, random assortment of icons made from the 12th century to the 14th century in Novgorod.

The icons that do remain show a mixture of a traditional Russian style, Palaeologus-Byzantine style (prominent previously in Kiev), and European Romanesque and Gothic style. The artists of Novgorod, and their audience, favored saints who provided protection mostly related to the economy. The Prophet Elijah was the lord of thunder who provided rain for the peasants&#x27; fields. Saint George, Saint Blaise, and Saints Florus and Laurus all provided some manner of protection over the fields or the animals and herds of the peasants. Saint Paraskeva Pyatnitsa and Saint Anastasia both protected trade and merchants. Saint Nicholas was the patron of carpenters and protected travelers and the suffering. Both Saint Nicholas and the Prophet Elijah also offer protection from fires. Fires were commonplace in the fields and on the streets of the city. Depictions of these saints retained popularity throughout the entire reign of the republic. But in the beginning of the 14th century another icon became prominent in the city: the Virgin of Mercy. This icon commemorates the appearance of the Virgin Mary to Andrew the Fool. During this appearance, Mary prays for humankind.

Novgorod lost not only its political authority after 1478 but also its artistic authority, resulting in a more uniform method for iconography being established throughout Russia. The Novgorod school of icon painting, derived from the Byzantine school, served as the basis for future Russian art with the Moscow school, which emerged in the 16th century and was later succeeded by the Stroganov school.

===Architecture and city layout===
The Volkhov River divided the Republic of Novgorod into two-halves. The commercial side of the city, which contained the main market, rested on one side of the Volkhov. The Cathedral of St. Sophia and the ancient kremlin rested on the other side of the river. The cathedral and kremlin were surrounded by a solid ring of city walls, which included a bell tower. Novgorod was filled with and surrounded by churches and monasteries. The city was overcrowded because of its large population of 30,000 people. The wealthy (boyar families, artisans, and merchants) lived in large houses inside the city walls, and the poor used whatever space they could find. The streets were paved with wood and were accompanied by a wooden water-pipe system, a Byzantine invention to protect against fire.

The Byzantine style (famous for large domes) and the European Romanesque style influenced the architecture of Novgorod. A number of rich families commissioned churches and monasteries in the city. About 83 churches, almost all of which were built in stone, operated during this period. Two prominent styles of churches existed in the Republic of Novgorod. The first style consisted of a single apse with a slanted (&quot;lopastnyi&quot;) roof. This style was standard throughout Russia during this period. The second style, the Novgorodian style, consisted of three apses and had roofs with arched gables. This second style was prominent in the early years of the Republic of Novgorod and also in the last years of the Republic, when this style was revitalized to make a statement against the rising power of Moscow. The inside of the churches contained icons, woodcarvings, and church plates. The first known one-day votive church was built in Novgorod in 1390 to ward off a pandemic, several others were built in the city until the mid-16th century. As they were built in one day, they were made of wood, small in size and simple in design.

===Literature and literacy===
Chronicles are the earliest kind of literature known to originate in Novgorod, the oldest one being the &quot;Novgorod First Chronicle&quot;. Other genres appear in the 14th and 15th centuries: travel diaries (such as the account of Stephen of Novgorod&#x27;s travel to Constantinople for trade purposes), legends about local posadniks, saints and Novgorod&#x27;s wars and victories. The events of many bylinas – traditional Russian oral epic poems – take place in Novgorod. Their protagonists include a merchant and adventurer Sadko and daredevil Vasily Buslayev.

Scholars generally believe that the Republic of Novgorod had an unusually high level of literacy for the time period. Archeologists found over one thousand birch-bark texts, all dating from the 11th to the 15th centuries, in towns dating back to early Rus&#x27;. Roughly 950 of these texts were from Novgorod. Archeologists and scholars estimate that as much as 20,000 similar texts still remain in the ground and many more burned down during numerous fires.

Novgorodian citizens from all class levels, from boyars to peasants and artisans to merchants, participated in writing these texts. Even women wrote a significant amount of the manuscripts. This collection of birch-bark texts consists of religious documents, writings from the city&#x27;s archbishops, business messages from all classes, and travelogues, especially of religious pilgrimages. The citizens of Novgorod wrote in a realistic and businesslike fashion. In addition to the birch-bark texts, archeologists also found the oldest surviving Russian manuscript in Novgorod: three wax tablets with Psalms 67, 75, and 76, dating from the first quarter of the 11th century.

<text>Harry Lyon is a New Zealand musician and songwriter. He first came to prominence as a member of the band Hello Sailor after playing with Christchurch top 40 band Beam.

In 1980 after Hello Sailor, Lyon formed Coup D&#x27;État with Jan Preston, Neil Hannan and Steve Osborne (who was replaced by Paul Dunningham after a short time). They toured the country and performed at the second &#x27;Sweetwaters Music Festival&#x27; in January 1981. Coup D&#x27;etat were awarded the 1981 RIANZ Single of the Year for &quot;Dr I Like Your Medicine&quot;. The band split the following year.

In 1982 Graham Brazier formed the Legionnaires and Lyon joined a revised line-up, but Brazier suddenly formed a new band. Lyon joined Dave McArtney in the Pink Flamingos for a short time.

He appeared in the feature film &quot;Should I Be Good&quot; in 1984, playing Nat Goodman, a former drug dealer just released from prison. Nat sang in nightclubs so Lyon also contributed music to the film.

Hello Sailor reformed for the opening of the renovated Gluepot in 1985 and, following the success of the performances, began touring again.

Lyon has an MCPA (Hons) (Master of Creative &amp; Performing Arts) from the University of Auckland and is currently Director of MAINZ (Music and Audio Institute of New Zealand).

In May 2017, according to musician Delaney Davidson, Lyon is recording a solo album.

== Aotearoa Music Awards ==
The Aotearoa Music Awards (previously known as &quot;New Zealand Music Awards&quot; (NZMA)) are an annual awards night celebrating excellence in New Zealand music and have been presented annually since 1965.

<text>Ricky Ball is a musician from New Zealand. He played drums in the following bands: the Beat boys, the Courtiers, Challenge, Ticket, Jimmy Sloggett Band, Tommy Ferguson&#x27;s Goodtime Band, Rainbow, Hello Sailor, Woody, the Pink Flamingos (briefly, at the beginning) and Beaver.

Woody (consisting of three-quarters of Ticket among the line up) was a resident band at Jilly&#x27;s in Auckland, one of several nightclubs in New Zealand run by Maurice Greer, formerly of Human Instinct.

According to &quot;Stranded in Paradise&quot;, Ricky Ball owned a boutique when he joined the Pink Flamingos and left when they were likely to be more than a resident band at Jilly&#x27;s.

<text>Police ranks are a system of hierarchical relationships in police organisations. The rank system defines authority and responsibility in a police organisation, and affects the culture within the police force. Usually, uniforms denote the bearer&#x27;s rank by particular insignia affixed to the uniforms.

Most of the police forces of the United Kingdom (including those of the British Overseas Territories and the Crown Dependencies) use a standardised set of ranks. However, as law enforcement in the United Kingdom is organised separately in the three jurisdictions of England and Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland, and as most law enforcement is carried out by police officers serving in regional police services known as territorial police forces, some variations in rank organisation, insignia and responsibilities may occur within the United Kingdom. An example of this are the slight variations in the most senior ranks of the Metropolitan Police and the City of London Police. Parallel to the regional services are UK-wide agencies, such as the British Transport Police and the national specialist units of certain territorial police forces, with a possibility of further variations.

Due to policing in many countries developing from military organisations and operations, police ranks in many countries follow a logic similar to that of military ranks. Most of the British police ranks that exist today were, however, deliberately chosen by Home Secretary Sir Robert Peel so that they did not correspond with military ranking. They were enacted under the Metropolitan Police Act 1829.

==Powers==

In law, every attested police officer is a constable whatever their actual rank, in the sense that officers of any rank have the same powers of arrest. The basic police powers of arrest and search of an ordinary constable are identical to those of a superintendent or chief constable; however certain higher ranks are given administrative powers to authorise certain police actions. In England and Wales, these include the powers to:
* authorise the continued detention of up to 24 hours of a person arrested for an offence and brought to a police station (granted to sergeants and above at designated police stations),
* authorise section 18 (1) PACE searches of premises (granted to inspectors and above),
* extend the length of prisoner detention to 36 hours (granted to superintendents and above),
* extend the length of bail from a police station to three months (granted to inspectors) or up to six months (granted to superintendents and above)

In relation to police officers of the Home Office or territorial police forces of England and Wales, section 30 of the Police Act 1996 states that &quot;a member of a police force shall have all the powers and privileges of a Constable throughout England and Wales and the adjacent United Kingdom waters&quot;. Police officers do not need to be on duty to exercise their powers and can act off-duty if circumstances require it (technically placing themselves back on duty). Officers from the police forces of Scotland and Northern Ireland and non-territorial special police forces have different jurisdictions. See List of law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom, Crown Dependencies and British Overseas Territories for a fuller description of jurisdictions.

== Detective, reserve, training and temporary ranks==
=== Detectives ===
Officers holding ranks up to and including chief superintendent who are members of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) or Special Branch (and certain other units) have the prefix &quot;detective&quot; before their rank. Due to the nature of their duties, these officers generally wear plain clothes (except for ceremonial purposes) and so do not wear the corresponding rank insignia; however, they still operate within the same structure as their uniformed counterparts.

In the United Kingdom, detective ranks are not superior to those of uniformed officers and a detective has the same powers and authority as a uniformed officer of the same rank. The &quot;detective&quot; prefix designates that the officer has received suitable training and passed related examinations to conduct serious or complex criminal investigations.

===Special constables===
There are various grades of special constable which assist in the tasking and management of the constabulary. The ranks are management grades; those holding them are not &quot;sergeants&quot; or &quot;inspectors&quot; for the purposes of the law (for example, authorisations to order the removal of disguises or to set up roadblocks). Originally, specials held the same ranks and used the same rank insignia as regular officers, but there was a general shift to distinct terms such as &quot;area officer&quot; and &quot;divisional officer&quot; in the 1980s. However, since 2000, the National Policing Improvement Agency has encouraged special constabularies to return to rank structures and epaulette insignia identical to their regular counterparts. Although most forces have now reverted to regular rank titles (with the prefix &quot;special&quot;), only some have reverted to regular rank insignia. Senior special constables have no authority over regular officers, but very experienced officers may occasionally be given administrative supervision of mixed units of regular and special constables for certain events where no regular supervisory officer is available.

===Trainee, temporary and acting ranks===
Constables who are training to become detective constables sometimes bear the title trainee investigator (T/I) or trainee detective constable (T/DC).

The prefix &quot;temporary&quot; before a rank (e.g. temporary detective sergeant, abbreviated T/DS) denotes an officer who has been temporarily promoted to a rank (and so who does actually hold that rank, albeit on a temporary basis), whilst the prefix &quot;acting&quot; (e.g. acting inspector, abbreviated A/Insp) denotes an officer who is performing the role of a higher rank than the one actually held (sometimes informally termed &quot;acting up&quot;). Temporary ranks are often used for set periods (e.g. a six-month appointment to a particular role), whereas acting ranks, although sometimes held for extended periods, are often used for a very short time (e.g. a single shift when additional supervisory officers are required, or to replace an officer on short-term leave).

Under section 107 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (England and Wales only), sergeants and chief inspectors may be designated (by an officer of at least the rank of superintendent) to exercise the powers of an inspector or a superintendent respectively. Such a designation will generally accompany such an officer being given an acting rank, so for most operational purposes there is no difference between substantive, temporary and acting ranks at Inspector and above (although there may be differences as to pay, pensions and insignia). However, under section 36 of that act, only substantive sergeants may be appointed custody officers.

==Ranks of unwarranted related services==
Traffic wardens were administered by the police and exercised some police powers to control traffic or issue fixed penalty notices for traffic offences. , very few police traffic wardens exist with a legacy of only ten police traffic wardens remaining in England and Wales. Section 46 of the Policing and Crime Act 2017 has in effect abolished police traffic wardens allowing police to focus on their core duties. The duties of traffic wardens have been passed to local authority civil enforcement officers (formerly parking attendants) who, under decriminalised parking enforcement, have powers to issue penalty charge notices for breaches of parking laws on highways or in local authority car parks and compel the production of a disabled parking permit (blue badge) for inspection.

==Rank as related to officer identification numbers==
All officers have a unique identification number. These are usually referred to as shoulder or collar numbers, referring to the fact that they were once worn on the uniform collar and later on the epaulettes by constables and sergeants. Uniformed officers in many forces still wear them on the epaulettes, but other forces have badges or other ways of displaying their identification numbers. Kent Police, for instance, refers to its numbers as force numbers and officers wear them on a velcro tab on their stab vest or on a badge attached to their shirt or tunic. Officers in all forces of the rank of inspector or above do not usually wear their numbers.

In most forces these identification numbers are simple numbers, with one to five digits.

The Metropolitan Police and Police Scotland, as well as a few other forces, use a letter and number system:

Metropolitan Police:
* Sergeant: Borough code and one, two or three digits
* Constable: Borough code and three or four digits
* Special constable: Borough code and four digits, usually beginning with the number &quot;5&quot; (&quot;8&quot; for traffic/transport or &quot;9&quot; for specialist units)
* PCSO: Borough code and four digits, the first digit being a &quot;7&quot;

Police Scotland:

* Sergeant and constable: Division letter and three or four digits
* Special constable: Division letter and four digits, the first digit being a &quot;7&quot;

In the Metropolitan Police, the borough code is a two-letter code which follows the digits (but displayed above them on epaulettes). Before the reorganisation into boroughs, each division had a different code, with sergeants having two-digit numbers and constables having three-digit numbers.

==Rank insignia==
Badges of rank are usually worn on the epaulettes. However, when in their formal uniform sergeants wear their rank insignia on their upper sleeves. When police tunics had closed collars (not open collars as worn with ties), constables and sergeants did not wear epaulettes but had their divisional call number on their collar (hence they are still often referred to as collar numbers). Sergeants wore their stripes on their upper sleeve. Inspectors and more senior ranks wore epaulettes at a much earlier stage, although they once wore their rank insignia on their collars. Most forces no longer use divisional call numbers, and retain only the collar number and rank insignia.

===Great Britain===
Senior officers usually wear distinguishing marks around the outer edge of the peaks of their caps (or under the capbadge for female officers, who do not wear peaked caps). Normally this is a raised black band for inspectors and chief inspectors, a silver (gold in the City of London Police) band for superintendents and chief superintendents, and a row of silver oak leaves for chief officers. Chief constables, the Commissioner of the City of London Police, and all commissioner ranks of the Metropolitan Police wear oakleaves on both the outer and inner edges of their peaks (or a double row beneath the capbadge for female officers). In Scotland, however, the mark is a silver band for inspectors and chief inspectors, a silver band and silver oakleaves on the outer and inner edges of the peak respectively for superintendents and chief superintendents, and silver oakleaves on the outer and inner edges of the peak for all chief officers.

Additionally, officers at or above the rank of commander or assistant chief constable wear gorget patches on the collars of their tunics. The gorget patches are patterned after those worn by general officers of the British Army and Royal Marines; the police versions, however, are of silver on black (gold on black in the City of London Police) rather than gold on red, in keeping with the police uniform colours.

The ranks below are used by all territorial forces in the United Kingdom, and the specialist national forces: the British Transport Police, Ministry of Defence Police, and Civil Nuclear Constabulary. Other specialist forces, and those outside of the United Kingdom (including British Overseas Territories such as Bermuda and Gibraltar, which are parts of the British sovereign territory in most of which internal competencies of governance are mostly delegated to local governments, and the Crown Dependencies of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, which are not parts of the British sovereign territory) use the same general system, but often have fewer senior ranks.

Chief constable is the title of the head of each United Kingdom territorial police force except the Metropolitan Police and City of London Police, which are headed by commissioners. Ranks above chief superintendent are usually non-operational management roles, and are often referred to as &quot;chief officer&quot; ranks, but the longer phrase &quot;chief police officer&quot; or similar in legislation is specifically a commissioner or chief constable, a &quot;senior police officer&quot; being their immediate deputy. The Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police is often considered to be the highest police rank within the United Kingdom, although in reality every chief constable and the two commissioners are supreme over their own forces and are not answerable to any other officer.

Epaulettes are normally black with white sewn on or silver metal insignia, although high-visibility uniforms are often yellow with black insignia.

====Epaulette insignia====
====Uniform insignia====

The rank of an officer can be found in varying details of the uniform such as headgear, sleeve patches and tunic collar details.
Insignia on hats and uniforms can vary between forces within the UK and the following tables below will not accurately represent all constabularies within the UK.

====British Transport Police====
As a variation to the standard set, the deputy chief constable of the British Transport Police wears two rows of oak leaves on their hat.

===Northern Ireland===
The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) adopted the same rank system as elsewhere in the United Kingdom on 1 June 1970, but has a different version of the rank insignia, with the star from the PSNI badge replacing the crown. Unusually, the star is worn below the pip by chief superintendents and by the chief constable, who wears both symbols above his tipstaves. The PSNI has retained the RUC&#x27;s distinctive inverted (point-up) sergeants&#x27; chevrons, worn on the lower sleeve in formal uniform. PSNI officers do not wear the custodian helmet and female officers wear a different hat from other forces.

The PSNI rank structure and epaulette insignia is the same as the territorial police in Great Britain, except that the crown is replaced with the design from the PSNI badge and sergeants&#x27; chevrons are point up. In addition to the epaulettes being a green colour rather than a black, this is to match their green uniforms.

Headgear rank marking is the same as for England and Wales.

===Scotland===
Police Scotland headwear is slightly different for the following ranks:
*Inspectors and chief inspectors wear a hat with a silver band instead of a black one.
*Superintendents and chief superintendents wear a row of oak leaves within the silver band.
*Assistant chief constables and deputy chief constables wear two rows of oak leaves.

===Territorial police forces variations===
====City of London Police====

City of London Police insignia are gold where that of other forces is silver. For example, rank insignia and collar numbers on epaulettes are gold, as are the bands and oak leaves on the caps of senior officers, and officers of or above the rank of commander wear gold-on-black gorget patches on the collars of their tunics.

The City of London Police also previously had variations for some acting ranks such as sergeant and inspector: acting sergeants wore their chevrons above their divisional letters (or later &quot;CP&quot; for all officers, following the abolition of the force&#x27;s divisions), whereas substantive sergeants wear them below their collar numbers. Acting inspectors were denoted by a crown in the place of their divisional letters, whilst keeping their collar number and chevrons.

The City of London Police use a different colour scheme for their police headwear. Instead of the black and white sillitoe tartan they use red and white. The assistant commissioner and commander wear a single row of oak leaves on their hats, and only the commissioner wears two rows.

====Merseyside Police====
Inspectors and chief inspectors in Merseyside Police wear silver instead of black lace on their hats, as did Liverpool City Police before them.

====Metropolitan Police====

The Metropolitan Police uses different ranks above chief superintendent. The fabric used in the crowns is blue, whereas other police forces use red. Although they rank as deputy chief constables, deputy assistant commissioners wear two rows of oak leaves on their hats.

===Isle of Man Constabulary===
====Epaulette insignia====
The Isle of Man police ranks follow the structure of other British police rank structures however it is notably missing the chief superintendent and assistant chief constable ranks within their own structure. The epaulettes for the constables and sergeants also have an addition of the Isle of Man Constabulary logo and motto above their collar numbers. Headgear rank marking is the same as for England and Wales.
===Special constabularies insignia===
Special constabulary epaulettes frequently bear the letters &quot;SC&quot; (with or without a crown above) to differentiate them from regular officers. Within the City of London Special Constabulary is the Honourable Artillery Company Specials; members of this unit wear HAC on the shoulders in addition to other insignia. Senior special constables wear the same markings on their hats as equivalent regular ranks.

There is a large variation in the design of epaulettes used across Great Britain for specials. This has been recognised at national level and as part of the Special Constabulary National Strategy 2018–2023 the structure and insignia is under review with the intention to standardise.
Other special constabularies use combinations of bars, half bars, pips, crowns, laurel wreaths, collar numbers, force crests and the SC identity (with or without a crown) to distinguish ranks (and/or role).
===Miscellaneous police forces===

There are, in the United Kingdom, a number of miscellaneous constabularies. These are not operated, regulated or funded by the Home Office, although they are fully authorised (by Act of Parliament) establishments. In general, they provide the policing for ports, docks, tunnels, or other particular institutions. Although these forces tend to require high standards of training and accountability, which closely mirror those of the Home Office police forces, they are usually much smaller in terms of personnel, and therefore utilise fewer of the &#x27;standard&#x27; ranks.

====Public order roles and rank insignia====
Officers taking part in public order and public safety (POPS) events and incidents wear colour-coded rank slides to denote command and support roles. Bronze commanders can be of varying ranks and not just chief inspectors as shown below. Tactical advisers can also be of differing ranks, but are most commonly constables or sergeants. It is a requirement under the College of Policing Public Order Manual that all officers, regardless of rank, display an identifying number on their epaulettes. Therefore, ranks such as inspector have collar/warrant numbers displayed on their public order colour-coded epaulettes that they might not have as part of their normal uniform.

====Police community support officers (PCSO)====
Police community support officers bear epaulettes with the words &quot;Police community support officer&quot; and their shoulder number, or, in the Metropolitan Police, a borough identification code and shoulder number. South Yorkshire Police PCSO supervisors wear a bar above the words &quot;Police community support officer supervisor&quot; and the shoulder number.

====Police cadets====

The following table serves as an example of ranks within volunteer police cadet schemes, which vary considerably. Cadets appointed &quot;mayor&#x27;s cadets&quot; are given a special badge or epaulettes to wear.
==Historical police ranks==

=== Timeline of ranks ===
All police forces have used a wide variety of ranks to meet their organisational needs, especially the Metropolitan Police Service. Ranks have been created, abolished, amalgamated and sometimes revived during the history of British policing.

In the following table, &quot;MET only&quot; means those ranks are specific for the Metropolitan Police.

===Defunct rank insignia===
The following table presents defunct rank insignia of the Metropolitan Police.

<text>Richard Barbieri (born 30 November 1957) is an English musician, composer and sound designer. Originally a member of new wave band Japan (and their brief 1989–1991 reincarnation as Rain Tree Crow), he became the keyboard player in the progressive rock band Porcupine Tree in 1993. Besides its founder Steven Wilson, he is the longest tenured member of Porcupine Tree.

==Biography==
===Japan (1975–1982)===
Barbieri joined Catford band Japan in 1975. Although initially perceived as a &#x27;hyped&#x27; band, Japan went on to record five studio albums culminating in &quot;Tin Drum&quot; which stayed in the UK charts for a year. They were one of the most successful chart bands in Europe and Asia in 1982 despite the increasingly experimental nature of their music. The band split up after a world tour in December 1982.

===Dolphin Brothers and collaborations (1983–1997)===
After the break-up of Japan, Barbieri continued his association with David Sylvian, playing on the latter&#x27;s early solo albums (and on the 1988 in Praise of Shamans tour).

In 1984 he started a long musical association with another Japan colleague, Steve Jansen. This has produced six collaborative albums to date. Under the name The Dolphin Brothers they released the album &quot;Catch the Fall&quot; in 1987. As Jansen / Barbieri they have released a number of works including &quot;Worlds in a Small Room&quot;, 1985, &quot;Stories Across Borders&quot;, 1993, &quot;Other Worlds in a Small Room&quot;, 1996, and &quot;Stone to Flesh&quot;, 1997.

===Rain Tree Crow (1989–1991)===
In late 1989, the members of Japan (minus guitarist Rob Dean) reunited under the name Rain Tree Crow to make new recordings for Virgin. This resulted in a single eponymous album which extended the work of late Japan and the solo/collective work of all four members, featuring a variety of influences from pop to art rock, jazz, ambient and world music. Other contributors to the album included Bill Nelson. &quot;Rain Tree Crow&quot; charted in 1991 in the UK Top 25 and brought critical acclaim.

The group parted company shortly after recording the album, for which there was no supporting tour. However, the project was key to the reuniting of Jansen, Barbieri and Karn as a creative unit (sometimes referred to as &quot;JBK&quot;).

===With Alice (1989–1992)===

Jansen and Barbieri played on many songs of two pivotal albums by the Italian singer Alice, i.e. on all of Il sole nella pioggia and on two songs from Mezzogiorno sulle Alpi, co-written by Barbieri. Other notable players on those albums were Peter Hammill, Gavin Harrison, Jakko Jakszyk, Danny Thompson and Jon Hassell.

===No-Man (1992)===
The next work by Jansen, Barbieri and Karn was as the rhythm section for British art-pop band No-Man, who recruited them for a 1992 UK tour and for recordings which later appeared on the &quot;Loveblows &amp; Lovecries&quot; album and on the &quot;Painting Paradise&quot; and &quot;Sweetheart Raw&quot; EPs (one of these EP pieces, the 20-plus-minute &quot;Heaven Taste&quot;, later appeared on the album of the same name). This marked Barbieri&#x27;s first work with Steven Wilson, with whom he would then go on to work in Porcupine Tree, and Tim Bowness, with whom he would later record the collaborative album &quot;Flame&quot;.

===Medium Productions (1993–2003)===
In 1993, Barbieri formed the Medium Productions label in 1993 with Jansen and Karn. They commenced with the Jansen/Barbieri/Karn album &quot;Beginning to Melt&quot; (a collection of varied pieces including some trio work and other recordings featuring various permutations of the basic trio with other collaborators including David Torn and Robbie Aceto). Thirteen diverse albums were released during a ten-year period; Jansen and Barbieri&#x27;s collaboration with DJ Takemura on the album &quot;Changing Hands&quot; being one of the highlights.

During this period Barbieri also made two other collaborative albums, one with his wife Suzanne J. Barbieri under the name &quot;Indigo Falls&quot; (1996), and one with Tim Bowness from the band No-Man titled &quot;Flame&quot; (1994).

===Porcupine Tree (1993–2010, 2021–present)===

In late 1993, Barbieri joined the progressive rock band Porcupine Tree (having previously played as a guest performer on the album &quot;Up the Downstair&quot;). The band released eight studio albums to increasingly greater chart success, and toured in support of many of them. Initially employing many aspects of psychedelic rock, they later transitioned to a more pop-oriented style before settling on progressive metal. Their first major success was the album &quot;In Absentia&quot;, which enjoyed chart success around Europe with sales of over 120,000. The following studio albums &quot;Deadwing&quot; and &quot;Fear of a Blank Planet&quot; met even greater success, charting highly worldwide, and picking up two Grammy Nominations. Increased radio airtime and favourable mainstream magazine reviews and interviews further increased their public exposure. The band transitioned somewhat away from metal with their 2009 album, &quot;The Incident&quot;, with leader Steven Wilson expressing a desire to enter a different genre. After years of speculation and diffusion of rumors from Wilson, the band announced its reunion in 2021.

===With Steve Hogarth (2012)===
Barbieri collaborated with Steve Hogarth on the album &quot;Not The Weapon But The Hand&quot;, which was released by Kscope Records in 2012, but a proposed tour was cancelled for financial issues. Barbieri wrote the music and Hogarth provided the lyrics for the album.

===Lustans Lakejer (1982/2017)===
In 1982, Barbieri produced the album &quot;En plats i solen&quot; by the Japan-influenced Swedish band Lustans Lakejer. In 2017 he joined them on a Swedish tour to perform the album in its entirety.

=== Solo recordings (2004–present) ===
Barbieri has released four solo albums: &quot;Things Buried&quot;, 2004/5, &quot;Stranger Inside&quot;, 2008, &quot;Planets + Persona, 2017&quot; and &quot;Under A Spell&quot;, 2021. Barbieri also released a series of 5 EP&#x27;s on cd and vinyl under the title &quot;&quot;Variants&quot;.&quot; These releases featured new compositions, improvisations, live performances and reworkings of older material.

==Other activities==
Besides recording and touring, Barbieri has written articles on analogue synthesis for various publications and programs for music software and synthesizer manufacturers. He has guested many times with The Bays, an electronic improvisational group. Recent work with The Bays includes two BBC Radio 1 sessions for the late John Peel and concerts at the Queen Elizabeth Hall and Brighton Dome. Richard and The Bays performed an improvised soundtrack to &quot;Run Lola Run&quot; in Darling Harbour, Sydney, in 2009. He also undertakes occasional keyboards duties for the live outings of Marillion vocalist Steve Hogarth&#x27;s fronted H-Band, appearing on the 2002 album &quot;Live Body, Live Spirit&quot;.

<text>The Rhône wine region in Southern France is situated in the Rhône valley and produces numerous wines under various &quot;Appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée&quot; (AOC) designations. The region&#x27;s major appellation in production volume is Côtes du Rhône AOC.

The Rhône is generally divided into two sub-regions with distinct vinicultural traditions, the Northern Rhône (referred to in French as &quot;Rhône septentrional&quot;) and the Southern Rhône (in French &quot;Rhône méridional&quot;). The northern sub-region produces red wines from the Syrah grape, sometimes blended with up to 20% of white wine grapes, and white wines from Marsanne, Roussanne and Viognier grapes. The southern sub-region produces an array of red, white and rosé wines, often blends of several grapes such as in Châteauneuf-du-Pape.

== History ==
The first cultivated vines in the region were probably planted around 600 BC. The origins of the two most important grape varieties in the northern Rhone (Syrah and Viognier) have in the past been subject to speculation. Some suggested that the Greeks were responsible for bringing the Syrah grape from the Persian city of Shiraz. Others that the grape came 50 years later when Greeks fled from the Persian king Cyrus I. Yet others suggested the grape came from the Sicilian city of Syracuse, whence circa 280 AD the Romans brought it and the Viognier grape. However, extensive DNA typing and viticultural research has established beyond doubt that Syrah originated in the Rhône region itself.

When the Romans left the area interest in the wine of the region disappeared. Rhône reappeared in the 13th century when the Popes and their considerable purchasing power moved to Avignon, at which time the production of wine expanded greatly. The wines were traded to such a degree that the Duke of Burgundy banned import and export of non-Burgundian wines. In 1446 the city of Dijon forbade all wines from Lyon, Tournon and Vienne, arguing that they were &quot;très petits et pauvres vins&quot; – very small and miserable wines.
The name Côtes du Rhône comes from public administration in the Middle Ages and was the name (Côte without &#x27;s&#x27;) of a district in the Gard &quot;département&quot;. In 1650, to guard against forgeries a set of rules was passed in an attempt to guarantee the origin of the wine. In 1737 King Louis XV of France decreed that all casks destined for resale should be branded C.D.R. These were the wines from the area around Tavel, Roquemaure, Lirac and Chusclan on the western (&#x27;right&#x27;) bank of the Rhône. Just over 100 years later, wines from the &#x27;left&#x27; bank were included in the C.D.R. definition.

==Production==
The various AOC wines of the Rhône Valley region are produced by over 6,000 wine growing properties including 1,837 private wineries and 103 cooperatives. Those vineyard owners which do not vinify their wines themselves deliver their grapes in bulk either to a winemaking cooperative, for example Cellier des Dauphins, or sell them to one of the 51 négociants (wine producers and merchants) who blend, distribute, and export on an industrial scale.

The entire Rhône region produces around 4 million hl of wine each year, of which over half is classified under the Côte du Rhône and Côte du Rhône-Villages appellations. The prestigious Northern Rhône appellations account for less than 5% of the total Rhône wine production.

==Northern Rhône==
The northern Rhône is characterised by a continental climate with harsh winters but warm summers. Its climate is influenced by the mistral wind, which brings colder air from the Massif Central. Northern Rhône is therefore cooler than southern Rhône, which means that the mix of planted grape varieties and wine styles are slightly different.

Syrah is the only red grape variety permitted in red AOC wines from this sub-region. The grape, which is believed to have originated in or close to the Rhône region, is also widely known as Shiraz, its name in Australia and much of the English-speaking world, and has recently become very popular with consumers around the world. For wines bearing the Cornas AOC designation, Syrah must be used exclusively, whereas other reds from the northern Rhône sub-region may be blended with white wine grapes, either Viognier or Marsanne and Roussanne, depending on the appellation. However, while this is allowed by the AOC rules, blending with white grapes is widely practiced only for Côte-Rôtie.

Viognier by itself is used for white wines from Condrieu and Château-Grillet. Marsanne and Roussanne are in turn used for the whites from Crozes-Hermitage, Hermitage, Saint Joseph, and Saint Péray.

From north to south the appellations in the northern Rhône are: 
* Côte-Rôtie AOC - reds of Syrah and up to 20% Viognier.
* Condrieu AOC - whites of Viognier only.
* Château-Grillet AOC - whites of Viognier.
* Saint-Joseph AOC - reds of Syrah and up to 10% Marsanne and Roussanne; whites of only Marsanne and Roussanne.
* Crozes-Hermitage AOC - reds of Syrah and up to 15% Marsanne and Roussanne; whites of only Marsanne and Roussanne.
* Hermitage AOC - reds of Syrah and up to 15% Marsanne and Roussanne; whites of only Marsanne and Roussanne.
* Cornas AOC - reds of Syrah only.
* Saint-Péray AOC - sparkling and still whites of only Marsanne and Roussanne.

Northern Rhône reds are often identified by their signature aromas of green olive and smoky bacon.

==Southern Rhône==
The southern Rhône sub-region has a more Mediterranean climate with milder winters and hot summers. Drought can be a problem in the area, but limited irrigation is permitted. The differing terroirs, together with the rugged landscape which partly protects the valleys from the Mistral, produce microclimates which give rise to a wide diversity of wines. A feature of the cultivation of the region is the use of large pebbles around the bases of the vines to absorb the heat of the sun during the day to keep the vines warm at night when, due to the cloudless skies, there is often a significant drop in temperature.

The southern Rhône&#x27;s most famous red wine is Châteauneuf-du-Pape, a blend containing up to 19 varieties of wine grapes (ten red and nine white) as permitted by the Châteauneuf-du-Pape AOC rules. Other nearby AOC regions including Côtes du Vivarais AOC, Grignan-Les Adhemar AOC, Lirac AOC, Tavel AOC, Vacqueyras AOC, and Ventoux AOC may contain even more varieties in the blend. Gigondas AOC, on the other hand, is predominantly made from Grenache noir has a more restricted set of permitted grapes. Depending on the specific AOC rules, grapes blended into southern Rhône reds may include Grenache, Syrah, Mourvèdre, Carignan and Cinsault. Similar wine blends globally are known as GSM, after the first three varietals. The reds from the left bank are full bodied, rich in tannins while young, and are characterized by their aromas of prune, undergrowth, chocolate and ripe black fruit. The right bank reds are slightly lighter and fruitier.

Southern Rhône appellations:
*Côtes du Vivarais AOC
*Côtes du Rhône AOC
*Côtes-du-Rhône Villages AOC
*Côtes du Rhône Villages (named villages)
*Châteauneuf-du-Pape AOC
*Grignan-Les Adhemar AOC
*Vacqueyras AOC
*Rasteau AOC
*Cairanne AOC
*Gigondas AOC
*Vinsobres AOC
*Lirac AOC
*Beaumes de Venise AOC
*Muscat de Beaumes de Venise AOC
*Tavel AOC
*Laudun AOC

White wines from the southern Rhône sub-region, such as in Châteauneuf-du-Pape whites, are also typically blends of several wine grapes. These may include Ugni blanc, Roussanne, Bourboulenc, Picpoul, and Clairette. Since about 1998 Viognier is increasingly being used and is also appearing as a single varietal.

Tavel AOC, produced in the special microclimate of the &quot;sillon rhodanien&quot; (the furrow of the Rhône) by some thirty producers including Château d&#x27;Aqueria, Domaine Maby, Domaine de la Mordorée, Domaine Pelaquier, is an elite rosé only, which has been referred to as &#x27;the wine of kings&quot;.

Fortified wines (vin doux naturel) are made in the Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise AOC and Rasteau AOCs.

==Côtes du Rhône==
Côtes du Rhône AOC is an AOC that covers both the northern and southern sub-regions of Rhône. Typically it is only used if the wine does not qualify for an appellation that can command a higher price. Therefore, almost all Côtes du Rhône AOC is produced in southern Rhône, since the northern sub-region is covered by well-known appellations and also is much smaller in terms of total vineyard surface. This AOC is also used by the commercial blenders &quot;(négociants)&quot; who buy grapes in bulk from various parts of the region to bottle, distribute, and export on an industrial scale. This nevertheless makes it the most commonly known, produced, and distributed appellation of the region. Produce from vineyards surrounding certain villages including Laudun and others may be labeled Côtes-du-Rhône Villages AOC.

Red Côtes du Rhône is usually dominated by Grenache.

==Other appellations==
Other appellations falling outside the main Rhône area in terms of wine styles but administratively within it are Clairette de Die AOC, Crémant de Die AOC, Grignan-Les Adhemar AOC, Luberon AOC, Ventoux AOC, Côtes du Vivarais AOC. These are more similar to the wines of Provence.
In 2004 ten new appellations were officially added to the Rhône region, 9 in the Gard and one in the Vaucluse, which largely parallel the wines of Southern Rhône proper, while two appellations were discontinued for reasons of reforesting and urban encroachment.

In 2004, Costières de Nîmes AOC, which previously had been counted as part of eastern Languedoc, was also attached to the Rhône wine region. In that year, INAO moved the responsibility for oversight of this appellation&#x27;s wine to the regional committee of the Rhône valley. Local producers of Côtes du Rhône-styled wines made from Syrah and Grenache lobbied for this change since the local winemaking traditions did not coincide with administrative borders, and presumably due to the greater prestige of Rhône wines in the marketplace. Such changes of borders between wine regions are very rare.

==Other wines==
Many private wineries also produce wines including sparkling wines and fortified wines, single varietals - particularly from the Syrah grape - and even brandies. These wines usually do not conform to the rules of a VDQS or AOC. They are usually only sold on the premises.

Several wineries produce wines from organically cultivated vines that, provided they comply with the rules for varieties, plant spacing, pruning and maximum yield, are admitted in the AOC.

The excess production of many domains and cooperatives is released as Vin de Pays which are marketed as Vin de Pays du Gard, Vin de Pays de Vaucluse, etc., or are sold to blenders of wine from the European Union, and mass food distribution for sale as own brands. Excess wines of the lowest quality, Vin de Table, occasionally become part of the wine lake and are reprocessed into industrial alcohol.

==Classification==
Rhône does not have an official classification using &quot;Grand cru&quot;, or similar terms, in contrast to Bordeaux or Burgundy. There are, however, differences between the Rhône AOCs regarding their geographical delineation and naming practices, which, in turn, provide a classification into four distinct categories:

* Côtes du Rhône only displays the region, and may be used in the entire wine region, in 171 communes. For some communes, this is the only allowed AOC. It is therefore the lowest classification for Rhône AOC wine.
* Côtes du Rhône-Villages is an AOC allowed for 95 communes, with a higher minimum requirement for grape maturity than basic Côtes du Rhône. It is therefore a higher classification. In general, the appellation does not allow the village name to be displayed.
* Côtes du Rhône-Villages together with village name is allowed for 20 communes that have been deemed to be of a higher standard than the majority.
* Cru are the 16 named appellations which display only the name of the cru, and not Côtes du Rhône. These include the most famous Rhône wines, such as Hermitage, Côte-Rôtie and Châteauneuf-du-Pape. There is no official classification differentiating between different crus, but the market prices of some AOCs are much higher than others. Sometimes, individual vineyard names (such as La Landonne within the Côte-Rôtie appellation) are displayed on the labels. Most producers will only do this for top wines, but vineyard-labelled wines enjoy no different official status from other cru wines.

==Grape varieties==
Different grape varieties are allowed in the different Rhône appellations; a few appellations are single variety appellations, while the regional Côtes du Rhône appellation allow 21 different varieties. In most cases, Northern Rhône appellations allow many fewer varieties than those of Southern Rhône. In many appellation regulations, a division is made into main grape varieties (indicated by &quot;M&quot;), supplementary varieties (indicated by &quot;S&quot;), and accessory varieties (indicated by &quot;(A)&quot;).

<text>Wilhelm Karl Hartwich (or Hartwig) Peters (22 April 1815 – 20 April 1883) was a German naturalist and explorer.

He was assistant to the anatomist Johannes Peter Müller and later became curator of the Berlin Zoological Museum. Encouraged by Müller and the explorer Alexander von Humboldt, Peters travelled to Mozambique via Angola in September 1842, exploring the coastal region and the Zambesi River. He returned to Berlin with an enormous collection of natural history specimens, which he then described in &quot;Naturwissenschaftliche Reise nach Mossambique... in den Jahren 1842 bis 1848 ausgeführt&quot; (1852–1882). The work was comprehensive in its coverage, dealing with mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, river fish, insects and botany. He replaced Martin Lichtenstein as curator of the museum in 1858, and in the same year he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In a few years, he greatly increased the Berlin Museum&#x27;s herpetological collection to a size comparable to those of Paris and London. Herpetology was Peters&#x27; main interest, and he described 122 new genera and 649 species from around the world. Peters also described at least one new fish species, the piranha &quot;Serrasalmus irritans&quot;, Peters 1877, based on a specimen reported as from San Fernando de Apure, Venezuela.

==Eponyms==
Wilhelm Peters is commemorated in the scientific names of several species:

*&quot;Andinosaura petrorum&quot;, 
*&quot;Anolis petersii&quot;, 
*&quot;Geophis petersii&quot;, 
*&quot;Hebius petersii&quot;, 
*&quot;Morenia petersi&quot;, and 
*&quot;Tracheloptychus petersi&quot;.
