<text>Chaco Culture National Historical Park is a United States National Historical Park in the American Southwest hosting a large concentration of pre-Columbian indigenous ruins of pueblos. The park is located in northwestern New Mexico, between Albuquerque and Farmington, in a remote canyon cut by the Chaco Wash. Containing the most sweeping collection of ancient ruins north of Mexico, the park preserves one of the most important cultural and historical areas in the United States.

Between AD 900 and 1150, Chaco Canyon was a major cultural center for the Ancestral Puebloans. Chacoans quarried sandstone blocks and hauled timber from great distances, assembling fifteen major complexes that remained the largest buildings ever built in North America until the 19th century. Evidence of archaeoastronomy at Chaco has been proposed, with the &quot;Sun Dagger&quot; petroglyph at Fajada Butte a popular example. Many Chacoan buildings may have been aligned to capture the solar and lunar cycles, requiring generations of astronomical observations and centuries of skillfully coordinated construction. Climate change is thought to have led to the emigration of Chacoans and the eventual abandonment of the canyon, beginning with a fifty-year drought commencing in 1130.

A UNESCO World Heritage Site located in the arid and sparsely populated Four Corners region, the Chacoan cultural sites are fragile—concerns of erosion caused by tourists have led to the closure of Fajada Butte to the public. The sites are considered sacred ancestral homelands by the Hopi and Pueblo people, who maintain oral accounts of their historical migration from Chaco and their spiritual relationship to the land. Although park preservation efforts can conflict with native religious beliefs, tribal representatives work closely with the National Park Service to share their knowledge and respect the heritage of the Chacoan culture.

The park is on the Trails of the Ancients Byway, one of the designated New Mexico Scenic Byways.

== Geography ==
Chaco Canyon lies within the San Juan Basin, atop the vast Colorado Plateau, surrounded by the Chuska Mountains to the west, the San Juan Mountains to the north, and the San Pedro Mountains to the east. Ancient Chacoans drew upon dense forests of oak, piñon, ponderosa pine, and juniper to obtain timber and other resources. The canyon itself, located within lowlands circumscribed by dune fields, ridges, and mountains, is aligned along a roughly northwest-to-southeast axis and is rimmed by flat massifs known as mesas. Large gaps between the southwestern cliff faces—side canyons known as &quot;rincons&quot;—were critical in funneling rain-bearing storms into the canyon and boosting local precipitation levels. The principal Chacoan complexes, such as Pueblo Bonito, Nuevo Alto, and Kin Kletso, have elevations of .

The alluvial canyon floor slopes downward to the northwest at a gentle grade of ; it is bisected by the Chaco Wash, an arroyo that rarely has water. The canyon&#x27;s main aquifers were too deep to be of use to ancient Chacoans: only several smaller and shallower sources supported the small springs that sustained them. Today, aside from occasional storm runoff coursing through arroyos, substantial surface water—springs, pools, wells—is virtually nonexistent.

== Geology ==
After the Pangaean supercontinent sundered during the Cretaceous period, the region became part of a shifting transition zone between a shallow inland sea—the Western Interior Seaway—and a band of plains and low hills to the west. A sandy and swampy coastline oscillated east and west, alternately submerging and uncovering the area atop the present Colorado Plateau that Chaco Canyon now occupies.

The Chaco Wash flowed across the upper strata of what is now the Chacra Mesa, cutting into it and gouging out a broad canyon over the course of millions of years. The mesa comprises sandstone and shale formations dating from the Late Cretaceous, which are of the Mesaverde Group. The canyon bottomlands were further eroded, exposing Menefee Shale bedrock; this was subsequently buried under roughly of sediment. The canyon and mesa lie within the &quot;Chaco Core&quot;—which is distinct from the wider Chaco Plateau, a flat region of grassland with infrequent stands of timber. As the Continental Divide is only east of the canyon, geological characteristics and different patterns of drainage differentiate these two regions both from each other and from the nearby Chaco Slope, the Gobernador Slope, and the Chuska Valley.

== Climate ==
An arid region of high xeric scrubland and desert steppe, the canyon and wider basin average of rainfall annually; the park averages . Chaco Canyon lies on the leeward side of extensive mountain ranges to the south and west, resulting in a rainshadow effect that fosters the prevailing lack of moisture in the region. The region sees four distinct seasons. Rainfall is most likely between July and September, while May and June are the driest months. Orographic precipitation, which results from moisture wrung out of storm systems ascending the mountain ranges around Chaco Canyon, is responsible for most of the summer and winter precipitation, and rainfall increases with higher elevation.

Chaco endures remarkable climatic extremes: temperatures range between , and may swing 60°F (33°C) in a single day. The region averages fewer than 150frost-free days per year, and the local climate swings wildly from years of plentiful rainfall to prolonged drought. The heavy influence of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation contributes to the canyon&#x27;s fickle climate.

== Flora and fauna ==
Chacoan flora typifies that of North American high deserts: sagebrush and several species of cactus are interspersed with dry scrub forests of piñon and juniper, the latter primarily on the mesa tops. The canyon is far drier than other parts of New Mexico located at similar latitudes and elevations, and it lacks the temperate coniferous forests plentiful to the east. The prevailing sparseness of plants and wildlife was echoed in ancient times, when overpopulation, expanding cultivation, overhunting, habitat destruction, and drought may have led the Chacoans to strip the canyon of wild plants and game. It has been suggested that even during wet periods the canyon was able to sustain only 2,000 people.

Among Chacoan mammals are the plentiful coyote (&quot;Canis latrans&quot;); mule deer, elk, and pronghorn also live within the canyon, although they are rarely encountered by visitors. Important smaller carnivores include bobcats, badgers, foxes, and two species of skunk. The park hosts abundant populations of rodents, including several prairie dog towns. Small colonies of bats are present during the summer. The local shortage of water means that relatively few bird species are present; these include roadrunners, large hawks (such as Cooper&#x27;s hawks and American kestrels), owls, vultures, and ravens, although they are less abundant in the canyon than in the wetter mountain ranges to the east. Sizeable populations of smaller birds, including warblers, sparrows, and house finches, are also common. Three species of hummingbirds are present: one is the tiny but highly pugnacious rufous hummingbird, which compete intensely with the more mild-tempered black-chinned hummingbirds for breeding habitat in shrubs or trees located near water. Prairie rattlesnakes are occasionally seen in the backcountry, although skinks and various other lizards are far more abundant.

== History ==
=== Archaic–Early Basketmakers ===
The first people in the San Juan Basin were hunter-gatherers: the Archaic–Early Basketmaker people. These small bands descended from nomadic Clovis big-game hunters who arrived in the Southwest around 10,000 BC. More than 70 campsites from this period, carbon-dated to the period 7000–1500 BC and mostly consisting of stone chips and other leavings, were found in Atlatl Cave and elsewhere within Chaco Canyon, with at least one of the sites located on the canyon floor near an exposed arroyo. The Archaic–Early Basketmaker people were nomadic or semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who over time began making baskets to store gathered plants. By the end of the period, some people cultivated food. Excavation of their campsites and rock shelters has revealed that they made tools, gathered wild plants, and killed and processed game. Slab-lined storage cists indicate a change from a wholly nomadic lifestyle.

=== Ancestral Puebloans ===
By 900 BC, Archaic people lived at Atlatl Cave and similar sites. They left little evidence of their presence in Chaco Canyon. By AD 490, their descendants, of the Late Basketmaker II Era, farmed lands around Shabik&#x27;eshchee Village and other pit-house settlements at Chaco.

A small population of Basketmakers remained in the Chaco Canyon area. The broad arc of their cultural elaboration culminated around 800, during the Pueblo I Era, when they were building crescent-shaped stone complexes, each comprising four to five residential suites abutting subterranean &quot;kivas&quot;, large enclosed areas reserved for rites. Such structures characterize the &quot;Early Pueblo People&quot;. By 850, the Ancient Pueblo population had rapidly expanded: groups resided in larger, more densely populated pueblos. Strong evidence attests to a canyon-wide turquoise processing and trading industry dating from the tenth century. Around then, the first section of Pueblo Bonito was built: a curved row of 50 rooms near its present north wall. Archaeogenomic analysis of the mitochondria of nine skeletons from high-status graves in Pueblo Bonito determined that members of an elite matriline were interred here for approximately 330 years between 800 and 1130, suggesting continuity with the matrilineal succession practices of many Pueblo nations today.

The cohesive Chacoan system began unravelling around 1140, perhaps triggered by an extreme fifty-year drought that began in 1130; chronic climatic instability, including a series of severe droughts, again struck the region between 1250 and 1450. Poor water management led to arroyo cutting; deforestation was extensive and economically devastating: timber for construction had to be hauled instead from outlying mountain ranges such as the Chuska mountains, which are more than to the west. Outlying communities began to depopulate and, by the end of the century, the buildings in the central canyon had been neatly sealed and abandoned.

Some scholars suggest that violence and warfare, perhaps involving cannibalism, impelled the evacuations. Hints of such include dismembered bodies—dating from Chacoan times—found at two sites within the central canyon. Yet Chacoan complexes showed little evidence of being defended or defensively sited high on cliff faces or atop mesas. Only several minor sites at Chaco have evidence of the large-scale burning that would suggest enemy raids. Archaeological and cultural evidence leads scientists to believe people from this region migrated south, east, and west into the valleys and drainages of the Little Colorado River, the Rio Puerco, and the Rio Grande. Anthropologist Joseph Tainter deals at length with the structure and decline of Chaco civilization in his 1988 study &quot;The Collapse of Complex Societies&quot;.

=== Athabaskan succession ===
Numic-speaking peoples, such as the Ute and Shoshone, were present on the Colorado Plateau beginning in the 12th century. Nomadic Southern Athabaskan-speaking peoples, such as the Apache and Navajo, succeeded the Pueblo people in this region by the 15th century. In the process, they acquired Chacoan customs and agricultural skills. Ute tribal groups also frequented the region, primarily during hunting and raiding expeditions. The modern Navajo Nation lies west of Chaco Canyon, and many Navajo live in surrounding areas.

=== Excavation and protection ===
The first documented trip through Chaco Canyon was an 1823 expedition led by New Mexican governor José Antonio Vizcarra when the area was under Mexican rule. He noted several large ruins in the canyon.
The American trader Josiah Gregg wrote about the ruins of Chaco Canyon, referring in 1832 to Pueblo Bonito as &quot;built of fine-grit sandstone&quot;. In 1849, a U.S. Army detachment passed through and surveyed the ruins, following United States acquisition of the Southwest with its victory in the Mexican War in 1848. The canyon was so remote, however, that it was scarcely visited over the next 50 years. After brief reconnaissance work by Smithsonian scholars in the 1870s, formal archaeological work began in 1896 when a party from the American Museum of Natural History based in New York City—the Hyde Exploring Expedition—began excavating Pueblo Bonito. Spending five summers in the region, they sent more than 60,000 artifacts back to New York and operated a series of trading posts in the area.

In 1901 Richard Wetherill, who had worked for the Hyde expedition, claimed a homestead of that included Pueblo Bonito, Pueblo del Arroyo, and Chetro Ketl. While investigating Wetherill&#x27;s land claim, federal land agent Samuel J. Holsinger detailed the physical setting of the canyon and the sites, noted prehistoric road segments and stairways above Chetro Ketl, and documented prehistoric dams and irrigation systems. His report went unpublished and unheeded. It urged the creation of a national park to safeguard Chacoan sites.

The next year, Edgar Lee Hewett, president of New Mexico Normal University (later renamed New Mexico Highlands University), mapped many Chacoan sites. Hewett and others helped enact the Federal Antiquities Act of 1906, the first U.S. law to protect relics; it was, in effect, a direct consequence of Wetherill&#x27;s controversial activities at Chaco (including amateur excavations, reuse of ruin materials for building, and a large livestock ranching operation). The Act also authorized the President to establish national monuments: on March 11, 1907, Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed Chaco Canyon National Monument. Wetherill relinquished his land claims.
In 1920, the National Geographic Society began an archaeological examination of Chaco Canyon and appointed Neil Judd, then 32, to head the project. After a reconnaissance trip that year, Judd proposed to excavate Pueblo Bonito, the largest ruin at Chaco. Beginning in 1921, Judd spent seven field seasons at Chaco. Living and working conditions were spartan at best. In his memoirs, Judd noted dryly that &quot;Chaco Canyon has its limitations as a summer resort&quot;. By 1925, Judd&#x27;s excavators had removed 100,000 short tons of overburden, using a team of &quot;35 or more Indians, ten white men, and eight or nine horses&quot;. Judd&#x27;s team found only 69 hearths in the ruin, a puzzling discovery as winters are cold at Chaco. Judd sent A. E. Douglass more than 90 specimens for tree-ring dating, then in its infancy. At that time, Douglass had only a &quot;floating&quot; chronology. it was not until 1929 that a Judd-led team found the &quot;missing link&quot;. Most of the beams used at Chaco were cut between 1033 and 1092, the height of construction there.

In 1949, the University of New Mexico deeded over adjoining lands to form an expanded Chaco Canyon National Monument. In return, the university maintained scientific research rights to the area. By 1959, the National Park Service had constructed a park visitor center, staff housing, and campgrounds. As a historic property of the National Park Service, the National Monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. In 1971, researchers Robert Lister and James Judge established the &quot;Chaco Center&quot;, a division for cultural research that functioned as a joint project between the University of New Mexico and the National Park Service. A number of multi-disciplinary research projects, archaeological surveys, and limited excavations began during this time. The Chaco Center extensively surveyed the Chacoan roads, well-constructed and strongly reinforced thoroughfares radiating from the central canyon.

The richness of the cultural remains at park sites led to the expansion of the small National Monument into the Chaco Culture National Historical Park on December 19, 1980, when an additional were added to the protected area. In 1987, the park was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. To safeguard Chacoan sites on adjacent Bureau of Land Management and Navajo Nation lands, the Park Service developed the multi-agency Chaco Culture Archaeological Protection Site program. These initiatives have identified more than 2,400 archeological sites within the current park&#x27;s boundaries; only a small percentage of these have been excavated.

== Management ==

Chaco Culture National Historical Park is managed by the National Park Service, a federal agency within the Department of the Interior; neighboring federal lands hosting Chacoan roads are controlled by the Bureau of Land Management. In the 2002–03 fiscal year, the park&#x27;s total annual operating budget was $1.434 million. The park has a visitor center featuring the &quot;Chaco Collection Museum&quot;, which has not been open to the public since being completed in 2017, an information desk, a theater, a book store, an observatory, and a gift shop. Visits to the Chaco Collection at the Hibben Center on the University of New Mexico Albuquerque campus can be arranged by appointment. Prior to the 1980s, archeological excavations within current park boundaries were intensive: compound walls were dismantled or demolished, and thousands of artifacts were extracted. Starting in 1981, a new approach, informed by traditional Hopi and Pueblo beliefs, stopped such intrusions. Remote sensing, anthropological study of Indian oral traditions, and dendrochronology—which left Chacoan relics undisturbed—were pursued. In this vein, the &quot;Chaco American Indian Consultation Committee&quot; was established in 1991 to give Navajo, Hopi, Pueblo, and other Indian representatives a voice in park oversight.

Current park policy mandates partial restoration of excavated sites. &quot;Backfilling&quot;, or re-burying excavated sites with sand, is one such means. Other measures attempt to safeguard the area&#x27;s ancient ambience and mystique, such as the &quot;Chaco Night Sky Program&quot;, which seeks to eliminate the effect of light pollution on the park&#x27;s acclaimed night skies; under the program, some 14,000 visitors make use of the Chaco Observatory (inaugurated in 1998), park telescopes, and astronomy-related programs. The park was named a Gold-tier Dark Sky Park by the International Dark-Sky Association in 2013. Chacoan relics outside the current park&#x27;s boundaries have been threatened by development: an example was the proposed competitive leasing of federal lands in the San Juan Basin for surface coal mining beginning in 1983. As ample coal deposits abut the park, this strip mining threatened the web of ancient Chacoan roads. The year-long &quot;Chaco Roads Project&quot; thus documented the roads, which were later protected from mining.

As archaeological significance extends beyond the park&#x27;s boundaries, the United States Department of the Interior intends to withdraw a 10-mile buffer zone around the park from development.

== Sites ==
The Chacoans built their complexes along a stretch of canyon floor, with the walls of some structures aligned cardinally and others aligned with the 18.6-year cycle of minimum and maximum moonrise and moonset.

=== Central canyon ===
The central portion of the canyon contains the largest Chacoan complexes. The most studied is Pueblo Bonito. Covering almost and comprising at least 650 rooms, it is the largest great house; in parts of the complex, the structure was four stories high. The builders&#x27; use of core-and-veneer architecture and multi-story construction necessitated massive masonry walls up to thick. Pueblo Bonito is divided into two sections by a wall precisely aligned to run north–south, bisecting the central plaza. A great kiva was placed on either side of the wall, creating a symmetrical pattern common to many Chacoan great houses. The scale of the complex, upon completion, rivaled that of the Colosseum. Nearby is Pueblo del Arroyo, which was founded between AD 1050 and 1075 and completed in the early 12th century; it sits at a drainage outlet known as South Gap.


Casa Rinconada, isolated from the other central sites, sits to the south side of Chaco Wash, adjacent to a Chacoan road leading to a set of steep stairs that reached the top of Chacra Mesa. Its sole kiva stands alone, with no residential or support structures whatsoever; it did once have a passageway leading from the underground kiva to several above-ground levels. Chetro Ketl, located near Pueblo Bonito, bears the typical &#x27;D&#x27;-shape of many other central complexes. Begun between 1020 and 1050, its 450–550 rooms shared one great kiva. Experts estimate that it took 29,135man-hours to erect Chetro Ketl alone; Hewett estimated that it took the wood of 5,000 trees and 50 million stone blocks.

Kin Kletso (&quot;Yellow House&quot;) was a medium-sized complex located west of Pueblo Bonito. It shows strong evidence of construction and occupation by Pueblo peoples from the northern San Juan Basin. Its rectangular shape and design is related to the Pueblo II cultural group, rather than the Pueblo III style or its Chacoan variant. It contains 55 rooms, four ground-floor &quot;kivas&quot;, and a two-story cylindrical tower that may have functioned as a &quot;kiva&quot; or religious center. Evidence of an obsidian-processing industry was discovered near the village, which was erected between 1125 and 1130.

Pueblo Alto is a great house of 89 rooms located on a mesa top near the middle of Chaco Canyon, from Pueblo Bonito; it was begun between AD 1020 and 1050 during a wider building boom throughout the canyon. Its location made the community visible to most of the inhabitants of the San Juan Basin; indeed, it was only north of Tsin Kletzin, on the opposite side of the canyon. The community was the center of a bead- and turquoise-processing industry that influenced the development of all villages in the canyon; chert tool production was common. Research at the site conducted by archaeologist Tom Windes suggests only a handful of families, perhaps as few as five to twenty, lived in the complex; this may imply that Pueblo Alto served a primarily non-residential role. Another great house, Nuevo Alto, was built on the north mesa near Pueblo Alto; it was founded in the late 12th century, a time when the Chacoan population was declining.

=== Outliers ===
Another cluster of great houses lies in Chaco&#x27;s northern reaches; among the largest is Casa Chiquita (&quot;Small House&quot;), a village built in the 1080s, when, in a period of ample rainfall, Chacoan culture was expanding. Its layout featured a smaller, squarer profile; it also lacked the open plazas and separate kivas of its predecessors. Larger, squarer blocks of stone were used in the masonry; kivas were designed in the northern Mesa Verdean tradition. Two miles down the canyon is Peñasco Blanco (&quot;White Bluff&quot;), an arc-shaped compound built atop the canyon&#x27;s southern rim in five distinct stages between 900 and 1125. A nearby cliff painting (the &quot;Supernova Platograph&quot;) may record the sighting of the SN 1054 supernova on July 5, 1054.

Hungo Pavi, located from Una Vida, measured in circumference. Initial probes revealed 72 ground-level rooms, with structures reaching four stories in height; one large circular kiva has been identified. Kin Nahasbas, built in either the 9th or 10th century, is sited slightly north of Una Vida, positioned at the foot of the north mesa. Limited excavation of it has taken place. Tsin Kletzin (&quot;Charcoal Place&quot;), a compound located on the Chacra Mesa and positioned above Casa Rinconada, is due south of Pueblo Alto, on the opposite side of the canyon. Nearby is Weritos Dam, a massive earthen structure that scientists believe provided Tsin Kletzin with all of its domestic water. The dam worked by retaining stormwater runoff in a reservoir. Massive amounts of silt accumulated during flash floods would have forced the residents to regularly rebuild the dam and dredge the catchment area.

Deeper in the canyon, Una Vida (&quot;One Life&quot;) is one of the three oldest great houses; construction began around 900. Comprising at least two stories and 124 rooms, it shares an arc or D-shaped design with its contemporaries, Peñasco Blanco and Pueblo Bonito, but has a unique &quot;dog leg&quot; addition made necessary by topography. It is located in one of the canyon&#x27;s major side drainages, near Gallo Wash, and was massively expanded after 930. Wijiji (&quot;black greasewood&quot;), comprising just more than one hundred rooms, is the smallest of the great houses. Built between 1110 and 1115, it was the last Chacoan great house to be constructed. Somewhat isolated within the narrow wash, it is positioned from neighboring Una Vida. Directly north are communities even more remote: Salmon Ruins and Aztec Ruins, sited on the San Juan and Animas Rivers near Farmington, were built during a thirty-year wet period commencing in 1100. Some directly south of Chaco Canyon, on the Great South Road, lies another cluster of outlying communities. The largest, Kin Nizhoni, stands atop a mesa surrounded by marshy bottomlands.

Casamero Pueblo is located on McKinley County Road 19, near Tecolote Mesa, a red sandstone mesa. It was connected to its nearby outlier, Andrews Ranch, by a Chacoan road. Chaco Canyon, Aztec Ruins, Salmon Ruins, and Casamero Pueblo are on the Trail of the Ancients Scenic Byway.

== Ruins ==

=== Great houses ===
Immense complexes known as &quot;great houses&quot; embodied worship at Chaco. The Chacoans used masonry techniques unique for their time, and their building constructions lasted decades and even centuries. As architectural forms evolved and centuries passed, the houses kept several core traits. Most apparent is their sheer bulk; complexes averaged more than 200 rooms each, and some enclosed up to 700 rooms. Individual rooms were substantial in size, with higher ceilings than Ancestral Puebloan works of preceding periods. They were well-planned: vast sections or wings erected were finished in a single stage, rather than in increments. Houses generally faced the south, and plaza areas were almost always girt with edifices of sealed-off rooms or high walls. Houses often stood four or five stories tall, with single-story rooms facing the plaza; room blocks were terraced to allow the tallest sections to compose the pueblo&#x27;s rear edifice. Rooms were often organized into suites, with front rooms larger than rear, interior, and storage rooms or areas.

Ceremonial structures known as &quot;kivas&quot; were built in proportion to the number of rooms in a pueblo. One small &quot;kiva&quot; was built for roughly every 29 rooms. Nine complexes each hosted an oversized great kiva, each up to in diameter. T-shaped doorways and stone lintels marked all Chacoan kivas. Although simple and compound walls were often used, great houses were primarily constructed of core-and-veneer walls: two parallel load-bearing walls comprising dressed, flat sandstone blocks bound in clay mortar were erected. Gaps between walls were packed with rubble, forming the wall&#x27;s core. Walls were then covered in a veneer of small sandstone pieces, which were pressed into a layer of binding mud. These surfacing stones were often placed in distinctive patterns. The Chacoan structures altogether required the wood of 200,000 coniferous trees, mostly hauled—on foot—from mountain ranges up to away.

=== Uses ===
The meticulously designed buildings composing the larger Chacoan complexes did not emerge until around AD 1030. The Chacoans melded pre-planned architectural designs, astronomical alignments, geometry, landscaping, and engineering into ancient urban centers of unique public architecture. Researchers have concluded that the complex may have had a relatively small residential population, with larger groups assembling only temporarily for annual ceremonies. Smaller sites, apparently more residential in character, are scattered near the great houses in and around Chaco. The canyon itself runs along one of the lunar alignment lines, suggesting the location was originally chosen for its astronomical significance. If nothing else, this allowed alignment with several other key structures in the canyon.
Turquoise was very important to the people of Chaco. Approximately 200,000 pieces of turquoise have been excavated from the ruins at Chaco Canyon, and workshops for local manufacture of turquoise beads have been found. The turquoise was used locally for grave goods, burials and ceremonial offerings. More than 15,000 turquoise beads and pendants accompanied two burials at Pueblo Bonito. Some researchers found data supporting existence of widespread trade of the turquoise.

Around this time, the extended Ancestral Puebloan (Anasazi) community experienced a population and construction boom. Throughout the 10th century, Chacoan building techniques spread from the canyon to neighboring regions. By AD 1115 at least 70 outlying pueblos of Chacoan provenance had been built within the composing the San Juan Basin. Experts speculate the function of these compounds, some large enough to be considered great houses in their own right. Some suggest they may have been more than agricultural communities, perhaps functioning as trading posts or ceremonial sites.

Thirty such outliers spread across are connected to the central canyon and to one another by an enigmatic web of six Chacoan road systems. Extending up to in generally straight routes, they appear to have been extensively surveyed and engineered. Their depressed and scraped caliche beds reach wide; earthen berms or rocks, at times composing low walls, delimit their edges. When necessary, the roads deploy steep stone stairways and rock ramps to surmount cliffs and other obstacles. Although their purpose may never be certain, archaeologist Harold Gladwin noted that nearby Navajo believe that the Anasazi built the roads to transport timber; archaeologist Neil Judd offered a similar hypothesis.

== Archaeoastronomy ==

=== Sun Dagger ===
Two whorl-shaped etchings near the top of Fajada Butte compose what is called the &quot;Sun Dagger&quot; petroglyph that is tucked behind the eponymous rock panels of the &quot;Three-Slab Site&quot;. They are 

It consists of two spirals—one principal and one ancillary. The latter left-hand spiral captured both spring and fall equinoxes; its artifice was revealed by a descending spear of light, filtered through the slabs, that shone upon it and split it in two. The former and larger whorl to its right was lit by the titular &quot;sun dagger&quot;, which bisected it through another interplay of slab and sunlight. Light struck it, brilliantly, as the summer sun attains its solstice midday peak. The Chacoans were said to be marking, as Anna Sofaer, artist, &quot;Sun Dagger&quot; discoverer, and leading proponent puts it, &quot;the middle of time&quot;. Each turn of the 9.25-turn large spiral was found to mark one year in the 18.6-year &quot;lunar excursion cycle&quot; of the rising mid-winter full moon. This record is kept by a slab-cast lunar shadow whose edge strikes in succession each ring. As the full &quot;minimum moon&quot; closest to the winter solstice rises, the shadow&#x27;s edge precisely strikes the center of the larger spiral; it steps outward year by year, ring by ring, until it strikes the outermost edge of it during the full &quot;maximum moon&quot;, again in mid-winter.

Fajada Butte bears five other petroglyphs—including a carving of a &quot;rattlesnake&quot;, other spirals, and a rectangle—that are conspicuously lit by contrasts between sunbeams and shadows during equinoxes or solstices. Public access to the butte was curtailed when, in 1989, erosion from modern foot traffic was found to be responsible for one of the three screening slabs at the &quot;Sun Dagger&quot; site shifting out of its ancient position; the assemblage of stones has thus lost some of its former spatial and temporal precision as a solar and lunar calendar. In 1990 the screens were stabilized and placed under observation, but the wayward slab was not moved back into its original orientation.

=== Alignments ===
Some parties have advanced the theory that at least 12 of the 14 principal Chacoan complexes were sited and aligned in coordination, and that each was oriented along axes that mirrored the passing of the Sun and Moon at visually pivotal times. The first great house known to evince fastidious proportioning and alignment was Casa Rinconada: the twinned T-shaped portals of its radius great &quot;kiva&quot; were north–south collinear, and axes joining opposing windows passed within of its center. The great houses of Pueblo Bonito and Chetro Ketl were found by the &quot;Solstice Project&quot; and the U.S. National Geodetic Survey to be sited along a precisely east–west line, an axis that captures the passage of the equinox sun. The lines perpendicularly bisecting their principal walls are aligned north–south, implying a possible intent to mirror the equinox midday. Pueblo Alto and Tsin Kletsin are also north–south aligned. These two axes form an inverted cross when viewed from above; its northbound reach is extended another past Pueblo Alto by the ramrod-straight Great North Road, a pilgrimage route that modern-day Pueblo Indians believe to be an allusion to myths surrounding their arrival from the distant north.

Two shared-latitude but diametrically opposed complexes, Pueblo Pintado and Kin Bineola, are located some from the core buildings of the central canyon. Each lies on a path from the central canyon that is collinear with the passage and setting of the full mid-winter &quot;minimum moon&quot;, which recurs every 18.6 years. Two other complexes that are less distant from Pueblo Bonito, Una Vida and Peñasco Blanco, share an axis collinear with the passage of the full &quot;maximum moon&quot;. The terms &quot;minimum&quot; and &quot;maximum&quot; refer to the azimuthal extreme points in the lunar excursion cycle, or the swings in direction relative to true north that the setting full moon exhibits. It takes roughly 9.25 years for the rising or setting full moon nearest to winter solstice to proceed from its maximum azimuthal north, or &quot;maximum extremum&quot;, to its southernmost azimuth, known as &quot;minimum extremum&quot;.

Speculation regarding the reasons for the alignments have been offered:

<doc id="925279" wikidata="Q1203004" url="?curid=925279" title="Hiraizumi">
<text>is a town located in Nishiiwai District, Iwate Prefecture, Japan. , the town had an estimated population of 7,408 and a population density of in 2,616 households. The total area of the town was . It is noted for the Historic Monuments and Sites of Hiraizumi, which achieved UNESCO World Heritage Site status in 2011.

==Geography==
Hiraizumi is the smallest municipality in Iwate Prefecture in terms of area. Located in a basin in south-central Iwate Prefecture in the Tōhoku region of northern Honshu, the town is surrounded by the Kitakami Mountains.

===Neighboring municipalities===
Iwate Prefecture
*Ichinoseki
*Ōshū

===Climate===
Hiraizumi has a humid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by mild summers and cold winters. The average annual temperature in Hiraizumi is 10.8 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1265 mm with September as the wettest month and February as the driest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 24.4 °C, and lowest in January, at around -1.9 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Hiraizumi peaked around 1950, and has declined over the past 70 years.

==History==
The area of present-day Hiraizumi was part of ancient Mutsu Province. It was the home of the Northern Fujiwara clan for about 100 years in the late Heian era, during which time it served as the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of Ōshū, an area containing nearly a third of the Japanese land area. At its height the population of Hiraizumi reached 50,000 or more than 100,000, rivaling Kyoto in size and splendor.

The first structure built in Hiraizumi may have been Hakusan Shrine on top of Mount Kanzan (Barrier Mountain). A writer in 1334 recorded that the shrine was already 700 years old. Although rebuilt many times, the same shrine is still standing in the same location.

In about 1100, Fujiwara no Kiyohira moved his home from Fort Toyoda in present-day Esashi, in the city of Ōshū to Mount Kanzan in Hiraizumi. This location was significant for several reasons. Kanzan is situated at the junction of two rivers, the Kitakami and the Koromo. Traditionally the Koromo River served as the boundary between Japan to the south and the Emishi peoples to the north. By building his home south of the Koromo, Kiyohira (half Emishi himself) demonstrated his intention to rule Ōshū without official sanction from the court in Kyoto. Kanzan was also directly on the Ōshū Kaidō, the main road leading from Kyoto to the northern lands as they opened up. Kanzan was also seen as the exact center of Ōshū which stretched from the Shirakawa Barrier in the south to Sotogahama in present-day Aomori Prefecture.

Kiyohira built the large temple complex known as Chūson-ji. The first structure was a large pagoda at the very top of the mountain. In conjunction with this, he placed small umbrella reliquaries (&quot;kasa sotoba&quot;) every hundred meters along the Ōshū kaidō decorated with placards depicting Amida Buddha painted in gold. Other pagodas, temples and gardens followed including the Konjiki-dō, a jewel box of a building intended to represent the Buddhist Pure Land and the final resting place of the Fujiwara lords.

Hiraizumi&#x27;s golden age lasted for nearly 100 years. It was destroyed in 1189, and, after the fall of the Fujiwara clan, the town sank back into relative obscurity, and most of the buildings that gave the town its cultural prominence were destroyed. When the poet Matsuo Bashō saw the state of the town in 1689 he penned a famous haiku about the impermanence of human glory:

:夏草や / 兵どもが / 夢の跡
:&quot;Natsukusa ya! / Tsuwamono-domo ga / yume no ato&quot;
::Ah, summer grasses! / All that remains / Of the warriors&#x27; dreams. (1689)

Modern Hiraizumi village was created on April 1, 1889 with the establishment of the post-Meiji restoration municipality system. Hiraizumi was raised to town status on October 1, 1953. It annexed neighboring Nagashima village on April 15, 1955. The town lost some land to the city of Ichinoseki on September 1, 1956, and again on May 1, 1964.

==Government==
Hiraizumi has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral town council of 12 members. Hiraizumi and the city of Ichinoseki collectively contribute five seats to the Iwate Prefectural legislature. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Iwate 3rd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
The local economy is based on agriculture and tourism.

<text>Sir Brendan Foster (born 12 January 1948) is a British former long-distance runner, athletics commentator and road race organiser. He founded the Great North Run, one of the sport&#x27;s most high profile half-marathon races. As an athlete, he won the bronze medal in the 10,000 metres at the 1976 Summer Olympics and the gold medal in the 5,000 metres at the 1974 European Championships and the 10,000 metres at the 1978 Commonwealth Games. He later provided commentary and analysis on athletics, particularly long-distance events, for BBC Sport.

==Early life==
Educated at St Joseph&#x27;s RC Grammar School in Hebburn, the University of Sussex and Carnegie College of Physical Education, Foster returned to St Joseph&#x27;s Grammar School as a chemistry teacher. His pupils included footballer turned manager Phil Brown, whom he tried to encourage to take up running over football.

==Athletics career==
Brendan Foster&#x27;s athletic career saw him compete in three Olympic Games, claiming Britain&#x27;s only track and field medal (bronze in the 10,000 metres) at the 1976 Montreal Olympics. In 1973 he broke the World Record for two miles at Crystal Palace with a time of 8:13.68. In 1974 he won a silver medal in the Commonwealth Games in Christchurch in a time of 13:14.6 behind Ben Jipcho before winning the European Championships 5,000m, beating Olympic champion Lasse Virén en route to Gold in 13:17.2. When the then world record was within reach, he ran the final lap in a relatively leisurely 62 seconds after establishing a commanding lead before it. In the same year he broke the 3,000m World Record on his home track, Gateshead International Stadium with a time of 7:35.1. That year, Foster was awarded the BBC&#x27;s prestigious Sports Personality of the Year award.

He established his personal best in the 10,000 m with a time of 27:30.3 run at Crystal Palace on 23 June 1978, while also winning 10,000 m gold at the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton.

Foster only placed fourth in the 1978 European Athletics Championships 10,000-metre race, but he ran faster than any 10,000-metre European Champion has run ever since (see various European countries&#x27; books about the European Athletics Championships from 1982 to 2006). Foster finished fifth in the 1976 Olympics 5,000-metre final, just 1.4 seconds behind the winner, Lasse Viren of Finland. Foster lost all his three Olympic races against Viren – 5,000 and 10,000 m in 1976 and 10,000 m in 1980. In the preliminaries to the 1976 5,000 m race he broke Viren&#x27;s Olympic record running 13:20.34. That record would hold through the final until it was surpassed in the final of the 1984 Olympics.

Foster&#x27;s final major race was the 1980 Olympics 10,000-metre final, where he finished eleventh, almost 40 seconds behind the winner, Ethiopia&#x27;s Miruts Yifter.

In 2010, he was inducted into the England Athletics Hall of Fame.

==Business, media and other activities==
Brendan joined the sports company Nike International Limited in 1981 as UK managing director. Progressing to European managing director, Vice-President Marketing (Worldwide) and Vice-President of Nike Europe. In 1988 he set up a company, Nova International with three friends from Nike. This company was later renamed to View From International, which won a contract to supply the British athletics team. The brand was later sold to Marks and Spencer in 2002 for an estimated £2m.

After retiring from athletics following the Moscow Olympics in 1980, Foster worked for BBC Television, commentating and reporting on the sport at every major event from 1983 to 2017.

In 1977, he helped organise the &quot;Gateshead Fun Run&quot;, a pioneering running event. In 1981, Foster founded the Great North Run, an annual half marathon from Newcastle upon Tyne to South Shields. The race became the biggest running event in the UK, and one of the biggest half marathons in the world. By 2014, the race had been run by over 1 million competitors, the first IAAF event to pass this milestone. Foster ran in the 2003 event for the first time in many years, after being challenged to do so by radio presenter Ray Stubbs.

Foster has also promoted sport in Ethiopia and other African countries.

==Recognition and honours==
Foster was Chancellor of Leeds Metropolitan University from 2005 to 2009. Foster was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1976 New Year Honours for services to athletics, and promoted to Commander of the same Order (CBE) in the 2008 New Year Honours for services to sport. In December 2016 Foster was given the Freedom of the City of Newcastle, the city&#x27;s highest honour. In August 2017, in recognition to his major contributions to the advancements of athletics, at a ceremony in London, Foster was awarded the IAAF highest award, the Golden Order of Merit. Foster was knighted in the 2020 Birthday Honours for ‘services to international and national sport and to culture in North East England’.

<text>Magirus GmbH is a truck manufacturer based in Ulm, Germany, founded by Conrad Dietrich Magirus (1824–1895). It was formerly known as Klöckner Humboldt Deutz AG, maker of the Deutz engines, so the brand commonly used was Magirus Deutz, and for a short time Klöckner. Most trucks from Magirus were also known as Magirus-Deutz. The logo of Magirus Deutz was a stylised M with a sharp, long centre point to represent the spire of Ulm Minster. 

Magirus is one of the largest manufacturers of fire fighting equipment. Its fire trucks are primarily based upon chassis and engines from Iveco, but occasionally also uses platforms from other truck manufacturers. Magirus is an Iveco Group brand.

== History ==
The company began manufacturing fire-fighting vehicles in 1866. In the late 1910s, it started the production of trucks and buses. These vehicles developed a reputation for high engineering standards, able to operate under the most arduous conditions. The company also invented the turntable ladder, as &quot;Magirus Leiter&quot;, which quickly became an essential item of fire brigade equipment worldwide.

Magirus had some involvement in World War II and The Holocaust, producing gas vans used for killing Jews. Magirus also supplied ladders for mobile V-2 rocket launch sites. The factory used forced labourers, mostly from the Netherlands and Soviet Union, since 1942, and in 1945, also hosted a forced labour subcamp of the Dachau concentration camp, which held Italians, Poles, Czechs, Ukrainians and one German.

In 1975, Magirus became part of Iveco, which continued producing some Magirus trucks for a short while under the name &quot;Iveco Magirus&quot; before abandoning it completely in most countries. KHD&#x27;s collaboration with Fiat ended abruptly and less than harmoniously in 1979, leaving Fiat as owner of the Magirus-Deutz brand. However, Iveco trucks were sold under the Magirus brand in Germany and other European and Middle Eastern markets until the end of the 1980s.

Today, the Magirus brand is only used for the company&#x27;s firefighting equipment section, not for the whole fleet of manufactured trucks.

===Airship ladders===
Though seldom seen today, the Magirus company produced almost all of the early, movable ladders used in the construction of large, rigid airships in Germany and the United States. The multi-extension, wooden ladders were mounted on massively constructed, wooden carriage frames with a fifth wheel-style, forward axle assembly. Although it appeared to be designed for horses, the ladders could be easily moved by two men. The carriage was equipped with four, hand screw-type &quot;outriggers&quot; that would resist the ladder from tipping. The ladder did not swivel on the carriage. It was elevated and extended only towards the front of the carriage. In the &quot;working&quot; position, the ladder had to be elevated to about an 80° angle to allow full extension to . (The maximum extended length of the largest wooden Magirus ladder is unknown, but the ones used during the erection of the Goodyear-Zeppelin Corporation&#x27;s USS &quot;Akron&quot; and USS &quot;Macon&quot; reached to .)

They can be seen, commonly, in early photographs of airships under construction in the 1920s and 1930s.

===In the Soviet Union===
In 1974, the firm was awarded a contract (called the Delta Project) for delivery in 1975–1976 of about 9,500 dumper and flatbed trucks (Magirus М232 D19 and M290 D26) to the Soviet Union to work on the construction of the Baikal–Amur Mainline (BAM). This order was the largest in the company&#x27;s history. These models were export-only options KHD products that were not offered on the domestic market in Germany. By January 1, 1975, for the first batch of Magirus trucks for BAM construction was ready to be sent to the Soviet Union. Many of these trucks are still in service today. Largely because of this single order, in 1975, export products accounted for 70% of total production by Magirus-Deutz, and the firm took the second place among the German truck manufacturers.

In 1982, Magirus-Deutz erstwhile owners KHD sold the licensing rights for Soviet production of up to 25,000 Series 413 diesel engines. These were meant to be installed in heavy USSR trucks and other vehicles.

<text>Tashi Peljor (born 15 July 1978) is a Bhutanese archer. Peljor is a scholarship holder with the Olympic Solidarity program.

==2004 Summer Olympics==
Peljor competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in men&#x27;s individual archery. Ranked as number 52, he managed to beat French Jocelyn de Grandis (ranked 13th) with 161-136. Doing so, became the lowest ranked archer to advance and even got the fourth highest score of the round. In the second round of elimination, he was defeated by Anton Prylepav. His final rank was 32nd overall. Peljor was the first male Bhutanese archer to win a match at an Olympics, and missed becoming the first Bhutanese archer of either gender to win a match at an Olympics only because the women&#x27;s matches began before the men&#x27;s did. Tshering Chhoden won her match on 15 August while Peljor&#x27;s first match of the tournament was on 16 August.

==2008 Summer Olympics==
At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing Peljor finished his ranking round with a total of 632 points. This gave him the 54th seed for the final competition bracket in which he faced Wang Cheng Pang in the first round. Wang won the game 110-100, but was eliminated in the next round by Moriya Ryuichi.

<doc id="925306" wikidata="Q7687066" url="?curid=925306" title="Tarō, Iwate">
<text>was a town located in Shimohei District, Iwate Prefecture in Japan. Today it is part of the city of Miyako.

==History==
The village of Tarō was created on April 1, 1889, within Higashihei District with the establishment of the municipality system. Higashihei merged with the Kitahei and Nakahei Districts to form Shimohei District on March 29, 1896. Tarō was raised to town status on April 1, 1944.

On June 6, 2005, Tarō, along with the village of Niisato (also from Shimohei District), merged into the expanded city of Miyako and no longer exists as an independent municipality.

In June 2005, the town had an estimated population of 4,679 and a population density of 46.3 persons per km2. The total area was 101.05 km2.

The former town is located to the east of the prefectural capital Morioka and north of the regional center Miyako with which it has now merged. The area has a rugged coastline to the east, which is a part of Sanriku ria Coast. The main local industry is commercial fishing. 

The town had been destroyed a number of times due to tsunami incidents all throughout its history. One of the earliest recorded was in 1611, but was later followed by similar tsunamis in 1896 (with 1,859 recorded deaths) and 1933 (with 911 recorded deaths). Due to its history of repeated destruction by tsunamis, two layers of seawalls in the form of an X-shaped structure were constructed. The seawalls had two joined sections forming seaward and landward levees, and ran to a total of long. It was known as a &quot;Banri no Chojo:&quot; Japanese for &quot;Great Wall of China.&quot;

The high seawalls were completed in 1958 after 30 years of work to protect Tarō. The seawalls, which could theoretically stop breaking waves up to high, were designed to divert tsunamis to the side around the town using channels and river dykes. Local municipal agencies regularly carried out annual tsunami drills simulating an emergency, wherein volunteers would close the seawall gates and residents would go to muster points above the town. The system worked well when a tsunami from the 1960 Valdivia earthquake in Chile struck the town, resulting in zero lives lost in Tarō.

===2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami ===
After years of success, the seawalls failed when tsunami waves estimated at to high struck Tarō following the earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011. Survivors said they saw some residents climb onto the sea defenses to watch the approaching tsunami only to be swept away when the waves went over the wall. Many in the town said they felt the wall lulled them into a false sense of security. A section of the seaside wall was swept away by the tsunami. Large amounts of concrete debris was left around Tarō and scattered in its bay. 181 people were dead or missing in the tsunami, with nearly 1,700 houses damaged or destroyed.

Four years after the tsunami, on 22 November 2015, a &quot;town opening&quot; ceremony was held in Tarō after the completion of 450 new houses. The new houses were built on higher ground some 40 to 60 meters above the sea level, as well as on ground that had been raised by about 2 meters. A few years later, an added 14.7-metre seawall was rebuilt in 2017. Even with these added precautions, the population of the town suffered, dropping to 3,173, which is around 70 percent of its total population in 2011.

Higashihei District was merged into Minamihei District on March 29, 1896. On March 1, 1955, Yamada annexed the neighboring villages of Funakoshi, Orikada, Osawa and Toyomane to reach is present borders.

After the March 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, it was reported that the town had been almost completely submerged by the ensuing tsunami.

==Government==
Yamada has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral town council of 14 members. Yamada, together with the city of Miyako, town of Iwaizumi and the villages of Fudai and Tanohata, collectively contributes three seats to the Iwate Prefectural legislature. In terms of national politics, the town is part of Iwate 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
The local economy is strongly based on commercial fishing, including aquaculture using the ria coast, as well as tourism. Small and medium sized factories operate mainly in mountainous areas. In the early 20th century, it was a noted whaling port.

==Education==
Yamada has nine public elementary schools and two public junior high schools operated by the town government, and one public high school operated by the Iwate Prefectural Board of Education.

=== Museums ===
A Whales and Science of the Sea Museum operates in Yamada. It was established in 1992 in response to preserve the history of commercial whaling following Japan&#x27;s withdrawal from the practice. The museum contains one of the world&#x27;s largest sperm whale skeleton specimens, as well as various other whale skeleton specimens and other exhibits on marine life and the ocean.

==Geography==
Tanohata is a coastal mountainous community situated on the rocky ria Sanriku Coast along the Pacific coast of Iwate. Parts of the village are within the borders of the Sanriku Fukkō National Park.

===Neighboring municipalities===
Iwate Prefecture
*Fudai
*Iwaizumi

===Climate===
Tanohata has a cold humid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by mild summers and cold winters. The average annual temperature in Tanohata is 10.1 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1201 mm with September as the wettest month and February as the driest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 22.6 °C, and lowest in January, at around -1.1 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Tanohata peaked around the year 1960 and has declined steadily over the past 60 years.

==History==
The area of present-day Tanohata was part of ancient Mutsu Province, dominated by the Nambu clan during the Edo period, who ruled Hachinohe Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate. With the Meiji period establishment of the modern municipalities system, the village of Tanohata was created within Kitahei District on April 1, 1889. Kitahei, Nakahei and Higashihei Districts were all merged into Minamihei District on March 29, 1896.

The area is prone to tsunami, with damage recorded as early as the 869 Sanriku earthquake. The 1611 Sanriku earthquake also caused major damage and the 1896 Sanriku earthquake destroyed most of the village, as did the 1933 Sanriku earthquake.

In 1953, the national and prefectural governments targeted Fudai for consolidation with its southern neighbor, Tanohata, following the Law for the Consolidation of Cities, Towns and Villages (&quot;the great Shōwa mergers&quot;). Merger talks continued intermittently between 1955 and 1960. The Tanohata delegation was not in favor of the merger, but because of the pressure from the prefecture to implement the government directive, they felt they were not at liberty to directly reject the proposal. At a party in May 1960 to celebrate the end of the long merger negotiations, the mayor of Tanohata drunkenly insulted the delegates from Fudai in a final effort to scuttle the negotiations. The party was abandoned, and no further serious attempts were made to continue with the merger.

The tsunami following the March 11 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami completely destroyed more than 200 buildings in the village, killing 39 residents and also destroying 512 of the 565 vessels in the local fishing cooperative. The height of the tsunami was estimated at more than 10 meters at Shimanokoshi Station, which was completely washed away. In October 2013, a sign from the village was found washed up on Kahuku Beach, Hawaii.

==Government==
Tanohata has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral village council of 10 members. Tanohata, together with the city of Miyako, town of Iwaizumi and the villages of Fudai and Yamada, collectively contributes three seats to the Iwate Prefectural legislature. In terms of national politics, the village is part of Iwate 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
The local economy is based on commercial fishing and to a lesser extent on agriculture.

==Education==
Tanohata has one public elementary school and one public junior high school operated by the village government. The village does not have a high school.

The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 22.6 °C, and lowest in January, at around -1.1 °C.
==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Fudai has declined over the past 60 years.

Fudai has been recognized by Japan&#x27;s Office for the Promotion of Regional Revitalization (Kishida Cabinet Secretariat), which promotes the development of new technologies to combat depopulation, for meeting a &quot;high standard&quot; of digital transformation/telework infrastructure. Related projects have been awarded over ¥4.8M in government grants.

==History==

The area of present-day Fudai was part of ancient Mutsu Province, dominated by the Nambu clan during the Edo period, who ruled Hachinohe Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate. With the Meiji period establishment of the modern municipalities system, the village of Fudai was created within Kitahei District on April 1, 1889. Kitahei, Nakahei and Higashihei Districts were all merged into Minamihei District on March 29, 1896.

In 1953, the national and prefectural governments targeted Fudai for consolidation with its southern neighbor, Tanohata following the Law for the Consolidation of Cities, Towns and Villages (&quot;the great Shōwa mergers&quot;). Merger talks continued intermittently between 1955 and 1960. The Tanohata delegation was not in favor of the merger, but because of the pressure from the prefecture to implement the government directive, they felt they were not at liberty to directly reject the proposal. At a party in May 1960 to celebrate the end of the long merger negotiations, the mayor of Tanohata drunkenly insulted the delegates from Fudai in a final effort to scuttle the negotiations. The party was abandoned, and no further serious attempts were made to continue with the merger.

===2011 tsunami===
The village was spared from the devastation brought to other coastal communities following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami thanks to a floodgate that protected the town. The floodgate was built between 1972 and 1984 at a cost of ¥3.56 billion (approximately US$30 million in 2011) under the administration of Kotoku Wamura, the village mayor from 1947 to 1987. Initially derided as a waste of public funds, the floodgate protected the village and the inner cove from the worst of the tsunami waves. After the 2011 tsunami, the villagers gave thanks at Wamura&#x27;s grave. The village&#x27;s only casualty was one missing person who went to inspect his boat in the fishing port, located outside of the wall&#x27;s protection, immediately after the earthquake.

==Government==
Fudai has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral village council of 14 members. Fudai, together with the city of Miyako, town of Iwaizumi and the villages of Tanohata and Yamada, collectively contributes three seats to the Iwate Prefectural legislature. In terms of national politics, the village is part of Iwate 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
The local economy is based on commercial fishing and agriculture.

==Education==
Fudai has one public elementary school and one public junior high school operated by the village government. The village does not have a high school.

<text>Raymond Dennis Steckler (January 25, 1938 – January 7, 2009), also known by the pseudonym Cash Flagg, was an American film director, producer, screenwriter and actor best known as the low-budget auteur of such cult films as &quot;The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies&quot;. In addition to Cash Flagg, Steckler was also known by the pseudonyms Sven Christian, Henri-Pierre Duval, Pierre Duvall, Sven Hellstrom, Ricardo Malatoté, Harry Nixon, Michael J. Rogers, Michel J. Rogers, Wolfgang Schmidt, Cindy Lou Steckler, R.D. Steckler, Ray Steckler, and Cindy Lou Sutters —- this last his &quot;porn name&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Raymond Dennis Steckler was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, where his grandmother, who largely raised him, nurtured his love of movies. At 15, upon receiving an 8mm home movie camera from his stepfather, Steckler shot an amateur pirate film with friends. Ray served three years in the United States Army from 1956 to 1959, being discharged as a Sergeant. He was an Army photographer, served in Korea, and spent a year at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in Astoria, Queens with the Army Pictorial Service of the Signal Corps. In 1959, Steckler and a friend drove to Hollywood, California to enter the film industry.

Steckler worked as a prop man before becoming assistant cameraman on the film &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Sinner&quot;, directed by and starring Timothy Carey. When the initial director of photography was fired, Steckler replaced him.

Continuing to work in cinematography in the Los Angeles area, Steckler acquired a union card and established himself at major studios, including Universal Studios. When he was reportedly fired for almost knocking an A-frame onto Alfred Hitchcock, Steckler turned to the B-movie circuit. Working with Arch Hall Sr.&#x27;s Fairway Pictures, Steckler started as cinematographer and sometimes actor in the vehicles for Hall&#x27;s son, Arch Hall, Jr. Steckler made his directorial debut with the Hall vehicle &quot;Wild Guitar&quot;. When Arch Hall Sr. was worried whether his film would play when the original choice of the heavy was black, Steckler told his friend he had to go and took the role under his onscreen name, Cash Flagg.

===&quot;The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies&quot;===
In 1963 he co-produced his second film, &quot;The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies&quot;, co-starring his then wife, Carolyn Brandt. Filmed for a budget of $38,000, the film was photographed by cinematographer Joseph V. Mascelli with then newcomers László Kovács and Vilmos Zsigmond as camera operators. Initially distributed on the lower half of a double-bill by Fairway, Steckler took &quot;Creatures&quot; on the road himself and made it a success under a number of titles, including &quot;Diabolical Dr. Voodoo&quot; and &quot;The Teenage Psycho Meets Bloody Mary&quot;.

Steckler&#x27;s next film was his answer to &quot;Psycho&quot;, entitled &quot;The Thrill Killers&quot;, released in 1964. The film marked the first effort between Steckler and Ron Haydock, who would be Steckler&#x27;s creative partner up until the latter&#x27;s death in the 1970s. It also notably features Gary Kent as a blood-thirsty killer.

Steckler continued to produce a number of low-budget but fanciful films which soon attained cult status, including &quot;Rat Pfink a Boo Boo&quot; (a spoof of Batman) and &quot;Lemon Grove Kids Meet the Monsters&quot; (an homage to the East Side Kids films). By the late 1960s, he also directed the music video for Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s &quot;White Rabbit&quot;, as well as promos for Jimi Hendrix, Nazz, and Frank Zappa.

==Later life and career==
With the decline of drive-in horror films of the nature Steckler was producing in the 1960s, and following his divorce from Brandt, with whom he had daughters Linda and Laura, Steckler produced hardcore adult films during the 1970s and 1980s. Circa 1986, he married his second wife, Katherine, with whom he had daughters Morgan and Bailey. Steckler named daughter Morgan after his partner George Morgan who financed &quot;The Incredibly Strange Creatures&quot;.

&quot;The Thrill Killers&quot;, &quot;Rat-Pfink a Boo-Boo&quot;, &quot;The Incredibly Strange Creatures&quot; and &quot;Las Vegas Serial Killer&quot; were first released on home video in 1986–1987 by CAMP Home Video, a small independent company based in Los Angeles, CA.

In the late 1980s, Steckler opened Mascot Video in Las Vegas and sold it in 1995 to local businessman Dan Wayman. Up until his death in 2009, Steckler continued to sell videos of his works via the web, including six volumes of young actresses and dancers in nude auditions for Steckler&#x27;s camera. Steckler says these auditions were shot in 1991 for &quot;The Hollywood Strangler in Las Vegas&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Las Vegas Serial Killer&quot;), but that film was finished by 1987.

In 2008, Steckler announced production of his new film &quot;One More Time&quot;, which he described as an &quot;extension&quot; (as opposed to a &quot;sequel&quot;) to &quot;The Incredibly Strange Creatures&quot;, and launched two MySpace pages and a website for casting actresses for his upcoming films. Steckler completed post-production of &quot;One More Time&quot; shortly before his death. It was filmed on location on the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk and Las Vegas on a budget of $3,800 using two Digital 8 cameras. The film was released direct-to-DVD via his website in 2009.

==Death==
Shortly after returning to Las Vegas, Steckler, who had been fighting heart disease for several years, died of cardiac arrest on January 7, 2009, aged 70. He was buried at the Palm Mortuary and Cemetery Green Valley.

==Legacy==
&quot;Wild Guitar&quot; was restored by director/fan Nicolas Winding Refn and featured at the Black Deer Festival in 2019.

&quot;Mixed Up Zombies&quot; had since become a cult classic as being one of the worst movies ever made and has been celebrated by fans of B movies, camp or kitsch films. The rock critic Lester Bangs wrote an appreciative 1973 essay about &quot;Incredibly Strange Creatures&quot; in which he tries to explain and justify the movie&#x27;s value:

Falling into semi-obscurity past its eccentric title (as it was also the inspiration for the documentary series &quot;The Incredibly Strange Film Show&quot; which interviewed Steckler himself in one episode), the film gained notoriety once again in 1997, when it was featured on the television series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;.

Steckler&#x27;s low-budget often meant working for little to nothing, but his comradeship was often reflected in his productions. In his 1969 film &quot;Body Fever&quot;, Steckler created a bit part for then destitute fellow director Coleman Francis, who, by coincidence, also achieved belated fame via &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;. Francis died not long after the making of the film.

<doc id="925340" wikidata="Q5475" url="?curid=925340" title="Treviso">
<text>Treviso ( , ; ) is a city and (municipality) in the Veneto region of northern Italy. It is the capital of the province of Treviso and the municipality has 85,188 inhabitants (as of December 2023). Some 3,000 live within the Venetian walls () or in the historical and monumental center; some 80,000 live in the urban center while the city hinterland has a population of approximately 170,000.

The province is home to the headquarters of clothing retailer Benetton, Sisley, Stefanel, Geox, Diadora and Lotto Sport Italia, appliance maker De&#x27;Longhi, and bicycle maker Pinarello.

Treviso is also known for being the original production area of Prosecco wine and radicchio, and is thought to have been the origin of the popular Italian dessert tiramisù.

== History ==
=== Ancient era ===
Some believe that Treviso derived its name from the Celtic word &quot;tarvos&quot; mixed with the Latin ending &quot;isium&quot; forming &quot;Tarvisium&quot;, of the tarvos. Tarvos means bull in Celtic mythology, though the same word can relate to the lion, or Leo, in Eastern astrology. Others believe it comes from a word from the language of a tribe who first came to Treviso.

Tarvisium, then a city of the Veneti, became a &quot;municipium&quot; in 89 BC after the Romans added Cisalpine Gaul to their dominions. Citizens were ascribed to the Roman tribe of Claudia. The city lay in proximity of the Via Postumia, which connected Opitergium to Aquileia, two major cities of Roman Venetia during Ancient and early medieval times. Treviso is rarely mentioned by ancient writers, although Pliny writes of the &quot;Silis&quot;, that is the Sile River, as flowing &quot;ex montibus Tarvisanis&quot;.

During the Roman period, Christianity spread to Treviso. Tradition records that St. Prosdocimus, a Greek who had been ordained bishop by St. Peter, brought the Catholic faith to Treviso and surrounding areas. By the 4th century, the Christian population grew sufficient to merit a resident bishop. The first documented bishop was John the Pious who began his episcopacy in 396 AD.

=== Early Middle Ages ===
Treviso went through a demographic and economic decline similar to the rest of Italy after the fall of the Western Empire; however, it was spared by Attila the Hun, and thus, remained an important center during the 6th century. According to tradition, Treviso was the birthplace of Totila, the leader of Ostrogoths during the Gothic Wars. Immediately after the Gothic Wars, Treviso fell under the Byzantine Exarchate of Ravenna until 568 AD when it was taken by the Lombards, who made it one of 36 ducal seats and established an important mint. The latter was especially important during the reign of the last Lombard king, Desiderius, and continued to churn out coins when northern Italy was annexed to the Frankish Empire. People from the city also played a role in the founding of Venice.

Charlemagne made it the capital of a border march, i.e. the &quot;Marca Trevigiana&quot;, which lasted for several centuries.

=== Middle Ages ===
Treviso joined the Lombard League, and gained independence after the Peace of Constance (1183). This lasted until the rise of seignories in northern Italy. In 1214, Treviso was the scene of the Castle of Love that turned into a war between Padua and Venice. Among the various families who ruled over Treviso, the Da Romano reigned from 1237 to 1260. Struggles between Guelph and Ghibelline factions followed, with the first triumphant in 1283 with Gherardo III da Camino, after which Treviso experienced significant economic and cultural growth which continued until 1312. Treviso and its satellite cities, including Castelfranco Veneto (founded by the Trevigiani in contraposition to Padua), had become attractive to neighbouring powers, including the da Carrara and Scaligeri. After the fall of the last Caminesi lord, Rizzardo IV, the Marca was the site of continuous struggles and ravages (1329–1388).

Treviso notary and physician Oliviero Forzetta was an avid collector of antiquities and drawings; the collection was published in a catalog in 1369, the earliest such catalog to survive to this day.

=== Venetian rule ===
After a Scaliger domination in 1329–1339, the city gave itself to the Republic of Venice in consequence of the Scaliger War, becoming the first notable mainland possession of the Serenissima. From 1318 it was also, for a short time, the seat of a university. Venetian rule brought innumerable benefits; however, Treviso necessarily became involved in the wars of Venice. In 1381 the city was given to the duke of Austria, and between 1384 and 1388 it was ruled by the despotic Carraresi. Having returned to Venice, the city was fortified and given a massive line of walls and ramparts, still existing; these were renewed in the following century under the direction of Fra Giocondo, two of the gates being built by the Lombardi. The many waterways were exploited with several waterwheels which mainly powered mills for milling grain produced locally. The waterways were all navigable and &quot;barconi&quot; would arrive from Venice at the Port of Treviso (Porto de Fiera) pay duty and offload their merchandise and passengers along Riviera Santa Margherita. Fishermen were able to bring fresh catch every day to the Treviso fish market, which is held still today on an island connected to the rest of the city by two small bridges at either end.

=== French and Austrian rule ===

Treviso was taken in 1797 by the French under Mortier, who was made duke of Treviso. French domination lasted until the defeat of Napoleon, after which it passed to the Austrian Empire. The citizens, still at heart loyal to the fallen Venetian Republic, were displeased with imperial rule and in March 1848, drove out the Austrian garrison. However, after the town was bombarded, the people were compelled to capitulate on the following 14 June. Austrian rule continued until Treviso was annexed with the rest of Veneto to the Kingdom of Italy in 1866.

=== 20th century and later ===
During World War I, Treviso held a strategic position close to the Austrian front. Just north, the Battle of Vittorio Veneto helped turn the tide of the War.

During World War II, one of several Italian concentration camps was established for Slovene and Croatian civilians from the Province of Ljubljana in Monigo, near Treviso. The Monigo camp was disbanded with the Italian capitulation in 1943.

The city suffered several bombing raids during World War II. A large part of the medieval structures of the city center were destroyed—including part of the Palazzo dei Trecento, later rebuilt—causing the death of about 1,600 people.

In January 2005, a bomb enclosed in a candy egg and attributed to the so-called Italian Unabomber detonated on a Treviso street.

== Geography ==

Treviso stands at the confluence of Botteniga with the Sile, north of Venice, east of Vicenza, north-east of Padua, and south of Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo. The city is situated some south-west the right bank of the Piave River, on the plain between the Gulf of Venice and the Alps.

===Climate===
Climate in Treviso has mild differences between highs and lows, and has adequate rainfall year-round. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfa&quot; (temperate Humid subtropical climate).

==Government==
== Architecture ==
* The Late Romanesque–Early Gothic church of &quot;San Francesco&quot;, built by the Franciscan community in 1231–1270. Used by Napoleonic troops as a stable, it was reopened in 1928. The interior has a single nave with five chapels. On the left wall is a Romanesque-Byzantine fresco portraying St. Christopher (later 13th century). The Grand Chapel has a painting of the &quot;Four Evangelists&quot; by a pupil of Tommaso da Modena, to whom is instead directly attributed a fresco of &quot;Madonna with Child and Seven Saints&quot; (1350) in the first chapel on the left. The next chapel has instead a fresco with &quot;Madonna and Four Saints&quot; from 1351 by the so-called &quot;Master of Feltre.&quot; The church, among others, houses the tombs of Pietro Alighieri, son of Dante, and Francesca Petrarca, daughter of the poet Francesco.
* The &quot;Loggia dei Cavalieri&quot;, an example of Treviso&#x27;s Romanesque influenced by Byzantine forms. It was built under the Andrea da Perugia (1276) as a place for meetings, talks and games, although reserved only to the higher classes.
* &quot;Piazza dei Signori&quot; (Lords&#x27; Square), with the &quot;Palazzo di Podestà&quot; (later 15th century).
* Church of &quot;San Nicolò&quot;, a mix of 13th-century Venetian Romanesque and French Gothic elements. The interior has a nave and two aisles, with five apsed chapels. It houses important frescoes by Tommaso da Modena, depicting &quot;St Romuald&quot;, &quot;St Agnes and the Redemptor&quot; and &quot;St Jerome in his Study&quot;. Also the Glorious Mysteries of Santo Peranda can be seen. Noteworthy is also the fresco of St Christopher on the eastern side of the church, which is the most ancient depiction in glass in Europe.
* Cathedral is dedicated to St Peter. It was once a small church built in the Late Roman era, to which later were added a crypt and the Santissimo and Malchiostro Chapels (1520). After the numerous later restorations, only the gate remains of the original Roman edifice. The interior houses works by Il Pordenone and Titian (&quot;Malchiostro Annunciation&quot;) among others. The edifice has seven domes, five over the nave and two closing the chapels.
*&quot;Palazzo dei Trecento&quot;, built in the 13th–14th centuries.
* &quot;Piazza Rinaldi&quot;. It is the seat of three palaces of the Rinaldi family, the first built in the 12th century after their flight from Frederick Barbarossa. The second, with unusual ogival arches in the loggia of the first floor, is from the 15th century. The third was added in the 18th century.
* &quot;Ponte di Pria&quot; (Stone Bridge), along the city walls, where River Botteniga divides into the three channels that cross the city center (Cagnan Grande, Cagnan di Mezzo, Roggia).
* &quot;Monte di Pietà di Treviso&quot; and the &quot;Cappella dei Rettori&quot;. The Monte di Pietà was founded to house Jewish moneylenders. On the second floor is the Cappella dei Rettori, a lay hall for meetings, with frescoes by il Pozzoserrato.
*Teatro Mario Del Monaco, the main theatre and opera house of the city. It was built in 1869 to designs by which kept the theatre&#x27;s original facade. The internal decorations were by the painter Federico Andreotti and the sculptor Fausto Asteo.
* &quot;Ponte Dante&quot; (Dante Bridge) crosses the narrow Cagnan river at the point where it flows into the Sile. This place was mentioned by Dante Alighieri in the third part of the Divine Comedy (&quot;Paradise&quot;). The bridge was named after the great Italian poet in 1865.

== Parks and gardens ==
* Giardino Fenologico &quot;Alessandro Marcello&quot;
* Orto Botanico Conservativo Carlo Spegazzini, a botanical garden
* Orto Botanico Conservativo Francesco Busnello, another botanical garden

== Education ==

=== Universities ===
As early as 1231 the city was looking for a doctor able to teach a course in Treviso, but it was not until 1269 that the canon Florio de&#x27; Dovari of Cremona was appointed, probably the first professor of law. In 1313–1314, it is recorded that the municipality guaranteed the presence of two Law professors, an ordinary and an extraordinary one, a third professor to teach Canonic Law and a fourth to teach medicine. Even though the city had its own university in the Middle Ages, only in recent times the University of Padua, Ca&#x27; Foscari and the IUAV of Venice established their own university campuses, giving once again the status of &quot;university city&quot; to Treviso. Classes are held at the former hospital of Battuti and the former Military District. In 2015 the University IUAV of Venice closed its campuses in Treviso, moving its degree courses to Venice.

=== High schools ===

In Treviso there are several high schools. There is the &quot;Liceo ginnasio statale Antonio Canova&quot; institute that includes the classical and linguistic high school, the &quot;Liceo duca degli abruzzi&quot; institute that includes the scientific lyceum, the linguistic lyceum and the human and social sciences lyceum.

In Treviso there are also technical institutes such as the &quot;Max Plank&quot; school institute with computer science, electronics, automation courses.

There is also no shortage of private schools in the city such as the &quot;collegio vescovile Pio X&quot;, or the &quot;Istituto Canossiano Madonna del Grappa&quot;.

== Culture ==

=== Libraries ===
The public library has five locations, three of which are located in the city center. There are also some private foundations, such as the documentation center of the Fondazione Benetton Studi e Ricerche with a library annex, at Palazzo Caotorta, the Biblioteca Capitolare and the Biblioteca del Seminario. The Liceo Canova also has an interesting library on the ground floor of its main headquarters, in Via San Teonisto.

=== Museums ===

In addition to various museums, the city also offers important exhibition areas such as Palazzo dei Trecento, the city council&#x27;s headquarters, Ca&#x27; dei Carraresi, owned by the Fondazione Cassamarca, and Palazzo Bomben, the headquarters of the Fondazione Benetton Studi e Ricerche.

* The Civic Museums, inaugurated in 1879 with the name of Museo Trivigiano (Trivigiano Museum), are today divided into three locations: the Bailo Museum, which reopened in autumn 2015 after a renovation initiated in 2003 and named after Luigi Bailo, the founder and first curator; the Santa Caterina complex; the Ca&#x27; da Noal complex, Casa Robegan and Casa Karwath, acquired in 1935 by the municipality. The various sections preserve artifacts found in the city itself or in the surrounding areas, dating from the second millennium BC. to the Early Middle Ages, works of art from the Renaissance to the twentieth century (Giovanni Bellini, Paris Bordone, Lorenzo Lotto, Tiziano, Rosalba Carriera, Giambattista and Giandomenico Tiepolo, Francesco Guardi, Pietro Longhi, Medoro Coghetto, Sante Cancian, Guglielmo Ciardi, Arturo Martini, Francesco Podesti, Gino Rossi).
* Museo nazionale Collezione Salce, inaugurated in 2017, contains the collection of posters by Nando Salce, donated to the state at his death in 1962, and now kept at the Santa Margherita Complex, while the museum seat is the Complex of San Gaetano, which displays in rotation the graphic materials in temporary exhibitions.
* Ethnographic Provincial Museum, inaugurated in 2002 and set up in the rural architectural complex of the Piavone Houses, whose original nucleus dates back to the late seventeenth century, is located within the Natural Park of the Storga River, on the northern outskirts of Treviso. The various buildings, restored and transformed into a multifunctional structure, are also home to the Treviso Folk Group,  dedicated to the protection and the promotion of the local culture.
* Diocesan Museum, inaugurated in 1988, the museum is housed in the building commonly called the Old Canons (12th century), the ancient seat of the canons of the Cathedral of Saint Peter the Apostle.
* Museums of the Episcopal Seminary, in the suppressed Dominican convent annexed to the Church of San Nicolò, seat since 1840 of the Episcopal Seminary, where there are the collections of the Zoological Museum named after Giuseppe Scarpa, doctor in Natural Science who donated in 1914 his own animal collection, and the Ethnographic Museum of the Venezuelan Indios (Piaroa, Makiritare, Panare, Warao and Motilon), founded thanks to the contribution of the priest Dino Grossa.

=== Cuisine ===
Going in order, the most typical appetizer is the soppressa, a soft cured meat cut into thick slices, usually accompanied by polenta and radicchio. Among the first courses, the &quot;&quot;risi&quot; (with liver or accompanied by seasonal vegetables such as asparagus, radicchio, peas or &quot;bisi&quot;...) and soups (in particular the simple capon broth with tortellini, the bean soup and the sopa coada) can be mentioned. As for the main course, feathered game and poultry stand out: roasted guinea fowl with &quot;pevarada&quot; (a sauce made with liver and anchovy paste), boiled chicken, goose (often seasoned with celery), spit roasted duck and capon stew.

There is also fresh-water fish and in particular eel, &quot;bisatto&quot;&quot; in dialect, fried or stewed with polenta, fresh-water shrimp, trout and codfish (in Treviso and in the Triveneto commonly called &quot;baccalà&quot;). Even vegetables are often protagonists of the Trevisan table, and in particular, the famous Red Radicchio of Treviso. Although the province is rich in cheeses (Montasio, Asiago, Taleggio, Morlacco), the most typical is perhaps the soft Casatella of Treviso, a fresh cheese with protected designation of origin status prepared with pasteurized cow&#x27;s milk.

Among the most cultivated fruits in the province are the Marrone of Combai, cherries, especially from the Hills of Asolo, and grapes. The most characteristic dessert is definitely the Tiramisù, which according to the tradition was prepared for the first time in the restaurant &quot;Alle Beccherie&quot;. Other desserts that can be cited are the &quot;&quot;Fregolotta&quot; cake and seasonal desserts such as frittelle, crostoli and castagnole for Carnival, the Easter &quot;fugassa con le mandorle&quot;&quot;, the Favette dei Morti. The most famous white wine is certainly Prosecco, and in addition to it, the Tocai, the Verduzzo and those made with white, grey Pinot and Chardonnay grapes as far as white wines are concerned and Cabernet, Merlot, Pinot noir and Raboso as far as red wines are concerned.

== Economy ==
In Treviso, artisanal production of ceramics and porcelain is widespread, as well as the processing of straw and wicker. In Treviso, in the past, Dal Negro, a company producing playing cards, was founded and had its headquarters there. Currently, in this city there is an Osram factory and the headquarters of De&#x27;Longhi. Furthermore, in Treviso and its province, some of the most famous Italian wines are produced, such as Prosecco, Cabernet, Tocai, Merlot, Raboso and other well-known varieties.

Treviso is also known worldwide for its textile and luxury production. Companies such as Benetton, Geox, Stefanel and Sisley are based in this area.

== Sports ==

Treviso is home to several notable Italian sport teams, thanks to the presence of the Benetton family, who owns and sponsors:
* Sisley Treviso (volleyball), winner of 9 &quot;scudetti&quot;, playing at the Palaverde.

The local football team, A.S.D. Treviso 2009, played for the first time in the Italian Serie A in 2005. Its home stadium is the Omobono Tenni.

Treviso is a popular stop on the professional cyclo-cross racing circuit and served as the site of the 2008 UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships.

Treviso is a popular area for cycling enthusiasts. From the city center there is an cycling path along the Sile river with connecting paths all the way to Jesolo, a seaside resort on the Adriatic sea. For road cyclists, Treviso is also a starting/finishing point for tours to the Montello hill and further into the hills of the area around Conegliano and Valdobbiadene.

<text>Rovigo (, ; ) is a city and commune in the region of Veneto, Northeast Italy, the capital of the eponymous province.

==Geography==
Rovigo stands on the low ground known as Polesine, by rail southwest of Venice and south-southwest of Padua, and on the Adigetto Canal. The &quot;comune&quot; of Rovigo extends between the rivers Adige and Canal Bianco, west of the Adriatic Sea, except the &quot;frazione&quot; of Fenil del Turco that extends south of the Canal Bianco.

Polesine is the name of the low ground between the lower courses of the rivers Adige and Po and the sea; the derivation of the name is much discussed, generally applied only to the province of Rovigo, but is sometimes extended to the near towns of Adria and Ferrara.

== History ==

Rovigo (both &quot;Rodigium&quot; and &quot;Rhodigium&quot; in Latin script) appears to be first mentioned in a document from Ravenna dating April 24, 838; the origin of the name is uncertain. In 920 it was selected as his temporary residence by the bishop of Adria, Paolo Cattaneo, after the destruction of his city by Hungarian marauders; the fortifications he ordered were already finished in 945. The viscounts of Rovigo built a line of brick walls in the 1130s in the name of the House of Este. The current Torre Donà is a remnant of the castle built some time in between; it is 66 m high and it may have been the highest brick tower at that time if the date of construction is correct.

In 1194 Rovigo became a formal possession of Azzo VI d&#x27;Este, duke of Ferrara, who took the title of &quot;conte&quot; (count) of Rovigo. The Este authority ended in 1482, when the Venetians took the place by siege and retained possession of it by the peace of 1484. Although the Este recovered the city during the War of the League of Cambrai, the Venetians, returning in 1514, retained possession until the French Revolution. In 1806 Napoleon I Bonaparte created it a duché grand-fief for general Anne Jean Marie René Savary. The Austrians in 1815 made it a royal city.

With the fall of the 1815–1866 Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia, Rovigo was annexed to the Kingdom of Italy in 1866; in the same year it was connected by railway to Padua, Ferrara, Verona (through Legnago), and Chioggia (through Adria). In the 1900s the first modern industries were established, the most important of which was a sugar refinery. In 1927 the territory of the &quot;comune&quot; was extended including close municipalities. In 1937 the course of the Adigetto Canal was diverted to the west edge of the town and a large avenue called &quot;Corso del Popolo&quot; was built in place of the former course. In the years 1943–1945 Rovigo was part of the Italian Social Republic and it has been in Italy since 1946. In the 1950s and 1960s Rovigo had a dramatic development and it had the highest urbanization rate among the towns in the Veneto region after World War II.

== Main sights ==
The architecture of the town bears the stamp both of Venetian and of Ferrarese influence. Main sights include :
* Rovigo Cathedral (&quot;Duomo&quot;, dedicated to Martyr Pope Steven I), the co-cathedral in the bishopric of Adria–Rovigo; it was originally built before the 11th century, but rebuilt in 1461 and again in 1696. The art works of the interior includes a &quot;Resurrection of Christ&quot; by Palma the Younger.
* Ruins of the &quot;Castle&quot; (10th century), of which two towers remain
* &quot;Madonna del Soccorso&quot;: church best known as &quot;La Rotonda&quot;. If was built between 1594 and 1606 by Francesco Zamberlan of Bassano, a pupil of Palladio, to house a miraculous image of a sitting Madonna with Child carrying a rose. The edifice has octagonal plan, surrounded by a portico, begun in 1594. The original construction had a cupola, which was later substituted by a simple ceiling for static reasons. The fine campanile, standing at 57 m, was built according to plans by Baldassarre Longhena (1655–1673). The walls of the interior of the church are wholly covered by 17th centuries paintings by prominent provincial and Venetian artists, including Francesco Maffei, Domenico Stella, Giovanni Abriani, Alessandro Varotari (&quot;il Padovanino&quot;), Pietro Vecchia, Pietro Liberi, Antonio Zanchi and Andrea Celesti.
*&quot;Immacolata Concezione&quot; : Church dating to 1213.
* &quot;San Francesco&quot;: church in Gothic-Romanesque style but with extensive intervention from the 19th century. The belfry is from 1520. In the interior are several &quot;Saints&quot; sculptures by Tullio Lombardo (1526).
* The Town hall, which contains a library including some rare early editions, belonging to the Accademia de Concordi, founded in 1580, and a fair picture gallery enriched with the spoils of the monasteries.
*&quot;Palazzo Roverella&quot;, largely restored but still example of Renaissance architecture, now serves as town art gallery.
*&quot;Palazzo Roncale&quot;: Renaissance palace (1555) by Michele Sanmicheli
*&quot;Palazzo Venezze&quot; (1715)
*&quot;Pinacoteca dei Concordi&quot; (&quot;Concordi Gallery&quot;) houses important paintings, including a &quot;Madonna with Child and Christ with the Cross&quot; by Giovanni Bellini, a &quot;Flagellation of Christ&quot; by Palma the Elder, a &quot;Venus with the Mirror&quot; by Jan Gossaert, and portraits by Tiepolo and Alessandro Longhi.

Within two years the resulting club&#x27;s football team of about 90% Italian players are going from strength to strength as they embrace every code that the GAA has to offer. The team colours are red and blue.

<doc id="925355" wikidata="Q33979" url="?curid=925355" title="Newar language">
<text>Newar (; , ) is a Sino-Tibetan language spoken by the Newar people, the indigenous inhabitants of Nepal Mandala, which consists of the Kathmandu Valley and surrounding regions in Nepal. The language is known officially in Nepal as Nepal Bhasa, a name that has been historically used for the language. The term &quot;Newari&quot; is also used to refer to the language, although the Indic &quot;-i&quot; suffix is considered inappropriate by some Newar speakers.

The language served as the official language of Nepal during the Malla dynasty since the 14th century till the end of dynasty in 1769 during which the language was referred as &quot;Nepal Bhasa&quot;, a term which literally means &quot;Nepalese Language&quot;. However, the language is not the same as Nepali, an Indo-Aryan language and the current official language of Nepal, which only got the name Nepali in the 1930s. Literature in Newar is one of the oldest in Nepal, dating back to at least 600 years ago.

From the start of the Rana dynasty in the 1840s until democratisation, Newar suffered from official suppression. From 1952 to 1991, the percentage of Newar speakers in the Kathmandu Valley dropped from 75% to 44% and today Newar culture and language are under threat. The language has been listed as &quot;Definitely endangered&quot; by UNESCO.

On 6 May 2024, Newar, along with Tamang and Nepali was declared as the official language of Bagmati Province. Similarly, Newar is given official status in several city governments of Nepal including Kathmandu.

==Name==

The official and historical name of the language, Nepal Bhasa, which literally means &quot;Nepal Language&quot;, originates from Nepal. Historically, &quot;Nepal&quot; was only used to refer to the Kathmandu Valley and its surroundings, where the language was native to. A larger region surrounding the valley is known as Nepal Mandala. Therefore, the language spoken in Nepal Mandala became known as Nepal Bhasa.
The name &quot;Nepal Bhasa&quot; is ubiquitous in sources from the Malla dynasty to refer to the language. The earliest occurrences of the name &quot;Nepālabhāṣā&quot; (Devanāgarī: नेपालभाषा) or &quot;Nepālavāc&quot; (Devanāgarī: नेपालवाच) used to refer to the language, can be found in the manuscripts of a commentary to the &quot;Nāradasaṃhitā&quot;, dated 1380, and a commentary to the &quot;Amarkośa&quot;, dated 1386. Some inscriptions from the Malla Dynasty refer to the language as &quot;deśabhāṣā&quot; (Pracalit Script: , ) and &quot;svadeśabhāṣā&quot; (Pracalit Script: , ). Similarly, Father Cassiano da Macerata, a Capuchin missionary who visited Nepal in the 1740s referred to the language as Nepalese.

The term &quot;Newari&quot; as a name for the language was coined by Brian Hodgson in 1847 and since then used by most western scholars. The term &quot;Newari&quot; is considered by many Newars to be inappropriate as it is the Sanskritisation of &quot;Newar&quot;. &quot;Newar&quot; is generally believed to be related to the word &quot;Nepal&quot;, possibly derived by the replacement of the &#x27;la&#x27; sound with a &#x27;ra&#x27; sound, a common practice in historical documents from Nepal. Historically, the term &quot;Newar&quot; itself was rarely used, only finding use in the travelogue of some of the Capuchin missionaries who visited Nepal during the Malla dynasty. Only two sources from the Malla dynasty use the term &quot;Newar&quot; to refer to the language or its script; the multilingual stone inscription of Pratap Malla uses &quot;nevāra ākhara&quot; (&quot;newar alphabet&quot;) to refer to the Pracalit script and another stone inscription set up by Pratap Malla in 1652 uses the term &quot;nevārabhāṣā&quot; (&quot;newar language&quot;) to refer to the language. 

In the 1920s, the language known as Khas Kura, Gorkhali or Parbatiya was renamed to Nepali. Conversely, the term Gorkhali in the former national anthem entitled &quot;Shreeman Gambhir&quot; was changed to Nepali in 1951. &quot;Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti&quot; (Gorkha Language Publishing Committee), a government institution established in 1913 (B.S. 1970) for advancement of Gorkha Bhasa, renamed itself as &quot;Nepali Bhasa Prakashini Samiti&quot; (Nepali Language Publishing Committee) in 1933 (B.S. 1990), which is currently known as &quot;Sajha Prakashan&quot;.

On 7 September 1995, the cabinet of ministers decided to use &quot;Nepala Bhasa&quot; instead of &quot;Newari&quot;. On 13 November 1998, the Minister of Information and Communication issued another directive to use the name Nepal Bhasa instead of Newari. However, the Central Bureau of Statistics has not been doing so.

A colloquial term is &quot;Newa Bhaay&quot; (Devanāgarī: नेवा: भाय्, IAST: Nevāḥ Bhāy) is also used.

==Geographic distribution==

Newar is spoken by over a million people in Nepal according to the 2001 census.
* In Nepal: Kathmandu Valley (including Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur and Madhyapur Thimi municipalities), Dolakha District, Banepa, Dhulikhel, Bandipur, Bhimphedi (Makwanpur), Panauti, Palpa, Trishuli, Nuwakot, Bhojpur, Chitlang, Narayangarh, Chitwan.
* In India: West Bengal &amp; Sikkim
* In Tibet: Lhasa

With an increase in emigration, various bodies and societies of Newar-speaking people have emerged in countries such as the US, the UK, Australia, and Japan.

==Official status==
===Nepal===
Newar was Nepal Mandala&#x27;s (then only known as Nepal) administrative language from the 14th to the late 18th century. The continued official use of Newari into the Shah dynasty is shown by the 1775 treaty with Tibet, which was written in the language, but it was gradually replaced in official use by Gorkhali. From the early 20th century until democratization, Newar suffered from official suppression. During this period, the use of the language for business and literary purposes was declared illegal, and Newar authors were fined or imprisoned.

The Language Commission of Nepal recommended Bagmati Province to provide Nepal Bhasa (Newar) the status of official language, alongside Tamang. The commission also recommends Nepal Bhasa (Newar) for official status in specific areas and purposes in Province No. 1 and Gandaki Province. At local levels, Nepal Bhasa (Newar) has official status in Kathmandu Metropolitan City, Lalitpur Metropolitan City and Kirtipur Municipality Chandragiri Municipality, Shankharapur Municipality, Tarkeshwor Municipality of Kathmandu district; Banepa Municipality, Dhulikhel Municipality of Kavre district; Godavari Municipality of Lalitpur district; and Bhaktapur Municipality, Madhyapur Thimi Municipality of Bhaktapur district have recognized Nepal Bhasa in some ways. Similarly, Bhimeshor Municipality has recognized and made policy-level decisions for Dolakha Nepal Bhasa.

===India===
Newar is an additional official language in Sikkim for the purpose of preservation of culture and tradition in the state. The official weekly publication &quot;Sikkim Herald&quot; has a Newar Edition. The Information &amp; Public Relations Department also broadcasts news bulletin in Newar.

==Education==
Nepal Bhasa is included as elective mother tongue subject in schools by Curriculum Development Committee. Tribhuvan University offers Bachelors, Masters, Mphil and PhD degree in Nepal Bhasa. Expatriates can study Nepal Bhasa at Bishwa Bhasa Campus in Kathmandu. Kathmandu Metropolitan City and Kirtipur Municipality are teaching Nepal Bhasa as a local language. Newar is taught in schools of Sikkim.

==Relationship with other Tibeto-Burman languages==
The exact placement of Newar within the Tibeto-Burman language family has been a source of controversies and confusion. Robert Shafer classified Newar as part of his Bodic division of Sino-Tibetan. George Van Driem classified Newar within the Mahakiranti grouping but he later retracted his hypothesis in 2003. Moreover, he proposed a new grouping called &quot;Maha-Newari&quot; which possibly includes Baram–Thangmi.

T. R. Kansakar attributes the difficulty about the placement of Newar to the inability of scholars to connect it with the migration patterns of the Tibeto-Burman speakers. Since Newar separated from rest of the family very early in history, it is difficult or at least arbitrary to reconstruct the basic stratum that contributed to present day Newar speech. He underscored the point that the language evolved from mixed racial/linguistic influences that do not lend easily to a neat classification.

A classification (based on Glover&#x27;s) indicating a percentage of shared vocabulary within the labeled branch and an approximate time of split:

ɫ &quot;%&quot; indicates lexical similarity/common vocabulary between Newar and the other languages in the branch. The date indicates an approximate time when the language diverged.
ɞ Van Driem labelled this branch as &quot;Parakiranti&quot; and included it together with Kiranti branch to form Maha Kiranti group. However, he would later drop this hypothesis.
ʌ All languages within this branch have extensive Indo-Aryan vocabulary. It is hypothesised that either ancient IndoAryan admixture happened before Newar-Thangmi-Baram split or that Thangmi-Baram borrowed through Newari.

==History and development==

=== Origin ===
According to the Linguist Glover, Newar and Chepang language must have diverged around 2200 BC. It is estimated that Newar shares 28% of its vocabulary with Chepang. At the same time, a very large and significant proportion of Newari vocabulary is Indo-European in origin, by one estimate more than 50%, indicating an influence of at least 1,600 years from Indo-European languages, first from Sanskrit, Maithili, Persian, and Urdu and today from Hindi, Nepali and English.
===Licchavi Dynasty===
The Sanskrit language stone inscriptions of the Licchavi period (approximately 400–750) contains frequent use of Sino-Tibetan words especially for proper nouns. Almost 80 percent of the names of places, taxes and merchandise used in the inscriptions are Tibeto-Burman in origin. It suggests that Newar existed as a vernacular language since at least the Lichhavi Dynasty. According to the Gopal Raj Vamshavali, a 14th century Newar language history book, before the Licchavis of Vaishali conquered Nepal, it was ruled by the Kirata and the language they spoke, which is referred by historians such as Shrestha as Kiranti, is believed to be the old form of the Newar language. For instance, in an inscription from 594 located in present day Bhaktapur, the area is referred as &quot;khopṛiṅa&quot; which closely resmbles the classical and modern Newar name for the city, &quot;khopa.&quot;
===Medieval era===

It is during this period that the earliest dated document written entirely in Newar was written, a palm-leaf manuscript preserved in Uku Bāhā, a Buddhist monastery in Lalitpur, which dates from 1114. Following is a line from the document which mostly deals with business transaction. 

The first inscription written entirely in Newar set up by the royal family also dates from this period; a stone inscription from Bajrayogini Temple of Rudra Malla from 1127 (NS 293).

The Newar language of the Medieval era (879 to 1769 CE) is referred as Classical Newar. It is further classified into Early Classical Newar, used from 879 to 1482, when the period of three kingdom started and Late Classical Newar, from 1482 to 1769, when the Malla dynasty ended.

In the 14th century, Newar was given the status of national language by Jayasthiti Malla. Since then, most of royal decrees, official proclamations and public notices set up by the monarchs appeared in Newar. Jayasthiti Malla himself commissioned many works in Newar like the Gopal Raj Vamshavali, a manuscript about the history of Nepal dating to 1389. From the 14th century onwards, an overwhelming number of stone inscriptions in the Kathmandu Valley, where they are a ubiquitous element at heritage sites, are in Newar.

The period from 1428 to 1769 is considered a Golden Age for Newar Literature. Many monarchs of the Malla dynasty themselves started composing hymns and dramas in Newar. Noted royal writers include Mahindra Malla, Siddhi Narsingh Malla, and Ranajit Malla. Still, there are numerous works of literature from this period with anonymous authors. Some non royal authors include Keshav Udās, Brisabhānanda and Biladātāsingha. 

Some notable women who wrote literature in Newar during this period include, Jagatakeshari from Banepa, Briddhi Lakshmi (queen consort of Bhaktapur), Riddhi Lakshmi (mother of Bhupalendra Malla), Jaya Lakshmi (queen consort of Yoga Narendra Malla). Among them, Riddhi Lakshmi is considered to be the first woman to publish literature in Nepal as her poems are the earliest dated literature in Nepal authored by a woman. 

An example of the language used during this period is provided by the following lines from a poem written by Briddhi Lakshmi.
===Dark age===

Newar began to be sidelined after the Gorkha conquest of Nepal and the ouster of the Malla dynasty by the Shah dynasty in the late 18th century. Since then, its history has been one of constant suppression and struggle against official disapproval.

Following the advent of the Shahs, the Gorkhali language became the court language, and Newar was replaced as the language of administration. However, Newar continued to remain in official use for a time as shown by the 1775 treaty with Tibet which was written in it. A few of the new rulers cultivated the language. Kings Prithvi Narayan Shah, Rana Bahadur and Rajendra Bikram Shah composed poetry and wrote plays in it.

Newar suffered heavily under the repressive policy of the Rana dynasty (1846–1951 AD) when the regime attempted to wipe it out. In 1906, legal documents written in Newar were declared unenforceable, and any evidence in the language was declared null and void. The rulers forbade literature in Newar, and writers were sent to jail. In 1944, Buddhist monks who wrote in the language were expelled from the country.

Moreover, hostility towards the language from neighbours grew following massive migration into the Kathmandu Valley leading to the indigenous Newars becoming a minority. During the period 1952 to 1991, the percentage of the valley population speaking Newar dropped from 74.95% to 43.93%. The Nepal Bhasa movement arose as an effort to save the language.

===&quot;Nepal Bhasa&quot; movement===

Newars have been fighting to save their language in the face of opposition from the government and hostile neighbours from the time of the repressive Rana regime till today. The movement arose against the suppression of the language that began with the rise of the Shah dynasty in 1768 AD, and intensified during the Rana regime (1846–1951) and Panchayat system (1960–1990).

At various times, the government has forbidden literature in Newar, banned the official use and removed it from the media and the educational system. Opponents have even petitioned the Supreme Court to have its use barred.

Activism has taken the form of publication of books and periodicals to public meets and protest rallies. Writers and language workers have been jailed or expelled from the country, and they have continued the movement abroad. The struggle for linguistic rights has sometimes combined with the movement for religious and political freedom in Nepal.

===Renaissance era===


The period between 1909 and 1941 is considered as the renaissance era of Newar. During this period, a few authors braved official disapproval and started writing, translating, educating and restructuring the language. Writers Nisthananda Bajracharya, Siddhidas Mahaju, Jagat Sundar Malla and Yogbir Singh Kansakar are honored as the Four Pillars of Nepal Bhasa. Shukraraj Shastri and Dharmaditya Dharmacharya were also at the forefront of the Renaissance.

In 1909, Bajracharya published the first printed book using movable type. Shastri wrote a grammar of the language entitled &quot;Nepal Bhasa Vyakaran&quot;, the first one in modern times. It was published from Kolkata in 1928. His other works include &quot;Nepal Bhasa Reader&quot;, Books 1 and 2 (1933) and an alphabet book &quot;Nepali Varnamala&quot; (1933).

Mahaju&#x27;s translation of the Ramayan and books on morals and ethics, Malla&#x27;s endeavours to impart education in the native language and other literary activities marked the renaissance. Dharmacharya published the first magazine in Newar &quot;Buddha Dharma wa Nepal Bhasa&quot; (&quot;Buddhism and Nepalese&quot;) from Kolkata in 1925. Also, the Renaissance marked the beginning of the movement to get official recognition for the name &quot;Nepal Bhasa&quot; in place of the Khas imposed term &quot;Newari&quot;.

Some of the lines of Mahaju read as follows:
:सज्जन मनुष्या संगतनं मूर्ख नापं भिना वै
:sajjana manuṣyā saṃgatanaṃ mūrkha nāpaṃ bhinā vai
:पलेला लपते ल वंसा म्वति थें ल सना वै
:palēlā lapatē la vaṃsā mvati thēṃ la sanā vai
The verse states that even a moron can improve with the company of good people just like a drop of water appears like a pearl when it descends upon the leaves of a lotus plant.

===Modern Newar===

====Jail years====

The years 1941–1945 are known as the jail years for the large number of authors who were imprisoned for their literary or political activities. It was a productive period and resulted in an outpouring of literary works.

Chittadhar Hridaya, Siddhicharan Shrestha and Phatte Bahadur Singh were among the prominent writers of the period who were jailed for their writings. While in prison, Hridaya produced his greatest work &quot;Sugata Saurabha&quot;, an epic poem on the life of Gautama Buddha. Shrestha wrote a collection of poems entitled &quot;Seeswan&quot; (&quot;Wax Flower&quot;, published in 1948) among other works. Singh (1902–1983) was sentenced to life imprisonment for editing and publishing an anthology of poems by various poets entitled &quot;Nepali Bihar&quot;.

The efforts of Newar authors coincided with the revival of Theravada Buddhism in Nepal, which the rulers disliked equally. In 1946, the monks who had been exiled by the Ranas in 1944 for teaching Buddhism and writing in Newar were allowed to return following international pressure. Restrictions on publication were relaxed, and books could be published after being censored. The monks wrote wide-ranging books on Buddhism and greatly enriched the corpus of religious literature.

Outside the Kathmandu Valley in the 1940s, poets like Ganesh Lal Shrestha of Hetauda composed songs and put on performances during festivals.

===The 1950s===

Following the overthrow of the Rana dynasty and the advent of democracy in 1951, restrictions on publication in Newar were removed. Books, magazines and newspapers appeared. A daily newspaper &quot;Nepal Bhasa Patrika&quot; began publication in 1955. Textbooks were published and Newar was included in the curriculum. Nepal Rastriya Vidhyapitha recognised Newar as an alternative medium of instruction in the schools and colleges affiliated to it.

Literary societies like Nepal Bhasa Parisad were formed and Chwasa: Pasa returned from exile. In 1958, Kathmandu Municipality passed a resolution that it would accept applications and publish major decisions in Newar in addition to the Nepali language.

====Second dark age====

Democracy lasted for a brief period, and Newar and other languages of Nepal entered a second Dark Age with the dissolution of parliament and the imposition of the Panchayat system in 1960. Under its policy of &quot;one nation, one language&quot;, only the Nepali language was promoted, and all the other languages of Nepal were suppressed as &quot;ethnic&quot; or &quot;local&quot; languages.

In 1963, Kathmandu Municipality&#x27;s decision to recognize Newar was revoked. In 1965, the language was also banned from being broadcast over Radio Nepal. Those who protested against the ban were put in prison, including Buddhist monk Sudarshan Mahasthavir.

The New Education System Plan brought out in 1971 eased out Nepal&#x27;s other languages from the schools in a bid to diminish the country&#x27;s multi-lingual traditions. Students were discouraged from choosing their native language as an elective subject because it was lumped with technical subjects. Nepal&#x27;s various languages began to stagnate as the population could not use them for official, educational, employment or legal purposes.

Birat Nepal Bhasa Sahitya Sammelan Guthi (Grand Nepal Bhasa Literary Conference Trust), formed in 1962 in Bhaktapur, and Nepal Bhasa Manka Khala, founded in 1979 in Kathmandu, are some of the prominent organizations that emerged during this period to struggle for language rights. The names of these organizations also annoyed the government which, on one occasion in 1979, changed the name of Brihat Nepal Bhasa Sahitya Sammelan Guthi in official media reports.

Some lines by the famous poet Durga Lal Shrestha of this era are as follows:

:घाः जुयाः जक ख्वइगु खः झी
:स्याःगुलिं सः तइगु खः
:झी मसीनि ! झी मसीनि !
:धइगु चिं जक ब्वैगु खः

:We are crying because we are wounded
:We are shouting because of the pain
:All in all, we are demonstrating
:That we are not dead yet.
====Post-1990 People&#x27;s Movement====

After the 1990 People&#x27;s Movement that brought the Panchayat system to an end, the languages of Nepal enjoyed greater freedom. The 1990 constitution recognized Nepal as a multiethnic and multilingual country. The Nepali language in the Devanagari script was declared the language of the nation and the official language. Meanwhile, all the languages spoken as native languages in Nepal were named national languages.

In 1997, Kathmandu Metropolitan City declared that its policy to officially recognize Nepal Bhasa would be revived. The rest of the city governments in the Kathmandu Valley announced that they too would recognize it. However, critics petitioned the Supreme Court to have the policy annulled, and in 1999, the Supreme Court quashed the decision of the local bodies as being unconstitutional.

====Post-2006 People&#x27;s Movement====

A second People&#x27;s Movement in 2006 ousted the Shah dynasty and Nepal became a republic which gave the people greater linguistic freedom. The 2007 Interim Constitution states that the use of one&#x27;s native language in a local body or office shall not be barred. However, this has not happened in practice. Organizations with names in Newar are not registered, and municipality officials refuse to accept applications written in the language.

The restoration of democracy has been marked by the privatization of the media. Various people and organizations are working for the development of Newar. Newar has several newspapers, a primary level curriculum, several schools, several FM stations (selected time for Newar programs), regular TV programs and news (on Image TV Channel), Nepal Bhasa Music Award (a part of Image Award) and several websites (including a Wikipedia in Nepal Bhasa).

The number of schools teaching Newar has increased, and Newar is also being offered in schools outside the Kathmandu Valley.

===Outside Nepal Mandala===
Inscriptions written in Newar occur across Nepal Mandala and outside.

In Gorkha, the Bhairav Temple at Pokharithok Bazaar contains an inscription dated Nepal Sambat 704 (1584 AD), which is 185 years before the conquest of the Kathmandu Valley by the Gorkha Kingdom. The Palanchowk Bhagawati Temple situated to the east of Kathmandu contains an inscription recording a land donation dated Nepal Sambat 861 (1741 AD).

In Bhojpur in east Nepal, an inscription at the Bidyadhari Ajima Temple dated Nepal Sambat 1011 (1891 AD) records the donation of a door and tympanum. The Bindhyabasini Temple in Bandipur in west Nepal contains an inscription dated Nepal Sambat 950 (1830 AD) about the donation of a tympanum.

Outside Nepal, Newar has been used in Tibet. Official documents and inscriptions recording votive offerings made by Newar traders have been found in Lhasa. A copper plate dated Nepal Sambat 781 (1661 AD) recording the donation of a tympanum is installed at the shrine of Chhwaskamini Ajima (Tibetan: Palden Lhamo) in the Jokhang Temple.

== Literature ==


Newar literature has a long history. It has one of the oldest literatures of the Sino-Tibetan languages (together with Chinese, Tibetan, Tangut, Burmese, Yi, etc.)

=== Drama ===
Dramas are traditionally performed in open Dabu (stage). Most of the traditional dramas are tales related to deities and demons. Masked characters and music are central elements to such dramas. Most of them are narrated with the help of songs sung at intervals. Such dramas resemble dance in many cases. The theme of most dramas is the creation of a social well-being with morals illustrating the rise, turbulence, and fall of evil. There is fixed dates in the Nepal Sambat (Nepal Era) calendar for the performance of specific drama. Most of the dramas are performed by specific Guthis.

=== Poetry ===
Poetry writing constituted a splendid part of medieval Malla aristocracy. Many of the kings were well-renowned poets. Siddhidas Mahaju and Chittadhar Hridaya are two great poets in the language.

=== Prose fiction ===
Prose fiction in Newar is a relatively new field of literature compared to other fields. Most fiction was written in poetry form until the medieval era. Consequently, almost all prose fiction belongs to the modern Newar era. Collections of short stories in Newar are more popular than novels.

=== Story ===
The art of verbal storytelling is very old in Newar. There are a variety of mythical and social stories that have aided in establishing the norm of Kathmandu valley. Stories ranging from the origin of Kathmandu valley to the temples of the valley and the important monuments have been passed down verbally in Newar and very few exist in written form. However, with an increase in the literacy rate and an awareness among the people, folklore stories are being written down. Stories on other topics are also becoming popular.

== Dialects ==

Kansakar (2011) recognizes three main Newar dialect clusters.
*Western: Tansen (Palpa), Butwal, Nepalgunj, Old Pokhara, Dumre, Bandipur, Ridhi (Gulmi), Baglung, Dotili / Silgadi
*Central: Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, Thimi, Kirtipur, Chitlang, Lele, Balaju, Tokha, Pharping, Thankot, Dadikot, Balami, Gopali, Bungamati, Badegaon, Pyangaon, Chapagaon, Lubhu, Sankhu, Chakhunti, Gamtsa Gorkha, Badikhel (Pahari), Kavrepalanchok District dialects (Banepa, Nala, Sangaa, Chaukot, Panauti, Dhulikhel, Duti), Khampu, Khopasi
*Eastern: Chainpur, Dharan, Dolakha, Sindhupalchok, Taplejung, Terhathum, Bhojpur, Dhankuta, Narayangadh, Jhapa, Ilam

Kansakar (2011) also gives the following classification of Newar dialects based on verb conjugation morphology.
*Central
**Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Kirtipur, Chitlang, Lele
**Bhaktapur, Thimi
*Eastern
**Dolakha, Tauthali, Jethal, Listikot, Doti
**Pahari (Badikhel)

Kapali (1141 N.S.) gives the following classification of Nepal Bhasa dialects based on mutual intelligibility.
*Nepa Valley (Kathmandu Valley)
** Eastern – includes the region of Bhaktapur, Sakwa and seven villages of Kavre.
** Western – includes Kathmandu and Lalitpur
*Dwalkha- includes Dolakha and Charikot of Dolakha district, Tauthali and Jethal of Sindupalchok district, and Duti of Kavre district.
* Smaller dialects based on locality
**Pyang gaan, a village in Lalitpur
* Smaller dialects based on caste group
** Gopali
** Balami
** Pahari

Other ways Nepal Bhasa is classified are as follows:-
;Bhaktapur
:Also known as &quot;Khwapey Bhāy&quot; , this dialect is more archaic than the standard. Variations exist in the use of this form of language in Bhaktapur, Banepa, Panauti, and Dhulikhel.
;Chitlang
:This dialect is used in Chitlang, a place south of Kathmandu valley in Makawanpur district. This is one of the biggest Newar bastions at Chitlang. Balami caste predominates there.
;Dolakha 
:This is the most preserved form of the language and resembles the old Newar.
;Kathmandu-Lalitpur
:Kathmandu dialect, also known as &quot;Yenmi Bhāy&quot; , is one of the dominant forms of the language and very close to the standard form of the language used in academia and media. It is also the most widely used dialect. It is spoken especially in Kathmandu. Lalitpur dialect, also known as &quot;Yeley Bhāy&quot; , is the most dominant form of language and is the standard form of language used in academics and media. It is also very widely used dialect. It is especially spoken in Lalitpur. Due to the similarity between Kathmandu and Lalitpur dialects, it is often grouped as one. Almost 95% of Nepal Bhasa publications are in this dialect.
;Pahari
:Pahari variation of Nepal Bhasa is spoken among the Pahari caste.
;Pyangaan
:A variation of Nepal Bhasa spoken in Pyaangaan town of Lalitpur district.

Religions play a register-like role in dialectical diversity though they are minor. It has been recorded from the Malla period. There are some vocabulary differences used among Newar Hindus and Buddhists but the dialects of Patan and Kathmandu are similar. Hinduism and Buddhism were present at that age and few words in Hinduism and Buddhism of Newar differs. With the recent growth of Christianity, Islam, other religions, and atheism in Nepal, the diversity in the speech registers regarding religious terminology has become more extended, such as omitting the word &quot;dyaḥ&quot; (, &#x27;god&#x27;) after the name of a deity by many people whereas it is retained in Hinduism and Buddhism.

==== Diphthongs ====
==Writing systems==

Nepal Bhasa is currently written in Nepal Lipi, Ranjana Lipi and Devanagari script. The script originally used, &quot;Nepal Lipi&quot; or &quot;Nepalese script&quot;, fell into disuse at the beginning of the 20th century when writing in the language and the script was banned, which resulted in emergence of Devanagari script. However, in past decades attempts are being made for revival.

Nepal Lipi, also known as &quot;Nepal Akha&quot;, emerged in the 10th century. Over the centuries, a number of variants of Nepali Lipi have appeared.

Nepal has been written in a variety of abugida scripts:
*Brahmi script
*Gupta script
*Kutila script
*Prachalit script
*Ranjana script
*Bhujinmol script
*Kunmol script
*Kwenmol script
*Litumol script
*Hinmol script
*Golmol script
*Pachumol script
*Devanagari script

Devanagari is the most widely used script at present, as it is common in Nepal and India. Ranjana script was the most widely used script to write Classical Nepalese in ancient times. It is experiencing a revival due to the recent rise of cultural awareness. The Prachalit script is also in use. All used to write Nepal but Devanagari are descended from a script called the Nepal script.

===Ranjana alphabet===
Classical Nepalese materials written in Ranjana can be found in present-day Nepal, East Asia, and Central Asia.

====Consonants====
Special consonant in Nepal omitted.


====Vowels====
There are 3 series of vowel diacritics – the -like system, the -like system, and the -like system.
* Use the -like system when applying to , , , , , and 
* Use the -like system when applying to , , , , , , , and 
* Use the -like system when applying to , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , 

Note that many of the consonants mentioned above (e.g. , , , etc.) occur only in loan words and mantras.

====Consonant-free vowels====

====Numerals====

*The numerals used in Ranjana script are as follows (from 0 to 9):
===Devanagari orthography===
Modern Newar is written generally with the Devanagari script, although formerly it was written in the Ranjana and other scripts. The letters of the Nagari alphabet are traditionally listed in the order vowels (monophthongs and diphthongs), anusvara and visarga, stops (plosives and nasals) (starting in the back of the mouth and moving forward), and finally the liquids and fricatives, written in IAST as follows (see the tables below for details):

:a ā i ī u ū ṛ ṝ ḷ ḹ; e ai o au
:ṃ ḥ
:k kh g gh ṅ; c ch j jh ñ; ṭ ṭh ḍ ḍh ṇ; t th d dh n; p ph b bh m
:y r l v; ś ṣ s h

Kathmandu Newar does not use ñ for the palatal nasal but instead writes this sound with the ligature as for example in the word &quot;nyā&quot; &#x27;five&#x27;. Orthographic vowel length (i vs ī and u vs ū) represents a difference of vowel length while the vowels with no orthographic length (a and ā) is indicated with the visarga (e.g. &quot;khāḥ&quot; (IPA: ) &#x27;is&#x27;).

====Vowels====
The vowels, called &quot;mā ākha&quot; (माआखः), meaning &quot;mother letters&quot;, used in Newar are:

Even though ऋ, ॠ, ऌ, ॡ are present in Newar, they are rarely used. Instead, some experts suggest including अय् (ay) and आय् (aay) in the list of vowels.

====Consonants====
The consonants, called &quot;bā ākha&quot; (बाआखः), meaning &quot;father letters&quot;, used in Newar are:

ङ्ह, ञ्ह, ण्ह, न्ह, म्ह, ह्य, ह्र, ल्ह and व्ह are sometimes included in the list of consonants as they have a specific identity in Nepal.

The use of ङ and ञ was very common in the old form of language. However, in the new form, especially in writing, the use of these characters has diminished. The use of ण, त, थ, द, ध, न, श, ष, क्ष, त्र, ज्ञ is limited by the new grammar books to the loan words only.

====Complex/compound consonants====
Besides the consonants mentioned above, combined consonants called &quot;chinā ākha&quot; (चिना आखः) are used.

====Numerals====

*The same numerals in Devanagari are:
===Romanization===
Nepala Bhasa Roman Transliteration (NBRT) was introduced in 2021, with some modifications to International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration.

==Grammar==

Newar language is one of the few Tibeto-Burman languages with a clusivity distinction.

=== Noun cases ===
Noun cases in Newar have six cases and are differentiated based on whether the term in question is animate or inanimate. The following charts provides case endings that can be affixed on the end of nouns, pronouns, and adjectives in IAST transliteration for contemporary and old (or &quot;classical&quot;) Newar.

===Sentence structure===

Statement sentence-
This language is a SOV (subject–object–verb) language. For instance, &quot;My name is Bilat (Birat)&quot; is &quot;Jigu Na&#x27;aa Bilat Khaa&#x27;a &quot; which word by word translation becomes, &quot;My (Jigu) Name (Na&#x27;aa) Bilat is (Khaa&#x27;a)&quot;.

Interrogative sentence-
Wh-question:
In the case of Newar language, Wh-questions are rather &quot;G-questions&quot; with &quot;when/which&quot; being replaced by &quot;Gublay/Gugu&quot; respectively. There is an additional &quot;Guli&quot; which is used for &quot;How much/How many&quot;. A S-word &quot;Soo&quot; is used for &quot;who&quot;. &quot;Chhoo/Schoo (with a silent &#x27;s&#x27;)&quot; is used for &quot;What&quot;, and &quot;Gathey&quot; is used for &quot;How&quot;.

===Affixes===

&quot;Suffix&quot;- &quot;&quot;Chaa&quot; and &quot;Ju&quot; are two popular suffixes. &quot;Chaa&quot; is added to signify &quot;junior&quot; or &quot;lesser&quot;. But when added to a name, it is used derogatorily. For example, &quot;kya&#x27;ah-chaa&quot; means nephew where &quot;chaa&quot; is being added to &quot;kya&#x27;ah(son)&quot;. When added to name like &quot;Birat&quot; for &quot;Birat-chaa&quot;, it is being used derogatorily. The suffix &quot;ju&quot; is added to show respect. For example, &quot;Baa-ju&quot; means &quot;father-in-law&quot; where &quot;ju&quot; is added to &quot;Baa(father)&quot;. Unlike &quot;chaa&quot;, &quot;ju&quot; is not added to a first/last name directly. Instead, honorific terms like &quot;Bhaaju&quot; is added for males and &quot;Mayju&quot; for females. Example, &quot;Birat bhaaju&quot; for a male name (&quot;Birat&quot;) and &quot;Suja Mayju&quot; for a female name (&quot;Suja&quot;).

&quot;Prefix&quot; – &quot;Tap&#x27;ah&quot;&quot; is added to denote &quot;remote&quot; or &quot;distant&quot; relative (&#x27;distance&#x27; in relationship irrespective of spatial extent). A distant (younger) brother (&quot;kija&quot;) becomes &quot;&quot;tap&#x27;ah-kija&quot;. &quot;Tuh&quot;&quot; is added to denote &quot;higher&quot;. Father (&quot;baa&quot;)&#x27;s senior brother is referred to as &quot;&quot;Tuh-baa&quot;&quot;.

==Indo-Aryan loanwords==
Newar is one of the most Aryanized Sino-Tibetan languages. Below are some basic words borrowed from Indo-Iranian languages:

==The Newar language and the Newar community==
Nepal Bhasa is the native language of Newars. Newars form a very diverse community with people from Sino-Tibetan, ASI and ANI origin. Newars follow Hinduism and Buddhism, and are subdivided into 64 castes. The language, therefore, plays a central unifying role in the existence and perpetuation of the Newar community. The poet Siddhidas Mahaju concluded that the Newar community and its rich culture can only survive if the Newar language survives (भाषा म्वासा जाति म्वाइ).

The Newars enjoyed promotions in various areas since Kathmandu become the capital of the country as they rose in ranks throughout the government, royal courts and businesses.

Newar faced a decline during the Shah era when this language was replaced by Khas Kura (later renamed Nepali) as the national language and after the introduction of the &quot;One nation, one language&quot; policy of King Mahendra.

<text>An assisted living residence or assisted living facility (ALF) is a housing facility for people with disabilities or for adults who cannot or who choose not to live independently. The term is popular in the United States. Still, the setting is similar to a retirement home, in the sense that facilities provide a group living environment and typically cater to an older adult population. There is also Caribbean assisted living, which offers a similar service in a resort-like environment (somewhat like assisted vacationing).

The expansion of assisted living has been the shift from &quot;care as service&quot; to &quot;care as business&quot; in the broader health care system predicted in 1982. A consumer-driven industry, assisted living offers a wide range of options, levels of care, and diversity of services (Lockhart, 2009) and is subject to state rather than federal regulatory oversight. What &quot;Assisted living&quot; means depends on both the state and provider in question: variations in state regulatory definitions are significant and provider variables include everything from philosophy, geographic location and auspice, to organizational size and structure. Assisted living evolved from small &quot;board and care&quot; or &quot;personal care&quot; homes and offers a &quot;social model&quot; of care (compared to the medical model of a skilled nursing facility). The assisted living industry is a segment of the senior housing industry. Assisted living services can be delivered in stand-alone facilities or as part of a multi-level senior living community. The industry is fragmented and dominated by for-profit providers. In 2010, six of the seventy largest providers were non-profit, and none of the top twenty were non-profit (Martin, 2010). Information in this edit is from an article published in 2012 that reviewed the industry and reports results of a research study of assisted living facilities.

In 2012, the U.S. Government estimated that there were 22,200 assisted living facilities in the U.S. (compared to 15,700 nursing homes) and that 713,300 people were residents of these facilities. The number of assisted living facilities in the U.S. has increased dramatically since the early 2000s.

In the U.S., ALFs can be owned by for-profit companies (publicly traded companies or limited liability companies [LLCs]), non-profit organizations, or governments. These facilities typically provide supervision or assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs); coordination of services by outside health care providers; and monitoring of resident activities to help to ensure their health, safety, and well-being. Assistance often includes administering or supervising medication or personal care services.

There has been controversy generated by reports of neglect, abuse, and mistreatment of residents at assisted living facilities in the U.S.

==Canada==
Canada has differences in how assisted living is understood from one province to the next. In most provinces, the phrase is understood as less independent than in the United States. People often require help with more than one of the activities of daily living or the more intensive ADLs like feeding or bathing. In the province of Alberta, &quot;supportive living&quot; is the distinct phrasing used for a type of care that is otherwise synonymous. The province&#x27;s &quot;Supportive Living Accommodation Licensing Act&quot; is a comprehensive act with specific prescriptions governing care homes licensing, inspections, and more.

==United States==
Within the United States assisted living spectrum, there is no nationally recognized definition of assisted living. Assisted living facilities are regulated and licensed at the US state level. These regulations include staffing, training, and quality and safety standards. This is differentiated from nursing homes, which are regulated on a federal level and are generally held to more stringent standards. More than two-thirds of the states use the licensure term &quot;assisted living.&quot; Other licensure terms used for this philosophy of care include residential care homes, assisted care living facilities, and personal care homes. Each state licensing agency has its definition of the term it uses to describe assisted living. Because the term assisted living has not been defined in some states, it is often a marketing term used by various senior living communities, licensed or unlicensed. Assisted living facilities in the United States had a national median monthly rate of $3,500.00 in 2014, a 1.45% increase over 2013 and a 4.29% increase over five years from 2009 to 2014.
===Types===

As widely varied as the state licensing and definitions are, so are the types of physical layouts of buildings in which assisted living services are provided. A resident can have an apartment, condo, private room, or shared room. Some facilities offer furnished rooms. All residents will have access to a kitchen which may be personal or shared depending on the facility chosen. The average assisted living facility is in a commercial building, yet some assisted living services use large residential buildings, known as Residential Assisted Living homes, or &quot;RAL&quot;. Residential Assisted Living homes can vary in price and amenities and can even be grouped into a separate term known as a Luxury Residential Assisted Living Home, or &quot;LRAL&quot;. Assisted living facilities can range from a small residential house for one resident to extensive facilities providing services to hundreds of residents. Assisted living falls somewhere between an independent living community and a skilled nursing facility regarding the level of care provided. Continuing care retirement facilities combine independent living, assisted living, and nursing care in one facility.

People living in newer assisted living facilities usually have private apartments. There is usually no special medical monitoring equipment that one would find in a nursing home, and their nursing staff may only be available at some hours. However, trained staff are usually on-site around the clock to provide other needed services. Household chores are performed: sheets are changed, laundry is done, and food is cooked and served as part of the base rent and included services. Depending on their disclosure of services, assisted living services may include medication management, bathing assistance, dressing, escorts to meals and activities, toileting, transferring, and insulin injections by an RN. Some assisted living providers also offer amenities like exercise rooms or a beauty parlor on site. Grocery service is often available, too. Where provided, private apartments generally are self-contained; i.e., they have their own bedroom and bathroom and may have a separate living area or small kitchen. Registered nurses and licensed practical nurses are available by phone or e-mail 24 hours a day to ensure proper teaching and/or education of staff is available.

Alternatively, individual living spaces may resemble a dormitory or hotel room with a private or semi-private sleeping area and a shared bathroom. There are usually common areas for socializing, as well as a central kitchen and dining room for preparing and eating meals.

Since assisted living facilities are not federally regulated they follow the States Fair Housing Act. Several of the assisted living residents are not familiar or do not understand this act. Legal advocates and long term care ombudsman can be utilized to ensure residents are getting the best care possible based on this act. This information should be communicated to all residents to ensure there is no discrimination in the facility.

===Typical resident===

An assisted living resident is a resident who needs assistance with at least one of the activities of daily living.

A typical assisted living facility resident would usually be an older adult who does not need the level of care offered by a nursing home but prefers more companionship and needs some assistance in day-to-day living. Age groups will vary with every facility. There is currently a transformation occurring in long-term care. Assisted living communities are accepting higher and higher levels of care, and nursing homes are becoming a place for those undergoing rehabilitation after a hospital stay or needing extensive assistance. Many assisted living communities now accept individuals who need help with all activities of daily living.

As per 2024 Assisted Living Report, 50% of assisted living residents are over 85 years; 31% are between 75-84 age; and 13% are between 65-74. Thus approximately 70% of residents are female, and 42% have Alzheimer&#x27;s or dementia. The average stay is 22 months. These movement indicate the growing need for care, specially for older persons and those with cognitive disability.

The residence may assist in arranging the appropriate medical, health, and dental care services for each resident. The resident generally chooses their medical doctor and dental services.

Residents who have periods of temporary incapacity due to illness, injury, or recovery from surgery often choose assisted living as a supportive option to help them recover quickly so they can return home. In the case of these short-term respite stays, assisted living residences act as the bridge between hospital and home.

Short-term respite stays in assisted living are also an option for families when the primary caregiver goes out of town or cannot provide the needed care.

More recently built facilities are designed to emphasize ease of use for disabled people. Bathrooms and kitchens are designed with wheelchairs and walkers in mind. Hallways and doors are extra-wide to accommodate wheelchairs. These facilities are by necessity fully compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) or similar legislation elsewhere.

A study was done on how much functional assistance residents need on a day to day basis. The results are as follows, 77% of residents need assistance with bathing. 69% of residents need assistance with walking. 61% of residents need help with dressing. 51% of residents need assistance getting out of bed. 48% of residents need assistance toileting. 26% of residents need assistance eating.

The socialization aspects of ALFs are very beneficial to the occupants. Usually, the facility has many activities scheduled for the occupants, keeping in mind different disabilities and needs.

=== Interaction ===
The shift to an acute care facility frequently results in a disturbance to the typical social routines of older individuals. This disruption can intensify the decline in their social connections and autonomy, amplifying feelings of loneliness and isolation.

Maintaining connections within social networks is crucial for individuals residing in assisted living facilities, and it plays a vital role in reinforcing their sense of identity. Facilities typically provide both organizational and environmental factors.  A study found a variety of scheduled group recreational activities such as arts and crafts, culture clubs, yoga, music therapy, prayer, and spiritual reminiscence, were offered. Additionally, the facilities in this investigation were designed with open-plan layouts, outdoor gardens, and easily accessible areas for gatherings, potentially fostering engagement and interactions among residents.

===Locked units===

Many ALFs also serve the needs of people with some form of dementia, including Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and others with mental disabilities, as long as they do not present an imminent danger to themselves or others. The sections of the building where these residents live are often referred to as memory care. In the United States, legislation enacted by each state defines not only the level of care, but often what conditions are prohibited from being cared for in such a home.
* In California, these units are not &quot;locked&quot; they are secured by alarms, delays, keypads needing a code, etc. However, they are not locked units like a psychiatric ward.

Many ALFs will work to accommodate a person with severe forms of Alzheimer&#x27;s by having separate private units. These specialized care areas are part of the main building but are secured so residents with Alzheimer&#x27;s cannot leave and possibly do harm to themselves. These care areas usually house fewer people, and more attention from the caregivers is provided.

The units, usually called locked units, focus on applying cognitive and mental activities to help keep the mind fresh. Since there is no cure for the disease, the goal is to work at prolonging or delaying the illness. If one is not engaged in an activity, one&#x27;s memory will deteriorate more rapidly.

===Cost increases===
Assisted living facilities, initially established to support older Americans in their later years, have become increasingly focused on maximizing financial gains at the expense of their residents&#x27; well-being. Over the period from 2004 to 2021, the median annual cost of assisted living has outpaced inflation by 31%, increasing to $54,000 per year.

There are approximately 31,000 assisted living facilities in the United States, with four out of five operated for-profit. Half of all operators within the industry are achieving annual returns of 20% or more, exceeding operating costs by a substantial margin. These exceedingly high-profit margins are unprecedented even within other healthcare industry sectors.

Assisted Living Facilities have the option to offer Medicare- and Medicaid-covered services, such as home health or personal care, to their residents. These services are similar to what individuals would typically receive in a private residence. ALF providers aiming for Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement for home health services need to comply with federal home health agency standards. ALFs can enter into contracts with Medicare or Medicaid providers to deliver covered home health, personal care, and other specified LTSS within their facilities for participating residents.

With an estimated 850,000 older Americans residing in assisted living facilities, the higher rents and the increasingly prevalent ancillary fees pose a significant housing and healthcare challenge for an elderly demographic that often struggles to address their needs.

===Ongoing Issues===
Instances of mistreatment, encompassing physical, sexual, verbal, psychological, emotional abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation, may manifest within an Assisted Living facility. Such mistreatment is characterized by the deliberate ill-treatment of a resident and can be perpetrated by the facility itself, fellow residents, or an external party with access to the resident&#x27;s personal information. A study conducted to evaluate these concerns in the Assisted Living community revealed that verbal and physical abuse emerged as the primary category, with 28% of residents reporting experiences of abuse.

====2011 &quot;Miami Herald&quot; investigation====
A &quot;Miami Herald&quot; article covering the newspaper&#x27;s 2011 investigation into assisted living facilities in Florida was nominated as a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. The newspaper&#x27;s investigation found that:
# &quot;The safeguards once hailed as the most progressive in the nation have been ignored in a string of tragedies never before revealed to the public...&quot;
# &quot;That the Agency for Health Care Administration, which oversees the state&#x27;s 2,850 assisted-living facilities, has failed to monitor shoddy operators, investigate dangerous practices or shut down the worst offenders,&quot; and
# &quot;As the ranks of assisted-living facilities grew to make room for Florida&#x27;s booming elderly population, the state failed to protect the people it was meant to serve.&quot;

The investigation found dozens of incidents of gross mismanagement and criminal behavior at assisted living facilities across Florida, a state of 20 million people, popular with American retirees. The newspaper requested the release of state documents related to the deaths of over 300 people in assisted living facilities between 2003 and 2011 but was denied these documents. Still, the newspaper&#x27;s investigation found no less than 70 people who had died due to the &quot;actions of their caregivers.&quot; The deaths were found to have resulted from the mismanagement of assisted living facilities and by the practices of their staff and managers who drugged residents, deprived them of basic necessities such as food and water, abused residents verbally, psychologically and physically, and neglecting their needs.

Long-term care ombudsmen, whether volunteering or employed independently, function outside the scope of Assisted Living Facilities. They actively support and defend the well-being and rights of residents within these environments. Ombudsmen conduct regular, surprise visits to these facilities, where they observe conditions, listen to resident concerns, and strive to resolve issues on the residents&#x27; behalf. Beyond addressing complaints, they empower residents by providing information on their rights and options, considering the impact on their quality of life. Mandated by the Older Americans Act, ombudsman services are directed by residents, confidential, and offered free of charge. These advocates also work towards policy changes that enhance the overall well-being of individuals in long-term care settings. Needs of residents being addressed can be as small as a change in the lunch menu or needing a new pair of glasses. 60%- 70% of the residents do not have family to ensure they are being well cared for. However, there is a large need for ombudsmen in the assisted living facility community.

====2013 &quot;Frontline&quot; investigation====
On July 30, 2013 &quot;Frontline&quot; ran an hour-long program with help from ProPublica detailing some tragedies that happened in assisted living.

Currently, around 750,000 people inhabit assisted living facilities nationwide. The industry is largely controlled by for-profit chains with a focus on both resident care and shareholder satisfaction. There are disparities in care standards, training, and the definition of &#x27;assisted living&#x27; across different states. Unlike nursing homes, assisted living facilities operate without federal regulation An accompanying written brief cites deaths of residents, facilities that are understaffed, employees that are inadequately trained, and that an overall &quot;push to fill facilities and maximize revenues has left staff overwhelmed and the care of residents endangered.&quot;

A related article by &quot;ProPublica&quot; (Thomson and Jones, July 29, 2013) states that a facility operated by Emeritus Senior Living &quot;...had been found wanting in almost every important regard. And, in truth, those &#x27;specially trained&#x27; staffers hadn&#x27;t been trained to care for people with Alzheimer&#x27;s and other forms of dementia, a violation of California law.&quot; It goes on to say, &quot;The facility relied on a single nurse to track the health of its scores of residents, and the few licensed medical professionals who worked there tended not to last long,&quot; but also that &quot;During some stretches, the facility went months without a full-time nurse on the payroll.&quot; &quot;ProPublica&#x27;s&quot; article claimed the problem was not specific to one facility and that &quot;State inspectors for years had cited Emeritus facilities across California.&quot; Emeritus replied to that claim, describing &quot;any shortcomings as isolated,&quot; as well as that &quot;any problems that arise are promptly addressed.&quot; The company cited their &quot;growing popularity as evidence of consumer satisfaction.&quot;

===Comparison between assisted living and personal care===
In Pennsylvania, personal care and assisted living are defined separately.

Personal care and assisted living in PA are regulated by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Human Services Licensing (a division of the Department of Human Services). Up until January 2011, the terms &quot;assisted living&quot; and &quot;personal care&quot; were considered interchangeable. At that time, Pennsylvania began licensing assisted living facilities separately from personal care facilities.

Chapter 2800 of the 55 Pennsylvania Code defines assisted living as &quot;a significant long-term care alternative to allow individuals to age in place,&quot; where residents &quot;will receive the assistance they need to age in place and develop and maintain maximum independence, exercise decision-making and personal choice.&quot;

Likewise, Chapter 2600 of the 55 Pa. Code defines personal care as &quot;A premise in which food, shelter and personal assistance or supervision are provided for a period exceeding 24 hours, for four or more adults who are not relatives of the operator, who do not require the services in or of a licensed long-term care facility, but who do require assistance or supervision in activities of daily living or instrumental activities of daily living.&quot;

The differences between the two levels of care are broken down into three categories:

Concept – Assisted living residences permit residents to age in place, meaning that even as their health care needs increase, they will not have to relocate to another senior living home to receive that care, such as skilled nursing.

Construction – Assisted living residences must provide residents with a private room with a lockable door, a private bathroom, and a small kitchen. Personal care homes are not required to offer these amenities.

Level of Care – Assisted living residences must ensure that residents receive skilled nursing care if their needs surpass standard assisted living services.

==United Kingdom==
Assisted living is known as extra-care housing or retirement living, allowing residents over 55 or 60 to live independently. They are offered a self-contained flat or bungalow and have staff available 24 hours a day to provide personal care. Staff help wash, dress residents, take medication, and do domestic duties such as shopping and laundry; they also prepare and serve meals to residents if provided. Residents are often asked whether to own or rent their properties independently; the average cost ranges from £500 to £1,500, depending on where the resident lives.

Assisted living accommodations often include a scheme manager or team of onsite support staff, nurses, and care staff, 24-hour emergency alarm systems, and communal lounges to socialise with other residents. Assisted living housing is regulated by the Care Quality Commission (CQC).

<doc id="925357" wikidata="Q2937934" url="?curid=925357" title="Cardiff Queen Street railway station">
<text>Cardiff Queen Street railway station () is a railway station serving the north and east of Central Cardiff, Wales. It is the fourth busiest railway station in Wales. It is located near the major thoroughfare of Queen Street and is one of 20 stations in the city. Along with Cardiff Central, it is one of the two major hubs of the Valleys &amp; Cardiff Local Routes local rail network. The station and its services are run by Transport for Wales.

In 2014, a reconstruction of the station was completed in order to reduce bottlenecks. Two extra platforms were put in (a previously existing platform, opposite platform 4, and a new platform next to platform 2 for the line to ), taking the total number of platforms to 5.

==History==
===Early history===

The first station close to the current site was opened by the Taff Vale Railway in October 1840 and was known as Cardiff Taff Vale. This station initially had one platform; a second was added in 1862 and, at the same time, the head office of the Taff Vale Railway was moved alongside the station. In 1887, Taff Vale station was demolished and replaced by a new station with the current name Cardiff Queen Street. At the time, it comprised two through platforms and a south facing bay, all covered by a large overall roof.

In 1858, the Rhymney Railway built its own terminus just to the east of Queen Street called . This was replaced in 1871 by a new station called Cardiff Crockherbtown, a short distance to the north-east of Queen Street. Crockherbtown station was renamed Cardiff (Rhymney) in 1888 and then Cardiff Parade in 1924. 

The Taff Vale and Rhymney railways became part of the Great Western Railway (GWR) in 1922. As there was no longer any need for two rival stations in close proximity, on 15 April 1928, the GWR opened a short connection just north of Queen Street connecting the Rhymney line to the Taff Vale line. This allowed Parade station to be closed and its services diverted to into Queen Street. To accommodate the extra Rhymney line services, Queen Street was enlarged from three to five platforms, with the addition of a new island platform.

===1973 rebuild===

The station remained fairly unaltered until 1973, when it was completely rebuilt by British Rail. The station&#x27;s overall roof was removed, the original Taff Vale station frontage and booking hall demolished and replaced with a modern structure, and the number of platforms reduced to three: a central island platform and a south facing bay. Modern electric lifts were installed to take passengers from the subway to the new platforms. On the east side of the station, a large office block called Brunel House was constructed; until 1984, it was the headquarters of the Cardiff division of British Rail&#x27;s Western Region.

In 1988, the entrance building was refurbished. In March 1990, platform 3 was turned into a through platform.

In 2005, the station was fitted with new ticket gates, operational when the station is staffed, which allow easier access in both directions. In 2006, LED screens replaced the old information display monitors.

The old station car park is now dedicated for private use by residents of a nearby modern apartment block, The Aspect.
===2014 redevelopment===

As part of a £220m regeneration scheme to boost train capacity in Cardiff and the surrounding areas, Cardiff Central and Cardiff Queen Street stations were redeveloped from April 2013 and June 2014 respectively. The Cardiff Area Signalling Renewal project was completed by early 2017, funded by the UK Government&#x27;s Department for Transport, Welsh Government and Network Rail.

As part of the scheme, a new entrance building and two new platforms were constructed at Queen Street. This brought the number of platforms back up to the pre-1973 number of five, allowing the number of trains running through the station to be increased from 12 to 16 per hour. These included a second northbound through platform, and a south facing platform reserved for the shuttle service to . The new platforms were brought into use on 14 December 2014.

In the spring of 2016, a roll of honour of those who served the armed forces between 1914 and 1919 from the Taff Vale Railway was put on display in the ticket hall. In November 2017, a QR code was added to give more information about those commemorated in the roll call.

== Services ==

Queen Street is the main hub of the Valley Lines network – a railway system serving Cardiff, the Vale of Glamorgan, Bridgend and the South Wales Valleys – and has the solitary connection to Cardiff Bay. The station is located at the eastern end of the city centre, near the Capitol and St David&#x27;s shopping centres, and sees heavy volumes of commuter rail traffic during the rush hour.

The station has five platforms at a level raised above the surrounding roads:

The typical Monday – Saturday service per hour (as of June 2024) is as follows:

Northbound (towards Coryton and the Valleys):

* 6 trains per hour (tph) to Pontypridd via Cathays and Radyr, of which

<doc id="925365" wikidata="Q5000125" url="?curid=925365" title="Burnside Bridge">
<text>The Burnside Bridge is a 1926-built bascule bridge that spans the Willamette River in Portland, Oregon, United States, carrying Burnside Street. It is the second bridge at the same site to carry that name. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in November 2012.

==Design==
The bridge was designed by Ira G. Hedrick and Robert E. Kremers, incorporating a bascule lift mechanism designed by Joseph Strauss.
Including approaches, the Burnside has a total length of and a center span. While lowered, this span is normally above the river. The deck is made of concrete, which contributes to its being one of the heaviest bascule bridges in the United States. The counterweights, housed inside the two piers, weigh . The lifting is normally controlled by the Hawthorne Bridge operator, but an operator staffs the west tower during high river levels. As of 2005, the bridge opened for river traffic an average of 35 times a month.

The bridge provides shelter for the initially unauthorized Burnside Skatepark under the east end. On weekends, the Portland Saturday Market was held mostly under the bridge&#x27;s west end for many years. The market was reoriented in 2009, but the Burnside Bridge continues to provide shelter for a few vendor stalls at the market&#x27;s northern end.

==History==
In 1891, Burnside Street was renamed from &quot;B&quot; street to take the name of Dan Wyman Burnside, a local businessman who was a proponent of the 1866 dredging of the Willamette River. Construction of the original Burnside Bridge began in November 1892, and the bridge opened on July 4, 1894. It was a swing-span truss bridge made of wrought iron and steel.

The replacement was part of a $4.5 million bond that also included the construction of the Ross Island and Sellwood bridges. The public would later learn that the 1924 contract was given for $500,000 more than the lowest bid. Having moved the bridge location to profit by selling their land, three Multnomah County commissioners were recalled as a result of the scandal, and a new engineering company assumed control of the project. The Ku Klux Klan had backed the commissioners and enabled their system of kickbacks and grafts; the ensuing &quot;rotten bridge scandal&quot; removed much of their clout even by 1924.
The bridge opened on May 28, 1926, at a final cost of $4.5 million (including approaches). It was the first Willamette River bridge in Portland designed with input from an architect. This led to the Italian Renaissance towers and decorative metal railings. The bascule system was designed by Joseph Strauss. The initial principal engineer for the bridge construction was the firm of Hedrick &amp; Kremers. The bridge was then completed by Gustav Lindenthal, who also supervised its construction.

Streetcars crossed the Burnside Bridge until 1950, and electric trolleybuses serving the Sandy Blvd. route did so from 1936 to 1958. Currently, three TriMet bus routes use the bridge.

In the 1990s the Burnside Bridge was made a Regional Emergency Transportation Route, the one non-freeway bridge to be used by emergency vehicles. In 1995 one of the six lanes was removed to accommodate new bicycle lanes. From March until November 2002 the bridge underwent a $2.1 million seismic retrofit, making it the first bridge operated by Multnomah County to receive earthquake protection.
The bridge was under construction in 2006 in order to replace the deck. The electric streetcar tracks, abandoned in 1950, were visible during the construction. This project was budgeted at $9 million and the majority of the work was completed on December 9, 2007. The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in November 2012.
The Eastbank Esplanade, which opened in 2001, is connected to the bridge by stairs added during the esplanade&#x27;s construction. However, because of the bridge&#x27;s age, it cannot support any extra weight, so the stairways must be supported by separate pilings.

In 2020, the Earthquake Ready Burnside Bridge project deemed that the current short-span bridge would not survive a major earthquake, and recommended a replacement long-span bridge. Early concepts for the new bridge included designs that resembled nearby Willamette River bridges; the six finalists, organized into cable-stayed and tied-arch designs, were presented for a public vote in July 2024. The replacement is estimated to cost $895 million and would begin construction in 2026; it is scheduled to open by 2031.

<doc id="925368" wikidata="Q1313033" url="?curid=925368" title="Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument">
<text>Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument is a U.S. National Monument created to protect Mogollon cliff dwellings in the Gila Wilderness on the headwaters of the Gila River in southwest New Mexico. The national monument was established by President Theodore Roosevelt through executive proclamation on November 16, 1907. It is located in the extreme southern portion of Catron County. Visitors can access the monument by traveling northbound from Silver City, New Mexico, on NM 15.

== Cliff dwellings in New Mexico ==
Considered by archaeologists to be upon the northernmost portion of the Mogollon people&#x27;s sphere of influence, the Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument is home to two prominent ruins sites among a collection of smaller sites located within the Gila Wilderness inside the Gila National Forest. The landscape in the monument ranges in elevation from around above sea level and follows the West Fork and the Middle Fork of the Gila River. The terrain around the ruins is rugged and arid, and contains steep-sided canyons cut by shallow spring rivers and mesas and bluffs forested with Ponderosa pine, Gambel&#x27;s oak, Douglas fir, New Mexico juniper, pinon pine, and alligator juniper (among others). The area geologic history stems from the Oligocene epoch and volcanic activity that subsequently covered the area with ash. The monument&#x27;s hot springs are remnants of this volcanic history.

The monument consists of and contains the remains of a Mimbres Culture community in various locations, two of which are most prominent. The namesake ruins&#x27; developers made use of natural caves to build interlinked dwellings within five cliff alcoves above Cliff Dweller Canyon. The TJ Ruins are located on a bluff overlooking the Gila River. The Mogollon peoples are believed to have inhabited the region from between 1275 and into the early 14th century, during the Pueblo III Era. It is not known why the community was abandoned.

Archaeologists have identified 46 rooms in the five caves on Cliff Dweller Canyon, and believe they were occupied by 10 to 15 families. The &quot;Heart-Bar Site&quot; or the TJ Ruins (named for the former ranch from which the mesa takes its name) located on TJ Mesa are largely un-excavated.

Other ruins include Javalina House, about 1/3 mile above the main ruin, West Fork Ruin, currently under Highway 15 across from Woody Corral, Three Mile Ruin along the west fork of the Gila River, and middle fork of the Gila River at the 11-room Cosgrove Ruin. Dendrochronology (tree ring dating) determined that the wood used in the dwellings were cut between 1276 and 1287. The region provided for growing, gathering and hunting food.

To visit the namesake dwellings, visitors are required to hike a well-traveled trail loop with several foot bridges over a stream. The entire walk takes about an hour. The hike begins at an elevation of and ends at .

==Modern history ==
Though local Native American Indians were aware of the location of ruins, the first European contact with the Gila Cliff Dwellings was by Henry B. Ailman (an emigrant to New Mexico who was residing in Silver City at the time). In the summer of 1878, Ailman and several friends were summoned to serve for jury duty, and in an effort to avoid the summons, they organized a prospecting trip to the Gila River, where they subsequently came upon the site.

Throughout the following years, many visitors would study the dwellings. Soon the site became more accessible, and in the 1890s the Hill brothers had established a resort at the nearby Gila Hot Springs. The Hill brothers would begin the first tours to the ruins for their guests. In June 1906, Rep. John F. Lacey of Iowa and chairman of the House Public Lands Committee introduced a bill for the regulation of prehistoric sites. The Act for the Preservation of Antiquities, commonly known as the Antiquities Act, authorized the US President to set aside land that contained prehistoric and historic ruins by executive order. 

These federal reservations were called national monuments and were to be managed by the Interior, Agriculture, and War departments, depending on which agency had controlled a particular site before it was withdrawn for preservation. In December 1906, Gila Forest Supervisor R. C. McClure reported to the chief forester in Washington, D.C. that the Gila Cliff Dwellings warranted preservation by the national government to avoid further removal of artifacts by hunters and other prospectors.

Several mummified bodies had been found at the Gila Cliff Dwellings location, though most were lost to looters and private collectors. In 1912, a burial ground was found; a mummified infant later referred to as &quot;Zeke&quot; was located. The discovery gained national attention and increased the monument&#x27;s popularity and visitor numbers. In turn, additional improvements were made in the following years. The mummy is the only known mummy to be acquired by the Smithsonian from the monument. The first park ranger was Doc Campbell, an early settler to the region. He helped National Park Service crews stabilize the ruins. The Campbells still guide wilderness trips from their Campbells Post in nearby Gila Hot Springs.

Administration of the monument was transferred from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to the National Park Service on August 10, 1933, by Executive Order 6166. President Kennedy would later sign proclamation no. 3467, that added approximately and contained the TJ site, as well as additional wilderness area. In the spring of 1975, the National Park Service and the U.S. Forest Service signed a cooperative agreement where the Gila National Forest is responsible for administration of the monument, but it returned to the NPS in 2003.

==Monument exhibits and services==

A museum and visitor center is located at the monument near the TJ Ruins. The visitor center is jointly operated by the U.S. Forest Service and the National Park Service. The museum hosts exhibits of Apache and Mogollon artifacts, uncovered both in the surrounding wilderness and at the monument. Displayed items include a bracelet crafted from Glycymeris Bittersweet clam shells found by a student park ranger, Charles Grymko. Believed to have been brought via trade from the Gulf of California to Snaketown (an ancient village on the right bank of the Gila River on the modern-day Gila River Indian Community south of the village of Ahwatukee), the shell eventually was etched and drilled by Hohokam artisans. The bracelet is believed then to have made its way up the Gila River from Arizona to the Gila River community, again by way of trade.

Other nearby attractions include hot springs, associated ruins sites, national forest hiking trails and fishing along the Gila River and in the Gila Wilderness.

<text>Claude Barruck Joseph Lelouch (; born 30 October 1937) is a French film director, writer, cinematographer, actor and producer. Lelouch grew up in an Algerian Jewish family. He emerged as a prominent director in the 1960s. Lelouch gained critical acclaim for his 1966 romantic melodrama film &quot;A Man and A Woman&quot;. At the 39th Academy Awards in 1967, &quot;A Man and a Woman&quot; won Best Original Screenplay and Best Foreign Language Film. Lelouch was also nominated for Best Director. While his films have gained him international recognition since the 1960s, Lelouch&#x27;s methods and style of film are known for attracting criticism.

==Life and career==
Lelouch was born in the 9th arrondissement of Paris to Charlotte (née Abeilard) and Simon Lelouch.

His father was born to an Algerian Jewish family while his mother was a convert to Judaism. Lelouch says that his first contact with cinema was very young: &quot;My mother hid me in movie theaters when I was little. We were wanted by the Gestapo. [...] Cinema, for starters, saved my life.&quot; Of his personal faith, he says &quot;Today I believe in God. My faith was sparked when I made a film in Israel. Over there, it is impossible not to believe in God. I loved the places of worship of all the religions. Everything which happens is for the best. I sometimes have the feeling that my inspiration comes from heaven. I think it is wonderful to be Jewish.&quot;

His father bought him a camera as a fresh start after his failure in the baccalaureat. He started his career with a reportage – one of the first to film daily life in the Soviet Union, with the camera hidden under his coat as he made his personal journey. He also filmed sporting events, like the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the Tour de France.

Lelouch served in the French Army working in the film unit where he made over 100 films. He was demobilized in 1960.

His first full-length film as director, &quot;Le Propre de l&#x27;homme&quot;, was decried by the critics: &quot;Claude Lelouch, remember this name well, because you will not hear it again&quot; – said. &quot;La femme spectacle&quot; (1963), following prostitutes, women shopping, going for nose-jobs, was censored for its misogynist tendency. &quot;A Man and a Woman&quot; changed his fortunes and was met with favour even by the Cahiers group.

The 1981 musical epic &quot;Les Uns et les Autres&quot; is widely considered as his masterpiece, and his credits now add up to 50 or so films. 

His 1976 film, &quot;C&#x27;était un rendez-vous&quot; purportedly features a Ferrari 275 GTB being driven at extreme speed through the streets of Paris at dawn. The entire short is shot from the point of view of the car. Legend has it that Lelouch was arrested after it was first shown publicly. In a 2006 interview, Lelouch stated that he drove his own Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9 in the film and created a soundtrack of the radically different sounding Italian sports car for effect.

He collaborated more than two dozen times with composer Francis Lai. They scored a great hit with the theme song for the film &quot;A Man and a Woman&quot; sung by Nicole Croisille and Pierre Barouh, and more than 300 versions of the song exist.

In 1993 he was the president of the jury at the 18th Moscow International Film Festival.

In 2020 Lelouch filmed his own modern &#x27;remake&#x27; of his 1976 short film (in collaboration with Ferrari) &quot;C&#x27;était un rendez-vous&quot; entitled &quot;Le Grand Rendez-vous&quot;, set in Monaco instead of Paris and starring Monegasque racing driver Charles Leclerc. Filming for the new version took place on the Circuit de Monaco on 24 May 2020 and features Leclerc driving a Ferrari SF90 Stradale. It was released on 13 June 2020. 
The film was criticised by The Verge as &#x27;lifeless&#x27;. 
Top Gear&#x27;s Chris Harris said on Twitter this version was &#x27;lazy and badly executed&#x27;.

== Honours ==
* 2016: Commander in the Order of the Crown
* 2005: Doctor of Philosophy Honoris Causa, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev

==Awards==
Lelouch&#x27;s &quot;A Man and a Woman&quot; won the at the 1966 Cannes Film Festival, as well as two Oscars including Best Foreign Language Film.

His 1967 film &quot;Vivre pour vivre&quot;, was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar. In 1971, he won the David di Donatello for Best Foreign Directing for &quot;Le Voyou&quot;.

<doc id="925370" wikidata="Q1964706" url="?curid=925370" title="Magog (Bible)">
<text>Magog (; , ; ) is the second of the seven sons of Japheth mentioned in the Table of Nations in Genesis .

The origin of the term is not clear, this name indicates either a person, or a tribe, or a geographical reality (country or city). In the book of Ezekiel, the pagan Magog people live &quot;north of the World&quot;, and metaphorically represent the forces of Evil, which associates it with traditions.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name &quot;Magog&quot; is unclear. It has been conjectured to come from the Akkadian &quot;mat Gugi&quot;, &quot;land of Gog&quot;, that is, the land of Gyges: Lydia.

==In the Bible==
Magog is often associated with apocalyptic traditions, mainly in connection with Ezekiel 38 and 39 which mentions &quot;Gog of the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal&quot; (Ezek 38:2 NIV); on the basis of this mention, &quot;Gog and Magog&quot; over time became associated with each other as a pair. In the New Testament, this pairing is found in the Book of Revelation 20:8, in which instance they may merely be metaphors for archetypal enemies of God.

==Ancient and medieval views==

Josephus refers to Magog son of Japheth as progenitor of Scythians, or peoples north of the Black Sea. According to him, the Greeks called Scythia &quot;Magogia&quot;. An alternate identification derived from an examination of the order in which tribal names are listed in Ezekiel 38, &quot;would place Magog between Cappadocia and Media.&quot; According to Rabbi Shlomo Ganzfried (19th century) Magog refers to the Mongols. He cites an Arab writer who refers to the Great Wall of China with the name &#x27;Magog&#x27;.

Jordanes&#x27; &quot;Getica&quot; (551) mentions Magog as ancestor of the Goths, as does the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, but Isidore of Seville (c. 635) asserts that this identification was popular &quot;because of the similarity of the last syllable&quot; (&quot;Etymologiae&quot;, IX, 89). Johannes Magnus (1488–1544) stated that Magog migrated to Scandinavia (via Finland) 88 years after the flood, and that his five sons were Suenno (ancestor of the Swedes), Gethar (or Gog, ancestor of the Goths), Ubbo (who later ruled the Swedes and built Old Uppsala), Thor, and German. Magnus&#x27;s accounts was accepted at the Swedish court for a long time, and even caused the dynastic numerals of the Swedish monarchs to be renumbered accordingly. Queen Christina of Sweden reckoned herself as number 249 in a list of kings going back to Magog. Magnus also influenced several later historians such as Daniel Juslenius (1676–1752), who derived the roots of the Finns from Magog.

According to several medieval Irish chronicles, most notably the &quot;Auraicept na n-Éces&quot; and &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;, the Irish race are a composite including descendants of Japheth&#x27;s son Magog from &quot;Scythia&quot;. Baath mac Magog (Boath), Jobhath, and Fathochta are the three sons of Magog. Fenius Farsaid, Partholón, Nemed, the Fir Bolg, the Tuatha de Danann, and the Milesians are among Magog&#x27;s descendants. Magog was also supposed to have had a grandson called Heber, whose offspring spread throughout the Mediterranean.

There is also a medieval Hungarian legend that says the Huns, as well as the Magyars, are descended from twin brothers named Hunor and Magor respectively, who lived by the sea of Azov in the years after the flood, and took wives from the Alans. The version of this legend in the 14th century &quot;Chronicon Pictum&quot; identifies this &quot;Magor&quot; as the descendant of Magog, son of Japheth.

==In Islam==
Magog&#x27;s appearance in the Quran and other Islamic sources is chiefly due to his apocalyptic renown as part of the pairing of Gog and Magog (Arabic: &quot;Ya&#x27;juj wa Ma&#x27;juj&quot;). In sura Al-Kahf (&quot;The Cave&quot;, 18:83–98) of the Quran (early 7th century AD), an individual called Dhul-Qarnayn (&quot;The Two-horned One&quot;) journeys to a distant land in a pass between two mountains where he finds people who are suffering from the mischief of Gog and Magog. Dhul-Qarnayn then makes a wall of copper and iron to keep Gog and Magog out, but warns that it will be removed in the Last Age. In sura 21, Al-Anbiyā (The Prophets), the wall is mentioned again: there Allah tells His Prophet (Muhammad) that there is a &quot;prohibition upon [the people of] a city which We have destroyed that they will [ever] return, until [the dam of] Gog and Magog has been opened and thou shall see them, from every higher ground, descending.&quot; In the Khutoot, Magog appears as Chloe&#x27;s son. Chloe was married with Ezock. In Islam Chloe is known as Kluwi and Ezock is known as Izdik.

== In popular culture ==
*In the season 13 episode &quot;Good Intentions&quot; of the TV series &quot;Supernatural&quot;, Magog appears as a warrior, alongside another named Gog. They battle protagonists Castiel and Dean Winchester. After Dean kills them, Magog and Gog are revealed to be primitive beasts formed of rock and sand, a type of creature Castiel had believed to have gone extinct during the Great Flood
*In the 23-minute epic Genesis song &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot; from 1972, the &quot;Guards of Magog&quot; are mentioned in the 6th section entitled &quot;Apocalypse in 9/8 (Co-Starring the Delicious Talents of Gabble Ratchet)&quot;. During live performances of the song lead singer Peter Gabriel would wear an outfit to represent Magog
*In the TV series &quot;Andromeda&quot;, the Magog are depicted as a hostile race of aliens who attack earth and decimate its population. They are shown to reproduce by laying eggs in human hosts only to devour the host upon birth
* In the &quot;Oddworld&quot; video game series, the villainous conglomerate opposing the protagonist in every game is named the Magog Cartel

<text>Tapestry, Inc. is an American multinational fashion holding company. It is based in New York City and is the parent company of three major brands: Coach New York, Kate Spade New York and Stuart Weitzman. Originally named Coach, Inc., the business changed its name to Tapestry on October 31, 2017.

== History ==

=== Coach New York ===
Coach was founded in 1941. Starting as a workshop, it grew into a company with over 17,000 employees. Seeking wider recognition and a larger market, the company acquired brands such as Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman. This broadened the appeal to consumers of all three brands. The company changed names, reducing the share price because investors felt that the name change was not well received by customers. The share price later recovered.

=== Kate Spade New York ===
American fashion designer Kate Spade founded Kate Spade New York in 1993. It was initially similar to the Coach company. The company was purchased by Coach in 2017 in a $2.4 billion deal.

=== Stuart Weitzman ===
Stuart Weitzman (born 1941) began working in the early 1960s for Seymour Shoes, a company set up by his father Seymour Weitzman and his older brother Warren in Haverhill, Massachusetts in the late 1950s.

After the company was taken over by a Spanish company in 1971, it was bought by Stuart Weitzman in 1994. Over the years, and following a series of takeovers, the company has grown considerably to become one of the Tapestry group&#x27;s luxury brands.

The brand was purchased by Coach in 2015 for $574 million. It was made to broaden Coach&#x27;s product line.

=== Tapestry, Inc. ===
The business originally named Coach changed its name to Tapestry to better represent its broader product range when it expanded beyond Coach-brand handbags. The company officially changed its name and ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange from COH to TPR on October 31, 2017. Most of these products are accessories, such as handbags, key-chains, shoes and other small fashion items. Most of these items are leather goods and are produced by the individual subsidiaries.

In late July, 2020, the company named Joanne Crevoiserat, Tapestry&#x27;s CFO since early 2019, the new CEO. She became the 36th female to lead a &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 company.

==== Attempted acquisition of Capri Holdings ====
Tapestry announced it would acquire Capri Holdings in August 2023 for $8.5 billion. Capri owns the brands Versace, Michael Kors, and Jimmy Choo. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued to block the acquisition in April 2024 citing reduced competition between their brands, like Coach and Michael Kors, in the affordable luxury handbag market. It was also concerned that the deal would negatively impact hiring of workers and their wages. The merger was blocked on 24 October 2024. Tapestry and Capri committed to appealing the decision, but called off the merger the following month citing the regulatory hurdles.

== Leadership ==

Victor Luis began working with the company as the CEO of the Japanese subsidiary. He then worked in China. He rose to serve as Tapestry&#x27;s International CEO, and then CEO of Tapestry, Inc. In September 2019, Tapestry Inc. replaced Luis as CEO, announcing he would leave immediately and be succeeded by board Chairman Jide Zeitlin, a former Goldman Sachs executive who has been on the board since 2006. Jide J. Zeitlin was appointed chief executive officer (CEO) of Tapestry in September 2019. In this role, Jide was responsible for the execution of the company&#x27;s strategic agenda and financial performance. Mr. Zeitlin was elected to Tapestry&#x27;s board of directors in June 2006 and served as the chairman of the board from November 2014 until his resignation in July 2020 after accusations of personal misconduct. Tapestry announced in April 2021 that VF Corp. executive Scott Roe would be succeeding Andrea Shaw Resnick as CFO.

==Controversy==
In July 2020, Tapestry CEO Jide Zeitlin resigned from his positions as CEO and chairman amidst an investigation into his personal behavior. Previously, a woman had accused him of luring her into a romantic relationship in 2007 by pretending to be a photographer.

<text>Sandy Frank (born Sundel Francous; July 11, 1929) is an American television producer, distributor, and marketer of TV shows to US networks.

==Early life and career==
Frank grew up in Mount Kisco, New York. He started his career as a sales executive for Paramount Pictures, subsequently moving on to Guild Films, and NBC television. Later, he was Senior Vice President of Worldwide Sales with the television division of the Wrather Corporation, which produced and distributed the &quot;Lassie&quot; and &quot;Lone Ranger&quot; TV programs. In 1964, he opened Sandy Frank Program Sales Inc. as his first company. His first distribution successes were &quot;You Asked For It&quot; and &quot;Lassie&quot;, for which he had acquired the rights from the Wrather Corp.

==Sandy Frank Entertainment==
Among the programs Frank&#x27;s company produced or distributed were &quot;Name That Tune&quot; (1984–1985), &quot;Face the Music&quot; (1980–1981), &quot;The New Treasure Hunt&quot; (1973–1977), &quot;The Bobby Vinton Show&quot; (1975–1978), &quot;The Bill Cosby Show&quot; (1969–1971), &quot;The Dating Game&quot; (1973–1974), and &quot;Lee Mendelson&#x27;s Superstar Specials&quot;. Frank later produced and distributed &quot;Name That Tune&quot; and &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot;. Frank was also the leading distributor of travel adventure shows including &quot;America&quot;, &quot;High and Wild&quot;, &quot;Across the Seven Seas&quot;, &quot;The Traveler&quot;, and &quot;American West&quot;.

The company obtained rights and provided English dubbing for the entire line of Daiei Film monster movies. Due to the constraints of airing in the then-new UHF television &quot;movie of the week&quot; format, however, the English versions are substantially shortened from the Japanese originals. Many of these films have now lapsed to the public domain. These versions are best known for their frequent appearances on &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, where some of the company&#x27;s dubs of Japanese films were lampooned, including a song titled &quot;The Sandy Frank Song&quot;.

In 1972, the cover of &quot;Broadcasting&quot; read: &quot;Sandy Frank Film Syndication, Inc. sets a new syndication sales record with &quot;The Parent Game&quot;: 125 markets sold in just 100 days of selling.&quot;

===&quot;Battle of the Planets&quot;===
In April 1977, Frank attended the MIP-TV conference in Cannes. It was here Frank first encountered the Japanese animation &quot;Science Ninja Team Gatchaman&quot; from producer Tatsunoko Production run by the Yoshida brothers. Frank committed to release the series in the United States after he saw the success of &quot;Star Wars&quot; in May 1977. &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot; is the title of the American adaptation of this series, created by Frank. He authorized new footage and hired writers to add dialog to fit the look of the animation without reference to original scripts. Of the 105 original &quot;Science Ninja Team Gatchaman&quot; episodes, 85 were used in the &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot; adaptation produced by Sandy Frank Entertainment in 1978.

===Later career===
In 2000, NATPE, the professional organization of television program executives, featured Frank in the video &quot;The Legends of Syndication&quot;, an overview of the history of syndicated media selling. Frank formed alliances in 2011 with a number of companies such as The Asylum in the United States and Sony in other countries. SFE has marketed &quot;Dangerous Minds&quot; (hosted by Rudy Giuliani) for Primetime Network, &quot;You Asked for It&quot; for Prime Time Network, and &quot;Face the Music&quot; which is being re-launched in a new prime time version.

==Film tax credit suit==
In 2011, Frank filed suit against the denial of a tax credit to his production under Michigan&#x27;s system of offering of up to 42% tax credits for the production of films in Michigan. The films supported are subject to restrictions such as that Michigan residents must be portrayed in a positive way, and game shows are not supported. Frank described his show as a reality show about the making of a game show and said that he made commitments of $350,000 after being told by state officials that his show would qualify for the credit, which was denied in 2009. The lawsuit claimed the restrictions were enforced arbitrarily, as other shows about competitions, including &quot;Crash Course&quot; and &quot;The Wedding Day&quot;, had received state support, as had potentially negative depictions in &quot;Hung&quot;, &quot;A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas&quot;, and &quot;Up In The Air&quot;. According to &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Sandy Frank Productions claimed &quot;violations of Michigan&#x27;s film tax credit law, Michigan&#x27;s administrative procedures act, unjust enrichment, breach of contract, fraud, misrepresentation, and violation of equal protection and due process under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.&quot; A federal district court judge dismissed the complaint on January 4, 2012.

<doc id="925384" wikidata="Q234597" url="?curid=925384" title="Sitatunga">
<text>The sitatunga (Tragelaphusspekii) or marshbuck is a swamp-dwelling medium-sized antelope found throughout central Africa, centering on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Republic of the Congo, Cameroon, parts of Southern Sudan, Equatorial Guinea, Burundi, Ghana, Botswana, Rwanda, Zambia, Gabon, the Central African Republic, Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya.
The sitatunga is mostly confined to swampy and marshy habitats. Here they occur in tall and dense vegetation as well as seasonal swamps, marshy clearings in forests, riparian thickets and mangrove swamps.

==Taxonomy and genetics==

The scientific name of the sitatunga is &quot;Tragelaphus spekii&quot;. The species was first described by the English explorer John Hanning Speke in 1863. Speke first observed the sitatunga at a lake named &quot;Little Windermere&quot; (now Lake Lwelo, located in Kagera, Tanzania). In his book &quot;Journal of the Discovery of the Source of the Nile&quot;, Speke called the animal &quot;nzoé&quot; (Kiswahili name for the animal) or &quot;water-boc&quot; (due to its resemblance to the waterbuck). The word &quot;sitatunga&quot; itself comes from an ancient Bantu language. The scientific name has often been misstated as &quot;T. spekei&quot;, and either Speke or Sclater is referred to as the binomial authority. 

Speke had stated in a footnote in his book that the species had been named &quot;Tragelaphus spekii&quot; by English zoologist Philip Sclater. However, according to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (Article 50.1.1) and the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, that acknowledge the person who first described the species, simply declaring Sclater as the authority in a footnote is insufficient to recognise him as the author. Hence, Speke was recognised as the correct authority and &quot;T. spekii&quot; (where &quot;spekii&quot; is the genitive of the Latinised &quot;Spekius&quot;) was considered the correct name for the species.

The sitatunga is placed under the genus &quot;Tragelaphus&quot; and in the family Bovidae. In 2005, Sandi Willows-Munro of the University of KwaZulu-Natal (Durban) carried out a mitochondrial analysis of the nine &quot;Tragelaphus&quot; species. mtDNA and nDNA data were compared. The results showed that sitatunga plus bongo (&quot;T. eurycerus&quot;) form a monophyletic clade with the mountain nyala (&quot;T. buxtoni&quot;) and bushbuck (&quot;T. scriptus&quot;). The greater kudu (&quot;T. strepsiceros&quot;) split from this clade approximately 8.6 million years ago.

Within &quot;Tragelaphus&quot;, the bushbuck, bongo, sitatunga and nyala (&quot;T. angasii&quot;) are particularly close relatives. The bushbuck and sitatunga are genetically similar enough to hybridise. Hybrids between bongo and sitatunga have proved to be fertile. The sitatunga is more variable in its general characters than any other member of the tribe Strepsicerotini, that consists of the genera &quot;Taurotragus&quot; (elands) and &quot;Tragelaphus&quot;, probably because of their confinement to swampy and marshy habitats.

On the basis of physical characteristics such as hair texture, coat colour and the coat stripes, up to ten subspecies of the sitatunga have been described. However, these factors may not be reliable since hair texture could vary with the climate, while pelage colour and markings vary greatly among individuals. Moreover, the coat might darken and the stripes and spots on it might fade with age, especially in males. The species might even be monotypic, however, based on different drainage systems, three distinct subspecies are currently recognised:
* T. s. spekii : Nile sitatunga or East African sitatunga. Found in the Nile watershed.
* T. s. gratus : Congo sitatunga or forest sitatunga. Found in western and central Africa.
* T. s. selousi : Southern sitatunga or Zambezi sitatunga. Found in southern Africa.

==Description==

The sitatunga is a medium-sized antelope. It is sexually dimorphic, with males considerably larger than females. The head-and-body length is typically between in males and in females. Males reach approximately at the shoulder, while females reach . Males typically weigh , while females weigh . The tail is long. The saucer-shaped ears are long. Only the males possess horns; these are spiral in shape, have one or two twists and are long. The sitatunga is almost indistinguishable from the nyala, except in pelage and spoor. Speke pointed out that, though &quot;closely allied&quot; to the waterbuck, the sitatunga lacks stripes and is spotted instead.

The coat colour varies geographically, but, in general, is a rufous red in juveniles and chestnut in females. There are white facial markings, as well as several stripes and spots all over, though they are only faintly visible. White patches can be seen on the throat, near the head and the chest. A pair of inguinal scent glands are present. The coats of males darken with age, becoming gray to dark brown. Males develop a rough and scraggy mane, usually brown in colour, and a white dorsal stripe. There is a chevron between the eyes of the males.

The body and legs of this antelope are specially adapted to its swampy habitat. The hooves of the male are elongated and widely splayed. The rubbery, shaggy, water-repellent coat is minimally affected by slimy and muddy vegetation. The wedge-like shape and lowering of the head, coupled with the backward bend of the horns (in males) provides for easy navigation through dense vegetation. The pasterns are flexible, and the hooves, banana-like in shape, can reach a length of up to in the hindlegs and in the forelegs. The pointed toes allow it to walk slowly and almost noiselessly through the water. Moreover, the colour of the coat provides an excellent camouflage. Hearing is acute, and the ears are so structured that the animal can accurately determine the direction from where a sound has originated. This adaptation is of profound use in habitats where long sight is of very little value due to the density and darkness of the environment.

==Ecology and behaviour==

Sitatunga are active mainly during the early hours after dawn, the last one or two hours before dusk, and at night, and spend a large part of this time feeding. Basically sedentary, they rest in flat areas and reed beds, especially during the hotter part of the day. They seldom leave their swamp habitat during the daytime. Though sitatunga commonly form pairs or remain solitary, larger groups have also been observed. A study in Kenya recorded a herd of as many as nine individuals, comprising an adult male, four females and four juveniles. Loose groups may be formed but interaction among individuals is very low. Individuals generally associate only with their own sex.

The sitatunga is not territorial. Males may engage in locking horns with other males and attacking vegetation using their horns. They may perform feinting by raising their forelegs with the hindlegs rooted in the ground as a threat display. Sitatunga interact with each other by first touching their noses, which may be followed by licking each other and nibbling. Alarmed animals may stand motionless, with the head held high and one leg raised. Sitatunga may occasionally emit a series of coughs or barks, usually at night, which may cause other animals to join in, and these sounds can be heard across the swamp. This barking may be used by females to warn off other females. Males often utter a low bellow on coming across a female or a herd of females in the mating season. A low-pitched squeak may be uttered while feeding. Mothers communicate with their calves by bleats.

Sitatunga can feed or rest close to southern lechwe herds, but do not interact with them. They often attract yellow-billed oxpeckers, African jacanas and great egrets. Sitatunga are good swimmers, but limit themselves to water with profuse vegetation in order to escape crocodiles. In some cases, for instance when troubled by flies or pursued by predators, the sitatunga might fully submerge themselves in the water except for the nose and the eyes, which they keep slightly above the water surface. Due to its close association with water, the sitatunga are often described as &quot;aquatic antelopes&quot;, like the waterbuck. They often dry themselves under the sun after feeding in water. Predators of the sitatunga include lions, wild dogs, crocodiles and leopards.

===Diet===

Sitatunga are selective and mixed feeders. They feed mainly on new foliage, fresh grasses, sedges and browse. Preferred plants include: bullrushes (&quot;Typha&quot;), sedges (&quot;Cyperus&quot;), aquatic grasses (&quot;Vossia&quot;, &quot;Echinochloa&quot;, &quot;Pennisetum&quot;, &quot;Leersia&quot;, &quot;Acroceras&quot; and &quot;Panicum&quot;. Species in Umbelliferae and Acanthaceae are preferred in Saiwa Swamp National Park (Kenya), and Fabaceae species are preferred in Bangweulu and Busanga (in Kafue National Park). They feed mostly in the wetland fringes. Diet preferences may vary seasonally in swamps where water levels change notably. Like the gerenuk, the sitatunga may stand on its hindlegs to reach higher branches of trees, or even use its horns to pull down the branches.

A study recorded forty major species eaten by the animal, the majority of which were herbs. Sweet potato was the most preferred crop. The study predicted an increase in preference for crops due to seasonal food variations. Another study showed that annual floods affect the seasonal movement and diet of the species. These floods force the animals out of the reed beds onto the flooded grasslands when the water levels are high. At low water levels the cattle take over the flooded plains and send the sitatunga back to their original place.

===Reproduction===

Females are sexually mature by one year of age, while males take one-and-a-half-year before they mature. Breeding occurs throughout the year. When females gather, the males compete among each other for the right to mate, showing polygyny in males. The rutting male approaches the female in a lower bending posture, sniffing her vulva. The female may move slowly or react nervously. Even if the female flees, the male continues pursuing her steadily, without showing any sign of hurry. A receptive female will raise her head with her mouth wide open, following which the male will begin attempts at mounting. At the time of mounting the female lowers her head, while the male first bends and then straightens his forelegs and rests his head and neck on her back. The two remain together for one or two days, during which time the male ensures that no other male can approach the female.

Gestation lasts for nearly eight months, after which generally a single calf is born. Parturition occurs throughout the year, though a peak may occur in the dry season. Calves are hidden adroitly, and brought out of cover only in the presence of many other sitatunga. The mother gazes and nods at the calf to summon it for nursing. A calf follows its mother about even after she has given birth to another calf. The mother suckles and licks her calf for about six months. The calf takes time to master the specialised gait of the sitatunga, and thus often loses its balance and falls in water. Males, and even some females, have been observed to leave their herds even before reaching sexual maturity due to intrasexual competition. Lifespan recorded in captivity averages 22 to 23 years.

==Habitat and distribution==
The sitatunga is an amphibious antelope (meaning it can live on both land and water) confined to swampy and marshy habitats. They occur in tall and dense vegetation of perennial as well as seasonal swamps, marshy clearings in forests, riparian thickets and mangrove swamps. Sitatunga move along clearly marked tracks in their swampy habitat, often leading to reed beds. These tracks, up to wide, can lead to feeding grounds and nearby riverine forests. The sitatunga hold small home ranges near water bodies In savannas, they are typically found in stands of papyrus and reeds (&quot;Phragmites&quot; species and &quot;Echinochloa pyramidalis&quot;). They share their habitat with the Nile lechwe in the Sudd swamps and with the southern lechwe in Angola, Botswana and Zambia.

The sitatunga is native to Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. It is extinct in Niger, where it formerly occurred in the Lake Chad region, and is feared to be extinct in Togo, where its habitat has been taken over by dense human settlements. While it is localised and sporadic in western Africa, the sitatunga is still common in the forests of central Africa and certain swampy regions in central, eastern and southern Africa.

==Threats and conservation==
Habitat loss is the most severe threat to the survival of the sitatunga. Other threats include the increasing loss of wetlands, that has isolated populations; and long-term changes in the water level, that affects the nearby vegetation and thus bears upon their diet. Vast areas of Bangweulu and Busanga are burnt every year, placing animals like the sitatunga at grave risk given the inflammability of swamps. The sitatunga has been classified under the Least Concern category by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), and under Appendix III (Ghana) of the Washington Convention (CITES).

In Senegal, intensive hunting for meat and habitat degradation have made the sitatunga very rare. Formerly it was common throughout Gambia, but now it is confined to a few inaccessible swamps; a population has been introduced in the Abuko Nature Reserve. On the other hand, though the animal is hunted by locals primarily for food, Botswana still supports a large portion of the total population. The species is of great economic significance for northern Botswana, that produces some of the world&#x27;s biggest sitatunga trophies. Its status is unclear in Chad, Ghana, Guinea, Burundi and Mozambique and Zimbabwe. Significant populations still exist in countries such as Cameroon, Central African Republic, The Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Tanzania and Zambia. The inaccessibility of its habitat has rendered population estimates very difficult. In 1999, Rod East of the IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group estimated a total population of 170,000, but this is likely to be an overestimate. Its numbers are decreasing in areas of heavy human settlement, but are stable elsewhere.

Around 40 percent of the populations (based on the overestimate of 170,000) occurs in protected areas, mainly in Okavango Delta and Linyanti and Chobe swamps (Botswana); Dja Faunal Reserve and Lobéké National Park (Cameroon); Bangassou (Central African Republic); Odzala National Park, Lake Télé Community Reserve, Likouala and Salonga National Park (The Democratic Republic of Congo); Monte Alén National Park (Equatorial Guinea); Saiwa Swamp National Park (Kenya); Akagera National Park (Rwanda); Moyowosi and Kigosi Game Reserves (Tanzania); Bangweulu and Busanga Swamps (Zambia). However, only a few are of these parks and reserves are well-protected and managed.

<text>Campo da Constituição () was a football stadium in Porto, Portugal, which served as the home ground of FC Porto between 1913 and 1952. Located in the &quot;Rua da Constituição&quot; (Constitution Street), it was Porto&#x27;s second ground, after the club moved out of the Campo da Rainha.

== History ==
In 1912, Porto&#x27;s first ground, the Campo da Rainha, no longer supported the club&#x27;s growing demands and attendances, so the board searched for a site to build a larger stadium. The estate was leased by a yearly fee of 350 &quot;escudos&quot;. The ground was officially opened on 26 January 1913 with a tournament between Porto, Benfica, Oporto Cricket and Lawn Tennis Club and Real Fortuna, which saw Benfica emerge as winners.

The growth implied a new ground, the first guidelines appeared in 1933. While the new stadium was being studied (took until 1948 before the estate was chosen and bought), the Campo da Constituição was used and upgraded in 1938 with wooden boxes and a new stand. It was abandoned by the main football team in 1952 when the Estádio das Antas was finished one mile to the east.

The ground underwent extensive renovation works and reopened in 2008, under the name Vitalis Park, as a training complex dedicated in particular to youth trials. The front also hosts a club store.

<text>The was an influential Pan-Asianist group and secret society active in the Empire of Japan.

==Foundation as the Koyōsha==
Founded as the &quot;Koyōsha&quot; by Hiraoka Kotarō (1851–1906), a wealthy ex-samurai and mine-owner, with mining interests in Manchuria, Tōyama Mitsuru, and other former samurai of the Fukuoka Domain, it agitated for a return to the old feudal Japanese order with special privileges and government stipends for the samurai class.:215 The &quot;Koyōsha&quot; participated in the various ex-samurai uprisings in Kyūshū against the early Meiji government, but after the suppression of the Satsuma Rebellion in 1877, it abandoned its original goals, joined the pro-democracy Freedom and People&#x27;s Rights Movement, and formed a political organization to agitate for a national parliament instead.

==Foundation as the Gen&#x27;yōsha==

In 1881, the &quot;Koyōsha&quot; changed its direction again. The February 1881 founding charter of the &quot;Gen&#x27;yōsha&quot; described its ideals as (1) respect the imperial house (2) love your home region and (3) firmly defend and protect the people&#x27;s rights. However, its true agenda was to agitate for Japanese military expansion and conquest of the Asian continent. The true agenda was reflected in its new name of &quot;Gen&#x27;yōsha&quot;, taken after the Genkainada strait which separates Japan from Korea.

The tactics which the &quot;Gen&#x27;yōsha&quot; was prepared to use to achieve its goals were also far from peaceful. It began as a terrorist organization, and although it continued to recruit disaffected ex-&quot;samurai&quot;, it also attracted figures involved in organized crime to assist in its campaigns of violence and assassination against foreigners and liberal politicians.:217

The &quot;Gen&#x27;yōsha&quot; was a major force in the Freedom and People&#x27;s Rights Movement. During the 1885 Osaka incident, the &quot;Gen&#x27;yōsha&quot; and several other Freedom and People&#x27;s Rights Movement groups simultaneously attempted to overthrow the Meiji oligarchs in uprisings inside Japan, China, and Korea.

In 1889, the &quot;Gen&#x27;yōsha&quot; strongly criticized the unequal treaty revision plan drafted by foreign minister Ōkuma Shigenobu. Gen&#x27;yōsha militant Kurushima Tsuneki attempted to kill Ōkuma by throwing a bomb under his carriage. After the bomb detonated, and apparently believing he had succeeded, Kurushima bowed and killed himself by stabbing himself twice in the neck. Ōkuma survived, and his left leg was amputated at the hip following two operations.

In the election of 1892, the &quot;Gen&#x27;yōsha&quot; mounted a campaign of intimidation and violence with the tacit support of the Matsukata administration to influence the outcome of the election.

One of the primary targets of the &quot;Gen&#x27;yōsha&quot; were the many Chinese secret societies, some of which were very hostile to Japan. However, the Chinese secret societies had a shared goal with the &quot;Gen&#x27;yōsha&quot; in wanting the overthrow of the Qing dynasty. In 1881, Mitsuru Tōyama sent over 100 men into China to gather information and to infiltrate these secret societies. One of the first and most detailed histories of the secret societies was written by &quot;Gen&#x27;yōsha&quot; member Hiraya Amane, who assisted in the establishment of the &quot;Gen&#x27;yōsha&#x27;s&quot; Chinese headquarters in Hangzhou.

The &quot;Gen&#x27;yōsha&quot; not only provided funds and weapons to the secret societies, but also arranged for refuge in Japan for leaders targeted by the Qing government. The &quot;Gen&#x27;yosha&quot; established a large network of brothels across China (and later throughout Southeast Asia) to provide meeting locations, and also to gather information. In addition to being a profitable side-business, the brothels provided opportunities to gather useful information for the later blackmail or subversion of patrons. However, although blackmail and bribery were often resorted to, more often information was obtained by employing prostitutes highly skilled in extracting information from their clients. The &quot;Gen&#x27;yōsha&quot; even established a training school for such agents in Sapporo in Hokkaidō.

Another sphere of &quot;Gen&#x27;yōsha&quot; activity was Korea. The &quot;Gen&#x27;yōsha&quot; established a task force to prepare detailed topographical survey maps of Korea in secret, in anticipation of a future Japanese invasion. The &quot;Gen&#x27;yōsha&quot; also actively supported the Donghak Peasant Movement, knowing that the uprising was likely to draw China and Japan into a war. The assassination of Queen Min of Korea in 1895 is believed to have been conducted by &quot;Gen&#x27;yosha&quot; members, at the instigation of the Japanese Minister in Seoul, Miura Gorō.

Originally ignored by the Japanese military, during the First Sino-Japanese War and Russo-Japanese War, both the Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy found the &quot;Gen&#x27;yōsha&quot;″s extensive intelligence gathering network throughout East Asia to be invaluable. The &quot;Gen&#x27;yōsha&quot; network was also useful for the military in conducting sabotage activities behind enemy lines.

After the annexation of Korea in 1910, the &quot;Gen&#x27;yōsha&quot; continued to support efforts towards Pan-Asianism. Domestically, it formed a political party called the &quot;Dai Nippon Seisantō&quot; (&quot;Greater Japan Production Party&quot;) to combat the influence of communism and socialism in worker trade unions.

Towards its later years, the &quot;Gen&#x27;yōsha&quot; was far removed from its origins as a secret society, but had evolved almost to the mainstream of Japanese politics. A number of cabinet ministers and members of the Japanese Diet were known members, and mainstream political leaders, such as Hirota Kōki and Nakano Seigō emerged from its ranks. It continued to exert considerable influence on the politics and foreign policy of Japan until the end of World War II.

The &quot;Gen&#x27;yōsha&quot; was disbanded by the American authorities during the Occupation of Japan.

== Nationalism ==
The primary English-language text on the &quot;Gen&#x27;yōsha&quot; presents the group as ultranationalistic. Academic Mark W. Driscoll writes that even that text recognizes that the &quot;Gen&#x27;yōsha&quot; did not want Emperor Meiji&#x27;s power to expand and in 1881 the organization&#x27;s position was simply that the imperial household should be respected. Writing in 1935, Yumeno Kyūsaku stated that the early &quot;Gen&#x27;yōsha&quot; was not nationalistic.

The &quot;Gen&#x27;yōsha&quot; was considered to be an ultranationalist group by General Headquarters in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East.

==Legacy==
The &quot;Gen&#x27;yōsha&quot; was the forerunner of a number of organizations which inherited and developed its ideology. It also set the stage for the post-World War II ties between right-wing politicians and &quot;yakuza&quot; organized crime syndicates.

Although modern &quot;yakuza&quot; share many of &quot;Gen&#x27;yōsha&#x27;s&quot; political and social philosophies, and although many of &quot;Gen&#x27;yōsha&#x27;s&quot; members were drawn from &quot;yakuza&quot; ranks, the &quot;Gen&#x27;yōsha&quot; was primarily a political organization that often used criminal means to attain its goals, and was not a &quot;yakuza&quot; group itself, as some authors have claimed.

== In popular fiction ==
Part of its role in Korean history (and its methods for gathering information) is fictionalised in the 2018 South Korean TV series, &quot;Mr Sunshine&quot;.

<doc id="925410" wikidata="Q432457" url="?curid=925410" title="Christine Nordhagen">
<text>Christine Nordhagen (born June 26, 1971) is a former Canadian wrestler.

==Wrestling==
Nordhagen, who began wrestling at age 20, is a graduate of the University of Alberta. She has won six world championship gold medals: 1994, 1996, 2000 and 2001 in Sofia, Bulgaria (70 kg freestyle for 1994 and 1996, 75 kg for 2000 and 68 kg for 2001), 1997 in Clermont-Ferrand, France, and 1998 in Poznań, Poland (both 68 kg). She won a silver medal in 1993 in Stavern, Norway and a bronze medal in 1999 in Boden, Sweden (both 70 kg). At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens she placed 5th in the 72 kg women&#x27;s freestyle. She retired from competition a year after the Athens Games.

Nordhagen first started winning titles at Canada’s first national championship in 1992. When she began competing at world championships in 1993, there were fewer than 150 Canadian women registered in wrestling. By the time she retired, there were more than 4,000 women, not counting non-registered girls at the high-school level, registered in wrestling, according to Greg Mathieu, executive director of the Canadian Amateur Wrestling Association.

Nordhagen helped get the women’s side of the sport into the Olympics for the first time at Athens in 2004, where she finished fifth.

==Upringing and motivation==
Nordhagen says she never ran well using hate as emotional fuel, as some athletes do. Her &quot;modus operandi&quot; involved a smile of confidence and the work ethic of a girl raised on a farm where the labours did not have genders.
&quot;In a farm family, there’s a different perspective,&quot; she said. &quot;I had a mother who did everything my father did, because on a grain and cattle farm, things have to get done. . . . There were some gender stereotypes -- she cooked more than my father did -- but she also fixed machines, carried loads. It wasn&#x27;t an option for me to say I can&#x27;t do things because I&#x27;m female.&quot;
==Coaching==
Nordhagen and former world champion track cyclist Tanya Dubnicoff were among several retiring female athletes who were drafted into a special training program by the Coaching Association of Canada to help retain and pass on expertise to a new generation. In 2006, besides maintaining a busy schedule as a motivational speaker and role model for students (under the sponsorship of Alberta oil and gas companies), Nordhagen began coaching Canadian junior women.

==Hall of Fame==
On June 26, 2006, Nordhagen’s husband and longtime coach, Leigh Vierling, received a phone call to inform Christine that she had been voted into the class of 2006 inductees to the international wrestling hall of fame. She became the first Canadian and first woman to be named to the hall by the &quot;Federation Internationale de Luttes Associees&quot; (FILA), wrestling&#x27;s international and Olympic governing body. The ceremony was scheduled to take place during the world wrestling championships September 23 to October 2 at Guangzhou, China. The permanent display of honorees is housed at the Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Nordhagen was inducted into the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame &amp; Museum in May 2010 for her achievements in Wrestling.

Nordhagen is one of nine wrestlers inducted for 2006, a class representing 30 individual world titles and eight Olympic gold medals.

<doc id="925412" wikidata="Q4873935" url="?curid=925412" title="Bay Beach Amusement Park">
<text>Bay Beach is a municipal amusement park in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Situated near the mouth of the Fox River, on the east bank as it flows into Green Bay, the park contains rides, concessions, a roller coaster, and a food pavilion. Dances, movies, and other events are held in a pavilion. The park is adjacent to the Bay Beach Wildlife Sanctuary.

== History ==
The park&#x27;s history dates to the 1890s when entrepreneur Mitchell Nejedlo purchased the land. Originally intended to be divided and sold for summer cottages, he turned it into Bay View Beach. Bay View Beach had a dance hall, a bar, and a bathhouse, however, because it was swampy and infested with mosquitoes, the park didn&#x27;t attract many visitors. In 1908 Captain John Cusick bought the resort from Nejedlo. Cusick built an 8-foot dock that extended 570 feet into the bay, then bought a steamboat to transport customers from Walnut Street Bridge to Bay View Beach. When swimming became popular, Cusick began renting swimsuits for $0.10. On a good day, he could bring in as much as $450. In 1901 a roller coaster was built. Then in 1908, Cusick built a ride called &quot;Shoot the Chutes&quot;, a flat-bottomed boat that could hold 12 people. The boat was slid down a 50-foot ramp and onto the water. The ride cost $0.10.

In 1911 Bay View Beach was sold to Frank Emery Murphy, born 1862 (Green Bay Alderman, corporate executive of Murphy Lumber, Murphy Supply, Morley - Murphy Company, and owner of the prestigious Horse Shoe Bay Farms in Door County, Wisconsin) and Fred A. Rahr born 1863, (Green Bay Alderman, operator of Rahr&#x27;s Brewing Company, Treasurer of the Green Bay Volunteer Fire Department when it was organized in 1887). In 1920 they donated the 11 acres, along with all its buildings and attractions, to the city of Green Bay to be used as a City Park, Called Bay Beach Park.

From the site&#x27;s earliest days as a private park, a public beach was available, but pollution of the bay eventually caused the swimming beach to close. From the 1930s to the early 1970s, Bay Beach&#x27;s pavilion hosted concerts, political rallies, dances, Fourth of July fireworks, and other events. On August 9, 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt visited Bay Beach in celebration of Green Bay&#x27;s tercentennial of the landing of French explorer Jean Nicolet in 1634.

Today the park is a family place, with scenic views and rides for children, including bumper cars, two small-scale passenger train rides, a large slide, and a Ferris wheel.

=== Upgrades ===
In 2006, of land west of the Bay Beach boundary was purchased to upgrade and expand the park. Plans include tearing down and replacing the original Ferris wheel, replacing the Scat with a new ride, and expanding the train tracks to circle the enlarged acreage. On March 2, 2010, the city of Green Bay approved the purchase of the nearly century-old Zippin Pippin wooden roller coaster from Memphis, Tennessee, where it had sat derelict for five years. A groundbreaking took place on August 25, 2010, and construction on the Zippin Pippin began in September 2010. Construction was completed in April 2011 and the Zippin Pippin is now open.

In early 2013, a Bay Beach Master Plan was proposed. Phase 1 of the plan is broken into five two-year segments. The first is the addition of the Sea Dragon ride and expanding the train track to loop under the Zippin Pippin by 2015. 
Narrow gauged trains and 3 cars modeled after those at the Milwaukee zoo were donated in 2014, with +3000 feet of track operating for the 2015 season.
For phase 2, in 2017 and 2018, two more rides are scheduled to arrive at the park. In 2017 the Falling Star Ride was introduced. In 2019 a 100 feet tall Ferris wheel opened. In 2023, the park added new thrill ride “NebulaZ.”

<doc id="925417" wikidata="Q453337" url="?curid=925417" title="Emlyn Hughes">
<text>Emlyn Walter Hughes (28 August 1947 – 9 November 2004) was an English footballer. He started his career at Blackpool in 1964 before moving to Liverpool in 1967. He made 665 appearances for Liverpool and captained the side to three league titles and an FA Cup victory in the 1970s. Added to these domestic honours were two European Cups, including Liverpool&#x27;s first in 1977; and two UEFA Cup titles. Hughes won the Football Writers&#x27; Player of the Year in 1977. Hughes completed a full set of English football domestic honours by winning the League Cup with Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1980. In addition to Wolves, he later played for Rotherham United, Hull City, Mansfield Town and Swansea City. Hughes earned 62 caps for the England national team, which he also captained.

After retiring from football, he worked as a media personality, mainly with the BBC. He was made an OBE in 1980 for his services to sport. Hughes died of a brain tumour, aged 57, in 2004.

==Early life==
Emlyn Hughes was born in Barrow-in-Furness, the son of Fred Hughes, a Great Britain, Wales, Barrow, and Workington Town rugby league footballer.

==Career==

===Blackpool: 1964–1967===
After being refused a trial by local side Barrow, Hughes joined First Division side Blackpool. He made his debut for Blackpool in 1964 playing alongside Jimmy Armfield and Alan Ball, initially as an inside forward, but later at left-half.

===Liverpool: 1967–1979===

====1960s====
In February 1967, after 28 appearances for Blackpool, Hughes joined Liverpool, managed by Bill Shankly, for £65,000 (). Hughes made his Liverpool debut in a 2–1 league win over Stoke City at Anfield on 4 March 1967. He scored his first goal in a 6–0 defeat of Newcastle United at Anfield on 26 August the same year.

Hughes settled into the midfield at Liverpool during a transitional period for the club, earning the nickname &quot;Crazy Horse&quot; after an illegal rugby tackle on Newcastle United winger Albert Bennett. Liverpool did not win any honours in his first four seasons there, but Hughes was seen as a forerunner of the future which Shankly had in mind. His versatility was noticed too – he filled in at left back and central defence, a trait which was spotted by England coach Alf Ramsey in 1969.

Ramsey gave Hughes his debut on 5 November of that year, playing him at left back in a friendly against the Netherlands at the Olympic Stadium, Amsterdam. England won 1–0. He played in the next game in the same position. Hughes scored his only international goal against Wales, the opening goal of a 3–0 British Home Championship victory at Ninian Park in 1972.

====1970====
For Hughes, 1970 was an important year in his career. After Liverpool were beaten by Second Division side Watford in the quarter finals of the FA Cup, Shankly made a decision to clear out many of the senior players who had in the previous eight years won two League titles, an FA Cup, and reached a European Cup Winners Cup final, and recruit younger players to replace them. Hughes, not yet 23, survived the cull, together with Ian Callaghan and Tommy Smith, and the new recruits who would help establish Liverpool&#x27;s dominance in the 1970s began to arrive.

Meanwhile, England were about to fly to Mexico and defend the World Cup won four years earlier. Hughes had six caps by the time Ramsey included him in his provisional squad of 27 which flew to South America for altitude-acclimatising friendly games against Colombia and Ecuador. Hughes featured in neither game but was selected in the final squad of 22. He was the youngest player selected by Ramsey, and the only Liverpool player in the squad.

Along with Nobby Stiles, Hughes was one of only two outfield players who did not feature in any game. England progressed to the quarter finals, where they were defeated by West Germany. Questions were raised about Ramsey&#x27;s decisions during the game. He controversially withdrew Bobby Charlton and Martin Peters in the second half but retained a clearly exhausted Terry Cooper, who played at left back the entire 120 minutes although Hughes was available to replace him. Hughes would never play in a World Cup.

====1970–1971====
In the 1970–71 season, Liverpool reached the FA Cup final, losing 2–1 after extra-time to Arsenal, who completed the then-rare double of League title and FA Cup. Hughes was distraught as he collected his loser&#x27;s medal, and BBC commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme remarked: &quot;Emlyn Hughes there, really absolutely sick.&quot; By this time, Hughes had established a reputation for charging upfield from his defensive midfield position on long runs, and for constantly berating referees.

====1972====
In 2008, Tommy Smith claimed in his autobiography that on 8 May 1972, Hughes told him that he had been speaking to a number of Arsenal players who were &quot;willing to throw a match for £50 a man.&quot; Liverpool subsequently failed to win the vital match at Highbury, which meant that Derby County won the league title. Smith wrote that he was &quot;disgusted&quot; with what Hughes said and never spoke to him off the field again. Smith maintained that the only witness was Ian Callaghan. Smith also stated that he thought Hughes was trying to &quot;set him up&quot; and was not really trying to bribe Arsenal players. Smith said he never told Shankly because it would have &quot;broken his heart&quot;.

Hughes appeared again for England in the quarter-final of the 1972 European Championships, again under Ramsey, again facing West Germany, again with the same result; victory for West Germany.

====1973–1974====
In 1973, Hughes won his first League title with Liverpool and his first European honour with the UEFA Cup, against Borussia Mönchengladbach. After scoring goals in a memorable win over Merseyside rivals Everton at Goodison Park, Hughes was made Liverpool captain after Tommy Smith had a publicised falling-out with Shankly, who nonetheless kept him in the team. Smith and Hughes&#x27; off-field relationship, already strained due to the bribery incident 18 months earlier, fractured beyond all repair after this, although it never visibly affected their football.

In October 1973, Ramsey selected Hughes to be left back as England hosted Poland at Wembley. Only an England victory would secure a place at the 1974 World Cup, with any other result seeing Poland qualify. England dominated the match but were denied constantly by Polish goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski. Then Poland had a breakaway after a misplaced tackle by Norman Hunter in the second half, and only Hughes and goalkeeper Peter Shilton were back to defend. The ball was passed to Jan Domarski who shot from the edge of the area. Hughes lunged into a last-ditch tackle but Domarski&#x27;s shot evaded his block and slipped under Shilton&#x27;s body and into the net. England equalised through an Allan Clarke penalty but the match ended 1–1 and England failed to qualify.

At the end of the 1973–74 season, Liverpool reached the FA Cup final and beat Newcastle United 3–0, with Hughes receiving the trophy from The Princess Anne. Later that month Hughes was also appointed England captain, replacing Bobby Moore, by caretaker boss Joe Mercer. Hughes led out England for the first time on 11 May 1974 against Wales in Cardiff, which England won 2–0.

====1975====
Hughes captained England for all of Mercer&#x27;s seven games in charge, and initially maintained the role when Don Revie was appointed as Ramsey&#x27;s permanent successor. However, after the first two qualifiers for the 1976 European Championships, Revie dropped Hughes from the team, giving the captaincy to Hughes&#x27; former Blackpool teammate Alan Ball.

With Liverpool under the guidance of Bob Paisley following Shankly&#x27;s retirement in 1974, Hughes focused on club football. Liverpool won no honours in Paisley&#x27;s first season in charge but achieved another League championship and UEFA Cup double in 1976.

====1977====
The 1976–77 season began with a shock recall to England by Don Revie, who played Hughes in the second qualifier for the 1978 World Cup, under national captain and clubmate Kevin Keegan. Hughes was now predominantly a central defender and played in a tactically disastrous team against Italy in Rome, which marked the lowest point of Revie&#x27;s tenure as England manager. England lost 2–0.

Revie selected Hughes for further games through the early part of 1977, during which time Liverpool sought an unprecedented treble of League Championship, FA Cup and European Cup. They won the title but lost the FA Cup final to bitter rivals Manchester United. Four days later, Hughes captained Liverpool to a 3–1 win over Borussia Mönchengladbach in Rome to win the 1977 European Cup Final, the first time the team won Europe&#x27;s most prestigious club title. He was voted the Football Writers&#x27; Association Footballer of the Year.

====1978–1979====
Revie gave Hughes the England captaincy back for a Home International match against Scotland when Keegan was unavailable, before selecting him for the squad which would tour South America in the summer. On returning to England, Ron Greenwood took over as England manager, returning the captaincy to Hughes. England could not qualify for the World Cup after a defeat by Italy, but Hughes nonetheless celebrated a 50th cap when England beat the Italians 2–0 in the final qualifier at Wembley at the end of 1977.

In 1978, Hughes was in the Liverpool team which played and lost its first ever League Cup final, to Brian Clough&#x27;s Nottingham Forest in a replay. The league title went to Forest too, but Liverpool retained the European Cup with a 1–0 win over FC Bruges at Wembley, allowing Hughes to lift the trophy for a second consecutive year. By this time Hughes&#x27;s place in the side was under threat from talented young Scottish defender Alan Hansen, who had arrived the previous season for £100,000 from Partick Thistle.

The following season Hughes made just 16 appearances in the side, enough to earn his final title medal. Liverpool lost to Manchester United in the FA Cup semi-finals, with Hughes caught out of position for the winning goal. He never played for Liverpool again. He was sold to Wolverhampton Wanderers for £90,000 in August 1979. Hughes left Liverpool after 665 appearances, scoring 49 goals, for the club. His 59 appearances for England while at Liverpool made him the club&#x27;s most capped player until Welsh striker Ian Rush broke the record more than ten years later.

===Wolverhampton Wanderers: 1979–1981===
Hughes made his Wolves debut at the Baseball Ground on 22 August 1979 in a 1–0 win over Derby County. He went on to win the League Cup in his first season with Wolves – the only trophy he did not win with Liverpool – lifting it as captain after a 1–0 win over Nottingham Forest at Wembley.

He continued to be selected for England squads even after leaving Liverpool. He featured sporadically in England&#x27;s successful qualifying campaign for the 1980 European Championships, he captained the team for the final time in the 1–1 1980 Home International game with Northern Ireland draw at Wembley and won his 62nd and final cap against Scotland in the next game as a substitute.

Greenwood included him in the squad for the European Championship finals in Italy as an experienced reserve, but Hughes did not play any matches and England were eliminated in the group stages. Hughes was England&#x27;s only connection with their previous foray into the finals of a tournament – the 1970 World Cup – but his non-participation in either made him England&#x27;s most capped player never to feature in a major finals. He also became only the fifth player to represent England in three separate decades, joining Jesse Pennington, Stanley Matthews, Bobby Charlton and Peter Shilton. The 57 caps Hughes earned in the 1970s made him the most capped England player of the decade.

===Rotherham United: 1981–1983===
Hughes left Wolves in 1981, joining Rotherham United as player-manager. Inheriting a side that had won the Third Division championship under Ian Porterfield, including such players as John Breckin, Tony Towner and Ronnie Moore, Rotherham made a patchy start to the season and were in the relegation zone in January. However, a run of nine consecutive wins followed and Rotherham climbed from third last to third place in the league. Promotion was missed by four points, but the finish of 7th place was the Millers&#x27; highest since the 1960s.

The following season Rotherham appeared to be holding their ground in the Second Division and were 9th at the start of 1983. However, the side plummeted down the table. On the morning of 20 March Hughes was asked to resign as manager. He refused and was sacked, to be replaced by George Kerr the following day. Rotherham were relegated after winning only one more game during the season.

===Later football career===
Hughes also played for Hull City, later becoming a director. He joined Mansfield Town briefly in 1983 but did not make any appearances for the club. Later that year he also turned out for Swansea City, with whom he brought his playing career to a close.

==Post-football career==
In 1979, Hughes became a team captain on the long-running BBC quiz &quot;A Question of Sport&quot;, opposite the former rugby union footballer Gareth Edwards. He left the programme in 1981, but returned in 1984, this time playing against England&#x27;s former rugby union captain Bill Beaumont. Hughes became much mimicked for his competitive nature and high-pitched protestations when not being able to recall an answer. He once identified a picture of a heavily muddied jockey as John Reid, only to be told it was Princess Anne. Later in the same series, she appeared on the programme, joining Hughes&#x27;s team. Hughes caused a minor national debate when he defied protocol and put his arm around her. He called her &quot;ma&#x27;am&quot; throughout, except for one occasion, when he referred to her as &quot;mate&quot;. Hughes later joined her team for the much criticised &quot;It&#x27;s a Royal Knockout&quot; project, the brainchild of her brother Prince Edward.

Hughes&#x27;s involvement with the BBC also included work as an analyst on radio. Alongside Peter Jones he was present at the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985, saying &quot;Football has died and the hooligans have won.&quot; He also was a member of the punditry panel for BBC Television&#x27;s coverage of the 1986 FIFA World Cup. Hughes hosted the short-lived BBC game show &quot;Box Clever&quot; during 1986 and 1987. However, he left &quot;A Question of Sport&quot; – and the corporation as a whole – in 1987 to go to ITV and captain a team on &quot;Sporting Triangles&quot;. Through this, he occasionally appeared as a pundit on ITV&#x27;s football coverage. He was also immortalised in comic strip form as he was signed by Melchester Rovers in the &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot; strip; he also wrote a column for the teenage football magazine &quot;Match&quot;. Alongside Peter Jones again, he was present at the Hillsborough disaster in April 1989. Later, he paid visits to the parents of Andrew Devine, who was left comatose after the tragedy, in hospital and offered them support and assistance.

==Final years==
In later years, Hughes lived a quiet retirement, occasionally working as an after-dinner or motivational speaker. In 1992, he appeared on an episode of &quot;GamesMaster&quot; promoting the football video game which carried his name, &quot;Emlyn Hughes International Soccer&quot;. From March 2002, he became a presenter and pundit on the nightly football phone-in on Real Radio Yorkshire. From 1995 Hughes became chief patron to the Sheffield-based charity FABLE (For a Better Life with Epilepsy).

In 2003, it was announced that he was suffering from a brain tumour, for which he underwent surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Hughes was married to Barbara and had a son and daughter, both named after him (Emlyn Jr. and Emma Lynn).

His last public appearance was at the 2004 Grand National, seven months before his death; he was interviewed on &quot;Grandstand&quot; as an owner of Mantles Prince, one of the runners. He died at his home in Dore, Sheffield, at the age of 57. A minute&#x27;s silence was held the following evening at Anfield before Liverpool&#x27;s game against Middlesbrough in the League Cup. His funeral service took place at Sheffield Cathedral.

==Legacy==

Eight days after Hughes&#x27; death, England players wore black armbands in a friendly against Spain. England forward Wayne Rooney attracted controversy after throwing his black armband to the floor, following a 42nd minute substitution for Alan Smith. Rooney later apologised.

Hughes was voted at No.10 on the official Liverpool Football Club web site poll &quot;100 Players Who Shook The Kop&quot;. A statue of Hughes was unveiled in his birthplace of Barrow-in-Furness in 2008. It is placed in front of a new office building on Abbey Road which was also named Emlyn Hughes House after him. A cancer support charity in Hughes&#x27; name is run by the Freemasons of Tapton Masonic Hall in Sheffield, of which Hughes was a member. Hughes is also remembered at Anfield, a statue of him being carried by Bob Paisley was unveiled in 2020.

==Awards==
In the 1980 New Year Honours, Hughes was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to football, and later featured on the television tribute show &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;.

On 24 July 2008, it was announced that Hughes would be inducted into the National Football Museum&#x27;s Hall of Fame. The National Football Museum in Preston started its Hall of Fame in 2002 with the inductees chosen by a selection panel that included Gordon Banks, Sir Trevor Brooking, Sir Alex Ferguson, Sir Bobby Charlton, Jack Charlton, Mark Lawrenson and Gary Lineker. The awards were presented at the annual ceremony, held at the Millennium Mayfair Hotel in London on 18 September.

<text>Purlie is a musical with a book by Ossie Davis, Philip Rose, and Peter Udell, lyrics by Udell and music by Gary Geld. It is based on Davis&#x27;s 1961 play &quot;Purlie Victorious&quot;. 

== Plot ==
&quot;Purlie&quot; is set in an era when Jim Crow laws still were in effect in the American South. Its focus is on the dynamic traveling preacher Purlie Victorious Judson, who returns to his small Georgia town hoping to save Big Bethel, the community&#x27;s church, and emancipate the cotton pickers who work on oppressive Ol&#x27; Cap&#x27;n Cotchipee&#x27;s plantation. With the assistance of Lutiebelle Gussie Mae Jenkins, Purlie hopes to pry loose from Cotchipee an inheritance due his long-lost cousin and use the money to achieve his goals. Also playing a part in Purlie&#x27;s plans is Cotchipee&#x27;s son Charlie, who ultimately proves to be far more fair-minded than his Simon Legree–like father and who saves the church from destruction with an act of defiance that has dire consequences for the tyrannical Cap&#x27;n.

== Production notes ==

Although Davis did not participate actively in the creation of the musical, so much of his original script was included in the final project that Peter Udell and Philip Rose felt he should share credit for the book.

After 28 previews, the Broadway production, directed by Rose and choreographed by Louis Johnson, opened on March 15, 1970, at the Broadway Theatre. It later transferred to the Winter Garden and then the ANTA Playhouse before completing its 688-performance run. The cast included Cleavon Little as Purlie, John Heffernan as Cotchipee, Melba Moore as Lutiebelle, and C. David Colson as Charlie, with Sherman Hemsley, Linda Hopkins, Novella Nelson, and Helen Martin in supporting roles. Robert Guillaume replaced Little later in the run. Johnson&#x27;s choreography was nominated for a Tony Award.

The first edition of the original cast recording was released by Ampex Records; it was later re-released on RCA Victor.

A U.S. national tour, leading up to the Broadway revival, ran from November 20, 1971 to December 2, 1972. It featured Guillaume as Purlie, Patti Jo as Lutiebelle, Sherman Hemsley as Gitlow, Helen Martin as Idella, Tommy Breslin as Charlie and Art Wallace as Ol&#x27; Cap&#x27;n.

After two previews, a Broadway revival directed by Philip Rose and choreographed by Johnson opened on December 27, 1972, at the Billy Rose Theatre, where it ran for 14 performances. Guillame and Hemsley reprised their original roles, with Art Wallace as Cotchipee, Patti Jo as Lutiebelle, and Douglas Norwick as Charlie.

A 1981 television adaptation for Showtime directed by Rudi Goldman starred Broadway cast members Guillaume, Moore, Hemsley, and Hopkins, with Brandon Maggart as Cotchipee, Clarice Taylor as Idella, and Don Scardino as Charlie. The production won a CableACE Award.

The first London production was a fringe theatre staging at the Bridewell Theatre in 2004. The cast included Tee Jaye as Purlie, John Lyons as Cotchipee, Victoria Wilson-James as Missy Judson, and Joanna Francis as Lutiebelle.

In 2005, Sheldon Epps directed a US national tour co-produced by the Pasadena Playhouse and the Goodman Theatre. His New York City Center &quot;Encores!&quot; staging that same year featured Blair Underwood, Anika Noni Rose, Lillias White, and John Cullum.

<doc id="925425" wikidata="Q3041655" url="?curid=925425" title="List of copyright duration by country">
<text>Copyright is the right to copy and publish a particular work. The terms &quot;copy&quot; and &quot;publish&quot; are quite broad. They include copying in electronic form, the making of translated versions, the creation of a television program based on the work, and putting the work on the Internet. A work is protected by copyright if it is a literary or artistic work. This general expression covers almost all products of creative and original effort. Copyright protects only the specific expression of an idea, not the idea itself. A collection of facts may be copyrighted if there was creative activity involved in compiling the collection. Several countries provide separate protection for collections of facts that qualify as &quot;databases&quot;, but that provision is not considered copyright. Copyright protection is automatic upon creation of the work. In some countries, registration with a copyright office has additional benefits, such as the ability to sue, or to receive more money in damages. When a work&#x27;s copyright term ends, the work passes into the public domain.

==Berne Convention==

The Berne Convention stipulates that the duration of the term for copyright protection is the life of the author plus at least 50 years after their death. For some categories of works, the minimum duration is shorter: for example, the minimum term for applied art is 25 years, movies have a minimum term of 50 years. Most countries have opted for a longer term of protection, as permitted.

Under the Convention, the duration of copyright depends on the length of the author&#x27;s life. Berne specifies that copyright exists a minimum of 50 years after the author&#x27;s death, while a number of countries, including the European Union and the United States, have extended that to 70 years after the author&#x27;s death. A small number of countries have extended copyright even further, with Mexico having the lengthiest term at 100 years after the author&#x27;s death.

===United States===
In 1989, the Berne Convention became effective in the U.S. Since that date, U.S. authors obtain copyright on their works automatically, with registration no longer required. However, many U.S. texts on copyright have not been updated and still echo the old registration principle.

Copyright registration remains available in the U.S. To initiate a lawsuit against an infringer, registration is still required. Registration offers the potential of statutory damages from the infringer, rather than only actual damages.

===European Union===
All countries within the European Union are signatory states of the Berne Convention. Additionally, Copyright in the European Union is regulated through European Directives.

The member states of the European Union have, following a directive, increased the term to life of the author plus 70 years after their death. Although this was not the original intention, the extension applies retroactively; this had the effect that works that had ended up in the public domain because the author was dead for 50 years, received an additional twenty years of protection.

European countries follow the principle that copyright protection is granted automatically upon creation of the work. This principle was first established in the Berne Convention (1886), and Article 5 of the Convention expressly forbids any member country to require formal action for copyright protection.

==Copyright duration by country==
Countries and respective copyright terms, with length of standard copyright in years are listed. Entries for non-country entities are included: the European Union, Berne Convention, and the Universal Copyright Convention, which set minimum terms for their member states or signatories. The Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), though not included, requires a copyright length of at least 50 years after death.

===Legend===
* 0, has no copyright = Not copyrighted at all
* Life + xx years = Copyrighted for authors&#x27; lifetime plus xx years after their deaths
* xx years after publication, creation, etc. = copyrighted for xx years since publication, creation, etc., of works
* Until year end = Copyrighted until the end of a calendar year, i.e. 31 December, unless otherwise specified
* Berne = Country has signed the Berne Convention, see Berne in the &quot;Countries, ...&quot; column
* TRIPS = The Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) is an international agreement administered by the World Trade Organization (WTO) that sets down minimum standards for many forms of intellectual property (IP) regulation as applied to nationals of other WTO Members. This also indicates that this country has at least a minimum of 50 years after the death of the creator until the copyright expires.
* WCT = The World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty, (WIPO Copyright Treaty or WCT), is an international treaty on copyright law adopted by the member states of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in 1996.

<doc id="925439" wikidata="Q12858" url="?curid=925439" title="VRT (broadcaster)">
<text>The Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie (&quot;Flemish Radio and Television broadcasting organisation&quot;), shortened to VRT (), is one of the national public service broadcasters for the Flemish Community of Belgium. Its counterpart in the French Community is the French-language RTBF (), and in the German-speaking Community it is BRF ().

The VRT operates six television channels (, , , , and ) together with a number of radio channels, including , , , , and .

==History==

The VRT is the successor to a succession of organisations. The Belgian National Institute of Radio Broadcasting was founded in 1930 and existed until 1960. This became the (BRT) in 1960 and the (BRTN) from 1991 to 1998.

The NIR/INR and BRT (; RTB) had each been single state-owned entities with separate Dutch- and French-language production departments. They were housed in the Flagey Building, also known as the &quot;Radio House&quot;, from when the new building was completed in 1938 until 1974 when the building became too small. However, in 1977, as part of the ongoing state reform in Belgium broadcasting became reserved to the language communities rather than the national government in 1977. Accordingly, BRT/RTB went their separate ways in 1977. While the former French half changed its name to RTBF in 1977, the Dutch side retained the BRT name until becoming BRTN in 1991. However, the two broadcasters share production facilities on Auguste Reyerslaan in Brussels.

The final renaming of the VRT, on 1 January 1998, followed a change in the organization&#x27;s legal status. From being part of a semi-governmental entity (a in Belgian terminology) it had, on 16 April 1997, become a publicly owned corporation () in its own right.

As successors to the NIR/INR, the VRT and its counterpart in the French Community of Belgium, RTBF, share the Belgian membership in the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). Along with RTBF, it is one of the 23 founding members.

With the ending of its television monopoly – marked by the creation of VTM, a commercial television company that initially captured more than half of the VRT&#x27;s audience – the public broadcaster has been compelled to fight back, and part of its successful response has been the use of external production houses such as Woestijnvis, the creator of such formats as &#x27; and &#x27;.

==Editorial independence==
, the Media and Journalism Research Center evaluated the VRT to be &quot;Independent State Funded and State Managed/Owned Media&quot; under its State Media Matrix.

==Television channels==
Television channels are transmitted on:
* Cable to all Belgian and Dutch cable providers;
* Satellite with paid TV Vlaanderen subscription (encrypted DVB-S2 using SES Astra network).
* Terrestrial with paid TV Vlaanderen subscription (encrypted DVB-T2 using Norkring network) in Flanders and paid Digitenne subscription (encrypted DVB-T2) in the Netherlands. Free-to-air DVB-T broadcast by the VRT was discontinued on 1 December 2018.
* IPTV to all major Belgian internet providers (Proximus, Orange, Scarlet);

===Current channels===
* VRT 1, the main channel, formerly known as Eén and TV1. Started in 1953 on VHF channel 10. In PAL colour since 1971. In 1977 the transmission standard changed from Belgian 625 to European CCIR) standard.
* VRT Canvas, the quality TV channel. Began broadcasting in December 1997, originally timeshared with Ketnet before it became a standalone channel in May 2012.
* Ketnet, the children&#x27;s channel launched in May 2012. Formerly timeshared with Canvas&#x27;s channel from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.
* Sporza, is a multimedia brand and sports division. It is name given to the sport&#x27;s programming broadcast on the above channels and as a program on Radio 1. It was originally created as a third standalone channel that was broadcast temporarily for 96 days in summer 2004 and was also a radio station (the successor to 927Live) from May 2004 until October 2017. During major sports events (such as the Olympics) it is not uncommon for two or more channels to simultaneously air Sporza.
* VRT NWS, the news service.
* , the on demand service.

The VRT&#x27;s third television channel, known as , was launched in May 2012. It is not a full-fledged television channel because it has no name, identity or logo. It broadcasts programs from the above channels in a shared schedule under the respective titles &quot;Één+&quot; and &quot;Canvas+&quot;.

===Former channels===

* , the broadcasters second channel, was launched on 26 April 1977 as BRT TV2. The channel offered a daily current affairs program (&quot;Terzake&quot;), an evening news bulletin (&quot;Het Journaal&quot;), arts and cultural programs alongside extended broadcasts of major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games, football and cycling races. Children&#x27;s programs and family-friendly films were broadcast in the morning and afternoon, ending around early evening often in collaboration with Nederlandse Onderwijs Televisie (NOT; Netherlands Educational Television). It was broadcast until 30 November 1997, when TV2 was closed and ceased transmission. On 1 December 1997, BRTN TV2 was split into two distinct time-shared channels: BRTN Ketnet and BRTN Canvas. The two channels were part of BRTN until 1998 and were split in May 2012; Canvas and Ketnet are still broadcasting as part of VRT2, the official umbrella name for the channels, Sporza and the small Flemish church broadcasters.

* OP12 (Dutch for: &quot;on twelve&quot;) was a third channel used as a backup in the event of primetime shortage, mostly used for excess sports and culture programs. It was launched in 2012 but due to financial cutbacks was discontinued in 2014.

*BVN was a joint Dutch-Flemish TV station for international audiences; some VRT programmes aired as part of BVN&#x27;s schedule. The VRT left the BVN venture in July 2021; the channel is currently owned exclusively by the Dutch public broadcaster NPO and airs an exclusively Dutch schedule.

==Radio channels==
The VRT broadcasts radio channels in both analog format (FM) and digital format (using DAB+). All channels are also broadcast live over the Internet at Radio Plus. International broadcasting was done via the VRT&#x27;s Radio Vlaanderen Internationaal (RVi).

<doc id="925445" wikidata="Q739730" url="?curid=925445" title="Battle Dress Uniform">
<text>The Battle Dress Uniform (BDU) is a camouflaged combat uniform that was used by the United States Armed Forces as their standard combat uniform from the early 1980s to the mid-2000s. Since then, it has been replaced or supplanted in every branch of the U.S. Armed Forces.

BDU-style uniforms and derivatives still see widespread use in other countries (some of them being former U.S. surplus stocks transferred under U.S. security assistance programs), while others are still worn by some U.S. federal, state, and local law enforcement agents who may work in tactical situations, such as the DEA FAST and SWAT teams. The uniforms are also used by urban search and rescue groups such as FEMA USAR task force teams and firefighting agencies when conducting technical rescues or other special operations.

As late as 2014, BDUs were worn by officers of the U.S. Public Health Service as the prescribed uniform for deployment, but have since been replaced by a variant of the U.S. Coast Guard&#x27;s Operational Dress Uniform.

==Background==
While the Italian Army was the first military organization to issue camouflage clothing, albeit in limited numbers, the Germans were noted for their efforts in this field before the Second World War. After much trial, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (abbrev. OKW) authorized Heeres-Splittermuster 31, more commonly known as &quot;splinter pattern&quot;, for use in shelter-quarters (&quot;Zeltbahnen&quot;) in the 1930s. In 1940, SS-Verfügungstruppe (abbrev. SS-VT; renamed Waffen-SS) designed, tested, and issued its own distinctive patterns and layout not long after.

The United States Marine Corps received its first military camouflage pattern in 1942, when the reversible, beach-jungle, three- and five-color frog-skin pattern uniform was issued, based on a 1940 trial design. The pattern was mostly employed in the Pacific Theatre but was not found to be particularly effective and in the European Theatre the pattern was withdrawn altogether in 1944—in part because of anticipated friendly fire incidents after D-Day, due to its similarity to the Waffen SS&#x27;s pattern (not to be confused with Flecktarn, a post-war design). Camouflaged helmet covers and shelters were issued in the 1950s in &quot;wine leaf&quot; and &quot;brown cloud&quot; patterns. The U.S. Army also tried a lesser-known camouflage uniform on D-Day and throughout the Normandy operations, like the Marine Corps uniforms, but it was replaced by the M43 uniform before being used much.

During the Vietnam War, the United States Armed Forces&#x27; four-color ERDL pattern saw limited use among specialist units in the U.S. Army, though most were issued the solid olive green OG107 sateens or jungle fatigues, while the Marines adopted the pattern service-wide after 1968.

The ERDL pattern fatigues were identical in cut to the third-pattern OD jungle fatigues, and were available in both a highland pattern (more brown) and a lowland pattern (more green), though the lowland pattern was eventually phased out. Other, unofficial, patterns utilized in Vietnam included black-dyed or spray-painted jungle fatigues, often used by special purpose forces, and various Vietnamese Tigerstripe patterns (themselves being based on French Army airborne and Foreign Legion patterns and a British design utilized in Malaysia), or commercial &quot;duck hunter&quot; patterns.

The general design and configuration of the U.S. BDU uniform were similar to that of the Vietnam War&#x27;s jungle fatigues, which were in turn similar in configuration to specialty uniforms worn by U.S. paratroopers during World War II.

==History==
First issued in limited number to garrison leaders, officers, and generals to all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces in September 1981 for replacement of the long worn and aging Olive Drab colored uniforms or OG-107, the following month, the Battle Dress Uniform began field issue military-wide.

Since 1981, changes included the addition and subsequent elimination of buttoned waist adjustment tabs, the size reduction of the collar, and refinements in stitching and fit.

BDUs were initially only issued in a 50/50 nylon and cotton twill blend called the Temperate Weather BDU or TWBDU. Complaints regarding the heat retention of these uniforms, especially following the invasion of Grenada in 1983, led to the introduction of the Hot Weather BDU, the HWBDU. The Hot Weather BDU coat and trousers were constructed of 100 percent ripstop cotton, in a four-color woodland camouflage pattern. However, after complaints of shorter wear and frayed cuffs, along with requirements imposed by unit commanders to starch the all-cotton uniform for parade, the Enhanced Hot Weather BDU (EHWBDU) replaced the HWBDU commencing in 1996. The EHWBDU&#x27;s components are made with a 50/50 ripstop nylon and cotton poplin blend.

BDUs were printed with infrared-brightened dyes. Near infrared (NIR) Signature Management Technology is used in the uniforms to help prevent detection by NIR image converters. These photocathode devices do not detect temperatures, but rather infrared radiation variances. NIR-compliant uniforms use a special fabric that allows soldiers to appear at the same radiation level as the surrounding terrain, thus making them more difficult to detect. It is advised not to use starch when cleaning or ironing BDUs since starch weakens the fabric and ruins the infrared protective coating. A pair of BDUs that has been starched even once should not be worn in combat.

The tropical weight uniform was not as durable as the temperate weight uniform. The tropical uniform would only last for 4–6 months of use when rotating four uniforms for duty, while the temperate uniform would last over a year under the same conditions.

===U.S. Army===
All United States Army soldiers formally received their first batches of the BDU as its new field and garrison uniform in the temperate weight cut on October 1, 1981. In addition, Patrol caps, Boonie hats, and the M-65 jacket were issued in the new camouflage pattern in time, including a new light brown T-shirt and black webbed belt with brass buckle.

The BDU was the first camouflage uniform approved by the U.S. Army since the Vietnam War, where the ERDL pattern was in limited use. The BDU soon replaced all earlier camouflage pattern uniforms for all wooded, jungle, and tropical environments, and by 1989, had completely replaced the standard olive drab uniforms that had been used since 1952. April 30, 2008 was the final day that the BDU was authorized.

===U.S. Department of Defense===
The BDU was worn by DoD civilians and DoD Police officers.

===U.S. Marine Corps===
The ERDL-patterned BDU was first introduced to the United States Marine Corps in 1977, as they phased out the olive green OG-107, which had been standard wear since the early 1950s.

Originally, no nametapes were worn with the USMC&#x27;s BDUs, which was officially referred to by the USMC as a &quot;camouflage utility uniform&quot; (CCU) during its usage. However, in October 1991, the USMC began the wearing of nametapes on their BDUs (and DCUs and DBDUs) in order to comply with NATO Standardization Agreement (STANAG), becoming mandatory by 1 October 1992. In the USMC&#x27;s case, a nametape bearing the wearer&#x27;s last name was worn embroidered above the right pocket, and a nametape reading &quot;U.S. MARINES&quot; being embroidered was worn above the left pocket. The MCCUU which replaced the BDU continues this.

The USMC&#x27;s BDU was worn with a stenciled iron-on Eagle, Globe, and Anchor (EGA) centered on the wearer&#x27;s left breast pocket, below the pocket flap. Early USMC BDUs featured &quot;USMC&quot; lettering below that EGA, however, that was discontinued later on, with only the EGA being used by the end of the BDU&#x27;s tenure with the USMC. The EGA was ironed onto the BDU blouse pocket by USMC recruits at the end of MCRD upon completion of their training to signify their christening as U.S. Marines. The same was done on the eight-pointed &quot;utility cover&quot; hat that was worn with the USMC&#x27;s version of the BDU. The BDU&#x27;s successor, the MCCUU, has the EGA embroidered instead of stenciled on the blouse&#x27;s chest pocket and all covers.

===U.S. Air Force===
The U.S. Air Force initially only issued ERDL BDUs to combat arms units stationed overseas, such as United States Air Force Security Forces, Combat Controllers, and United States Air Force Pararescue, as of October 1981, the same time as the Army and Marines. The Air Force did not allow non-combat arms to wear the woodland pattern BDU until the summer of 1987 and mandated them as the only &quot;Fatigue&quot; uniform in 1988. The BDU was no longer authorized for wear in the USAF on November 1, 2011.

===U.S. Navy===
Sailors of the United States Navy started issuing the BDU in the new woodland scheme and temperate cut at the same time as the other branches. The U.S. Navy referred to the uniform as the &quot;Camouflage Utility Uniform&quot; (CUU) during its usage.

===U.S. Coast Guard===
Coast Guardsmen started issuing the new woodland BDU around the same time as the other service branches.

=== State Defense Forces ===
Multiple State Defense Force soldiers, airmen, and sailors utilized the woodland BDU as their uniform with modified insignia to denote their affiliation with their state. The Virginia Defense Force utilizes a modified version of the BDU called the Tactical Response Uniform (TRU) which still uses the woodland camouflage pattern. Certain defense forces still use the BDU uniform for Opposing Force operations with their National Guard counterparts.

== Successors ==
The U.S. military has run trials of many camouflage patterns (some being used by foreign militaries), and issued environment-specific uniforms, notably the six-color Desert Battle Dress Uniform (DBDU), nicknamed the &quot;chocolate chip camouflage&quot;, designed in 1962, and the &quot;nighttime desert grid&quot; (NCDBDU). Both uniforms were used in 1991, during the Persian Gulf War. These Desert BDUs were discontinued after the war.

The Desert Camouflage Uniform (DCU) in three-color desert camouflage was introduced in 1992, and was utilized in operations in Somalia (1993); it was in service in Afghanistan and Iraq from the start of hostilities, but the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps have both replaced the DCU with newer uniforms (ACU and MCCUU, respectively). In testing, U.S. Army researchers found that, as in other environments, the color of desert terrain varies, and can range from pink to blue, depending on the minerals in the soil and the time of the day. Since patches of uniform color in the desert are usually 10 times larger than those in wooded areas, it was decided to alter the existing six-color DBDU pattern. This led to the development of a three-color pattern DCU, which was adopted.

The BDU is made in various camouflage patterns by various manufacturers, such as in the MultiCam camouflage, which is in use today mainly by the public, public service persons, and some foreign military units. BDUs can be purchased from civilian vendors in the UCP pattern analogous to the ACU as well, but these are not authorized for wear by the U.S. Army&#x27;s soldiers.

===U.S. Marine Corps===
The development of modern camouflage patterns and the rising desire of the various U.S. military branches to differentiate themselves from each other has resulted in new patterns for uniforms. The U.S. Marine Corps was the first branch to replace their BDUs. The Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform (MCCUU) uses the computer-generated MARPAT pattern and several other enhancements. It was approved for wear in June 2001, became available for purchase in 2002, and the changeover was completed by October 1, 2004. Beyond that date, the BDU was authorized for wear until April 1, 2005, with limited exceptions for those small numbers of Marine Corps personnel who did not yet have the MCCUU. USMC Special Operations units (MARSOC) have recently issued M81 woodland-patterned uniforms to supplement MARPAT uniforms for special missions.

===U.S. Army===

In 2004, the U.S. Army unveiled the Army Combat Uniform (ACU), its successor to the BDU. From late 2005 to early 2008, the U.S. Army undertook the process of replacing the BDU with the ACU, with the BDU being formally discontinued by the Army in April 2008 (though most soldiers had been wearing the ACU for years by then). The Army Junior ROTC followed suit thereafter in 2009.

The original version of the ACU used a pixelated &quot;digital&quot; pattern known as the Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP). UCP is similar to MARPAT but uses more neutral, less saturated colors. The neutral colors, primarily foliage green and sand yellow, are designed to work best in the desert, woodland, and urban combat situations. The ACU in UCP was used by the army in all environments except for areas with snow, as the UCP pattern works poorly against white despite the heavy use of grey. An all-white BDU and the ECWCS are used instead for winterized warfare. Beginning in 2014, the Army switched the ACU to use the Operational Camouflage Pattern (OCP), as UCP was seen as inadequate in many environments.

===U.S. Department of Defense===
Civilian employees of the U.S. Department of Defense in combat zones began wearing the Airman Battle Uniform and Army Combat Uniform in place of the BDU (and its cousin DCU) after it was replaced.

===U.S. Navy===
From 2004 to 2007, the U.S. Navy began issuing a pixelated blue and gray &quot;digital&quot; pattern Navy Working Uniform (NWU) in limited quantities to some sailors on an experimental test basis. While the NWU is neither a tactical uniform nor a battle dress uniform, it is intended to take the place of many existing work ensembles (utilities, wash khaki, coveralls, M81 BDU, etc.). The disruptive pattern is primarily intended to complement U.S. Navy ship colors and to hide stains and wear, and supposedly to make the wearer a less obvious visual target for hostile forces while working aboard a naval vessel in port.

To meet the Navy&#x27;s cold-weather requirements, the NWU includes a fleece jacket, pullover sweater, and parka options. U.S. Navy SEALs, Seabees, and other U.S. Navy personnel deployed ashore under the cognizance of U.S. Naval Forces Central Command used &quot;M81&quot; woodland BDUs (referred to by the navy as CCUs) and DCUs for outdoor operations or activities in specific areas of responsibility (AOR), until the issuance of the NWU Type III in the AOR camouflage pattern.

===U.S. Air Force===
In 2004 and 2005, the U.S. Air Force experimented with but rejected a blue-toned tigerstripe uniform. In 2006, a new BDU-style uniform called the &quot;Airman Battle Uniform&quot; (ABU) was adopted, using a semi-pixelated tiger pattern with four soft earth tones consisting of tan, grey, green and blue. It failed, however, to incorporate many of the significant improvements of the ACU and MCCUU. By 2007, it was in current production.

In 2008, responding to criticism that the new Airman Battle Uniform was too heavy and hot in high-temperature environments, the USAF&#x27;s 648th Aeronautical Systems Squadron at Brooks City-Base revealed plans to switch to a lighter, more breathable fabric for the combat blouse section of the ABU. The original heavyweight nylon-cotton blend was changed to a lighter-weight nylon-cotton poplin material. Priority will go to those serving in the Middle East or other hot-weather theaters.

On May 4, 2016, the National Commander of the Civil Air Patrol announced the USAF&#x27;s approval for the Civil Air Patrol to begin its transition to the Airman Battle Uniform.

On May 14, 2018, the Air Force announced the adoption of the Army&#x27;s Operational Camouflage Pattern uniform; however, its insignia would be distinct. The transition was to be complete by April 1, 2021.

===U.S. Coast Guard===
The U.S. Coast Guard has introduced the new Operational Dress Uniform (ODU) uniform in 2004 to replace the winter and summer &quot;Undress Duty&quot; uniform. Resembling the BDU, the ODU retains the basic design of the old-style BDU uniforms, but with the lower pockets on the blouse being eliminated. The sleeves can be worn &quot;folded up&quot; in a manner similar to the old U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force BDUs and the trousers &quot;bloused&quot; into the boots (unless boating shoes are worn, as is common for the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary, which patrols for the Coast Guard aboard privately owned watercraft), with the ODU black belt and blackened buckle being worn with the metal tip two to four inches from the buckle. The ODU is also issued in a single blue color as opposed to any camouflage pattern. The BDU and DCU were formally retired by the USCG in 2012.

The dark blue Coast Guard unit baseball-style cap is worn with this uniform. The ODU also has all of its allowable insignia sewn on, eliminating the chance of puncture wounds created by the pins if the individual suffers a blow to the chest while wearing a PFD or body armor. The ODU is not intended to be worn by Coast Guard units that engage in combat operations or are deployed overseas. These units continued to wear older woodland BDU and DCU uniforms before adopting the Navy Work Uniform for USCG units overseas or part of other DoD operations.

=== State Defense Forces ===
All State Defense Forces have since retired the woodland BDU uniform in favor of the Army Combat Uniform in either OCP or UCP for garrison and field wear with the Vermont State Guard being the last state to wear the uniform until 2024. Despite the uniform&#x27;s retirement from daily use, it is still utilized in smaller effects as OPFOR wear for participating state soldiers.

<text>Bạc Liêu is a province of Vietnam. It is a coastal province, and is situated in the Mekong Delta region of the southern part of the country.

==Administrative divisions==
Bạc Liêu is subdivided into seven district-level sub-divisions:

* 5 districts:

:* Đông Hải
:* Hòa Binh
:* Hồng Dân
:* Phước Long
:* Vĩnh Lợi

* 1 district-level town:
:* Giá Rai
* 1 provincial city:
** Bạc Liêu (capital)

They are further subdivided into seven commune-level towns (or townlets), 50 communes, and seven wards.

==Geography==
Bạc Liêu is located on Mekong Delta, although it is actually located slightly to the south of the Mekong&#x27;s main outflows. Bạc Liêu is around south of Cần Thơ, the largest city in the Mekong Delta.

==Economy==
The most important parts of Bạc Liêu&#x27;s economy are rice farming, fishing, food processing, and clothing manufacturing.

==History==
After the Fall of Saigon, 30 April 1975, Bạc Liêu province and Cà Mau province were merged into one new entity called Minh Hải province. In 1996, Minh Hải province was split into two, with the northeast becoming Bạc Liêu province and the southwest becoming Cà Mau province. Bac Lieu is renowned for its community of Teochew Chinese.

==Culture==
Vọng cổ, an important song in the traditional music of southern Vietnam, was composed in Bạc Liêu around 1918 or 1919.

Referring to Bac Lieu, many people immediately think of the homeland of Prince Bac Lieu (Công Tử Bạc Liêu) Trần Trinh Huy also called Ba Huy, or the Black Prince – was a famous player not only in Bac Lieu but even in Saigon and the South of Vietnam during the 1930s and 1940s.

<doc id="925448" wikidata="Q16998852" url="?curid=925448" title="Newcastle-under-Lyme Canal">
<text>The Newcastle-under-Lyme Canal was a 3 mile 6 furlongs (6 km) level canal from the Trent &amp; Mersey Canal at Stoke-on-Trent to Newcastle-under-Lyme. It was completed in 1800.
The canal has been disused since 1935.

==Historical timeline==

1795 – an act of Parliament, the (35 Geo. 3. c. 87), is granted giving permission for the &quot;making and maintaining a navigable Canal, from and out of the Navigation from the Trent to the Mersey, at or near Stoke-upon-Trent, in the county of Stafford, to the town of Newcastle-under-Lyme, in the said county&quot;.

1796 – a rival canal, Sir Nigel Gresley&#x27;s Canal opened and had secured exclusive rights to supply Newcastle with coal for 21 years on condition that the price was no higher than 25 pence per ton. The agreement forbade the Newcastle-under-Lyme Canal from carrying any coal other than for use in the pottery trade.

1800 – the canal opened and because Gresley had exclusive rights to coal carrying, limestone became the main cargo on the Newcastle-under-Lyme Canal.

1863 – the canal was sold to the North Staffordshire Railway. By this time the railway company also owned the Trent &amp; Mersey Canal which the Newcastle Canal very much depended on. The canal&#x27;s shareholders did very well out of the deal considering the route had only ever paid out occasional and very low dividends during their ownership. The railway company did not close down the Newcastle Canal and it continued in commercial use.

1921 – the northernmost part of the canal was closed.

1935 – the remaining part of the Newcastle Canal was closed and the whole waterway was abandoned.

present – after its closure the canal was filled in, and today little evidence of the canal remains.

==The route==
The terminus of the Newcastle Canal was close to Brook Lane at an elevation of around 110m. A pub named the Boat &amp; Horses still stands near the former basin though the basin itself was converted into railway sidings many years ago during the construction of the Stoke-on-Trent to Newcastle-under-Lyme train line, which began construction on 26 June 1846. Although still extant in 1971 these sidings have also now been removed.

The canal headed southeast on the west side of London Road (A34). Where Occupation Street leaves London Road is the spot that would have been the bottom of a planned inclined plane providing a link to the Newcastle-under-Lyme Junction Canal, and then on to Sir Nigel Gresley&#x27;s Canal; however this inclined plane was never built and so the two canals never connected. Near here is the newly developed Lyme Valley Parkway, a recreational park built on a former rubbish tip. To the west of the canal line there is a small stream, Lyme Brook.

A little further south there is a small Jewish synagogue/cemetery and a bowling green. The canal ran behind these into a cutting surrounded by a small wood. Past here it emerged by the side of the busy A34 opposite the University Hospital of North Staffordshire. Surprisingly this section has survived and today it is the only part of any of the canal that holds water.

A couple of minor roads crossed the canal as it ran south close to the A34. At Oak Hill the canal curved southwest for a hundred yards or so and then curved back round to head east under the A34. The crossing point on the main road was about halfway between the B5041 (heading north east towards Stoke) and the A34/A500 Hanford roundabout. At Oak Hill the dry bed of the canal can be found behind The Cottage pub.

Roughly following the B5041, the canal continued east until it reached the now minor road but former A5006 which runs north east from the afore mentioned roundabout. When the canal reached the old A5006 it turned again and headed northeast into Boothen. The route pulled away from the A5006 until it came close to the B5041. In Boothen the line of the canal can still be seen where it is grassed over alongside this London Road.

Just before the B5041 and the former canal line met the A52 in Stoke the canal disappeared into a relatively short tunnel.

On the far side of the tunnel is Spode factory and museum, shortly after this the Newcastle Canal ran into the Trent &amp; Mersey Canal near Glebe Street. Until the early 1970s there was a 100 yard stretch of navigable Newcastle-under-Lyme Canal here which was used as moorings for Stoke Boat Club, this stretch was wiped out when the A500 by-pass was built. The one remaining item of the canal which can still be seen in Stoke is the site of a bridge in Corporation Street where both parapets have survived near the junction with London Road (B5041).

<doc id="925453" wikidata="Q5533440" url="?curid=925453" title="Genocidal massacre">
<text>The term genocidal massacre was introduced by Leo Kuper (1908–1994) to describe incidents which have a genocidal component but are committed on a smaller scale when they are compared to genocides such as the Rwandan genocide. Others such as Robert Melson, who also makes a similar differentiation, class genocidal massacres as &quot;partial genocide&quot;.

In his book &quot;Blood and Soil&quot;, Ben Kiernan states that imperial powers have often committed genocidal massacres to control difficult minorities within their empires. As an example he describes the actions of two Roman legions which were sent to Egypt in 68 AD in order to quell Jews who were rioting in Alexandria in support of Jews who were taking part in the First Jewish–Roman War. The Roman governor Tiberius Julius Alexander ordered two legions to massacre the inhabitants of the Jewish quarter, which was carried out to the letter, sparing none whatever their age or sex. The massacre ended after about 50,000 had been killed when Alexander, listening to the pleas of some yet to be killed, felt pity for them and ordered an end to the killings.

Kiernan makes the point that in his opinion, the killings, like genocide, do not have to be organized by the state. In support of his view, he describes several incidents:
* The massacre in the Cave of Frances of all the inhabitants of the Isle of Eigg by members of the Clan MacLeod on a raiding party from the Isle of Skye in 1577 and a retaliatory raid the next year when members of the Clan MacDonald burnt a MacLeod congregation to death in Trumpan Church, which was almost immediately followed by the Battle of the Spoiling Dyke.
* On 27 February 2002, an argument on a train of Hindu pilgrims (returning from Ayodhya) with Muslim vendors at the platform where it had stopped was followed by burning of the train (believed to be an accidental fire but alleged to be arson) that killed 59 people (9 men, 25 women, 25 children). The next day, and for the following two days, riots in Gujarat caused 790 Muslim and 254 Hindu fatalities.

Kiernan states that some genocidal massacres are carried out against groups that are not covered by the Genocide Convention—such as being a member of a political party, or social class—but that these are covered under local laws and international treaties that criminalise crimes against humanity. However he does acknowledge that massacres against groups other than those in the Genocide Convention, and where the intention of the perpetrators did not specifically intend to commit genocide, are a grey area.

William Schabas makes the point that genocidal massacres are criminal offences under international law as a crime against humanity, and during an armed conflict under the laws of war. However he points out that international prosecutions for individual acts are not covered by the Rome Statute (which brought into existence the International Court of Justice) because crimes against humanity must be &quot;widespread or systematic&quot; and war crimes usually have to have a threshold above the individual crime &quot;in particular when committed as part of a plan or policy or as part of a large-scale commission of such crimes&quot;.

Irving Louis Horowitz is critical of Kuper&#x27;s approach. He cites Kuper&#x27;s use of the term &quot;genocidal massacre&quot; to describe the inter-communal violence during the partition of India and during The Troubles in Northern Ireland. Hirsh states &quot;to speak of [these] as genocidal in a context of religious competition and conflict risks diluting the notion of genocide and equating it with any conflict between national, religious, or racial groups&quot;.

<doc id="925458" wikidata="Q734543" url="?curid=925458" title="Some Great Reward">
<text>Some Great Reward is the fourth studio album by the English electronic music band Depeche Mode, released on 24 September 1984 by Mute Records. The album peaked at number five in the United Kingdom and number 51 in the United States, and was supported by the Some Great Reward Tour. This also saw the band using samplers, much like they did in their previous studio album &quot;Construction Time Again&quot; (1983), which they would continue to use in their following studio albums &quot;Black Celebration&quot; (1986), &quot;Music for the Masses&quot; (1987) and &quot;Violator&quot; (1990).

Additionally it also saw the band addressing more personal themes such as sexual politics (&quot;Master and Servant&quot;), adulterous relationships (&quot;Lie to Me&quot;), and arbitrary divine justice (&quot;Blasphemous Rumours&quot;).
&quot;Blasphemous Rumours&quot; was released as a double A-side with &quot;Somebody&quot;.

This was the first album where they achieved chart success in the US with the single &quot;People Are People&quot; which reached No. 13 on the charts in mid-1985 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and was a Top 20 hit in Canada. It was also the first album that peaked at a higher position on a chart that was not from the band&#x27;s home country as it peaked at No. 1 in Germany.

==Tour==

The tour was the band&#x27;s longest to date. A concert held at Alsterdorfer Sporthalle in Hamburg, West Germany, was recorded and issued as a video release titled &quot;The World We Live In and Live in Hamburg&quot; (1985). The European release featured 16 songs, while the North American version featured 11 songs. The video has not yet seen a DVD release.

American synth-pop and electronic band Book of Love were the opening act for all 15 tour dates of the North American leg of the tour.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s Barry McIlheney hailed &quot;Some Great Reward&quot; and noted a &quot;truly remarkable development&quot; in Dave Gahan&#x27;s voice, concluding that while &quot;[i]t used to be okay to slag this bunch off because of their lack of soul, their supposed synthetic appeal, their reluctance to really pack a punch&quot;, the album &quot;just trashes such bad old talk into the ground and demands that you now sit up and take notice of what is happening here, right under your nose&quot;.

&quot;NME&quot; critic David Quantick was critical of the sound of the record, and felt that it &quot;suffers from too many missed grips on good ideas&quot;. He continues: &quot;It ought to be an intelligent chart contender, a mix of commercial class and magpie manipulation of the unconventional; it isn&#x27;t. When that bonk and clatter is used... it&#x27;s just a nod to left-field, rather than use of the sound.&quot; Of the songs and singing he says: &quot;Often the tunes are ordinary; Martin Gore, as ever, favours a bit of a drone. In small doses (singles) this is fine. Over 40 minutes, the interest begins to wane. Dave Gahan&#x27;s voice has improved greatly – in that he&#x27;s learned how to use its limited range – but like the melodies, it imparts mucho sameiness to the record.&quot; He concludes: &quot;Depeche Mode can be one the few acts worthy of the name pop group. It&#x27;s just that they should be so much better.&quot;

In &quot;Number One&quot;, Sunie expressed similar reservations: &quot;The sadly under-rated Depeches turn out consistently excellent singles. But 45s rather than LPs remain their forte [...] They&#x27;ve progressed a million musical miles from their boppy origins, but Martin Gore&#x27;s lyrics haven&#x27;t kept up. Over a whole LP, their gaucheness is a major distraction from the record&#x27;s musical merits.&quot;

Carole Linfield, in &quot;Sounds&quot;, felt the balance of powerful music and personal lyrics was just right: &quot;The combination of the Depeche strength of vocal and now the Depeche delicacy is going to be hard to beat... This package is a carefully assorted, daintily arranged symphony ... one that carries emotion, devotion and yet never gives way to feebleness or predictability. OK... the lyrics look trite, often naïve and frequently clichéd when printed out [...] Yet Depeche have the right balance and necessary gauche to pull it off. Perhaps it&#x27;s simply that power – never mawkish – that sustains it. Whichever way, the combination locks in. The Depeche Mode clicks.&quot;

German DJ Paul van Dyk cited &quot;Some Great Reward&quot; as his all-time favourite album, stating it is &quot;one of the albums that really has influenced both myself and probably everyone who is somehow involved in electronic music.&quot;

==Re-release==
In 2006, &quot;Some Great Reward&quot; was re-released with a bonus DVD. The CD was remastered and was released on a CD/SACD hybrid. The bonus DVD includes the B-sides &quot;In Your Memory&quot; and &quot;(Set Me Free) Remotivate Me&quot; in addition to a remix of &quot;Somebody&quot; and several live versions of some of the songs from the album. The DVD also includes a documentary on the making of the album.

The remastered album was released on vinyl in March 2007.

<doc id="925460" wikidata="Q73415" url="?curid=925460" title="Ludwig von Falkenhausen">
<text>Ludwig Alexander Friedrich August Philipp Freiherr von Falkenhausen (13 September 1844 – 4 May 1936) was a German officer most notable for his activities during World War I.

==Before World War I==
Falkenhausen was born in Guben. His parents were the Prussian Lieutenant-General D. Alexander von Falkenhausen (1821–1889) and his wife Catherine née Rouanet (1825–1907). Falkenhausen first attended a private school in Berlin and then, from May 1856, was a Cadet in Potsdam at the age of 11. In 1859, he moved to the main military academy in Berlin. 

On 6 May 1862, he was transferred to the 1st Foot Guards as a 2nd Lieutenant. Later, he was regimental adjutant of the combined Guards Reserve Infantry Regiment. At this position, Falkenhausen participated in both Second Schleswig War and 1866 campaign with the main army. Between October 1868 and May 1869, he served with the Guards Field Artillery as regimental adjutant.

In the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), he participated in the battles of Gravelotte-St.Privat, Beaumont &amp; Sedan and at the Siege of Paris. At the end of 1870, he was released from the position as regimental adjutant, and, from July 1871, he served as adjutant of the 28th Division in Karlsruhe.

In subsequent years, he was transferred several times: from the 40th Fusiliers to the Army General Staff, then to the General Staff of the 16th Division in Trier and the General Staff of the VIII Army Corps (Koblenz). In 1885, he was transferred as commander of the First Battalion (Cologne) in the 65th Infantry.

In March 1887, Falkenhausen was Chief of Staff of the Guards Corps (Berlin). In June 1890, he commanded the Queen Augusta Garde-Grenadier Regiment Nr 4 (Koblenz). Two years later, he led the 29th Infantry Brigade (Cologne) and 1893 was chief quartermaster of the Chief of General Staff of the Army. Between 1893 and 1895, he was also a member of the Study Commission of the Military Academy.

After working at the War Department, in January 1895 he became director of the General War Department in the Ministry of War. In February 1895, he was appointed representative in the Bundesrat. 

In January 1897, he became commander of the 2nd Guards Infantry Division (Berlin), and then, in 1899, he became the commanding general of the XIII (Royal Württemberg) Corps. In March 1902, he retired but kept busy with military science studies.

==World War I==
Upon mobilization in August 1914, Falkenhausen became commanding general of the Ersatz Corps of the 6th Army. As commander of Armee-Abteilung Falkenhausen, he commanded the German troops during the battles for the 1914/15 Delmer back and in the trench warfare in Lorraine (1915-1916).

He was highly successful during the first half of World War I and was awarded the Pour le Mérite on 23 August 1915, with oak leaves following on 15 April 1916.

After having commanded the coastal defenses near Hamburg (April–September 1916), on 28 September 1916 Falkenhausen was given command of the 6th Army at the Battle of Arras in April 1917. He failed to deploy correctly the newly developed defence in depth to counter new British and Dominion tactics and was removed from field command by General Erich Ludendorff.

Thereafter, he succeeded Moritz von Bissing and served as governor-general of the General Governorate of Belgium during the German occupation, from May 1917 until November 1918. In early 1918, &quot;The Times&quot; published an article – entitled &quot;Falkenhausen&#x27;s reign of terror&quot; – describing 170 military executions of Belgian civilians that had taken place since he had been appointed governor.

==Death==
Generaloberst a. D. Freiherr von Falkenhausen died on 4 May 1936 in Görlitz, Nazi Germany and was ceremoniously buried at the Invalidenfriedhof in Berlin.

==Family==
During the Second World War, his nephew Alexander von Falkenhausen served as military governor of Belgium (22 May 1940 – 15 July 1944).

<doc id="925465" wikidata="Q7371623" url="?curid=925465" title="Routing in the PSTN">
<text>Routing in the PSTN is the process of forwarding telephone calls between the constituent telephone networks that comprise the public switched telephone network (PSTN).

Telephone calls are routed across a network of potentially many switching systems, often owned by different telephone carriers. Switching systems are connected with trunks. Each switch may have many neighbors. Neighboring switches owned by different operators are connected at interconnect points.

The PSTN is a network that uses destination routing to direct calls from origin to the recipient. It is not a full mesh network with the nodes of every operator directly connected to those of every other, which would be impractical and inefficient. Therefore, calls may be routed through intermediate operator networks before they reach their final destination. Efficient least-cost routing is an important procedure in PSTN routing.

== Call routing ==

Each time a call is placed for routing, the destination number (also known as the called party) is entered by the calling party into their terminal. The destination number generally has two parts, an area code which generally identifies the geographical location of the destination telephone, and a telephone number unique within that area code that determines the specific destination terminal. The telephone number may be subdivided into a prefix that may identify a more specific geographic location or a telephone exchange, and the rest of the number. For example, in the number (301) 555-1212, 301 is the area code and 555 is the prefix. (The area code is sometimes known as an &quot;NPA,&quot; and the area-code and prefix combination is known as an &quot;NPA-NXX.&quot;) In the United States, prior to 2021, in some locations, if the call was between two terminals in the same local area (or, two terminals on the same telephone exchange), then the area code could be omitted. With the introduction in October, 2021 of the national suicide hotline number 988, in most cases, the ability to dial local numbers without the area code was eliminated, and the area code is required for a call to a regular phone number to complete.

When a call is received by an exchange, there are two treatments that may be applied:
* Either the destination terminal is directly connected to that exchange, in which case the call is placed down that connection and the destination terminal rings.
* Or the call must be placed to one of the neighboring exchanges through a connecting trunk for onward routing.

Each exchange in the chain uses pre-computed routing tables to determine which connected exchange the onward call should be routed to. There may be several alternative routes to any given destination, and the exchange can select dynamically between these in the event of link failure or congestion.

The routing tables are generated centrally based on the known topology of the network, the numbering plan, and analysis of traffic data. These are then downloaded to each exchange in the telephone operator&#x27;s network. Because of the hierarchical nature of the numbering plan, and its geographical basis, most calls between telephone numbers on the same network can be routed based on their area code and prefix using these routing tables.

Some calls, however, cannot be routed on the basis of prefix alone, for example non-geographic numbers such as toll-free or freephone calling. In these cases the Intelligent Network is used to route the call instead of using the pre-computed routing tables.

In determining routing plans, special attention is paid to ensure that two routes do not mutually overflow to each other, otherwise congestion will cause a destination to be completely blocked.

According to Braess&#x27;s paradox, the addition of a new, shorter, and lower cost route can lead to an increase in overall congestion.

== Hybrid routing ==
Hybrid routing uses numbering plans and routing tables to permit the colocation, in the same area code, of switches using a deterministic routing scheme with switches using a non-deterministic routing scheme, such as flood search routing. Routing tables are constructed with no duplicate numbers, so that direct distance dialing service can be provided to all network subscribers. This may require the use of ten-digit telephone numbers.

== Trunk reservation ==
When congestion causes many calls to use indirect alternative routes that pass through more exchanges than a direct route, the overall capacity of the network is reduced since each of these calls occupies several inter-exchange trunks. Trunk reservation reduces this effect by reserving a fraction of the capacity of each trunk for directly routed calls.

==Dynamic alternative routing==
Dynamic alternative routing (DAR) is a method of decentralized dynamic routing of telephone calls that uses only a limited amount of local information, which consists of trunk reservation thresholds, or simply knowing the collection of outgoing trunks from the exchange.

A 1989 US patent by British Telecommunications describes dynamic alternative routing as:A call between two nodes interconnected by a direct link is first offered to the direct route, and if that is blocked it is offered to a currently nominated two-link alternative route between the two nodes. If that route is busy, the call is lost, and a randomly chosen two-link route is assigned to be the new current nominated alternative route.Thus the chosen route varies to take changing traffic patterns and demands into account. The technique was the subject of Richard Gibbens&#x27; doctoral thesis at Cambridge University under Frank Kelly, in collaboration with BT Research, and a British patent was granted in 1985. DAR was implemented in British Telecom&#x27;s national network in 1996.

<doc id="925471" wikidata="Q16896359" url="?curid=925471" title="The Palisades (Washington, D.C.)">
<text>The Palisades, or simply Palisades, is a neighborhood in Washington, D.C., along the Potomac River, running roughly from the edge of the Georgetown University campus (at Foxhall Road) to the D.C.-Maryland boundary (near Dalecarlia Treatment Plant).

MacArthur Boulevard (once called Conduit Road) is the main thoroughfare. The Palisades also includes the sub-neighborhood of Potomac Heights, which is bounded by MacArthur, Loughboro Road at the north end, Arizona Avenue at the south end, and the Potomac River.

==History==
In 1792, boundary stone NW4 was placed at what is now the far northwestern edge of this neighborhood to mark the D.C.-Maryland line.

In 1893, this subdivision was laid out by the Palisades Improvement Company. Two years later, streetcar service arrived: the Washington and Great Falls Electric Railway connected the neighborhood to Georgetown and Glen Echo.

The International Athletic Park and Amusement Company secured a large block of the Palisades and constructed a Bicycle Track and General Amusement Park, which opened on Decoration Day in 1896.

In June 1909, the Potomac Heights Land Co. (based in North Carolina) acquired previously known as the Athletic Park tract at the reported cost of $1000 an acre. The tract extends parallel with and between Conduit Road and the Potomac. It is divided by the Washington Railway and Electric Company, which ran from Georgetown to Glen Echo for a 5 cent fare. There were 800 lots at $450–$500 per lot and no home was to be erected at less than $2500.

The Palisades is part of Advisory Neighborhood Commission 3D in Ward 3, the far northwest corner of the Northwest Quadrant just north of Georgetown. The current Palisades Community Association (PCA) was started as the Conduit Road Citizens Association in 1916.
The Palisades is one of the lesser-known neighborhoods in Washington, with a mixture of detached houses, townhouses and apartments. The homes along the bluff on Potomac Avenue offer a broad view of the Potomac River and the Virginia riverfront, with often impressive sunset views.

Since 1928, the Palisades has been served by the Francis Scott Key Elementary School, which is part of the DC Public Schools. Extensive capital improvement of Key Elementary was completed in fall 2003. The renovated and expanded school currently enrolls 285 students and will gradually increase to approximately 300. 

The current Palisades Neighborhood Library opened in 1964 and was renovated in 2018.

Battery Kemble was at an elevation on Ridge Road (now Nebraska Avenue). The battery held two 100-pounder Parrott rifles, placed to sweep Chain Bridge and Virginia beyond. The site is located within Battery Kemble Park, bounded by Chain Bridge Road, MacArthur Boulevard, 49th Street, and Nebraska Avenue, NW.

Fletcher&#x27;s Cove is on the Potomac River and the C &amp; O Canal National Historical Park, between Chain and Key Bridges. Fletcher&#x27;s has been in this location since the 1850s and is renowned as a superb fishing and recreational area. The nearby Abner Cloud House is the oldest building on the canal, dating back to 1802. After 145 years of business, the fourth generation of Fletchers retired in 2004 and Guest Services Incorporated, a National Park Service concessionaire, assumed responsibility for the operation of the concessions. The area surrounding the boat house was then officially named Fletcher&#x27;s Cove, though most people still call it Fletcher&#x27;s Boat House.

Other notable landmarks making the Palisades unique are the old Conduit Road Schoolhouse on MacArthur Boulevard, Palisades Community Church (1923), The Lab School of Washington (1967) (formerly the Florence Crittenton Home for Unwed Mothers), the German Embassy, St. David&#x27;s Episcopal Church (1940), Sibley Hospital (1961) and Gen. Montgomery C. Meig&#x27;s Washington Aqueduct / Dalecarlia Filtration / Water Treatment Plant (1853).

Remnants are everywhere of the old Capitol Transit #20 trolley (Union Station to Cabin John) that was a very popular ride through the Palisades out to the Glen Echo Amusement Park (1898–1968). In addition, the Georgetown Branch of the B &amp; O railroad once worked its way through The Palisades, the most notable landmark being the steel trestle bridge over Arizona Ave. Since the Georgetown Branch&#x27;s abandonment in 1985, it has been part of the Capital Crescent Trail.

The Palisades Firehouse (Engine Company 29), at 4811 MacArthur Blvd. NW, built in 1925 is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was designed by architect Albert L. Harris in Colonial Revival style.

Also National Register-listed are:
*Conduit Road Schoolhouse
*Dr. Franklin E. Kameny House, ordinary-looking home of gay rights leader
*Northwest No. 4 Boundary Marker of the Original District of Columbia
*Washington Aqueduct.

Designed by John J. Zink, the MacArthur Theater, originally a single 1,000 seater that was tri-plexed in 1982, was in use from December 1946 through March 1997.

On September 11, 1936, at a cost of $40,000, the Palisades Playground and field house was dedicated at its current Sherier and Edmunds Place location.

A high point of the year for many in the neighborhood is the annual July 4 parade, featuring local bands, fire engines and children on highly decorated tricycles and bicycles.

==Education==
District of Columbia Public Schools operates public schools. Mann Elementary School, Key Elementary School, Hardy Middle School, and Jackson-Reed High School serve Palisades.

Private schools in Palisades include Our Lady of Victory Catholic School, the Lab School, the lower and middle divisions of Georgetown Day School, the River School, and St. Patrick&#x27;s Episcopal Day School.

District of Columbia Public Library operates the Palisades Neighborhood Library.

<text>Takushoku University (拓殖 大学; &quot;Takushoku Daigaku&quot;, abbreviated as 拓大 &quot;Takudai&quot;) is a private university in Tokyo, Japan. It was founded in 1900 by Prince (title for a Duke at that time) Taro Katsura (1848–1913). It has two campuses: the main campus in the Bunkyō Ward and a satellite campus in Hachiōji. Takushoku University has five faculties: Commerce, Political Science and Economics, Foreign Languages, International Studies, and Engineering.

Takushoku University is a leading university of security studies in Japan. The last chancellor was a former Minister of Defense, Satoshi Morimoto. Some chancellors such as Taro Katsura and Yasuhiro Nakasone were appointed to the prime minister.

==History==
Originally, Takushoku University was named the Taiwan Association School, and was founded to produce graduates to contribute to the development of Taiwan. In 1907, it was renamed the Oriental Association Vocational School. In 1918, it adopted its present name of Takushoku University. Literally, &quot;Takushoku&quot; means &quot;development and industrialization&quot; as well as &quot;colonization&quot;, because Japan had overseas colonies like Taiwan, South Sakhalin, and Korea and was entrusted with South Pacific Islands to industrialize at that time.

Takashoku University as a unique colonial institute made itself one of the best private universities in Japan after Imperial Universities such as Tokyo University till the end of World War II. It kept to be a peace-loving patriot, during the war by appointing General Kazushige Ugaki as its Chancellor, who was the enemy of Imperial Way Faction(military expansionist), and then Mr. Hiroshi Shimomura, who was the president of Cabinet Intelligence Bureau leading the Hirohito surrender broadcast. An affiliated judo master Tatsukuma Ushijima and his disciple Masahiko Kimura of the university even planned to assassinate the prime and military minister Hideki Tojo in 1941. 
After the war, Japan gave up its whole colonies, the university changed its name to Kōryō University (紅陵大学; &quot;Kōryō Daigaku&quot;) and was led by Torajiro Takagaki, the president of Japan association of monetary economics. Then it reverted to its traditional name in 1952. Many graduates went to Brazil, some to Indonesia and other South Asian countries in the 1960s and 70s.
In the 1970s and 80s it enhanced its campus towards Hachioji and established two more faculties. In 2001 it celebrated its 100-year anniversary in presence of Emperor Akihito. It opened another faculty for world development and international security in Hachioji. It finds realizing SDGs (sustainable development goals) as its mission in the 21st century.

<doc id="925473" wikidata="Q3439758" url="?curid=925473" title="Sidwell Friends School">
<text>Sidwell Friends School is a Quaker school located in Bethesda, Maryland, and Washington, D.C., offering pre-kindergarten through high school classes. Founded in 1883 by Thomas W. Sidwell, its motto is &quot;&quot; (), alluding to the Quaker concept of inner light.

The school is private, but its admissions process is merit-based. As documented on the school&#x27;s website, it gives preference in admissions decisions to members of the Religious Society of Friends but otherwise does not discriminate on the basis of religion. Sidwell &quot;accepts only 7 percent of its applicants.&quot; The school accepts vouchers under the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program.

The school has educated children of notable politicians, including those of several presidents. President Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s son Archibald, President Richard Nixon&#x27;s daughters Tricia and Julie, President Bill Clinton&#x27;s daughter Chelsea Clinton, President Barack Obama&#x27;s daughters Sasha and Malia, President Joe Biden&#x27;s grandchildren when he was Vice President and Vice President Al Gore&#x27;s son, Albert Gore III, graduated from Sidwell Friends.

== History ==
===19th century===
Thomas Sidwell started a &quot;Friends&#x27; Select School&quot; in 1883 on I Street in downtown Washington, four blocks from the White House. It opened with just eleven students.

===20th century===
In 1911, Sidwell began buying property between Wisconsin Avenue and 37th St. Initially, the new property was used for athletic fields—and, with the central campus&#x27;s downtown location—meant students had to shuttle between the two sites by streetcar. However, in 1923, Sidwell built a building for school dances and other social gatherings on what came to be known as the Wisconsin Avenue campus.

In 1925, the school added a kindergarten, making it the first K–12 school in Washington, D.C. In 1934, the name of the school was changed to &quot;Sidwell and Friends School,&quot; and began its gradual re-location to the Wisconsin Avenue building. By 1938, the transition to the new building had been completed, and the I Street property was sold.

In 1957, the school adopted a formal dress code policy, with requirements and recommendations for boys and girls in Kindergarten, Lower School, Middle School, and Upper School. The dress code continued to evolve to include further restrictions on hair length, skirt length, and types of shoes in the 1960s, but began to relax by 1969. Following student proposals and negotiations, the dress code was modified in the early 1970s and by 1975 permitted jeans to be worn by students. The dress code continued to evolve in the 1980s and by 2000 included restrictions on exposed midriffs and visible underwear. In 2016, students led a change to the dress code to ban clothing with the Washington Redskins (currently the Commanders) football team name and logo.

Previously, all grade levels were in Washington, D.C. In 1963, the elementary school moved to the former Longfellow School for Boys, purchased by Sidwell Friends.

Sidwell became racially integrated in 1964. In the decades following integration, problems faced by black students lead to the creation of two parent groups outside the school, which sought to alleviate covert prejudice.

===21st century===
In 2009, Thomas B. Farquhar became the Head of School after the retirement of Bruce Stewart. Following the 2013-2014 school year, Farquhar was removed from his position as the Head of School.

In 2018, Sidwell, along with seven other Washington metropolitan area private schools, announced that they would be eliminating AP courses, citing the declining impact on one&#x27;s college acceptance chances that AP courses were having, and a want to diversify their class offerings. This sparked the Department of Justice to launch an antitrust investigation into the schools, which concluded in 2021 after the DOJ stated that &quot;in light of the burden on the Schools associated with the ongoing pandemic, the division will not bring an enforcement action against the Schools&quot;.

In April 2020, the school received $5.2 million in federally backed small business loans as part of the Paycheck Protection Program. The school received scrutiny over this loan, which was meant to protect small and private businesses. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin tweeted that the schools should return the money, but the school stated they were keeping it, despite having a $53 million endowment.

, the school plans to move elementary grades back to Washington, D.C. following its purchase of the former Washington, D.C. school in 2017 for campus expansion purposes.

== Academics ==
In 2005, Sidwell&#x27;s AP English Exam scores were the highest in the nation for all medium-sized schools (300–799 students in grades 10–12) offering the AP English exam. 

All students must acquire at least 20 credits before graduating. Students are required to take four years of English, three years of mathematics, three years of history, two years of one foreign language, two years of science, and two years of art. In addition to this, all freshmen must take a full year Ninth Grade Studies course that involves a service project. Tenth and eleventh graders must also take courses corresponding to their grade level.

Sidwell is a member school of School Year Abroad.

== Student safety ==
In 2016, the school revised its policy on sexual misconduct after reports that a teen had been raped by her ex-boyfriend on the school&#x27;s campus. No charges were filed against the teen, and the school installed more security cameras to deter future assaults. Despite the measures, a year later another teenage female student reported being raped on the campus grounds by a fellow student.

Former Sidwell psychologist and sex ed teacher James Huntington was the target of a 2013 lawsuit for his affair with the parent of a student he was counseling. The case exposed teachers that had made advances towards students.

In 2017, the school fired a middle school music teacher, Michael Henderson, who had been accused of having inappropriate contact with a 14-year-old girl at a previous school. In 1996, the parents of Sara Lawson, a student at the Fountain Valley High School, filed a police report that detailed multiple incidents of &quot;unwanted touching and kissing&quot; between her and Henderson while she was 14. She later stated that Henderson once invited her over to his house and made her a drink that caused her to be incapacitated for the rest of the night. In a letter Sidwell&#x27;s Head of School Bryan Garman sent to parents, he stated that &quot;A former administrator ... was aware that Michael’s departure from his previous employer had been precipitated by his inappropriate conduct, but had no knowledge of the severity of the allegations as they now stand.&quot;

== Athletics ==
Sidwell&#x27;s athletic teams are known as the Quakers; their colors are maroon and gray. The Quakers compete in the Mid-Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAC) for boys&#x27; sports (after previously competing in the Interstate Athletic Conference (IAC) until 1999) and the Independent School League (ISL) for girls&#x27; sports. Sidwell offers teams in volleyball, golf, boys and girls cross country, football, field hockey, girls and boys soccer, boys and girls basketball, boys and girls swimming and diving, wrestling, boys and girls tennis, baseball, boys and girls lacrosse, boys and girls track, ultimate frisbee, crew, movement performance and choreography, and softball.

===Basketball===
The women&#x27;s basketball is consistently a top program in the DMV area. The Quakers completed an undefeated season from 2021 to 2022 and were ranked the #1 best girls&#x27; basketball team in the nation by recruiting website MaxPreps as well as by ESPN. In the 2022–2023 season, the team won their second straight DCSAA state championship in a 68–49 win against St. Johns. Led by Coach Tamika Dudley and Duke commit Jadyn Donovan, the consensus #3 recruit in the class of 2023, the team was once again ranked as the top team in the nation by various recruiting websites and sports journalism pages after compiling a 28–3 record.

The men&#x27;s team is another program in the DMV area, finishing the 2022–2023 season with a state championship, two conference championships (regular season and tournament) and 27–4 record.

== Campuses ==

The Middle and Upper School campus is located at 3825 Wisconsin Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C., 20016-2907
* Wisconsin Avenue campus in the North Cleveland Park section of Northwest Washington
* Earl G. Harrison Jr. Upper School Building
* Middle School building with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum Certification, designed by architect KieranTimberlake Associates and landscape design by Andropogon Associates. The wood-clad building was designed around a sustainable use of water and energy, exemplified by a constructed wetland in the center of the campus, with many species of plants, as well as turtles and fish, part of a wastewater recycling system designed by Biohabitats. On the interior, the building uses thermal chimneys and louvers that admit diffuse light to limit the need for artificial light and thermal control. Lastly, the building contains a centralized mechanical plant that uses less energy than normal, much of which is produced by photovoltaic banks on the roof. The materials used and the environmental technology are referenced architecturally and made accessible to students, either physically, or by explanatory signs, as an educational feature.
* Kogod Center for the Arts
* Richard Walter Goldman Memorial Library
* Zartman House (administration building)
* Sensner Building (Fox Den Cafe and school store)
* Wannan and Kenworthy Gymnasiums
* Three athletic fields, five tennis courts, and two tracks (one 2-lane indoor track indoor for bad weather and an outdoor 6-lane track for competitions).
* Parking facility with faculty, student, guest and alumni parking (2 floors, 200+ parking spaces), as well as offices for security, IT and maintenance

The Lower School campus can be found at 5100 Edgemoor Lane, Bethesda, Montgomery County, Maryland, 20814-2306

<doc id="925481" wikidata="Q703958" url="?curid=925481" title="Yoshio Kodama">
<text>was a Japanese right-wing ultranationalist, Imperial Japanese Navy rear admiral and a prominent figure in the rise of organized crime in Japan. The most famous &quot;kuromaku&quot;, or behind-the-scenes power broker, of the 20th century, he was active in Japan&#x27;s political arena and criminal underworld from the 1930s to the 1970s, and became enormously wealthy through his involvement in smuggling operations.

==Early life==

Yoshio Kodama was born on February 18, 1911, in Nihonmatsu, Fukushima, Japan, to a family formerly of samurai status. Kodama was the fifth son of a bankrupt Nihonmatsu businessman. Due to his family&#x27;s straitened circumstances, in 1920, Kodama was sent to live with a married older sister in Korea and lived there for three years. He was treated badly, suffered from isolation and had to work in a steel mill.

== Early right-wing activism==
Returning to Japan as a teenager, Kodama joined a variety of right-wing nationalist groups. At the end of the 1920s he joined the secret society Gen&#x27;yōsha. In 1929, he joined Bin Akao&#x27;s &quot;National Foundation Society&quot; (建国会, &quot;Kenkokukai&quot;). In 1929, during a parade, he tried to give Emperor Hirohito a self-written appeal for increased patriotism. However, he was intercepted by the security forces and arrested for his role in the &quot;Direct Appeal to the Emperor Incident&quot; (天皇直訴事件, &quot;Tennō Jikiso Jiken&quot;). He was imprisoned for six months. During this time in prison, he wrote his first book, a primer for Japanese nationalists. After his release from prison, he joined Tatsuo Tsukui&#x27;s Radical Patriotic Party (急進愛国党, &quot;Kyūshin Aikokutō&quot;). Tōyama Mitsuru from the Gen&#x27;yōsha (Dark Ocean Society), a secret society founded in the late 19th century that first grouped extreme rightists and yakuza together, sent him to Manchuria. There he was involved in the suppression of the anti-Japanese resistance working under the chief of Japanese military intelligence in the region, Colonel Kenji Doihara. A few months later, Kodama returned to Japan. In 1931, Kodama was imprisoned again for his role in the &quot;Diet Pamphlet Distribution Case&quot; (国会ビラ撒き事件, &quot;Kokkai Biramaki Jiken&quot;). He was released in 1932.

In 1933, Kodama formed his own ultranationalist group called the Independent Youth Society (独立青年社, &quot;Dokuritsu Seinensha&quot;), which planned to assassinate various Japanese politicians. Its main activity was opium export from Japan to Korea and Manchuria to break the resistance of the local population against the Japanese rule.
His group, in collaboration with the group Tenkōkai (天行会, &quot;Society for Heavenly Action&quot;) was responsible for the murder of three Japanese politicians who advocated the peaceful coexistence of Japan, Korea and China. In 1934, Kodama was involved in the planning of an assassination attempt on Prime Minister Saitō Makoto. Kodama&#x27;s plot was uncovered, the attack was prevented by the Japanese police and Kodama was arrested. He served a prison term of three and half years. He was released from Fuchū prison at the instigation of Doihara, by this time promoted to major general, just prior to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in April 1937.

== Second Sino-Japanese War and the Pacific War ==
In 1937, the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out following a clash between Japanese and Chinese troops in the Marco Polo Bridge incident, which precipitated a full-scale invasion of China proper by Japanese forces. After the conquest of Shanghai by Japanese troops, Kodama was summoned there by his old mentor Doihara. Among other things, he served in 1939 as a bodyguard for the Chinese collaborator Wang Jingwei. During his work he met the vice admiral and later founder of the Kamikaze units Takijirō Ōnishi, with whom he became friends.

From 1939 to 1941 he traveled through China as a Japanese spy and built up a network that included various triads collaborating with the Japanese. Like other Japanese secret service agents, he founded his own &quot;Kodama Organization&quot; (&quot;Kodama Kikan&quot;), which, thanks to his relationship with Admiral Ōnishi, had an exclusive contract as a purchasing agent in China for the aviation forces of the Imperial Japanese Navy.

With these resources, Kodama was able to use what he described as &quot;self-sacrificing youth&quot; to engage in large-scale plunder in Manchuria and China and sell the stolen goods at a high profit in Japan. He is also said to have distributed opium and narcotics. Kodama publicly regarded this activity as purely idealistic and patriotic. By 1945, Kodama had become one of the richest men in Asia with assets equivalent to $175 million US dollars.

Towards the end of the Pacific War, Kodama was promoted to Rear Admiral in the Imperial Japanese Navy.

== Post-War detention in Sugamo Prison ==
At the end of World War II, the defeat of Japan initially represented an enormous setback for Kodama. Shortly after the announcement of the unconditional surrender of Japan on August 15, 1945, he witnessed the ritual suicide of Admiral Ōnishi, but was subsequently unable to bring himself to commit seppuku. A little later he acted as an advisor to the Japanese interim government of Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni. Since Kodama feared the confiscation of his property by the US occupation authorities, he gave parts of it to the yakuza chief Karoku Tsuji. Other possessions were kept on the grounds of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo.

In March 1946, Kodama was arrested by the United States as a suspected Class A war criminal. He was held in Sugamo Prison with Ryoichi Sasakawa, where the two formed a long friendship. Kodama also formed a close relationship with fellow suspected Class-A war criminal (and future prime minister) Nobusuke Kishi. Since he had a lot of time, Kodama was able to keep himself up to date on current events and far-reaching political changes in East Asia in all available daily newspapers. He realized that the new democratic forces in Japan were weak, observing that &quot;in the midst of all this rapid change, there is one thing which is lagging behind. This is parliamentary power.&quot; While imprisoned, Kodama wrote &quot;Sugamo Diary&quot; (a chronicle of his experience in prison) and &quot;I Was Defeated&quot; (an autobiographical work).

Like many other alleged Japanese war criminals, Kodama was recruited by the US G-2 (Intelligence) under Charles A. Willoughby while in custody. In 1948, the US intelligence community was able to drop all charges against him on the condition that he would support all anti-communist activities of the G-2 CIC division in Asia. On December 24, 1948, he left Sugamo Prison as a free man and was never imprisoned again for the rest of his life. Kodama spent a total of six and a half years of his life in prisons. Kodama, being a right-wing ultranationalist, eagerly fulfilled his end of the bargain, using his fortune and network of contacts to quell labor disputes, root out Communist sympathizers and otherwise fight socialist activities in Japan. In 1949, the CIA paid him to smuggle a shipment of tungsten out of China. The shipment never arrived but Kodama kept his money.

== Political fixer==

In 1949 Kodama led the Meiraki-gumi gang against labor unions at the Hokutan coal mine. He began to use the fortune he had accumulated in China and subsequently hidden, which supposedly amounted to 70 million yen (not including the platinum and diamonds he spirited away), to covertly influence electoral politics in postwar Japan.

In 1955, Kodama&#x27;s Sugamo Prison acquaintance Nobusuke Kishi, with the covert backing of the CIA, engineered the formation of the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) via the merger of the Liberal Party and the Democratic Party. In the 1950s and 1960s, the CIA spent millions to support the LDP, for intelligence gathering and to make Japan a bulwark against communism in Asia. Using his preexisting connections to the CIA, Kodama served as a political fixer (&quot;kuromaku&quot;) who secretly funneled funds to conservatives.

In his role as fixer, conservative politicians turned to Kodama if they had problems. An example of his role as fixer was the planned state visit by US President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1960, in connection with the revision of U.S.-Japan Security Treaty (known as &quot;Anpo&quot; in Japanese), intended to cement the U.S.-Japan alliance. In an effort to prevent the ratification of the treaty and prevent Eisenhower&#x27;s visit, a coalition of left-leaning opposition groups and civic organizations carried out the massive 1960 Anpo Protests. As the protests dramatically escalated in June 1960, now-Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi asked his old friend Kodama to organize right-wing thugs and yakuza gangsters as a private police force to secure the streets for Eisenhower&#x27;s visit. Kodama obliged, using his right-wing connections to prepare a &quot;Welcoming Ike to Japan Mobilization Plan&quot; which he claimed would be able to put nearly 150,000 young rightists on the streets in order to &quot;protect&quot; President Eisenhower from left-wing protesters. Kodama&#x27;s detailed plan promised to mobilize exactly 146,879 men, whereas Japan&#x27;s National Police Agency later estimated that he could realistically mobilize at most 120,506. As a result, around 28,000 yakuza from different gangs organized a security service on their own and in cooperation with the police. Right-wing groups also staged counter-protests in favor of the Treaty. However, due to the violent June 15th Incident, in which female university student Michiko Kanba was killed, Kishi was forced to cancel Eisenhower&#x27;s visit and Kodama&#x27;s force was not needed.

In response to the Anpo protests, Kodama and other right-wing leaders established the , an umbrella organization of 80 right-wing groups and yakuza groups. Zen&#x27;ai Kaigi carried out a variety of counter-protest activities in support of the conservative Kishi government, and by the end of the protests had grown to include more than 100 organizations. In this way, the 1960 Anpo protests helped cement the interlocking relationships between right-wing nationalists, yakuza gangsters, and conservative political interests, with Kodama playing a starring role.

In April 1961, Kodama formed his own sub-faction within the Zen&#x27;ai Kaigi called &quot;Seinen Shiso Kenkyukai&quot; (Society for the Study of Youth Ideology), which represented a hard core within the umbrella organization, mainly yakuza. At the end of the 1960s, the &quot;Shiso Kenkyukai&quot; split from Zen&#x27;ai Kaigi . Its members received military training and were used to intimidate unpopular journalists and book authors. One of the victims of this organization was the journalist , whose book entitled &quot;Black Money&quot; was not published after multiple threats.

In 1963, Kodama attempted to form a coalition of Japan&#x27;s organized crime groups. However, Kazuo Taoka withdrew the Yamaguchi-gumi early on in talks, leaving Kodama with a Tokyo-centered group that would become known as the Kanto-kai. The organization was formed of seven yakuza groups (including the Sumiyoshi-kai and Matsuba-kai), with the purpose of fostering relations between the groups and promoting rightist goals. With Kodama unable to smooth over its internal conflicts, the Kanto-kai dissolved in January 1965.

Kodama was able to grow his fortune until the mid-1970s. He owned shares in Hisayuki Machii&#x27;s Ginza nightclub empire, a shipping company, a baseball team, a film studio, and several sports magazines.

Kodama maintained close relations with LDP politicians, such as the yakuza-connected LDP Vice President Banboku Ōno, and his influence did not suffer until he was identified as the key &quot;kuromaku&quot; in the Lockheed Corporation bribery scandal. Kodama had been a paid agent of Lockheed since 1958 and received $U.S.7 million for his help in arranging the TriStar aircraft deal.

== Lockheed scandal and final years ==
In the 1970s, it came to light that Kodama had played a role in the Lockheed L-1011 bribery scandal, which effectively ended his career as a right-wing fixer.

After the Lockheed scandal, disillusioned ultranationalist &quot;Roman Porno&quot; film actor Mitsuyasu Maeno attempted to assassinate Kodama by flying a Piper PA-28 Cherokee plane kamikaze-style into his mansion in Setagaya Ward&#x27;s Todoroki. The attempt failed. Maeno hit the second floor of Kodama&#x27;s mansion and died in the plane crash, but Kodama was unharmed in a different room. He was recovering from a stroke at the time.

In June 1977, charges were brought against Kodama for tax evasion related to the scandal, but the trial was never completed before he died. Kodama died in his sleep of a stroke in Tokyo on January 17, 1984.

==Personal life==
Kodama was married twice. A brief 1935 marriage ended in divorce. In 1940, Kodama married his second wife, Sayoko, with whom he had two children, a son and a daughter. Sayoko died in a car accident in the spring of 1958.

<doc id="925493" wikidata="Q7215097" url="?curid=925493" title="Elections in Australia">
<text>Elections in Australia take place periodically to elect the legislature of the Commonwealth of Australia, as well as for each Australian state and territory and for local government councils. Elections in all jurisdictions follow similar principles, although there are minor variations between them. The elections for the Australian Parliament are held under the federal electoral system, which is uniform throughout the country, and the elections for state and territory Parliaments are held under the electoral system of each state and territory. An election day is always a Saturday, but early voting is allowed in the lead-up to it. 

Part IV of Chapter 1 of the Australian Constitution briefly deals with eligibility for voting and election to the federal Australian Parliament. It does not prescribe how elections should be conducted. Election campaigns and associated political advertisements are subject to some regulation. Public funding of political parties and party registration was introduced in 1983.

Voting for the federal and each state and territory parliament is compulsory for Australian citizens over the age of 18. Voting is almost entirely conducted using paper ballots. The informal vote is not usually significant, but a donkey vote is more common, and may have a deciding impact in marginal seats.

==Parliaments==
Voting for the federal and each state and territory parliament is compulsory for Australian citizens over the age of 18.

===Federal Parliament===

The Australian Parliament consists of two chambers (known as a bicameral Parliament), the House of Representatives (commonly also referred as the lower house) and the Senate (also referred as the upper house). The House of Representatives has 151 members, elected for a maximum term of three years in single-member constituencies (each approximately equal in voters). Elections are conducted by a system of preferential voting (also called alternative voting or instant-runoff voting).

The Senate has 76 senators, elected through a preferential system of proportional representation with a system of single transferable vote, with each state constituting a single constituency normally returning 6 senators every three years and each territory constituting a single constituency returning two senators. Electors in the two territories elect senators for non-fixed terms that are defined by the term of the House of Representatives. State senators normally serve fixed six-year terms, with half of the seats in each State expiring every three years. In the event of a double dissolution, the terms of all the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives seats end immediately.

=== State Parliaments and Territory Legislative Assemblies ===
==== South Australia ====
The Parliament of South Australia is a bicameral legislature. The House of Assembly (lower house) comprises 47 members elected by full preferential voting every 4 years from single member electorates. The Legislative Council (upper house) comprises 22 members elected by proportional representation of single transferable vote every 8 years.

==== Queensland ====
The Parliament of Queensland is unicameral, consisting of the Legislative Assembly of 93 members elected for a 4 year term from single member electorates using full preferential voting.

==== Western Australia ====
The Parliament of Western Australia consists of the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council. The Legislative Assembly has 57 members elected for a four-year term, unless dissolved earlier, from single member electorates using fully preferential voting. The Legislative Council has 37 members elected for a fixed term of 4 years, in a &#x27;whole of state&#x27; electorate using preferential proportional representation.

==Electoral Commissions==

Elections in Australia (Commonwealth, State or Territory) are organised by their respective electoral commissions, as follows:

The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is the federal government agency responsible for organising, conducting and supervising federal elections, by-elections and referendums. The AEC is also responsible for setting electoral boundaries and redistributions, and maintains the Commonwealth electoral roll. State and Territory Electoral Commissions perform an equivalent role for State and Territory elections. The Australian electoral roll is also used by the state and territory Electoral Commissions to conduct State, Territory and local government elections, except Western Australia which maintains its own electoral roll.

==Voter enrolment ==
Enrolment on the electoral roll, known in some other countries as registration, is compulsory for all Australian citizens aged 18 years and over. Residents in Australia who had been enrolled as British subjects on 25 January 1984 continue to be enrolled and vote. (Almost 163,000 voters were recorded as British subjects on the electoral roll in 2009.)

As of 2024, the deadline to enrol or update enrolment information such as address is 7 days after the writ of election is issued.

==Election day==
Each jurisdiction has its own laws and customs as to when elections in the jurisdiction will take place. However, state and territory elections cannot, by federal law, take place within a week before or after a federal election.

Since 1912, federal elections have been held on Saturdays.

Although elections for the House of Representatives have usually corresponded to half-elections of the Senate, the rules which determine when the elections occur differ. Under the Constitution, the House of Representatives lasts no more than three years after it first meets, but may be dissolved earlier. After the House is dissolved or expires, writs for election must be issued within 10 days and the election must be held on a Saturday between 33 and 58 days after the writs have been issued. The next House must meet within 30 days of the writs being returned.

The terms of senators representing the states are of fixed duration (unless Parliament is dissolved in a double dissolution), and elections must occur within a year before the term expires. The terms of senators representing the territories are not fixed, and are tied to the dates of elections for the House of Representatives. Where a House is dissolved early, House and Senate elections may be asynchronous until either the House is again dissolved sufficiently early or a double dissolution occurs.

The Australian Constitution requires that in half-Senate elections the election of State senators must take place within one year before the places become vacant. As the terms of half the senators end on 30 June, the writs for a half-Senate election cannot be issued earlier than the previous 1 July. There is no constitutional requirement for simultaneous elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives, and elections for half the Senate only have taken place in the past. There is a government and electorate preference for Senate elections to take place simultaneously with those of the House of Representatives. Except in the case of a double dissolution, the Senate is not dissolved when elections for the Senate are called and can continue to sit until the term expires. However, it is now a practice for the Senate to be prorogued when the House is dissolved, so that it does not sit during the election period.

By Westminster convention, the decision as to the type of election and date on which an election is to take place is that of the Prime Minister, who advises the Governor-General to set the process in motion by dissolving the House of Representatives (if it has not expired) and then issuing writs for election.

Writs for the election of House of Representatives and territory senators are issued by the Governor-General, while writs for the election of state senators are issued by the respective state governors.
As of 2024, Australia has never held a federal election in January, February or June.
==Voting==



Voting in federal, state and territory elections is compulsory for all persons on the electoral roll. Voting can take place by a person attending in person at any polling place in their State on the election day or in early voting locations, or by applying for and mailing in a postal vote. Votes may apply for postal votes in perpetuity. Absentee voting is also available, but not proxy voting.

At the 2007 federal election there were 7,723 polling places open for voting. In remote areas, hospitals and retirement villages, mobile polling places have been used since the 1980s. The visually impaired can use electronic voting machines.

Voting is almost entirely conducted by paper ballot. If more than one election takes place at the same time (for example, for the House of Representatives and the Senate), separate ballot papers are used, green for House and white for Senate. These are usually of different colours and are deposited into separate boxes.

Upper house polls used to require every square to be numbered, a burden if there are over 200 squares. This has been simplified by the introduction of &quot;Above the line&quot; and &quot;below the line&quot; voting.

How-to-vote cards are usually handed out at polling places by party volunteers. They suggest how a party supporter might vote for other candidates or parties. Electors now routinely receive how-to-vote materials through the mail or by other means.

In practice, privacy arrangements allow informal and protest votes to take place. At the 2010 federal election more than 1.5 million people did not vote or voted incorrectly. Academic Brian Costar from Swinburne University claims the rate of donkey votes in Australia is around 2% of all votes, but the figure is hard to determine accurately.

Most polling places are schools, community halls or churches. Supporters of these places very commonly take advantage of the large number of visitors undertaking fund raising activity, often including raffles, cake stalls and sales of so-called democracy sausages.
==Parties==
Political parties have certain benefits in Australia&#x27;s electoral system, including public funding. Political parties must register with the electoral commission in the jurisdiction in which it is proposing to field or endorse candidates. To be eligible for federal registration a party must have at least one member in the Australian Parliament or 1,500 members, and independent candidates are required to provide 50 signatures to be eligible to stand. An unsuccessful challenge to the 500 member requirement was heard by the High Court of Australia in 2004. Other Australian jurisdictions require political parties to have a minimum number of members. For example, New South Wales requires at least 750 members while the ACT and the Northern Territory require 100 members. There are deadlines for registration of a political party.

Australia has a &quot;de facto&quot; two-party system, with the Australian Labor Party and the Coalition of the Liberal Party of Australia, National Party of Australia, the Liberal National Party and Country Liberal Party dominating Parliamentary elections. It is very difficult for other parties to win representation in the House, let alone form the government, though they may have a strong influence if they hold the &quot;balance of power&quot;. However, minor parties and independent candidates have been elected to the Senate by virtue of its more favourable voting system. In recent decades, several parties besides the ALP and the Coalition have secured significant representation in the Senate, notably the DLP (1955–1974); the Australian Democrats (1977–2007); and the Australian Greens and its predecessors (1990–present). Independent and other individual senators have also exercised influence, e.g., Brian Harradine (1975–2005), Family First&#x27;s Steve Fielding (2005–2011), and Nick Xenophon (2008–2017); and, variously from 1984, representatives of the Nuclear Disarmament Party and One Nation.

Many voters use elections to reaffirm their party allegiance. Party affiliation has declined in recent decades. Voters who voted for the same party each election made up 72% of the electorate in 1967. This figure had declined to 45% by 2007. Minor parties have played a greater role in the politics of Australia since proportional representation was progressively introduced.

Elections in Australia are seen by parties as a chance to develop and refine policies. Rather than a procedure where the best policies win the day, elections are contests where parties fight for power. Elections are not part of the process in which specific decisions on policy are made. Control of policy and platforms are wholly determined within the party.

Candidate selection, in Australia typically called preselection, is a significant factor in the democratic process in Australia because the majority of voters base their decision at election time on the party rather than the candidate. In Australia the decision of who may be a candidate is decided by the party in any manner they choose. It can range from a postal vote to the whole party membership through to a decision made by a small select committee.

===Election campaigns===
Election campaigns typically involve a televised policy launch, which, despite the name, have increasingly been held towards the end of the campaign. In the 2013 federal election campaign, for example, the Liberal/National and Labor launches were held only 13 days and 6 days respectively prior to election day. From the 1980s onwards direct mailing was seen as a successful way to market, particularly in marginal seats. Major political parties in Australia use databases created from census data, voting records and their own canvassing to shape their direct mail. Quantitative surveys of samples from the wide population as well as focus groups are used by the parties for market research during election campaigns.

The &quot;Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918&quot; stipulates that political advertisements display the name and address of the individual authorising them. The &quot;Broadcasting Services Act 1922&quot; bans the broadcast of advertisements in the three days prior to an election. A ban on broadcast election advertising was imposed under the &quot;Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act 1991&quot; but was overturned by the High Court of Australia in 1992. Party registration rules have become stricter, especially in New South Wales.

Television is the preferred medium for campaign news in Australia. At the 2004 federal election more than three-quarters of money spent on advertising was television based.

Incumbent candidates and government have significant benefits compared to non-incumbents. These include substantial allowances and access to staff whose travel is covered by parliamentary allowances.

The Australian Election Study coordinated by the Australian National University was introduced in 1987. The series of surveys are conducted post election and provide a unique take on political behaviour during election campaigns.

==Public funding==

Australia&#x27;s first partial public election funding was introduced in 1981 by the then Premier of New South Wales Neville Wran. The Commonwealth Electoral Legislation Amendment Act 1983 brought forward by the Hawke government introduced public election funding and the requirement that all minor donations to parties be disclosed. Amendments to legislation were needed due to the changing nature of election campaigns in the late 1960s and 1970s. Opinion polling, widespread advertising and the rise of the hired campaign professionals meant campaigning had become far more expensive than in previous decades.

Public funding is the preferred means to cover costs rather than corporate donations. However, the majority of the major parties funding is still sourced from private donors. If a candidate or party receives at least 4% of the primary vote at a federal election they are eligible for public funding. The amount of funding paid is calculated by multiplying the number of first preference votes received by the rate of payment at that time, which is indexed in line with the Consumer Price Index. It is possible for a candidate to receive more public funding than what was spent on campaigning as was the case in Pauline Hanson&#x27;s 2004 attempt to win a seat in the Australian Senate.

In Queensland, the threshold for public funding is 6% of the primary vote. The threshold in Victoria, Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory is 4%. South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory do not have public funding for parties and candidates at elections.

==Caretaker convention==
A series of conventions has evolved covering the conduct of the business of government by ministers, their departments of state, and the Public Service during the &quot;caretaker period&quot; of the election. This period begins after the announcement of the election date, when the Governor-General of Australia dissolves the federal parliament on advice from the Prime Minister. It ends after the election result is known and clear, when a newly elected government is sworn into office.

==Federal lower house primary, two-party and seat results==
A two-party system has existed in the Australian House of Representatives since the two non-Labor parties merged in 1909. The 1910 election was the first to elect a majority government, with the Australian Labor Party concurrently winning the first Senate majority. Prior to 1909 a three-party system existed in the chamber. A two-party-preferred vote (2PP) has been calculated since the 1919 change from first-past-the-post to preferential voting and subsequent introduction of the Coalition. ALP = Australian Labor Party, L+NP = grouping of Liberal/National/LNP/CLP Coalition parties (and predecessors), Oth = other parties and independents.



==Landslide election records==
State and territory elections:
* 2021 Western Australian state election – Mark McGowan led the Labor Party to win 53 out of the 59 seats in the lower house. The Labor Party had a primary vote of 59.92% and a two-party-preferred vote of 69.68%. The National Party won 4 seats and the Liberal Party won 2 seats, making the National Party the official opposition, the first time they had held this status since the 1940s. 

To date, the election is the most decisive result at any Australian state or federal election since Federation, in terms of both percentage of lower house seats controlled by the governing party (89.8%) and two-party preferred margin.

* 2011 New South Wales state election – Barry O&#x27;Farrell led the Liberal National Coalition to a landslide victory defeating the incumbent Labor Party Premier, Kristina Keneally with 64.22% of the two-party-preferred vote. The incoming government received 69 of the 93 seats in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. The Labor Party by contrast lost more than half of their seat total.
* 1978 New South Wales state election – Neville Wran led the Labor Party to a landslide victory with a primary vote of 57.77%. the largest primary vote for any party in a century.

<text>Andrew Tyler Hansbrough (born November 3, 1985) is an American former professional basketball player. He played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for seven seasons, as well as internationally.

In college, Hansbrough was a star with the North Carolina Tar Heels from 2005 to 2009. He was the first player in Atlantic Coast Conference history to be named first-team All-ACC four times and to be a first-team All-American four times (he was a consensus first team pick in three of those seasons). Hansbrough was named ACC Rookie of the Year in 2006 and ACC Player of the Year in 2008; he also swept all national player of the year awards in 2008. Hansbrough won an NCAA championship in his senior season at North Carolina in 2009.

Following his college career, Hansbrough was selected by the Indiana Pacers with the 13th overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft. He played four seasons for the Pacers, two seasons for the Toronto Raptors and one season for the Charlotte Hornets. Hansbrough later played professionally in the NBA Development League, Chinese Basketball Association and in the Baloncesto Superior Nacional.

==High school career==
Hansbrough attended Poplar Bluff High School in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, where he led the Mules to back-to-back state championships and scored more than 2,500 career points. He had 29 points, 16 rebounds and two blocks in a 72–56 win over Vashon High in the state Class 5 championship game on March 12, 2005, ending the opposition&#x27;s 60-game win streak. He averaged 28 points and 7.3 rebounds as a senior. In addition to being named Gatorade Player of the Year in Missouri, he was named a McDonald&#x27;s and Parade All-American. He had 15 points and eight rebounds in the McDonald&#x27;s All-America game, and had 24 points and nine rebounds and was named co-MVP of the Jordan Brand Classic.

On April 9, 2005, Hansbrough scored 31 points in a 106–98 USA win over the World Select Team in the Nike Hoop Summit in Memphis, Tennessee, tying the USA record for points in the game.

==College career==

===Freshman season===
As a freshman at North Carolina in 2005–06, Hansbrough became the only player in ACC history to earn First Team All-America honors as a freshman. He was honored by The Sporting News and Rupp, and was named third-team All-America by the Associated Press, NABC and Basketball Times. He was only the third ACC freshman to earn AP All-America honors, joining Kenny Anderson and Stephon Marbury of Georgia Tech. He was selected the National Freshman of the Year by USBWA, ESPN.com, The Sporting News, and Basketball Times, and earned unanimous selection as the ACC Rookie of the Year and was the first freshman to earn unanimous first-team All-ACC honors in league history. On February 15, 2006, Hansbrough set a Dean Smith Center scoring record and an ACC freshman scoring record when he scored 40 points in a home game against Georgia Tech. Hansbrough had the highest scoring average ever by a Tar Heel freshman at 18.9 per game, good for second in the ACC in scoring. He became the first Tar Heel freshman to lead the team in scoring and rebounding, and was the first Tar Heel (and seventh ACC player) to lead his team in scoring, rebounding, field goal percentage and steals in the same season.

===Sophomore season===
A consensus first-team All-American as a sophomore in 2006–07, Hansbrough was voted UNC&#x27;s Most Valuable Player by his teammates and coaches. He was a unanimous first-team All-ACC selection for the second consecutive year and led UNC (fourth in the ACC) in scoring with an average of 18.4 points per game. Tyler led the team and was second in the ACC in rebounds (7.9 per game) and grabbed double figures in rebounds 11 times. He was sixth in the ACC in field goal percentage and ninth in free throw percentage, and was one of three players (along with Florida State&#x27;s Al Thornton and Boston College&#x27;s Jared Dudley) to rank in the Top 10 in both field goal and free throw percentage.

On March 4, 2007, Hansbrough had 26 points and 17 rebounds before suffering an injury in the closing seconds of the Tar Heels&#x27; 86–72 win over Duke, clinching the top seed in the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament. With 14.5 seconds left in the game, Hansbrough leaped for a rebound after a missed free throw attempt by a teammate. After the ball left his hand, he was struck in the face by Gerald Henderson&#x27;s right elbow. The errant elbow broke Hansbrough&#x27;s nose. Henderson was ejected from the game and received an automatic one-game suspension from the NCAA.

===Junior season===
As a junior in 2007–08, Hansbrough was named the consensus National Player of the Year (NPOY). He became the 11th Tar Heel to earn NPOY honors and was the fourth player in ACC history to win National Player of the Year, ACC Player of the Year, ACC Tournament MVP and NCAA Regional MVP honors in the same season. He was voted the ACC Male Athlete of the Year, only the third Tar Heel to win the award in 24 years, and became the third player in ACC history to be unanimously selected three times to the All-ACC team, joining North Carolina State&#x27;s David Thompson (1973–75) and Duke&#x27;s Art Heyman (1961–63).

Hansbrough tied the ACC single-season record by scoring in double figures in 39 games, and scored 882 points, second-most in school history, and the most since Lennie Rosenbluth had 895 in 1956–57. Hansbrough was second in total points in the NCAA behind Davidson&#x27;s Stephen Curry (931), and had 399 rebounds, a UNC single-season record. He led the ACC in scoring and rebounding and ranked 12th nationally in scoring and 17th in rebounding, becoming the first player to lead the ACC in both categories since Antawn Jamison in 1997–98. Hansbrough&#x27;s average of 22.6 points per game was the highest average by a Tar Heel since Charlie Scott (27.1 ppg) in 1969–70. With 10.2 rebounds per game, he became the seventh Tar Heel to lead the ACC in rebounding and just the third Tar Heel in 30 years to average a double-double.

On February 3, 2008, in a game against Florida State, Hansbrough broke Lennie Rosenbluth&#x27;s 51-year-old school record for made free throws. In the ACC semifinals on March 15, 2008, Hansbrough hit a baseline jump shot with 0.8 seconds remaining to give the Tar Heels a 68–66 victory over Virginia Tech. In the Final Four, Hansbrough was held below his season averages in both points and rebounds against Kansas, largely by freshman Cole Aldrich, as North Carolina lost the national semifinal, 84–66.

===Senior season===

Hansbrough was the Tar Heels&#x27; co-MVP with Ty Lawson as a senior in 2008–09. He finished third in the ACC Player of the Year balloting behind Lawson and Florida State&#x27;s Toney Douglas, after finishing the year second in the ACC in scoring at 20.7 points per game and sixth in field goal percentage, free throw percentage and rebounding. He made a career-best 28 straight free throws early in the season and shot a career-best 84.1 percent from the free throw line, improving his free throw accuracy for a third straight season. He scored 18 points in each of North Carolina&#x27;s Final Four wins against Villanova and Michigan State, helping the Tar Heels win the 2009 NCAA championship and subsequently being named to the All-Final Four team.

Due to right shin and left ankle ailments, Hansbrough missed four games early on in the 2008–09 season, the first he had missed as a Tar Heel. On December 18, 2008, in a home game against Evansville, Hansbrough broke North Carolina&#x27;s all-time career scoring record, surpassing a 30-year-old mark held by Phil Ford (2,290 points). Ten days later, Hansbrough grabbed his 1,000th career rebound in a game against Rutgers, becoming one of seven UNC players to record 1,000 career rebounds. On February 28, 2009, Hansbrough made his 906th career free throw in UNC&#x27;s 104–74 win over Georgia Tech, breaking Dickie Hemric&#x27;s (Wake Forest) NCAA record, set in 1955.

===College career legacy===

Hansbrough was the first player in ACC history to earn first-team All-America and first-team All-ACC honors in each of his four seasons. He finished his career with a league-record 2,872 points and a school-record 1,219 rebounds to go with the NCAA record of 982 made free throws. While attending North Carolina, Hansbrough was given the nickname &quot;Psycho T&quot; due to his size and aggressive play style, as well as his off-court personality.

In 2008, Hansbrough swept all major individual honors in men&#x27;s college basketball. For a North Carolina men&#x27;s player to be eligible to have his jersey retired, he must win at least one of six national player of the year awards: Associated Press, U.S. Basketball Writers Association, National Association of Basketball Coaches, Sporting News, Naismith, and Wooden. Since Hansbrough won all six, he had his number 50 retired during halftime against Duke on February 10, 2010.

==Professional career==

=== Indiana Pacers (2009–2013)===
In 2009, Hansbrough was selected by the Indiana Pacers with the 13th overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft. After missing the preseason and the first four games of the regular season with an injury to his shin, he made his NBA debut against the Washington Wizards on November 6, 2009. Hansbrough was limited to 29 games in his rookie season due to assorted injuries including a season-long bout with vertigo.

In the 2010–2011 season, Hansbrough played in 70 games for the Pacers and started 29. He averaged 11 points and 5.3 rebounds per game. On June 30, 2013, the Pacers tendered a qualifying offer to make Hansbrough a restricted free agent. However, two days later, the Pacers rescinded their qualifying offer to Hansbrough, making him an unrestricted free agent.

=== Toronto Raptors (2013–2015)===

Hansbrough signed a two-year deal with the Toronto Raptors on July 15, 2013.

=== Charlotte Hornets (2015–2016)===
On July 22, 2015, Hansbrough signed a one-year deal with the Charlotte Hornets.

=== Fort Wayne Mad Ants (2017)===
On March 1, 2017, Hansbrough was acquired by the Fort Wayne Mad Ants of the NBA Development League.

=== Guangzhou Long-Lions (2017–2018)===
Hansbrough signed with the Guangzhou Long-Lions of the Chinese Basketball Association on July 26, 2017.

=== Zhejiang Golden Bulls (2018–2019)===
In October 2018, Hansbrough signed with the Zhejiang Golden Bulls, returning to China for a second stint.

=== Sichuan Blue Whales (2019–2021)===
On November 28, 2019, Hansbrough was reported to have signed with the Sichuan Blue Whales. On December 13, 2019, Hansbrough recorded a career-high 49 points and 22 rebounds in a 108–105 victory over the Jiangsu Dragons. The Chinese Basketball Association suspended play on February 1, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic before later resuming in June of the same year.

On October 4, 2020, Hansbrough was reported to have re-signed with the Sichuan Blue Whales for a second season, but did not appear in a game for the team during the 2020–21 Chinese Basketball Association season due to the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic and associated travel restrictions.

== Broadcasting career ==
Hansbrough made his broadcasting debut on February 18, 2021, as a color commentator for the ACC Network when the North Carolina Tar Heels took on the Northeastern Huskies.

<text>Nation-wide general and local elections are held every four years, typically in January and November. By-elections and referendums are held on occasion. Electoral systems include first-past-the-post, proportional representation, single non-transferable voting, and a parallel mixture of the above.

General elections are held to elect the president and vice president jointly, and the 113 members of the Legislative Yuan. Local elections are held to elect magistrates of counties, mayors of special municipalities, cities, townships and county-administered cities, chief administrators of indigenous districts and village chiefs. Legislative Yuan and local elections are regional; citizens vote based on their registered address.

Elections are supervised by the Central Election Commission (CEC), an independent agency under the central government, with the municipality, county and city election commissions under its jurisdiction. The minimum voting age is twenty years. Voters must satisfy a four-month residency requirement before being allowed to cast a ballot.

Taiwan was ranked second most electoral democracy in Asia according to V-Dem Democracy indices in 2023. Taiwan scored 0.831 on the V-Dem Democracy electoral democracy index in 2023.

==History==
Elections were held for the first time in Taiwan by the Japanese colonial government on 22 November 1935, electing half of the city and township councilors. The other half were appointed by the prefectural governors. Only men aged 25 and above and who had paid a tax of five yen or more a year were allowed to vote, which was only 28,000 out of the 4 million population. The elections were held again in 1939, but the 1943 election was canceled due to the Second World War. After the surrender of Japan and the transfer of control over Taiwan to the Republic of China, elections were held at the local level as well as to elect representatives to the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan. The ceding of Taiwan was formalized under the Treaty of Taipei in 1952.

The government of the Republic of China, led by the Kuomintang, retreated to Taiwan Island in 1949 after losing the Chinese Civil War with the Chinese Communist Party. At that time, the Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion was enforced and largely restricted civil and political rights including voting rights of the Taiwanese people. In the eight elections starting from the 1948 Republic of China presidential election in Nanking (later known as Nanjing) to the 1990 Taiwan presidential election, the President was indirectly elected by the National Assembly first elected in 1947 and which had never been reelected in its entirety until the lifting of martial law. Similarly, the Legislative Yuan also had not been reelected as a whole since 1948 until the lifting of martial law. The provincial Governor and municipal Mayors were appointed by the central government. Direct elections were only held for local governments at the county level and for legislators at the provincial level. In addition, the Martial law in Taiwan from 1949 to 1987 also prohibited most forms of opposition and Republic of China was governed as a &quot;de facto&quot; one-party state under the Kuomintang although it maintained its status as a &quot;de jure&quot; parliamentary republic.

From the 1990s, a series of democratic reforms were implemented in Taiwan. Since the lifting of martial law in 1987, the ROC has had two major political parties, the Kuomintang and the Democratic Progressive Party. Since then, smaller parties have split from the two main parties and formed as new groups, largely within the Pan-Blue Coalition and Pan-Green Coalition. The Additional Articles of the Constitution were adopted to grant full civil and political rights to the Taiwanese people (officially the people of the Free area of the Republic of China). Under the Additional Articles, the President are to be elected by popular vote and all seats in the national parliament are to be reelected. Following the reforms, the first parliamentary elections on Taiwan were held in 1991 for the National Assembly and 1992 for the Legislative Yuan. The first election for provincial Governors and municipality Mayors was held in 1994. Until 1996, the President of the Republic of China was elected by the National Assembly. In 1996, the Republic of China electoral code was amended to allow for direct election of the President via plurality voting and Taiwan held the first direct election of the President and Vice President in 1996.

The provincial government was reconstructed as a subsidiary of the central government in 1998 and elections for governor and provincial legislators were terminated. The National Assembly ceased to be convened regularly in 2000 and was abolished in 2005. The number of members of the Legislative Yuan was reduced to 113 from 2008.
Taiwan reformed 2008 the legislative election from the single non-transferable vote to parallel voting.
In recent years, the electoral system has been further consolidated the various elections into two categories: national elections and local elections, each election category to be held on the same day.
* The national elections elect the President and Vice President as well as the 113 Legislators.
* The local elections elect 11,130 local officials who serve in self-government bodies.

Since 2004 there have been 20 referendums in Taiwan.

==Current election types==
===Presidential elections===

Presidential elections are held to jointly elect the president and vice president by first-past-the-post.

===Legislative Yuan elections===

Legislative elections are held to elect the 113 members of the Legislative Yuan by parallel voting:
* 73 members by first-past-the-post in single-member constituencies
* 6 by single non-transferable voting in multi-member constituencies, exclusive for persons with indigenous status
* 34 by party-list proportional representation voting

===Local elections===

Nine types of local elections are held to elect:
* Mayors of special municipalities
* Magistrates of counties and mayors of cities
* Councillors in special municipality councils
* Councillors in county and city councils
* Mayors of townships and county-administered cities
* Representatives in township/city councils
* Chief administrators of mountain indigenous districts
* Representatives in mountain indigenous district councils
* Village chiefs
The local elections are also known as &quot;nine-in-one elections&quot; as the election date has been consolidated in recent years. A resident of a county or indigenous district is eligible for five types of votes, whereas a resident of a &quot;city&quot; or non-indigenous district of a special municipality is eligible for three. Magistrates, mayors, chief administrators, and village chiefs are elected by first-past-the-post. Councillors and council representatives are elected by single non-transferable voting in multi-member constituencies.

==Eligibility==
In order to vote in Taiwan, one must be a national with household registration of the Republic of China who will be 20 years or older on the day before the election.

For presidential elections, the voter must have once lived in the Taiwan area for six consecutive months or longer. Residents of the area at the time of the election are automatically registered while those living abroad must apply.

For legislative and local elections, the voter must have been living in the associated electoral district for four consecutive months or longer at the time of the election. For legislative elections, the electoral district for indigenous and party-list votes is nationwide. Eligibility for the three types of votes is evaluated separately.

<text>Land Warrior was a United States Army program, launched in 1989. It officially got its name in 1994, cancelled in 2007 but restarted in 2008. It has used a combination of commercial, off-the-shelf technology (COTS) and current-issue military gear and equipment designed to:
* integrate small arms with high-tech equipment;
* provide communications and command and control at the infantry soldier level;
* look at the individual infantry soldier as a complete unit rather than as a segment of a larger force.

While technology had long been a primary focus of the U.S. Armed Forces, very little of it had actually been adopted by the U.S. Army infantry soldier. With growing concerns of urban warfare and dismounted infantry actions, the U.S. Army recognized the need to upgrade an individual infantryman. The Land Warrior program drew upon many wearable computer concepts, and maximized existing technologies to correct most infantry soldier limitations in the short term.

The SI (Stryker Interoperable) version of the system completed U.S. Army testing as of November 2004. Due to limited resources, and issues with the overall weight of the system, Land Warrior was cancelled by the Army in February 2007, but restarted in July 2007. Despite the initial system&#x27;s cancellation the 4th Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT) was deployed to Iraq as part of the spring 2007 &quot;surge&quot; of U.S. forces, and used the Land Warrior, on which they had trained for the previous few years.

The systems and technology of the Land Warrior program were to be rolled into the Future Force Warrior program, and the Army has developed the Nett Warrior system to supersede Land Warrior as its next soldier network program.

Internationally, there are several similar development programs, these include IdZ (Germany), FIST (UK), Félin (France), Land 125 (Australia), MARKUS (Sweden), Soldato Futuro (Italy), IMESS (Switzerland), Projekt TYTAN (Poland), FINSAS (India) and ACMS (Singapore), Ratnik (Russia), SARV (Iran).

== History ==

The original Land Warrior program, under a different name, was undertaken by General Electric in Moorestown, New Jersey in approximately 1989, as a prototype having intent to eventually reduce size and weight in future phases. Then in the mid-1990s, the name Land Warrior was adopted and the program was handled by a division of Hughes Aerospace, which was subsequently acquired by Raytheon. (The soldier radio component of Land Warrior was to be supplied by the Integrated Information Systems division of Motorola.)

Early demonstration versions of the LW system used software written in the Ada programming language running on a Unix platform. In January 1999, under the direction of Bruce D. Jette, an attempt was made to reduce development costs and accelerate the program, and the development work was transitioned to a multi-company team that had been organized by Exponent, Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPO), an engineering firm with headquarters in Silicon Valley.

An intensive redesign of the system ensued, and both the embedded firmware and the application software were rewritten from scratch. Many of the COTS hardware components were purchased (literally &quot;off the shelf&quot;) at Fry&#x27;s Electronics, a Silicon Valley–based retail chain. Approximately 100 proof-of-concept Land Warrior units were built and successfully demonstrated in September 2000 by a U.S. Army platoon that was air-dropped into a large war-fighting exercise at Fort Polk, Louisiana.

These initial prototype units, designated Land Warrior v0.6, were built around a PC/104 computer platform running Microsoft Windows. The system used the CAN-bus protocol on the wired PAN (personal area network). The communications subsystem was built using Windows CE running on a StrongARM platform, and the wireless network protocol was IEEE 802.11. During the Fort Polk exercise, preliminary interoperability with traditional military radio networks was also demonstrated for LW v0.6, using a two-way, SINCGARS-compatible gateway radio.

The success of the Fort Polk exercise reinvigorated the program, and further funding was allocated for the next phase of LW development. A &quot;Land Warrior Consortium&quot; was formed by several of the contracting firms, with the goal of designing and building the first field-able LW system, designated LW v1.0, later LW-IC (Land Warrior – Initial Capability). The basic Windows and WinCE platforms were retained, and a new hybrid PAN was designed, which drew upon both USB and FireWire protocols. A modified version of the IEEE 802.11 protocol was adopted, which added various enhancements for COMSEC and information security, mobile ad hoc network capabilities, and support for multi-hop packet routing.

In 2003, a variant of the LW-IC system was developed to incorporate features of the CombatID System (CIDS) – a form of IFF (identification friend or foe) that is designed to reduce the potential for friendly fire incidents. This version, designated LW-CIDS, was successfully demonstrated in interoperational tests with several other CIDS-equipped units at Moffett Field, California.

As the Land Warrior program matured, it became clear that its successful deployment would hinge significantly upon the key factor of batteries. The need to continuously resupply (or recharge) LW batteries was proving to be a major logistical challenge. This was one of the driving factors behind the decision to move away from an earlier plan to initially equip airborne Army units, as in the Fort Polk exercise, and to focus instead upon those using Stryker ground vehicle systems. This latter approach would enable more LW batteries to be distributed and/or recharged as needed.

The contract for development of the Land Warrior – Stryker Interoperable (LW-SI) version of the system was awarded in 2003 to an industry team that was led by General Dynamics and included most of the existing Land Warrior Consortium companies. At about the same time, further development of the existing LW-IC system was halted and the manufacturing plans for it were shelved indefinitely. The Land Warrior Consortium was formally disbanded and work got under way on the newly focused LW-SI program.

In September 2006, the 4th Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment trained with and evaluated the LW-SI system. The system successfully completed the assessment, which was based on Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) guidance, and received testimonials from the unit. However, funding for further system development under the Land Warrior program was suspended in February 2007, and after a final contract to General Dynamics in 2009, further contracts for LW were not renewed. A decision was made in 2011 to continue some portions of the program under new initiatives; though these would eventually became defunct due to private industry developments (notably from Crye Precision) replicating much of the technology, and ultimately most component programs were cancelled.

==Description==
Land Warrior had three priority objectives:
* Improving the lethality of an individual soldier
* Increasing the survivability of a soldier
* Providing full command, communications, and control to a soldier

Land Warrior had seven main subsystems:
* &quot;Weapon&quot;
* &quot;Integrated helmet assembly&quot;
* &quot;Protective clothing and equipment&quot;
* &quot;Computer&quot;
* &quot;Navigation&quot;
* &quot;Radio&quot;
* &quot;Software system&quot;

Later features of the Land Warrior system included:
* providing dismounted soldier combat identification for en route situational awareness and power recharge to reduce &#x27;friendly fire&#x27; incidents
* Commander&#x27;s Digital Assistant leader planning tool
* weight and power reduction
* scalability and tailorability for operational missions

=== Weapon ===

The original system was built around the M16 rifle or M4 carbine, both with modular rail mounts to allow customization as needed for each mission. It included the weapon itself, plus components such as a daylight video sight, thermal weapons sight and MFL (Multi-Function Laser). The MFL provided range and direction information, as well as IR, visible, and MILES lasers, while the cameras provided a video feed and thermographic capabilities, plus allowing a soldier to shoot around corners or behind cover without actually exposing himself to enemy fire. 

=== Helmet ===
The Helmet Subsystem (HSS) combined a lightweight advanced helmet with a microphone and headset, computer and OLED display that provided various information from digital maps and troop locations down to his weapon-mounted video camera. Combined with the aiming lasers, it would have allowed the soldier to aim (and fire) around corners. 

=== Computer ===
The Computer Subsystem (CSS) provided the processing power and storage capacity for the system. The CSS is based around an ARM core processor. Prior to the project&#x27;s cancellation (when project funds were moved to Hurricane Katrina relief) the computer used was Techsol&#x27;s Ethernet Audio Interface board, powered by an s3c2410a processor from Samsung Semiconductor, featuring an ARM-920T core running at up to 200 MHz. The board included a low-power Ethernet interface using the cs8900a from Cirrus Logic, an audio interface using the internal IIS audio interface of the Samsung chip connected to an AKM integrated Audio Codec and Amplifier, a GPS receiver from Motorola, and using GPIOs for the push-buttons used for volume up/down, and also channel up/down. With a wide-voltage-range input power-supply, the entire wearable computer board was the size of a business card (see photo). 

Future versions were powered by an XScale processor from Intel. The CSS connects to each one of the LRUs as well as to the batteries.

=== Navigation ===
The Navigation Subsystem (NSS) provided positional information. It integrated a GPS receiver and a Dead Reckoning Module (DRM) that maintains accurate location when Global Positioning System signal becomes unavailable.

=== Radio ===
The Communication Network Radio Subsystem (CNRS) provided communications capabilities for the Land Warrior. It was based on the Enhanced Position Location Reporting System.

=== Software ===
Land Warrior&#x27;s software system was powered by a variant of the Linux operating system and had a modular, open architecture for further improvement. The Land Warrior software suite contained six main software packages for weapon sights and for data.

=== Fighting Load Vest ===
The Fighting Load Vest was used for carrying the various sensors and the computer. The vest could be adjusted while on the move and could carry the power system composed of batteries weighing up to 1.1kg (2.5lb).

==Later developments: GSS Increment 1 and Nett Warrior==
229 Land Warrior ensembles were deployed by the 4th Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment to Iraq from May 2007 to June 2008. A Stryker Brigade later deployed with the system to Afghanistan, and Land Warrior remained in use until spring 2012. The Army built upon Land Warrior with the Ground Soldier System (GSS) as its successor, an advanced dismounted soldier integrated situational awareness system that entered technology development in February 2009. GSS Increment 1 was renamed Nett Warrior in June 2010 after Medal of Honor recipient Robert B. Nett (although the term &quot;Nett&quot; has frequently been misinterpreted as a reflection of its tactical networking features). Nett Warrior was first demonstrated in spring 2011, which then was essentially the 10-pound Land Warrior ensemble with some enhanced additional software. Later iterations focused on a hand-held solution that integrated a commercial hand-held screen device with the Rifleman radio, simplifying the system and decreasing weight to . Nett Warrior utilizes enhanced smartphones, using different models over the course of its development including the Motorola Atrix, Samsung Galaxy Note I, and the Samsung Galaxy Note 2.
