<text>Impulse! Records (occasionally styled as &quot;¡mpulse! Records&quot; and &quot;¡!&quot;) is an American jazz record label established by Creed Taylor in 1960. John Coltrane was among Impulse!&#x27;s earliest signings. Thanks to consistent sales and positive critiques of his recordings, the label came to be known as &quot;the house that Trane built&quot;.

==History==
Impulse!&#x27;s parent company, ABC-Paramount Records, was established in 1955 as the recording division of the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). In the 1940s and 1950s, ABC benefitted from the U.S. government&#x27;s antitrust actions against broadcasters and film studios who were forced to divest parts of their companies. In the early 1950s, ABC acquired the Blue Network of radio stations from NBC and later merged with the newly independent Paramount Theaters chain, formerly owned by Paramount Pictures.

The new recording division was located at 1501 Broadway, above the Paramount Theatre in Times Square. Under the leadership of Leonard Goldenson, the former head of Paramount Pictures, the company &quot;sought to establish itself as a cross-media force in television, theaters and sound recordings&quot;. It enjoyed early success in TV with &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;, a joint venture with Disney.

To market music from the successful TV show, ABC-Paramount established the Am-Par Record Corporation and the ABC-Paramount label in early 1955, appointing Sam Clark, a Boston record distributor, as president, with Larry Newton as sales manager and Harry Levine the A&amp;R director. The new recording company enjoyed Goldenson&#x27;s full support. Sid Feller, a producer and arranger, was the first salaried employee on July 15, 1955. The label achieved early success in pop music with Paul Anka.

In 1960, Am-Par established a jazz subsidiary and hired Creed Taylor, a producer and arranger who had worked with Bethlehem Records. Taylor became producer and A&amp;R manager. He chose the name &quot;Pulse&quot; but then learned there was already a label with that name, so he added a prefix. In the mid-1960s, the headquarters of Impulse! was moved to 1130 Avenue of the Americas.

===Design===
Impulse!&#x27;s albums are known for their visual appeal. The black, orange, and white livery was devised by Fran Attaway (then known as Fran Scott), whom Taylor also credits with establishing the label&#x27;s tradition of using cutting-edge photographers for its covers. The color scheme was chosen for its brightness and because no other label used this combination.

The label&#x27;s logo featured the Impulse! name in a heavy, sans-serif, lower-cased font, followed by an exclamation mark that mirrors the lower-case &quot;i&quot; at the beginning. For most of the 1960s, Impulse!&#x27;s album covers featured the logo in orange letters in a white circle, with black-and-orange exclamation marks above it, and the catalog number below it. One exception is the album &quot;A Love Supreme&quot;, which used the design in black and white. In 1968 the circular front-cover badge was replaced by a one-color design featuring a simplified Impulse! logo and the ABC Records logo side by side within a divided rectangular border.

Album covers often featured stylish, large-format photographs or paintings, usually in color, which were typically bled out to the edges of the cover and printed on glossy laminated stock. Many of the best-known Impulse! covers were designed by art director Robert Flynn and photographed by a small group that included Pete Turner, who shot covers for Verve, A&amp;M, and CTI; Chuck Stewart; Arnold Newman; Ted Russell; and Joe Alper, who was known for his early ’60s photographs of Bob Dylan) The sparse black-and-white back covers bore the slogan &quot;The New Wave of Jazz is on IMPULSE!&quot; Most Impulse! LPs were issued in a gatefold sleeve, with photographs, liner notes, and, in some cases, multi-page booklets.

===Early success===
Taylor achieved early success by signing Ray Charles, who had just ended his contract with Atlantic Records. Charles&#x27;s &quot;Genius + Soul = Jazz&quot; gave the label its first hit and became the fourth-highest charting album of his career. Other early successes included &quot;Out of the Cool&quot; by Gil Evans. Taylor also signed John Coltrane.

Another significant early release was &quot;The Blues and the Abstract Truth&quot; by Oliver Nelson, who led an all-star group that featured Freddie Hubbard, Eric Dolphy, Bill Evans, Paul Chambers, and Roy Haynes. Nelson played an important role in the label&#x27;s early years before relocating to Los Angeles, where he became an arranger for film and television.

Taylor left Impulse! in the summer of 1961 after being approached by MGM to become the head of Verve Records.

===The Thiele Years: 1961-69===
Bob Thiele, Taylor&#x27;s successor, produced most of the albums in the 1960s. He had worked for Decca Records and its subsidiaries Coral and Brunswick, where his production credits included Alan Dale, the McGuire Sisters, Pearl Bailey, and Theresa Brewer, whom he married. Despite resistance from Decca executives who were suspicious of rock and roll, Thiele signed Buddy Holly in 1957.

Thiele&#x27;s first Impulse! production was Coltrane&#x27;s &quot;Live! at the Village Vanguard&quot;, released in March 1962. Although unfamiliar with the &quot;new jazz&quot; movement, Thiele backed his artists, afforded them unprecedented freedom in their repertoire, and gave leading acts like Coltrane &quot;carte blanche&quot; in the studio. Impulse! during the Thiele years is recognized as a key outlet for free jazz and the musical movement spearheaded by Coltrane, Freddie Hubbard, Archie Shepp, and McCoy Tyner. In addition to avant-garde releases, Thiele also produced collaborations between Coltrane and two of their mutual heroes, Duke Ellington and Coleman Hawkins. Other notable performers who recorded for Impulse! during this period included Charles Mingus.

Aided by good promotion and ABC-Paramount&#x27;s well-established distribution chain, Coltrane enjoyed the highest profile and the strongest and most consistent sales of any Impulse! artist. In addition to its artistic influence, Coltrane&#x27;s 1965 LP &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; became one of the most successful jazz albums ever released, selling over 100,000 copies on its first release. By 1970 it had sold more than half a million. Roger McGuinn of the Byrds has stated that he listened to Coltrane extensively in this period, and that Coltrane&#x27;s saxophone playing influenced his 12-string guitar playing on the hit &quot;Eight Miles High&quot;.

Thiele severed his ties with Impulse! in 1969, setting up a short-lived deal to provide independently produced recordings, before leaving the label entirely to establish his own imprint, Flying Dutchman Records. Thiele&#x27;s departure was in part precipitated by the breakdown of his relationship with Larry Newton, the president of ABC Records.

One of Thiele&#x27;s last productions was the Louis Armstrong song &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot;, which Thiele co-wrote and produced for ABC&#x27;s pop division shortly before Armstrong&#x27;s death. Although the musicians were apparently unaware of the drama, the recording session is reported to have been the scene of a clash between Thiele and Newton. When Newton arrived at the session he became upset when he discovered that Armstrong was recording a ballad rather than a &#x27;Dixieland&#x27;-style number like his earlier hit &quot;Hello Dolly&quot;. According to Thiele&#x27;s own account, this led to a screaming match; Newton then had to be locked out of the studio and he stood outside throughout the session, banging on the door and yelling to be let in. The single was released with little promotion from ABC and it sold relatively poorly in the U.S.. In Europe, it sold more than 1.5 million copies and went to #1 in the UK. Demand from ABC&#x27;s European distributor EMI for an album forced ABC to issue one, but they did not promote the album and it did not chart in the U.S. Twenty years later, it became the most successful recording of both Armstrong&#x27;s and Thiele&#x27;s careers, thanks to its inclusion on the soundtrack &quot;Good Morning, Vietnam&quot;.

===The 1970s===
Under the guidance of Ed Michel, Thiele&#x27;s successor, Impulse! continued to issue significant recordings, including the debut album by the Liberation Music Orchestra, the first of four collaborations between Charlie Haden and Carla Bley. The company also acquired LP masters that Sun Ra had recorded for his private label, making them more widely available for the first time.

In the early 1970s, ABC restructured its recording division, merging the ABC label with its other pop-rock subsidiary, Dunhill Records, whose roster included The Mamas &amp; the Papas, Steppenwolf, Three Dog Night, and The Grass Roots. Impulse! was moved to share headquarters with ABC-Dunhill in Los Angeles. By this time, pop-rock acts dominated the company&#x27;s output, with Impulse! releases accounting for only 5 percent of total sales. It was also during this time that Impulse! became the first all-jazz label to release a rock album when it issued &quot;Trespass&quot;, the second album by Genesis, in the U.S. in 1970.

In 1974, ABC acquired the Famous Music labels and catalog from Gulf+Western, and subsequently, that company&#x27;s jazz recordings were incorporated into the Impulse! catalog. New recordings from the label ceased in the late 1970s, but ABC reissued titles until the company was sold to MCA Records in 1979. The label lay dormant until it was resurrected in 1992 as part of MCA’s GRP Records, during which time the label started releasing important titles that had otherwise been unavailable and began signing new artists during the late 1990s. In 1999, Impulse! became part of Universal Music Group&#x27;s jazz holdings, under the aegis of the Verve Label Group, where it has remained until the present.

<text>Wessel Dietrich van Diepen is a Dutch radio host, music producer, and former TV presenter. Under the pseudonym DJ Delmundo, he is part of Danski &amp; Delmundo, the production duo behind acts like the Vengaboys and Alice Deejay. With a total of 10 UK top 10 hits including 2 UK number one hits, two &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance number one hits, a gold album in the US and multi-platinum selling singles worldwide, he is one of the most successful dance-pop music producers in Dutch history. Van Diepen is the station-voice for Radio 538 and FOX Television NL and does movie trailer voiceover work. In spring 2019, Dutch online newspaper &quot;Nu.nl&quot; declared Vengaboys as the most successful Dutch pop group in history.

==Career==
Born in Delft, South Holland, At age 15, van Diepen started a pirate radio station called &quot;Radio Stad Delft&quot;. The station was taken down by the police numerous times. When he was 17 years old, during a holiday in Wichita, Kansas, U.S., he met a DJ at KKRD who gave van Diepen the opportunity to fill in for him.

In 1986, van Diepen was noticed by 3FM DJ Rob Stenders in the Netherlands and became a DJ at the VARA, which also broadcasts via national radio 3FM.

As a fresh voice in Dutch radio, van Diepen was recruited by popular broadcasting organization Veronica for radio and TV programs. This included the Europe-wide broadcast pop music TV show &quot;Countdown&quot;, broadcast on Sky Channel and Super Channel, which brought him to international fame.

In the 1990s, television moguls Erik de Zwart and Lex Harding left Veronica and started Radio 538 and van Diepen was asked to join them. From his daily drive-time show he went on to create the radio show &quot;Van Diepen&#x27;s Dance Department&quot; where DJs such as Tiësto and Oakenfold would spin their vinyl live in the studio. When Dutch music video channel TMF (The Music Factory) was launched in 1995, van Diepen took up a VJ role in a show called &quot;Wessels Woelige Wereld&quot; (translated: &quot;Wessels Wild World&quot;), which he hosted until 1999.

Van Diepen also started a run of dance music productions in the 1990s. Together with Peran van Dijk and later Dennis van Den Driesschen (&#x27;Danski&#x27;), he produced acts such as L.A. Style, known for &quot;James Brown Is Dead&quot; (with van Diepen doing the trademark megaphone catchphrase). &quot;James Brown Is Dead&quot; was their first song to hit the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. They also found success with Nakatomi, Alice Deejay and Vengaboys. The Vengaboys alone sold over 15 million singles and 4.5 million albums. The group went platinum in 73 countries and performed in more than 130 countries.

The Vengaboys split in 2000, but van Diepen co-wrote and produced their comeback release &quot;Rocket to Uranus&quot; in 2010. In 2013, Protocol Recordings released the EDM track &quot;WTF!?&quot; which was also co-written by van Diepen and produced by Nicky Romero and Peran van Dijk.

Van Diepen resigned as a radio presenter in 2006 to focus more on artist development and music production, but he returned to Radio 538 in 2013 with Global Dance Chart, a weekly beat-mixed chart-show with the 40 biggest dance hits worldwide. The show was officially opened by Martin Garrix smashing a bottle of champagne on van Diepen&#x27;s head.

<text>Paris Club () is a group of major creditor countries aiming to provide a sustainable way to tackle debt problems in debtor countries. Its creation, which is the first informal meeting, dates back to 1956, when Argentina agreed to hold a meeting with its public creditors.

The Paris Club treats public claims (that is to say, those due by governments of debtor countries and by the private sector), guaranteed by the public sector to Paris Club members. A similar process used to occur for public debt held by private creditors in the London Club, which was organized in 1970 on the model of the Paris Club as an informal group of commercial banks renegotiating together the debt they hold on sovereign debtors (countries to which they extended loans) which were no longer able to repay.

Creditor countries meet c. ten times a year for &quot;Tour d&#x27;Horizon&quot; and negotiating sessions. To facilitate Paris Club operations, the French Treasury provides a small secretariat, and the Director general of the French Treasury acts as chairman.

Paris club has reached 478 agreements with 102 debtor countries to date for approximately USD 600 bn rescheduled.

==Members of the Paris Club==

There are currently 22 Permanent Members of the Paris Club:
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
Creditor delegations are generally led by a senior delegate from the Ministry of Finance.

===Ad hoc participants===
Other official creditors can also participate in negotiation sessions or in monthly &quot;Tours d&#x27;Horizon&quot; discussions, subject to the agreement of permanent members and of the debtor country. When participating in Paris Club discussions, invited creditors act in good faith and abide by the practices described below. The following creditors have participated in some Paris Club agreements or Tours d&#x27;Horizon in an ad hoc manner:
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 

===Observers===
Observers are invited to attend the negotiating sessions of the Paris Club but they cannot participate in the negotiation itself, nor sign the agreement that formalizes the result of negotiation.

There are three categories of observers:

# Representatives of international institutions:
#* International Monetary Fund (IMF)
#* World Bank
#* Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
#* United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)
#* European Commission
#* African Development Bank
#* Asian Development Bank
#* European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)
#* Inter-American Development Bank (IADB)

# Representatives of permanent members of the Paris Club, which have no claims concerned by the debt treatment, for example creditors whose claims are covered by the de minimis provision or that are not creditors of the debtor country concerned, but nevertheless want to attend the negotiation meeting;
# Representatives of non Paris Club countries, which have claims on the debtor country concerned but are not in a position to sign the Paris Club agreement as ad hoc participants, provided that permanent members and the debtor country agree on their attendance.

==Organisation==

===The Secretariat===

The Secretariat was established to prepare more effective negotiating sessions. The Secretariat is composed of a dozen people from the French Directorate General of the Treasury, it is led by a Secretary general.

The Secretariat&#x27;s role is primarily to safeguard the common interests of creditor countries participating in the Club, and to facilitate the reaching of a consensus between them at each level of the discussions. To achieve this, the Secretariat prepares negotiating sessions according to a specific method.

In the early stages of discussions, the Secretariat analyses the debtor country&#x27;s payment capacity and provides creditors with a first proposal for a treatment. This proposal is discussed by the creditors (whose positions during the negotiation are transcribed in the so-called &quot;magic table&quot;). The Secretariat is also responsible for drafting the minutes of negotiation.

The Secretariat also helps to ensure compliance with the various covenants contained in the minutes and maintains external relations with third States creditors and commercial banks, in particular to ensure the greatest possible respect of comparability clause treatment.

Under the common framework for debt treatment, the secretariat acts under the guidance of the co-chairs (Paris Club and G20 co-chairs) in the same technical work. 

===The Chair===

Since 1956, the Presidency of the Paris Club is ensured by the French Treasury.

The Chairperson of the Paris Club is Bertrand Dumont, Director-General of the Treasury. 
Co-Chairman is William Roos, Assistant Secretary for Multilateral Affairs, Trade and Development Policies Department. Vice-Chair is Shanti Bobin, his Deputy in charge of Multilateral Financial Affairs and Development Division.
One of these three must chair every meeting of the Paris Club.

In particular, during negotiation sessions, the Chairman of the Paris Club plays the role of intermediary between creditors, who elaborate debt treatment proposals, and the representative of the debtor country, usually the Minister of Finance. He is responsible for submitting to the debtor&#x27;s delegation terms agreed upon by creditors. The Secretary general assists him in the negotiation his team prepares. If the debtor – which is common – refuses the first offer of creditors, the actual negotiation begins, the Chairman acting as a shuttle between the debtor and creditors.

==Paris Club principles==
• Solidarity: All members of the Paris Club agree to act as a group in their dealings with a given debtor country and be sensitive to the effect that the management of their particular claims may have on the claims of other members.

• Consensus: Paris Club decisions cannot be taken without a consensus among the participating creditor countries.

• Information sharing: The Paris Club is a unique information-sharing forum. Paris Club members regularly share views and information with each other on the situation of debtor countries, benefit from participation by the IMF and World Bank, and share data on their claims on a reciprocal basis. In order for discussions to remain productive, deliberations are kept confidential.

• Case by case: The Paris Club makes decisions on a case-by-case basis in order to tailor its action to each debtor country&#x27;s individual situation. This principle was consolidated by the Evian Approach.

• Conditionality: The Paris Club only negotiates debt restructurings with debtor countries that: 1) need debt relief. Debtor countries are expected to provide a precise description of their economic and financial situation, 2) have implemented and are committed to implementing reforms to restore their economic and financial situation, and 3) have a demonstrated track record of implementing reforms under an IMF program. This means in practice that the country must have a current program supported by an appropriate arrangement with the IMF (Stand-By, Extended Fund Facility, Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, Policy Support Instrument). The level of the debt treatment is based on the financing gap identified in the IMF program. In the case of a flow treatment, the consolidation period coincides with the period when the IMF arrangement shows a need for debt relief. When the flow treatment extends over a long period of time (generally more than one year), the Paris Club agreement is divided into phases. The amounts falling due during the first phase are treated as soon as the agreement enters into force. Subsequent phases are implemented following completion of conditions mentioned in the Agreed Minutes, including non-accumulation of arrears and approval of the reviews of the IMF program.

• Comparability of treatment: the Paris Club requires that debtor countries obtaining Paris Club relief not offer better terms to non-Paris Club bilateral creditors.

==Meetings==

Paris Club creditor countries generally meet 10 times per year. Each session includes a one-day meeting called a “Tour d&#x27;Horizon” during which Paris Club creditors discuss debt situations of debtor countries, or methodological issues regarding the debt issues more broadly. The session may also include negotiation meetings with one or more debtor countries.

===Negotiations===

A debtor country is invited to a negotiation meeting with its Paris Club creditors when it has concluded an appropriate programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that demonstrates that the country is not able to meet its external debt obligations and thus needs a new payment arrangement with its external creditors (conditionality principle). Paris Club creditors link the debt restructuring to the IMF programme because the economic policy reforms are intended to restore a sound macroeconomic framework that will lower the probability of future financial difficulties.

The twenty two permanent members of the Paris Club may participate in the negotiation meetings, as participating creditors if they have claims towards the invited debtor country, as observers if not. Other official bilateral creditors may be invited to attend negotiation meetings on an ad-hoc basis, subject to the agreement of permanent members and of the debtor country. Representatives of international institutions, notably the IMF, the World Bank and the relevant regional development bank also attend the meeting as observers. The debtor country is usually represented by the Minister of Finance. They generally lead a delegation comprising officials from the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank.

====Steps in a negotiation====

After a few words from the chairman to welcome everybody and to open the meeting, the official meeting begins with a statement by the minister of the debtor country, who presents in particular the requested debt treatment.

This statement is followed by statements by the IMF and the World Bank, and, if appropriate, by representatives of other international institutions.

The representatives of creditor countries may then request additional information or clarification from the minister regarding the situation in the debtor country.

After responding to any questions, the delegation of the debtor country then leaves the main room and stays in another room during the entire session.

Creditors then discuss among themselves a proposed debt treatment. Once creditors agree on a treatment, the chairman of the meeting will then present this proposed treatment to the delegation of the debtor country. If the debtor country disagrees and asks for amendments to the creditors&#x27; proposal, the chairman will then convey this request to the creditors, who discuss it and consider a new proposal. This process continues until a common agreement between creditors and the debtor country is reached.

Once an agreement is reached on the terms of the treatment, a document called the Agreed Minutes formalizes the accord in writing in French and in English. This agreement is drafted by the Paris Club Secretariat and then approved by the creditors and the debtor.

The delegation of the debtor country then returns to the main room and the Agreed Minutes are signed by the Chairman, the minister of the debtor country and the head of delegation of each participating creditor country.

A press release mutually agreed to by the creditors and the debtor country representatives is released for publication upon completion of the negotiation session.

==Paris Club terms==
On 8 October 2003, Paris Club members announced a new approach that would allow the Paris Club to provide debt cancellation to a broader group of countries. The new approach, named the “Evian Approach” introduces a new strategy for determining Paris Club debt relief levels that is more flexible and can provide debt cancellation to a greater number of countries than was available under prior Paris Club rules. Prior to the Evian Approach&#x27;s introduction, debt cancellation was restricted to countries eligible for IDA loans from the World Bank under Naples Terms or HIPC countries under Cologne terms. Many observers believe that strong U.S. support for Iraq debt relief was an impetus for the creation of the new approach.

Instead of using economic indicators to determine eligibility for debt relief, all potential debt relief cases are now divided into two groups: HIPC and non-HIPC countries. HIPC countries will
continue to receive assistance under Cologne terms, which sanction up to 90% debt cancellation. Non-HIPC countries are assessed on a case-by-case basis.

Non-HIPC countries seeking debt relief first undergo an IMF debt sustainability analysis. This analysis determines whether the country suffers from a liquidity problem, a debt sustainability problem, or both. If the IMF determines that the country suffers from a temporary liquidity problem, its debts are rescheduled until a later date. If the country is also determined to suffer from debt sustainability problems, where it lacks the long-term resources to meet its debt obligations and the amount of debt adversely affects its future ability to pay, the country is eligible for debt cancellation.

===Policies for heavily indebted poor countries===

From 1956 to the late 1980s, the Paris Club opposed debt forgiveness or reduction. Instead of granting reductions, it would sometimes be willing to restructure, reschedule, or refinance. The Paris Club refers to this approach as the &quot;classic terms.&quot;

As a result of the Latin American debt crisis, the Paris Club began to gradually re-evaluate its unwillingness to provide debt forgiveness or reduction over the course of the 1980s. By the late 1980s, the Paris Club concluded that it was not possible to avoid a vicious cycle of debt without a willingness on the Paris Club&#x27;s part to write-off non-performing loans. In 1988, the Paris Club agreed to its first partial debt reduction pursuant to its &quot;Toronto terms&quot;. The level of reduction was defined as 33.33%. Twenty countries benefited from Toronto terms between 1988 and 1991.

In December 1991, creditors decided to increase the level of cancellation of 33.33% as defined in Toronto, to 50% under the &quot;London terms&quot;. These agreements benefited to 23 countries.

Going even further, in December 1994, creditors decided to implement a new treatment called &quot;Naples terms&quot;, which can be implemented on a case by case basis. Thus, for the poorest and most indebted countries, the level of cancellation of eligible credit is increased to 50% or even 67% (as of September 1999, all treatments carry a 67% debt reduction). In addition, stock of treatments can be applied in each case for countries that have complied satisfactorily with previous commitments. Up to 2008, 35 of 39 countries have reached the completion point of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries HIPCs.

Finally, in September 1996, the joint proposal of the Development Committee of the World Bank and the IMF Interim Committee, the international financial community has recognized that the debt situation of a number of very poor countries, of which three quarters are located in sub-Saharan Africa remained extremely difficult, even after having used traditional mechanisms. A group of 39 countries were identified as being potentially eligible for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries HIPCs.

Since the start of the HIPC initiative, debt relief granted to the 36 post-decision point countries at end-2011 amounts to almost 35 percent of these countries’ 2010 GDP, around US$128 Bn in nominal terms. The total debt relief effort provided under the HIPC initiative is shared by multilateral creditors (44.5%), the Paris Club (36.3%), non-Paris Club bilateral creditors (13.1%) and private creditors (6.1%). Hence, the HIPC initiative represents a genuine and significant financial effort from Paris Club member countries, especially considering that they indirectly contribute to debt relief granted by multilateral creditors, as they are major shareholders of these international financial institutions.

According to the IMF and the World Bank, debt relief granted since the beginning of the HIPC Initiative reduced beneficiary countries’ debt burden by about 90 percent relative to pre-decision point levels. Debt relief has also allowed beneficiary countries to reduce their debt service and to increase social spending. According to the IMF and the World Bank, for the 36 post-decision point countries, poverty reducing spending increased by more than 3 percentage points of GDP, on average, between 2001 and 2010, while debt service payments declined by a similar amount. Such progress is consistent with the HIPC initiative’ objective, namely, to reallocate the increased spending capacity towards the fight against poverty and to accelerate progress toward the United Nations Millennium Development Goals.

Apart from the HIPC initiative, the Paris Club adopted a new framework for debt restructuring in 2003, the Evian approach. Through the Evian framework, the Paris Club&#x27;s goal is to take into account debt sustainability considerations, to adapt its response to the financial situation of debtor countries, and to contribute to current efforts to ensure an orderly, timely and predictable resolution of economic and financial crises. The approach aims at providing a tailored response to debtor countries’ payment difficulties. Countries with unsustainable debt may be granted a comprehensive debt treatment, provided that they are committed to policies that will secure an exit from the Paris Club process, in the framework of their IMF arrangements.

==Paris Forum==
The Paris Forum is an annual event, jointly organized by the Paris Club and the rotating Presidency of the G20, since 2013. The conference gathers representatives from creditor and debtor countries, and is a forum for frank and open debate on the global evolutions in terms of sovereign financing and on the prevention and resolution of sovereign debt crises.
As international financial markets and capital flows are increasingly integrated, non-Paris Club official bilateral creditors are representing a larger share in the financing of developing and emerging countries. The objective of the Forum, in this context, is to foster close and regular dialogue between stakeholders, in order to create an international financial environment favorable to sustainable growth in developing countries. In particular, the Paris Forum aims at enhancing the involvement of emerging countries, be they creditors or debtors, in international debates on sovereign financing, in order to make discussions as open and frank as possible. The Paris Forum annually gathers more than thirty representatives from sovereign creditors and debtors, of which the members of the G20, the members of the Paris Club, and countries from the different regions of the world.
2024 Paris Forum
The eleventh edition of the Paris Forum was held on 26 June in Paris, and was organized by the Paris Club and the Brazilian Presidency of the G20. It gathered 200+ participants representing 80 countries and institutions and was introduced by Vice-minister Tatiana Rosito from Brazil, Vice-minister Liao Min from China, IMF First Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath, Minister of Finance of Qatar Ali bin Ahmed Al Kuwari and Ambassador of Germany in France Stephan Steinlein. 

==Accomplishments==
The Paris club has played a major role in debt crisis resolution for a period greater than 65+ years in emerging and developing countries. The rules and principles that are established for negotiations of different types of debt treatments have proven to be highly efficient towards the resolving of various debt crises. Pragmatism and flexibility are important features in the past activity of the Paris club, with the decisions of the group influenced primarily by technical criteria, although sometimes also by political criteria.

The Paris Club granted in November 2004 a cancellation of 80% of the stock of debt owed by Iraq, cancelling nearly 30 billion of dollars of claims, while also granting a moratorium payment until 2008. In February 2006, the United States announced a relief of Afghanistan&#x27;s debt of $108 million.

In 2005, after the tsunami which affected the countries bordering the Indian Ocean, the Paris Club decided to temporarily suspend some repayments of affected countries. In January 2010, the Paris Club also cancelled Haiti&#x27;s debt to help it overcome the consequences of the earthquake of 12 January.

Russia had, in May 2005, begun to repay its debt to Paris Club countries. On 21 August 2006, Russia repaid the remainder of its debt to the Paris Club. Gabon and Jordan both bought their debt back in 2007 at market value.

In January 2013, the Paris Club treated $10 billion of debt owed by Myanmar to the Paris Club, cancelling 50% of arrears and rescheduling the rest over 15 years, including 7 years of grace.

There are many other contributions of Paris Club which are deemed notable. The deal with the creditors of the Paris Club and the Argentinian Government on 28 and 29 May 2014 is a landmark deal where an arrangement was made to clear the debt in the arrears which are due to the creditors of the Paris Club in a span of 5 years. The deal covers some amount of $9.7 billion of debts by 30 April 2014. Additionally, there is flexible structure to get the arrears cleared with a minimum of $1,150 million by May 2015, with the payment due to be paid by May 2016. The debt accumulated for Argentina is due to the 2001–02 Argentinian default crises, where there is default amount of $132 billion.

==Criticism of the Paris Club==
Critics argue that the Paris Club is not transparent. In 2006, a significant number of non-governmental organizations have requested a change of rules of the Paris Club, especially for transparency.

The Paris Club created a new website in 2009 which reiterated the terms of all treatment given to 90 debtor countries. 
Since 2008, the Paris Club has published an annual report. The report includes detailed data on claims that its members hold on foreign states. The total of claims held by the Paris Club at end 2023, excluding late interest, amounts to USD 334.2 billion of which USD 195.3 billion are ODA claims and USD 138.9 billion are NODA claims. 

All Paris Club agreements main terms are described on the Club&#x27;s website. 

In 2022, the Paris Club released its conditions to engage with debt treatment to the public.

Selected by the Boston Red Sox in the first round (20th pick) of the 1983 Major League Baseball draft, Burks made his debut in the 1987 season as a regular center fielder at age 22, becoming the third player in Red Sox history to hit 20 home runs and steal 20 bases in one season. He was selected to both the &quot;Baseball Digest&quot; and Topps &quot;All-Rookie&quot; teams. Defensively, Burks showed excellent range, a sure glove and a strong arm. Burks, however, was injury-prone. He had shoulder surgery in 1989, and it was the first of many setbacks for him. During the season he hit two home runs in the same inning of a game, to become the second player in Red Sox history to achieve the feat; Bill Regan was the first, in .

Later, Burks suffered from bad knees and back spasms. After six seasons in Boston, and despite his injuries, he ended up leaving as a free agent and signing with the Chicago White Sox in January 1993. He surpassed expectations around him by turning in a solid, injury-free season, filling the White Sox&#x27; urgent need for a quality right fielder. He was one of the club&#x27;s better performers in the playoffs, batting .304. A free agent at the end of the season, he signed a five-year contract with the Colorado Rockies (1994–98). On April 17, 1994, Burks hit a game-winning home run in the bottom of the 10th inning against the Montreal Expos. It was the only major league walk-off home run ever hit at Mile High Stadium. His 1,000th career hit also came against the Expos, a triple in July 1995.

In , Burks enjoyed his best season. He led National League hitters in runs (142), slugging average (.639), total bases (392) and extra-base hits (93); was second in hits (211) and doubles (45), and fifth in home runs (40) and RBI (128). His .344 average was also second in the race for the batting title (behind Tony Gwynn, .353). Burks finished third in the MVP voting. He also stole 32 bases that season, marking only the second time that two players from the same team collected at least 30 home runs and 30 steals, as Colorado outfielder Dante Bichette accomplished the feat. Burks remains in the top ten in many offensive categories for the Rockies.

While with the Rockies, Burks was part of the Blake Street Bombers that included Andrés Galarraga, Bichette, Larry Walker and Vinny Castilla. This was the heart of the Rockies&#x27; lineup that was second in the National League in home runs by team in 1994, then led the National League in home runs from 1995 to 1997.

Burks was traded to the San Francisco Giants in mid-season 1998 for Darryl Hamilton and Jim Stoops. In 2000, batting fifth behind Barry Bonds and Jeff Kent, he compiled numbers of .344, 24, 96, in only 122 games and 393 at bats. He won the 2000 Willie Mac Award for his spirit and leadership.

Burks was signed by the Cleveland Indians after the season. In his new role as a DH for the Indians, Burks provided consistent production in the middle-of-the-lineup, hitting .280, 28, 74 in 2001, and .301, 32, 91 in 2002. He sprained his wrist in spring training of 2003 and kept playing in 55 games until the muscles in his right hand affected his ability to swing the bat. Burks underwent season-ending surgery to repair nerve damage in his right elbow. The Indians did not pick up their 2004 contract option or offer him salary arbitration, and he returned to the Red Sox in 2004, playing eleven games without making the postseason roster. He retired at the end of the season with a World Series ring with the team that he began his career with.

In an 18-year career, Burks was a .291 hitter with 352 home runs, 1,206 runs batted in (RBI), 1,253 runs, 2,107 hits, 402 doubles, 63 triples, 181 stolen bases and 793 walks in 2,000 games. Defensively, Burks recorded a .983 fielding percentage playing at all three outfield positions.

==Post-playing career==
After the season, Burks joined the Indians&#x27; front office staff as a special assistant to the general manager.

In 2021, Burks joined NESN as a studio analyst and alternate color commentator for Red Sox games.

==Personal life==
Burks resides in Chagrin Falls, Ohio, and his son, Chris, played baseball in the San Francisco Giants organization. He also has three daughters, Carissa, Elisha, and Breanna. He met his wife, Dori, in Connecticut in 1985.

He is a cousin of fellow Major League outfielder Roosevelt Brown.

<doc id="932086" wikidata="Q14725165" url="?curid=932086" title="Harry Pierpont">
<text>Harry &quot;Pete&quot; Pierpont (October 13, 1902 – October 17, 1934) was a Prohibition era gangster, convicted murderer and bank robber. He was a friend and mentor to John Dillinger.

Described as handsome and soft-spoken, Pierpont was a bright, natural-born leader. Fiercely loyal, he had a reputation for taking care of those around him and not squealing on his friends. He disliked publicity, and was content to let others, especially Dillinger, take credit for the bold bank robberies committed after the Michigan City prison break.

Pierpont was executed in the electric chair on October 17, 1934.
==Early life==
Pierpont was born in Muncie, Indiana, to Joseph Gilbert and Lena (Orcutt) Pierpont. Harry Pierpont was the middle child with an older sister Fern (b. September 21, 1900), who died of tuberculosis when he was a teenager, and a younger brother Fred (b. July 5, 1906). His father was from Kentucky, and his mother, from Jay County, Indiana, was of German ancestry.
By the 1910 census, the family was residing at 1145 McLain Street in Indianapolis, Indiana, where Harry&#x27;s father&#x27;s occupation was listed as a woodworker at a carriage factory. In the 1911 and 1912 directories of the city of Indianapolis, the family was living at 1234 Lee Avenue.

Pierpont graduated from the eighth grade at Assumption School in Indianapolis. He had above-average intelligence and did well in school.

By the 1920 census, the family was residing at 2113 Morris Street in Indianapolis, Indiana, where Harry&#x27;s occupation was listed as a bench worker at an automobile plant.

Pierpont&#x27;s troubles with the police began after an accident in the summer of 1921, in which he received a severe head injury. His demeanor was changed after the accident, and Pierpont complained of eye problems, dizziness and headaches. Pierpont displayed bouts of sleeplessness and mania for firearms. He stood over six feet tall, with light brown hair and blue eyes. The second and third toes of his feet were grown together.

At his May 1925 trial in Kokomo, his place of residence was never clearly established. He was said to have lived in Fort Wayne, Toledo and Indianapolis, and was known to have hung around Kokomo for some time before the bank robbery was framed.

==Criminal career==

===Carrying concealed weapon, 1921===
In 1921 at Indianapolis, Pierpont was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon. He was held for ten days and then dismissed. Concurrently with his first arrest, Pierpont was committed to the state hospital.

In the Record of Inquest held on September 19, 1921, his mother states that he became sullen, suspicious, and prone to outbursts after his injury and, two days later, he was committed to the state hospital for the mentally ill, Central Indiana Hospital. Pierpont was diagnosed with dementia praecox of the hebephrenic type.

===Robbery of Cook Hardware Store, Greencastle, Indiana, January 1922===
On January 2, 1922, Pierpont stole an automobile in Indianapolis and drove to Greencastle, where he robbed the Cook Hardware store, stealing 9 handguns.

Five days later, Pierpont was arrested in Indianapolis for attempted auto theft and battery with intent to kill. The owners of the automobile, Mr. and Mrs. Devine, caught him in the act. Struggling with Mr. Devine, Pierpont fired a gun, slightly wounding him. Mrs. Devine was holding a roast, and hit Pierpont over the head with it.

While being held in jail at Terre Haute, Pierpont failed in an escape attempt, sawing through the bars of his cell.

===Sentenced to Indiana State Reformatory===
On March 12, 1922, Pierpont entered the Indiana reformatory for a two to fourteen-year sentence for assault and battery with intent to murder.

On November 17, 1923, Pierpont was transferred to the newly built reformatory at Pendleton, Indiana.

On May 1, 1923, Indiana Governor McCray denied Pierpont&#x27;s request for clemency.

The superintendent of the prison wrote that Harry was &quot;as wild as a March Hare.&quot;

====Parole granted, 1924====
Pierpont&#x27;s mother Lena often visited the superintendent and told him about Pierpont&#x27;s mental illness. Pierpont&#x27;s mother campaigned for his release, claiming that he was insane. The parole board granted him parole on March 6, 1924.

After his release, Pierpont worked in Brazil, Clay County, Indiana where, during his first stint in prison, his family had moved; his father operated a sand and gravel business for several months. He continued to associate with several known bank robbers, and may have robbed the Sourwine Theater in Brazil.

===Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern gang, 1924–1925===
By November 1924, Pierpont was living in Kokomo, Indiana staying at a boarding house run by Pearl Elliott. He continued to associate with a group of Jeffersonville ex-cons.

In April, 1925 Pierpont was implicated as ringleader of a gang that struck several Indiana banks. Newspaper reports indicated there were seven members of the gang, and all identified Pierpont as their leader.

Most members of the gang were arrested and convicted before Pierpont was arrested in Detroit in the spring. Mrs. Everett Bridgewater was arrested at her home in Indianapolis and sentenced to two to fourteen years; James Robbins arrested at Lebanon, Indiana; Marion &quot;Red&quot; Smith arrested at Indianapolis; George Frazer arrested at Marion; and Robert Morse arrested at Indianapolis were all given sentences of between ten and twenty years; and Mrs. Emily Morse pleaded guilty and was given a sentence from two to fourteen years. The round up of these bandits was reported as one of the biggest roundups of any gang of robbers in the state.

====South Marion State Bank, Marion, Indiana, November 26, 1924====
At 2:45 in the afternoon of November 26, 1924, seven men led by Pierpont held up the South Marion State Bank at Thirty-first and Washington streets in Marion, Indiana, robbing the bank of approximately $4,000 in cash. No one was injured, and not a shot was fired. Five men went inside, two stayed outside.

The leader of the gang walked in ahead of the others and ordered &quot;hands up&quot;, forcing the cashier and bookkeeper into the vault. According to newspaper accounts, the gang had evidently studied the situation, knew the surroundings, and carried out their job with clockwork precision and uncanny accuracy.

After the robbery, the men jumped into a purring Nash motor car and sped off going south. Sixteen towns in a fifty-mile radius of Marion were notified of the robbery and to be on the lookout for a Nash car with yellow license plates. One report had them heading west on State Route 35; another report had them travelling east through Bluffton, Indiana at high speed. A couple from Fairmount, Indiana reported seeing a car matching that of the robbers at three o&#x27;clock, traveling west through Hackelman, Indiana in the direction of Elwood, Indiana. Grant County Sheriff Bert Renbarger and his deputies stopped a Nash car matching the description at Sweetser, Indiana, but the occupants were found to be out of town businessmen.

Initial reports indicated that based on the description of the bandits, they were believed to be the same gang who had robbed the Farmers National Bank at Converse, Indiana the week before. Sheriff Renbarger speculated the robbers might be from South Bend, Terre Haute, Chicago, or Logansport.

====Citizens State Bank, Noblesville, Indiana, December 16, 1924====
Just before closing time on December 16, 1924, the men made an unsuccessful attempt to rob the Citizens State Bank. The bandits&#x27; car drove up to the side of the bank, and six men leaped to the sidewalk and ran into the building, brandishing revolvers.

While three robbers rushed to the rear of the bank to cover officials, the other three ordered several customers and the cashier to hold up their hands. The leader of the bandits repeatedly cautioned his associates to listen for an alarm. With a revolver near his head, bank President Dunn touched a button on the floor, which set off the burglar alarm. The bandits immediately ran out the door and sped away with nothing for their effort. The bandits raced north in a Cadillac bearing Indiana license plate 11829.

====Shelby Hardware Store, Lebanon, Indiana, December 22, 1924====
On December 22, 1924, the John D. Shelby Hardware Store of Lebanon, Indiana was robbed of two rifles, two double-barreled shotguns, a hammerless double-barreled shot gun, two single-shot rifles, a Marlin repeating rifle, two Remington repeating rifles, eight pocket knives, a six-inch barreled pistol, a German .32 automatic revolver, about fifty boxes of ammunition, four flashlights, several batteries, and other articles.

Boone County, Indiana Sheriff Joe C. Cain notified Grant County, Indiana Sheriff Renbarger of the list of items stolen from the Lebanon store and stated that the robbers were driving a Moon sedan with the license 443-554, which was stolen from Indianapolis the night of the Lebanon robbery. The automobile belonged to George W. Killinger Jr. of 1922 North Pennsylvania street in Indianapolis and had been reported stolen on December 22.

====Upland State Bank, Upland, Indiana, December 23, 1924====
At 3:45 in the afternoon of December 23, 1924, six armed bandits entered the Upland State Bank within fifteen minutes of closing time and robbed the bank of approximately $2,500

The bandits attempted to lock the cashier and a female employee in the bank vault. Finding that the safe would not work, they began scooping up all of the money in sight, as well as all the money in the safe, consisting of paper and silver. One of the bandits cautioned bank officials against making false moves under pain of having the &quot;hell shot out of them&quot;.

After getting all the money in sight, they quickly left the bank and hopped into a waiting automobile, in which the sixth bandit sat, and departed north out of Upland, where it was reported they turned west.

A good description of the men was secured by Deputy Sheriffs John Schell and Woody Smith, who had conversed with the six men at a filling station at Highland Avenue and Washington Street in Marion at about 2:30 in the afternoon that day. The men had been asking about the road to Hartford City and that they wanted to find State Road 35.

The men were first noticed in Marion driving a Moon car bearing the license plate number 443-554, which was seen driving the wrong way around the public square. The license number matched one that had been in town about a week before, when it ran a stop sign at Fourth and Nebraska Streets, and failed to stop when called on by the police.

Reports indicated that Sheriff Renbarger notified many surrounding cities and Indianapolis, as it was believed that the gang had a headquarters in that city and was the same crowd who attempted to hold up a bank at Noblesville, Indiana the week before.

The automobile used by the bandits of the Upland State Bank and the Lebanon hardware store was found abandoned in the mud at Kempton, Indiana on December 27, 1924. Authorities learned that the car had become mired in the mud around 7:30 on the evening of December 23. The men walked to a local home and called a garage at Kempton. The garage worker started to take the men to Frankfort, Indiana at their request. Carrying shotguns, rifles, revolvers, and satchels, the men changed their minds and asked to be dropped off at the edge of town at Lebanon. The men told the garage mechanic they had been out hunting and were from Louisville, Kentucky and wished to get home for Christmas.

No one ever came back for the car, and authorities were notified.

====Capture and confessions of Bandit Gang members====
Late Saturday evening, December 27, 1924, James Robbins, 22, of Lebanon, Indiana, was arrested by local police after being seen flashing a large amount of cash. Robbins confessed to his involvement in the Upland State Bank robbery, the attempted robbery at Noblesville, and the robbery of the Lebanon hardware store.

Robbins&#x27; confession led to the arrest on December 29, 1924, of William Behrens, 20, of Monticello, Indiana. Behrens, when brought to the Grant County jail, at first denied any involvement in the Upland, Marion or Noblesville robberies, but changed his story and admitted his involvement in the Upland robbery when identified by the cashier and another witness. Both men denied any involvement in the South Marion bank robbery.

Robbins confessed that on December 22, they had robbed the Shelby hardware store in Lebanon, then proceeded to Upland in a Moon car that had been stolen from Indianapolis the evening before. His share in the Upland robbery was between $300 and $400. He stated that after the Upland robbery the gang separated.

Behrens was identified by Deputy Sheriff Schell as being one of the men in the Moon car when it was stopped in Marion two hours before the Upland robbery. Behrens later confessed to Sheriff Renbarger of Grant County to his involvement in the Upland robbery, and told where he had hidden part of the money in Monticello.

On Tuesday, December 30, 1924, a third member of the gang, Marion &quot;Red&quot; Smith, 22, of Springfield, Illinois was arrested in Indianapolis. Smith had been tracked down by an operative of the Webster Detective Agency of Indianapolis, and was arrested after returning via train from Springfield to Indianapolis. Smith admitted to taking part in the Upland robbery, but denied being a part of the South Marion or Noblesville cases.

Information obtained from the three men indicated that the gang was planning a return attempt to rob the bank in Noblesville. Robbins spoke freely of his involvement and stated to the press that he became acquainted with all of the robbers while incarcerated at the Indiana State Reformatory.

Robbins and Behrens were arraigned December 30, 1924 in Grant County Circuit Court after 5 o&#x27;clock, where they entered guilty pleas, and were sentenced to ten to twenty years in the Indiana State Reformatory.

On Wednesday, December 31, 1924, Mrs. Mary Bridgewater, 29, was arrested in Indianapolis as an accomplice in the robbery of the South Marion bank. She denied having anything to do with the robbery, and claimed to not be with the gang when other robberies were committed. Mrs. Bridgewater had been visiting relatives in the southern part of Indiana and was not aware of the other arrests.

Mrs. Bridgewater did admit to being one of two women in the Nash car as it stood in front of the South Marion bank when it was held up. After the robbery, the group drove back to Indianapolis. Mrs. Bridgewater claimed that she did not receive any of the money from the robbery.

Marion &quot;Red&quot; Smith pleaded guilty in Grant County Circuit Court on December 31, 1924, and was sentenced to ten to twenty-five years for automobile banditry. Smith had just been released from the state reformatory five months prior, where he had been serving a term for vehicle theft.

On Friday, January 2, 1925, Robert Morse, 25, and his wife, Emily Morse, 27, of Indianapolis, were arrested by Sheriff Bert Renbarger and operatives from the Webster Detective Agency as part of the gang. Morse and his wife both admitted to being part of the gang of seven people, five men and two women, who took part in the South Marion robbery, but denied being a part of the gang at Upland or Noblesville. Morse claimed that he only received $153, instead of the $600 promised, as his share of the South Marion robbery. He admitted that the gang&#x27;s original plan was to rob a bank in Hartford City, but the gang changed their mind and headed to Marion instead on November 26. Mrs. Morse, in contrast to Mrs. Bridgewater, admitted that she knew that the men intended to rob the bank.

On January 4, 1925, James Robbins, William Behrens, and Marion &quot;Red&quot; Smith were taken to the Indiana Reformatory to begin serving their sentences.

On January 10, 1925, George R. Frazer, 23, of Kokomo, was turned into the Marion police by his father as being part of the bandit gang who robbed the South Marion and Upland banks. Frazer stated that Mary Bridgewater and Emily Morse knew all about the robberies, and that Mrs. Bridgewater had scouted out the South Marion bank by cashing a check just before the robbery. On the morning of November 26, four men, whom he knew from prison, picked him up in Kokomo and told him they were looking for some place to &quot;stick up&quot;, but hadn&#x27;t decided on a city.

Frazer was taken to the courthouse, a warrant was sworn out, he pleaded guilty to auto banditry, and was given a sentence of between ten and twenty-five years at the Indiana Reformatory.

====New Harmony Bank and Trust, New Harmony, Indiana, March 10, 1925====

Shortly before four o&#x27;clock on March 10, 1925, four unmasked bandits walked into the New Harmony Bank and Trust in New Harmony, and robbed it of $10,000. The bandits locked the employees and customers into the safe and took $6,000 in cash and $4,000 in bonds from the vault.

When the bank treasurer, Frank Steelman, failed to open the safe, he was hit with the butt of a pistol and suffered a severe scalp injury. The assistant cashier, Mrs. Schultz, opened the safe and then fainted.

The bandits escaped in a grey Hudson sedan in the direction of Evansville, being last seen near Wadesville.

A farmer near Griffin, Indiana reported that the men held him up and was commanded to tell them where they could obtain a boat to cross the Wabash River.

By March 11, reports had the gang spotted at King, Indiana in Gibson County. Peace officers throughout the midwest were wired descriptions of the men and advised to take no chances. Guards were placed along every road in southern Indiana with orders to &#x27;shoot to kill&#x27;.

Fort Wayne police were also investigating the gang&#x27;s involvement in the robbery of an A &amp; P store on March 21, 1925.

====Stopped by police in Kokomo, Indiana, March 22, 1925====
On March 22, 1925, Earl Northern, along with Everett Bridgewater, was arrested by Kokomo, Indiana police on suspicion of possessing a stolen car. The certificate of title was in the name of Lester Isaacs of Indianapolis. However, the possession of the Ford roadster they were driving was found to be legitimate and they were released. This car was later identified as one that was used in the getaway from the South Kokomo bank robbery.

Pierpont later visited local attorney C.T. Brown, along with Dewey Elliott and Pearl Mullendore after midnight on March 22, 1925, to explain that two of his friends had been detained at the police station and needed representation. Pierpont, using the alias Mason, refused to give the names of his friends who were detained, but gave him a gold certificate worth $100.00. In the morning, the attorney learned that the suspects had been picked up for auto theft but had later been released.

====South Side State Bank, Kokomo, Indiana, March 27, 1925====
At 1:30 in the afternoon of March 27, 1925, five armed bandits entered the South Side Bank at Kokomo, Indiana in a bold daylight holdup. The bandits made off with $4,828.40 in cash and $4,300.00 in Liberty bonds. Escaping in a blue Moon touring car, the bandits were witnessed by local resident, J.E. Fernung, switching their car for two Ford cars, which then headed south.

Initial reports stated that an additional $2,000.00 in non-negotiable securities had been stolen as well. Three local young men, who witnessed the robbery, reported that they did not raise the alarm because an apparent lookout eyed them closely while they were at the store across from the bank. The lookout quickly disappeared into the crowd after the robbery. The robbery took fifteen minutes, and after cleaning out the bank of valuables, the bandits calmly walked to their car.

The bank cashier, A.E. Gorton, reported that three bandits entered the bank, forced the employees to a back room, and while one bandit guarded them, the other two gathered all the money in sight. A gun was put to Gorton&#x27;s head and he was forced to open the vault. Gorton, who had difficulty with the safe&#x27;s combination, angered the bandit, who threatened &quot;to blow his brains out.&quot;

While the bandits were working, a local resident, Vernon Shaw, entered the bank and was quickly relieved of the $18 he was carrying. &quot;Speedy&quot;, a small terrier, boldly attacked a burglar&#x27;s ankle, but was kicked into the basement. The bandits tore the telephone from the wall, broke a shotgun and took away the extra cartridges.

The blue Moon car used in the robbery was reported stolen the night before from Fort Wayne, yet bore the license plate of a Chrysler Phateon reported stolen in Indianapolis on March 11. The vehicle was located six miles east of town with the rear riddled with bullets. The automobile was owned by Barrett M. Woodsmall of Indianapolis.

====Laketon State Bank, Laketon, Indiana, March 31, 1925====
Early on the morning of March 31, 1925, the Laketon State Bank in Laketon, Indiana was robbed by two unmasked burglars. Taking between $1,000 and $1,800 in cash, the bandits overlooked several thousand dollars in bonds.

Reports of the bandits tracked them fleeing in two autos to Warsaw, Indiana but failed to generate new leads. Due to the similarity of the robberies and its location, Pierpont and his gang were suspected.

Wabash County Sheriff Summerland went to Marion in response to call from the Grant County sheriff. Other clues had the bandits stopping in Lagrange County, Indiana, where there were reports of three men in a Willys-Knight car.

At 9 o&#x27;clock in the morning, two youthful robbers, armed with revolvers, walked into the bank and looted the cash drawers while holding the cashier and assistant cashier at bay. After leaving the bank, they sped away in a Ford touring car and headed north before any alarm could be given.

The Laketon bank cashier gave a description of the robbers and stated they were driving a Willys-Knight car. It was ascertained that the license plate on the Willys-Knight car had been stolen from a Buick car the previous week in Fort Wayne. The plates belonged to a salesman from Lagrange who worked out of Fort Wayne, and were reported stolen the week before. The license plate numbers used by the bandits were discovered by a farmer, who lived near where the bandits had left the Willys-Knight and where they returned in their Ford coupe after they had stolen the money. The Ford touring car was stolen in Milford, Indiana.

However, the cashier of the bank, E.L. Bright, and the assistant cashier, Mrs. Violet Ogden, later failed to identify Pierpont after his arrest in Detroit.

===Arrest in Detroit, Michigan, 1925===
Pierpont, along with Thaddeus &quot;Ted&quot; Skeer and Skeer&#x27;s girlfriend, Louise Brunner, were arrested by the Detroit police at their apartment on April 2, 1925. Pierpont was alleged to be the leader in the robbing of the South Marion, Upland and South Kokomo Bank. At his arrest, Pierpont gave his name as Frank Mason, but later in the day admitted his identity. Revolvers and guns were found under the pillows, in the closets and drawers of the bureaus. Harry was found to have $850 in new $100 and $50 bills on his person, and Brunner had a number of diamond rings and other jewelry, while one report indicated this amount was found on Skeer.

Other reports indicated that $4,000 in cash was found on Pierpont, with securities totaling $5,400 recovered in the apartment. Reports indicated that Pierpont, alias Mason, was wanted in Marion for the robbery of the Upland State Bank and the South Marion State Bank.

Police were tipped off to Skeer&#x27;s involvement when it was learned that the auto used in the Kokomo robbery had been stolen from Fort Wayne a few days before. Skeer had been suspected in the automobile theft, and when the robbery was reported, police began working on the theory that Skeer was involved.

The three prisoners waived extradition and warrants charging petit larceny and bank robbery charging Pierpont and Skeer had been issued by Kokomo city judge Joseph Cripe. Reports indicated Howard County prosecutor Howard Miller would pursue habitual criminal charges against both men, which would carry life sentences.

Skeer had been sentenced from Allen County, Indiana in 1917 to the state penal farm on a charge of larceny.

The Indiana Bankers Association had been looking for Pierpont since the robbery of the Grant County banks and had been on his trail for some time. Captain William Pappert of the Fort Wayne police department had reported that Skeer had been seen at the Brunner woman&#x27;s home with a large sum of money. When it was learned that Brunner intended to travel to Detroit to meet Skeer, detectives followed her to the apartment shared by Skeer and Pierpont where the arrests occurred. Skeer and Brunner were arrested when they met in the city, and Pierpont&#x27;s arrest occurred a short time later.

Initial reports in the Marion newspaper could not verify that suspect Everett Bridgewater had also been arrested. Bridgewater&#x27;s wife, Mary, had previously been arrested in connection with the gang&#x27;s activities and was serving a term at the Indianapolis women&#x27;s prison.

On April 3, James Roscoe &quot;Whitey&quot; Hayes, a third suspect, was also arrested by the Detroit police, but later released. Conflicting reports indicated that Hayes was wanted in Detroit as a material witness in a murder case.

In Detroit, Pierpont, Skeer and Hayes were all positively identified by A.E. Gorton, cashier of the South Kokomo bank; &quot;Chic&quot; Nelson, golf professional at the country club, and Vernon Shaw. It was Nelson who identified Hayes, a locally known singer, which allowed detectives to put the pieces together in tracking the members of the gang. Hayes had been identified by cashier Gorton as the bandit who stood in the doorway of the South Kokomo bank as it was robbed.

It was determined by the Kokomo police that members of the gang had been in the city for several weeks prior to the robbery of the South Kokomo bank. Pierpont, Skeer and Hayes were known to have rooms with Mrs. Pearl Mullendore at 718 North Main Street. Mullendore was more frequently known as Pearl Elliott, a notorious Kokomo madam, who would figure prominently in Harry&#x27;s later career with Dillinger.

Members of the gang reportedly threw wild parties in Kokomo and Anderson, Indiana, where they displayed large sums of money to their women and spent &quot;like drunken sailors&quot;.

Pierpont and Skeer were extradited to Kokomo for trial and held in the Howard county jail. They were brought back to Kokomo under heavy guard, coming from Detroit to Peru by train and then on to Kokomo by auto.

====Escape attempt, Howard County, Indiana jail====
Police denied reports that Skeer confessed to the Kokomo holdup in order to spare his sweetheart, Louise Brunner. In his confession, it was alleged that he implicated Pierpont in the Kokomo, Noblesville, Upland and Marion bank robberies.

While being held in the Howard County jail in Kokomo, an escape attempt by Harry and Skeer was thwarted with the discovery of ten saw blades in the cells. Pierpont had reportedly boasted when captured in Detroit that he would never be held for trial.

Pinkerton operative, F.C. Huntington, found the saws when the prisoners were being examined in city court. One bar in Skeer&#x27;s cell had been severed. Four saw blades had been used, and a bar in Pierpont&#x27;s cell was found partially severed.

Harry&#x27;s brother, Fred, was arrested on charges of aiding his brother&#x27;s escape attempt, but was later acquitted of the charges.

====Trial, Howard County, Indiana Circuit Court====
Pierpont&#x27;s parents came to Kokomo from their home in Brazil, Indiana on Saturday, April 4, 1925 and arranged with the firm of Overman &amp; Healy and Carl Bree to look after the interests of Harry when arraigned and to defend him in his upcoming trial. Pierpont&#x27;s attorneys did not yet admit that his name was anything other than Frank Mason, the alias given in Detroit.

On April 5, 1925, Pierpont and Skeer were taken into city court in Kokomo, where Howard County prosecutor Homer Miller announced to City Judge Joe Cripe that by agreement between him and the attorneys for the prisoners, the preliminary hearing might be set for Thursday (April 9) afternoon, and the judge agreed. Prosecutor Miller expected the prisoners to be bound over to the Howard circuit court, bonds to be fixed and a hearing held before Judge John Marshall.

Howard County Sheriff Joseph Lindley adamantly denied reports that Pierpont and Skeer would be spirited away to another jail for safekeeping, presumably the Pendleton reformatory. Local reports indicated that citizens were concerned the ancient jail would be inadequate to hold experienced criminals Sheriff Lindley kept Pierpont and Skeer under heavy guard and denied visitors to the cellhouse for fear of a jail delivery.

Fort Wayne police reported that there was strong evidence that the trio of Pierpont, Skeer and Hayes were involved in the holdup of the A &amp; P store there on March 21, 1925.

On April 6, 1925, Louise Brunner of Fort Wayne, held as a material witness and girlfriend of Skeer, was released under bond and allowed to return to her mother.

Bond for the bank bandits was set at the sum of $10,000 each, and attorney C.T. Brown was engaged to defend Skeer.

On May 6, 1925, Pierpont took the stand and in a surprise defense move, practically admitted to all the evidence contained in Skeer&#x27;s confession. Pierpont told of entering and holding up the bank and then fleeing to Fort Wayne, where the loot was divided between him and three others. However, Pierpont stated that Skeer was the planner of the robbery.

Pierpont was convicted and sentenced to serve a sentence of ten to twenty-one years, and fined $1000.00.

===Sentenced to Indiana State Reformatory, Pendleton, Indiana===
Found guilty, he was sent back to Pendleton and entered the Indiana Reformatory for the second time on May 6, 1925. He defied authorities by giving the wrong name, refusing to recognize the warden, declining to make a statement or having his picture taken, and spitting on a guard.

It was here that he first met John Dillinger and Homer Van Meter. In Pendleton, Pierpont was the convict Dillinger looked up to the most. Pierpont caused the Pendleton Warden, A.F. Miles, so much trouble that he was transferred to the Indiana State Prison at Michigan City within two months, after he attempted to drill through the bars of his cell in an escape attempt. Dillinger and Van Meter were later transferred within the next few years to Michigan City.

===Transferred to Indiana State Prison, Michigan City, Indiana===
Entering Michigan City on July 30, 1925, he became one of the most respected convicts (by other convicts) in the prison. He soon became the leader of an elite group of former bank robbers. Forever trying to escape, Pierpont constantly fought with the guards and was frequently confined to solitary confinement. He was known for his ability to withstand hunger and beatings. Pierpont headed a prison clique that included Russell Clark, Charles Makley, John &quot;Red&quot; Hamilton and Dillinger, after his July 1929 transfer. Harry&#x27;s ability to endure hunger and beatings won him the respect of all the prisoners.

It was from these men that Dillinger learned the crime of bank robbery, and by 1933, with a parole for Dillinger, an escape plan was concocted. With Dillinger on the outside, he would rob several banks on a list composed by Pierpont and Makley, and with that money, help finance the escape.

====Escape attempt, December 29, 1930====
On December 29, 1930, Pierpont was among a group of 12 men, led by Joseph Burns, who overpowered guard Guy Burklow and barricaded the doors of their cell block to prevent guards from entering. Pierpont let himself out of his cell with a homemade key.

Burklow was able to sound the alarm, and a combined group of city police, fireman and guards were able to force the inmates to surrender. Burns had fashioned a key from a spoon, allowing the inmates to escape their cells. All the men were in Cell House D, and the break occurred at a time when the guard force was limited.

Others involved in the scheme besides Burns and Pierpont were Albert Roseberg, James Jenkins, Dick Day, Howard Ware, Maurice Delature, Frank Badgley, Louis West, Wayne Williams, Willard Tex, Russell Clark, all of whom were serving long sentences for murder, bank robbery and other habitual offenses.

==Breakout from Michigan City==
In the summer of 1932, Pierpont began to make plans for the greatest prison break in Indiana history. Pierpont&#x27;s fellow conspirators were Charles Makley, John &quot;Red&quot; Hamilton, and Russell Clark. This operation would depend on accomplices on the outside who had money for guns, bribes and a hideout. It would also need someone on the inside who was dependable who was about to be released. Pierpont approached John Dillinger about helping them to escape. In return, he would be offered the opportunity to join their bank-robbing team.

The group reportedly gave Dillinger the list of the best banks and stores to rob, as well as the names of reliable accomplices. He would know almost as much as they did about bank robbery. Dillinger agreed, but insisted that James Jenkins be included in the break.

In late 1932, Walter Dietrich joined Pierpont&#x27;s group. He began to reveal the detailed techniques of the remarkable bank robber, Herman Lamm. By the spring of 1933, the plan was set.

Pierpont was aided on the outside by his girlfriend Mary Kinder, who agreed to help with the break-out if her brother, Earl Northern, was added to the list of escapees. Mary&#x27;s brother, Earl Northern, was Pierpont&#x27;s old partner. Pearl Elliott, the Kokomo madam who had been involved in Pierpont&#x27;s Kokomo robbery, was to get money to those who would bribe prison guards.

===Request for clemency, August 1933===

The Indiana state clemency commission heard Pierpont&#x27;s appeal to be released from the state prison under the contention that he was a man of strong character and a &quot;leader and not a follower&quot; on August 24, 1933.

Briefs filed highlighted the fact that when Pierpont was sentenced to the state prison in May 1925, he told authorities that he would try to escape and it was their duty to prevent it. Subsequently, he made three escape attempts. In 1931, Pierpont announced that he would be a model prisoner and it was contended he has been such since that time.

The commission was informed that Pierpont&#x27;s record included two previous convictions. In his time in prison, he had received 10 punishments, two reprimands and one merit braid.

The commission denied Pierpont&#x27;s request for clemency.

On September 13, 1933, three loaded revolvers, wrapped in Chicago newspapers, were found near the west wall of the prison by two prisoners. Prisoners Danny McGeogehan, Jack Gray and Eddie Murphy were believed to be connected and ordered into solitary confinement. Dillinger had tossed these pistols over the wall, and were intended for Pierpont and his conspirators.

===Successful escape===
On September 25, 1933, Pierpont, Russell Clark, Makley, and Hamilton conferred during the exercise period and decided to crash out on the next day. Each man swore an oath not to be recaptured without a fight.

The next morning, Pierpont, Makley, Hamilton, Russell Clark, Walter Dietrich, James &quot;Oklahoma Jack&quot; Clark, Edward Shouse, Joseph Fox, Joe Burns, and Jim Jenkins escaped from Michigan City, using three .45 caliber pistols Dillinger had smuggled into the jail. The escape had been carefully planned before Dillinger&#x27;s parole by Pierpont, Hamilton and Dillinger. Dillinger had spent the summer of 1933 robbing banks throughout Indiana and Ohio to raise enough money to smuggle the guns into the prison. How he smuggled the guns in is unknown: some accounts say that Dillinger tossed the weapons over the wall like he did on his previous attempt. The most widely believed theory is that Dillinger hid the guns in boxes of thread sent to the prison shirt factory.

After two o&#x27;clock that afternoon, Pierpont and Russell Clark told shirt factory superintendent George H. Stevens that one of the officials needed to see him in the basement. Stevens was soon overpowered by the rest of the gang. Walter Dietrich sought out deputy superintendent Albert E. Evans, telling him that a fight was in progress, leading him into the trap as well. Evans was greeted by seven men with pistols and three with clubs. Foreman Dudley Triplett came to the basement for supplies and was soon captured.

Pierpont had received severe punishment at the hands of Deputy Evans while in prison, and now was prepared to exact revenge. Dietrich stopped him from killing him and letting the whole prison know what was happening.

The convicts took their hostages and began to walk carefully to freedom. Stevens led the way, with Dietrich on his left side and Hamilton on his right, their guns concealed beneath the stacks of shirts they were carrying. The other men picked up a steel shaft and followed. Though they walked almost the entire length of the prison, the guards and other prisoners paid no attention to what was happening.

When they arrived at the first steel gate, Stevens told guard Frank Swanson to open the gate because the prisoners were armed and would kill if he didn&#x27;t. Swanson was forced to join the procession. After proceeding through a second and they came to the third gate, where they used the steel shaft as a battering ram. Guard Fred Wellnitz was beaten, and Guard Guy Burklow was forced to open the outer gate.

Now the prisoners were in the lobby of the administration building, where they herded eight civilian clerks into the vaults. Seventy-two-year-old Finley Carson was shot in the leg and shoulder by Burns for not moving fast enough. Warden Louis E. Kunkel happened upon the group, and he was quickly made a prisoner as well.

Outside the gate, it was every man for himself. It was raining hard. The escaped prisoners ended up splitting into two groups. The first group included Dietrich, James Clark, Fox and Burns. The second group included Pierpont, Hamilton, Russell Clark, Makley, Shouse and Jenkins.

With the alarm sounding, the Dietrich group encountered Sheriff Charles Neel, who had just dropped off some prisoners. Overpowering him, they took his weapons, and forced him to take three of them in his automobile.

At a gas station outside the prison, attendant Joe Pawleski was struck over the head by the Pierpont group. The group commandeered another vehicle, releasing two women but forcing the driver to continue. They headed west for a few miles, hiding in a farmhouse around 2:30 p.m.

The convicts in Sheriff Neel&#x27;s car purchased gas at Burdick, Indiana, about 20 miles west of Michigan City. The group abandoned the sheriff&#x27;s car near Wheeler, Indiana, after carjacking another motorist. The group roared off with the sheriff still their prisoner.

At almost midnight, Mary Kinder answered a knock at her door in Indianapolis and found Pierpont standing there. She immediately asked about her brother, Earl Northern. Northern was originally part of the escapee plan, but was ill in the infirmary at the time of the break. Mary had arranged a place for the escapees to stay at the home of Ralph Saffell, her reluctant boyfriend. The convicts sent Saffell and Mary downtown to buy civilian clothes.

Pearl Elliott soon arrived at the Saffell home and brought money. The convicts were ready to begin taking banks on their own, only to discover that Dillinger had been arrested in Dayton, Ohio four days before the escape, and was being detained in the Allen County jail in Lima. The gang soon hatched a plan to free Dillinger.

The next evening, the gang was joined by Michigan City parolee Harry Copeland, Dillinger&#x27;s partner before the arrest, who told the gang he had arranged for a house at 1054 South Second Street in Hamilton, Ohio. However, the hideout would not be ready for a few more days but he had found them temporary refuge.

When their hideout in Hamilton was ready, the group abandoned their car in Indianapolis and stole another to hide their tracks. Indiana State Police Captain Matt Leach became aware of the theft, and threw up a blockade that almost resulted in the gang&#x27;s capture. During an attempt to getaway from the police, the door of their auto opened and James Jenkins fell out. The gang had to speed on, unable to wait on Jenkins, eventually stealing another vehicle before reaching their Ohio hideout. Jenkins was later killed that evening by a local posse near Beanblossom, Indiana.

The gang hid out at the farm of Pierpont&#x27;s parents near Leipsic, Ohio as well as their hideout in Hamilton.

==Pierpont&#x27;s tenure with Dillinger==

===First National Bank, St. Mary&#x27;s Ohio, October 3, 1933===
While in Hamilton, Pierpont realized that the group needed more money to help bust Dillinger out. Makley suggested they rob the First National Bank in his hometown of St. Mary&#x27;s, Ohio, only a few miles away from Lima. Mary Kinder rejoined the gang and agreed to travel permanently with Pierpont.

On the morning of October 3, exactly one week after their escape, while the gang began loading into two cars for the robbery, Harry Copeland claimed he was too sick to drive, and Mary Kinder was asked if she would drive the second car for an equal share.

At 2:40 p.m., Makley entered the bank with Pierpont and Clark while Hamilton and Shouse waited nearby. The robbery netted almost $11,000. The bank had been closed by the Treasury Department, but had cash on hand to facilitate its re-opening. The gang had to wash and dry the money a number of times to eliminate the &quot;new&quot; feel of the bills in order to pass them.

On October 5, Ralph Saffell revealed the details of the gang&#x27;s stay at his Indianapolis cottage to Matt Leach. Leach raided Mary Kinder&#x27;s apartment, but was infuriated by the nonsensical answers given by her younger sister, Margaret Behrens.

On October 10, Pierpont brought Dillinger&#x27;s girlfriend Billie Frechette to Ohio. He found an apartment in Cincinnati for her and Mary. The next day the men left for Lima.

===Rescue of John Dillinger from Allen County Jail, October 12, 1933===
The gang arrived in Lima on Columbus Day. Pierpont and Clark approached a local attorney about getting Dillinger&#x27;s &quot;sister&quot; into the jail for a visit. When the attorney told them he would talk to the sheriff the next day, the gang knew they had to act fast.

Pierpont, Makley and Clark entered the jail around 6:25 p.m., while Shouse, Hamilton, and Dillinger&#x27;s first partner Harry Copeland remained outside as a lookout. The gang members confronted Sheriff Jess Sarber, claiming to be Indiana State Prison officials and were there to return Dillinger to Indiana. When Sarber requested their credentials, Pierpont fired two shots, hitting Sarber once in the abdomen. Makley and Pierpont then beat Sarber, demanding the keys to Dillinger&#x27;s cell. While Sarber refused, his wife dug the keys out of a drawer in order to stop the beating. The gang then freed Dillinger, locked up Sarber&#x27;s wife and Deputy Wilbur Sharp, and the group escaped. Sarber died about ninety minutes later.

===Days with the &quot;Terror Gang&quot;===
Matt Leach suspected that Dillinger&#x27;s rescue was related to the Michigan City jailbreak. He also suspected Pierpont was the &quot;brains&quot; behind the operations. Leach attempted to inspire friction in the ranks of the gang. During news interviews, he made a point of calling them the &quot;Dillinger Gang&quot;, instead of the &quot;Pierpont Gang&quot;. The ruse backfired, as Pierpont couldn&#x27;t have cared less what people called the gang.

The search for the gang in Ohio had become so intense that, two days after freeing Dillinger, they decided to split into two groups and meet in Chicago.

====Police station raids====
On October 14, 1933, Dillinger, Pierpont, and Walter Dietrich raided the Auburn, Indiana police station for guns and bulletproof vests.

Dillinger and Van Meter had posed as tourists at the Peru, Indiana police station prior to Dillinger&#x27;s arrest to scout out their arsenal. At about 10:00 p.m. on October 20, 1933, Dillinger, Pierpont and Dietrich raided the Peru, Indiana police station for more guns and bulletproof vests.

Officials now believed that the gang had declared war on the law, with some predicting the gang would break into the reformatory to enlist an army. The Indiana National Guard was put at the disposal of the state police, and volunteer posses were formed throughout the state.

Meanwhile, the gang was quietly staying in expensive apartments in Chicago.

====Central National Bank, Greencastle, Indiana, October 23, 1933====
Plans for the gang&#x27;s first major robbery—of the Central National Bank in Greencastle—and escape routes had been sketched out by Pierpont. Makley scouted the area and learned it was homecoming weekend for DePauw University, and the robbery was planned for Monday, October 23.

At 2:45 p.m., a large Studebaker parked on a hill next to the bank and four men walked into the bank: Dillinger, Pierpont, Makley, and Copeland or Clark. Pierpont headed for one of the cages to change a $20 bill. When the teller told him to go to another window, Pierpont pulled his tommy gun out. The other gang members pulled out their guns and began cleaning money from the vaults. Witnesses clearly identified Pierpont as the leader of the robbers. Five minutes later, the robbery was over, and the gang walked out with $74,000 in cash and bonds, without firing a shot. They were so quiet that no one at the police station across the street knew what had happened.

====American Bank &amp; Trust Company, Racine, Wisconsin, November 20, 1933====
With the Indiana State Police after them, the gang hid out in Chicago, with Dillinger, Pierpont, Mary Kinder and Billie Frechette sharing a flat at 4310 Clarendon Avenue. The gang moved freely about Chicago.

On November 16, one day after Dillinger and Frechette had escaped an attempted police ambush, the gang made the final details for the robbery of a bank in Racine, Wisconsin. At the same time, Copeland&#x27;s drinking and Shouse&#x27;s womanizing were causing friction within the gang. That afternoon, Pierpont, Makley and Mary Kinder drove to the American Bank &amp; Trust Company in Racine. Mary changed a bill while she cased the bank, and the gang then drove around exploring the best getaway routes.

Returning to Chicago, Pierpont suggested to the gang that Copeland be dropped as the driver and Shouse put in his place. Shouse had other plans to rob a bank on his own, and Mary Kinder overheard Shouse trying to convince Hamilton to join him. That evening the gang decided to get rid of Shouse, and the next morning they threw money at him and threw him out. On his way out, Shouse stole Clark&#x27;s car and headed to California.

The morning of the robbery, the gang read in the paper about Copeland&#x27;s arrest the evening before.

At 2:30 PM on November 20, Pierpont walked into the bank, carrying a Red Cross poster. He pasted it over the front window to block the view of the teller cages from the street. Makley, Dillinger and Hamilton then entered the bank, and Makley yelled &quot;stick &#x27;em up&quot; at one teller who was on the phone. When the teller, Harold Graham, failed to comply, Makley shot him in the elbow. As Graham fell, bleeding, he set off the alarm connected to the police station.

Pierpont ordered everyone in the lobby to lie on the ground while Dillinger marched the bank president, the cashier and his assistant into the main vault at gunpoint. While the cashiers struggled with opening the vault, two police officers responded to the alarm. Pierpont got the jump on one, and Makley shot the other, wounding him. With the vault cleaned out, Dillinger and Pierpont rounded up the cops, three female hostages and a bank president as hostages. Using the hostages as shields, the gang marched out to their car, taking a woman, the bank president and an officer with them. Makley also shot at two detectives who had responded. A few blocks later, when the car ran into traffic, the officer was tossed off the running board.

After safely leaving town with their hostages, the gang took the bank president and the female hostage to the woods, where they bound them loosely together. The gang asked them to stay there for twenty minutes.

====Hiding out in Daytona Beach, Florida====
Due to the unwelcome attention generated by their crimes and an incident where Hamilton killed a CPD detective, the gang and their women took a long vacation at a beach house in Daytona Beach, Florida, highlighted by a New Year&#x27;s Eve barbecue which was climaxed by Dillinger emptying his Thompson submachine gun at the moon at the stroke of midnight.

====First National Bank, East Chicago, Indiana, January 15, 1934====
On January 15, 1934, Dillinger and Hamilton robbed the First National Bank in East Chicago, Indiana. Pierpont waited in the car while the other two emerged with the money and hostages. They faced several cops who had taken up positions outside. One officer, William O&#x27;Malley, fired at Dillinger, but failed to injure him, as Dillinger was wearing a bulletproof vest. Dillinger returned fire, killing O&#x27;Malley. The other officers opened fire as Dillinger and Hamilton ran for the car, and Hamilton was wounded.

==Downfall and arrest==
Heading out west to lie low, Pierpont, Dillinger, Makley, and Clark ended up in Tucson, Arizona. Flush with cash and careless, the gang made several minor mistakes which led to their being recognized and captured, one by one, on January 25, 1934. All four men and their girlfriends were extradited back to the Midwest; Dillinger to Indiana for O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s murder, the other three to Ohio for Sheriff Sarber&#x27;s murder.

===Trial, Allen County Circuit Court, 1934===
Testimony from Shouse, one of the first members of the Dillinger gang, helped convict the others. In early March 1934, Pierpont, Makley and Clark were convicted of the murder. While Clark got a life sentence, Pierpont and Makley were sentenced to die in the electric chair.

After Dillinger stunned the country by breaking out of the jail at Crown Point, Indiana with a wooden gun on March 3, 1934, it was suspected that he would try to break his pals out of the death house in Columbus, Ohio. Elaborate precautions were taken to keep Pierpont and Makley locked up, on the assumption that Dillinger would show, but he didn&#x27;t, as he had teamed up with Baby Face Nelson.

===Fatal escape attempt===
With Dillinger&#x27;s death at the hands of the FBI on July 22, 1934, and time running out for them, Makley and Pierpont resorted to other means to get off death row: they would try to duplicate their old friend&#x27;s feat.

On September 22, 1934, exactly two months after Dillinger&#x27;s death, Pierpont and Makley carved phony pistols out of soap cakes, and painted them black with shoe polish, and made their move. Brandishing the toys, they managed to get out of their cells and to the main door of the death house before rifle-wielding guards opened fire. Makley was mortally wounded and Pierpont was riddled with bullets. Although he survived, he was seriously injured.

===Execution===

Pierpont was executed at the Ohio Penitentiary on October 17, 1934. Still suffering from injuries incurred during his attempted escape, he had to be carried to the electric chair where he was successfully put to death, and pronounced dead at 12:14 a.m. His death certificate lists his age as 32 years and 4 days, with a date of birth of October 13, 1902 in Muncie, Indiana.

His occupation was listed as former engineer and his marital status was given as &quot;married.&quot; His mother, Lena Pierpont, of R.R. 2, Lakeville, Indiana was the informant.

He is buried in the Holy Cross and St. Joseph Cemetery in Indianapolis, Indiana.

<doc id="932089" wikidata="Q1427906" url="?curid=932089" title="Variable displacement pump">
<text>A variable displacement pump is a device that converts mechanical energy to hydraulic (fluid) energy. The displacement, or amount of fluid pumped &quot;per revolution of the pump&#x27;s input shaft&quot; can be varied while the pump is running.

Many variable displacement pumps are &quot;reversible&quot;, meaning that they can act as a hydraulic motor and convert fluid energy into mechanical energy.

==Types==
A common type of variable-displacement pump used in vehicle technology is the axial piston pump. This pump has several pistons in cylinders arranged parallel to each other and rotating around a central shaft. A swashplate at one end is connected to the pistons. As the pistons rotate, the angle of the plate causes them to move in and out of their cylinders. A rotary valve at the opposite end from the swashplate alternately connects each cylinder to the fluid supply and delivery lines. By changing the angle of the swashplate, the stroke of the pistons can be varied continuously. If the swashplate is perpendicular to the axis of rotation, no fluid will flow. If it is at a sharp angle, a large volume of fluid will be pumped. Some pumps allow the swashplate to be moved in both directions from the zero position, pumping fluid in either direction without reversing the rotation of the pump.

An efficient variation is the bent axis pump. Bending the axis reduces side loads on the pistons.

Piston pumps can be made variable-displacement by inserting springs inline with the pistons. The displacement is not positively controlled, but decreases as back-pressure increases.

Another variation is the variable-displacement vane pump, a type that has found usage in motor vehicle automatic transmissions, such as the General Motors Hydra-Matic.

Torontál county was located in the Banat region. From its recreation in 1779 until its partition in 1920 it shared borders with the Hungarian counties of Bács-Bodrog, Csongrád, Csanád, Arad and Temes.

The Banat Military Frontier lay along its southern border until it was abolished in 1873, after which the river Danube formed its southern border, which it shared with the Principality of Serbia (Kingdom of Serbia after 1882), and the Slavonian Military Frontier (Croatian-Slavonian county of Syrmia after 1881). 

The river Tisza formed its western border and the river Maros (Mureș) its northern border. The rivers Aranca, Bega, Timiș and Bârzava flowed through the county. Its area was around 1910.

==History==

Torontál county was formed before the 15th century. Initially, the capital was at Aracs/Vranjevo (now a part of the town of Novi Bečej), and the county existed until this area was taken by the Ottoman Empire in 1552. During Ottoman administration, this territory was included into the Ottoman Province of Temeşvar. After Banat was captured by the Habsburg monarchy in 1718, the area was included into the Banat of Temeswar. This province was abolished in 1778 and it was incorporated into the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary. Torontal county was restored in 1779, with significantly different borders than in medieval times. Its center was moved temporarily to Nagyszentmiklós (present-day Sânnicolau Mare) between 1807 and 1820 due to a great fire in Nagybecskerek (present-day Zrenjanin). 
In 1848/1849 the area of the county was claimed by the self-proclaimed Serbian Voivodship, while between 1849 and 1860 it was part of the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar, a separate Austrian crownland. After 1853, the county did not exist since the voivodeship was divided into districts. After the voivodeship was abolished in 1860, the area was reincorporated into the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary and the county was recreated in January 1861. In 1876, when the administrative structure of the Kingdom of Hungary was changed, the borders of Torontal County were modified to include the District of Velika Kikinda. A few years prior, parts of the territory of the former Banat Military Frontier (including Pancsova/Pančevo, formerly the seat of the so-called German Regiment) had also been annexed to it.

In 1918, the county was briefly a part of the ephemeral Banat Republic, and then a part of Banat, Bačka and Baranja region of the Kingdom of Serbia, which subsequently became part of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. By the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, the area of the county was divided between the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, Romania, and Hungary. Most of the county was assigned to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (which later became Yugoslavia). The north-eastern part of the county was assigned to Romania, and the northernmost part of the county (a small area south of Szeged, comprising Kiszombor and 8 surrounding villages) was assigned to Hungary and became part of the newly formed county of Csanád-Arad-Torontál in 1923.

The Yugoslav part of the pre-1920 Torontál county (the western Banat region) is now part of Serbia (mostly in the autonomous region of Vojvodina, except the small part near Belgrade, which is part of Belgrade Region). The Romanian part is now part of Timiș county (called &quot;Timiș-Torontal&quot; between 1919 and 1950). The Hungarian part is now part of Csongrád County.

<doc id="932099" wikidata="Q1856007" url="?curid=932099" title="School of Nisibis">
<text>The School of Nisibis (, for a time absorbed into the School of Edessa) was an educational establishment in Nisibis (now Nusaybin, Turkey). It was an important spiritual centre of the early Church of the East, and like the Academy of Gondishapur, it is sometimes referred to as the world&#x27;s first university. The school had three primary departments teaching: theology, philosophy and medicine. Its most famous teacher was Narsai, formerly head of the School of Edessa.

The school was founded in 350 in Nisibis. In 363, when Nisibis fell to the Persians, St. Ephrem the Syrian, accompanied by a number of teachers, left the school. They went to the School of Edessa, where Ephrem took over the directorship of the school there. It had been founded as long ago as the 2nd century by the kings of the Abgar dynasty. When Ephrem took over the school, its importance grew still further. After the Nestorian Schism, when the Byzantine emperor Zeno ordered the school closed for its teachings of Nestorian doctrine, deemed heretical by Chalcedonian Christianity, the School moved back to Nisibis.

==Early history==
The school was founded around 350 by Jacob of Nisibis (Mar Yaqub). Its model was the school of Diodorus of Tarsus in Antioch. It was an ideal location for a Syriac school: in the centre of the Syriac-speaking world but still in the Roman Empire, which had just embraced Christianity. Most of Mesopotamia was under Sassanid Persian rule, which had the ancient Zoroastrian religion as its official state-religion.

==Exile to Edessa==
The Persians soon gained Nisibis, in 363, and the school was moved westward to an existing school in Edessa, Mesopotamia, where it was known as the &#x27;School of the Persians&#x27; (Eskuli d-Forsoye/Eskuli d-Parsaye in Edessan Aramaic/Syriac). There, under the leadership of Ephrem, it gained fame well beyond the borders of the Syriac speaking world.

Meanwhile, in Antioch, Theodore of Mopsuestia had taken over the school of Diodorus, and his writings soon became the foundation of Syriac theology. Even during his lifetime, they were translated into Syriac and gradually replaced the work of Ephrem. One of his most famous students was Nestorius, who became Patriarch of Constantinople, but the doctrine he was preaching made him run afoul of Cyril of Alexandria. Cyril sought to brand Nestorius as a heretic, and at the First Council of Ephesus in 431, he had Nestorius formally censured.

The resulting conflict led to the Nestorian Schism, which separated the Church of the East from the Western Byzantine form of Christianity. The opponents of Nestorius attacked Theodore&#x27;s School of Diodorus as well, and the Syrians answered by giving protection to the followers of Nestorius. In 489, the Byzantine emperor, Zeno, ordered the school closed for its Nestorian tendencies, and it returned to Nisibis.

==Centre of Syriac theology==
Back in Nisibis, the school became even more famous. It attracted students from all the Syriac churches, many of its students embodied important church offices, and its teaching was normative. The exegetical methods of the school followed the tradition of Antioch: strictly literal, controlled by pure grammatical-historical analysis. The work of Theodore was central to the theological teaching, and men like Abraham of Beth Rabban, who headed the school during the middle of the 6th century, spent great effort to make his work as accessible as possible. The writings of Nestorius himself were added to the curriculum only about 530.

At the end of the 6th century, the school went through a theological crisis, when its director Henana of Adiabene attempted to revise the official exegetical tradition derived from Theodore of Mopsuestia. The controversy over Henana divided the Church of the East, and led to the departure of many of the school&#x27;s members, probably including Babai the Great. A focus of the controversy was the debate between supporters of a one-&quot;qnoma&quot; (roughly &quot;hypostasis&quot;) and of a two-&quot;qnome&quot; Christology, and the divide was worsened by interventions on the part of West Syriac miaphysites. Babai&#x27;s attacks on Henana&#x27;s one-&quot;qnoma&quot; theology came to be generally accepted by the Church of the East, though Henana remained a significant influence in the Church&#x27;s subsequent tradition of interpretation.

The controversy over Henana and the monastic revival initiated by Abraham of Kashkar, supported by Babai, diminished the school&#x27;s influence, and the spread of other schools founded on its model throughout the Sassanid Empire also reduced its centrality. In the first half of the 7th century, after the death of Henana in c. 610, the school seems to have entered terminal decline.

==Influence on the West==
The fame of this theological seminary was so great that Pope Agapetus I and Cassiodorus wished to found one in Italy of a similar kind. The troubled times prevented their wishes from being realized, but Cassiodorus&#x27;s monastery at Vivarium was inspired by the example of Nisibis that he had learned from the Quaestor Junillus during his time in Constantinople.

<text>Laerdal is a multinational company that develops products and programs for healthcare providers, voluntary organizations, educational institutions, hospitals, and the military worldwide. Laerdal has over 2,000 employees in 26 countries. The headquarters is located in Stavanger, Norway.

== History ==
Laerdal was founded in 1940 by Åsmund S. Lærdal as a children’s publishing and toy company. During the years as a toy developer, Lærdal learned about a synthetic plastic material, now known as PVC, that was suited for the casting of toys and dolls. The use of soft plastics revolutionized the toy industry and by 1960, more than 100 million toy cars, under the brand Tomte, had been sold in 100 countries. The Laerdal Anne doll was named &quot;Toy of the Year&quot; and became a bestseller throughout Europe. Due to this experience with soft plastics, The Norwegian Civil Defense called on Laerdal to design natural-looking imitation wounds for military training. In 1958, Laerdal was approached by Norwegian anesthesiologist after learning from Dr. Peter Safar about the need for a lifelike manikin to train the new concept of mouth-to-mouth ventilation. Together, Laerdal, Lind and Safar developed the world’s first patient simulator, Resusci Anne, which was introduced in 1960.

The face of Resusci Anne was inspired by the death mask of an unidentified girl who was found drowned in the River Seine in Paris at the turn of the 19th century. Resusci Anne would become the predecessor of a series of manikins used to teach cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

== Resuscitation training ==
During the next 60 years, Laerdal resuscitation training manikins were developed to train both healthcare providers and the general population in the lifesaving skill of CPR. It is estimated by the American Heart Association that resuscitation training manikins have been used to train 500 million people worldwide saving an estimated 2.5 million lives. Laerdal&#x27;s resuscitation training is used to strengthen the Chain of Survival. The Chain of Survival illustrates the sequence of interventions for cardiac arrest that have been shown to improve survival from sudden cardiac arrest.
==Healthcare simulation==
Today, medical errors result in an estimated 4.1 million deaths globally, every year. The methodology of simulation training in healthcare education has gained widespread recognition within the field of healthcare as a tool for reinforcing clinical skills and knowledge. Laerdal was one of the first companies to develop products for medical simulation, introducing a series of realistic human patient simulators, to enable interactive training without risk to patient safety.

As technology developed, patient manikins evolved into advanced, realistic human-like simulators used for healthcare training and medical simulation. These simulators can be used to supplement clinical practice. In a large-scale study examining the use of simulation in nursing, it was found that high quality simulation can replace up to 50% of clinical training hours. Simulation training allows for skills training and performance measurement. Simulators transmit feedback – measuring performance in metrics including CPR, emergency cardiovascular care (ECC), automated external defibrillator (AED), arrhythmia, blood pressure, airway and ventilation management, ultrasound diagnostics, advanced critical care, endovascular procedures, neonatal, venous and arterial, and nursing and patient care. Education is hands-on with directive feedback in audio, visual or both, with apps for smartphones and tablets. Technology that offers objective feedback during and after simulation is used for debriefing and improving learner performance.

== Flagship products ==
The well-known Resusci Anne simulator has been updated to include variation with CPR metrics feedback technology, advanced skill training, and first aid. The newborn and pediatric simulators, Resusci Junior and Resusci Baby, also allow for CPR feedback technology. Laerdal&#x27;s introduced its high-fidelity simulator, SimMan 3G, in 2009. Several iterations have followed that include Simman 3G Trauma, SimMan Essential, SimMan ALS, SimMan Vascular, SimMom, SimBaby and SimNewb. In 2019, Laerdal acquired the company B-Line Medical, a debriefing, assessment, and training management platform. After a partnership signed in 2018, Laerdal Medical now offers integrated simulators with B-Line Medical technology.

== Global partnerships ==
Laerdal works with global partners such as the British Heart Foundation on their Nation of Lifesavers project to train school children to perform CPR and AED use. From September 2020, first aid and CPR will be added to the primary and secondary school curriculum in England. Similarly, Laerdal supplies the American Heart Association (AHA) with CPR training kits for use with their CPR in schools program. In the United States, 38 states now require CPR training as part of the high school graduation requirement. Together with the AHA and the Global Resuscitation Alliance, Resuscitation Quality Improvement (RQI) programs are used at hospitals to refresh the CPR skills of healthcare providers using short, frequent training sessions. Laerdal is also a partner of the National League for Nursing for patient simulation training for nursing education and collaborates with the American Academy of Pediatrics to develop neonatal resuscitation education through education and technology.

== Not-for-profit initiatives ==
Laerdal Global Health (LGH) is the not-for-profit sister company established in 2010 to help save the lives of mothers and newborns in low-income countries. Laerdal and partners provide the tools and training for safer deliveries. One of these programs, Helping Babies Breathe, has been used to train 500,000 midwives in 80 low-income countries.

The Laerdal Foundation for Acute Medicine was established in 1980 to provide financial support to practically oriented research and development in acute medicine. In recent years there has also been an added focus on projects related to saving lives at birth in low-resource settings. The foundation has supported 1600 international research projects with more than 40 million dollars in funding.

The Laerdal Foundation facilitates an annual meeting for medical researchers from around the world at the Utstein Abbey outside of Stavanger, Norway, to make recommendations for how to implement best practices in topics including resuscitation, patient simulation, maternal and neonatal mortality. The widely accepted Utstein Formula for Survival is a model that employs three elements in hypothesizing potential survival rates: medical science, educational efficiency and local implementation. The Global Resuscitation Alliance was established at the Utstein meeting to promote best practices in resuscitation research.

<doc id="932111" wikidata="Q6660746" url="?curid=932111" title="Lizzie Webb">
<text>Lizzie Webb (née Beveridge; 12 August 1948), often known as &quot;Mad Lizzie&quot;, is an English fitness expert, author and presenter. In the 1980s and 1990s she presented daily exercise routines on British morning television channel TV-am. She was introduced onto the channel&#x27;s flagship show &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; in response to the popularity of exercise teacher Diana Moran (&quot;the Green Goddess&quot;) on the rival BBC One show &quot;Breakfast Time&quot;. She created many videos, such as &quot;Pop Dance with Lizzie&quot;, &quot;Shake-out with Lizzie&quot; and many more. She has produced 9 videos (8 exercise, 1 dance) and 8 books. Her first video was &quot;The Body Programme with Lizzie Webb&quot; and her last was &quot;Pop Dance with Lizzie!!!&quot;

However Webb&#x27;s most successful venture is &quot;Joggy Bear&quot;, a children&#x27;s TV character who now runs his own touring fitness club. Both Lizzie and Joggy starred in their own television show from the late 1980s to early 1990s for Channel 4. The series at its peak reached number 2 in the video charts in 1992. Webb now tours with Joggy, running fitness classes and stage shows across the UK.

Lizzie Webb&#x27;s first fitness video released on VHS by MSD Video, topped the UK video charts in 1987. In 1988, after the Julio Iglesias and Stevie Wonder duet &quot;My Love&quot; was a UK Top 5 hit after being featured during Webb&#x27;s workout segments on TV-am, she was invited to curate her own love songs compilation album, entitled &quot;From Lizzie With Love&quot;, and released for the 1988 Christmas market.

Webb was married to maths teacher Andrew Webb with whom she had a son, but after a nine-year marriage they divorced. In 2008 she married Douglas Cameron.

Webb has since appeared on ITV&#x27;s &quot;That Antony Cotton Show&quot;, an episode of &quot;Pointless Celebrities&quot; and as a guest on Loose Women in 2018.

<doc id="932116" wikidata="Q557281" url="?curid=932116" title="Anchor handling tug supply vessel">
<text>Anchor Handling Tug Supply (AHTS) vessels are mainly built to handle anchors for oil rigs, tow them to location, and use them to secure the rigs in place. AHTS vessels sometimes also serve as Emergency Response and Rescue Vessels (ERRVs) and as supply transports.

Many of these vessels are designed to meet the harsh conditions of the North Sea, and can undertake supply duties there between land bases and drilling sites. They also provide towing assistance during tanker loading, deepwater anchor handling, and towing of threatening objects.

AHTS vessels differ from platform supply vessels (PSVs) in being fitted with winches for towing and anchor handling, having an open stern to allow the decking of anchors, and having more power to increase the bollard pull. The machinery is specifically designed for anchor handling operations. They also have arrangements for quick anchor release, which is operable from the bridge or other normally crewed locations in direct communication with the bridge. The reference load used in the design and testing of the towing winch is twice the static bollard pull.

Even if AHTS-vessels are customized for anchor-handling and towing, they can also undertake, for example, ROV (remotely operated underwater vehicle) services, safety/rescue services, and supply duties between mainland and offshore installations.

The world&#x27;s strongest tug since its delivery in 2020 is MV &quot;Island Victory&quot; (Vard Brevik 831) of Island Offshore, with a bollard pull of 477 tonnes-force (526 short tons-force; 4,680 kN).

<doc id="932118" wikidata="Q5004228" url="?curid=932118" title="Byrd Park">
<text>Byrd Park, also known as William Byrd Park, is a public park located in Richmond, Virginia, United States, north of the James River and adjacent to Maymont. The park includes a mile-long trail with exercise stops, monuments, an amphitheatre, and three small lakes: Shields (sometimes spelled Sheilds), Swan, and Boat Lake. Boat Lake (also called Fountain Lake) has a lighted fountain at its center. Visitors can rent pedal boats there in season. The park includes tennis courts, Little League baseball fields, and a children&#x27;s playground. The historic round house and Poplar Vale Cemetery are also located in the park. It is named after William Byrd II, whose family owned much of the area when Richmond was founded in 1737. The park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016.

==History==
In 1873, the city of Richmond began the creation of a new municipal waterworks system, in order to replace an earlier one which had become insufficient for the growing city. In 1874, a site was chosen upriver to the west of the city, and from 1875 to 1888, the land was acquired and the reservoir constructed. The pit used for building up the earthen berms became what is now Fountain Lake, itself fed by the reservoir. In 1884, the New Pump-House was completed at the base of the hill, drawing water from the defunct James River and Kanawha Canal and pumping it up to the reservoir. The large tract of parkland surrounding the reservoir was descriptively named New Reservoir Park, with the equally aptly named Boulevard serving to house the water main leading from the reservoir to the thoroughfare of Broad Street, simultaneously providing access to the park.

By 1907, the park had been renamed William Byrd Park, and by 1914 plans had begun for the construction of two additional lakes: Shield&#x27;s Lake and Swann Lake.

The park&#x27;s Statue of Christopher Columbus, erected in 1927, was controversial at the time of its construction because it honored Italian-Americans in a climate of increasing anti-immigration sentiment. In 2020, during the George Floyd protests, Columbus became controversial for a different reason: his killing of Native Americans and his initiation of the slave trade. On June 9, 2020, citizens toppled the statue after vandalizing it and then threw it into Fountain Lake.

In 2016, the Richmond Police Memorial Research and Relocation Site Committee completed the relocation of the Richmond Police Memorial to Byrd Park. The memorial is an 8-foot-tall bronze statue of a police officer carrying a girl clutching a teddy bear, along with a plaque of the names of 28 Richmond police officers killed from 1869 to 2003. The memorial was moved from the park after being vandalized following the murder of George Floyd.

==The Carillon==

The World War I Memorial Carillon, built by Cram &amp; Ferguson in 1932, is a memorial to the roughly 3,700 Virginians who died in that war; it contains 56 bells and is tall. The Carillon is played on occasions such as Veterans Day, Memorial Day, and July 4, and is also used for hosting wedding receptions, parties, meetings, and other such gatherings. The carillon was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

==Events==

The amphitheatre, Dogwood Dell, has annual summer concert and theatrical events, including a concert by the Richmond Concert Band that concludes with the &quot;1812 Overture&quot;, complete with cannon fire, the carillon, and a fireworks display on the 4th of July. Events and shows for children are frequently scheduled at the Ha&#x27;Penny Stage just beside the carillon.

In May the park hosts an annual &quot;Arts in the Park&quot; festival, a festive two-day event in which over 400 artists and artisans display and sell their work. The park holds an annual Summer Festival of Arts in June through August which hosts plays, concerts, children events, and other family activities. The Summer Festival of the Arts celebrated its fiftieth season in 2006. The second Saturday in June brings out Richmond&#x27;s annual &quot;It Starts in Park Festival&quot; which is designed to encourage healthy living and family fun for the summer months just as the school children are getting close to their summer vacations. The carillon is also home to the city&#x27;s live Christmas Nativity pageant now held (weather permitting) on December 23, after over 60 years of holding it on Christmas Eve.

The park was listed in 2016 on the National Register of Historic Places and the Virginia Landmarks Register.

Oeno serves as a private holiday site for the few residents of Pitcairn Island, who travel there and stay for two weeks in January because Oeno has beaches while Pitcairn doesn&#x27;t.

The main island (Oeno Island), about in area, has forest and scrub with pandanus and palm trees. It is located in the southwest part of the atoll&#x27;s lagoon. There is a water tap installed on the island. The maximum elevation is less than . Sandy Island (or Islands) is to the northeast, within the lagoon, and may be an ephemeral island. Three smaller islets are to the south and west of the main island.

=== Important Bird Area ===
The island has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) principally for its colony of Murphy&#x27;s petrels, which, at some 12,500 pairs, is estimated to be the second largest colony of these birds in the world.

<doc id="932123" wikidata="Q55022486" url="?curid=932123" title="William Byrd II">
<text>William Byrd II (March 28, 1674August 26, 1744) was an American planter, lawyer, surveyor and writer. Born in the English colony of Virginia, Byrd was educated in London, where he practiced law. Upon his father&#x27;s death, Byrd returned to Virginia in 1705. He served as a member of the Virginia Governor&#x27;s Council from 1709 to 1744. Byrd was also the House of Burgesses&#x27;s colonial agent in London during the 1720&#x27;s. His life reflected aspects of both the British colonial gentry and an emerging American identity.

Byrd led surveying expeditions of the border of Virginia and North Carolina. He is considered the founder of Richmond, Virginia. Byrd expanded his plantation holdings and commanded county militias during his life. His enterprises included promoting Swiss settlement in mountainous southwest Virginia and iron mining ventures in Germanna and Fredericksburg. A member of the Royal Society, Byrd was an early advocate of variolation to counter smallpox.

He may be best known for his writings in his diary and the narratives of his surveying, some of which have been published in American literature textbooks. Byrd recorded his exploits, which are notable for its openness on issues such as sex and Byrd&#x27;s brutal treatment of his slaves.

==Early life and education==

William Byrd, the eldest child of Mary Horsmanden Filmer Byrd and her second husband, William Byrd I, was born on March 28, 1674, in Henrico County, Virginia. His father was a planter, public official, and a Native American trader. When he was two, his mother took him with her to visit relatives in Purleigh, England. He was in England and living with his mother&#x27;s relatives in 1681, when he was enrolled in Felsted School, where he studied Hebrew, Italian, and French. It was his father&#x27;s goal that Byrd was educated to become a gentleman and had first-hand experiences with aristocrat.

He was an apprentice in London and Rotterdam for two years for tobacco trading companies, where he learned about commerce. During that time, he acquired the social graces of a gentleman.

He then studied law at Middle Temple from 1692 to 1695, when he was admitted to the bar to practice law. The following year he was elected as a Fellow in the Royal Society with the support of Sir Robert Southwell, his father&#x27;s friend.

By this time, Byrd spent much of his childhood in England, but born in Virginia, where he was expected to return, he was not accepted as an Englishman. This made it difficult for him to marry into an aristocratic family or become a politician in England.

==Career==
After a 15-year absence, he returned to Virginia in the summer of 1696. Due to his education and his father&#x27;s influence, he was elected to the House of Burgesses in the fall of that year, but he withdrew in October to return to London, where he practiced law. He was admitted to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn October 1697 and soon after defended Governor Sir Edmund Andros in a hearing at Lambeth Palace that unseated Andros for impeding the establishment of the College of William &amp; Mary and replaced him with Francis Nicholson as Governor of Virginia.

He became the London agent for the Virginia Governor&#x27;s Council in 1698. His father held the combined offices of auditor- and receiver-general, which Nicholson had attempted to separate. In this position, Byrd was able to thwart Nicholson&#x27;s efforts. In 1702, he attempted to have Nicholson removed from office, but the petition was rejected by the Crown and Byrd lost his position on the council.

In 1701, he went on a 14-week tour of England with Sir John Perceval, who was the nephew of Sir Robert Southwell. Byrd was 26 and Perceval was 18. By this time Byrd had a number of aristocratic friends and knew a lot about England. He introduced the teen to gentlemen, clergymen, borough officials, and merchants. Byrd was interested in the commerce, art collections, libraries and architecture of the places that they visited. During his time in England, he was a social man who focused on developing wordsmanship and polite manners.

His father died in 1705 and Byrd returned to Virginia. He was the primary heir to his father&#x27;s fortune, making him one of the wealthiest men in the colony. He became the receiver general; the post was separated from the auditorship following his father&#x27;s death. On September 12, 1709, nearly four year after he applied, he was appointed to a seat on the Virginia Governor&#x27;s Council, a position he held until his death.

Lieutenant Governor Alexander Spotswood reorganized the collection of quitrents in order to enlarge the royal revenue. Byrd felt that he was responsible for the operations of the receiver&#x27;s office and had objected to Spotwood&#x27;s actions and saw it as a personal affront. Byrd sailed for England in March or April 1715 at least in part to have Spotswood removed from office. Soon after, his wife joined him in England and died of smallpox. Within two months, he began to look for women to court.

While in England, he sold the receiver generalship for £500 to a Virginian. Spotswood sought approval for the Tobacco Inspection Act of 1713—which regulated the quality and sale of tobacco exports—and the Indian Trade Act of 1714—which established a monopoly over commerce with Native Americans. Both were passed by the Virginia General Assembly, but it received a royal veto, which Byrd considered a personal win.

Byrd was appointed a London agent in May 1718. Spotswood had Byrd deposed from the council. Byrd promised to seek a reconciliation with Spotswood and to return to Virginia, which he did in February 1720 and reconciled with Spotswood.

In 1721, he was appointed a paid agent for the House of Burgesses and returned to England. In 1726, he returned to Virginia. On April 28 of that year, he resumed attendance at the council. In 1728, he was appointed to survey the Virginia and North Carolina border by the next Lieutenant Governor Sir William Gooch. The Tobacco Inspection Act of 1730 was passed and Byrd&#x27;s land was chosen for construction of a warehouse, of direct benefit to him.

He is responsible for the establishment of the cities of Petersburg and, on his own land, Richmond, Virginia in 1733. Gooch appointed Byrd to a commission with commissioners and surveyors to lay out the Northern Neck Proprietary. Byrd wrote the report that was sent with the survey in August 1737 to England, but after his death a report from another commission was chosen. He was the senior councillor by 1743.

== Marriages ==
===Lucy Parke Byrd===
Byrd courted Lucy Parke, daughter of Jane Ludwell Parke and Daniel Parke (1664–1710), who was Governor of the Leeward Islands. Lucy lived near Colonial Williamsburg at the Parke&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Creek plantation in York County, Virginia with her mother and her sister Frances. Her father, who lived with his mistress, forbade the women from entertaining male callers and did not provide the money for them to have clothes of their station. This made it difficult for Frances and Lucy to have suitors. Byrd, though, knew Parke and his aristocratic connections, and was favorably impressed with Parke&#x27;s daughters, particularly Lucy. Byrd married Lucy on May 4, 1706, at the Queen&#x27;s Creek plantation. Frances was married on the same day to John Custis (1678–after 14 November 1749).

At the time of their marriage, Lucy Parke was 18 years old, and her mother was concerned that Daniel Parke&#x27;s many romantic affairs and reputation for stinginess were hurting his daughter&#x27;s marriage prospects. When Byrd wrote a letter to the Parkes asking to court Lucy, they immediately accepted. Byrd wooed her with passionate letters proclaiming his love. He was promised a £1,000 dowry when he married Lucy, but rather than delivering it upon their marriage, he was bequeathed the amount at Parke&#x27;s death. Byrd assumed debts of the Parke estate, which was a financial burden throughout the rest of his life. In exchange for accepting the debts, he took over lands that had been left to his wife&#x27;s sister.

Byrd and Lucy Parke Byrd quarreled frequently. Byrd sometimes noted that after these arguments, they made up and he &quot;rogered her&quot; or &quot;gave her a flourish.&quot; Their arguments often involved their slaves. Byrd notes in his diary entry for July 15, 1710 that Parke, &quot;against my will caused little Jenny to be burned with a hot iron, for which I quarreled with her&quot;.

Based on his diary, Byrd was singularly focused on treating his wife as a subordinate and did not foment closeness with their children. He often left his family for long periods of time.

Their children were: Evelyn Byrd, for whom Evelynton Plantation was named, and Wilhelmina Byrd, who married Thomas Chamberlayne.

Despite the couple&#x27;s differences, aspects of their relationship appear tender and romantic. Following Byrd to London, she died of smallpox in 1716. Byrd suffered greatly, blaming himself for her death. He wrote of the &quot;insupportable pain in her head… the smallpox… we thought it best to tell her the danger. She received the news without the least fright, and was persuaded she would live… Gracious God what pains did she take to make a voyage hither to seek a grave.&quot;

===Maria Taylor Byrd===

Byrd married Maria Taylor (1698-1771), daughter of a Kensington gentleman, on May 9, 1724. She was 25 years of age and Byrd was 50. Taylor, an heiress of a wealthy family from Kensington, was a different character than Parke. Her rare appearance in Byrd&#x27;s diary has left some historians with the image of a more submissive wife, accepting Byrd&#x27;s authority over the household. She was certainly well-mannered, and epitomised the upper-class lady that he desired, without any record of passionate &quot;flourishes&quot; to quell arguments or threatening the servants. Despite Byrd&#x27;s renewed sexual advances on other women, Taylor kept the household in good order. More recently, Allison Luthern has suggested that &#x27;a closer examination of sources reveals that Maria [Taylor] Byrd was not as easily governed by these powerful men as William Byrd II... indicates.&#x27;
Their children were: Anne Carter, Maria Taylor Carter, Colonel William Byrd III, and Jane Page.

Taylor appears to have tactically bided her time as Byrd aged, controlling the education of their children together and preparing to take control of Westover in her widowhood. She outlived Byrd by 37 years, supported by an annual pension in Byrd&#x27;s will for £200 on the condition that she remain unmarried and living in Westover.

==Personal diaries==
The first diary runs from 1709 to 1712 and was first published in the 1940s. It was originally written in a shorthand code and deals mostly with the day-to-day aspects of Byrd&#x27;s life, many of the entries containing the same formulaic phrases. A typical entry read like this:

In addition to the passages recounting his many infidelities, the diary also contains a record of the lives of slaves held by Byrd and his subsequent punishment. Byrd often beat the slaves he held and sometimes devised other punishments even more cruel and unusual:

== Literary pursuits ==
While William Byrd was an avid planter, politician, and statesman, he was also a man of letters. He collected books written in English, French, Italian, Dutch, Hebrew, Greek, and Latin on a wide range of subjects. Considered one of the greatest colonial libraries, he had 3,500 volumes, including biography, history, architecture, science, divinity and law. He also had books about gardening, art, medicine, drama, and etiquette.

A prolific writer, Byrd wrote essays, histories, and speeches. He also wrote caricatures, poetry, and diaries. He corresponded with noted naturalists, statesmen, and writers of the time.

All but two of his early literary works remained in manuscript form after his death at Westover in 1744, only appearing in print in the early 19th century and later receiving &quot;dismissive commentary&quot; by literary critics. It was not until the last quarter of the 20th century that his writings were assessed with any critical enthusiasm.

&quot;The History of the Dividing Line&quot; is Byrd&#x27;s most influential piece of literary work and is now featured regularly in textbooks of American Colonial literature. Through &quot;The Secret History&quot;, the societal stereotypes and attitudes of the time are revealed. According to Pierre Marambaud, Byrd &quot;had first prepared a narrative, &quot;The Secret History of the Line&quot;, which under fictitious names described the persons of the surveying expedition and the incidents that had befallen them.&quot;

===Major works===
Many of his works were in manuscript form and published after his death. His major works include:

* &quot;A Discourse Concerning the Plague&quot; (1721)
* The Westover Manuscripts: Containing the &quot;History of the Dividing Line Betwixt Virginia and North Carolina&quot;; &quot;A Journey to the Land of Eden, A.D.&quot; 1733; and &quot;A Progress to the Mines&quot;; Written from 1728 to 1736, and Now First Published (1841)
* &quot;The Secret Diary of William Byrd of Westover, 1709–1712&quot; (1941)
* &quot;Another Secret Diary of William Byrd of Westover, 1739–1741, with Letters &amp; Literary Exercises, 1696&quot; (1942)
* &quot;The London Diary, 1717–1728 and other Writings&quot; (1958)
* &quot;The Prose Works of William Byrd of Westover: Narratives of a Colonial Virginian&quot; (1966)

<doc id="932124" wikidata="Q3244607" url="?curid=932124" title="The Watersons">
<text>The Watersons were an English folk group from Hull, Yorkshire. They performed mainly traditional songs with little or no accompaniment. Their distinctive sound came from their closely woven harmonies. They have been called the &quot;most famous family in English folk music&quot;.

== Style ==
Their style is a unique blend of originality and tradition. The Watersons never learned to read music. They began by singing hunting songs, hymns and carols with their grandmother, ones that she probably sang with her parents. One family member would sing the melody, and the rest would join in, choosing a harmony note if the melody was out of their range.

Their style can be compared to the Copper Family of Sussex, a dynasty of traditional singers who sing in harmony, which was extremely unusual in traditional English music.

The band&#x27;s original members were Norma, Mike, and Elaine known as Lal Waterson, with their cousin John Harrison from Kingston High School. They had a skiffle band in the early 1960s but moved on to playing more traditional material. They were briefly known as &quot;the Folksons&quot;.

Their first album was &quot;Frost and Fire&quot; 1965, followed by &quot;The Watersons&quot; and &quot;A Yorkshire Garland&quot; in 1966. The Watersons split up in 1968, when Norma went to work as a disc jockey on a radio station on Montserrat.

The group reformed in 1972, with John Harrison briefly replaced by Bernie Vickers. In that year they performed and arranged the music for the Alan Plater TV &quot;Play for Today&quot;, &quot;The Land of Green Ginger&quot;, set and filmed in Hull, and appeared in a scene filmed in the Bluebell Folk Club.

Vickers was replaced the same year by Norma&#x27;s husband, Martin Carthy. This line-up recorded &quot;For Pence and Spicy Ale&quot; (1975), &quot;Sound, Sound Your Instruments of Joy&quot; (1977), and &quot;Green Fields&quot; (1981).

Later line-ups featured Mike Waterson&#x27;s daughter Rachel Waterson, who briefly replaced Lal during a leave of absence caused by ill health in the mid-1980s, then continued to sing with the group on Lal&#x27;s return. This five-piece line up performed regularly during the late 1980s and recorded a session for the BBC Andy Kershaw show in August 1986. In 1987, the group collaborated with Swan Arcade to form Blue Murder, who have performed and recorded sporadically with various line-ups to the present day. Subsequent Watersons line-ups fluctuated, featuring Eliza Carthy, Anne Waterson, Jill Pidd and Maria Gilhooley at various times, but recording only occasionally.

Lal Waterson died in 1998 and, by the early 1990s, Carthy, Norma Waterson and their daughter Eliza Carthy had formed the group Waterson–Carthy. The Watersons gradually ceased to sing live on a regular basis, but the family occasionally reconvened for special events and festival appearances, where they are usually billed as &quot;The Waterson Family&quot;. These have included &#x27;A Mighty River of Song&#x27; at the Royal Albert Hall on 12 May 2007, the BBC Electric Proms concert, &#x27;Once in a Blue Moon: A Tribute to Lal Waterson&#x27;, at Cecil Sharp House in London on 25 October 2007 and &#x27;A Tribute to Bert,&#x27; a concert celebrating the life and work of Albert Lancaster Lloyd, at Cecil Sharp House on 15 November 2008. During the summer of 2009, &quot;The Waterson Family&quot; performed at a number of festivals and large concerts throughout England and Ireland.

Mike Waterson died on 22 June 2011, aged 70, at Scarborough, North Yorkshire

Norma Waterson died on 30 January 2022, at the age of 82.

==Commendations==
The accompanying book to the Topic Records 70 year anniversary boxed set &quot;Three Score and Ten&quot; lists two of their albums as classic albums. The first is &quot;Frost and Fire&quot; with &quot;Hal-an-Tow&quot; as the eleventh track on the second CD and the second is &quot;For Pence and Spicy Ale&quot;. The title track of the boxed set is taken from the various artists album &quot;New Voices&quot; and is the seventeenth track on the sixth CD.

<doc id="932126" wikidata="Q455931" url="?curid=932126" title="George Maciunas">
<text>George Maciunas (; ; November 8, 1931 Kaunas – May 9, 1978 Boston, Massachusetts) was a Lithuanian American artist, art historian, and art organizer who was the founding member and central coordinator of Fluxus, an international community of artists, architects, composers, and designers. He is most famous for organizing and performing in early Fluxus Happenings and Festivals, for his Fluxus graphic art work, and for assembling a series of highly influential Fluxus artists&#x27; multiples.

== Early life ==

His father, Alexander M. Maciunas, was a Lithuanian architect and engineer who had trained in Berlin, and his mother, Leokadija, was a Russian-born dancer from Tiflis affiliated with the Lithuanian National Opera and, later, Aleksandr Kerensky&#x27;s private secretary, helping him complete his memoirs.

After fleeing Lithuania to avoid being arrested by the advancing Red Army in 1944, and living briefly in Bad Nauheim, Frankfurt, Germany, initially under Nazi control and then under the occupying forces, Jurgis Mačiūnas and his family emigrated to the US in 1948, living in a middle class area of Long Island, New York.

After arriving in the US, George studied art, graphic design, and architecture at Cooper Union, architecture and musicology at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh and finally art history at New York University&#x27;s Institute of Fine Arts specializing in the European and Siberian art of migrations. His studies lasted eleven years from 1949 to 1960 and were completed in succession. This began a fascination with the history of art for the rest of his life, and whilst there he began his first art-history chart, measuring 6 by 12 feet, a &quot;time/space chart categorizing all past styles, movements, schools, artists etc.&quot; between 1955 and 1960. Whilst this project remained unfinished, he would publish three versions of a history of the avant-garde. The first appeared in 1966, with Fluxus as the focal point. He also began a correspondence with Raoul Hausmann, an original member of Berlin Dada, who advised him to stop using the term &quot;neo-dada&quot; and concentrate instead on &quot;Fluxus&quot; to describe the nascent movement.

Duke University Professor Kristine Stiles has discussed Fluxus as part of a movement towards global humanism achieved through the breakdown of boundaries in artistic media, cultural norms, and political conventions. The blurring of cultural conventions, which began in the early 20th century with movements such as Dada and Futurism, was continued by Fluxus artists in correspondence with the changes taking place in the sixties. Like the definition of &quot;Flux&quot;, which means &quot;to flow&quot;, Fluxus artists sought to reorder the temples of production and reveal &quot;the extraordinary that remains latent in the undisclosed ordinary&quot; during the midst of the dramatic modernist epoch.

== Career ==
Primarily influenced by John Cage&#x27;s Experimental Music Composition classes at the New School for Social Research and an emerging interest in Eastern Philosophy, a number of avant-garde artists in New York were beginning to run parallel and competing Happenings at the beginning of the 1960s.

As well as Maciunas&#x27; concerts at the AG Gallery in March 1961 featuring music and events by Maciunas himself, Toshi Ichiyanagi, Mac Low and Dick Higgins, the two other most important precursors to Fluxus were La Monte Young&#x27;s influential series of performances in the Chambers Street loft of Yoko Ono and Toshi Ichiyanagi in 1961 involving Henry Flynt, La Monte Young, Joseph Byrd &amp; Robert Morris amongst others; and Robert Watts and George Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Yam Festival&quot;, spring 1963 at Rutgers University and New York, which included a series of mail art event scores and performances by John Cage, Allan Kaprow, Alison Knowles, Ay-O, and Dick Higgins. All of these artists and more eventually became associated with Fluxus, either through their collaboration on multiples, inclusion in anthologies, or participation in Fluxus concerts&#x27;.

Other key influences noted by Maciunas included the Happenings that had occurred at the Black Mountain College involving Robert Rauschenberg, John Cage, David Tudor, Merce Cunningham, and others; the Nouveaux Réalistes; the Concept Art of Henry Flynt and Marcel Duchamp&#x27;s notion of the readymade.

Though Maciunas conceived of the name &quot;Fluxus&quot; for a publication covering Lithuanian Culture conceived of during a meeting of Lithuanian émigrés, Fluxus soon developed into much more: an avant-garde movement characterized by playful subversion of previous art traditions (even including those of previous avant-garde movements). Fluxus also soon meant Dick Higgins&#x27; famously coined term &quot;intermedia&quot;, a view that art should not-be something rarefied or commercial, and a firm commitment to blurring the distinctions between art and life. Maciunas&#x27; lifelong interest in diagrams made him chart the political, cultural and social history as well as art history and the chronology of Fluxus.

In 1963, Maciunas composed the first Fluxus Manifesto, (see above), which called upon its readers to:
...purge the world of bourgeois sickness, &#x27;intellectual&#x27;, professional &amp; commercialized culture ... PROMOTE A REVOLUTIONARY FLOOD AND TIDE IN ART, ... promote NON ART REALITY to be grasped by all peoples, not only critics, dilettantes and professionals ... FUSE the cadres of cultural, social &amp; political revolutionaries into united front &amp; action.

Shared by its sibling art movements pop art and minimalism, Fluxus expressed a countercultural sentiment to the value of art and the modes of its experience –distinctly achieved by its commitment to collectivism and to decommodifying and deaestheticizing art. Its aesthetic practitioners, valuing originality over imitating overworked forms, reconceptualized the art object and the nature of performance through musical &#x27;concerts&#x27;, &#x27;olympic&#x27; games, and publications. By undermining the traditional role of art and artist, its humor is reflective of a goal to bring life back into art, which Maciunas states in his agenda, &quot;If man could experience the world, the concrete world surrounding him (from mathematical ideas to physical matter) in the same way he experiences art, there would be no need for art, artists and similar &#x27;nonproductive&#x27; elements&quot;. 

===The AG Gallery and the first Fluxus festivals===

In 1960, whilst attending composition classes of the electronic composer Richard Maxfield at the New School for Social Research in New York, Maciunas met many of the future participants of Fluxus, including La Monte Young, Al Hansen, Allan Kaprow, and Jackson Mac Low. In 1961 he opened the AG Gallery at 925 Madison Avenue with fellow Lithuanian Almus Salcius, intending to finance the gallery&#x27;s ambitious programme of events and exhibitions by importing delicatessen foods and rare musical instruments. The gallery, though short-lived (it closed on July 30 due to lack of funds), was devoted to new and groundbreaking art across genres and held exhibits and performance art events by many of his new acquaintances.

To avoid debt collectors, Maciunas took a job as a civilian graphic designer at a U.S. Air Force base in Wiesbaden, Germany in late 1961. It was there that he organized the first Fluxus Festival in September 1962. This festival featured various &quot;concerts,&quot; scripted actions performed by Fluxus artists, as well as interpreting a number of works by other members of the international avant-garde .

One of the most notorious events performed at Wiesbaden was Maciunas&#x27; interpretation of Philip Corner&#x27;s &quot;Piano Activities&quot;, the score of which asked a group of people to &#x27;play&#x27;, &#x27;scratch or rub&#x27; and &#x27;strike soundboard, pins, lid or drag various objects across them.&#x27; In Maciunas&#x27; interpretation, with the help of Higgins, Williams and others, the piano was completely destroyed. This event was considered scandalous enough to appear on German television four times. The festival then traveled to Cologne, Paris, Düsseldorf, Amsterdam, The Hague, and Nice. These concerts and events were to become integral to the legacy of Fluxus.

===The return to New York and the Fluxshop===
After his contract with the US Airforce was terminated due to chronic illness, Maciunas was forced to return to New York, September 1963. He began to work as a graphic artist at the New York studio of graphic designer and former &quot;Look&quot; art director Jack Marshad. He established the official Fluxus Headquarters at 359 Canal Street in New York City and proceeded to make Fluxus into a sort of multinational corporation, replete with &quot;a complex amalgam of Fluxus Products from the FluxShop and the Flux Mail-Order Catalogue and Warehouse, Fluxus copyright protection, a collective newspaper, a Flux Housing Cooperative and frequently revised lists of incorporated Fluxus &quot;workers&quot;.

The shop, like all his business ventures, was notoriously unsuccessful, however. In a 1978 interview with Larry Miller shortly before his death, Maciunas estimated spending &#x27;about $50,000&#x27; on Fluxus projects over the years that would never recoup their investment.

Larry Miller, &quot;May I ask a stupid question? Why didn&#x27;t it pay off? Because isn&#x27;t part of the idea that it&#x27;s low cost and multiple distribution...&quot;
GM; &quot;No one was buying it, in those days. We opened up a store on Canal Street, what was it, 1964, and we had it open almost all year. We didn&#x27;t make one sale in that whole year... We did not even sell a 50 cent item, a postage stamp sheet... you could buy V TRE papers for a quarter, you could buy George Brecht&#x27;s puzzles for one dollar, Fluxus yearboxes for twenty dollars.&quot;
===Flux boxes===
During this time, Maciunas was assembling Fluxus boxes and Flux-Kits, small boxes containing cards and objects designed and assembled by artists such as Christo, Yoko Ono, and George Brecht. The first one to be planned was &quot;Fluxus 1&quot;, a wooden box filled with artworks by most of Maciunas&#x27; colleagues. Production difficulties meant that the publication date was pushed back to 1964; Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Water Yam&quot;, 1963, became the first Flux box to actually be published. It was quickly followed by similar collected works of other affiliated artists, such as Ben Vautier and Robert Watts; the &quot;Fluxkit&quot; contained in an attaché case (1965–66) and another compendium &quot;Flux Year Box 2&quot; (1966–68). There was an anthology of &quot;Fluxfilms&quot; (1966), 11 irregularly-spaced editions of the Fluxus newspaper &quot;cc V TRE&quot; edited with George Brecht (1964–79) and the &quot;Fluxus Cabinet&quot; (1975–77). He was also closely involved with the production of a number of &quot;Flux Chess&quot; sets.

Perhaps most important of all of Maciunas&#x27;s publishing activities remain the object multiples, conceived as inexpensive, mass-produced unlimited editions. These were either works made by individual Fluxus artists, sometimes in collaboration with Maciunas, or, most controversially, Maciunas&#x27;s own interpretations of an artist&#x27;s concept or score. Their purpose was to erode the cultural status of art and to help to eliminate the artist&#x27;s ego.

Maciunas, a trained graphic designer, was responsible for the memorable packaging of Fluxus objects, posters and newspapers, helping to give the movement a sense of unity that the artists themselves often denied. He also designed a series of name cards incorporating multiple fonts to characterise each of the participating artists. According to Maciunas, Fluxus was epitomized by the work of George Brecht, particularly his word event, &quot;Exit.&quot; The artwork consists solely of a card on which is printed the words: &quot;Word Event&quot; and then the word &quot;Exit&quot; below. Maciunas said of &quot;Exit&quot;:

The best Fluxus &#x27;Composition&#x27; is a most non-personal, &#x27;readymade&#x27; one like Brecht&#x27;s &#x27;Exit&#x27;—it does not require and of us to perform it since it happens daily without any &#x27;special&#x27; performance of it. Thus our festivals will eliminate themselves (and our need to participate) when they become total readymades (like Brecht&#x27;s exit) (see )
===Some works===
Whilst Maciunas was still alive, no Fluxus work was ever signed or numbered, and many weren&#x27;t even credited to any artist. As such, huge confusion continues to surround many key Fluxus works; Maciunas strived to uphold his stated aims of demonstrating the artist&#x27;s &#x27;non-professional status...his dispensability and inclusiveness&#x27; and that &#x27;anything can be art and anyone can do it.&#x27; This strategy was maintained throughout his life; key works that have been assigned to him include &quot;USA Surpasses all the Genocide Records!&quot;, c1966 (see ), an American Flag comparing massacres in Nazi Germany, Russia and Vietnam; the &quot;Flux Smile Machine&quot; c1970 (see ) in which a spring forces the mouth into a grimace, usually considered a critique on capitalist imperialism; and the film &quot;12! Big Names!&quot;, 1973 (for the poster see ) in which the assembled audience, having been enticed into the cinema with the promise of 12 big names, including Andy Warhol and Yoko Ono, watched a film made entirely of 12 names—Warhol, Ono etc.—filling the screen, one after the other, for a duration of five minutes each.

===Professional employments===
Maciunas held several prestigious professional positions as an architect and graphic designer in firms including Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, Air Force Exchanges (Europe), Jack Marshad Inc., Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation, and Knoll Associates.

As an architect, he developed an innovative modular prototype useful in the construction of prefabricated buildings while working at Olin Mathieson&#x27;s division of Aluminum Product Development and Design. He filed a patent (#2,970,676) for the invention of a structural framework for prefabricated buildings using aluminum beams and columns on January 27, 1958. Maciunas was awarded a patent (#4,545,159) for a modular building system on February 7, 1961. He used this invention towards designing a modular prefabricated mass-housing system known as Fluxhouse. Developed as an improved design to Soviet Block Housing (or Khrushchyovka), Fluxhouse was conceived in consideration to efficiency of materials, transportation, and labor to produce a cost and time effective mass-produced housing system. As an efficient modular system intended for factory production, this eco-friendly and sustainable design can be adapted to construct a single family home, a mid-rise building, or a neighborhood community with the multiplication or subtraction of units. Maciunas conceived this design as a dwelling which combines the low-cost advantages of standardization with the freedom of customization.

===SoHo and the Fluxhouse Co-Operative===
As an urban planner, Maciunas is credited as the &quot;Father of SoHo&quot; for developing dilapidated loft buildings and gentrifying the neighborhood with artists cooperatives known as the Fluxhouse Cooperatives during the late sixties. Maciunas converted buildings into live-work spaces for and envisioned the Fluxhouse Cooperatives as collective living environments composed of artists working in many mediums. With financial support from the J.M. Kaplan Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts, Maciunas began buying several loft buildings from closing manufacturing companies in 1966. The renovation and occupancies violated the M-I zoning laws that designated SoHo as a non-residential area. The zoning laws were in place to construct the Lower Manhattan Expressway, a vast highway conceived by Robert Moses which would have obliterated much of Lower Manhattan&#x27;s industrial loft district. Though the Lower Manhattan Expressway was opposed by dozens of public figures and over 200 community groups, Maciuanas&#x27; efforts and the loft artists&#x27; power effectively stopped Moses, &quot;Opposition to the expressway was going nowhere. Our whole planning board couldn&#x27;t even slow it down. Then a handful of artists stepped in and stopped it cold&quot;.

When Kaplan left the project to embark on other artist cooperative buildings, Maciunas was left with little support against the law. Maciunas continued the co-op despite contravening planning laws, buying a series of loft buildings to sell to artists as working and living spaces. Although it was illegal to sell the units publicly without first filing a full-disclosure prospectus with the New York State Attorney General, Maciunas ignored the legal requirements, beginning a series of increasingly bizarre run-ins with the Attorney General of New York. Maciunas began wearing disguises and going out only at night. Strategies included sending postcards from around the world via associates and friends to persuade the authorities that he was abroad, and placing razor-sharp guillotine blades onto his front door to avoid unwanted visitors. Though, like other Fluxus projects, Maciunas managed his duties without personal profit, financial disputes between the cooperatives led to problems. On November 8, 1975, an argument with an electrician over unpaid bills resulted in a severe beating, allegedly by &#x27;Mafia thugs&#x27;, which left him with 4 broken ribs, a deflated lung, 36 stitches in his head and blind in one eye. He left New York shortly after, to attempt to start a Fluxus-oriented arts centre in a dilapidated mansion and stud farm in New Marlborough, Massachusetts.

The Fluxhouse cooperatives are often cited as playing a major role in regenerating and gentrifying SoHo. SoHo has since been an enclave in which contemporary art movements have developed and flourished.

== Death ==
Perpetually sick, Maciunas developed cancer of the pancreas and liver in 1977. He died on May 9 of the following year in a hospital in Boston. Three months before his death, he married his friend and companion, the poet Billie Hutching. After a legal wedding in Lee, Massachusetts, the couple performed a &quot;Fluxwedding&quot; in a friend&#x27;s loft in SoHo, February 25, 1978. The bride and groom traded clothing. The event was taped by video artist Dimitri Devyatkin.

==Posthumous reputation==
Maciunas remains enigmatic to this day, and his reputation still elicits strong responses both from artists and critics who have come after Fluxus, and by artists who knew him whilst still alive.

Adrian Searle, art critic for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, put it succinctly in a review of a Fluxus exhibition;

The view that his death liberated Fluxus is also widespread;

The life of George Maciunas is subject of a documentary film by the Manhattan-based artist and independent filmmaker Jeffrey Perkins who met Maciunas in 1966. It is made out of Maciunas&#x27; friends voices, material from 44 interviews that had been gathered by Perkins since 2010 on his travels to Europe, America and Japan. An oratorio loosely based on Maciunas and titled &quot;Machunas&quot; premiered in August 2005 in the St. Christopher Summer Festival in Vilnius, Lithuania. &quot;Machunas&quot; was conceived by artist Lucio Pozzi, with music by Frank J. Oteri. Several of Maciunas&#x27; friends and colleagues protested the fact that the libretto was mistaken by many as a biography. 

In 2024, art historian Colby Chamberlain published an indepth book on Maciunas with the University of Chicago Press called &quot;Fluxus Administration: George Maciunas and the Art of Paperwork&quot;.

==Dedicated museums and collections==

Maciunas&#x27; work has been exhibited in many of the major museums around the world with archives held in The Whitney Museum of American Art, The Walker Art Center, the Getty Research Institute, Staatsgalerie Stuttgart, and Kaunas Picture Gallery, representing the Fluxus room. Recently acquired from the Gilbert and Lila Silverman Fluxus Collection, The Museum of Modern Art currently holds the largest collection of Maciunas and Fluxus works of 10,000 items. As part of a touring exhibition organized by Dartmouth College, Maciunas&#x27; work was featured in &quot;Fluxus and the Essential Questions of Life&quot; at New York University&#x27;s Grey Gallery in Fall 2011 and University of Michigan&#x27;s Museum of Art in Spring 2012.

Despite controversy, the Stendhal gallery has held multiple exhibitions devoted to the legacy and work of George Maciunas. In 2005, they presented &quot;To George With Love: From the Personal Collection of Jonas Mekas&quot;, which displayed original drawings, posters, objects, and other Fluxus items as well as various films from the Fluxfilm Anthology, a collection of 41 films made by Fluxus artists. In 2006, the gallery presented &quot;George Maciunas, 1953–1978: Charts Diagrams, Films, Documents, and Atlases&quot;. In 2007, the Maya Stendhal Gallery collaborated with the city of Vilnius, Lithuania, to open the Jonas Mekas Visual Arts Center. The center&#x27;s inaugural exhibition examined the lives and work of prominent figures within the history of the avant-garde, including George Maciunas. In 2008, the gallery held an exhibition devoted to Maciunas&#x27; architectural projects, in particular, a utopian housing structure Maciunas drafted in the late fifties and early sixties, entitled &quot;George Maciunas: Prefabricated Building Systems&quot;.

In 2010 problems arose between Harry Stendhal and Jonas Mekas in which some of the practices of the Stendhal Gallery fell into question, causing concern among surviving Fluxus artists. The George Maciunas/Fluxus Foundation, became active in November 2011, presenting exhibitions on the contemporary applications of Maciunas&#x27; inventions and theories regarding education and architecture. These exhibitions have explored his ideas as precursors to adaptive design processes and global networks. In September 2012, the foundation held an exhibition on Maciunas&#x27; architectural work centered on his prefabricated modular mass-housing system known as Fluxhouse.

<text>Rabadan is a carnival festival that takes place in the town of Bellinzona, capital of southern canton of Ticino in Switzerland.

It is a very lively festival, especially alluring for its spontaneous popular character. It has been ongoing now for more than 150 years. It attracts people from the rest of Switzerland and neighbouring Italy and during its peak evenings tens of thousands of people take to the streets wearing colourful carnival costumes.

<text>Henderson Island is an uninhabited island in the south Pacific Ocean. It is part of the Pitcairn Island Group, together with Pitcairn, Oeno, and Ducie Islands. Measuring , it has an area of and is located northeast of Pitcairn Island, which is the only inhabited island of the group. It has poor soil and little fresh water, and is unsuitable for agriculture. There are three beaches on the northern end and the remaining coast comprises steep (mostly undercut) cliffs up to in height. In 1902, it was annexed to the Pitcairn Islands colony, which is now a British Overseas Territory.

Henderson is one of the last two raised coral atolls in the world whose ecosystems remain relatively unaffected by human contact, along with Aldabra in the Indian Ocean. In 1988, it was designated a World Heritage Site by the United Nations. Ten of its 51 flowering plants, all four of its land birds and about a third of the identified insects and gastropods are endemic – a remarkable diversity given the island&#x27;s size.

== History ==
The island was settled by Polynesians – possibly as early as 800 AD – but by the 1600s it had been abandoned. There is good evidence that the island was continuously occupied for a 600-year period sometime between those dates. The reasons for the inhabitants’ disappearance remain uncertain, but they may relate to an exhaustion of resources and to the disappearance around the same time of the Polynesians on Pitcairn Island, on whom those on Henderson would have relied for many of the basics of life, especially for the stone needed to make tools. The Pitcairn Polynesians may in turn have disappeared because of the decline of nearby Mangareva; thus, Henderson was at the end of a chain of small, dependent colonies of Mangareva. The Polynesians that disappeared may have later migrated further to a bigger island to the east in Easter Island, for it has been noted that the jumping-off points for the early Polynesian colonization of Easter Island originally from Mangareva are more likely to have been from Pitcairn and Henderson, which lie about halfway between Mangareva and Easter. Great similarity between the Rapa Nui language and Early Mangarevan, similarities between a statue found in Pitcairn and some found in Easter Island, resemblance of tool styles in Easter Island to those in Mangareva and Pitcairn, and correspondences of skulls found in Easter Island to two found in Henderson all suggest that Henderson and Pitcairn were early Mangareva stepping-stones to Easter Island, which, in 1999, a voyage with reconstructed traditional Polynesian boats was able to reach from Mangareva after merely a seventeen-and-a-half-day voyage.

On 29 January 1606, Portuguese captain Pedro Fernandes de Queirós, leading a Spanish expedition in search of the fabled great south land (Terra Australis), was the first European to see the island, and named it &quot;San Juan Bautista&quot;. More than 200 years later, on 17 January 1819, Captain Henderson of the British East India Company ship &quot;Hercules&quot; rediscovered the island. Six weeks later, on 2 March 1819, Captain Henry King, of the &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, landed on the island to find the king&#x27;s colours already flying. His crew scratched the name of their ship into a tree, and for a while the island was known as both Elizabeth and Henderson Island. Thomas Raine, master of the ship &quot;Surry&quot; of London, named it Henderson&#x27;s Island because it appeared to him, from a conversation he had with James Henderson at Valparaíso, to have been Henderson&#x27;s discovery.

On 20 November 1820, a sperm whale rammed and sank the Nantucket whaleship &quot;Essex&quot; (a report of which inspired Herman Melville to write &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;), and the ship&#x27;s 20 crewmen arrived at Henderson on 20 December in three small whaleboats. They found the island&#x27;s only known drinkable water source – a brackish spring on the north shore, exposed at half tide – and ate fish, birds, eggs, crabs and peppergrass, but within a week they had largely exhausted the readily available food. Therefore, on 27 December, the three boats set sail for South America, leaving behind Thomas Chappel, Seth Weeks and William Wright, who chose to stay and survived until their rescue several months later, on 9 April 1821.

In 1902, Henderson Island, along with Oeno and Ducie islands, was formally annexed to the British Empire by Captain G. F. Jones, who visited the islands in a cutter with a crew of Pitcairn Islanders. In August 1937, HMS &quot;Leander&quot;, on a journey from Europe to New Zealand, carried out an aerial survey of Henderson, Oeno and Ducie, and, on each island, a British flag was planted and an inscription was nailed up proclaiming: &quot;This island belongs to H.B.M. King George VI&quot;.
In 1957, a 27-year-old American, Robert Tomarchin, lived the life of a castaway on the island for approximately two months, accompanied by a pet chimpanzee, apparently as a publicity stunt, until people from Pitcairn rescued him in two longboats.

In the early 1980s, the American businessman Arthur &quot;Smiley&quot; Ratliff expressed interest in establishing a mansion for himself on the island, with an airstrip. The Pitcairn Island Council approved his plans but, after environmentalists lobbied to protect the natural ecology and environment of the island, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office overrode the decision and vetoed the proposed development. Henderson Island was listed as a World Heritage Site in 1988.

In 2019, a group of scientists, journalists, film makers, and artists took part in an expedition to Henderson Island to investigate plastic pollution and marine litter on the island. Five members of the expedition became stranded on the island when their inflatable craft capsized. In 2021, Pitcairn Islanders participated in a scientific expedition to assess the effects of climate change.

In March 2022 a Royal Navy survey by HMS &quot;Spey&quot;, as part of an effort to update maritime charts regarding British Overseas Territories, found the island to be south of its indicated position. The existing data dates to an aerial survey in 1937, indicating a calculation error when the chart was produced.

== Natural resources ==
Since the introduction of aluminium-hulled long-boats in the 20th century, Pitcairners have made regular trips to Henderson to harvest the wood of &quot;miro&quot; and &quot;tou&quot; trees. Usually, they venture to Henderson once per year, but they may make up to three trips if the weather is favourable. Pitcairners carve the wood into curios for tourists, from which they derive much of their income.

== Geography ==

Henderson Island is a raised coral atoll that, with Pitcairn, Ducie and Oeno islands, forms the Pitcairn Island Group. The nearest major landmass is the continent of South America, more than away to the east. This coral limestone island sits atop a conical (presumed volcanic) mound, rising from a depth of roughly . Its surface is mostly reef-rubble and dissected limestone – an extremely rugged mixture of steep, jagged pinnacles and shallow sinkholes. The island is mostly encircled by steep limestone cliffs up to high.

There are three main beaches, on the northwest, north, and northeast shores, and the north and northwest beaches are fringed by reefs. The depression at the island&#x27;s centre is thought to be a raised lagoon. There is only one known potable water source, a brackish spring on the north shore exposed at half tide, rising from a crevice in flat rock, large surfaces of which compose the face of the beach. The surrounding ocean tidal range is about at spring tide.

== Flora ==

Apart from five species bordering the beaches, including coconut palms, the vegetation is undisturbed. Henderson Island is covered by tall tangled scrub forest, more thinly covered in the central depression. It has 51 native species of flowering plants, ten of which are endemic to the island. Dominant tree species include coconut palms, &quot;Pandanus tectorius&quot;,&quot; Thespesia populnea&quot; (miro), &quot;Heliotropium foertherianum&quot;, &quot;Cordia subcordata&quot; (tou), &quot;Guettarda speciosa&quot;, &quot;Pisonia grandis&quot;, &quot;Geniostoma hendersonense&quot;, &quot;Nesoluma st-johnianum&quot;, &quot;Hernandia stokesii&quot;, &quot;Myrsine hosakae&quot;, and &quot;Celtis sp.&quot;

== Fauna ==
=== Birds ===
The island has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area for its endemic landbirds and breeding seabirds. The island is home to four extant endemic land bird species – the Henderson fruit dove, Henderson lorikeet, Henderson reed warbler and the flightless Henderson crake. Of the fifteen non-endemic seabird species found, nine or more are believed to breed on the island. Breeding colonies of the globally endangered Henderson petrel formerly existed on Ducie but were wiped out by invasive rats by 1922. It is believed to now nest uniquely on Henderson Island. 

Three species of the family Columbidae – the Henderson ground dove, the Henderson imperial pigeon and the Henderson archaic pigeon – as well as the Henderson sandpiper, were formerly endemic to the island, but became extinct around 1000 AD after the arrival of Polynesians. Bones associated with prehistoric Polynesian settlement sites dating to somewhere between 500 and 800 years ago include those of the Polynesian storm petrel, and of Christmas shearwater and red-footed booby that still visit but no longer nest. It is hypothesized that the Polynesian settlers may have driven these bird species, along with six terrestrial snail species, to local extinction, and this loss of a ready and regular food supply may have contributed to the Polynesians&#x27; subsequent disappearance.

=== Other animals ===

The invertebrate species are largely unknown but a third of the island&#x27;s known non-marine gastropods and insects are endemic. There are also crabs, including coconut crabs. There are no native mammals but the Pacific rat, introduced by Polynesians 800 years ago, abounds. One species of gecko (&quot;Lepidodactylus lugubris&quot;) and three species of skink (&quot;Cryptoblepharus poecilopleurus&quot;, &quot;Emoia cyanura&quot;, &quot;Ornithuroscincus noctua&quot;) have been recorded, and are also suggested to have been introduced by Polynesians. There are also reports of a second unidentified gecko which may be endemic, and green sea turtles nest on the beaches.

=== Biological risk ===
Land bird populations appear to be relatively stable but there is a high risk of introduction to the island of predators, disease vectors, and diseases by unauthorized landings of yachts. Introduction of the Eurasian black rat or the domestic cat would be likely to cause almost immediate extinction of the ground-dwelling Henderson crake and possibly other species. The endemic birds may have no immunity to the fatal avian pox which is transmitted by biting flies such as Hippoboscidae.

Between July and November 2011, a partnership of the Pitcairn Islands Government and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds implemented a poison baiting programme aimed at eradicating the Pacific rat. Mortality was massive but of the 50,000 to 100,000 population, 60 to 80 individuals survived, and the population has now fully recovered.

== Plastic debris ==
Research published in April 2017 looked at debris on several beaches, and reported &quot;the highest density of plastic rubbish anywhere in the world&quot; as a result of the South Pacific Gyre. The beaches contain an estimated 37.7 million items of debris together weighing . In a study transect on North Beach, each day 17 to 268 new items washed up on a section. The study noted that purple hermit crabs (&quot;Coenobita spinosus&quot;) make their homes in plastic containers washed up on beaches, and the debris may reduce shoreline gastropod diversity, may contribute to a reduction in the number of sea turtle laying attempts and may increase the risk of entanglement for coastal-nesting seabirds.

In June 2019, an expedition organised by the UK Government attempted to remove some of the plastic debris from the island&#x27;s East beach. The team collected six tonnes of rubbish, but weather conditions hampered efforts to take the rubbish off the island. Plastic gathered during this expedition was taken for recycling, being manufactured into new objects for use on Pitcairn Island and other island communities in the region. A followup expedition in July 2022 collected further plastic.

<text>Ducie Island (; ) is an uninhabited atoll in the Pitcairn Islands group, which also includes Pitcairn, Henderson and Oeno islands. Ducie lies east of Pitcairn Island, and east of Henderson Island, and has a total area of , which includes the lagoon. It is long, measured northeast to southwest, and about wide. The island is composed of four islets: Acadia, Pandora, Westward and Edwards.

Despite its sparse vegetation, the atoll is known as the breeding ground of a number of bird species. More than 90% of the world population of Murphy&#x27;s petrel nests on Ducie, while pairs of red-tailed tropicbirds and fairy terns make around 1% of the world population for each species.

Ducie was first discovered in 1606 by Pedro Fernandes de Queiros, who named it &quot;Luna Puesta&quot;, and rediscovered by Edward Edwards, captain of , who was sent in 1790 to capture the mutineers of . He named the island &quot;Ducie&quot; in honour of Francis Reynolds-Moreton, 3rd Baron Ducie. In 1867, a claim on the island was made under the United States&#x27;s Guano Islands Act, but the claim was never bonded. The United Kingdom annexed the island on 19 December 1902 as part of the Pitcairn Islands. Due to its inaccessibility and the distance from Pitcairn, Ducie is rarely visited, receiving one or two visits a year from cruise ships.

==History==
The island was discovered by a Spanish expedition led by Portuguese sailor Pedro Fernandes de Queirós on 26 January 1606, during an expedition that began in Callao, Peru. Supported by Pope Clement VIII and Philip III of Spain, Queirós was given the command of the &quot;San Pedro&quot;, &quot;San Pablo&quot; and &quot;Zabra&quot;. The fleet was nicknamed &quot;Los Tres Reyes Magos&quot; (&quot;The Three Wise Men&quot;). The objective of the expedition was to take soldiers, friars and provisions to establish a colony in the Santa Cruz Islands.

Ducie Island was the first of eighteen discoveries on the trip. Queirós named the island &quot;Luna Puesta&quot; (roughly, &quot;moon that has set&quot;). On the same day, he also sighted two more islands, one that he named &quot;San Juan Bautista&quot; (&quot;St John the Baptist&quot;), and the other &quot;La Encarnación&quot; (&quot;the Incarnation&quot;). It is unclear which one was Henderson island and which one was Pitcairn. The confusion was later compounded when a chart produced by Admiral José de Espinosa marked Ducie as &quot;La Encarnación&quot;, rather than as &quot;Luna Puesta&quot;.

The island was rediscovered and named Ducie Island on 16 March 1791 by Captain Edward Edwards, of , who had been despatched from Britain in 1790 to arrest the &quot;Bounty&quot; mutineers. Edwards named it in honour of Francis Reynolds-Moreton, 3rd Baron Ducie, under whom he had served earlier in his career. HMS &quot;Pandora&quot; turned northwards from Ducie and, because of this change of course, Edwards did not sight the other islands of the group. If HMS &quot;Pandora&quot; had maintained its course, it would eventually have reached Pitcairn Island and found the &quot;Bounty&quot; mutineers.

The crew of the whaleship &quot;Essex&quot;, which a whale had attacked and sunk in November 1820, mistakenly believed that they had reached Ducie after a month at sea in two whaleboats. In fact they had reached Henderson Island. Captain Thomas Raine of &quot;Surrey&quot;, who was searching for the survivors of &quot;Essex&quot;, in 1820 made the first recorded landing on Ducie. Frederick William Beechey, who arrived in during November 1825, wrote the first comprehensive description of the island. Beechey&#x27;s expedition did not land in the atoll, but members of the crew sailed around it in small boats. Based on Beechey&#x27;s survey, the first Admiralty chart of the island was published in 1826. For nearly a hundred years it was the only available map of the island.

In March 1867, John Daggett filed a claim on Ducie Island (referring to it as &#x27;Ducer Island&#x27;) with the U.S. State Department under the Guano Islands Act. Daggett was instructed to provide further information, including to affidavits of the quality and quantity of guano present on the island; however, according to a 1933 State Department report, Daggett never provided the additional information and the claim was never accepted by the United States.
On 5 June 1881, the mail ship &quot;Acadia&quot; ran aground on the island while returning from San Francisco, Peru after unloading its cargo. On the way to Queenstown or Falmouth for new orders, Master Stephen George calculated a route passing to the east of Ducie. George left the first mate in command at 6 am. Half an hour later, the first mate saw a white line, which he disregarded on the assumption that it was phosphorescence in the water. Later, realising that it was land, he manoeuvred to avoid running aground, but failed. The look-out excused himself by saying that he thought that the white land was a cloud. The crew made several unsuccessful attempts to re-float the ship, after which the master sailed one of the ship&#x27;s boats to Pitcairn Island. He was assisted there by the local inhabitants and returned aboard the &quot;Edward O&#x27;Brien&quot;, an American boat, to rescue the rest of the crew. The incident was later investigated in a court in Liverpool, where the ultimate cause of the wreck was left undetermined, though possible causes included a calculation error by the master or an unknown current that carried the ship to the island. The court declared the master not guilty of any wrongdoing. A stone marker with a memorial inscription is located at the landing point on Acadia Islet. It was unveiled to commemorate the recovery of the anchor in 1990. The wreck lies offshore from the memorial stone in about 10 metres of water.

In 1969, the atoll was proposed as an &quot;Island for Science&quot;, and was later recommended as a Ramsar Site. Major expeditions that came to the island to record its biota include the Whitney South Seas Expedition in 1922, the National Geographic Society-Oceanic Institute Expedition to Southeast Oceania of 1970–71 and the Smithsonian expedition of 1975. More recent expeditions include the MV Rambler Expedition by the Smithsonian in 1987, one by Raleigh International in the same year, the Sir Peter Scott Commemorative Expedition to the Pitcairn Islands of 1991–1992 (aka The Pitcairn Islands Scientific Expedition), In 2012, National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence Enric Sala produced &quot;Sharks of Lost Island&quot; including Ducie and all the Pitcairn Islands. Because of its inaccessibility, Ducie is rarely approached, but cruise ships make one or two landings per year. In addition, a book published in 2000 made the (unsubstantiated) claim that; unrecorded visits are known to be made by freighters and tankers that dump residues on the island or in the nearby waters.

===Sovereignty===
Although Captain Edward Edwards discovered the atoll in 1791, Ducie was not considered a British possession. In 1867 Ducie was claimed by the United States under the Guano Islands Act, which established that an uninhabited territory with guano deposits could be claimed as a US possession, so long as it was unclaimed by any other country. Despite claims on several other territories, based on various documents such as the Guano Islands Act, neither the United States nor the United Kingdom recognised the sovereignty claimed by each other. Neither of the two considered that the mere discovery of an island was sufficient to claim sovereignty over it, and often a formal act of possession was considered the proper procedure to claim rights over a territory. Ultimately, the United States did not assert its sovereignty over most of its claimed territories.

Under the 1893 Pacific Order in Council, Pitcairn Island was governed by the High Commissioner of the British Western Pacific Territories in Fiji. On 19 December 1902, commissioned by R. T. Simmons, the British Consul in Tahiti, Captain G. F. Jones and a group of Pitcairners visited the nearby islands and annexed them to the United Kingdom. In 1903 Ducie was annexed by the same procedure and placed under the authority of the Western Pacific High Commissioner. R. T. Simmons stated in a dispatch to the Foreign Office that James Russell McCoy had assured him that the islands had always been considered as dependencies of Pitcairn, and that he and other Pitcairners had frequently visited them in the past. This claim is contested by Donald McLoughlin on grounds of the distance between Pitcairn Island and Ducie Island and the lack of a suitable boat to navigate the distance between the two, casting doubt on whether they had ever visited Ducie.

On 4 August 1937, Captain J. W. Rivers-Carnac, commander of HMS &quot;Leander&quot;, reaffirmed British sovereignty over Ducie by hoisting the Union Flag and placing boards proclaiming the island to be the property of King George VI. Ducie was one of several islands thought valuable for potential seaplane bases, though they did not materialise. In 1953, the Pacific Order in Council ceased to have effect and the British Governor of Fiji was appointed Governor of the Pitcairn Islands, which became a separate British colony. A new constitution for the Pitcairn Islands was enacted on 10 February 2010, establishing that Ducie and the rest of the islands are ruled by a governor designated by the British monarch. The governor has a duty to enforce the provisions of the constitution.

== Geography ==
Ducie lies east of Pitcairn Island and is claimed by some to be the southernmost atoll in the world at 24°41&#x27; S latitude. However, Elizabeth Reef in the Tasman Sea is at 29°57 S latitude, so the assertion on behalf of Ducie Island is doubtful. Ducie Island&#x27;s land area is and its maximum elevation, occurring on the Westward islet, is .

Ducie is located west of the edge of the Easter Plate. It was formed approximately 8 million years ago, after Oeno Island was formed by a hotspot that later caused a magma leak generated in the Oeno lineation. The leak spread over fracture zone FZ2, which was formed by the third movement of the Pacific Plate. The atoll is part of the Oeno-Henderson-Ducie-Crough seamount, speculated to be part of the southern Tuamotus.

The atoll consists of four islets: Acadia—which is by far the largest—Pandora, Westward and Edwards. All three of the smaller islets can be accessed on foot from Acadia at low tide. The islets were named by Harald Rehder and John Randall, who visited the atoll during an expedition by the Smithsonian Institution in 1975.
*Acadia Islet, along the atoll&#x27;s north and east rim, is several times larger than the other three islets combined, measuring . Very long and thin, the islet is largely forested and is composed of ridges of coral rubble. It is named after the &quot;Acadia&quot;, a ship that was wrecked on Ducie in 1881.
*Pandora Islet, in the south, is the second largest. It is composed of sand and coral rubble that borders the lagoon. It is named after HMS &quot;Pandora&quot;.
*Edwards Islet lies immediately to the east of Pandora Islet and has the same characteristics. It is named after Edward Edwards, captain of HMS &quot;Pandora&quot;.
*Westward Islet, west of Pandora Islet, is the smallest. It appears sandy from a distance, but the soil is composed of coral rubble and dead shells. Its highest point rises above average sea level. It is named after the &quot;Westward&quot;, the ship that carried the members of the National Geographic Society and the Oceanic Institute during their 1970–71 expedition.

The atoll has a central lagoon, accessible by boat only by way of a channel wide located in the southwest, between Pandora and Westward Islets. It has a maximum depth of and its bottom consists of sand and coral. Whirlpools in the lagoon are common, caused by caves that drain the water from the lagoon into the ocean.

Pandora is known as being one of the three coastline vertices for Point Nemo, the set of coordinates in the South Pacific Ocean that represents the furthest point from any land in three directions.

== Flora ==
The vegetation in the atoll is sparse, because of the lack of fresh water. Only two species of vascular plant are currently known to grow there – one of the smallest such floras on any island. Acadia, Pandora and Edwards Islets are forested with &quot;Heliotropium foertherianum&quot;, but Westward Islet is not. &quot;Pemphis acidula&quot; has also been recorded on Ducie; specimens were found during an expedition in 1991.

During the expedition of Hugh Cuming in 1827 and the 1922 Whitney South Sea Expedition, &quot;Lepturus&quot; grass was found on Acadia Islet. However, it disappeared when storm waves deforested the island some time before the Smithsonian expedition of 1975. Thus &quot;H. foertherianum&quot; now dominates the vegetation of the islets. Additionally, there are a number of species of coralline algae, including &quot;Porolithon onkodes&quot;, &quot;Porolithon gardineri&quot;, and &quot;Caulerpa racemosa&quot;.

== Fauna ==
The atoll is populated by several species of birds, fish, and reptiles. In the lagoon, sparse, living coral can be found; the dominant species is &quot;Montipora bilaminata&quot; (family Acroporidae). Most of the coral in the lagoon is dead, presumed to have been killed by influxes of cold water.

===Birds===
Though no terrestrial birds are found on the atoll, Ducie Island is known for the seabirds that breed there. Birds that have been recorded nesting on the atoll include the red-billed tropicbird, red-tailed tropicbird, white tern, great frigatebird, masked booby, and red-footed booby. Wintering bristle-thighed curlews have been recorded as well. A number of tern species, including the sooty tern, blue noddy, brown noddy, lesser noddy, and white tern have been recorded, as have several members of the family Procellariidae: Kermadec petrel, Trindade petrel, Murphy&#x27;s petrel, and Christmas shearwater.

The island is particularly important for Murphy&#x27;s petrel, as more than 90% of its world population breeds on Ducie. Around 3,000 pairs of Christmas shearwaters, about 5% of the world&#x27;s total population, can be found on the island too. Meanwhile, the red-tailed tropicbirds and white terns that breed on Ducie are around 1% of the world population of each species. Phoenix petrels, which previously inhabited the atoll, apparently disappeared between the Whitney expedition in 1922 and the 1991–92 Pitcairn Scientific Expedition. The island has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA), principally for its colonies of Murphy&#x27;s, herald, and Kermadec petrels, and Christmas shearwaters.

===Fish===
In the lagoon there are around 138 fish species, which also inhabit southeastern Oceania, the Western Pacific, and the Indian Ocean. The lagoon is noted for its poisonous fish and dangerous sharks. The yellow-edged lyretail, the blacktip grouper, and the greasy grouper are known to cause ciguatera poisoning. The lagoon is also inhabited by Galápagos sharks and the whitetip reef shark. The Galápagos shark is dangerous to humans, while the whitetips are seldom aggressive unless provoked. Five species are found exclusively around the Pitcairn Islands: &quot;Sargocentron megalops&quot; (a species of squirrelfish), the spiny butterflyfish, the &quot;Henderson triplefin&quot; (a species of threefin blenny), an unnamed species of &quot;Alticus&quot; (a genus of combtooth blenny), and an unnamed species of &quot;Ammodytes&quot; (a genus of sand lance).

===Terrestrial vertebrates===
Lizards that inhabit the island include the white-bellied skink (&quot;Emoia cyanura&quot;), photographed by E. H. Quayle during an expedition in 1922, and a lizard reported in the journal of an expedition in 1935 by James Chapin. The species of the latter was uncertain, but it was thought to be a gecko, possibly either an oceanic gecko (&quot;Gehyra oceanica&quot;), or a mourning gecko (&quot;Lepidodactylus lugubris&quot;). The 1991–92 Pitcairn Islands Scientific Expedition found specimens of both the mourning gecko and the white-bellied skink. The only mammal known to inhabit Ducie is the Polynesian rat; In 1997, there was a successful project to eradicate these by Brian Bell (WMIL) and Graham Wragg (S/V Te Manu), to aid the conservation of bird species threatened by the rat population. Green sea turtles feed on Ducie, but have not been seen to breed there.

<doc id="932141" wikidata="Q5136582" url="?curid=932141" title="Cluedo (British game show)">
<text>Cluedo is a British game show based on the board game of the same name. Each week, a reenactment of the murder at the stately home Arlington Grange of a visiting guest was played and, through a combination of interrogating the suspects (of whom only the murderer could lie) and deduction, celebrity guests had to discover who committed the murder, which of six weapons (not usually the original six from the board game) and in which room it was committed, whilst viewers were invited to play along at home.

==Production==
The TV show is similar to an earlier detective fiction programme named &quot;Whodunnit?&quot;, where audience members had to guess the identity of the culprit after viewing prerecorded footage and interrogating suspects. &quot;The Doctors Who&#x27;s Who&quot; describes &quot;Whodunnit?&quot; as a celebrity quiz show &quot;not unlike Cluedo...where the panel would see some visual clues and a piece of film and decide who killed whom and in what capacity&quot;. &quot;Dalek I Loved You&quot; described &quot;Whodunnit?&quot; as &quot;an earlier version of Cluedo&quot;.

David McCallum, who played Professor Plum in series 2, said &quot;This is not the Royal Shakespeare Company but it still requires technique. It&#x27;s not overacting and it&#x27;s not underacting. it&#x27;s just &quot;slightly&quot; over the top&quot;. Series three&#x27;s Colonel Mustard Lewis Collins said in an interview with &quot;This Morning&quot;: &quot;Cluedo is the most nerve-racking thing I&#x27;ve ever done...&quot;, despite one magazine saying he was &quot;tailor-made&quot; for the role. Lysette Anthony, who played Miss Scarlett in series 3, said &quot;Cluedo is fun to play because it&#x27;s camp and it&#x27;s the complete opposite of what I&#x27;m about&quot;.

Leslie Grantham, series four&#x27;s Colonel Mustard, said &quot;I&#x27;m the last person you&#x27;d expect to play [him]. That&#x27;s why I was so flattered to be offered the role&quot;, and added that &quot;Cluedo is great fun to do. It&#x27;s fascinating to watch these asexual, inanimate characters brought to life&quot;. Despite the notion that the Colonel&#x27;s prior occupation would make him the obvious suspect for every murder, it is stressed that &quot;everyone has equally good reasons for bumping off the victim&quot;. Joan Sims, who played Mrs White in the 1990 Christmas special, would reprise her role in the 1995 &quot;Cluedo&quot; CD-I game.

Brindebella&#x27;s British analogue Arlington Grange, filed at Arley Hall in Cheshire, was chosen as it had a &quot;near perfect layout of downstairs rooms&quot; that the game of &quot;Cluedo&quot; requires. Built in 1744, Arley Hall was privately owned and had become a major tourist attraction since it was opened to the public in 1962. Producer Mark Gorton explained, &quot;the floorplan lends itself to the boardgame very well and that was a major consideration when choosing the location&quot;. The Cheshire mansion was only 18 miles from the Granada studios in Manchester where the live portions were taped, and open the public only at certain times of the year, both of which made filming easier. The house had to be furnished to fit the 1930s period that the show is set in, while some original furniture was deemed &quot;ideal for the programme&quot;; Gorton noted, ”as far as the owners were concerned, as long as the items weren’t too valuable we were free to use them&quot;.

A Billiard Room had to be constructed as Arlington lacked one, which was created in a front drawing room with props including a billiard table, scoring devices, and cues. A huge table was added to the Dining Room with a series of gothic high-backed chairs; Gorton noted, &quot;we also added a variety of strange stuffed animals to lend to it a kind of Addams Family feel&quot;. In contrast, the Library needed little attention to appear on screen, while the Study needed little alteration besides triptychs and a Bakelite telephone. In later series the Kitchen was a mock-up created in a spare room, as the real kitchen was in use for visitors to Arley Hall and production decided it &quot;felt...too modern for us&quot;. The props team brought in an Aga, refrigerator, pine table, a rack of pheasants, and sharp kitchen implements. The Drawing Room &quot;fitted the bill perfectly&quot; due to its &quot;unusual gothic fireplaces&quot; which featured leaping gargoyles and furnishings like oil paintings, however high-backed furniture with lions paw feet was added.

==Format==
Each episode starts with the host introducing the 6 possible weapons that change with each episode, and the same suspects and rooms. Then a prerecorded scenario plays out which culminates in the murder of a guest at Arlington Grange. This is followed by the studio sleuths cross-examining the characters to uncover further information. When one team succeeds, a spotlight shines on the culprit as they explain how and why they committed the crime. Despite the episode ending with one of the suspects confessing to murder, all six would return in the next episode as if nothing had happened.

==Episodes==


==Critical reception==
&quot;Understanding the Global TV Format&quot; likened the show to &quot;Voce Decide&quot;, describing them both as &quot;a hybrid, an amalgamation of a gameshow with a fictional situation and story&quot;. Similarly, &quot;The A to Z of Australian Radio and Television&quot; deemed the Australian version a &quot;hybrid gameshow/whodunnit&quot;. One magazine said the show &quot;promise[s] to keep us guessing till the very end&quot;. One magazine noted the difficulties involved in giving life to a one-dimensional character &quot;when the only source material they have to work on comes out of a small cardboard box&quot;. One magazine noted the &quot;high level of talent the show can attract&quot;, putting it down to &quot;Cluedo&quot; being a game that most households (including those of celebrities) grew up with. &quot;Cluedo&quot; fansite Cluedofan deemed it &quot;an absolutely brilliant TV gameshow&quot;.

On his stint as host, Chris Tarrant was later quoted as saying, &quot;I absolutely hated hosting Cluedo; it&#x27;s the worst thing I&#x27;ve ever done. It took forever to make the thing. We used to have to turn the studio audience over just to make sure they didn&#x27;t get any bed sores.&quot;

===Controversy===
In the second episode of the fourth season, Col. Mike Mustard murdered former comrade and property developer Sir Nigel Hussey (Ian McNeice) with a G-string in the kitchen. A short time after the episode aired, the producers received a letter that was written by the family of one Felix Reese, who himself was a taxi driver who was shot in the head by Leslie Grantham (the actor playing Col. Mustard) while the future star of &quot;EastEnders&quot; was a soldier stationed in Germany. The Reeses found it distasteful that someone who performed an illegal killing as a soldier would be cast as someone who performed an illegal killing as a soldier. Matthew Wright from &quot;The Sun&quot; asked Grantham about the &quot;irony&quot; of this turn at a press conference, which angered the actor.

The show is reported to be a &quot;very interesting novelty, despite having gone unnoticed.&quot; It has been deemed an &quot;innovative contest&quot;.

<text>The cruiser tank (sometimes called cavalry tank or fast tank) was a British tank concept of the interwar period for tanks designed as modernised armoured and mechanised cavalry, as distinguished from infantry tanks. Cruiser tanks were developed after medium tank designs of the 1930s failed to satisfy the Royal Armoured Corps. The cruiser tank concept was conceived by Giffard Le Quesne Martel, who preferred many small light tanks to swarm an opponent, instead of a few expensive and unsatisfactory medium tanks. &quot;Light&quot; cruiser tanks (for example the Cruiser Mk I) carried less armour and were correspondingly faster, whilst &quot;heavy&quot; cruiser tanks (such as the Cruiser Mk II) had more armour and were slightly slower.

The British cruiser tank series started in 1938 with the A9 and A10 cruiser tanks, followed by the A13, A13 Mark II, the A13 Mark III Covenanter in 1940 and the A15 Crusader which entered service in 1941. The Crusader was superseded by the A27 Cromwell in 1944. The A34 Comet, a better-armed development of Cromwell, began to enter service in late 1944. The Centurion tank of 1946 became the &quot;Universal tank&quot; of the United Kingdom, transcending the cruiser and infantry tank roles and becoming one of the first main battle tanks (MBT).

==Background==
Dissatisfaction with experimental medium tank designs of the mid-1930s led to the development of specialised fast cruiser tanks, where armour thickness was sacrificed for speed and infantry tanks, in which speed was sacrificed for heavier armour. Financial constraints had made it impossible to produce a vehicle suitable for close support and for exploitation. The thinking was behind several tank designs which saw action during the Second World War. British armoured operations theory flowed from the decision to build two types of tank and equip two types of unit and formation. Cruisers were operated by armoured regiments of the Royal Armoured Corps, established on 4 April 1939, in armoured divisions, some regiments coming from the Royal Tank Regiment (RTR) and some from cavalry regiments converted during the war. Infantry tanks went to Army Tank Battalions, sometimes grouped administratively into Army Tank Brigades of the RTR. Small, fast, lightly armed tanks like the Light Tank Mk VI operated as reconnaissance vehicles.

Giffard Le Quesne Martel originated the cruiser concept while Assistant Director and then Deputy Director of Mechanisation at the War Office in the 1930s. Martel considered that medium tanks were too complicated and expensive for infantry support, where they would be too vulnerable to anti-tank weapons and rejected claims that they could fire accurately when moving, so would gain no benefit from their speed. Martel preferred a large number of smaller and simpler tanks to swamp an opponent, instead of a few comparatively expensive medium tanks. Work should continue on a universal tank in the long term but from 1936 to 1939, Martel gave much thought to the infantry tank; he did not want medium tank development to be split but saw the logic of it, given the constraints on tank development. Tanks were necessary for mobile operations in armoured divisions and for infantry support in attacks on fortified defensive positions; a vehicle satisfactory for both tasks appeared to be impossible to attain. Two types of vehicle led to two theories and procedures, infantry tank thinking coming from the experience of tank operations from 1916 to 1918, when British tanks had been used for infantry support. Armoured division theory emphasised the speed of cruiser tanks and independent action to protect flanks, attack the opponent&#x27;s flanks and rear, to counter-attack and conduct pursuit operations.

==Development==

Like naval cruisers, cruiser tanks were fast and mobile for operations independent from slower-moving infantry with their heavier infantry tanks and artillery. When gaps had been forced through the opponent&#x27;s front by the infantry tanks, cruisers were to penetrate to the rear and attack lines of supply and communication centres in accordance with the theories of J.F.C. Fuller, Percy Hobart and Basil Liddell Hart. The cruiser tank was designed for use in a manner similar to cavalry, which made speed the most important factor and to achieve this, early cruisers were lightly armoured and armed to save weight.

The emphasis on speed unbalanced the British designs; on limited engine power, the speed was possible only by sacrificing armour protection (by comparison infantry tanks operating at soldiers&#x27; pace could carry far more armour). The idea that &quot;speed is armour&quot; was considered most important in the Royal Tank Corps. It was not realised that the principle of mobility was a liability against the German policy of accepting lower speeds for superior armour and armament, ensuring that even one round from a German medium tank could easily destroy a cruiser.
An even bigger problem for most cruiser tanks was the small calibre of their main gun. The first cruisers were armed with the 2-pounder (40 mm) gun. This gun had adequate armour penetration against early war tanks but was never issued high explosive ammunition. This made the cruisers less able to deal with towed anti-tank guns, which was a serious deficiency at the long ranges of engagements during the Desert Campaign. The additional machine gun turret (as mounted on the Crusader) was no substitute for HE rounds. As the armour of German tanks increased British cruisers were up-gunned with the more powerful 57 mm Ordnance QF 6 pounder, starting with the Crusader Mk. III (an interim move pending the introduction of the next cruiser tank). Early marques of what would become the Cromwell were also fitted with the 6-pounder but the gun still did not have a satisfactory HE round. The Cromwell as planned was to have a High Velocity 75 mm gun but the gun was too large for the turret ring and so it was decided that the new Cromwell tanks would be fitted with the QF 75 mm (a bored-out 6-pounder that could take US 75 mm ammunition). The new 75 mm gun provided greater HE capability at the expense of some armour penetration and it was still adequate to deal with the majority of German armoured vehicles. Part of the Cromwell&#x27;s success was its high-power to weight ratio, provided by the adoption of the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine as the Meteor, which delivered sufficient power for the Cromwell to have a maximum speed around on roads. The M4 Sherman had a top speed on roads of about . The Cromwell also had slightly superior cross-country speed and mobility. The new engine enabled the tank to be far more heavily armoured and armed than previous cruiser designs.

As the Cromwell could not be fitted with the HV 75 mm, work was undertaken to produce a tank for the powerful 17-pounder anti-tank gun, able to take on the most powerfully-armed German vehicles. The Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger was developed, mounting a 17-pounder gun on a lengthened Cromwell hull in a new turret. The Challenger was an unhappy compromise, though it was popular with its crews. The cut in armour protection to allow the mounting of the larger gun meant it was not well suited to closer range engagements and it threw its tracks more often than the Cromwell. As the UK had large numbers of US M4 Sherman tanks, an extemporaneous conversion of the Sherman to take a 17-pounder (as the Sherman Firefly) proved effective in providing more 17-pounder-gun tanks. The Firefly accompanied Churchills, Shermans and Cromwells generally at a ratio of 1:4. The production of Fireflies greatly outpaced that of the Challenger but in Cromwell-equipped units, the Challenger was generally preferred as the Sherman had a slower road speed and inferior cross-country mobility.

The culmination of British efforts was the Comet tank with a cut down 17-pounder design, the 77 mm HV. The Comet was a further development of the Cromwell, a &quot;heavy&quot; cruiser tank, which sought to remove the need for 17-pounder armoured vehicles, such as the Challenger or Firefly. The Comet reduced its road speed in comparison to the Cromwell to , in favour of better armour protection and a weapon able to penetrate the armour of the heavier German tanks whilst not sacrificing HE capability. The tank had a short service life as design for the Centurion was already well underway, with the first prototype arriving in 1945. Despite the emphasis on mobility, most early cruiser designs were plagued by mechanical unreliability, notably in the hot and gritty desert of the North Africa Campaign. This problem was usually caused by rushed development and introduction into service. After the debacle in France of 1940, cruiser tank designs were ordered &quot;off the drawing board&quot;, particularly given the urgent need for tanks. The Liberty engine which also powered early Cruiser tanks was beginning to show its age and was being pushed to its limit in tanks such as the Crusader. This problem was not fully solved until the débût of the Cromwell in 1944, with its powerful and reliable Rolls-Royce Meteor engine.

==History==
=== Interwar ===

In 1936, the War Office decided on a light tank for the cavalry, a cruiser tank, a medium tank and an infantry or assault tank. By 1938, the medium tank had stagnated as a research project, in favour of heavier cruiser and infantry tanks and after the outbreak of war, the move towards heavy infantry tanks capable of breaking through the Siegfried Line (&quot;Westwall&quot;) on the German border.

In 1934, Sir John Carden of Vickers-Armstrongs had produced a &quot;Woolworth&quot; medium tank to a 1934 specification (General Staff number A.9) for a close support tank, using elements of the Medium Mk III design (which had been abandoned due to financial reasons) but lighter and using a commercial engine to be cheaper. It was accepted as an interim design for limited production as the Cruiser Tank Mark I. It was expected to be replaced by a Christie suspension design. From 1937–1938, 125 A9s were built. The A9 was lightly armoured but capable of and carried a highly-effective 2-pounder anti-tank gun.

The Cruiser Mk II (A10), was designed by Carden as an infantry tank, built to the same design with added armour for of protection. It was insufficiently armoured for the role but as a &quot;heavy cruiser&quot;, it was put into production in July 1938 as another interim design. It had the same gun as the A9, was the first to be equipped with the Besa machine gun and 175 Mk IIs were produced by September 1940. Experience with the A9 during the Battle of France in 1940 revealed shortcomings, including inadequate armour and a lack of space for the crew, but it saw useful service in France, the Western desert and Greece in 1941. Orders for the Mk I and Mk II Cruisers were limited, for an advanced and faster cruiser tank which would incorporate Christie suspension designed by J. Walter Christie and have better armour.
In 1936, General Giffard LeQuesne Martel, a pioneer in tank design who had published works on armoured warfare and pioneered the lightly armoured &quot;tankette&quot; concept to enhance infantry mobility, became Assistant Director of Mechanization at the War Office. Later that year, Martel had watched Soviet tanks at the Red Army&#x27;s autumn manoeuvres including the BT tank, which they had developed from Christie&#x27;s work. He urged the adoption of a tank that would use the suspension system and also follow the Christie practice of using a lightweight aircraft engine such as the Liberty L-12 engine or a Napier Lion. The government authorised purchase and licensing of a Christie design via the Nuffield Organization.

The tank A13 E1 was rudimentary and too small for British use but the Nuffield suspension was most effective and this became the basis of the Cruiser Mk III (A13). Following testing of two Nuffield-built prototypes (A13E2 and A13E3), the A13 was ordered into production and 65 were manufactured by mid-1939. The Mk III weighed , had a crew of 4, a 340 hp engine which gave a top speed of and was armed with a 2-pounder (40 mm) gun and a machine gun. When it was introduced in 1937, the army still lacked a formal tank division. The trackless element of the Christie suspension was discarded as adding little value for the extra complexity. The Cruiser Mk IV (A13 Mk II) had heavier armour than the Mk III and production started in 1938.

=== Second World War ===
The Tank, Cruiser, Mk VI, (Crusader), was used in large numbers in the Western Desert Campaign. The contemporary Covenanter was unreliable and was retained in the UK for training use. The Cavalier, Centaur and Cromwell tanks were the planned successors to the Covenanter and Crusader. Intended to be in production by 1942, the project was delayed and the Crusader was up-gunned as an interim measure with the Mk.III 6-pounder gun; the Cavalier was a development of Crusader. Centaur and Cromwell tanks were an alternative design using the Cavalier engine and the new Rolls-Royce Meteor respectively - the three vehicles were similar in appearance. Orders for the Cavalier were cut back while the similarity between Centaur and Cromwell meant some Centaurs were finished as Cromwells. The Cavalier was used for training while Centaur and Cromwell tanks went into action at the Invasion of Normandy. The Comet tank entered service in north-west Europe in 1945 but neither the Cromwell or Comet tanks were in sufficient numbers to replace American tanks in the British Army.
During the war, the development of much more powerful engines and better suspension enabled cruiser tanks to increase in size, armour and firepower while retaining their speed and mobility. With &quot;cruiser&quot; tanks similarly armoured to heavier, slower, infantry tanks, the convergence of cruisers and infantry tank designs made the distinction obsolete. The Centurion tank was designed as a heavy cruiser, by combining the mobility of a cruiser tank and armour of an Infantry tank. The Centurion transcended its cruiser tank origins and became the first modern British main battle tank.

== Cruiser tanks in other armies ==
In the 1930s, the Czechoslovak Army divided its tank into three categories, light tanks - cavalry, light tanks - infantry and medium tanks. The cavalry category was analogical to cruiser-tank concept. The cruiser-tank concept was also employed by Canada, and Soviet Union in the 1930s, as exemplified by the BT tank series (, [fast tank]).

<text>Karlos Montez Dansby (born November 3, 1981) is an American former professional football linebacker who played in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for Auburn Tigers and received All-American recognition. He was selected by the Arizona Cardinals in the second round of the 2004 NFL draft, and has also played for the Miami Dolphins, the Cleveland Browns, and the Cincinnati Bengals.

==Early life==
Dansby was an All-State linebacker and wide receiver at Woodlawn High School in Birmingham, Alabama, where he was a letterman in football, basketball, and track. He caught 51 passes for 857 yards and five touchdowns on offense, 81 tackles, six sacks, three interceptions, and two fumble recoveries on defense as a senior. In basketball, he played as a power forward, earning All-state honors as a junior. In track &amp; field, he competed in the jumping events and got a PR of 6.73 meters in the long jump as a junior.

==College career==
Dansby played for the Auburn Tigers football team while attending Auburn University from 2000 to 2003. He was a Butkus Award semi-finalist regarded as one of the premier defenders in college football. While he began his Auburn career at wide receiver, he shifted to outside linebacker as a sophomore. In 36 games for the Tigers, he recorded 218 tackles (128 solos) with 10 quarterback sacks, 31 stops for losses, seven forced fumbles, two fumble recoveries, 15 pass deflections, and eight interceptions for 107 yards in returns.

==Professional career==
===Arizona Cardinals (first stint)===
The Arizona Cardinals selected Dansby in the second round (33rd overall) of the 2004 NFL draft. Dansby was the third linebacker drafted in 2004.

On August 4, 2004, the Arizona Cardinals signed Dansby to a four-year, $3.95 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $2.45 million.

Throughout training camp, Dansby competed to be a starting outside linebacker against Levar Woods. Head coach Dennis Green named Dansby the backup outside linebacker to start the regular season in 2004, behind Levar Woods and James Darling.

He started in the Arizona Cardinals&#x27; season-opener at the St. Louis Rams and made two solo tackles in their 17–10 loss. On September 26, 2004, Dansby earned his first career start after surpassing Levar Woods on the Cardinals&#x27; depth chart. Dansby recorded four combined tackles and made his first career sack on quarterback Michael Vick during a 6–3 loss at the Atlanta Falcons in Week 3. In Week 7, he recorded two combined tackles, two pass deflections, and made his first career interception during a 25–17 victory against the Seattle Seahawks. On November 14, 2004, Dansby recorded five solo tackles, deflected a pass, and made two sacks on quarterback Kurt Warner before exiting in the fourth quarter of the Cardinals&#x27; 17–14 victory against the New York Giants in Week 10. He was inactive during the Cardinals&#x27; Week 11 loss at the Carolina Panthers due to a neck injury he sustained the previous week. In Week 13, he collected a season-high seven solo tackles in a 26–12 loss at the Detroit Lions. Dansby finished his rookie season in 2004 with 60 combined tackles (43 solo), five sacks, five pass deflections, an interception, and a forced fumble in 15 games and 11 starts.

Dansby entered training camp slated as a starting outside linebacker in 2005. Head coach Dennis Green named Dansby and Orlando Huff the starting outside linebackers to start the regular season. He started in the Arizona Cardinals&#x27; season-opener against the New York Giants and recorded three solo tackles, two pass deflections, two interceptions, a sack, and scored the first touchdown of his career during a 42–19 loss. Dansby intercepted a pass by Giants&#x27; quarterback Eli Manning and returned it for an 18-yard touchdown in the second quarter. In Week 7, he collected a season-high 11 combined tackles (nine solo) and made a sack in the Cardinals&#x27; 20–10 victory against the Tennessee Titans. He was sidelined during a Week 11 victory at the St. Louis Rams after suffering a groin injury. On December 24, 2005, he made four solo tackles, a pass deflection, and returned an interception by quarterback Mike McMahon for an 11-yard touchdown in a 27–21 win against the Philadelphia Eagles. He finished the 2005 season with 88 combined tackles (69 solo), four sacks, four pass deflections, three interceptions, and two touchdowns in 15 games and 15 starts.

In 2007, he started all 14 games he played and led team with 117 tackles, marking second season with 100+ tackles (103 in 2005). On February 14, 2008, he was given the Cardinals&#x27; franchise tag. He has been franchised twice by Arizona, in 2008 and 2009. Cardinals signed franchised Dansby to a one-year, $8.065 million contract. In 2008, Dansby led the Cardinals to the Super Bowl while again totaling over 100 tackles and making 4 sacks and intercepting two passes. Karlos Dansby&#x27;s 2009 franchise tag guaranteed him $9.7 million in salary in 2009 and would make him an unrestricted free agent in 2010.

In a first-round playoff game against the Green Bay Packers on January 10, 2010, Dansby recovered a fumble in overtime by Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers and returned it 17 yards for the game-winning touchdown in the highest scoring game in NFL postseason history.

===Miami Dolphins===
On March 5, 2010, Dansby signed with the Miami Dolphins to a five-year, $43 million contract with $22 million guaranteed, which made it the richest contract for an inside linebacker in NFL history until Patrick Willis signed a five-year, $50 million contract with the San Francisco 49ers. Dansby was released from the team on March 12, 2013.

=== Arizona Cardinals (second stint)===
On May 10, 2013, Dansby signed a one-year deal to return to the Cardinals.

===Cleveland Browns===

On March 11, 2014, Dansby signed a four-year, $24 million contract with the Cleveland Browns. The deal included $14 million guaranteed.

He was released by the Browns on March 16, 2016.

===Cincinnati Bengals===
Dansby signed with the Cincinnati Bengals on March 29, 2016.

===Arizona Cardinals (third stint)===
On March 10, 2017, Dansby signed a one-year contract with the Cardinals. In Week 9, Dansby picked off C. J. Beathard in a 20–10 win over the 49ers, earning him NFC Defensive Player of the Week. He retired at the end of the season having never been selected for a Pro Bowl despite having more career tackles than Hall of Famer Brian Urlacher; he had 1,422 tackles to Urlacher&#x27;s 1,361. However, he played on mostly mediocre teams for most of his career; he only made the playoffs twice and played on a winning team only one other time.

==Personal life==
Dansby trains at EVO Ultrafit in Phoenix, AZ. His family is from Birmingham, AL.

<text>Alsó-Fehér was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. Its territory is now in western Romania (central Transylvania). The latest capital of the county was Nagyenyed (present-day Aiud).

==Geography==

Alsó-Fehér county shared borders with Hunyad, Torda-Aranyos, Kis-Küküllő, Nagy-Küküllő and Szeben counties. The rivers Mureș and Târnava flowed through the county. Its area was 3,576.5 km2 around 1910.

==History==
Alsó-Fehér (Lower Fehér) county was formed when Fehér county was split in 1744 (the other half, Felső-Fehér county, consisted entirely of enclaves between Székely and Saxon &quot;seats&quot;). In 1876, when the administrative structure of Transylvania was changed, the territory of Alsó-Fehér was modified and parts of it were annexed to the counties of Torda-Aranyos and Seben (during the same administrative reform, Felső-Fehér county was entirely abolished and merged with other counties). In 1920, the Treaty of Trianon assigned the territory of the county to Romania. Its territory lies in the present Romanian counties of Alba, Sibiu (the south-east) and Mureș (a small northeastern part).

<text>The Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers&#x27; Institute (SAAMI, pronounced &quot;Sammy&quot;) is an association of American manufacturers of firearms, ammunition, and components. SAAMI is an accredited standards developer that publishes several American National Standards that provide safety, reliability, and interchangeability standards for commercial manufacturers of firearms, ammunition, and components. In addition, SAAMI publishes information on the safe and responsible transportation, storage, and use of those products.

==History==
The origins of SAAMI date back to World War I and the Society of American Manufacturers of Small Arms and Ammunition (SAMSAA). In 1913, the US War Department encouraged the firearms and ammunition industry to establish an organization to share new technology and establish common standards for small arms and ammunition. SAMSAA was officially formed in 1918, however became inactive by the early 1920s.

By the mid-1920s, the United States was still suffering the shortage of World War I strategic materials including brass, copper, and lead. By 1925, the U.S. Department of Commerce recognized the need for a revival of an organization like SAMSAA and at the same time was encouraging ammunition makers to participate in a product simplification program. This was intended to reduce waste of capital, material shortages, storage and transportation needs. In 1926, at the time of official founding of the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturer&#x27;s Institute, over 4,000 different shotshell loads were on the market. The government sanctioned program- conducted by SAAMI- eliminated more than 95% of them. In metallic cartridges the nearly 350 available loads offered were reduced 70%, often accomplished by reconciling cartridges with multiple names for essentially the same design.

In 1928, with market hunting and habitat destruction reducing wildlife populations to record lows, SAAMI funded Aldo Leopold&#x27;s wildlife studies which resulted in the books An American Game Policy and Game Management. This book became the foundation for modern wildlife management. In addition, SAAMI financially supported the Game Conservation Institute in Clinton, New Jersey, which was the first school providing wildlife management education for state and federal regulators.

In 1937, SAAMI was instrumental in gaining support of the firearms and ammunition industry for the passage for the Pittman-Robertson Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act. This legislation mandated the 11 percent excise tax on firearms and ammunition to be solely used for wildlife restoration and related purposes.

In the 1940s, SAAMI began publishing a series of informational booklets for educating the public on safe firearm and ammunition use, handling, and storage. Most notably, SAAMI published “The Ten Commandments of Safety, Published in the Interest of Making and Keeping Shooting a Safe Sport” millions of which have been distributed.

In 1961, SAAMI established the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) as an independent organization to promote, protect, and preserve hunting and shooting in the United States. By establishing the NSSF as a separate organization, SAAMI was able to focus on its mission of publishing technical standards for firearm and ammunition safety, interchangeability, reliability and quality.

In the 1970s, SAAMI became an accredited standards developer for the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and turned its technical standards for firearms and ammunition into five American National Standards. Also, during this time SAAMI started the transition from using a copper crusher chamber pressure measurement system for ammunition to piezoelectric transducer chamber pressure measurement systems.

In the 1980s, SAAMI conducted extensive testing of the reaction of sporting ammunition in various transportation accident scenarios. The resulting data was submitted to the US Department of Transportation in support of the inclusion of ammunition in the ORM-D shipping classification. In addition, SAAMI produced the first “Sporting Ammunition and the Fire Fighter” video, providing technical and safety information on fighting fires involving sporting arms ammunition. The video was updated in 2012 in cooperation with the International Association of Fire Chiefs to reflect the latest changes to technology.

In 2005, SAAMI was accredited as a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) with Consultative Status at the United Nations (UN) Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). Also, around this time period, SAAMI launched a partnership with the Commission Internationale Permanente pour l’Epreuve des Armes à Feu Portatives (“Permanent International Commission for the Proof of Small Arms,” C.I.P.) to harmonize the standards between the two organizations.

In 2012, SAAMI successfully led the effort in the UN Sub-Committee on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods to modify the Limited Quantities (LQ) classification to match the US ORM-D classification, mitigating any impact of the planned phaseout of the ORM-D classification.

==SAAMI Standards==
SAAMI is an accredited American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards developer. In that capacity, SAAMI publishes five American National Standards that provide safety, reliability, and interchangeability standards for commercial manufacturers of firearms, ammunition, and components. SAAMI&#x27;s standards are voluntary compliance standards which contain cartridge and chamber drawings, pressure and velocity standards, measurement procedures, equipment, and safety testing procedures. Currently published standards are as follows:

* SAAMI Z299.1 – 2018 - Voluntary Industry Performance Standards for Pressure and Velocity of Rimfire Sporting Ammunition for the Use of Commercial Manufacturers
* SAAMI Z299.2 – 2019 - Voluntary Industry Performance Standards for Pressure and Velocity of Shotshell Ammunition for the Use of Commercial Manufacturers.
* SAAMI Z299.3 – 2022 - Voluntary Industry Performance Standards for Pressure and Velocity of Centerfire Pistol and Revolver Ammunition for the Use of Commercial Manufacturers
* SAAMI Z299.4 – 2015 - Voluntary Industry Performance Standards for Pressure and Velocity of Centerfire Rifle Ammunition for the Use of Commercial Manufacturers
* SAAMI Z299.5 – 2016 - Voluntary Industry Performance Standards Criteria for Evaluation of New Firearms Designs Under Conditions of Abusive Mishandling for the Use of Commercial Manufacturers

==Published Resources==
SAAMI publishes a variety of information on its website for the benefit of the firearms, ammunition, and components industry and the general public.

===Technical===
SAAMI publishes the following technical resources:
* SAAMI Generally Accepted Firearms and Ammunition Interchangeability 
* SAAMI Generally Accepted Cartridge and Chambers
* Recoil Formulae
* Glossary of Industry Terms
* Technical FAQs

===Transportation and Storage===
* Transport Data Sheets 
* Glossary of Transport Terms

===Publications and Advisories===
* Firearms Safety Rules
* Advisories on firearms and ammunition that have been submerged in water.
* Informational publications on, range cleaning, ammunition storage, smokeless powder, primers, and sporting firearms.
* Sporting Ammunition and the Fire Fighter: What Happens When Ammo Burns?
* Smokeless Powder and The Fire Service

==SAAMI Committees==
SAAMI&#x27;s work is broken up by committee, each with a specific charter.

===Technical Committees===
SAAMI&#x27;s Joint Technical Committee (JTC) is made up of three sections, Ammunition, Firearms, and Muzzleloader. The technical committee is responsible for developing and maintaining SAAMI&#x27;s American National Standards. In addition, the committee publishes numerous technical publications and advisories, FAQs, and glossary terms. The JTC also works extensively with the Commission Internationale Permanente pour l’Epreuve des Armes à Feu Portatives (“Permanent International Commission for the Proof of Small Arms” (C.I.P.) to harmonize the standards between the two organizations.

===Logistics and Regulatory Affairs Committee===
The SAAMI Logistics and Regulatory Affairs Committee (SLARAC) is responsible for keeping members up to date on changes to transportation and storage regulations. The committee also provides science-based information to both international and domestic regulators. Committee members are part of SAAMI&#x27;s delegation to The United Nations Committee of Experts on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods (TDG) and The United Nations Committee of Experts on the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS). In addition, the committee participates in industry standard setting organizations such as the International Code Council, International Fire Code, National Fire Protection Association, and International Society of Explosives Engineers.

===Legal &amp; Legislative===
SAAMI&#x27;s Legal and Legislative Affairs Committee is responsible for tracking changes to product liability law and legislation that would impact firearm, ammunition, and component manufacturers. The committee also provides technical information to public policy makers.

===International Affairs Committee===
SAAMI&#x27;s International Affairs Committee is responsible for tracking international developments that would impact firearm, ammunition, and component manufactures. SAAMI is an accredited Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) with Consultative Status at the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). SAAMI serves as a resource to various committee members for technical information on firearms, ammunition, and components. SAAMI is also a member of the World Forum on Shooting Activities.

==SAAMI vs. C.I.P. Standards==
There are two internationally recognized sporting arms and ammunition standard setting organizations, SAAMI and Commission Internationale Permanente pour l&#x27;Epreuve des Armes à Feu Portatives (French for &quot;Permanent international commission for testing portable firearms&quot;) commonly abbreviated and referred to simply as “C.I.P.”

SAAMI and C.I.P. have had a long-term working relationship to harmonize standards between the two organizations. Prior to the establishment of this relationship, standards were developed independently which, in some cases, resulted in minor differences between the organizations’ standards.

===Pressure Measurement Differences===
For sporting arms centerfire cartridges there are three principal pressure measurement protocols, conformal piezoelectric transducer (SAAMI), drilled case piezoelectric transducer (C.I.P.), and copper crusher (SAAMI &amp; C.I.P.). The copper crusher is in limited use due to the increased efficiency of measuring pressure with a piezoelectric transducer-based data acquisition system. The two different piezoelectric pressure measurement protocols used by SAAMI and C.I.P. yield slightly different numerical values of pressure for any given cartridge. Current practices instituted in both organizations have been undertaken to ensure that pressure limits initially introduced by either SAAMI or C.I.P. are equivalent the other organization&#x27;s standard.

<text>Judd Records was started by Jud Phillips (died 1992), brother of Sun Records co-founder Sam Phillips. Early releases were mostly recorded in Nashville or Memphis, but carried an address of Memphis, New York City, and Florence, Alabama (Phillips&#x27; hometown). Judd Records was named for its founder but the name was misspelled in the artwork of the label having two &quot;D&#x27;s&quot;. 

From Judd 1016 onward, the label was pressed and distributed by National Recording Corporation, and the label sported the NRC logo and/or the words &quot;National Recording Corporation - Atlanta, GA&quot;. According to Jud Phillips&#x27; son, NRC acquired the Judd label originally on a handshake deal.

Judd&#x27;s biggest single was &quot;Rockin&#x27; Little Angel&quot; by Ray Smith, which topped out at #22 on the Billboard charts. 

Another Judd artist who went on to score on other labels was Tommy Roe. Roe&#x27;s initial recordings on Judd were originally released on Mark Four, a label produced by Roe&#x27;s manager, Cleve Warnock, but recorded at the NRC Studios in Atlanta. Arthur Alexander also released his first single on Judd &quot;Sally Sue Brown/The Girl That Radiates That Charm&quot; under his high-school nickname June Alexander. The only Judd album, Ray Smith&#x27;s &quot;Rockin&#x27; Little Angel&quot;, has been released on CD by NRC. 

Other Ray Smith single cuts have been released on CD by London-based Ace Records. Almost all of Ray Smith&#x27;s Judd and Sun studio tracks and cuts have been released on Germany&#x27;s Bear Family Records Records. NRC, Judd, and affiliated labels are owned and administered by National Recording Corporation.

<text>Brainscan is a 1994 American science fiction slasher film directed by John Flynn and written by Andrew Kevin Walker. The film stars Edward Furlong, Frank Langella, Amy Hargreaves, Jamie Marsh, and T. Ryder Smith. The soundtrack was composed by George S. Clinton.

==Plot==
After a car accident killed his mother and permanently injured his leg, teenager Michael Brower lives an isolated existence in his absent father&#x27;s house. He spends his spare time watching his neighbor and crush, Kimberly. A horror films and video games fan, Michael&#x27;s only friend is a similar-minded misfit named Kyle. They are members of the school&#x27;s Horror Club, which draws the principal&#x27;s ire. After Kyle tells him about a new, ultra-realistic game called &quot;Brainscan&quot;, Michael mail-orders the first disc.

The game warns Michael that the experience is similar to hypnotic suggestions. Trickster, the game&#x27;s host, greets him and encourages him to act like a psychopathic murderer. For the first mission, he murders a stranger, taking a foot as a trophy. Michael wakes up shocked and thrilled by the experience. However, he is horrified to discover that the exact same murder happened in the real world, down to the victim&#x27;s details.

Kyle begs Michael to let him play the game, but he refuses. Later, Trickster materializes into reality and torments Michael. His second mission is to kill a possible witness to the earlier murder. Michael refuses at first but eventually relents. This time, however, he has no memory of playing the game. He finds Kyle&#x27;s bloody necklace in his freezer and realizes Kyle was murdered.

Michael calls Kyle, but the phone is answered by Detective Hayden. Michael becomes paranoid that he will be sent to jail. Trickster continues plaguing him and ultimately instructs him to kill Kimberly.

At nightfall, Michael sneaks into Kimberly&#x27;s room but refuses to hurt her. Trickster reveals himself to be an evil counterpart within Michael&#x27;s mind. He possesses Michael, who resists him. Their struggle wakes Kimberly. Kimberly reveals she has been watching and photographing Michael, which allows him to break free from his own inner darkness. At the last minute, the Trickster materializes and opens the bedroom door. Detective Hayden enters and shoots Michael dead.

Michael awakens in his room, the whole experience having been a fantasy. After ranting at the game about his traumatic experiences, he excitedly realizes that no one died, including Kyle. Having gained confidence from the game&#x27;s iteration of Kimberly, he goes over to her house and asks her out, to which she agrees.

The next day, Michael brings the &quot;Brainscan&quot; disc to show the principal, who had demanded to preview all games and movies. He sees Trickster grinning at him in approval.

==Cast==

*Edward Furlong as Michael
*Frank Langella as Detective Hayden
*T. Ryder Smith as The Trickster
*Amy Hargreaves as Kimberly
*Jamie Marsh as Kyle
*Victor Ertmanis as Martin
*David Hemblen as Dr. Fromberg

==Production==
The script for &quot;Brainscan&quot; had initially been written in 1987 by Andrew Kevin Walker and originally was centered around a VHS tape, however after producer Michael Roy acquired the script he performed some uncredited re-writes turning the tape into an interactive CD-ROM video game in order to tap into the public fascination with virtual reality. The character of The Trickster was also a creation in the re-writes as the original script by Walker had no physical antagonist and was simply a voice who tormented Michael over the phone. Initially the climax was to have had the Trickster become a more deformed monster through usage of prosthetics and animatronics, but once Flynn saw the creature he opted to use more subtle digital effects as he felt the monster designs while horrific were &quot;too real&quot;.

John Flynn later recalled:
The main interest for me was the Trickster character (a cadaverous Alice Cooper-like entity who materializes from a CD-ROM computer game - Ed.). The Trickster was the core of the movie and what attracted me to the script. We found this stage actor (T. Ryder Smith) to play the Trickster and he was extraordinary. Eddie Furlong was a 15-year-old kid who couldn&#x27;t act. You had to &quot;slap him awake&quot; every morning. I don’t want to get into knocking people, but I was not a big Eddie Furlong fan.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack features hard rock, grunge, and heavy metal from then-emerging bands, including Alcohol Funnycar, Mudhoney, White Zombie, OLD, Dandelion, Primus, Tad, Pitchshifter, and the Butthole Surfers. It has the main title theme from George S. Clinton&#x27;s score.

==Reception==
Critical reception was mostly negative. Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a &quot;Rotten&quot; rating of 13%, based on 16 reviews. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave &quot;Brainscan&quot; a &quot;D&quot; rating, and stated &quot;Despite the lurid premise, &quot;Brainscan&quot; offers zero in the way of sick thrills&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; also gave a negative review stating, &quot;It&#x27;s a rare teen horror pic that can be faulted for excessive restraint, but &quot;Brainscan&quot; may be too tame for the creature-feature fans and slasher devotees who will be drawn by its ad campaign.&quot;

The film was released on Blu-ray by Mill Creek Entertainment on a special double feature of &quot;Brainscan&quot; and &quot;Mindwarp&quot;, reviewed by Jay Alan of the Horror News Network. He praised the acting and the soundtrack by Primus and White Zombie.

<text>Beszterce-Naszód was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. Its territory is now in northern Romania (north-eastern Transylvania). The capital of the county was Beszterce (now Bistrița).

==Geography==

Beszterce-Naszód county shared borders with the Kingdom of Romania, Austrian Bukovina and the Hungarian counties of Máramaros, Szolnok-Doboka, Kolozs, Maros-Torda and Csík. Its area was 4,167 km² around 1910.

==History==
Beszterce-Naszód county was formed in 1876, when the Saxon district of Bistritz/Bistrița was united with the former Transylvanian Military Frontier district of Năsăud (Romanian Border Regiment II), also joined by parts of the former Doboka and Belső-Szolnok counties. In 1920, the Treaty of Trianon assigned the territory of Beszterce-Naszód county to Romania. In 1940, by the Second Vienna Award, it was returned to Hungary and was expanded with additional territories from the former Kolozs County. After World War II, it became again part of Romania; the territory of the county is now in the (larger) Romanian county Bistrița-Năsăud.

<text>Paul Stupin is an American film and television executive.

== Biography ==
After graduating from Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, Stupin went to Los Angeles to work for NBC in series development. In 1986 he became a vice president for production at Tri-Star Pictures, overseeing such films as &quot;Steel Magnolias,&quot; and &quot;Short Circuit&quot;. From there, he was recruited to the fledgling Fox Network as executive vice president of series programming serving there from 1989 to 1992. Stupin&#x27;s greatest legacy was bringing a twenty-nine-year-old screenwriter, Darren Star, to producer Aaron Spelling. Star had ideas of a high school drama and Spelling, for the first time since the 1960s, had not one show on the air. The result of their partnership was &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, an immediate hit with the first episode scoring a phenomenal forty share among the 12-17 demographic.

Stupin left Fox to become an executive at Reeves Entertainment and then joined Columbia TriStar Television. In 1995, he read the script for a horror movie that had precipitated a bidding war between producers. The script was for &quot;Scream&quot; and the author was Kevin Williamson. Stupin thought Williamson would be ideal to create another high school drama. Williamson&#x27;s script, to become &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; was first offered to Stupin&#x27;s old network, but Fox turned it down. The WB leapt at it to fill their new night of programming, Tuesdays, with &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer.&quot; &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;; the show became an instant hit and a defining show for The WB. Stupin, while remaining an executive at Columbia, was one of &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&#x27;s&quot; executive producers. He will work as executive producer for the movie adaptation of the novel &quot;Betwixt&quot;, the storybook for the adaptation is written by Elisabeth Chandler. The teen horror film is an WBTV and CBS Studios production.

<doc id="932179" wikidata="Q6954392" url="?curid=932179" title="NITEL (Nigerian company)">
<text>Nigerian Telecommunications Limited (NITEL), was a monopoly telephone service provider in Nigeria until 1992 when the Nigerian government enacted the Nigerian Communications Commission act allowing new entrants into the telecommunications sector. During and after its years of monopoly, the performance of the firm was sub-par, a behavior similar to other state owned enterprises such as NEPA and government-owned water corporations. The firm was formed in 1985 as the welding together of two government entities, the telecoms arm of the Post and Telecommunications (P&amp;T) department under the Ministry of Communications and the Nigerian External Communications (NET).

A February 2008 report by the BBC revealed that the Nigerian government assumed the transnational corporation did not improve performance of NITEL and therefore stopped privatization in favour of Transcorp. In 2015, the government eventually finalized a transaction that saw NITEL and Mtel&#x27;s assets handed over to NATCOM. The deal was valued at $252 million.

In November 2017, Nitel appointed Nate James as vice president of account management.

== History ==

=== Post and Telecommunications Department (P&amp;T) ===
During colonial rule and until 1985, the Post and Telecommunications department provided mailing and internal telecommunication services between Nigerian cities while NET provided telecommunications services between selected Nigerian cities and foreign countries. Due to resource constraints, provision of services were planned in phases with expansion more pronounced between the 1950s and 1970s.

Telegraph services began in the 1880s and was initially managed by the Public Works Department until 1907 when those services were transferred to P &amp; T. In 1908, a manual telephone exchange with a magneto switchboard of 100 lines was introduced in Lagos and by 1920 the estimate of telephone lines in the country was 920, at 920. A year later, a multiple switchboard was introduced with a capacity for 800 lines and in 1941 a point to point connection with a teleprinter was introduced. In the 1950s, planned investments were launched that included expanding automatic telephone exchanges and trunk circuits, launching a Lagos to Port Harcourt microwave radio transmission route and introducing V.H.F. multi-channel radio transmission to more cities and towns. In 1961, they were more than 32,000 telephones line and 120 telephone exchanges. Investments in telecommunications moved the subscriber base to over 100,000 by 1973 and up to 400,000 by 1990.

=== Nigerian External Telecommunications ===
The history of NET can be traced to colonial rule towards the end of the nineteenth century. In 1886, a telegraph service between Lagos and London was provided by African Direct Telegraph Company, this company later became Imperial and International Communications after a merger and then Cable and Wireless. Upon independence, the government of Nigerian decided to go into a partnership with Cable and Wireless, acquiring interest in the Nigerian arm of Cable and Wireless, and renaming the company Nigerian External Telecommunications. The new firm provided international telephone, telex and telegraph services, high speed data transmission and transmission and reception of real time television but those services were mainly restricted to Lagos and major cities of Nigeria such as Ibadan, Enugu, Kaduna, and Port-Harcourt. The firm&#x27;s major investment was in building a HF transmission and receiving station.

The firm began providing automatic telex service in 1971 and in 1980, NET introduced international Direct Dialing and faster telex services between Nigeria and select Western countries. NET also offered private leased telegraph services with annual subscription fees to companies and managed television events transmitted or received via satellite such as FESTAC 77 and sporting events. For much of its existence, NET&#x27;s facilities were inadequate compared to the needs of the business and wider population, man times the lines were congested as available lines on the telephone trunks could not keep up with the traffic.

=== NITEL ===
Nigerian Telecommunications Limited was formed in 1985 as the combination of the telecommunications division of Post and Telecommunications and NET. The new company was formed to improve coordination of telecommunication services within the country, to make internal communications more commercial in objective and to reduce duplication of budgetary allocations and investments. NITEL inherited mostly analogue infrastructure from its predecessors and had to fund new investments in digital infrastructures. It introduced mobile telephony in 1992, through MTS, a partnership with Digital Communications Limited, an Atlanta-based firm. However, operationally, it was still inefficient, the lines were congested, the billing system was inefficient and the call completion rate for long-distance calls was below 50%. When new private telephone services emerged in Lagos during the 1990s, many of them depended on an unreliable NITEL for inter-connectivity services. In addition, demand for services in some cities was much higher than the capacity of NITEL while many NITEL lines were inoperative due to lack of maintenance of infrastructure or inadequate supporting cable network infrastructure.

In 2002, MTEL which had acquired the assets of MTS, obtained a GSM license.

Beginning in 2001, the company went through a period of botched sales and divestment, the first was the proposed sale of 51% stake to a group of investors under the trading name of Investors International London limited, the sale was cancelled after the investors failed to make the final bid price. Subsequently, the government stopped capital investment in the firm and approved a management turnaround contract with a firm called Pentascope in 2003. The contract was cancelled in 2005 after it became clear Pentascope did not have the adequate resources to run NITEL. Another failed divestment to Orascom in 2005 followed before the firm was sold to a subsidiary of Transcorp in 2007, but that sale was revoked in 2009. In 2014, the firm was sold to NATCOM, a group of investors led by Tunde Ayeni.

<doc id="932185" wikidata="Q1542136" url="?curid=932185" title="Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album was an Honor presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to recording artists for quality works on albums in the contemporary R&amp;B music genre. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

The award for Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album, which recognizes R&amp;B albums with more contemporary musical stylings, was first presented to Ashanti at the 45th Grammy Awards in 2003 for her self-titled debut album. Prior to the creation of this category, contemporary R&amp;B albums were eligible for the more general category Best R&amp;B Album. According to the category description guide for the 52nd Grammy Awards, the award is reserved for albums &quot;containing at least 51% playing time of newly recorded contemporary R&amp;B vocal tracks&quot; which may also &quot;incorporate production elements found in rap music&quot;. Award recipients included the producers, engineers, and/or mixers associated with the nominated work in addition to the recording artists.

Beyoncé holds the record for the most wins, with three (all of her first three solo albums have earned her the award). Usher is the only other artist to receive the award more than once. The award has been presented to artists from the United States each year to date. Beyoncé and Ne-Yo share the record for the most nominations, with three each. In addition, Beyoncé earned a nomination as a member of the group Destiny&#x27;s Child for the album &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot;. Brandy, Chris Brown, Janet Jackson and R. Kelly share the record for the most nominations without a win, with two each.

From 2012, this category was discontinued as part of a major overhaul of the Grammy Award categories. Recordings in this category were shifted back to the Best R&amp;B Album category.

Award discontinuation
In 2011, the Recording Academy dropped the number of Grammy award categories from 109 to 78. This decision was made to make the awards more significant by concentrating on fewer, more thorough categories. The Academy believed that having too many specialized awards lowered the significance of winning a Grammy. As part of these revisions, they abolished the Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album category and combined it with others to create a single award for Best R&amp;B Album.

One major reason for this consolidation was the growing overlap between &quot;traditional&quot; and &quot;contemporary&quot; R&amp;B. Contemporary R&amp;B frequently incorporates elements from various genres, such as hip-hop, pop, and electronic music, making it difficult to draw clear lines between forms. The Academy decided that combining these categories would better reflect the diversity of R&amp;B.

Neil Portnow, president of the Recording Academy at the time, stated that the objective was to prioritize the quality of Grammy Awards over the number of categories. Although some musicians and fans argued that modern R&amp;B had a distinct sound that deserved its prize, the Academy believed that this change would keep the awards in sync with the evolving music environment.

<doc id="932188" wikidata="Q1955527" url="?curid=932188" title="Alphitonia">
<text>Alphitonia is a genus of arborescent flowering plants comprising about 15 species, constituting part of the buckthorn family (Rhamnaceae). They occur in tropical regions of Southeast Asia, Oceania and Polynesia. These are large trees or shrubs. In Australia, they are often called &quot;ash trees&quot; or &quot;sarsaparilla trees&quot;. This is rather misleading however; among the flowering plants, &quot;Alphitonia&quot; is not closely related to the true ash trees (&quot;Fraxinus&quot; of the asterids), and barely at all to the monocot sarsaparilla vines (&quot;Smilax&quot;).

The name is derived from Greek &quot;álphiton&quot; (, &quot;barley-meal&quot;), from the mealy quality of their fruits&#x27; mesocarps. Another interpretation is that &quot;baked barley meal&quot; alludes to the mealy red covering around the hard cells in the fruit.

The lanceolate coriaceous leaves are alternate, about 12 cm long. The margins are smooth. Venation is pinnate. They have white to rusty complex hairs on the under surface. The petiole is less than a quarter the length of a blade. Stipules are present.

The small flowers form terminal or axillary clusters of small creamy blossoms during spring. The flowers are bisexual. Hypanthium is present. The flowers show 5 sepals, 5 petals and 5 stamens. The ovary is inferior. The fruits are ovoid, blackish non-fleshy capsules, with one seed per locule.

&quot;Alphitonia&quot; species are used as food plants by the larva the hepialid moth &quot;Aenetus mirabilis&quot;, which feed only on these trees. They burrow horizontally into the trunk, then vertically down.

<doc id="932201" wikidata="Q3568468" url="?curid=932201" title="William Byrd I">
<text>William Byrd I (1652 – December 4, 1704) was an English-born Virginia colonist and politician. He came from the Shadwell section of London, where his father John Bird (c. 1620–1677) was a goldsmith. His family&#x27;s ancestral roots were in Cheshire.

==Personal life==

On the invitation of his maternal uncle, Thomas Stegge Jr., in March 1669, William Bird/Byrd immigrated to Virginia. In Virginia, the spelling &quot;Byrd&quot; became standard. On October 27, 1673, he was granted on the James River. Byrd became a well-connected fur trader in what would later become the Richmond, Virginia area. Some of Byrd&#x27;s landholdings became (after his death) part of the site of modern-day Richmond, Virginia. About 1673, he married a 21-year-old widow named Mary (née Horsmanden) Filmer, a native of Lenham, England. Mary&#x27;s father had spent time in Virginia as a Cavalier fleeing Cromwell, and her former husband Samuel Filmer (third son of Tory author Robert Filmer) descended from the sister of Samuel Argall, governor of Virginia. 

William Byrd I and his wife would become the parents of William Byrd II and three daughters. Their daughter, Ursula, at age 16, married Robert Beverley Jr., Major Robert Beverley&#x27;s son. They had one child, William Beverley (1698–1756), and Ursula died in 1698, within a year of her marriage. Colonel William Beverley married Richard Bland&#x27;s daughter, Elizabeth Bland. They had four children. Their son, Robert, married Maria Carter on February 3, 1763. Her parents were Landon Carter and Maria Byrd.

==Biography==
In 1676, Byrd was a sympathizer of Nathaniel Bacon in Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion, and took an active part in the rebellion, first by helping persuade Bacon to take unlawful command of a militia and lead it against the Indians. He also rode with Bacon after the rebellion began and was involved in the sack of Warner Hall, confiscating goods amounting to £845, or the equivalent of what 40 slaves or servants would produce in a year. He later allied himself with the Governor and became a prominent citizen.

Also in 1676, Byrd established the James River Fort on the south bank of the James River in what is now known as the Manchester District of Richmond. Byrd was elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1677 and later served many years on the Governor&#x27;s Council.

In 1688, Theodorick Bland Jr. and his brother Richard conveyed 1,200 acres of their Westover Plantation property to William Byrd I in 1688 for £300 and 10,000 pounds of tobacco and cask. The mansion he built in 1690 were furnished with curtains, tables, chairs and bedsteads imported from Rotterdam. Byrd&#x27;s grandson built a Georgian mansion there in the 1750s.

Byrd died on 4 December 1704, at his plantation home of Westover, in Charles City County, Virginia. He is buried near the original site of the Westover Church.

<text>The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (SOED) is an English language dictionary published by the Oxford University Press. The SOED is a two-volume abridgement of the twenty-volume &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (&quot;OED&quot;).

==Print editions==
===Prequel===
The first editor, William Little, worked on the book from 1902 until his death in 1922. The dictionary was completed by H. W. Fowler, Jessie Coulson, and C. T. Onions. An abridgement of the complete work was contemplated from 1879, when the Oxford University Press took over from the Philological Society on what was then known as &quot;A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles&quot;. However, no action was taken until 1902, when the work was begun by William Little, a fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He laboured until his death in 1922, at which point he had completed &quot;A&quot; to &quot;T&quot;, and &quot;V&quot;. The remaining letters were completed by H. W. Fowler (&quot;U&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, and &quot;Z&quot;) and Mrs. E. A. Coulson (Jessie Coulson) (&quot;W&quot;) under the direction of C. T. Onions, who succeeded Little as editor. Onions wrote that &quot;SOED&quot; was &quot;to present in miniature all the features of the principal work&quot; and to be &quot;a quintessence of those vast materials&quot; in the complete OED.

===First edition===
The first edition was published in February 1933. It was reprinted in March and April of that year and again in 1934.

===Fourth edition===
The New SOED was prepared under the editorship of Lesley Brown 1980-1993 and was the first complete revision of the dictionary and should be considered a re-abridgement of the SOED and its supplements. The whole text was completely revised for the Fourth Edition, which was published in 1993 as the &quot;New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary&quot;. The book attempted to include all English words which had substantial currency after 1700, plus the vocabulary of Shakespeare, John Milton, Edmund Spenser and the King James Version. As a historical dictionary, it includes obsolete words if they are used by major authors and earlier meanings where they explain the development of a word. Headwords are traced back to their earliest usage. Includes 97,600 headwords, 25,250 variant spellings, 500,000 definitions, 87,400 illustrative quotations and 7,333 sources of quotations (including 5,519 individual authors).

===Fifth edition===
The fifth edition was published in 2002, and contains more than half a million definitions, with 83,500 illustrative quotations from 7,000 authors. The name Shorter Oxford English Dictionary was used to emphasize the link between this two-volume dictionary and the original twenty-volume OED.

===Sixth edition===
On 21 September 2007, the sixth edition appeared. The dictionary now included 600,000 words, phrases, and definitions, covering global English-speaking regions and 2500 new words and meanings from Oxford Dictionaries and Oxford English Corpus. As previously, the vocabulary included entries in general English from 1700 to the present day and in earlier major literary works. The dictionary included 80,000 quotations illustrating the use of words, thousands of newly discovered antedatings based on the continuing research for the OED, 2,500 new words and senses, thousands of antedatings of existing words from Oxford English Dictionary and Oxford English Corpus, many new quotations from then-recent authors, and a complete review of spelling forms and defining vocabulary.

16,000 words lost their hyphen. Angus Stevenson, the editor of the Shorter OED, stated the reason: &quot;People are not confident about using hyphens anymore, they&#x27;re not really sure what they are for.&quot; Its researchers reviewed a corpus of 2 billion words (in newspapers, books, web sites and blogs from 2000). Bumble-bee is now bumblebee, ice-cream is ice cream and pot-belly is pot belly.

<text>Babai the Great ( , c. 551 – 628) was an early Assyrian church father of the Church of the East. He set several of the foundational pillars of the Church, revived the monastic movement, and formulated its Christology in a systematic way. He served as a monastic visitor and coadjutor with Mar Aba as unofficial heads of the Church of the East (formerly falsely referred to as &quot;Nestorian Church&quot;) after Catholicos Gregory until 628 AD, leaving a legacy of strong discipline and deep religious Orthodoxy. He is revered in the modern Assyrian Church of the East and Ancient Church of the East.

==Biography==
Babai the Great (not to be confused with Mar Babai I, the first autonomous leader of the Church of the East) was born in the Assyrian town of Beth Ainata in Beth Zabdai, on the west bank of the Tigris, near Nisibis. He was born to a family of humble means, and studied at the Christian School of Nisibis under the directorship of Abraham of Beth Rabban. Sometime around 571 A.D., when the Origenist Henana of Adiabene became the new headmaster, Babai&#x27;s teacher, Abraham the Great of Kashkar, founded a new monastery on Mt. Izla above Nisibis. Babai taught for a while at the Xenodocheio of Nisibis. After that he joined the newly founded monastery of Abraham on Mt. Izla. When Abraham died in 588, Babai left and founded a new monastery and school in his home country Beth Zabdai.
In 604 Babai became the third abbot of Abraham&#x27;s monastery on Mt. Izla.

Abraham the Great had started a monastic reform movement which Babai and other disciples carried through. Since Bar Sauma and the Synod of Beth Lapat, monks and nuns had been encouraged to marry. When Babai returned to Mt. Izla in 604, he expelled monks that lived with women on the fringes of the monastery, and enforced strict discipline, emphasizing a deep life of prayer and solitude. The result was a mass exodus, not only of the married monks.

But the Church of the East was with Babai. In 604, the Catholicos Mar Sabrisho I died and a new Catholicos had to be elected. The choice fell between two men named Gregory: Bishop Gregory of Nisibis and Professor Gregory of Seleucia. King Khosrau II, ruler of the Sassanid Empire, stated only that his preferred candidate was Gregory, possibly meaning the bishop. The king&#x27;s influential wife Shirin, however, disliked Gregory of Nisibis and preferred Gregory of Seleucia, who had once been her steward. The Synod (council) rejected the king&#x27;s initial candidate, taking advantage of the ambiguity of name, and chose Gregory of Seleucia. The king was accordingly displeased, and reluctantly supported the elected candidate (after applying a hefty fine to him), and said, &quot;Patriarch he is and patriarch he shall be – but never again do I allow another election.&quot;

When the Catholicos Gregorius died a few years later in 608, the Assyrian bishops made the usual request to the king to allow them to elect a new Catholicos, but Khosrau had not forgotten the events of the previous election and refused them permission to do so. The royal physician Gabriel of Shiggar, a staunch Miaphysite, suggested to make Henana of Adiabene or one of his students Catholicos, and also used his influence with the king to prevent an election.

From 610 to 628 the last and most devastating wars between Byzantium and Persia took place. First Persia conquered parts of Byzantium, which were populated mostly by Miaphysite and Chalcedonian Christians. To be popular in the newly gained provinces, King Khosrau II did not want to favor the Church of the East anymore. During the successful Byzantine counterattack 622–628, Chalcedonians and especially Miaphysites were on the advance in Persia, and several sees and villages were lost by the Church of the East. The king successfully blocked an election in the church, preventing the church from having any figure who could allow new bishops and metropolitans to be consecrated.

During the decades of this vacancy, the Church of the East required a sort of authority. Because the king remained staunch in his policy, the church chose to separate itself from the king&#x27;s royal proscription. Two &quot;vekils&quot; (regents) were selected as a stop-gap measure: Archdeacon Mar Aba, who handled matters in the South. In the North, Babai the Great was chosen to lead, who at the time was abbot of a monastery on Mt. Izla. He was nominated inspector-general or visitor of the monasteries of the three northern provinces by the Metropolitans of Nisibis, B. Garmai, and Adiabene. Therefore, Babai, even though not yet a bishop, acted as patriarch in all ecclesiastical matters, though he could not ordain or consecrate. He was appointed &#x27;visitor of the monasteries&#x27; of the North and administered the church in collaboration with Archdeacon Mar Aba. In particular, this new position allowed Babai to investigate the orthodoxy of the monasteries and monks of northern Mesopotamia, and to enforce discipline throughout the monasteries of northern Mesopotamia, even against occasional resistance.

Babai the Great and Mar Aba administered the Church of the East for 17 years. Attempts were made during that time to ask the king to change his mind and allow an election, but influences in the court, such as Gabriel of Shiggar, and the king&#x27;s wife Shirin, both miaphysite, blocked the requests. Gabriel was seeking to maneuver things such that the decision of Catholicos would have been in his own hands, an option completely unacceptable to the bishops.

The king defended this policy until his death in 628. The situation, and vacancy, endured until Khosrau II was murdered in 628. After this, Babai was promptly, and unanimously, elected Catholicos, but he declined. Soon afterward, he died in the cell of his monastery on Mt. Izla, being 75 or 77 years old.

==Babai&#x27;s teaching==
Besides bringing discipline to the monasteries and administering the church, Babai is mainly known for his orthodox teaching.

===Babai&#x27;s writing===
To defend and clarify the East Syriac tradition and theology against Henana&#x27;s Origenism and the advancing Monophysites, Babai the Great produced some 83 or 84 volumes of writing. He developed a systematic Christology, which is vital in the Assyrian Church of the East until today. Of his extensive exegetical works on all of Scripture nothing survived. What remains are two hagiographies (of Christina and George of Izla), his principal work on the foundations of ascetic life &#x27;On the Life of Excellency&#x27;, and commentaries on mystical themes.

From what has been preserved it appears that his main authority was Theodore of Mopsuestia, though in general he used few citations from the Fathers. There is no evidence that he could read Greek, and Babai must have relied on translations.

He mainly fought against the ideas of the Monophysites and of the Origenist Henana. They were the inner enemies. He also wrote against the doctrines of Mani, Gnostic doctrines of Marcion, of Bar Daisan, of the Messalians and the general loss of discipline in monasteries in Beth Lapat.

The &quot;Book of Union&quot; is Babai&#x27;s most systematic surviving Christological treatise, divided into seven memre that cover more than 200 folios. The &#x27;Tractatus Vaticanus&#x27; is another manuscript that deals with the, &quot;impossibility of the hypostatic union and natural union, the possibility of the parsopic union, and the significance of the expression &quot;hypostatic union&quot; among the fathers of the antiquity&quot;.

An important source on the position of Babai the Great against Origen and his follower Henana of Adiabene is his commentary on Evagrius Ponticus. It also shows his opposition to Messalianism. An 8th-century manuscript has been preserved that contains Evagrius&#x27; text together with Babai&#x27;s commentary on it. This commentary is an abridged version of a larger one which Babai had written earlier and which is lost.

The writings of Evagrius were important to the current mystical revival among Greek and Syrian monks. For the monks of Mt. Izla, Evagrius was the pillar of mystical theology. The Greek text was condemned already in 553 for its Origenist heresies.

But unlike the Greek, the &#x27;Common Syriac Version&#x27;, a translation of the Gnostic chapters of Evagrius by the Monophysite Philoxenus, was void of the specific Origenist-Evagrian Christology. For example, it omits the &#x27;nous-Christos&#x27; Christology where the God-logos and the flesh are united in the nous, Jesus Christ, the subject of incarnation. Babai tried to eliminate the Origenist ideas even further and presented Evagrius as opposed to Origen and his follower Henana by pointing out apparent contradictions between them.

&quot;The Devil is telling the people that some of Evagrius&#x27; statements are similar to heresies. Some even tried to translate directly from the Greek to show the heresy of Evagrius. They translated according to their foolishness, but can be refuted by other writings of Evagrius. The cursed Origen and his disciple, the fool Apollinaris, they teach completely different from Evagrius on the renewal of the soul after death&quot;.

To show this further, Babai tells the vita of Evagrius and enumerates his sources: Basilius, Gregorius, and Nectarius.

===Babai&#x27;s Christology===

The main theological authorities of Babai were Theodore of Mopsuestia and Diodorus of Tarsus. He also relied on John Chrysostomos, the Cappadocian fathers and on Ephrem the Syrian, which were also accepted in the West. In his exegetical methods he synthesized between the rational Theodore and mystical writers like Evagrius.

And most important, instead of breaking with Theodore because of some extreme interpretations of his teachings, like others did, Babai clarified his position to the point that differences with western Christology became superficial and mostly an issue of terminology. His Christology is far less dualistic than the one Nestorius seems to have presented.

Babai in the &#x27;Book of Union&#x27; teaches two &quot;qnome&quot; (&#x27;nature, essence&#x27;, the miaphysite West Syriac Church uses the word to mean &#x27;hypostasis&#x27;), which are unmingled but everlastingly united in one &quot;parsopa&quot; (from Greek &quot;prosopon&quot;, &#x27;person, character, identity&#x27;). It is essential to use the Syrian terms here and not any translations, because the same words mean different things to different people, and the words must be accepted in the particular sense of each. In Greek Christology, &quot;hypostasis&quot; is used specifically to refer to what would correspond to Babai&#x27;s &quot;parsopa&quot;, and &quot;ousion&quot; would correspond to &quot;qnome&quot;. In the period in which Babai and others formulated their respective Christological models, words such as &quot;hypostasis&quot; and &quot;ousion&quot; had less specifically fixed definitions. Thus, it was possible for two individuals to honestly use a single term to mean two distinctly different things. According to Jaroslav Pelikan, &quot;Syriac was a richer and more complex language than either Greek or Arabic, and it allowed for more precise distinction&quot;.

To Babai, Christ is both God and man. But he could not tolerate any form of Theopaschism (the belief that God suffered), be it the divinity itself, the Trinity, or one of the hypostases of the Trinity. According to Babai, Cyril of Alexandria stood at the root of simple Theopaschism as professed by the Miaphysites, and the Emperor Justinian I at the root of composite Theopaschism. The Church of the East could accept expressions like &#x27;Christ died&#x27;, &#x27;the Son died&#x27;, but not &#x27;the Word died&#x27;, even not &#x27;the Word died in the flesh&#x27;.

In the sixth century AD, Mar Babai wrote the Teshbokhta or (Hymn of Praise) explaining the theology of the Church of the East He writes:
:One is Christ the Son of God,
:Worshiped by all in two natures;
:In His Godhead begotten of the Father,
:Without beginning before all time;
:In His humanity born of Mary,
:In the fullness of time, in a body united;
:Neither His Godhead is of the nature of the mother,
:Nor His humanity of the nature of the Father;
:The natures are preserved in their Qnumas (substance),
:In one person of one Sonship.
:And as the Godhead is three substances in one nature,
:Likewise the Sonship of the Son is in two natures, one person.
:So the Holy Church has taught.

<text>Néo-trad is a musical style from Quebec that arose around the turn of the 21st century. It can be considered a subgenre of Québécois folk music. The term combines the Greek prefix &quot;neo&quot;, meaning &quot;new&quot;, and the contraction of the word &quot;traditionnelle&quot;, as in &quot;traditional music&quot;.

==History==
It basically constitutes modernized Quebec folklore music, usually with rock and/or electronica. Some notable néo-trad artists are Mes Aïeux, and Les Cowboys Fringants. Okoumé can also be considered a néo-trad .

The expression can also encompass all Trad groups, modern times bands playing Québécois folklore (in a traditional way) like La Bottine Souriante, Les Charbonniers de l&#x27;enfer, La Volée d&#x27;Castors and Les Batinses. Inversely, the term &quot;Trad&quot; can encompass &quot;néo-trad&quot; groups.

<text>Csík (Hungarian, in Romanian: &quot;Ciuc&quot;) was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. Its territory is now in central Romania (eastern Transylvania). The capital of the county was Csíkszereda (now Miercurea Ciuc).

==Geography==

Csík county shared borders with Kingdom of Romania and the Hungarian counties of Beszterce-Naszód, Maros-Torda, Udvarhely and Háromszék. The county was situated in the Carpathian Mountains, around the sources and upper courses of the rivers Olt and Mureș. Its area was 4,859 km2 around 1910.

==History==

Csík county consisted of three former seats of the Székelys: Csíkszék, Gyergyószék and Kászonszék (the latter two as filial seats of the former). It was formed in 1876, when the administrative structure of Transylvania was changed. In 1920, by the Treaty of Trianon, the county became part of Romania. It was returned to Hungary by the Second Vienna Award of 1940. After World War II, it became again part of Romania. Most of its territory lies in the present-day Romanian county of Harghita, with small parts in Suceava, Neamț and Bacău.

==Subdivisions==

In the early 20th century, the subdivisions of Csík county were:

<text>Pavel Vasilyevich Chichagov or Tchichagov (; ) was a Russian army and naval commander of the Napoleonic Wars.

==Biography==
He was born in 1767 in Saint Petersburg, the son of Admiral Vasily Chichagov and his English wife. At the age of 12 he was enlisted in the Guard. In 1782 he served in a campaign in the Mediterranean as an aide to his father. He served with distinction in the Russian-Swedish War of 1788–1790, where he commanded the &quot;Rostislav&quot; and was awarded the Order of St. George, fourth degree, and a golden sword with the inscription &quot;For Courage&quot;.

After the war, he studied at the Royal Naval Academy. While there, he met Elizabeth Proby, the daughter of a commissioner at the Chatham Dockyard, and became engaged to her. When he returned to Russia in 1796, he applied for permission to marry but was told by Paul I &quot;there are sufficient brides in Russia; there is no need to look for one in England.&quot; Some violence followed and Chichagov was sent to prison. He was soon pardoned, given permission to marry Elizabeth, and promoted to rear admiral. In 1802, Alexander I, Paul&#x27;s successor, promoted Chichagov to Vice Admiral and made him a member of the Committee on Navy Reorganization. In 1807, he was promoted to Admiral and appointed Minister of the Navy.

Chichagov resigned and traveled in Europe in 1809–1811. Elizabeth died in 1811. In 1812, Alexander recalled him and appointed him Commander in Chief of the newly formed Third Western Army and Governor-General of Moldavia and Wallachia. However, the 1812 Treaty of Bucharest ended the Russo-Turkish War by the time he took command of the Army of the Danube. During the 1812 campaign against Napoleon, he was blamed for letting Napoleon escape at the Berezina River in November 1812. In 1813, he was dismissed and the following year went to France on a furlough, never to return to Russia. He remained a member of the State Council until 1834 but was then removed from that position, and his properties confiscated. He died in Paris in 1849 where, after his death, his memoirs were published.

<text>Air Force Base Ysterplaat is an airbase of the South African Air Force. It is located in Cape Town suburb Ysterplaat, on the southwestern coast of South Africa.
The name &quot;Ysterplaat&quot; is Afrikaans from the Dutch &quot;Ijzerplaats&quot;, meaning &quot;Iron Place&quot; or &quot;Place of Iron&quot; in English.

The base&#x27;s motto is &quot;Fortiter In Re&quot; (Resolute in Action).

==Units hosted==

* 22 Squadron SAAF - Helicopter squadron
* 35 Squadron SAAF - Transport/Maritime patrol squadron
* 110 Squadron SAAF - Light transport (reserve)
* 505 Squadron - Security services
* 80 Air Navigation School SAAF
* 2 Air Support Unit detached - Maintenance support

==History==

The site of AFB Ysterplaat was originally used as a civilian airfield, known as Maitland Aerodrome, from as early as 1929. African Air Transport (AAT) opened at Maitland in 1938, and was involved in training pilots for the Union Air Training Group&#x27;s pupil pilot training scheme. 

With the coming of World War II the land the aerodrome sat on was donated to aid the war effort by Sir David Graaff, 1st Baronet on condition his estate would be consulted should it ever be used for non-military purposes. On 24 October 1941 Air Force Station Brooklyn, as it was then known, opened as a SAAF unit.

In 1946, the first jet aircraft to reach South Africa, a Gloster Meteor III, was assembled and flown at Brooklyn. On 1 April 1949, AFS Brooklyn was renamed AFS Ysterplaat. It lies now literally in the heart of Cape Town, South Africa&#x27;s legislative capital. More jets were assembled at Ysterplaat from 1950 in the form of the de Havilland Vampire FB Mk.5s, which were the SAAF&#x27;s first operational jet fighters. Unit status was upgraded to an Air Force Base (AFB) on 1 February 1968.

== Current use ==
Although the base has long been the centre of the SAAF&#x27;s maritime patrol activities along the Cape coast, due to increased budgetary restrictions, the base was scheduled to be downgraded to an Air Force Station (AFS Ysterplaat) on 1 April 2003, but as of August 2004, this has not yet happened. The SAAF is considering converting the base into a civilian airport with a military presence, but no decisions have been taken as of yet. However, AFB Ysterplaat restricted airspace helps trainees at local flight training schools based at Fisantekraal or Morningstar Airfield in honing their round-trip skills while flying en route the Cape Peninsula, thus creating strong bonds between the base and the diverse flying community of the Western Cape. The Young Falcons wings ceremony is held also at AFB Ysterplaat.

<doc id="932217" wikidata="Q4166515" url="?curid=932217" title="Classical unified field theories">
<text>Since the 19th century, some physicists, notably Albert Einstein, have attempted to develop a single theoretical framework that can account for all the fundamental forces of nature – a unified field theory. Classical unified field theories are attempts to create a unified field theory based on classical physics. In particular, unification of gravitation and electromagnetism was actively pursued by several physicists and mathematicians in the years between the two World Wars. This work spurred the purely mathematical development of differential geometry.

This article describes various attempts at formulating a classical (non-quantum), relativistic unified field theory. For a survey of classical relativistic field theories of gravitation that have been motivated by theoretical concerns other than unification, see Classical theories of gravitation. For a survey of current work toward creating a quantum theory of gravitation, see quantum gravity.

==Overview==

The early attempts at creating a unified field theory began with the Riemannian geometry of general relativity, and attempted to incorporate electromagnetic fields into a more general geometry, since ordinary Riemannian geometry seemed incapable of expressing the properties of the electromagnetic field. Einstein was not alone in his attempts to unify electromagnetism and gravity; a large number of mathematicians and physicists, including Hermann Weyl, Arthur Eddington, and Theodor Kaluza also attempted to develop approaches that could unify these interactions. These scientists pursued several avenues of generalization, including extending the foundations of geometry and adding an extra spatial dimension.

== Early work ==

The first attempts to provide a unified theory were by G. Mie in 1912 and Ernst Reichenbacher in 1916. However, these theories were unsatisfactory, as they did not incorporate general relativity because general relativity had yet to be formulated. These efforts, along with those of Rudolf Förster, involved making the metric tensor (which had previously been assumed to be symmetric and real-valued) into an asymmetric and/or complex-valued tensor, and they also attempted to create a field theory for matter as well.

== Differential geometry and field theory ==

From 1918 until 1923, there were three distinct approaches to field theory: the gauge theory of Weyl, Kaluza&#x27;s five-dimensional theory, and Eddington&#x27;s development of affine geometry. Einstein corresponded with these researchers, and collaborated with Kaluza, but was not yet fully involved in the unification effort.

==Weyl&#x27;s infinitesimal geometry ==

In order to include electromagnetism into the geometry of general relativity, Hermann Weyl worked to generalize the Riemannian geometry upon which general relativity is based. His idea was to create a more general infinitesimal geometry. He noted that in addition to a metric field there could be additional degrees of freedom along a path between two points in a manifold, and he tried to exploit this by introducing a basic method for comparison of local size measures along such a path, in terms of a gauge field. This geometry generalized Riemannian geometry in that there was a vector field &quot;Q&quot;, in addition to the metric &quot;g&quot;, which together gave rise to both the electromagnetic and gravitational fields. This theory was mathematically sound, albeit complicated, resulting in difficult and high-order field equations. The critical mathematical ingredients in this theory, the Lagrangians and curvature tensor, were worked out by Weyl and colleagues. Then Weyl carried out an extensive correspondence with Einstein and others as to its physical validity, and the theory was ultimately found to be physically unreasonable. However, Weyl&#x27;s principle of gauge invariance was later applied in a modified form to quantum field theory.

==Kaluza&#x27;s fifth dimension ==
Kaluza&#x27;s approach to unification was to embed space-time into a five-dimensional cylindrical world, consisting of four space dimensions and one time dimension. Unlike Weyl&#x27;s approach, Riemannian geometry was maintained, and the extra dimension allowed for the incorporation of the electromagnetic field vector into the geometry. Despite the relative mathematical elegance of this approach, in collaboration with Einstein and Einstein&#x27;s aide Grommer it was determined that this theory did not admit a non-singular, static, spherically symmetric solution. This theory did have some influence on Einstein&#x27;s later work and was further developed later by Klein in an attempt to incorporate relativity into quantum theory, in what is now known as Kaluza–Klein theory.

==Eddington&#x27;s affine geometry ==

Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington was a noted astronomer who became an enthusiastic and influential promoter of Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity. He was among the first to propose an extension of the gravitational theory based on the affine connection as the fundamental structure field rather than the metric tensor which was the original focus of general relativity. Affine connection is the basis for &quot;parallel transport&quot; of vectors from one space-time point to another; Eddington assumed the affine connection to be symmetric in its covariant indices, because it seemed plausible that the result of parallel-transporting one infinitesimal vector along another should produce the same result as transporting the second along the first. (Later workers revisited this assumption.)

Eddington emphasized what he considered to be epistemological considerations; for example, he thought that the cosmological constant version of the general-relativistic field equation expressed the property that the universe was &quot;self-gauging&quot;. Since the simplest cosmological model (the De Sitter universe) that solves that equation is a spherically symmetric, stationary, closed universe (exhibiting a cosmological red shift, which is more conventionally interpreted as due to expansion), it seemed to explain the overall form of the universe.

Like many other classical unified field theorists, Eddington considered that in the Einstein field equations for general relativity the stress–energy tensor formula_1, which represents matter/energy, was merely provisional, and that in a truly unified theory the source term would automatically arise as some aspect of the free-space field equations. He also shared the hope that an improved fundamental theory would explain why the two elementary particles then known (proton and electron) have quite different masses.

The Dirac equation for the relativistic quantum electron caused Eddington to rethink his previous conviction that fundamental physical theory had to be based on tensors. He subsequently devoted his efforts into development of a &quot;Fundamental Theory&quot; based largely on algebraic notions (which he called &quot;E-frames&quot;). Unfortunately his descriptions of this theory were sketchy and difficult to understand, so very few physicists followed up on his work.

==Einstein&#x27;s geometric approaches ==

When the equivalent of Maxwell&#x27;s equations for electromagnetism is formulated within the framework of Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity, the electromagnetic field energy (being equivalent to mass as defined by Einstein&#x27;s equation E=mc2) contributes to the stress tensor and thus to the curvature of space-time, which is the general-relativistic representation of the gravitational field; or putting it another way, certain configurations of curved space-time &quot;incorporate&quot; effects of an electromagnetic field. This suggests that a purely geometric theory ought to treat these two fields as different aspects of the same basic phenomenon. However, ordinary Riemannian geometry is unable to describe the properties of the electromagnetic field as a purely geometric phenomenon.

Einstein tried to form a generalized theory of gravitation that would unify the gravitational and electromagnetic forces (and perhaps others), guided by a belief in a single origin for the entire set of physical laws. These attempts initially concentrated on additional geometric notions such as vierbeins and &quot;distant parallelism&quot;, but eventually centered around treating both the metric tensor and the affine connection as fundamental fields. (Because they are not independent, the metric-affine theory was somewhat complicated.) In general relativity, these fields are symmetric (in the matrix sense), but since antisymmetry seemed essential for electromagnetism, the symmetry requirement was relaxed for one or both fields. Einstein&#x27;s proposed unified-field equations (fundamental laws of physics) were generally derived from a variational principle expressed in terms of the Riemann curvature tensor for the presumed space-time manifold.

In field theories of this kind, particles appear as limited regions in space-time in which the field strength or the energy density is particularly high. Einstein and coworker Leopold Infeld managed to demonstrate that, in Einstein&#x27;s final theory of the unified field, true singularities of the field did have trajectories resembling point particles. However, singularities are places where the equations break down, and Einstein believed that in an ultimate theory the laws should apply &quot;everywhere&quot;, with particles being soliton-like solutions to the (highly nonlinear) field equations. Further, the large-scale topology of the universe should impose restrictions on the solutions, such as quantization or discrete symmetries.

The degree of abstraction, combined with a relative lack of good mathematical tools for analyzing nonlinear equation systems, make it hard to connect such theories with the physical phenomena that they might describe. For example, it has been suggested that the torsion (antisymmetric part of the affine connection) might be related to isospin rather than electromagnetism; this is related to a discrete (or &quot;internal&quot;) symmetry known to Einstein as &quot;displacement field duality&quot;.

Einstein became increasingly isolated in his research on a generalized theory of gravitation, and most physicists consider his attempts ultimately unsuccessful. In particular, his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces ignored developments in quantum physics (and vice versa), most notably the discovery of the strong nuclear force and weak nuclear force.

==Schrödinger&#x27;s pure-affine theory ==

Inspired by Einstein&#x27;s approach to a unified field theory and Eddington&#x27;s idea of the affine connection as the sole basis for differential geometric structure for space-time, Erwin Schrödinger from 1940 to 1951 thoroughly investigated pure-affine formulations of generalized gravitational theory. Although he initially assumed a symmetric affine connection, like Einstein he later considered the nonsymmetric field.

Schrödinger&#x27;s most striking discovery during this work was that the metric tensor was &quot;induced&quot; upon the manifold via a simple construction from the Riemann curvature tensor, which was in turn formed entirely from the affine connection. Further, taking this approach with the simplest feasible basis for the variational principle resulted in a field equation having the form of Einstein&#x27;s general-relativistic field equation with a cosmological term arising &quot;automatically&quot;.

Skepticism from Einstein and published criticisms from other physicists discouraged Schrödinger, and his work in this area has been largely ignored.

==Later work ==

After the 1930s, progressively fewer scientists worked on classical unification, due to the continued development of quantum-theoretical descriptions of the non-gravitational fundamental forces of nature and the difficulties encountered in developing a quantum theory of gravity. Einstein pressed on with his attempts to theoretically unify gravity and electromagnetism, but he became increasingly isolated in this research, which he pursued until his death. Einstein&#x27;s celebrity status brought much attention to his final quest, which ultimately saw limited success.

Most physicists, on the other hand, eventually abandoned classical unified theories. Current mainstream research on unified field theories focuses on the problem of creating a quantum theory of gravity and unifying with the other fundamental theories in physics, all of which are quantum field theories. (Some programs, such as string theory, attempt to solve both of these problems at once.) Of the four known fundamental forces, gravity remains the one force for which unification with the others proves problematic.

Although new &quot;classical&quot; unified field theories continue to be proposed from time to time, often involving non-traditional elements such as spinors or relating gravitation to an electromagnetic force, none have been generally accepted by physicists yet.

<text>Phillips International Records is a sub-label of Sun Records started by Sam Phillips in October 1957.

The design had the whole label as a blue and white Earth-globe with &quot;Phillips&quot; prominent between the words &quot;Sam C.&quot; and &quot;International Corp&quot; on a red, white, and blue ribbon to the left and below.

Based in Memphis, the label was home to the million-selling &quot;Raunchy&quot; by Bill Justis, who later became a major player in arranging and conducting. Carl Mann had hits with &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; and &quot;Pretend&quot; in 1959, and Charlie Rich recorded &quot;Lonely Weekends&quot; for the label in 1960. Phillips International Records was dissolved in 1963 after Philips Records complained about the similar name.

<doc id="932229" wikidata="Q2987193" url="?curid=932229" title="Theopaschism">
<text>Theopaschism is the belief that a god can suffer. Owing to controversies about the passion of Jesus and his divinity, this doctrine was a subject of ecumenical councils which affirmed the theopaschite formula.

== Christology ==
In Christian theology this involves questions such as &quot;was the crucifixion of Jesus a crucifixion of God?&quot; The question is central to the schism between those churches which accepted the First Council of Ephesus and the Assyrian Church of the East. While not Nestorian, the Assyrian Church of the East, along with their greatest teacher, Babai the Great, deny the possibility of a suffering God.

Modern scholars, such as Paul Gavrilyuk, have argued that one of the central debates of the 5th century was how Christ suffered on the cross. It seemed that Cyril of Alexandria favoured a grammatical sense of theopaschism, meaning he was able to write statements such as &#x27;God died&#x27; or &#x27;God was crucified&#x27; in a qualified sense. This scandalised Nestorius who wanted a firm separation of the natures of Christ, and would much rather have said that Jesus Christ the man suffered.

== Modern philosophy ==
A number of modern philosophers and theologians have been called theopaschists, such as G. W. F. Hegel, Friedrich Nietzsche and Simone Weil. Kazoh Kitamori&#x27;s &quot;Theology of the Pain of God&quot; (1946) and Moltmann&#x27;s &quot;The Crucified God&quot; (1971) are two 1900s books that have taken up the ancient theological idea that at least &quot;one of the Trinity has suffered&quot; (). In the words of Hans Urs von Balthasar:

<text>White City Stadium in London, England, was built for the 1908 Summer Olympics. It hosted the finish of the first modern marathon and swimming, speedway, boxing, show jumping, athletics, stock car racing, concerts and a match at the 1966 World Cup.

From 1927, it was a venue for greyhound racing, hosting the English Greyhound Derby until its closure in 1984. The stadium was demolished in 1985 and the site is now occupied by White City Place.

White City was also used for stock car racing in the early seventies when Spedeworth promoted racing on Friday nights usually alternate Fridays to their Walthamstow promotions

==History==

Designed by the engineer J. J. Webster and completed in 10 months by George Wimpey, on part of the site of the Franco-British Exhibition, this stadium with a seating capacity of 68,000 was opened by King Edward VII on 27 April 1908 after the first stanchion had been placed in position by Ettie Grenfell, Baroness Desborough on 2 August 1907. The cost of construction was £60,000. Upon completion, the stadium had a running track and three laps to the mile (536 m); outside there was a , cycle track. The infield included a swimming and diving pool.

Many events of the 1908 Olympics were at the stadium itself whereas nowadays there are many arenas. The Olympic rugby union final between Australia and Great Britain was held in the stadium on 26 October 1908 and events such as archery and gymnastics took place at White City, while some others took place at Queens Club. Swimming was held at White City, in a 100 metres long pool dug in the infield.
The position of the finish line for the marathon in the 1908 Summer Olympics is commemorated by a marker in the plaza that now stands there. The distance of the modern marathon was fixed at these Games and calculated from the start of the race at Windsor Castle to a point in front of the royal box. The medal table for the 1908 Summer Olympics is also listed on a nearby wall.

The original running track continued in use until 1914. There were attempts to sell the stadium in 1922, but several athletes in the team for the 1924 Summer Olympics used it for training.

In 1926, the GRA (Greyhound Racing Association) took over the stadium and in 1927, the track was grassed over for greyhound racing. Speedway arrived the following year in 1928. The GRA built new covered terracing and a restaurant. From 1927 until its closure, it hosted weekly greyhound meetings and was considered the top greyhound track in Britain. It hosted the sport&#x27;s premier event, the English Greyhound Derby, until 1984. Just before and after the Second World War, attendances were huge, a record 92,000 spectators attended the 1939 Derby final.

In 1931, a 440yd running track was installed for the Amateur Athletic Association Championships, held there from 1932 to 1970. Besides the AAA championships, major athletics events, including international matches, were held at the stadium. In 1954, in a match against Russia Christopher Chataway broke the world 5000m record running against Vladimir Kuts. The one mile world record was broken there by Derek Ibbotson in 1957. In 1934, the second British Empire Games and the fourth Women&#x27;s World Games were held at the venue.

Also in 1931, Queens Park Rangers F.C. began the first of two spells playing at the stadium, until 1933 (the second spell was from 1962 to 1963). QPR eventually decided against a permanent move to White City and stayed at Loftus Road.

Between 1932 and 1958, the stadium hosted major British boxing events, with attendances peaking as high as 90,000 for the second meeting between Len Harvey and Jack Petersen in 1934. The first major fight at the stadium was Len Harvey&#x27;s unsuccessful challenge for the NBA Middleweight Championship versus Marcel Thil of France. Future heavyweight champion Primo Carnera suffered his only defeat on British soil when he lost to Canadian Larry Gains in May 1932. Other important fighters to appear at White City include Jock McAvoy, Don Cockell, Nino Valdez, Henry Cooper and Terry Downes.

In 1933, Wigan Highfield, a rugby league side, nearly became bankrupt. White City Company, owners of the stadium, decided to move the club to White City. Previously, only rugby union had been popular in southern England, professional rugby league being the preserve of northern towns and cities. Wigan Highfield became London Highfield with their debts paid. Their first try was scored by George &quot;Porky&quot; Davies, who went on to play for Liverpool Stanley and then St. Helens from 1938 to 1947. The White City Company lost money on the venture and decided not to continue with rugby league. London Highfield was the precursor to London Broncos, the leading rugby league club in London.

In 1966, Wembley&#x27;s owner&#x27;s refusal to cancel regular greyhound racing meant the match between Uruguay and France in the 1966 FIFA World Cup was played at White City. The game attracted 45,662 fans.

The stadium was demolished in 1985 and the site is now occupied by White City Place (formerly BBC White City).

==Greyhound racing==
White City Stadium was principally used for greyhound racing for the majority of its existence. The first greyhound meeting took place on 20 June 1927.
The stadium became the Mecca of greyhound racing with tens of thousands of spectators attending meetings on a regular basis, particularly in the 1940s, and 1950s. A crowd of 92,000 attended the 1939 English Greyhound Derby final.

The track was renowned for holding some of the sport&#x27;s top events in addition to the English Greyhound Derby. They included the Grand National, the Oaks, the Wood Lane Stakes, the Longcross Cup and The Cambridgeshire. The final Greyhound Derby was held on 23 June 1984.

==Speedway==

The speedway track at White City was in length.

The White City stadium first held open speedway meetings in 1928 before the start of the Southern League in 1929. A team from the stadium known as White City (London) entered the 1929 Southern League where they finished in 7th place out of 11 teams (after Birmingham (Hall Green) resigned for the league after racing 7 league matches). The White City team were due to race in the 1930 Southern League, but they withdrew from the league before it started. The stadium then ran once again using an Open Licence and held occasional one-off meetings between (1953–1958, 1961) until a new league team was formed, from the Oxford &#x27;Rebels&#x27; in 1976.

From 1976 until 1978, the stadium was home to White City Rebels speedway team. The team closed after only three seasons due to poor crowds levels, despite finishing the 1977 season as champions of the British League. The Rebels&#x27; most notable rider was England International Gordon Kennett. Other notable riders were Steve Weatherley, Trevor Geer, Poland&#x27;s Marek Cieślak and multiple Finnish champion Kai Niemi and Colin Watson (pre war).

From 1979 to 1983 the stadium once again raced using an Open Licence hosting a number of high-profile Speedway World Championship qualifying rounds, including the Overseas and Intercontinental Finals during the 1970s, and 1980s. It also hosted the Final of the Speedway World Team Cup in 1976, 1979 and 1982.

Following the end of speedway at the Wembley Stadium after the 1981 World Final, White City became the home of international speedway in Great Britain until it was closed in 1984. Following this international speedway moved out of London and north to Odsal Stadium in Bradford.

==Appearances in the media==

The White City Stadium features in the climax to the 1950 film &quot;The Blue Lamp&quot;. It also appears in an episode of 1960s television spy series &quot;Man in a Suitcase&quot; (&quot;Man From the Dead&quot;), and was used in the 1973 film &quot;Steptoe and Son Ride Again&quot;. Some sections of the video for The Human League single &quot;Life On Your Own&quot; were shot in the stadium in 1984, just a few months before its demolition.

The stadium is shown in the 1956 comedy centred on greyhound racing &quot;Jumping for Joy&quot;. It was also shown in the 1960 episode of 77 Sunset Strip, &quot;The Double Death of Benny Markham&quot;.

The stadium was the location of a public outburst by Ray Davies of The Kinks during a July 1973 performance. Davies swore onstage, and at the show&#x27;s conclusion, as pretaped music played on the sound system, declared his retirement from the group. He subsequently collapsed after a drug overdose and was rushed to hospital. He would eventually recover and return to recording with The Kinks.

At a David Cassidy show on 26 May 1974, 800 people were injured in a crush at the front of the stage. Thirty were taken to hospital, and one, 14-year-old Bernadette Whelan, died on 30 May from injuries.

The Pogues made a song about the stadium and its demolition, called &quot;White City&quot;. It can be found on their 1989 album &quot;Peace and Love&quot;.

<text>John Herapath (30 May 1790 – 24 February 1868) was an English physicist who gave a partial account of the kinetic theory of gases in 1820 though it was neglected by the scientific community at the time. He was the cousin of William Herapath, the chemist and William Bird Herapath, the physician who discovered herapathite. In 1847 he published an early textbook on mathematical physics.

==Kinetic theory==
Herapath&#x27;s scientific interests started with an attempt to provide a mechanistic explanation for gravity. Motivated by his search for a mechanical explanation of gravitation, he started to consider how a system of colliding particles could give rise to &quot;action at a distance&quot;. In considering the effect of the high temperatures near the Sun on his &quot;gravific particles&quot; he was led to a relationship between temperature and particle velocity.

Herapath postulated that the momentum of a particle in a gas is a measure of the absolute temperature of the gas. He used momentum, rather than the kinetic energy on which the later established theory is based, as it seemed to him to avoid some difficulties around whether elastic collisions were possible between indivisible atoms. Apparently ignorant of Daniel Bernoulli&#x27;s work, he was led to the incorrect, but suggestive, relationship that expresses the product of pressure &quot;P&quot; and volume &quot;V&quot; as proportional to the square of his &quot;true temperature&quot;. The correct relationship is proportional to the absolute temperature, not its square, the error arising from his identification of momentum, rather than energy, with temperature.
* 

He submitted his ideas in a paper to the Royal Society in 1820 where it was peer reviewed by Sir Humphry Davy. Davy had already sympathised with the view that heat was associated with molecular motion rather than with Joseph Black&#x27;s caloric theory of heat but he rejected Herapath&#x27;s paper with some coolness, uncomfortable with the implication that there was an absolute zero of temperature at which all motion ceased. Davy may also have had some distaste for the mechanistic Newtonian picture, influenced as he was by the more holistic philosophy of the Romantic movement.

James Prescott Joule presented a short account of the work in 1848. Meanwhile, Herapath maintained a campaign against Davy and the Royal Society in the correspondence pages of &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper.

==Great Comet of 1831==

On 7 January 1831 Herapath was on Hounslow Heath when he sighted a comet. Due to its brilliance, it is one of the great comets. The comet was also observed by Thomas Glanville Taylor at the Madras Observatory.

==&quot;Railway Journal&quot;==
In 1835 Herapath became editor of &quot;The Railway Magazine&quot;, which underwent four changes of name during the boom years of railways to become Herapath&#x27;s &quot;Railway Journal&quot; in January 1894. It is now published as &quot;Railway Gazette International&quot;, and is not to be confused with &quot;The Railway Magazine&quot; which commenced publication in 1897. This gave him some limited opportunity to publish his scientific ideas. In 1836, he published a calculation of the mean molecular speed in a gas based on his kinetic theory and hence the speed of sound. Joule reproduced his results but is usually incorrectly credited as the originator.

The name changes were –
*&quot;Railway magazine&quot; May 1835-Feb. 1836
*&quot;Railway magazine and annals of science&quot; Mar. 1836 – Aug. 1839
*&quot;Railway magazine and steam navigation journal&quot; Mar. – Aug. 1839
*&quot;Railway magazine and commercial journal&quot; 17 Aug. 1839 – Dec. 1840
*&quot;Herapath&#x27;s railway magazine, commercial journal, and scientific review&quot; Jan. 1841 – Dec. 1842
*&quot;Herapath&#x27;s railway and commercial journal&quot; Jan. 1843 – Dec. 1845

The editions from 1839 to 1895 can be viewed in the National Archives and several issues are also available as e-books, e.g. 1837, 1836–1839 and several in Google books.

==Later work==
He revised his theories in the 1840s, largely based on the experimental work of Thomas Graham and Henri Victor Regnault.

Herapath died at Catford Bridge, Lewisham on 24 February 1868 and was buried at West Norwood Cemetery.

<text>The &#x27; (; ), or &#x27;, is an art exhibition held annually in Paris. Since 2011, it is held on the Champs-Élysées, between the and the , in mid-October. The first was created in 1903 by Frantz Jourdain, with Hector Guimard, George Desvallières, Eugène Carrière, Félix Vallotton, Édouard Vuillard, Eugène Chigot and Maison Jansen.

Perceived as a reaction against the conservative policies of the official Paris Salon, this massive exhibition almost immediately became the showpiece of developments and innovations in 20th-century painting, drawing, sculpture, engraving, architecture and decorative arts. During the Salon&#x27;s early years, established artists such as Pierre-Auguste Renoir threw their support behind the new exhibition and even Auguste Rodin displayed several works. Since its inception, works by artists such as Paul Cézanne, Henri Matisse, Paul Gauguin, Georges Rouault, André Derain, Albert Marquet, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes and Marcel Duchamp have been shown. In addition to the 1903 inaugural exhibition, three other dates remain historically significant for the : 1905 bore witness to the birth of Fauvism; 1910 witnessed the launch of Cubism; and 1912 resulted in a xenophobic and anti-modernist quarrel in the National Assembly (France).

==History==

The aim of the salon was to encourage the development of the fine arts, to serve as an outlet for young artists (of all nationalities), and a platform to broaden the dissemination of Impressionism and its extensions to a popular audience. Choosing the autumn season for the exhibition was strategic in several ways: it not only allowed artists to exhibit canvases painted outside (en plein air) during the summer, it stood out from the other two large salons (the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts and Salon des artistes français) which took place in the spring. The is distinguished by its multidisciplinary approach, open to paintings, sculptures, photographs (from 1904), drawings, engravings, applied arts, and the clarity of its layout, more or less per school. Foreign artists are particularly well represented. The also boasts the presence of a politician and patron of the arts, Olivier Sainsère as a member of the honorary committee.

For Frantz Jourdain, public exhibitions served an important social function by providing a forum for unknown, innovative, emerging (&quot;éminents&quot;) artists, and for providing a basis for the general public&#x27;s understanding of the new art. This was the idea behind Jourdain&#x27;s dream of opening a new &quot;Salon des Refusés&quot; in the late 1890s, and realized in the opening the in 1903. Providing a venue where unknown artists could be recognized, while &#x27;wrestling&#x27; the public out of its complacency were, to Jourdain, the greatest contributions to society the critic could make.

The platform of the was based on an open admission, welcoming artists in all areas of the arts. Jurors were members of society itself, not members of the Academy, the state, or official art establishments.

Refused exhibition space in the , the first was held in the poorly lit, humid basement of the Petit Palais. It was backed financially by Jansen. While Rodin applauded the endeavor, and submitted drawings, he refused to join doubting it would succeed.
Notwithstanding, the first , which included works by Matisse, Bonnard and other progressive artists, was unexpectedly successful, and was met with wide critical acclaim. Jourdain, familiar with the multifaceted world of art, predicted accurately the triumph would arouse animosity: from artist who resented the accent on Gauguin and Cézanne (both perceived as retrogressive), from academics who resisted attention given to the decorative arts, and soon, from the Cubists, who suspected the jurors favoring of Fauvism at their expense. Even Paul Signac, president of the Salon des Indépendants, never forgave Jourdain for having founded a rival salon.

What he had not predicted was a retaliation that threatened the future of the new salon. Carolus-Duran (president of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts) threatened to ban from his Société established artists who might consider exhibiting at the . Retaliating in defense of Jourdain, Eugène Carrière (a respected artistic figure) issued a statement that if forced to choose, he would join the and resign from the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts. The valuable publicity generated by the press articles on the controversy worked in favor of the . Thus, Eugène Carrière saved the burgeoning salon.

Henri Marcel, sympathetic to the , became director of the Beaux-Arts, and assured it would take place at the prestigious Grand Palais the following year.

The success of the was not, however, due to such controversy. Success was due to the tremendous impact of its exhibitions on both the art world and the general public, extending from 1903 to the outset of the First World War. Each successive exhibition denoted a significant phase in the development of modern art: Beginning with retrospectives of Gauguin, Cézanne and others; the influence such would have on the art that would follow; the Fauves (André Derain, Henri Matisse); followed by the proto-Cubists (Georges Braque, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Henri Le Fauconnier, Fernand Léger and Robert Delaunay); the Cubists, the Orphists, and Futurists.

In his defense of artistic liberty, Jourdain attacked not individuals, but institutions, such as the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, the Société des Artistes Français, and the (Paris), recognized as the foremost school of art.

In addition to his role as an influential art critic prior to the creation of the , Jourdain was a member of the Decorative Arts jury at the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair (1893), the Brussels International (1897) and the Paris Exposition Universelle (1900). Jourdain clearly outlined the dangers of following the academic path in his review of the 1889 Exposition, while pointing out the potentials in the art of engineers, aesthetics, the fusion with decorative arts and the need for social reform. He soon became well known as a staunch critic of traditionalism and a fervent proponent of Modernism, yet even for him, the Cubists had gone too far.

==1903, the outset==

The first Salon d&#x27;Autumne exhibition opened 31 October 1903 at the Palais des Beaux-Arts de la Ville de Paris (Petit Palais des Champs-Élysées) in Paris. Included in the show were the works of Pierre Bonnard, &quot;Coup de vent&quot;, &quot;Le magasin de nouveautés&quot;, &quot;Étude de jeune femme&quot; (no. 62, 63 and 64); Albert Gleizes, &quot;A l&#x27;ombre (l&#x27;Ile fleurie)&quot;, &quot;Le soir aux environs de Paris&quot; (no. 252, 253); Henri Matisse, &quot;Dévideuse picarde (intérieur)&quot;, &quot;Tulipes&quot; (386, 387), along with paintings by Francis Picabia, Jacques Villon, Édouard Vuillard, Félix Vallotton, Maxime Maufra, Henri Manguin, Armand Guillaumin, Henri Lebasque, Gustave Loiseau, Albert Marquet, Eugene Chigot with an homage to Paul Gauguin who died May 8, 1903.

==1904==

At the 1904 Salon d&#x27;Automne, held at the 15 October to 15 November, Jean Metzinger, exhibited three paintings entitled &quot;Marine (Le Croisic), Marine (Arromanches), Marine (Houlgate)&quot; (no. 907-909); Robert Delaunay, 19 years of age, exhibited his &quot;Panneau décoratif (l&#x27;été)&quot; (no. 352 of the catalogue). Albert Gleizes exhibited two paintings, &quot;Vieux moulin à Montons-Villiers (Picardie 1902)&quot; and &quot;Le matin à Courbevoie (1904)&quot;, (no. 536, 537). Henri Matisse presented fourteen works (607-620).

Kees van Dongen presented two works, Jacques Villon, three paintings, Francis Picabia three, Othon Friesz four, Albert Marquet seven, Jean Puy five, Georges Rouault eight paintings, Maufra ten, Manguin five, Vallotton three, and Valtat three.

A room at the 1904 Salon d&#x27;Automne was dedicated to Paul Cézanne, with thirty-one works, including various portraits, self-portraits, still lifes, flowers, landscapes and bathers (many from the collection of Ambroise Vollard, including photographs taken by the artist, exhibited in the photography section).

Another room presented works of Puvis de Chavannes, with 44 works. And another was dedicated to Odilon Redon with 64 works, including paintings, drawings and lithographs. Auguste Renoir and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec too were represented in separate rooms with 35 and 28 works respectively.

==1905, Fauvism==

After viewing the boldly colored canvases of Henri Matisse, André Derain, Albert Marquet, Maurice de Vlaminck, Kees van Dongen, Charles Camoin, and Jean Puy at the Salon d&#x27;Automne of 1905, the critic Louis Vauxcelles disparaged the painters as &quot;fauves&quot; (wild beasts), thus giving their movement the name by which it became known, Fauvism.

Vauxcelles described their work with the phrase &quot;Donatello chez les fauves&quot; (&quot;Donatello among the wild beasts&quot;), contrasting the &quot;orgy of pure tones&quot; with a Renaissance-style sculpture that shared the room with them. Henri Rousseau was not a Fauve, but his large jungle scene &quot;The Hungry Lion Throws Itself on the Antelope&quot; was exhibited near Matisse&#x27;s work and may have had an influence on the pejorative used. Vauxcelles&#x27; comment was printed on 17 October 1905 in &quot;Gil Blas&quot;, a daily newspaper, and passed into popular usage. The pictures gained considerable condemnation—&quot;A pot of paint has been flung in the face of the public&quot;, wrote the critic Camille Mauclair (1872–1945)—but also some favorable attention. One of the paintings singled out for attack was Matisse&#x27;s &quot;Woman with a Hat&quot;. This work&#x27;s purchase by Gertrude and Leo Stein had a very positive effect on Matisse, who had been demoralized from the bad reception of his work. Matisse&#x27;s Neo-Impressionist landscape, &quot;Luxe, Calme et Volupté&quot;, had already been exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants in the spring of 1905.

Two large retrospectives occupied adjacent rooms at the 1905 Salon d&#x27;Automne: one of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and the other Édouard Manet.

Despite the reputation for the contrary, the Salon d&#x27;Automne in 1905 was rather well received by the press, including critical praise for the Ingres and Manet retrospectives. The artists exhibiting were for the most part known, even the most innovative who a few months before exhibited at the Berthe Weill Gallery. However, a few critics reacted violently, both in the daily press aimed at a wide audience; and in the specialized press, some of whom were active advocates of symbolism, and vehemently detested the rise of the new generation.

==1906==

The exhibition of 1906 was held from 6 October to 15 November. Jean Metzinger exhibited his Fauvist/Divisionist &quot;Portrait of M. Robert Delaunay&quot; (no. 1191) and Robert Delaunay exhibited his painting &quot;L&#x27;homme à la tulipe (Portrait of M. Jean Metzinger)&quot; (no. 420 of the catalogue). Matisse exhibited his &quot;Liseuse&quot;, two still lifes (&quot;Tapis rouge&quot; and &quot;à la statuette&quot;), flowers and a landscape (no. 1171-1175) Robert Antoine Pinchon showed his &quot;Prairies inondées (Saint-Étienne-du-Rouvray, près de Rouen)&quot; (no. 1367), now at the Musée de Louviers. Pinchon&#x27;s paintings of this period are closely related to the Post-Impressionist and Fauvist styles, with golden yellows, incandescent blues, a thick impasto and larger brushstrokes.

At the same exhibition Paul Cézanne was represented by ten works. He wouldn&#x27;t live long enough to see the end of the show. Cézanne died 22 October 1906 (aged 67). His works included &quot;Maison dans les arbres&quot; (no. 323), &quot;Portrait de Femme&quot; (no. 235) and &quot;Le Chemin tournant&quot; (no. 326). Constantin Brâncuși entered three plaster busts: &quot;Portrait de M. S. Lupesco&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Enfant&quot; and &quot;Orgueil&quot; (no. 218 - 220). Raymond Duchamp-Villon exhibited &quot;Dans le Silence&quot; (bronze) and a plaster bust, &quot;Œsope&quot; (no. 498 and 499). His brother Jacques Villon exhibited six works. Kees van Dongen showed three works, &quot;Montmartre&quot; (492), &quot;Mademoiselle Léda&quot; (493) and &quot;Parisienne&quot; (494). André Derain exhibited &quot;Westminster-Londres&quot; (438), &quot;Arbres dans un chemin creux&quot; (444) and several other works painted at l&#x27;Estaque.

Retrospective exhibitions at the 1906 Salon d&#x27;Automne included Gustave Courbet, Eugène Carrière (49 works) and Paul Gauguin (227 works).

==1907–1909==
At the exhibition of 1907, held from 1 to 22 October, hung a painting by Georges Braque entitled &quot;Rochers rouges&quot; (no. 195 of the catalogue). Though this painting remains difficult to identify, it may be &quot;La Ciotat&quot; (&quot;The Cove&quot;). Jean Metzinger exhibited two landscapes (no. 1270 and 1271), also difficult to identify.

At this 1907 salon the drawings of Auguste Rodin were featured. There were also retrospectives of the works of Berthe Morisot (174 works) and Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux (149 works), and a Paul Cézanne retrospective exhibition which included 56 works as a tribute to the painter who died in 1906. Apollinaire referred to Matisse as the &quot;fauve of fauves&quot;. Works by both Derain and Matisse are criticized for the ugliness of their models. Braque and Le Fauconnier are considered as Fauves by the critic Michel Puy (brother of Jean Puy). Robert Delaunay showed one work, Bela Czobel showed one work André Lhote showed three, Patrick Henry Bruce three, Jean Crotti one, Fernand Léger five, Duchamp-Villon two, Raoul Dufy three, André Derain exhibited three paintings and Matisse seven works.

For the exhibition of 1908 at the Grand Palais des Champs-Élysées Matisse exhibited 30 works.

At the 1909 exhibition (1 October through 8 November), Henri le Fauconnier exhibited a proto-Cubist portrait of the French writer, novelist and poet Pierre Jean Jouve, drawing the attention of Albert Gleizes who had been working in a similar geometric style. Constantin Brâncuși exhibited alongside Metzinger, Le Fauconnier and Fernand Léger.

==1910, the launch of Cubism==

At the exhibition of 1910, held from 1 October to 8 November at the Grand Palais des Champs-Élysées, Paris, Jean Metzinger introduced an extreme form of what would soon be labeled &#x27;Cubism&#x27;, not just to the general public for the first time, but to other artists that had no contact with Picasso or Braque. Though others were already working in a proto-Cubist vein with complex Cézannian geometries and unconventional perspectives, Metzinger&#x27;s &quot;Nu à la cheminée (Nude)&quot; represented a radical departure further still.

I have in front of me a small cutting from an evening newspaper, &quot;The Press&quot;, on the subject of the 1910 Salon d&#x27;Automne. It gives a good idea of the situation in which the new pictorial tendency, still barely perceptible, found itself: &quot;The geometrical fallacies of Messrs. Metzinger, Le Fauconnier, and Gleizes&quot;. No sign of any compromise there. Braque and Picasso only showed in Kahnweiler&#x27;s gallery and we were unaware of them. Robert Delaunay, Metzinger and Le Fauconnier had been noticed at the Salon des Indépendants of that same year, 1910, without a label being fixed on them. Consequently, although much effort has been put into proving the opposite, the word &quot;Cubism&quot; was not at that time current. (Albert Gleizes, 1925)

In a review of the Salon, the poet Roger Allard (1885-1961) announces the appearance of a new school of French painters concentrating their attention on form rather than on color. A group forms that includes Gleizes, Metzinger, Delaunay (a friend and associate of Metzinger), and Fernand Léger. They meet regularly at Henri le Fauconnier&#x27;s studio near the Bld de Montparnasse, where he is working on his ambitious allegorical painting entitled &quot;L&#x27;Abondance&quot;. &quot;In this painting&quot; writes Brooke, &quot;the simplification of the representational form gives way to a new complexity in which foreground and background are united and the subject of the painting obscured by a network of interlocking geometrical elements&quot;.

This exhibition preceded the 1911 Salon des Indépendants which officially introduced &quot;Cubism&quot; to the public as an organized group movement. Metzinger had been close to Picasso and Braque, working at this time along similar lines.
Metzinger, Henri Le Fauconnier and Fernand Léger exhibited coincidentally in Room VIII. This was the moment in which the Montparnasse group quickly grew to include Roger de La Fresnaye, Alexander Archipenko and Joseph Csaky. The three Duchamp brothers, Marcel Duchamp, Jacques Villon and Raymond Duchamp-Villon, and another artist known as Picabia took part in the exhibition. Following this salon Metzinger wrote the article &quot;Notes sur la peinture&quot;, in which he compares the similarities in the works Picasso, Braque, Delaunay, Gleizes and Le Fauconnier. In doing so he enunciated for the first time what would become known as the characteristics of Cubism: notably the notions of simultaneity, mobile perspective. In this seminal text Metzinger stressed the distance between their works and traditional perspective. These artists, he wrote, granted themselves &#x27;the liberty of moving around objects&#x27;, and combining many different views in one image, each recording varying experiences over the course of time.

Once launched at the 1910 Salon d&#x27;Automne, the new movement would rapidly spread throughout Paris.

Convinced that exposure to the work of German designers would prompt healthy competition in the decorative arts, Frantz Jourdain invited artists, architects, designers, and industrialists from the Munich-based Deutscher Werkbund to exhibit at the 1910 salon. &quot;Our art menaced by Bavarian decorators&quot; read the headline of the journal &quot;Le Radical&quot; (12 May 1910). This scandal, in addition to the non-French status of the authors in a time of growing nationalism, aroused the old polemic of exhibiting low-cost production objects, mass-produced items, simply designed furniture and interior decoration, in the context of a salon dedicated to art. Industrial art had never before been so controversial. The exhibition was reviewed in all the major journals. Louis Vauxcelles added to the crisis in a &quot;Gil Blas&quot; article.

The exhibition was an enormous success in that it served to catalyze anew designers, decorators, artists and architects in France, who prior to the 1910 Salon d&#x27;Automne had been lagging behind in the design sector. It also catalyzed public opinion, formerly interested solely in paintings. The fact that the viewers saw first hand, and many for the first time, what had been done abroad, opened up a potential of what could be done in the field of decorative arts at home. Jourdain had successfully staged the German show to provoke French designers into improving the quality of their own work. The effects would be felt in Paris, first with the 1912 exhibition of French decorative arts at the Pavillon de Marsan, then again at the Salon d&#x27;Automne of 1912, with &quot;La Maison Cubiste&quot;, the collaborative effort of the designer André Mare, Raymond Duchamp-Villon and other artists associated with the Section d&#x27;Or.

Henri Matisse exhibited &quot;La Danse&quot; at the Salon d&#x27;Automne of 1910.

==1911, the rise of Cubism==
In Room 7 and 8 of the 1911 Salon d&#x27;Automne, held 1 October through November 8, at the Grand Palais in Paris, hung works by Metzinger (&quot;Le goûter (Tea Time)&quot;), Henri Le Fauconnier, Fernand Léger, Albert Gleizes, Roger de La Fresnaye, André Lhote, Jacques Villon, Marcel Duchamp, František Kupka, Alexander Archipenko, Joseph Csaky and Francis Picabia. The result was a public scandal which brought Cubism to the attention of the general public for the second time. The first was the organized group showing by Cubists in &quot;Salle 41&quot; of the 1911 Salon des Indépendants. In room 41 hung the work of Gleizes, Metzinger, Léger, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Archipenko. Articles in the press could be found in &quot;Gil Blas&quot;, &quot;Comoedia&quot;, &quot;Excelsior&quot;, &quot;Action&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Œuvre&quot;, &quot;Cri de Paris&quot;. Apollinaire wrote a long review in the April 20, 1911, issue of &quot;L&#x27;Intransigeant&quot;. Thus Cubism spread into the literary world of writers, poets, critics, and art historians.

Apollinaire took Picasso to the opening of the Salon d&#x27;Automne in 1911 to see the cubist works in Room 7 and 8.

Albert Gleizes writes of the Salon d&#x27;Automne of 1911: &quot;With the Salon d&#x27;Automne of that same year, 1911, the fury broke out again, just as violent as it had been at the Indépendants.&quot; He writes: &quot;The painters were the first to be surprised by the storms they had let loose without intending to, merely because they had hung on the wooden bars that run along the walls of the Cours-la-Reine, certain paintings that had been made with great care, with passionate conviction, but also in a state of great anxiety.&quot;

It was from that moment on that the word &quot;Cubism&quot; began to be widely used. [...]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Never had the critics been so violent as they were at that time. From which it became clear that these paintings - and I specify the names of the painters who were, alone, the reluctant causes of all this frenzy: Jean Metzinger, Le Fauconnier, Fernand Léger, Robert Delaunay and myself - appeared as a threat to an order that everyone thought had been established forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In nearly all the papers, all composure was lost. The critics would begin by saying: &quot;there is no need to devote much space to the Cubists, who are utterly without importance&quot; and then they furiously gave them seven columns out of the ten that were taken up, at that time, by the Salon. (Gleizes, 1925)

Reviewing the Salon d&#x27;Automne of 1911, Huntly Carter in &quot;The New Age&quot; writes that &quot;art is not an accessory to life; it is life itself carried to the greatest heights of personal expression.&quot; Carter continues:

 It was at the Salon d&#x27;Automne, amid the Rhythmists, I found the desired sensation. The exuberant eagerness and vitality of their region, consisting of two rooms remotely situated, was a complete contrast to the morgue I was compelled to pass through in order to reach it. Though marked by extremes, it was clearly the starting point of a new movement in painting, perhaps the most remarkable in modern times, It revealed not only that artists are beginning to recognise the unity of art and life, but that some of them have discovered life is based on rhythmic vitality, and underlying all things is the perfect rhythm that continues and unites them. Consciously, or unconsciously, many are seeking for the perfect rhythm, and in so doing are attaining a liberty or wideness of expression unattained through several centuries of painting. (Huntly Carter, 1911)

==1912, political ramifications==

The Salon d&#x27;Automne of 1912 was held in Paris at the Grand Palais from 1 October to 8 November. The Cubists (a group of artists now recognized as such) were regrouped into the same room, XI.

The 1912 polemic leveled against both the French and non-French avant-garde artists originated in &quot;Salle XI&quot; of the Salon d&#x27;Automne where the Cubists, among whom were several non-French citizens, exhibited their works. The resistance to both foreigners and avant-garde art was part of a more profound crisis: that of defining modern French art in the wake of Impressionism centered in Paris. Placed into question was the modern ideology elaborated upon since the late 19th century. What had begun as a question of &quot;aesthetics&quot; quickly turned &quot;political&quot; during the Cubist exhibition, and as in the 1905 Salon d&#x27;Automne, the critic Louis Vauxcelles (in Les Arts..., 1912) was most implicated in the deliberations. It was also Vauxcelles who, on the occasion of the 1910 Salon des Indépendants, wrote disparagingly of &#x27;pallid cubes&#x27; with reference to the paintings of Metzinger, Gleizes, Le Fauconnier, Léger and Delaunay. On 3 December 1912 the polemic reached the Chambre des députés (and was debated at the Assemblée Nationale in Paris).
In his 1921 essay on the Salon d&#x27;Automne, published in &quot;Les Echos&quot; (p. 23), founder Frantz Jourdain denouncing aesthetic snobbery, writes that the saber-rattling revolutionaries dubbed the Cubists, Futurists and Dadaists were actually crusty reactionaries who scorned modern progress and revealed contempt for democracy, science, industry and commerce.

For Jourdain, the &#x27;modern spirit&#x27; signified more than a preference for Cézanne over Gérome. Needed was a clear understanding of one&#x27;s epoch, its needs, its beauty, its ambience, its essence.

1 October through 8 November 1912, in excess of 1,770 works were displayed at the 10th Salon d&#x27;Automne. Paul Gallimard organized the exhibition of 52 books. The poster for the 1912 show was made by Pierre Bonnard. Sessions of chamber music took place every Friday. Morning literary sessions were held every Wednesday. The cost of the catalogue was 1 French Franc. The decoration of the Salon d&#x27;Automne had been entrusted to the department store Printemps.

Jourdain again came under vicious attack in 1912—as the French nation drew closer to war in a conservative and fiercely nationalistic political climate—now by the dean of the &quot;Conseil Municipal&quot; and member of the city&#x27;s &quot;Commission des Beaux-Arts&quot;, Jean Pierre Philippe Lampué. Lampué argued, unsuccessfully, that the Salon d&#x27;Automne be refused use of the Grand Palais on the grounds that the organizers were unpatriotic and were undermining—with their foreign &quot;Cubo-Futurist&quot; exhibitions—the artistic heritage of France. He did however manage to raise public opinion against the Salon d&#x27;Automne, the Cubists and Jourdain specifically. The huge scandal prompted the critic Roger Allard to defend Jourdain and the Cubists in the journal &quot;La Côte&quot;, pointing out that it wasn&#x27;t the first time the Salon d&#x27;Automne—as a venue to promote modern art—came under attack by city officials, the Institute, and members of the Conseil. And it would not be the last either.

The Salon d&#x27;Automne from its very inception was one of the most significant avant-garde venues, exhibiting not just painting, drawing and sculpture, but industrial design, urbanism, photography, new developments in music and cinema.
According to Albert Gleizes, Frantz Jourdain (in second place after Vauxcelles) was the sworn enemy of the Cubists, so much so that in his later writing on the Salon d&#x27;Automne Jourdain makes no mention of the 1911 or 1912 exhibitions, yet the publicity generated by the Cubist polemic brought a supplement of 50,000 French Francs, due to influx of visitors that came to see &quot;Les monstres&quot;.

To appease the French, Jourdain invited the &quot;pontiffs des Artistes Français&quot;, writes Gleizes, to an &quot;exposition de portraits&quot; specially organized at the salon. 220 portraits painted during the 19th century were displayed. A reversal of the situation arose, unfortunately for Jourdain, when the guests had to pass through the Cubist room in order to access the portraits. Speculation has it that the itinerary had been judiciously chosen by the hanging committee, since everyone at the Automne seems to have understood.

The Cubist room was packed full with spectators, and others waited in line to get in, explains Gleizes, while no one paid any attention to the portrait room. The consequences, were &#x27;disastrous&#x27; for Jourdain, who, as president of the salon, was ultimately held responsible for the debacle.

Jules-Louis Breton, the French socialist militant politician (nephew of the academic painter Jules Breton), launched a poignant attack against the Cubists exhibiting at the Salon d&#x27;Automne. Breton, with the support of Charles Benoist, accused the French government of sponsoring the excesses of the Cubists by virtue of providing an exhibition space at the Grand Palais. Against the attacks of his colleagues, Marcel Sembat, the French socialist politician, defended the principles of freedom of expression, while refusing the idea of a state-sponsored art. Sembat, closely linked to the arts, with friends including Marquet, Signac, Redon and Matisse (about whom he would write a book). His wife, Georgette Agutte, an artist associated with the Fauves, had exhibited from 1904 at the Salon des Indépendants and participated in the founding of the Salon d&#x27;Automne (her art collection included works by Derain, Matisse, Marquet, Rouault, Vlaminck, Van Dongen, and Signac). Charles Beauquier, the politician and self-proclaimed free-thinker (&quot;libre-penseur&quot;) sided with Breton and Benoist: &quot;We do not encourage garbage! There is garbage in the arts and elsewhere&quot;.
Ultimately, Marcel Sembat won the debate on several fronts: the Salon d&#x27;Automne remained at the Grand Palais des Champs Elysées for years to come; the press coverage following the Assemblée nationale&#x27;s discussions was as intense as it was widespread, publicizing Cubism still further; the reverberations caused by the Cubist scandal echoed across Europe, and elsewhere, extending far beyond what would have been predicted without such publicity. Marcel Sembat would soon become Minister of Public Works; from 1914 to 1916, under Prime Ministers René Viviani and Aristide Briand.

===La Maison Cubiste (Cubist House)===

This Salon d&#x27;Automne also featured &quot;La Maison Cubiste&quot;. Raymond Duchamp-Villon designed façade of a 10 meter by 3 meter house, which included a hall, a living room and a bedroom. This installation was placed in the Art Décoratif section of the Salon d&#x27;Automne. The major contributors were André Mare, a decorative designer, Roger de La Fresnaye, Jacques Villon and Marie Laurencin. In the house were hung cubist paintings by Marcel Duchamp, Albert Gleizes, Fernand Léger, Roger de La Fresnaye, and Jean Metzinger (Woman with a Fan, 1912).

While the geometric decoration of the plaster façade and the paintings were inspired by cubism, the furnishings, carpets, cushions, and wallpapers by André Mare were the beginning of a distinct new style, Art Deco. They were extremely colorful, and consisted of floral designs, particularly stylized roses, in geometric patterns. Thsee themes were to reappear in decoration after the First War through the firm founded by Mare.

Metzinger and Gleizes in &quot;Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;&quot;, written during the assemblage of the &quot;Maison Cubiste&quot;, wrote about the autonomous nature of art, stressing the point that decorative considerations should not govern the spirit of art. Decorative work, to them, was the &quot;antithesis of the picture&quot;. &quot;The true picture&quot; wrote Metzinger and Gleizes, &quot;bears its &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot; within itself. It can be moved from a church to a drawing-room, from a museum to a study. Essentially independent, necessarily complete, it need not immediately satisfy the mind: on the contrary, it should lead it, little by little, towards the fictitious depths in which the coordinative light resides. It does not harmonize with this or that ensemble; it harmonizes with things in general, with the universe: it is an organism...&quot;. &quot;Mare&#x27;s ensembles were accepted as frames for Cubist works because they allowed paintings and sculptures their independence&quot;, wrote Christopher Green, &quot;creating a play of contrasts, hence the involvement not only of Gleizes and Metzinger themselves, but of Marie Laurencin, the Duchamp brothers (Raymond Duchamp-Villon designed the façade) and Mare&#x27;s old friends Léger and Roger La Fresnaye&quot;. &quot;La Maison Cubiste&quot; was a fully furnished house, with a staircase, wrought iron banisters, a living room—the &quot;Salon Bourgeois&quot;, where paintings by Marcel Duchamp, Metzinger (&quot;Woman with a Fan&quot;), Gleizes, Laurencin and Léger were hung—and a bedroom. It was an example of &quot;L&#x27;art décoratif&quot;, a home within which Cubist art could be displayed in the comfort and style of modern, bourgeois life. Spectators at the Salon d&#x27;Automne passed through the full-scale 10-by-3-meter plaster model of the ground floor of the façade, designed by Duchamp-Villon. This architectural installation was subsequently exhibited at the 1913 Armory Show, New York, Chicago and Boston, listed in the catalogue of the New York exhibit as Raymond Duchamp-Villon, number 609, and entitled &quot;Façade architectural, plaster&quot; (&quot;Façade architecturale&quot;).

For the occasion, an article entitled &quot;Au Salon d&#x27;Automne &quot;Les Indépendants&quot;&quot; was published in the French newspaper &quot;Excelsior&quot;, 2 Octobre 1912. Excelsior was the first publication to privilege photographic illustrations in the treatment of news media; shooting photographs and publishing images in order to tell news stories. As such &quot;L&#x27;Excelsior&quot; was a pioneer of photojournalism.

==1913–1914==

By 1913 the predominant tendency in modern art visible at the Salon d&#x27;Automne consisted of Cubism with a clear tendency towards abstraction. The trend to use brighter colors that had already begun in 1911 continued through 1912 and 1913. This exhibition, held from 15 November to 8 January 1914, was dominated by de La Fresnaye, Gleizes and Picabia. Works by Delaunay, Duchamp and Léger were not exhibited.

The preface of the catalog was written by the French Socialist politician Marcel Sembat who a year earlier—against the outcry of Jules-Louis Breton regarding the use of public funds to provide the venue (at the Salon d&#x27;Automne) to exhibit &#x27;barbaric&#x27; art—had defended the Cubists, and freedom of artistic expression in general, in the National Assembly of France.

&quot;I do not in the least wish... to offer a defense of the principles of the cubist movement! In whose name would I present such a defense? I am not a painter... What I do defend is the principle of the freedom of artistic experimentation... My dear friend, when a picture seems bad to you, you have the incontestable right not to look at it, to go and look at others. But one doesn&#x27;t call the police!&quot; (Marcel Sembat)

This exhibition too made its flashing appearance in the news, when a nude by Kees van Dongen entitled &quot;The Spanish Shawl&quot; (&quot;Woman with Pigeons&quot; or &quot;The Beggar of Love&quot;) was ordered by the police to be removed from the Salon d&#x27;Automne. The same would happen in Rotterdam at the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in 1949. The painting is now on display at the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris.

==After 1918==

During World War I (1914 through 1918) no Salon d&#x27;Automne exhibition was held. It wasn&#x27;t until the autumn of 1919 that the Salon d&#x27;Automne once again took place, from 1 November to 10 December, at the Grand Palais in Paris. Special attention, that is, a retrospective, was given to Raymond Duchamp-Villon who died on 9 October 1918. On display were 19 works by the French sculptor dated between 1906 and 1918.

After the war, the Salon d&#x27;Automne was dominated by the works of the Montparnasse painters such as Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani, Georges Braque and Georges Gimel. The Polish expressionist painter Henryk Gotlib and Scottish expressionist painter David Atherton-Smith also exhibited. Constantin Brâncuși, Aristide Maillol, Charles Despiau, René Iché, Ossip Zadkine, and Mateo Hernandez emerged as new forces in sculpture.

In addition to painting and sculpture, the Salon included works in the decorative arts such as the glassworks of René Lalique, Julia Bathory as well as architectural designs by Le Corbusier. Still an exhibition of world importance, the Salon d&#x27;Automne is now into its 2nd century.

==The Avant-Garde in Paris==
In an exhibition entitled &quot;Picasso and the Avant-Garde in Paris&quot; (February 24, 2010 - May 2, 2010), the Philadelphia Museum of Art showcased a partial reconstruction of the 1912 Salon d&#x27;Automne. Many of the works exhibited, however, had not been on display at the 1912 salon, while others exhibited in 1912 were conspicuously absent. The exhibition served to highlight the importance of the Salon Cubism—usually pitted against Gallery Cubism as two opposing camps—in developments and innovations of 20th-century painting and sculpture.

==1922, Braque==
Fourteen years after the rejection of Georges Braque&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Estaque&quot; paintings by the jury of the Salon d&#x27;Automne of 1908 (composed of Matisse, Rouault, Marquet, and Charles-François-Prosper Guérin), Braque was given the accolade of the &quot;Salle d&#x27;Honneur&quot; in 1922, without incident.

==1944, Picasso at the Salon d&#x27;Automne==

In a dramatic case of &quot;situational irony&quot;, a room at the Salon d&#x27;Automne was dedicated to Picasso in 1944. During the crucial years of Cubism, between 1909 and 1914, the dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler forbade Braque and Picasso from exhibiting at both the Salon d&#x27;Automne and the Salon des Indépendants. He thought the salons were places of humor and ribaldry, of jokes, laughter and ridicule. Fearing that Cubism would not be taken seriously in such public exhibitions where thousands of spectators would assemble to see new creations, he signed exclusivity contracts with his artists, ensuring that their works could only be shown (and sold) in the privacy of his own gallery.

After the Liberation of Paris, the first post-World War II Salon d&#x27;Automne was to be held in the fall of 1944 in the newly freed capital. Picasso was given a room of his own that he filled with examples of his wartime production. It was a triumphant return for Picasso who had remained aloof from the art scene during the war. The exhibition however, was &quot;marred by disturbances that have remained unattributed&quot; according to Michèle C. Cone (New York-based critic and historian, author of &quot;French Modernisms: Perspectives on Art before, during and after Vichy&quot;, Cambridge 2001). On Nov. 16, 1944, Matisse wrote a letter to Camoin: &quot;Have you seen the Picasso room? It is much talked about. There were demonstrations in the street against it. What success! If there is applause, whistle.&quot; One can guess who the demonstrators might have been, writes Cone, &quot;cronies of the Fauves, still ranting against the Judeo-Marxist decadent Picasso&quot;.

<text>August Karl Krönig (; 20 September 1822 – 5 June 1879) was a German chemist and physicist who published an account of the kinetic theory of gases in 1856, probably after reading a paper by John James Waterston.

==Biography==
Krönig was born in Schildesche, now part of Bielefeld. After completing his Abitur he attended the University of Bonn for three semesters beginning in 1839 studying primarily Oriental languages. In 1840 he changed focus to physics, chemistry and mathematics and transferred to the University of Berlin, where he completed his doctorate in 1845 with a thesis on chromate salts. He then taught at two schools in Berlin, the &quot;Realgymnasium&quot; in Cölln and the &quot;Königliche Realschule&quot; attached to the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Gymnasium in Berlin. In 1864 he was given a professorship, but he was forced to retire the same year for reasons of ill health.

In 1851 Krönig self-published the &quot;Journal für Physik und physikalische Chemie des Auslandes in vollständigen Übersichten&quot;, but only one year of issues appeared. In 1856 he published a paper on the kinetic theory of gases, thereby becoming a pioneer of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics alongside Rudolf Clausius, James Clerk Maxwell and Ludwig Boltzmann. The paper echoes John James Waterston&#x27;s 1851 paper on the topic, and may be based on it; Clausius&#x27; work was sparked by Krönig&#x27;s paper but emphasised the implication of &quot;equal volumes equal numbers&quot;, which Waterston and Krönig merely noted. Krönig also published various writings on science and on philosophy and theology.

He died in Berlin; his remains were reburied in the family grave at the Stahnsdorf South-Western Cemetery, near Berlin.

She was crowned Miss Puerto Rico 1967 and competed in the Miss Universe 1967 pageant but Unplaced. She later became an actress, appearing in films such as &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; and &quot;Lean on Me&quot; and television series including &quot;Switched at Birth&quot;, &quot;Glee&quot;, and &quot;Teen Wolf&quot;. From 2014 to 2019, Coll starred as Alba Villanueva in the CW comedy-drama series &quot;Jane the Virgin&quot;.

==Early years==
Coll was born on June 18, 1947, in Fajardo, Puerto Rico, where she received her primary and secondary education. Her mother, Rosita Mendoza, was a celebrated hairstylist in Puerto Rico. She also has a sister, Millie. After Coll was born, her father left Puerto Rico for New York City, leaving Coll and her mother behind. When Coll was 10, she and her family moved to the capital of Puerto Rico, San Juan; they lived in the Río Piedras and Hato Rey municipalities of the city. Coll was an honor student and graduated from Nuestra Señora del Pilar school. She then enrolled in the University of Puerto Rico (Universidad de Puerto Rico) where she studied Social Sciences. Coll started her career as a fashion model. In 1966, she represented Fajardo in the Miss Puerto Rico pageant and won. Coll remained the only representative from Fajardo to win the national title until Ashley Cariño won in 2022.

==Career==
===1971–1975: &quot;Una chica llamada Ivonne Coll&quot;===
At the end of 1971, the owner of television channel 11 in Puerto Rico, Rafael Perez Perry spotted Coll. His competitor had a show with a young starlet by the name of Iris Chacón. Perez Perry believed that Coll could have a show of her own to compete. Therefore, he sponsored the show which was called &quot;Una chica llamada Ivonne Coll&quot; (&quot;A girl named Ivonne Coll&quot;), which ran from 1971 to 1975.

In 1976, Coll moved to Los Angeles, California, where she took dance and singing classes in the Academy of Stage and Cinema Arts. She landed a part in a theater play called &quot;Burning Beach&quot;, which was presented in the American Place Theater.

In New York, film director Francis Ford Coppola recruited her for the role of &quot;Yolanda&quot;, a Havana night club singer in &quot;The Godfather II&quot;. Although her role was small, the experience would serve her well in the future. She was credited as &quot;Yvonne Coll&quot;.

In 1989, Coll played a minor role of a teacher named &quot;Mrs. Santos&quot;, in the film &quot;Lean on Me&quot; written by Michael Schiffer, directed by John G. Avildsen and starring Morgan Freeman.

<doc id="932263" wikidata="Q2211127" url="?curid=932263" title="Wood Lane tube station">
<text>Wood Lane is a London Underground station in the White City area of west London, United Kingdom. It is on the Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City lines, between Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Market and Latimer Road stations, and is located in Travelcard Zone 2.

Although it is on a line which has been in operation since 1864, the station is new, having opened on 12 October 2008 – the first station to be built on an existing Tube line for over 70 years. It is near the site of a station of the same name that closed on 24 October 1959.

==History==

The Hammersmith and City line was opened on 13 June 1864 by the Metropolitan Railway (MR) as the Hammersmith branch line. The railway became part of London Underground in 1933 and took on a separate identity as the Hammersmith and City line in 1990.

In 1908 the Franco-British Exhibition and the 1908 Summer Olympics came to London, the first of a number of major events in White City that attracted infrastructural investment by railway companies. Among others, the MR opened its Wood Lane station on the Hammersmith branch to serve the event. From 1927 it was used to transport the public to and from the greyhound racing at White City Stadium. The station opened and closed intermittently, and was renamed twice, to &quot;Wood Lane (White City)&quot; in 1920 and &quot;White City&quot; in 1947, before it closed on 24 October 1959 following fire damage. For the next 49 years, the Wood Lane area was served only by White City on the Central line; Hammersmith line trains passed through the area without stopping, the nearest station on that line approximately away at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush.

In the early 1970s, rebuilding a station on the site was considered as part of the plans for the new White City Channel Tunnel terminal located adjacent, however the plans were abandoned in January 1975.

In 2005, work commenced on the large-scale Westfield Shopping Centre. As part of the work, £200m of transport improvements were made including rebuilding Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Central line station, a new Shepherd&#x27;s Bush railway station and two bus interchanges. It was decided to build a new station on the Hammersmith &amp; City line, just north-east of the old Metropolitan station on Wood Lane. In 2006 Transport for London decided, after deliberating over various possibilities, on the name &quot;Wood Lane&quot;, reviving an historical name. This was the first time that a new station on the Tube had been given the name of a former station that had been closed for several years.

The station opened on 12 October 2008. On 13 December 2009 Wood Lane was added to the Circle line when the line was extended to Hammersmith.
==Design and construction==
Wood Lane Underground Station was designed by Ian Ritchie Architects and it is clad in shot-peened stainless steel, gold anodised aluminium and granite with a 25-metre-high glass screen façade.

Construction was carried out by Costain. The station building occupies an irregularly-shaped site between Wood Lane and the railway viaduct, and presented particular challenges as it lies across the Central line. The lines remained operational during construction, which mostly took place at night.

The structure encases the railway viaduct and platforms are accessed via stairs and lifts either side of the brick arches. During construction the bridge of the Hammersmith &amp; City line over Wood Lane had to be widened to accommodate a new track on the Central line, providing access to the new depot below the Westfield site. A bridge pier was removed and a new steel bridge structure slid into place over a new pier. As with all new Underground stations since the 1990s, the station is fully accessible.

==Location==

The station is on Wood Lane, which runs north from Shepherd&#x27;s Bush in the White City area. It serves the Westfield shopping centre and Television Centre (formerly occupied by the BBC) and Loftus Road stadium, the home of Queen&#x27;s Park Rangers FC, is a short distance away.

<doc id="932268" wikidata="Q1442499" url="?curid=932268" title="Franco-British Exhibition">
<text>The Franco-British Exhibition was a large public fair held in London between 14 May and 31 October 1908. It was the first in the series of the White City Exhibitions. The exhibition attracted 8 million visitors and celebrated the Entente Cordiale signed in 1904 by the United Kingdom and France. The chief architect of the buildings was John Belcher.

The Exhibition was held in an area of west London near Shepherd&#x27;s Bush which is now called White City: the area acquired its name from the exhibition buildings which were all painted white. The 1908 Summer Olympics fencing events were held in the district alongside the festivities.

==Attractions==

The fair was the first international exhibition co-organised and sponsored by two countries. It covered an area of some , including an artificial lake, surrounded by an immense network of white buildings in elaborate (often Oriental) styles.

The most popular attractions at the exhibition were the two so-called &quot;colonial villages&quot;—an &quot;Irish village&quot; and a &quot;Senegalese village&quot;, which were designed to communicate the success of imperialism. The Irish village (&quot;Ballymaclinton&quot;) was inhabited by 150 &quot;colleens&quot; (Irish girls) who demonstrated various forms of domestic industry, as well as displays of manufacturing and even an art gallery. The &quot;Senegalese village&quot; was a so-called &quot;native village&quot; displaying day-to-day life, as well as various artefacts. Press reports commented on the &quot;surprising cleanliness&quot; of the Irish, while readers were reminded that the Senegalese were &quot;cleaner than they looked&quot;.

Also exhibited was Locomotive No.516 from the South Eastern &amp; Chatham Railway (SE&amp;CR) with a tri-composite railway brake carriage.

Limericks were used to advertise this event:

:A maiden of coy disposition,
:Met her fate at the Bush Exhibition,
:When his great love he told her,
:Placed her head on his shoulder,
:And enjoyed the happier position.

:In an Anglo-French section one night,
:A Youth met a Maiden, gay and bright,
:But her idea of pleasure,
:Was of such boundless measure,
:He left with heart heavy – purse light.

In 1937, a large portion of the White City site was cleared to make way for a housing estate. During the clearance, the Flip Flap, and a number of other White City structures, were sold for scrap to the steel firm George Cohen, Sons and Co Limited—the same company who had dismantled the Great Wheel of the Earl&#x27;s Court Exhibition, and went on to dismantle the Skylon, dome, and ten other buildings, at the Festival of Britain site in 1952.

==Balloon accident==
On 14 August 1908, a balloon owned by American balloonist Captain Thomas Turpin Lovelace (1873–1964) exploded at the exhibition, killing his 18-year-old secretary and a male employee. Six others were injured, including a 47-year-old employee who died days after the accident. Newspaper reports indicated that the explosion occurred when a lighted match was thrown to the ground during preparations for a flight.

==In literature and popular culture==
Neil Munro gives a satirical account of a visit to the Franco-British Exhibition in his Erchie Macpherson story &quot;At the Franco-British Exhibition&quot; first published in the &quot;Glasgow Evening News&quot; of 4 July 1908.

==Site today==

After being used for four more exhibitions up to 1914, the site fell into disrepair and was unused for over twenty years. It was then demolished bit by bit to make way for various developments over the last century. First in the 1930s the housing estate in the North of the site, now centred on Commonwealth Avenue, then the Territorial Army (TA) took over a corner on South Africa Road in WW2, The BBC took over much of the remaining site from the 1950s onwards with the BBC Television Centre (now itself being developed into the &#x27;Television Centre&#x27; flats, studios and retail), BBC Media Village and BBC Worldwide buildings and in the early 2000s the last buildings on the East of Wood Lane were demolished to make way for the Westfield London development.

Only the internal structure of the TA building on South Africa Road remains from the numerous halls and ornate buildings of the original exhibition. Hammersmith Park, at the north of Frithville Gardens, was once part of the Japanese Garden, and is the only part of the 1908 exhibition site still visible. A small area of tiling preserved from the Garden could be seen inside the main Television Centre site adjacent to the Studio 1 Audience Entrance. The White City Stadium site, in Wood Lane adjacent to the Westway overpass and once part of the Exhibition, is now occupied by the BBC Media Village.

<text>Gus (Honeycomb) Johnson Jr. (December 13, 1938 – April 29, 1987) was an American college and professional basketball player in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and American Basketball Association (NBA). A chiseled , forward who occasionally played center, Johnson spent nine seasons with the Baltimore Bullets before he split his final campaign between the Phoenix Suns and ABA champions Indiana Pacers. He was a five-time NBA All-Star before chronic knee issues and dubious off-court habits took their tolls late in his career.

Johnson was the prototype of the modern NBA power forward, a rare combination of brute strength, deceptive quickness, creative flair and startling leaping ability who played with equal flair and ferocity at both ends of the court. Well known for his frequent forays above the rim, he was among the first wave of great dunk shot artists in the game. He shattered three backboards on dunk attempts in his career, tearing down his first basket in 1964 at the Kiel Auditorium in St. Louis against the Hawks. He last shattered a backboard against the Milwaukee Bucks on January 10, 1971, leaving the game with an injured wrist.

Known as &quot;The Honeycomb Kid&quot;, or &quot;Honeycomb&quot; for short, a nickname that his University of Idaho coach bestowed on him, Johnson was one of the colorful personalities of his era. He wore expensive shoes and Continental suits and drove a purple Bonneville convertible around town. Early in his career, he had a gold star set into one of his front teeth, which was readily seen in his friendly smile. Because as Johnson once put it, a star deserved a star.

As a member of the Bullets, Johnson was voted to the All-Rookie Team for 1963–64, averaging 17.3 points and 13.6 rebounds per game. He was named to the All-NBA Second Team four times and to the All-NBA Defense First Team on two occasions. His number 25 jersey was retired by the Bullets franchise in 1986, months before his death.

Johnson was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010.

==Early life==
Born amid the slums of central Akron, Ohio, Johnson was one of six children. As a teenager, Johnson spent more time at local bars and pool halls than he did libraries and book stores.

&quot;Despite my ways, I never got into any real bad trouble in Akron,&quot; Johnson recalled in a 1964 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; article. &quot;I just drifted around. Nothing mattered except basketball and the Bible. I used to read the Bible all the time. I still do. I&#x27;m real big on Samson. He&#x27;s helped me a lot, I suppose. He stimulates me.&quot;

Johnson attended Akron Central High School, where he was an all-state basketball player and did well enough to graduate. Among his teammates was center Nate Thurmond, a future Hall of Fame member who towered above foes and teammates alike. In part, that accounted for the fact that, despite his own clear talent and athletic ability, Johnson had few college athletic scholarship offers.

==College career==

Johnson enrolled at hometown Akron, but he dropped out before basketball started and joined a nearby Amateur Athletic Union club. While playing for the AAU Cleveland Pipers of the National Industrial Basketball League in 1960, he was spotted by a former teammate of first-year Idaho head coach Joe Cipriano. It wasn&#x27;t long before the university offered him a scholarship offer. First, Johnson made a stop at Boise Junior College to improve his grades. He averaged 30 points and 20 rebounds a game for the Broncos.

As a sophomore, Johnson transferred north to the University of Idaho in Moscow in 1962. The Vandals had a .500 season at 13–13 the previous season, and the addition of Johnson made an immediate impact as they won their first five games and were 12–2 through January. Idaho was actually undefeated through January with Johnson playing: due to NCAA rules (junior college transfer originally enrolled at a four-year school) at the time, he was allowed to play regular season games only, not tournaments. The Vandals went 1–2 without him at the Far West Classic in late December in Portland, and the victory was a one-pointer over WSU. A week earlier with Johnson, the Vandals routed the Cougars by 37 points in Moscow.

Johnson became known as &quot;Honeycomb,&quot; a nickname Cipriano gave him because of his sweet play. As a junior, he averaged 19.0 points and 20.3 rebounds per game during the 1962–63 season, leading independent Idaho to a 20–6 record, their best in 36 years. With Johnson and leading scorer Chuck White, the Vandals were at their best in their main rivalries, 4–0 versus Oregon, 4–1 versus Palouse neighbor Washington State, and 1–1 against Washington. Idaho&#x27;s primary nemesis was Seattle University, led by guard Eddie Miles, who won all three of its games with the Vandals. Idaho lost its only game with Final Four-bound Oregon State at the Far West without Johnson, but won all three with Gonzaga, for a 9–3 record against its four former PCC foes and a collective 12–6 against the six Northwest rivals. Attendance at the Memorial Gym was consistently over-capacity, with an estimated 3,800 for home games in the cramped facility. Johnson and center Paul Silas of Creighton waged a season-long battle to lead the NCAA in rebounding. Silas claimed this by averaging 20.6 per game, 0.3 per game more than Johnson&#x27;s average. Johnson also set the UI record with 31 rebounds in a game against Oregon. Ducks head coach Steve Belko, a former Vandal, called Johnson a &quot;6&#x27; 6&quot; Bill Russell,&quot; and &quot;the best ball player one of my teams has ever played against...&quot;

Despite their 20–6 () record, the Vandals sat out the post-season. The 1963 NCAA tournament included only 25 teams, and Oregon State and Seattle were selected from the Northwest. The 1963 NIT invited only twelve teams, none from the Mountain or Pacific time zones. If the Vandals had been invited, Johnson again would not have been eligible to participate.

During his time at Idaho, Johnson&#x27;s standing high jump ability led the Corner Club, a local sports bar, to establish &quot;The Nail&quot; challenge. Anyone who could match Johnson&#x27;s leap from a standing start to touch a nail hammered above the ground would win free drinks. It only happened 23 years later when high jumper Joey Johnson, brother of basketball hall of famer Dennis Johnson, touched the nail. Ironically, both Gus Johnson and Dennis Johnson were posthumously inducted into the hall of fame in 2010.

Johnson turned professional after his only season at Idaho, and Cipriano moved on to coach at Nebraska. Without Johnson (and White), the Vandals fell to 7–19 in 1963–64 and were 4–6 in the new Big Sky Conference, fifth place in the six-team league. They had a dismal 3–14 record through January and lost every game against their Northwest rivals, a collective 0–10 vs UW, WSU, UO, OSU, Seattle U., and Gonzaga.

Following his professional career, Johnson returned to Moscow to help commemorate the first basketball game in the newly enclosed Kibbie Dome, held on January 21, 1976. He participated in a pre-game alumni contest between former players of Idaho and Washington State.

==Professional career==

===Baltimore Bullets (1963–1972)===
Johnson got a late start as an NBA player, as he turned age 25 in December of his rookie season. He was selected tenth overall (second round) of the 1963 NBA draft by the Chicago Zephyrs, who were in the process of moving to Baltimore, where they became known as the Bullets in the 1963–64 season.

Johnson was an immediate starter under head coach Bob Leonard and averaged 17.3 points and 13.6 rebounds per game. Johnson finished as the runner-up for the Rookie of the Year honors to Jerry Lucas, the much-heralded Cincinnati Royals star forward and one-time Ohio State national champion and the U.S. Olympic basketball team member. Lucas and Johnson required no introduction. The two had faced each other in high school in Ohio, which marked the start of a rivalry that grew more intense at the professional level. So much so that Johnson was known to stare at a photo of Lucas as a source of motivation before their games. Johnson was selected to the NBA All-Rookie Team along with Lucas and Nate Thurmond, his one-time high school teammate.

Playing with Baltimore under Leonard, the young starting five, consisting of center Walt Bellamy (the first overall draft pick in 1961 and the 1962 rookie-of-the-year for the Chicago Zephyrs), forwards Terry Dischinger (a member of the 1962-1963 all rookie team as a Chicago Zephyr) and Johnson, and guards Rod Thorn and Kevin Loughery were nicknamed the &quot;kiddie corps.&quot;

Said Leonard about a young Johnson, &quot;I could see Gussie developing into one of the great defensive forwards of all time.&quot;

From the start, Johnson was both a lethal inside scorer and an exciting open-court player. During his early years, the Bullets regularly finished in last place not only in the Eastern Division but also the league. However, with good first and second-round draft choices every year, the Bullets gradually grew to be a better team, adding these players – who all made the NBA All-Rookie Team: Johnson (1963–1964), Rod Thorn (1963–1964), Wali Jones (1964–1965), Jack Marin (1966–1967), Earl Monroe (1967–1968), and finally, the keystone of a championship team, Wes Unseld, who became both the Rookie-of-the-Year and the NBA Most Valuable Player for 1968–69. That same year, the Bullets won the NBA Eastern Division for their very first time.

Johnson was among the most effective two-way players of his time. His scoring moves around the basket were comparable to those of his peers Elgin Baylor and Connie Hawkins. Yet, however effective as Johnson was a post-up player, with his medium-range jump shot, and on the fast break, he was even more effective as an aggressive defender and a rebounder throughout his time in the NBA. Indeed, he was one of the select few players who was quick enough to be paired against backcourt great Oscar Robertson, yet strong enough to hold his own against the taller forwards of the NBA in the front line, or even be called upon to defend Wilt Chamberlain.

Despite chronic knee problems that would limit his games played and shorten his career, Johnson was a member of the NBA All-Star Team five times. During his NBA career, Johnson averaged 17.1 points and 12.7 rebounds per game. He also scored 25 points in 25 minutes in the 1965 NBA All-Star Game.

Gus Johnson had his best years with the Bullets from 1968 to 1971, including the watershed basketball year of 1968–69. While the Bullets improved, Johnson received more recognition from the press and the spectators for his outstanding play at forward. He was voted onto the All-NBA second-team during this time span. During the 1968–69 season, the Bullets achieved their best regular-season record but were quickly swept out of the playoffs by the Knicks, largely because Johnson was sidelined during the playoff series with an injury.

After fading to third place in the Eastern Division in 1969–70, Johnson played a key role in Baltimore&#x27;s unexpected run to the Finals the following season by averaging 13 points and 10.4 rebounds per playoff game. First, the Bullets beat the Philadelphia 76ers in a grueling seven game semifinals series, then they upset the top-seeded and defending champion New York Knicks four games to three in the Eastern Conference Finals, and advanced to the NBA Finals. But injuries had decimated the team, and the Bullets were swept in four straight by the Milwaukee Bucks, led by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Robertson, and Bobby Dandridge.

Injuries kept Johnson on the bench for most of 1971–72, limiting him to 39 games and 6 points per game. That season would be his last with the Bullets; the team would trade for Elvin Hayes the following summer. In nine seasons with Baltimore, he averaged 17.5 points, 12.9 rebounds, 2.9 assists and 35.2 minutes in 560 games.

===Phoenix Suns (1972)===
Johnson was traded to the Phoenix Suns on April 12, 1972, completing a transaction from two days prior when the Bullets acquired a second-round pick (25th overall) in the 1972 NBA draft and selected Tom Patterson. Johnson played 21 games before being waived on December 1. He averaged 7.8 points and 6.5 rebounds in 19.9 minutes under head coaches Butch van Breda Kolff (fired after seven games) and Jerry Colangelo, Johnson&#x27;s former Baltimore teammate.

===Indiana Pacers (1972–1973)===
The Indiana Pacers, then of the American Basketball Association (ABA), picked up Johnson after he was recruited to the Pacers by one of his former Baltimore coaches, Hall of Fame inductee Slick Leonard. He played his first game with the Pacers on December 16, 1972, and became a steadying veteran influence on a young team which went on to win the 1973 ABA championship.

&quot;It doesn&#x27;t hurt to have some veterans around, and Gus was great for team chemistry,&quot; Leonard said of adding Johnson to the Pacers.

Playing in 50 games with the Pacers, and reunited with his former Coach Slick Leonard, Johnson averaged 6.0 points and 4.9 rebounds, playing alongside 22 year-old future Hall of Famer George McGinnis, Hall of Famer Mel Daniels, Hall of Famer Roger Brown, Freddie Lewis, Donnie Freeman, Darnell Hillman and Billy Keller.

&quot;Gus came to us at the end of his career when he had lost a lot of his physical abilities, but he really wanted a shot at making a run at a championship,&quot; recalled Darnell Hillman of Johnson&#x27;s influence on the Pacers. &quot;And his coming to the team made us that much more solid. He was a great, great individual. The locker room was where he was really an asset. He always knew the right things to say and he could read people. He knew who would be a little bit off or down and he could just bring you right back into focus and send you out on the floor. He was also very instrumental in being like an assistant coach to Slick on the bench. Sometimes when Slick didn&#x27;t go to the assistant coach, he&#x27;d ask Gus.&quot;

In the ABA playoffs, Johnson and the Pacers defeated the Denver Rockets and Ralph Simpson 4–1 and the Utah Stars with Hall of Famer Zelmo Beaty and ironman Ron Boone 4–2 to advance to the ABA Finals against the Kentucky Colonels with Hall of Famers Artis Gilmore, Dan Issel and Louie Dampier.

The Pacers defeated the Colonels 4–3 in the 1973 ABA Finals to capture the ABA championship, with Johnson playing 13 minutes and grabbing 6 rebounds in the decisive Game 7, an 88–81 Pacers victory at Freedom Hall in Louisville, Kentucky. When Indiana center Daniels was in foul trouble toward the end of Game 7, even with his bad knees, the 35-year old Johnson was called off the bench to defend Kentucky&#x27;s Gilmore. Johnson successfully did so, even though Gilmore was 7&#x27;2&quot; tall and 11 years younger than Johnson. It was Johnson&#x27;s final career game. Overall, Johnson averaged 2.7 points and 4.0 rebounds in the Finals off the bench.

Injuries limited Johnson&#x27;s pro basketball career to 10 seasons.

==Later years==
Shortly before his death from inoperable brain cancer, his jersey number 25 was retired by the Washington Bullets on his 48th birthday. Upon Johnson&#x27;s death, Bullets owner Abe Pollin remarked &quot;Gus was the Dr. J of his time, and anyone who had the privilege of seeing him play will never forget what a great basketball player Gus Johnson was.&quot;

A month later he was also honored by the two college programs he played for, Boise State and Idaho, during a conference basketball game between the two teams on January 17, 1987. A crowd of 12,225 at the BSU Pavilion in Boise set a Big Sky attendance record for a regular season game, and the visiting Vandals overcame an eight-point deficit in the second half to win by ten. That month in a ceremony in Akron, his No. 43 was retired by Idaho, the first basketball number retired in school history.

Before his death and reflecting on his career, Johnson had expressed that his greatest fear was that he would die and his daughters &quot;don&#x27;t even know what their daddy did.&quot;

Johnson died less than four months later at Akron City Hospital on April 29, 1987, at the age of 48, and is buried at Mount Peace Cemetery in Akron. He was survived by his four daughters.

==Accolades==
Teammate and hall of famer Earl Monroe said of Gus Johnson – &quot;Gus was ahead of his time, flying through the air for slam dunks, breaking backboards and throwing full-court passes behind his back. He was spectacular, but he also did the nitty gritty jobs, defense and rebounding. With all the guys in the Hall of Fame, Gus deserves to be there already.&quot;

&quot;I first saw Gus on television...I had never seen a player dominate a game so. Gus was the Dr. J of his time and anyone that ever had the privilege to see him play will never forget what a great basketball player Gus Johnson was.&quot; – Abe Pollin – Former Owner of the Washington Bullets/Wizards Franchise.

New York Knicks Hall of Fame coach Red Holzman thought Johnson was superior to Michael Jordan or Julius Erving in leaping to dunk from the foul line because Johnson did not need an extra step to generate momentum.

&quot;Gus Johnson was one of the greatest players I ever played with or against,&quot; teammate and hall of famer Wes Unseld said. &quot;He was a ferocious defender and rebounder, and as a young player, I was completely in awe of his ability. He was truly a star ahead of his time.&quot;

&quot;Gus was probably one of the roughest players I have ever played against. He was not a dirty player. He was one of the most tenacious
competitors ever to play the game.&quot; – Hall of Famer Dave DeBusschere.

“If he played today, ol’ Gussie would be a human highlight film,” said hall of famer Slick Leonard of Johnson. “That’s what people remember the most. But there was a lot more to his game than the spectacular dunks. He was special. He could play, man.”

Oscar Robertson, a member of the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary Team that included the leagues 76 greatest players, described Johnson as &quot;&#x27;one of the truly great forwards of our time,&#x27; ... and one of the best rebounders I’ve ever seen in my life.&#x27;”

Paul Silas, who was Johnson&#x27; rebounding rival in college, and an NBA player and coach, was on the court for the St. Louis Hawks in 1964 when Johnson tore down the basket while dunking. Silas has described Johnson as &quot;tremendously gifted&quot;, with great jumping ability and strength, who did not fear contact.

<text>White City is a London Underground station on Wood Lane in White City, west London, England. It is on the Central line between East Acton and Shepherd&#x27;s Bush stations, and is located in Travelcard Zone 2. The station is in a deep brick-sided cutting – and is designed in a similar way to Harrow-on-the-Hill station.

==History==
The station was opened on 23 November 1947, replacing the earlier Wood Lane station. Its construction started after 1938 and had been scheduled for completion by 1940, but the Second World War delayed its opening for another seven years. The architectural design of the station won an award at the Festival of Britain and a commemorative plaque recording this is attached to the building to the left of the main entrance.

==The station today==

An interesting feature of the station is that the line adopts right-hand running through the station rather than the conventional left-hand running. This is a historical consequence of the reversal of the tracks in the tunnels of the anti-clockwise loop track built for the now-disused Wood Lane station, situated a short distance to the south of White City which was opened in 1908 as the then western terminus of the Central London Railway. The two tracks return to their normal left-hand orientation by a surface fly-over roughly halfway between White City and East Acton stations.

The station&#x27;s running layout has three tracks, with the centre track having platforms on each side meaning that it can handle trains running in either direction. A siding between the running lines to the north of the station allows trains from Central London to be reversed and run back eastwards. Trains going out of service can return to the below-ground White City depot to the south of the station via sidings between the running lines.

The nearby Wood Lane station on the Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City lines provides an interchange between the lines.

This station is also directly opposite the BBC Television Centre and is within walking distance of Loftus Road, home of Queens Park Rangers F.C. and Westfield London.

The station received a certificate of merit in the 2009 National Railway Heritage Awards, London Regional category, for the modernisation (completed in 2008) that took care to retain heritage and architectural features.

==Similarly named station==
An earlier Wood Lane station on the Metropolitan line was located a short distance to the south and was also known as &quot;White City&quot; from 23 November 1947 until its closure in 1959.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 72, 95, 220, 228, 272 and night route N72 serve the station directly. White City bus station is a few minutes walk south of the station.

<text>Leopoldo Nobili, born on 5 July 1784 in Trassilico (Toscana) and died on 22 August 1835 in Florence, was an Italian physicist who invented a number of instruments critical to investigating thermodynamics and electrochemistry.

Born Trassilico, Garfagnana, after attending the Military Academy of Modena he became an artillery officer. He was awarded the Légion d&#x27;honneur for his service in Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia.

In 1825 he developed the astatic galvanometer.
He worked with Macedonio Melloni on the &quot;thermomultiplier&quot;, a combination of thermopile and galvanometer, before being appointed professor of physics at the Reale Museo di Fisica e Storia Naturale (Royal Museum of Physics and Natural History) in Florence where he worked with Vincenzo Antinori on electromagnetic induction.

He was also credited with the discovery of &#x27;Nobili&#x27;s Rings&#x27;. &quot;When a dilute solution of copper acetate is placed on a bright silverplate and a strip of zinc is touched to the silver beneath the copper, a series of rings of copper are formed by electrolysis around the zinc.&quot;

<doc id="932277" wikidata="Q2092988" url="?curid=932277" title="Ducktail">
<text>The ducktail is a men&#x27;s haircut style popular during the 1950s. It is also called the duck&#x27;s tail, duck&#x27;s ass, duck&#x27;s arse, or simply D.A. and is also described as slicked back hair. The hair is pomaded (greased), combed back around the sides, and parted centrally down the back of the head.

==History==
Joe Cirello, a barber from Philadelphia, said he had invented the duck&#x27;s ass in 1940, and he called the swung hair sides and their termination &#x27;The Swing&#x27;, after the musical style of the day. He&#x27;d practiced on a lonely blind boy for about eighteen months. The duck&#x27;s tail became an emblematic coiffure of disaffected young males across the English-speaking world during the 1950s. In Britain, it formed part of the visual identity of teddy boys and rockers, along with the quiff and the elephant&#x27;s trunk.

==Combing technique==

The style required that the hair be combed back around the sides of the head. The teeth edge of a comb was then used to define a central parting running from the crown to the nape at the back of the head, resembling, to many, the rear end of a duck. The hair on the top front of the head was either deliberately disarrayed so that untidy strands hung down over the forehead, or combed up and then curled down into an &#x27;elephant&#x27;s trunk&#x27; which would hang down as far as the top of the nose. The sides were styled to resemble the folded wings of the duck.

A variant of the style, the Detroit, consisted of the long back and sides combined with a flattop. In California, the top hair was allowed to grow longer and combed into a wavelike pompadour shape known as a &quot;breaker&quot;.

The ducktail hair style contributed to the term &quot;greasers&quot;: to accomplish this look, much pomade (hair grease) was required to hold the hair in place. This was still the era of hair creams, so it only required an increase in the amount to make hair remain in the desired style. Brands of grease used include Black &amp; White, Sweet Georgia Brown, Royal Crown, and Murrays. On the West Coast of the US, pomades such as Dixie Peach or Brylcreem, and tonics such as Wildroot Cream-Oil were popular.

To ensure that the hair was just so, the wearer often touched up the D.A. many times during the day by running his greased comb through it. This led to a stylized means of handling the comb by drawing it out of the back pocket of a pair of jeans using the extended index and middle finger, and, holding it thus, running the comb through the two side &quot;wings&quot; of the style to adjust their shape.

==Significance==
The D.A. quickly became a stereotypical feature of rebels, mobsters, and nonconformists, and gained popularity especially after the rise of rock &#x27;n roll legend Elvis Presley, who sported the same look. Although the ducktail was adopted by Hollywood to represent the wild youth of the 1950s, only a minority of males actually sported a D.A., even amongst the British Rockers and Teddy Boys of the same era. The style became popular in India after film star Shammi Kapoor sported it. It is also associated with men of Mediterranean, Eastern European and/or Latin American descent, though in slightly different styles.

<doc id="932278" wikidata="Q2593086" url="?curid=932278" title="Wood Lane tube station (Central line)">
<text>Wood Lane is a former station on the London Underground located in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, west London. It was latterly served by the Central line and from 1908 to 1920 was the western terminus of the Central line&#x27;s precursor, the Central London Railway (CLR).

Wood Lane station was built to serve the 1908 Franco-British Exhibition and the 1908 Olympic Games. Its location was very confined and its configuration awkward, requiring alterations on a number of occasions to meet operational requirements.

It closed in 1947 following the opening of the nearby White City station. In 2008, a new Wood Lane station was opened nearby on the Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City lines.

==History==

===Wood Lane depot===
Prior to the 1908 Franco-British Exhibition, the western terminus of the Central London Railway (CLR) was at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush. North of Shepherd&#x27;s Bush were the CLR&#x27;s power station and Wood Lane depot. Trains originally accessed the depot via a single, sharply-curved tunnel from the station&#x27;s westbound platform, heading northwards under Caxton Street. Trains then exited the tunnel to the north of the depot and used a reversing siding to run into the depot in a southbound direction. Trains running from the depot reversed the process and entered the eastbound platform of Shepherd&#x27;s Bush station via a junction to the west of the station.

===Temporary exhibition station===

When the exhibition opened, a temporary station was constructed within the northern perimeter of the depot on the site of the reversing siding. A new tunnel was bored to connect directly to the end of the eastbound tunnel at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush station, forming a loop.

As constructed for the exhibition, Wood Lane station had just a single track with platforms on each side: one for loading and the other for unloading. Trains entered the station anti-clockwise in a westbound direction from the tunnel under the depot, and exited heading south back into the tunnel in the direction of Shepherd&#x27;s Bush station.

Following the success of the exhibition a number of other entertainment venues, notably White City Stadium, grew up in the area and the temporary station at Wood Lane became a permanent fixture.

===Permanent station expansion===
Wood Lane became the western terminus of the CLR. Until the late 1920s, the railway used carriages that were accessed by gated entrances at the carriage ends. When new rolling stock was introduced with sliding pneumatic doors, Wood Lane&#x27;s loop platforms had to be extended to provide access to all doors but it was not possible to extend the platform on the inside of the loop (the south side) as it interfered with an access track to the depot. A pivoting section of platform was constructed that could be moved to allow access to the depot to be made when required.

CLR services began to operate to Ealing Broadway from August 1920 and Wood Lane was reconfigured to accommodate through-running from Ealing Broadway to the West End of London and the City of London, thereby losing its terminus status.

A new sub-surface tunnel was constructed to the north of the existing loop platforms on which was located a new westbound platform for trains heading to Ealing Broadway. Another new sub-surface tunnel was constructed to the west (and below) the loop platforms, providing an eastbound platform for trains from Ealing Broadway. Trains terminating or starting at Wood Lane continued to use the loop platforms. The station thus had a triangular shape.

===Closure===

Due to its awkward configuration and unsatisfactory operation, Wood Lane was closed in 1947 when a replacement station called White City was opened on the Central line a short distance to the north. Consequent on the awkward layout of Wood Lane, the layout of White City necessitated that the trains run on the right rather than the left as is normal. The tracks swap sides west of White City to facilitate normal running.

The Wood Lane platforms were abandoned and the depot became known as White City depot.

===Demolition===
Until the station&#x27;s demolition between 2003 and 2005, the old eastbound platform could still be seen from passing trains heading from White City to Shepherd&#x27;s Bush and the former eastbound platform was incorporated into the new depot&#x27;s roads using the single track, which can clearly be seen when leaving White City station when travelling to Shepherd&#x27;s Bush.

The site of the station and the depot was redeveloped for the Westfield London shopping centre, and in summer 2005 the curving ramps to the original 1908 platforms and the platforms themselves, in the north-west corner of the site, were removed. A new depot was constructed completely below ground, underneath the Westfield London shopping centre.
Elements of the original Wood Lane street level building facade were dismantled and moved to the London Transport Museum&#x27;s depot in Acton for reconstruction. The restoration works on the roundel pediment were completed by London Underground in 2009. The Underground roundel is now on display at the current Wood Lane station.

==In popular culture==
In &quot;The Tomorrow People&quot;&#x27;s first serial, &quot;Slaves of Jedikiah&quot;, the outdoor shots of the abandoned station where the lab was located showed it to be Wood Lane. The BBC drama series &quot;Survivors&quot; used the location in the second season, 1976 episode &quot;The Lights of London&quot;. Also, the dockland scenes in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot; were enacted there.

A 1987 edition of the &quot;South Bank Show&quot; about the London Underground was introduced by Melvyn Bragg, who appeared out of the fog carrying a torch on the platform at Wood Lane station.

In the 1988 animation movie &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; directed by Robert Zemeckis, the scenes for the Acme factory were filmed in the former power house (later known as the Dimco Buildings) in the Wood Lane Depot (now part of the Westfield Shopping Centre). It is a Grade II listed building.

<text>Irmin Schmidt (born 29 May 1937) is a German keyboardist and composer, best known as a founding member of the band Can and composer of numerous film scores.

==Biography==
===Early life and composer career===
Irmin Schmidt was born on 29 May 1937 in Berlin, Germany, to Kurt and Margot Schmidt. Schmidt&#x27;s father was an architect and engineer, and both his parents played piano. His board school teacher in modern history has been &quot;Schulungsleiter&quot; (teacher of ideology) in the Reichsarbeitsdienst during the rule of the Third Reich. Schmidt wrote about it in his school newspaper, and the teacher was fired.

Schmidt began his studies in music at the conservatorium in Dortmund, and expanded his education in conducting at the Folkwang Hochschule in Essen, studying under Heinz Dressel. Additionally, he took a piano lessons from Detlef Kraus and studied composition under the Hungarian avant-garde composer György Ligeti. Schmidt started work mainly as a conductor and performed in concerts with the Bochum Symphony, the Vienna Symphony, and the Dortmund Ensemble for New Music, which he founded in 1962. During this time, Schmidt conducted the West German premiere of John Cage&#x27;s &quot;Atlas Eclipticalis&quot; with Bochum Symphony Orchestra and performed Cage&#x27;s piano piece &quot;Winter Music&quot;.

Schmidt attended the Mozarteum in Salzburg, Austria to further develop his conducting skills under István Kertész. In 1964-1965, Schmidt attended up for the Cologne Courses for New Music at the in Cologne, taught by Karlheinz Stockhausen, Luciano Berio, Henri Pousseur, and Earle Brown, the course which was also attended by his future band-mates, Holger Schüring and David C. Johnson. By 1966 Schmidt got a position as Kapellmeister at the Theater Aachen, hired as docent for musical theatre and chanson, and worked at the Schauspielschule Bochum (drama school) teaching vocal technique.

In January 1966, Schmidt made his first-time travel to the United States, flying to New York City to compete in the &quot;Dimitri Mitropoulos Conducting Competition&quot;. He got into the city&#x27;s flourishing underground arts scene: watched Andy Warhol&#x27;s movies, and spent time with several young progenitors of avant-garde and minimalist music, including La Monte Young, Dick Higgins, Steve Reich, and Terry Riley. Schmidt played piano in a session with Riley.

Schmidt&#x27;s spouse Hildegard introduced him to Russian-American composer Serge Tcherepnin, and Irmin played the saxophone part at the 1966 premiere of Tcherepnin&#x27;s &quot;Morning After Piece&quot;.

In 1967, Irmin performed several Fluxus-style diagrammatic scores, and published them as &quot;Album für Mogli&quot;, pet name for his spouse Hildegard. &quot;Album für Mogli&quot; has been organized as a set of thirteen-sheet manuscript, supposed to be stacked in any order by any number of musicians. The score&#x27;s composition &quot;Hexapussy&quot; premiered in Frankfurt, played on metallic sound-sculptures created by the Baschet Brothers. Other titles included&quot; &quot;Oiml(g): Nightmares&quot;, &quot;Gagaku&quot;, &quot;Für Jackson MacLow&quot;, &quot;Erinnerung&quot;, &quot;Dieter&#x27;s Lullaby&quot;, &quot;Nada&quot;, &quot;Prinzipien&quot;, and other. &quot;Hexapussy&quot; remained as an only survived recording, appearing on the soundtrack composed by Can for 1969 film Agilok &amp; Blubbo.

On a number of occasions, Irmin was asked to give talks or perform avant-garde music at gallery openings organized by . Schulze-Vellinghausen, in turn, acquainted Schmidt with interior designer and up-in-coming gallerist Hans Mayer.

===Can and film scores===
In the autumn of 1967, Irmin wrote a letter to his friend composer, Holger Czukay, inviting him to Cologne and suggesting they should form a band. In 1968, in the midst of the West German student movement, Schmidt co-formed the Inner Space band (later known as Can) with Holger Czukay, Michael Karoli, Jaki Liebezeit, and David C. Johnson. Schmidt took part in the band&#x27;s recording sessions playing keyboard until the group&#x27;s disbandment in 1979. He participated in the band&#x27;s reunions in 1986, 1991, and 1999. He later commented on their relation to the political movement of 1968, saying the band weren&#x27;t involved in the movement, &quot;physically or even theoretically, but was a reflection of the ongoing tumult that rejected any overt political affiliations&quot;.

Early in 1968, Irmin received a commission to provide music for 1969 film Agilok &amp; Blubbo at the recommendation of Hans Wewerka who the worked as the film&#x27;s producer and previously published Irmin&#x27;s &quot;Album für Mogli&quot; score. Around May, Irmin had made a loose sketch of the soundtrack, aided by David C. Johnson, and eventually decided to invite his new band on the project, which became the band&#x27;s first released recording. When searching for a base for the new group, Irmin had &quot;put the word out among his art world friends&quot;, and German literary scholar Hans Mayer responded, redirecting him to the art collector and their joined acquaintance, . Vohwinkel recently leased a historic castle, Schloss Nörvenich, on the outskirts of Cologne and planned to repurpose it as an artistic commune. He invited the band to stay at the castle rent-free for a year.

Schmidt has scored more than forty films and television programs, including &quot;Knife in the Head&quot; (1978) and &quot;Palermo Shooting&quot; (2008). He has recorded a few solo albums and written an opera, &quot;Gormenghast&quot;, based on Mervyn Peake&#x27;s &quot;Gormenghast Trilogy&quot;. &quot;Gormenghast&quot; premiered at the Opernhaus Wuppertal in 1998. Excerpts from the work were released on Spoon Records in 1999.

As of 2008, Schmidt lived in Southern France. His interests outside music include cooking. In 2015, he received the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (Chevalier).

In 2018, Schmidt and British writer and editor Rob Young published a book on Can entitled &quot;All Gates Open: The Story of Can&quot;.

Following the death of Can&#x27;s second lead vocalist Damo Suzuki in February 2024, Schmidt is one of the last surviving members of the band&#x27;s classic lineups, alongside original vocalist Malcolm Mooney.

==Personal life==
Irmin Schmidt began a relationship with Hildegard Reittenberger after performing at the East German music festival in 1957. The couple got married six years later in 1963. They have a daughter, Sandra, born in April 1970. Sandra married Jono Podmore in 2001. The couple has a daughter Lara Podmore.

Hildegard became Can&#x27;s manager in 1972, after they fired their previous manager, Abi Ofarim. In 1979, she established record label, Spoon Records, taking control of the copyright for the Can discography.

<text>Stephen Eric Pearcy (born July 3, 1956) is an American musician who is the founder, singer, songwriter of the heavy metal band Ratt. He has also created the bands Firedome, Crystal Pystal, Arcade, Vicious Delite, and Vertex. He has also recorded seven albums as a solo artist.

==Career==

In his early teens, Pearcy aspired to be a top fuel race car driver and expressed no desire to pursue a career in music. He started the bands Firedome and Crystal Pystal. Pearcy also wrote music for a band that he named Mickey Ratt (formed in San Diego in 1977). 

In 1981, the band&#x27;s name was shortened to Ratt, and the original lineup was solidified in 1983. Playing clubs such as The Troubadour, The Roxy and The Whisky, Ratt amassed a large local following. After releasing an eponymous six-song EP in 1983 that sold 200,000 copies, Ratt released its breakthrough album, &quot;Out of the Cellar&quot;, on Atlantic Records in 1984. The band opened arena shows and tours for ZZ Top, Ozzy Osbourne and Billy Squier. &quot;Out of the Cellar&quot; went five times multi-platinum, and the band headed its own arena tours around the world for the next ten years. After releasing four multi-platinum records and three gold albums with Ratt, Pearcy left the band in 1992.
Pearcy and former Cinderella drummer Fred Coury formed the band Arcade in 1992. Arcade released a self-titled album in 1993 and another album the following year. In 1996, Pearcy dabbled in an industrial metal band called Vertex (with Megadeth&#x27;s Al Pitrelli and drummer / electronic producer Hiro Kuretani).

Pearcy reunited with Ratt in 1996, minus Robbin Crosby and Juan Croucier, only to leave the band for a second time in 2000 on the eve of a tour due to differences over the financial allocation amongst band members.

Pearcy rejoined Ratt in 2006 before leaving again on April 24, 2014, explaining he was &quot;officially done with having anything to do with them due to the constant turmoil, unresolved business, personal attacks/threats in the public forum, and most of all, the disrespect to the fans&quot;.

On November 29, 2016, Pearcy and other members of Ratt announced the upcoming Back for More Tour.

A new Ratt lineup including Jordan Ziff (lead guitars) and drummer Pete Holmes (from the band Black and Blue) performed a handful of shows in late 2018 and embarked on a world tour starting in May 2019.

In April 2020, Pearcy appeared with Ratt in a television commercial where new homeowners lament that they &quot;have a Ratt problem.&quot;

Pearcy has recorded four solo records under his own indie label Top Fuel Records. The latest, &quot;View to a Thrill&quot;, was released on Frontiers Music/Top Fuel Records in November 2018; the music from the album was written by Pearcy and guitarist Erik Ferentinos.

2024, as a guest, Pearcy is singing the song &quot;Shoot Shoot&quot; on the Michael Schenker album &quot;My Years with UFO&quot;.

==Personal life==
Pearcy is married to Kristi Adair. He has a daughter from his first marriage, born 1995.

===Health===
Pearcy underwent knee replacement surgery in 2019, three months after two Ratt shows that saw him incapacitated to the point where he had difficulty remembering the words to some of the band&#x27;s songs.

In the rockumentary &quot;Nothing to Lose: A Stephen Pearcy Rockumentary&quot; (2021), produced and directed by Kristi Adair, Pearcy confirmed that he beat his liver cancer after having had chemotherapy and an ablation procedure that removed his cancer completely. He was subsequently on a maintenance program to make certain that his cancer did not return. As of 2022, four years after having been diagnosed, he was free of cancer.

<text>Jaki Liebezeit (born Hans Liebezeit; 26 May 1938 – 22 January 2017) was a German drummer, best known as a founding member of experimental rock band Can. He was called &quot;one of the few drummers to convincingly meld the funky and the cerebral&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Hans Liebezeit was born in the village of Ostrau south of Dresden, Germany. His mother, Elisabeth, was from Lower Saxony. His father, Karl Moritz Johannes Liebezeit, was the music teacher at the village school, specialising in accordion and violin, and taught both instruments to Hans, who treasured his father&#x27;s accordion for the rest of his life. His father was forced to stop teaching music during the Nazi period, and died in mysterious circumstances on 18 August 1943.

Hans&#x27; early life was one of extreme poverty, with no running water at home, surviving on vegetables grown in the garden, and having to walk several kilometres to school daily. As the Soviets began to occupy East Germany, he became a refugee when his mother took him west to Hannoversch Münden to live with her mother and brother, just before the border closed in 1945. Hans&#x27; uncle ran a timber business, sprawling along the nearby river Weser. He built a small wooden house for Hans&#x27; family.

Hans joined school orchestra, at first, playing a trumpet. When he changed to a different school in the nearby town of Kassel, the local school orchestra already had enough trumpeters and didn&#x27;t have a drummer—Hans picked up drums. There he met and befriended trumpeter Manfred Schoof. In his teen years, Hans embraced his high school nickname—&quot;Jaki&quot;.

===Musical career===
====Free jazz====
In late 1958, Jaki moved to Cologne and enrolled at the Hochschule für Musik und Tanz Köln, encouraged by his friend Manfred Schoof. One of their teachers was Kurt Edelhagen. They shared a flat for the next three years, playing together as a loose collective of &quot;Jazz Cookers&quot; with multi-instrumentalist Gunter Hampel, saxophonist Olaf Kübler (who would later manage the krautrock group Amon Düül II), Lothar Meid (future bassist with Amon Düül II). Kübler left Cologne in 1960, and Gerd Dudek joined the Jazz Cookers to play saxophone.

While performing with the Jazz Cookers the Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers visited Cologne. According to Jaki, &quot;the band all wanted to play, except Art Blakey, so they asked him to play in his place&quot;, which Jaki did. At one of the intellectual parties in Cologne, Jaki met jazz drummer Kenny Clarke, who later became Jaki&#x27;s inspiration for using limited set of percussion equipment. He admired the works of jazz drummer Elvin Jones.

In 1963, Jaki was offered a gig as full-time drummer at the Jamboree club in Barcelona, performing there for the next seven months with pianist Tete Montoliu. At that time, the Jamboree harbored the touring musician from the United States, and Jaki had an opportunity to play shows with Chet Baker and Don Cherry. While playing at the club, Liebezeit was impressed by flamenco music and afro-Cuban jazz, recognizing its rhythms as superior to the jazz rhythms.

Schoof put together a quintet in 1965 featuring Jaki on drums, Buschi Niebergall on bass, saxophonist Gerd Dudek, and pianist Alexander von Schlippenbach. The quintet was inspired by the liberated style of jazz music played by Ornette Coleman, Albert Ayler, and John Coltrane with &quot;an additional cool hard edge&quot; from the mid-sixties Miles Davis Quintet. Schoof&#x27;s quintet played prestigious festivals at Antibes and Lugano, and performed in Prague and Warsaw. A record deal with CBS Records International led to the album &quot;Voices&quot; (1966). Schoof later claimed his quintet were &quot;the first free jazz group in Germany&quot;.

Other than &quot;Voices&quot;, Jaki can be heard on the studio recordings made by the Schoof Quintet in Munich (resurfaced in 2013), on scattered recordings of the Globe Unity Orchestra, and early Quintet tapes of Swedish drummer Sven-Åke Johansson.

Schoof had a connection with composer Irmin Schmidt, who asked Schoof&#x27;s quintet in 1966 to perform on Schmidt&#x27;s soundtrack project for West German film &quot;&quot;. The quintet also took part in a recording of &quot;Die Befristeten&quot; composed by Bernd Alois Zimmermann, which came out on a Wergo label in 1967 and accompanied &quot;Ode to Freedom in the Form of a Dance of Death&quot;, a radio production of a play by Elias Canetti.

====Motorik====
By the late sixties, Jaki felt burned out with free jazz, later saying &quot;there were too many rules in free jazz&quot; with &quot;no real
freedom in it, because it was so limited&quot; in regards to Drum pulse. He steered in the direction of pulsing rhythm, which eventually evolved into Jaki&#x27;s trademark motorik beat. In late 1967, Jaki was searching for new opportunities, and when Irmin Schmidt asked for a drummer recommendation, decided to sign up himself. Schmidt was fascinated by the rhythms mastered by Jaki, buying tickets to his shows &quot;every time Schmidt could get hold of him&quot;, but Schmidt only heard Jaki playing free jazz, which he didn&#x27;t favor. Jaki surprised Schmidt, when he turned up at the band&#x27;s rehearsal himself and played a drum beat with a routine inspired by the world music, removed from free jazz. The next year, Schmidt, Jaki, Holger Czukay, and Michael Karoli eventually formed a band, later known as Can. His drumming was prominent in the band&#x27;s sound, particularly in his much-admired contribution to the side-long &quot;Halleluhwah&quot; on &quot;Tago Mago&quot;.

Jaki contributed for Michael Rother&#x27;s late-1970s solo albums, drumming with his distinctive motorik beat.

In 1980, Jaki became a member of Phantomband, and formed drum ensembles such as Drums off Chaos and Club off Chaos. Later he recorded with numerous musicians, such as Jah Wobble and Philip Jeck, with whom he produced an album for Jah Wobble&#x27;s 30 Hertz Records, and contributed drums and percussion to many albums as a guest musician over the years, such as the Depeche Mode album &quot;Ultra&quot; and Brian Eno&#x27;s album &quot;Before and After Science&quot;. In later years, he worked with Burnt Friedman on the &quot;Secret Rhythms&quot; albums and with Schiller on the &quot;Atemlos&quot; album.

Jaki also worked on the Cyclopean EP, released on 11 February 2013 on 12&quot; and download for Mute Records. Cyclopean was a project that involved, other than Jaki, Irmin Schmidt from Can alongside long time collaborators Jono Podmore (Kumo / Metamono) and musician and producer Burnt Friedman. He recorded with Hans Joachim Irmler of Faust an album called Flut released 18 July 2014.

In 2013, he recorded the album &quot;The Obscure Department&quot; with British singer-songwriter Robert Coyne. Two more albums with Coyne, &quot;Golden Arc (2014)&quot; and &quot;I Still Have This Dream&quot; (2016), followed.

===Death===
Liebezeit died of pneumonia on 22 January 2017. A tribute concert to Liebezeit took place on 22 January 2018 at the Philharmonic Hall, Cologne.

==Personal life==
Liebezeit was married to Birgit Berger, a painter. The couple had two sons named Ben and Marlon.

==Style==
As early as 1961, Jaki got attracted to the world music, listening to North African, Indian, Turkish, and Iranian music. He admired the works of jazz drummer Elvin Jones.

Liebezeit is best known for his exceptional &quot;metronome&quot; style of playing. Other members of Can have suggested that he sounds as though he is &quot;half-man, half machine&quot;. Liebezeit described the intention behind his metronome rhythm as &quot;always pushing the band, similar to the director of an orchestra. You have to keep the orchestra together, make the musicians come to that one point where the beat is. And play like the people come together and make a unit.&quot;

Michael Karoli, Can&#x27;s guitarist, lauded the partnership between Jaki and the band&#x27;s vocalist Malcolm Mooney. ‘he was probably the most important
point of reference in the band. I’ve never heard anything like that
elsewhere. How those two fed each other with sounds!

<text>The veiled chameleon (Chamaeleo calyptratus) is a species of chameleon (family Chamaeleonidae) native to the Arabian Peninsula in Yemen and Saudi Arabia. Other common names include cone-head chameleon, Yemen chameleon, and Yemeni chameleon. They are born pastel green and without their distinctive casques on their head. 

As they mature, their casque develops along with more vibrant coloring, as well as a dramatic gular fold that will protrude from their throat and chin. They are known for their variable color changes due to a variety of factors, including to show aggression, social status, reproduction, and stress. Female lifespan is around five years while male lifespan is around eight, and they breed a few times a year.

==Etymology==
The term &#x27;veiled chameleon&#x27; refers to the species &quot;Chamaeleo calyptratus&quot;. &#x27;Veiled&#x27; describes their distinctive casque on the head, resembling a veil. This term highlights the species&#x27; unique feature. The generic term &#x27;chameleon&#x27; is derived from the Greek &#x27;χαμαιλέων&#x27; (&#x27;khamailéōn&#x27;), a compound of &#x27;χαμαί&#x27; (&#x27;khamaí&#x27;), meaning &#x27;low to the ground&#x27; and &#x27;λέων&#x27; (&#x27;léōn&#x27;), meaning &#x27;lion&#x27;, emphasizing the specie’s nature as akin to a miniature lion, highlighting its dignified and perhaps majestic demeanor, much like a lion in miniature form, staying close to the ground. The species name &#x27;calyptratus&#x27; comes from the Greek &#x27;καλύπτρα&#x27; (kalýptra), meaning &#x27;veil&#x27; or &#x27;cover&#x27;, referring to the distinctive casque or veil-like structure on their head. This casque not only serves as a significant physical characteristic but also plays a practical role in channeling dew and rainwater towards the mouth for hydration.

==Description==

The male is long from the snout to the tip of the tail. The female is shorter, no more than about , but it has a thicker body. Both sexes have a casque on the head which grows larger as the chameleon matures, reaching about in the largest adults. Newly hatched offspring are born pastel green in color and develop stripes and different colors as they mature. Adult females are green with white, orange, yellow, or tan mottling. Adult males are brighter with more defined bands of yellow or blue and some mottling.

Coloration can be affected by several factors, including social status. In experimental conditions, young veiled chameleons reared in isolation developed to be darker and duller in color compared to those raised with other individuals. Females change color over the course of their reproductive cycles. Chameleons also tend to change to a much darker color when stressed.

==Subspecies==
*&quot;Chamaeleo calyptratus calyptratus&quot; – veiled chameleon
*&quot;Chamaeleo calyptratus calcarifer&quot; – short-casqued chameleon

==Habitat and distribution==
The veiled chameleon (&quot;Chamaeleo calyptratus&quot;) is an arboreal species. It is native to the south-western Arabian Peninsula where the climate is semi-arid and tropical. It is highly susceptible to stress which makes it a species difficult to treat in captivity.

This chameleon lives in a number of habitat types in its native range, including plateaus, mountains, and valleys. Like most other chameleons, it is arboreal, living in trees and other large plants. It prefers warmer temperature, generally between .

==Diet==
The veiled chameleon is primarily insectivorous. Like other chameleons, the veiled chameleon has the ability to capture large prey but their diets mainly consist of small prey However, it is one of several chameleon species also known to consume plant matter. This is believed to perhaps be used as a source of water during the dry season.

== Behavior ==

=== Reproduction and life cycle ===
Veiled chameleons reach sexual maturity at four to five months and breed multiple times in a year. The female lays large clutches of up to 85 white, tough eggs and buries them in sand. The embryos experience a diapause, a length of time (usually 60-75 days) when they are dormant in the egg before they begin developing, increasing temperatures in the substrate initiate development.

A 2004 study found that the embryonic development of chameleons (specifically the veiled chameleon) usually initiates at fertilization and continues until hatching, but sometimes development stunts at the gastrula stage for months after the eggs have been laid. The researchers involved discovered that moisture levels have little to do with this delay, but that temperature plays a determinant role in development time; an increase in ambient temperature initiates development of diapausing embryos.

Juvenile chameleons can grow up to two orders of magnitude in body mass within a year of hatching. The feeding mechanisms (mouth, snout, tongue, jaw) all grow rapidly while still needing to be functional. Thus, the musculoskeletal system of the feeding mechanisms grow with negative allometry relative to snout-vent length (SVL). Studies on captured veiled chameleons showed that velocity of jaw movement tends to be greater in adults than juveniles. Thus in the development phase between adult and juvenile, there is a change in energy storage and tongue projection release mechanisms.

It was found that unlike many other reptiles, the sex ratios of the veiled chameleon are not affected by incubation temperature. Even with differential mortality as a factor, the sex ratio bias is negligible. Anecdotal suggestions of temperature-dependent sex ratios in the veiled chameleon were accrued from reporting and statistical errors.

Veiled chameleons have a naturally short lifespan, so even with good care, they may only live 6-8 years. Males typically live longer than females.

=== Protective coloration ===
For color changing species such as the veiled chameleon, signaling is important between animals to prevent needless energy expended on attacking competition. Stable and nonaggressive states come with a static coloration and will have a dynamic change when that state is altered. Veiled chameleons will typically brighten their coloring before approaching a rival as a signal of aggression. They will also maximize their stripe brightness for as long as possible to signal the strength of their bite. The longer and brighter the stripe lasts correlates to a stronger bite. This may aid in deterring disproportionately weaker or stronger chameleons from challenging. In this way, both contestants will save time, risk, and energy by not challenging an asymmetrical rival. It is likely that such color changing behavior serves as an evolutionary stable strategy to mutually benefit individuals by preventing unnecessary escalation. Brighter and more yellow stripes are also a signal of increased aggression.

While brighter strip coloring typically correlates to more willingness to approach an opponent, brighter head coloring signifies a higher tendency to win fights. Rapidity of color change is also telling of the success of a confrontational outcome. Veiled chameleons are one of the first species to undergo color changing studies focused on speed rather than just intensity of the color. Male veiled chameleons tend to engage in vehement intra-sexual aggressive behavior. Before engaging, males will typically engage the color change laterally from a distance to maximize the opportunity to assess the coloration. When males engage with one another, they tend to begin the confrontation head to head which offers a clear view of the vivid head color change.

All chameleons can engage in color change through a lattice of guanine nanocrystals embedded in a superficially thick layer of dermal iridophores. Veiled chameleons specifically exhibit two superposed layers of iridophores. The two layer structure may allow veiled chameleons to camouflage as well as relay behavioral signaling and may also provide thermal protection.

=== Mating ===
Males display for females during courtship, performing behaviors such as &quot;head rolls&quot; and &quot;chin rubs&quot;. Females change color when they are receptive to breeding, and males are more likely to court them during this time.

Females are receptive to mating when pale-blue (robin’s egg shade) spots appear on their dorsums. They undergo constant clutch cycles that correlate with their hormonal reproductive status.

Male courtship involves exhibiting bright colors, lateral body flattening, body swaying, and tail curling. Males will approach the females and nudge them with their chin while vibrating from an internal origin during contact. The female will then mount the male and the male uses tarsal spurs to caress the female’s flank. Copulation can last anywhere from a few minutes to an hour and can occur several times per day. When copulation is successful, females will darken their green coloration and the intensity of their yellow patterns will increase. If a female is not receptive to the male, her body will turn dark brown to black with white or yellow mottled markings. She may also become aggressive or violent and bite the male if he continues to advance unwanted.

=== Parental care ===
After mating in captivity, a female chameleon will decrease feeding three to four weeks and will spend more time at the bottom of the cage searching for an appropriate egg-laying site. Tunnels will typically reach to the bottom of the container and will be covered with substrate debris after oviposition is completed (which tends to make them difficult to find). Females may dig another tunnel and lay more eggs after about a week. Females should be given easy access between higher sites in the cage and their tunnels via a branch or something similar.

In captivity, eggs should be retrieved then placed into tupperware with a 1:1 ratio mix of vermiculite and water to a depth of about 1-1.5 inches with the eggs buried lengthwise and half covered. Eggs may absorb moisture and expand so they should be placed 0.5 to 1 inches apart from each other. Embryos have been shown to start development sooner when subjected to higher temperatures while degree of moisture showed no significant impact. Eggs should be incubated at 26 to 30 degrees Celsius at a humidity of 95%. Neonates should be allowed at least one day to roam their container before moving. Neonate nurseries should consist of a ten gallon screen top aquarium with a base one third to one half filled with decorative artificial plants. Two to six hatchlings should be raised together for the first few months then moved to adult enclosures with increased amounts of vegetation once they reach four to six inches. They can be placed individually from each other once they reach four to six months old.

==Disease==
The veiled chameleon, like many reptiles, is susceptible to ocular infections. Similar subcutaneous swellings can be associated with bacterial or fungal abscesses, parasitic infestation, and (rarely) neoplasia.

Juvenile veiled chameleons in captivity often develop nutritional metabolic bone disease but will not develop it if fed dietary supplements of Ca, vitamin A, vitamin D, and cholecalciferol as well as exposure to UVB radiation.

Veiled chameleons in captivity tend to develop maladies such as hypovitaminosis A, hypervitaminosis A, renal failure, dystocia (a failure to lay eggs), respiratory problems (usually due to improper humidity), parasitic infections, and oral cavity problems. Corneal damage can also be caused from an overabundance of UVB radiation.

Serpentoviruses are known to cause respiratory problems in snakes, and veiled chameleons have been found to display similar symptoms to this disease such as sneezing, lethargy, oral mucus secretions, depression, and poor body condition. Juveniles seem to be more impacted by the disease than other age groups, showing a faster onset of symptoms and death.

==Captivity==
The veiled chameleon is the most common chameleon species in the pet trade; this species has been kept and bred in captivity for almost thirty years. Veiled chameleons are more tolerant of captive conditions than other chameleon species, but are still challenging pets to keep healthy.

== Husbandry ==
Veiled chameleons require specific care and husbandry in order to ensure their health. It is important to note that captive veiled chameleons should never be released in the wild because they are an invasive species that can cause significant harm to a local ecosystem. It is important to be responsible when owning a veiled chameleon as a pet and to never release them in the wild. There are many local reptile rescue organizations around the world that will be able to take the veiled chameleon if the owner does not want it anymore.

It is important that veiled chameleons have a tall and spacious enclosure that provides plenty of climbing opportunities. Since veiled chameleons are arboreal, an adult veiled chameleon should have at least 2 feet by 2 feet by 4 feet in size with lots of vines to climb on . Veiled chameleon also require a basking spot with a temperature of 90–95 degrees Fahrenheit, with a cooler area of 70–80 degrees Fahrenheit. Veiled chameleons also need a full-spectrum UVB lighting. The UVB light helps metabolize calcium properly.

Veiled chameleons are insectivores and require a diet of live insects such as crickets, roaches, and mealworms. Insects should be dusted with calcium. Veiled chameleons require regular access to water for drinking and humidity. It is important to mist the enclosure several times a day to maintain a properly humidity level, and provide a dripper or other source of running water for drinking. Veiled chameleons drink using water droplets.

==Research==
Because chameleons possess anatomy that is functionalized for an arboreal habitat (such as split hands and feet for grasping, a prehensile tail, a projectile tongue, independently moving turreted eyes, and laterally compressed bodies), the veiled chameleon is becoming an up-and-coming model for the study of functional morphology and evolutionary developmental biology (ev-devo). A 2019 study assembled an annotated, multi-tissue transcriptome for the veiled chameleon to use as a resource in evolutionary and developmental research.

The veiled chameleon is currently used as an experimental model to study the evolutionary transition from reptilian amniotes to mammalian and avian species.

Squamate reptiles comprise about a third of all living amniotes (animals who lay terrestrial eggs). Most of these species are in late development stages at the time of oviposition. However, veiled chameleons are the exception. They breed readily, do not require a cooling period to induce a reproductive cycle, and females produce about 45–90 eggs multiple times a year. Thus, few animals are required to form a productive breeding colony. This makes them an excellent model organism to study developmental and evolutionary phenomena.

Young chameleons have a heterodont dentition with multi-cuspid teeth in the caudal jaw area and simple mono-cuspid teeth rostrally. Chameleon teeth are also acrodont ankylosed to the bones of the jaw. Odontoblasts produce a layer of predentin that connects the dentine to the supporting bone with both tooth and bone protruding out of the oral cavity and acting as a functional unit. This makes chameleons useful in providing information to study the molecular interaction at the tooth-bone interface in physiological and pathological conditions.

==Invasive species==
This chameleon is an introduced species in Hawaii, where it is invasive to the local ecosystem. There is a breeding population established on Maui. It can also be found in the wild in Florida, where escaped pets have established populations. 

Since veiled chameleons are becoming an invasive species, they are affecting many native species in Hawaii. This chameleon mainly attacks native Hawaiian insects such as the koa looper moth and the cabbage tree emperor moth. These chameleons are also eating native plants as well such as lehua, koa, and hala. These chameleons are also eating small lizards such as the mourning gecko and the gold dust day gecko . 

Veiled chameleons are able to lay 30–95 eggs and they are able to lay these eggs three times a year thus making it very fast for them to reproduce. These eggs only take six months to hatch. Veiled chameleons can live up to 4–8 years. 

They are becoming a major concern due to their ability to reproduce fast, and their ability to prey upon native Hawaiian birds, and insects. Since veiled chameleons are able to adapt pretty well since they are able to tolerate living areas that can range from dry sea level elevation to wet montane areas up to 12,000 feet elevation. 

Efforts are being made to control the population of veiled chameleons in Hawaii. One approach is to capture and remove the chameleons from the wild, mainly in areas that have established breeding populations. There are also educational programs to discourage the release of non-native species in the wild.

The introduction of veiled chameleons in Hawaii has a negative impact on Hawaii&#x27;s ecosystem. Since the veiled chameleons are generalist predators, compete with native species, and breed rapidly which can lead to overpopulation. Effective measures are necessary in order to control the overpopulation of veiled chameleons. 

In 1992, under Title 4, Chapter 71, Section 13.5 of the Hawaii Administrative rules it was made illegal to import, possess, or transport, veiled chameleons without a permit. This law helps the Hawaii Department of Agriculture regulate the further introduction of invasive species. The importation and possession of veiled chameleon can have negative impacts on Hawaii&#x27;s ecosystem and biodiversity. Enforcement of this regulation helps protect Hawaii&#x27;s natural resources, preserve the unique cultural, and ecological heritage of the islands. There are penalties for violation this regulation. Penalties can include fines, imprisonment, and the confiscation and removal of the prohibited species.

== Adaptations ==

There are many adaptations of veiled chameleons. Veiled chameleons are known for their ability to change their color to blend in with their surroundings. They are able to change their color in response to their environment, mood, and temperature. They turn black/grey when they are upset. Veiled chameleons camouflage in order to avoid predators and hunt prey more effectively. 

Veiled chameleons also have a prehensile tail. Their tail allows them to grip and hold onto branches and other surfaces. This adaptation benefits veiled chameleons are they are able to move more easily through their arboreal habitat and avoid falls. 

Veiled chameleons have a long sticky tongue that is twice the length of their body. This adaptation allows them to catch insects from a distance. Veiled chameleons also have turret eyes . Their eyes move independently of each other. Their eyes also allow veiled chameleons to see a 360 degree view of their environment. This allows them to see potential threats more effectively.

Veiled chameleons also have zygodactylous feet. This means that their toes are arranged in two opposing groups of two. This allows them to grasp onto branches with a strong grip, providing them with stability as they move through their arboreal habitat. Veiled chameleons also have a hooded head. Their hooded head helps chameleons collect water. When a droplet collection is on top of a chameleon&#x27;s hood, the droplet slides down from the hood into the chameleon&#x27;s mouth. Veiled chameleon&#x27;s hood also aids in reproduction. Males have a pointer hood than females. Males would fight with each other with their hood when trying to mate with a female. A male chameleon with a large hood is preferred by females as they look more intimidating. This sexual selection is passed off to their offspring in order to ensure the genes of a large hooded skull is passed on. 

==Culture==
The earliest known description of a chameleon was written by Aristotle.

The town of Dagami, Leyte celebrates its feast every 27 May, to honor the town&#x27;s patron, Saint Joseph. They also celebrate this along with their festival, the Dinagamihan Festival

==Etymology==
When the Spanish conquistadors arrived in Leyte in 1521, trade mostly took place in the villages bordering the sea, where Dagilan was located. Locals indicate the name &quot;Dagami&quot; first arose during a confrontation between a group of Spaniards and a group of farmers during the Spanish colonial period:

==History==

According to legend, the island of Leyte was once divided into kingdoms or sultanates:

:The most powerful sultanate in the island was Dagaran, the sultanate ruled by Diwaranda Mohammed. He had daughter named Sayajamburan who was sought by men everywhere. The nearby kingdoms were Bumbaran and Kahagna, sultanates of King Mapandara and King Mabanig, respectively. King Mapandara had a son named Bantugan who was the commander of his father&#x27;s army and was sought after by many women because of his strength and good looks. Sayajamaburan was secretly enamored by Bantugan&#x27;s physical and intellectual prowess. Bantugan has asked of her hand but was refused although he knew he had hopes of winning her in the end. The ruler of Kahagna, King Mabanig, was also a close rival of Bantugan. He was wealthy and got along well with everyone. When Sayajamaburan&#x27;s father was dying, he chose Bantugan as his daughter&#x27;s husband. Two days before the scheduled wedding, there was rejoicing everywhere except for King Mabanig who declared war against Bantugan&#x27;s kingdom. Bantugan came out victorious and the wedding took place. Bumbaran, Dagaran and Kahagna then became one by affinity and conquest. The fusion of the three kingdoms made Dagara more powerful and respected.

In 1478, two hundred years after the three sultanates unite into one kingdom, changes took place. Its capital, Dagilan, increased in population. The culture and social life of the kingdom further evolved with the entry of the Chinese and the Hindus. The people engaged in trade both with Asia and Europe.

When the Spanish conquistadors arrived in Leyte in 1521, trade mostly took place in the villages bordering the sea, where Dagilan was located.

From 1902 to 1907 the Pulahanes challenged the American authorities in Leyte, led by Faustino Ablen (&quot;Papa Faustino&quot;), an illiterate peasant who assumed the title of pope. Ablen claimed to have supernatural powers and sold anting-anting that would render one invisible to the enemy and holy oil that could cure any ailment. In some battles, the Pulahanes managed to deploy five hundred to one thousand men. The government was so alarmed that it offered a 2000 peso reward for Papa Faustino, dead or alive. US Major General Leonard Wood sent four battalions of the US Army to Leyte to crush the rebellion. On June 11, 1907, a detachment of Philippine Scouts chanced upon four Pulahan fighters and opened fire. Three men escaped, but one was captured. He was Papa Faustino. With his capture, the rebellion in Leyte came to an end.

During the second World War, Dagami became one of the major battlegrounds between American and Japanese forces. Its mountain ranges served as cover for the Japanese between their base in Ormoc City as the American forces were advancing during liberation. Hilabago became a major Japanese army base. The U.S. military built an access road to the upland mountain but with traces still visible today.

===Division into new towns===
Dagami became the provincial capital of Leyte when the administration transferred to the interior lands after Dulag was ransacked and burned down by the Moro pirates which were constantly pillaging coastal towns and villages on Philippine islands. Around this time, the capital of the Spanish colonial government was still in Cebu.

Clerico-military was the existing type of government that the Spaniards had imposed during the early period of colonization in the Philippines, with the church providing leadership among local people while the military providing the security aspects on securing the islands.

When the Jesuits mission first landed in the Philippines, they were assigned to evangelize the island of Leyte and Samar and were allowed to establish their first rectory in Dagami.

As early as 1613, the Jesuits mission established its rectory in what is now the Saint Joseph complex beside the municipal hall complex. This made the town a &quot;cabicera&quot; or the equivalent of provincial capital since around that period Palo and Tacloban were not existing yet.
When the Jesuits were expelled in all dominions of the Spanish crown including the Philippines, the Augustinian mission which succeeded them transferred and established their mission in Palo and declared it as a town in 1768.

In 1783, Burauen was carved out from the barrios of Dagami to become a separate town. Burauen used to be a missionary church under the diocese of Dagami.

In 1883, the town of Pastrana was carved out from the barrios of Dagami. Years later, it reverted as part of Dagami in 1893 until it was finally settled as a separate municipality in 1912.

In 1953, barangay Tabontabon together with other barangays of Dagami and Tanauan, were incorporated to constitute a new town of Tabontabon.

In 1957, the barrios of Capahu-an and Guingawan were transferred to the newly founded town of Tabontabon, which used to be a barangay of Dagami. 

==Geography==
Dagami is bounded by Binahaan River across the municipality of Jaro on the northwest and the municipality of Pastrana, on the northeast. The municipality of Palo borders in the east while the municipality of Tanauan borders on the southeast. It is bounded in the south by the municipality of Tabontabon.

In the west, it borders with the municipality of
Burauen and
Albuera.

Over the mountain range on Dagami&#x27;s western upland part, it borders with Ormoc City on the northwest.

The town is located from the provincial capital, Tacloban City.

==Demographics==
In the 2020 census, the population of Dagami, Leyte, was 36,178 people, with a density of .

The people of Dagami speak Waray, a native language of Leyte and Samar. Waray is closely related to other Visayan languages particularly Hiligaynon and to a lesser extent Cebuano which is spoken by people of greater geographic proximity mainly in western municipalities of Leyte and of entire Southern Leyte.
== Economy ==

Rice and coconut production is the primary economic source of income for the townsfolk. Aside from farming, food processing is another source of income for the town of Dagami. Recently, an upsurge in labor export (OFWs) have contributed to remittances of income from abroad. Commercial businesses are limited to retailing while trading activities are limited to rice and copra trading.

Despite popularity of its indigenous food product - the Binagol, Dagami has yet to maximize its economic potentials, such as creation of labor during its production line, income to be generated from sales, and revenue for the local government in terms of income taxes.

Chief economic products of the municipality are the following:
* Copra - Production of copra - a by-product of coconut tree fruit is the main industry of the townfolks. The growth of local economy is highly dependent on copra production due to price fluctuation in the market of its by-products such as oil, dissicated coconuts, and other raw materials made from leaves, bark, and the coconut fruit itself.
* Rice - Rice farming is the second source of livelihood for the people of Dagami. Almost half of the land area is planted with different variety of rice stocks. It is likewise the second most traded product in the town next to copra.
* Binagol - The town of Dagami is known for its local delicacy, the &quot;Binagol&quot; - a sweet, glutinous mixture of cassava, legume crop and other ingredients cooked with filling made of sugar, coconut and milk placed in a coconut shell or &quot;bagul&quot; and wrapped with banana leaves. Dagami also has other local delicacies such as &quot;Sagmani&quot;, and &quot;Moron&quot;. The &quot;binagol&quot; is sold in the city market primarily in Tacloban City while some reach the international markets.
* Tuba - Tuba is a well-known drink to Leyteños. Aside from copra production, the gathering of this product from coconut sap is another source of livelihood for Dagami-ons. &quot;Tuba&quot; is then traded in the market by local entrepreneurs but often sold directly by the gatherers.

===Finance===
Dagami&#x27;s total Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) for fiscal year 2009 is P49,212,979, placing the town at no. 17 among the 41 towns of Leyte. From year 2003 to 2009 alone, Dagami has generated P249,089,980 for the municipal government. This is on top of local revenue sources which are the business and real property taxes including levies, fees and other charges. 


==Tourism==

; Rivers

The town of Dagami is traversed by many rivers and streams upland. The biggest river is Panda River which cuts across the town&#x27;s north-east section. Sawahon River is among its tributaries which is also joined up stream by its major tributaries such as Hilabago River, Kababatuan Dako (Greater Stones) River and Kababatuan Guti (Smaller Stones) River.

During the rainy season, when these rivers rise, the downtown or Poblacion is flooded causing damages to property. A river dike which is also a diversion road was built to protect the town center. But as the river rises higher than the dike, it overflows causing more water to flood the town center.

; Mountains

The majestic Mount Amandiwing located near Dagami is the highest peak in Leyte. The imposing mountain is a protected natural park where wildlife such as pigs, deer and monkeys are hunted by local hunters despite by a local ban. During the 1960s, a logging concession was permitted to cut its virgin forests but the concessionaire never replanted trees. Locals exploited the situation by farming the logged area and creating coconut plantations.

The mountain is best viewed from the town proper. On approach to the town proper, the mountain is an imposing majestic hill where smokes billow from different parts like chimneys. Up in the mountain near its peak, one could see the vast Pacific Ocean.

== Government ==


The incumbent Municipal Mayor of Dagami is Abundio I. Delusa, popularly known to Dagamin-ons as &quot;DEO&quot;. Delusa was first elected as Dagami&#x27;s Boholano mayor in May 2013, defeating &quot;Koko Ortega&quot;.

===List of former chief executives===

 At this time, after the People Power Revolution, President Corazon Aquino forced the resignation of all local government unit heads and appointed officers in charge in their place.

===Municipal seal===
The Dagami Municipal Seal represents the town&#x27;s humble achievements. The center of the seal shows the town&#x27;s Municipal Hall &quot;(above)&quot;, the seat of Dagami&#x27;s local government. Its upper left side features the St. Joseph Parish of Dagami and the other side shows a faucet that represents Dagami as the source of fresh water of the Leyte Metropolitan Water District (LMWD), the local distributor of fresh water in the 1st District Leyte, namely where the capital of the Province is, Tacloban City. The lower part of the Seal on the left side symbolizes the Municipality&#x27;s dependency on agriculture, and the other side features the local delicaicies of the town, especially the &quot;Binagol&quot; or sometimes known as &quot;Lidguid&quot;. The major colors of the seal are green and yellow, the colours of the St. Joseph Parish, where the statue of the town&#x27;s Patron Saint, Saint Joseph is enshrined and beautifully presented in a wooden and hand-decorated altar.

== Education ==
Local townfolks recognize the importance of education, hence local leaders are working very hard to provide the people access to education as most prominent higher educational institutions in Leyte are in the provincial capital, Tacloban City, Tabontabon, and Tanauan. When the town became the capital of the Jesuits, the friars established a school which still stands today.

;Primary Schools
Almost all barangays in the town have primary and intermediate schools. The five major elementary schools are Dagami North Central School, Dagami South Central School, both situated just a few meters apart in the town proper, Patoc Elementary School in the north, Guinarona Elementary School in the West and Balilit Elementary School in the south.

;Secondary Schools
The town has eight secondary schools in different locations within the town; seven public high schools and one private high school run by a local parish.

Of the eight secondary schools, three are senior high schools and five are junior high schools.

The senior high schools are Patoc Senior High School, Guinarona Senior High School and Sta. Mesa Senior High School.

Patoc is the only village with separate campuses for elementary, junior high school and senior high school, all within its administrative jurisdiction. Barangay Patoc is now distinguished as the only barangay government unit within the municipality of Dagami having three separate campuses for basic education.

Patoc National High School used to be integrated within the campus of Patoc Elementary School until it established its own campus beginning in 1986. With the implementation of K-12 reform for basic education, a separate campus for senior high school program was established in another location.

The newest secondary high school to open is Cansamada National High School in Barangay Cansamada East which is the southernmost village of the town.

The lone private, Catholic-run high school is Saint Joseph High School located in the town center. It is one of the oldest schools in the Philippines established by the Jesuits in the 1600s when they first established their rectory in the town upon landing in Philippine islands during the early century of Spain&#x27;s conquest of the Philippines.

A tertiary training institute in Patoc was attempted but was short-lived due to lack of funding as it was run privately by the local parish. The
Huron Institute which opened as a vocational training center assisted by the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority or TESDA, closed down after a couple of years in operation with some of its graduates gainly employed afterwards.

<text>Michael Karoli (29 April 1948 – 17 November 2001) was a German guitarist, violinist, and sound-mixer. He was a founding member of the krautrock band Can.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Michael Karoli was born 29 April 1948 in Straubing, Bavaria, to Susanne and . The year of his birth, Hermann &quot;had just been freed after testifying in the Nuremberg Trials&quot; and Pohl trial. Hermann had been a member of the Waffen-SS and fought on the Eastern Front during the WWII. After Herman got shot in his lung, he was moved back to Berlin, where he headed the audit department of the Berlin administrative centre until the end of the war. In 1943, Hermann married Susanne who had worked as a film editor. After the trials, Hermann and his brother Richard established an accounting company based in Essen, and in 1971 &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; magazine called Karoli one of the &quot;most influential consultants to West German companies&quot;.

Growing up, Michael Karoli learned banjo, violin, cello, and electric guitar. Karoli familiarized himself with a wide range of music from classical and Romani music to swing and blues. While attending board school in St Gallen, Switzerland, he started a band with his school friends playing modern jazz, and by the mid-sixties switched to rock, pop, and soul music emerging from Britain and US.

In 1966, Karoli befriended his guitar teacher Holger Czukay, introducing Czukay to the contemporary rock music of The Beatles, Velvet Underground, and Frank Zappa. They played with rock pianist Tony Ashton and several members of his band, Remo Four, proposing him an idea to form an experimental band, but didn&#x27;t followed through. When Michael was finishing school, Czukay was fired from the Institut auf dem Rosenberg, as Czukay explained, &quot;for being too … er … intriguing!&quot;

===Career===
In late Autumn 1967, as Michael began studying for a law degree in Lausanne, Czukay got the letter from his ex-classmate Irmin Schmidt, inviting him to visit Cologne and join his band. Czukay brought Karoli with him and formed Can. According to Schmidt, Karoli &quot;had to fight with his family, doubting his career choice. Schmidt and Holger talked to Hermann Karoli and convinced him that &quot;it was really something serious.&quot; Hermann &quot;reluctantly gave in&quot;. When Can debuted their first album, &quot;Monster Movie&quot;, Hermann told the band he liked the song &quot;Father Cannot Yell&quot;, and Schmidt said Hermann was &quot;very convinced that they had a marvellous group&quot;.

While playing with Can, Karoli mostly performed on guitar and violin, occasionally picking up bağlama, bass, and various non western instruments. After vocalist Damo Suzuki left Can in late 1973, Karoli became the band&#x27;s main vocalist. In the years following the Can&#x27;s split, Karoli joined the band for its three reunions, in 1986, 1991, and 1999. Karoli continued working with the ex-members of Can, appearing on albums made by Irmin Schmidt and Holger Czukay. 

Soon after the release of Can&#x27;s 1976 album &quot;Flow Motion&quot;, Karoli and his girlfriend Shirley set out on a trip to central and east Africa for a couple of weeks, traveling through the Congo, Zaïre, and Kenya&quot;. In 1997, Karoli told a journalist: &quot;When you visit a nightclub in Africa where a good highlife band is playing, you feel like a carrot chucked into a boiling soup. You have to move… that influence was inevitable on &quot;Saw Delight&quot;&quot;. Karoli&#x27;s bandmate, Rosko Gee, confirmed that &quot;Michael&#x27;s style of playing may have changed after his trip&quot;, and thought Michael became a better guitar player, comparing the aftermath of his trip to the revelation that hit George Harrison after his trip to India.

After leaving Can, Karoli invested in property in southern France, buying a former olive oil mill near Nice and establishing his own recording studio at home, calling it &quot;The Outer Space Recording Studio&quot;. Karoli developed the atmospheric &quot;Microsonic&quot; recording technique, and collaborated with vocalist Polly Eltes, for the next three years irregularly working in his studio and coming up with album &quot;Deluge&quot;. The album was mastered by Holger Czukay and released by Spoon Records in 1984. Rob Young, Can&#x27;s biographer, described &quot;Deluge&quot; as post-punk and reggae. Outside of &quot;Deluge&quot;, Karoli recorded several other albums in the Outer Space studio: Neue Deutsche Welle group called The Bit, Irmin Schmidt&#x27;s Rote Erde soundtrack, Belgian Asociality&#x27;s album, and 1989 Can album &quot;Rite Time&quot;.

Between 1981 and 1986, Karoli has been studying African rhythm and dance with the drummer Seni Camara.

In 1999, Karoli participated in CAN Solo Projects concerts with his group SOFORTKONTAKT, named after a late-night TV ad for a sex hotline. The group consisted of Michael Karoli, Felix Gutierrez, and Alexander Schoenert.

== Family ==
Karoli dated Eveline Grunwald from 1971 to 1976, meeting her when Can played at a Hannover nightclub, where she was working behind the bar, and moved to Cologne to be with Michael. Eveline &quot;kept close ties to the Can family&quot;, befriending Hildegard and Irmin Schmidt, and often looking after their young daughter while the parents were on tour. Eveline &quot;rarely went on tour with Can, and was determined to pursue her own career&quot;, studying to be an illustrator. Around 1976, Karoli met Shirley Argwings-Kodhek, a British woman who had been brought up in Kenya and introduced to Can by Peter Gilmour. Gilmore met her by chance on one of his trips to Cologne, saying: &quot;We took the same ferry and train, and I got talking to her and we started seeing each other, and then Micky sort of admired her from afar, I think. He eventually asked me for permission to … I mean, it was only a casual relationship I had with Shirley. That&#x27;s the way things were in those days.&quot; Rob Young, Can&#x27;s biographer, described Michael as &quot;never the most faithful partner&quot;, and Grunwald said: &quot;Micky was the womaniser. He would swear his love to me, but I think when I wasn&#x27;t there… This is how Shirley came into the whole thing&quot;.

Karoli married Shirley Argwings-Kodhek on September 15, 1981, in Essen. Shirley participated in the recording of the last Can album, &quot;Rite Time&quot;, contributing as a background vocalist. They had two daughters: Tamara Karoli, born in April 1989, and Angie, born in May 1992. Tamara has been working in photography.

Karoli&#x27;s sister Constanze Karoli and his then-girlfriend Eveline Grunwald are the models featured on the cover of Roxy Music&#x27;s 1974 album &quot;Country Life&quot;.

==Death==
Karoli died from an undisclosed form of cancer in 2001 in Essen, Germany, aged 53. Before his death, Karoli scheduled an &quot;informal recording session&quot; in Dortmund with drummer Thomas Hopf and electronic musician Mark Spybey.

<text>The blue-winged goose (Cyanochen cyanoptera) is a waterfowl species which is endemic to Ethiopia. It is the only member of the genus Cyanochen.

== Relations ==


The relations of this species among the waterfowl is unresolved. It is morphologically close to shelducks, and particularly the South American sheldgeese, which have highly similar courtship displays. However, mitochondrial DNA sequence analyses of the cytochrome &quot;b&quot; and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 genes indicates that it might belong to a very distinct and ancient &quot;duck&quot; clade, together with Hartlaub&#x27;s duck, another African species of uncertain affinities. The wing color pattern, a good morphological indicator of evolutionary relationships in waterfowl, is similar in these two species, and very different from any other waterfowl.

== Description ==
This is a stocky grey-brown bird about long with a slightly paler head and upper neck. It has a small black bill and black legs. A chunky mid-sized goose. Standing bird looks fairly dull, gray and dirty white, sometimes showing blue along the edge of the wing. In flight, this species shows a pale blue forewing. Sexes are similar, but immature birds are duller. The plumage of these birds is thick and loose, furlike as an adaptation to the cold of the Ethiopian highlands.

=== Voice ===
The blue-winged goose is a quiet species, but both sexes may give a soft whistle; it does not honk or cackle like the true geese.

== Habitat ==
The habitats of the blue-winged goose are primarily rivers, freshwater lakes, swamps, freshwater marshes, water storage areas, and subtropical or tropical high-altitude shrubland or grassland.

== Behaviour ==
It feeds by grazing, and is apparently largely nocturnal, loafing during the day. It can swim and fly well, but this terrestrial bird is reluctant to do either, and is quite approachable. It forms flocks outside the breeding season.

It breeds by mountain lakes and streams. This little-known species is believed to build a lined nest amongst grass tussocks, and to lay 6–7 eggs.

== Status ==
It is threatened by habitat loss, trapping for food and possibly drought. It is classified as a Near Threatened species on the IUCN Red List.

<text>The Road to El Dorado is a 2000 animated musical adventure comedy film directed by Eric &quot;Bibo&quot; Bergeron and Don Paul, from a screenplay by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, as well as additional sequences directed by Will Finn and David Silverman. Starring the voices of Kevin Kline, Kenneth Branagh, Rosie Perez, Armand Assante, and Edward James Olmos, the film follows two con artists who, after winning the map to El Dorado in Spain, wash ashore in the New World. The map leads the two men to the city of El Dorado, where its inhabitants mistake them for gods.

The soundtrack features an instrumental score composed by Hans Zimmer and John Powell, and songs written by Elton John and Tim Rice. Elton John also periodically narrates the story in song throughout the film. Produced by DreamWorks Animation and released by DreamWorks Pictures, it was the third animated feature produced by the studio.

&quot;The Road to El Dorado&quot; was theatrically released in the United States on March 31, 2000, received mixed reviews from critics and performed poorly at the box office, grossing $76 million worldwide on a production budget of about $95 million. Zimmer&#x27;s work on the score, however, received praise and earned him the Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Score alongside his work on &quot;Gladiator&quot; at the 6th Critics&#x27; Choice Awards. Despite its initial reception, reevaluation in later years has resulted in &quot;The Road to El Dorado&quot; becoming a cult classic.

==Plot==

In 1519 Spain, con-artists Miguel and Tulio win a map to the legendary City of Gold, El Dorado, in a rigged dice gamble (though they win the map fairly after Tulio was given normal dice from one of the opponents). After their con is exposed, the two evade the guards and accidentally stow away on one of the ships to be led by conquistador Hernán Cortés for the New World. At sea, they are caught and imprisoned and are condemned to slavery in Cuba, but they break free and steal a rowboat with the help of Cortés&#x27; mistreated horse, Altivo.

Their boat reaches land, where Miguel begins to recognize landmarks from the map, leading them to a totem marker near a waterfall that Tulio believes is a dead end. As they prepare to leave, they encounter a native woman, Chel, being chased by guards. When the guards see Tulio and Miguel riding Altivo as depicted on the totem, they escort them and Chel to a secret entrance behind the falls into El Dorado. They are brought to the city&#x27;s elders, kindhearted Chief Tannabok, and wicked high priest Tzekel-Kan. The pair are mistaken for the twin gods when a volcano coincidentally erupts but simultaneously stops during an argument between them and they are given luxurious quarters, along with the charge of Chel. She discovers that the two are conning her people but promises to remain quiet if they take her with them when they leave the city. The two are showered with gifts of gold from Tannabok but disapprove of Tzekel-Kan attempting to sacrifice a civilian at the gods&#x27; ritual. Meanwhile, Cortés and his men reach land.

Tulio and Miguel instruct Tannabok to build them a boat so that they can leave the city with all the gifts they have been given, under the ruse that they are needed back in the &#x27;other world.&#x27; Chel gets romantically close to Tulio while Miguel explores the city, coming to appreciate the peaceful life embraced by the citizens; when Tzekel-Kan sees Miguel playing a ball game with children, he insists the &quot;gods&quot; demonstrate their powers against the city&#x27;s best players. Tulio and Miguel are outmatched, but Chel replaces the ball with an armadillo, allowing them to win. Miguel spares the ritual of sacrificing the losing team, berates Tzekel-Kan to the crowd&#x27;s approval, and earns Tannabok&#x27;s respect. Tzekel-Kan notices Miguel received a cut during the game and realizes the pair are not gods since gods do not bleed, hence the reason for the sacrifices. Afterward, Miguel, who has reconsidered leaving the city, overhears Tulio telling Chel that he would like her to come with them to Spain before adding he would like her to come with specifically him and to forget Miguel – straining the relationship between the two. At a party being thrown for them, Miguel and Tulio begin to argue about Tulio and Chel&#x27;s conversation and Miguel&#x27;s desire to stay when Tzekel-Kan animates a giant stone jaguar to chase them throughout the city. Tulio and Miguel manage to outwit the jaguar, causing it and Tzekel-Kan to fall into a giant whirlpool, thought by the natives to be the entrance to Xibalba, the spirit world. Tzekel-Kan then surfaces in the jungle, where he encounters Cortés and his men. Believing Cortés to be the real god, Tzekel-Kan offers to lead him to El Dorado.

Miguel decides to stay in the city while Tulio and Chel board the completed boat, before they see smoke on the horizon and realize Cortés is approaching. Suspecting the city will be destroyed if Cortés discovers it, Tulio suggests using the boat to ram the rock pillars under the waterfall and block the main entrance to the city, despite knowing they will lose the gold in the process and the warriors will not last against them. The plan succeeds with the citizens pulling over a statue in the boat&#x27;s wake to give it enough speed. As the statue starts to fall too quickly, Tulio has difficulty preparing the boat&#x27;s sail. Selflessly sacrificing the chance to stay in the city, Miguel and Altivo jump onto the boat to unfurl the sails, assuring the boat clears the statue in time. The group successfully crashes against the pillars, causing a cave-in, while losing all their gifts in the process. They hide near the totem just as Cortés&#x27; men and Tzekel-Kan arrive. When they find the entrance blocked, Cortés brands Tzekel-Kan a liar and leaves, taking him as a slave. Tulio and Miguel, though disappointed they lost the gold (unaware that Altivo still wears the golden horseshoes with which he was outfitted in El Dorado), know that El Dorado is forever safe. They appreciate the thrill of their adventure and head in a different direction for a new adventure with Chel.

==Voice cast==
* Kevin Kline as Tulio, a con artist and Miguel&#x27;s friend. He is the strategic planner, often becoming anxious and overthinking things.
* Kenneth Branagh as Miguel, a con artist and Tulio&#x27;s friend. Miguel is more relaxed and laid-back in contrast to Tulio&#x27;s more frantic nature. Miguel becomes accustomed to the peaceful life in El Dorado and values the city&#x27;s people as opposed to the gold.
* Rosie Perez as Chel, a beautiful woman from El Dorado who discovers Tulio and Miguel&#x27;s con and decides to play along in hopes of escaping El Dorado with them for a life of adventure.
* Armand Assante as Tzekel-Kan, the fanatically vicious high priest who has a religious fixation for human sacrifices. He initially believes Tulio and Miguel are gods until he discovers the truth.
* Edward James Olmos as Chief Tannabok, the chief of El Dorado who was very skeptical of Tulio and Miguel being gods, but treats them with kindness and hospitality because of the good they show to his people.
* Jim Cummings as Hernán Cortés, the merciless and ambitious conquistador leader of the expedition to find gold from the empires of the New World.
** Cummings also voices the cook on Cortés&#x27;s ship, a warrior who gets stepped on by Tzekel-Kan&#x27;s stone jaguar, and the native who warns Chief Tannabok about Cortés.

==Production==
===Development===
Shortly before the public announcement of DreamWorks SKG in October 1994, former Disney chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg met with screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio and gave them a copy of Hugh Thomas&#x27;s book &quot;Conquest: Montezuma, Cortés and the Fall of Old Mexico&quot;, desiring to make an animated film set in the Age of Discovery. By the spring of 1995, Elliott and Rossio devised a story treatment inspired by the Bob Hope and Bing Crosby &quot;Road to...&quot; films with self-interested, comedic anti-heroes who would set out to find the Lost City of Gold after acquiring a map to its location. Will Finn and David Silverman were originally the film&#x27;s directors with a tentative release scheduled for fall 1999. Originally, the story was conceived as a dramatic film due to Katzenberg&#x27;s penchant for large-scale animated films, which conflicted with the film&#x27;s lighthearted elements. This version of the story had Miguel initially conceived as a raunchy Sancho Panza-like character who died, but came back to life so much that the natives assumed he was a god, as well as steamier love sequences and scanty clothing designed for Chel. Elliott compared their script to the 1999 war comedy &quot;Three Kings&quot;, in which the ending dealt with the destruction of the Aztec Empire from Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés.

However, while &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; was in production, Katzenberg decided that their next animated project should be a departure from its serious, adult approach, and desired for the film to be an adventure comedy. Because of this, the film was put on hold, where it was jokingly referred to as &quot;El Dorado: The Lost City on Hold&quot; due to several rewrites. Miguel and Tulio were rewritten as petty swindlers, and the setting of the film was changed to a more luscious paradise. Additionally, the romance was toned down, and new clothing was designed for Chel. Producer Bonnie Radford explained, &quot;We originally thought it would be rated PG-13 and so we skewed it to that group... But then we thought we could not exclude the younger kids so we had to tone the romance down.&quot; Finn and Silverman left the project in 1998 following disputes over the film&#x27;s creative direction, and were replaced by Eric &quot;Bibo&quot; Bergeron and Don Paul. Katzenberg reportedly co-directed the film albeit uncredited.

===Casting===
On August 15, 1998, Kevin Kline, Kenneth Branagh, and Rosie Perez had signed onto the film. Because the characters and film drew from the Bob Hope and Bing Crosby &quot;Road to ...&quot; films, producer Bonne Radford remarked that &quot;[t]he buddy relationship [between the duo] is the very heart of the story. They need each other because they&#x27;re both pretty inept. They&#x27;re opposites — Tulio is the schemer and Miguel is the dreamer. Their camaraderie adds to the adventure; you almost don&#x27;t need to know where they&#x27;re going or what they&#x27;re after, because the fun is in the journey.&quot; Unusual for an animated film, Kline and Branagh recorded their lines in the same studio room together, in order for the two to achieve more realistic chemistry. This resulted in a good deal of improvised dialogue, some of which ended up in the film.

===Animation===
Early into production, a team of designers, animators, producers, and Katzenberg embarked on research trips to Mexico where they studied ancient Mayan cities of Tulum, Chichen Itza, and Uxmal in hopes of making the film&#x27;s architecture look authentic. By January 1997, 100 animators were assigned to the project. However, because the animation department was occupied with &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;, the studio devoted more animators and resources on that film than on &quot;Road to El Dorado&quot;. Additional fine line animation was outsourced to Stardust Pictures in London and Bardel Entertainment in Vancouver. The creation sequence in the film, possibly the opening number by Elton John, was provided with traditional animation and CGI provided by Pacific Data Images.

==Music==

Marylata Jacob, who started DreamWorks&#x27; music department in 1995, became the film&#x27;s music supervisor before the script was completed. Consulting with Katzenberg, Jacob decided the musical approach to the film would be world music. In 1996, Tim Rice and Elton John were asked to compose seven songs which they immediately worked on. Their musical process began with Rice first writing the song lyrics and giving them to John to compose the music. John then recorded a demo which was given to the animators who storyboarded to the demo as the tempo and vocals would remain intact.

Eventually, the filmmakers decided not to follow the traditional musical approach by having the characters sing. Co-producer Bonne Radford explained, &quot;We were trying to break free of that pattern that had been kind of adhered to in animation and really put a song where we thought it would be great... and get us through some story points.&quot; On February 20, 1999, before the release of &quot;Elton John and Tim Rice&#x27;s Aida&quot;, it was announced that ten songs had been composed for &quot;El Dorado&quot;, and the film&#x27;s release date had been pushed to March 2000.

The instrumental score was composed by Hans Zimmer and John Powell. John, Rice, and Zimmer had previously collaborated on the soundtrack to Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Lion King&quot;, another animated film. Zimmer had also previously composed the instrumental score to DreamWorks Animation&#x27;s previous film &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;.

In some instances (such as &quot;The Trail We Blaze&quot;), the songs have been altered musically and vocally from the way they appeared in the film. A &quot;Cast &amp; Crew Special Edition&quot; recording of the soundtrack exists, but was a promo-only release. It includes the theatrical versions of the songs, including &quot;It&#x27;s Tough to Be a God&quot; recorded by Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh (performed on the soundtrack by Elton John and Randy Newman), and several of the score tracks by Hans Zimmer. The Backstreet Boys provided uncredited backing vocals on &quot;Friends Never Say Goodbye&quot;, the group is &quot;thanked&quot; by John following the credits in the CD booklet. The Eagles members Don Henley and Timothy B. Schmit are credited as background vocalists on the song &quot;Without Question&quot;.

A Best Buy exclusive included a limited edition bonus CD with two additional songs, &quot;Perfect Love&quot; and &quot;Hey, Armadillo&quot;.

==Release==

===Marketing===
The film was first revealed in a double trailer with Aardman Animations&#x27; animated feature &quot;Chicken Run&quot; on the home video release of &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;. It was accompanied by a promotional campaign by Burger King.

===Home media===
&quot;The Road to El Dorado&quot; was released on DVD and VHS on December 12, 2000. There was also an event held in El Dorado, Kansas in which a parade was held and the streets were painted gold in celebration of the film&#x27;s home video release. The DVD release includes an audio commentary, behind-the-scenes featurettes, music video of &quot;Someday Out of the Blue&quot;, production notes, interactive games, trailers and television spots.

In July 2014, the film&#x27;s distribution rights were purchased by DreamWorks Animation from Paramount Pictures (owners of the pre-2005 DreamWorks Pictures catalog) and transferred to 20th Century Fox before reverting to Universal Pictures in 2018. Because of this, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment subsequently released the film on Blu-ray on January 22, 2019.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 50% based on 107 reviews and an average rating of 5.50/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Predictable story and thin characters made the movie flat.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 51 out of 100 based on 29 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Reviewing for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Michael Wilmington summarized: &quot;This movie is fun to watch in ways that most recent cartoons aren&#x27;t. It&#x27;s also more adult, though it&#x27;s the same cartoonish sensuality as the original &quot;Road&quot; movies, with their heavily coded prurience. It&#x27;s a high-spirited movie, though it&#x27;s not for all tastes. The John-Rice score isn&#x27;t as rousingly on-target as &quot;The Lion King.&quot; The script, while clever, often seems too cute and show-biz snazzy, not emotional enough.&quot;

Lisa Schwarzbaum, reviewing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, remarked that &quot;this trip down &quot;The Road to El Dorado&quot; proceeds under the speed limit all the way. Our Tulio and Miguel aren&#x27;t big enough, nor strong enough, nor funny enough to buckle any swashes. They&#x27;re as lost to us as the lost city into which they stumble.&quot; Similarly, animation historian Charles Solomon remarked on the lack of character development writing &quot;Tulio and Miguel move nicely, but the animators don&#x27;t seem to have any more idea who they are than the audience does. Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh supply their voices, but the characters say and do similar things in similar ways. Who can tell them apart?&quot; Paul Clinton of CNN wrote, &quot;The animation is uninspiring and brings nothing new to the table of animation magic.&quot; He unfavorably compared the Elton John–Tim Rice songs to those in &quot;The Lion King&quot; and called the plot &quot;uninspired&quot;.

Among the film&#x27;s more positive reviewers was Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, who gave the film three stars out of four. He acknowledged that although &quot;The Road to El Dorado&quot; is not &quot;as quirky as &quot;Antz&quot; or as grown up as &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;&quot;, it is &quot;bright and has good energy, and the kinds of witty asides that entertain the adults in between the margins of the stuff for the kids.&quot; Joel Siegel, reviewing on the television program &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, called it &quot;solid gold,&quot; claiming the film was &quot;paved with laughs.&quot; Jay Boyar of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; stated &quot;&quot;The Road to El Dorado&quot; is borderline entertaining, I suppose, with animation that is, at times, truly impressive. And if the six Elton John/Tim Rice songs are thoroughly forgettable, they lack sufficient distinction to actually become annoying.&quot;

Indigenous rights organizations criticized the film for its sexist and racist themes, and for its lack of historical sensitivity. Olin Tezcatlipoca, director of the Mexica Movement, argued that the movie portrays Chel as a &quot;sex toy&quot; for the two Spaniards, and that the representation of them as saviors from the barbarity of human sacrifices and from indigenous collaborationism with Hernán Cortés &quot;has no respect for history.&quot;

In more recent years, Jason Schwartz of &quot;Geeks&quot; called the film &quot;a hidden gem&quot;, and was taken aback at &quot;how well it has aged and how baffling it is that this movie wasn&#x27;t a success.&quot; He called the film &quot;beautifully animated&quot;, and praised the Elton John songs/Hans Zimmer soundtrack. He also praised the characterizations writing, &quot;Miguel and Tulio play off each other effortlessly. Not only does the humor between the two of them flow well, but their friendship is authentic.&quot; Petrana Radulovic, writing for &quot;Polygon&quot;, praised the characters of Miguel and Tulio, as well as the &quot;hilarious scenes and quippy dialogue.&quot;

===Box office===
The film grossed $12.9 million on opening weekend ranking second behind &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot;″s third weekend. The film closed on June 29, 2000, after earning $50.9 million in the United States and Canada and $25.5 million overseas for a worldwide total of $76.4 million. Based on its total gross, &quot;The Road to El Dorado&quot; was a box-office disappointment, unable to recoup its $95 million budget.

===Accolades===
==Video game==

&quot;Gold and Glory: The Road to El Dorado&quot; is an adventure video game developed by Revolution Software for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation. Game Boy Color version was developed by Planet Interactive.

==Internet popularity==
Twenty years after the film&#x27;s release, &quot;The Road to El Dorado&quot; had an unexpected rise in popularity as an Internet meme. Petrana Radulovic, writing for &quot;Polygon&quot;, noted a range of memes and GIFs of moments from the film, writing that it &quot;found a second life and a long-lasting legacy, since it came out at the perfect time to make it a nostalgic movie for people who grew up with the internet.&quot;

In 2023, Dial-Up Studios, a YouTube channel has announced on a reanimated collab film titled: &quot;El Dorado Redialed: A YouTube Reanimated Collaboration&quot; is in development.

<doc id="932303" wikidata="Q1973033" url="?curid=932303" title="Neal Smith (politician)">
<text>Neal Edward Smith (March 23, 1920 – November 2, 2021) was an American politician who was a member of the United States House of Representatives for the Democratic Party from Iowa from 1959 until 1995, the longest-serving Iowan in the United States House of Representatives.

Upon the death of Lester L. Wolff in May 2021, Smith became the oldest living current or former member of Congress. He held this title until his death nearly six months later.

==Early life==
Smith was born in his grandparents&#x27; home near Hedrick, Keokuk County, Iowa. He served in the United States Army Air Forces during the Second World War as a bomber pilot.

His plane was shot down and he received a Purple Heart, nine battle stars, and the Air Medal with four oak leaf clusters.

First with points to exit military service from his group and quickly recruited into university.

He received his undergraduate training at the University of Missouri and Syracuse University and received a law degree from Drake University in 1950.

==Career==
Before entering politics he served as an assistant county attorney for Polk County.

He served as National President of the Young Democratic Clubs of America from 1953 to 1955. He served as Chairman of the Polk County Welfare Board from 1953 to 1954.

Smith was elected to the House of Representatives in the Democratic landslide of 1958, and was reelected 17 more times from a district based in Des Moines—numbered as the 5th District from 1959 to 1973 and as the 4th District from 1973 to 1995.

A federal anti-nepotism law, sponsored by Smith, was enacted in 1967 prevents public officials, including the president, from appointing any relative to head an executive agency. When the law was passed in 1967, it was presumed to be a congressional response to U.S. President John F. Kennedy appointing his younger brother, Robert Kennedy, as U.S. attorney general. As the author of the bill, however, Smith repeatedly denied this was his motive. Smith instead aimed the legislation, the Federal Postal Act of 1967, at nepotism in the postal service, and it applied broadly to both the executive and legislative branches. He said it applied to Congress because &quot;there were 50 members who had their wives on the payrolls.&quot;

For most of his tenure, Smith represented a relatively compact district in central Iowa. However, the 1990s redistricting pushed him into a district covering the southwest quadrant of the state from Des Moines to Council Bluffs, an area that he did not know and that did not know him. He was reelected in 1992, but was defeated in the Republican landslide of 1994 by Greg Ganske, mainly due to heavy losses in the western portion of the district.

==Personal life==
Neal Smith married Beatrix Havens in 1946 and they had two children: Doug and Sharon. His wife died in 2016.

The Neal Smith Wildlife Refuge in Prairie City and the Neal Smith Trail in Des Moines are both named after the former congressman, as well as the Neal Smith Federal Building in Des Moines. The Neal and Bea Smith Law Center at Drake University is named after the former congressman and his wife.

In 1996 Smith published his autobiography: &quot;Mr. Smith Went to Washington: From Eisenhower to Clinton&quot;, in 2009 he wrote &quot;Hanging Out in Bur Oak: During the 1930s Depression, Bootleggers, the Draft, World War II, a Leveling Experience&quot; and in 2019 &quot;From My Century to Yours: Wisdom from the Near 100-Year Life of Former Congressman Neal Edward Smith&quot;.

At the time of his defeat, he had represented Iowa in Congress longer than anyone in the state&#x27;s history; he has since been passed by Democrat Tom Harkin, who served for a combined 40 years in the House and Senate, and by Republican Chuck Grassley, who as of 2023 has served for over 48 years in the House and Senate. However, Smith continues to hold the record for service in the House of Representatives. He turned 100 in March 2020.

Smith died on November 2, 2021, at the age of 101.

<text>Spider is a type of patience game, and is one of the more popular two-deck solitaire games. The game originated in 1949, and its name comes from a spider&#x27;s eight legs, referencing the eight foundation piles that must be filled in order to win.

==Rules==
The main purpose of the game is to remove all cards from the table, assembling them in the tableau before removing them. Initially, 54 cards are dealt to the tableau in ten piles, face down except for the top cards. The tableau piles build down by rank, and in-suit sequences can be moved together. The 50 remaining cards can be dealt to the tableau ten at a time when none of the piles are empty.

A typical Spider layout requires the use of two decks. The tableau consists of 10 stacks, with 6 cards in the first 4 stacks, with the 6th card face up, and 5 cards in the remaining 6 stacks, with the 5th card face up. Each time the stock is used, it deals out one card to each stack.

==Variants==

Given its popularity, numerous Spider variants exist:

* Spider 2 Suit: Same as classic Spider solitaire, except this game is played with only 2 suits instead of 4, usually Spades and Hearts. 
* Spider 1 Suit: Same as classic Spider solitaire, except this game is played with only 1 suit instead of 4, usually Spades. 
* Relaxed Spider: Does not require all spaces to be filled before redealing
* Spiderette: Only one pack, a Klondike layout with 7 stacks ranging from 1 to 7 cards in each
* Will o&#x27; the Wisp is another solitaire card game which was invented by Geoffrey Mott-Smith and is played the same way as Spiderette. The exception is that on the onset, twenty-one cards are dealt into seven columns of three with only the top card of each column face-up.
* Simple Simon is another common one-deck variant of Spider.
* Mrs. Mop is a Spider relative in which all the cards are dealt face-up.

==Software==

===Implementations===

Common software versions of Spider are included with versions of Microsoft Windows 7, Vista, ME and XP as Spider Solitaire. Spider Solitaire was introduced in the Microsoft Plus! 98 addition pack for Windows 98. The game comes in three versions of difficulty: 1, 2, or 4 suits. These play modes are equivalent to disregarding suit difference, either within the colors or altogether, and thus can be simulated in the physical card game, though the computer version aids visibility by representing all cards as spades and/or hearts.

An earlier version was written for Windows 3.x in 1991 by John A. Junod, the original developer of WS_FTP. The final version was Windows Spider Solitaire version 92.01.04. He also wrote a DOS version called EGA-Spider with version up to 93.07.05. A similar game called Arachnid was also written for Windows 3.x in 1991 by Ian Heath, a computer science professor at the University of Southampton in the UK. The latest known version is 1.2. This game was also re-written for 32-bit operating systems and is referred to as Arachnid 32.

On Unix operating systems, an early version was developed around 1989 at Sun Microsystems. A version of Spider Solitaire typically comes bundled with both the KDE and GNOME desktop environments on other Unix-like operating systems such as Linux and BSD, under the names KPatience and AisleRiot Solitaire, respectively.

===Scoring===
Different software implementations of spider offer alternative scoring rules. The version from Sun Microsystems from 1989 defines the following rules in the manual: 10 points for each initially face down card that gets turned over; 15 additional points for each column where all the face-down cards have been turned over (even if you don&#x27;t manage to get a space); 2 points for each card that is sitting atop the next higher card of the same suit; 50 points for each completed suit removed from the tableau (in which case you do not also score for the 12 cards sitting atop next higher cards). This yields a maximum score of 990. If you win the game with 4 or more completed suits still in the tableau, add 2 points for each suit after the first three. Thus winning with all eight suits still in the tableau yields a score of 1000.

In the Windows versions of Spider Solitaire, the scoring is calculated with a starting score of 500. One point is subtracted for each move (including any use of an undo); 100 points are added for each in-suit stack completed. 

===Solvability===
A detailed study has been done on the solvability of Spider solitaire games using software. Winning chances in a normal game with good play are considered to be about 1 in 3 games.

<text>Francis George Fowler (1871–1918) was an English writer on English language, grammar and usage.
Born in Tunbridge Wells, Fowler was educated at Peterhouse, Cambridge. He lived on Guernsey in the Channel Islands. He and his older brother, Henry Watson Fowler, wrote &quot;The King&#x27;s English&quot; together, an influential book published in 1906. Later they worked on what became &quot;Fowler&#x27;s Modern English Usage&quot;, but before it was finished, Francis died of tuberculosis, picked up during his service with the British Expeditionary Force in World War I. He was 47 years old.

Henry dedicated &quot;Modern English Usage&quot; to Francis, writing, &quot;he had a nimbler wit, a better sense of proportion, and a more open mind, than his twelve-year-older partner.&quot;

<text>Tollie Records was a record label formed in February 1964, as a subsidiary label of Vee-Jay Records. It closed in May 1965.

The label distributed two of the Beatles&#x27; singles in the United States before Capitol Records eventually took over. The first single was &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; b/w &quot;There&#x27;s a Place&quot; (Tollie 9001), which was released in February 1964, amid the flurry of Beatlemania that was sweeping the United States at that time. This single version of their recording reached the number 2 position on Billboard&#x27;s Top 40 Hit Singles chart, with its B-side &quot;There&#x27;s a Place&quot; reaching number 74, while the other top five spots were also Beatles records: &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot;, Capitol, No. 1; &quot;She Loves You&quot;, Swan, No. 3; &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;, Capitol, No. 4; &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, Vee-Jay, No. 5.

The second single released by Tollie was &quot;Love Me Do&quot; b/w &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot; (Tollie 9008), in April 1964. It went all the way to number 1 in &quot;Billboard&quot;, while its B-side &quot;PS I Love You&quot; reached number 10. Although the label released a total of 48 singles before it ceased operation in 1965, the Beatles records were its only million-sellers. The label&#x27;s second release was the Dowlands&#x27; cover of the Beatles &quot;All My Loving&quot; b/w &quot;Hey Sally&quot; (Tollie 9002). The Dowlands had a UK number 24 hit with the track, which was produced by Joe Meek. Their recording is an almost exact copy of George Martin&#x27;s Beatles production.

Previous releases of some early Beatles songs on the Vee-Jay label in the summer of 1963 failed to chart in America. &quot;From Me to You&quot; reached no higher than No. 47 on one American Northwest Chart (KISN Radio in Portland, Oregon), in late August 1963.

<text>Chichagof Island (), or Shee Kaax, is an island in the Alexander Archipelago of the Alaska Panhandle. At long and wide, it has a land area of , making it the fifth largest island in the United States and the 109th largest island in the world. Its coastline measures 742 miles. There was a 2000 census population of 1,342 persons. It is one of the ABC islands of Alaska.
Chichagof Island has the highest population of bears per square mile of any place on Earth.

Chichagof Island is directly north of Baranof Island, with Peril Strait separating the two islands. It is bounded by Chatham Strait to the east, Icy Strait to the northeast, Cross Sound to the northwest, and the Gulf of Alaska to the west.
The communities of Hoonah, Pelican, Tenakee Springs, and Elfin Cove are all located on the northern half of Chichagof Island, in the Hoonah-Angoon Census Area. The island&#x27;s southern half comprises the northern part of the City and Borough of Sitka. Only eight persons were counted in this portion of Sitka at the 2000 census. The primary economic sources for all these communities come from either Chichagof Island or the waters and fjords surrounding it. Commercial fishing, guided hunting trips, charter fishing and logging are all vital economic facets of the local economies.

This island is named after Admiral Vasili Chichagov, a Russian Arctic explorer who never visited Alaska. The entire island lies within the limits of Tongass National Forest. The western coastal portion has been officially designated as the West Chichagof-Yakobi Wilderness.

<doc id="932332" wikidata="Q953749" url="?curid=932332" title="John H. Reagan">
<text>John Henninger Reagan (October 8, 1818March 6, 1905) was an American politician from Texas. A Democrat, Reagan resigned from the U.S. House of Representatives when Texas declared secession from the United States and joined the Confederate States of America. He served in the cabinet of Jefferson Davis as Postmaster General.

After the Confederate defeat and his release from prison after the war, Reagan called for cooperation by the southern states with the U.S. government, an unpopular position among most conservative whites. He was elected to Congress in 1874 and was elected in 1886 by the state legislature as a Democrat from Texas to the U.S. Senate, where he served one term from 1887 to 1891. He resigned from the seat when appointed by the governor as chairman of the Texas Railroad Commission. He was among the founders of the Texas State Historical Association.

He was the only former Confederate cabinet member to be sat in the US Senate after the civil war. Alexander H. Stephens, the only Confederate vice president, was also elected in 1866 to represent Georgia, but was refused to be seated to the Senate due to his war history. Elected as the representative of the Democratic Party for the state of Texas, he sat in the Senate for just one term; he was one of just three former Confederate cabinet members to take major political offices after the war.

==Early life==
John Henninger Reagan was born in 1818 in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, to Timothy Richard and Elizabeth (Lusk) Reagan. His parents were primarily of Irish, English and Scottish descent; his middle name was for his Irish ancestors.

He left Tennessee at age nineteen and traveled to the Republic of Texas, which had become independent from Mexico the year before in 1836. Reagan worked as a surveyor from 1839 to 1843. He bought a property and farmed in Kaufman County until 1851. During the time he worked as a surveyor, he also served as a private tutor to the children of John Marie Durst.

Reagan read the law, served as an apprentice in an established firm, and was licensed to practice in 1846. He opened an office in Buffalo and the same year was elected a probate judge in Henderson County. In 1847 he was elected to the Texas House of Representatives but was defeated for a second term in 1849. He was admitted to the bar in 1848 and practiced in both Buffalo and Palestine, Texas.

Reagan was elected as a district judge in Palestine, serving from 1852 to 1857. His efforts to defeat the American Party (Know-Nothings) resulted in his election to Congress as a Democrat in 1857 from Texas&#x27;s 1st congressional district.

Reagan was a staunch supporter of slavery. He believed abolition would cause such social problems as to require Southern whites &quot;exterminate the greater portion of the [black] race.&quot; He also believed in the federal protections of slavery under the U.S. Constitution as extensions of private property rights, therefore he supported the United States. But when it became clear that Texas would secede, Reagan resigned from Congress on January 15, 1861, and returned home to the state to participate in the rebellion.

He participated in the secession convention at Austin, Texas on January 31, 1861. Chosen as a member of the Provisional Confederate Congress, President Jefferson Davis appointed Reagan to his cabinet as Postmaster General within a month.

==Civil War==
Despite the hostilities, the United States Post Office Department continued operations in the Confederacy until June 1, 1861, when the Confederate service took over its functions.

Reagan sent an agent to Washington, D.C., with letters asking the heads of the United States Post Office Department&#x27;s various bureaus to work for him. Nearly all did so and brought copies of their records, contracts, account books, etc. &quot;Reagan in effect had stolen the U.S. Post Office,&quot; historian William C. Davis later wrote.

Reagan cut expenses by eliminating costly and little-used routes and forcing railroads that carried the mail to reduce their rates. Despite the problems the war caused, his department managed to turn a profit, &quot;the only post office department in American history to pay its own way,&quot; wrote William C. Davis. Reagan was the only member of the cabinet to oppose Robert E. Lee&#x27;s offensive into Pennsylvania in June–July 1863. He instead supported a proposal to detach the First Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia to reinforce Joseph E. Johnston in Mississippi, to break the Siege of Vicksburg. Historian Shelby Foote noted that, as the only Cabinet member from west of the Mississippi, Reagan was acutely aware of the critical consequences of Vicksburg&#x27;s capture and control of the river by U.S. forces.

When Davis abandoned Richmond, Virginia on April 2, 1865, shortly before the entry of Army of the Potomac under George G. Meade, Reagan accompanied the president on his flight to the Carolinas. On April 27, Davis made him Secretary of the Treasury after George A. Trenholm&#x27;s resignation. Reagan served in that capacity until he, Davis, and Texas governor Francis R. Lubbock were captured near Irwinville, Georgia, on May 10.

Reagan was imprisoned with Confederate vice president Alexander Stephens at Fort Warren in Boston, Massachusetts. He was held in solitary confinement for twenty-two weeks. On August 11, he wrote an open letter to his fellow Texans urging cooperation with the United States, renunciation of the secession convention, the abolition of slavery, and letting formerly enslaved people vote. He warned that the U.S. government would be forced to impose military rule to enforce these measures if Texans did not voluntarily adopt them. Abolition was underway, and Reagan knew there was support for granting the vote to freedmen. Texans denounced him. After being released from prison later that year, he returned to his home in Palestine in December.

==Return to public life==

To those who felt that the Reconstruction was unduly harsh, Reagan&#x27;s prescience was hailed—he became known as the &quot;Old Roman,&quot; a Texas Cincinnatus. He was part of the successful effort to remove Republican Edmund J. Davis from the governorship in 1874 after Davis attempted to remain in office illegally after losing the election.

That year Reagan was elected to the Congressional seat he held before the war, and he served from March 4, 1875, to March 3, 1887. In 1875, he was a delegate to the convention that wrote a new state constitution for Texas. In Congress, he advocated federal regulation of railroads and helped create the Interstate Commerce Commission. He also served as the first chairman of the Committee on Post Offices and Post Roads.

Elected by the Texas State Legislature to the U.S. Senate in 1887 (serving March 4, 1887, to June 10, 1891), Reagan resigned to become chair of the Railroad Commission of Texas at the behest of his friend, Governor Jim Hogg. He chaired it until 1903, continuing to serve under governors Charles A. Culberson and Joseph D. Sayers. Hogg had run on a platform of state regulation of railroads.

Conscious of the importance of recounting and interpreting history, Reagan founded the Texas State Historical Association. He also attended reunions of Confederate veterans in his state. He wrote his &quot;Memoirs, With Special Reference to Secession and the Civil War&quot;, published in 1905. Later that year, Reagan died of pneumonia at his home in Palestine, the last surviving member of Jefferson Davis&#x27; cabinet in the Confederate government.

<doc id="932338" wikidata="Q1158704" url="?curid=932338" title="Damo Suzuki">
<text>, known as Damo Suzuki (ダモ鈴木), was a Japanese musician best known as the vocalist for the German Krautrock group Can between 1970 and 1973. Born in 1950 in Kobe, Japan, he moved to Europe in the late 1960s where he was spotted busking in Munich, West Germany, by Can bassist Holger Czukay and drummer Jaki Liebezeit. Can had just split with their vocalist Malcolm Mooney, and asked Suzuki to sing over tracks from their 1970 compilation album &quot;Soundtracks&quot;. Afterwards, he became their full time singer, appearing on the three influential albums &quot;Tago Mago&quot; (1971), &quot;Ege Bamyası&quot; (1972) and &quot;Future Days&quot; (1973).

After leaving Can in 1973, he abandoned music and became a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness. Having left that organisation, he returned to music in the mid-1980s and began to tour widely. Over the following decades, Suzuki recorded a large number of albums under different aliases, which he later grouped as &quot;Damo Suzuki&#x27;s Network&quot;.

==Biography==
Kenji Suzuki was born in Kobe, Japan on 16 January 1950. Suzuki was growing up playing several musical instruments, getting a new instrument from his sister every other birthday, since his eighth or ninth birthday when he got a flute. Suzuki additionally played a clarinet, saxophone, guitar, and organ. In his teens, Damo &quot;gradually became dissatisfied with aspects of Japanese society and felt some kinship with the country&#x27;s various protest movements&quot;. He participated in 1959-1960 Anpo protests.

By 1967, Suzuki lived in Atsugi, Kanagawa, still feeling discontented with the Japanese culture, while &quot;lighted on Sweden [culture] because he was attracted by its functioning social democracy and generous welfare state&quot;. On 29 November 1967, Suzuki wrote a listing in the &quot;penpals wanted&quot; section of the Swedish newspaper &quot;Expressen&quot;, under the headline &quot;Wants to study Swedish traditions&quot;. Twenty-one people from all over Sweden replied, and Suzuki chose among them the Andersson from Gräsmark, a tiny rural hamlet in south-western Sweden about thirty kilometres from the border with Norway. Suzuki boarded the Trans-Siberian Railway bearing his guitar, clarinet, and sax, and arrived in Gräsmark in February 1968, where he was soon joined by his friend Shuji Kawamukai. The two Japanese teenagers attracted attention of the local newspaper, Värmlands Folkblad, publishing a coverage on the Gräsmark cultural exchange in March 1968—Suzuki and Kawamukai taught the family how to prepare Japanese culinary delicacies and entertaining people of Gräsmark with musical harmony. They communicated through head and arm gestures, with a little English. 

After a one-month stay in Gräsmark, Suzuki and Kawamukai moved to the Swedish town of Karlstad, hoping to extend their stay in Sweden by looking for sources of income either as judo instructors or chefs. However, Suzuki changed the plans soon after and set off on his journey across Europe spending about six months across &quot;Germany, France, Switzerland, and Finland&quot;. By August 1969, he lived in Wexford, Ireland, for another six months, then in Seven Sisters, London. Suzuki earned money by busking and painting, and in London he sold enough paintings to afford a ticket to Munich, West Germany, where he was hired to play guitar in the local production of Hair musical, staged in early 1970. At one point, Suzuki stayed at Munich&#x27;s squat occupied by the Amon Düül collective.

===Career===
In late May 1970, Damo Suzuki was busking outside Blow Up club in Munich when he was approached by the members of Can, Holger Czukay and Jaki Liebezeit, who invited him to join their performance that evening. Suzuki performed with the band at the Blow Up Club that evening, and subsequently became a full member of the group. Suzuki later remembered the months before the encounter as &quot;very frustrating because he was doing the same thing every day. He can&#x27;t really remember what I was doing when he met Can, but every day he would do a kind of street performance or just scream because he was frustrated. But they saw me and asked me to be their singer not because they liked my voice but because they wanted somebody who looked like an alien. Japanese or Chinese people in the early seventies were seen seldom, totally different to now … They wanted me for this, they didn&#x27;t know how I sang.&quot;

Suzuki didn&#x27;t have time to prepare for Can&#x27;s performance at Blow Up club, but the &quot;chemistry flared up from the very start&quot;. As Holger recalled, &quot;he started very, very calm but then he developed into a samurai fighter&quot;, and the audience &quot;got so angry that they left the venue. There was only about thirty people left in a venue that holds fifteen hundred.&quot; Irmin Schmidt, the band&#x27;s keyboardist, remembered that at first Damo had &quot;real difficulties to see himself in this group … he had doubts that he did the right thing. That&#x27;s bloody understandable! We were very disciplined workers. And he had never done discipline in his life! We sometimes felt it, but we didn&#x27;t care; we just thought he is good and it&#x27;s nice to have him, but if he can&#x27;t make it, he can&#x27;t make it—basta.&quot;

Suzuki&#x27;s first recording with Can was &quot;Don&#x27;t Turn the Light On, Leave Me Alone&quot; featured on &quot;Soundtracks&quot; (1970). Suzuki was a full-time member of Can from 1970 to 1973. His first album with the band was the highly influential double album &quot;Tago Mago&quot; (1971), widely considered as foundational in the development of Krautrock and a major influence on bands ranging from the Sex Pistols to Happy Mondays. Suzuki&#x27;s vocals became more confident and defining with Can&#x27;s 1972 album &quot;Ege Bamyası&quot;, as evidenced in the songs &quot;Vitamin C&quot; and &quot;Spoon&quot;. The band developed a more atmospheric sound for &quot;Future Days&quot; (1973), their final album with Suzuki. Following the album&#x27;s release, Suzuki quit the band and joined the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, taking a break from music for the following decade.

Suzuki returned to music in 1983, initially joining a band called Dunkelziffer, and led several solo projects collectively known as &quot;Damo Suzuki&#x27;s Network&quot;. During his solo tours, Suzuki performed live improvisational music with various local musicians, which he described as &quot;sound carriers.&quot; Both Michael Karoli and Jaki Liebezeit had been working with Damo Suzuki post-Can, playing several concerts with Michael Karoli and Mani Neumeier of Guru Guru in Japan and the US in 1997–8.

Suzuki published his memoir &quot;I Am Damo Suzuki&quot; in 2019. His career was briefly revived in 2022 following the well received album &quot;Arkaoda&quot;, recorded in conjunction with &quot;Spiritczualic Enhancement Center&quot; musical project.

== Personal life ==
Damo Suzuki married a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness missionary in late 1972, which notably changed his behaviour. As recalled by Irmin Schmidt: &quot;a young Japanese woman from Düsseldorf appeared at Damo&#x27;s place and started working on him. She was a very successful missionary. After some time Damo got strange. Sitting in dressing rooms, reading the Bible. Got very unconcentrated on the music and objecting more and more to the most ridiculous things.&quot;

Suzuki met his second wife Elke Morsbach in Cologne in 1985. He lived in the city, although he played more shows in the United Kingdom and said that British audiences were more receptive to his music than were German ones. During his break from music, Suzuki became a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness but left the organisation, considering himself a believer in the Bible without membership in any denomination or church.

While staying in Gräsmark with Andersson family, Suzuki befriended Birgitta Engman, the daughter of the Anderssons&#x27; neighbours, who introduced him to her circle of friends. After Suzuki left Gräsmark, they kept a letter correspondence until 1972, and he wrote a handwritten lyric &quot;For My Birgitta&quot; in 1968. According to Birgitta, &quot;he wanted to take her back with him to Japan and open a record shop together, but first he needed to carry on travelling around the world in order to finance the
plane tickets required to attain that distant dream&quot;.

Suzuki picked up his nickname &quot;Damo&quot; while staying on a farm in Wexford, Ireland. The nickname is &quot;based on a misfortune-prone anime character&quot;.

Suzuki participated in 1959-1960 Anpo protests and protests of 1968. In 2004, Suzuki told an interviewer he was an anarchist, saying he didn&#x27;t believe in any kind of politician and not so interested in economic things and materialism, so it&#x27;s my dream to continue this so that people get a feeling that brings them much more together.&quot;

He was diagnosed at 33 with colon cancer, a disease that claimed his father&#x27;s life when Suzuki was five years old. He was diagnosed with colon cancer again in 2014 and given a 10% chance of survival. He died at his home in Cologne on 9 February 2024 at the age of 74. The documentary &quot;Energy&quot; explores Suzuki&#x27;s battle with cancer and relationship with his wife.

==Style and legacy==
Suzuki&#x27;s free-form, often improvised, lyrics were largely indiscernible, leading many critics to think they were sung in no particular language. Suzuki&#x27;s bandmate, Michael Karoli compared his singing to Billie Holiday, highlighted by &quot;this strange, modal way of singing a very refined harmony, with some slight dissonances&quot;. According to journalist Jo Vito, Suzuki &quot;had an innovative and inimitable approach to singing, often improvising parts sung in a variety of languages (a blend he referred to as &#x27;the language of the Stone Age&#x27;)&quot;.

The readers&#x27; poll on German music, published in the &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine on February 1972, voted Can second-best group, Tago Mago second-best album, and Damo the second-best vocalist.

The Fall&#x27;s 1985 album &quot;This Nation&#x27;s Saving Grace&quot; contains the song &quot;I Am Damo Suzuki&quot;. The Fall&#x27;s vocalist Mark E. Smith was an early fan of Can and became friends with Suzuki, who in 2019 used the song title for his 2019 biography &quot;I Am Damo Suzuki&quot;. The rock band the Mooney Suzuki takes its name from Suzuki and Can&#x27;s earlier vocalist Malcolm Mooney.

<text>Wu () refers to a region in China centered on Lake Tai in Jiangnan (the region south of the Yangtze River). The Wu region was historically part of the ancient Yang Province in southeastern China. The name &quot;Wu&quot; came from the names of several historical kingdoms based in that area.

==History==
The first Wu state was established in the late Western Zhou dynasty. Once considered to be a vassal state of the Western Zhou dynasty, the Wu state emerged as a major power among the various states in China at the end of the Spring and Autumn period. The Wu state was a major power despite pressure from neighboring states.

The most influential one among the historical Wu kingdoms was the state of Eastern Wu, which existed during the Three Kingdoms period.

In the Han dynasty, the Wu region was mainly under the jurisdiction of Wu Commandery, which was a commandery under the larger Yang Province. Wu Commandery was later converted to Wu Prefecture. In the Sui and Tang dynasties, the names changed several times between Wu and Su and eventually named Su Prefecture (present-day Suzhou) in the year 758.

There was two Wu Prefectures during the Southern and Northern Dynasties period. The Wu Prefecture of the Northern Dynasties was renamed Yang Prefecture (present-day Yangzhou) in the year 589, and around the same time Yang Prefecture was renamed Jiang Prefecture (present-day Nanjing).

==Notable cities==
===Meili===
The state of Wu was founded by Taibo and Zhongyong, the first and second son of King Tai of Zhou. Meili (梅里) was the capital city. The vicinity is now known as Wuxi.

===Suzhou===
Suzhou was the capital of the Wu state during the Warring States period. Suzhou was also called Wuzhou.

The Wu language and its dialects are spoken in Wu region. The city of Suzhou is located in the core area of Wu region, and the dialect spoken in Suzhou is usually regarded as the most typical Wu language dialect.

===Nanjing===
The capital of the Eastern Wu state during the Three Kingdoms period was Nanjing, whose names include Jinling, Jianye and Jiankang.

In the Eastern Jin dynasty, Nanjing became the capital of China, for the first time the capital of the Chinese empire moved to southern China. The previous Chungyuan Standard Pronunciation (中原雅音) evolved into the Jinling Standard Pronunciation (金陵雅音) of standard Chinese. Go-on (吳音), which is one of the sources of Japanese pronunciation for Chinese characters (the others being kan-on, tō-on and kan&#x27;yō-on), was Jinling Standard Pronunciation, the standard Chinese of time that spread to Japan during Southern dynasties. The &quot;Go-&quot; component in the name &quot;Go-on&quot; is cognate to the Chinese word &quot;Wu&quot; (Wu is the pronunciation for the glyph 吳 in Mandarin. However, in today&#x27;s Wu language 吳 is usually pronounced as &quot;Ho&quot;, &quot;Oh&quot;, &quot;Ng&quot;, or &quot;Nguu&quot;).

<text>A protocol analyzer is a tool (hardware or software) used to capture and analyze signals and data traffic over a communication channel. Such a channel varies from a local computer bus to a satellite link, that provides a means of communication using a standard communication protocol (networked or point-to-point). Each type of communication protocol has a different tool to collect and analyze signals and data. 

Specific types of protocol analyzers include:

* A telecom network protocol analyzer
* A network packet analyzer such as Wireshark
* A bus analyzer
* An IP load tester

<text>Malcolm &quot;Desse&quot; Mooney (born 1944) is an American singer, poet, and artist, best known as the original vocalist for German krautrock band Can.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Malcolm Mooney&#x27;s father, after serving in the navy, became a jazz piano player who had once been taught in North Carolina by a former teacher of Nina Simone. Mooney spent his early life in Westchester County. He, attracted to music from an early age, made attempts at learning accordion, clarinet, and saxophone. In high school Mooney joined a cappella group known as the &quot;Six-Fifths&quot;. Later, Mooney moved in with his sister in the Mission Hill district of Boston, where he attended the arts programme at Boston University, striving to become a painter and sculptor. While residing in Boston, Mooney get to know composer Ivan Tcherepnin and his wife.

After his move to New York City, Mooney gained some fame as a sculptor. In 1967, Mooney and his friend, Joshua Zim, left the United States, escaping the potential conscription to the Vietnam war. They embarked on a journey leaving New York on plane, flying through Reykjavík, reaching Luxembourg, then hitching a ride to Paris. Serge Tcherepnin, Ivan Tcherepnin&#x27;s brother, invited them to use his apartment in Paris while he was in the country, sharing space with Portuguese composer Emmanuel Nunes. After their brief stay, Mooney and Zim continued to hitch hike southwards through France, reaching the southern coast of Spain to get a passage to Morocco, intending to continue their eastward journey by camel across north Africa, but the Strait of Gibraltar crossing was shut down at that time and they were blocked at the port of Algeciras. Mooney and Zim spent three weeks in the Formentera and continued traveling across the Mediterranean and reaching Bombay. After a brief stay, they hitch hiked back to Europe, arriving in Paris in late August or early September 1966, where Mooney met Hildegard Schmidt, spouse of German composer Irmin Schmidt. Hildegard, learning Malcolm was an aspiring painter, invited him to come to Cologne and make connections with the German art world. In April 1968, Mooney parted ways with his friend Zim and took a flight to Cologne, reaching out to the Schmidt household who agreed to let him live in their apartment.

===Career===
During his time in Cologne, Malcolm Mooney became friends with Irmin Schmidt and Holger Czukay, who were forming a band and accepted to join them as lead vocalist. The band was originally known as &quot;Inner Space&quot;, but Mooney came up with &quot;The Can&quot;, later shortened to Can. Can showed him an instrumental tape and asked to came up with accompanying lyrics, which turned out as &quot;Father Cannot Yell&quot; on &quot;Monster Movie&quot;, reminiscing about his pilgrimage and taking inspiration from the relationship between Zim and his girlfriend who left during his journey. This song marked a determining moment for the band, the time when, as Holger admitted, &quot;Can wasn&#x27;t sure yet which way musically to go till Malcolm jumped one day to the microphone and pushed us into A RHYTHM&quot;. Irmin told &quot;Ptolemaic Terrascope&quot;, Malcolm arrival &quot;gave the group the last kick toward rock&quot;.

Mooney recorded enough material with Can to assemble them into their debut album, initially entitled as &quot;Prepared To Meet Thy Pnoom&quot;. At that time no record company was willing to release the recordings, but eventually they were released in 1981 as &quot;Delay 1968.&quot; Can&#x27;s second album became their debut, &quot;Monster Movie&quot;, released in 1969. It was successful in the German underground scene. Various other tracks that Mooney recorded with the band during this period appear on the compilation albums &quot;Soundtracks&quot; and &quot;Unlimited Edition&quot;. Mooney quit the band and returned to America soon after the recording of &quot;Monster Movie&quot;, having been told by a psychiatrist that getting away from the chaotic music of Can would be better for his mental health. The liner notes from the album claim erroneously that Mooney suffered a nervous breakdown, shouting &quot;upstairs, downstairs&quot; repeatedly.

Mooney reunited with Can in 1986 to record a one-off reunion album, &quot;Rite Time&quot;. He also has released three albums with the San Francisco Bay Area band Tenth Planet, on the first of which, a new version of the song &quot;Father Cannot Yell&quot; from &quot;Monster Movie&quot; appears. For the second Tenth Planet album, a different line-up was introduced, and the album saw a limited release in Japan on the P-Vine label. Prior to its issue, the Unfortunate Miracle label issued a limited 7&quot; picture disc single containing two early mixes from the forthcoming album. In 2002, Mooney was invited to sing on Andy Votel&#x27;s &quot;All Ten Fingers&quot; album – on the song &quot;Salted Tangerines&quot;, a version of Mooney&#x27;s poem of the same name. The Tenth Planet released an album on Milviason Records entitled &quot;inCANtations&quot;. Mooney now focuses on his visual art. In 2007, Matthew Higgs invited Mooney to exhibit a piece at New York&#x27;s venerable White Columns.

In 2013, Mooney began to collaborate with drummer, songwriter and producer Sean Noonan, along with Jamaaladeen Tacuma and Aram Bajakian, to record &quot;Pavees Dance: There&#x27;s Always the Night&quot;. The group performed in February 2014 at the Sons D&#x27;Hiver festival in France in advance of the release of the June 2014 release of the CD and accompanying book featuring lyrics and Mooney&#x27;s art work.

In April 2017, Mooney appeared at the Barbican Centre in the City of London as the lead singer of The Can Project, a reunion concert with Irmin Schmidt joined by Sonic Youth&#x27;s Thurston Moore and My Bloody Valentine&#x27;s Debbie Googe. Jaki Liebezeit, Can&#x27;s drummer, had recently died. The concert received mixed reviews and suffered sound issues, especially with Mooney&#x27;s vocals.

In 2021, Mooney&#x27;s work was exhibited at Aspen Art Museum in the exhibition Winterfest.

In 2022, Mooney had an exhibition at Ulrik in New York titled &quot;Works 1970-1986.&quot; Mooney produced his first geometric works in 1970 as set designs for a theater play titled &quot;Harlem Angel&quot;. Shortly after he began work on a series of eponymous silk screens at his father’s print shop in Yonkers, New York. He describes the origin of these pieces as developed from an image of kente cloth viewed under a microscope. This image continued to inform his paintings and drawings of grids throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Mooney’s interest evolved further through his encounter with the 1972 exhibition “African Textiles and Decorative Arts” at the Museum of Modern Art, his friendship with textile curator and shopkeeper Sara Penn as well as his own work in the mechanical processes of textile design.

From experiments with utilitarian objects to stage and lighting design, from graphic design to work with textiles, clothing, and even runway shows, there persists an ongoing migration between the applied and “high art” in Mooney’s work which intentionally cross-pollinates both.

<text>Banghra is a Spanish pop group formed in 2007 with members Javi Mota, Lidia Guevara, and Victoria Gómez that tried to reintroduce belly dancing and Indian dance music to the mainstream in catchy songs sung in Spanish and English. The band was formed as a project of producer Sergio Medrano (who had produced Monjes budistas). The group disbanded in 2008 after just 2 albums in 2 years, namely &quot;La Danza del Vientre&quot; and &quot;...a bailar!&quot; and a number of successful singles, the biggest of which was &quot;My Own Way&quot;. After split up of Banghra, Javi Mota and Lidia Guevara have both pursued solo music careers.

== Career ==
Singers / dancers Javi Mota, Lydia Guevara and Victoria Gómez started Banghra with aesthetic urban modern sound, making Spanish fans &quot;rediscover&quot; the contemporary belly dance. Being inspired by its movements, they combined music, dances and exercise in all their songs.

In June 2007, their first album, &quot;La Danza del Vientre&quot; (Spanish for belly dance) became a big sensation of the summer charts in Spain, with songs performed in Spanish and English taking the typical oriental / eastern sounds of belly dancing. The album reached position #3 in the Spanish pop charts.

The DVD version included the first video of the group, &quot;making of&quot; version of the album, plus an informative article that teaches dance choreographies for many of the songs in the album to the listeners plus a photo gallery.

The first single from the album that made the group famous was &quot;My Own Way&quot;, that was the top spin sounded in pop radios in Spain. They had also relative success with their second single release from the album entitled &quot;Promised Land&quot;. The latter was included in a compilation album entitled &quot;Superventas 2008&quot; that included many other dance tunes from various Spanish and international artists.

The band is trying to build on the early success with a second album released in July 2008 entitled &quot;...a bailar!&quot; with a more mainstream pop style than the first album. They released the Spanish language single &quot;Una especie en extinción&quot; which proved to be a much more minor hit than &quot;My Own Way&quot;. They followed that with release of the single &quot;Unidos&quot;

==After Banghra==
After the split up of the group, the members have pursued solo careers.

===Javi Mota===
Javi Mota (Javier Mota) is a solo singer and actor. He took part in a bid to represent Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 to be held in Oslo with the song &quot;Amarte Hoy&quot; written by Roel Garcia and produced by Ivan Vázquez, but failed to qualify.

<doc id="932368" wikidata="Q724396" url="?curid=932368" title="Stéphane Breitwieser">
<text>Stéphane Breitwieser (born 1 October 1971) is a French art thief and author, notorious for his art thefts between 1995 and 2001. He admitted to stealing 239 artworks and other exhibits from 172 museums while travelling around Europe and working as a waiter, an average of one theft every 15 days. &quot;The Guardian&quot; called him &quot;arguably the world&#x27;s most consistent art thief&quot;. He has also been called &quot;one of the most prolific and successful art thieves who have ever lived&quot;, and &quot;one of the greatest art thieves of all time&quot;. His thefts resulted in the destruction of many works of art, destroyed by his family to conceal evidence of his crimes.

He differs from most other art thieves in that most of his thefts initially did not involve profit motive. He was a self-described art connoisseur who stole in order to build a personal collection of stolen works, particularly of 16th and 17th century masters. At his trial, the magistrate quoted him as saying, &quot;I enjoy art. I love such works of art. I collected them and kept them at home.&quot; Despite the immensity of his collection, he was still able to recall every piece he stole. He interrupted the lengthy reading of his collection during his trial several times to correct various details. However, in 2016 evidence surfaced of further thefts for profit and he was arrested again.

According to journalist Michael Finkel&#x27;s 2023 book &quot;The Art Thief&quot;, Breitwieser&#x27;s first theft was in early 1994 in Thann, a medieval town in northeastern France. Breitwieser stole an 18th-century flintlock pistol from the Museum of the Friends of Thann. The second theft, as reported in &quot;The Art Thief&quot;, took place in February 1995. At that time, Breitwieser stole a medieval crossbow from a museum in the Alsatian mountains. 

His third theft was in March 1995 during a visit to the medieval castle at Gruyères, Switzerland, with his then-girlfriend Anne-Catherine Kleinklaus. He became entranced with a small painting of a woman by the 18th-century German painter Christian Wilhelm Ernst Dietrich, later saying: &quot;I was fascinated by her beauty, by the qualities of the woman in the portrait and by her eyes. I thought it was an imitation of Rembrandt.&quot; With his girlfriend keeping watch, Breitwieser worked out the nails holding the painting in its frame and slipped it under his jacket. He would go on to use similar methods for thefts at other museums numbering at least 170 in the ensuing years. He would typically visit small collections and regional museums, where security was lax, and Kleinklaus would serve as his lookout as he cut the paintings from their frames.

The single most valuable work of art he stole was &quot;Sybille, Princess of Cleves&quot; by Lucas Cranach the Elder from a castle in Baden-Baden in 1995. In 2003 &quot;The Guardian&quot; estimated that its value at auction would be more than £5 million (£8.7 million or €10 million adjusted for inflation in 2023). He cut it from its frame at a Sotheby&#x27;s auction where it was to be sold.

Breitwieser did not attempt to sell any of his large collection of art for profit at first; instead he enjoyed thinking about how he was &quot;the wealthiest man in Europe.&quot; It was all kept in his bedroom in his mother&#x27;s house in Mulhouse, France. His room was kept in semi-darkness so the sunlight would not fade the paintings. A local framer who reframed paintings for Breitwieser did not recognize the art as some of Europe&#x27;s masterpieces. His mother, Mireille Breitwieser (née Stengel), thought the works had been bought at auction and only later suspected that he had not acquired them legitimately.

Eventually around 110 pieces from his collection have been recovered, leaving another 60 unaccounted for, presumably destroyed. His collection included:

* Pieter Brueghel the Younger - &quot;Cheat Profiting From His Master&quot;**, cut with scissors
* Antoine Watteau - &quot;Two Men&quot;*
* François Boucher - &quot;Sleeping Shepherd&quot;**
* Corneille de Lyon - &quot;Madeleine of France, Queen of Scotland&quot;**
* David Teniers - &quot;The Monkey&#x27;s Ball&quot;**, shredded with scissors
==Capture==
Breitwieser and Kleinklaus were first caught in 1997, when they walked off with a Willem van Aelst landscape from a private collection which they had been allowed to see with special permission from the gallery owner. Alerted to the theft, the owner ran out and recognized the two as they got into Breitwieser&#x27;s mother&#x27;s car. Another artifact was found in the car. Because it was his first offense in Switzerland, he was given only an eight-month suspended sentence and banned from entering Switzerland until May 2000. However, his job was in Switzerland across the border from France, and he continued working under his mother&#x27;s maiden name. He also continued his thefts, even returning to museums of prior crimes to steal again.

In November 2001, he was caught after stealing a bugle dating from 1584, one of only three like it in the world and with an estimated value of £45,000, from the Richard Wagner Museum in Lucerne, Switzerland. A security guard spotted Breitwieser before he escaped, but he returned to the museum two days later. That day, a journalist, Erich Eisner, was walking his dog on the museum grounds when he noticed a man surveying the museum who seemed out of place, wearing a &quot;nice overcoat.&quot; Aware of the recent theft, Eisner alerted the main guard on duty, who was the same guard who had seen Breitwieser during the heist. He alerted the authorities, who then arrested Breitwieser. Lucerne police awarded Eisner&#x27;s dog a lifetime supply of food in appreciation of his help.

==Destruction of art==
When Mireille Breitwieser heard of her son&#x27;s arrest from Kleinklaus, who had been able to evade Swiss authorities, she proceeded to destroy many of the works Breitwieser stored at her house in Mulhouse: contemporary reports suggested she cut or carved them up, leaving the remains of the frames in the trash over several weeks and forcing the shredded paintings down her garbage disposal unit, but, as most of the paintings were on wooden panels, it seems more likely that they were, as she confessed, incinerated in a pyre in nearby woodland. She threw other stolen artifacts, such as vases, jewelry, pottery, and statuettes, into the nearby Rhône–Rhine Canal, where a few later washed up on the shore; most of the 107 pieces were recovered through dredging and diving work. 

She stated that she destroyed the paintings out of anger at her son, but police believe she did it to destroy incriminating evidence against him and herself. She apparently had no knowledge of the large monetary value of the works.

It took Swiss authorities 19 days to acquire the international search warrant required to search Breitwieser&#x27;s mother&#x27;s house. Police found only the cord originally attached to the antique bugle stolen in Lucerne. Breitwieser did not confess to his crimes until a few months later, when he gave authorities a detailed account of the works he had stolen. His mother admitted to destroying the artwork some seven months later, after some pieces had washed up on the banks of the Rhine. A Swiss police officer said, &quot;[N]ever have so many old masters been destroyed at the same time.&quot;

==Sentence==
On 6 January 2005, Breitwieser attempted to hang himself in trial detention, but was stopped after another inmate alerted a guard. The next day he was sentenced to three years imprisonment by a court in Strasbourg but only served 26 months. He spent two years in prison in Switzerland before being extradited to France. His mother received a three-year sentence for destroying the artwork but served only 18 months. Kleinklaus, his ex-girlfriend, received 18 months for receiving stolen items but served only six.

In 2005, editor of the cultural section of the French newspaper &quot;Libération&quot; Vincent Noce published a book about Breitwieser and the investigation into his thefts, titled &quot;La collection egoiste&quot; (&quot;The Selfish Collector&quot;). In 2006 Breitwieser published a romanticized autobiographical book about his exploits, titled &quot;Confessions d&#x27;un Voleur d&#x27;art&quot; (&quot;Confessions of an Art Thief&quot;), in which he claimed to have stolen some 230 artifacts over about seven years. 

In April 2011, the police discovered 30 more stolen works during a house search. This resulted in another three-year prison sentence for Breitwieser in 2013.

Breitwieser was placed under surveillance in 2016 after he tried to sell a paperweight on eBay that had been stolen from a museum in St. Louis. He was arrested again in February 2019. At his home the police found Roman coins from another museum, as well as pieces from Alsatian and German galleries. In his mother&#x27;s home, €163,000 in cash was found hidden in buckets. The trial was held in March 2023 in Sarreguemines, France. He was found guilty and was sentenced to house arrest and is required to wear an ankle monitor.
