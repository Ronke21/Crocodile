<text>The Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS) is a voluntary programme run by the United Kingdom government to record the increasing numbers of small finds of archaeological interest found by members of the public. The scheme began in 1997 and now covers most of England and Wales.

It is primarily focused on private metal detectorists who through their hobby regularly discover artefacts that would otherwise go unrecorded. Members of the public can also report objects they have found and finds of non-metallic objects are also covered by the scheme. Finds that legally constitute treasure are dealt with through the Treasure Act 1996. This however concentrates on precious metals, prehistoric base metal, and finds in association with them. Non-prehistoric base metal and non-metal finds would not be recognised as treasure and therefore be unrecorded. The PAS exists to fill this gap.

The scheme funds the posts of Finds Liaison Officers (FLOs) at county councils or local museums to whom finders can report their objects. The FLO is qualified to examine the find and provide the finder with more information on it. They also record the find, its function, date, material and location and place this information into a database which can be analysed. The information on the findspot can be used to organise more research on the area. Many previously unknown archaeological sites have been identified through the scheme and it has contributed greatly to the level of knowledge of the past. FLOs maintain close links with local metal detecting societies and have contributed to a thaw in relationships between the detectorists and archaeologists who often previously disdained one another.

Finds are photographed, often from multiple angles, and a text description is recorded. The photographs are made available under an open licence.

The find remains the property of the finder or the landowner who are free to dispose of non-treasure finds.

==Other activities==

The PAS engages widely with the professional and amateur archaeological community through conferences, workshops and public activities. It also provides host servers and technical support for the Day of Archaeology.

==History of the programme==

In March 1996, during the run-up to the passing of the new Treasure Act, what was then the Department of National Heritage (DNH) (now the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS)) published &quot;Portable Antiquities. A discussion document&quot;. The aim of this document was to complement the impending Treasure Act, address the issue of non-treasure archaeological finds and to propose solutions for dealing with these.

The general response to the DNH&#x27;s proposals was that the recording of all archaeological finds was important and that a consistent voluntary scheme to record finds should be established. As a result, in December 1996, the DNH announced that funding would be provided for two years for a programme of six pilot schemes, starting in September 1997. The main aim of the pilot schemes was “to enable an accurate estimate to be made of the resources that would be needed to extend the scheme across the whole of England” (DNH 1997). The essential aim was to advance knowledge of history and archaeology.

The project was ultimately overseen by the DCMS and administered by the Museums and Galleries Commission (later Resource, now Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA))

Expressions of interest in hosting the pilot schemes were then invited and host organisations chosen. The schemes were based in museums and archaeology services in Kent, Norfolk, the West Midlands, North Lincolnshire, the North West England and Yorkshire. A Finds Liaison Officer (FLO) was put in place as part of each pilot scheme. The six posts and schemes were co-ordinated by a further post which was based at, and funded by, the British Museum.

These six regions were chosen for the pilot schemes in consultation with the Council for British Archaeology (CBA), and were representative of the existing diversity in recording finds systems. Some areas, such as Norfolk, had already established a tradition of recording finds and developed good relationships with finders and in particular among these, metal detectorists. Other areas, such as the North West, did not have systems in place for recording such finds.

A database was devised and put on the web in July 1999 to enable wider access to the information collated by the scheme. During the first year of the pilot scheme, over 13,500 objects were recorded. The scheme was very successful, but further funding was needed to extend the scheme nationally. Therefore, bids were successfully put forward to the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) to fund five more FLO posts plus an Outreach Officer post for eighteen months, starting from January–March 1999. The DCMS agreed to fund the existing posts during this period. The five new FLO posts were based in museums and archaeology services in Dorset and Somerset (one post covering two counties), Hampshire, Northamptonshire, Suffolk and Wales. The Outreach Officer was based at the British Museum, working alongside the Co-ordinator.

Shortly after this, further funding was applied for from the HLF to establish a comprehensive national scheme covering the whole of England and Wales. However, before awarding funding to extend the scheme nationally, the HLF required an independent evaluation of the work of the scheme and its impact. This delayed the progression of the application considerably and as an interim measure, while the evaluation was being undertaken, funding was ultimately secured from the DCMS and the HLF for the existing posts until September 2001. The HLF questioned the long-term sustainability of such an ambitious scheme, particularly in consideration of its funding. While a decision was being reached, funding for the existing posts was provided once more by the DCMS as an interim measure until March 2003.

However, in April 2002, the HLF decided to support the bid for three years starting in April 2003, bringing about the scheme as we know it today. As from April 2006 the scheme secured full funding from the DCMS, until March 2008. Administration of the scheme changed hands from MLA to the British Museum. Also in April 2006, the Portable Antiquities Scheme central unit became an official department within the BM, the Department of Portable Antiquities &amp; Treasure.

The scheme continues to grow and now consists of a network of:

*thirty-six FLOs
*a part-time illustrator
*six Finds Advisers
*an ICT Adviser
*a Resources Manager (formerly administrator)
*a Deputy Head and
*the Head of Portable Antiquities &amp; Treasure

The work of the scheme is supported by many temporary assistants and volunteers, working with FLOs and Finds Advisers.

A late medieval harness pendant found in Lincolnshire in October 2021 became the 1 millionth record logged on the scheme database.

<doc id="905012" wikidata="Q5604067" url="?curid=905012" title="Greenguard Environmental Institute">
<text>The Greenguard Environmental Institute (corporately styled &quot;GREENGUARD&quot;) is an industry-independent organization that aims to protect human health and improve quality of life by enhancing indoor air quality and reducing people’s exposure to chemicals and other pollutants. As an ISO-IEC Guide 65:1996 accredited, third-party certifying body, the Greenguard Environmental Institute certifies products and materials for low chemical emissions and serves as a public resource for choosing healthier products and materials for indoor environments. In 2011, UL Environment, a business unit of UL (Underwriters Laboratories) acquired Greenguard Environmental Institute.

The UL GREENGUARD Certification Program requires that products undergo independent, scientific testing and ongoing monitoring of their chemical emissions. Only products that meet UL Environment’s stringent emissions standards qualify for certification. These standards are based on established criteria from key public health agencies.

More than 10,000 products on the market are UL GREENGUARD Certified, representing over 350 manufacturers and 19 industries. The UL Sustainable Products Database, the organization&#x27;s online database of certified or validated products, helps people identify certified products and is searchable by product category, manufacturer, sustainable credits, product attributes, and certification type. GREENGUARD Certification is broadly recognized and accepted by sustainable building programs and building codes worldwide.

== History ==
The Greenguard Environmental Institute was founded in 2001 by indoor air quality scientist Dr. Marilyn Black. Her vision was to create a third-party product certifier that could educate consumers and industry professionals about the importance of good indoor air quality and low-emitting products.

=== Greenguard Indoor Air Quality Certification ===
The Greenguard Indoor Air Quality Certification was Greenguard’s first certification offering. Products that are Greenguard Indoor Air Quality Certified meet strict chemical emissions limits and are designed for use in office environments and other indoor spaces. Greenguard Indoor Air Quality Certification gives credence to manufacturers’ sustainability claims, backing them with empirical scientific data from an unbiased, third-party organization.

=== Greenguard Children &amp; Schools Certification (now GREENGUARD GOLD) ===
In 2005, the Greenguard Children &amp; Schools Certification was launched to address the indoor air quality needs of schools, daycares, and other sensitive environments in which children spend a lot of time. As such, it enforces stricter chemical emissions limits than the original certification. The Greenguard Children &amp; Schools standard is referenced by both the Collaborative for High Performance Schools (CHPS) and the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Building Rating System. In 2013, Greenguard Children &amp; Schools Certification was renamed GREENGUARD GOLD Certification.

<doc id="905013" wikidata="Q1248600" url="?curid=905013" title="Cathy Come Home">
<text>&quot;Cathy Come Home&quot; is a 1966 BBC television play about homelessness. It was written by Jeremy Sandford, produced by Tony Garnett and directed by Ken Loach. A 1998 &quot;Radio Times&quot; readers&#x27; poll voted it the &quot;best single television drama&quot; and a 2000 industry poll rated it as the second-best British television programme ever made. Filmed in a gritty, realistic drama documentary style, it was first broadcast on 16 November 1966 on BBC1. The play was shown in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot; anthology strand, which often tackled social issues.

==Plot==
The play tells the story of a young couple, Cathy (played by Carol White) and Reg (Ray Brooks), and their descent into poverty and homelessness. At the start of the film, Cathy leaves her parents&#x27; overcrowded rural home and hitchhikes to the city, where she finds work and meets Reg, a well-paid lorry driver. They fall in love, marry and rent a modern flat in a building that does not allow children. Cathy soon becomes pregnant and must stop working, and Reg is injured on the job and becomes unemployed. The loss of income and birth of baby Sean force them to leave their flat, and they are unable to find another affordable place to live that permits children.

They move in with Reg&#x27;s mother, until tensions develop between her and Cathy in the crowded flat. A kind elderly landlady, Mrs. Alley, rents to them for a while, during which time Cathy has another son, Stevie. Mrs. Alley even allows them to stay when they fall behind on the rent. However, she dies suddenly and an agent of her nephew and heir appears at the door demanding all the back rent, which they are unable to pay. Again Cathy and Reg go house hunting but are continually turned down as they can find nothing available that permits children. During this time Cathy gives birth to her third child, a girl they call Marlene. Their new landlord takes them to court and the judge rules against them. The family are evicted by bailiffs. The family then moves to a caravan parked in a camp where several other families are already living in caravans, but the local residents object to the camp and set it on fire, killing several children. Cathy, Reg and their children are forced into illegal squatting in a wrecked, abandoned building. They repeatedly try to get decent housing through the local council, but are not helped because of their many moves and the long list of other people also seeking housing assistance.

Cathy and Reg decide to separate temporarily so that Cathy and the children can move into an emergency homeless shelter where husbands are not allowed to stay. Reg leaves the area to seek employment. Cathy&#x27;s loneliness and frustration finally boil over and she becomes belligerent with the shelter authorities, who are often cold and judgmental towards the women living in the shelter. Cathy&#x27;s allotted time at the shelter expires while Reg is away, and she and her two remaining children (one having been sent to live with Reg&#x27;s mother) have nowhere to go. They go to a railway station, where Cathy&#x27;s children are taken away from her by social services.

==Cast==
==Production==
The play was written by Jeremy Sandford, produced by Tony Garnett and directed by Ken Loach, who went on to become a major figure in British film. Loach employed a realistic documentary style, using predominantly 16 mm film on location, which contrasted with the vast amount of BBC drama of the time, the bulk of which was entirely shot in a television studio. Union regulations of the time forced about ten minutes of &quot;Cathy Come Home&quot; to be shot in this way, with the material shot in a studio on electronic cameras being telerecorded and spliced into the film as required.

The cinematographer was Tony Imi, whose innovative use of a hand-held camera to take moving action shots and close-ups gave &quot;Cathy Come Home&quot; almost a feel of a current affairs broadcast and a realism which was rare in British television drama at the time. This produced shots some traditionalists thought &quot;not technically acceptable&quot;. Imi commented: &quot;I was stuck in a rut after working on &quot;Dr Finlay&#x27;s Casebook&quot; and &quot;Maigret&quot; – standard BBC productions. All of a sudden, with &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot; and Ken, there was a newness that fitted into the way I was thinking at the time.&quot;

Loach&#x27;s naturalistic style helped to heighten the play&#x27;s impact. Many scenes were improvised, and some include unknowing members of the public, such as the final scene in which Cathy&#x27;s children are taken from her at a railway station (none of the passers-by intervened).

The song that is played at the beginning and end of the film is a cover version of &quot;500 Miles&quot; by Sonny &amp; Cher.

==Broadcast==

After the first transmission in 1966, the play was repeated on BBC1 on 11 January 1967, 13 November 1968 and again on BBC2 on 11 August 1976. It was broadcast in the United States on National Educational Television (NET) on 28 March 1969, capitalizing on Carol White&#x27;s international success in &quot;Poor Cow&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Forget What&#x27;s&#x27;isname&quot; in 1967, and &quot;The Fixer&quot; in 1968. It was also screened by Channel 4 on 31 March 1993 as part of a season of programmes on homelessness, and by BBC Four in a season on the same subject in 2006. BBC Four also aired this drama on 5 and 11 June 2003 (shown as part of Time Shift). On 31 July 2016 it was repeated on BBC Four as part of a retrospective on 1966 and repeated again on BBC Four on 13 November 2016. In 2022 it was shown again on BBC Four as part of a retrospective on &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot;, then in May alongside an interview with Ken Loach.

==Reception==
The play broached issues that were not then widely discussed in the popular media, such as homelessness, unemployment, and the rights of mothers to keep their own children. It was watched by 12 million people – a quarter of the British population at the time – on its first broadcast. Its hard-hitting subject matter and highly realistic documentary style, new to British television, created a huge impact on its audience.

One commentator called it &quot;an ice-pick in the brain of all who saw it&quot;. The play produced a storm of phone calls to the BBC, and discussion in Parliament. For years afterwards Carol White was stopped in the street by people pressing money into her hand, convinced she must be actually homeless.

In a 2000 poll of industry professionals conducted by the British Film Institute to determine the BFI TV 100 of the 20th century, &quot;Cathy Come Home&quot; was voted second (the highest-placed drama on the list), behind the comedy &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;. In 2005 it was named by &quot;Broadcast&quot; as the UK&#x27;s most influential TV programme of all time.

==Impact==
In the light of public reaction to the film, and following a publicity campaign led by Willam Shearman and Iain Macleod highlighting the plight of the homeless, the charity Crisis was formed the following year in 1967.

By coincidence, another charity for the homeless, Shelter, was launched a few days after the first broadcast. Though it was not connected to the programme, &quot;the film alerted the public, the media, and the government to the scale of the housing crisis, and Shelter gained many new supporters.&quot;

However, Ken Loach has said that despite the public outcry following the play, it had little practical effect in reducing homelessness other than changing rules so that homeless fathers could stay with their wives and children in hostels. Indeed, housing policy was only considerably reformed over a decade later with the passing of the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977.

==Home media==
In 2003 the play was released on VHS and DVD by the British Film Institute with an audio commentary by Loach, and original production documentation (the BFI has screened the play on numerous occasions, including in a 2011 Ken Loach film festival). In 2011 the play was re-released on DVD by 2 Entertain with audio commentary by Loach. Along with other Loach films, it is available to watch on Loach&#x27;s YouTube channel. It is also available as a special feature on the 2011 Criterion Blu-ray and DVD release of &quot;Kes&quot;, another Ken Loach film.

==Theatrical adaptation==
To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the film, a theatrical adaptation of &quot;Cathy Come Home&quot; was staged at the Barbican Theatre in 2016. It starred Elle Payne as Cathy and Denholm Spurr as Reg.

<text>:&quot;If you are looking for the band that composed the hit song &#x27;74-&#x27;75 see The Connells&quot;

The Cornells were a 1960s Los Angeles band that played mostly surf music. Four of the five members had a parent who was a well-known celebrity.

The band appeared on the television show &quot;I&#x27;ve Got A Secret&quot; in 1963 with the secret &quot;We&#x27;re all the sons of Hollywood Celebrities&quot;. They played &quot;Caravan&quot; live on the show.

According to Richie Unterberger,&quot;Whatever interest this L. A. surf combo generates stems from the fact that future Moby Grape guitarist Peter Lewis was a member. (...) Lewis was the only member destined to make a mark on rock history.&quot;

==Members== 
*Peter Lewis, lead guitar; is the son of Loretta Young and screenwriter Tom Lewis. He was later a member of Moby Grape, and subsequently developed a career as a solo artist, which continues to this day.
*Bob Linkletter, rhythm guitar; son of Art Linkletter
*Jim O&#x27;Keefe, saxophone; son of Dennis O&#x27;Keefe, a famous All-American footballer and 1940s and &#x27;50s movie leading man
*Charlie Correll, drums; son of Charlie Correll, who portrayed Andy on the &quot;Amos and Andy&quot; radio program
*Tom Crumplar, bass; the only member without a famous parent

<text>Richard Say (born May 18, 1979) is a three-time Olympic and National record-holding swimmer from Canada. Say swam as a child for the Salmon Arm Sockeye Swim Club with his two brothers and two sisters. At the age of 18, he began attending the University of Victoria and started to swim seriously.

Say became a mainstay of the National Swim Team, starting in 1998. His career to date includes 20 national titles and Canadian records in five individual events – 100 free, 200 free, 400 free (scm), 200 free and 400 free (lcm) – not to mention the vast number of national relay records he has been involved in. He has competed for Canada at three Olympic Games (2000, 2004 and 2008), reaching the finals of the 200 freestyle in 2000 and 2004. He has been to four World Championships (2001, 2003, 2005 and 2007) where he was an integral part of Canada&#x27;s relays which swam in the finals.

At the 2004 World Short Course Championships, Say won three medals – a silver in the 200 free, and bronze in both the 100-metre freestyle and 4x100-metre freestyle relay, both in Canadian record time. At the Commonwealth Games (1998, 2002) he earned one silver medal and two bronze medals. He has been to two Pan Pacific Championships (1999, 2002), winning 3 bronze medals, all in relays and placing a career high 4th for the 200-metre freestyle. At the 1999 Pan American Games, he was a dual bronze medalist in the 400-metre freestyle and 4x200-metre free relay.

At the 2004 Olympics, Say created a minor controversy after the 4×200-metre freestyle relay immediately in the post-race interview which was aired live on national television, when he said that he was &quot;pissed off at not being able to make up for my teammates&#x27; mistakes&quot;. The other three team members - Brent Hayden, Brian Johns, and Andrew Hurd - expressed disappointment not in the effort, which broke the Canadian record by over 3.5 seconds, but only in the 5th-place finish which was out of the medals.

Say&#x27;s 4x200-metre freestyle relay, however, bounced back to win two silver medals at the 2005 World Championships in Montreal in 2005.

Since 2004, Say has been less successful, losing his national 200-metre freestyle title to Brent Hayden, from Vancouver, British Columbia. At the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, Australia, Say swam a world-class time of 1:48, but finished out of the medals in fourth place.

At the 2008 Summer Olympics, he was a member of the Canadian teams that finished sixth in the 4x100-metre freestyle relay and fifth in the 4x200-metre freestyle relay.

<doc id="905027" wikidata="Q685623" url="?curid=905027" title="Paul Konerko">
<text>Paul Henry Konerko ( ; born March 5, 1976) is an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a first baseman from 1997 to 2014, most prominently as a member of the Chicago White Sox, where he was a six-time American League All-Star and team captain for the 2005 World Series winning team. Konerko began his career with the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Cincinnati Reds. In 2014, Konerko was named the recipient of the prestigious Roberto Clemente Award.

==High school career==
Born in Providence, Rhode Island, to Henry (&quot;Hank&quot;) and Elena Konerko, Konerko is of Polish and Italian descent. At Chaparral High School in Scottsdale, Arizona, Konerko was named the &quot;Arizona Republic&quot;/&quot;Phoenix Gazette&quot; Player of the Year as a senior, after leading his team to a Class 4-A state championship. Konerko hit .558 in 1994, the school season record until Ike Davis, who later became a Major League first baseman, hit .559 in 2003. Konerko also held the school season record in doubles, with 18, until Davis hit 23 doubles in 2003. He also held the school career record in doubles (44), until Davis passed him with 48 doubles. As of 2014, he was the school&#x27;s all-time leader in home runs and RBI. Konerko was ranked the #1 catcher in the nation during his senior year in high school.

He signed a letter of intent to play college baseball at Arizona State.

==Professional career==

===Los Angeles Dodgers and Cincinnati Reds===
Konerko was drafted in the first round (13th overall) of the 1994 MLB draft by the Los Angeles Dodgers. Konerko had been on the radar of Eddie Bane, the special assistant to Dodgers general manager Fred Claire, since he was 13 years old.

On May 13, 1995, with the Single-A San Bernardino Spirit, he drove in the only run of a 21-inning game. It was the longest shutout in California League history. 

Konerko played for the Triple-A Albuquerque Dukes for the majority of the 1997 season, batting .323 with 37 home runs and 127 RBI in 130 games. He is one of four Dodgers position players to have been twice selected for the Dodgers organization&#x27;s &quot;Minor League Player of the Year&quot; award, along with Billy Ashley, Joc Pederson, and Gavin Lux.

On September 8, 1997, Konerko made his major league debut with the Dodgers against the Florida Marlins as a pinch hitter, hitting a single off Marlins pitcher Dennis Cook for his first career hit. He would finish with one hits in six at-bats with a walk in six major league games with the Dodgers to close out the season. In 1998, Konerko played in 49 games with the Dodgers, batting .215 with four home runs and 16 RBI.

On July 4, 1998, Konerko was traded along with left-handed pitcher Dennys Reyes to the Cincinnati Reds for All-Star closer Jeff Shaw. Konerko played 26 games with the Reds, batting .219 with three home runs and 13 RBI.

===Chicago White Sox===

====1999–2005: early years, World Series champion====
On November 11, 1998, Konerko was traded by the Reds to the White Sox for Mike Cameron. Konerko became a consistent hitter and power threat upon his arrival to the White Sox, hitting for a .294 average with 24 home runs and 81 RBI in 142 games during his first season with Chicago in 1999.

In 2000, Konerko finished the season batting .298 with 21 home runs and 97 RBI in 143 games. The White Sox finished with a 95–67 record, and made the playoffs for the first time since 1993. Konerko made his first postseason appearance that year, when the White Sox lost to the Seattle Mariners in the 2000 American League Division Series (ALDS). The Mariners swept the series in three games, and in nine at-bats, Konerko did not record a hit. He got on base once via a walk.

Konerko continued to hit consistently in 2001, hitting .282 with 32 home runs and 99 RBI in 156 games, reaching the 30-homer plateau for the first time in his career. The next season, he reached 100 RBI for the first time, finishing with a .304 average, 27 home runs and 104 RBI in 151 games. This culminated in his first All-Star appearance at Miller Park, where he also participated in the Home Run Derby, hitting 12 home runs in the two rounds he appeared in. In the 2002 All-Star Game, Konerko hit a two-run double for the American League in the top of the seventh inning to grab the lead. Broadcasters Tim McCarver and Joe Buck stated that if the American League had won the game, Konerko would have been the MVP; however, the game ended in a tie and the MVP was not awarded.

Konerko suffered a thumb injury in 2003 that reduced his playing time to 137 games and resulted in a drop in offensive production. He finished the season batting just .234 with 18 home runs and 65 RBI. 

In 2004, Konerko bounced back in a big way, eclipsing the 40 home run mark for the first time in his career. In 155 games, he hit .277 while setting career highs with 41 home runs and 117 RBI. Konerko finished 16th in the MVP voting that year as the White Sox finished second in the division to the Minnesota Twins. 
In 2005, Konerko and the White Sox got off to a hot start with a 17–7 record at the end of April and never looked back. They became only the fifth team in Major League history to go wire-to-wire, staying in first place every day of the season, and the first team since the 1990 Cincinnati Reds to do so. Konerko finished the season batting .283 with 40 home runs, his second time hitting the mark, and 100 RBI in 158 games as the White Sox won the division for the first time since 2000. 

Konerko continued hitting hot into the playoffs with a home run in Games 1 and 3 of the ALDS against the Boston Red Sox. With Konerko&#x27;s help, the White Sox swept the defending champions in three games to move on to their first ALCS since 1993. The White Sox defeated the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in the American League Championship Series (ALCS). After going 0-for-4 in Game 1 and 1-for-4 in Game 2, Konerko went 3-for-4 with three RBI in the Game 3 against the Angels. Two of the RBIs came from a home run in the first inning. In Game 4, Konerko was 1-for-4 with 3 RBI on another first inning home run, the second in as many nights. His Game 4 home run set a franchise record for most home runs in a postseason and all-time with his fourth career postseason home run, passing Ted Kluszewski&#x27;s three home runs in the 1959 World Series. In Game 5, Konerko went 1-for-5 with another RBI. He was named the ALCS MVP on the strength of a .268 batting average, two home runs and seven RBI, becoming the first, and as of the 2023 season, only White Sox player to receive the award. He said, &quot;I think you could split this four ways&quot;, referring to his feeling that the MVP should be awarded to the White Sox starting pitchers who pitched four consecutive complete games in the ALCS.

In Game 2 of the 2005 World Series, Konerko hit the first grand slam in White Sox World Series history to put the White Sox ahead 6–4. It was also the first grand slam in postseason history to give a team the lead when trailing in the seventh inning or later. He became the 18th player in Major League history to hit a grand slam in the World Series and the first since Tino Martinez in 1998. Those were Konerko&#x27;s only RBIs of the World Series, but they were critical in giving the White Sox the momentum to complete a four-game sweep of the Houston Astros. His RBI total was also the highest on the White Sox during the series. Konerko caught the final out for every one of the series-clinching games throughout the playoffs. Konerko hit .265 with five home runs and 15 RBI during the White Sox&#x27; championship run, all White Sox postseason records.

====2006–2014: team captain====
Following the 2005 World Series victory, Konerko signed a five-year $60 million deal with the White Sox on November 30, 2005 after reportedly turning down more lucrative offers from the Los Angeles Angels and the Baltimore Orioles.

With the departure of Frank Thomas, Konerko became the new official face of the White Sox franchise. Konerko concluded the 2006 season batting .313 with 35 home runs and 113 RBI in 152 games, helping him rank in the top 10 for total home runs over the past three seasons, after hitting over 40 home runs in 2004 and 2005.

In 2008, Konerko again injured his thumb in the first half of the season, resulting in him being limited to 122 games. He hit .240 with 22 home runs and 62 RBI. On September 18, 2008, Konerko became the last opposing player to hit a home run at Yankee Stadium in the ninth inning of a 9–2 White Sox loss. Konerko and the White Sox defeated the Minnesota Twins in a dramatic 1–0 victory in the tie-breaker game to decide the AL Central winner and move on to the playoffs. In the 2008 American League Division Series, Konerko hit two home runs and drove in two runs in a quick exit for the White Sox, who lost the series to the eventual American League Champion Tampa Bay Rays in four games. 

On April 13, 2009, Konerko connected back to back with Jermaine Dye for the 300th home run of both players&#x27; respective careers off of Detroit Tigers pitcher Zach Miner. This was the first time that this had ever happened in Major League history; where two players had hit a century milestone home run in one game, let alone back to back.

On July 7, 2009, Konerko was 3-for-4 with three home runs and 7 RBIs in a 10–6 win against the Cleveland Indians. It was the first time in his big league career that he hit three home runs in a game. He is also the only White Sox player to accomplish that at U.S. Cellular Field.

On July 10, 2010, Konerko was announced to replace Twins first baseman Justin Morneau at the 2010 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. This was the fourth All-Star selection of his career. Near the end of the 2010 season, Konerko was hit in the face by Minnesota Twins pitcher Carl Pavano. This resulted in major controversy. White Sox pitcher Mark Buehrle returned the favor in the next inning hitting Twins first baseman Michael Cuddyer. Both teams then received a warning from the head umpire and no further incidents occurred. Refusing to leave the game, Konerko hit a solo home run on the first pitch he saw in his next at bat against Pavano.

Konerko finished the 2010 season with 39 home runs, his most since 2005 and the third-highest total of his career, as well as a .312 average and 111 RBI in 149 games. Additionally, he was in fifth place in the year&#x27;s MVP voting, the highest finish of his career to date.

On December 8, 2010, Konerko re-signed with the White Sox on a three-year, $37.5 million contract. On June 1, 2011, Konerko hit his 377th career home run in a game against the Boston Red Sox, passing former White Sox player Carlton Fisk on the all-time home run list.

On June 10, 2011, Konerko hit a home run in a game against the Oakland Athletics, setting the franchise record for consecutive games with an extra base hit at nine games.
 On June 20, 2011, Konerko hit his 385th career home run in a game against the Chicago Cubs, passing former White Sox player Harold Baines on the all-time home run list. On June 21, 2011, Konerko continued his hot June when he homered in a game against the Cubs, marking his fifth straight game with a home run, becoming the fifth player in White Sox history to hit a home run in five consecutive games. The other five are Greg Luzinski, Ron Kittle, Frank Thomas (twice), Carlos Lee, and most recently A. J. Pierzynski in 2012. Konerko made it onto his fifth All-Star team after winning the Final Vote contest for the American League.

On August 23, 2011, Konerko recorded his 2,000th hit in the top of the eighth inning against the Angels.

Konerko finished the season with 31 home runs, 105 RBIs, and a .300 batting average in 149 games, the fifth time in his career that he finished with 30 home runs and 100+ RBIs.

In October 2011, White Sox general manager Kenny Williams admitted that he briefly considered naming Konerko player-manager for Chicago after the departure of manager Ozzie Guillén. However, Williams never discussed the possibility with Konerko. Former White Sox player Robin Ventura was named manager for the upcoming 2012 season. There has not been a player-manager in Major League Baseball since Pete Rose served in the capacity for the Cincinnati Reds in 1986.

In November 2011, Konerko was inducted into the Arizona Fall League Hall of Fame along with Phillies first baseman Ryan Howard.

On April 25, 2012, Konerko hit his 400th career home run, passing Al Kaline and Andrés Galarraga and becoming the 48th player in Major League history to hit 400 home runs. Konerko was named the American League Player of the Week for the week of April 23–29. He hit .435 with three home runs and 4 RBI. He led the AL in slugging and total bases that week.

Konerko continued his hot hitting into the month of May as he racked up his second American League Player of the Week award of the season for the week of May 23–29. He hit .583 with three home runs, 10 RBI, and a 14-game hitting streak, including his 400th career home run as a member of the White Sox, becoming only the second player in franchise history to hit 400 home runs, Frank Thomas being the first.

On July 1, 2012, Konerko was elected by his peers, along with teammates Adam Dunn, Jake Peavy and Chris Sale to the 83rd All-Star Game in Kansas City. It was his sixth All-star appearance and his third in three years.
Konerko&#x27;s production declined in 2013, as he finished the season hitting .244 with 12 home runs and 54 RBI in 126 games, his lowest number of both home runs and RBI since joining the White Sox. On December 4, 2013, Konerko re-signed with the White Sox to a one-year, $2.5 million contract.

Throughout the 2014 season, Konerko was honored and given a variety of farewell gifts during road games from various teams throughout baseball, including the Twins, Yankees, Indians, Royals, and crosstown rival Cubs.

On April 23, 2014, Konerko doubled off of Detroit Tigers pitcher Justin Miller to break Frank Thomas&#x27; franchise total bases record with his 3,950th total base.

On May 7, 2014, Konerko played in his final game against the crosstown rival Cubs. Konerko went 2-for-3, including a bases-clearing three-run double in the bottom of the fifth inning to put the Sox in the lead for good as they went on to win 8–3. Konerko would finish his career with 20 home runs against the Cubs. Konerko would hit his 439th and final home run on the July 4 in a home game against the Seattle Mariners, the same team that he hit his first Major League home run against in 1998, in a 7–1 win for the White Sox.

During the final homestand of the season, Konerko was honored during a pregame ceremony on September 27, 2014, before a game against the Kansas City Royals. A statue of Konerko out in the left field concourse, adjacent to the Frank Thomas statue, was revealed during the ceremony and the fan that caught his 2005 World Series grand slam delivered the ball to Konerko as a parting gift. Konerko played in his final game on September 28, 2014 in the last game of the season at home. Konerko went 0-for-3 before being replaced in the top of the sixth inning by Andy Wilkins and leaving the field to a standing ovation from the crowd of 32,266. Upon his retirement, Konerko finished in the top three in most offensive categories with the White Sox with 432 home runs (second), 2,292 hits (third), 1,383 RBIs (second), 406 doubles (third), and 4,010 total bases (first). Konerko is also the White Sox postseason leader in both home runs and RBI with 7 and 17 respectively.

Aaron Rowand, one of Konerko&#x27;s teammates, praised the slugger&#x27;s leadership abilities. &quot;He’s definitely very even-keeled, but stay out of his way if he has a rough game. He’ll blow up a little bit. He knows this organization, and most of us have played together for quite some time now. Everybody looks up to Paul as a leader and team captain. He does a good job with it and brings guys along for the ride.”

==Retirement==

Konerko retired on September 28, 2014 after spending 18 years in the Major League Baseball, the last 16 of which were with the White Sox. All but 81 of Konerko&#x27;s 2,349 career MLB games were played with the White Sox. Konerko was the last member of the 2005 champion White Sox left on the team at the time of his retirement. It was announced on Paul Konerko Day that his number (#14) would be retired and the statue of Konerko was revealed in the left field concourse, becoming the ninth player to be honored with a statue by the White Sox. On October 24, 2014, Konerko was named the co-winner of the Roberto Clemente Award, sharing the honor with Jimmy Rollins of the Philadelphia Phillies. By winning the award, Konerko became the first member of the White Sox to do so. On May 23, 2015, prior to a game against the Minnesota Twins at U.S. Cellular Field, Konerko became the tenth White Sox player to have his number retired. His #14 is the eleventh overall number retired by the team as Jackie Robinson&#x27;s #42 was retired by the whole MLB in 1997.

In May 2016, the White Sox celebrated U.S. Cellular Field&#x27;s 25th anniversary by introducing the 25 most memorable moments in the park&#x27;s history. In a bracket style competition, Konerko&#x27;s grand slam in Game 2 of the 2005 World Series was voted the best moment in the park&#x27;s 25-year history, as it was deemed as an iconic moment in the breaking of the franchise&#x27;s 88 year championship drought.

==Career statistics==
In 2,349 games over 18 seasons, Konerko posted a .279 batting average (2,340-for-8,393) with 1,162 runs, 410 doubles, 439 home runs, 1412 RBI, 921 bases on balls, .354 on-base percentage and .486 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .995 fielding percentage as a first baseman.

==Hall of Fame eligibility==
In 2020, his first year of Hall of Fame eligibility, Konerko received 2.5% of votes, below the 5% threshold, and has been subsequently removed from future ballots.

==Personal life==
Konerko married Jennifer Wells in 2004. They have two sons and a daughter: Nicholas, Owen, and Amelia.

A fan of the band Metallica, Konerko&#x27;s walk-up music throughout most of his tenure with the White Sox was the song &quot;Harvester of Sorrow&quot; from Metallica&#x27;s 1988 album &quot;...And Justice For All.&quot; The song became synonymous with Konerko in Chicago and his looming presence at the plate.

<text>James Conlon (born March 18, 1950) is an American conductor. He is currently the music director of Los Angeles Opera and principal conductor of the RAI National Symphony Orchestra.

==Early years==
Conlon grew up in a family of five children on Cherry Street in Douglaston, Queens, New York City. His mother, Angeline L. Conlon, was a freelance writer. His father was an assistant to the New York City Commissioner of Labor in the Robert F. Wagner administration. His siblings were not musically inclined, nor were his parents. When he was eleven, he went to a production of &quot;La traviata&quot; by the North Shore Opera. He asked for music lessons and became a treble (boy soprano) in a children&#x27;s chorus in an opera company in Queens. He dreamed about being a tenor, then a baritone, and even wanted to sing the role of &quot;Carmen&quot; at one point. Finally it dawned on him that the only way to do everything in opera was to become an operatic conductor.

==Education==
Conlon entered the High School of Music &amp; Art at the age of fifteen and at eighteen he was accepted into the Aspen Music Festival and School conducting program, and in September, 1968 he entered the Juilliard School of music. In 1970, the Juilliard Orchestra took an educational tour to Europe and he was invited to Spoleto the next year as an assistant doing work as a répétiteur, coach and chorus conductor. During that time, he conducted one performance of &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;. He recalled that he had fallen in love with this opera at a young age, and had dreamed that it would be the first opera he would conduct.

In 1972, at a scheduled Juilliard production of &quot;La bohème&quot; directed by Michael Cacoyannis, conductor Thomas Schippers suddenly withdrew. At the time, Maria Callas was doing a series of master classes at Juilliard and heard Conlon in rehearsal. She suggested to Juilliard&#x27;s president, Peter Mennin, that Conlon should step in to conduct.

==Career==
Conlon received the conducting award of the American National Orchestral Association, and in 1974 became the youngest conductor engaged for the New York Philharmonic Orchestra&#x27;s subscription series. In 1976 he made his Metropolitan Opera debut and his British debut with the Scottish Opera, and in 1979 he debuted at Covent Garden. He was named director of the Cincinnati May Festival in 1979, a position he retained until 2016. After engagements with the Paris Opéra, Maggio Musicale in Florence, Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra and the Chicago Lyric Opera, Conlon became chief conductor of the in 1989. In 1996, he was appointed music director of the Opéra National de Paris.

Since his New York Philharmonic debut in 1974 at the invitation of Pierre Boulez, Conlon has appeared with virtually every major North American and European orchestra. He has also appeared with many of the world&#x27;s major opera companies, including Teatro alla Scala (Milan), the Royal Opera at Covent Garden (London), the Lyric Opera of Chicago, and the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino (Florence). Associated for almost 30 years with the Metropolitan Opera, where he made his debut in 1976, he has conducted more than 250 performances there, leading a wide range of works from the Italian, German, French, Russian and Czech repertoires.

Conlon has held several major European posts, including principal conductor of the Rotterdam Philharmonic (1983–1991), &quot;Generalmusikdirektor&quot; (GMD) of the City of Cologne, Germany (1989–2002), where he was simultaneously GMD of the Gürzenich Orchestra and the Cologne Opera, and principal conductor of the Paris National Opera (1995–2004), where his Paris tenure was the longest of any conductor there since 1939. In 2015, he was named principal conductor of the RAI National Symphony Orchestra.

==Career in the US==
Conlon has been music director of the Los Angeles Opera since the 2006–2007 season. His work there has included a series called &quot;Recovered Voices&quot;, a multi-year project during which Conlon presented operas by composers affected by the Third Reich. The series included a double-bill of Alexander von Zemlinsky&#x27;s &quot;Der Zwerg&quot; and Viktor Ullmann&#x27;s &quot;Der zerbrochene Krug&quot;, and operas by composers such as Schreker and Braunfels. Conlon has conducted seven of Wagner&#x27;s operas with Los Angeles Opera, including the first-ever Los Angeles performances &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; in 2008–2009. In September 2021, the company announced the newest extension of Conlon&#x27;s contract as music director, through the 2024–2025 season. In March 2024, Los Angeles Opera announced that Conlon is to conclude his tenure as its music director at the close of the 2025-2026 season, and subsequently to take the title of conductor laureate.

Conlon&#x27;s tenure as music director of the Cincinnati May Festival, from 1979 to 2016, was the longest such tenure in the festival&#x27;s history. He served as music director of the Ravinia Festival from 2005 to 2015. In November 2020, the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra announced the appointment of Conlon as its artistic advisor, effective with the 2021–2022 season, for a period of three seasons, an unusual appointment in that Conlon had not conducted the orchestra prior to the announcement. Conlon conducted his first concert with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra in October 2021.

==Composers from the Holocaust era==
In an effort to raise public consciousness to the significance of works of composers whose lives and compositions were affected by the Holocaust, Conlon has devoted himself to extensive programming of this music in North America and Europe. This includes the works of such composers as Alexander von Zemlinsky, Viktor Ullmann, Pavel Haas, Kurt Weill, Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Karl Amadeus Hartmann, Erwin Schulhoff, and Ernst Krenek. In addition to &quot;Recovered Voices&quot; at Los Angeles Opera, each summer when he was music director of the Ravinia Festival, Conlon presented a different composer from this group with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He has highlighted works of Viktor Ullmann, Erwin Schulhoff, and Alexander von Zemlinsky thus far. A production of Ullman&#x27;s &quot;Der Kaiser von Atlantis&quot;, conceived by Conlon, has traveled extensively since its first showing in New York. Produced in cooperation with the Juilliard School, it has since been reprised at the Spoleto Festival in Italy, the Ravinia Festival, in cooperation with the New World Symphony Orchestra, the Houston Grand Opera, with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at Temple Sholom in Chicago and the Los Angeles Philharmonic, where it was performed in 2004 at the Wilshire Boulevard Temple.

In 2021, Conlon delivered a TED (conference) Talk: &quot;Resurrecting Forbidden Music.&quot;

==Recordings==
Conlon has recorded extensively for the EMI, Erato, Capriccio and Sony Classical labels. He made his first recording for Telarc of the world premiere of Franz Liszt&#x27;s &quot;St. Stanislaus&quot; oratorio, released in January 2004. A champion of the works of Alexander Zemlinsky, he has made nine recordings of the composer&#x27;s operas and orchestral works with the Gürzenich Orchestra-Cologne Philharmonic for EMI. Several of these recordings individually have earned prestigious international awards, and in October 2002, the series was awarded the 2002 ECHO Classic Award for &quot;Editorial Achievement of the Year.&quot; Conlon has also inaugurated a new series of 20th century works with Capriccio, including a CD of works by Erwin Schulhoff with the Bayerischer Rundfunk, and a CD/DVD of the works of Viktor Ullmann with the Gürzenich Orchestra, which won the Preis der deutschen Schallplattenkritik (German Record Critics Award for Excellence). His other Capriccio recordings include the works of Karl Amadeus Hartmann and Dmitri Shostakovich with violinist Vladimir Spivakov and the Cologne Philharmonic. His most recent recording is a CD of works by Bohuslav Martinů with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra on Capriccio.

==Television==
PBS aired a series of six shows hosted by Conlon entitled &quot;Encore&quot; during the spring of 2006, part of an ongoing series of documentaries on his work with the finalists of the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, which have also included &quot;Playing on the Edge&quot; and &quot;Hearing Ear to Ear with James Conlon&quot;. Among his other recent television appearances on PBS are, &quot;Concerto&quot;, six half-hour shows hosted by Conlon, and Cincinnati May Festival 2000.

==Film==
Conlon has conducted the orchestra for Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; (2006), a film version in English of Mozart&#x27;s opera, reset during World War I, but otherwise very faithful to the original plot. The film has been released in Europe, but, as of April 2010, not in the United States, nor has it been shown on American television.

Conlon adapted, arranged, and conducted the score for the 1995 film production of Madame Butterfly.

<doc id="905037" wikidata="Q300989" url="?curid=905037" title="L-DOPA">
<text>-DOPA, also known as -3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine and used medically as levodopa, is made and used as part of the normal biology of some plants and animals, including humans. Humans, as well as a portion of the other animals that utilize -DOPA, make it via biosynthesis from the amino acid -tyrosine.

-DOPA is the precursor to the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline), which are collectively known as catecholamines. Furthermore, -DOPA itself mediates neurotrophic factor release by the brain and CNS. In some plant families (of the order Caryophyllales), -DOPA is the central precursor of a biosynthetic pathway that produces a class of pigments called betalains.

-DOPA can be manufactured and in its pure form is sold as a drug with the &quot;levodopa&quot;. Trade names include Sinemet, Pharmacopa, Atamet, and Stalevo. As a drug, it is used in the clinical treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease and dopamine-responsive dystonia.

-DOPA has a counterpart with opposite chirality, -DOPA. As is true for many molecules, the human body produces only one of these isomers (the -DOPA form). The enantiomeric purity of -DOPA may be analyzed by determination of the optical rotation or by chiral thin-layer chromatography.

==Biological role==

-DOPA is produced from the amino acid -tyrosine by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase. -DOPA can act as an -tyrosine mimetic and be incorporated into proteins by mammalian cells in place of -tyrosine, generating protease-resistant and aggregate-prone proteins &quot;in vitro&quot; and may contribute to neurotoxicity with chronic -DOPA administration.
It is also the precursor for the monoamine or catecholamine neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline). Dopamine is formed by the decarboxylation of -DOPA by aromatic -amino acid decarboxylase (AADC).

-DOPA can be directly metabolized by catechol-&quot;O&quot;-methyl transferase to 3-&quot;O&quot;-methyldopa, and then further to vanillactic acid. This metabolic pathway is nonexistent in the healthy body, but becomes important after peripheral -DOPA administration in patients with Parkinson&#x27;s disease or in the rare cases of patients with AADC enzyme deficiency.

-Phenylalanine, -tyrosine, and -DOPA are all precursors to the biological pigment melanin. The enzyme tyrosinase catalyzes the oxidation of -DOPA to the reactive intermediate dopaquinone, which reacts further, eventually leading to melanin oligomers. In addition, tyrosinase can convert tyrosine directly to -DOPA in the presence of a reducing agent such as ascorbic acid.

==History==
-dopa was first islolated from the seeds of the &quot;Vicia faba&quot; or &quot;broad bean&quot; plant in 1913 by Swiss biochemist Markus Guggenheim.

The 2001 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was also related to -DOPA: the Nobel Committee awarded one-quarter of the prize to William S. Knowles for his work on chirally catalysed hydrogenation reactions, the most noted example of which was used for the synthesis of -DOPA.

== Other organisms ==
=== Marine adhesion ===
-DOPA is a key compound in the formation of marine adhesive proteins, such as those found in mussels. It is believed to be responsible for the water-resistance and rapid curing abilities of these proteins. -DOPA may also be used to prevent surfaces from fouling by bonding antifouling polymers to a susceptible substrate. The versatile chemistry of -DOPA can be exploited in nanotechnology. For example, DOPA-containing self-assembling peptides were found to form functional nanostructures, adhesives and gels.

=== Plants and in the environment ===
In plants, L-DOPA functions as an allelochemical which inhibits the growth of certain species, and is produced and secreted by a few legume species such as the broad bean &quot;Vicia faba&quot; and the velvet bean &quot;Mucuna pruriens&quot;. Its effect is strongly dependent on the pH and the reactivity of iron in the soil.

== Use as a medication and supplement ==
-DOPA is used medically under the name &quot;levodopa&quot; in the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease and certain other medical conditions. It is usually used in combination with a peripherally selective aromatic -amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD) inhibitor such as carbidopa or benserazide. These agents increase the strength and duration of levodopa. Combination formulations include levodopa/carbidopa and levodopa/benserazide, as well as levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone.

-DOPA is found in high amounts in &quot;Mucuna pruriens&quot; (velvet bean) and is available and used over-the-counter as a supplement.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Mexican/Mexican-American Album was an award presented to recording artists for quality albums in the Mexican music genre at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

Since its inception, the award category has had several name changes. From 1984 to 1991 the award was known as Best Mexican-American Performance. From 1992 to 1994 it was awarded as Best Mexican-American Album. In 1995 it returned to the title Best Mexican-American Performance. From 1996 to 1998 it was awarded as Best Mexican-American/Tejano Music Performance. In 1999, the category name was changed to Best Mexican-American Music Performance, and in 2000 it returned to the title Best Mexican-American Performance once again. From 2001 to 2008 the award was presented as Best Mexican/Mexican-American Album. In 2009, the category was split into two new fields: Best Norteño Album and Best Regional Mexican Album.

Mexican-American artist Flaco Jiménez is the most-awarded performer in the category with four wins, twice as a solo performer and twice as member of Texas Tornados and Los Super Seven. He is followed by fellow Mexican-American performer Pepe Aguilar with three winning albums and by American singers Vikki Carr and Linda Ronstadt, Mexican singers Luis Miguel and Joan Sebastian, and bands La Mafia and Los Lobos, with two wins each. Mexican ranchera performer Vicente Fernández was the most nominated artist without a win with ten unsuccessful nominations.

<text>Lin Dan (; born 14 October 1983) is a Chinese badminton player. He is a two-time Olympic gold medallist, five-time World champion, two-time World Cup champion, two-time Asian games gold medalist, four-time Asian Champion, as well as a six-time All England champion. Widely regarded as the greatest badminton player of all time, by the age of 28 Lin had completed the &quot;Super Grand Slam&quot;, having won the full set of all nine major titles in the badminton world of his time: Olympic Games, World Championships, World Cup, Thomas Cup, Sudirman Cup, Year-end Finals, Asian Games, and Asian Championships, becoming the third player to achieve this feat after Ge Fei and Gu Jun.

Of the 9 major events, he had won at least 2 of each events except the Year-end Finals where he won once in his only time participating in that event. He also became the first men&#x27;s singles player to retain the Olympic gold medal by winning in 2008 and successfully defending his title in 2012.

Lin was dubbed &quot;Super Dan&quot; by opponent Peter Gade after winning the 2004 All England Open final, and the nickname has since been widely used by his fans as well as the media to refer to him, in recognition of his achievements. He was inducted to BWF Badminton Hall of Fame on 26 May 2023.

==Early life==
Lin was born in Fujian, China. At a young age, Lin was encouraged to learn to play the piano by his parents, and to be a pianist. However, he chose to play badminton instead. Having started his training at the age of five, he was scouted by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Sports Team after winning the National Junior Championships aged twelve, and was enlisted into the Chinese National Badminton Team in 2001, when he was 18.

==Career==
===Junior events===
Lin emerged as a winner in the 2000 Asian Junior Championships in both the team and the singles events. He was also a member of the winning Chinese team and a boys&#x27; singles semi-finalist in the 2000 World Junior Championships.

===2001–2003: Senior debut and Four tour titles===
2001 marked the start of then 18 year-old Lin&#x27;s professional career. In his first final, at the Asian Championships, he was thrashed by compatriot Xia Xuanze. He then entered his first final in the IBF Grand Prix event at the Denmark Open, losing to Bao Chunlai.

In 2002, Lin took his first title at the Korea Open. He was a member of China&#x27;s 2002 Thomas Cup squad which defeated Sweden (5–0), Denmark (3–2), and South Korea (4–1) to reach the semi-finals. However, Lin didn&#x27;t play in the semi-final tie against Malaysia, which saw China&#x27;s team tumble to a 1–3 defeat. Lin participated in another four tournaments without coming close to victory. He was knocked out in the first round of the Singapore, and Indonesia Opens, second round of the Denmark Open, and third round of the China Open. In October, Lin was defeated in the semi-finals of the Asian Games team competition which ended China&#x27;s hope of a team gold medal.

Lin started the 2003 season with a third round defeat in the All England Open. He reached a final later in the year at the Japan Open but was beaten by his compatriot Xia Xuanze once again. Lin then made his inaugural debut in the World Championships in Birmingham, England. He breezed past Per-Henrik Croona and Przemysław Wacha in the first two rounds, but was beaten by Xia again in his third round match. After the world meet, he was eliminated in the semi-finals of the Singapore Open, third round of the Indonesia Open, and second round of the Malaysia Open. However, Lin ended the season strongly by capturing the Denmark, Hong Kong, and China Opens, and finishing runner-up at the German Open.

===2004: World #1, All England and Thomas Cup champions===
Lin had a good start to 2004, earning the BWF&#x27;s number one world ranking for the first time in February. He helped China win the qualifying round of Thomas Cup and then captured the Swiss Open. He won his first ever All England Open title by beating Peter Gade in the final. He reached the semi-final of the Japan Open before going off to Jakarta, Indonesia in May for the Thomas Cup campaign.

In Thomas Cup, Lin helped China to an excellent start in which they thrashed United States and defending champion Indonesia 5–0 respectively to enter the quarter-finals. Lin then defeated Shoji Sato and Lee Hyun-il in quarter and semi-finals ties against Japan and South Korea respectively, each ending in 3–0 wins for China. In the final, he beat Peter Gade in straight games to give China the lead before the Chinese team eventually won three matches to one. China thus took the crown, ending a 14 years drought in the tournament.

Lin suffered setbacks later in the 2004 season when he was ousted in the quarter-finals of the Malaysia Open, and was reported to have a leg injury in mid-July, prior to the Olympic Games. Lin &quot;crashed&quot; in his first Olympic Games when, as the first seed, he was ousted early by Singapore&#x27;s Ronald Susilo, who claimed Lin was &quot;too eager to win&quot;. However, Lin bounced back with three titles at the Denmark, German, and China Opens, and ended the season as a semi-finalist at the Indonesia Open.

===2005: Sudirman and World Cup success===
Lin retained his number one world ranking during 2005, winning his second German and Hong Kong Open titles, as well as the Japan Open, China Masters, and World Cup tournaments. He also helped China recapture the Sudirman Cup (combined men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s team championship) when it shut-out both defending champion South Korea in the semi-finals and Indonesia in the final.

Lin failed to retain his All England title, losing a three set final to teammate Chen Hong, and he was beaten in the final of the Malaysia Open by another rising star, Lee Chong Wei. In his bid to capture his first BWF World title at Anaheim California, he beat Kennevic Asuncion, Shoji Sato, Lee Hyun-il, and Peter Gade in succession to reach the final. There he was decisively beaten by a peak-form Taufik Hidayat. Lin was also eliminated in the semi-finals of the Singapore Open and the quarter-finals of the China Open.

===2006: World Champion, Second All England and Thomas Cup triumph===
Lin started the season by reaching the semi-finals of the German Open, and had a same result in China Masters and China Open. He failed to win the Malaysia Open in June, which saw his opponent Lee Chong Wei produce a superb display to save the title after being 13–20 down in the deciding game, and also lost to Taufik Hidayat in Asian Games final.

However, he won six individual titles in the season. He recaptured the All England Open, and won the Chinese Taipei, Macau, Hong Kong, and Japan Opens. Most significantly, in Madrid, Spain that September he won his first world title after beating his compatriot Bao Chunlai in the final.

In May, Lin and his teammates had extended China&#x27;s Thomas Cup reign by shutting out Denmark 3–0 for a second consecutive title. In October, he won his second World Cup men&#x27;s singles title.

===2007: Consecutive World title, Third All England and Second Sudirman Cup===
Lin Dan entered 2007 with a loss to South Korea&#x27;s Park Sung-hwan in the round of 16 at the Malaysia Open. A week later, he captured the Korea Open by defeating Chinese teammate Chen Jin in the final. He went on to win the German Open and then the All England championships again, crushing compatriot Chen Yu 21–13, 21–12. In June, Lin Dan was part of the Chinese Sudirman Cup team that retained the cup after beating Indonesia 3–0 in the final at Glasgow, Scotland. Later in the season Lin defeated Wong Choong Hann of Malaysia and became the China Masters champion for 2007. In August, Lin extended his reign as the World Champion when he beat Indonesia&#x27;s Sony Dwi Kuncoro 21–11, 22–20 in the final of the tournament held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Lin Dan thus became the first man since Yang Yang to win back to back World Championships. He then won his third Denmark Open title, and ended the year by claiming his fourth Hong Kong Open title.

===2008: Olympic gold, Third Thomas Cup and Controversies===

Lin started the season with a defeat in the final of the Korea Open to Lee Hyun-il. It was a match filled with controversy as Lin had a scuffle with South Korea&#x27;s coach Li Mao after a line call dispute. Lin refused to apologise and received no punishment from Badminton World Federation (BWF) after its probe of the altercation. In March, he suffered another defeat to his compatriot Chen Jin in the final of the All England Open, which was followed by press accusations that Lin &quot;gave&quot; the match to Chen in order to increase Chen&#x27;s ranking points for Olympic qualification (which placed stringent limits on the number of participants from any one country). In the following week, Lin won his first Swiss Open. At the Asian Championships, Lin was again accused of helping his compatriot when his loss to Chen Jin in the semi-finals ensured Chen&#x27;s qualification for the Olympic Games.

On 10 April 2008, Lin was involved in yet another controversy when he struck coach Ji Xinpeng in front of his teammates and the media during an intra-squad tournament prior to the Thomas Cup. The incident was allegedly triggered by his unhappiness with Ji&#x27;s arrangement of the starting line-up for the tournament. Despite the episode, in May Lin proceeded to win each match he played in the Thomas Cup until China&#x27;s semi-finals clash with Malaysia when he lost rather tamely to Lee Chong Wei. However, China still managed to reach the final by edging Malaysia 3–2, then retained the cup against South Korea with Lin&#x27;s win at first singles helping China to a 3–1 victory.

Lin won the Thailand Open, his last tournament before the 2008 Olympic Games.

In the Beijing Olympic Games, he beat Hong Kong&#x27;s Ng Wei in the first round, Park Sung-hwan in the second round, and Peter Gade in the quarter-finals. He then beat his teammate Chen Jin in straight sets to set up a &quot;dream&quot; final against Lee Chong Wei. However, the final was a one-sided match as Lin beat Lee 21–12, 21–8, and became the first men&#x27;s singles player to win the Olympic gold as a first seed.

Not back in action until the China Open in November, Lin again beat Lee in the final, before losing to Chen Jin once again in the Hong Kong Open. Lin was eligible to participate in the lucrative Masters Finals in December, but due to the withdrawal of the whole Chinese contingent (citing weariness and injuries), he didn&#x27;t take part in the tournament.

===2009: Third World and Sudirman Cup titles, Fourth All England===
In March, at his first tournament appearance of 2009, Lin won his fourth All England title without dropping a game, defeating Lee Chong Wei in the final. After this dominant performance, he lost to Lee in the final of Swiss Open a week later.

In May, Lin participated in the Sudirman Cup helping China to consecutive 5–0 victories over England, Japan, and Indonesia. In the semi-finals against Malaysia Lin defeated Lee Chong Wei in straight games as China advanced to the final against South Korea with another shutout. In the last round the same form held true as Lin beat Park Sung-hwan thus helping China to secure the Cup for the third time in a row, and each time without dropping a match in the series.

During the rest of 2009, Lin dropped only two matches; in June in the quarter-finals of the Indonesia Open, and, perhaps most surprisingly, in the finals of December&#x27;s East Asian Games in Hong Kong to South Korea&#x27;s little known Choi Ho-jin. Aside from those upsets, Lin dominated. In August in Hyderabad he became the first player to win the World Championships three times by beating compatriot Chen Jin in the final. Later Lin would go on to win his fourth China Masters title and first French Open title. He ended his tournament winning streak in November with the China Open title, before the late-year upset loss in the East Asian Games in Hong Kong.

===2010: Asiad gold, Fourth Thomas Cup and Asian champion===

After starting the season disappointingly with quarterfinal losses at both the All England and Swiss Opens, Lin won his first title of the year at the Badminton Asia Championships in New Delhi, which also marked his first victory at this annual event.

Taking part in his fifth Thomas Cup campaign for China in May, Lin won a pair of hard-fought encounters with South Korea&#x27;s Park Sung-hwan in the group ties and the quarter-finals respectively. In the semi-finals, he handily defeated Lee Chong Wei in contributing to China&#x27;s 3–0 victory over Malaysia and a berth in the final against long time rival Indonesia. Here, Lin led off with a comfortable victory over familiar opponent Taufik Hidayat, as China went on to capture its eighth Men&#x27;s World Team title; its fourth consecutively.

After the Thomas Cup triumph, Lin played in the World Championships in Paris, France. He won his opening match and then beat Henri Hurskainen and Bao Chunlai in the second and third rounds respectively before being upset by Park Sung-hwan in the quarter-finals. That day also saw his archrival Lee Chong Wei exit from the tournament which was eventually won by Lin&#x27;s compatriot Chen Jin. Lin then bounced back to win the China Masters, but 
lost the final of the Japan Open to Lee Chong Wei the following week, and conceded walkovers in the quarter-finals of both the China Open, and Hong Kong Open late in the year.

However, Lin managed to win his first ever Asian Games gold medal in November by beating Lee Chong Wei in final, thus, at 27, becoming the first player to win all of the present major titles available to Asian men in badminton, both individual and national team. Lin was voted the most valuable player (MVP) at the games&#x27; closing ceremony.

===2011: Fourth World and Sudirman Cup success, Second Asian and First Super Series Masters Finals titles===

Lin began the year with a withdrawal in the Malaysia Open&#x27;s quarter-finals, which marked his third consecutive withdrawal since late 2010. This action brought some criticism, particularly by well known fellow competitor Taufik Hidayat. The very next week Lin sprang back to win the first ever million dollar badminton tournament, Korea Open by beating Lee Chong Wei in the final. He next won the German Open, beating his compatriot and reigning world champion Chen Jin in the final.

At the prestigious All England Championships in March his hopes for a fifth title were put on hold when he was defeated by Lee Chong Wei in the final. However, in April he won his second Asian Championships on a day which saw China sweep all five titles and in May he helped China to a fourth consecutive Sudirman Cup title by defeating Denmark 3–0 in the final. In June, Lin&#x27;s withdrawal from the Singapore Open final due to gastric flu drew jeers from fans in the stadium. Just few days later, he was upset by Sho Sasaki in the second round of Indonesia Open.

Healthy again in August, Lin won his fourth World Championship title by beating familiar rivals Peter Gade in the semi-finals and Lee Chong Wei in a very tight three game final at Wembley Arena, a venue which would host the badminton competition for 2012 Summer Olympics.

The rather up and down season for Lin continued with the China Masters in September where he was ousted in the semi-finals, and at the Japan Open where he withdrew from the semifinals. This was followed up by a shock exit in the second round of the Denmark Open to Hong Kong player Wong Wing Ki, and another withdrawal during the semifinals of French Open despite leading in the match. He told officials that he was suffering from paronychia (an infection below the fingernail). This was his sixth retirement of the season and many in the media imputed that this was part of a strategy to improve the rankings of other Chinese singles players to allow the maximum number to qualify for the 2012 Olympics. Both Lin and Chinese coach Li Yongbo denied this, citing, instead, the heavy tournament schedule that BWF required of top players, and Lin&#x27;s need to be ready for the biggest events such as the Olympics. In any case, Lin&#x27;s slump did not last long. He ended the year by winning three straight events, His fifth Hong Kong Open, the China Open, and his first Super Series Masters Finals title.

===2012: Second Olympic gold, Fifth All England and Thomas Cup===

Lin started the year by losing to Lee Chong Wei in the final of the Korea Open, and then losing in the second round of the Malaysia Open to Denmark&#x27;s Jan O. Jorgensen. In early March, he took his first title of the season by winning his fifth German Open. The very next week, he won his fifth All England Open title as rival Lee Chong Wei was forced to retire in discomfort early in the second game of the final. In April, Lin was again the subject of some controversy when he withdrew from the semifinals of the Asian Championships, a move that was openly seen as a ploy to secure an Olympic berth for his compatriot Chen Jin.

In Wuhan, China in May, Lin Dan and his teammates won all of their individual matches in each tie they played to win their fifth consecutive Thomas Cup (remarkably China&#x27;s women also went entirely undefeated to regain the Uber Cup from South Korea). With only a week between Thomas Cup and the Thailand Open in early June, a fatigued Lin lost in the semi-finals to Indonesia&#x27;s highly capable Sony Dwi Kuncoro.

At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Lin routinely beat Ireland&#x27;s Scott Evans to qualify for the main draw of sixteen players where he started by trouncing fading star Taufik Hidayat. In the quarter-finals, however, Japan&#x27;s hard-fighting Sho Sasaki put Lin to the test before yielding 16–21 in the third game. Lin then handily beat South Korean veteran Lee Hyun-il in the semi-finals to set up yet another meeting with his chief rival Lee Chong Wei. Unlike the 2008 Olympic finals, this one was no cakewalk for Lin. He lost the first game to Lee but came back strongly to take the second. The rubber game was a thriller which saw Lin claw back from slight deficits most of the way to finally prevail 21–19. An ecstatic Lin thus became the first men&#x27;s singles player to retain the Olympic title, while Lee, now almost 30, was once again foiled at one of the sport&#x27;s two biggest events (aside from the Thomas and Uber Cups), the Olympics and the World Championships.

===2013: Fifth World title===
After his 2012 Olympic victory Lin did not make another tournament appearance until the Asian Championships, in April where, citing injury, he withdrew from the quarter-finals. Amid some speculation that he was planning to retire, Lin was granted a special wild card entry into the World Championships in Guangzhou, as, despite his great achievements, his recent inactivity had caused his world ranking to fall below that of other Chinese players who would then normally fill the maximum quota of three entrants that any one country was allowed. Without appearing in any tournament between the Badminton Asia Championships in April and the World Championships in August, Lin was able to convert this wildcard entry into his fifth world title. He won all of his matches in straight games until the final where, yet again, hard-luck Lee Chong Wei could not quite catch him in the third game rubber, and was forced to submit with a painful cramp down 17–20.

===2014: Second Asiad gold and Third Asian title===
After seven month tournament absence, Lin, down to 104th in the official world rankings, returned in April and took titles in the China Masters, and the Asian Championships in quick succession. Lin was part of China&#x27;s Thomas Cup team which defended its title in May, but because of his deflated ranking could only play at third singles. Consequently, when China met a talented and highly motivated Japanese team in the semi-finals at New Delhi, Lin could only watch helplessly as Japan took the first two singles and a doubles to break China&#x27;s ten year streak of men&#x27;s world team titles. Beyond this disappointment, the BWF would not grant Lin a wild card entry into the 2014 World Championships, as they did in 2013. Thus Lin could not defend his title which was won by Chinese teammate Chen Long who defeated the unlucky Lee Chong Wei in a close two game final.

In June, Lin lost in the quarter-finals of Japan Open. Shortly afterwards, he won the Australian Open, his first Superseries title since the 2012 All England Open, and then won the Grand Prix title in the Chinese Taipei Open. In September, he successfully defended his men&#x27;s singles title in the Incheon Asian Games and was also a part of the men&#x27;s team winning the silver medal. In November, Lin lost in the final of the China Open to Srikanth Kidambi from India.

===2015: Fourth Asian title and Fifth Sudirman Cup===
Lin won the men&#x27;s singles title at the Asian Championships in China, defending his title won the previous year in South Korea. He defeated compatriot Tian Houwei 21–19, 21–8 in a match that lasted 50 minutes in the central city of Wuhan. Lin Dan contributed to China winning its 10th Sudirman Cup by defeating Japan&#x27;s Takuma Ueda 21–15, 21–13 in the final for his team&#x27;s third and decisive point. His return to the World Championships in August, however, was not particularly auspicious as he was routinely eliminated by Denmark&#x27;s Jan Ø. Jørgensen in the quarter-finals, as Lin&#x27;s compatriot Chen Long again prevailed over Lee Chong Wei in the finals. Recovering from this disappointment, in September, Lin won his only Superseries title of the year at the Japan Open, making a remarkable comeback after trailing 3–11 in the deciding game of the final against Denmark&#x27;s young star Viktor Axelsen. He then participated in the Rio Olympics test tournament the Brasil Open in the end of the year, won the title after beating Pablo Abián in the final.

===2016: Sixth All England title===
In March, Lin defeated Taiwan&#x27;s Chou Tien-Chen in three hard games to clinch his seventh men&#x27;s singles title at the German Open. A week after this win, Lin regained his All England title in Birmingham, giving him his 6th victory at this prestigious event. In impressive form, he beat compatriot Tian Houwei 21–9, 21–10 in the final.

In April, Lin Dan beat world No. 1 Chen Long in straight games to lift his sixth China Masters crown in Jiangsu, China. Here Lin showed his competitive mettle by coming from 11 to 16 behind in the second game to clinch the match 23–21. In June, however, he was stunned in second round of Indonesia Open by eighteen year old Jonatan Christie.

At the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics, Lin sailed through his group round robin to qualify for the main draw. In the quarter-finals he was tested by India&#x27;s Srikanth Kidambi, but pulled through 21–18 in the third game. This set up a sem-ifinals confrontation with long-time rival Lee Chong Wei which drew great fan interest as the players, both in their thirties, were assumed to be near retirement. In another epic match Lee was finally able to reverse past Olympic and World Championship losses to Lin and prevailed, 15–21, 21–11, 22–20. But Lee&#x27;s quest for Olympic gold after two silver medals ended with a disappointing finale, as he was beaten in two close games by Lin&#x27;s compatriot Chen Long. In the bronze medal match, Lin played Denmark&#x27;s Viktor Axelsen. After taking the first set 21–15, the two-time Olympic champion lost the next two and the match with a scoreline of 21–15, 10–21, 17–21. After the Rio Olympics, he skipped all international tournaments for the remainder of the year.

===2017: First Malaysia Open title===
In March, at the prestigious All England Championships Lin defeated Viktor Axelson in the quarter-finals but was eliminated in the semi-finals by his countryman Shi Yuqi, more than twelve years Lin&#x27;s Junior. However, he bounced back to win the Swiss Open by beating Shi Yuqi in the finals. In April, he won the Malaysia Open for the first time by defeating Lee Chong Wei, who had virtually owned this title for more than a decade. In the China Masters, he lost in the semi-finals to Qiao Bin, and in the Asian Championships, where he recorded a sem-ifinals win over Lee Chong Wei, he took a silver medal after losing to Chen Long in the final. Lin was beaten in the German and Indonesian Opens respectively in round of 16. He lost to Chen Long in the Australian Open quarter-finals.

At the World Championships in Glasgow, Scotland, at age 33, Lin managed to reach a record seventh men&#x27;s singles final by beating Hong Kong&#x27;s Wong Wing Ki, 21–17, 21–18 in the quarter-finals and beating Korea&#x27;s Son Wan-ho, 21–17, 21–14 in the semi-finals. But in the finals, he was beaten in straight sets by his ten years younger opponent, Viktor Axelsen of Denmark, 22–20, 21–16.

===2018: Sixth Thomas Cup===
In March, the 34-year-old Lin tied Rudy Hartono&#x27;s record of reaching ten All England men&#x27;s singles finals, but was foiled in his try for a seventh title by his much younger compatriot, Shi Yuqi in three exhausting games, 19–21, 21–16, 9–21. In May, he won the New Zealand Open by beating talented Indonesian youngster Jonatan Christie in two close games, 21–14, 21–19. Later that month, Lin was a member of the Chinese team which regained the Thomas Cup after four years of absence, though his team was never extended to a deciding 5th match which would have required his services in the third singles position.

===2019: Second Malaysia Open title===
In his first tournament of 2019, Lin reached the final of the Thailand Masters, where he lost to the up-and-coming Loh Kean Yew in two tightly contested games, 19–21, 18–21. In April, at the age of 35, he won his second Malaysia Open title, beating higher ranked compatriot Shi Yuqi, and Chen Long, in the semi-finals and finals respectively. However, he withdrew from the Singapore Open during the first round against Viktor Axelsen, citing a &quot;thigh injury&quot;, but only after being visibly upset by early line calls. In May, he lost in the semi-finals of the New Zealand Open to Ng Ka Long in two straight games. In November, he lost in the final of the Korea Masters to Kanta Tsuneyama in another straight games defeat.

===2020: Pandemic shorten season===
Lin begins the 2020 season poorly. In January, he was eliminated in the first round of the Malaysia Masters by Jan Ø. Jørgensen in two games, 19–21, 18–21. The following week, he participated in the Indonesia Masters and was defeated in the first round again, this time by Viktor Axelsen, who beat him in two relatively easy games, 12–21, 14–21. Lin then followed up with yet another first round exit at the Thailand Masters where he lost to Ng Ka Long. At the All England Open held in March, he reached the second round but was defeated by compatriot Chen Long. This turned out to be his last tournament as the rest of the world tour were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak.

== Retirement ==
On 4 July 2020, Lin announced his retirement, saying &quot;at 37, pain and injuries no longer allow me to fight with my teammates. I have gratitude, a heavy heart and unwillingness.&quot; After his retirement, he joined Instagram to stay connected with his fans all over the world.

==Rivalry with Lee Chong Wei==

The Lee–Lin rivalry was a rivalry between two professional badminton players, Lee Chong Wei and Lin Dan whose careers were almost exactly contemporaneous. The rivalry is often considered the greatest in the history of badminton even though Lin had the decided edge. Of their 40 meetings, Lin won the head-to-head by 28–12 but Lee Chong Wei was ranked World number one throughout both their careers consecutively for almost 10 years.

== Personal life ==
Lin has been in a relationship with Xie Xingfang, herself a former world champion, since 2003. They were quietly engaged on 13 December 2010 in Haizhu, Guangzhou. Xie initially denied but later acknowledged romantic involvement with Lin, who reacted angrily at the public exposure of their relationship, citing reasons of personal privacy. The two were married on 23 September 2012 and the wedding ceremony was held at the Beijing University of Technology.

Lin had five tattoos visible during the 2012 Summer Olympics. His upper left arm has a Christian cross, his lower left arm has five stars, his right upper arm reads &quot;until the end of world&quot;, a double &quot;F&quot; lettering on his lower right arm, and his initials &quot;LD&quot; are tattooed on the back of his neck. These tattoos have been the subject of controversy due to his military and religious status.

On 17 October 2012, he became the first active Chinese badminton player to accept a master&#x27;s degree, which was presented at Huaqiao University. His autobiography, &quot;Until the End of the World&quot;, was published after he successfully defended his Olympic title at the London 2012 Olympics.

He and his wife Xie Xingfang had their first child &quot;Xiao Yu&quot; (Little feather) on 5 November 2016. On 17 November 2016, he admitted to an affair and apologised on Weibo. Social media users had purportedly identified the woman as actress and model Zhao Yaqi.

== Honours and awards ==
Lin won the Eddie Choong Player of the Year award for two consecutive years in 2006 and 2007. He also secured the BWF Best Male Player of the Year in 2008. Lin was voted Most Valuable Player (MVP) during the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou, China.

On 16 January 2011, he was named China&#x27;s best male athlete for 2010 in China Central Television&#x27;s Sports Personality of the Year poll for his clean sweep in major badminton titles.

On 26 May 2023, Lin was inducted into the BWF&#x27;s Hall of Fame along with long-time rival, Lee Chong Wei of Malaysia.

== Social media ==

<doc id="905049" wikidata="Q4542508" url="?curid=905049" title="Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock or Alternative Album">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock or Alternative Album (until 2020: &quot;Best Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album&quot;) is an award presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to recording artists for releasing albums in the Latin rock and/or alternative genres. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

The category was introduced in 1998 and has gone through a number of name changes:
* 1998-2008: Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Performance
* 2009-2011: Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock, Alternative or Urban Album (for which this category merged with the Latin Urban Album category)
* 2012: No Grammy was awarded (Grammy category was discontinued in a major overhaul of Grammy categories. That year, recordings in this category were shifted to the newly formed Best Latin Pop, Rock or Urban Album category. )
* 2013-2020: Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album
* 2021 onwards: Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock or Alternative Album

In June 2020, the Recording Academy announced a renaming and redefining of this category. Latin urban albums were moved to the newly named Best Latin Pop or Urban Album category, as the Academy stated that &quot;the Latin urban genre, both aesthetically and musically, is much more closely related to the current state of Latin pop.&quot;

* In 2016 and 2024, there were ties for the award. Both artists were deemed winners individually in those years.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best [[Tejano music|Tejano]] Album was awarded from 1999 to 2011. In its first year the award was titled Best Tejano Music Performance and in 2000 it was awarded as Best Tejano Performance. The current title has been used since 2001. From 1993 to 1998 Tejano was included in the award for Best Mexican-American/Tejano Music Performance.

The award was discontinued from 2012 in a major overhaul of Grammy categories. From 2012, this category and [[Grammy Award for Best Regional Mexican Album | Best Regional Mexican Album]] merged to form the [[Best Regional Mexican or Tejano Album ]] category.

<doc id="905059" wikidata="Q14900310" url="?curid=905059" title="Treasure Act 1996">
<text>The Treasure Act 1996 is a UK Act of Parliament, defining which objects are classified as treasure, legally obliging the finder to report their find. It applies in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

==Provisions==
The Act is designed to deal with finds of treasure in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It legally obliges finders of objects which constitute treasure (as defined in the Act) to report their find to their local coroner within 14 days. An inquest led by the coroner then determines whether the find constitutes treasure or not. If it is declared to be treasure then the finder must offer the item for sale to a museum at a price set by an independent board of antiquities experts known as the Treasure Valuation Committee. Only if a museum expresses no interest in the item, or is unable to purchase it, can the finder retain it.

===&quot;Treasure&quot; definition===
For the purposes of the Act, &quot;treasure&quot; is defined as being:

*All coins from the same find, if it consists of two or more coins, and as long as they are at least 300 years old when found. If they contain less than 10% gold or silver there must be at least 10 in the find for it to qualify.
*Two or more prehistoric base metal objects in association with one another.
*Any individual (non-coin) find that is at least 300 years old and contains at least 10% gold or silver.
*Associated finds: any object of any material found in the same place as (or which had previously been together with) another object which is deemed treasure.
*An object that would have been classed as treasure trove if found before section 4 came into force, that is: one substantially made from gold or silver but less than 300 years old, that has been deliberately hidden with the intention of recovery and whose owners or heirs are unknown.

Additionally, the Act empowers the Secretary of State, by statutory instrument, to designate certain descriptions of items as treasure provided they are at least 200 years old, and also to designate certain descriptions of items to be excluded from the definition of treasure. As of 2023, as a result of such designations, &#x27;treasure&#x27; includes:

*Any prehistoric object containing metal, other than a coin, any part of which is precious metal or which is part of a collection of at least two such objects.
*Any object that &quot;provides an exceptional insight into an aspect of national or regional history, archaeology or culture&quot; due to its rarity in the UK, the part of the UK where it was found, or its connection with a person or event.

It excludes, unless they are treasure by virtue of the other designations by order:
*broadly, any object that can be assumed to be under the faculty jurisdiction of the Church of England due to being found on land it owns and controls;
*any object found within the precinct of a cathedral.

The Act allows for a reward up to the market value of the treasure to be shared among the finder and the tenants and/or owner of the land on which the treasure was found. The amount of the reward and how it is divided among the claimants is determined by the Treasure Valuation Committee.

Successful cases involving the Treasure Act include that of the Ringlemere gold cup. Non-treasure finds are the remit of the Portable Antiquities Scheme.

==UK legislation==
*Code of Practice (DCMS)

==Scotland==

The act does not apply in Scotland, where treasure finds are a matter of Scots Common Law.

<doc id="905068" wikidata="Q686084" url="?curid=905068" title="Marcel Déat">
<text>Marcel Déat (; 7 March 1894 – 5 January 1955) was a French politician. Initially a socialist and a member of the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO), he led a breakaway group of right-wing Neosocialists out of the SFIO in 1933. During the occupation of France by Nazi Germany, he founded the collaborationist National Popular Rally (RNP). In 1944, he became Minister of Labour and National Solidarity in Pierre Laval&#x27;s government in Vichy, before escaping to the Sigmaringen enclave along with Vichy officials after the Allied landings in Normandy. Condemned &quot;in absentia&quot; for collaborationism, he died while still in hiding in Italy.

==Early life and politics==

Marcel Déat was raised in a modest environment, which shared republican and patriotic values. After brilliant studies, he entered in 1914 the &quot;École Normale Supérieure&quot; (ENS) after having been the student of Alain, a philosopher who was active in the Radical Party and who would write a deeply anti-militarist book after World War I. The same year, Déat joined the SFIO.

While he attended the ENS and worked to get a philosophy degree, World War I broke out. He joined the French Army and saw active duty, winning the Légion d&#x27;honneur and five bravery citations. By the war&#x27;s end, Déat had achieved the rank of captain. Under the pseudonym of Taëd, he then published &quot;Cadavres et maximes, philosophie d&#x27;un revenant&quot; (approximately translated by &quot;Corpses and Maxims, Philosophy of a Ghost&quot;), in which he expressed his horror of trenches, strong pacifist views, as well as his fascination for collective discipline and war camaraderie. When the war ended in 1918, he finished his studies at the École Normale and passed his &quot;agrégation&quot; of philosophy, and oriented himself towards sociology under the direction of Célestin Bouglé, a friend of Alain and also member of the Radical Party. In the meanwhile, Déat taught philosophy in Reims.

During the 1920 Tours Congress in which a majority of the SFIO decided to spin off to found the French Communist Party, Marcel Déat positioned himself at the right wing of the SFIO, taking part in the &quot;groupe de la Vie socialiste&quot; current, alongside Pierre Renaudel.

Déat was elected municipal counsellor of Reims in 1925, and then deputy for the Marne during a partial election in 1926. However, he lost his seat after the 1928 elections. In these times, Léon Blum, the leader of the SFIO, tried to favor youths in the party, and decided to name Déat secretary of the SFIO parliamentary group. After having been put in charge of the documentary center of the ENS by Célestin Bouglié, Déat now founded a documentary center for the SFIO deputies.

== Neo-socialist period ==

Marcel Déat published in 1930 &quot;Perspectives socialistes&quot; (Socialist Perspectives), a revisionist work closely influenced by Henri de Man&#x27;s &quot;planisme&quot;. Along with over a hundred articles written in &quot;La Vie Socialiste&quot;, the review of the SFIO&#x27;s right-wing, &quot;Perspective socialistes&quot; marked the shift of Déat from classical socialism to neosocialism. Déat replaced class struggle by collaboration of classes and national solidarity, advocated corporatism as a social organization model, replaced the notion of &quot;socialism&quot; by &quot;anti-capitalism&quot; and supported an authoritarian state which would plan the economy and from which parliamentarism would be repealed.

During the 1932 elections, he was elected deputy of the 20th arrondissement of Paris, beating the Communist Jacques Duclos — who himself had gained the upper hand against Léon Blum in 1928 in the same electoral district. Déat and other Neosocialists were expelled from the SFIO at the 5 November 1933 Congress, for their revisionist views and disagreements with Léon Blum&#x27;s policies toward Prime Minister Édouard Herriot, leader of the second &quot;Cartel des Gauches&quot; (Left-Wing Coalition). The official position of the SFIO was then to support the Cartel without participating in the government, which it considered &quot;bourgeois.&quot; The same year, Déat joined the Socialist Party of France – Jean Jaurès Union (PSdF) created the same year by Planist and Neosocialist elements expelled by the SFIO during the 1933 Congress. The new party&#x27;s slogan was &quot;Order, Authority and Nation&quot;.

The expelled faction was a minority in the SFIO, but represented the majority of the SFIO parliamentary group. They were opposed both by the left wing of the SFIO, represented by Marceau Pivert, and by the SFIO&#x27;s center, headed by Blum. The Neosocialists wanted to &quot;reinforce the state against the economic crisis&quot;, open themselves to the middle classes and participate in non-Socialist governments.

Without the support of the Socialists, Déat lost his seat in the Chamber. Two years later, he joined the Socialist Republican Union (USR). He became Minister of Air in the &quot;bourgeois&quot; government of Albert Sarraut (Radical) but he quickly resigned his post over disputes with the Prime Minister. With the increasing threats represented by Nazi Germany, Déat wanted to maintain peace at any cost.

He returned to the Chamber of Deputies in 1936 as a delegate from Angoulême, and at first supported the Popular Front led by Blum before denouncing &quot;Communist infiltration&quot; of it. After Blum&#x27;s replacement by Édouard Daladier in 1938, which marked the end of the Popular Front, Déat participated in the &quot;Anti-Communist Rally.&quot; In an article published on 4 May 1939 entitled &quot;Why Die for Danzig?&quot;, published in the newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Œuvre&quot;, Déat argued that France should not go to war for Poland if the Danzig crisis resulted in war. There, he argued that France should avoid war with Germany if the latter seized Poland – the publication caused a widespread controversy, and propelled Déat to national fame. Déat would collaborate with &quot;L&#x27;Œuvre&quot; during the entire period of Vichy France.

==Roots of extremism == 

A strong supporter of Germany&#x27;s occupation of northern France in 1940, Déat took up residence in unoccupied France, and was initially a supporter of Philippe Pétain. He attempted to create a single party to fully realize the aims of the &quot;Révolution nationale&quot;, the official, reactionary ideology of Vichy. Thereafter, he founded in February 1941 the National Popular Rally (RNP) which advocated Collaboration with Nazi Germany and antisemitism. When the French State, then headed by Pétain, did not become the Fascist state Déat had in mind, he moved to occupied  Paris and was funded by the Germans. The Germans forced Déat at first to merge his new party (RNP) with Eugène Deloncle&#x27;s MSR (Social Revolutionary Movement), a far-right party, the successor of the &quot;Cagoule&quot; terrorist group. The merger was a failure and Déat later expelled MSR elements from his party, before trying to form a unified front of Collaborationist parties.

Déat also founded, along with fellow Collaborationists Jacques Doriot and Marcel Bucard, the Légion des Volontaires Français (LVF), a French unit of the Wehrmacht (later affiliated with the Waffen-SS).

While reviewing troops from the LVF with former Prime Minister Pierre Laval in Versailles on 27 August 1941, Déat was wounded in an assassination attempt—carried out by Paul Collette. After recovering, he became a supporter of Laval, who supported more reactionary policies than Pétain, and again became Prime Minister of France in 1942. Under the suggestion of the Germans, Marcel Déat became on 16 March 1944, Minister of Labour and National Solidarity in Laval&#x27;s cabinet.

==Exile and death==

After the Allied landings at Normandy the French Government, with Déat, was escorted to Germany and he became an official of the government-in-exile at Sigmaringen. With the defeat of Nazi Germany in May 1945, Déat fled to Italy in April and took his wife&#x27;s name, temporarily teaching in Milan and Turin. He was later taken in and hidden by a Roman Catholic religious order in the convent of San Vito, near Turin, where he wrote his memoirs and lived undiscovered until his death in 1955. After the war, he was convicted of treason in France and sentenced to death &quot;in absentia&quot;.

<doc id="905072" wikidata="Q6735709" url="?curid=905072" title="Mail and wire fraud">
<text>Mail fraud and wire fraud are terms used in the United States to describe the use of a physical (e.g., the U.S. Postal Service) or electronic (e.g., a phone, a telegram, a fax, or the Internet) mail system to defraud another, and are U.S. federal crimes. Jurisdiction is claimed by the federal government if the illegal activity crosses interstate or international borders.

==Mail fraud==
Mail fraud was first defined in the United States in 1872.

 provides:

Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, or to sell, dispose of, loan, exchange, alter, give away, distribute, supply, or furnish or procure for unlawful use any counterfeit or spurious coin, obligation, security, or other article, or anything represented to be or intimated or held out to be such counterfeit or spurious article, for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do, places in any post office or authorized depository for mail matter, any matter or thing to be sent or delivered by the Postal Service, or deposits or causes to be deposited any matter or thing to be sent or delivered by any private or commercial interstate carrier, or takes or receives therefrom, any such matter or thing, or knowingly causes to be delivered by mail or such carrier according to the direction thereon, or at the place at which it is directed to be delivered by the person to whom it is addressed, any such matter or thing, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. If the violation occurs in relation to, or involving any benefit authorized, transported, transmitted, transferred, disbursed, or paid in connection with, a Presidential declared major disaster or emergency (as those terms are defined in section 102 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5122)), or affects a financial institution, such person shall be fined not more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both.

Thus, anyone trying to defraud another individual or group through items of value, e.g., money, through the US mail system or a private mail delivery service and those knowingly participating in that fraud will be punished with a fine and/or prison sentence that cannot be longer than 20 years. 
However, for such acts during a Presidential declared major disaster or emergency, the prison sentence can be as long as 30 years and the fine as great as $1,000,000.

In mail fraud, US federal jurisdiction is based on the enumerated power to create a post office under Article I, Section 8 of the US Constitution.

International reply coupons mailed by participants of Charles Ponzi&#x27;s scheme are a 20th-century example of mail fraud. Ponzi was charged with the U.S. federal crime of mail fraud.

==Wire fraud==

Wire fraud was first defined in the United States in 1952.

 provides:

Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. If the violation occurs in relation to, or involving any benefit authorized, transported, transmitted, transferred, disbursed, or paid in connection with, a presidentially declared major disaster or emergency (as those terms are defined in section 102 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act ( 42 U.S.C. 5122 )), or affects a financial institution, such person shall be fined not more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both.

Briefly, anyone trying to defraud other people or groups through any form of telecommunication, or through writing, signs, pictures or sounds can be punished with a maximum prison sentence of 20 years. If the fraud involves a financial institution, the maximum fine is raised to 1 million US dollars and prison sentence not more than 30 years, or both.

==Honest services==
 provides:

For the purposes of this chapter, the term &quot;scheme or artifice to defraud&quot; includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.

==Elements==
There are three elements to mail and wire fraud:
# A mail or wire communication
# a scheme and intent to defraud someone
# a material deception

Mail fraud applies only to United States domestic mailings and use of interstate carriers (UPS, FedEx) which must originate in one state, and successfully terminate pursuant to the address label inside another state, a transportation that is termed &quot;interstate&quot; (over which Congress has power to regulate) and does require that the mailing cross at least one state line into another state; wire fraud has been expanded by Congress to include foreign wire communication or interstate connections via (e.g.) an e-mail server or telephone switch or radio communication.

==Case law==
In &quot;McNally v. United States&quot; (1987), the Supreme Court held that 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1343 did not reach honest services fraud. Congress responded by passing 18 U.S.C. § 1346. In &quot;Skilling v. United States&quot; (2010), the Court construed § 1346 to apply only to bribes and kickbacks.

&quot;United States v. Regent Office Supply Co.&quot; (1970) involves Regent which was a company that sold orders over a telephone. Regent representatives would exaggerate their office products over the phone. The United States government charged the company with wire fraud. The company&#x27;s salesmen were accused of making &quot;false pretenses&quot; over the phone. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that the &quot;repugnant&quot; conduct of the company did not amount to criminality.

&quot;Lustiger v. United States&quot;, 386 F.2d 132 (9th Cir., 1967), involved a real estate advertisement mail fraud. The defendant stated that as a salesman he had engaged in puffery.

In &quot;United States v. Takhalov&quot; (2016), female nightclub employees would pose as tourists, engage with potential customers, and lure them into nightclubs owned by Takhalov. The employees would express romantic interest in the customers and not reveal that they were club employees. The 11th Circuit ruled that Takhalov deceived their customers, but this deception didn&#x27;t amount to defrauding the customers under the Wire Fraud statute.

==Mail fraud schemes==
There are many types of mail fraud schemes, including employment fraud, financial fraud, fraud against older Americans, sweepstakes and lottery fraud, and telemarketing fraud. Additional information about these various types of mail fraud schemes can be found on the United States Postal Inspection Service website.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Chief Postal Inspector Martin McGee, also known as &quot;The Top Sleuth&quot; or &quot;Mr. Mail Fraud&quot;, led his department in exposing and prosecuting numerous mail fraud swindles such as land sales, phony advertising practices, insurance rip-offs, and fraudulent charitable organizations that used the mail to facilitate their illegal activities.

==Scope==
The scope of 18 U.S.C. §1341 and 18 U.S.C. §1343 is broad. These statutes have been held by the Supreme Court to encompass &quot;everything designed to defraud by representations as to the past or present, or suggestions and promises as to the future.&quot; Lower courts have progressively expanded this ruling, finding that the law &quot;puts its imprimatur on the accepted moral standards and condemns conduct which fails to match the &#x27;reflection of moral uprightness, of fundamental honesty, fair play and right dealing in the general and business life of members of society. As interpreted, these requirements are not difficult to meet; the Justice Department claims to defer federal prosecution for petty local fraud.

In 1987, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in &quot;McNally v. United States&quot; to narrow the scope of the mail and wire fraud statutes, ruling that the statute pertained only to schemes to defraud victims of tangible property, including money. In 1988, Congress enacted a new law that specifically criminalized schemes to defraud victims of &quot;the intangible right of honest services&quot; (honest services fraud).

<doc id="905074" wikidata="Q1606854" url="?curid=905074" title="The Code Book">
<text>The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography is a book by Simon Singh, published in 1999 by Fourth Estate and Doubleday.

&quot;The Code Book&quot; describes some illustrative highlights in the history of cryptography, drawn from both of its principal branches, codes and ciphers. Thus the book&#x27;s title should not be misconstrued as suggesting that the book deals only with codes, and not with ciphers; or that the book is in fact a codebook.

==Contents==
&quot;The Code Book&quot; covers diverse historical topics including the Man in the Iron Mask, Arabic cryptography, Charles Babbage, the mechanisation of cryptography, the Enigma machine, and the decryption of Linear B and other ancient writing systems.

Later sections cover the development of public-key cryptography. Some of this material is based on interviews with participants, including persons who worked in secret at GCHQ.

The book concludes with a discussion of &quot;Pretty Good Privacy&quot; (PGP), quantum computing, and quantum cryptography.

The book announced a &quot;cipher challenge&quot; of a series of ten progressively harder ciphers, with a cash prize of £10,000, which has since been won.

The book is not footnoted but has a &quot;Further Reading&quot; section at the end, organized by chapter.

<text>Port Moody is a city in British Columbia, Canada, and a member municipality of the Metro Vancouver Regional District. It envelops the east end of Burrard Inlet and is the smallest of the Tri-Cities, bordered by Coquitlam on the east and south and by Burnaby on the west. The villages of Belcarra and Anmore, along with the rugged Coast Mountains, lie to the northwest and north, respectively. It is named for Richard Clement Moody, who was the founder and the first Lieutenant-Governor of the Colony of British Columbia.

==History==
Port Moody is named for Colonel Richard Clement Moody, of the Royal Engineers. It was created at the end of a trail that connected New Westminster to Burrard Inlet, to defend New Westminster against potential attack by the USA. It grew rapidly after 1859 by land grants to Moody&#x27;s Royal Engineers.

The construction of a transcontinental railroad was the condition that prompted British Columbia to enter into confederation in 1871. The small town received little attention until it was declared the terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1879.

By 1881, the survey of Port Moody had begun. Both John Murray Sr. and Jr. assisted, and, in fact, it was John Murray Jr. who named many of the streets after members of his family. The population grew rapidly through the early 1880s. Andrew Onderdonk was the contractor who, under government contract, built of line from Port Moody, via Hope, Yale and Savona. Onderdonk built a large wharf and receiving area and started rail construction from Port Moody in 1883. The line was finished in 1885. As the Western Terminus of the CPR, almost everyone had high hopes that Port Moody would become a major West Coast metropolis.

The railway was completed with the last spike driven at Craigellachie on 7 November 1885, and a train arriving at Port Moody the next day. The first scheduled passenger transcontinental train arrived on 4 July 1886, a date that is still celebrated during Golden Spike Days. Real estate prices soared but soon fell flat when a branch line was built westward along the inlet to Vancouver in 1887.

While many people lost a great deal of money and moved on, others, including real estate tycoon and ship captain James A. Clarke, and several lumber mills, decided to remain. On 7 April 1913, Port Moody&#x27;s Council met for the first time as a city.

<text>Slovenske Konjice ( ; , in older sources also &quot;Gannobitz&quot;) is a town in northeastern Slovenia. It is the seat of the Municipality of Slovenske Konjice. The area is part of the traditional region of Styria.

==History and town sights==
The town of Slovenske Konjice lies below the northern slopes of Mount Konjice () and the winegrowing Škalce Hills. On a hill above the town to the southwest are the ruins of 12th-century Gonobitz Castle (, ), which has later additions and was abandoned in the 18th century. Its ruins have been partially restored.
Above Old Square () stands the medieval Trebnik Mansion. The more than 860-year-old dense town line is a sloping square, from Trebnik Mansion past St. George&#x27;s parish church, along a small stream in an open channel, down to the Dravinja River. The new Town Square (&quot;Mestni trg&quot;) is on the other bank of the river, connected with Old Square by a bridge with four horse heads on the corners.

The dominant structure in the upper part of the town&#x27;s medieval core is the parish church dedicated to Saint George and belonging to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Maribor, dating back to the late 13th century with 18th-century additions (a Baroque side chapel). The veneration of the saint at this place goes even further back in history. The town was mentioned in written sources dating to 1165 as a seminal parish. The castle was first mentioned in 1148 and the market town in 1236. The town itself was not surrounded by walls. At the time of the Ottoman raids, the church with its vicarage served as a fortified refuge. A second church in the settlement is dedicated to Saint Anne. It dates to the mid-16th century with a 17th-century belfry and Baroque additions.

The main street and the transversal connections above the Dravinja are lined with longitudinal or transversally positioned one-storey houses with well-preserved Gothic cores and Renaissance additions. The façades were restyled in the 19th century (Biedermeier, Historicism). A rarity is the Art Nouveau building of the former savings bank. A Marian column dating to the mid-18th century and a column shrine dedicated to Saint Florian above the stream (both designed by the local artist Franc Zamlik in 1750) dominate the open square. The town core is well preserved.Slovenske Konjice played a role during the Slovenian peasant revolt of 1515, with rebels here composing a letter with their demands to send to the emperor in Vienna. Economic development was boosted after construction of main Vienna to Trieste road in the 18th century. During the 19th century the town got a local court. The Austrian Southern Railway was built in 1846, but it ran east of Konjice. On 20 June 1892, work started on a narrow gauge (760 mm) steam railroad line called &quot;Konjičanka&quot; from Poljčane to Slovenske Konjice, which was opened on 20 December 1892. On 29 June 1921 it was extended to Zreče. It was closed in 1963, and the tracks were removed in 1970. A museum locomotive K.3 (Gonobitz), built by the Krauss factory at Linz and used on this line, is on display at the Slovenian Railway Museum in Ljubljana.

===Name===
Over the centuries, the name &quot;Konjice&quot; appears in written documents in various forms: &quot;Gonviz&quot; (1251), &quot;Gombicz&quot; (1370), &quot;Gannabitz&quot; (1570), &quot;Gonaviz&quot; (1594), &quot;Gonavitz&quot; (1630), &quot;Gonwitz&quot; (1636), &quot;Gonowitz&quot; (1662), &quot;Ganowiz&quot; (1680), &quot;Gonnawitz&quot; (1680), and modern German &quot;Gonobitz&quot;. The adjective &quot;Slovenske&quot; was added to the Slovene name &quot;Konjice&quot; in 1934, under the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, in order to distinguish it from the town of Konjic in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

<doc id="905107" wikidata="Q421186" url="?curid=905107" title="Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase">
<text>Aromatic -amino acid decarboxylase (AADC or AAAD), also known as DOPA decarboxylase (DDC), tryptophan decarboxylase, and 5-hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase, is a lyase enzyme (), located in region 7p12.2-p12.1.

== Mechanism ==
The enzyme uses pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), the active form of vitamin B6, as a cofactor. PLP is essential to the mechanism of decarboxylation in AADC. In the active enzyme, PLP is bound to lysine-303 of AADC as a Schiff base. Upon substrate binding, Lys-303 is displaced by the substrate&#x27;s amine. This positions the carboxylate of the substrate within the active site such that decarboxylation is favored. Decarboxylation of the substrate produces a quinonoid intermediate, which is subsequently protonated to produce a Schiff base adduct of PLP and the decarboxylated product. Lys-303 can then regenerate the original Schiff base, releasing the product while retaining PLP.

Probing this PLP-catalyzed decarboxylation, it has been discovered that there is a difference in concentration and pH dependence between substrates. DOPA is optimally decarboxylated at pH 6.7 and a PLP concentration of 0.125 mM, while the conditions for optimal 5-HTP decarboxylation were found to be pH 8.3 and 0.3 mM PLP.
== Structure ==
Aromatic decarboxylase is active as a homodimer. Before addition of the pyridoxal phosphate cofactor, the apoenzyme exists in an open conformation. Upon cofactor binding, a large structural transformation occurs as the subunits pull closer and close the active site. This conformational change results in the active, closed holoenzyeme.

In PLP-deficient murine models, it has been observed that dopamine levels do not significantly deviate from PLP-supplemented specimens; however, the concentration of serotonin in the deficient brain model was significant. This variable effect of PLP-deficiency indicates possible isoforms of AADC with differential substrate specificity for DOPA and 5-HTP. Dialysis studies also suggest that the potential isoform responsible for DOPA decarboxylation has a greater binding affinity for PLP than that of 5-HTP decarboxylase.

== Regulation ==
AADC regulation, especially as it relates to decarboxylation, has been studied extensively. AADC has several conserved protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase G recognition sites, with residues S220, S336, S359, T320, and S429 all as potential phosphate acceptors. &quot;In vitro&quot; studies have confirmed PKA and PKG can both phosphorylate AADC, causing a significant increase in activity. In addition, dopamine receptor antagonists have been shown to increase AADC activity in rodent models, while activation of some dopamine receptors suppresses AADC activity. Such receptor-mediated regulation is biphasic, with an initial short term activation followed by long term activation. The short term activation is thought to proceed through kinase activation and subsequent phosphorylation of AADC, while the sensitivity of long term activation to protein translation inhibitors suggests regulation of mRNA transcription.

==Reactions==
AADC catalyzes several different decarboxylation reactions:
* -DOPA to dopamine – a neurotransmitter
* -Phenylalanine to phenethylamine – a trace amine which functions as a neuromodulator
* -Tyrosine to tyramine – a trace amine neuromodulator
* -Histidine to histamine – a neurotransmitter
* -Tryptophan to tryptamine – a trace amine neuromodulator
* 5-HTP to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) – a neurotransmitter

However, some of these reactions do not seem to bear much or any biological significance. For example, histamine is biosynthesised strictly via the enzyme histidine decarboxylase in humans and other organisms.


==Clinical relevance==
In normal dopamine and serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmitter synthesis, AADC is not the rate-limiting step in either reaction. However, AADC becomes the rate-limiting step of dopamine synthesis in patients treated with (such as in Parkinson&#x27;s disease), and the rate-limiting step of serotonin synthesis in people treated with 5-HTP (such as in mild depression or dysthymia). AADC is inhibited by carbidopa outside of the blood brain barrier to inhibit the premature conversion of -DOPA to dopamine in the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s.

In humans, AADC is also the rate-limiting enzyme in the formation of trace amines. Aromatic -amino acid decarboxylase deficiency is associated with various symptoms as severe developmental delay, oculogyric crises and autonomic dysfunction. The molecular and clinical spectrum of AAAC deficiency is heterogeneous. The first case of AADC deficiency was described in twin brothers 1990. Patients can be treated with dopamine agonists, MAO inhibitors, and pyridoxine (vitamin B6). Clinical phenotype and response to treatment is variable and the long-term and functional outcome is unknown. To provide a basis for improving the understanding of the epidemiology, genotype–phenotype correlation and outcome of these diseases their impact on the quality of life of patients, and for evaluating diagnostic and therapeutic strategies a patient registry was established by the noncommercial International Working Group on Neurotransmitter Related Disorders (iNTD).

Immunohistochemical studies have revealed that AADC is expressed in various neuronal cell types such as serotonergic and catecholaminergic neurons. Neurons that express AADC but are not considered classical monoaminergic cell neurons are termed D cells. Cells that are immunoreactive for AADC have also been found in the human brainstem. These cells include melanin-pigmented cells that are typically designated as catecholaminergic and may also be serotonergic. Significant localization of dopaminergic cells that are also immunoreactive for AADC is reported in the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, and the mesencephalic reticular formation. Unlike previous reports on animal models, nonaminergic (D cells) are unlikely to be observed in the human brain.

== Genetics ==
The gene encoding the enzyme is referred to as &quot;DDC&quot; is located on chromosome 7 in humans. It consists of 15 exons encoding a protein of 480 amino acids. Single nucleotide polymorphisms and other gene variations have been investigated in relation to neuropsychiatric disorders, for example, a one-base pair deletion at 601 and a four-base pair deletion at 722–725 in exon 1 in relation to bipolar disorder and autism. No direct correlation between gene variation and autism was found.

More than 50 mutations of &quot;DDC&quot; have been correlated with AADC deficiency. This condition is most prevalent in Asia, presumably due to the founder effect.

Alternative splicing events and promoters have been observed that lead to various forms of the AADC enzyme. Unique usage of certain promoters leads to transcription of only the first exon to produce an extra-neuronal isoform, and splicing of exon 3 leads to a product devoid of enzymatic activity. Analyses via porcine specimens have elucidated two AADC isoforms – resulting from exclusion of exon 5 and exons 5 and 6 – that lack a portion of the decarboxylating domain.

<doc id="905119" wikidata="Q1928290" url="?curid=905119" title="Overlock">
<text>An overlock is a kind of stitch that sews over the edge of one or two pieces of cloth for edging, hemming, or seaming. Usually an overlock sewing machine will cut the edges of the cloth as they are fed through (such machines being called sergers in North America), though some are made without cutters. The inclusion of automated cutters allows overlock machines to create finished seams easily and quickly. An overlock sewing machine differs from a lockstitch sewing machine in that it uses loopers fed by multiple thread cones rather than a bobbin. Loopers serve to create thread loops that pass from the needle thread to the edges of the fabric so that the edges of the fabric are contained within the seam.

Overlock sewing machines usually run at high speeds, from 1000 to 9000 rpm, and most are used in industry for edging, hemming and seaming a variety of fabrics and products. Overlock stitches are extremely versatile, as they can be used for decoration, reinforcement, or construction.

Overlocking is also referred to as &quot;overedging&quot;, &quot;merrowing&quot;, or &quot;serging&quot;. Though &quot;serging&quot; technically refers to overlocking with cutters, in practice the four terms are used interchangeably.

==History==
Overlock stitching was invented by the Merrow Machine Company in 1881.

J. Makens Merrow and his son Joseph Merrow, who owned a knitting mill established in Connecticut in 1838, developed a number of technological advancements to be used in the mill&#x27;s operations. Merrow&#x27;s first patent was a machine for crochet stitching, and the Merrow Machine Company still produces crochet machines based on this original model. This technology was a starting point for the development of the overlock machine, patented by Joseph Merrow in 1889. Unlike standard lockstitching, which uses a bobbin, overlock sewing machines utilize loopers to create thread loops for the needle to pass through, in a manner similar to crocheting. Merrow&#x27;s original three-thread overedge sewing machine is the forerunner of contemporary overlocking machines. Over time, the Merrow Machine Company pioneered the design of new machines to create a variety of overlock stitches, such as two- and four-thread machines, the one-thread butted seam, and the cutterless emblem edger.

A landmark lawsuit between Willcox &amp; Gibbs and the Merrow Machine Company in 1905 established the ownership and rights to the early mechanical development of overlocking to the Merrow Machine Company.

Throughout the early 20th century, areas of Connecticut and New York were the centres of textile manufacturing and machine production in the United States. Consequently, many overlock machine companies established themselves in the Northeastern United States.

In 1964 several engineers and managers at one Japanese manufacturer redesigned the industrial serger they were currently manufacturing as a smaller, lighter model intended for home use. They presented their concept to their employer, and after it was rejected they quit and formed the Juki Corporation.

Nick Tacony, founder of Tacony Corporation, introduced machinery for producing the overlock stitch (so called &quot;baby lock&quot;) to the United States market. This allowed sewing enthusiasts to produce clothing with finishing seams like those made by industrial garment manufacturers.

==Terminology==
In the United States, the term &quot;overlocker&quot; has largely been replaced by &quot;serger&quot;. However, in other parts of the world such as Australia and the UK, the term &quot;overlocker&quot; is still in use.

==Types==
Overlock stitches are classified in a number of ways. The most basic classification is by the number of threads used in the stitch. Industrial overlock machines are generally made in 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 thread formations. Each of these formations has unique uses and benefits:

* 1-thread: End-to-end seaming or &quot;butt-seaming&quot; of piece goods for textile finishing.
* 2-thread: Edging and seaming, especially on knits and wovens, finishing seam edges, stitching flatlock seams, stitching elastic and lace to lingerie, and hemming. This is the most common type of overlock stitch.
* 3-thread: Sewing pintucks, creating narrow rolled hems, finishing fabric edges, decorative edging, and seaming knit or woven fabrics.
* 4-thread: Decorative edging and finishing, seaming high-stress areas, mock safety stitches which create extra strength while retaining flexibility.
* 5-thread: In apparel manufacturing, safety stitches utilizing two needles create a very strong seam.

Two- and three-thread formations are also known as &quot;merrowing&quot; after the Merrow Machine Company.

Additional variables in the types of overlock stitches are the stitch eccentric, and the stitch width. The stitch eccentric indicates how many stitches per inch there are, which is adjustable and can vary widely within one machine. Different stitch eccentrics create more or less dense and solid-looking edges. The stitch width indicates how wide the stitch is from the edge of the fabric. Lightweight fabrics often require a wider stitch to prevent pulling.

Adding extra variation in stitch types is the differential feed feature, which allows feed to be adjusted; extra-fast feed creates a ruffled or &quot;lettuce-leaf&quot; effect. Finally, some merrowing machines contain parts to roll the fabric edge into the stitch for added durability.

==Formation==

# When the needle enters the fabric, a loop is formed in the thread at the back of the needle.
# As the needle continues its downward motion into the fabric, the lower looper begins its movement from left to right. The tip of the lower looper passes behind the needle and through the loop of thread that has formed behind the needle.
# The lower looper continues along its path moving toward the right of the serger. As it moves, the lower thread is carried through the needle thread.
# While the lower looper is moving from left to right, the upper looper advances from right to left. The tip of the upper looper passes behind the lower looper and picks up the lower looper thread and needle thread.
# The lower looper now begins its move back into the far left position. As the upper looper continues to the left, it holds the lower looper thread and needle thread in place.
# The needle again begins its downward path passing behind the upper looper and securing the upper looper thread (the needle goes between the metal and the thread) . This completes the overlock stitch formation and begins the stitch cycle all over again.

==Uses==
Overlock stitches are traditionally used for edging and light seaming. Other applications include:

* Sewing netting
* Butt-seaming is used for joining the ends of piece goods.
* Flat-locking
* Edging emblems
* Purl stitching
* Rolled hemming
* Decorative edging

<doc id="905123" wikidata="Q377051" url="?curid=905123" title="Stanislaus Zbyszko">
<text>Stanisław Jan Cyganiewicz (April 1, 1880 – September 23, 1967), better known by his ring name Stanislaus Zbyszko, and frequently referred to in the contemporary English-language press as Zbysco, was a Polish strongman and professional wrestler. He was a three-time World Heavyweight Champion in the United States during the 1920s. The surname &quot;Zbyszko&quot; was a nickname given to him by friends due to his bravery as a child. The name originates from a fictional medieval Polish knight in the historical novel &quot;The Knights of the Cross&quot; by Henryk Sienkiewicz, published in 1900. Stanislaus Zbyszko was the brother of Wladek Zbyszko (1891–1968).

==Early life==
Stanislaus Cyganiewicz was born on April 1, 1880, in Jodłowa near Kraków, Poland. He studied music, philosophy, and law while growing up in Vienna, Austria. Standing 5 ft 8 in (1.73 m) and weighing 260 pounds, Cyganiewicz joined the Vindobona Athletic Club while in college, where he developed a strong physique. He also participated in the Sokol, a Polish patriotic gymnastic society focused on the physical, mental, and cultural advancement of its members, as well as promoting discipline and patriotism. Towards the end of the 19th century, Cyganiewicz entered the wrestling industry after defeating an experienced grappler at a local circus in Poland. He was then recruited to Berlin by a local promoter. Inspired by strongman George Hackenschmidt, who had become Europe&#x27;s premier grappling star, Cyganiewicz pursued a career in wrestling. He was introduced to professional wrestling by the Polish grappler Władysław Pytlasiński, who became his mentor.

==Wrestling career==
Over the next few years, Cyganiewicz gradually established himself among Europe&#x27;s fastest rising Greco-Roman wrestlers while competing in various tournaments. By 1903, Health &amp; Strength listed him among the continent&#x27;s leading heavyweights. He eventually adopted the ring name Stanislaus Zbyszko. In 1906, he battled Russia&#x27;s &quot;Cossack&quot; Ivan Poddubny to a two-hour draw and later won a prestigious tournament in Paris by outlasting Georg Lurich and Constant le Marin.

He was brought to England by Charles &quot;C.B.&quot; Cochrane, previously Hackenschmidt&#x27;s manager, and engaged in prominent matches against Turkey&#x27;s &quot;Champion of the Bosphorus&quot; Kara Suliman at the London Pavilion and the Gibbons music halls. A major controversy arose when it was revealed that Suliman was actually Bulgaria&#x27;s Ivan Offtharoff, employed by Zbyszko and Cochrane, marking one of the earliest public revelations of wrestling&#x27;s &quot;theatrical hoaxes&quot;.

As Zbyszko started to compete more often in England and the United States, he transitioned to catch-as-catch-can freestyle wrestling, alternating between grappling styles as he traveled between continents and countries. Already billed as Europe&#x27;s Greco-Roman champion, he was recognized among the world&#x27;s top catch wrestlers after fighting Frank Gotch to a one-hour draw in November 1909 in Buffalo, NY. The following year, he achieved notable victories over Dr. Ben Roller and the Terrible Turk Youssuf Mahmout, solidifying his reputation among the world&#x27;s elite grapplers. He set up a highly anticipated rematch with Gotch at the Chicago Coliseum on June 1, 1910, for the undisputed World Heavyweight Championship. However, Gotch pinned Zbyszko in just 6.4 seconds, which led to controversy and protests from Zbyszko.

Despite the controversial loss, Zbyszko was regarded as one of the premier wrestlers in the world. He then faced the challenge of India&#x27;s undefeated champion, the Great Gama, in the finals of the John Bull World Championships in London on September 10, 1910. The match ended in a draw after nearly three hours, with Zbyszko employing a defensive strategy. The two were set to face each other again on September 17, 1910, but Zbyszko did not appear, and Gama was declared the winner by default. Over the next decade, Zbyszko competed in Europe while his younger brother, Wladek Zbyszko, while establishing himself among the top stars in the United States.

In 1927, it was announced that the Great Gama and Zbyszko would face each other again. They met for a highly anticipated rematch in 1928 in Patiala, which resulted in a win for Gama, who threw Zbyszko in 42 seconds.

==Championship controversy==

By this time, the industry had begun a gradual shift towards &quot;works&quot;; and Stanislaus Zbyszko was eventually recruited back to the U.S. by the &quot;Gold Dust Trio&quot; of Strangler Lewis, Billy Sandow, and Toots Mondt. Though now in his early 40s, Zbyszko was booked to defeat Lewis for the World Title on May 6, 1921; but his reign was ultimately a bust at the box office, and he relinquished the title back to Lewis on March 3, 1922. Around this time, a disagreement caused Joe Stecher to split from the Gold Dust Trio promotion, thus forming a separate wrestling faction. Zbyszko remained with the Trio, who were promoting ex-football player Wayne Munn as a charismatic new champion. In order to build up Munn&#x27;s credibility, the Trio booked him to successfully defend the title against Zbyszko on April 15, 1925; however, Zbyszko had secretly accepted a payoff from Tony Stecher (Joe&#x27;s brother/manager) to switch to their company. Consequently, Zbyszko betrayed the Trio by turning the match with Munn into a legitimate shoot, pinning the non-wrestler again and again until the referee was forced to award the title to the 47-year-old veteran, who then dropped the title to Stecher a month later to complete the ploy. This was one of the last times a World Title changed hands legitimately; and the legacy of this conspiracy was momentous, as it would be decades before promoters would ever feel comfortable putting their title on a non-wrestler again, thus fueling the support for expert &quot;hooker&quot; Lou Thesz to serve as a champion throughout the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s.

==Retirement==
In 1928, Zbyszko received a lucrative offer to wrestle the Great Gama in a rematch of their bout from 18 years earlier. Despite both men being past their primes, the match reportedly drew 60,000 fans and saw Great Gama defeat Zbyszko in 40 seconds. Following this match, Zbyszko retired and began scouting wrestling talent in South America, where he discovered Antonino Rocca, a multi-talented athlete who became one of the sport&#x27;s biggest stars. 

From their farm in Missouri, the Zbyszko brothers trained future legends Johnny Valentine and Harley Race. Stanislaus also had a supporting role in the movie &quot;Night and the City&quot; (1949). Director Jules Dassin cast Zbyszko for his authenticity as a wrestler. Dassin recalled that Zbyszko was a &quot;beautiful, cultured, multilingual man&quot; who embodied the image of a wrestler from his youth. Zbyszko often expressed his dissatisfaction with the industry&#x27;s evolution into a form of showmanship.

Stanislaus Zbyszko died of a heart attack on September 23, 1967, at age 88. He was praised by Strangler Lewis as one of the best legitimate wrestlers of all time. In tribute, his surname was later adopted by Larry Zbyszko.

In 1983, Stanislaus Zbyszko was inducted into the National Polish American Sports Hall of Fame.

<text>DRO Records (often referred to simply as DRO) was a Spanish independent record label founded in 1982 by members of the band Aviador Dro. It is one of Spain&#x27;s first independent record labels. During the 1980s DRO was an important label for independent artists in Spain, especially in Madrid.

==Name==
DRO is an acronym which stands for &quot;Discos Radioactivos Organizados&quot; ().
In the 1990s, the multinational label Eastwest Records acquired DRO. Following the acquisition the label was renamed DRO EastWest.

==History==
DRO Records was founded in Spain in 1982 by members of the band Aviador Dro. The label, which was one of the earliest independent labels in Spain, was created in order to give the band the resources to publish their music after being rejected by major labels. At the time, alternative music was emerging in Spain, especially around Madrid. DRO and other independent labels helped alternative artists distribute their music to wider audiences in the 1980s. Because of its role as a label for important artists during this time, the label has been called a pioneer of Spanish independent music. Many of the most successful Spanish artists of the 1980s were signed to DRO.

In 1983, following the collapse of DRO&#x27;s distributor, Pancoca, the independent label Grabaciones Accidentales (GASA) began handling DRO&#x27;s distribution. GASA was absorbed into DRO in the following year. DRO also acquired another independent label, Twins, in 1989.

The DRO-GASA group was ultimately acquired by Warner Music Group in 1993 due to financial pressures. The label current operates as DRO EastWest, SA.

<doc id="905134" wikidata="Q3562217" url="?curid=905134" title="Fox–Wisconsin Waterway">
<text>The Fox–Wisconsin Waterway is a waterway formed by the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers. First used by European settlers in 1673 during the expedition of Marquette &amp; Joliet, it was one of the principal routes used by travelers between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River until the completion of the Illinois and Michigan Canal in 1848 and the arrival of railroads. The western terminus of the Fox–Wisconsin Waterway was at the Mississippi at Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin. It continued up the Wisconsin River about until reaching Portage, Wisconsin. There travelers would portage to the Upper Fox River, or eventually, use the Portage Canal. It continued about down the Fox River, following it through Lake Winnebago and continuing on the Lower Fox over 170 feet (50 m) of falls to the eastern terminus of Green Bay.

In the mid-19th century, the waterway was improved with numerous locks, dams and canals, including the Portage Canal between the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers. All the locks were not completed until 1876, well after the Illinois and Michigan Canal and at the point where the move from canals to railroads was in full swing. Later development on the waterway introduced barriers to navigation, such as the Prairie du Sac Dam. Use of the waterway was never substantial and it slowly died out. The Portage Canal was closed in 1951 and most of the Upper Fox River locks and dams fell into disuse. The lock system on the Lower Fox River, from Lake Winnebago to Green Bay, was closed in 1983 to prevent the upstream spread of invasive species such as the lamprey.

The Fox-Wisconsin is no longer used as a transportation route between the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes. However, the various reaches of the waterway enjoy significant recreational use. Plans are well advanced for reopening the Lower Fox locks and dams. 

==Reaches==
The Waterway can be divided into four physical reaches: the Lower Wisconsin River, &quot;The Portage&quot; canal and locks at Portage, the Upper Fox River and the Lower Fox River.

==Physical description==

Overall the system is about long. It begins in the west at the Mississippi River, rises at a nearly constant rate to Portage, crosses the Great-Lakes/Mississippi River divide at Portage, descends slowly along the Upper Fox to the Lake Winnebago Pool and then plunges in a short reach to the eastern end at the head of Green Bay on Lake Michigan.

===Lower Wisconsin===
The lower Wisconsin River flows through glacial drift until it enters the Driftless Area and eventually reaches the Mississippi River. It extends about 116 river miles (187 river kilometers) from Portage to its confluence with the Mississippi River, falling from about elevation above sea level (msl) at Portage to , msl at the Mississippi.

The reach has nearly uniform hydraulic gradient of about 1.5 feet per mile (0.3 m/km). There is only one major tributary, the Kickapoo River, which enters just before the Mississippi at about River Mile 16 (River km 26). Since there are no major tributaries, river discharge in the reach are relatively constant, averaging about at USGS gage 05407000 at Muscoda.

The river channel is dominated by sand. Sand bars, tow-head islands and new, multiple channels form often and constantly change. The channel is wide and shallow.

===The Portage===
The portage at Portage, Wisconsin is not unique as a passage between the Great Lakes and Mississippi River watersheds. Similar passages exist all along the watershed divide, for instance, at Chicago and in the northern Indiana area. What is unique is that, while the Fox is a small stream—typical of such passages—the Wisconsin is a large river, already over long. The divide between the two rivers has little grade change, although it is marshy. The Wisconsin occasionally flowed across the Portage into the Fox during high water. The Fox and Wisconsin have modified their courses and outlets over geological time and it is likely that either river has flowed into either watershed. Only about separate the two rivers. The Fox River end of the canal is at about elevation msl. The Wisconsin River end is slightly higher, depending on Wisconsin River discharge levels.
The Portage lies about 116 river miles (187 km) from the Mississippi River and 162 river miles (261 km) from Green Bay.

===Upper Fox===
The upper Fox River flows northwest from its headwater to within the Portage. It then flows to the north-northeast to the Lake Winnebago Pool. It extends about 110 river miles (177 km) from Portage to Lake Winnebago, falling only about from elevation , msl at the Portage to , msl at Lake Winnebago.

The reach has a shallow grade. The hydraulic gradient averages about 4 inches per mile (0.06 m/km). There are two very shallow lakes along the way, Buffalo Lake and Puckaway Lake. The river drainage area grows significantly in size from at the Portage to about at USGS gage 004073500 at Berlin, where the average flow is about . The river discharge would grow at nearly the same proportions. Thus the Upper Fox grows from a small stream to a small river over its course. At Big Lake Butte des Morts it is joined from the north by flow from the Wolf River through Lake Poygan. The drainage area of Wolf River is more than twice the size of the drainage area of the Fox. But this extra flow joins the Fox only after it reaches the Lake Winnebago Pool.

The river channel is characterized by sand, silt and organic material. The channel, which ranges from , is shallow and generally widens and deepens as it approaches Lake Winnebago.

===Lower Fox===
The lower Fox River flows from the natural impoundment of Lake Winnebago to Lake Michigan. It extends about 39 river miles (63 km) from Menasha at the head of Lake Winnebago to Lake Michigan, falling from about elevation , msl at Winnebago to , msl at Green Bay. The reach has a very steep and changing grade. While the hydraulic gradient averages about 4 feet per mile (0.75 m/km), there are very large falls at (using the original French nomenclature) La Grand Kaukilin (Kaukauna), La Petite Chute (Little Chute) and La Grand Chute (Appleton). The total drop of these falls is approximately the same as Niagara Falls, although over a much longer stretch.

There are no major tributaries. Thus the river discharge is nearly constant, averaging about at USGS gage 040851385 at Green Bay.

==History prior to modifications==
The reach served as a highway for Native American peoples and, later, European explorers and fur traders both indigenous and European. They used the Fox and Wisconsin rivers as a primary highway between the Great Lakes and Mississippi River. In fact, it was the most heavily traveled of all the portages between the Great Lakes and Mississippi watersheds. From the Portage, one could travel north to nearly Lake Superior along the Upper Wisconsin River, west to the Mississippi along the Lower Wisconsin River, or northeast along the Fox River to Lake Michigan. Other watersheds, such as the Wolf River to north central Wisconsin or the Rock River to the Illinois country, were within easy distance.
In the 17th century the area was dominated by a number of tribes, Ho Chunk (Winnebago), Menominee, Kickapoo and Chippewa tribes among them.

The earliest French explorers were Father Marquette and Joliet in the summer of 1673. The French controlled the area for roughly 100 years until the end of the French and Indian War. Pressures from the French colonization of the eastern St Lawrence River and Great Lakes region eventually forced Fox and Sac tribes to the region, displacing the original tribes. The Fox and Sac, realizing the importance of the Waterway, set up toll stations at portage locations. The French, resentful of lost trade, engaged the Fox in a series of wars known as the Fox Wars.

French traders dominated the Waterway. They set up forts or settlements at La Baye (Green Bay), Portage (eventually Fort Winnebago), and Prairie du Chien. Their influence is apparent from the remaining place names and features: Prairie du Chien, Portage, De Pere, and Lake Butte des Morts to name a few. In fact, property in parts of Prairie du Chien, Portage, Kaukauna and Green Bay, all along the Waterway, still use French long-lot descriptions. All four cities are among the oldest in Wisconsin and the region.

The British officially controlled the area until the end of the American Revolutionary War and nominally until the end of the War of 1812, after which the American government was in firm control. The Fox were not totally displaced from the Waterway until 1832, when American troops forced them out during the Blackhawk War.

==Modifications==
The arrival of steamships to the region and the success of eastern canal systems, especially the Erie Canal, prompted various groups to look for improvements to the Waterway. In fact, there was great speculative pressure to capitalize on the natural extension of the Erie Canal to the Mississippi and beyond. Into the 1850s, most products from the Midwest traveled the long journey down the Mississippi and east from New Orleans. This shipment was expensive, absorbed farmers&#x27; profits and retarded economic growth. Promotion of the Portage Canal pointed to the economic advantage of a direct waterway connecting the Great Lakes to the Mississippi to spur local economic growth.

The earliest improvements along the Fox–Wisconsin Waterway began with a canal and lock at Portage. In 1829, Morgan Martin founded the Summit Portage Canal and Road Company to build the Portage canal. Chronically short of funds and impacted by depression in the 1830s, the company failed to complete the canal by 1838. About the same time, Congress had the Corps of Engineers (Corps) review the situation. It was recognized that the work would not only include a canal at Portage, but improvements along the length of both rivers between their mouths and the canal. In 1837 and 1839, the Corps examined the waterway&#x27;s feasibility and recommended a &quot;slack-water&quot; (lock and dam) system. After numerous memorials from the territorial legislature, Congress authorized a land grant for the waterway project in 1846. There were various private companies formed to promote and build the Waterway; besides the Summit Portage company, there were the Fox and Wisconsin Improvement and the Green Bay and Mississippi Canal Companies. In 1872, the Corps assumed supervision of the waterway.

===Lower Wisconsin===
Along the Lower Wisconsin there were initially no plans for improvements other than dredging and the clearing of snags. This soon proved to be inadequate. In 1868, the Corps began to experiment with wing dams and dredging to sluice out a 6-foot (1.8 m) deep channel. By 1880, the Corps had completed 157 dams totaling over , mainly in two sections: between Portage and Prairie du Sac and between Lone Rock and Boscobel. But the wing dams also proved inadequate and steamboats were not willing to risk the passage. In 1887, the Corps recommended to stop this method of improvement, effectively closing the Lower Wisconsin to commercial traffic.

Accordingly, little commercial traffic was ever maintained along this reach of the Waterway.

In 1914 the Prairie du Sac hydroelectric plant was completed creating Lake Wisconsin. This dam marks the lowest of a string of hydroelectric and recreational dams that extend up the Upper Wisconsin almost to its headwaters.

===The Portage ===
Construction initiated along the Portage Canal in 1849 and finished in 1851. In 1856, the first steamship from the Mississippi, the Aquila, passed through the Portage on its way to Green Bay, signaling the opening of the waterway. The lock and canal were improved several times, culminating in the construction of a concrete structure in 1928. There was a guard lock on the Wisconsin (Portage Lock) and a lifting lock to lower boats to the Fox (Fort Winnebago Lock). Each lock was long and wide.

Eventually, as in other parts of the Waterway, traffic dropped off and generally included only pleasure craft. By 1900 there was virtually no traffic to the east to Montello. The Wisconsin side of the canal was impacted by floods and sand bars from the Wisconsin. The Canal and Fox River approaches required dredging. In 1959, the Corps closed and dismantled most of the Fort Winnebago Lock to create a waste weir for water-level control. With a limited number of changes, it converted the Portage Lock to a water control structure. In 1961, the ownership of the canal was transferred from the Department of Army to the State Of Wisconsin.

===Upper Fox===
Along the Upper Fox, only dredging was initially performed. Over time, several dams and locks were added. In the end 7 stone locks, each with about 5 feet (1.6 m) of lift, were constructed at Governor&#x27;s Bend, Montello, Grand River, Princeton, White River, Berlin and Eureka. Each lock was about long and wide.

Dredging was mandatory given the low flow of the Upper Fox. By 1899, dredging had created a 6-foot (1.8 m) deep channel to Berlin, a 4-foot (1.2 m) deep between Berlin and Montello, and a 3-foot (0.9 m) deep channel to the Portage. But the river soon filled with silt when dredging halted.

Initially traffic—primarily steamboats, tugs, and barges carrying primarily lumber, coal, and grain—was sufficient for operations. In 1867 the Corps reported that &quot;[t]he country between Berlin and Portage is almost entirely dependent on the river for transportation&quot;. But the impact of railroads was soon felt. Travel and commerce on the Lower Fox declined by the 1880s to a few hundred tons of wheat per month during harvest. By this time most produce could be transported more easily by railroad. Except for a reprise during World War I, by the early 20th century most traffic was pleasure craft.

By 1922 dredging halted, as annual traffic was only about 1000 short tons (1000 metric tons). That same year, the Corps report recommended closing the Upper Fox, but Congress failed to act on the proposal. The Corps finally closed the Upper Fox to navigation between Portage and Eureka in 1951 and transferred it to the state as a recreational waterway. It modified dams to maintain water levels appropriate for wildlife preservation. The federal government quitclaimed its property along the Upper Fox to the State in 1961.

===Lower Fox===
Along the Lower Fox, Martin organized several groups to work on the task of building dams, locks and canals to bypass the numerous falls. The chief technical difficulty was the construction of locks and dams to lift vessels to Lake Winnebago. The dams began at De Pere and continued to Lake Winnebago at Menasha. The greatest concentration of locks was in the reach between Kaukauna to the Cedars, where the Great Kauklin and La Petite Chute falls had to be bypassed.

Martin began construction in 1830. His promotions for laborers reached Europe and had the direct impact of promoting immigration directly to the area. Irish settlers settled the town of Wrightstown. Dutch settlers founded Little Chute (La Petite Chute) and Holland. By 1850, Martin&#x27;s company had folded and was taken over by the State of Wisconsin. The Lower Fox locks and dams were completed by 1856, with the completion of the Little Chute and Menasha Locks.

Over time, the dams and locks were improved, combined and updated. In the end 17 locks were constructed, each with about of lift. Each lock was long and wide. Dredging was required on many of the short canals and slack-water sections to maintain a deep channel.

Travel and commerce on the Lower Fox proved to be the most profitable of all reaches. Boats carried passengers, mail and a host of products. The total tonnage along the Fox Waterway remained between 150,000 and 300,000 tons through the early 1930s. Local industry along the river, using the power of the various falls, provided a steady market for goods. Regular steamboat travel continued until the 1900.

Even here, however, railroads dominated transportation. Traffic declined sharply. In 1983, the entire system was put into &quot;caretaker&quot; status and the Federal government stopped all maintenance. The state of Wisconsin operated the locks through the 1987 navigation season. After the 1987 navigation season, canals were drained and lock gates were permanently sealed. The lock at Rapide Croche was sealed shut to prevent sea lampreys from reaching Lake Winnebago. Recently, the system has been undergoing a refurbishment with plans to make navigation a reality again.

===Summary===
In the end, the Fox–Wisconsin Waterway did not become the natural extension of the Erie Canal. There were two technical problems that were not effectively solved for the Waterway: control of the sand bars of the Lower Wisconsin and the low flow of the Upper Fox. Economically, the Waterway failed to compete with the canals in the Chicago area or with the reliability of railroads.

==Current situation==
Each of the Waterway reaches is being transformed.

===Lower Wisconsin===
Downstream of the Prairie du Sac Dam at dam, the Wisconsin is un-dammed for to its confluence with the Mississippi, one of the longest such stretches in the eastern United States. It is a popular canoe and small craft recreational area. Most of its course is within the Lower Wisconsin State Riverway founded in 1998. The project &quot;seeks to protect and preserve the scenic beauty and natural character of the river valley, seeks to manage the resources of the area for the long-term benefit of the citizens of the state and seeks to provide a quality public recreational area in a manner consistent with the resource and aesthetic protection goals and objectives&quot;.

Upstream of the dam, Lake Wisconsin is one of several large lakes popular with boaters and fishermen.

There is little likelihood that commercial traffic will return to this reach in the near future.

===The Portage===
Current efforts are to restore the Portage Locks as a historical artifact. The Canal has been placed on the National and State Register of Historic Places through the efforts of the Portage Canal Society, Inc. In 1983, the downtown corridor between Adams Street and the Wisconsin River was restored with City of Portage and Block Grant funds. In 1987, the south bank of the canal became part of the National Ice Age Trail.

There is little likelihood that commercial traffic will return to this reach in the near future.

===Upper Fox===
The goal of the Wisconsin DNR is to restore the Upper Fox to a more natural state. All locks except for the most downstream at Eureka have been abandoned or removed. The dam at White River was removed in 2004. Plans are to remove all dams, except for those at Princeton and Montello downstream of Lake Puckaway and Buffalo Lake, respectively. The dam at Eureka has been converted into a fishway to allow spawning fish to migrate upstream, although the locks continue to operate.
There is little likelihood that commercial traffic will return to this reach in the near future.

===Lower Fox===
All of the locks along the Lower Fox have been placed on the National and State Register of Historic Places. Since 1983 efforts were made to save the locks from permanent closure. In 2001, the Army Corps of Engineers transferred ownership of the 17 locks that make up the Lower Fox River, Corps Office and property in Kaukauna, and the harbors of Stockbridge and Brothertown on Lake Winnebago to the State of Wisconsin. The Fox River Navigational System Authority was formed and a cost-sharing agreement was created. Funds from the Army Corps of Engineers, the State of Wisconsin, and private donations have combined to rehabilitate, reopen, and maintain the locks. While the locks on the entire Lower Fox (with the exception of Rapide Croche) have been restored and are capable of operation, some remain closed to navigation. The Menasha lock is closed to prevent movement of the round goby, an invasive species, into Lake Winnebago. An electric fish barrier is proposed to allow the lock to reopen. The Kaukauna locks are closed to navigation for 35 years until 2021 when repairs to Veterans Memorial Lift Bridge were completed by City of Kaukauna.

Rapid Croche Lock will remain permanently sealed as a barrier to sea lampreys. A boat lift and transfer station have been proposed to allow navigation through the entire Lower Fox River Navigational System. This transfer station would include measures to cleanse the boats of aquatic invasive species when traveling upstream into the Winnebago Pool.

There is little likelihood that commercial freight traffic will return to this reach. Recreational boats, and commercial tour boats, use the locks regularly.

<text>In fluid mechanics a Riabouchinsky solid is a technique used for approximating boundary layer separation from a bluff body using potential flow. It is named after Dimitri Pavlovitch Riabouchinsky.

Riabouchinsky solids are typically used for analysing the behaviour of bodies moving through otherwise quiescent fluid (examples would include moving cars, or buildings in a windfield).

Typically the streamline that touches the edge of the body is modelled as having no transverse pressure gradient and thus may be styled as a free surface after separation.

The use of Riabouchinsky solids renders d&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s paradox void; the technique typically gives reasonable estimates for the drag offered by bluff bodies moving through inviscid fluids.

<doc id="905145" wikidata="Q7111397" url="?curid=905145" title="Out-of-box experience">
<text>An out-of-box experience (OOBE ( )) is the experience an end-user has when taking a product after unboxing, or for digital distribution, runs the installer, and is preparing to first use it, as opposed to the point-of-sale experience or the interaction experience of an expert user. In computing, this includes the initial configuration of a piece of hardware or software on a computer. The out-of-box experience is typically the first impression a product creates, such as the ease with which a buyer can begin using the product. For hardware products, a positive OOBE can be created with logical easy-to-follow instructions and good quality of manufacturing. It can also be defined as the experience an online shopper has when receiving an item in the mail, that begins with the box itself (style, design), how the item is presented when opening the box (packing material, pack configuration, how item is position when opening, cords neatly wrapped, etc), what the paperwork looks like and includes (well designed packing slip, a thank you note from the vendor, return form, etc). 
Microsoft uses this term, particularly, to refer to the user experience that takes place after software installation, and immediately following the first launch of a software product.

== Out-of-box failure ==
An out-of-box failure (OBF or OOBF) refers to the perceived failure of a product that occurs immediately upon first usage. In relations to computing, an out-of-box failure can refer to the immediate failure mode when installing or performing initial configuration on a piece of computer hardware or software, or a physical defect involving the installation media which requires a return and acquisition of a non-defective product. Causes for out-of-box failures include poor quality control, wrong configuration of the product, and bugs/glitches if the failure is software-related. It can be highly detrimental to the value of the brand, retailer, or OEM, especially when customer expectations for the product are high.

<text>Fermin Muguruza (born 20 April 1963) is a Spanish Basque rock musician, singer, songwriter, producer, record label manager, and co-founder of the ska punk band Kortatu, active from 1983 to 1988, and of the crossover group Negu Gorriak, active from 1990 to 1996.

Born in Irun, Basque Autonomous Community, Spain, he is the brother of musicians and and is one of the personalities interviewed for the documentary film &quot;The Basque Ball&quot;, released in 2003.

==Musical career==

Muguruza has taken part in more than twenty albums, and is one of the most important artists from the Basque Country.

In 1983 he founded a fusion ska punk band called Kortatu with his brother Iñigo and drummer Treku Armendariz, among the first to popularise ska in Spain. They were influenced by the Clash, in fact, Muguruza decided to create the band after seeing Strummer&#x27;s band in a gig in Donostia on May 2, 1981. His song &quot;Sarri, Sarri&quot;, a Basque cover of Toots &amp; the Maytals&#x27; &quot;Chatty Chatty&quot;, grew into a highly popular song during the 80s, where he makes an explicit reference to Joseba Sarrionaindia&#x27;s artful escape from prison in 1985.

In 1988 the group disbanded, but Fermin and Iñigo would come together again in 1990 to create the crossover group Negu Gorriak, along with Kaki Arkarazo, who had produced Kortatu&#x27;s last records. In 1997 he collaborated with . More recently he has developed a solo career, always defending the use of the Basque language and the need for social justice.

==Views on society and politics==
In interviews he has persistently denounced the policies of the Basque, Spanish and French governments and police bodies as well as of Spanish nationalist groups. At an international level, Fermin Muguruza holds left-wing views that lead him to criticize the U.S. government, corporations and the globalization process, all of which he denounces as imperialistic and homogenizing.

In an interview with Freemuse, Muguruza speaks about his experience as a musician under the democracy of today. He has performed in concerts where fascists would come to his concerts with bombs, threatening him and his Basque hip-hop music. However, he experiences censorship within Spain for his political and social messages, but still performs and makes music, saying &quot;authorities are afraid of my music because it is a tool against ignorance. And these authorities want the ignorance so that they can do what they want&quot;.

Musically, he has been inspired by the, in his opinion, oppression of Spain over Basque Country. And although most of his lyrics are in Basque, his compositions are a melting pot of different cultures, with a big influence of Jamaican and electronic music (especially drum and bass), which he commonly mixes over Basque instruments. In his track &quot;Euskal Herria Jamaika Clash!, Fermin Muguruza mixes Jamaican rhythms with sounds from Basque traditional musical instruments to produce unique musical hybrids that feature Basque heritage and culture.

<doc id="905152" wikidata="Q366237" url="?curid=905152" title="Jeff Wilson (sportsman)">
<text>Jeffrey William Wilson (born 24 October 1973) is a New Zealand sportsman who has represented his country in both rugby union and cricket – a so-called &quot;Double All Black&quot;, an increasingly rare achievement in the professional era. He is also a basketballer, and won national secondary school titles in track and field. With 44 tries in 60 tests, Wilson is ranked thirteenth on the list of highest test try scorers in rugby. Wilson is married to Adine Wilson (née Harper), former captain of the New Zealand national netball team.

==Rugby career==
===Early career===
Wilson was born at Invercargill in 1973 and attended Cargill High School, where in one rugby game against James Hargest College he scored nine tries and a total of 66 points in a game with a final score of 102–6. At the time tries were only worth 4 points He played for the national secondary schools side against Australia in 1992.

===All Blacks rugby===
Wilson was first selected for the All Blacks on their 1993 tour of Britain, making his debut as an All Black against London and SE Division on 23 October 1993 and his test debut against Scotland on 20 November 1993, scoring three tries in that game.

He appeared 71 times for the All Blacks, including 60 tests and played in 1995 and 1999 Rugby World Cup, in the positions of wing and fullback. In Test matches he scored a total of 234 points: 44 tries, 1 conversion, 3 penalty goals, and 1 drop goal.

Wilson announced his retirement at the end of the 2000 Super 12 season, but made a comeback in 2001, playing another 6 Test matches before finally retiring in 2002 at the relatively young age of 28. Wilson stated he would have stayed on had John Hart continued to coach the All Blacks.

Up until 2002, he held the All Blacks try scoring record, with 44 tries from his 60 Test matches. This was later overtaken by fullback Christian Cullen and then Doug Howlett.

In the 2003 New Year Honours, Wilson was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to rugby.

===Domestic rugby===
Wilson played Super 12 rugby for the Highlanders and NPC rugby for Otago and Southland. He made his Southland debut in 1992, his Otago debut in 1993 and his Highlanders debut in 1996, with whom he remained for his entire career. Wilson made 56 appearances for Otago and 72 for the Highlanders.

==Cricket career==
Before making his senior cricket debut, Wilson played Hawke Cup cricket for Southland from 1988–89, for the Otago under-20 side the following season and for a variety of New Zealand age-group sides, including the national under-19 team. He made his senior debut for Otago in a List A match against Auckland in 1991 before making his first-class debut the following month. Playing as an all-rounder, he was a regular in the Otago side throughout the early 1990s, playing 29 first-class matches and taking 93 wickets for the side.

Wilson&#x27;s international debut came at the age of 19 during the 1992–93 season. He played four One Day Internationals (ODI) against the touring Australians, a few months before his All Black debut. The arrival of the professional Super 12 rugby competition, which overlaps the cricket season by more than six weeks, forced him to decide which sport to pursue, truncating his international cricket career, although he continued to play for Otago until the end of the 1996–97 season.

In May 2002 Wilson, aged 28, announced his retirement from rugby and that he would be returning to cricket. He returned to the Otago team in the 2002–03 season, although injury limited his appearances. The following season he took 23 first-class wickets and scored an average of 52 runnings an innings for Otago before being called back into the New Zealand team during the 2004–05 season. His inclusion in the squad to play a World XI in January 2005 was seen as a surprise and was criticised by some commentators and players, but he played in all three matches during the series taking five wickets, including three for six runs (3/6) in the final match.

Later in the season he was included in the squad for a one-off Twenty20 International against Australia―the first T20 International match played. He played in the match and was also included for the ODI series on Australia&#x27;s tour of New Zealand, playing in the second and fourth matches of the series. At almost 12 years, the gap between Wilson&#x27;s ODI appearances set a record for the longest time elapsed between two appearances in ODIs.

Following the end of the 2004–05 season, Wilson had an operation to remove bone spurs from an ankle―an injury which had first been operated on in 2000 and was a result of his rugby career. The injury continued to cause problems during the 2005–06 season and he made only a single one-day appearance for Otago before having to undergo a second operation in early 2006. He did not play top-level cricket again.

== Post-retirement ==
After retirement Wilson spent the next few months breeding horses on a farm in Canterbury. In May 2006 he accepted a position with the Otago Rugby Football Union to promote rugby within the Otago-Southland region in a development role. Rugby officials stated that &quot;it&#x27;s a brand new position, essentially it&#x27;s going to be talent identification, a lot of mentoring and coaching one-on-one stuff.&quot; Wilson has since progressed to take on the role of Director of Rugby with the Otago Rugby Football Union, dealing with all aspects of the professional game. 

Wilson was the assistant coach of the North Harbour team in the ITM Cup between 2009 and 2012. In 2011 it was announced he would join the Auckland Blues as a skills coach for the 2012 season.

In 2013 he became a Sport Radio Breakfast Host with Ian Smith and Nathan Rarere on LiveSPORT Radios Breakfast of Champions. On 7 September 2013, according to the live pregame commentary between All Blacks vs. Argentina, Jeff Wilson was signed by Sky Sports to commentate full-time for both rugby and cricket. Since then, Wilson has become a regular commentator for the channel.

<doc id="905156" wikidata="Q5108770" url="?curid=905156" title="Christ Church Burial Ground">
<text>Christ Church Burial Ground in Philadelphia is an important early-American cemetery. It is the final resting place of Benjamin Franklin and his wife, Deborah. Four other signers of the Declaration of Independence are buried here, Benjamin Rush, Francis Hopkinson, Joseph Hewes, and George Ross. Two additional signers of the Declaration of Independence, James Wilson and Robert Morris, are buried at Christ Church just a few blocks away.

==History==
The cemetery belongs to Christ Church, the Episcopal church, which was founded in 1695 and served as a place of worship for many of the most notable participants in the American Revolution, including George Washington. The burial ground is located at 5th and Arch streets, across from the Visitors Center and National Constitution Center in Center City Philadelphia. The Burial Ground was opened in 1719, and is still an active cemetery. The Burial Ground is open to the public for a small fee, weather permitting; about 100,000 tourists visit each year.

===Ben Franklin gravesite===
When the burial ground is closed, one can still view Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s gravesite from the sidewalk at the corner of 5th and Arch Streets through a set of iron rails. The bronze rails in the brick wall were added for public viewing in 1858 by parties working at the behest of the Franklin Institute, which assumed the responsibility of defending Franklin&#x27;s historic ties to Philadelphia after prominent Bostonians criticized the city&#x27;s maintenance of the grave and erected a Franklin statue there. Leaving pennies on Franklin&#x27;s grave is an old Philadelphia tradition.

<doc id="905158" wikidata="Q1756258" url="?curid=905158" title="Sahara Hotnights">
<text>Sahara Hotnights are a Swedish rock band from Robertsfors. Since its inception, the band has been composed of lead singer Maria Andersson, drummer Josephine Forsman and sisters Jennie (lead guitar) and Johanna (bass) Asplund. Their style incorporates elements of garage rock, power pop and punk rock. The band scored two top-ten singles and five top-ten albums in their native Sweden during their initial run between 1992 and 2011. The band reformed in 2019, releasing their seventh album &quot;Love in Times of Low Expectations&quot; in 2022.

== History ==
The band formed sometime around 1991/1992 &quot;due to boredom&quot;. While in Australia, Josephine Forsman bet on a horse named Sahara Hotnights and used the name for the band. Around 1995, they won a &quot;battle of the bands&quot; contest and were rewarded with a chance to record their songs in a studio, including demo cassette &quot;Oh Darcy&quot;. Their debut EP, &quot;Suits Anyone Fine&quot;, was released in 1997 to immediate success and critical acclaim in Europe. Soon afterwards, the band signed with the Swedish label Speech Records, and over the next two years released three further singles, &quot;Face Wet&quot;, &quot;Oh Darling!&quot; and &quot;Nothing Yet&quot;. In 1999, Sahara Hotnights released their debut studio album &quot;C&#x27;mon Let&#x27;s Pretend&quot;, which earned two Grammis nominations.

The &quot;Drive Dead Slow EP&quot; appeared in April 2000, released on the BMG label, before the band&#x27;s second album &quot;Jennie Bomb&quot; (named for Jennie Asplund) was released in 2001 (2002 in the US). The timing of its release coincided with a surge in interest in Swedish rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll bands, such as The Hives, The (International) Noise Conspiracy, Mando Diao and Hellacopters. The songs &quot;On Top of Your World&quot; and &quot;With or Without Control&quot; were released as singles. &quot;Alright Alright (Here&#x27;s My Fist Where&#x27;s the Fight?)&quot; is featured in &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot;, &quot;Stormbreaker, New York Minute&quot; and on the &quot;&quot; &quot;soundtrack.&quot;

Sahara Hotnights opened for The Hives before releasing &quot;Kiss &amp; Tell&quot; on the RCA label in 2004. The tour sprouted from a relationship between Maria Andersson and The Hives&#x27; frontman Howlin&#x27; Pelle Almqvist. &quot;Hot Night Crash&quot; and &quot;Who Do You Dance For?&quot; were released as singles from the album. &quot;Hot Night Crash&quot; also appears on the soundtrack of &quot;Burnout 3: Takedown&quot; and &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Downhill Jam&quot;. The song &quot;No Big Deal&quot; is played in &quot;CKY4&quot;.

A new single entitled &quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot; culled from their fourth studio album &quot;What If Leaving Is a Loving Thing&quot; on Stand By Your Band Records was released via the band&#x27;s MySpace site. The album was released in April 2007. Commenting on the lyrics on the album, songwriter Maria Andersson said: &quot;If you read them you&#x27;ll understand. The good thing with being able to write lyrics is that you can sit here and shut up about it.&quot;

The band&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Sparks&quot;, a covers album, was released in 2009. In 2011, the band released its sixth album, eponymously titled Sahara Hotnights.

During early 2019, band members put out pictures from the studio. A new single &quot;Reverie&quot; was released on 18 February 2022 and their seventh album &quot;Love in Times of Low Expectations&quot; was released on 6 May 2022 supported by a Sweden-only tour during the Summer of 2022.

In 2024, social media posts suggested an eight studio album is being worked on.

<doc id="905168" wikidata="Q633841" url="?curid=905168" title="Archie Goodwin (comics)">
<text>Archie Goodwin (September 8, 1937 – March 1, 1998) was an American comic book writer, editor, and artist. He worked on a number of comic strips in addition to comic books, and is known for his Warren and Marvel Comics work. For Warren he was chief writer and editor of landmark horror anthology titles &quot;Creepy&quot; and &quot;Eerie&quot; between 1964 and 1967. At Marvel, he served as the company&#x27;s editor-in-chief from 1976 to the end of 1977. In the 1980s, he edited the publisher&#x27;s anthology magazine &quot;Epic Illustrated&quot; and its Epic Comics imprint. He is also known for his work on &quot;Star Wars&quot; in both comic books and newspaper strips. He is regularly cited as the &quot;best-loved comic book editor, ever.&quot;

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Archie Goodwin was born in Kansas City, Missouri, and lived in many small towns along the Kansas-Missouri border including Coffeyville, Kansas. He considered Tulsa, Oklahoma as his home town. There he spent his teen years at Will Rogers High School and in used magazine stores searching for EC Comics. and contributor to EC fanzines in the 50s. His classmates at Will Rogers included illustrator Paul Davis and &quot;Broomhilda&quot; creator Russell Myers forming a cartoonist&#x27;s club that met daily at the Owl Drugstore at 11th Street and Pittsburg in Tulsa. After one year at the University of Oklahoma, Goodwin moved to New York City to attend classes at what became the School of Visual Arts.

Goodwin began as an artist drawing cartoons for magazines and as a freelance &quot;writer and occasional art assistant&quot; to Leonard Starr&#x27;s newspaper comic strip &quot;Mary Perkins, On Stage&quot;. His first editorial work was for &quot;Redbook&quot; magazine from 1960 to 1964, on which he worked both before and after his Army service as a draftee. He also did cartoons for &quot;Fishing World&quot; magazine in 1959.

&quot;Comics writing is similar in form to writing a movie script or a play,&quot; Goodwin said in an article for the Tulsa Tribune, December 17, 1986. &quot;I write a description of the panel (stage setting), and then the captions (dialogue),&quot; he said. &quot;Since I have some art background, I might do a series of thumbnail drawings before I write anything. Comics writings is like any other kind of writing. You draw on everything that&#x27;s around you. Watching people on the street, eavesdropping in restaurants – sooner or later, you&#x27;re going to use all of that.&quot;

===Warren===
His first story written before he went into the Army was drawn by Al Williamson and Roy Krenkel and published in 1962 just after his discharge from the Army. He was never on staff at Harvey Comics. By 1964 he was the main script writer for Warren&#x27;s &quot;Creepy&quot; magazine. Much of his work there, according to Batman editor Mark Chiarello, was a &quot;homage to the favorite comics of his youth, the E.C. line.&quot; By the second issue he was co-credited (alongside Russ Jones) as editor, and soon became editor of the entire Warren line: &quot;Creepy&quot;, &quot;Eerie&quot; and &quot;Blazing Combat&quot;. He worked for Warren between 1964 and 1967, as head writer and Editor-in-Chief, in which roles he is credited with providing a mythology for Warren&#x27;s classic Vampirella character, as well as penning her most compelling stories. &quot;

After his departure from Warren in 1967, Goodwin would occasionally contribute stories over the next 15 years and even returned for a short stint as editor in 1974.

===Famous name===
Archie Goodwin&#x27;s first prose story was published by &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;, which warned him he could not use Archie Goodwin as a pen name because it was a Rex Stout character in the Nero Wolfe books. According to Goodwin&#x27;s wife Anne T. Murphy, the magazine&#x27;s editors &quot;then were so delighted when he wrote back to say that it was his real name that they used the anecdote as the introduction to the story, which ran in the July 1962 issue.&quot; (It was actually the July 1964 issue.)

===Comic strips===
From 1967 to 1980, Goodwin wrote scripts for King Features Syndicate, including the daily strip Secret Agent X-9, drawn by Al Williamson and editor Sylvan Byck, as well as working on other strips ghost writing &quot;Captain Kate&quot; by Hale and Jerry Skelly. He also worked with Williamson on &quot;Flash Gordan&quot; comics #3-7 published by King Comics in 1966.

&quot;Star Hawks&quot; was a comic strip created by Ron Goulart and Gil Kane, first published on October 3, 1977, that ran through May 2, 1981 by United Feature Syndicate. It was written through April 1979 by Goulart, followed by Archie Goodwin (1979–1980).

His experience ghost writing &quot;Dan Flagg&quot; inspired &quot;The Success Story&quot; (drawn by Williamson, who had ghosted on &quot;Flagg&quot;) for &quot;Creepy&quot; No. 1 (1964), famed among comic strip fans for its EC style dark humor in depicting a creator whose only contribution to the strip that made him rich was his signature.

=== &quot;Blackmark&quot; ===
Blackmark is a paperback book (Bantam S5871) published by the American company Bantam Books in January 1971. It is one of the first American graphic novels. It was conceived and drawn by comic book artist Gil Kane, and scripted by Archie Goodwin from an outline by Kane.

=== DC Comics ===
Goodwin worked briefly for DC Comics during the 1970s, where he edited the war comics &quot;G.I. Combat&quot;, &quot;Our Fighting Forces&quot;, and &quot;Star Spangled War Stories&quot;, and replaced Julius Schwartz as editor of &quot;Detective Comics&quot; for one year. Goodwin&#x27;s collaboration with Walt Simonson on the &quot;Manhunter&quot; back-up feature in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; won several awards. Goodwin also wrote the Batman lead feature in &quot;Detective Comics&quot;, where his collaborators included artists Jim Aparo, Sal Amendola, Howard Chaykin, and Alex Toth.

===Marvel Comics===
Goodwin first worked for Marvel Comics in 1968 and was the original writer on the &quot;Iron Man&quot; series which launched that year. According to Goodwin, when he entered editor Stan Lee&#x27;s office to apply for a job with Marvel, Lee was in the middle of writing an Iron Man story and handed him photostats of the pages he was working on for his writer&#x27;s test. Goodwin speculated, &quot;I assume if he had been working on &quot;Sgt. Fury&quot;, I&#x27;d have been writing &quot;Sgt. Fury&quot;. Thank God he wasn&#x27;t writing &quot;Millie the Model&quot; when I walked in.&quot; Goodwin and artist George Tuska co-created the supervillain the Controller in &quot;Iron Man&quot; No. 12 (April 1969).

Luke Cage, the first African American superhero to star in an eponymous Marvel comic book series, was created by Goodwin and artist John Romita Sr. in June 1972. While briefly writing &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot; series, Goodwin and artist Gene Colan introduced the supporting character Rachel van Helsing. Goodwin co-created (with Marie Severin) the first Spider-Woman, as well as writing her first appearance in &quot;Marvel Spotlight&quot; No. 32 (February 1977).

Goodwin also co-designed Marvel&#x27;s New Universe line and created four of the eight series in the line. He explained, &quot;[Marvel editor-in-chief] Jim Shooter keeps saying of me: &#x27;Well, here&#x27;s this guy, in one meeting, he suddenly spews out half the ideas for the New Universe.&#x27; What that doesn&#x27;t take into account is that for about five or six years I&#x27;ve had these half-formed notions and finally here is a situation where they would all fit in. ...it wasn&#x27;t like I just went into the meeting and suddenly four concepts sprang full-blown from my brow.&quot;

====&quot;Star Wars&quot;====

In 1976, Goodwin replaced Gerry Conway to become the eighth editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics, with the understanding that it would only be temporary until a permanent replacement could be found. He ultimately resigned at the end of 1977 and was replaced by Jim Shooter. While Goodwin was editor-in-chief, Marvel secured the rights to publish the &quot;Star Wars&quot; film&#x27;s comic adaptation and tie-in series, which then sold phenomenally well (helped by a dearth of other &quot;Star Wars&quot; merchandise at the time) at a point when the comics industry was in severe decline. Goodwin recalled about the &quot;Star Wars&quot; comic book, &quot;That really worked ... but I can&#x27;t take any credit for it. Roy Thomas is the one who brought it to Marvel, and he had to push a little bit to get them to do it.&quot; He followed Thomas in adapting the &quot;Star Wars&quot; characters into an ongoing comic book with artist Carmine Infantino, as well as continuing the story (pre-&quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;) in a daily comic strip. Goodwin wrote the strips under his own name, although many websites and other sources erroneously claim he used the pseudonyms R.S. Helm and Russ Helm. Writer Mark Evanier corrected the matter by stating &quot;Archie did write the &quot;Star Wars&quot; comic strip (as well as other &quot;Star Wars&quot; material) but only under his own name. Russ Helm was a completely different person writing under his own name.&quot; During Goodwin and Infantino&#x27;s tenure on Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; series, it was one of the industry&#x27;s top selling titles. He wrote comic book adaptations for Marvel of the two &quot;Star Wars&quot; sequels as well as other science-fiction films such as &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; and &quot;Blade Runner&quot;.

=== &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; ===
Alien: The Illustrated Story, or simply Alien, is an American sixty-four-page graphic novel adaptation of the 1979 science fiction film &quot;Alien&quot; published by &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; magazine in 1979. It was scripted by Archie Goodwin and drawn by Walt Simonson. The book was a major critical and commercial success and was the first comic to ever be listed on the &quot;New York Times Bestsellers&quot; list.

While developing the comic, Goodwin worked from the original script. Simonson, as well, had access to production stills and even saw a rough cut of the film, which helped him capture the essence of the story. As a result, however, a few scenes that were cut from the final film ended up being included in the graphic novel.

One reviewer praised Archie Goodwin&#x27;s script adaptation, which he felt improved on some flaws in the film: &quot;Goodwin... seems to get more into the class divisions on board the &quot;Nostromo&quot; between Ripley and Parker... [T]he characters are a bit more fleshed out...&quot;

Heavy Metal published an eight-page teaser for the book in &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; magazine in vol. 3, No. 1 (May 1979). A second eight-page preview was published in &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; vol. 3, No. 2 (June 1979). The original 64-page trade paperback was released in June 1979 and distributed by Simon &amp; Schuster. The comic was also translated in Japanese, Spanish and Dutch.

====Epic====

After Marvel Comics passed on publishing the American incarnation of &quot;Metal Hurlant&quot; (&quot;Heavy Metal&quot;), Editor-in-chief Jim Shooter was charged with producing an alternate title, which became &quot;Epic Illustrated&quot;. It was initially edited by Rick Marschall, but Shooter approached publisher Stan Lee to urge a replacement: &quot;I told Stan, &#x27;There&#x27;s one guy who could do this. I don&#x27;t know if we can get him.&#x27; He said, &#x27;Who&#x27;s that?&#x27; &#x27;Archie Goodwin.&#x27; The reason I didn&#x27;t think we could get him is because he used to be my boss and I didn&#x27;t know how he&#x27;d feel about coming back and me being his boss.&quot;

Goodwin was at the time still working for Marvel as a writer, and Shooter recalls concocting a plan whereby the company &quot;pretended that Archie reported to Stan. In fact, I was doing all the paperwork and all the employee reviews and the budgets&quot; so that Goodwin could have the illusion of not working for his successor. In the autumn of 1979, Marschall was fired and Goodwin hired as &quot;Epic&quot;&#x27;s editor.

Shooter approached Goodwin after the moderate success of the &quot;Epic&quot; magazine and creator-owned graphic novels to produce a full-fledged line of creator-owned comics, Epic Comics. Goodwin initially balked at the additional workload, and Shooter turned the line over to Al Milgrom before Goodwin ultimately accepted editorship.

Goodwin introduced the first English translation of Katsuhiro Otomo&#x27;s &quot;Akira&quot; and published English translations of the work of Jean Giraud, a.k.a. Moebius. Archie also gave many writers and artists their first jobs in comic including Todd McFarlane in &quot;Coyote&quot; #11-14 with his first cover on issue 13.

===Return to DC===
Goodwin returned to DC Comics as an editor and writer in 1989. He wrote the graphic novel &quot;&quot; painted by Scott Hampton and published in 1992. Throughout the 1990s, Goodwin edited a number of Batman projects, including the Elseworlds miniseries &quot;&quot;, and the Alan Grant-written/Kevin O&#x27;Neill-illustrated parody one-shot &quot;Batman: Mitefall&quot;, a take-off of the &quot;&quot; saga, filtered through the character of Bat-Mite. &quot;Armageddon 2001&quot; was a 1991 crossover event storyline. It ran through a self-titled, two issue limited series and most of the annuals DC published that year from May through October. Each participating annual explored potential possible futures for its main characters. The series was written by Goodwin and Dennis O&#x27;Neil and drawn by Dan Jurgens.

Among Goodwin&#x27;s most notable last editorial projects were &quot;Starman&quot;, written by James Robinson and first published by DC in 1994 and DC&#x27;s &quot;&quot; by Tim Sale and Jeph Loeb. Loeb and Sale&#x27;s first work on Batman appeared in &quot;&quot; No. 1 (Dec. 1993) edited by Goodwin. It is a testament to Goodwin that Loeb has said that Goodwin inspired their portrayal of Gotham police chief Jim Gordon in &quot;The Long Halloween&quot; and its sequel &quot;&quot;, while Robinson (who considered Goodwin both a mentor and close personal friend), continued to list Goodwin as a &quot;Guiding Light&quot; on later issues of &quot;Starman&quot; published after Goodwin&#x27;s death. Goodwin edited &quot;&quot; and &quot;Azrael&quot;. Goodwin&#x27;s &quot;Creepy&quot; work is cited by editor Mark Chiarello as informing the creation of the &quot;&quot; series.

===Death===
In the Spring of 1990 he was diagnosed as having cancer and undertook a course of chemo-therapy while still working at DC. Goodwin died on March 1, 1998, after battling the disease for 8 years.

=== Archives ===
The Archie Goodwin Archive and Collection are housed at OKPOP (Oklahoma Museum of Pop Culture) in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Donated by his children Jennifer and Seth Goodwin.

==Awards==
Goodwin&#x27;s work won him a good deal of recognition in the industry, including both the 1973 Shazam Award for Best Writer (Dramatic Division), and the 1974 Shazam Award for Best Writer (Dramatic Division) for the Manhunter series running in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #437–443. In the same years, he also won Shazam Awards for Best Individual Short Story for &quot;The Himalayan Incident&quot; in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; No. 437 and for &quot;Cathedral Perilous&quot; in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; No. 441. In 1974, he also won Best Individual Feature-Length Story for &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; No. 443. All story awards were shared with Walt Simonson for &quot;Manhunter&quot; episodes). Goodwin&#x27;s work on &quot;Manhunter&quot;, in which he both updated an obscure Golden Age hero, and, in the series&#x27; last episode, took the daring approach of killing him off (one of the few comic book deaths that has actually &quot;taken&quot; and not been reversed or retconned away in the decades since it occurred) is very well regarded by both fans and other comics professionals.

Goodwin stated in his final interview, &quot;I think that &quot;Manhunter&quot; is one of just several projects that I&#x27;ve worked on that I consider a highlight in my career. It is something that I may never be able to top in a lot of ways. To have done that and for DC to have given me the opportunity to do that was great.&quot;

In 1980, he shared the Eagle Award for Favorite Comic Magazine given to &quot;Epic Illustrated.&quot;

In 1982, he received the Inkpot Award given by San Diego Comic-Con.

He threepeated winning the Harvey Award for Best American Edition of Foreign Material given to Epic&#x27;s collected Moebius albums in 1988, for Epic&#x27;s Moebius series &quot;The Incal&quot; in 1989 and in 1990 for Best Foreign Reprint given to Epic&#x27;s &quot;Akira&quot; series.

He won &quot;Bob Clampett Humanitarian&quot; Eisner Award in 1992.

In 1993, he won the Wizard Fan Award with Denny O&#x27;Neil, Joe Quesada and Kevin Nowlan for the Favorite Miniseries for &quot;.&quot;

He was named Best Editor by the Eisners in 1993. As well as receiving the UK Comic Art Award for Best Graphic Novel with Scott Hampton for &quot;Batman: Night Cries.&quot;

1997 brought more Harvey Awards to Archie by winning Best Domestic Reprint Project, with Bob Kahan, for &quot;Batman: The Dark Knight Returns 10th Anniversary Edition Hardcover.&quot;

Archie was also awarded two Eisner Awards in 1997. First with Gary Gianni for Best Short Story for &quot;Heroes&quot; from &quot;Batman: Black &amp; White&quot; and another with James Robinson, Tony Harris and Wade Von Grawbadger for Best Serialized Story for &quot;Starman&quot; &quot;Sand and Stars&quot; &quot;(Issues #20-23)&quot;

Goodwin was honored posthumously in 1998, by being named to the National Comics Award Roll of Honour and he was entered into the Eisner Hall of Fame.

In 2007, Goodwin was inducted into the Oklahoma Cartoonists Hall of Fame in Pauls Valley, Oklahoma, located in the Toy and Action Figure Museum.

In 2008, he was one of two recipients of that year&#x27;s Bill Finger Award, which annually honors one living and one deceased comics creator. The award was presented July 25, 2008, during the 2008 Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards ceremony at San Diego Comic-Con.

==Appearances within comics==
He makes a cameo appearance in a crowd scene on the splash page of &quot;Ms. Marvel&quot; volume 1 No. 15, (March 1978) with thought balloons showing him trying out various nicknames for himself.

Archie appears in a crowd scene on the cover/back cover of DC &quot;All New Collectors&#x27; Edition #56&quot; &quot;Superman vs. Muhammad Ali&quot; (1978) drawn by Neal Adams and edited by fellow Oklahoman E. Nelson Bridwell. Archie is No. 15 on the key and is sitting in front of the Jackson 5 on the back cover.

He is name-checked in issues of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; comics including in the alien-language words &quot;Niwdoog Eihcra&quot;, his name in reverse.

A character based on him appears in issue No. 82 of &quot;Cerebus&quot; (January 1986). He stands at the foot of the giant, living stone statue Tarim and repeats everything Tarim says – as if he is passing Tarim&#x27;s commands to the masses. At the end, the annoyed Tarim threatens to kill &quot;anyone pretending to speak for Tarim&quot; when Archie&#x27;s character looks up and stops repeating Tarim by telling the masses to get to work. The scene has often been interpreted as an allegory for Goodwin&#x27;s relationship with Jim Shooter, but &quot;Cerebus&quot; writer/artist Dave Sim denies this and said &quot;I have nothing but the greatest respect for Archie and in no way intended anything but a little &#x27;hello&#x27; to one of my favorite New Yorkers.&quot;

In Marvel Comics&#x27;, &quot;What The--?!&quot; No. 5, (July 1989) Goodwin appears as King Archibald the First in the short story &quot;The Alien-Ated Legion,&quot; which parodies the mature approach of Epic Comics. In the last panels, King Archibald says that he had never been interested in superhero comics.

The airport in fictional Gotham City, home of the Batman, is named the Archie Goodwin International Airport. The airport made its first appearance in Batman No. 34 (April 1946) and remained unnamed until it was given a name on a Gotham City map made for the crossover event in 1999.

In the first DC Comics spinoff of called &quot;The Batman Adventures.&quot; Goodwin appears as Mr. Nice, a super-strong, but childishly-innocent super-villain. He is one of a screwball trio of incompetent super-villains that includes The Mastermind (a caricature of Mike Carlin) and The Professor (a caricature of Dennis O&#x27;Neil). Their first appearance comes in No. 10 (July 1993) with the Riddler. The trio&#x27;s first cover appearance came in No. 20 (May 1994) and their last story came in No. 30 (March 1995).

&quot;&quot; No. 13 (June 1999) features the last appearance of the characters with Mr. Nice leaving the group to fulfill a prophecy, with the issue being dedicated to Archie Goodwin.

<text>Enrique Alfredo Olaya Herrera (12 November 1880 – 18 February 1937) was a Colombian journalist and politician. He served as President of Colombia from 7 August 1930 until 7 August 1934 representing the Colombian Liberal Party.

== Early years ==

Olaya Herrera grew up in a time of intellectual nonconformity and erudition, in a generation that had to live in through the Thousand Days War. He studied in the local public school of his hometown Guateque, in the Department of Boyacá as had his parents. He was son of Justiniano Olaya and Emperatriz Herrera, and had two brothers: Leonidas and Joaquín. When he was 12 years old, Olaya Herrera became known as the &quot;child journalist of Guateque&quot; after his founding of a newspaper called &quot;El Patriota&quot; (The Patriot) for which he managed to obtain many exchanges with major newspapers like &quot;El Espectador&quot; based in Medellín. Olaya Herrera studied law at the Universidad Republicana (later to become the Free University of Colombia), and founded a weekly magazine called &quot;El Estudiante&quot; (The Student) in a newspaper format, which was written by hand.

== Political career ==

Olaya Herrera is considered a member of the &quot;Centennial Generation,&quot; corresponding to the cohort of political and intellectual leaders prominent at the time of the first century after the war of independence, roughly corresponding to the years from 1925 to 1940. Other members of this group were Alfonso López Pumarejo, Laureano Gómez, Eduardo Santos, Mariano Ospina Pérez, Roberto Urdaneta Arbeláez, Luis López de Mesa, Luis Eduardo Nieto Caballero and others.

As a journalist for the newspaper &quot;El Autonomista&quot; (The Autonomist) which was owned by Rafael Uribe Uribe and Ricardo Tirado Macias, Olaya Herrera made a name by criticizing the &quot;Regeneration,&quot; which was the name of the numerous policies that marked the return of the country to a unitary state government system, as well as the rise of conservative, authoritarian, and clerical power following the Colombian Constitution of 1886. Back in his hometown of Guateque, Olaya Herrera maintained a newspaper called &quot;El Soldado Cubano&quot; (The Cuban Soldier) in which he showed his admiration for José Martí.

The political convulsion between the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party had escalated and provoked the thousand days civil war. Most of the centennial generation was pushed into the war following their political beliefs. Olaya Herrera was also pushed into active participation in politics in the Liberal Party. Olaya Herrera was radicalized and joined the armed liberal militias led by General Cenón Figueredo. Olaya Herrera participated in a confrontation in the village of Nocaima, Cundinamarca.

After the war Olaya Herrera continued studying law and finally graduated with a thesis entitled &quot;La Liberacion Condicional&quot; (The Conditional Liberation), which was then published by the university. In 1904 he obtained a doctorate in jurisprudence and in 1906 he traveled to Belgium where he studied diplomacy and sociology at the Université Libre de Bruxelles focusing on diplomacy, politics and journalism.

==Politics and constitutional reform==

Upon his return from Belgium, Olaya Herrera joined the cause against the government of General Rafael Reyes criticizing the treaties between the United States and Colombia, and the loss of Panama. On 13 March 1909 Olaya Herrera publicly made a speech during a Liberal Party event against Reyes&#x27; dictatorship, in the presence of the most important members of the Liberal Party. This made him officially a part of the political movement against the dictatorship that was initiated by Nicolás Esguerra, José Vicente Concha and Miguel Abadía Méndez, a movement that was called &quot;Trecemarcismo,&quot; from &quot;&quot;13 de Marzo&quot; (March the 13th), after his speech. Once President Reyes had to resign as a result of their action, on 16 March 1909, Olaya Herrera put himself forward for the Constituent Assembly and was later elected. He helped reform the Colombian Constitution of 1886 representing the then-existing Quesada Department. Among his party members participating were Rafael Uribe Uribe, Benjamín Herrera, Gabriel Vargas Santos, Nicolás Esguerra, Tomás O. Eastman, Carmelo Arango and Tomás Quevedo Álvarez. The conservative deputies were Carlos E. Restrepo, José Vicente Concha, Pedro Nel Ospina, Guillermo Valencia, Emilio Forero, Hernando Holguín, Abel Carbonell, Pedro M. Carreño and Guillermo Quintero Calderón. Both sides concluded the constitutional reform and initiated a period of reconciliation, political tolerance and a sense of nationalism. Carlos Eugenio Restrepo assumed the presidency of Colombia from 1910 until 1914 sponsored by the Republican Party which Olaya Herrera supported.

President Restrepo appointed Olaya Herrera as the first Minister of Foreign Relations on 7 August 1910 until his resignation on 23 November 1911. During the administration of President Jorge Holguín, Olaya Herrera was appointed to the same office from 1921 until 4 January 1922, and also served as Minister of Agriculture. During the 1920s Olaya Herrera served also as a diplomat (mainly improving Colombian relations with the United States) and with the Colombian congress.

== Presidential candidate ==

During the 1930s the Liberal leadership considered Olaya Herrera as the most suitable leader to recover the presidency from the Regeneration Movement hegemony. He was appointed by the Liberal party in Bogotá as presidential candidate after a group of liberal and conservative friends registered him in the candidates list on 22 January 1930 in the town of Puerto Berrío. Olaya Herrera named his political movement &quot;Concentracion Nacional&quot;&quot; (National Concentration).

Olaya Herra was elected on 9 February 1930 with 369,962 votes against the other candidates Guillermo Valencia with 213,417 votes and Alfredo Vázquez Cobo with 213,417 votes. Former conservative president Carlos Eugenio Restrepo gave his support to Olaya Herrera along with other moderate conservatives.

==Presidency==

Olaya Herrera&#x27;s government was characterized at first by compromise, allocating half of his government&#x27;s public offices (mainly ministries and government departments) to the opposition party led by Laureano Gómez, although these party members were gradually pushed out of office.

His term was characterized by a profound interest in social problems and reforms: workers&#x27; legislation, public assistance, protection for workers and farmers, and others. This agenda was interrupted by the urgent attention required by the Wall Street crash of 1929, and its repercussions all over the world. Olaya Herrera started a cycle of national protectionism, which fostered the development of industry with national capital as the basis for developmental stimuli, emphasizing internal demand. Imports decreased significantly, as did the prices of coffee in the international market. This protectionist trend promoted a nationalist consciousness that turned the country further away from the free-trade policies of the nineteenth century.

=== Economic crisis and War with Peru ===
After the Wall Street crash of 1929 Olaya Herrera was given special powers and dictated some economic reforms that developed at some level the industry and attempted to manage the debt generated by the war with Peru which originated in 1932 when the Amazonian port of Leticia was taken over by invading Peruvian soldiers. Previously, during the presidency of Jorge Holguin, the Salomón–Lozano Treaty which defined the Peru-Colombia border was signed in secrecy. Once the treaty became known to the public in Peru, it became unpopular and a group of Peruvian citizens took the town of Leticia, which was colonized by both Peruvians and Colombians, and which the treaty had awarded to Colombia. General Alfredo Vázquez Cobo was entrusted by Olaya Herrera to lead the armed operations in southern Colombia. The war was financed by the government and the solidarity of the citizens, who donated jewelry and money to support the cause. After many battles the war ended with the signing of the Rio Protocol in 1934, which upheld the Salomón–Lozano Treaty and officially ended the border conflicts between Colombia and Peru.

=== Public works ===

During his government Olaya Herrera tried to develop the Colombian national industry and for this he supported many infrastructure projects mainly highways, maritime and fluvial ports (Barranquilla and Buenaventura) and railroads. He also supported public education and the exploration and exploitation of energy natural resources such as oil, mainly in the northern region of Catatumbo.

Olaya Herrera also tried to improve the association between guilds, for which he created a Bank of Agrarian Credit (), the Mortgage Central Bank () to finance low income housing and for the improvement of production and exporting of coffee products; the government of Olaya Herrera also created the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia. He also helped introduce labor law reforms.

=== Public order issues ===

During his first two years as president there were two main foci of violence in the country; in Boyaca and Santander initially motivated by political reasons. The towns with most problems were Chiquinquirá, the towns of western Boyaca, the Garcia Rovira Province in Santander Department and some towns in the areas of Norte de Santander Department, where conservative public employees resisted being in charge of liberals until the end of his government on 7 August 1934.

== Post-government and death ==

After finishing his term as president in 1935 Olaya Herrera was appointed Minister of Foreign Relations during the government of Alfonso López Pumarejo and later appointed ambassador of Colombia to the State of the Vatican City in Rome, Italy, where he died on 18 February 1937 serving. He had been planning to run for reelection as president upon his return to Colombia.

== Personal life ==

Olaya Herrera married María Teresa Londoño Sáenz in 1911 and had two daughters; Maria and Lucia.

<doc id="905173" wikidata="Q1066670" url="?curid=905173" title="Tag team">
<text>Tag team wrestling is a type of professional wrestling in which matches are contested between teams of multiple wrestlers. Tag teams may be made up of wrestlers who normally wrestle in singles competition, but more commonly are made of established teams who wrestle regularly as a unit and have a team name and identity.

In most team matches, only one competitor per team is allowed in the ring at a time. This status as the active or legal wrestler may be transferred by physical contact, most commonly a palm-to-palm tag which resembles a high five.

The team-based match has been a mainstay of professional wrestling since the mid-twentieth century, and most promotions have sanctioned a championship division for tag teams.

==History==
The first &quot;World&quot; tag team championship was promoted in San Francisco in the early 1950s. Tag matches with three-man teams were developed, and in some territories, a championship division was instituted for these teams, but the concept failed to become widely popular; outside Mexico, multi-man tag matches are seen as a special attraction.

Typically, a tag team championship is awarded to and defended by a team of two. However, during the 1970s and 1980s, a dominant trio in the NWA known as The Fabulous Freebirds won several regional tag team championships and were allowed to employ any combination of the group&#x27;s members in their title defenses. In kayfabe, this made it difficult for challengers to prepare for their upcoming title fights since the challengers did not know exactly whom they were facing. This was an effective gimmick and is still utilized by other wrestling companies. The stipulation has become traditionally known as the &quot;Freebird Rule&quot;.

A common storyline is former tag team partners turning on each other with one member usually turning heel or babyface in the process, which will invariably ignite a feud. This can be used when one member is being called on to develop a new gimmick.

==Tag team match rules==
The basic tag team match has two teams of two wrestlers facing off against each other. All standard rules for singles wrestling apply to a team match. However, only one wrestler from each team, called the &quot;legal man&quot; is allowed in the ring at a time (although heels will often flout this rule in an attempt to gang up on a single opponent). All other members of the team wait outside the ropes (on the ring apron or the floor) in the team&#x27;s specified corner. Only an active/legal wrestler is allowed to score a fall or have a fall scored against him/her. But any wrestler, legal or outside, may face disqualification for himself or his team for violating rules.

Once a tag is made, the wrestler tagging out has a grace period (typically five to ten seconds) to leave the ring before risking disqualification. Offensive cooperation from a team member is allowed during this time window; thus it is rather commonplace for both members of a team, especially heel teams, to milk this grace period and have two men in the ring simultaneously with only one member of an opposing team

The following are standard requisites for making a legal tag:
* Both feet of the wrestler on the outside must be flat on the apron.
* The wrestler outside the ring must be touching the tag rope tied in the corner (or the turnbuckle pad in-rings which have no tag rope) with hand outstretched OVER top rope, not through it.
* Tags are legal as long as the two team members touch.
* The referee has to see and/or hear the contact between the two wrestlers in order for the tag to be legal.

As the ultimate authority over the match, a referee may overlook any of these at his discretion, and during the frenzied action, often will be more lenient with them.

In some multi-man tag matches in lucha libre, a wrestler can make himself the team&#x27;s legal man simply by setting foot in the ring, and his partner then leaves. This allows for action to become nearly continuous. Two referees, one stationed inside the ring and one on the floor, are employed to maintain order for this type of match.

==Types of tags==
In independent discussion and analysis of matches, certain terms are used to describe specific scenarios involving tag team matches. These are planned and timed to inject drama into a match.

One spot common to many tag team match is the &quot;hot tag&quot;. One member of one team is in the ring, too weakened to move or otherwise impaired, while his partner watches helplessly, struggling to reach him for a tag. The tension builds as the legal man is unable to tag out until something happens (a second wind, miscommunication between the opponents or another stroke of luck) that allows the first team to tag and reverse the momentum of the match in their favor. When done well, this results in a large audience reaction, and was the typical climax of tag matches for decades. WWE employs this tactic in nearly every tag team match to the point that they fired a referee in 2008 after a botched finish that, while the match produced the intended finish, did not feature a &quot;hot tag&quot;.

A common variation on the hot tag sees both wrestlers from the heel team attacking a face, while his partner protests to the referee about this bending of the rules (and therefore, unintentionally &quot;distracting&quot; the referee away from the heels). Eventually the weakened face wrestler does make the tag to his partner, who comes in as the fresh man and is able to take on both opponents quite easily.

A &quot;blind tag&quot; is a legal tag made without the legal opponent&#x27;s knowledge, usually while his back is turned. This allows the team who uses it an opportunity to confuse the legal opponent, who turns to face what he assumes to be his opponent only to be attacked by the true legal man, often from behind.

==Other terminology==

A tag team match involving more than two wrestlers per team is often referred to by the total number of people involved (e.g. a six-man tag team match involves two teams of three), while a tag team match involving more than two teams is referred to by normal qualifiers (e.g. a triple threat tag team match involves three teams of two).

In lucha libre, the basic tag team match is referred to as &quot;Lucha de Parejas&quot; (Doubles Fight), a six-man match as a &quot;Lucha de Trios&quot;, and an eight-man match as a &quot;Lucha Atómica&quot; (Atomic Fight).

A &quot;bookend&quot; tag team is a (sometimes derogatory) term for a tag team where the members look and/or dress alike (e.g., The Killer Bees, the British Bulldogs, Los Conquistadores, the Hart Foundation, etc.). Bookends are common in North America, Europe and Mexico, but not in Japan as the promotion of wrestlers to singles championships in that country is based in part on their work in tag team matches.

<text>Anastasia Love Sagorsky (born June 6, 1975), best known by her stage name Staci Keanan, is an American lawyer, law professor and former actress. She is best known for her television roles as Nicole Bradford on the NBC sitcom &quot;My Two Dads&quot; (1987–1990) and Dana Foster on the ABC/CBS sitcom &quot;Step by Step&quot; (1991–1998). 

She has not performed as an actress since 2010, making a transition to working as a prosecutor and law school professor.

== Biography ==

=== 1975–1987: Early life and work ===
Keanan was born in Devon, Pennsylvania, the daughter of Jacqueline (née Love) (1934–2009) and Irving Sagorsky, a car salesman (died 2007). She has a sister, Pilar Sagorsky Stein. 

At age five, she began modeling and appeared in print, radio, and television advertisements, including television commercials for My Little Pony, Burger King and Hershey&#x27;s Kisses. As a youth, Keanan moved with her mother and sister to New York City, where she changed her name to &quot;Staci Love&quot; and began appearing in summer stock. She made her credited television debut in the 1987 miniseries &quot;&quot;I&#x27;ll Take Manhattan&quot;&quot;.

=== 1987–2010: Acting career ===
At the age of 12, shortly after she moved with her family to Los Angeles, she was cast as Nicole Bradford in the TV series &quot;My Two Dads&quot; (1987–1990). After the end of &quot;My Two Dads&quot;, Keanan starred on the short-lived ABC sitcom &quot;Going Places&quot; (1990–1991) with Alan Ruck, Heather Locklear, and Hallie Todd. The following year, she was cast as Dana Foster in the TV series &quot;Step by Step&quot; (1991–1998). By 1997, Keanan had changed her name from &quot;Staci&quot; to &quot;Stacy.&quot;

Keanan had roles in the short &quot;Stolen Poem&quot; (2004) and the films &quot;Hidden Secrets&quot; (2006), and &quot;Death and Cremation&quot; (2010) with Brad Dourif, Jeremy Sumpter, and Daniel Baldwin. In 2009, Keanan appeared in &quot;Holyman Undercover&quot;, and in 2010, she appeared in a cameo in &quot;You Again&quot; with &quot;Step by Step&quot; castmates Christine Lakin and Patrick Duffy. She also co-starred in the 2009 film &quot;Sarah&#x27;s Choice&quot;.

=== 2010–present: Transition into law ===
Keanan attended Southwestern Law School and was admitted to the State Bar of California in 2013. She currently practices law under her birth name, Anastasia Sagorsky, in the Los Angeles area. In 2014, Keanan worked as a Deputy District Attorney in the Riverside County District Attorney&#x27;s office prosecuting felony cases involving violent crime or death. Keanan joined the Los Angeles County District Attorney&#x27;s office as a Deputy District Attorney in 2016. In January 2021, she became an adjunct associate professor of law at Southwestern Law School. In 2022, she taught a course on how to properly prosecute and defend driving under the influence cases.

==Personal life==
In 2002, Keanan graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Art History and a minor in French from UCLA. Her academic honors include membership in the Golden Key International Honour Society and Phi Beta Kappa honor societies. 

On February 11, 2017, Keanan married actor and producer Guy Birtwhistle.

<doc id="905176" wikidata="Q418957" url="?curid=905176" title="Pyridoxal phosphate">
<text>Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP, pyridoxal 5&#x27;-phosphate, P5P), the active form of vitamin B6, is a coenzyme in a variety of enzymatic reactions. The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology has catalogued more than 140 PLP-dependent activities, corresponding to ~4% of all classified activities. The versatility of PLP arises from its ability to covalently bind the substrate, and then to act as an electrophilic catalyst, thereby stabilizing different types of carbanionic reaction intermediates.

==Role as a coenzyme==
PLP acts as a coenzyme in all transamination reactions, and in certain decarboxylation, deamination, and racemization reactions of amino acids. The aldehyde group of PLP forms a Schiff-base linkage (internal aldimine) with the ε-amino group of a specific lysine group of the aminotransferase enzyme. The α-amino group of the amino acid substrate displaces the ε-amino group of the active-site lysine residue in a process known as transaldimination. The resulting external aldimine can lose a proton, carbon dioxide, or an amino acid sidechain to become a quinonoid intermediate, which in turn can act as a nucleophile in several reaction pathways.

In transamination, after deprotonation the quinonoid intermediate accepts a proton at a different position to become a ketimine. The resulting ketimine is hydrolysed so that the amino group remains on the complex. In addition, PLP is used by aminotransferases (or transaminases) that act upon unusual sugars such as perosamine and desosamine. In these reactions, the PLP reacts with glutamate, which transfers its alpha-amino group to PLP to make pyridoxamine phosphate (PMP). PMP then transfers its nitrogen to the sugar, making an amino sugar.

PLP is also involved in various beta-elimination reactions such as the reactions carried out by serine dehydratase and GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose-3-dehydratase (ColD).

It is also active in the condensation reaction in heme synthesis.

PLP plays a role in the conversion of levodopa into dopamine, facilitates the conversion of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate to the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, and allows SAM to be decarboxylated to form propylamine, which is a precursor to polyamines.

== Role in human body==
Pyridoxal phosphate has numerous roles in human body. A few examples below:
* Metabolism and biosynthesis of serotonin. Pyridoxal phosphate is a cofactor of aromatic L-amino acids decarboxylase. This allows for conversion of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) into serotonin (5-HT). This reaction takes place in serotonergic neurons.
* Metabolism and biosynthesis of histamine. Pyridoxal phosphate is a cofactor of L-histidine decarboxylase. This allows for conversion of histidine into histamine. This reaction takes place in Golgi apparatus in mast cells and in basophils. Next, histamine is stored in granularity in mast cells as a complex with acid residues of heparin proteoglycan while in basophils as a complex with chondroitine sulfate.
* Metabolism and biosynthesis of GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid). Pyridoxal phosphate is a cofactor of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). This allows for conversion of glutamate into GABA. Reaction takes place in cytoplasm of termination of GABA-ergic neurons, therefore vitamin B6 deficiency may cause epileptic seizures in children. Pyridoxal phosphate also participates in the oxidative deamination of GABA, where it is a cofactor of GABA aminotransferase. 
* Metabolism of ornithine. Pyridoxal phosphate is a cofactor of ornithine carboxylase.
* Transamination. Pyridoxal phosphate takes part in decomposition and synthesis of amino acids, fats, and carbohydrates, and in the biosynthesis of hormones, neurotransmitters, and heme.

==Non-classical examples of PLP==
PLP is also found on glycogen phosphorylase in the liver, where it is used to break down glycogen in glycogenolysis when glucagon or epinephrine signals it to do so. However, this enzyme does not exploit the reactive aldehyde group, but instead utilizes the phosphate group on PLP to perform its reaction.

Although the vast majority of PLP-dependent enzymes form an internal aldimine with PLP via an active site lysine residue, some PLP-dependent enzymes do not have this lysine residue, but instead have a histidine in the active site. In such a case, the histidine cannot form the internal aldimine, and, therefore, the co-factor does not become covalently tethered to the enzyme. GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose-3-dehydratase (ColD) is an example of such an enzyme.
Human Serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 regulates one-carbon transfer reactions required for amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, and exists in dimeric and tetrameric forms. The dimeric SHMT2 variant is a potent inhibitor of the BRISC deubiquitylase enzyme complex, which regulates immune-based cell signaling. Recent studies show that SJMT2 tetramerization is induced by PLP. This prevents interaction with the BRISC deubiqutylase complex, potentially linking vitamin B6 levels and metabolism to inflammation.

==Catalytic mechanism==

The pyridoxal-5′-phosphate-dependent enzymes (PLP enzymes) catalyze myriad reactions. Although the scope of PLP-catalyzed reactions appears to be immense, the unifying principle is the formation of an internal lysine-derived aldimine. Once the amino substrate interacts with the active site, a new Schiff base is generated, commonly referred to as the external aldimine. After this step, the pathway for each PLP-catalyzed reactions diverge.
==Specificity==
Specificity is conferred by the fact that, of the four bonds of the alpha-carbon of the amino acid aldimine state, the bond perpendicular to the pyridine ring will be broken (Dunathan Stereoelectronic Hypothesis). Consequently, specificity is dictated by how the enzymes bind their substrates.
An additional role in specificity is played by the ease of protonation of the pyridine ring nitrogen.

==PLP-enzymes==
PLP is retained in the active site not only thanks to the lysine, but also thanks to the interaction of the phosphate group and a phosphate binding pocket and to a lesser extent thanks to base stacking of the pyridine ring with an overhanging aromatic residue, generally tyrosine (which may also partake in the acid–base catalysis). Despite the limited requirements for a PLP binding pocket, PLP enzymes belong to only five different families. These families do not correlate well with a particular type of reaction. The five families are classified as fold types followed by a Roman numeral.
* Fold Type I — aspartate aminotransferase family
* Fold Type II — tryptophan synthase family
* Fold Type III — alanine racemase family (TIM-barrel)
* Fold Type IV — D-amino acid aminotransferase family
* Fold Type V — glycogen phosphorylase family

==Biosynthesis==

===From vitamers===
Animals are auxotroph for this enzyme co-factor and require it or an intermediate to be supplemented, hence its classification as a vitamin B6, unlike MoCo or CoQ10 for example. PLP is synthesized from pyridoxal by the enzyme pyridoxal kinase, requiring one ATP molecule. PLP is metabolized in the liver.

===Prototrophy===
Two natural pathways for PLP are currently known: one requires deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate (DXP), while the other does not, hence they are known as DXP-dependent and DXP-independent. These pathways have been studied extensively in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; and &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot;, respectively. Despite the disparity in the starting compounds and the different number of steps required, the two pathways possess many commonalities.

====DXP-dependent biosynthesis====

The DXP-dependent biosynthetic route requires several steps and a convergence of two branches, one producing 3-hydroxy-1-aminoacetone phosphate from erythrose 4-phosphate, while the other (single enzyme) producing deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) and pyruvate. The condensation product of 3-hydroxy-1-aminoacetone phosphate and deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate is pyridoxine 5&#x27;-phosphate. The condensation is catalyzed by PNP synthase, encoded by &quot;pdxJ&quot;, which creates PNP (pyridoxine 5&#x27; phosphate). The final enzyme is PNP oxidase (&quot;pdxH&quot;), which catalyzes the oxidation of the 4&#x27; hydroxyl group to an aldehyde using dioxigen, resulting in hydrogen peroxide.

The first branch is catalyzed in &quot;E. coli&quot; by enzymes encoded by &quot;epd&quot;, &quot;pdxB&quot;, &quot;serC&quot; and &quot;pdxA&quot;. These share mechanistical similarities and homology with the three enzymes in serine biosynthesis (&quot;serA&quot; (homologue of &quot;pdxB&quot;), &quot;serC&quot;, &quot;serB&quot; — however, &quot;epd&quot; is a homologue of &quot;gap&quot;), which points towards a shared evolutionary origin of the two pathways. In several species there are two homologues of the &quot;E. coli&quot; &quot;serC&quot; gene, generally one in a ser operon (&quot;serC&quot;), and the other in a pdx operon, in which case it is called &quot;pdxF&quot;.

A &quot;serendipitous pathway&quot; was found in an overexpression library that could suppress the auxotrophy caused by the deletion of pdxB (encoding erythronate 4 phosphate dehydrogenase) in &quot;E. coli&quot;. The serendipitous pathway was very inefficient, but was possible due to the promiscuous activity of various enzymes. It started with 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate (the product of the &quot;serA&quot;-encoded enzyme in serine biosynthesis) and did not require erythronate-4-phosphate. 3PHP was dephosphorylated, resulting in an unstable intermediate that decarboxylates spontaneously (hence the presence of the phosphate in the serine biosynthetic pathway) to glycaldehyde. Glycaldehyde was condensed with glycine and the phosphorylated product was 4-phosphohydroxythreonine (4PHT), the canonical substrate for 4-PHT dehydrogenase (&quot;pdxA&quot;).

====DXP-independent biosynthesis====
The DXP-independent PLP-biosynthetic route consists of a step catalyzed by PLP-synthase, an enzyme composed of two subunits. PdxS catalyzes the condensation of ribulose 5-phosphate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, and ammonia, this latter molecules is produced by PdxT which catalyzes the production of ammonia from glutamine. PdxS is a (β/α)8 barrel (also known as a TIM-barrel) that forms a dodecamer.

===Abiotic synthesis===
The widespread utilization of PLP in central metabolism, especially in amino acid biosynthesis, and its activity in the absence of enzymes, suggests PLP may be a &quot;prebiotic&quot; compound—that is, one that predates the origin of organic life (not to be confused with prebiotic compounds, substances which serve as a food source for beneficial bacteria).
In fact, heating NH3 and Glycolaldehyde spontaneously forms a variety of pyridines, including pyridoxal. Under certain conditions, PLP is formed from cyanoacetylene, diacetylene, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, water, and a phosphoric acid.

==Inhibitors==
Several inhibitors of PLP enzymes are known.

One type of inhibitor forms an electrophile with PLP, causing it to irreversibly react with the active site lysine. Acetylenic compounds (e.g. propargylglycine) and vinylic compounds (e.g. vinylglycine) are such inhibitors.
A different type of inhibitor inactivates PLP, and such are α-methyl and amino-oxy substrate analogs (e.g. α-methylglutamate). Still other inhibitors have good leaving groups that nucleophilically attack the PLP. Such is chloroalanine, which inhibits a large number of enzymes.

Examples of inhibitors:
* Levothyroxine In rats given only 10 μg of D, L-thyroxine daily for 15 days, liver cysteine desulfhydrase activity disappears and serine and threonine dehydrase and alanine glutamate transaminase activities decrease about 40%. Either in vivo feeding of pyridoxal-5-phosphate or in vitro addition of the coenzyme to the liver preparations restores full activity to all these enzymes, and the slight in vitro inhibition in the presence of 10−5 M thyroxine is also reversed by pyridoxal-5-phosphate.
* The inactive form pyridoxine competitively inhibits the active pyridoxal-5&#x27;-phosphate. Consequently, symptoms of vitamin B6 supplementation in the pyridoxine form can mimic those of vitamin B6 deficiency; an effect which perhaps might be avoided by supplementing with P5P instead.
* AlaP (alanine phosphonate) inhibits alanine racemases, but its lack of specificity has prompted further designs of ALR inhibitors.
* Gabaculine and Vigabatrin inhibit GABA aminotransferase
* Canaline and 5-fluoromethylornithine inhibit ornithine aminotransferase
* Amino-oxy SAM inhibits ACC synthase

==Evolution==
Pyridoxal-5-phosphate (vitamin B6)-dependent enzymes have multiple evolutionary origins. The overall B6 enzymes diverged into four independent evolutionary lines: α family (i.e. aspartate aminotransferase), β family (serine dehydratase),D-alanine aminotransferase family and the alanine racemase family. An example of the evolutionary similarity in the Beta family is seen in the mechanism. The β enzymes are all lyases and catalyze reactions where Cα and Cβ participate. Overall, in the PLP-dependent enzymes, the PLP in every case is covalently attached via an imine bond to the amino group in the active site.

<text>Julio Medem Lafont (born 21 October 1958) is a Basque film director, producer, editor, and screenwriter.

==Biography==
Medem was born on 21 October 1958 in San Sebastián, Basque Country, Spain and showed an interest in movies since childhood, when he would take his father&#x27;s Super 8 camera and shoot at night, while nobody was paying attention. After college graduation, with degrees in Medicine and General Surgery, he worked as a film critic and later as a screenwriter, assistant director and editor. After a few shorts, he directed his first full-length feature, &quot;Vacas&quot; (Cows) for which he won a Goya Award.

After this film he directed &quot;The Red Squirrel&quot; and &quot;Earth&quot;, both receiving good reviews at Cannes. His next film, &quot;Lovers of the Arctic Circle&quot;, has been compared to the works of Krzysztof Kieślowski. In 2002 was released his following film, &quot;Sex and Lucia&quot;.

Medem explored the documentary format with his next production &quot;La pelota vasca&quot; (&#x27;The Basque Ball&#x27;), a film about the political problems of the Basque Country, which caused a furor amongst some victims of terrorism and far right politicians. Following this, his film &quot;Caótica Ana&quot; debuted in 2007.

<text>Fritz is a German chess program originally developed for Chessbase by Frans Morsch based on his Quest program, ported to DOS, and then Windows by Mathias Feist. With version 13, Morsch retired, and his engine was first replaced by Gyula Horvath&#x27;s Pandix, and then with Fritz 15, Vasik Rajlich&#x27;s Rybka. Fritz 17 switched to the Ginkgo engine, written by Frank Schneider.

The latest version of the consumer product is Fritz 19. This version supports 64-bit hardware and multiprocessing by default.

==History==
In 1991, the German company ChessBase approached the Dutch chess programmer Frans Morsch about writing a chess engine to add to the database program which they sold. Morsch adapted his &quot;Quest&quot; program, and ChessBase released it for sale that year as &quot;Knightstalker&quot; in the U.S. and Fritz throughout the rest of the world. In 1995, &quot;Fritz 3&quot; won the World Computer Chess Championship in Hong Kong, beating an early version of &quot;Deep Blue&quot;. This was the first time that a program running on a consumer-level microcomputer defeated the mainframes that had previously dominated this event.

In 1998, Fritz 5 was released including a Friend mode which would cause the engine to adjust its strength of play over the course of a game based on the level the opponent appeared to be playing. Fritz 5.32 was released soon after replacing the 16-bit architecture with a 32-bit one.

In 2002, &quot;Deep Fritz&quot; drew the Brains in Bahrain match against Vladimir Kramnik 4–4. Fritz 7, which was released that year, included the ability to play on the Playchess server.

In November 2003, &quot;X3D Fritz&quot;, a version of Deep Fritz with a 3D interface, drew a four-game match against Garry Kasparov.

Fritz 8, which appeared around this time, provided a 3D Spanish room setting for games to take place. Fritz 9 added a 3D virtual opponent, the Turk.

In 2004, Fritz 8 added a Handicap and Fun mode, allowing players to choose the Elo rating and style that the engine will use. Chessbase native engines can use the Handicap feature: Chess Tiger, Crafty, the Fritz engine, Hiarcs, Houdini, Junior, Rybka, Shredder and Zappa. Some UCI engines can also make use of Handicap, e.g. Fruit and Stockfish.

On June 23, 2005, in the ABC Times Square studios, the &quot;AI Accoona Toolbar&quot;, driven by a Fritz 9 prototype, drew against the then FIDE World Champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov.

From November 25 to December 5, 2006 &quot;Deep Fritz&quot; played a six-game match against Kramnik in Bonn. Fritz was able to win 4–2. In this match, Kramnik blundered away game 2, allowing a mate in one.

On SSDF&#x27;s September 2010 rating list, &quot;Deep Fritz 12&quot; placed sixth with a rating of 3110, 135 points higher than Deep Junior 10.1, and 103 points lower than no. 1 ranked Deep Rybka 3 x64. &quot;Deep Fritz 11&quot; is eighth on the same list, with a rating of 3073.

On the December 2010 edition of the CCRL rating list, &quot;Deep Fritz 12&quot; placed sixth with an Elo rating of 3088, 29 points higher than Deep Junior 11.1a x64, and 174 points lower than no. 1 ranked Deep Rybka 4 x64. &quot;Deep Fritz 11&quot; is also sixth on the same list, with a rating of 3097. Fritz has not kept up with modern advances, attaining only 14th on the 2013 CCRL rating list and not participating in any world championships since 2004.

The 2013 release of Deep Fritz 14 switched engines from the original author Frans Morsch&#x27;s to Pandix, written by Gyula Horváth. A long-time participant in world computer championships since 1984, Pandix was substantially rewritten in 2009, and has been a strong contender since then.

Fritz 15 was released on November 25, 2015, with new features, including switching to Vasik Rajlich&#x27;s famous Rybka engine. Handicap and Fun mode was dropped, but there is now a function for pawn and piece handicaps (e.g. ceding pawn and move).

Fritz 16 was released on November 12, 2017, with a new Easy game mode which provides for assisted calculation marking good moves with a green circle and bad moves with a red one. This version again uses the Rybka engine.

Fritz 17 was released on November 12, 2019, and uses the Ginkgo engine, written by Frank Schneider. Fritz 18 was released on November 16, 2021.

On March 30, 2022, Fritz 18 Neuronal was released that supplemented Fritz&#x27;s handcrafted evaluation with an efficiently updatable neural network.

On 14 November 2023, Fritz 19 was released. It features 6 different computer opponents and a new opening training repertoire. 

In July 2021, the developers of the open source Stockfish chess engine filed a lawsuit against Chessbase alleging that Fat Fritz 2.0 is a derivative of Stockfish and is in violation of a &quot;central obligation&quot; of Stockfish&#x27;s GNU General Public License. In November 2022, a settlement was reached in which it was agreed that the license obligations of the GPL-3.0 for the products Fat Fritz 2 and Houdini 6 have not been complied with. In the future, Chessbase will comply with the license terms and to adequately inform the public about the use of the Stockfish software in its products.

==The Fritz engine in other companies==
The American company Viva Media, now a division of Encore, Inc. has been licensed to sell many versions of the Fritz engine and GUI combination. British game publisher Eidos Interactive (now part of Square Enix Europe) published Fritz 6 and 7. In 1998, the German company Data Becker released the program 3D Schach Genie, containing the Shredder engine and Fritz interface. The German company Purple Hills sold Fritz 6 through 12 as Profi Schach 1 through 7. British Excalibur Publishing has published Fritz 9 through 14. American book publisher Simon &amp; Schuster featured the Fritz engine in their Extreme Chess program, as have German game publisher TopWare Interactive in their Battle vs. Chess game.

== Fritz and Chesster ==

Fritz and Chesster is a series of introductory chess programs based on the Fritz engine. Each program provides basic tutorials and games based on one aspect of chess, allowing children to learn the basic rules easily without overwhelming them with too many options at once.

Games follow Prince Fritz, the son of King White, and his cousin Bianca, as Chesster the rat (among others) teaches them the fundamentals of chess so that they can defeat King Black.

There are three programs available in the series:
* &quot;Learn To Play Chess With Fritz and Chesster&quot; covers all the rules of chess, from basic moves to castling and stalemate.
* &quot;Learn To Play Chess With Fritz and Chesster 2: Chess in the Black Castle&quot; covers chess strategy and tactics, chess openings, and endgames.
* &quot;Learn To Play Chess With Fritz and Chesster, part 3: Chess for Winners&quot; contains opening schemes, tactics, recognizing checkmates, endgame training, and key squares.

==Reception==
The editors of &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; nominated &quot;Fritz 6&quot; for their 2000 &quot;Classic Game of the Year&quot; award.

<text>The Hitcher is a 1986 American horror thriller film directed by Robert Harmon and written by Eric Red. It stars Rutger Hauer as the title character, a murderous hitchhiker who stalks a young motorist (C. Thomas Howell) across the highways of West Texas. Jeffrey DeMunn and Jennifer Jason Leigh appear in supporting roles.

Released in the United States on February 21, 1986, the film was originally met with tepid critical and commercial response, grossing $5.8 million on a $7.9 million budget. In later years, it has been reappraised as a cult classic. The film was followed by a 2003 sequel, &quot;The Hitcher II: I&#x27;ve Been Waiting&quot;, which featured Howell reprising his role, and a 2007 remake.

==Plot==
Jim Halsey, a young man delivering a car from Chicago to San Diego, spots a man hitchhiking in the West Texas desert and gives him a ride. The hitchhiker, who calls himself John Ryder, forces Jim&#x27;s leg down on the accelerator when they pass a stranded car. Ryder states he murdered and dismembered the driver and intends to do the same to Jim, threatening him with a switchblade. Terrified, Jim asks what Ryder wants. He replies, &quot;I want you to stop me.&quot; When Jim realizes that Ryder&#x27;s seat belt is unbuckled and the passenger door is ajar, he shoves Ryder out of the moving car.

Relieved, Jim continues his journey. When he sees Ryder in the back of a family car, Jim tries to warn the occupants, but has a minor accident. He comes across the family&#x27;s blood-soaked car and vomits. Ryder corners Jim but simply tosses him the keys from Jim&#x27;s car. Ryder leaves with a trucker and nearly runs Jim down with the truck, which crashes into the pumps of a gas station. As Jim flees, Ryder causes the station to explode.

At a roadside diner, Jim meets Nash, a waitress who cooks him lunch while he calls the police. He finds a severed finger among his French fries, indicating Ryder&#x27;s proximity. The police arrive and arrest Jim, whom Ryder is framing for his murders. Though the police doubt his guilt, they lock him up overnight as protocol. Jim wakes to find the cell door unlocked and the officers murdered. He panics and flees with a revolver. At a gas station, he sees two officers, takes them hostage, and forces one of them to drive. Jim speaks on the radio to Captain Esteridge, the officer in charge of the manhunt. As Esteridge convinces Jim to surrender, Ryder pulls alongside and kills the two officers.

The patrol car crashes, and Ryder disappears again. After briefly considering suicide, Jim reaches a cafe, where Ryder confronts him. He points out Jim&#x27;s revolver is unloaded. Ryder leaves him several bullets and departs. Jim boards a bus, where he meets Nash and explains his situation. After a police car pulls the bus over, Jim surrenders. The furious officers accuse him of killing their colleagues and are about to kill him. Nash appears with Jim&#x27;s revolver, disarms the officers, and flees with Jim in their patrol car. As the police chase after them, Ryder joins the chase and murders the officers by causing a massive car accident and shooting down a police helicopter.

Jim and Nash abandon the patrol car and hike to a motel. While Jim is in the shower, Ryder abducts Nash. Jim searches for her. Captain Esteridge discovers Jim and enlists him to negotiate with Ryder, who is at the wheel of a large Mack truck. Ryder has gagged and tied Nash between the truck and its trailer hitch, and is threatening to tear her apart. Esteridge tells Jim that his men cannot shoot Ryder because his foot would slip off the clutch, causing the truck to roll. Jim enters the cab with Ryder, who gives him a revolver and tells him to shoot, but Jim is unable to do so. Ryder, disappointed, releases the clutch, killing Nash.

Ryder is taken into custody. Esteridge gives Jim a ride, but Jim, believing the police cannot hold Ryder, takes Esteridge&#x27;s revolver and vehicle to chase down Ryder&#x27;s prison bus. Ryder kills the deputies and leaps through Jim&#x27;s windshield as the bus crashes. Jim slams on his brakes, sending Ryder through the windshield and onto the road. Ryder challenges Jim to run him over, which he does. When Jim leaves his car to look at Ryder&#x27;s body, Ryder jumps up, but Jim shoots him repeatedly with a shotgun, killing him. Jim leans against Esteridge&#x27;s car in a daze and smokes a cigarette as the sun sets.

==Production==

===Development===
When writer Eric Red was 20 years old, he made a short film entitled &quot;Gunman&#x27;s Blues&quot; in the hopes of getting the opportunity to direct a feature-length film. When no offers came, he moved from New York City to Austin, Texas, taking a drive-away car cross-country. While driving from one city to another, he got the idea for a film from The Doors song &quot;Riders on the Storm&quot;. He found that the &quot;elements of the song – a killer on the road in a storm plus the cinematic feel of the music – would make a terrific opening for a film&quot;. Red had a lot of time to think about the song and it inspired ideas for the story. During his seven-month stay in Austin, he drove a taxi cab and wrote &quot;The Hitcher&quot;. In 1983, he sent a letter to several Hollywood producers asking if he could send them a copy of the screenplay for &quot;The Hitcher&quot;. His letter concluded: &quot;It (the story) grabs you by the guts and does not let up and it does not let go. When you read it, you will not sleep for a week. When the movie is made, the country will not sleep for a week&quot;. Script development executive David Bombyk received a copy of Red&#x27;s letter and was intrigued by the description of the film. Red sent him a script that was approximately 190 pages in length (one page traditionally equals one minute of screen time).

===Screenplay===
In the original script, an entire family is slaughtered in their station wagon, an eyeball is discovered inside of a hamburger, a woman is tied to a truck and a pole and then torn in half, two teenagers engage in sex, shootings and car crashes. In its original form, Bombyk found the script to be &quot;extremely brutal and extremely gory&quot;, but he and personal manager Kip Ohman (who later became co-producers of the film) also saw in it &quot;a level of challenge, intensity and poetry&quot;. Bombyk and Ohman were worried about getting it into good enough shape to show their boss, producer Ed Feldman, and his partner, Charles Meeker, and prove to them that it was more than an exploitation film. Bombyk worked with Red via several long-distance phone calls to Texas and eventually the writer moved to Los Angeles. Red agreed to work with Ohman on the script until it was ready to be shown to Feldman and Meeker. They liked the script but wondered, &quot;how could we manage to translate it to the screen without making a slasher movie?&quot; Meeker said.

Feldman and Meeker decided to come on board as executive producers. Ohman and Red spent six months reworking the script, removing most of what Ohman felt was repetitive violence. Once they got it in good enough shape, Ohman gave it back to Bombyk and also to David Madden, a production executive for 20th Century Fox. Within a few days, Madden called back and told them the script was &quot;terrific&quot;. The studio was not comfortable with the subject matter but felt that the writing was unique and interesting enough to give the filmmakers a letter-of-intent to distribute the film. This would allow them to get financing and then, once filming was completed, the studio would reimburse them for the budget.

===Casting===
The film&#x27;s producers then went looking for an inexpensive director. Still photographer-turned-cameraman Robert Harmon was given a copy of the script by his agent and called his agent early next morning, telling him that he wanted to do it. In February 1984, Harmon met the producers to talk about the script. He recalled that &quot;even the exact actions that remained in the script were described in much bloodier and gorier detail&quot;. The producers were impressed with him and the fact that he also envisioned the film as a Hitchcockian thriller. However, Harmon objected to the eyeball in the hamburger scene and never planned to show the girl getting ripped in half.

In early drafts of the script, John Ryder had been described as skeletal in nature and so actors like David Bowie, Sting, Sam Shepard, Harry Dean Stanton, and Terence Stamp were mentioned. Harmon was set on casting Stamp and even carried around his picture to pitch meetings. Stamp received a copy of the script but turned down the role. Sam Elliott was offered the role but an agreement could not be reached on his salary. Michael Ironside was also considered for the role. Singer mentioned Dutch actor Rutger Hauer. While in L.A. for a short visit, Hauer read the script. Even though he was looking for non-villainous roles, the script &quot;really got a hold of me ... I thought, &#x27;If I do one more villain, I should do this.&#x27; I couldn&#x27;t refuse it.&quot; The one reservation Hauer had was with the scene where the girl is torn apart and Feldman told him, &quot;you &quot;are&quot; the bad guy and you&#x27;ll be the baddest bad guy there ever was!&quot; Red mentioned to Hauer that he had Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards in mind when he wrote the part of Ryder. Furthermore, Red felt that the character should have an electronic voice box.

For the role of Jim Halsey, the producers mentioned Matthew Modine, Tom Cruise, and Emilio Estevez. They agreed on C. Thomas Howell and liked his look. At the time, Howell was being more selective with the roles he took and heard that the script was a generic thriller. Harmon personally gave Howell a copy of the script. He could not put it down and &quot;couldn&#x27;t believe the things that happened to my character in the first 12 pages. I knew I wanted to do it&quot;. He also wanted to work with Hauer. Unbeknownst to Hauer, Howell found him &quot;frightening, intimidating, and that he was in a constant state of fear, almost as if he really was John Ryder and I really was Jim Halsey&quot;.

Jennifer Jason Leigh agreed to do the film because she wanted to work with Hauer again (they co-starred in &quot;Flesh + Blood&quot;), and loved the character of Nash because &quot;there was a real person there&quot;.

In addition, veteran character actors Billy Green Bush (known for playing ill-fated police officers in &quot;Electra Glide in Blue&quot; and &quot;Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday&quot;), Gene Davis (known for playing the naked psychopathic killer Warren Stacy in &quot;10 to Midnight&quot;), Armin Shimerman (who would later be the voice of General Skarr in &quot;The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy&quot;), and Emmy-winner Henry Darrow, have supporting roles as police officers who pursue Jim Halsey.

===Pre-production===
Fox ultimately rejected the project over the budget and saw it as a &quot;straight-out horror movie&quot;. Madden also admitted that he would have &quot;argued to soften the movie. There were some people at the studio who thought it was pretty gross&quot;. Feldman and Meeker optioned the film themselves, paying Red $25,000. Major studios like Universal Pictures and Warner Bros. passed on it, as did smaller ones like Orion Pictures and New World Pictures. Many executives liked the script but balked at the girl being ripped apart scene. At least two studios were willing to consider making it but only if Harmon was replaced. However, the film&#x27;s producers had faith in their director and stuck by Harmon.

Independent producer Donna Dubrow heard about &quot;The Hitcher&quot; while working on another film and to her it sounded like &quot;&quot;Duel&quot; with a person&quot;. When she went to work for Silver Screen Partners/Home Box Office, she contacted Feldman, a former employer, and asked for a copy of the script. She submitted it to her boss, HBO senior vice-president Maurice Singer. He liked it and sent it back to New York to be read by Michael Fuchs, HBO chairman and chief operating officer. They needed Fuchs&#x27; approval to get the film made. It would not be easy to convince him because it was not the kind of material that he liked and he did not want to make it. However, Dubrow had to go back to New York on other business and met with Fuchs. She mentioned the script for &quot;The Hitcher&quot; and pitched the Hitchcockian thriller angle. When she returned to L.A., Singer told her that Fuchs agreed to make the film but with the stipulation that the girl would not be torn apart and the violence would be reduced. The film&#x27;s budget was set at $5.8 million.

Over the next few months, the filmmakers negotiated two key scenes in the script: the girl getting ripped apart and the eyeball in the hamburger. For the latter scene, Harmon just changed the body part to a finger. As for the former, everyone at HBO/Silver Screen, except Dubrow, wanted it changed. Fuchs did not want the girl to die and Dubrow argued that this would change the story significantly. There were arguments about how the girl should die and Dubrow remembers, &quot;they were trying to make her death not horrible, when – by the nature of the script – it had to be&quot;. The studio even suggested softening her death by having a funeral. The filmmakers refused to back down and Silver Screen executives finally relented at the last minute.

==Release==
===In theaters===
Contractually, TriStar Pictures was obligated to distribute any film by HBO/Silver Screen. After TriStar representatives saw an early screening, studio president David Matalon remarked, &quot;it&#x27;s the best film that we have for 1986&quot;. &quot;The Hitcher&quot; opened in 800 theaters on February 21, 1986, and made $2.1 million during its opening weekend, going on to gross $5.8 million in North America.

===Home media===
&quot;The Hitcher&quot; has been released on VHS, laserdisc and DVD, though the film did not receive a high-definition release until 2019, when a Blu-ray and DVD mediabook set was released by Alive Fernsehjuwelen GmbH. This release presented the film uncut for the first time in Germany, though picture quality was not ideal, as the remaster was sourced from a 35mm German release print, the best film element known to exist at the time. However, British label Second Sight Films, while preparing a release of their own, discovered the original film elements to be held by Warner Bros. Pictures, owners of the HBO Films library, and were ultimately able to complete a 4K restoration of the film supervised by director Harmon. This restored version was released in both 4K and standard Blu-ray formats by Second Sight in the UK on September 30, 2024, and by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment (via Studio Distribution Services) in North America a few weeks later on October 22.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Hitcher&quot; holds a 65% approval rating based on 43 critic reviews, with an average rating of 6.1/10. The consensus reads: &quot;Its journey is never quite as revelatory as it could be, but &quot;The Hitcher&quot; stands as a white-knuckle vision of horror, bolstered by Rutger Hauer&#x27;s menacing performance.” On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 32 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert awarded it zero stars, arguing that the identification of the film&#x27;s hero with the killer is hollow because the killer has no backstory or even a motive. Gene Siskel also gave the film zero stars, calling it &quot;a nauseating thriller&quot; and &quot;a thinly veiled but more gruesome ripoff of Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Duel&quot;&quot;. In her review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin criticized the film&#x27;s lack of intensity and originality, and wrote, &quot;Mr. Harmon, making his feature debut, displays a much surer hand for action than for character, though even some of the action footage here looks meaninglessly overblown&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a highly unimaginative slasher ... with a script that has many holes.&quot; In his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Paul Attanasio wrote, &quot;The script (by Eric Red) is laconic in a dull way, much Cain but hardly able. And Harmon and his cinematographer, John Seale, have shot the movie in such brown murk, you can hardly make anything out. By the end, you&#x27;re willing to forgive Ryder his worst if someone would just change the light bulb&quot;. In his review for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, Jay Scott interpreted the film as a &quot;slasher movie about gay panic, a nasty piece of homophobic angst for the age of AIDS&quot;. A rare positive review came from &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine&#x27;s Jack Kroll who called it, &quot;an odyssey of horror and suspense that&#x27;s as tightly wound as a garrote and as beautifully designed as a guillotine&quot;. Leonard Maltin awarded the film a score of 2 1/2 out of 4 stars (his most frequently used rating), criticizing the film&#x27;s violence as being &quot;genuinely grisly and unappealing&quot; while also noting that the film wasn&#x27;t without interest.

While most reviewers criticized the sadistic nature of the film&#x27;s violence in general and Nash&#x27;s death in particular, one of the film&#x27;s producers said that the film&#x27;s commercial failure was because of a lack of violence and that Nash&#x27;s death should have been shown: &quot;There&#x27;s other gore in the movie, other killings, but this is the main one. It&#x27;s the motivation for the hero. You can&#x27;t show all the killings we showed and then not show the main one. It&#x27;s cheating the audience&quot;.

Hauer would go on to say that critics misunderstood the film, calling it an allegory in which Ryder represents evil. The film has since been acknowledged as a cult classic and one of Hauer&#x27;s most iconic roles.

In 2024, filmmaker Christopher Nolan cited it as one of his favorite films, saying &quot;As a teenager, I never questioned the logic of this 80’s chiller, but now it seems mind-bendingly arbitrary plot-wise ... However, it does feature the criminally under-appreciated Rutger Hauer in his finest and most influential Euro-psycho performance this side of &quot;Blade Runner&quot;.&quot;

==Legacy==
The film spawned a sequel, &quot;The Hitcher II: I&#x27;ve Been Waiting&quot;, in 2003, with Howell reprising his role as Jim Halsey.

The remake using the original title, produced by Michael Bay and directed by Dave Meyers, was released on January 19, 2007, starring Sean Bean as John Ryder, Zachary Knighton as Jim Halsey, and Neal McDonough as Esteridge. The remake added a female protagonist named Grace Andrews, who was portrayed by Sophia Bush.

<text>Port-Royal National Historic Site is a National Historic Site located on the north bank of the Annapolis Basin in Granville Ferry, Nova Scotia, Canada. The site is the location of the Habitation at Port-Royal, which was the centre of activity for the New France colony of Port Royal in Acadia from 1605 to 1613, when it was destroyed by English forces from the Colony of Virginia.

==History==

The French colony of Port Royal, centered on the habitation, was the first successful attempt by Europeans to establish a permanent settlement in what is today known as Canada. The habitation&#x27;s active period was from 1605 to 1613. Although the European settlement of Port Royal persevered, with some interruptions, the habitation&#x27;s role as the focus of the colony ended with its destruction in 1613.

In 1629, Charles Fort, now Fort Anne, was established by Scottish settlers. The founding of the new fort permanently shifted the Port Royal colony&#x27;s centre of activity. The settlement around the new fort would evolve into the modern day town of Annapolis Royal.

=== 20th century ===
On May 25, 1925, the national Historic Sites and Monuments Board recognized the original Habitation at for its heritage significance, and the then Minister of the Interior, Charles Stewart, designated it Port-Royal National Historic Site.

In the 1930s, the approximate site of the original Habitation was located in the community and the results of archaeological excavations fed public interest in the period of the original French settlement. This interest had been increasing since the publication of &quot;Quietly My Captain Waits&quot;, an historical novel by the Canadian novelist Evelyn Eaton set in Port-Royal in the early 17th century.

In the early 1900s, chiefly under the leadership of Harriette Taber Richardson, a native of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and summer resident of the nearby town of Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotian preservationists and historians began lobbying the Government of Canada to build a replica of the Habitation which stood from 1605 until its destruction in 1613.

The government agreed to have the replica built on the original site. Construction took place from 1939 to 1941 and was based on a duplicate set of plans for the original Habitation that had been recently discovered in France. This was the first National Historic Site to have a replica structure built.

Today, this replica serves as the cornerstone of Port-Royal National Historic Site, and, coupled with nearby Fort Anne National Historic Site in Annapolis Royal, continues to commemorate this important historic region for visitors. Today, the replica of the Habitation is considered a milestone in the national heritage movement. Operated by Parks Canada, it is open to the public as a unit of the national park system, staffed by historical interpreters in period costumes, and is a major tourist attraction. Costumed interpreters provide demonstrations of such historic early 17th-century activities as farming, building, cooking, fur trading and Mi&#x27;kmaq life.

<text>Blam Blam Blam were a New Zealand pop/rock/alternative band. Tim Mahon (bass) and Mark Bell (guitar, vocals) had been members of The Plague and The Whizz Kids. After losing their drummer Ian Gilroy to The Swingers in 1980, Tim and Mark joined up with Don McGlashan, a multi-instrumentalist who played drums and sang many lead vocals.

==History==
The band&#x27;s first release was the song &quot;Motivation&quot; on the Propeller Records &quot;Class of 81&quot; compilation album in March 1981. They then released a four-track self-titled EP for the label, which hit the top 40 in New Zealand. The band had two hit singles in 1981 with &quot;There is No Depression in New Zealand&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Fight it Marsha, It&#x27;s Bigger Than Both of Us&quot; (which McGlashan later re-recorded with The Mutton Birds).

In 1982 vocalist Dick Driver joined the band, but soon left. The band recorded an album &quot;Luxury Length&quot;, which reached No. 4. in the New Zealand charts. Later that year the band were involved in a car accident where Tim Mahon was seriously injured.

In 1984 the band briefly reunited, recording the live album &quot;The Blam Blam Blam story&quot;. Don McGlashan has since worked on a number of movie soundtracks, and been in the bands The Front Lawn, From Scratch, and The Mutton Birds, and recorded an album for Propeller Records with Ivan Zagni, who was a guest on &quot;Luxury Length&quot;. Tim Mahon and Mark Bell both played in Ivan Zagni&#x27;s Big Sideways and Avant Garage groups. Tim Mahon has since worked in music management. Mark Bell works as a session guitarist and as a journalist.

&quot;There is no Depression in New Zealand&quot; remains a well-known song in its home country. One of its notable uses was as a maiden speech in Parliament in 2002. Metiria Turei of the Green Party read a Maori translation of the song, which Russell Brown&#x27;s liner notes to &quot;The Complete Blam Blam Blam&quot; (see below) described as &quot;a quirky, arty, militant thing to do. Which probably makes it a perfect Blam Blam Blam moment.&quot;

&quot;The Complete Blam Blam Blam&quot; was released in 1992. It contained almost the entire Blam Blam Blam back catalogue. This was remastered in 2003 by Chris Chetland at Auckland&#x27;s Kog Transmissions, on a single CD, although the general consensus seems to be that the earlier mastering was superior. Another reunion tour accompanied the release.

They reformed again for a tour in mid-2007. In August and September 2019 a reunion tour included dates in Dunedin, Christchurch, Auckland, Paekakariki and Wellington.

<text>The General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists is the governing organization of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Its headquarters is located in Silver Spring, Maryland and oversees the church in directing its various divisions and leadership, as well as doctrinal matters.

The General Conference, which is overseen by an executive committee and an elected President of the General Conference, is the administrative head of the global church. The denomination is organized in a representative form of church government, which means authority arises from the membership of local churches. In addition to administering their own congregations, churches send representatives to vote on matters and leaders in a shared local unit of administration. They vote also on who will represent them in a large area, with further representation selected at each successively larger administrative region. Finally, the General Conference elects the executive committee and officers who hold its authority between the decisions of the quinquennial General Conference Session.

Four units of church structure provide organization. They are interdependent while holding some unique authorities and consisting of specific constituencies.

#The local church and its members.
#The local conference (in some cases, a field) is made up of a number of churches in an area such as a state, province, or territory.
#The union conference (in some cases, a union mission) is made up of conferences and fields in a larger geographical area.
#The General Conference administers the worldwide direction of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The General Conference includes 13 regional administrative sections, called divisions as well as four attached unions/fields.

===Divisions and attached unions/fields===

==Meetings==
The General Conference holds three meetings in which leaders from around the world gather to discuss church issues and finances. While two meetings meet annually, usually at the world headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, the third meets every five years in a selected city.

* Spring Meeting meets every April
* Annual Council meets every October
* General Conference Session meets quinquennially in a selected city

<doc id="905196" wikidata="Q353395" url="?curid=905196" title="Peter Racine Fricker">
<text>Peter Racine Fricker (5 September 19201 February 1990) was an English composer, among the first to establish his career entirely after the Second World War. He lived in the US for the last thirty years of his life. Fricker wrote over 160 works in all the main genres excepting opera. He was a descendant of the French playwright Racine.

==Early career==
Fricker was born in Ealing, London, England and studied composition with R. O. Morris, organ with Ernest Bullock and piano with Henry Wilson at the Royal College of Music. After serving in the Royal Air Force during World War II, Fricker undertook a period of study with Mátyás Seiber at Morley College. During the war he served in the Royal Air Force as a radio operator and in 1943 he married (Audrey) Helen Clench, a Czech pianist who had been with him at the RCM. After the war Fricker became a professor of composition at the RCM, and in 1952 he became director of music at Morley College, where he succeeded Michael Tippett.

==Music==
His Wind Quintet (1947) attracted widespread attention, and his First String Quartet (1947) and First Symphony (1949) were also well received. Four more symphonies (1951, 1960, 1966, 1976) followed, which are among his most appreciated works. Other works include &quot;Paseo&quot; for guitar (1969), &quot;Sinfonia in Memoriam Benjamin Britten&quot; (1977), two violin concertos (1950, 1954), choral and chamber works (including the 1956 Sonata for Cello and Piano, recorded twenty years later for L&#x27;Oiseau Lyre by Julian Lloyd Webber and John McCabe) and works for piano and organ.

In 1952 his &quot;Concertante&quot; for three pianos, strings and percussion was performed by the identical twin piano duo Mary and Geraldine Peppin with additional pianist Kyla Greenbaum. His Horn Sonata, Op 24 was premiered by Dennis Brain and the pianist, Harry Isaacs at the Conway Hall, on 20 March 1955.

Stylistically his music was significantly different from the mainstream English school of the middle 20th century; instead of following in the lyrical, folk-song influenced tradition of Holst, Vaughan Williams and others, he wrote music which was chromatic, contrapuntal, and acerbic—more akin to Schoenberg, Bartók, and Hindemith than to any of his English contemporaries. Unlike Schoenberg, however, he never abandoned tonality altogether, preferring to work in a dissonant idiom which retained a tonal basis—a position considered to be conservative in the musical milieu of the 1950s and 1960s.

==Later career==
Fricker became visiting professor of music at the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1964 and moved with his wife to Goleta, Santa Barbara the following year. Six years later, he took a permanent position at this university; he became chairman of the Music Department in 1970, and was appointed &quot;faculty research lecturer&quot; in 1979, the highest academic honour which the university bestows on its faculty. However, he maintained links with the UK and Europe through the International Society for Contemporary Music and the Composers&#x27; Guild of Great Britain. From 1984 to 1986 he was president of the Cheltenham International Festival of Music and Literature in England. He continued to compose large-scale works, including his Fourth and Fifth symphonies, the oratorio &quot;Whispers at these Curtains&quot; op 88 (1984) setting John Donne, and the Concerto for Orchestra, composed for the 1986 festival. His final orchestral work, &quot;With Joyance&quot; (1989), was written for the Santa Barbara Symphony Orchestra, for which he had become composer in residence. But Fricker died the following year, of cancer of the throat, in Santa Barbara, California, United States, aged 69.

<doc id="905198" wikidata="Q1014130" url="?curid=905198" title="Kalulushi">
<text>Kalulushi is a town in the Copperbelt Province in north central Zambia. It is located on the M18 road, just west of Kitwe. Municipal (district) population was 75,806 at the 2000 census. Kalulushi emerged as a planned company town with the development of mining Companies in the mid-20th century - initially housing the main offices for the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines. Economic activity in Kalulushi (as well as the surrounding area) declined severely with the closure of 2 Shaft and 7 Shaft Mining sites.

There is a famous story of the origin of the name Kalulushi. The story goes like this. Two gentlemen went hunting for rabbits. Rabbits, in the local Lamba language, are referred to as &quot;kalulu.&quot; During their hunt they eventually spotted one rabbit. One of the gentlemen in excitement called out &quot;kalulu!&quot;. The other gentlemen quietly told his friend, &quot;shhhh&quot; in order to avoid alarming the rabbit and prevent the rabbit from running away. So that&#x27;s how the name Kalulushi came about. And so the story goes.
Kalulushi was established in 1953 as a company town for workers at the nearby Chibuluma copper and cobalt mine, and it became a public town in 1958. It is located 14 km (9 mi) west of Kitwe, the nearest rail station, at an altitude of 1,260 m (4,130 ft). The city&#x27;s major employer is Chambishi metals. The Chati Forest Reserve west of the city manages large plantations of eucalyptus, tropical pine, and other exotic tree species supplying wood for the mining industry. The Woods are also supplied to ZESCO an electricity company.

<doc id="905199" wikidata="Q2202467" url="?curid=905199" title="USS Sims (DD-409)">
<text>USS &quot;Sims&quot; (DD-409) was the lead ship of her class of destroyers in the United States Navy during World War II. She was the first ship to be named for William Sims, an Admiral who pushed for the modernization of the Navy.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Sims&quot; was laid down on 15 July 1937 by Bath Iron Works Corporation in Bath, Maine. She was launched on 8 April 1939, sponsored by Mrs. Anne Erwin Sims, and commissioned on 1 August 1939.

== Service history ==

=== Inter-War Period ===
After shakedown training in the Caribbean and post-shakedown availability in the Boston Navy Yard, &quot;Sims&quot; joined the Atlantic Squadron at Norfolk, Virginia on 2 August 1940. The destroyer operated with the Neutrality Patrol in Caribbean and South Atlantic waters. In November–December 1940, &quot;Sims&quot; patrolled off Martinique. On 28 May 1941, the ship arrived at Newport, Rhode Island, and began operating from there. She sailed for Iceland on 28 July with an American task force. In August, the destroyer patrolled the approaches to Iceland. In September–October, the ship made two North Atlantic patrols. &quot;Sims&quot; had been attached to Destroyer Squadron 2 (DesRon 2) since she began making Neutrality Patrols.

=== World War II ===
With the outbreak of war on 7 December 1941, DesRon 2 became part of Task Force 17 (TF17) formed around . The task force sortied from Norfolk on 16 December 1941 for San Diego, California. From there, it sailed as part of a convoy taking Marines to Samoa, arriving on 23 January 1942.

At the time, it was believed that the Japanese would attack Samoa to sever Allied communications with Australia. To thwart such a move, a carrier raid against Japanese bases in the Marshall Islands was planned. The &quot;Yorktown&quot; task force was to strike the islands of Mili, Jaluit, and Makin, while another force centered on was to hit Kwajalein, Wotje, and Maloelap.

TF 17 departed Samoa on 25 January, with &quot;Sims&quot; in the screen. At 1105 on 28 January, she sighted an enemy bomber. At 1114, a stick of four bombs fell approximately 1,500 yards astern, straddling the wake of the destroyer. The next day, the two carrier forces and a bombardment group attacked the islands and withdrew.

&quot;Sims&quot;, with TF 17, sailed from Pearl Harbor on 16 February to attack Wake Island. Shortly after departing, their sailing orders were changed, and they proceeded to the Canton Island area. Canton is a small island on the Honolulu-New Caledonia air route, and it was thought to be endangered by the Japanese.

By early March, the Japanese had occupied Lae and Salamaua on the north coast of New Guinea. To check this drive, a carrier strike was launched on 10 March from and &quot;Yorktown&quot;. &quot;Sims&quot; remained near Rossel Island in the Louisiade Archipelago with a force of cruisers and destroyers to protect the carriers from enemy surface ships. &quot;Sims&quot; next operated in the New Caledonia-Tonga Islands area.

==== Battle of the Coral Sea ====
In late April 1942, a Japanese task force was assembled to begin operations in support of Japanese moves towards Australia. This consisted of a covering group to protect landing forces on Tulagi and Port Moresby and a striking force to eliminate Allied shipping in the Coral Sea. was attached to the covering force, and and were the striking force under command of Admiral Takeo Takagi. The American ships were divided into task forces centered on &quot;Lexington&quot; and &quot;Yorktown&quot;. &quot;Sims&quot; was ordered to escort USS &quot;Neosho&quot;. The task force refueled on 5–6 May and then detached &quot;Neosho&quot; and &quot;Sims&quot; to continue to the next fueling point.

On the morning of 7 May, a search plane from the Japanese striking force sighted the oiler and destroyer and reported them to Admiral Takagi as a carrier and a cruiser. Takagi ordered an all-out attack. At 0930, 15 high level bombers attacked the two ships but did no damage. At 1038, 10 attacked the destroyer, but skillful maneuvering evaded the nine bombs that were dropped. A third attack against the two ships by 36 &quot;Val&quot; dive bombers was devastating. &quot;Neosho&quot; was soon crippled and burning aft as the result of seven direct hits and one plane that dived into her.

&quot;Sims&quot; was attacked from all directions. The destroyer defended herself as best she could. Three bombs hit the destroyer. Two exploded in the engine room, and within minutes, the ship buckled amidships and began to sink, stern first. As &quot;Sims&quot; slid beneath the waves, there was a tremendous explosion that raised what was left of the ship almost out of the water. Chief R. J. Dicken, in a damaged whaleboat, picked up 15 other survivors. They remained with &quot;Neosho&quot; until they were rescued by on 11 May. &quot;Sims&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 24 June 1942.

== Awards ==
&quot;Sims&quot; received two battle stars for World War II service.

<doc id="905202" wikidata="Q4658683" url="?curid=905202" title="A Pagan Place">
<text>A Pagan Place is the second studio album by the Waterboys, released by Ensign Records on 28 May 1984. It was the first Waterboys record with Karl Wallinger as part of the band and also includes Roddy Lorimer&#x27;s first trumpet solo for the band on the track &quot;A Pagan Place&quot;.

The album shares a title with the book &quot;A Pagan Place&quot;, written by Irish novelist Edna O&#x27;Brien. According to a post at the official Waterboys forum, Mike Scott, who chose the album name, has never read the book, and neither the album nor the title track share any other similarities with the novel.

==Production history==
Recording for &quot;A Pagan Place&quot; was begun before either the band&#x27;s first single, &quot;A Girl Called Johnny&quot;, or album, &quot;The Waterboys&quot;, were released. The album comprises two recording sessions. The first, in November 1982 at Redshop Studio in London, involved Mike Scott, Anthony Thistlethwaite and Kevin Wilkinson. The second session, held September 1983 at Rockfield Studio in Wales, included contributions from Wallinger, who had joined the band that year. The four, the early band&#x27;s core membership, were joined by Lorimer, Tim Blanthorn, and Eddi Reader, among others, for later overdubbing of the sessions to add full instrumentation to the recordings.

A remastered, edited and expanded version of &quot;A Pagan Place&quot; was issued in 2002 by Chrysalis Records. It added the song &quot;Some of My Best Friends Are Trains&quot;, not present on the original LP release, as track 5, and replaced the original versions of &quot;All the Things She Gave Me&quot; and &quot;The Thrill Is Gone&quot; with their full, unedited versions. &quot;The Thrill Is Gone&quot; also features a different vocal take. In the sleeve notes, Scott explained that edited versions of the two songs were included to keep the duration of each side of the LP to around 20 minutes for sound quality reasons, although he has always considered the full, unedited versions to be the &quot;real&quot; ones.

==Songs==
&quot;A Pagan Place&quot; expanded the Waterboys&#x27; treatment of spiritual themes beyond the Christian beliefs of &quot;December&quot; from &quot;The Waterboys&quot;. &quot;A Church Not Made With Hands&quot; is an ode to a woman who &quot;is everywhere and no place / Her church not made with hands&quot;.

Both &quot;All the Things She Gave Me&quot; and &quot;The Thrill is Gone&quot; discuss the end of a romantic relationship. &quot;Rags&quot; and &quot;Somebody Might Wave Back&quot; discuss despair and optimism in loneliness. Scott&#x27;s songwriting has been criticized as being overly introspective, and all four tracks contain some element of self-reflection. Wallinger later chose &quot;The Thrill Is Gone&quot; as his favourite Waterboys track that he did not play on.

&quot;The Big Music&quot; was released as a single, and became a descriptor of the sound of the album, the preceding debut &quot;The Waterboys&quot; and the following album &quot;This Is the Sea&quot;. Waterboys chronicler Ian Abrahams described the song as the album&#x27;s defining track, with New Musical Express&#x27; Andrew Collins stating, &quot;What a concept and what an albatross. A lilting anthem with grand cymbal slashes, soulful backing... a lazy, meandering essay.&quot; For the Waterboys&#x27; gig at London&#x27;s Town &amp; Country Club in 1985, backing vocals to the song were provided by Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, marking her first UK live appearance. Usage of the term &quot;The Big Music&quot; spread to include other bands with a similar sound. The single included &quot;Bury My Heart&quot; and &quot;The Earth Only Endures&quot;. &quot;Bury My Heart&quot;, a reference to &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot;, is described by Anderson as &quot;a lament to the decimated American Red Indians&quot;. &quot;The Earth Only Endures&quot; is a traditional Sioux song arranged by Scott.

&quot;Red Army Blues&quot; first appeared on the twelve-inch single for &quot;December&quot; from &quot;The Waterboys&quot;. The song is a first-person narrative of the life of a young Soviet soldier in World War II who participates in the Battle of Berlin. The soldier, along with many others, is sent to the Gulag by Joseph Stalin. The song is based upon the book &quot;The Diary of Vikenty Angorov&quot; and borrows main musical theme from Polyushko-polye by Lev Knipper.

The final track of the original release, &quot;A Pagan Place&quot;, featuring a trumpet solo from Lorimer, is an ambiguous questioning of the process of Christianising a Pagan culture.

The song &quot;Cathy&quot;, included on the album&#x27;s re-issue, was originally a Nikki Sudden song. Sudden writes about an evening in 1982 when he was staying in Scott&#x27;s apartment: &quot;Late that night – around midnight – Mike recorded a lead vocal to the backing track for my song, Cathy. We did a quick mix and that was that until twenty years ago [sic] when he includes the number on the reissue of his &quot;A Pagan Place&quot; album&quot;. This 2002 reissue credits Sudden as the song&#x27;s author.

== Critical reception ==

Peter Anderson, writing in &quot;Record Collector&quot;, asserts that there was &quot;unanimous critical acclaim&quot;. Upon its release, &quot;Fife Free Press&quot; wrote, &quot;Theirs is music on the grand scale with Mike Scott vocalising his superb word pictures over widescreen arrangements which at times are quite breathtaking in their scope and imagination.&quot; The reviewer noted the album &quot;contains no fillers&quot;, but highlighted the &quot;striking epic ballad&quot; &quot;Red Army Blues&quot;, the &quot;superb single&quot; &quot;The Big Music&quot;, the &quot;impassioned&quot; &quot;Rags&quot;, with its &quot;soaring guitar riffs&quot;, and the &quot;utterly contagious&quot; &quot;Church Not Made with Hands&quot;. He recommended the album &quot;unreservedly&quot; and added it was a &quot;certain choice for my top 20 albums of 1984&quot;.

Peter Anderson of the &quot;Torquay Herald Express&quot; called it &quot;quite simply the best album&quot; since U2&#x27;s &quot;Boy&quot; and concluded, &quot;If the Waterboys are not the band of 1984 I will eat my Biro.&quot; James Belsey of the &quot;Bristol Evening Post&quot; praised it as a &quot;big, rich album full of powerful sounds, vocal and instrumental, and attractive songs&quot; and added, &quot;Terrific self-confidence... they sound as if they were already a megogroup.&quot; Alan McQuillan of the &quot;Western Daily Press&quot; considered it a &quot;strong, determined album, a sort of Sixties Scots-born Springsteen, if that is possible, with lots of soaring sax and piano over simple guitar, bass and drums&quot;.

&quot;Eurotipsheet&quot; commented on the &quot;inspired and almost possessed music and lyrics which will please the Dylan, Patti Smith and New York Dolls&#x27; fans&quot;. They picked &quot;The Big Music&quot; and &quot;Somebody Might Wave Back&quot; as the &quot;strongest&quot; tracks. In Canada, Kevin C. Wynne of &quot;RPM&quot; called it &quot;nothing short of outstanding&quot; and &quot;perhaps destined to be the finest record of 1984&quot;. He noted Scott as the &quot;focal point&quot; and the &quot;intelligent use of brass and pseudo-orchestral effects&quot;, which creates &quot;a sense of majesty, of quests unfulfilled; that peculiar and pleasant sensation of longing and optimism which the truly great stuff induces&quot;.

<text>The &quot;Sims&quot;-class destroyers were built for the United States Navy, and commissioned in 1939 and 1940. These twelve ships were the last United States destroyer class completed prior to the American entry into World War II. All &quot;Sims&quot;-class ships saw action in World War II, and seven survived the war. No ship of this class saw service after 1946. They were built under the Second London Naval Treaty, in which the limit on destroyer standard displacement was lifted, but an overall limit remained. Thus, to maximize the number of destroyers and avoid developing an all-new design, the &quot;Sims&quot; class were only 70 tons larger as designed than previous destroyers. They are usually grouped with the 1500-ton classes and were the sixth destroyer class since production resumed with the &quot;Farragut&quot; class in 1932.

The class served extensively in World War II, and five of the class were lost in the war. Of the five ships lost, four were at the hands of the Japanese and one at the hands of the Germans. The class served on Neutrality Patrols in the Atlantic in 1940-41. Except for &quot;Roe&quot;, &quot;Wainwright&quot;, and &quot;Buck&quot;, the class was transferred to the Pacific shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor. All of the ships saw extensive combat service. At the war&#x27;s end in August 1945, three of the seven survivors were undergoing overhauls that were left unfinished, and were ultimately scrapped. The remaining four seaworthy ships were used as targets during the 1946 Operation Crossroads atomic tests at Bikini Atoll. One was sunk by the first blast, while the other three were sunk as targets two years later after serving as experimental platforms.

==Design==

Compared with the s, the &quot;Sims&quot; class were increased in hull length, and started a trend of increased size that led to the numerous larger 2100-ton destroyer classes that marked wartime construction. The class was designed by Gibbs &amp; Cox. They incorporated streamlining of the bridge structure and the forward part of the hull, in an attempt to increase speed and improve fuel economy. They also had an additional 5-inch gun, with the torpedo tubes re-arranged so one less quadruple mount could be used while maintaining an eight-tube broadside.

When , first of the class to be delivered in early 1939, was found to be 150 tons overweight and dangerously top-heavy due to insufficient metacentric height, it touched off a redesign and rebuilding of the class. One gun (No. 3) and one quad torpedo tube mount were removed, with another torpedo tube mount relocated to the centerline. It was determined that an underestimate by the Bureau of Engineering of the weight of a new machinery design was responsible, and that the Bureau of Construction and Repair did not have sufficient authority to detect or correct the error during the design process. Acting Secretary of the Navy Charles Edison proposed consolidation of the design divisions of the two bureaus. When the bureau chiefs could not agree on how to do this, he replaced both chiefs in September 1939. The consolidation into the new Bureau of Ships was finally effected by a law passed by Congress on 20 June 1940.

===Engineering===
The &quot;Sims&quot; class nearly duplicated the advanced machinery of the preceding &quot;Benham&quot; class, they were the last built with the boiler rooms adjacent forward and the engine rooms adjacent aft and therefore the last one-stack US destroyers. Steam pressure was (one reference says 565 psi), superheated to . Features that improved fuel economy included boiler economizers, double reduction gearing, and cruising turbines. The main turbines developed on &quot;Sims&quot;&#x27; trials and were manufactured by Westinghouse.

===Armament===
The &quot;Sims&quot; class introduced the advanced Mark 37 Gun Fire Control System. With a turret-mounted gun director as in previous systems, the Mark 37 system incorporated the Ford Mark 1 Fire Control Computer mounted in a plotting room deep in the hull, which enabled automatic aiming of guns against surface or air targets with firing solutions in near real-time. The system would evolve and be used extensively to control most 5-inch guns on destroyers and larger ships, and remained in service on US ships until the 1970s.

The class was completed with five 5-inch dual purpose guns (anti-surface and anti-aircraft (AA)); the two forward mounts and the aftermost mount were enclosed. The class proved to be top-heavy, and a quadruple torpedo mount and one 5-inch gun (No. 3) were removed by 1941. Early units were completed with 12 torpedo tubes in three quad mounts, one mounted centerline, the others port and starboard, while later ships were completed (and all eventually modified) with eight in two quad mounts, all on the centerline. The Mark 15 torpedo was equipped. The 5 inch guns were removed some time after the torpedo tubes were removed in most cases.

The as-built light AA armament of four .50 caliber machine guns (12.7 mm), the same as previous 1500-ton classes, was inadequate. This was partially remedied by increasing the number of guns to eight by 1941. As with most US Navy warships, the light AA armament was replaced with 40 mm Bofors and 20 mm Oerlikon guns within 18 months after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Initially, this was four 40 mm in two twin mounts and four single 20 mm guns. In 1945, with the emerging &quot;kamikaze&quot; threat and the dwindling threat from Japanese surface ships, &quot;Mustin&quot;, &quot;Morris&quot;, and &quot;Russell&quot; had all torpedo tubes removed in favor of four additional 40 mm guns for a total of eight in four twin mounts and were authorized replacement of the 20 mm single mounts by twin mounts; the latter part was not completed.

The as-built anti-submarine armament of two depth charge racks was augmented by up to six K-gun depth charge throwers during the war.

==Service==
The class served extensively in World War II, and five of the class were lost in the war. Of the five ships lost, four were at the hands of the Japanese and one at the hands of the Germans. The class served on Neutrality Patrols in the North Atlantic, Caribbean, and South Atlantic in 1940–41. Except for &quot;Roe&quot;, &quot;Wainwright&quot;, and &quot;Buck&quot;, the class was transferred to the Pacific shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor, where they often screened aircraft carriers. Two were sunk as a direct result of this duty by the same torpedo spreads that killed their carriers; &quot;Hammann&quot; escorting in the Battle of Midway and &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; escorting on 15 September 1942 (&quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; did not sink until 19 October). 

&quot;Walke&quot; became the only ship of the class to be sunk in action against enemy surface warships when she attempted to attack Japanese warships at the naval battle of Guadalcanal, 15 November 1942, but was ambushed by Japanese destroyers. She was hit once from a six torpedo spread, fired from the Japanese destroyer Ayanami, that blew off her bow as she promptly went down and sank.

In the Atlantic, &quot;Wainwright&quot; escorted the ill-fated convoy PQ 17, and with &quot;Roe&quot; supported Operation Torch, the invasion of North Africa. &quot;Buck&quot;, damaged in a collision, missed Torch but was sunk by a U-boat off Salerno, Italy in 1943. The remainder of the class saw hard service in the Pacific. At the war&#x27;s end in August 1945, three of the seven survivors were undergoing overhauls that were left unfinished, and were ultimately scrapped. The remaining four seaworthy ships were used as targets during the 1946 Operation Crossroads atomic tests at Bikini Atoll. One was sunk by the first blast, while the other three were sunk as targets two years later after serving as experimental platforms.

<text>Humphrey Searle (26 August 1915 – 12 May 1982) was an English composer and writer on music. His music combines aspects of late Romanticism and modernist serialism, particularly reminiscent of his primary influences, Franz Liszt, Arnold Schoenberg and Anton Webern, who was briefly his teacher. As a writer on music, Searle published texts on numerous topics; he was an authority on the music of Franz Liszt, and created the initial cataloguing system for his works.

==Biography==
Searle was the son of Humphrey and Charlotte Searle and, through his mother, a grandson of Sir William Schlich. He was born in Oxford where he was a classics scholar before studying—somewhat hesitantly—with John Ireland at the Royal College of Music in London, after which he went to Vienna on a six-month scholarship to become a private pupil of Anton Webern, which became decisive in his composition career.

Searle was one of the foremost pioneers of serial music in the United Kingdom, and used his role as a producer at the BBC from 1946 to 1948 to promote it. He was General Secretary of the International Society for Contemporary Music from 1947 to 1949. He accepted this post with the encouragement of the new president, Edward Clark. For Clark, he composed the Quartet for Clarinet, Bassoon, Violin and Viola, Op. 12, a musical palindrome.

Searle wrote his Piano Sonata, Op. 21 for a recital at the Wigmore Hall on 22 October 1951, given by the Australian pianist Gordon Watson to celebrate the 140th anniversary of the birth of Franz Liszt. (Watson also performed the complete &quot;Transcendental Études&quot; on that occasion.) The Sonata was loosely based on Liszt&#x27;s Sonata in B minor and has been described as &quot;probably, both the finest and most original piano work ever produced by a British composer&quot;.

Other works of note include a &quot;Poem for 22 Strings&quot; (1950), premiered at Darmstadt, a Gogol opera, &quot;The Diary of a Madman&quot; (1958, awarded the first prize at UNESCO&#x27;s International Rostrum of Composers in 1960), and five symphonies (the first of which was commercially recorded by the London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Sir Adrian Boult).

He also composed film scores, including music for &quot;The Baby and the Battleship&quot; (1956), &quot;Beyond Mombasa&quot; (1956), &quot;Action of the Tiger&quot; (1957), &quot;The Abominable Snowman&quot; (1957), &quot;Law and Disorder&quot; (1958), &quot;Left Right and Centre&quot; (1959), &quot;October Moth&quot; (1960) and &quot;The Haunting&quot; (1963), as well the 1965 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Myth Makers&quot;.

Searle also contributed humorous compositions to some of the Hoffnung Music Festivals, including a setting of &quot;Young Lochinvar&quot; and a parody of serialism, &quot;Punkt Kontrapunkt&quot;.

Searle taught throughout his life; his notable students included Hugh Davidson, Brian Elias, Michael Finnissy, Jonathan Elias, Nicola LeFanu, Alistair Hinton, Geoffrey King, and Graham Newcater and Wolfgang Rihm. 

Searle wrote the monographs &quot;Twentieth Century Counterpoint&quot; and &quot;The Music of Franz Liszt&quot;. He also developed the most authoritative catalogue of Liszt&#x27;s works, which are frequently identified using Searle&#x27;s numbering system, abbreviated as &quot;S.&quot;.

Searle married Fiona Nicholson in 1960. He died in London in 1982, aged 66.

<doc id="905222" wikidata="Q1739887" url="?curid=905222" title="Keter">
<text>Keter or Kether (, &quot;Keṯer&quot;, lit. &quot;crown&quot;) is the first of the ten sefirot in the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, symbolizing the divine will and the initial impulse towards creation from the &quot;Ein Sof&quot;, or infinite source. It represents pure consciousness and transcends human understanding, often referred to as &quot;Nothing&quot; or the &quot;Hidden Light&quot;. Keter is associated with the divine name &quot;Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh&quot; (), meaning &quot;I Am that I Am&quot;, which was revealed to Moses from the burning bush, and it embodies the qualities of absolute compassion and humility. Its meaning is &quot;crown&quot;, and it is interpreted as both the &quot;topmost&quot; of the Sefirot and the &quot;regal crown&quot; thereof.

Keter is positioned at the top of the Tree of Life, sitting above and between Chokmah on the right and Binah on the left, and above Tiferet. It is often depicted with three primary paths: one leading to Chokmah, another to Binah, and the third to Tiferet. This positioning highlights its role as the source from which wisdom (Chokmah) and understanding (Binah) emanate, and it emphasizes its connection to beauty and harmony (Tiferet), thereby facilitating the flow of divine energy through the sefirot.

Keter is called in the &quot;Zohar&quot; &quot;the most hidden of all hidden things&quot;. Moses ben Jacob Cordovero describes Keter as the source of the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy, derived from a verse in the Book of Micah. These attributes emphasize compassion, forgiveness, and humility. Cordovero also outlines ethical behavior associated with Keter in his work &quot;The Palm Tree of Devorah&quot;, encouraging purity of thought and actions, such as always turning one&#x27;s ears to hear good and avoiding anger.

In Western esotericism, Keter is linked to the initial point of divine emanation, representing pure formless consciousness. It is associated with various divine and mystical figures, such as the archangel Metatron and the Tetramorph of the Holy Living Creatures.

==Etymology and names==
The Hebrew word &quot;Keter&quot; (כֶּתֶר) translates to &quot;crown&quot;. Since a crown is worn above the head, Keter symbolizes the highest level of the sefirot and the divine will in Kabbalah. Keter is also known as &quot;Nothing&quot; (אַיִן, &quot;ayin&quot;) or &quot;The Hidden Light&quot; (אוֹר הַגָּנוּז, &quot;Or HaGanuz&quot;), reflecting its abstract and ineffable nature. Keter is referenced in key Kabbalistic texts such as the &quot;Bahir&quot; and the &quot;Zohar&quot;, where it is described as &quot;the most hidden of all hidden things&quot;.

==History==

The concept of Keter has evolved significantly within Kabbalistic thought. Early references to Keter can be found in foundational texts such as the &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot; and &quot;Bahir&quot;. In these texts, Keter is described as the first emanation, representing the initial divine will and the beginning of creation. The &quot;Zohar&quot;, a cornerstone of Kabbalistic literature, describes Keter as &quot;the most hidden of all hidden things&quot;, emphasizing its transcendence and ineffability. Medieval Kabbalists, including Moses ben Jacob Cordovero (1522-1570) and Isaac Luria (1534-1572), further elaborated on Keter&#x27;s attributes, solidifying its role as the highest sefirah and its importance in the divine emanation process. These interpretations influenced later Kabbalistic and Hasidic teachings.

Kabbalah made its way into Western esotericism during the Renaissance, largely through the efforts of figures like Johannes Reuchlin (1455-1522), who studied and wrote about Kabbalah extensively. In the 19th century, Eliphas Levi (1810-1875) further integrated Kabbalistic ideas into Western occult traditions. The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, founded by Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers (1854-1918) and others, incorporated Kabbalah into their teachings, significantly shaping modern Western esotericism. Aleister Crowley (1875-1947), a prominent figure in Western occultism, also utilized Kabbalistic concepts in his works, particularly in &quot;The Book of Thoth&quot;, which connects the tarot to the Tree of Life.

==Description==
According to the &quot;Bahir&quot;:

The first sefirah is called the Crown, since a crown is worn above the head. The Crown therefore refers to things that are above the mind&#x27;s abilities to comprehend. All of the other sephirot are likened to the body which starts with the head and winds its way down into action. But the crown of a king lies above the head and connects the concept of &quot;monarchy,&quot; which is abstract and intangible, with the tangible and concrete head of the king. The crown endows the person with the power and prerogatives of royalty.

Keter represents the primal stirrings of intent in the &quot;Ein Soph&quot; (infinity), or the arousal of desire to come forth into the varied life of being. But in this sense, although it contains all the potential for content, it contains no content itself, and is therefore called &quot;Nothing&quot;, &quot;The Hidden Light&quot;, and the &quot;air that cannot be grasped&quot;. Being desire to bring the world into being, Keter is absolute compassion.

Keter is associated with two &quot;partzufim&quot; or divine personas: &quot;Arik Anpin&quot; (אריך אנפין) and &quot;Atik Yomin&quot; (עתיק יומין). &quot;Arik Anpin&quot;, the &quot;Vast Countenance&quot;, symbolizes boundless mercy and spiritual bliss (ענג רוחני, &quot;oneg ruchani&quot;), while &quot;Atik Yomin&quot;, the &quot;Ancient of Days&quot;, represents the primal roots of divine consciousness and will (רצון, &quot;ratzon&quot;). In the symbolic family hierarchy, &quot;Atik Yomin&quot; is the great-grandfather, and &quot;Arik Anpin&quot; is the grandfather. Together, these partzufim reflect Keter&#x27;s dual nature as both an all-encompassing force and a deeply concealed, primordial essence.

The name of God associated with Keter is &quot;Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh&quot; (Hebrew: אהיה אשר אהיה), the name through which he revealed himself to Moses from the burning bush. Keter, although being the highest sefirah of its world, receives from the sefirah of Malkuth of the domain above it (see Sephirot). The uppermost Keter sits below no other sefirah, although it is below &quot;Ohr Ein Sof&quot; (&quot;Infinite Light&quot;), which is the source of all Sefirot.

==Qualities==
===Colour===
Keter is often associated with &quot;brilliance&quot; or &quot;translucent white&quot;. This color symbolizes the pure, undifferentiated light of the Ein Sof (Infinite), representing the ultimate potential and the source of all creation. Aryeh Kaplan describes Keter as being associated with &quot;radiant, brilliant light&quot; that transcends human perception, symbolizing spiritual purity and divine will. Gershom Scholem notes that Keter&#x27;s primal light is a metaphor for the most abstract and sublime aspect of the divine. Moshe Idel refers to this light as the &quot;hidden light,&quot; embodying the concept of potentiality and the source of all subsequent emanations.

===Ethical behaviour===
Moses ben Jacob Cordovero, in &quot;The Palm Tree of Devorah&quot;, discusses ethical behaviour that man should follow, related to the qualities of the Sephirot, in order that man might emulate his Creator. Humility is the first, because although Keter is the highest, it is ashamed to look at its cause, and instead gazes at those below it. One&#x27;s thoughts should be pure, one&#x27;s forehead should display no harshness, one&#x27;s ears should always turn to hear good, one&#x27;s eyes should distance themselves from noticing evil, always looking at the good, one&#x27;s nose should be free from the breath of anger, one&#x27;s face should always shine, and his mouth should express nothing except good.

=== Thirteen Attributes of Mercy ===
Through discussion of a line in the Book of Micah, 13 attributes are associated with Keter:

Who is God like you, who pardons iniquity and forgives the transgressions of the remnant of his heritage? He does not maintain His anger forever, for He delights in kindness. He will again show us compassion, He will vanquish our iniquities, and You will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. Show faithfulness to Ya&#x27;akov, kindness to Avraham, which You have sworn to our fathers from days of old. (&quot;Michah&quot;, 7:18-20)

Accordingly, the 13 attributes are derived from this and are described in great detail.

Additionally, the &quot;Thirteen Attributes of Mercy&quot; were described by Rabbi Chizkiyah in an allegorical depiction of a lily among thorns. The metaphor in whole is known and taught as &quot;The lily amongst the thorns,&quot; a phrase found in Shir Hashirim 2:2. A summary:

The secret of spiritual protection is revealed through a richly metaphorical discourse given by Rabbi Chizkiyah. The Rabbi explains that the spiritual forces that protect and watch over us are called the 13 Attributes of Mercy. They are transmitted into our physical world through the first 13 words of the Torah. When judgments are decreed against us, these 13 forces can safeguard us from their influence. We begin drawing this Light of protection to ourselves at the very moment we begin to browse and behold the mystical shapes and sequences of the Aramaic text, and to learn the spiritual insights presented there.

==Practical applications==
In practical Kabbalistic practices, Keter is approached through meditation and visualization techniques aimed at connecting with the divine will and transcendent consciousness. Practitioners often focus on the attributes of Keter, such as absolute compassion and humility, to cultivate these qualities within themselves. Meditative exercises may involve visualizing the crown above the head, symbolizing the flow of divine energy into one&#x27;s being. Reciting sacred texts and prayers associated with Keter, such as &quot;Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh,&quot; is also common, aiming to align oneself with the highest level of spiritual awareness and intention.

== In Western esotericism ==
In Western esotericism, Keter is considered the purest form of consciousness, transcending time and categories, originating from the Ein Sof Aur (&quot;Limitless Light&quot;), and initiating the process of divine emanation that culminates in Malkuth. Associated with the divine name &quot;Eheieh&quot;, the archangel that presides over it is Metatron, the order of angels that resides in it are the Holy Living Creatures (Chaioth ha Qadesh, חיות הקדש), and its physical manifestation is said to be the First Swirlings of the cosmos (Primum Mobile, Rashith ha Gilgalin).

In &quot;The Mystical Qabalah&quot;, Dion Fortune describes Keter as a timeless point of pure consciousness, marking the beginning of emanation. In the Golden Dawn tradition, Keter is identified with the planet Neptune, reflecting its connection to the mystical and the unknown. In Theosophy and Thelema, Keter is analogous to Ātma and Khabs am Pekht, respectively.

A. E. Waite wrote that Rabbi Azariel ben Menachem, a student of Isaac the Blind, in his &quot;Commentary on the Sephiroth&quot; granted a particular colour to each sefirah, yet these do not agree with the colours given in the &quot;Zohar&quot;, where Kether is called colourless, Tiphareth purple, and Malkuth sapphire-blue. In Aleister Crowley&#x27;s &quot;Liber 777&quot;, Keter is associated with White Brilliance, the Four Aces of the Tarot, Parabrahm, Wotan, Zeus, the Trinity, Almond in flower, Diamond, Elixir Vitae, Shangti, and Death. He also connects Keter to the qlippothic order of Thaumiel.

===Paths===
Keter connects to three primary paths, each leading to different sefirot and associated with specific tarot cards. The path to Chokmah, symbolizing wisdom and the initial creative impulse, is linked to &quot;The Fool&quot;, representing potential and new beginnings. The path to Binah, representing understanding and structure, corresponds to &quot;The Magician&quot;, symbolizing mastery and manifestation. The path to Tiferet, signifying beauty, balance, and harmony, is associated with &quot;The High Priestess&quot; representing intuition and inner knowledge. These paths highlight Keter&#x27;s role in channeling divine energy and insight through the Tree of Life.

<text>Bystrzyca Kłodzka (, ) is a historic town in Kłodzko County, in Lower Silesian Voivodeship in southwestern Poland. It is the administrative seat of Gmina Bystrzyca Kłodzka. As of December 2021, the town has a population of 9,773. The old town of Bystrzyca is famous for its many historical buildings and is a popular tourist destination.

==Geography==

Bystrzyca Kłodzka lies in the Kłodzko Valley near the confluence of the Eastern Neisse (&quot;Nysa Kłodzka&quot;) and Bystrzyca Łomnicka rivers, at the feet of the Bystrzyckie Mountains, a range of the Central Sudetes. Part of the Kłodzko Land historical region, it is located about south of Kłodzko.

==History==
The area of today&#x27;s Bystrzyca Kłodzka has been inhabited at least for six millennia. During the times of the Roman Empire the Celts established numerous permanent settlements in the area of Kłodzko along the ancient Amber Road. There are also numerous archaeological excavations of Lusatian culture remnants in the area.

===Middle Ages===
The town of &quot;Habelschwerdt&quot; was founded in the mid-13th century by German colonists on estates held by the Bohemian noble Havel of Markvartice, husband of Saint Zdislava Berka. They settled next to the older Slavic village of &quot;Bystřice&quot;, located on the important trade route leading along the Neisse river from Wrocław in Silesia through the Sudetes to Prague. The citizens were granted town privileges according to the so-called Western Law (a variant of Magdeburg rights). On 4 July 1319, the Luxembourg king John of Bohemia granted the settlement the vast autonomy of an immediate royal city and the right to construct city walls. Until the mid-14th century the town changed its affiliation several times, passing with the Kłodzko Land between Polish and Bohemian rulers.

The first noted mayor of Habelschwerdt was Jakob Rücker. The town was constructed almost from scratch and started to grow rapidly. First the city walls were erected with three gates and several towers. Then the market square was planned on a slope and the town hall was constructed. Most of the Gothic architecture was preserved and the town is now considered one of the classical examples of mediaeval architecture. City rights were confirmed by King John&#x27;s son, Charles IV in 1348 and Habelschwerdt was granted with several other privileges, among them the right to trade with salt, spices and fabric.

The town was incorporated into the County of Kladsko in 1459, an immediate fief of the Bohemian Crown and shared the fate of the nearby city of Kłodzko (&quot;Kladsko&quot;, &quot;Glatz&quot;). It developed rapidly until the advent of the Hussite Wars in the early 15th century. The wars left the town depopulated by plagues, partially burnt and demolished by several consecutive floods. It was plundered by the forces of the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus on his 1469 campaign against King George of Poděbrady. In 1475 a great fire destroyed the town completely.

===Modern times===

After the Lands of the Bohemian Crown had passed to the Habsburg monarchy, the area became a fief of the ruling Habsburg dynasty in 1567, though the local counts retained their powers. Habelschwerdt and the surrounding villages were gradually repopulated, mostly with settlers from Central Germany and Lesser Poland. It was not until the 16th century when the local economy went back on tracks, while the Protestant Reformation led to a strengthening of radical movements such as Schwenckfelder and Anabaptist groups. Because of major Lutheran influences it became one of the regional centres of Protestantism.

In the late 16th century a new city hall was built and many of the town houses were rebuilt in a Renaissance style. The town also built several facilities like paved roads and a sewer system. However, the Thirty Years&#x27; War and stern measures of the Counter-Reformation damaged the city and ended the period of prosperity.

During the Second Silesian War, Hungarian troops and Pandurs again devastated the town. On 14 February 1745, Prussian troops under General Hans von Lehwaldt defeated the Austrian Habsburg forces of Georg Oliver von Wallis nearby. After the Silesian Wars, Habelschwerdt, together with the County of Kladsko and most of Silesia, came under Prussian rule according to the 1763 Treaty of Hubertusburg. In the War of the Bavarian Succession, skirmishers from Austrian army commanded by Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser fought there against the Prussian garrison, and one of the blockhouses caught fire, resulting in the destruction of most of the town in mid-January 1779. During the Napoleonic Wars, the town was occupied by French forces and housed a garrison of the Grande Armée until 1813. 

By 1818 the County of Kladsko was formally dissolved and Habelschwerdt was incorporated into the Prussian Province of Silesia. Although it was made the administrative seat of a rural district (&quot;Landkreis&quot;), comprising the southeastern parts of the former county, it was also struck by high taxes. It was not until the mid-19th century when the town fully recovered. The city hall was yet again rebuilt, the city moat and parts of the walls were leveled and the settlement expanded into new areas. After 1877, Habelschwerdt was connected to Glatz and Breslau (Wrocław) by a railroad. In 1885, Habelschwerdt had a population of 5,597, while by 1939 it rose to 6,877. Its population was overwhelmingly Catholic. The end of the 19th century saw the whole Kłodzko Valley turned into one of the most popular tourist regions. Countless hotels, sanatoria and spa were opened to the public in the nearby towns of Glatz, Bad Reinerz (present-day Duszniki-Zdrój) and Bad Landeck (Lądek-Zdrój), as well as in the town itself. The area of former Kladsko county became a popular place among the rich bourgeoisie of Breslau, Berlin, Vienna and Kraków.

A labour camp of the Reich Labour Service was operated in the town under Nazi Germany. During World War II the town was spared the fate of many other towns and did not suffer great damage. There were no important industrial centres in the area, and most of the Kłodzko Valley was not captured by the Red Army until after the capitulation of Germany. After the war the town once again became part of Poland due to the new borders dictated by the Potsdam Agreement. It was renamed to its historic Polish name &quot;Bystrzyca&quot;, and the adjective &quot;Kłodzka&quot; was added to distinguish it from other Polish settlements of the same name.

In 1961 the town limits were expanded by including Niedźwiedna as a new district. In 1964, the only Phillumenist Museum (&quot;Muzeum Filumenistyczne&quot;) in Poland was founded in Bystrzyca Kłodzka. On 28 June 1972 the Catholic parishes of Bystrzyca Kłodzka were reassigned from the traditional Hradec Králové diocese (est. 1664; Ecclesiastical Province of Bohemia) to the Archdiocese of Wrocław. Between 1975 and 1998 Bystrzyca belonged to Wałbrzych Voivodeship. It continues to be one of the principal mountain resorts of the area. Thanks to its historical landmarks as well as virgin landscapes, Bystrzyca Kłodzka remains one of the most popular centers for tourism and winter sports in Lower Silesia.

In September 2024, the town was badly affected by the 2024 Central European floods.

==Sports==
The local football club is Polonia Bystrzyca Kłodzka. It competes in the lower leagues.

<doc id="905253" wikidata="Q6907654" url="?curid=905253" title="Moonbat">
<text>&quot;Moonbat&quot; is a pejorative political epithet used in United States politics, referring to liberals, progressives, or leftists (especially the far-left).

==Etymology==
Descriptions of bat-like people on the Moon were part of the 1835 Great Moon hoax.

A long poem, &quot;The Proving of Gennad: A Mythological Romance&quot; by Landred Lewis (1890), uses the term &quot;moonbat&quot; to refer to unsound ideas, but not specifically political ones.

The term was used by science fiction author Robert A. Heinlein in the 1947 short story &quot;Space Jockey&quot; as the name of a rocket spacecraft used for the third step of a journey from the Earth to the Moon.

==Examples of usage==
* On January 8, 2025, Lee Ann wrote a piece called, &quot;Life Is Short, Art Is Long, the Planet Is on Fire&quot;, for the In the Stolen Valley Substack blog that featured a drawing of a moonbat holding a picture of a burning Earth outside of a museum. The piece contextualized the climate protest at the National Gallery in Washington D.C. on April 27, 2023 when Tim Martin and Joanna Smith, two activists supporting the Declare Emergency campaign, applied finger paint to the glass case protecting the original 1881 Little Dancer sculpture by Edgar Degas and sat down beside her to talk about mutability and time on a whole other scale: the climate emergency. She was undamaged because they never intended to damage her. The sculpture was back on display ten days later.
* Columnist and radio talk show host Howie Carr has used the term a number of times in his column in the &quot;Boston Herald&quot;. On the radio he frequently uses the term as a pejorative toward those holding left-wing political beliefs. In 2008, Carr wrote about the number of &quot;Moonbats&quot; inhabiting the town of Arlington, Massachusetts. In response, a group of Arlington residents founded the Menotomy Moonbats to raise money for their local public schools: Menotomy was the historical name for Arlington during the American Revolutionary War.
* On March 14, 2000 Jonah Goldberg&#x27;s &quot;National Review&quot; Online column &quot;Our, *ahem*, FAQ Welcome New Readers&quot; contained the following: &quot;Alas, because Goldberg watches Baywatch everyday and can name the main characters in almost every Marvel comic book from 1976 to 1986, he occasionally makes errors. Far more often, he simply writes things that make readers say, &#x27;Is this guy higher than a moonbat?&#x27;&quot;
* Margery Eagan, another &quot;Herald&quot; columnist, used the term several times in 2006 and 2007 to characterize some supporters of former Massachusetts Democratic governor Deval Patrick.
* Columnist and blogger Michelle Malkin was quoted in March 2006 by Howard Kurtz as writing, &quot;But now the determined &quot;moonbat&quot; hordes have exposed multiple instances of what clearly appear to me to be blatant lifting of entire, unique passages by [blogger] Ben Domenech from other writers,&quot; in reference to Domenech&#x27;s resignation from the &quot;Washington Post&quot; after evidence of his plagiarism came to light.
* The term has been used in the UK to refer to George Monbiot, owing to its similarity with his surname, and referring to his left-wing views.
* &quot;Moonbat&quot; is the name of Conservative Jones&#x27; sidekick, a recurring character in the political cartoon &quot;This Modern World&quot; by Tom Tomorrow.

<doc id="905254" wikidata="Q647988" url="?curid=905254" title="Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction">
<text>As the collapse of the Soviet Union appeared imminent, the United States and their NATO allies grew concerned of the risk of nuclear weapons held in the Soviet republics falling into enemy hands. The Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program was initiated by the Nunn–Lugar Act (really the Soviet Nuclear Threat Reduction Act of 1991), which was authored and cosponsored by Sens. Sam Nunn (D-GA) and Richard Lugar (R-IN). The purpose of the CTR Program was originally &quot;to secure and dismantle weapons of mass destruction and their associated infrastructure in former Soviet Union states.&quot; As the peace dividend grew old, an alternative 2009 explanation of the program was &quot;to secure and dismantle weapons of mass destruction in states of the former Soviet Union and beyond&quot;. The CTR program funds have been disbursed since 1997 by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA).

== The first 15 years ==

CTR provided funding and expertise for states in the former Soviet Union (including Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan) to decommission nuclear, biological, and chemical weapon stockpiles, as agreed by the Soviet Union under disarmament treaties such as SALT I. This funding totaled $400 million a year for a total of four years. This $400 million was given to CTR-related defense programs. The Departments of Defense (DOD), Energy (DOE), state, and commerce were subject to distribute the funding. After the nuclear warheads were removed from their delivery vehicles by the post-Soviet successor militaries, Nunn-Lugar assistance provided equipment and supplies to destroy the missiles on which the warheads had been mounted, as well as the silos which had contained the missiles. The warheads themselves were then shipped to and destroyed in Russia, with the highly enriched uranium contained within made into commercial reactor fuel, which was purchased by the United States under a separate program. In recent years, the CTR program has expanded its mission from securing WMDs at the root source to protecting against WMD &quot;on the move&quot;, by enhancing land and maritime border security in the former Soviet Union.

According to the CTR website in 2007, CTR had four key objectives:
* Dismantle former Soviet Union (FSU)&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and associated infrastructure
* Consolidate and secure FSU WMD and related technology and materials
* Increase transparency and encourage higher standards of conduct
* Support defense and military cooperation with the objective of preventing proliferation

These objectives were compartmentalized into three program areas which include:
* Destruction and dismantlement
* Safety, security and non-proliferation
* Demilitarization and defense conversion

These areas were then pursued and achieved through a variety of programs. Briefly, these include: 
* The Cooperative Biological Engagement Program (CBEP; formerly the Biological Threat Reduction Program)
* Chemical Weapons Elimination Program
* Nuclear Weapons Storage Security Program (NWSS)
* Strategic Offensive Arms Elimination Program (SOAE)
* Weapons of Mass Destruction-Proliferation Prevention Initiative (WMD-PPI)

The CTR program is authorized by Title 22 of the United States Code, chapter 68a.

The FY 2007 CTR Annual Report to Congress provides a status update on the program as a whole and individual initiatives. It also details future planned endeavors in each area.
The Nunn-Lugar Act was a major contributor to de-escalation of nuclear weapon arsenals. This program was used for &quot;the transportation, storage, safeguarding and destruction of nuclear and other weapons in the Soviet Union… and to assist in the prevention of weapons proliferation&quot;. One contribution by the Nunn-Lugar program has been the &quot;delivery of equipment to accelerate the dismantlement of strategic nuclear delivery vehicles&quot; to the Soviet Union. This program made important contributions in the disarmament of nuclear warheads in many counties. The Nunn-Lugar program eliminated former strategic weapons outside of Russia. This was most evident in the removal of these weapons in Ukraine, after the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances. There were many countries that had Soviet nuclear weapons. Two others included Belarus and Kazakhstan. Nunn-Lugar helped Russia to move the nuclear arsenals in these countries to Russia or to dismember these weapons in these countries. The US sent &quot;nearly 700 emergency response items to help guarantee safe and secure transportation of nuclear weapons&quot; to Belarus for the aid of the elimination of nuclear weapons in this country. The Nunn-Lugar Act played a major role in a huge decrease in the quantity of nuclear weapons that had been stockpiled during the nuclear escalation period.

Another important contribution was seen when the US sent storage containers to Russia to store fissionable material under Russian control. The US provided &quot;10,000 fissile material storage containers by the end of 1995 and a total of nearly 33,000 containers by early 1997&quot;. These containers aided in Russia&#x27;s ability to store nuclear material from dismantled warheads. Another contribution from the US to Russia was &quot;75 million dollars to help Russia build a new fissile material storage facility at Chelyabinsk for plutonium &quot;pits&quot; from dismantled warheads&quot;. The Nuclear Threat Reduction program was not just used to remove everything fissionable from Russia; it also included ideas for safe storage and transportation of fissionable material in Russia built up during the Cold War.

=== 20th century outcome ===
Ukraine and Kazakhstan are nuclear weapons free in a small part because of this program. Under CTR, the U.S. and recipient states have made considerable advancements in global security against the threat of WMD. By 1997 all strategic Soviet nuclear weapons were removed from Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine marking an important landmark in the CTR initiative.

Weapons deactivated and destroyed under this program include:
* 537 ICBMs
* 459 ICBM silos
* 11 ICBM mobile missile launchers
* 128 bombers
* 708 nuclear air-to-surface missiles
* 408 submarine missile launchers
* 496 submarine-launched missiles
* 27 nuclear submarines
* 194 nuclear test tunnels

Other milestone results include:
* 260 tons of fissile material received security upgrades
* 60 nuclear warhead storage sites received security upgrades
* 35 percent of Russian chemical weapons received security upgrades
* 49 former biological weapons facilities were converted to joint U.S.–Russian research under what were known as the Biological Threat Reduction Integrating Contracts
* 4 biological weapons sites received security improvements
* 58,000 former weapons scientists employed in peaceful work through International Science and Technology Centers (ISTC)
* 750 projects involving 14,000 former weapons scientists and created some 580 new peaceful high-tech jobs; The International Proliferation Prevention Program has funded

One Nunn–Lugar site, Pavlograd, Ukraine, dedicated itself beginning in June 2004 to the decommissioning of nuclear missiles without burning their solid rocket fuel, thus preventing dioxins from threatening the local environment and human population. The Pavlograd missile factory PMZ has been converted to an advanced astronautics &quot;Space Clipper&quot; program.

== Expansion under Bush ==
Other countries are finding ways to produce, test, and acquire weapons of mass destruction. In an attempt to regulate WMD globally, the Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction has stepped outside of the former Soviet Union states. 2003 marked an important year for CTR expansion as the initiative was accepted by congress allowing the spread to countries not included within the prior Soviet Union. The Nunn-Lugar Expansion Act under the 108th congress granted up to $50 million to be used outside the former Soviet Union which focused primarily on Albania, North Korea, Iraq, and Libya.

Over time Nunn-Lugar has received many supporters and also many critics. Continuation and expansion has been up for debate since its initial formation in 1991. Proponents argue that the CTR does more good than harm which has led to funding expansion. This expansion of the program is displayed in the 1997 Defense Authorization Act whose purposed served in securing chemical and biological weapon materials. In contrast, opponents say that the US funding is going to other Russian programs. Going into the 21st century, efforts now have an expanded focus including a more generalized nuclear nonproliferation motive.

=== Libya ===
In 2003 Libya decided upon giving up on their nuclear weapons program. Funding from Nunn-Lugar allowed for secure transportation of nuclear materials from Libya to the United States.

=== Albania ===
Albania had possession of 16 tons of chemical weapons which were disclosed and disposed of through the Nunn-Lugar program. Nunn-Lugar funds in the year 2004, under the Bush presidency, were provided to eliminate all chemical weapons held within Albania which amounted to roughly $38.5 million. After just 3 years Albania no longer possessed chemical weapons of mass destruction.

=== Pakistan ===
After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, knowledge regarding Pakistani nuclear weaponry and nuclear scientists was unclear making it a strong candidate from American political leaders for Nunn-Lugar. Border crossing between Pakistan and Afghanistan militants made U.S. officials uneasy, this alongside the allegations of nuclear arms smuggling caused further talk of Nunn-Lugar program expansion in 2011. Senator Richard Lugar has expressed his concern regarding Pakistani nuclear weapons of mass destruction along with concerns over potential pathogenic and infectious disease security. Lugar also stated that if an outbreak occurs, if Pakistan accepts transparency with the CTR program, the U.S. will be able to provide aid and establish systems to combat an outbreak.

== Expansion under Obama ==
 
Subsequent programs have built on the CTR, including the Proliferation Security Initiative, initially launched by President Bush in cooperation with Poland in 2003, and built on by multilateral efforts and then by President Obama.

In 2008 the DTRA awarded Black &amp; Veatch the first of its Biological Threat Reduction Integrating Contracts (BTRIC). The five-year IDIQ contract has a collective ceiling of $4 billion among the five selected contractors. DTRA awarded BV the first BTRIC in Ukraine in 2008, which &quot;is a vital part&quot; of the CTR, entitled Biological Threat Reduction (BTR). The Implementing (Executive) Agents were three in number: the Ukraine Ministry of Health, Ukraine Academy of Agrarian Sciences and Ukraine State Committee for Veterinary Medicine.

In July 2008 President Medvedev signed the ratification law to cooperate in &quot;the elimination of reduced strategic offensive weapons, improving the safety of storing and transporting nuclear weapons, improving the physical protection of nuclear materials and the destruction of chemical weapons,&quot; retroactive to the signature of the protocol on 16 June 2006 for a term of seven years.

In May 2009, Russia announced the opening of a major facility to decommission its chemical weapons reserves. Built near vast reserves of ex-Soviet weaponry at Shchuchye, Kurgan Oblast, in the Ural Mountains, the site is expected to destroy some 5,500 tons of chemical agents, including Sarin and VX. About one-third of the funding to build the plant, roughly $1 billion, was provided by CTR.

Although the budget for the CTR program has been cut every year since the Obama administration began, the US still faces many issues when it comes to agreements with Russia in nuclear arms reduction. President Obama had his own ideas for nuclear threat reduction. He and Hillary Clinton tried to reset nuclear relations with Russia. This plan included a plan to further reduce U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals, which would further reduce the number of nuclear weapons in the world today. This plan was the result of the impending expiration of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I). START was set to expire in December 2009.

In October 2012 the second Putin administration declared that Russia would not extend the CTR agreement without changes in the text.

On 14 June 2013 the US and Russia signed a new bilateral framework on cooperative threat reduction intended to supersede the first CTR. The new agreement was intended to reinforce the longstanding partnership on nonproliferation between these two nations and their activities in Russia and the Former Soviet Republics (FSR). &quot;This new framework builds upon the success of the 1992 Agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation Concerning the Safe and Secure Transportation, Storage and Destruction of Weapons and the Prevention of Weapons Proliferation, commonly known as the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Umbrella Agreement that expires today. This new bilateral framework authorizes the United States and the Russian Federation to work in several areas of nonproliferation collaboration, including protecting, controlling, and accounting for nuclear materials.&quot; Under the new framework, Russia assumed the costs and the completion without further US assistance of two areas of bilateral CTR cooperation previously covered by the CTR framework: ballistic missile elimination and chemical weapons destruction.

In Obama&#x27;s second term, work on nuclear threat reduction was said to be more bleak because of the Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. &quot;Arms Control Today&quot; opined that &quot;the crisis in Ukraine probably has ruined prospects for another formal Russian-U.S. arms control agreement during the Obama administration&#x27;s second term.&quot; As far as reducing nuclear weapons in other countries, besides Ukraine, there is more of a chance of an agreement. This idea is explained in &quot;countering nuclear weapons proliferation to states and to nonstate actors, the prospects are somewhat better, given mutual Russian and U.S. concerns in that area&quot;. There are still many agreements that have been proposed that can be passed between the US and Russia as far as nuclear weapons and the control and elimination of them are concerned. As time progresses, the threat of nuclear weapons and the money needed to spend on the elimination of them diminishes. The CTR program has faced many budget cuts since its beginning in 1986 because the program was, as opined by one observer, &quot;created to deal with yesterday&#x27;s strategic weapons and yesterday&#x27;s threats have largely diminished&quot;.

In January 2015 Russian Federation representatives told their US counterparts that Russia would no longer accept US assistance in securing stored weapons-grade nuclear material but said they would continue the program on their own. Joint security work at numerous Russian sites and facilities was halted on 1 January 2015.

In December 2014, the program awarded a $4 million contract to MRIGlobal to &quot;configure, equip, deploy and staff two quick response mobile laboratory systems (MLS) to support the ongoing Ebola outbreak in West Africa.&quot; The labs were deployed to Sierra Leone.

== Future plans ==
In 2018, David Franz and Libby Turpen co-chaired the National Academy of Sciences Committee on International Security and Arms Control to discuss the next ten years regarding the CTR program. The committee found that the Cooperative, or &quot;C&quot;, in CTR was found to be central in reducing threats through transparency and action further strengthening world relations while mitigating dangers to the U.S. Sustainable partnerships between new and existing countries under the CTR is fundamental to the threat reduction program. The committee found the CTR program in 2018 still to be &quot;foundational&quot; in U.S. safety from WMD, even 30 years after the birth of the program.

<text>The Swingers were a New Zealand rock band who were together from 1979 to 1982 and whose biggest single was the song &quot;Counting the Beat&quot;.

==Background==
Formed out of the remnants of the Suburban Reptiles, the founding members were Phil Judd (guitar, vocals), Wayne Stevens ( Bones Hillman) (bass), and Mark Hough (a.k.a. Buster Stiggs) (drums). Formed in 1979, the band released the single &quot;One Good Reason&quot;, which was a top 20 hit in New Zealand. They also appeared on the Ripper Records sampler &quot;AK79&quot; and established a large live following after a residency at Auckland&#x27;s Liberty Stage club.

In 1980 the band moved to Australia and signed to Mushroom Records for that country, although their New Zealand releases remained on Ripper.

==Success==
After some band dissension, Ian Gilroy of the Crocodiles replaced Hough on drums. The band released the single &quot;Counting the Beat&quot;, which became a No. 1 hit in Australia and New Zealand. A second single released in 1981, &quot;It Ain&#x27;t What You Dance, It&#x27;s the Way That You Dance It&quot; (which had the outro repeat line &quot;oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah&quot;), was also a Top 5 hit in New Zealand but only a minor hit in Australia (reaching #43). An album, &quot;Practical Jokers&quot;, produced by David Tickle, was released. The band also performed songs in the film &quot;Starstruck&quot;.

==Breakup==
The band underwent a couple more line-up changes, including the addition of Pop Mechanix and Coconut Rough vocalist Andrew Snoid, before it split up in March 1982. Phil Judd went on to pursue a solo career.

<text>The South Seas Communist Party (SSCP), also known as the Nanyang Communist Party (), was a communist party in Southeast Asia established in 1925 when the Communist Party of China dissolved its overseas branches in Nanyang to make way for the creation of local communist parties. The SSCP succeeded earlier efforts by the Indonesian communist Tan Malaka to establish communist parties in the region.

The SSCP was headquartered in Singapore. The SSCP disbanded in 1930, and national communist parties were formed, such as the Communist Party of Indochina (led by Ho Chi Minh), Malayan Communist Party and Communist Party of Siam.

==South Seas Communist Party in Burma==
A minor branch of the South Seas Communist Party was formed in Burma. The group was formed by Wu Wei Sai (alias Wu Ching Sin), who had arrived to Rangoon in May 1929. Along with his wife he conducted propaganda activities in the Rangoon Chinatown. A small group of followers was formed, but largely the establishment of a Chinese communist movement in Burma failed as the Chinese community in Burma was dominated by middle-class elements. Rangoon had relatively few Chinese labourers. Wu Wei Sai left Burma in 1930. The group that remained, the Provisional Committee, Special Division, Burma of the South Seas Communist Party, had only a handful members. Some were deported to China by the British authorities.

<doc id="905277" wikidata="Q7728141" url="?curid=905277" title="The Crocodiles">
<text>The Crocodiles were a New Zealand pop/new wave band formed in 1979 with lead singer Jenny Morris, who went on to commercial success as a solo artist in Australia; and later included drummer Barton Price, who subsequently joined Sardine v and then Models. The Crocodiles&#x27; top 20 hit single in New Zealand was &quot;Tears&quot; in 1980 from debut album &quot;Tears&quot;; a second album, &quot;Looking at Ourselves&quot;, appeared in November. The band relocated to Australia in February 1981 but disbanded in July without further releases.

==History==
Fane Flaws was guitarist and Bruno Lawrence was drummer for Blerta (1971–1975); Flaws and Lawrence then went on to form the Spats (1977–1979) with Tony Backhouse on guitar and Peter Dasent on keyboards. In 1978, an all-female band, the Wide Mouthed Frogs, comprising Jenny Morris and Kate Brockie (lead vocals), Tina Matthews (bass guitarist), Andrea Gilkison (guitar), Bronwyn Murray (keyboards) and Sally Zwartz (drums) was established in Wellington, New Zealand, Lawrence played saxophone for the band at a number of their performances, and Dasent was the musical director for the band.

The Crocodiles evolved from the Spats, under the mentorship of US producer Kim Fowley, and were founded in 1979 in Auckland with Backhouse, Dasent, Flaws, Lawrence and Mark Hornibrook on bass guitar and songwriter Arthur Baysting. The lineup was finalised with Morris joining as lead singer. They were managed by Mike Chunn (ex-Split Enz), Mark Hornibrook was subsequently replaced by Mathews.

In April 1980, they released their debut album &quot;Tears&quot; (produced by Glyn Tucker), together with the single, &quot;Tears&quot;. The album and the single both reached No. 17 on the New Zealand album and singles charts respectively that year. The band&#x27;s second single, &quot;Whatcha Gonna Do&quot;, however wasn&#x27;t as successful, failing to chart. That year, they won Best Group and Most Promising Group at the New Zealand Music Awards. Lawrence then left the band and was replaced by Ian Gilroy (the Whizz Kids); Flaws also left the group but continued to provide material for the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Looking at Ourselves&quot; (produced by Ian Morris), which was released in November 1980 but failed to chart. In December 1980, Gilroy left to join the Swingers, with Dasent and Mathews leaving soon afterwards. A new lineup was formed with original members Morris and Backhouse joined by Barton Price (drums), Jonathan Swartz (bass) and Rick Morris (guitar).

In February 1981, the band flew to Australia but did not last long before dissolving; Morris beginning her solo career, Price joining Sardine v and then Models, with Backhouse becoming a session musician with artists including Renée Geyer, Joe Walsh, Jenny Morris, Dave Dobbyn, Tim Finn and Vince Jones and immersing himself in a cappella gospel music. Dasent became a film composer, and Flaws became a successful video and film director.

==Nanotechnology in schools==
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in introducing nanoscience and nanotechnology in grade schools, especially at the high school level. In the United States, although very few high schools officially offer a two-semester course in nanotechnology, “nano” concepts are bootstrapped and taught during traditional science classes using a number of educational resources and hands-on activities developed by dedicated non-profit organizations, such as:
* The National Science Teacher Association, which has published a number of textbooks for nanotechnology in K-12 education, including a teacher&#x27;s guide and an activity manual for hands-on experiences. 
* Nano-Link, a notable program of the Dakota County Technical College, which has developed a variety of nanotech-related hands-on activities supported by toolkits to teach concepts in nanotechnology throughout direct lab experience.
* Omni Nano, which is developing comprehensive educational resources specifically designed to support a two-semester high school course, both online and in classrooms. Omni Nano also discusses issues in nanotechnology education on its dedicated blog. 
* Nano4Me, which has a good amount of resources for K-12 education, although their program is intended for higher education. Their K-12 resources include introductory level modules and activities, interactive multimedia, and a collection of experiments and hands-on activities. 
* Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network (NISE), which has a website of educational products designed to engage the public in nano science, engineering, and technology. NISE also organizes Nano Days, a nationwide festival of educational programs about nanoscale science and engineering and its potential impact on the future.

In Egypt, in2nano is a high school outreach program aiming to increase scientific literacy and prepare students for the sweeping changes of nanotechnology.

==Nanotechnology education outside of school==

== History ==

MCAD was founded in 1886 by the trustees of the Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts and originally named the Minneapolis School of Fine Arts. Douglas Volk (1856–1935), an accomplished American portrait painter who studied in Paris with renowned French painter and sculptor Jean-Léon Gérôme (1824–1904), became the school&#x27;s first president. Its inaugural class was held in a rented apartment in downtown Minneapolis and had an enrollment of 28 students, 26 of whom were women.
In December 1889, the school found a more permanent home on the top floor of the just-finished Minneapolis Public Library at 10th Street and Hennepin Avenue. In 1893, noted German-born painter and educator Robert Koehler (1850–1917) moved from New York to Minnesota to become president of the school. Over the next ten years, he developed much of the curriculum that is known today as the art education field. By the turn of the century, the school had two instructors and had instituted a summer term, in addition to night classes for people in the community. In 1910, the School of Fine Arts changed its name to the Minneapolis School of Art to reflect the new emphasis on applied arts.

In 1915, the school moved to its present location one mile south of downtown Minneapolis, and set up its classrooms and studios within the newly constructed Minneapolis Institute of Arts. The site for the art museum and school was donated to the City of Minneapolis in 1911 by prominent local banker and businessman Clinton Morrison (1842–1913). It was formerly occupied by Villa Rosa, the home and estate of Morrison&#x27;s parents Dorilus Morrison (1814–1897), the first mayor of Minneapolis, and Harriet Putnam Whitmore Morrison (1821–1880). The site of the Morrison&#x27;s former estate is today held in the public trust under the jurisdiction of the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board and is officially known as Dorilus Morrison Park.

In 1916, the school moved into its own nearby facilities in the new Julia Morrison Memorial Building, which was built with funds provided to the Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts by Angus Washburn Morrison (1883–1949) and his sister, Ethel Morrison Van Derlip (1876–1921), as a memorial to their mother, Julia Kellogg Washburn Morrison (1853–1883), the wife of Clinton Morrison. Designed by prominent Minneapolis architect Edwin Hawley Hewitt (1874–1939), a former Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts president, the Morrison Building featured three large painting studios with skylights, administrative offices, workshops and an auditorium.

In 1970, the School was renamed the Minneapolis College of Art and Design to reflect the broadening of its fine arts and liberal arts curricula. By this time, with enrollment of nearly 600 students, the college had outgrown its facilities, and in 1974 expanded into a building designed by Pritzker Prize–winning modernist architect Kenzo Tange (1913–2005) as part of the new &quot;arts complex&quot; that included the Children&#x27;s Theatre Company and a major addition to the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.

On July 1, 1988, MCAD became a wholly independent institution, no longer governed by the Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts.

On October 19, 2016, the Full-time and Adjunct faculty unionized joining the Service Employees International Union Local 284.

== Academics ==

MCAD offers several degree programs: Bachelor of Fine Arts, Bachelor of Science, Master of Arts, and Master of Fine Arts.

== Campus ==

MCAD is located at 2501 Stevens Avenue, just south of downtown Minneapolis. It shares an eighteen-acre arts campus with the Minneapolis Institute of Art and the Children&#x27;s Theatre Company. The MCAD campus consists of eight buildings and three acres of lawns and gardens.

MCAD offers shared, furnished student apartments for on-campus living with floor plans for two, four, or six person living across eight buildings.

The Minneapolis Japanese School, a weekend Japanese educational program designated by the Japanese Ministry of Education, previously held its classes at MCAD.

==Galleries==
MCAD operates one main gallery space, a gallery on the concourse, an outdoor sculpture garden, and the student-run Gallery 148. The college hosts contemporary art and design exhibitions, receptions, artist talks, and other events that are free and open to the public.

<doc id="905299" wikidata="Q993459" url="?curid=905299" title="Bruno Lawrence">
<text>David Charles Lawrence (12 February 194110 June 1995) known as Bruno Lawrence was an English-born New Zealand musician and actor, who was active in the industry in New Zealand and Australia.

Initially notable as a musician and founder of 1970s ensemble Blerta, he went on to well-regarded roles in several major films. His television work included starring in 1990s era Australian satirical series &quot;Frontline&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Worthing, West Sussex, England in February 1941 he moved with his family to New Zealand in 1946. The family settled in New Plymouth before relocating to Wellington in 1948.

== Music career==
Lawrence spent most of his life in New Zealand, but also worked extensively in Australia. He was a jazz and rock drummer in many bands, including two years with Max Merritt &amp; The Meteors in Sydney, Quincy Conserve, Blerta, and The Crocodiles. His last recording was with Bernie McGann, Larry Gales and Jonathan Crayford on &quot;Jazz at the St. James&quot; in 1989. A remarkable show, it was repeated in 1990, this time with Vince Jones on vocals, Dave Addis on saxophone, Jonathan Crayford on piano, Rolf Stube on bass and added the New Zealand String Quartet.

In the early 1970s, Lawrence founded Blerta (&quot;Bruno Lawrence&#x27;s Electric Revelation and Travelling Apparition&quot;). The multi and theatrical co-operative toured New Zealand and in parts of Australia. Blerta saw him performing alongside many people he would work with later as an actor, including director Geoff Murphy, and actors Martyn Sanderson and Ian Watkin.

==Acting roles==
Lawrence began acting in short films in the late 1960s. He won his first acting award, for television play &quot;Time Out&quot;, in 1971, although at this point music took up the majority of his time. By the late 1980s he had become one of New Zealand&#x27;s most recognised actors on his own soil. Between 1981 and 1986 he was a much loved feature of many local films; he continued to act in occasional NZ productions through until 1993.

Lawrence&#x27;s breakthrough movie role was relationship drama &quot;Smash Palace&quot; (1981). Playing the former race car driver who leaves with his daughter after the breakdown of his marriage, Bruno won an award at the Manila Film Festival, and acclaim from American critic Pauline Kael. Further acclaim came with his leading role as the lone scientist in Geoff Murphy&#x27;s end-of-the-world tale, &quot;The Quiet Earth&quot; (1985), for which Bruno also helped write the script. He had earlier acted in Murphy&#x27;s &quot;Utu&quot; (1983), about the New Zealand Wars of the 1860s, and cameoed in his breakthrough film &quot;Goodbye Pork Pie&quot; (1981). The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; compared his work in 1984 drama &quot;Heart of the Stag&quot; to that of &quot;a young Brando&quot;.

Bruno&#x27;s Australian roles included Anthony Hopkins movie &quot;Spotswood &quot;(aka &quot;The Efficiency Expert&quot;), Colleen McCullough adaptation&quot; An Indecent Obsession&quot; (playing a blind man), and 1986 miniseries &quot;The Great Bookie Robbery &quot;(playing gun-loving robber Cracka Park). In 1990, he portrayed John Peterson in the film, &quot;The Rogue Stallion&quot;. His last and, at least in Australia, best-known screen role was as devious, golf-loving TV producer Brian Thompson in 1990s satirical TV series &quot;Frontline&quot;.

==Death==
In 1994 while enjoying the success of the Australian television series &quot;Frontline&quot;, Lawrence was diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. He died in Wellington, New Zealand, on 10 June 1995 at the age of 54.

A biography, &quot;Bruno: The Bruno Lawrence Story&quot; by Roger Booth, and television documentary &quot;Numero Bruno&quot; (2000, directed by Steve La Hood), cover his life and work. Lawrence is also featured in compilation documentary &quot;Blerta Revisited&quot; (2001, directed by Geoff Murphy).

<doc id="905300" wikidata="Q1663776" url="?curid=905300" title="ICA Gruppen">
<text>ICA Gruppen [[Aktiebolag|AB]] (; &quot;ICA Group&quot;; from &quot;Inköpscentralernas aktiebolag&quot;, ) is a Swedish retailer franchise with a focus on food and health. The group also owns a bank, real estate division and a pharmacy chain.

The company was started in 1938, based on a business model which was introduced by Hakonbolagen in 1917. Most of its operations are based in Sweden and the Baltic countries.

The company was owned by the participating retailers until 2000 when half of the company was sold to the Dutch retailer Ahold. It acquired a further 10% in 2004. Ahold is prevented by contractual obligation from exercising majority control over ICA. In February 2013, Ahold sold its shares to Hakon Invest for $3.1bn. In May 2013, the company changed name from Hakon Invest AB to ICA Gruppen AB.

In November 2021, ICA-handlarnas Förbund together with AMF Pensionsförsäkring AB announced a public offer to acquire all shares of ICA Gruppen. In December 2021, they held more than 90 % of all shares and the company was delisted from the Nasdaq Stockholm stock exchange on 13 January 2022.

==Sweden==


In Sweden, ICA Sverige AB operates close to 1,300 retail stores (as of February 2025). The stores have different profiles, depending on location, range of products and size:
*ICA Nära (&quot;ICA Nearby&quot;) — Convenience-type stores for daily retail needs.
*ICA Supermarket — Mid-size supermarkets, located near where customers dwell or work or near major roads, carrying a wide range of products.
*ICA Kvantum — Superstores for large, planned purchases. Large spaces allocated for traffic and parking. Typically located outside of the cities.
*MAXI ICA Stormarknad — Hypermarkets with a full range of groceries as well as fashions, homewares, entertainment and consumer electronics. Smaller stores do not offer the fashion and electronics ranges, while the largest stores also have a DIY and gardening department.

Each store is owned and operated separately, but operations are coordinated within the group. All feature ICA brand products. ICA has its two largest logistics centers in Västerås and Helsingborg.

Since December 2001, ICA has run a series of television commercials featuring the staff and customers of a fictional ICA store. As of Mid January 2015 512 commercials have aired. Since 2007 it is listed at the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the longest running television advertising drama.

In 2021, ICA opened its first automated online groceries warehouse in Brunna, outside Stockholm, to deliver groceries to customers. The warehouse uses technology powered by Ocado Group.

===ICA meat repackaging controversy===

In December 2007, a meat repackaging fraud scheme was revealed when a whistleblower spoke to Sveriges Television&#x27;s flagship investigative programme &quot;Uppdrag granskning&quot;. Hans Hallén, a former quality control manager for the supermarket chain, revealed that the company was aware that meat was being illegally repackaged as early as 2003. Hallén, who monitored ICA stores in southern Sweden 2003–2005, said he informed the company&#x27;s managers of the practices. According to Hallén, many stores engaged in practices such as repackaging meat to change the expiry date.

=== ICA Offers ===
ICA Sweden&#x27;s industries have a large number of stores, and a website, in which weekly offers are available for customers to get discounts on goods purchased online or in physical stores. Many can also offer some extra items specific to the store, depending on their own policy.

==Rimi Baltic ==
ICA&#x27;s wholly owned subsidiary Rimi Baltic operates discount stores, supermarkets and hypermarkets across Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. As of February 2025, Rimi Baltic has about 300 stores in the Baltic countries.

==Apotek Hjärtat==
ICA Gruppen owns the pharmacy shop chain &quot;Apotek Hjärtat&quot;, which ICA acquired in 2015. As of February 2025, Apotek Hjärtat has close to 400 shops in Sweden.

==ICA Bank==

ICA Bank operates in Sweden and has agency agreements with nearly all ICA stores in the country. The basic idea is to reduce banking costs for the shops own business, offer banking services that build loyalty among ICA&#x27;s customers, as well as to increase the share of store transactions executed with ICA&#x27;s own cards instead of more expensive cards from other banks. Sales amounted to about 3 billion SEK in 2024.

==ICA Real Estate==
ICA Real Estate&#x27;s mission is to satisfy the ICA Gruppen&#x27;s need for the right properties in the right locations in Sweden. This is currently done by owning, renting and strategically developing marketplaces. ICA Real Estate has about 200 properties, wholly owned or through joint ventures (as of the 2024 annual report).

==History==
===Statoil===
Until the mid-1990s, Statoil and ICA jointly operated Statoil Detaljhandel AB (Statoil Retail Ltd) which ran approximately 1,300 petrol stations in Scandinavia, many branded under the name ICA Express. ICA has since sold its 50 percent share of the business back to Statoil and the ICA name was removed from the petrol stations during 2007.

===Denmark===
ICA previously had a 50 percent stake in the ISO chain of supermarkets in the Copenhagen region, Denmark. In 2004, ICA sold its entire holding in ISO.

===Netto Sweden===
The Swedish operation of Danish supermarket chain Netto was founded in 2002 as a joint venture between Dansk Supermarked and ICA. The joint venture was named Netto Marknad AB. At the end of 2006, ICA announced it was pulling out of the joint venture, reducing its stake from 50 to 5 percent. Twenty-one of the Netto stores in the Stockholm and Västmanland regions were transferred to ICA&#x27;s ownership and rebranded to ICA&#x27;s own formats or closed during 2007.

===Norway===
ICA Norge AS ran about 600 stores in Norway as of 2009. Store sales were at approximately 21 billion SEK (excluding VAT). Formerly known as Hakongruppen and owned by Stein Erik Hagen, it operated solely RIMI discount stores until ICA bought the chain, and transformed many of the stores to the ICA brand. ICA Norway was divided into four different stores:
* Matkroken
* ICA Nær (closed 2014)
* ICA Supermarked (closed 2015/2016) 
* ICA Maxi (closed 2012)
* RIMI (a chain of food stores)
In 2014 ICA Norge was sold to Coop Norge and all stores, except for the Matkroken chain, were rebranded into Coop stores, mainly Coop Extra and Coop Prix. 93 stores had to be sold to competitors due to demands from the Norwegian Competition Authority.

===Hemtex===
In 2009, the Swedish home textile retail chain Hemtex became a partly-owned subsidiary of ICA Gruppen (Hakon Invest). In 2015, ICA Gruppen acquired the remaining shares of Hemtex and it became a wholly-owned subsidiary. In 2019, Hemtex was sold to Norwegian home textile chain Kid ASA.

<text>The Medical University of Białystok (UMB; Polish: &quot;Uniwersytet Medyczny w Białymstoku&quot;) is a medical university located in Białystok, the capital of Podlaskie Voivodeship in northeastern Poland. 

The university is home to the Medical Department with a Division of Dentistry and a six-year M.D. program taught in English (English Division), Pharmacology Department with Medical Analytics Division, and a Nursing and Health Protection Department with divisions in Physiotherapy, Medical Rescue, Obstetrics, Public Health and Nursing.

==History==

The official application for the establishment of the Medical Academy in the Białystok was submitted by Chairman of the Voivodeship National Council in Białystok, Mieczysław Tureniec at the meeting of that body, on July 21, 1949. He argued as follows: 

The Medical University of Białystok was created in accordance with an order of the Council of Ministers signed on February 3, 1950. The initial activities for establishing the university occurred at the beginning of 1949. The founding father of the university was Dr. Jerzy Sztachelski and Professor Tadeusz Kielanowski presided as the first rector.

The main seat of the Medical University of Białystok was (and is still) in the 18th century Branicki Palace, the most magnificent and precious historic structure in Białystok. The first theoretical science departments were housed adjacent to the palace in Collegium Primum. In the second year of existence the university obtained the right to confer scientific degrees. In 1953, the first clinical departments were created, and in 1954, Collegium Universum was built to house the majority of the theoretical science departments. In 1955, the academic journal, &quot;Annals of the Medical University of Białystok&quot;, was issued for the first time and is still being published today. In 1956, another academic journal, &quot;Medyk Białostocki&quot;, was briefly published before it prematurely discontinued. In 2000, the decision to resume publication of the &quot;Medyk Białostocki&quot; was made.

The State Teaching Hospital of the Medical University of Białystok was opened in 1962 and in 1968 the Division of Dentistry was created. In 1977, the Faculty of Pharmacy with the Division of Medical Analytics was established; there was no initial recruitment until 1987, when the first group of students began their studies at the Faculty of Pharmacy with the Division of Medical Analytics. In 1982, Collegium Pathologicum was opened and the Children&#x27;s Teaching Hospital began admitting patients in 1988. In 1999, Collegium Novum was opened, with the Division of Nursing also created that same year. In 2004, the English Division was created and the inaugural class of the English-language six-year M.D. program began their studies in 2005.

The UMB Choir won 2 gold medals, in the Sacred Music and Contemporary Music categories, at the 2019 &#x27;Mundi Cantat&#x27; International Choir Competition in Olomouc, Czech Republic.

The Students’ Scientific Society is an organization of medical students and interns engaged in the work of Students’ Scientific Circles operating in almost all departments of the university. They carry out laboratory experiments, conduct clinical research and acquire practical skills. Some of the students are co-authors of publications in Polish and foreign professional journals. The Polish Dental Students Association was founded in 1997 in Wroclaw. The main goal of the association is to create the structures that represent dentistry students and look after their business in different areas.

In the spring semester of 2018, the American Medical Student Association - Białystok Chapter (AMSA Białystok) was established at the Medical University of Białystok.

<doc id="905306" wikidata="Q4039068" url="?curid=905306" title="Furious Angels">
<text>Furious Angels is the debut and as of 2024, the only studio album by Australian music producer Rob Dougan. It was released on 1 July 2002 in the United Kingdom and in July 2003 in the United States. It was nominated for the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package.

==Release==
&quot;Furious Angels&quot; was originally released as a single-disc album (14 tracks for its world edition, 15 for its home UK edition) dominated by vocal tracks. It was then rereleased as a two-disc album, disc one featuring all 15 songs and disc two featuring 10 instrumental versions of the vocal songs from the first disc, as well as two music videos; there&#x27;s also been a special-edition set adding a booklet of lyrics and photographs. The album was written, produced and mainly financed by Rob Dougan himself, rather than a studio, with funds generally raised through the licensing of tracks from the album to film and television.

A 2003 article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted:

==Track listing==

===Disc one===
===Disc two (instrumental)===
==Influences==
The introduction to &quot;Clubbed to Death&quot; is taken directly from the main theme of Edward Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Enigma Variations&quot;. The piano introduction to &quot;I&#x27;m Not Driving Anymore&quot; and the orchestral part of &quot;Clubbed to Death 2&quot; (only on the UK version of the album) is built around Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s &quot;Prelude No. 4 in E-minor&quot; (from &quot;Preludes, opus 28&quot;). The &quot;Instrumental&quot; and the orchestral part of &quot;One And The Same&quot; are variations of Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s &quot;Concerto for 2 Violins in D Minor, BWV1043&quot;.

==Song usage==
Some tracks from the album have been licensed for use in feature films, advertising, and television, including the &quot;Matrix&quot; film series and the &quot;Top Gear&quot; television show. The song &quot;Furious Angels&quot; is used by the Los Angeles Lakers to introduce visiting teams. The instrumental version of this song also appears in the opening sequence of the video game &quot;Grand Prix 3&quot;. Several shows in the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; franchise have used tracks from &quot;Furious Angels&quot; as an opening credits theme for UK airings: &quot;I&#x27;m Not Driving Anymore&quot; was used by &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, and &quot;There&#x27;s Only Me&quot; was used by &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;.

The album&#x27;s lyrical themes cover a variety of social and political topics, including misogyny/sexism (&quot;It&#x27;s a M.A.N.S World&quot; and &quot;Inconceivable?&quot;), animal rights (&quot;Display to Me…&quot;), racism (&quot;Unchallenged Hate&quot; and &quot;From Enslavement to Obliteration&quot;), materialism (&quot;Private Death&quot;), and anti-capitalism (&quot;Make Way!&quot;). The album calls for social change, as seen in the song &quot;Uncertainty Blurs the Vision,&quot; quoting Rudimentary Peni at the song&#x27;s conclusion.

Shane Embury retrospectively commented on the band&#x27;s progression up until &quot;From Enslavement to Obliteration&quot; in &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine: 

==Reception==
In 2009 &quot;From Enslavement to Obliteration&quot; was ranked number 1 in &quot;Terrorizer&quot;&#x27;s list of essential European grindcore albums. Writer Jonathan Horsley described it as marking &quot;the genre&#x27;s perilous rite of passage through Britain&#x27;s post-industrial urban landscape.&quot; &quot;Classic Rock&quot; reviewer remarked how the stable line-up brought &quot;new maturity and coherence&quot; and reminded that &quot;for an all-too-brief moment in time, this album could lay claim to being the most extreme collection of songs ever recorded&quot;.

In 2017, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;From Enslavement to Obliteration&quot; as 59th on their list of &#x27;The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time.&#x27;

<text>Dominique Margaux Dawes (born November 20, 1976) is a retired American artistic gymnast. Known in the gymnastics community as &#x27;Awesome Dawesome&#x27;, she was a 10-year member of the U.S. national gymnastics team, the 1994 U.S. all-around senior National Champion, a three-time Olympian, a World Championship silver and bronze medalist, and a member of the gold-medal-winning &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot; team at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. She is also the Olympic bronze medalist on floor exercise from the Atlanta games.

She is also one of only four female American gymnasts, along with Muriel Grossfeld, Linda Metheny-Mulvihill, and Simone Biles, to compete in three Olympics and was part of their medal-winning teams: Barcelona 1992 (bronze), Atlanta 1996 (gold), and Sydney 2000 (bronze). Dawes is the first female gymnast to be a part of three Olympic-medal-winning teams since Ludmilla Tourischeva won gold in Mexico City (1968), Munich (1972), and Montreal (1976). Since Dawes, Svetlana Khorkina and Simone Biles are the only gymnasts to accomplish this feat. Svetlana winning silver in Atlanta (1996) and Sydney (2000), and bronze in Athens (2004) and Simone winning gold in Rio (2016), silver in Tokyo (2020) and gold in Paris (2024).

==Early life==
Dawes was born in Silver Spring, Maryland, on November 20, 1976, to Don and Loretta Dawes of Takoma Park, Maryland. She enrolled in gymnastics at age 6 with coach Kelli Hill and won her first competition at age 9. In high school, she moved to Gaithersburg, Maryland, to be closer to her coach&#x27;s gym.

==Gymnastics career==

===Junior career===
Dawes was competing as a junior elite by the age of 10. She placed 17th in the all-around junior division at her first U.S. National Championships in 1988. In 1989, at the age of 12, she was sent to Australia to compete in her first international meet, the Konica Grand Prix. By the early 1990s, Dawes was achieving success both nationally and internationally. She placed 3rd in the all-around in the junior division at the 1990 U.S. National Championships.

At the 1992 USA vs. Japan dual meet, the 15-year-old Dawes received a standing ovation, after an energetic floor routine in which she revived the back-to-back tumbling revolutionized by Soviet star Oksana Omelianchik. The judges were equally impressed, and gave her a perfect 10. Though she was not part of the 1991 World Championship team, Dawes continued to move up on the national and international scene throughout 1991 and 1992.

===1992–1995===
She placed 4th at the 1992 Olympic trials and was awarded a place on the United States Olympic team. Despite battling very painful tendinitis in both ankles and Osgood-Schlatter disease during pre-Olympic training, Dawes performed respectably throughout the competition, even having the boldness to try a brand-new move in her balance beam routine during team competition - back handspring to three layout stepouts. She also won over the crowd with a solid optional floor exercise routine and, with a mark of 9.925, tied with Kim Zmeskal for the highest score for the American team on the event. The team won bronze, and Dawes and teammate Betty Okino became the first African American females to win an Olympic medal in gymnastics.

Dawes only competed in the team competition in 1992, not breaking through as an all-around gymnast until 1993. She is probably best known for her performances at the 1993 and 1994 World Championships. In 1993, Dawes led the competition after three events, even beating her more famous teammate Shannon Miller. However, she decided to try her harder vault (1½ twisting layout Yurchenko) worth a 10.00 instead of simply a full-twisting layout Yurchenko, which had been devalued to a 9.8. She made the first vault, but slipped and fell on the second, immediately bursting into tears. With the new rule that both vaults were averaged in all-around competition, her fall dropped her to 4th overall while Miller won the title. Famously, after the vault fall Dawes&#x27;s coach Kelli Hill exhorted her to be proud of her performance anyway, stating: &quot;When did you ever think you would be in that position? You have to be happy with yourself. Come on. Be happy. Stand up and wave&quot;. Dawes did so and earned a standing ovation from the crowd. After this disappointment she rebounded in the event finals, winning two silver medals on bars and beam.

The same fate befell her in at the 1994 Worlds. Leading after three events, she again came to vault with a chance of winning the title. This time her mistake came on the first vault where Dawes over-rotated and hurled forward into a somersault. Her low score dropped her to 5th. Her mistakes continued throughout the event finals and left the championships without winning a single medal.

Dawes would finish her year on a positive note, however. She dominated the National Championships placing first in the all-around and all four event finals at the expense of rival Shannon Miller. It was the first year since 1969 that a gymnast had swept the competition. She went on to lead the American team to a silver medal at the World Team Championships in Dortmund, Germany posting the third highest all-around score in the process.

===1996===
Dawes struggled through a difficult 1995 riddled by wrist and ankle injuries. She finished fourth at nationals and was forced to sit out the World Championships that year. At the 1996 World Championships, Dawes missed out on a medal on the uneven bars but tied Liu Xuan for a bronze medal on the balance beam. At the 1996 U.S. National Championships Dawes swept all four event finals for the second time in her career making her the first gymnast ever to accomplish this feat twice. Dawes also finished first at the Olympic trials, earning a berth on the 1996 Olympic team at the age of 19. Dawes planned to attend Stanford University in fall 1995 but could not receive an athletic scholarship as she turned pro to train for the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympics.

===1996 Olympic Games===
The team, later nicknamed Magnificent Seven, dominated the team competition. A key member of the team, Dawes performed without serious error and was the only team member to have all eight of her scores count towards the total. Along with Shannon Miller, Jaycie Phelps, Dominique Moceanu, Amanda Borden, Amy Chow and Kerri Strug, Dawes claimed her gold medal as part of the first American team to take the Olympic title.

Later in the week, however, Dawes lost yet another opportunity to win a major all-around title. Going into the competition, she was considered one of the heavy favorites to medal. She was ranked sixth overall among all competitors after the team event, and her scores from team optionals were the highest on the American team and the second highest overall. Dawes led the competition after two rotations, with Shannon Miller right behind her. Both gymnasts were on Floor Exercise for the 3rd rotation. Miller had a substantial mistake in her routine, knocking her out of the medals. On the middle tumbling pass of Dawes&#x27;s floor routine, she under-rotated for fear that she might step out of bounds; she sat down the tumbling pass (and went out of bounds anyway) causing her position to plummet in the standings. NBC cameras zoomed in on Dawes, sitting in tears as her score from floor exercise was announced (it was an even 9.000), which led to numerous boos from the audience. She managed to pull out a decent Vault score, but finished 17th overall. In the Event Finals, she placed sixth on Vault and just out of the medals on Uneven Bars, but redeemed herself by winning Bronze in Floor Exercise finals, her first World Championship or Olympic medal in what had long been considered her best event.

===2000 Olympics===
Between 1996 and 1998 Dawes competed in various professional meets but retreated from elite competition. She returned briefly in 1998 to participate in the Goodwill Games where she placed 19th in the Mixed Pairs event with Chainey Umphrey. However, she placed 9th all-around at 2000 U.S. Nationals and 7th at the Olympic Trials, and earned a spot on her third Olympic team.

In team preliminaries at the Sydney Olympics, Dawes posted the second highest score of the American team on uneven bars but the lowest on beam. In the team finals, she performed well on three events, contributing their highest beam score and 3rd highest bars score (a very high 9.7), and contributed to the team&#x27;s bronze medal awarded April 28, 2010 when the International Olympic Committee stripped China of its 2000 team medal for an underage competitor.

==Education and life after gymnastics==
Dawes attended Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, Maryland and Gaithersburg High School in Gaithersburg, Maryland, where she was the 1994 prom queen. She graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Maryland, College Park in 2002.
Pursuing a career in acting, modeling, and television production, she has appeared in Prince&#x27;s music video &quot;Betcha By Golly Wow&quot; and Missy Elliott&#x27;s 2006 video &quot;We Run This&quot; in the role of Missy&#x27;s gymnastics coach. Dawes also briefly appeared on Broadway in a revival of the musical &quot;Grease&quot;, playing cheerleader Patty Simcox.
Dawes served as president of the Women&#x27;s Sports Foundation from 2004 to 2006; she was the youngest president in the Foundation&#x27;s history. She was the first spokeswoman for the Girl Scouts of the USA&#x27;s &quot;Uniquely Me&quot; self-esteem campaign in 2002. Dawes, whose younger brother is autistic, has also supported events for autism awareness, such as the 2001 Power of One rally in Washington D.C. She is presently on the Advisory Board of Sesame Workshop&#x27;s &quot;Healthy Habits for Life&quot; program and also works as a motivational speaker, concentrating on youth issues. In June 2010, President Obama appointed Dawes to be co-chair of the newly renamed President&#x27;s Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition, along with New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees.

She provided commentary for Yahoo&#x27;s coverage of the Beijing Olympics in 2008 and for the 2010 Winter Olympics.

On October 28, 2010, Dawes was working for Yahoo Weekend News when she met with Center for Inquiry (CFI)&#x27;s investigative partner IIG to test Power Balance Bracelets for their claim that they improve balance, flexibility and strength. She states &quot;The fact is, all athletes know that nothing can replace good old-fashioned hard work – practice, practice, practice...Can a silicone wristband with a hologram sticker really give you an added edge?&quot; In the trial four bracelets were taped so no participant knew if the bracelet they were wearing contained the Power Balance hologram. One bracelet was the control with no hologram, another contained only a PEZ candy. From Wendy Hughes report &quot;The claim was that if the hologram worked, the speed of the participants would increase, and it would show on the graph. But it didn&#x27;t. Out of 64 heats, 16 participants using 4 bracelets in 4 random heats, the results were almost flat. The main result was that if there was any change, the familiarity with the course caused a slight increase in efficiency. The Pez didn&#x27;t make a difference either.&quot; Dawes&#x27;s conclusion is that superstition makes the Power Bracelet work.

Dawes appeared with gymnasts Nadia Comăneci and Simone Biles in a commercial for Tide called &quot;The Evolution of Power&quot; prior to the 2016 Summer Olympics.

She is set to guest star as herself with Gabby Douglas and Laurie Hernandez in the episode &quot;A Perfect 10&quot; of the second season of the Disney+ animated series &quot;The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder&quot;, judging a gymnastics competition.

<text>The American Literary Translators Association (ALTA) is an organization in the United States dedicated to literary translation. ALTA promotes literary translation through its annual ALTA conference and year-round events structured around the creation of high-quality art. ALTA also administers awards to recognize excellence in translation and provides fellowships and mentorships to support emerging translators. 

==History==

The American Literary Translators Association (ALTA) was co-founded by Rainer Schulte and A. Leslie Willson in 1978 at The University of Texas at Dallas. ALTA&#x27;s own scholarly journal, &quot;Translation Review&quot;, was also founded in 1978 and has been published regularly ever since. The ALTA Annual Conference has convened every year since 1978 in various locations throughout North America. From 1978 until 2014, ALTA was administratively housed at the University of Texas at Dallas. From 2014 to 2018, ALTA functioned as an independent, non-profit arts organization. In 2018, ALTA affiliated with College of Humanities at the University of Arizona, with ALTA relocating to UA in January 2019.

==Annual conference==

The annual ALTA conference is a four-day gathering of professional literary translators, translation students and scholars, publishers of literature in translation, and others interested in the study, practice, and promotion of literary translation. Conference events include: panel presentations on a wide range of topics related to literary translation; roundtable discussions of issues relevant to literary translators, scholars, and publishers; bilingual readings of recently published translations or translations in progress (the Annual Alexis Levitin Bilingual Reading Series); and interactive workshops on translating specific texts. In addition, each conference features keynote presentations by invited speakers; readings by the ALTA Fellows; a book exhibit of recently published literature in translation; announcements of the winners of the annual ALTA book awards; a multilingual performance of translation recitation known as Declamación; and abundant opportunities for connections among translators, students, scholars, and publishers dedicated to fostering literary translation. In recent years, ALTA conference organizers have selected a conference theme to guide panel, workshop, and roundtable proposals in the direction of a broadly defined aspect of literary translation studies. Themes may address geographies, genres, literary elements, or other angles for approaching literary translation theory and practice.

==Awards==

===National Translation Award===

The National Translation Award (NTA) in Poetry and Prose is awarded annually for the book-length translations of fiction, poetry, drama, or creative non-fiction that, in the estimation of the panel of judges, represents the most valuable contribution to the field of literary translation each in poetry and prose published during the previous year. The original work may have been written in any language, but in order to be eligible for the NTA, the translation must be into English, and the book must have been published during the preceding calendar year. The prize awarded annually to the winning translator is worth $4,000 each in Poetry and Prose. In addition to honoring individual translators for their work, the NTA celebrates the craft of literary translation and strives to increase its visibility and broaden its market. The winner is announced each year at the ALTA annual conference.

For a complete list of past winners, see the main National Translation Award page.

===Lucien Stryk Asian Translation Prize===

In 2009, ALTA announced a $6,000 translation award named in honor of Lucien Stryk (1924-2013), acclaimed Zen poet and translator of Japanese and Chinese Zen poetry. The Lucien Stryk Prize is awarded annually to the translator of a book-length translation of Asian poetry, or source texts from Zen Buddhism published in the previous calendar year. Eligible translations may be from Chinese, Hindi, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Sanskrit, Tamil, Thai, or Vietnamese into English. The Lucien Stryk Prize is intended for translations of contemporary works, but retranslations or first-time translations of older works may also be considered. The inaugural Lucien Stryk Prize was awarded in 2010. The winner is announced each year at the ALTA annual conference.

===Italian Prose in Translation Award (IPTA)===

The Italian Prose in Translation Award (IPTA), which was inaugurated in 2015, recognizes the importance of contemporary Italian prose (fiction and literary non-fiction) and promotes the translation of Italian works into English. This $5,000 prize will be awarded annually to a translator of a work of Italian prose (fiction or literary non-fiction) published in the previous calendar year. The winning translators and books are featured at the annual ALTA conference. Both translators and publishers are invited to submit titles. The winner is announced each year at the ALTA annual conference.

=== Spain-USA Foundation Translation Award (SUFTA) ===
The Spain-USA Foundation Translation Award (SUFTA), inaugurated in 2022, is offered by the American Literary Translators Association in conjunction with the Spain-USA Foundation. The award recognizes translations into English of literary prose works written originally by authors of Spanish (Spain) nationality published in the previous calendar year. The source language of the original text may be Spanish, Catalan, Basque, or Galician. The winner of the SUFTA is recognized at the annual ALTA conference and is awarded a $5,000 prize.

=== ALTA First Translation Prize ===
The ALTA First Translation Prize, inaugurated in 2024, recognizes the work of emerging literary translators and their editors. This annual prize is open to all genres, and awards one debut literary translation from any other language into English published in the previous calendar year. Translators based anywhere in the world and translations published anywhere in the world are eligible. The winner is recognized at the annual ALTA conference. They receive a cash prize of $3,000, with $2,000 bestowed to the translator and $1,000 to the editor.

===ALTA Travel Fellowships===

ALTA Travel Fellowships are awards of $1,000 each that are designed to help early-career translators cover the travel and lodging expenses associated with attending the ALTA Annual Conference. Each year, four to six winners are selected through a competitive application process, and ALTA Fellows give a public reading of their work at the conference. ALTA Fellows are typically first-time ALTA conference attendees. For the ALTA Travel Fellowships, an emerging translator is defined as someone who does not yet have a book-length work of translation published or under contract. 

Each year, the Peter K. Jansen Memorial Travel Fellowship is preferentially awarded to one emerging translator of color or a translator working from an underrepresented diaspora or stateless language. 

===The Cliff Becker Book Prize in Translation===

The Cliff Becker Book Prize in Translation was given to an unpublished book-length manuscript of poetry in translation and includes a $1,000 prize and publication by White Pine Press. The prize was suspended in 2019, and has reverted to the publisher White Pine Press.

==Publications==

<text>The Yamaha DragStar 650 (also known as the V Star 650 and the XVS650/XVS650A) is a cruiser-style motorcycle produced by Yamaha Motor Company between 1997 and 2017.

The XVS650 came in two models: the Custom with a lower seat height and slightly less weight, and the Classic with a higher seat.

==Description==

===Engine===
The XVS650 engine is based on the Yamaha Virago 535 engine, with the cylinders bored an additional 5 mm to 81 mm and stroked 4 mm more to 63 mm, increasing displacement to 649 cc.

===Versions===
The Yamaha XVS650 was sold in the U.S. as the entry-level bike of the V-Star line. That line was offered from 1998 to 2008 in two different versions: the Custom and the Classic. Both versions are built around the same 649 cc v-twin engine. The V-Star line offers the visual appeal of larger v-twin motorcycles paired with the fuel efficiency, reliability, and handling of a mid-size cruiser.

*V-Star Custom (650) XVS650 - Base version for long-distance cruising. It was equipped with plastic front &amp; rear fenders, and incorporated a recessed taillight under the flared rear fender. This model also came in a special Midnight Custom version with blacked-out trim. The Midnight Custom (XVS65Y-B) was painted in Raven (black metallic), including black wheel rims and black satin trim throughout. Chrome accents and pipes complimented the monochromatic color scheme.

:The Custom seat height is , and weight approximately .

*V-Star Classic (650) XVS650A - The same frame as the V-star Custom but with wider front wheel, metal fenders, longer bodywork, less chromed styling, dragged handlebars, wider seat and numerous styling differences.

:The Classic has a seat height of , and is approximately 15 kg heavier, at .

**V-Star Silverado (650) - Much as the V-Star Classic with saddlebags and a few other touring additions

<doc id="905336" wikidata="Q3066480" url="?curid=905336" title="Molaise of Leighlin">
<text>Saint Molaise of Leighlin, also Laisrén or Laserian (died ca. 639), was an early Irish saint and abbot of Lethglenn or Leithglenn, now Old Leighlin in County Carlow, who is supposed to have lived in the 6th and 7th centuries. In Scotland, he is known as &quot;Molaise&quot; while in Ireland he is revered as &quot;Laserian&quot;. 

==Life==
Born in Ireland, Molaise was said to have been of noble birth. He was raised in Scotland, as a young man he lived the life of a hermit on Holy Isle (off the Isle of Arran). He then went to Rome, where he was ordained by Pope Gregory I.

He later entered the monastery at Old Leighlin in Ireland where he became abbot and possibly bishop. He adapted Church discipline in accordance with the practices of Rome. He introduced or advocated the Roman method of dating the celebration of Easter. When Molaise was in his late 50s, he went back to Rome and was consecrated bishop by Pope Honorius I. 

According to Kuno Meyer, he is the Laisrén who is depicted in the Old Irish prose narrative &quot;The Vision of Laisrén&quot;, one of the earliest vernacular pieces of vision literature in Christian tradition. The extant fragment shows him leaving the monastery of Clúain (possibly Clonmacnois or Cloyne) to &#x27;purify&#x27; the church of Clúain Cháin (unidentified) in Connaught. After a three nights&#x27; fast, his soul is taken up by two angels, who escort him to Hell to show him the horrors that await unredeemed sinners. The angels explain to one devil eager to take Laisrén from them that their guest is granted the vision in order that &quot;he will give warning before us to his friends.&quot;

Molaise probably died circa 639. His feast day is celebrated on 18 April. In a note added to the &quot;Félire Óengusso&quot;, Molaise is said to have pulled out a hair from St Sillán&#x27;s eyebrow which had the special property that anyone who saw it in the morning died instantly. Having thereby saved others, Molaise died. Because of the fiery connection between sunrise and Molaise&#x27;s name, from &quot;lasair&quot; &quot;flame&quot;, the anecdote has been interpreted as relating to solar mythology. His monastery thrived and gave its name to the diocese established in 1111 at the Synod of Ráith Bressail.

<doc id="905340" wikidata="Q4064185" url="?curid=905340" title="American Translators Association">
<text>The American Translators Association (ATA) is the largest professional association of translators and interpreters in the United States with nearly 8,500 members in more than 100 countries.

Founded in 1959, membership is open to anyone with an interest in translation and interpretation as a profession or as a scholarly pursuit. Members include translators, interpreters, educators, project managers, web and software developers, language services companies, hospitals, universities, and government agencies.

ATA offers certification examinations for its members in some language combinations and is affiliated with the International Federation of Translators (FIT). The association is headquartered in Alexandria, Virginia.

The ATA represents both &quot;labor&quot; and &quot;management&quot;—that is, both the independent contractors who produce translation and interpreting services and the agencies who purchase them. The ATA does not provide union-type benefits, such as collective bargaining or health insurance, to its freelance members.

==Professional development==
ATA&#x27;s primary goals are to foster and support the professional development of translators and interpreters and to promote the translation and interpretation as professions. The Association offers a variety of programs and services in support of these goals, including webinars and one-day workshops throughout the year and an ATA Annual Conference every fall—all of which feature translating and interpreting education in diverse specialties and languages.

==Certification==
The ATA currently offers certification exams in the following language pairs:

Into English from Arabic, Chinese, Croatian, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, and Ukrainian.

From English into Arabic, Chinese, Croatian, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, and Ukrainian.

After passing the ATA certification examination, translators are required to complete a certain number of &quot;continuing education&quot; points in order to retain their certification.

==Advocacy==
ATA is a member of the Joint National Committee for Languages, a nonprofit education policy association that works to raise grassroots awareness of the importance of languages to national security, economic growth, and social justice. ATA has also advocated for translators and interpreters on specific issues affecting the translation and interpreting professions. See ATA Statement Opposing Discontinuing Immigration Interpreting Services, ATA Opposes Lower Interpreter Exam Scores in Texas, and ATA Position Statement Regarding California Assembly Bill 5 and Request for Exemption.

==International Translation Day==
Since 2018, ATA has celebrated International Translation Day (September 30) by publishing a series of social media posts intended to educate the public about the role of professional translators and interpreters. ATA&#x27;s 2018 ITD celebration centered on six infographics highlighting &quot;need to know&quot; facts about translation and interpreting services. On September 30, the Association will release a &quot;Day in the Life of a Translator or Interpreter,&quot; a short animated video showing how translators and interpreters help power the global economy.

ATA is governed by its Bylaws, and has a President, a President-Elect, a Secretary, a Treasurer, and a nine-member Board of Directors. An Executive Director is in charge of operations.

<doc id="905342" wikidata="Q27437568" url="?curid=905342" title="Association of Welsh Translators and Interpreters">
<text>The Association of Welsh Translators and Interpreters, which brands itself with its Welsh name Cymdeithas Cyfieithwyr Cymru, is a professional body representing English/Welsh translators and interpreters in Wales. The association has some 340 members, most of whom are translators; less than a quarter are interpreters. The Association of Welsh Translators and Interpreters is a member of the International Federation of Translators (FIT).

== History ==
The Association of Welsh Translators and Interpreters was established in 1976 to provide a forum for the discussion of issues relating to Welsh/English translation and interpreting. Its goal is to ensure professional translation standards are upheld in the field of Welsh/English translation and interpreting. The association also advises the Welsh Language Commissioner on translation issues.

<text>The Institute of Translation and Interpreting (ITI) is a professional association representing translators, interpreters and language services businesses in the United Kingdom. ITI is affiliated with the International Federation of Translators (FIT).

==History==
ITI was founded in 1986, as a successor to the IOL&#x27;s &quot;Translators&#x27; Guild&quot;. As the principal professional association of translators and interpreters in the United Kingdom, it has become one of the primary sources of information on translation and interpreting to government, industry, the media and the public. It was one of the bodies consulted regarding the creation of the EN 15038 European quality standard for the provision of translation services.

==Aim==
The Institute of Translation and Interpreting aims to promote the highest standards in the translation and interpreting professions. It achieves this through the publication of a bimonthly bulletin (the ITI Bulletin), blog posts and pamphlets, the organisation of regular conferences and courses linked to continuing professional development, rigorous criteria for full membership including examinations and peer assessment, and a mentoring scheme for newcomers to the profession. The institute also worked together with the CIoL on the establishment and administration of the new designation of Chartered Linguist as well as collaborating with numerous other UK-based interpreting organizations in the umbrella body Professional Interpreters for Justice (PI4J/PIJ), to campaign against the new Ministry of Justice framework agreement for public service interpreting.

==Membership==
Although most of its members are based in the United Kingdom, ITI has members from across continental Europe and other countries where English is commonly used. The main grades of individual membership are Fellow, Qualified Member, Associate, Affiliate, Project Manager and Student, and there are categories for individual Supporters and Academics, with some Corporate Members, classified into Corporate – Language Services Providers, Corporate Education and Corporate Affiliate. In January 2022 the numbers included 62 Fellows, 1535 Members, 444 Associates, 301 Students and 87 Corporates, along with a handful of honorary and concessionary members, making a total of 3165. Members are bound by the institute&#x27;s Code of Professional Conduct. Fellows and Qualified Members are entitled to use the postnominals FITI and MITI; the equivalent AITI for Associates was abolished when the precise definition of &#x27;Associate&#x27; changed several times in around 2005, but was reinstated in 2013.

==Bulletin Magazine==
The Bulletin is published bimonthly and has an estimated readership of 7000. As well as publicising ITI events, including conferences, workshops etc., it contains articles relating to translating and interpreting. Some editions include interviews with authors and articles on world issues running alongside regular features on the pitfalls of poor translation, reviews of translation software, taxation, money matters, and the many uses of translation and interpreting.
==Conference==
One of the highlights in the ITI Calendar is its conference, held every two years at different venues across the UK. The last face-to-face event before the pandemic was held at Cutlers&#x27; Hall in Sheffield in May 2019 and was attended by 375 people, while previous editions in recent years were held in locations such as Cardiff, Newcastle, Gatwick Airport, Birmingham and London. In years when there is no conference, the Institute organises a one-day event, with the first held in London in 2018. It was planned to hold the next event in Bristol in June 2020, but this had to be cancelled due to COVID-19.
ITI&#x27;s 2021 conference was held online in May 2021.
As Covid restrictions were reduced, the 2022 conference was held as a hybrid event, online and in Brighton on 31 May - 1 June 2022. 250 people attended the event, held at the Grand Hotel, Brighton, with a similar number online. Sessions were held across four streams, with three focused on translation, while the fourth stream was devoted to interpreting matters. In 2023, ITI held two one-day events, the first took place in Harpenden in May and the second in Manchester in September.

In 2024, the ITI Conference was held in Edinburgh on 4–5 June. Once again, it was a hybrid event, with 300 people on-site at the John McIntyre Conference Centre, with a further 120 watching online. The event had four streams, following the same format as the previous conference, with access to recordings available for a full year after the event.

==Covid-19==
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the ITI continued to work to support its members by moving events online. During the early part of the first UK lockdown, an online coffee morning was held weekly, along with other online webinars offering training in a range of subjects. These were supplemented by online activities and events offered by regional groups and networks. Online events have continued and been developed into a permanent feature of the post-Covid CPD offering, with members getting access to a library of past events.

==ITI networks==
From the beginning, ITI members have sought to form groups based on regional, language and specialist lines. ITI has groups across all geographical areas of United Kingdom, including the ITI Scottish Network, ITI Cymru Wales, ITI London Regional Group. Language groups such as the German Network, Polish Network, French Network and Japanese Network (J-Net), as well as subject-based networks such as STEP and infotech, maintain internet-based groups for purposes such as the clarification of terminological queries, discussion of best practice, sharing work, and organizing social events.

<doc id="905348" wikidata="Q5165504" url="?curid=905348" title="Continuous phase modulation">
<text>Continuous phase modulation (CPM) is a method for modulation of data commonly used in wireless modems. In contrast to other coherent digital phase modulation techniques where the carrier phase
abruptly resets to zero at the start of every symbol (e.g. M-PSK), with CPM the carrier phase is modulated in a continuous manner. For instance, with QPSK the carrier instantaneously jumps from a sine to a cosine (i.e. a 90 degree phase shift) whenever one of the two message bits of the current symbol differs from the two message bits of the previous symbol. This discontinuity requires a relatively large percentage of the power to occur outside of the intended band (e.g., high fractional out-of-band power), leading to poor spectral efficiency. Furthermore, CPM is typically implemented as a constant-envelope waveform, i.e., the transmitted carrier power is constant.
Therefore, CPM is attractive because the phase continuity yields high spectral efficiency, and the constant envelope yields excellent power efficiency. The primary drawback is the high implementation complexity required for an optimal receiver. 

== Phase memory ==
Each symbol is modulated by gradually changing the phase of the carrier from the starting value to the final value, over the symbol duration. The modulation and demodulation of CPM is complicated by the fact that the initial phase of each symbol is determined by the cumulative total phase of all previous transmitted symbols, which is known as the &quot;phase memory&quot;.
Therefore, the optimal receiver cannot make decisions on any isolated symbol without taking the entire sequence of transmitted symbols into account. This requires a maximum-likelihood sequence estimator (MLSE), which is efficiently implemented using the Viterbi algorithm.

== Phase trajectory ==
Minimum-shift keying (MSK) is another name for CPM with an excess bandwidth of 1/2 and a linear &quot;phase trajectory&quot;. Although this linear phase trajectory is continuous, it is not &quot;smooth&quot; since the derivative of the phase is not continuous. The spectral efficiency of CPM can be further improved by using a smooth phase trajectory. This is typically accomplished by filtering the phase trajectory prior to modulation, commonly using a raised cosine or a Gaussian filter. The raised cosine filter has zero crossings offset by exactly one symbol time, and so it can yield a &quot;full-response&quot; CPM waveform that prevents intersymbol interference (ISI).

== Partial response CPM ==
Partial-response signaling, such as duo-binary signaling, is a form of intentional ISI where 
a certain number of adjacent symbols interfere with each symbol in a controlled manner.
A MLSE must be used to optimally demodulate any signal in the presence of ISI. Whenever
the amount of ISI is known, such as with any partial-response signaling scheme, MLSE can be used to determine the exact symbol sequence (in the absence of noise). Since the optimal demodulation of full-response CPM already requires MLSE detection, using partial-response signaling requires little additional complexity, but can afford a comparatively smoother phase trajectory, and thus, even greater spectral efficiency. One extremely popular form of partial-response CPM is GMSK, which is used by GSM in most of the world&#x27;s 2nd generation cell phones. It is also used in 802.11 FHSS, Bluetooth, and many other proprietary wireless modems.

== Continuous-phase frequency-shift keying ==

Continuous-phase frequency-shift keying (CPFSK) is a commonly used variation of frequency-shift keying (FSK), which is itself a special case of analog frequency modulation. FSK is a method of modulating digital data onto a sinusoidal carrier wave, encoding the information present in the data to variations in the carrier&#x27;s instantaneous frequency between one of two frequencies (referred to as the space frequency and mark frequency). In general, a standard FSK signal does not have continuous phase, as the modulated waveform cuts instantaneously between two sinusoids with different frequencies.

As the name suggests, the phase of a CPFSK is in fact continuous; this attribute is desirable for signals that are to be transmitted over a bandlimited channel, as discontinuities in a signal introduce wideband frequency components. In addition, some classes of amplifiers exhibit nonlinear behavior when driven with nearly discontinuous signals; this could have undesired effects on the shape of the transmitted signal.

=== Theory ===
If a finitely valued digital signal to be transmitted (the message) is &quot;m&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), then the corresponding CPFSK signal is

:formula_1

where &quot;Ac&quot; represents the amplitude of the CPFSK signal, &quot;fc&quot; is the base carrier frequency, and &quot;Df&quot; is a parameter that controls the frequency deviation of the modulated signal. The integral located inside of the cosine&#x27;s argument is what gives the CPFSK signal its continuous phase; an integral over any finitely valued function (which &quot;m&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is assumed to be) will not contain any discontinuities. If the message signal is assumed to be causal, then the limits on the integral change to a lower bound of zero and a higher bound of &quot;t&quot;.

Note that this does not mean that &quot;m&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) must be continuous; in fact, most ideal digital data waveforms contain discontinuities. However, even a discontinuous message signal will generate a proper CPFSK signal.

<doc id="905350" wikidata="Q337509" url="?curid=905350" title="Araneus diadematus">
<text>The spider species Araneus diadematus is commonly called the European garden spider, cross orbweaver, diadem spider, orangie, cross spider, and crowned orb weaver. It is sometimes called the pumpkin spider, although this name is also used for a different species, &quot;Araneus marmoreus&quot;. It is an orb-weaver spider found in Europe, where it is native, and North America, where it was introduced.

==Range==
&quot;A. diadematus&quot; has a holarctic distribution throughout Europe and across North America, from southern Canada to Mexico, and from British Columbia to Newfoundland.

==Size and markings==

Individual spiders&#x27; colourings can range from extremely light yellow to very dark grey, but all &quot;A. diadematus&quot; spiders have mottled white markings across the dorsal abdomen, with four or more segments forming a cross. The markings are formed in cells filled with guanine, which is a byproduct of protein metabolism.

Adult females range in length from , while males range from . Occasionally, the female will eat the male directly after mating. (See video below.)

==Specialization==

The legs of orb-weaver spiders are specialized for spinning orb webs. The webs are built by the larger females, which hang head down in the center of the web or remain hidden in nearby foliage, with one claw hooked to a signal line connected to the main orb, waiting for a disturbance to signal the arrival of prey. Prey is then quickly wrapped in silk and bitten, and the prey may hang on the web to be stored for later consumption. The initial bite serves to paralyze the prey and minimize the danger of the spider herself being stung or bitten, and the enzymes thus injected serve to begin liquefaction of the prey&#x27;s internal structures.

Alongside the use of the web to capture other prey, the spiders are also cannibals and prey on each other, but this only happens just before, during, or just after sexual activity. They attack based on their size, sexual experience, and hunger levels.

&quot;A. diadematus&quot; is a reclusive creature and only bites humans if cornered or otherwise provoked. It responds to a disturbance by vibrating rapidly in its web until it becomes a blur, a reaction that is assumed to confuse potential predators.

<text>The New Zealand Society of Translators and Interpreters (NZSTI) (or, in Māori, &quot;Te Ropu Kaiwhakamaori a-waha, a-tuhi o Aotearoa&quot;) is the professional association for translators and interpreters in New Zealand. Its mission statement:

&quot;NZSTI is a nationally representative body of translators and interpreters that provides a networking forum for its members, represents members&#x27; interests, and promotes continued professional development, quality standards and awareness of the profession within government agencies and the wider community.&quot;.
NZSTI is affiliated with the International Federation of Translators (FIT) and has a close relationship with SLIANZ, the Sign Language Interpreters Association of New Zealand (which has its own seat on the NZSTI National Council).

== History ==
NZSTI was established in 1985 and has three regional branches in the three main centres of New Zealand: Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. As well as an annual conference (to be held in Wellington in 2009), the branches hold regular activities through the year to support local members.

== Membership ==
NZSTI has seven categories of membership: &quot;member&quot; (or &quot;ordinary member&quot;), &quot;affiliate&quot;, &quot;observer&quot;, &quot;fellow&quot;, &quot;retired member&quot;, &quot;honorary member&quot; and &quot;foreign member&quot;. An online directory is available with a search function by name, by language combinations and by mode (whether a translator or interpreter).
