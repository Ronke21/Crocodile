<text>In logic, a true/false decision problem is decidable if there exists an effective method for deriving the correct answer. Zeroth-order logic (propositional logic) is decidable, whereas first-order and higher-order logic are not. Logical systems are decidable if membership in their set of logically valid formulas (or theorems) can be effectively determined. A theory (set of sentences closed under logical consequence) in a fixed logical system is decidable if there is an effective method for determining whether arbitrary formulas are included in the theory. Many important problems are undecidable, that is, it has been proven that no effective method for determining membership (returning a correct answer after finite, though possibly very long, time in all cases) can exist for them.

==Decidability of a logical system==

Each logical system comes with both a syntactic component, which among other things determines the notion of provability, and a semantic component, which determines the notion of logical validity. The logically valid formulas of a system are sometimes called the theorems of the system, especially in the context of first-order logic where Gödel&#x27;s completeness theorem establishes the equivalence of semantic and syntactic consequence. In other settings, such as linear logic, the syntactic consequence (provability) relation may be used to define the theorems of a system.

A logical system is decidable if there is an effective method for determining whether arbitrary formulas are theorems of the logical system. For example, propositional logic is decidable, because the truth-table method can be used to determine whether an arbitrary propositional formula is logically valid.

First-order logic is not decidable in general; in particular, the set of logical validities in any signature that includes equality and at least one other predicate with two or more arguments is not decidable. Logical systems extending first-order logic, such as second-order logic and type theory, are also undecidable.

The validities of monadic predicate calculus with identity are decidable, however. This system is first-order logic restricted to those signatures that have no function symbols and whose relation symbols other than equality never take more than one argument.

Some logical systems are not adequately represented by the set of theorems alone. (For example, Kleene&#x27;s logic has no theorems at all.) In such cases, alternative definitions of decidability of a logical system are often used, which ask for an effective method for determining something more general than just validity of formulas; for instance, validity of sequents, or the consequence relation {(Г, &quot;A&quot;) | Г ⊧ &quot;A&quot;} of the logic.

==Decidability of a theory==

A theory is a set of formulas, often assumed to be closed under logical consequence. Decidability for a theory concerns whether there is an effective procedure that decides whether the formula is a member of the theory or not, given an arbitrary formula in the signature of the theory. The problem of decidability arises naturally when a theory is defined as the set of logical consequences of a fixed set of axioms.

There are several basic results about decidability of theories. Every (non-paraconsistent) inconsistent theory is decidable, as every formula in the signature of the theory will be a logical consequence of, and thus a member of, the theory. Every complete recursively enumerable first-order theory is decidable. An extension of a decidable theory may not be decidable. For example, there are undecidable theories in propositional logic, although the set of validities (the smallest theory) is decidable.

A consistent theory that has the property that every consistent extension is undecidable is said to be essentially undecidable. In fact, every consistent extension will be essentially undecidable. The theory of fields is undecidable but not essentially undecidable. Robinson arithmetic is known to be essentially undecidable, and thus every consistent theory that includes or interprets Robinson arithmetic is also (essentially) undecidable.

Examples of decidable first-order theories include the theory of real closed fields, and Presburger arithmetic, while the theory of groups and Robinson arithmetic are examples of undecidable theories.

==Some decidable theories==

Some decidable theories include (Monk 1976, p. 234):
* The set of first-order logical validities in the signature with only equality, established by Leopold Löwenheim in 1915.
* The set of first-order logical validities in a signature with equality and one unary function, established by Ehrenfeucht in 1959.
* The first-order theory of the natural numbers in the signature with equality and addition, also called Presburger arithmetic. The completeness was established by Mojżesz Presburger in 1929.
* The first-order theory of the natural numbers in the signature with equality and multiplication, also called Skolem arithmetic.
* The first-order theory of Boolean algebras, established by Alfred Tarski in 1940 (found in 1940 but announced in 1949).
* The first-order theory of algebraically closed fields of a given characteristic, established by Tarski in 1949.
* The first-order theory of real-closed ordered fields, established by Tarski in 1949 (see also Tarski&#x27;s exponential function problem).
* The first-order theory of Euclidean geometry, established by Tarski in 1949.
* The first-order theory of Abelian groups, established by Szmielew in 1955.
* The first-order theory of hyperbolic geometry, established by Schwabhäuser in 1959.
* Specific decidable sublanguages of set theory investigated in the 1980s through today.(Cantone &quot;et al.&quot;, 2001)
* The monadic second-order theory of trees (see S2S).

Methods used to establish decidability include quantifier elimination, model completeness, and the Łoś-Vaught test.

==Some undecidable theories==
Some undecidable theories include (Monk 1976, p. 279):

* The set of logical validities in any first-order signature with equality and either: a relation symbol of arity no less than 2, or two unary function symbols, or one function symbol of arity no less than 2, established by Trakhtenbrot in 1953.
* The first-order theory of the natural numbers with addition, multiplication, and equality, established by Tarski and Andrzej Mostowski in 1949.
* The first-order theory of the rational numbers with addition, multiplication, and equality, established by Julia Robinson in 1949.
* The first-order theory of groups, established by Alfred Tarski in 1953. Remarkably, not only the general theory of groups is undecidable, but also several more specific theories, for example (as established by Mal&#x27;cev 1961) the theory of finite groups. Mal&#x27;cev also established that the theory of semigroups and the theory of rings are undecidable. Robinson established in 1949 that the theory of fields is undecidable.
*Robinson arithmetic (and therefore any consistent extension, such as Peano arithmetic) is essentially undecidable, as established by Raphael Robinson in 1950.
* The first-order theory with equality and two function symbols.

The interpretability method is often used to establish undecidability of theories. If an essentially undecidable theory &quot;T&quot; is interpretable in a consistent theory &quot;S&quot;, then &quot;S&quot; is also essentially undecidable. This is closely related to the concept of a many-one reduction in computability theory.

==Semidecidability==

A property of a theory or logical system weaker than decidability is semidecidability. A theory is semidecidable if there is a well-defined method whose result, given an arbitrary formula, arrives as positive, if the formula is in the theory; otherwise, may never arrive at all; otherwise, arrives as negative. A logical system is semidecidable if there is a well-defined method for generating a sequence of theorems such that each theorem will eventually be generated. This is different from decidability because in a semidecidable system there may be no effective procedure for checking that a formula is &quot;not&quot; a theorem.

Every decidable theory or logical system is semidecidable, but in general the converse is not true; a theory is decidable if and only if both it and its complement are semi-decidable. For example, the set of logical validities &quot;V&quot; of first-order logic is semi-decidable, but not decidable. In this case, it is because there is no effective method for determining for an arbitrary formula &quot;A&quot; whether &quot;A&quot; is not in &quot;V&quot;. Similarly, the set of logical consequences of any recursively enumerable set of first-order axioms is semidecidable. Many of the examples of undecidable first-order theories given above are of this form.

== Relationship with completeness ==

Decidability should not be confused with completeness. For example, the theory of algebraically closed fields is decidable but incomplete, whereas the set of all true first-order statements about nonnegative integers in the language with + and × is complete but undecidable. 
Unfortunately, as a terminological ambiguity, the term &quot;undecidable statement&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym for independent statement.

== Relationship to computability ==

As with the concept of a decidable set, the definition of a decidable theory or logical system can be given either in terms of &quot;effective methods&quot; or in terms of &quot;computable functions&quot;. These are generally considered equivalent per Church&#x27;s thesis. Indeed, the proof that a logical system or theory is undecidable will use the formal definition of computability to show that an appropriate set is not a decidable set, and then invoke Church&#x27;s thesis to show that the theory or logical system is not decidable by any effective method (Enderton 2001, pp. 206&quot;ff.&quot;).

==In context of games==
Some games have been classified as to their decidability:
* Mate in &quot;n&quot; in infinite chess (with limitations on rules and gamepieces) is decidable. However, there are positions (with finitely many pieces) that are forced wins, but not mate in &quot;n&quot; for any finite &quot;n&quot;.
* Some team games with imperfect information on a finite board (but with unlimited time) are undecidable.

<doc id="913123" wikidata="Q235622" url="?curid=913123" title="Claire Bloom">
<text>Patricia Claire Bloom (born 15 February 1931) is an English actress. She is known for leading roles on stage and screen and has received two BAFTA Awards and a Drama Desk Award as well as nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award, a Grammy Award and a Tony Award. She was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2013 Birthday Honours for services to drama.

After a childhood spent in various places in England and Florida, Bloom studied drama in London. She debuted on the London stage when she was sixteen and took roles in various Shakespeare plays. They included &quot;Hamlet,&quot; in which she played Ophelia alongside Richard Burton. She rose to prominence playing leading roles in stage productions of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire,&quot; &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot;, and &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot;. She made her Broadway debut in the play &quot;Richard II&quot; (1956). She received a Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play nomination for her role in &quot;Electra&quot; (1999).

Bloom made her film debut in &quot;The Blind Goddess&quot; (1948). Her breakthrough came with a leading role acting opposite Charlie Chaplin in &quot;Limelight&quot; (1952) for which she won the BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer. She went on to act in films such as &quot;Richard III&quot; (1955), &quot;Alexander the Great&quot; (1956), &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; (1958), &quot;The Haunting&quot; (1963), &quot;The Spy Who Came In from the Cold&quot; (1965), &quot;Charly&quot; (1968), &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; (1973), &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; (1981), and &quot;Shadowlands&quot; (1985). For the latter she won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress. She later acted in the Woody Allen films &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot; (1989) and &quot;Mighty Aphrodite&quot; (1995), and portrayed Queen Mary in historical drama &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot; (2010).

During her film career, she has starred alongside numerous major actors, including Richard Burton, Laurence Olivier, John Gielgud, Paul Scofield, Ralph Richardson, Yul Brynner, George C. Scott, James Mason, Paul Newman, Julie Harris, Anthony Hopkins, Rod Steiger and Jerry Lewis.

== Early life and education ==
Bloom was born on 15 February 1931 as Patricia Claire Blume in Finchley, then part of Middlesex (now a suburb of north London), the daughter of Elizabeth (née Grew) and Edward Max Blume, a &quot;not very successful&quot; salesman. Her paternal grandparents, originally named Blumenthal, as well as her maternal grandparents, originally named Gravitzky, were Jewish emigrants from Byten in the Grodno region of Russia, now in Belarus, Eastern Europe.

Bloom&#x27;s education was &quot;somewhat haphazard&quot;; she was sent to the independent Badminton School in Bristol, but when her father encountered financial difficulties the family relocated to Cornwall, where she attended the local village school. She later studied stage acting at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, London, and continued her studies under Elsie Fogerty at the Central School of Speech and Drama, then based in the Royal Albert Hall, London.

After the Luftwaffe began bombing London during the Blitz in 1940 her family had a number of narrow escapes as bombs dropped close to their home. While their father remained in England, she and her brother John went with their mother to the United States, where she spent a year living in Florida with a paternal uncle&#x27;s family; during this time her mother worked in her aunt&#x27;s dress shop, &quot;but she proved to be a dreadful saleswoman&quot;. She recalls, &quot;It was 1941; I was ten, John was nearly six. We were to sail from Glasgow in a convoy, on a ship that was evacuating children.&quot; During her year&#x27;s stay in Florida, she was asked by the British War Relief Society to help raise money by entertaining at various benefits, which she then did for a number of weeks. &quot;Thus I broke into show business singing&quot;, she writes. Bloom, along with her mother and brother, next lived in New York with their mother&#x27;s cousin for another eighteen months before returning to England. It was in New York that she decided to become an actress, after her mother took her to see the Broadway play &quot;Three Sisters&quot; for her twelfth birthday:

They returned to England in 1943, and due to her father&#x27;s improved business lived in Mayfair, but her parents&#x27; marriage ended shortly afterwards – so her father could marry his girlfriend – and she had no contact with him for many years.

==Acting career==
===1946–1969: Early roles and breakthrough ===

Bloom made her debut on BBC radio programmes. She made her stage debut in 1946 when she was 15 with the Oxford Repertory Theatre. Bloom debuted aged 16 at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre as Ophelia to Paul Scofield&#x27;s Hamlet; Robert Helpmann alternated playing the prince. Bloom has written that during the production she had a crush on Scofield. As Scofield was married and the father of a son, Bloom hoped only, &quot;to be flirted with and taken some notice of&quot;. She later recalled, &quot;I could never make up my mind which of my two Hamlets I found the more devastating: the openly homosexual, charismatic Helpmann, or the charming, shy young man from Sussex.&quot; When asked about Bloom years later, Scofield recalled, &quot;Sixteen years old I think—so very young and necessarily inexperienced, she looked lovely, she acted with a daunting assurance which belied entirely her inexperience of almost timid reticence. She was a very good Ophelia.&quot;

Her London stage debut was in 1947 in the Christopher Fry play &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Not For Burning&quot;, which starred Sir John Gielgud and Pamela Brown and featured a young Richard Burton. It also played on Broadway in New York City. It was during the rehearsals for the play that Burton and Bloom began a long love affair. The following year she received acclaim for her portrayal of Ophelia in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, starring Burton. Although Burton was at that time married to Sybil Christopher, fellow actor and friend of Burton, Stanley Baker, seeing how attracted he was to Bloom, commented that he &quot;thought that this might be the time when Rich actually left Sybil.&quot; In his later years, Burton told his biographer, Michael Munn, &quot;&#x27;I only ever loved two women before Elizabeth,&#x27; Sybil was one, Claire Bloom the other.&quot; Of her Juliet in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1957), critic Kenneth Tynan stated it was &quot;the best Juliet I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;. After she starred as Blanche DuBois in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, its playwright, Tennessee Williams, stated, &quot;I declare myself absolutely wild about Claire Bloom&quot;.
Bloom&#x27;s first film role was in the 1948 film &quot;The Blind Goddess&quot;. She trained at the Rank Organisation&#x27;s charm school but did not stay with that company for long. Her international screen debut came in the 1952 film &quot;Limelight&quot;, when she was chosen by Charlie Chaplin, who also directed, to co-star alongside him. The film catapulted Bloom to stardom. Biographer Dan Kamin states that &quot;Limelight&quot; is a similar story to Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;City Lights&quot;, made twenty years earlier, in which Chaplin also helps a heroine overcome a physical handicap. In this film, Bloom plays a suicidal ballerina who &quot;suffers from hysterical paralysis&quot;.

The film had personal meaning for Chaplin as it contained numerous references to his life and family: the theatre where he and Bloom performed in the film was the same theatre where his mother gave her last performance; Bloom was directed by Chaplin to wear dresses similar to those his mother used to wear; Chaplin&#x27;s sons and his half-brother all had parts. Bloom states that she felt one of the reasons she got the part was because she closely resembled his young wife, Oona O&#x27;Neill. In his autobiography, Chaplin writes that he had no doubt the film would be a success: &quot;I had fewer qualms about its success than any picture I had ever made.&quot; Chaplin explains his decision to make Bloom co-star despite this being her first film:

She was subsequently featured in a number of &quot;costume&quot; roles in films such as &quot;Alexander the Great&quot; (1956), &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; (1958), &quot;The Buccaneer&quot; (1958), and &quot;The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm&quot; (1962). Bloom also appeared in Laurence Olivier&#x27;s film version of &quot;Richard III&quot; (1955), in which she played Lady Anne, Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; (1973) for which she won Best Actress award at Taormina International Film Festival, &quot;The Outrage&quot; (1964) with Paul Newman and Laurence Harvey, as well as the films &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; (1959) and &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot; (1965), both with Richard Burton. Of Bloom&#x27;s character in &quot;Spy&quot;, novelist David Plante writes that &quot;Claire&#x27;s refined beauty appears to be one with the refinement of a culture she represents as an actress.&quot; In a 2002 interview with Michael Shelden, Bloom said of Burton, &quot;He had it all: intelligence, physical beauty, an incredible voice. There was no one else like him. When we were at the Old Vic, he proved that a working-class actor could make it, and I was proud of him. I thought he set a great example in a society that was, and still is, so preoccupied with class and accent.&quot;

=== 1970–1989: Theatre roles and acclaim ===

Bloom has appeared in a number of plays and theatrical works in both London and New York. Those works include &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot;; &quot;Rashomon&quot;; &#x27;Duel of Angels&#x27; (by Jean Giraudoux), co-starring with Vivien Leigh, in 1958; and Bloom&#x27;s favourite role, that of Blanche DuBois, in a revival of the Tennessee Williams play, &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, which played in London in 1974. Critic Clive Barnes described the play as a &quot;notable example of what the classic revival should be – well groomed, but thoughtful, expressive, illuminating.&quot; Another critic writes that Bloom&#x27;s portrayal of Blanche featured &quot;remarkable layers of vitality and tenderness&quot;, and playwright Williams stated, &quot;I declare myself absolutely wild about Claire Bloom.&quot; Bloom has also performed in one-woman shows that included monologues from several of her stage performances. She also starred in the 1976 Broadway revival of &quot;The Innocents&quot;. In the 1960s she began to play more contemporary roles, including an unhinged housewife in &quot;The Chapman Report&quot;, a psychologist opposite Cliff Robertson&#x27;s Oscar-winning role in &quot;Charly&quot;, and Theodora in &quot;The Haunting&quot;. She played Hera in &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot;, reuniting her with Olivier who played Zeus. 

Bloom has appeared in numerous roles on television such as her portrayal of Lady Marchmain in &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; (1981). In 1996, she wrote, &quot;I still find it puzzling when I am told I played a manipulative and heartless woman; that is not how I saw her. Lady Marchmain is deeply religious, and her dilemma includes trying to raise a wilful brood of children on her own, while instilling them with her rigid observance of the Catholic code. Sebastian is both an alcoholic and a homosexual, and from her point of view, he lives in a state of mortal sin. She has to fight for his soul by any means in her power, with the knowledge that her efforts may lead to his destruction. A born crusader, the Marchioness confronts her difficult choices head on; her rigidity of purpose, which I don&#x27;t in any way share, is understandable in context. The aspect that rings most true is her sense of being an outsider, a Catholic in Protestant England. Not such a leap from being a Jew in Protestant England as one would imagine.&quot;

Other work includes two prominent BBC Television productions for director Rudolph Cartier: co-starring with Sean Connery in &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; (1961), and playing Cathy in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; with Keith Michell as Heathcliff (1962). She also appeared as First Lady Edith Wilson in &quot;Backstairs at the White House&quot; (1979); as Joy Gresham, the wife of C.S. Lewis in &quot;Shadowlands&quot; for which she received the BAFTA Award as Best Actress (1985). 

=== 1990–present: Television work and later roles ===

She also appeared in the Woody Allen films &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot; (1989) and &quot;Mighty Aphrodite&quot; (1995). She appeared in the Sylvester Stallone film &quot;Daylight&quot; (1996). Later appearances in films included her portrayal of Queen Mary in the 2010 Oscar winning British film &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot; and her portrayal of Eva Rose opposite Jerry Lewis in the 2016 film &quot;Max Rose&quot;. In television she acted in &quot;The Mirror Crack&#x27;d&quot;, the last of the BBC Miss Marple adaptations in 1992; and as the older Sophy in the serial &quot;The Camomile Lawn&quot; (1992) on Britain&#x27;s Channel 4. Recent mini-series work includes &quot;The Ten Commandments (2006)&quot; and &quot;Summer of Rockets&quot;. On continuing television series, she has appeared on the New York-based &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;. From 1994 to 1995, she portrayed villainess Orlena Grimaldi on the daytime drama &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. She also had major roles in several of the &quot;BBC Television Shakespeare&quot; presentations and has led workshops on Shakespearean performance practices. 

In 2003, Bloom did a stage reading of Milton&#x27;s &quot;Samson Agonistes&quot; along with actor John Neville at Bryn Mawr College at the behest of poet Karl Kirchwey. In December 2006, she appeared on the London stage in Arthur Allan Seidelman&#x27;s production of &quot;Six Dance Lessons in Six Weeks&quot; by Richard Alfieri, a two-hander in which she co-starred with Billy Zane. In October 2007, she appeared opposite Peter Bowles in &quot;Love Letters&quot; at the Théâtre Princesse Grace, Monte Carlo, directed by Marc Sinden, as part of his British Theatre Season, Monaco. In 2008, she guest starred in &quot;New Tricks&quot; as actress Helen Brownlow. The story concerned the murder of Brownlow&#x27;s husband whilst they were in a play together.

In December 2009 and January 2010, she appeared in the two-part &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;The End of Time&quot; as a mysterious Time Lord credited only as &quot;The Woman&quot;. Series executive producer Russell T Davies revealed in his 2010 book &quot;The Writer&#x27;s Tale&quot; that the character is supposed to be the Doctor&#x27;s mother. In 2010, she guest starred as Jill Peters in &quot;The Bill&quot; in the episode &quot;Taking a Stand&quot; and played Queen Mary in &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot;. In September 2012, she appeared in concert at the Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall, Baltimore, Maryland, as the narrator in a performance of Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s Kaddish, with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra conducted by Marin Alsop. In 2013, Bloom appeared in the sixth series of ITV&#x27;s Doc Martin as the estranged mother of the title character. In 2015 she appeared as Matilda Stowe in ITV&#x27;s &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; episode 17.4, &quot;A Vintage Murder&quot;. In 2019, she appeared as Aunt Mary in the Stephen Poliakoff BBC TV mini-series, &quot;Summer of Rockets&quot;. In 2022, she appeared as Margaret Ellingham (deceased mother of Dr. Martin Ellingham) in the last episode (10.9) of the ITV series Doc Martin.

==Personal life==
=== Marriages ===
Bloom has married three times. Her first marriage, in 1959, was to actor Rod Steiger, whom she met when they both performed in the play &quot;Rashomon&quot;. Their daughter is opera singer Anna Steiger. Steiger and Bloom divorced in 1969. In that same year, Bloom married producer Hillard Elkins. The marriage lasted for three years, and the couple divorced in 1972. Bloom&#x27;s third marriage on 29 April 1990, was to writer Philip Roth, her longtime companion. They divorced in 1995.

=== Memoir ===
Bloom has written two memoirs about her life and career. The first, &quot;Limelight and After: The Education of an Actress&quot;, was published in 1982 and was an in-depth look at her career and the film and stage roles she had portrayed. Her second book, &quot;Leaving a Doll&#x27;s House: A Memoir&quot;, published in 1996, went into greater details about her personal life; she discussed not only her marriages but also her affairs with Richard Burton, Laurence Olivier, and Yul Brynner. The book created a stir when Bloom described her former marriage to Roth. Soon after, Roth wrote a &quot;revenge novel&quot; &quot;I Married a Communist&quot; (1998), in which the character of Eve Frame appeared to represent Bloom.

<text>Anti-German sentiment (also known as anti-Germanism, Germanophobia or Teutophobia) is fear or dislike of Germany, its people, and its culture. Its opposite is Germanophilia.

==History==
=== Australia ===
When Britain declared war on Germany in 1914, naturalized Australian subjects born in enemy countries and Australian-born descendants of migrants born in enemy countries were declared &quot;enemy aliens&quot;. Approximately 4,500 &quot;enemy aliens&quot; of German or Austro-Hungarian descent were interned in Australia during the war.

An official proclamation of 10 August 1914 required all German citizens to register their domiciles at the nearest police station and to notify authorities of any change of address. Under the later Aliens Restriction Order of 27 May 1915, enemy aliens who had not been interned had to report to the police once a week and could only change address with official permission. An amendment to the Restriction Order in July 1915 prohibited enemy aliens and naturalized subjects from changing their name or the name of any business they ran. Under the War Precautions Act of 1914 (which survived the First World War), publication of German language material was prohibited and schools attached to Lutheran churches were forced to abandon German as the language of teaching or were closed by the authorities. German clubs and associations were also closed.

The original German names of settlements and streets were officially changed. In South Australia, &quot;Grunthal&quot; became &quot;Verdun&quot; and &quot;Krichauff&quot; became &quot;Beatty&quot;. In New South Wales &quot;Germantown&quot; became &quot;Holbrook&quot; after the submarine commander Norman Douglas Holbrook. This pressure was strongest in South Australia where 69 towns changed their names, including Petersburg, South Australia, which became Peterborough (see Australian place names changed from German names).

Most of the anti-German feeling was created by the press that tried to create the idea that all those of German birth or descent supported Germany uncritically. This is despite many Germans and offspring such as Gen. John Monash serving Australia capably and honorably. A booklet circulated widely in 1915 claimed that &quot;there were over 3,000 German spies scattered throughout the states&quot;. Anti-German propaganda was also inspired by several local and foreign companies who were keen to take the opportunity to eliminate Germany as a competitor in the Australian market. Germans in Australia were increasingly portrayed as evil by the very nature of their origins.

=== Brazil ===
After Brazil&#x27;s entry into the World War II on the Allied side in 1942, anti-German riots broke out in nearly every city in Brazil in which Germans were not the majority population. German factories, including the Suerdieck cigar factory in Bahia, shops, and hotels were destroyed by mobs. The largest demonstrations took place in Porto Alegre in Rio Grande do Sul. Brazilian police persecuted and interned &quot;subjects of the Axis powers&quot; in internment camps similar to those used by the US to intern Japanese-Americans. Following the war, German schools were not reopened, the German-language press disappeared completely, and use of the German language became restricted to the home and the older generation of immigrants.[1]

=== Canada ===

==== Late 19th-early 20th centuries ====
There was some anti-German sentiment in Germanic communities, including Berlin, Ontario (Kitchener, Ontario) in Waterloo County, Ontario, before the First World War and some cultural sanctions. There were anti-German riots in Victoria, British Columbia, and Calgary, Alberta, in the first years of the war.

It was this anti-German sentiment that precipitated the Berlin to Kitchener name change in 1916. The city was named after Lord Kitchener, famously pictured on the &quot;Lord Kitchener Wants You&quot; recruiting posters. Several streets in Toronto that had previously been named for Liszt, Humboldt, Schiller, Bismarck, etc., were changed to names with strong British associations, such as Balmoral.

The Governor General of Canada, the Duke of Connaught, while visiting Berlin, Ontario, in May 1914, had discussed the importance of Canadians of German ethnicity (regardless of their origin) in a speech: &quot;It is of great interest to me that many of the citizens of Berlin are of German descent. I well know the admirable qualities – the thoroughness, the tenacity, and the loyalty of the great Teutonic Race, to which I am so closely related. I am sure that these inherited qualities will go far in the making of good Canadians and loyal citizens of the British Empire&quot;.

Some immigrants from Germany who considered themselves Canadians but were not yet citizens, were detained in internment camps during the War. In fact, by 1919 most of the population of Kitchener, Waterloo, and Elmira in Waterloo County, Ontario, were Canadian.

The German-speaking Amish and Mennonites were Christian pacifists so they could not enlist and the few who had immigrated from Germany (not born in Canada) could not morally fight against a country that was a significant part of their heritage.

News reports during the war years indicate that &quot;A Lutheran minister was pulled out of his house ... he was dragged through the streets. German clubs were ransacked through the course of the war. It was just a really nasty time period.&quot; Someone stole the bust of Kaiser Wilhelm II from Victoria Park and dumped it into a lake; soldiers vandalized German stores. History professor Mark Humphries summarized the situation:

A document in the Archives of Canada makes the following comment: &quot;Although ludicrous to modern eyes, the whole issue of a name for Berlin highlights the effects that fear, hatred and nationalism can have upon a society in the face of war.&quot;
Internment camps across Canada opened in 1915 and 8,579 &quot;enemy aliens&quot; were held there until the end of the war; many were German speaking immigrants from Austria-Hungary, Germany, and Ukraine. Only 3,138 were classed as prisoners of war; the rest were civilians.

Built in 1926, the Waterloo Pioneer Memorial Tower in rural Kitchener, Ontario, commemorates the settlement by the Pennsylvania Dutch (actually &quot;Pennsilfaanisch Deitsch&quot; or &quot;German&quot;) of the Grand River area in the 1800s in what later became Waterloo County, Ontario.

==== World War II ====
There was also anti-German sentiment in Canada during World War II. Under the War Measures Act, some 26 POW camps opened and were filled with those who had been born in Germany, Italy, and particularly in Japan, if they were deemed to be &quot;enemy aliens&quot;. For Germans, this applied especially to single males who had some association with the National Unity Party of Canada. No compensation was paid to them after the war. In Ontario, the largest internment centre for German Canadians was at Camp Petawawa, housing 750 who had been born in Germany and Austria. Although some residents of internment camps were Germans who had already immigrated to Canada, the majority of Germans in such camps were from Europe; most were prisoners of war.

711 Jewish refugees fleeing the Nazi regime in Europe were interned at Camp B70 in Ripples, New Brunswick at the request of Winston Churchill, who worried that there could be German spies among their numbers. The prisoners were subjected to forced labor, including felling lumber and chopping wood to heat the camp. After a year of internment, the refugees were seen as valuable to the war effort, and given the option to participate in the war or find sponsorship in Canada. The camp was temporarily closed in 1941, and converted to a prisoner-of-war camp for the remainder of the war.

=== Czechoslovakia ===
A few days after the end World War II, 2,000 Germans were massacred in Postoloprty and Žatec by the Czechoslovak army. In the summer of 1945, there were a number of incidents and localized massacres of the German population.

The following examples are described in a study done by the European University Institute in Florence:
* In the Přerov incident, 71 men, 120 women, and 74 children were killed.
* 30,000 Germans were forced to leave their homes in Brno for labour camps near Austria. It is estimated that several hundred died in the march.
* Estimates of killed in the Ústí massacre range from 30 to 700 civilians. Some women and children were thrown off the bridge into the Elbe River and shot.

Law No. 115 of 1946 (see Beneš decrees) provides: &quot;Any act committed between September 30, 1938, and October 28, 1945, the object of which was to aid the struggle for liberty of the Czechs and Slovaks or which represented just reprisals for actions of the occupation forces and their accomplices, is not illegal, even when such acts may otherwise be punishable by law.&quot; As a consequence, atrocities committed during the expulsion of Germans were made legal.

=== France ===

==== First World War ====

In 1914, when Germany invaded neutral Belgium and northern France, Imperial German Army regularly court martialed Belgian and French civilians under German military law for offenses including espionage, perfidy, or being francs-tireurs (illegal civilian combatants) and executed 6,500 of them. These acts were both exploited and exaggerated by the governments of the Allied Powers, who produced atrocity propaganda dehumanizing Germans as gorilla-like &quot;Huns&quot; who were all racially inclined to sadism and violence.

=== Israel ===
In the 21st century, the long debate about whether the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra should play the works of Richard Wagner is mostly considered a remnant of the past. In March 2008, German Chancellor Angela Merkel became the first foreign head of government invited to deliver a speech in the Israeli parliament, which she gave in German. Several members of parliament left in protest during the speech and claimed the need to create a collective memory that &quot;will create a kind of electric wave when Jews will hear the sounds of the German language, they&#x27;ll remember the Holocaust.&quot;

In an October 2008 interview, the researcher Hanan Bar (חנן בר) summed up the ambiguous Israeli attitude to Germany: &quot;If the average Israeli happens to see a football match between Germany and Holland, he would automatically root for the Dutch. But the same person, when buying a washing machine, would prefer a German model, considering it to be the best.&quot;

=== Norway ===
German POWs in Norway were forced to clear their own minefields and then walk over them, leading to the death and mutilation of hundreds of prisoners.

=== Russia / Soviet Union ===

In the mid-1850s and 1860s, Russia experienced an outbreak of Germanophobia after Austria refused to support it during the Crimean War. It was restricted mainly to a small group of writers in St. Petersburg that united around a left-wing newspaper. In 1864, it began with the publication of an article by a writer (using the pseudonym &quot;Shedoferotti&quot;) who proposed that Poland be given autonomy and that the privileges of the Baltic German nobility in the Baltic governorates and Finland be preserved. Mikhail Katkov published a harsh criticism of the article in the &quot;Moscow News&quot;, which in turn caused a flood of angry articles in which Russian writers expressed their irritation with Europeans in which some featured direct attacks on Germans.

The following year, the 100th anniversary of the death of Mikhail Lomonosov was marked throughout the Russian Empire by articles being published that mentioned the difficulties that Lomonosov had encountered from the foreign members of the Russian Academy of Sciences, most of whom were of German descent. The authors then criticized contemporary German scholars for their neglect of the Russian language and for printing articles in foreign languages while they received funds from the Russian people. It was further suggested by some writers that Russian citizens of German origin who did not speak Russian and follow the Orthodox faith should be considered foreigners. It was also proposed that people of German descent be forbidden from holding diplomatic posts, as they might not have &quot;solidarity with respect to Russia&quot;.

Despite the press campaign against Germans, Germanophobic feelings did not develop in Russia to any widespread extent and died out because of the Imperial family&#x27;s German roots and the presence of many German names in the Russian political elite.

==== Post World War II ====
On 25 July 1937, NKVD Order No. 00439 led to the arrest of 55,005 German citizens and former citizens in the Soviet Union, of whom 41,898 were sentenced to death. The Soviets were not successful in expelling all German settlers living in the Western and Southern Ukraine, however, due to the rapid advance of the Wehrmacht (German army). The secret police, the NKVD, was able to deport only 35% of the ethnic Germans in Ukraine. Thus in 1943, the Nazi German census registered 313,000 ethnic Germans living in the occupied territories of the Soviet Union. With the Soviet re-conquest, the Wehrmacht evacuated about 300,000 German Russians and brought them back to the Reich. Because of the provisions of the Yalta Agreement, all former Soviet citizens living in Germany at the war&#x27;s end had to be repatriated, most by force. More than 200,000 German Russians were deported, against their will, by the Western Allies and sent to the Gulag. Thus, shortly after the end of the war, more than one million ethnic Germans from Russia were in special settlements and labor camps in Siberia and Central Asia. It is estimated that 200,000 to 300,000 died of starvation, lack of shelter, overwork and disease during the 1940s.

Later during the war Germans were suggested to be used for forced labour. The Soviet Union began deporting ethnic Germans in their territories and using them for forced labour. Although by the end of 1955, they had been acquitted of criminal accusations, no rights to return to their former home regions were granted, nor were the former self-determination rights returned to them. Near the end of World War II and during the occupation of Germany, Soviet forces invaded German villages and raped German women &quot;en masse&quot;. It is believed by historian Antony Beevor that &quot;a &#x27;high proportion&#x27; of at least 15 million women who lived in the Soviet zone or were expelled from Germany&#x27;s eastern provinces were raped.&quot;

=== Great Britain ===
==== Late 19th -Early 20th centuries ====

===== Fears after German Unification =====
Negative comments about Germany were first made in Britain in the 1870s, following the Prussian victory in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870–71. British war planners believed that they needed to prevent a possible German invasion of Britain.

===== Literature =====
German advances eventually lead to the popularity of invasion novels.

According to Alfred Vagts &quot;The Battle of Dorking&quot;: appeared first in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in the summer of 1871, at a time when the German Crown Prince and his English wife [the daughter of Queen Victoria] were visiting England. Impressed by the late German victories, the author, a Colonel Chesney, who remained anonymous for some time, told the story of how England, in 1875, would be induced by an insurrection of the natives in India, disturbances in Ireland, and a conflict with the United States threatening Canadian security, to employ her navy and standing army far from her own shores; in spite of this dangerous position England, on account of a quarrel with Germany over Denmark, would declare war on Germany. The latter would land an army in England which would conquer the remaining parts of the British army and the Volunteers, who would join it at Dorking, and would force upon England a disastrous peace.

In 1894, the newspaper publisher Lord Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe commissioned author William Le Queux to write the serial novel &quot;The Great War in England in 1897&quot;, which featured France and Russia combining their forces in an attempt to crush Britain. Happily, German intervention on Britain&#x27;s side forced France and Russia to retreat. Twelve years later, however, Harmsworth asked him to reverse the enemies, making Germany the villain. The result was the bestselling &quot;The Invasion of 1910&quot;, which originally appeared in serial form in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; in 1906. Now, Harmsworth used his newspapers the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot; to denounce Berlin, inducing an atmosphere of paranoia, mass hysteria and Germanophobia that would reach their climax in the Naval Scare of 1908–09.

=====Discrimination =====

====== Economic ======
German food such as the sausage was deprecated by Germanophobes. In the late 19th century, the label &quot;Made in Germany&quot; was introduced. The label was originally introduced in Britain by the Merchandise Marks Act 1887 (50 &amp; 51 Vict. c. 28), to mark foreign produce more obviously, as foreign manufacturers had been falsely marking inferior goods with the marks of renowned British manufacturing companies and importing them into the United Kingdom. Most of these were found to be originating from Germany, whose government had introduced a protectionist policy to legally prohibit the import of goods in order to build up domestic industry (Merchandise Marks Act – Oxford University Press).

====== Nativism ======
In the 1890s, German immigrants in the UK were the targets of &quot;some hostility&quot;. Joseph Bannister believed that German residents of Britain were mostly &quot;gambling-house keepers, hotel-porters, barbers, &#x27;bullies&#x27;, runaway conscripts, bath-attenders, street musicians, criminals, bakers, socialists, , etc.&quot;. Interviewees for the Royal Commission on Alien Immigration believed that Germans were involved in prostitution and burglary, and many people also believed that Germans who were working in Britain were threatening the livelihoods of Britons by being willing to work for longer hours.

===== Rising political tensions =====
Following the signing of the Entente Cordiale alliance in 1904 between the United Kingdom and France, official relationships cooled, as did popular attitudes towards Germany and German residents in Britain. A fear of German militarism replaced a previous admiration for German culture and literature. At the same time, journalists produced a stream of articles on the threat posed by Germany. In the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; Affair of 1908–09, the Kaiser, in a badly misjudged attempt to show Germany&#x27;s friendship towards England, said that he was among a minority of Germans friendly to Britain, that he had sent a military plan to Queen Victoria during the Boer War which the British Army had used successfully, and that Germany&#x27;s fleet buildup was directed not against Britain but the &quot;yellow peril&quot; of the East.

Articles in Harmsworth&#x27;s &quot;Daily Mail&quot; regularly advocated anti-German sentiments throughout the twentieth century, telling their readers to refuse service at restaurants by Austrian or German waiters on the claim that they were spies and told them that if a German-sounding waiter claimed to be Swiss that they should demand to see the waiter&#x27;s passport. In 1903, Erskine Childers published &quot;The Riddle of the Sands: A Record of Secret Service&quot; a novel in which two Englishmen uncover a plot by Germany to Invade England; it was later made into a 1979 film The Riddle of the Sands.

At the same time, conspiracy theories which combined Germanophobia with antisemitism were concocted, they focused on the supposed foreign control of Britain, some of these conspiracy theories blamed Britain&#x27;s entry into the Second Boer War on international financiers &quot;chiefly German in origin and chiefly Jewish in race&quot;. Most of these ideas about German-Jewish conspiracies originated from right-wing figures such as Arnold White, Hilaire Belloc, and Leo Maxse, the latter using his publication the &quot;National Review&quot; to spread them.

===== Yellow Journalism =====
Anti-German hostility began to intensify in early 1896 when Kaiser Wilhelm II sent the Kruger telegram to President Paul Kruger of the Transvaal congratulating him for repelling the British Jameson Raid. At that time, attacks on Germans in London were reported by the German press, but contrary to the reports, no attacks occurred. The &quot;Saturday Review&quot; suggested: &quot;be ready to fight Germany, as &quot;Germania delenda est&quot;&quot; (&quot;Germany is to be destroyed&quot;), an allusion to Cato the Elder&#x27;s coda in the Second Punic War. The Kaiser&#x27;s reputation was further degraded by his angry tirades and the 1908 &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; Affair.

==== World War I ====

In Great Britain, anti-German feeling led to infrequent rioting, assaults on suspected Germans and the looting of businesses owned by people with German-sounding names, occasionally even taking on an antisemitic tone.
Increasing anti-German hysteria even threw suspicion upon the British royal family. King George V was persuaded to change his German name of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor and relinquish all German titles and styles on behalf of his relatives who were British subjects. Prince Louis of Battenberg was not only forced to change his name to Mountbatten, he was forced to resign as First Sea Lord, the most senior position in the Royal Navy.
The German Shepherd breed of dog was renamed to the euphemistic &quot;Alsatian&quot;; the English Kennel Club only re-authorised the use of &#x27;German Shepherd&#x27; as an official name in 1977. The German biscuit was renamed the Empire biscuit.

Several streets in London which had been named after places in Germany or notable Germans had their names changed. For instance, &quot;Berlin Road&quot; in Catford was renamed &quot;Canadian Avenue&quot;, and &quot;Bismarck Road&quot; in Islington was renamed &quot;Waterlow Road&quot;.

Attitudes to Germany were not entirely negative among British troops fighting on the Western Front; the British writer Nicholas Shakespeare quotes this statement from a letter written by his grandfather during the First World War in which he says he would rather fight the French and describes German bravery:

Robert Graves who, like the King, also had German relatives, wrote shortly after the war during his time at Oxford University as an undergraduate that: 

====World War II====

In 1940, the Ministry of Information launched an &quot;Anger Campaign&quot; to instill &quot;personal anger ... against the German people and Germany&quot;, because the British were &quot;harbouring little sense of real personal animus against the average German&quot;. This was done to strengthen British resolve against the Germans. Sir Robert Vansittart, the Foreign Office&#x27;s chief diplomatic advisor until 1941, gave a series of radio broadcasts in which he said that Germany was a nation raised on &quot;envy, self-pity and cruelty&quot; whose historical development had &quot;prepared the ground for Nazism&quot; and that it was Nazism that had &quot;finally given expression to the blackness of the German soul&quot;.

The British Institute of Public Opinion (BIPO) tracked the evolution of anti-German/anti-Nazi feeling in Britain, asking the public, via a series of opinion polls conducted from 1939 to 1943, whether &quot;the chief enemy of Britain was the German people or the Nazi government&quot;. In 1939, only 6% of respondents held the German people responsible; however, following the Blitz and the &quot;Anger Campaign&quot; in 1940, this increased to 50%. This subsequently declined to 41% by 1943. It also was reported by Home Intelligence in 1942 that there was some criticism of the official attitude of hatred towards Germany on the grounds that such hatred might hinder the possibility of a reasonable settlement following the war.

This attitude was expanded upon by J.R.R. Tolkien. In 1944, he wrote in a letter to his son Christopher:

[I]t is distressing to see the press grovelling in the gutter as low as Goebbels in his prime, shrieking that any German commander who holds out in a desperate situation (when, too, the military needs of his side clearly benefit) is a drunkard, and a besotted fanatic. ... There was a solemn article in the local paper seriously advocating systematic exterminating of the entire German nation as the only proper course after military victory: because, if you please, they are rattlesnakes, and don&#x27;t know the difference between good and evil! (What of the writer?) The Germans have just as much right to declare the Poles and Jews exterminable vermin, subhuman, as we have to select the Germans: in other words, no right, whatever they have done.

In the same year Mass Observation asked its observers to analyse the British people&#x27;s private opinions of the German people and it found that 54% of the British population was &quot;pro-German&quot;, in that it expressed sympathy for the German people and stated that the war was &quot;not their fault&quot;. This tolerance of the German people as opposed to the Nazi regime increased as the war progressed. In 1943, Mass Observation established the fact that up to 60% of the British people maintained a distinction between Germans and Nazis, with only 20% or so expressing any &quot;hatred, vindictiveness, or need for retribution&quot;. The British film propaganda of the period similarly maintained the division between Nazi supporters and the German people.

=== United States ===

==== Pre-independence Era ====
In the Pennsylvania Colony during British America, Anglo-Americans held much anti-German sentiment. The sentiments against the Palatine settlers, commonly referred to as the Pennsylvania Dutch (or Pennsylvania Germans), were deeply rooted in cultural biases and economic competition. Anglo-Americans in the Pennsylvania Colony viewed the Palatines with suspicion and often derided their language, customs, and religious practices. The Palatines, predominantly German-speaking Protestants from the Palatinate region of present-day Germany, arrived in Pennsylvania seeking religious freedom and economic opportunities in the early 18th century. Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s complaints about the Palatine refugees in his work &quot;Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind (1751)&quot;: 
==== Post-independence Era ====

Pennsylvania was a major state and a former colony that saw an attraction and influence of German immigrants from the colonial era. A key event where German-Americans faced hardships was during the Fries&#x27;s Rebellion. The participants in Fries&#x27;s Rebellion were primarily German-speaking farmers, many of whom were recent immigrants or descendants of German immigrants. Their cultural and linguistic differences may have contributed to perceptions of them as outsiders or &quot;other&quot; by some in the broader American society. The rebellion was primarily a response to the federal government&#x27;s enforcement of a new direct tax, commonly known as the Direct Tax of 1798 or the House Tax. President John Adams granted pardons to Fries and several others who had been convicted of treason. Adams was motivated by the more specific constitutional interpretation of treason. He later remarked that the rebels were &quot;obscure, miserable Germans, as unfamiliar with our language as they were with our laws,&quot; and suggested that they were being manipulated by prominent figures in the opposing political party.

In the 19th century, the mass influx of German immigrants made them one of the largest European group of Americans by ancestry. This wave of migration triggered the formation of nativist and reactionary movements which were similar to those movements which exist in the contemporary Western world. These would eventually culminate in 1844 with the establishment of the American Party, which had an openly xenophobic stance. One of many incidents described in a 19th-century account included the blocking of a funeral procession in New York by a group who proceeded to hurl insults at the pallbearers. Incidents such as these led to more meetings of Germans who would eventually form fraternal groups such as the Sons of Hermann in 1840, which was founded as a means to &quot;improve and foster German customs and the spread of benevolence among Germans in the United States&quot;.

====World War I====


After the revelation of the Zimmermann Telegram partly sparked the American declaration of war against Imperial Germany in April 1917, German Americans were sometimes accused of being too sympathetic to Germany. Former president Theodore Roosevelt denounced &quot;hyphenated Americanism&quot;, while also insisting that dual loyalties were impossible.

A vocal source of criticism of Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s &quot;anti-hyphen&quot; ideology and particularly to their demands for &quot;100% Americanism&quot; came, quite understandably, from America&#x27;s enormous number of White ethnic immigrants and their descendants. Criticism from these circles occasionally argued that &quot;100% Americanism&quot; really meant Anglophilia and a Special Relationship with the British Empire, as particularly demonstrated by demands for tolerating only the English language in the United States. In a letter published on 16 July 1916 in the &quot;Minneapolis Journal&quot;, Edward Goldbeck, a member of Minnesota&#x27;s traditionally very large German-American community, sarcastically announced that his people would &quot;abandon the hyphen&quot;, as soon as English-Americans did so. Meanwhile, he argued, &quot;Let the exodus of Anglo-Americans start at once! Let all those people go who think that America is a new England!&quot;

A much smaller minority of German Americans came out openly for Germany. Similarly, Harvard psychology professor Hugo Münsterberg dropped his efforts to mediate between America and Germany, and threw his efforts behind the German war effort.

The Justice Department attempted to prepare a list of all German aliens, counting approximately 480,000 of them. The Committee of Internment of Alien Enemies recommended sending them to internment camps, though the idea was opposed by the War Department and the Attorney General. More than 4,000 German aliens were imprisoned in 1917–1918. The allegations included spying for Germany and endorsing the German war effort.

When the United States entered the war in 1917, some German Americans were looked upon with suspicion and attacked regarding their loyalty. Propaganda posters and newspaper commentary fed the growing fear. In Wisconsin, a Lutheran minister faced suspicion for hosting Germans in his home, while a language professor was tarred and feathered for having a German name and teaching the language. The Red Cross barred individuals with German last names from joining in fear of sabotage. One person was killed by a mob; in Collinsville, Illinois, German-born Robert Prager was dragged from jail as a suspected spy and lynched. Some aliens were convicted and imprisoned on charges of sedition for refusing to swear allegiance to the United States war effort. Thousands were forced to buy war bonds to show their loyalty.

In Chicago, Frederick Stock was forced to step down as conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra until he finalized his naturalization papers. Orchestras replaced music by German composer Wagner with French composer Berlioz. After xenophobic &quot;Providence Journal&quot; editor John R. Rathom falsely accused Boston Symphony Orchestra conductor Karl Muck of refusing to play &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; and triggered a trial by media in October 1917, Muck and 29 of the orchestra&#x27;s musicians were arrested and interned in Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, until well after the Armistice.

In Nashville, Tennessee, Luke Lea, the publisher of &quot;The Tennessean&quot;, together with &quot;political associates&quot;, &quot;conspired unsuccessfully to have the German-born Major Stahlman declared an &quot;alien enemy&quot; after World War I began.&quot; Stahlman was the publisher of a competing newspaper, the &quot;Nashville Banner&quot;.

The town, Berlin, Michigan, was renamed Marne, Michigan (in honor of those who fought in the Battle of the Marne). The town of Berlin, Shelby County, Ohio, changed its name to its original name of Fort Loramie, Ohio. The city of Germantown in Shelby County, Tennessee, temporarily changed its name to Neshoba during the war.

In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the offices of a pro-German socialist newspaper, the &quot;Philadelphia Tageblatt&quot;, were visited by federal agents after war broke out to investigate the citizenship status of its staff and would later be raided by federal agents under the powers of the Espionage Act of 1917, and six members of its organization would eventually be arrested for violations of the Espionage Act among other charges after publishing a number of pieces of pro-German propaganda.

German street names in many cities were changed. German and Berlin streets in Cincinnati became English and Woodward. In Chicago, Lubeck, Frankfort, and Hamburg Streets were renamed Dickens, Charleston, and Shakespeare Streets. In New Orleans, Berlin Street was renamed in honor of General Pershing, head of the American Expeditionary Force. In Indianapolis, Bismarck Avenue and Germania Street were renamed Pershing Avenue and Belleview Street, respectively in 1917, Brooklyn&#x27;s Hamburg Avenue was renamed Wilson Avenue.

Many businesses changed their names. In Chicago, German Hospital became Grant Hospital; likewise the German Dispensary and the German Hospital in New York City were renamed Lenox Hill Hospital and Wyckoff Heights Hospital respectively. In New York, the giant Germania Life Insurance Company became Guardian. At the US Customs House in Lower Manhattan, the word &quot;Germany&quot; on a shield held by one of the building&#x27;s many figures was chiseled over.

Many schools stopped teaching German-language classes. The City College of New York continued to teach German courses, but reduced the number of credits that students could receive for them. Books published in German were removed from libraries or even burned. In Cincinnati, the public library was asked to withdraw all German books from its shelves. In Iowa, in the 1918 Babel Proclamation, Governor William L. Harding prohibited the use of all foreign languages in schools and public places. Nebraska banned instruction in any language except English, but the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the ban was illegal in 1923 (&quot;Meyer v. Nebraska&quot;).

Some words of German origin were changed, at least temporarily. Sauerkraut came to be called &quot;liberty cabbage&quot;, German measles became &quot;liberty measles&quot;, hamburgers became &quot;liberty sandwiches&quot; and dachshunds became &quot;liberty pups&quot;.

In parallel with these changes, many German Americans elected to anglicize their names (e.g. Schmidt to Smith, Müller to Miller). Many state governments also sought to coercively limit the use of the German language in the United States in public places and most especially inside churches.

Ethnic German Medal of Honor winners were American USAAS ace pilots Edward Rickenbacker and Frank Luke; German-ethnicity DSC winners who also served with the USAAS in Europe included Joseph Frank Wehner and Karl John Schoen.

====World War II====
Between 1931 and 1940, 114,000 Germans and thousands of Austrians moved to the United States, many of whomincluding, e.g., Nobel prize winner Albert Einstein, Lion Feuchtwanger, Bertold Brecht, Henry Kissinger, Arnold Schoenberg, Hanns Eisler and Thomas Mannwere either Jewish Germans or anti-Nazis who were fleeing Nazi oppression. About 25,000 people became paying members of the pro-Nazi German American Bund during the years before the war. The Alien Registration Act of 1940 required 300,000 German-born resident aliens who had German citizenship to register with the Federal government and restricted their travel and property ownership rights. Under the still active Alien Enemy Act of 1798, the United States government interned nearly 11,000 German citizens between 1940 and 1948. An unknown number of &quot;voluntary internees&quot; joined their spouses and parents in the camps and were not permitted to leave. With the war ongoing in Europe but the U.S. neutral, a massive defense buildup took place, requiring many new hires. Private companies sometimes refused to hire any non-citizen, or American citizens of German or Italian ancestry. This threatened the morale of loyal Americans. President Franklin Roosevelt considered this &quot;stupid&quot; and &quot;unjust&quot;. In June 1941, he issued Executive Order 8802 and set up the Fair Employment Practice Committee, which also protected Black Americans.

President Roosevelt sought out Americans of German ancestry for top war jobs, including General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, and General Carl Andrew Spaatz. He appointed Republican Wendell Willkie as a personal representative. German Americans who had fluent German language skills were an important asset to wartime intelligence, and they served as translators and as spies for the United States. The war evoked strong pro-American patriotic sentiments among German Americans, few of whom by then had contacts with distant relatives in the old country.

The October 1939 seizure by the German pocket battleship &quot;Deutschland&quot; of the US freighter SS &quot;City of Flint&quot;, as it had 4000 tons of oil for Britain on board, provoked much anti-German sentiment in the US.

Following its entry into the War against Nazi Germany on 11 December 1941, the US Government interned a number of German and Italian citizens as enemy aliens. The exact number of German and Italian internees is a subject of debate. In some cases their American-born family members volunteered to accompany them to internment camps in order to keep the family unit together. The last to be released remained in custody until 1948.

In 1944, Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr. put forward the strongest proposal for punishing Germany to the Second Quebec Conference. It became known as the Morgenthau Plan, and was intended to prevent Germany from having the industrial base to start another world war. However this plan was shelved quickly, the Western Allies did not seek reparations for war damage, and the United States implemented the Marshall Plan that was intended to and did help West Germany&#x27;s post war recovery to its former position as a pre-eminent industrial nation.

===Post World War II===

In state-sponsored genocides, millions of people were murdered by Germans during World War II. That turned families and friends of the victims anti-German.
American General George S. Patton complained that the US policy of denazification following Germany&#x27;s surrender harmed American interests and was motivated simply by hatred of the defeated German people. Even the speed of West German recovery following the war was seen as ominous by some, who suspected the Germans of planning for World War III. In reality, most Nazi criminals were unpunished, such as Heinz Reinefarth, who was responsible for the Wola massacre. Many Nazis worked for the Americans as scientists (Wernher von Braun) or intelligence officers (Reinhard Gehlen).

==== Nakam ====

Nakam was a group of about fifty Holocaust survivors that in 1945 sought to kill Germans and Nazis in revenge for the murder of six million Jews during the Holocaust.

==== Flight and expulsion of Germans ====

After WWII ended, about 11 million to 12 million Germans fled or they were expelled from Germany&#x27;s former eastern provinces or they migrated from other countries to what remained of Germany, the largest transfer of a single European population in modern history. Estimates of the total number of dead range from 500,000 to 2,000,000, and the higher figures include &quot;unsolved cases&quot; of persons reported missing and presumed dead. Many German civilians were sent to internment and labor camps, where they died. Salomon Morel and Czesław Gęborski were the commanders of several camps for Germans, Poles and Ukrainians. The German-Czech Historians Commission, on the other hand, established a death toll for Czechoslovakia of 15,000–30,000. The events are usually classified as population transfer, or ethnic cleansing.

Felix Ermacora was one of a minority of legal scholars to equate ethnic cleansing with genocide, and stated that the expulsion of the Sudeten Germans was therefore genocide.

==== Forced labor of Germans ====

During the Allied occupation of Germany, Germans were used as forced laborers after 1945. Some of the laborers, depending on the country occupying, were prisoners of war or ethnic German civilians.

==Contemporary Europe==

After the separation into two countries after World War II, West Germany generally had good relationships with its western neighboring states (such as France and the Netherlands), and East Germany to some degree had similar relationships with its eastern neighbors (such as Poland). Many of the relationships continued after the end of the Cold War with the unified Germany. West Germany was a cofounder of the European Union and the reunified Germany continues as a leading member. During the process of European unification, Germany and France forged a strong relationship, ending the longstanding French–German enmity, which had peaked during and after World War I.

Much of today&#x27;s anti-German sentiment is particularly strong in East European countries occupied by Germany during the war and those that were at war with Germany and the other European Axis Powers.

Although views fluctuate somewhat in response to geopolitical issues such as Berlin&#x27;s refusal to support the invasion of Iraq, Washington regards modern Germany as an ally. Few Americans are strongly anti-German. Occasionally, Germans are stereotyped as being &quot;ruthlessly efficient&quot; and having no sense of humour in some parts of American media, as well as in the UK and other countries. Richard Wagner&#x27;s music was not performed in Israel until 1995 (radio) and 2001 (concert) and was for many years unpopular in Poland. That can be explained at least partially by Wagner&#x27;s anti-Semitism and the Nazi appropriation of Wagner&#x27;s music based on Hitler&#x27;s personal affection for his operas.

In a poll carried out in 2008 for the BBC World Service in which people in 34 countries were asked about the positive and negative influence of 13 countries, Germany was the most popular, ahead of Japan, France and Britain; only 18 percent across all countries surveyed thought Germany had a mainly negative influence. Mainly negative views were most widespread in Turkey (47 percent) and Egypt (43 percent).

In 2014, the BBC World Service published the &quot;Country Rating Poll&quot;, which included surveyed opinion from 24 participating countries concerning the influence of 16 countries and the European Union; 12 of the influential countries participated. Results were released at the end of May. The table shows the &quot;Views of Germany&#x27;s Influence&quot; overall (line 1) and by country. &quot;Germany has kept its position of the most favourably viewed nation in 2014.&quot; That is, Germany is the one whose influence is most commonly (60%) viewed positively; among the 17 Germany stands second to Canada as the ones least commonly (18%) viewed negatively. In the first ten polls, annual from 2005, Germany had been the country with world influence most commonly viewed positively at least in 2008 as well as 2013 and 2014.

An updated &quot;Country Rating Poll&quot; was published in 2017 by the BBC. Germany was the second-most positively-viewed country in the 2017 edition, with 59 per cent of respondents in the survey viewing Germany favourably. However, approximately 20 per cent of respondents had negative opinions about the country.

===United Kingdom===


Anti-German sentiment is a common theme in football culture among supporters of the England national football team. In fan gatherings around football matches between England and Germany, England fans will often sing anti-German football chants which associate football rivalry between England and Germany with historic military conflicts between the United Kingdom and the German Reich; &quot;Two World Wars and One World Cup&quot; links the military defeats of Germany in 1918 and 1945 with the defeat of West Germany in the 1966 FIFA World Cup, while &quot;Ten German Bombers&quot; makes reference to World War II Luftwaffe operations during the Battle of Britain. &quot;Ten German Bombers&quot; is now considered offensive and UEFA and the Football Association (FA) have banned England fans from singing the song.

In recent times much of the anti-German sentiment in football is exclusively within the England fanbase, both the Wales and Scotland national teams&#x27; fans have rarely exhibited any negative behaviour or chants during their meetings with the German team.

Postwar Era reconciliation was followed by the beginning of the Cold War, which led to Great Britain and West Germany both joining the NATO military alliance against and the Warsaw Pact. The BBC Television sitcom, &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; episode &quot;The Germans&quot; broadcast in 1975 satirized British obsession with World War II through Basil Fawlty&#x27;s infamous line, &quot;Don&#x27;t mention the war!&quot;. Basil&#x27;s panicked and offensive behaviour highlighted outdated British attitudes, with series co-creator John Cleese aiming to mock those clinging to the past rather than criticize Germans.

Similarly to Basil Fawlty, the modern British press sometimes still expresses anti-German sentiments and frequently resort to references to World War II and stereotypical associations equating the modern Federal Republic of Germany with Nazi Germany. These headlines, however, are frequently coupled with Eurosceptic views, express concerns about German domination over the rest of the European Union, most particularly in publications which favour Brexit.

According to a 2008 poll, the British people have a rather positive image of Germany, with 62 percent believing that Germany has a mainly positive influence in the world and only 20 percent believing that Germany&#x27;s influence is mainly negative, slightly better than Germans&#x27; views of Britain (60 percent and 27 percent, respectively).

===Poland===

Many Poles perceive Germans as their long-time oppressors. This notion is based on a long history of conflict with ethnic Poles, first by the German-language and culture Prussians then by the united German state, starting with three partitions of Poland, Germanization in the 19th and 20th centuries, and culminating in the Nazi Germany&#x27;s invasion of Poland in 1939 and the brutal occupation that followed.

Several issues have also strained recent Polish-German relations, although Poland and post-reunification Germany overall have had mostly positive relations. The proposed Russo-German pipeline through the Baltic Sea is seen by Poles as aimed at cutting off Poland&#x27;s natural gas supplies from Russia without damaging supply to Germany, and was even compared to the ignominious Molotov–Ribbentrop pact by Radosław Sikorski, Polish foreign minister.

Polish elections have repeatedly featured anti-German campaigns by the Law and Justice party, which is considered to use anti-German rhetoric as an effective tactic for winning votes.

===Netherlands===

Anti-German sentiment was already prevalent in the Netherlands centuries before the unification of Germany and establishment of imperial Germany, completed 1871. The Dutch are thought to have developed a low opinion of Germans during the first half of the 17th century, when the Republic saw a major spike in German immigrants including common laborers (so-called hannekemaaiers), persecuted Lutherans and Jews, and all sorts of war refugees fleeing the violence of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. A culture clash soon followed. It was likely around this time that the earliest variations of the word mof were first used to refer to German migrants. There are known joke books in which these Germans are featured prominently and stereotypically as arrogant and filthy. During the Second Boer War anti-German sentiment waned, as both countries were known supporters of the Boers, and allowed their citizens to volunteer to fight alongside them. During WWI (in which the Netherlands was neutral), the so-called Wire of Death, a lethal 2000 volts electric fence built along the southern Dutch border by the Germans occupying Belgium caused a large number of fatalities among the Dutch people, renewing anti-German sentiment in the Netherlands. This sentiment was reborn as hatred when, in 1940, Nazi Germany launched its invasion of the Netherlands despite earlier promises from Germany to respect Dutch neutrality. More than 100,000 Dutch Jews were deported to their deaths during the subsequent Nazi occupation, and starvation afflicted much of the country during the &quot;Hunger Winter&quot; of 1944–45. Most elderly Dutch people remember these events including the Rotterdam Blitz bitterly, and some still refuse to set foot on German soil.

A sociological study from 1998 showed that still two generations after it had ended, World War II remained influential, and &quot;present-day parents and young people are negatively biased against Germany.&quot; Aspeslagh and Dekker reported in 1998 that &quot;more than half of the cohort born after 1950 answered &#x27;sometimes&#x27; or
&#x27;often&#x27; when asked whether they harbored anti-German feelings&quot;. Reviewing three large-scale academic studies from the 1990s, they concluded:
:The emotional feelings regarding Germany and Germans revealed by these studies are defined by the Second World War. The annual commemorations of World War II, the way history lessons deal with Germany and the continual, casually negative remarks by adults reproduce the negative emotions about Germany and Germans, particularly among the young.

Newer studies also consistently show that Dutch anti-German sentiment has been falling steadily for years, and that most Dutch people today show a positive view towards both Germany and the German people.

===Switzerland===

Rapid increase of German immigration to Switzerland since 2000 has given rise to &quot;Germanophobia&quot; in German-speaking Switzerland.

===European debt crisis, Greece and Italy===

During the European debt crisis, many countries embarked on, or were arguably pushed into, austerity programs. Germany was blamed for the resulting economical, social and political consequences.

The Greek government-debt crisis and EU-driven austerity measures imposed on the country revived anti-German sentiments. The Greek media was making comments critical of the German policy, often mentioning, and drawing parallels with the Axis occupation of Greece, with some commentators emphasizing a genetic heritage from &quot;Goths&quot; or &quot;Huns&quot;. A poll in 2012 by VPRC noted the existence of an anti-German sentiment in Greece, and that the majority of the respondents connected Germany with negative notions such as &quot;Hitler&quot;, &quot;Nazism&quot; and &quot;3rd Reich&quot;.

A main argument has been that, despite its rhetoric, Germany made profits during the Greek debt crisis (due to falling borrowing rates – as Germany, along with other strong Western economies, was seen as a safe haven by investors during the crisis – investment influx, and exports boost due to the Euro&#x27;s depreciation, with estimates reaching 100bn Euros, as well as other profits through loans).
Another key issue, has been the claim for still owed War reparations, with estimates reaching 279b Euros.

In August 2012, Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti warned that escalating arguments over how to resolve the Euro debt crisis are turning countries against each other and threatening to rip Europe apart. Resentment in Italy is growing against Germany, the European Union and chancellor Merkel, he said, adding that &quot;the pressures already bear the traits of a psychological break-up of Europe&quot;.

A survey took place in the summer of 2017 among ten members of the EU. Most expressed scepticism about German influence on European matters; the Greeks (89%) express most of the skepticism followed by the Italians (69%) and the Spanish (68%). Greeks also come with the most negative opinion (84%) about Angela Merkel, and with the least positive opinion about the German people (24%), among the questioned ten states.

<text>David Ethan Graham (born November 10, 1981) is an American professional rock climber. Professing to enjoy bouldering the most, he is one of the elite sport climbers and boulderers of his generation. Graham repeats classic routes or boulder problems as well as performing cutting-edge first ascents. He is known for climbing in 2005 an graded boulder problem called &quot;The Story of Two Worlds&quot;, in Cresciano, Switzerland). He is also known for his stance against grade inflation and for his strong anti-chipping ethic. He writes an ongoing blog for the website of Climbing Magazine.

== Biography ==
Born in Maine, Graham was introduced to climbing in 1997 by one of his skiing teammates. Within a year, he climbed an route, &quot;The Present&quot;. Quickly, he became one of the strongest climbers in the United States, before moving to Europe in 2005.

In 2005, he climbed an boulder problem (&quot;The Story Of Two Worlds&quot;, Cresciano, Switzerland), and his first route (&quot;Coup de Grace&quot;, Val Bavona, Switzerland).

<doc id="913137" wikidata="Q1290306" url="?curid=913137" title="Tagish Lake">
<text>Tagish Lake is a lake in Yukon and northern British Columbia, Canada. The lake is long and averages wide with an area of , about two thirds of which is in British Columbia. The average depth is and maximum depth is .

It has two arms, the Taku Arm in the east which is very long and mostly in British Columbia and Windy Arm in the west, mostly in Yukon. The Klondike Highway runs along Windy Arm south of Carcross. Bennett Lake flows into Tagish Lake, so the northern portion of Tagish Lake was part of the route to the Klondike used by gold-seekers during the Klondike Gold Rush.

==The meteorite==
On January 18, 2000, a carbonaceous chondrite meteorite now known as &quot;Tagish Lake&quot;, fell on the frozen surface of the Taku Arm. A number of fragments were recovered and studied by researchers from the University of Calgary, University of Western Ontario, and NASA; the meteorite currently resides in the University of Alberta meteorite collection.

==The name==
The lake is named for the Tagish people. &quot;Tagish&quot; means &quot;fish trap&quot; in the Tagish language, an Athabascan language.
Other sources translate &quot;Tagish&quot; as &quot;it (spring ice) is breaking up&quot;.
==Fauna==
Tagish lies in the path of migratory swans that come every spring to wait out the melting of the more Northern Lakes.

Tagish is also home to the Southern Lakes with trophy fishing.

<doc id="913143" wikidata="Q1543785" url="?curid=913143" title="Launeddas">
<text>The launeddas (also called the Sardinian triple [[clarinet]]) are a traditional Sardinian woodwind instrument made of three pipes, each of which has an idioglot single reed. They are a polyphonic instrument, with one of the pipes functioning as a drone and the other two playing the melody in thirds and sixths.

Predecessors of the launeddas are found throughout Northern Africa and the Middle East. In 2700 BCE, the Egyptian reed pipes were originally called &quot;memet&quot;; during the Old Kingdom of Egypt (2778–2723 BCE), memets were depicted on the reliefs of seven tombs at Saqqara, six tombs at Giza, and the pyramids of Queen Khentkaus.

The Sardinian launeddas themselves are an ancient instrument, being traced back to at least the eighth century BCE, as is testified during the Nuragic civilization by an ithyphallic bronze statuette found in Ittiri. The launeddas are still played today during religious ceremonies and dances (&quot;su ballu&quot; in Sardinian language). Distinctively, they are played using extensive variations on a few melodic phrases, and a single piece can last over an hour, producing some of the &quot;most elemental and resonant (sounds) in European music&quot;.

==Description==

Launeddas are used to play a complex style of music by circular breathing that has achieved some international attention, especially Efisio Melis, Antonio Lara, Dionigi Burranca and Luigi Lai. Melis and Lara were the biggest stars of the 1930s golden age of launeddas, and each taught their style to apprentices like Lara&#x27;s Aureliu Porcu.

Launeddas consist of three reed pipes, two five-holed chanters of different lengths and one drone. They are played using circular breathing.

Since the late 20th century the launeddas have also been used in non-traditional contexts. In 1990, the American jazz saxophonist Dave Liebman released a CD called &quot;The Blessing of the Old. Long Sound&quot;, where he collaborates with the launeddas players Alberto Mariani, Carlo Mariani, and Dionigi Burranca. The CD was recorded in Milan in November 1989. In 1996, the British free jazz saxophonist Evan Parker released a double-CD collaboration with Carlo Mariani and other world musicians entitled &quot;Synergetics—Phonomanie III&quot;, which was recorded in Ulrichsberg, Austria in September 1993.

<doc id="913154" wikidata="Q161169" url="?curid=913154" title="Dasiphora fruticosa">
<text>Dasiphora fruticosa is a species of hardy deciduous flowering shrub in the family Rosaceae, native to the cool temperate and subarctic regions of the northern hemisphere, often growing at high altitudes in mountains. &quot;Dasiphora fruticosa&quot; is still widely referenced in the horticultural literature under its synonym Potentilla fruticosa. Common names include shrubby cinquefoil, golden hardhack, bush cinquefoil, shrubby five-finger, widdy, kuril tea and tundra rose.

==Description==
It grows to tall, rarely up to . The habit is variably upright to sprawling or prostrate, but stems are often ascending especially those stems with many long branches. The bark of older stems is shreddy with long thin strips. The plants are densely leafy, the leaves divided into five or seven (occasionally three or nine) pinnate leaflets. The leaflets are linear-oblong, long, with entire margins and more or less acute ends. The foliage (both leaves and young stems) is pubescent, variably covered in fine silky, silvery hairs about 1 mm long. The flowers are produced terminally on the stems and are cm across, buttercup-shaped, with five petals and 15–25 stamens; the petals are pale to bright yellow (orange to reddish in some western Chinese populations). The fruit is a cluster of achenes covered with long hairs. The species is variably dioecious or bisexual; flowering is typically from early to late summer. It is normally found growing in moisture-retentive soils in swamps and rocky areas.

The plant is usually only eaten by wildlife when other food sources are scarce, but the leaves of the plant may be boiled to make a tisane called kuril tea.

==Taxonomy==
Sources vary in the number of infraspecific taxa accepted. , the Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN) accepts two subspecies:
*&quot;Dasiphora fruticosa&quot; subsp. &quot;fruticosa&quot;. Described from Yorkshire, England and Öland, Sweden. Northern Europe (scattered, in Estonia, Great Britain, Ireland, Latvia, and Sweden) and northern and central Asia.
*&quot;Dasiphora fruticosa&quot; subsp. &quot;floribunda&quot; (syns. &quot;Potentilla floribunda&quot; , &quot;Dasiphora floribunda&quot; , &quot;Pentaphylloides floribunda&quot; ). Described from Canada, New York, and New Jersey, North America. Asia, southern Europe (Spain east to Bulgaria), and North America.

, Plants of the World Online does not recognize &quot;Dasiphora fruticosa&quot; subsp. &quot;floribunda&quot;, but does recognize a variety distinct from &quot;Dasiphora fruticosa&quot; var. &quot;fruticosa&quot;:
*&quot;Dasiphora fruticosa&quot; var. &quot;veitchii&quot; (syns &quot;Dasiphora veitchii&quot; , &quot;Potentilla arbuscula&quot; var. &quot;veitchii&quot; , &quot;Potentilla veitchii&quot; ), native to China (Sichuan, Yunnan)

Numerous other varieties have been described from Asia, some of which have not yet been published under the genus &quot;Dasiphora&quot;, and others in that genus only as distinct species. These include &quot;Potentilla fruticosa&quot; var. &quot;albicans&quot; Rehd. &amp; Wils., &quot;P. f.&quot; var. &quot;arbuscula&quot; (D.Don) Maxim. (syn. &quot;Dasiphora arbuscula&quot; (D.Don) Soják), &quot;P. f.&quot; var. &quot;dahurica&quot; (Nestl.) Ser. (syn. &quot;Dasiphora dahurica&quot; (Nestl.) Komarov), &quot;P. f.&quot; var. &quot;pumila&quot; J.D.Hooker, &quot;P. f.&quot; var. &quot;mandschurica&quot; (Maxim.) Wolf (syn. &quot;Dasiphora mandshurica&quot; (Maxim.) Juz.), and &quot;P. f.&quot; var. &quot;unifoliolata&quot; Ludlow (syn. &quot;Dasiphora unifoliolata&quot; (Ludlow) Soják). The varieties &quot;D. f.&quot; var. &quot;monticola&quot; Rydb. and &quot;D. f.&quot; var. &quot;tenuiloba&quot; Rydb. have been described from western North America, but are not widely accepted as distinct.

==Cultivation and decorative uses==

Shrubby cinquefoil is a popular ornamental plant in temperate regions. Different cultivars are variable with flowers ranging from white to yellow, orange and pink, but they are all hardy plants that produce flowers for much of the summer. The flowers are always small, flat, and round, but there are many dozens on each bush. It is very often used by cities and businesses for landscaping because of its hardiness and low maintenance. It was introduced into cultivation in the 18th century, but many of the modern cultivars, particularly those with orange or red flowers, derive from collections by Reginald Farrer in western China in the early 20th century. The vast majority of sellers and gardeners still use the old name &quot;Potentilla fruticosa&quot;.

All the characteristics of small leaves, delicate flowers, and orange to brown flaky bark make the shrubby cinquefoil suitable for Bonsai. It is very popular in Japan and is gaining popularity in Europe.

<text>Sara Lynn Evans (; born February 5, 1971) is an American country music singer and songwriter. She is also credited as a record producer, actress, and author. She had five songs reach the number one spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country songs chart and has sold over six million albums. Nine additional singles have reached the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart, including &quot;I Could Not Ask for More&quot;, &quot;I Keep Looking&quot;, and &quot;Cheatin&#x27;&quot;. Among her top 20 charting singles are &quot;Saints &amp; Angels&quot;, &quot;Backseat of a Greyhound Bus&quot;, and &quot;As If&quot;. She has won accolades from the Academy of Country Music and the Country Music Association. She has also been nominated for several more accolades from both associations, including Female Vocalist of the Year and Single of the Year.

Evans grew up in New Franklin, Missouri, and started performing alongside her siblings in The Evans Family Band. The group performed throughout her childhood and early teenage years in her local area. During her teenage years, Evans and her older brother Matt formed their own band before moving to Nashville in 1991 to pursue a country music career. In Nashville, Evans met her first husband Craig Schelske and briefly moved to Aumsville, Oregon, before returning to Nashville. Upon moving back to Nashville, Evans found work as a demo singer, which led to her signing a recording contract with RCA Records. Her first album &quot;Three Chords and the Truth&quot; was released in 1997. It was followed by &quot;No Place That Far&quot; (1998), whose second single of the same name topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart.

Evans reached her peak success in the 2000s with the albums &quot;Born to Fly&quot; (2000), &quot;Restless&quot; (2003) and &quot;Real Fine Place&quot; (2005). The discs sold over one million copies each and included the number one country singles &quot;Born to Fly&quot;, &quot;Suds in the Bucket&quot; and &quot;A Real Fine Place to Start&quot;. In 2006, Evans appeared as a contestant on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; before subsequently dropping out. Evans took steps back from her recording career to focus on her family life, only releasing a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; package in 2008. She re-launched her career in 2011 with her sixth studio album &quot;Stronger&quot;. It was supported by the two-week number one single &quot;A Little Bit Stronger&quot;. After the release of &quot;Slow Me Down&quot; (2014), Evans left RCA and formed her own record label. In 2017, she released her first album through the label, &quot;Words&quot;.

==Early life==
Sara Lynn Evans was born in Boonville, Missouri, on February 5, 1971. She was raised in New Franklin, Missouri by parents Pat and Jack Evans. She was one of seven children (which also included her half siblings after her mother remarried). The Evans family was raised on a 400-acre farm that included several crops and livestock. To make ends meet, her mother became a school bus driver while her father became a pressman for the &quot;Columbia Daily Tribune&quot; newspaper. Evans&#x27;s family discovered she had a natural singing ability after she started singing along with her two older brothers who were taking guitar lessons. This prompted Evans&#x27;s mother to put her siblings into a band which they later called The Evans Family Band. Evans started performing lead vocals in the band when she was six years old. She later learned to perform guitar, mandolin, and drums.

Evans was raised on a farm in New Franklin. When she was eight years old, Evans was hit by a car after crossing the highway that faced her family&#x27;s farm. She was thrown onto the hood of the car and eventually landed in a grassy field along the highway. She had suffered a concussion and a leg injury. Due to the severity of her injuries, Evans was sent to the University of Missouri Hospital, located 30 miles from her hometown. To avoid having a deformed left leg, doctors had to drill pins into Evans&#x27;s knee. She was unable to move from her hospital bed for six weeks. According to Evans, the accident itself and being tied to the hospital bed resulted in her having post-traumatic stress disorder. &quot;I had severe PTSD and anxiety, but it was the &#x27;80s, and I didn&#x27;t have a name for it,&quot; she explained.

In 1983, Evans&#x27;s parents divorced. Her mother remarried in 1985 and the couple had two more children (Evans&#x27;s half sisters). After her mother remarried, the family moved to a tobacco farm, also located in New Franklin. The Evans Family Band continued performing as well. The group often performed on weekends and later had a manager. When she was about ten years old, Evans recorded a song called &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Be the Only Female Fiddle Player in Charlie Daniels Band&quot;. She then traveled to Nashville alongside her manager to promote the song at Fan Fair. Evans later performed on a local program called Country Stampede and briefly formed a band with her brother Matt. In 1989, Evans graduated high school. She accepted a full scholarship to study music at Central Methodist University in Fayette, Missouri. However, she left after one semester once realizing she wanted to pursue a country music career. She returned to her mother&#x27;s New Franklin farm where she got a job at the Holiday Inn as a waitress. With the money saved from waiting tables, Evans and her brother Matt moved to Nashville in 1991.

After moving to Nashville, Evans got a job waiting tables during the breakfast shift at another Holiday Inn restaurant. At the restaurant she would meet her first husband who was also a waiter at the Holiday Inn. The couple started dating and temporarily moved to Aumsville, Oregon, in 1992. In Oregon, she performed billed as Sara Evans &amp; North Santiam. The couple married while in Oregon and spent three years there before returning to Nashville in the mid-1990s. Through her lawyer, Evans got a job as a demo singer. Among the demos she recorded was a cover of Buck Owens&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Tiger by the Tail&quot;, which was originally intended to be sent to Patty Loveless. Her demo was heard by Nashville songwriter Harlan Howard who was impressed by Evans&#x27;s traditional country singing style. Howard convinced executives at RCA Records to hear Evans sing. In a live audition for RCA executive Joe Galante, Evans sang three songs. The same day, Evans was offered a recording contract from RCA Records. She accepted and signed a seven-album deal with the label.

==Career==
===1997–1999: &quot;Three Chords and the Truth&quot; and early success===

Evans quit her job following the signing of her contract. She chose to have her album produced by Pete Anderson, a producer and guitarist best known for his work with Dwight Yoakam. To record the album, she moved to Los Angeles. In July 1997, &quot;Three Chords and the Truth&quot; was released on RCA. The album&#x27;s sound centered around traditional honky tonk country and drew critical acclaim. Allmusic&#x27;s James Chrispell positively commented, &quot;This disc rings out with an air of originality helped along by great tunes and solid backup musicianship.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; commented, &quot;At once a preserver of the best of country&#x27;s history and a progressive writer and singer forging a timeless contemporary country sound, she invites favorable comparisons to the best country divas.&quot; However, the album was not commercially successful. The disc peaked at number 56 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums chart. Its three singlesin order of release, True Lies, the title track, and &quot;Shame About That&quot;peaked outside the &quot;Billboard&quot; country songs top 40. According to Evans, country radio refused to play the singles, claiming they were &quot;too country&quot;. &quot;It was the most disheartening experience of my life–at least to this point,&quot; she reflected in her memoir.

In an effort to have commercial success, Evans went back into the studio to record her next album. She intended to cut an album that was contemporary yet &quot;without compromising&quot; her musical interests. The result was &quot;No Place That Far&quot;, released in October 1998 on RCA. The project peaked at number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums chart. While its lead single (&quot;Cryin&#x27; Game&quot;) peaked outside the country top 40, its second single (the title track) reached the number one spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country songs chart. Its success was due to the buy-in from country radio programmers who were invited to a private showcase of her new repertoire in Cincinnati, Ohio. &quot;By the end of the show, they were all eating out of my hands and singing my praises,&quot; Evans recounted. The album&#x27;s final single &quot;Fool, I&#x27;m a Woman&quot; only reached number 32 on the country songs chart, which disappointed Evans. &quot;It felt like I was constantly starting over, like in &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;, with these people at country radio,&quot; she commented. To rebuild career momentum, Evans hired a co-manager. Evans also discovered she was pregnant with her first child during this time. This caused friction with her record label who encouraged her to &quot;lose the baby weight as soon as possible&quot;.

===2000–2005: Peak success===
Evans was motivated to make shifts in her career after watching Faith Hill&#x27;s &quot;Breathe&quot; music video. &quot;I&#x27;m going to lose this weight, grow my hair long, and make the best album Nashville has ever heard,&quot; she recounted. She was drawn to the bluegrass sound by Dixie Chicks and sought out their producer, Paul Worley. She also sought out rock session musician Matt Chamberlain to play drums. Together, they would craft Evans&#x27;s third studio album. In October 2000, &quot;Born to Fly&quot; was released on RCA Nashville. Evans co-produced the project with Worley. The disc became Evans&#x27;s breakout album, certifying double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of over two million copies in the United States. Critic Thom Jurek took notice of the record. He described Evans as having the &quot;confidence and authority of a seasoned veteran who is in control of her work.&quot; &quot;Born to Fly&quot; peaked at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums chart and number 55 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.
Four singles were released from &quot;Born to Fly&quot;. First was the title track, which Evans co-wrote with Darrell Scott and Marcus Hummon. This reached the number one spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country singles chart and number 34 on the Hot 100. Next was a cover of Edwin McCain&#x27;s &quot;I Could Not Ask for More&quot;, followed by &quot;Saints &amp; Angels&quot; and &quot;I Keep Looking&quot;, the latter a top-five country hit in 2002. In 2001, Evans received five nominations from the Country Music Association Awards. This included Female Vocalist of the Year and Album of the Year. She later won Music Video of the Year for &quot;Born to Fly&quot;″s title track. The Academy of Country Music Awards also nominated her for Top Female Vocalist. With her new success, Evans joined Reba McEntire, Martina McBride, Jamie O&#x27;Neal, and Carolyn Dawn Johnson on the all-women headlining Girls Night Out Tour in 2001.

In August 2003, her fourth studio album &quot;Restless&quot; was released, with Evans and Worley continuing to co-produce. &quot;Restless&quot; was met with mixed reviews. Writer Edward Morris described it as being &quot;more pop than country in sound and attitude&quot;. James Christopher Monger found it to be &quot;slick and predictable&quot;. &quot;Restless&quot; debuted at number three on the Top Country Albums chart reached number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and certified platinum in the United States. While the lead single &quot;Backseat of a Greyhound Bus&quot;, reached the top 20, its second single, &quot;Perfect&quot;, climbed to the number two spot on &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart. The album&#x27;s third single was the traditionally-sounding &quot;Suds in the Bucket&quot;. The song was not intended to be part of the project&#x27;s track list but Evans pushed for its inclusion. It became her third number one song on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart. The fourth and final single &quot;Tonight&quot; was less successful, peaking outside the top 40 of Hot Country Songs in 2005. Evans was subsequently nominated for several awards by the Academy of Country Music in both 2003 and 2004 She received similar nominations from the Country Music Association. In 2004, she co-headlined the Mud &amp; Suds Tour with Brad Paisley.

In 2005, Evans released a cover of Radney Foster&#x27;s &quot;A Real Fine Place to Start&quot;. It became her fourth number one song on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country survey and her fourth song to reach the Top 40 on Hot 100. It would serve as the title track to her fifth studio album &quot;Real Fine Place&quot;, which was released in October 2005. Unlike her previous albums, Evans co-produced with Mark Bright. Sue Keough of BBC called it &quot;the perfect balance between radio-friendly country pop and the rootsy sounds she offered with her 1997 debut &quot;Three Chords And The Truth&quot;.&quot; Meanwhile, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;&#x27;s Jonathan Keefe gave it 2.5 stars, calling its notoriety in her catalog &quot;less than essential&quot;. Despite mixed reviews, the disc was her first to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums chart. It also debuted at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Like its predecessors, it also certified platinum in sales. &quot;Real Fine Place&quot; also included the single &quot;Cheatin&#x27;&quot;, which reached the number nine spot on the country chart. While the follow-up single &quot;Coalmine&quot; faltered on the charts, follow-up &quot;You&#x27;ll Always Be My Baby&quot; reached number 13 in 2006. She would also win the Top Female Vocalist award from the Academy of Country Music.

===2006–2009: Setbacks and music hiatus===

By 2006, Evans had reached the height of her career. She was headlining her own tours, and made almost 300 appearances in one year. In August of that year, Evans joined the cast of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; which aired on the ABC network. She made her first appearance on the show in September alongside dancing partner Tony Dovolani. Evans moved her family to Beverly Hills, California where the show rented her a home while she competed on the program. &quot;It was absolutely exhausting and totally invigorating at the same time,&quot; she reflected in her memoir. At the same time, Evans&#x27;s marriage to husband Craig Schelske was ending. The stress in her personal life caused Evans to suffer from anxiety and panic attacks. A month following her first appearance, she announced her departure from the show after filing for divorce from Schelske. &quot;I had to quit working altogether, focus on my children, and really figure out what I was going to do,&quot; she later explained.

Evans&#x27;s divorce received widespread media attention between 2006 and 2007. These personal events delayed plans for the recording of a studio album for several years. However Evans did continue to sporadically release new music. In 2007, RCA released her first compilation album of &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;. The project reached number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums chart and number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The disc featured twelve of her most popular recordings, along with four new tracks co-written by Evans. AllMusic&#x27;s Thom Jurek gave the album three stars, criticizing its production and choice of material. Three of its new songs were released as singles. Its lead single &quot;As If&quot; reached number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country songs chart. It was followed by the top 40 entry &quot;Some Things Never Change&quot;. Later that year, she co-hosted the Country Music Association Awards.

In May 2008, Evans appeared on &quot;CMT Crossroads&quot;, a music show on CMT which paired country music artists with pop music artists for collaborative performance. On her episode, she collaborated with pop band Maroon 5 to sing songs from both artists&#x27; catalogs. In September 2008, Evans recorded the theme song to film &quot;&quot;. Released as a single, &quot;Low&quot; briefly charted on the Hot Country Songs chart. In June 2009, ABC Daytime and SOAPnet sponsored a tour, headlined by Evans, that featured performances throughout the middle of the year. Evans&#x27;s next single was &quot;Feels Just Like a Love Song&quot;, which only peaked at number 59 on the country songs chart. She ended 2009 by releasing an extended play of Christmas music titled &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Home for Christmas&quot;. The release coincided with a two-month holiday tour.

===2010–2015: Comeback and career re-launch with &quot;Stronger&quot;===
In 2010, Evans collaborated with author Rachel Hauck to write &quot;The Sweet By and By&quot;. Its follow up book, &quot;Softly and Tenderly&quot;, was released in January 2011. Both novels focused on Christian themes and the main characters explored their religious relationships. Evans also returned to music in 2011. She enlisted record producer Nathan Chapman to help re-launch her career. Evans also started searching for material and eventually found the song &quot;A Little Bit Stronger&quot;. The song was co-written by Lady Antebellum lead singer Hillary Scott, who allowed Evans to record the song after that band did not cut it. It was issued as a single in 2010 and topped the Hot Country Songs chart in 2011. &quot;A Little Bit Stronger&quot; became her first number one single since 2005 and spent two weeks at the top. It was released on Evans&#x27;s corresponding sixth studio album, &quot;Stronger&quot;. The album debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums list and number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Stronger&quot; later certified gold in the United States.
In mid-2011, Evans served as the opening act for Rascal Flatts on their Flatts Fest tour. The duo continued touring through 2012. Also in 2011, &quot;A Little Bit Stronger&quot; was nominated for Single of the Year by the Country Music Association Awards. The program also nominated Evans for Female Vocalist of the Year. The Academy of Country Music Awards also nominated Evans for Female Vocalist of the Year in 2011.

Evans felt pressure to sustain the commercial success from her comeback. &quot;I&#x27;ve worked my ass off,&quot; she told &quot;Country Music Television&quot;. Evans had hoped to have &quot;two or three big hits&quot; off of &quot;Stronger&quot;. The follow-up single, a cover of Rod Stewart&#x27;s &quot;My Heart Can&#x27;t Tell You No&quot;, only reached number 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart. It was followed by a third single, &quot;Anywhere&quot;, which peaked outside the top 40 in 2012. Evans also released her third novel in 2012 titled &quot;Love Lifted Me&quot;. The book was co-written again with Rachel Hauck and followed a similar story to that of her previous book releases. Evans also sang the National Anthem at Game two of the 2012 NBA Finals. Evans also sang the National Anthem at the start of Game 2 of the 2015 World Series between the Kansas City Royals and the New York Mets.

In November 2012, Evans went back into the recording studio alongside Mark Bright to prepare for her next album project. A year later RCA released the single &quot;Slow Me Down&quot;. According to Evans, the single required more promotion due to the popularity of Bro-country which had taken chart positions away from women. &quot;I did something like forty-four free shows that year, on top of my regular touring dates,&quot; her memoir recalled. Nevertheless, &quot;Slow Me Down&quot; peaked in the top 20, climbing to number 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country songs chart and number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country Airplay chart. Her seventh album of the same name was released in March 2014 on RCA. The album reached number two on the Country Albums list and number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It was named among the &quot;Best of 2014&quot; in AllMusic&#x27;s year-end ranking and ranked number ten on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Best Country Albums of 2014&quot;.

In October 2014, Evans appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Nashville&quot;, playing herself. She performed a duet version of her next single, &quot;Put My Heart Down&quot;, with Will Chase, who performed in-character as Luke Wheeler. Evans herself helped inspire the creation of the series lead Rayna Jaymes, as the writers consulted with her about her experiences as a working mother in the country music industry so that Rayna&#x27;s character would come across as authentic. In November 2014, Evans released her first full studio album of Christmas music titled &quot;At Christmas&quot;. The project featured covers of Christmas songs along with original tunes. She later promoted the project on ABC&#x27;s annual &quot;CMA Country Christmas&quot; television special. In August 2015, Evans made a second appearance on &quot;CMT Crossroads&quot;, this time performing alongside rock band REO Speedwagon.

===2016–present: New record label and career transition===
After spending her entire recording career on RCA, Evans left the label in February 2016. Six months later, she announced that she would be signing a contract with Sugar Hill Records. However the label underwent a restructuring and Evans ultimately decided to leave the contract. In the same year, Evans appeared on the season finale of USA Network&#x27;s &quot;Chrisley Knows Best&quot;. She performed a new track called &quot;Infinite Love&quot;. The song was a duet with one of the show&#x27;s cast members, Todd Chrisley. A recording by the pair appeared in 2016 that charted in the top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart. Evans and several of her siblings also competed against the Chrisley family on the 2016 season finale of ABC&#x27;s game show &quot;Celebrity Family Feud&quot;.

Evans had become increasingly frustrated with the country radio&#x27;s lack of support for female artists. &quot;No one seemed to respect all my previous success that I&#x27;d worked years to achieve,&quot; she recalled in her memoir. The frustration prompted Evans to launch her own label titled Born to Fly Records. Sony RED partnered with the label to distribute the company&#x27;s music. &quot;Now I&#x27;m in the driver&#x27;s seat, and every decision is made between my managers and me,&quot; she commented. The label released &quot;Words&quot;, her ninth studio record, in July 2017. All fourteen of the album&#x27;s tracks included credits from female songwriters. AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine commented that, &quot;&quot;Words&quot; offers a sharp and welcome contrast to the bustling digital era.&quot; Mark Kennedy of the &quot;Associated Press&quot; praised the album and concluded, &quot;Artistic freedom has never sounded so good.&quot; &quot;Words&quot; peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums chart and number 46 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Despite heavy promotion, its lead single (&quot;Marquee Sign&quot;) failed to make a chart appearance.

In 2019, Evans collaborated with her son and daughter to release an EP named &quot;The Barker Family Band&quot;. The project featured harmonies from Evans and her children performing covers of songs by Aretha Franklin and Fleetwood Mac. A corresponding live album was recorded at City Winery in Nashville. Both projects were promoted through a mini tour that included five show dates in May 2019. In May 2020, Evans released her tenth studio project titled &quot;Copy That&quot;. The project was a collection of classic country and pop covers from different decades. The album received mixed reviews. AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine commented, &quot;&quot;Copy That&quot; is a clever title for a covers album, but it also raises the question of whether these new cover versions are mere Xeroxes of the original.&quot; Meanwhile, Jeffrey B. Remz of &quot;Country Standard Time&quot; found it to be &quot;just too syrupy&quot; in his review. In September 2020, Evans released a memoir that discussed highlights from her life and career. The book was published by Howard Books.

In 2023, Evans competed in season nine of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Mustang&quot;. She was eliminated during the season premiere alongside Dick Van Dyke as &quot;Gnome&quot;. During this time, Evans stated that she started working on her next studio album that resembled neotraditional country sound. In 2023, Evans signed with Melody Place Records. The same year she accepted an invitation to become an official member of the Grand Ole Opry. Her first Melody Place album was issued in June 2024 titled &quot;Unbroke&quot;. The project chronicled her marital conflicts and reconciliation with her second husband. The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Pride&quot; was issued in March 2024. Evans also created her own podcast titled &quot;Diving in Deep with Sara Evans&quot; which was also released in spring 2024.

==Artistry==
===Musical styles===
Evans has embedded different styles of country music into her songs throughout her career. In her early career, Evans incorporated a traditional country sound on the albums &quot;Three Chords and the Truth&quot; and &quot;No Place That Far&quot;. Box Paxman explained, &quot;Evans was hailed for her neo-traditional vocal style and obvious respect for country&#x27;s past&quot;. When Evans released 2000&#x27;s &quot;Born to Fly&quot;, her sound shifted towards a contemporary country musical identity. &quot;&quot;Born to Fly&quot; marks an uptown shift in Evans&#x27; musical landscape. With Worley at the helm, the singer has made a much more contemporary record than her previous outings,&quot; commented Lisa Young of &quot;CMT&quot;. Thom Jurek from AllMusic noted a similar theme while reviewing the disc: &quot;&quot;Born to Fly&quot; emphasizes the more contemporary sounds on the recording, while placing some of the rootsy bluegrass back in the mix.&quot;
When the genre shifted back to a traditional country style, Evans followed suit with 2005&#x27;s &quot;Real Fine Place&quot;. Writer Jacquilynne Schlesier found Evans to be a &quot;natural choice to lead the parade&quot; considering the acclaim she received from her debut album. Critic Johnny Loftus also found a traditional element to her 2005 transition, commenting that, &quot;&quot;Real Fine Place&quot; is sure to lure traditional country fans with Evans&#x27; rich vocal presence and the album&#x27;s assertion that the simplest things in life are its truest.&quot;

As the genre shifted towards a pop and rock-inspired sound, Evans&#x27;s music also made the shift. In his review of 2011&#x27;s &quot;Stronger&quot;, Jurek highlighted how Evans was attentive to the changing trends: &quot;Contemporary country music has undergone a tumultuous shift in terms of its production style and songwriting trends. Though her life experiences--good and bad--have kept her from recording, Evans reveals here she&#x27;s been paying close attention.&quot; Ken Tucker of &quot;NPR&quot; found Evans to have fondness for pop and that she found more confidence singing it her later career: &quot;It&#x27;s undeniable that on her last album, 2011&#x27;s &quot;Stronger&quot;, and this new one [2014&#x27;s] &quot;Slow Me Down&quot;, Evans has located a new undercurrent of steely firmness that has only strengthened her singing.&quot; After leaving RCA Records, Evans began experimenting with other musical styles, particularly on the 2020 album &quot;Copy That&quot;. Reflecting on her current musical style, Evans commented, &quot;For the first time in my career, I felt like I didn&#x27;t have to stay in any certain genre&quot;. When promoting her eleventh album &quot;Unbroke&quot;, Evans cited a desire to return to more traditional country sounds and lyrics.

===Voice===
Writers and critics have highlighted the power of Evans&#x27;s voice. Ken Tucker of &quot;NPR&quot; commented, &quot;Sara Evans is a singer with a big voice who knows what to do with it. Her phrasing is conversational; she rarely tries to goose the emotion in a song by stretching out syllables or leaping registers.&quot; In reviewing a live show, Emily Yahr of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described Evans as having a &quot;crystal-clear powerhouse twang.&quot; Other journalists have noted that Evans&#x27;s singing has a specific identity. AllMusic&#x27;s John Bush described her as having &quot;an instantly recognizable contralto&quot; while &quot;The Boot&quot; wrote, &quot;Evans has built a hugely successful career on the strength of her song choices, as well as her readily identifiable voice.&quot;

==Personal life==
===First marriage, children and divorce===
Evans married Craig Schelske in 1993. At the time of their marriage, Schelske was an aspiring musician. In 2002, Schelske ran for congress in the fifth district in his home state of Oregon as a Republican candidate. After Evans became commercially successful, the couple moved into a home located in Franklin, Tennessee. They also had a residence outside Aumsville, Oregon, and a residence in Missouri. In 1999, Evans gave birth to their first son, Avery Jack. She had a daughter named Olivia Margaret in 2003, and a second daughter named Audrey Elizabeth one year later. Evans&#x27;s children are also musical; both Avery and Olivia have performed in her touring band, the former as a guitarist and the latter as a vocalist. Her daughter released her first music in 2021 while her son currently tours as part of Thomas Rhett&#x27;s band.

After her 2006 departure from &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, it was disclosed that Evans had filed for divorce from Schelske. In court documents, Evans accused Schelske of unemployment, alcoholism, infidelity, watching adult entertainment with their children present, maintaining sexually explicit photographs of himself and others, and verbal abuse. Schelske denied all of his wife&#x27;s claims. He explained that the &quot;interrupted adult entertainment viewing&quot; was inadvertent and involved both Schelske and Evans. Schelske also claimed that his explicit photograph collection was limited to images of the married couple, and counterclaimed that Evans had numerous personal problems. Schelske accused Evans of having multiple affairs with fellow musicians, including Kenny Chesney. A representative for Chesney called the allegations &quot;ridiculous&quot;.

On September 28, 2007, the divorce between Evans and Schelske became final. The divorce agreement established a joint custody plan for their three children, a split of marital assets, and an alimony agreement where Evans would pay Schelske at least $500,000 over 10 years. Subsequently, Evans&#x27; ex-nanny sued her for $3 million, claiming that Evans had smeared her name by accusing her of an affair with Schelske. The lawsuit was settled in July 2009 for $500,000. Following their divorce, Evans obtained two temporary restraining orders against Schelske in 2010 and 2011, restricting him from making any derogatory statements to the media about Evans or their former marriage.

Schelske also sued Evans&#x27;s Nashville attorney John Hollins Sr. and his firm (Hollins, Wagster, Yarbrough, Weatherly &amp; Raybin, P.C.) for &quot;slander, false light and other damages&quot; after Hollins gave an October 2006 interview to &quot;People&quot; magazine regarding Evans&#x27; divorce claims. That lawsuit resulted in an undisclosed financial settlement and a written apology from Hollins in 2011, which stated in part: &quot;My firm and I represented Sara Evans in a highly contested divorce from Craig Schelske... to the best of my ability. I regret that my actions on behalf of Sara Evans caused Mr. Schelske harm in any way.&quot; Schelske issued a public statement thanking God, family, and friends for staying alongside during the period, and stating: &quot;Sara is not my enemy... Hollins... he&#x27;s the one who did this.&quot;
===Second marriage===
Through her marriage counselor, Evans would meet her second husband Jay Barker. The pair first began exchanging emails in 2007 and started a romantic relationship shortly afterward. Barker was a former University of Alabama quarterback, and at the time of their meeting was a radio host. The pair married on June 14, 2008, in Franklin; their children were their attendants. Barker shared custody of four children with his ex-wife, which would total to seven kids when both families were present. &quot;We are truly a family. We don&#x27;t think of it as &#x27;blended&#x27;; they are just our kids. But we also understand our roles. If I&#x27;m around when Sara&#x27;s kids&#x27; father is around, I give him his place as their dad,&quot; Barker explained in 2011. The family later settled in Mountain Brook, Alabama, which is a suburb of Birmingham.

In 2019, the family returned to Nashville so that Evans could live in closer proximity to the country music business. On January 15, 2022, Barker was arrested for aggravated assault, after he allegedly attempted to use his car to hit Evans while she was a passenger in a friend&#x27;s car after leaving a party. The arrest affidavit has the couple listed as separated, and that Evans had filed for divorce prior to the incident in August 2021, citing &quot;irreconcilable differences and inappropriate marital conduct&quot;. Barker responded on social media to his arrest claiming that the reports &quot;do not adequately capture the full context and complex fabric of our lives&quot;. Barker was released from the Davidson County Jail on a $10,000 bond and was scheduled for a court appearance in March 2022. In June 2022, Barker entered a plea deal and was sentenced to a year of probation. Around that time, a divorce between Evans and Barker was &quot;in progress&quot;, according to &quot;Billboard&quot;. 

In March 2024 interview, Evans stated that the couple had reconciled and are now living together again. She stated that both of them had been in therapy together (and separately) to work on their relationship. Evans expressed anxiety around how people would view her getting back together with Barker and stressed that her decision to stay with him was not meant as a prescription for any relationship facing similar circumstances.

===Personal setbacks and challenges===
Evans has suffered from panic attacks and anxiety during different points in her life. In her memoir, Evans described having a &quot;meltdown&quot; in December 2005 once realizing her first marriage was ending. She recounted having &quot;terrifying thoughts&quot; of being kidnapped and losing control of herself. For ten days, Evans refused to leave her Nashville home and was afraid to &quot;walk from one room to another&quot;. She was also briefly brought into the hospital and was diagnosed with &quot;exhaustion&quot;. Evans found solace in her Christian faith and began working with a pastor who helped her gain control of her mental health. &quot;He encouraged me to just stay home for the time being and get rest and let God do the rest,&quot; she remembered. Evans also met with a doctor who prescribed her anti-anxiety medication.

In December 2012, Evans was nearly killed in a plane crash in Minnesota. Following a successful takeoff, the aircraft&#x27;s gyroscope malfunctioned, causing her private plane to fly upside down. &quot;I knew we had not been in the air long, so we were probably seconds from dying. I completely accepted it. It was so strange and peaceful,&quot; her memoir recalled. The pilots were able to recenter the plane despite its one wing breaking. The pilots then made an emergency landing in Fargo, North Dakota.

===Advocacy===
Evans is a spokesperson for the National Eating Disorders Association and has spoken out widely on this subject. She was influenced to become their spokesperson after having a close friend suffer from anorexia. &quot;Thankfully, I have never suffered from an eating disorder but am well aware of our society’s obsession with body image,&quot; she told &quot;CMT&quot;. She also hosted a charity event, Fashion for Every Body, which featured a fashion show, silent auction and performance by Evans. A libertarian Republican, Evans also showed support for Texas Congressman Ron Paul in the 2008 Presidential election and was the headliner at his &quot;Rally For The Republic&quot; on September 2, 2008, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the same day as the Republican National Convention in neighboring St. Paul.

<text>Berkeley Square is a 1933 American pre-Code fantasy drama film produced by Fox Film Corporation, directed by Frank Lloyd, and starring Leslie Howard and Heather Angel. It recounts the tale of young American Peter Standish, played by Howard (nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor), who, explained by S.T. Joshi, is a &quot;portrayal of a man of the 20th century who somehow merges his personality with that of his 18th-century ancestor.&quot; The film was based on the play of the same name by John L. Balderston, itself loosely based on Henry James&#x27; incomplete 1917 novel, &quot;The Sense of the Past.&quot; The play premiered in London in 1926. Howard played Standish in the hugely successful 1929 Broadway production, which he co-produced and co-directed with Gilbert Miller.

The film was thought to have been lost until it was rediscovered in the 1970s. A newly restored 35mm print has been made, and the restored version was first shown at the 2011 H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival.

==Plot==
In 1784, shortly after the United States wins its independence, American Peter Standish sails from New York to England to marry his cousin. Upon hearing of a Frenchman crossing the English Channel in a balloon, Peter regrets that he will not be able to see the marvels the future has in store.

In 1933, his descendant, also named Peter Standish, unexpectedly inherits a house in Berkeley Square, London. He becomes increasingly obsessed with his ancestor&#x27;s diary, causing his fiancée Marjorie Frant great concern. When they have tea with the American ambassador, Peter confides to the diplomat with eager anticipation his conviction that he will be transported back 149 years at 5:30 that day. Peter is convinced that all he needs to do is follow his ancestor&#x27;s diary, since he already knows what happens, from reading it.

He rushes home, and just as he opens the door, he is indeed back in 1784, taking the place of the earlier Peter Standish just as he arrives at the house, then owned by his relations, the Pettigrews. Lady Ann and her grown offspring Tom, Kate, and Helen are there to greet him. The Pettigrews, being in desperate financial straits, are anxious for Kate to marry the wealthy American. Peter is determined not to alter the future he has read about, until he sees Helen for the first time. He tries to fight his attraction to her, but ultimately fails. Helen, meanwhile, is being pressed by her mother to marry Mr. Throstle, but Helen has determined, even before Peter&#x27;s arrival, not to marry. She later confesses to Peter that she had been dreaming of him before she saw him.

As time goes on, Peter keeps inadvertently giving offense with his unfamiliarity with 18th century customs. People also begin to fear him, as he blunders and speaks of things which have not yet taken place. For example, when he commissions Sir Joshua Reynolds to paint his portrait, he praises another Reynolds work by name, one the painter has only just begun. Kate becomes convinced that Peter is demonically possessed and breaks their engagement. Helen, however, is sympathetic to his difficulties, and falls in love with him.

Helen eventually presses Peter for an explanation of his &quot;second sight&quot;, which he has only hinted at. Though he refuses to speak openly, she somehow sees in his eyes visions of his modern world, with all its horrors as well as its marvels, and guesses the truth. Knowing he has become disillusioned, living among ghosts born 149 years before his time, and desperately unhappy with the day-to-day realities of her era (including a lack of hygiene and plumbing, and not bathing regularly in what he calls a &quot;filthy little pigsty of a world&quot;), she urges him to return to his own time. He wants to stay with her regardless of the consequences, but in the end, he does go back to 1933.

When he visits Helen&#x27;s grave, he learns that she died on June 15, 1787, at the age of 23. Marjorie comes to see him, worried about his sanity because he has been saying that he is from the 18th century. Peter believes his ancestor had switched places with him. He tells her he cannot marry her. Peter is consoled by the epitaph on Helen&#x27;s grave, and her conviction that they will be together, &quot;not in my time, nor in yours, but in God&#x27;s&quot;.

==Reception==
The film was a box office disappointment for Fox.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer Mordaunt Hall called it &quot;an example of delicacy and restraint, a picture filled with gentle humor and appealing pathos.&quot; He particularly praised Leslie Howard, writing, &quot;He has done excellent work in other films, but it is doubtful whether he has ever given so impressive and imaginative a performance.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; declared the film &quot;an imaginative, beautiful and well-handled production&quot;, but predicted that it would not fare well at the American box office because of the very British cast and dialogue.

John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; also praised the film, writing that &quot;the charm that was in the play is there, with Leslie Howard again in his stage role, and with the good, even poetic, lines conserved, and the handsome eighteenth-century London mounted for us with a great deal of taste.&quot;

&quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; wrote: &quot;Artistically and handsomely produced and beautifully acted, &quot;Berkeley Square&quot; emerges as high-class entertainment for the better class of picture-goers; it is rather slow for the masses.&quot;

Leonard Maltin gives this “intriguing fantasy” 3 out of 4 stars.

&quot;Berkeley Square&quot; was voted one of the ten best pictures of 1934 by &quot;Film Daily&quot;&#x27;s annual poll of critics.

==Remake==
In 1951, 20th Century Fox produced a Technicolor adaptation, with substantial alterations to the plot, as &quot;The House in the Square (&quot;also known &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Forget You&quot; and &quot;Man of Two Worlds),&quot; starring Tyrone Power and Ann Blyth. Irene Browne reprised her role as Lady Ann Pettigrew in the remake. In the 1933 film, Standish&#x27;s mistakes in vocabulary and his foreknowledge inspire suspicion and then fear when he at last speaks openly about the future and his disgust for the 18th century. In the 1951 version, Standish is an atomic scientist who ends up being (anachronistically) accused of witchcraft because of his scientific endeavors.

The films end very differently. In the 1933 film, Standish ends his engagement and plans to stay alone in the house in Berkeley Square, awaiting the day when he and Helen will be reunited, “in God&#x27;s time.” In the 1951 film, there is no fiancée. After Standish returns from his journey into the past, he goes to Helen&#x27;s grave and learns that she died of grief soon after he was taken away to Bedlam. He meets his friend&#x27;s sister, also played by Ann Blyth, suggesting the possibility that she is Helen, reincarnated.

<doc id="913183" wikidata="Q181319" url="?curid=913183" title="Scrolling">
<text>In computer displays, filmmaking, television production, video games and other kinetic displays, scrolling is sliding text, images or video across a monitor or display, vertically or horizontally. &quot;Scrolling,&quot; as such, does not change the layout of the text or pictures but moves (pans or tilts) the user&#x27;s view across what is apparently a larger image that is not wholly seen. A common television and movie special effect is to scroll credits, while leaving the background stationary. Scrolling may take place completely without user intervention (as in film credits) or, on an interactive device, be triggered by touchscreen or a keypress and continue without further intervention until a further user action, or be entirely controlled by input devices.

Scrolling may take place in discrete increments (perhaps one or a few lines of text at a time), or continuously (smooth scrolling). Frame rate is the speed at which an entire image is redisplayed. It is related to scrolling in that changes to text and image position can only happen as often as the image can be redisplayed. When frame rate is a limiting factor, one smooth scrolling technique is to blur images during movement that would otherwise appear to &quot;jump&quot;.

==Computing==

=== Implementation ===

Scrolling is often carried out on a computer by the CPU (&quot;software scrolling&quot;) or by a graphics processor. Some systems feature &quot;hardware scrolling&quot;, where an image may be offset as it is displayed, without any frame buffer manipulation (see also hardware windowing). This was especially common in 8 and 16bit video game consoles.

=== UI paradigms ===
In a WIMP-style graphical user interface (GUI), user-controlled scrolling is carried out by manipulating a scrollbar with a mouse, or using keyboard shortcuts, often the arrow keys. Scrolling is often supported by text user interfaces and command line interfaces. Older computer terminals changed the entire contents of the display one screenful (&quot;page&quot;) at a time; this paging mode requires fewer resources than scrolling. Scrolling displays often also support page mode. Typically certain keys or key combinations page up or down; on PC-compatible keyboards the page up and page down keys or the space bar are used; earlier computers often used control key combinations. Some computer mice have a scroll wheel, which scrolls the display, often vertically, when rolled; others have scroll balls or tilt wheels which allow both vertical and horizontal scrolling.

Some software supports other ways of scrolling. Adobe Reader has a mode identified by a small hand icon (&quot;hand tool&quot;) on the document, which can then be dragged by clicking on it and moving the mouse as if sliding a large sheet of paper. When this feature is implemented on a touchscreen it is called &quot;kinetic scrolling&quot;. Touch-screens often use &quot;inertial scrolling&quot;, in which the scrolling motion of an object continues in a decaying fashion after release of the touch, simulating the appearance of an object with inertia. An early implementation of such behavior was in the &quot;Star7&quot; PDA of Sun Microsystems ca. 1991–1992.

Scrolling can be controlled in other software-dependent ways by a PC mouse. Some scroll wheels can be pressed down, functioning like a button. Depending on the software, this allows both horizontal and vertical scrolling by dragging in the direction desired; when the mouse is moved to the original position, scrolling stops. A few scroll wheels can also be tilted, scrolling horizontally in one direction until released. On touchscreen devices, scrolling is a multi-touch gesture, done by swiping a finger on the screen vertically in the direction opposite to where the user wants to scroll to.

If any content is too wide to fit on a display, horizontal scrolling is required to view all of it. In applications such as graphics and spreadsheets there is often more content than can fit either the width or the height of the screen at a comfortable scale, and scrolling in both directions is necessary.

===Infinite scrolling===

In 2006, Aza Raskin developed the infinite scrolling technique, whereby pagination of web pages is eliminated, in favor of continuously loading content as the user scrolls down the page. Raskin later expressed regret at the invention, describing it as &quot;one of the first products designed to not simply help a user, but to deliberately keep them online for as long as possible&quot;. Usability research suggests infinite scrolling can present an accessibility issue. The lack of stopping cues has been described as a pathway to smartphone addiction and social media addiction.

===Text===
In languages written horizontally, such as most Western languages, text documents longer than will fit on the screen are often displayed wrapped and sized to fit the screen width, and scrolled vertically to bring desired content into view. It is possible to display lines too long to fit the display without wrapping, scrolling horizontally to view each entire line. However, this requires inconvenient constant line-by-line scrolling, while vertical scrolling is only needed after reading a full screenful.

Software such as word processors and web browsers normally uses word-wrapping to display as many words in a single line as will fit the width of the screen or window or, for text organised in columns, each column.

===Demos===
Scrolling texts, also referred to as &quot;scrolltexts&quot; or &quot;scrollers&quot;, played an important part in the birth of the computer demo culture. The software crackers often used their deep knowledge of computer platforms to transform the information that accompanied their releases into crack intros. The sole role of these intros was to scroll the text on the screen in an impressive way.

Scrolling is commonly used to display the credits at the end of films and television programs.

Scrolling is often used in the form of a news ticker towards the bottom of the picture for content such as television news, scrolling sideways across the screen, delivering short-form content.

== Video games ==
In computer and video games, scrolling of a playing field allows the player to control an object in a large contiguous area. Early examples of this method include Taito&#x27;s 1974 vertical-scrolling racing video game &quot;Speed Race&quot;, Sega&#x27;s 1976 forward-scrolling racing games &quot;Moto-Cross&quot; (&quot;Fonz&quot;) and &quot;Road Race&quot;, and &quot;Super Bug&quot;. Previously the flip-screen method was used to indicate moving backgrounds.

The Namco Galaxian arcade system board introduced with &quot;Galaxian&quot; in 1979 pioneered a sprite system that animated pre-loaded sprites over a scrolling background, which became the basis for Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Radar Scope&quot; and &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; arcade hardware and home consoles such as the Nintendo Entertainment System.

Parallax scrolling, which was first featured in &quot;Moon Patrol&quot;, involves several semi-transparent layers (called playfields), which scroll on top of each other at varying rates in order to give an early pseudo-3D illusion of depth.

 is a method used in side-scrolling beat &#x27;em up games with a downward camera angle where players can move up and down in addition to left and right.

== Studies ==
A 1993 article by George Fitzmaurice studied spatially aware palmtop computers. These devices had a 3D sensor, and moving the device caused the contents to move as if the contents were fixed in place. This interaction could be referred to as “moving to scroll.” Also, if the user moved the device away from their body, they would zoom in; conversely, the device would zoom out if the user pulled the device closer to them. Smartphone cameras and “optical flow” image analysis utilize this technique nowadays.

A 1996 research paper by Jun Rekimoto analyzed tilting operations as scrolling techniques on small screen interfaces. Users could not only tilt to scroll, but also tilt to select menu items. These techniques proved especially useful for field workers, since they only needed to hold and control the device with one hand.

A study from 2013 by Selina Sharmin, Oleg Špakov, and Kari-Jouko Räihä explored the action of reading text on a screen while the text auto-scrolls based on the user&#x27;s eye tracking patterns. The control group simply read text on a screen and manually scrolled. The study found that participants preferred to read primarily at the top of the screen, so the screen scrolled down whenever participants’ eyes began to look toward the bottom of the screen. This auto-scrolling caused no statistically significant difference in reading speed or performance.

A undated study occurring during or after 2010 by Dede Frederick, James Mohler, Mihaela Vorvoreanu, and Ronald Glotzbach noted that parallax scrolling &quot;may cause certain people to experience nausea.&quot;

<text>Thompson is a city in north-central Manitoba, Canada, the largest city and most populated municipality in Northern Manitoba.

Situated along the Burntwood River, Thompson is located north of Lake Winnipeg and north of the City of Winnipeg. Originally founded in 1956 as a mining town, it is one of the largest fully planned communities in Canada. It now primarily serves as the &quot;Hub of the North&quot;, providing goods and services such as health care and retail trade to the surrounding communities.

Thompson has fewer than 15,000 residents, with many of the smaller communities accessible only by air or winter road. Despite its isolated location in the heart of Canada&#x27;s boreal forest, the city is served by an all-weather road and Manitoba Highway 6, Thompson station (served by the Winnipeg–Churchill train), and by the Thompson Airport.

Thompson&#x27;s natural and undisturbed surroundings make it popular with outdoor enthusiasts. The largest marina in Manitoba is south in Paint Lake Provincial Park. The lack of light pollution and Thompson&#x27;s northern latitude allows for occasional viewing of the northern lights, even within the city limits.

== History ==
The Thompson area, located on the south side of the Burntwood River, was first inhabited by nomadic Paleo-Indian hunters around 6000 BC, sometime after the collapse of the Laurentide Ice Sheet.

=== Founding ===
For a 10-year period beginning in 1946, Inco Limited explored Northern Manitoba for nickel deposits; on February 4, 1956, a major ore body was discovered southwest of Moak Lake, and the modern history of Thompson began.

On December 3, 1956, Inco and the Government of Manitoba reached agreement on developing the area. A town and a rail link with the Canadian National Railway had to be built. The town was founded in 1957, and was named after Dr. John F. Thompson (1881–1968), Inco&#x27;s chairman at the time.

The construction of the fully planned city was completed by a workforce of several thousands in 1961, coinciding with the formal opening of the mine on March 25. It was the second largest nickel-producing operation in the world (after Inco&#x27;s Sudbury operations).

New mines were opened during the 1960s, and the population topped 20,000, despite the townsite being designed for 8,000 to 12,000.

=== Incorporation ===
Thompson was incorporated as a town in 1967 on Canada&#x27;s Centennial Anniversary. In 1970, Thompson gained city status in the royal presence of Queen Elizabeth II.

The community was initially planned for a population of 8000, but Thompson grew rapidly to 19,001 residents by the 1971 Census; the population has even been estimated as high as 26,000 residents at the time prior to the recession. However, major layoffs at Inco Limited in 1971 and 1977 led to Thompson&#x27;s population declining to 14,288 by the 1981 Census.

Thompson&#x27;s rapid boom and bust was attributed to changes in the nickel market; during the 1960s, following large increases in the demand for nickel, 6 additional mines (Birchtree, Soab North, Soab South, Pipe Number 1, Pipe Number 2, and Pipe Open Pit) were constructed near Thompson.

After the Soviet Union gained access to the world nickel market in 1970, world supply of nickel exceeded world demand; in response, four nickel mines (Soab North, Soab South, Pipe Number 1, and Pipe Number 2) were closed in 1971 and 30% of Inco&#x27;s workforce in Thompson was laid off.

In 1977, when nickel prices declined substantially, a fifth mine (Birchtree) was put on care and maintenance and an additional 650 Inco employees in Thompson were laid off.

As Inco&#x27;s workforce dwindled from over 4000 in the 1970s to around 850 in 2018, the economic driver of Thompson shifted to providing goods and services (e.g., retail, healthcare, social services) to the surrounding communities, earning Thompson the nickname, &quot;The Hub of the North&quot;.

== Geography ==

Thompson covers an area of and is located on the Precambrian Canadian Shield.

Situated along the Burntwood River, Thompson is located north of Lake Winnipeg and north of the City of Winnipeg.

The city is surrounded by boreal forest and bordered on the west and north by the Burntwood River.

=== Ecology ===
==== Flora ====
Thompson is located on the border of plant hardiness zones 1a and 1b, making outdoor commercial agriculture impossible; for comparison, Winnipeg is located within zone 4a.

The dominant coniferous species are white spruce (&quot;Picea glauca&quot;), black spruce (&quot;Picea mariana&quot;), jack pine (&quot;Pinuus banksiana&quot;), tamarack (&quot;Larix laricina&quot;) and balsam fir (&quot;Abies balsamea&quot;). White birch (&quot;Betula papyrifera&quot;) is the most common deciduous species.

==== Fauna ====

Hundreds of ravens (&quot;Corvus corax&quot;), known locally as &quot;Thompson Turkeys&quot;, reside in Thompson year-round. Many bird species visit Thompson and area in the summer to breed, such as herring gulls (&quot;Larus smithsonianus&quot;), bald eagles (&quot;Haliaeetus leucocephalus&quot;), golden eagles (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;), sandhill cranes (&quot;Antigone canadensis&quot;), and common terns (&quot;Sterna hirundo)&quot;.

Beavers (&quot;Castor canadensis&quot;) are ubiquitous around Thompson, with a few residing in the city limits. Red foxes (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;) can also be found in Thompson. Black bears (&quot;Ursus americanus&quot;), and less commonly, wolves (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;), are occasionally spotted on the fringes of town. Moose (&quot;Alces alces&quot;) and herds of boreal woodland caribou (&quot;Rangifer tarandus caribou&quot;) can also occasionally be seen near Thompson. Rarely seen predators outside of Thompson include the marten (&quot;Martes americana&quot;), the wolverine (&quot;Gulo gulo&quot;), and the lynx (&quot;Lynx canadensis&quot;).

===Climate===
Thompson is marked by a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;), with long, severely cold winters and short warm summers.

Monthly means range from in January to in July, and the annual mean is . A majority of the annual precipitation of falls from June to September. Snowfall totals per year, falling mainly from October to May.

==Economy==

The economy of Thompson is centred around nickel mining, and provides goods and services to the surrounding communities in both Census Division No. 22 (in which Thompson is located) and Census Division No. 23; these two Census Divisions have a combined population of 51,136, which includes over 38,000 First Nations people. Thompson is by far the largest community in either of these Census Divisions, with the next largest community being Norway House Cree Nation (population 4927).

As is common in resource-based communities, Thompson has experienced above-average employment income and significant swings in mining-sector employment throughout its history.

The median employment income in 2015 for full-year full-time workers in Thompson was $65,262; this was 22% higher than the Canadian median of $53,431. Thompson&#x27;s unemployment rate in 2016 was 7.6%, slightly below the Canadian average of 7.7%.

As of the 2016 Census, Thompson had 7065 employed persons, with the five largest sectors of the economy being:

* mining (1255 employees)
* health care and social assistance (1100 employees)
* accommodation and food services (710 employees)
* educational services (710 employees)
* retail trade (670 employees)

=== Mining ===

Vale Limited is the owner and operator of Thompson&#x27;s mining operations, which involves the mining, milling, and concentrating of nickel; the concentrated nickel slurry is then shipped (for final processing) to Vale Limited&#x27;s operations in Long Harbour and Sudbury.

Founded on a large and high-grade deposit of nickel, Thompson accounted for 11% of the world&#x27;s finished nickel production in 1962, having produced over 40,800 metric tonnes of nickel that year; Thompson&#x27;s nickel production peaked in 1970 and 1971 at over 60,000 metric tonnes (per year) and has since declined to 23,000 metric tonnes in 2017.

Despite the fact that Vale Limited&#x27;s placed their nearby Birchtree Mine on care and maintenance (suspending nickel extraction at the mine for the time being), Thompson may be particularly well positioned for future growth in nickel mining industry: Vale recently invested over $100 million in the concentrate load out facility and Vale&#x27;s North Atlantic mining operations director Alistair Ross recently stated that, &quot;If you were to look across the world for an area that had nickel that could be invested in on a standalone nickel basis, there isn’t a better place [than Thompson]&quot;.

Between the 2016 Census and 2018, approximately 400 job losses have occurred in the mining industry.

=== Other ===

The city is served by Thompson Airport, which is the third-busiest airport in Manitoba and provides Thompson with several hundred jobs.

MDS Aerotest currently operates the Global Aerospace Centre for Icing and Environmental Research (GLACIER), a cold weather testing centre just south of Thompson, as part of a joint venture between Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada and Rolls-Royce. Thompson was selected from an initial list of 150 candidate communities due to the area&#x27;s ideal testing conditions and urban amenities.
Thompson&#x27;s retail trade is centered mostly in several malls, including:
*City Centre Mall, which includes a Wal-Mart, Safeway, TD Canada, and Tim Hortons.
*Burntwood Plaza, which includes Shoppers Drug Mart and RBC Financial.
* Plaza Shopping Centre, which includes a Canadian Tire and Family Foods.
*Westwood Mall, which includes a Giant Tiger.

==== First Nations organizations ====
Thompson has several advocacy, non-profit, and administrative organizations focused around First Nations people, including Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak Inc. (MKO), Awasis Agency of Northern Manitoba, Keewatin Tribal Council, and Ma-Mow-We-Tak Friendship Centre.

Twenty-four governments, businesses, and non-profit organizations are partners to the Thompson Aboriginal Accord, originally signed in 2009, outlining a common understanding towards equitable economic development and reconciliation.

== Amenities ==
Thompson primarily serves as the &quot;Hub of the North&quot;, providing goods and services such as health care and retail trade to surrounding communities in Northern Manitoba.

=== Transportation ===
The city is served by road via an all-weather road, Manitoba Provincial Road 280, Manitoba Provincial Road 391, and Manitoba Highway 6; by rail via Thompson station, which is served by Via Rail&#x27;s Winnipeg–Churchill train, which extends from Winnipeg, through The Pas, to Churchill; and by air via the Thompson Airport and Thompson Water Aerodrome.

The city is connected to Winnipeg via a paved highway (Highway 6), rail, and air.

Thompson Transit is the city&#x27;s public transit agency.

=== Health care and social assistance ===
The Northern Regional Health Authority (Eastern Campus) provides health care services to most of the communities in Census Division No. 22 and Census Division No. 23; Thompson-based facilities include the Thompson General Hospital, Northern Spirit Manor (personal care home), the Thompson Clinic, and Hope North (centre for youth in crisis).

Addictions Foundation of Manitoba also has a facility located in Thompson.

=== Education ===
The School District of Mystery Lake provides K–12 education in Thompson, operating six elementary schools (Deerwood School, Burntwood School, Westwood School, École Riverside School, Juniper School, Wapanohk Community School) and one high school (R. D. Parker Collegiate). While primarily English, the district also offers a K–12 French immersion program, as well as a K–8 language education program in the Cree language at the Wapanohk Community School. Students can continue the French program at the high school, where there are also basic Cree courses in grades 9–12.

Since September 2009, the Franco-Manitoban School Division (DSFM), which services communities across Manitoba, has expanded to include one K–12 elementary school in Thompson, École Communautaire La Voie du Nord. Located on Weir Road near the site of the Norplex Pool Recreation Centre, the district allows children to receive instruction in French with peers in a Francophone culture.

The Frontier School Division, the largest school division in Canada by geographical area, has an area office in Thompson as well.

For post-secondary education, Thompson is home to one of the two main campuses of the University College of the North, as well as the University of Manitoba&#x27;s Faculty of Social Work branch in the region.

The Northern Manitoba Sector Council provides essential skills and employment skills training to Northern Manitobans.

=== Attractions ===
The lack of light pollution and Thompson&#x27;s northern latitude allows for occasional viewing of the northern lights, even within the city limits.

Recreational services in the city are mainly provided by the Thompson Regional Community Centre, which contains two indoor skating rinks, a large 6-sheet curling rink called the Burntwood Curling Club, a multi-sport gym, exercise facilities, and an indoor walking track. The two ice arenas attached to the community centre are:

* the CA Nesbitt Arena, the larger arena, which is home of the U18 Norman Northstars and the U15 Norman Northstars
* the Gordon Beard Arena

Spirit Way is a walking and biking pathway with 16 points of interest that highlight Thompson&#x27;s art, heritage, culture, industry, geology, and scenery; the pathway includes the largest photo-real mural in Canada and 56 painted wolf statues.

The Heritage North Museum offers the opportunity to see animals native to the area, a boreal forest diorama, First Nation and fur trade artifacts (including an authentic caribou hide tipi), fossils, and mining artifacts. The Museum consists of two log structures, an open-air blacksmith shop, Institutional Archives, and visitor information booth.

The Millennium Trail is a hike and bike loop around the city with sections that pass through the boreal forest. The crushed rock trail is open year-round to non-motorized travel. Walking, hiking and mountain biking are popular in the summer while walking and cross country skiing are winter favourites.

The city boasts at least two big festivals: Nickel Days, a large weekend festival held in June every year that includes concerts, family games, and a parade; and Winterfest, an annual multi-day celebration of northern culture and activities that is held in February.

==== Crime ====
In both 2018 and 2019, Thompson was second on the Crime Severity Index of Canada. To calculate the actual Crime Severity Index, the number of police-reported incidents for each offence is multiplied by the weight for that offence. All weighted offences are then added together and divided by the corresponding population total.

Finally, to make the Index easier to interpret, the Index is standardized to &quot;100&quot; for Canada (a system that is similar to the Consumer Price Index), using 2006 as a base year.For hub cities (e.g., Thompson), the Crime Severity Index likely over-represents the dangers of crime to the regular citizen. In 2018, the RCMP officer in charge of Thompson, Kevin Lewis, stated... Thompson is the hub of Northern Manitoba, which makes it a desirable place for drug trafficking, and other nefarious activities. This is a common theme for hub cities across Canada. Our proactive drug enforcement also provides an increase in the CSI, as cocaine trafficking is weighted heavily on the CSI. Disturbing the peace is similar to mischief where intoxication occurs in a public place, resulting in many violations due to the downtown core, again weighing heavily on our score.Lewis also stated, &quot;... Many of our mischiefs are related to intoxicated persons in a private residence or hotel room, but can also be used to capture damage to property. The mischief rate is high and when the weight is applied, it provides a high ratio for our CSI score.”

<doc id="913190" wikidata="Q166633" url="?curid=913190" title="Simple commodity production">
<text>Simple commodity production (, also translated as petty commodity production), is a term coined by Friedrich Engels in 1894 when he had compiled and edited the third volume of Marx&#x27;s &quot;Capital&quot;. It refers to productive activities under the conditions of what Karl Marx had called the &quot;simple exchange&quot; or &quot;simple circulation&quot; of commodities, where independent producers trade their own products to obtain other products in exchange (the trading circuit C-M-C&#x27;). The use of the adjective &quot;simple&quot; is not intended to refer to the nature of the producers or of their production, but rather to the relatively simple and straightforward exchange processes involved, from an economic perspective. 

As discussed below, both Karl Marx and Engels claimed explicitly that the law of value applied also to simple exchange, and that this law is modified (or, as Marx sometimes says, &quot;inverted&quot;) by the capitalist mode of production when all the inputs and outputs of production (including means of production and labour power) become tradeable commodities. 

According to Marx and Engels, simple commodity production and trade existed for millennia before the advent of capitalism. From the beginnings of the bourgeois epoch in 15th century Europe, the reach and scope of commodity production began to grow incrementally, although sometimes this process was interrupted by wars, epidemic diseases and natural disasters. Only with the growth of free wage labour is commodity production generalized (&quot;verallgemeinert&quot;) to most of the economy, and fully integrated into national and international markets. Obviously, this market growth &quot;also&quot; required institutions, conventions and rules, so that the competing burghers could resolve their trade disputes fairly and efficiently, without destroying the markets and destroying people&#x27;s livelihoods; through trial and error, a &quot;market culture&quot; gradually evolved to make that possible. Civil society could not be &quot;civil&quot;, if the burghers defied all religion and authority, and resolved their trading disputes by robbing, physically attacking and killing each other.

Originally production for market sale existed alongside subsistence production. That continued for millennia until urbanization, merchant trade and industrialization began to take off. Through the last six centuries, the share of commodity production in total output grew more and more, together with productivity growth and population growth. It grew steeply in the 19th and 20th centuries, until production for the market represented the largest part of total output value in the majority of countries. 

To explain this lengthy historical process, Marx and Engels took a nuanced approach. They did not argue crudely that economic categories can only be &quot;either&quot; &quot;transhistorical categories&quot; &quot;or&quot; &quot;categories specific to one historical period&quot;. Instead, they argued that economic categories can and do &quot;evolve&quot; from one historical epoch to the next, along with the evolution of the social relations which they express. Continuities co-existed with discontinuities. The challenge was to understand dialectically how the new economic relations could evolve out of the old ones - by retaining some of their content, losing some content, and also gaining some completely new content.

==Different interpretations==

This historical viewpoint is however not accepted by all Marxists. Some believe that capitalist markets function in a &quot;totally different way&quot; from pre-capitalist markets, or they believe that the law of value applies only to industrial capitalism, and not to market systems which preceded industrial capitalism. According to Helmut Reichelt, for example, the law of value only applies when the whole of society is subsumed under the bourgeois form of the division of labour. Engels aimed to give a consistent explanation of the evolution and development of the market economy, from simple beginnings to the complexities of modern capitalist markets, but his critics argue he disregards the qualitative transformation of the relations of production involved.

Marx and Engels&#x27;s interpretation of the historical role of simple exchange based on simple commodity production has been the subject of considerable controversy among Marxist scholars. It has been claimed by academics that Marx never had a concept of &quot;simple commodity production&quot; because he did not use those words. If that is true, then it seems that Engels&#x27;s concept is really alien to Marx&#x27;s thought. For example, the Italian Marx-scholar Roberto Fineschi alleges that Friedrich Engels (who was a successful businessman, and edited Vol. 2 and 3 of Marx&#x27;s &quot;Capital&quot;) failed to understand the difference between circulation and production, so that Engels falsely equated Marx&#x27;s concept of &quot;simple exchange of commodities&quot; with &quot;simple commodity production&quot;. According to Rolf Hecker&#x27;s interpretation, by contrast, Engels does not &quot;equate&quot; Marx&#x27;s concept of simple exchange of commodities with simple commodity production, but instead &quot;replaces&quot; simple exchange of commodities with simple commodity production. Christopher J. Arthur claims that an economy or society fully based on simple commodity production has never existed in history, contrary to what Engels (allegedly) suggested. 

This new anti-Engels interpretation is contrary to the traditional Marxist view, the latter which defines a commodity as a &quot;product of labour&quot; and not (as academic value-form theorists do) as a &quot;product of exchange&quot;. According to the traditional Marxist view, the simple exchange of commodities &quot;presupposes&quot; at least that the commodities are &quot;produced&quot; for exchange. Otherwise there &quot;would not exist&quot; any commodities that could be exchanged. Historically speaking, the development of the simple exchange of reproducible commodities could never occur without simple commodity production. Engels does not argue that the law of value &quot;disappears&quot; when commodity trade is regulated by production prices, but rather that the law of value is &quot;transformed&quot; and &quot;modified&quot;. It is transformed, because: 

*While originally (as already recognized by Adam Smith) the exchange-value of what a producer creates is regulated by his own physically necessary labour-time (with upper and lower bounds), in the end what regulates the exchange-value of his production is a socially average labour-cost, i.e. a value expressed as the normal price-level which is imposed on him as an objective external force (like &quot;a law of nature&quot;), regardless of whether his own labour-time is more or less than the normal social average.
*The simple exchange of labour-equivalents is gradually replaced by the more complex exchange of unequal labour-values, where fluctuating market-prices for products systematically diverge from product-values and their supply-cost contains a surplus value formed in production. 
*While originally the commodities sold were a surplus to the requirements of the seller, alongside subsistence production, in the end the market sale of the commodities produced is the precondition and the only practical purpose of producing them. 

Instead of postulating a &quot;society of simple commodity producers&quot;, Engels was referring to the history of the gradual expansion of commodity-trade alongside subsistence production across thousands of years, to more and more sectors of economic life - until commodity production is generalized and the majority of commodities are produced &quot;by means of commodities&quot; in capitalist enterprises employing wage labour. Marx had briefly indicated this historical process himself in his 1864 manuscript &quot;Results of the immediate process of production&quot;.

The difficulty that the anti-Engels critics have, is that they cannot credibly explain what regulates commodity-trade in the pre-capitalist economy, in the supposed absence of the law of value, and how the law of value can then &quot;suddenly&quot; appear out of nowhere, once most of production becomes commodity production, via expanding markets. The only narrative the anti-Engels critics have, is that capitalism exists&quot; when wage-labour exists&quot;, i.e. when peasants and serfs are thrown off the land, and are forced to work for a wage from an employer, to make a living. Somehow, a mass of employers &quot;suddenly&quot; appears out of nowhere to employ a mass of unemployed workers in mechanized factories, in exchange for wages. But how this could have resulted from the situation that preceded it remains unclear. It is only when labour history is studied, that this mystery is cleared up and resolved. Long before the emergence of the industrial capitalist on the stage of history, wage-labourers were already being hired - when officials of the early state paid soldiers for their services, temple officials employed contract labourers, and landowners hired farm workers. The first workers&#x27; strike in written history, recorded on a papyrus, was staged more than three thousand years ago by building workers at the royal necropolis at Deir el-Medina in Egypt, during the reign of Ramses III (see also Deir el-Medina strikes).

==Origins==

Simple exchange of reproducible and portable commodities (such as food, ornaments, beads, pottery, pelts, fabrics, clothing, tools, utensils, and weapons) is as old as the history of trade, insofar as it progressed from incidental barter of use-values according to cultural custom, to exchange using a standard of value. Simple exchange occurred for thousands of years before most production became organized in the capitalist way. It begins when producers in a simple division of labour (e.g. farmers, hunters/gatherers and artisans) trade surpluses to their own requirements, with the aim of obtaining other products with an equal value, for their own use. In Marx&#x27;s own words, 

Through the experience of regular trade and competition, normal exchange values become established for products, which reflect an economy of labour-time and a cost-structure of production. The simple commodity producers could aim just to trade their products or services to obtain other products with an equivalent value, or they could, in favourable circumstances, aim to realise a profit. They could sell their products or services to the final consumer, or to an intermediary such as a merchant. Simple commodity production and simple exchange are compatible with many different relations of production and exchange, ranging from self-employment in which the producer owns his own means of production and family (household) labour, to forms of slavery, peonage, indentured labour, and serfdom. In the cooperative farming system of the Soviet Union, members of the kolkhozy were permitted to cultivate small plots of private farmland, to raise some livestock, and to sell their produce themselves.

The technologies used by a simple commodity producer might be characteristic for a specific mode of production, but simple commodity production as such is not specific to any particular mode of production, and might be found alongside (or articulated with) many different modes of production, with various degrees of sophistication. It does not necessarily imply that &quot;all&quot; the inputs or outputs of productive activity in the local economy are commodities traded in markets. For example, simple commodity producers could produce some products for their own subsistence and for their own use on their own land, while trading another part of their products. They might buy or trade some tools and equipment, but also make some tools and equipment themselves. Simple commodity production continues to occur in capitalist societies, especially in developing countries.

==Early colonial settlements==

There has never existed a society which literally consisted &quot;only&quot; of simple commodity producers, and Friedrich Engels did not claim that either. No serious Marxian scholar has ever claimed that such a society really existed. However, in the dawn of the bourgeois epoch of history, many of the initial colonial settlements in foreign lands involved a large majority of self-employed producers, who farmed their own land or worked as artisans (for example, settler colonies in North America, Argentina, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand). Marx was well aware of this, and he remarked wrily that in the colonies &quot;the capitalist regime constantly comes up against the obstacle presented by the producer, who, as owner of his own conditions of labour, employs that labour to enrich himself instead of the capitalist&quot;.). An American historian comments that:

The proportion of early American colonists who worked as artisans is estimated to have been between 10% and 18%. So the vast majority of the workforce at that time (up to about 93%) consisted not of waged employees, but of independent farmers and artisans engaging in simple commodity production. Imported African slaves &quot;worked mainly on the tobacco, rice and indigo plantations of the southern coast, from the Chesapeake Bay colonies of Maryland and Virginia south to Georgia.&quot; Before 1660, few Virginia planters owned slaves. By 1675 the use of slaves was common, and by 1700 slaves largely replaced indentured servants. &quot;With plentiful land and slave labor available to grow a lucrative crop, southern planters prospered, and family-based tobacco plantations became the economic and social norm&quot;. 

From the time of the earliest English colonial settlements of the 1600s until America began to issue its own currency in 1783, three different types of money were used in colonial commodity trade: (1) coins (Spanish dollars, shillings), (2) paper notes (fiat money denominated in British pounds, shillings and pence; land notes; bank notes; tobacco notes) and (3) commodity money (portable goods and services offered in exchange, including tobacco, corn, wampum, buttons, etc.).

==Textual sources of the concept==
In &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; (1776), Adam Smith introduces the concept of simple commodity production as follows:

Smith then contrasts simple commodity production with capitalist production involving wage labour:

In a conspectus and critique of Adam Smith&#x27;s theory of value, Marx similarly gives a brief description of simple commodity production (although admittedly he did not use that terminology):

In his 1894 preface to &quot;Capital, Volume 3&quot;, Friedrich Engels argued that:

This interpretation by Engels closely followed what Marx himself stated in his 1864 manuscript titled &quot;Results of the immediate process of production&quot;: 

However, the interpretation by Engels arguably did not completely match what Marx said about his own approach. In his critical notes on Adolph Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Textbook on political economy&quot; (1879), Marx said about his analysis of the commodity form in &quot;Capital, Volume 1&quot; that:

Here Marx states clearly, that in the first chapter of &quot;Capital Vol. 1&quot; he was talking about the commodity as the simplest traded object &quot;in &quot;contemporary society&quot;&quot;, and &quot;not&quot; about a simple commodity in &quot;pre-capitalist&quot; society. Point is, when Marx first analyzes a commodity as such (as a very simple category of trade), he disregards how exactly the commodity is produced and how specifically it is traded. He just examines the commodity (in his own words) &quot;as an autonomous article&quot;, as a separate thing just as it observably appears in an everyday trading relation - without introducing all sorts of assumptions about how and where it originated, or what it will be used for. Put another way, Marx is talking about simple commodity &quot;circulation&quot;, not simple commodity &quot;production&quot;, although the former could assume the latter (the simple exchange of a commodity could be preceded by different forms of producing it).

In his 1895 afterword &quot;Supplement and addendum to Volume 3 of Capital&quot;, Friedrich Engels elaborates the concept of simple commodity production as follows:

Again, Engels based himself on (and references) what Marx himself had said – in chapter 10 of &quot;Capital, Volume 3&quot; (on the equalization of rates of profit by competition):

== From simple commodity production to capitalist production ==
The large-scale global transformation of simple commodity production into capitalist production based on the wage labour of employees occurred only in the last two centuries of human history. It is preceded by the strong growth of merchant trade, supported by credit from financiers who earn rents, profit and interest from the process.The merchants not only act as intermediary between producers and consumers, but also integrate more and more of production into a market economy. That is, more and more is produced for the purpose of market trade, rather than for own use. The initial result is known as &quot;merchant capitalism&quot;, which flourished in Western European cities especially in the 17th and 18th centuries but already existed on a smaller scale in the 15th century and even earlier. 

However, the transformation of more and more simple commodity production into capitalist production which accompanies industrialisation requires profound changes in property relations, because it must be possible to trade freely in means of production and labour power (the factors of production). Only when that trade becomes possible, can the whole of production be reorganised to conform to commercial principles. 

Marx describes capitalist society as &quot;a society where the commodity-form is the universal form of the product of labour, hence the dominant social relation is the relation between people as possessors of commodities&quot;. He argues that &quot;The capitalist epoch is... characterized by the fact that labour-power, in the eyes of the worker himself, takes on the form of a commodity which is his property; his labour consequently takes on the form of wage-labour... it is only from this moment that the commodity-form of the products of labour becomes universal.&quot; Thus, &quot;...from the moment there is a free sale, by the worker himself, of labour power as a commodity... from then onwards... commodity production is generalized and becomes the typical form of production.&quot;

In an 1864 manuscript, Marx emphasized specifically that:

To reach the stage of a universal market, many legal, political, religious and technical restrictions imposed on commercial trade must be overcome. The unification of a &quot;home market&quot; among people in a country who can speak the same language typically stimulated nationalist ideologies. But depending on the existing social systems, the transformation might occur in many different ways. Typically, though, it has involved wars, violence and revolutions, since people were unwilling to just give away assets, rights and income that they previously had. Communally owned property, hereditary land ownership, the property of religious orders and state property all had to be privatised and amalgamated, in order to become tradeable assets in the process of capital accumulation. The ideology of the rising bourgeoisie typically emphasized the benefits of privately owned property for the purpose of wealth creation and industriousness.

Marx refers to this process as the primitive accumulation of capital, a process which continues particularly in developing countries to this day. Marx shows that primitive accumulation involves to a large extent the expropriation of independent producers, who lose their means of production, and therefore are forced to work for an employer to earn a living. Typically, previously independent producers on the land (but also serfs and indentured labourers etc.) are proletarianised and migrate to the urban centres, in search of work from an employer.

Simple commodity production nevertheless continues to occur on a large scale in the world economy, particularly in peasant production. It also persists within industrialised capitalist economies in the form of self-employment by free producers. Capitalist firms sometimes contract out specialised services to self-employed producers, who can produce them at a lower cost, or provide a superior product. Many digital products are produced by self-employed specialists who own their own computer (but who also depend on internet providers, and on access to rented software and websites).

==Modelling simple commodity production==

In some schools of Marxian economics, simple commodity production refers to a model of a hypothetical economy (or an &quot;imaginary society&quot;) used by economists to interpret some of Karl Marx&#x27;s insights about the economic laws governing the development of commodity trade. The model is only a thought experiment to identify some quantitative implications of commercial production and trade. In this society, a market economy is supposed in which all producers are independent individuals who own and operate their own means of production, and who trade their own products. According to Michio Morishima, 

==Theoretical discussion==

The theoretical debates about simple commodity production have attracted contributions from numerous economists, philosophers and historians across the last century. This seemingly obscure topic has important implications for quite a few different areas of research: (i) the interpretation of Marx’s method of analysis and his theory of value; (ii) the interpretation of the historical transition from pre-capitalist society to capitalism (and more generally, the social history of trade and marketization and the evolution of the forms of economic value); (iii) the so-called transformation problem; (iv) understanding settler colonialism and the post-colonial economy; (v) development economics; and (vi) the economics of the transition from capitalism to socialism and communism (the gradual replacement of market allocation by direct allocation).

Contributors to the theoretical discussion have included Michael von Tugan-Baranowsky, Nikolai Bukharin, Karl Kautsky, Oskar Lange, Paul Sweezy, Piero Sraffa, Ronald L. Meek, Helmut Reichelt, Joan Robinson, Isaak Illich Rubin, Roman Rosdolsky, Maurice Dobb, Ernest Mandel, Robert Brenner, Gerd Hardach &amp; Jürgen Schilling, Rodney Hilton, Michio Morishima &amp; George Catephores, Jairus Banaji, Richard Britnell, Dimitris Milonakis, John Roemer, Rolf Hecker, John Weeks, Hans-Georg Backhaus, Ben Fine, Wladimir Schkredow, Nadja Rakowitz, Christopher J. Arthur, Arthur Diquattro, Kolja Lindner, Howard Nicholas, Octavio Colombo, Prabhat Patnaik, Anwar M. Shaikh, Ellen Meiksins Wood, Paresh Chattopadhyay, Andrew B. Trigg, Ian P. Wright, Michael Heinrich, and Bill Jefferies.

Modern digital technology enables digitally skilled individuals to set up their own business, producing digital products and services, with a relatively low capital outlay. Therefore, &quot;simple commodity production&quot; could turn out to be not just an outdated economic category of the past, but also a common sort of work in the future.

<text>Helen Mamayaok Maksagak, (April 15, 1931 – January 23, 2009) was a Canadian politician. She served as the commissioner of the Northwest Territories from January 16, 1995, until March 26, 1999, and as the first commissioner of Nunavut from April 1, 1999, until April 1, 2000. She is a notable Copper Inuk.
Born on the land near Bernard Harbour in the Canadian Western Arctic, Maksagak was raised in Tuktoyaktuk, Aklavik and the Bathurst Inlet area and eventually settled in Cambridge Bay to raise a family of six surviving children with her husband, John Sr. Together, they were stalwart supporters of the growing indigenous rights movement in the Canadian north. Their home was often a stopping place and site of discussions when young Inuit involved in negotiating the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement or participating in Northwest Territories political life passed through the community.

Maksagak was appointed Deputy Commissioner of the Northwest Territories in 1992. In 1995, she was appointed Commissioner, partially in anticipation of the pending creation of the territory of Nunavut in 1999. She was the first woman and the first Inuk to hold the office. In April 1999, she transferred her office to the new Nunavut Territory and continued to provide stability to the new government in transition. She served until April 2000 as the first commissioner of the newly created territory of Nunavut and then as Assistant Commissioner of Nunavut from 2005 until she died in 2009.

Helen Maksagak was appointed as a member of the Order of Canada in May 2003. She served as a member of the Qulliit (Nunavut) Status of Women Council and as an Elder for the Aboriginal Healing Foundation.

Maksagak died on January 23, 2009, at 77. Helen Maksagak Drive in Iqaluit is named in her memory.

<text>The Dempster Highway, also referred to as Yukon Highway 5 and Northwest Territories Highway 8, is a highway in Canada that connects the Klondike Highway in Yukon to Inuvik, Northwest Territories on the Mackenzie River delta. The highway crosses the Peel and the Mackenzie rivers using a combination of seasonal ferry services and ice bridges. Year-round road access from Inuvik to Tuktoyaktuk opened in November 2017, with the completion of the Inuvik–Tuktoyaktuk Highway, creating the first all-weather road route connecting the Canadian road network with the Arctic Ocean.

The highway is named for North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) officer William Dempster, who earned renown for discovering the fate of a lost NWMP patrol in 1911.

==Route description==
The highway begins east of Dawson City, Yukon on the Klondike Highway. There are no highway or major road intersections along the highway&#x27;s route. It extends in a north-northeasterly direction to Inuvik, Northwest Territories, passing through Tombstone Territorial Park and crossing the Ogilvie and Richardson mountain ranges.

==History==
The Dempster Highway roughly follows the old dog sled route from Dawson City to Fort McPherson and is named for Corporal (later Inspector) William Dempster of the North-West Mounted Police.

During the late 19th century, and in response to the Klondike Gold Rush, the North-West Mounted Police established a presence in the Yukon and Northwest Territories. Their activities included winter dog sled patrols between outposts and communities. One such patrol followed a route from Dawson City to the NWMP outpost at Fort McPherson, established in 1903.

In December 1910, NWMP Inspector Francis Joseph Fitzgerald led three men on the annual winter patrol from Fort McPherson to Dawson City. They became lost on the trail, and subsequently died of exposure and starvation. When they failed to arrive in Dawson City as expected, Corporal Dempster and two constables were sent out on a rescue patrol in March 1911. Dempster and his men found the bodies of Fitzgerald&#x27;s patrol on March 22, 1911.

==Construction==
In 1958, as oil and gas exploration were expanding in the Mackenzie Delta, the Canadian government decided to build a road from Dawson City in Yukon to Aklavik in the Northwest Territories. The road was intended as an overland, year-round supply link to southern Canada. Survey work began in 1958.

With the August, 1959, discovery of oil in the Eagle Plains area, the government granted concessions to the oil industry to stimulate more exploration in the area. This provided more motivation for a road to transport equipment, infrastructure, and revenue to and from the sites. Construction of the road, then known as Yukon Territorial Road No. 11, began at Dawson City in January 1959. The northern terminus of the road was changed to the new town of Inuvik. Due to high costs and ongoing funding disagreements between the federal and Yukon governments, progress was slow until 1961. Once the Eagle Plains oil discovery was found to have no commercial potential, construction stopped in 1962 after of roadbed had been built.

Seasonal maintenance of the existing road continued but no further work was done. In 1964, the road was renamed the Dempster Highway, after petitions by Vancouver Yukoners Association and the Yukon Order of Pioneers. Construction resumed in 1970 as the Canadian government sought to assert sovereignty over their Arctic territories after the American discovery of oil and gas deposits at Prudhoe Bay, Alaska in 1968. Work was further motivated by speculation that an oil pipeline might be built in the Mackenzie Valley.

At the time of its construction, the highway was the most northerly major road project to date. Weather and daylight conditions presented challenges. In 1979, a work crew was trapped in a blizzard in the Richardson Mountains and was almost lost. Construction had to account for the permafrost; heat transfer from the highway to the ground had to be prevented so the permafrost would not melt. To address this, the road was built on top of a gravel berm, ranging from , to insulate the permafrost from the road above. Some construction was completed by the Canadian Forces; 3 Field Squadron, RCE from CFB Chilliwack built bridges over the Ogilvie River in 1971 and the Eagle River in 1977.

The final section of road was completed in 1978, at a cost of $132 million. The highway was officially opened on August 18, 1979, at Flat Creek, Yukon.

<text>Tuktoyaktuk ( ; , ) is an Inuvialuit hamlet near the Mackenzie River delta in the Inuvik Region of the Northwest Territories, Canada, at the northern terminus of the Inuvik–Tuktoyaktuk Highway. One of six Inuvialuit communities in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region, it is commonly known by its first syllable, &quot;Tuk&quot; (). It lies north of the Arctic Circle on the Arctic Ocean, and is the only place on the Arctic Ocean connected to the rest of Canada by road. Known as Port Brabant after British colonization, in 1950 it became Canada&#x27;s first Indigenous settlement to reclaim its traditional name.

== History ==


Tuktoyaktuk is the anglicized form of the native Inuvialuit place-name, meaning &quot;resembling a caribou&quot;. According to legend, a woman looked on as some caribou, common at the site, waded into the water and turned into stone. Today, reefs resembling petrified caribou are said to be visible at low tide along the shore of the town.

No formal archaeological sites exist today, the Inuvialuit have used the settlement for centuries as a place to harvest caribou and beluga whales. Tuktoyaktuk&#x27;s natural harbour was also historically used to transport supplies to other Inuvialuit settlements.

Between 1890 and 1910, many of Tuktoyaktuk&#x27;s native families were wiped out in flu epidemics brought in by American whalers. In subsequent years, the Dene people, as well as residents of Herschel Island, settled here. By 1937, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company had established a trading post. On 9 September 1944, a windstorm blew through the community, severely damaged several buildings and schooners docked at the harbour, and killed 11 people en route back from a reindeer station on the Anderson River on the schooner &quot;Cally&quot;.

Radomes were installed beginning in the 1950s as part of the Distant Early Warning Line, to monitor air traffic and detect possible Soviet intrusions during the Cold War. The settlement&#x27;s location (and harbour) made Tuk important in resupplying the civilian contractors and Air Force personnel along the DEW Line. In 1947, Tuktoyaktuk became the site of one of the first government day schools, designed to forcibly assimilate Inuit youth into mainstream Canadian culture.

Tuktoyaktuk eventually became a base for the oil and natural gas exploration of the Beaufort Sea. Large industrial buildings remain from the busy period following the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries 1973 oil embargo and 1979 summertime fuel shortage. This brought many more outsiders into the region.

In late 2010, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency announced that it would undertake an environmental study of a proposed all-weather road between Inuvik and Tuktoyaktuk. Work on the Inuvik–Tuktoyaktuk Highway started on 8 January 2014, and the highway opened on 15 November 2017.

== Geography ==
Tuktoyaktuk is on Kugmallit Bay, near the Mackenzie River Delta, and is on the Arctic tree line.

Tuktoyaktuk is the gateway for exploring Pingo Canadian Landmark, an area protecting eight nearby pingos in a region that contains about 1,350 of these Arctic ice-dome hills. The landmark comprises an area roughly , just a few kilometres west of the community, and includes Ibyuk Pingo, Canada&#x27;s highest, and the world&#x27;s second-highest, pingo, at .

==Employment==
Many residents continue traditional activities such as hunting, fishing, and trapping. Hunting caribou occurs in the autumn, ducks and geese in both spring and autumn, while fishing takes place all year-round. Other activities include collecting driftwood, berry picking, and reindeer herding. Most productivity today comes from tourism and transportation. Marine Transportation Services (MTS) is a major employer in the region, and the fossil fuel industry continues to employ explorers and other workers.

In 1962, the government-sponsored Tuktoyaktuk Fur Garment Project started; it provided vocational training in industrial sewing and commercial production of items for sale, including parkas, mitts, slippers, mukluks, hats, wall hangings, place mats and dolls produced by local women that were sold in the Tuktoyaktuk Fur Garment Shop. The shop closed in the 1980s.

==Demographics==

In the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, Tuktoyaktuk had a population of 937 living in 285 of its 334 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 898. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

The average annual personal income in 2015 was $21,984 Canadian and the average family income was $55,424. Local languages are Inuinnaqtun (Inuvialuktun) and English with a few North Slavey and Tłı̨chǫ (Dogrib) speakers. Tuktoyaktuk is predominately Indigenous (90.8%) with Inuit (Inuvialuit) making up 88.0%, 9.2% non-Aboriginal, 1.7% First Nations and 1.1% giving multiple Indigenous backgrounds.

==Climate==
Tuktoyaktuk has a subarctic climate (Dfc), bordering on a tundra climate (ET), as the July mean temperature is barely above . Since the Arctic Ocean freezes over for much of the year, the maritime influence is minimized, resulting in cold winters and a strong seasonal lag in spring. This results in colder Aprils than Octobers and much colder Mays than Septembers. March is also colder than November.

Due to the dominance of cold air, Tuktoyaktuk has a lower precipitation rate than many desert climates. Still, the cold temperatures mean it receives more than a metre of snow a year on average. Owing to the thousands of kilometres of land south of Tuktoyaktuk, southerly winds can sometimes push warmer air into the region. Rex blocks can cause an exceptionally strong ridge of high pressure to form at higher latitudes, allowing heat to build consistently. As a result, temperatures well above average can occur in summer despite the cold surrounding waters.

During a bout of exceptionally hot Arctic weather, Tuktoyaktuk was among the numerous northern communities that witnessed record temperatures on 4 July 2022, reaching a high of . Its overall highest temperature of was recorded on 2 July 1998. Tuktoyaktuk&#x27;s climate stands in stark contrast to those of Northern Norway at similar latitudes, but is in many ways less extreme than that of Eastern Canada at lower latitudes, where summers are cooler, moderated by the cool waters of the Hudson Bay.

==Transportation==
Tuktoyaktuk/James Gruben Airport links Tuktoyaktuk to Inuvik. The Tuktoyaktuk Winter Road formerly provided road access to Inuvik in the winter. In 2017, the $300-million Inuvik–Tuktoyaktuk Highway opened. It provides all-season access to Inuvik, which connects to the rest of the highway networks in Canada.

The airport previously had scheduled service from Inuvik operated by Aklak Air. Service was cancelled in 2018 after the opening of the Inuvik–Tuktoyaktuk Highway created a permanent link between the communities and resulted in a drop in demand for air service.

==In popular culture==
*In the third episode of &quot;Jesse James Is a Dead Man&quot;, originally aired on 14 June 2009 on Spike TV, Jesse James rides his motorcycle from Inuvik to Tuktoyaktuk to drop off medical supplies.
*On 3 September 1995, the Molson Brewing Company arranged for several popular rock bands to perform in Tuktoyaktuk as a publicity stunt promoting its new ice-brewed beer. During the months leading up to concert, radio stations across North America ran contests in which they gave away free tickets. Dubbed &quot;The Molson Ice Polar Beach Party&quot;, it featured Hole, Metallica, Moist, Cake, and Veruca Salt. Canadian filmmaker Albert Nerenberg made a documentary about the concert, &quot;Invasion of the Beer People&quot;.
*Tuktoyaktuk is featured in the Discovery Channel TV show &quot;Ice Road Truckers&quot;.
*The imaginary Tuktoyaktuk University, abbreviated &quot;TUK-U&quot;, has been &quot;emblazoned on hundreds of thousands of T-shirts that travelled the world&quot;.

<text>Daniel L. Norris (August 30, 1935 – August 5, 2008) was the commissioner of the Northwest Territories from October 2, 1989, until September 30, 1994. Norris was born in 1935 near Inuvik and was raised in Aklavik. Norris died on August 5, 2008, from heart failure, a complication of his long-time struggle with diabetes.

==Biography==
Norris was born on August 30, 1935 near Inuvik in the Mackenzie Delta. Raised in Aklavik, Norris reportedly aspired to become a trapper like his father. Norris served for 27 years in the Northwest Territories government&#x27;s public service, including four years spent as a regional administrator in the Beaufort Delta. He began in the public sector in what was then the Department of Northern Affairs and National Resources, and rose within that department to become its regional superintendent of personnel.

On October 2, 1989, Norris was appointed as the territory&#x27;s 11th commissioner, making him the first Aboriginal born in the north of Canada to be appointed to that role. Between his appointment in 1989 and his leaving his role on September 30, 1994, Norris was forced to set out new protocols for the role of the Commissioner, as the position had some legislative function up until three years prior to Norris taking up the job.

==Death==
On August 5, 2008, Daniel Norris died in an Edmonton, Alberta hospital of heart failure, following a protracted struggle with diabetes. On August 7, Northwest Territories government buildings with flagpoles flew their flags at half-mast in memory of Norris, and on August 11, the day of his funeral, the same protocol was adopted.

<doc id="913228" wikidata="Q390295" url="?curid=913228" title="The Miracle (album)">
<text>The Miracle is the thirteenth studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 22 May 1989 by Parlophone Records and Capitol Records in both the United Kingdom and the U.S. respectively, where it was the band&#x27;s third and final studio album to be released on latter label, and their first studio album on the former label. The album was recorded as the band recovered from Brian May&#x27;s marital problems and Freddie Mercury&#x27;s HIV diagnosis in 1987 (which was known to the band, though not publicised at the time). Recording started in January 1988 and lasted for an entire year. The album was originally going to be called &quot;The Invisible Men&quot;, but three weeks before the release, according to Roger Taylor, they changed the name to &quot;The Miracle&quot;. It was also the last Queen album with a photo of the band on the front cover.

The album reached number one in the UK, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, and number 24 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Pop Albums chart. AllMusic would name &quot;The Miracle&quot; as Queen&#x27;s best album of the 1980s, along with &quot;The Game&quot;. It would prove to be the band&#x27;s penultimate album to be recorded with Freddie Mercury, as he died on 24 November 1991, nine months after their next album, &quot;Innuendo&quot;, was released.

==Songs==
===Side one===
====&quot;Party&quot;====
&quot;Party&quot; began as a jam session between Freddie Mercury, Brian May and John Deacon. Mercury was at the piano and he started off the &quot;we had a good night&quot; section. From then on the three of them worked together and completed it. May sings lead on a small portion of the song near the beginning.

====&quot;Khashoggi&#x27;s Ship&quot;====
&quot;Khashoggi&#x27;s Ship&quot; was started by Mercury with all four band members contributing to the lyrics and music. The song is about famous billionaire Adnan Khashoggi and a ship (the &quot;Nabila&quot;, now &quot;Kingdom 5KR&quot;) that he owned at the time and was one of the largest private yachts in the world. On the album, this track segues from &quot;Party&quot;, to which it has a very similar lyrical theme. The song served as the reference to the name of the Khashoggi character in the &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; musical.

====&quot;The Miracle&quot;====

&quot;The Miracle&quot; is one of the most complex songs from the band&#x27;s later years. Mercury and Deacon co-wrote the chords together. It is one of May&#x27;s favourite songs. The entire band contributed lyrical and some musical ideas, and Mercury played piano as well as many synth tracks, using a Korg M1 and a Roland D-50. The Collector&#x27;s Edition included an alternate version (&quot;Original Take with John&#x27;s Ending&quot;).

====&quot;I Want It All&quot;====

&quot;I Want It All&quot; was composed by May in 1987. On the &quot;&quot;Greatest Video Hits II&quot;&quot; DVD, May commented that the song was inspired by his second wife, Anita Dobson&#x27;s, favourite motto, &quot;I want it all, and I want it now!&quot; The idea of having intro, verses, choruses and solos over the same chord progression was reused on their next album with another May song, &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;, from 1991. Mercury sang lead vocals for most of the song, but Mercury and May share lead vocals during the bridge. Mercury played keyboards, May played acoustic and electric guitars while Taylor used double-kick bass drums for the first (and only) time.

====&quot;The Invisible Man&quot;====

&quot;The Invisible Man&quot; is Taylor&#x27;s first song on the album. The lyrical idea came from a book he was reading. May and Taylor commented (&quot;Queen for an Hour&quot; interview, 1989) that Taylor wrote part of the song in the bath (similarly to what happened with Mercury and &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot; ten years before). Each of the four band members are name-checked in the vocals by Freddie throughout the course of the song: &quot;Freddie Mercury&quot; right before the first verse begins (done by Roger Taylor), &quot;John Deacon&quot; after the first verse, &quot;Brian May&quot; (said twice) before his guitar solo, and &quot;Roger Taylor&quot; (with the initial &quot;r&quot; rolled by Mercury to sound like a drum roll) after the final chorus; Taylor &quot;answers&quot; with a drum fill. The demo version contains a completely different middle-eight with Mercury singing alternate lyrics in the style of Elvis Presley. The whispered parts of the chorus are sung by Taylor.

===Side two===
====&quot;Breakthru&quot;====

&quot;Breakthru&quot; is a combination of two songs: &quot;When Love Breaks Up&quot;, by Mercury, and &quot;Breakthru&quot;, written by Taylor with input by the others in the key change. Taylor&#x27;s mid-1980s songs tended to be in flat keys, when he started writing at the piano instead of on a guitar. This song was released as a single and made the top ten in the UK over the summer of 1989. &quot;When Love Breaks Up&quot; was eventually released as part of the 2022 &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;.

====&quot;Rain Must Fall&quot;====
&quot;Rain Must Fall&quot; is a collaboration between Deacon (music) and Mercury (lyrics). Taylor recorded a lot of Latin percussion but most of that was edited out in order to have more space for vocal harmonies, guitars and keyboards, the latter shared between Mercury and Deacon in this piece.

====&quot;Scandal&quot;====

&quot;Scandal&quot; was written by May about the British press, in the wake of media-fuelled controversy about his recent divorce, his relationship with Anita Dobson, and Mercury&#x27;s rare public appearances due to his battle with AIDS. May played keyboards and did the guitar solo as a first take. Mercury&#x27;s lead vocals were also a first take. Synth-bass is played by David Richards. May has since commented that the song is very close to his heart.

====&quot;My Baby Does Me&quot;====
&quot;My Baby Does Me&quot; is another collaboration of Mercury and Deacon. Both of them had the idea of a simpler track in order to ease off the album. In a Radio 1 interview in 1989, each of them claimed the other had constructed the bassline. The song was originally demoed as &quot;My Baby Loves Me&quot;, but was rewritten to replace the word &quot;loves&quot; with &quot;does&quot; throughout.

====&quot;Was It All Worth It&quot;====
&quot;Was It All Worth It&quot; was composed by Mercury. The song harks back to the band&#x27;s intricately produced sound in the 1970s. Though the bulk of the song was masterminded by Mercury, all members contributed ideas and lyrics (for example, Taylor contributed the line &quot;we love you madly!&quot;). Deacon later cited the song as his favourite on the album. Taylor uses a gong and timpani. Despite it not being released as a single, it remains hugely popular among the Queen fanbase.

===Non-album tracks===
====&quot;Hang on in There&quot;====
This song was initiated by Mercury, with lyrics that relate to his illness. The song&#x27;s working title was &quot;A Fiddly Jam&quot;. May plays both acoustic and electric guitars, as well as keyboards, a job he shared with Mercury, who also plays piano. The song originally appeared as the B-side to the &quot;I Want It All&quot; single. In the song, Mercury hits an E5 twice. The first time is after &quot;Your life is incomplete, Hang on in there&quot; the next line is sung &quot;Ha-ing there&quot;, the E5 is on the &quot;Ha&quot;. The second time is after &quot;Pray for that magical moment and it will appear&quot;, the next line is &quot;Pray for that moment&quot;, this E5 is on the &quot;Pray&quot;.

====&quot;Chinese Torture&quot;====
The only CD track that did not appear on a single release. For the first time this track emerged during the last concerts of Queen&#x27;s 1986 Magic Tour as part of May&#x27;s guitar solo. He also included it in his solos when he was back on tour with Queen + Paul Rodgers in 2005 and 2006.

====&quot;Stealin====
Principally composed by Mercury (though, as all other songs from these sessions, credited to the band as a whole), this song is a tongue-in-cheek representation of a man who spends his life committing robbery. The song is performed mainly through spoken words, but occasionally has lines sung. This song appeared in an edited form as the B-side to the &quot;Breakthru&quot; single.

====&quot;Hijack My Heart&quot;====
The song, credited to the band as an entity rather than one composer, was actually written by Taylor, who also provides lead vocals. It tells the story of a man who falls in love with a woman he meets, despite his original annoyance at her rudeness and mannerisms. It was the B-side to &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;.

====&quot;My Life Has Been Saved&quot;====
Written by Deacon (originally as an acoustic track) about the state the world is in, this song was the B-side to &quot;Scandal&quot;. A reworked version was later released on the 1995 &quot;Made in Heaven&quot; album.

===Unreleased songs and demos===
====&quot;Dog with a Bone&quot;====
This song was recorded in 1988 during the studio sessions of &quot;The Miracle&quot; album, but did not make the final album sequence. It was included in the 2022 box set &quot;The Miracle Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; in November 2022. A blues rock-style jam, it features lead vocals shared by Mercury and Taylor.

====&quot;Face It Alone&quot;====
&quot;Face It Alone&quot; was recorded during &quot;The Miracle&quot; sessions in 1988. The song was eventually released as a single on 13 October 2022. &quot;Face It Alone&quot; was written by all four members of Queen and was produced by David Richards, Kris Fredriksson and Justin Shirley-Smith. The song peaked at number 90 in the UK. An accompanying music video was released on October 21, 2022. The track was included on &quot;The Miracle Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;.

====&quot;You Know You Belong to Me&quot; &amp; &quot;Water&quot; &amp; &quot;I Guess We&#x27;re All Falling Out&quot; ====
All three Brian May compositions were included for the first time on &quot;The Miracle Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;. Only the last of these was worked on in the studio with May providing vocals for &quot;You Know You Belong to Me&quot; &amp; &quot;Water&quot; and Mercury providing vocals for &quot;I Guess We&#x27;re All Falling Out&quot;.

==Artwork==
The cover art was created by designer Richard Gray, utilising a chroma key and the Quantel Paintbox workstation, then state of the art image-manipulation technology, to combine photographs of the familiar faces of the four band members into one morphed image. This visual is in line with their decision to dispense with individual credits and simply present their music as the product of Queen; the back cover went a step further with a seamless regiment pattern of the band&#x27;s eyes. May said in 2022 that nowadays, it could easily be made in Photoshop but back then, the machinery required to produce the artwork was as big as a room and the process was very &quot;enterprising&quot; for its time.

==Singles==
Five singles were released from the album, all in 1989:

*&quot;I Want It All&quot; was the lead single from the album, released in the UK on 2 May; it hit number three in the British charts but made it to number one in numerous other European countries. The song became an anti-apartheid anthem among youth in South Africa and also has been used to protest other causes. This well-known anthem has been heard as a rallying song for African youth. The song became Queen&#x27;s first American rock radio hit since &quot;Under Pressure&quot; by peaking at number three on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Mainstream Rock Singles chart, but only reached number 50 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Chart.
*&quot;Breakthru&quot; was the second single from the album released in the UK on 19 June; its video was filmed on a private steam train known as The Miracle Express. The song peaked at number seven in the UK. The song was also released as a single in the US. Also appearing in the video was Debbie Leng, who was at the time Roger Taylor&#x27;s girlfriend.
*&quot;The Invisible Man&quot;, released in the UK on 7 August, hit number 12 in the UK and was a hit throughout Europe; the video showed scores of computer-duplicated band members moving in unison. This song was later covered by Scatman John.
*&quot;Scandal&quot; was the album&#x27;s fourth single, and peaked at number 25 in the UK. It is a protest song about the way the tabloids dealt with May&#x27;s relationship with Anita Dobson.
*&quot;The Miracle&quot; was the fifth and final single from the album, released on 27 November in the UK, reaching number 21 on the British charts. Its video involved young Queen lookalikes (including a then-unknown Ross McCall) who performed a Queen-style stage show. The real band appeared only at the end jamming with their younger counterparts.

==Critical reception==
The &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot; wrote &quot;With Freddie Mercury in vintage light-operatic form, here&#x27;s an album (like so many of Queen&#x27;s others) that should be used as a pop music how-to for aspirants. Combining the forces of rock, pop, metal, clever melodies and cunning stylisations, &quot;The Miracle&quot; never lets down. From one track to the next there is, as usual, no telling which way this band will go, affording even the most jaded ear a challenge.&quot;

&quot;Newsday&quot; (Melville, NY) wrote &quot;On &quot;The Miracle&quot;, Mercury&#x27;s voice is steady and solid, May&#x27;s runs are as flashy and supple as ever. Most of the 10 songs, written collaboratively by the four members, stick pretty much to the band&#x27;s formula of mini-suites: edgy pop with tempos that change half-way into the number and some delicious hooks.&quot;

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated &quot;&quot;The Miracle&quot; is a showcase for Freddie Mercury and his love of sweeping, quasi-operatic vocals. And indeed, Mercury – especially on the title track – has never sounded better... Only on a few tracks (&quot;Khashoggi&#x27;s Ship&quot; and &quot;Was It All Worth It&quot;) does May really let it rip, and when he does, it&#x27;s like the old Queen peeping out for just a moment and then turning tail... At least &quot;The Miracle&quot; offers little snippets of Queen&#x27;s former majesty.&quot;

AllMusic stated &quot;&quot;The Miracle&quot; packs quite a sonic punch, recalling the rich sounds of their past classics (1976&#x27;s &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;, etc.). Split 50/50 between pop and heavy rock, the album was another global smash. Along with &quot;The Game&quot;, &quot;The Miracle&quot; is Queen&#x27;s strongest album of the &#x27;80s.&quot;

==2022 box set reissue ==
In October 2022, Queen announced plans for a November 18 reissue of the album, featuring six unreleased tracks, four featuring Mercury as the lead vocalist. Queen said that the eight-disc collection contains alternate takes, demos, and radio interviews.

As part of the announcement, Queen released the previous unheard song &quot;Face It Alone&quot;. &quot;We did find a little gem from Freddie, that we&#x27;d kind of forgotten about,&quot; Taylor said of the track. &quot;It&#x27;s wonderful, a real discovery. It&#x27;s a very passionate piece.&quot;

Of the song, May said:
&quot;It was kind of hiding in plain sight. We looked at it many times and thought, oh no, we can&#x27;t really rescue that. But in fact, we went in there again and our wonderful engineering team went, &#x27;OK, we can do this and this.&#x27; It&#x27;s like kind of stitching bits together... but it&#x27;s beautiful, it&#x27;s touching.&quot;

The other unreleased tracks are &quot;When Love Breaks Up&quot; (Mercury), &quot;You Know You Belong to Me&quot; (May), &quot;Dog with a Bone&quot; (Taylor), &quot;Water&quot; (May) and &quot;I Guess We&#x27;re Falling Out&quot; (May).

<text>Palghar () is a prominent town in the Konkan division of Maharashtra state, India, and a municipal council. It is strategically located within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, and since 2014, it has been the administrative capital of the Palghar district. Palghar plays a crucial role in Western Line of the Mumbai Suburban Railway in the busy Mumbai-Ahmedabad rail corridor. The town is located approximately 87 kilometers north of Mumbai, about 35 kilometers north of Virar, and about 24 kilometers west of the Mumbai-Ahmedabad National Highway at Manor and Mumbai is approximately 50+ km from Palghar.

== History ==
Palghar has a history intertwined with the ancient district of Thane. The tehsils of Jawhar, Vasai, and Palghar are known for their rich historical legacy.

Palghar also played a crucial role in the Quit India Movement of 1942, where it was one of the important points in the Chalejav Movement.

== Demographics ==
At the 2011 census of India, Palghar had a population of 68,930. Males numbered 36,523 (52.9%) and females 32,407 (47.1%). The literacy rate was 77.52%, higher than the national average of 59.5%; male literacy was 81.2% and female literacy 73.35%. 11.8% of the population was under 6 years of age.

Marathi is the most widely spoken language with Varli, Vadvali and Vanjari dialects. Followed by Gujarati spoken by a sizeable Gujarati and Muslim population.

Palghar has an urban population of 33,086, thus about 48% of the total population lives in the urbanized area.

== Culture ==
Various communities inhabit Palghar, with the predominant castes being the Kunbi, Mangela, Vaity, Macchimar, Bhandari, Warli (Adivasi), Katkari, Malhar Koli, Vanjari, Vadval, and Mali (Sorathi).

The Vanjaris are a nomadic tribe with origins in Chittorgarh, Rajasthan. Their language is distinct from standard Marathi, with significant influences from Rajasthani and Gujarati.

The Vadval community is the most numerous in Palghar. They are believed to be descendants of the Yadava dynasty of Devagiri, who settled in the region. The Vadvals are unique as one of the few Marathi-speaking communities belonging to the Kshatriya varna but not part of the traditional 96-clan (&quot;96-Kuli&quot;) Maratha caste.

The Warli painting and the renowned Tarpa dance highlight the artistic contributions of the Warli community. Warli art has a history stretching back over a millennium and is celebrated internationally. The Warlis are considered some of the earliest settlers in the region, and their culture has significantly influenced the subsequent cultures in and around Palghar.

The Koli (fishermen) community of Palghar is a testament to the city&#x27;s connection with the Arabian Sea. Fishing forms a significant part of Palghar&#x27;s trade and diet and plays a crucial role in cultural events. The Kolis are further divided into subcastes such as Vaity, Mangela, and Bari.

== Economy ==
The economy of Palghar is primarily driven by the primary and tertiary sectors. As the administrative seat of the Taluka and District, Palghar hosts numerous government offices, providing employment opportunities to many residents.

Agriculture, Animal husbandry, dairy farming, and fisheries are extensively practiced in the rural areas surrounding the city, playing a significant role in fueling the local economy. The region is known for its production of rice, fruits, and dairy products.

Historically, Palghar was notorious for wood smuggling in the post-independence era. This illicit activity has been largely curbed due to stringent measures by the Forest Department and local police. Additionally, the region&#x27;s secluded beaches were once favored by smugglers who used them to offload goods and transport them to Mumbai by road to evade customs.

== Transport ==
Palghar is well connected via road and rail transport. The town serves as a divisional head of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC), providing direct connectivity to several towns across Maharashtra and Gujarat, including Surat, Vapi, Valsad, Vadodara, Bharuch, Ankleshwar, Anand, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Miraj, Sangli, Pune, Vaduj, Thane, Ulhasnagar, Bhiwandi, Aurangabad, Ahmednagar, Kalyan, Alibag, Nandurbar, Bhusaval, Shirdi, and Nashik.

The Palghar railway station is a significant stop on the Western Line of the Mumbai Suburban Railway and the Ahmedabad–Mumbai main line. In addition to Shuttle/MEMU/EMU (local trains) services, many long-distance trains also halt at this station.

== Sports ==
Cricket is the most popular sport in Palghar. Local tournaments are held at various locations in the district.

<text>The Edinburgh International Book Festival (EIBF) is a book festival that takes place during two weeks in August every year in the centre of Edinburgh, Scotland. Described as &quot;The largest festival of its kind in the world&quot;, the festival hosts a series of cultural and political talks and debates, along with a well-established children&#x27;s events programme.

It overlaps the Edinburgh International Festival and the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, as well as some of the other events that comprise the Edinburgh Festival. Jenny Niven is the Director and CEO.

== History ==
The first Book Festival took place in a tent in Edinburgh in 1983. Initially a biennial event, it began to be held annually in 1997. It is a large (225,000 visitors in 2015) and growing international event, central to Edinburgh&#x27;s acclaimed August arts celebrations. Perhaps partly as a result of this, Edinburgh was named the first UNESCO City of Literature in 2004. The Festival in Charlotte Square was cancelled in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic but some events were held online.

== Programme ==
In 2016 there were over 800 authors and others from over 55 countries in the 17 days that the festival ran. Events ranged from writing workshops, education events, panel discussions, to talks and performances by international writers, poets, playwrights, musicians, illustrators, historians and philosophers. There are events for both adults and children.Past festivals have featured the likes of:


Running alongside the general programme is a Children&#x27;s programme. Incorporating workshops, storytelling, panel discussions, author events and book signings, the Children&#x27;s programme is popular with both the public and schools alike, and is among the world&#x27;s largest books and reading event for young people. It regularly attracts authors like Jacqueline Wilson, Joan Lingard, Charlie Higson and Anne Fine.

There is also an Unbound programme which takes place in the evening, with free music and spoken word events sponsored by Edinburgh Gin.

In May 2016 a pilot satellite literary event, organised by the Book Festival, took place in Falkirk called LandWords. In August 2016, using the name Booked!, the Book Festival held events in three other locations in Scotland (Aberdeen, Greenock and Galashiels). This expansion was partially funded by the People&#x27;s Postcode Lottery.

== Venue ==

Until 2019, the festival was primarily held in a set of marquees in Charlotte Square Gardens, Edinburgh, at the west end of George Street. In 2017, the event and some venues expanded into George Street, partly to cope with visitor numbers but also to reduce the festival&#x27;s impact on the privately owned gardens.

In 2021, the festival moved to the Edinburgh College of Art, where it stayed until 2023. In 2024, it moved to a new permanent home at the University of Edinburgh Futures Institute on the site of the former Royal Infirmary in Lauriston Place, with some events taking place in other nearby venues.

==Fringe events==
As with all large and successful festivals, the Book Festival has sprouted a number of fringe events over the years. In 2004 and 2006 an event called Thirsty Lunch promoted itself as a cheap, non-establishment alternative.

In 2008 there were two separate festivals running at the same time as the main Book Festival. The first was the Edinburgh Book Fringe, which held its events at the Word Power (now Lighthouse) bookshop on Nicolson Street, Edinburgh. The Book Fringe still runs as of 2023, now holding events at the nearby Argonaut and Typewronger bookshops, as well as in its original home. The second was the West Port Book Festival, which was centred on second-hand/antiquarian bookshops in the West Port area of the city. The latter ran from 2008 until 2012. Both fringe festivals provided free events and were seen as a less formal alternatives to the main festival.

== Sponsorship controversy ==
In 2023, an open letter signed by over 50 authors threatened to boycott the 2024 festival over its main sponsor, Baillie Gifford, an investment firm with &quot;up to £5bn invested in corporations that profit from fossil fuels&quot;. This followed environmental activist Greta Thunberg pulling out of the festival over the sponsorship, accusing the firm of greenwashing by sponsoring cultural events.

In May 2024, the festival announced that it was terminating Baillie Gifford&#x27;s sponsorship.

<text>Alpha Xi Delta (, often referred to as A-&quot;Zee&quot;-D) is a women&#x27;s fraternity founded on April 17, 1893 at Lombard College in Galesburg, Illinois, United States.

Alpha Xi Delta is a member of National Panhellenic Conference (NPC), the umbrella organization of 26 national sororities. The sorority has over 171,000 initiated members and maintains active chapters at 130 institutions across the United States.

== Early history ==

In 1893, ten young women at Lombard College in Galesburg, Illinois founded Alpha Xi Delta. They ranged in age from 16 to 26.

The ten founders were:

* Cora Bollinger Block (1869–1944) was the first President of Alpha Xi Delta. She went on to be the first Grand President, and a community leader in Davenport, Iowa.
* Alice Bartlett Bruner (1878–1966) was an organist who taught music at the Lombard Conservatory. She had two daughters who later joined the sorority.
* Bertha Cook Evans (1874–1957) had three daughters, two of whom joined Alpha Xi Delta. Later in her life, she served as a fraternity house director.
* Harriett Luella McCollum (1874–1948) left Lombard College soon after the founding of the fraternity, due to poor health. She was a feminist who had a long career as a lecturer and author on the psychological causes of crime, and who campaigned for the abolition of capital punishment.
* Lucy W. Gilmer (1872–1939) was the first Vice President of Alpha Xi Delta. She studied to be a nurse.
* Lewie Strong Taylor (1867–1950) designed the quill symbol. She became a teacher and homemaker in Salt Lake City, Utah.
* Almira Lowry Cheney (1875–1946) was a teacher who went on to pioneer religious education by becoming a minister of the Universalist Church. She was also Chaplain of the 12th, 13th, and 14th National Conventions for Alpha Xi Delta.
* Frances Elizabeth Cheney (1869–1901), in her time as an Alpha Xi, served as chaplain, secretary, and president. She is given credit for many of the fraternity&#x27;s early songs. She served as a Unitarian pastor before her death at the age of 32.
* Eliza Drake Curtis Everton (1867–1934) was a widow when she attended Lombard&#x27;s Ryder Divinity School. She became a Universalist minister.
* Julia Maude Foster (1875–1948) was a member of the committee that drafted Alpha Xi Delta&#x27;s first constitution. She spent her professional career as a teacher of young children.

In 1904, the sorority joined the National Panhellenic Conference. Alpha Xi Delta&#x27;s Ella Boston Leib was NPC Chair in 1906. Lena Grandin Baldwin, an Alpha Xi Delta who served as NPC Chairman from 1912 to 1915, wrote the Panhellenic Creed.

Alpha Xi Delta was referred to as a sorority until 1913 when the term &quot;women&#x27;s fraternity&quot; was adopted.
== Symbols ==

The colors of Alpha Xi Delta are double blue (light and dark) and gold. The fraternity flower is the pink rose, as chosen by the founders to complement the white rose of Sigma Nu fraternity, whose brothers helped to found Alpha Xi Delta at Lombard College.

Alpha Xi Delta&#x27;s badge is the shape of a quill, with the fraternity&#x27;s Greek letters on the barbs of the feathers. It may only be worn by initiated members in good standing. The quill represents the open motto &quot;The Pen is Mightier than the Sword.&quot; A variety of designs were produced in the early years of the fraternity; a standard design was devised by 1911.

The Coat of Arms is described as: &quot;... a shield supported by two griffins. In the golden band across the center of the shield is the Quill. Three conventional roses are at the top of the shield, and a broken sword is in the lower portion of the shield. Above the shield on the knight&#x27;s helmet is a twist of ribbon in alternating blue and gold, and a blossomed rose.&quot;

BetXi Bear has been the fraternity&#x27;s official mascot since 1989.

=== Symphony ===

Alpha Xi Delta&#x27;s open creed is called &quot;The Symphony of Alpha Xi Delta&quot;, and it lists the ideals of the fraternity&#x27;s members. It was written in 1924 by Helen Willis Lynn, Alice Matthews, and Almira Cheney, one of the founders.&quot;These things do we earnestly desire: A clear vision of life, that with gracious and kindly hearts we may share both joy and sorrow and bring into living reality the Sisterhood of women. An appreciation of real merit and worth, steadfastness of soul, that without bitterness or defeat, we may encounter misfortune and with humility meet success. These things, O Lord, help us to instill within our hearts that we may grow in courage and graciousness and peace.&quot;
== Philanthropy ==

Alpha Xi Delta has supported a variety of philanthropies over its history. In 2022, building on the success of the Kindly Hearts Campaign of 2021 (support for those affected by the Covid-19 pandemic) Alpha Xi Delta announced its new national philanthropy: the Kindly Hearts Initiative (support for children experiencing foster care or homelessness.) From 2009 to 2021, its national philanthropic partner was Autism Speaks. The sorority raised more than $12 million for Autism Speaks.
=== The AmaXIng Challenge ===
Each college chapter participates annually in one of six events called &quot;The AmaXing Challenge: Step It Up; Xi Man/Xi Woman; Sports FrenXi; Xi Games; Xi Karaoke; or AmaXing Gala. Funds that are raised support the Kindly Hearts Initiative.

=== Letters of Love ===
In November of each year, collegiate and alumnae members participate in an online letter-writing project to raise funds and awareness effort. Letters of Love supports two &quot;key impact&quot; organizations: FosterClub and StandUp for Kids.

== Membership ==

=== Eligibility ===
&quot;Alpha Xi Delta Fraternity is a private women&#x27;s membership organization for individuals who live and self-identify as women. Members are selected following a series of one or more meetings, social events, and/or interviews by existing Fraternity members (which may include National Fraternity representatives and/or National Council designees). Each woman selected for membership in Alpha Xi Delta must demonstrate academic achievement, be of good character, have the desire to contribute to the Fraternity&#x27;s mission and vision and be able to contribute to the overall prestige of Alpha Xi Delta. In addition, she must be neither a pledged member nor a past or present initiated member of any other National Panhellenic Conference fraternity, or any similar single–gender national college or university fraternity, with the exception of honorary and professional organizations.&quot;

== Notable members ==
== Controversies and misconduct ==

=== Women at Georgia Tech ===
After several failed attempts, women were admitted for the first time at Georgia Tech in the 1950s. To help support the first women on campus, women&#x27;s advocate and Alpha Xi Delta alumna Ella Wall Van Leer helped establish a chapter of Alpha Xi Delta on the Georgia Tech campus. Ella and her husband Blake R Van Leer were also credited for the first steps towards integration at Georgia Tech due to their stand against the state Governor.

=== Ending racial barriers ===
An event from the waning days of World War II showcases the intensity whereby collegiate members were beginning to break from cultural norms that were common until those decades of change. Few Black students attended the University of Vermont by mid-century - there were only two enrolled in 1943. Many of the student body, including the majority of members of the ΑΞΔ chapter on the campus had agitated in 1945–46 for the removal of racial and religious quotas that had limited enrollment for decades.

In October 1945, Crystal Malone, one of the few Black students, was a junior on the Burlington campus of the University of Vermont. The Upsilon chapter of Alpha Xi Delta offered her membership. Although the fraternity constitution did not have explicit racial restrictions, the National Council ordered the local chapter to withdraw its offer. They refused. The National President, Winnafred Corwin Robinson (Mrs. Beverly Robinson) ordered the chapter closed.

Today, the fraternity&#x27;s constitution and bylaws state: &quot;Alpha Xi Delta Fraternity believes it is inherent in our principles not to discriminate based on religion, race, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, veteran status, citizenship, or age.&quot;

Crystal Malone later married the first Black graduate of the United States Naval Academy, Wesley A. Brown. She had a long career as a teacher and community leader.

=== Local chapter misconduct ===
The official policy of the National Fraternity is that: &quot;All initiated members of Alpha Xi Delta, are responsible for upholding the values and principles of the Fraternity at all times.&quot; Local chapters also are required to abide by the policies of their college and NPC. Chapters that violate health, safety, and other policies are subject to disciplinary action from the National Council. Some examples are:

* In 2010, the Miami University chapter of Alpha Xi Delta was suspended until 2014 for alcohol violations stemming from their destructive formal at Cincinnati&#x27;s National Underground Railroad Freedom Center. In 2019, the sorority recolonized and no longer recognizes the members of the class involved in the incident.
* In 2017, the University of Central Florida chapter of Alpha Xi Delta was suspended on the grounds of &quot;allegations of alcohol-related misconduct, which includes providing alcohol to someone underage; hazing; and possessing and/or providing false and misleading information and/or falsification of university records.&quot;

<text>Elm Springs is a two-story, brick house built in 1837 in the Greek Revival style. It is located just outside Columbia, Tennessee, United States. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986 and has served as the headquarters for the Sons of Confederate Veterans since 1992.

==History==
The house was built in 1837 by brothers James and Nathaniel Dick, wealthy New Orleans cotton merchants, as a gift for their sister, Sarah Todd. Sarah and her husband, Christopher Todd, lived in Elm Springs for the rest of their lives. After their deaths, the property went to their daughter, Susan Todd. She was the wife of Abraham M. Looney, a prominent attorney in Maury County and a Tennessee State Senator.

During the Civil War, Looney was an outspoken southerner and served in the Confederate States Army as a captain in command of Company H, 1st Tennessee Infantry which Sam Watkins of &quot;Company Aytch&quot; fame was a member. Looney was later promoted to lieutenant colonel. In November 1864 Confederate units of the Army of Tennessee began the march north for Nashville in the ill-fated Franklin-Nashville Campaign. The Union Army, which had occupied Maury County for several months, was preparing defensive positions ahead of the oncoming Confederate troops under General John B. Hood in a line of defense extending from the Mooresville Pike to the Mount Pleasant Pike. As Union forces under the command of General John M. Schofield began their hasty withdrawal from Columbia, they began destroying important buildings along the line of withdrawal by fire as a defensive tactic, and many of Maury County&#x27;s antebellum homes were destroyed. Elm Springs anchored the eastern flank of their line and was slated for destruction as the last Union troops left Columbia. Responding to pleas from local citizens, Confederate Brigadier General Frank C. Armstrong dispatched a squad of mounted infantry to ensure the safety of Lieutenant Colonel Looney&#x27;s home and property. The house likely would have burned down if it had not been for the arrival of Confederate troops who extinguished the fires they found.

The Akin family acquired the property about 1910 and in 1985 the Gillham family purchased it and restored it to near original state. On March 4, 1946, Mr. Howard Blocker and his wife, Rebecca T. Blocker purchased the estate. Mr. Blocker owned Columbia Paving and was a prominent member of the city. Mr. Blocker passed away and Mrs. Blocker held the home until the 1970&#x27;s. In 1992 it became the headquarters of the Sons of Confederate Veterans and the Military Order of the Stars and Bars. Together, the two organizations co-published a magazine, &quot;Confederate Veteran&quot;. In late 2005, the organizations separated over political differences and the Military Order of Stars and Bars moved from Elm Springs to Daphne, Alabama.

<text>The men&#x27;s 100 metres was of one of 23 track events of the [[athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics]], in Athens. It was contested at the Athens Olympic Stadium, from August 21 to 22, by a total of 82 sprinters from 62 nations. Each nation was limited to 3 athletes per rules in force since the 1930 Olympic Congress. 

The event was won by Justin Gatlin of the United States, the nation&#x27;s second consecutive title and 16th overall in the event. Portugal earned its first medal in the men&#x27;s 100 metres, with Francis Obikwelu&#x27;s silver. The final was the fastest and most disputed in Olympic history, with six runners covering the distance in 10.00 seconds or less (four of them under the 9.90 mark), and the gold and bronze medalist athletes separated by 0.02 seconds.
The medals for the competition were presented by Juan Antonio Samaranch, IOC Honorary President for Life, Spain; and the medalists&#x27; bouquets were presented by Lamine Diack, IAAF President, Senegal.

==Background==

This was the twenty-fifth time the event was held, having appeared at every Olympics since the first in 1896. All three finalists from 2000 returned: defending gold medalist Maurice Greene of the United States, silver medalist Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago, and bronze medalist Obadele Thompson of Barbados, along with three other finalists (Darren Campbell of Great Britain, Kim Collins of Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Aziz Zakari of Ghana). Two-time silver medalist (1992 and 1996) Frankie Fredericks of Namibia also returned after missing the Sydney Games with injury. 

Collins was the reigning (2003) world champion, as well as Commonwealth champion. Francis Obikwelu of Portugal had won the 2002 European Championship. On the United States team, along with an aging Greene (still a medal contender, but no longer as dominant as in 2000), was a young Justin Gatlin.

Aruba, Jordan, Kiribati, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Slovenia appeared in the event for the first time. The United States made its 24rd appearance in the event, most of any country, having missed only the boycotted 1980 Games.

==Qualification==

The Olympic qualification period for the athletics ran from 1 January 2003 to 9 August 2004. For this event, each National Olympic Committee (NOC) was permitted to enter up to three athletes, provided they had run below 10.21 seconds during this period in IAAF-sanctioned meetings or tournaments. If a NOC had no athletes qualified under this standard, it could enter up to one athlete that had run below 10.28 seconds.

==Competition format==

The event retained the same basic four round format introduced in 1920: heats, quarterfinals, semifinals, and a final. The &quot;fastest loser&quot; system, introduced in 1968, was used again to ensure that the quarterfinals and subsequent rounds had exactly 8 runners per heat; this time, the system was used in both the heats and quarterfinals.

The first round consisted of 10 heats, each with 8 or 9 athletes. The top three runners in each heat advanced, along with the next ten fastest runners overall. This made 40 quarterfinalists, who were divided into 5 heats of 8 runners. The top three runners in each quarterfinal advanced, with one &quot;fastest loser&quot; place. The 16 semifinalists competed in two heats of 8, with the top four in each semifinal advancing to the eight-man final.

==Records==
, the existing world record, Olympic record, and world leading time were as follows.

No new records were set during the competition.

==Schedule==


==Results==

===Round 1===

Qualification rule: The first three finishers in each heat (Q) plus the ten fastest times of those who finished fourth or lower in their heat (q) qualified.

====Semifinal 1====

====Semifinal 2====

===Final===

In the final, the slowest to react was Justin Gatlin, still with the most powerful first steps, Gatlin led from the gun, with Kim Collins, the next slowest to react, also getting a typically fast start (typically in lane 1). A step behind, back from injuries, defending champion Maurice Greene, was fastest to react but running sideways in quicksand. He was joined by Francis Obikwelu and Shawn Crawford, who had a slight edge on the other competitors in the center of the track. Collins faded as Obikwelu, Crawford and Greene gained. Feeling his lead disappearing rapidly, Gatlin leaned early still maintaining the lead across the line. The tall Obikwelu perfectly timed his dip to clearly grab silver. Crawford&#x27;s finish occurred two meters too late giving Greene another medal with the same time as his win four years earlier.

<text>The women&#x27;s 100 metres at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] as part of the athletics program were held at the Athens Olympic Stadium from August 20 to 21.

In the first round, the first three runners from each of the eight heats, together with the eight next fastest overall runners (8×3+8=32), automatically qualified for the second round. In the second round, these thirty-two runners competed in four heats, with the first three from each heat and the four next fastest overall (4×3+4=16) advancing to the semifinals. In the semifinals, only the first four runners from each of the two heats move on to the final (2×4=8).

With some of the world&#x27;s most promising sprinters, including 2000 Olympic champion Marion Jones and home favorite Ekaterini Thanou, absent, the race had become widely open in the final. The start was notably uneven as Bulgaria&#x27;s Ivet Lalova and Jamaica&#x27;s Sherone Simpson jumped into upright running positions quickly from the blocks, while Simpson&#x27;s Jamaican teammates Aleen Bailey and Veronica Campbell and American favorite Lauryn Williams got out behind. Campbell further seemed to stumble while Williams powerfully overstride from last into the lead in the middle of the track by the halfway mark. Simpson faded quickly from her fast start being overtaken by Belarusian sprinter Yulia Nestsiarenka, who attempted to find her stride with just 30 metres into the race on the outside. While Williams and Campbell found their stride to maintain a commanding lead towards the 60-metre mark, Nestsiarenka held off a late charge to continue her march past the field and produce a storming finish with a Belarusian record of 10.93 seconds, making her the nation&#x27;s first Olympic champion in this event. Following an unexpected victory from Nestsiarenka, Williams edged the fast closing Campbell for a silver medal by a hundredth of a second, finishing at 10.96.

<text>The men&#x27;s 200 metres at the 2004 Summer Olympics as part of the athletics program was held at the Athens Olympic Stadium from August 24 to 26. There were 54 competitors from 41 nations. The event was won by 0.22 seconds by Shawn Crawford of the United States, the nation&#x27;s 17th victory in the men&#x27;s 200 metres after missing the podium entirely four years prior. His teammates Bernard Williams (silver) and Justin Gatlin (bronze) completed the sixth American sweep in the event and first since 1984.

Barely turned eighteen, Usain Bolt came to the Olympics injured and was not able to compete at the level he had achieved earlier in the season. He was eliminated in the heats in his only Olympic defeat. He would eventually go on to win double gold at the Beijing Games, and triple at the London and Rio Olympics.
==Background==

This was the 24th appearance of the event, which was not held at the first Olympics in 1896 but has been on the program ever since. Two of the eight finalists from the 2000 Games returned: silver medalist Darren Campbell and fifth-place finisher Christian Malcolm, both of Great Britain. The 1992 and 1996 silver medalist, Frankie Fredericks of Namibia, had missed the 2000 Games due to injury but returned in 2004. Reigning Olympic champion Konstantinos Kenteris of Greece missed a drug test the day before the Games opened, resulting in his suspension.

Azerbaijan, the Czech Republic, Palau, and Slovenia each made their debut in the event. The United States made its 23rd appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the boycotted 1980 Games.

==Summary==

The final pool looked similar to the 100 metres final pool, with the favorites, Justin Gatlin, Francis Obikwelu and Shawn Crawford in the center of the track. Bernard Williams also was in the final, along with perennial silver medalist Frankie Fredericks. From the gun, Williams near the inside got a clearly better start, quickly making up a step on the stagger to Crawford to his outside. But through the turn, Crawford maintained the distance while running the further distance. Crawford and Gatlin ran about even last portion of the turn looked more powerful than Williams and Gatlin on either side. By the end of the turn, it was the three Americans in the lead, led by Crawford, Obikwelu the closest challenger a step behind. Crawford separated from Gatlin at the head of the straight and the race was for second. Gatlin held the edge down the straight until the last ten metres when Gatlin seemed to struggle and Williams cruised to silver. Next to last at the beginning of the straight, veteran Fredericks gained steadily and was able to dip past Obikwelu for fourth, but not enough to break up the American sweep.

==Qualification==
The Olympic qualification period for the athletics ran from 1 January 2003 to 9 August 2004. For this event, each National Olympic Committee (NOC) was permitted to enter up to three athletes, provided they had run below 20.59 seconds during this period in IAAF-sanctioned meetings or tournaments. If a NOC had no athletes qualified under this standard, it could enter up to one athlete that had run below 20.75 seconds.

==Competition format==

The competition used the four round format introduced in 1920: heats, quarterfinals, semifinals, and a final. The &quot;fastest loser&quot; system introduced in 1960 was used in the heats and quarterfinals.

There were 7 heats of 7 or 8 runners each, with the top 4 men in each advancing to the quarterfinals along with the next 4 fastest overall. The quarterfinals consisted of 4 heats of 8 athletes each; the 3 fastest men in each heat and the next 4 fastest overall advanced to the semifinals. There were 2 semifinals, each with 8 runners. The top 4 athletes in each semifinal advanced. The final had 8 runners. The races were run on a 400 metre track.

==Records==
, the existing world, Olympic record, and world leading time were as follows:

No new world or Olympic records were set during the competition.

==Schedule==

The competition used a three-day schedule rather than a two-day schedule, splitting the semifinals and final into two days. The three-day schedule had previously been used in 1992, but before that had last been used in 1908.

<text>The women&#x27;s 200 metres at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] as part of the athletics program were held at the Athens Olympic Stadium from August 24 to 26. The winning margin was 0.13 seconds. The winner had the second slowest reaction time in the final.

The top four runners in each of the initial seven heats automatically qualified for the second round. The next four fastest runners from across the heats also qualified. Those 32 runners competed in four heats in the second round, with the top three from each heat and the four next fastest overall advancing to the semifinals. In two semifinal heats, only the top four runners from each heat moved on to the final.

Leading up to the Olympic final, Jamaica&#x27;s Veronica Campbell was considered a pre-race favorite of this event, as she had previously managed to beat her own world leading time in the semifinals. She was also expected to challenge the youngster Allyson Felix, who had quickly become the top medal contender for the Americans. From the blocks, Campbell took a commanding lead with a strong curve and kept her form in the last few strides of the track to hold off a charge from Felix for the Olympic title at 22.05 seconds. Felix closed the race quickly to get the silver medal and set the world junior record. On the outside, Bahamian sprinter Debbie Ferguson was immediately chased by Campbell&#x27;s teammate Aleen Bailey, but the places were clearly decided.

<text>The men&#x27;s 400 metres at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] as part of the athletics program were held at the Athens Olympic Stadium from August 20 to 23. Sixty-two athletes from 48 nations competed. The event was won by Jeremy Wariner of the United States, the sixth in what would ultimately be 7 consecutive American victories stretching from 1984 to 2008 and the 18th overall title in the event by the United States. The United States swept the podium for the 4th time in the event (1904, 1968, 1988).
==Summary==

The first round had split a full roster of runners into eight heats with the first two gaining a direct qualification and then the next eight fastest across all heats advancing to the semifinals. The top two runners in each of the three semifinal heats moved on directly to the final, and they were immediately joined by the next two fastest from any of the semifinals.

At the start, Otis Harris, Jeremy Wariner, and Derrick Brew stormed out from the blocks to take a powerful lead over the rest of the field. Harris commanded the top position for the Americans throughout the race, but in the final turn he was chased down by Wariner. Slightly behind coming off the turn, Wariner stormed ahead over the last hundred metres to win the race at 44.00 seconds, the fastest time ever recorded in this event since American legend Michael Johnson won the gold in Sydney 2000. Harris held on to take the silver with Brew separating from the pack over the final straight to give the United States a sweep of the medal podium for the third time in the event&#x27;s Olympic history, having previously managed at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics and the 1988 Seoul Olympics.

At the end of the final, seven sprinters managed to finish the race under 45 seconds, and five personal bests were recorded.

==Background==

This was the 25th appearance of the event, which is one of 12 athletics events to have been held at every Summer Olympics. None of the finalists from 2000 returned; the only medalist from the 2003 world championships to compete was bronze winner Michael Blackwood of Jamaica. The American team of Jeremy Wariner, Otis Harris, and Derrick Brew was strong, even without two-time defending champion Michael Johnson, who had retired. Their top competition was Alleyne Francique of Grenada, the Central American and Caribbean champion and indoor champion.

Dominica, Guinea-Bissau, Slovenia, and Uruguay appeared in this event for the first time. The United States made its 24th appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the boycotted 1980 Games.

==Qualification==

The qualification period for athletics was 1 January 2003 to 9 August 2004. For the men&#x27;s 400 metres, each National Olympic Committee was permitted to enter up to three athletes that had run the race in 45.55 seconds or faster during the qualification period. If an NOC had no athletes that qualified under that standard, one athlete that had run the race in 45.95 seconds or faster could be entered.

==Competition format==

In the first significant change in format since 1964, the competition was reduced from four rounds to three; it was the first time since 1912 that only three rounds were held. The &quot;fastest loser&quot; system, introduced in 1964, was used for the first round and semifinals (the first time it was used for semifinals, as the shift from four rounds to three meant that there were three semifinals instead of two). There were 8 first-round heats, each with 7 or 8 runners (before a withdrawal reduced one heat to 6). The top two runners in each heat advanced, along with the next eight fastest overall. The 24 semifinalists were divided into 3 heats of 8 runners each. The top two runners in each semifinal heat and the next two fastest overall advanced, making an eight-man final.

==Records==

These were the standing world record, Olympic record, and world leading time (in seconds) prior to the 2004 Summer Olympics.

No world or Olympic records were set in this event.

The following national records were established during the competition:

==Schedule==

Since 1984, all rounds have been held on separate days.

The first round had split a full roster of runners into eight heats with the first three gaining a direct qualification and then the next six fastest across all heats advancing to the semifinals. The top two runners in each of the three semifinal heats moved on directly to the final, and they are immediately joined by the next two fastest from any of the semifinals.

Coming into the final, the fastest qualifiers were Monique Hennagan and Natalya Antyukh challenging each other in their semi final, Tonique Williams-Darling racing DeeDee Trotter in theirs, with world champion Ana Guevara cruising her semi final just staying ahead of Christine Amertil. In the final, Hennagan again went for the lead with Amertil and Natalya Nazarova each taking their shot at her in the first 200, only to fade after. Starting slightly slower, Williams came on strongly on the backstretch, marked by Guevara around the second turn. Coming off the turn Guevara had Williams where she wanted her, and Sanya Richards about even with Hennigan a couple of steps behind, with Antyukh and Trotter another step behind. Less than 50 meters from the finish, Guevara moved into the lead, but Williams kicked it into a different gear and pulled away to finish with gold. On the inside, Trotter rocketed past Richards and was gaining on Hennagan. Hennagan tried to fight, long striding with a slowing cadence to the finish, losing ground to a fast closing Antyukh. Defeated, Guevara gave up the fight and glided across the finish line with silver. 3 meters back, Antyukh clearly beat a wilting Hennagan, who still managed to hold off the fast closing Trotter.

<text>The men&#x27;s 400 metres hurdles at the 2004 Summer Olympics as part of the athletics program were held at the Athens Olympic Stadium from August 23 to 26. There were 35 competitors from 24 nations. The event was won by Félix Sánchez of the Dominican Republic, the nation&#x27;s first medal in the men&#x27;s 400 metres hurdles. Silver went to Danny McFarlane of Jamaica, returning to the podium in the event for the first time since 1992. Naman Keïta&#x27;s bronze was France&#x27;s first medal in the event in over 100 years; the last Frenchman to medal in the long hurdles was Henri Tauzin in 1900. The United States&#x27; five-Games gold medal (and podium) streak ended; for only the second time in the history of the event, Americans competed but won no medals (after 1968, with the United States also not on the podium in 1980 due to the boycott).

==Background==

This was the 23rd time the event was held. It had been introduced along with the men&#x27;s 200 metres hurdles in 1900, with the 200 being dropped after 1904 and the 400 being held through 1908 before being left off the 1912 programme. However, when the Olympics returned in 1920 after World War I, the men&#x27;s 400 metres hurdles was back and would continue to be contested at every Games thereafter.

The top four of the eight finalists from the 2000 Games returned: gold medalist Angelo Taylor of the United States, silver medalist Hadi Souan Somayli of Saudi Arabia, bronze medalist Llewellyn Herbert of South Africa, and fourth-place finisher James Carter of the United States. Félix Sánchez of the Dominican Republic had finished 20th in 2000, but had risen to prominence since as he won the 2001 and 2003 World Championships. He was the favorite in Athens. Defending champion Taylor made it to the semifinals but did not qualify for the final.

Belize, Kazakhstan, Mali, and Niger each made their debut in the event. The United States made its 22nd appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the boycotted 1980 Games.

==Summary==

In the final, a false start had been accredited to at least three athletes including Dominican Republic&#x27;s Félix Sánchez, a solid pre-race favorite in this event. Nonetheless, he sped out of the blocks, and quickly opened his lead over the American and fastest pre-Olympic entrant James Carter on the sixth hurdle. The two had chased against each other towards the final bend with Carter pulling ahead into the lead. As Carter went backwards in the last two hurdles, Sanchez left the field trailing to quickly move again to the front and maintained it to a blazing finish in his seasonal best at 47.63 seconds, extending his winning streak on his forty-third race since the previous defeat in 2001. Behind him, Jamaican hurdler Danny McFarlane and delighted Frenchman Naman Keïta edged Carter out to a ragged fourth to deny the American supremacy on the podium for the first time at a non-boycotted Games since 1968, giving both of them the silver and bronze respectively.

==Qualification==
The qualification period for athletics was 1 January 2003 to 9 August 2004. For the men&#x27;s 400 metres hurdles, each National Olympic Committee was permitted to enter up to three athletes that had run the race in 49.20 seconds or faster during the qualification period. The maximum number of athletes per nation had been set at 3 since the 1930 Olympic Congress. If an NOC had no athletes that qualified under that standard, one athlete that had run the race in 49.50 seconds or faster could be entered.

==Competition format==

The competition used the three-round format used every Games since 1908 (except the four-round competition in 1952): quarterfinals, semifinals, and a final. The hurdles were 3 feet (91.5 centimetres) tall and were placed 35 metres apart beginning 45 metres from the starting line, resulting in a 40 metres home stretch after the last hurdle. The 400 metres track was standard.

There were 5 quarterfinal heats with 7 athletes each. The top 4 men in each quarterfinal advanced to the semifinals along with the next fastest 4 overall. The 24 semifinalists were divided into 3 semifinals of 8 athletes each, with the top 2 in each semifinal and the next 2 fastest overall advancing to the 8-man final.

<text>John Havelock Parker, OC (February 2, 1929 – March 9, 2020) was the commissioner of the Northwest Territories from April 15, 1979 to July 31, 1989. He had previously been Deputy Commissioner of Northwest Territories from 1967 to 1979.

==Biography==
From 1959 until 1963 he became an alderman for the Yellowknife town council. In 1963, he became the mayor of Yellowknife, which he held until February 1967. While serving as mayor he was appointed to the Carrothers Commission which led to the formation of responsible government in the Northwest Territories and later the division that led to Nunavut.

His later work helped in defining the border between the NWT and Nunavut and his name was given to a protrusion known as Parker&#x27;s Notch as well as Parker Line.

In 1986, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada for his &quot;significant contributions to the evolution and development both of the municipal government of Yellowknife and of the territorial government.&quot;

Parker died March 9, 2020, in Sidney, British Columbia, where he had been living.

<text>The women&#x27;s 400 metres hurdles at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] as part of the athletics program were held at the Athens Olympic Stadium from August 21 to 25.

The first round had split a full roster of runners into five heats with the first two gaining a direct qualification and then the next six fastest across all heats advancing to the semifinals. The top four runners in both of the semifinal heats moved on directly to the final.

The final was expected to witness four early-season favorites, U.S. top runner Sheena Johnson, 2003 world champion Jana Pittman, current world record holder Yuliya Pechenkina, and two-time European champion Ionela Târlea-Manolache, challenging each other for the Olympic title. Inside the stadium, however, the raucous Greek crowd turned their attention on home favorite Faní Halkiá, who had previously lowered the Olympic record by 0.05 of a second in the second semifinal. All three medalists came from that semi, fifth place equalling 3rd place in the first semi.

From the start in lane four, Halkia drew level with Pittman outside her at the halfway turn, until she quickly pulled away from the field on the last hundred metres and cleared the final hurdle. With none of the pre-race favorites willing to chase her on the home stretch, Halkia raced comfortably to an Olympic gold. Behind her, Târlea-Manolache and Ukraine&#x27;s Tetyana Tereshchuk-Antipova came through on the inside to take the silver and bronze medals respectively. Running bravely against a tore knee injury, Pittman managed to finish the race in fifth place, while Pechenkina stumbled behind on a wretched run to round out the field in last.

Halkia&#x27;s triumph proved to be a redemption for the host nation Greece in track and field, after the anti-doping scandal and suspicious affair on 2000 Olympic medalists and sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Ekaterini Thanou that tainted the start of the Games.

==Qualification==
The qualification period for Athletics was 1 January 2003 to 9 August 2004. For the women&#x27;s 400 metres hurdles, each National Olympic Committee was permitted to enter up to three athletes that had run the race in 55.60 seconds or faster during the qualification period. If an NOC had no athletes that qualified under that standard, one athlete that had run the race in 56.25 seconds or faster could be entered.

<text>The men&#x27;s 800 metres at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] as part of the athletics program was held at the Athens Olympic Stadium from August 25 to 28. Seventy-two athletes from 58 nations competed. The event was won by 0.16 seconds by Yuriy Borzakovskiy of Russia, the first medal for the nation in the event. Wilson Kipketer of Denmark became the 10th man to win a second medal in the 800 metres.
==Summary==

The first round had split a full roster of runners into nine heats with the first two gaining a direct qualification and then the next six fastest across all heats advancing to the semifinals. The top two runners in each of the three semifinal heats moved on directly to the final, and they were immediately joined by the next two fastest from any of the semifinals.

The final was tactical, like the previous several Olympics with most athletes running faster to qualify than they ran in the final. Yuriy Borzakovskiy and Mouhssin Chehibi lagged significantly off the pace. World champion Djabir Saïd-Guerni and 2004 world leader Wilfred Bungei battled for the lead, chased closely by Bungei&#x27;s second cousin, world record holder Wilson Kipketer, Borzakovskiy and Chehibi joined the back of the pack. It seemed like Borzakovskiy was reluctant to catch the leaders, then realized the pace was not too fast, with 50 metres before the end of the first lap, he noticeably accelerated from dead last to join the fight. Mbulaeni Mulaudzi, who had lucked into the slowest qualifying time in the semi-final round, ran comfortably in a box inside of Kipketer through 500 meters. A lead group broke away on the backstretch. Guerni fell back as the cousins battled for the lead through the final turn, with Mulaudzi a step back and Borzakovskiy the final athlete in the breakaway. Coming off the turn, Kipketer pounced and took off for the finish in lane two. But the always fast closing Borzakovskiy came along the outside from 5 meters back to catch Kipketer 30 meters out. Not giving up the fight, Mulaudzi pulled even with Kipketer. Borzakovskiy held his hands up with a meter victory, while Mulaudzi out leaned Kipketer for silver.

==Background==

This was the 25th appearance of the event, which is one of 12 athletics events to have been held at every Summer Olympics. All of the finalists from 2000 returned except for the champion: silver medalist Wilson Kipketer of Denmark, bronze medalist Djabir Saïd-Guerni of Algeria, fourth-place finisher (and 1996 silver medalist) Hezekiél Sepeng of South Africa, fifth-place finisher André Bucher of Switzerland, sixth-place finisher Yuriy Borzakovskiy of Russia, seventh-place finisher Glody Dube of Botswana, and Andrea Longo of Italy, who had been disqualified in the final due to obstruction. The three latest world champions were Saïd-Guerni (2003), Bucher (2001), and Kipketer (1999, 1997, and 1995); Kipketer still held the world record. Borzakovskiy (2003 world runner-up) and Wilfred Bungei of Kenya (who held the #1 ranking) were also serious contenders for gold.

Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Palestine, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam appeared in the event for the first time. Great Britain made its 24th appearance, most among all nations, having had no competitors in the event only in the 1904 Games in St. Louis.

==Qualification==

The qualification period for athletics was 1 January 2003 to 9 August 2004. For the men&#x27;s 800 metres, each National Olympic Committee was permitted to enter up to three athletes that had run the race in 1:46.00 or faster during the qualification period. If an NOC had no athletes that qualified under that standard, one athlete that had run the race in 1:47.00 or faster could be entered. The maximum number of athletes per nation had been set at 3 since the 1930 Olympic Congress.

==Competition format==

The men&#x27;s 800 metres had a much larger field (79 entered and 72 started, compared with 61 starters in 2000) but again used a three-round format, the most common format since 1912 though there had been variations. The &quot;fastest loser&quot; system introduced in 1964 was used for the first two rounds. There were nine first-round heats, each with 8 athletes; the top two runners in each heat as well as the next six fastest overall advanced to the semifinals. There were three semifinals with 8 athletes each (except that one had an extra runner due to an advancement by obstruction rule in the first round); the top two runners in each semifinal and the next two fastest overall advanced to the eight-man final.

==Records==

Prior to the competition, the existing World record, Olympic record, and world leading time were as follows:

No new world or Olympic records were set during the competition. The following national records were established during the competition:

<text>The women&#x27;s 800 metres at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] as part of the athletics program were held at the Athens Olympic Stadium from August 20 to 23.

The first round had split a full roster of runners into six heats with the first three gaining a direct qualification and then the next six fastest across all heats advancing to the semifinals. The top two runners in each of the three semifinal heats moved on directly to the final, and they were immediately joined by the next two fastest from any of the semifinals.

The final started with a fast first 200 metres, but Kelly Holmes and Maria de Lurdes Mutola were last at this stage. As the pace slowed, Mutola and Holmes moved forward through the field. The time at 400 metres was 56.37 seconds, with American Jearl Miles Clark leading. They entered the finishing straight with Mutola taking the lead, before Holmes took the lead and held off Mutola to take gold. Hasna Benhassi and Jolanda Čeplak finished strongly, both with a time of 1:56.43s, Benhassi winning silver in a photo finish. Mutola was forced into fourth place. Holmes&#x27; face lit up as she crossed the line, but then, unsure of the result, she anxiously waited for the times to come up.

Holmes had only decided to enter the 800 metres at the last moment, and went on to also win gold in her preferred event, the 1500 m. This feat made her one of the UK&#x27;s most successful ever athletes ; the Olympic 800–1500 metres double was never accomplished by any of their great 1980s middle distance trio, Sebastian Coe, Steve Ovett or Steve Cram.

<text>The men&#x27;s 1500 metres at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] as part of the athletics program were held at the Athens Olympic Stadium from August 20 to 24. Thirty-eight athletes from 26 nations competed. The event was won by Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco, the nation&#x27;s first title in the event after coming second twice (1992 and 2000); El Guerrouj was the fifth man to win a second medal in the event. Bernard Lagat&#x27;s silver put Kenya on the podium in the event for the third straight year; the United States (six times from 1896 to 1920) and Great Britain (four times from 1908 to 1924 and three times from 1980 to 1988) were the only other nations to have accomplished that. It also made Lagat the sixth man to win two medals in the event, just behind El Guerrouj in both 2000 and 2004. Rui Silva&#x27;s bronze was Portugal&#x27;s first medal in the event.
==Summary==

World record holder Hicham El Guerrouj came into the race with a target on his back. Though El Guerrouj had won four straight World Championships, he had failed to win the previous Olympics, falling with a lap to go in his breakthrough year of 1996 and being beaten to the line in 2000 by the same Noah Ngeny who had chased El Guerrouj to the mile world record a year earlier. Ngeny was not back but bronze medalist Bernard Lagat was, seeking to finally beat El Guerrouj. Lagat had the potential assistance of two Kenyan teammates, but El Guerrouj also had his teammate Adil Kaouch make the final and Kaouch had previously sacrificed himself by acting as a pacesetter leading El Guerrouj to the 1999 and 2001 world titles. Because of the assistance, El Guerrouj&#x27;s ability in a strategic race was suspect.

Off the line, the three Kenyan runners took the lead and formed a wall keeping the field behind as they slowed the pace; El Guerrouj could not run away from the start and the race would be strategic. With 500 metres to go, El Guerrouj worked his way to the front, with a line of kickers including Lagat, Reyes Estevez, Ivan Heshko and the unknown Mulugeta Wendimu lined up behind him. Down the backstretch, Lagat stayed a step behind El Guerrouj as other speedsters jockeyed for position and then fell back. From deep in the pack (dead last with less than 500 metres to go), Rui Silva was on the outside passing the others. Around the final turn, Lagat edged his way closer to El Guerrouj, pulling even just at the head of the stretch, with Silva gaining to just a step behind. By halfway down the home stretch, Lagat edged into the lead, but El Guerrouj did not go away, fighting back to take the win as Lagat gave up the fight a couple of steps before the line. After clearly running the fastest last lap, Silva was unable to make any further headway, celebrating his bronze medal as he finished.

Four days later, El Guerrouj outsprinted 10000 metres gold medalist Kenenisa Bekele to take the 5000 metres gold medal and never competed internationally again, officially retiring in 2006.
==Background==

This was the 25th appearance of the event, which is one of 12 athletics events to have been held at every Summer Olympics. Half of the finalists from 2000, including four of the top five but not the defending champion, returned: silver medalist Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco, bronze medalist Bernard Lagat of Kenya, fourth-place finisher Mehdi Baala of France, fifth-place finisher Kevin Sullivan of Canada, eighth-place finisher Juan Carlos Higuero of Spain, and twelfth-place finisher Youssef Baba of Morocco. El Guerrouj (who had stretched his world championship streak to four and still held the world record) and Lagat were the strongest contenders; Lagat and Baala had finished second to El Guerrouj at the last two world championships.

Bahrain, Brunei, the Czech Republic, and Guam each made their first appearance in the event. The United States made its 24th appearance, most of all nations (having missed only the boycotted 1980 Games).

==Qualification==

The qualification period for athletics was 1 January 2003 to 9 August 2004. For the men&#x27;s 1500 metres, each National Olympic Committee was permitted to enter up to three athletes that had run the race in 3:36.20 or faster during the qualification period. The maximum number of athletes per nation had been set at 3 since the 1930 Olympic Congress. If an NOC had no athletes that qualified under that standard, one athlete that had run the race in 3:38.00 or faster could be entered.

==Competition format==

The competition was again three rounds (used previously in 1952 and since 1964). The &quot;fastest loser&quot; system introduced in 1964 was used for both the first round and semifinals. The 12-man semifinals and finals introduced in 1984 and used since 1992 were retained.

As in 2000, there were three heats in the first round, each with 13 or 14 runners (before withdrawals). There was a slight move towards &quot;fastest losers&quot; advancing, with only the top five runners in each heat, along with the next nine fastest overall, advancing to the semifinals. The 24 semifinalists were divided into two semifinals, each with 12 runners. The top five men in each semifinal, plus the next two fastest overall, advanced to the 12-man final.

==Records==
, the existing World record, Olympic record, and world leading time were as follows.

No new world or Olympic records were set during the competition. The following national records were established during the competition:

<text>The women&#x27;s 1500 metres at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] as part of the athletics program were held at the Athens Olympic Stadium from August 24 to 28.

The first round comprised three heats with the first five gaining a direct qualification and then the next nine fastest across all heats progressing to the semifinals. The top five runners in each of the two semifinal heats moved on directly to the final, and they were immediately joined by the next two fastest from any of the semifinals.

The final started out quickly with the fastest qualifier Natalya Yevdokimova taking an insurmountable lead for the Russians alongside her teammates Olga Yegorova and reigning world champion Tatyana Tomashova. Great Britain&#x27;s Kelly Holmes, who had earlier won the gold medal in the 800 metres, was expected to challenge her Russian rivals and the rest of the field for a possible Olympic double. Throughout the race, Holmes stayed calmly at the back of the field, lying eighth at the bell. With only one more lap to go, she bided her time to pull away from the rest of the runners through the curve, keeping an eye on the leaders. Holmes made a wider move with only 100 metres remaining to pass the leader Tomashova and sprinted down the home stretch to take the gold medal, setting a new British record of 3:57.90. Tomashova closed the race quickly to get the silver, while Romania&#x27;s Maria Cioncan could not reach further to chase the leaders on a tight sprint finish, ending her up with a bronze.

Holmes&#x27; feat made her one of Great Britain&#x27;s most successful athletes in Olympic history, and the first to achieve an Olympic middle-distance double by either a male or a female, for 84 years, a feat that not accomplished by the 1980s running legends Sebastian Coe, Steve Ovett, and Steve Cram.

<text>Robert John Service (born 29 October 1947) is a post-revisionist British historian, academic, and author who has written extensively on the history of the Soviet Union, particularly the era from the October Revolution to Stalin&#x27;s death. He was until 2013 a professor of Russian history at the University of Oxford, a Fellow of St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford, and a senior Fellow at Stanford University&#x27;s Hoover Institution. He is best known for his biographies of Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, and Leon Trotsky. He has been a fellow of the British Academy since 1998.

==Career and reception==
Service spent his undergraduate years at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he studied Russian and classical Greek. He went to Essex and Leningrad universities for his postgraduate work, and taught at Keele and the School of Slavonic and East European Studies, before joining Oxford University in 1998.

Between 1986 and 1995, Service published a three-volume biography of Vladimir Lenin. He wrote several works of general history on 20th-century Russia, including &quot;A History of Twentieth-Century Russia&quot;. He published a trilogy of biographies on the three most important Bolshevik leaders: &quot;Lenin&quot; (2000), &quot;Stalin&quot; (2004), and &quot;Trotsky&quot; (2009).

His biography of Trotsky was strongly criticised by Service&#x27;s Hoover Institution colleague Bertrand Mark Patenaude in a review for the &quot;American Historical Review&quot;. Patenaude, reviewing Service&#x27;s book alongside a rebuttal by the Trotskyist David North (&quot;In Defence of Leon Trotsky&quot;), charged Service with making dozens of factual errors, misrepresenting evidence, and &quot;fail[ing] to examine in a serious way Trotsky&#x27;s political ideas&quot;. Service responded that the book&#x27;s factual errors were minor and that Patenaude&#x27;s own book on Trotsky presented him as a &quot;noble martyr&quot;. The book was criticised by the German historian of communism Hermann Weber, who led a campaign to prevent Suhrkamp Verlag from publishing it in Germany. Fourteen historians and sociologists signed a letter to the publishing house. The letter cited &quot;a host of factual errors&quot;, the &quot;repugnant connotations&quot; of the passages in which Service deals with Trotsky&#x27;s Jewish origins, implicitly accusing him of anti-Semitism, and Service&#x27;s recourse to &quot;formulas associated with Stalinist propaganda&quot; for the purpose of discrediting Trotsky. Suhrkamp announced in February 2012 that it would publish a German translation of Robert Service&#x27;s &quot;Trotsky&quot; in July 2012. The book won the Duff Cooper Prize in the publication year 2009.

<text>The men&#x27;s 3000 metres steeplechase at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] as part of the athletics program were held at the Athens Olympic Stadium from August 21 to 24. The athletes competed in a three-heat qualifying round in which the top three from each heat, together with the six fastest losing runners, were given a place in the final race. The winning margin was 0.30 seconds.

The Kenyan dominance in this event had become well notable. In the final, the Kenyan trio of Brimin Kipruto, Paul Kipsiele Koech, and 2003 World silver medalist Ezekiel Kemboi had established themselves into the lead, supporting each other throughout the race, and running the pace with their own strategy and tactics that could not be matched by any other athlete. On the other hand, Qatar&#x27;s (Kenyan born) Musa Amer Obaid trailed the Kenyans to keep in contact and follow their every move. At the bell, the Kenyans were able to stay at the front. Spaniard Luis Miguel Martín joined them and tried to launch his sprint to chase the leaders, but he quickly fell behind as the race began to accelerate. Koech took the lead for the Kenyans and opened up a gap through the water jump, before Kemboi moved decisively to pass him and came down the home straight smoothly to victory. Kemboi turned to wave on his teammates Kipruto and Koech, as they cleared the final barrier and sprinted away jubilantly to give the Kenyans a sweep of the medal podium for the first time since the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.

<text>The men&#x27;s 5,000 metres at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] as part of the athletics program were held at the Athens Olympic Stadium on August 25 and 28. The winning margin was 0.20 seconds.

The final witnessed an epic clash between two track greats from different generations: in his final competitive international race, 1500m champion and track legend Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco and 10,000m Olympic champion, world record holder at the distance and rising star 21-year-old Kenenisa Bekele of Ethiopia. The race had a preview at the World Championships a year earlier. There the medalists were barely separated, but the young World Junior record holder Eliud Kipchoge upset the stars by taking gold after El Guerrouj had tried to break away on the final lap.

Here Bekele took an early lead, but instead chose not to push the pace. That duty fell onto Kipchoge, who had watched from behind the year before. Here, El Guerrouj spent most of the race watching from several places behind the lead. As the last lap began, El Guerrouj moved toward the front. Bekele challenged Kipchoge with 200 metres to go. It was a shoulder to shoulder all out sprint battle as Kipchoge refused to let Bekele by, but he couldn&#x27;t hold him off. Bekele broke out at a lead of several metres. El Guerrouj first ran down Kipchoge, then overhauled the Ethiopian in the final strides to win by just two tenths of a second. With this, El Guerrouj set a historic milestone as the first ever athlete to strike a distance double (1500–5000) since Paavo Nurmi did so in 1924, denying Bekele a chance to do the Olympic 5000m and 10,000m double – which he would ultimately win four years later in Beijing.

<text>The women&#x27;s 5000 metres at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] as part of the athletics program were held at the Athens Olympic Stadium on August 20 and 23.

The final started out slowly and dismally, as none of the entrants wanted to take the lead. With the tightly packed field passing through the 400 metres, many runners started to fall behind and could not handle the pace set by early leaders Sun Yingjie and Xing Huina. Approaching to the halfway mark of the race, Turkey&#x27;s world-record holder Elvan Abeylegesse surpassed the Chinese duo to charge into the lead and the pace began to accelerate quickly. Ethiopia&#x27;s Meseret Defar and Kenya&#x27;s Isabella Ochichi came immediately to the front of the pack, keeping an eye on the leader. With only three laps to go, Abeylegesse struggled to maintain her pace until she finally faded on the backstretch, leaving Defar and Ochichi to exchange the leading duties throughout the race and battle out for the gold. Moments after the bell, Ochichi continued to lead from the rest of the field, but Defar patiently passed her with only 200 metres to go, and then stormed away to her first Olympic title, finishing at 14:45.65. Ochichi had nothing left to respond with, but came through behind her to get the silver, while Defar&#x27;s teammate Tirunesh Dibaba overhauled the weary Abeylegesse to hold on for the bronze.

The Ethiopians were in control throughout the distance. A leading group of five runners crystallized. As Kenenisa Bekele and Sileshi Sihine turned up the pace with two kilometres left, Zersenay Tadese, Boniface Kiprop Toroitich and reigning Olympic champion Haile Gebrselassie, who was running with a calf injury, were not able to keep up. Bekele, the world record holder, assured his victory with a brilliant Olympic record finish (27:05.10 minutes), completing the final 400 metres in less than 54 seconds.

Like Fernanda Ribeiro at the 2000 Summer Olympics, defending champion Derartu Tulu was not able to maintain her title, finishing in the third place behind compatriot (and cousin) Ejegayehu Dibaba and the winner Xing Huina. In Athens, Ribeiro did not finish the race due to fatigue, along with British marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe. Throughout the race, Xing marked the Ethiopian favorites, not taking the lead until the home stretch with a final kick Dibabba could not match. Xing&#x27;s final lap was just under 63 seconds.

The Great Britain quartet of Jason Gardener, Darren Campbell, Mark Lewis-Francis, and Marlon Devonish produced superior exchanges to beat the United States team by 0.01 seconds in a time of 38.07 seconds. The final also saw the U.S. team struggling with their relay duties, when Justin Gatlin and Coby Miller botched their baton handoff after the second leg, leaving the British team to command their lead towards the final bend. By the time Greene received the baton from Miller on the anchor leg, he burst down the home stretch to chase Lewis-Francis at the finish line, but could not get ahead despite his lower leg and head having crossed the line first, as the Americans fell short by just a hundredth of a second.

The sixteen teams competed in a two-heat qualifying round in which the first three teams from each heat, together with the next two fastest teams, were given a place in the final race.

The final started off quickly with an early lead from Jamaica, before the U.S. team, led by Angela Williams, made a tactical move to pass their Jamaican rivals towards the exchange zone. Marion Jones ran the second leg confidently to put the Americans a more decent lead, until she finally approached the 100 metres silver medalist Lauryn Williams to do the handoff. By the time Williams was about to move off her mark on the third leg, Jones lunged out of breath with baton and desperately tried to catch her at the exchange zone that never happened, costing the Americans&#x27; chances for the Olympic medal. As the race continued without the U.S. team, the Jamaicans, anchored by 200 metres champion Veronica Campbell, scorched their way down the home stretch to an effortless victory in 41.73 seconds. They were soon followed by Russia taking the silver, and the French quartet rounding out the medal podium with the bronze.

<text>The men&#x27;s 4 × 400 metres relay at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] as part of the athletics program was held at the Athens Olympic Stadium from August 27 to 28. The sixteen teams competed in a two-heat qualifying round in which the first three teams from each heat, together with the next two fastest teams, were given a place in the final race.

The American dominance in this relay event had become increasingly clear, having swept the medals in the 400 metres five days earlier. From an explosive start in the final, Otis Harris led off for the U.S. team and gave them a relentless lead over the rest of the field throughout the race. With no other team aiming to chase the Americans on the home stretch, the foursome of Harris, Derrick Brew, Olympic 400 metres champion Jeremy Wariner, and Darold Williamson stormed away to an effortless triumph in a time of 2:55.91, 4.69 seconds ahead of the silver-winning Aussie squad. As of 2023, this is the greatest winning margin in this relay at the Olympics. Meanwhile, the Nigerians stayed much closer with Japan and Great Britain on the final bend, until they outlasted the rivals in a desperately tight finish for the bronze.

The victory also helped the Americans compensate for the surprising runner-up finish of their team in the earlier sprint relay.

<text>The women&#x27;s 4 × 400 metres relay at the 2004 Summer Olympics as part of the athletics program was held at the Athens Olympic Stadium from August 27 to 28. The sixteen teams competed in a two-heat qualifying round in which the first three teams from each heat, together with the next two fastest teams, were given a place in the final race.

Russian Olesya Krasnomovets was out hard down the backstretch, passing Britain&#x27;s Donna Fraser on her outside and opening up a lead over American DeeDee Trotter chasing to the inside. But Trotter did not let Krasnomovets go, gaining steadily through the second turn and speeding down the final straightaway to draw even by the handoff to Monique Henderson, giving the U.S. the lead. Novlene Williams put Jamaica in strong contention a couple of metres behind the Russians. Through her leg, Henderson expanded the American gap to six metres. Natalya Nazarova also opened up a little more space on Jamaica.

During the second handoff while in sixth place, Greece&#x27;s Dimitra Dova was given an inadvertent flat tire by teammate Hrisoula Goudenoudi. Dova tried to fix her shoe, then stepped into the infield in frustration before returning to the track. Greece would eventually finish 17 seconds behind the next to last finisher.

Through the third leg, Sanya Richards held a steady three metre lead over Olesya Zykina, while Nadia Davy slightly gained on Zykina from behind. Coming onto the final straight, Richards exploded, pulling away as Davy pulled to the outside to put her move on Zykina. They ran even for half the straightaway before Zykina was able to regain command. Monique Hennagan left with a clear lead for America, the Russians exchanged cleanly with Natalya Antyukh in hot pursuit. But as the Jamaicans exchanged, Sandie Richards ran into the back of Zykina. As Richards stopped and sidestepped, she lost several metres and the chance at silver. Hennigan opened up to about 12 meters halfway through the lap, slowing the second half to cross the finish line with just less than a ten-meter advantage in the gold-medal time of 3:19.01.

In 2010, Crystal Cox, who only ran for the U.S. team in the prelims, admitted to using anabolic steroids from 2001 to 2004. As a result, she forfeited all of her results from that time period, and agreed to a four-year suspension, until January 2014. In 2013, both the IAAF and the IOC announced that the result would stand and the American squad (except Cox) would be allowed to retain their gold medals because, according to the rules of the time, a team should not be disqualified because of a doping offense of an athlete who didn&#x27;t compete in the finals. Russia&#x27;s Tatyana Firova from the preliminary round in 2004, became one of two Russian athletes to cause disqualification in 2008. Russia has not been disqualified in 2004 but was disqualified in 2012 for numerous doping violations. And the entire Russian athletics team was banned from the 2016 games for its state-sponsored doping.

<doc id="913304" wikidata="Q2443986" url="?curid=913304" title="Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Men's marathon">
<text>The Men&#x27;s marathon at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] took place on August 29 in the streets of Athens, Greece where one hundred and one athletes from 59 nations competed. The event was won by Stefano Baldini of Italy, the nation&#x27;s first victory in the event since 1988 and second overall. The United States reached the podium in the event for the first time since 1976 with Meb Keflezighi&#x27;s silver. Vanderlei de Lima took bronze, Brazil&#x27;s first-ever medal in the men&#x27;s marathon.

As with the previous Games, the marathon also marked the end of the 2004 Summer Olympics and the medal ceremony took place during the closing ceremony at the Olympic Stadium.

The event was mired in controversy after the organisers rejected an appeal for Vanderlei de Lima to be awarded gold. He was leading the race when he was tackled by a spectator, relegating him to third.

==Summary==

The 42-km (26-mile) journey began in the actual town of Marathon. The top contenders all found themselves in a large leading group that held a modest pace through the half marathon. A few tried to surge ahead but the most successful was Vanderlei de Lima&#x27;s attack at 20k. Past 25k, Stefano Baldini raised the tempo taking seven others with him. Finally, the chase group had been whittled down to three: Stefano Baldini, Paul Tergat, and Mebrahtom Keflezighi. After 35k was passed, Tergat (the world record holder) cracked, leaving two runners to chase behind. Baldini then closed the gap to De Lima after the latter was attacked by a spectator while dropping Keflezighi. Baldini moved into the lead and took it home for the gold medal in 2:10:55. Keflezighi caught the fading De Lima as well to take the silver in 2:11:29. Finishing at 2:12:11, De Lima was able to hold off Jon Brown, beating him by 15 seconds for the bronze.

==Incident==

The event was marked by an incident in which Neil Horan, an Irish priest, grappled Vanderlei de Lima of Brazil while de Lima was leading the event with around 7 kilometers remaining and dragged him to the crowd. Greek spectator Polyvios Kossivas helped de Lima free from Horan&#x27;s grasp and back into his running. De Lima lost about 10 seconds of time because of the interruption, and finished third in the event with a time of 2:12:11, winning the bronze medal. De Lima received the rarely awarded Pierre de Coubertin Medal for sportsmanship in addition to his bronze.

Despite the fact that the incident had seriously hindered his chances of winning the gold or silver medal, he did not complain and graciously acknowledged the crowd&#x27;s cheers in the home straight. The protester had a sign on his back that read &quot;The Grand Prix Priest. Israel Fulfilment of Prophecy Says The Bible. The Second Coming is Near.&quot;

The phrase &quot;Grand Prix Priest&quot; refers to Horan&#x27;s previous protest, in which he ran onto the track at the Silverstone Circuit during the 2003 British Grand Prix, intentionally running directly into the path of oncoming cars.

==Background==

This was the 25th appearance of the event, which is one of 12 athletics events to have been held at every Summer Olympics. Returning runners from the 2000 marathon included silver medalist Erick Wainaina of Kenya and fourth-place finisher Jon Brown of Great Britain. The reigning world champion was Jaouad Gharib of Morocco. There was &quot;no definite favorite&quot; in the field. 

Belarus, the Czech Republic, and Saint Lucia each made their first appearance in Olympic men&#x27;s marathons; East Timor made its first formal appearance, though it had had one Independent Olympic Athlete from East Timor in 2000. The United States made its 24th appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the boycotted 1980 Games.

==Qualification==

The qualification period for athletics was 1 January 2003 to 9 August 2004. For the men&#x27;s marathon, each National Olympic Committee was permitted to enter up to three athletes that had run the race in 2:15:00 or faster during the qualification period. The maximum number of athletes per nation had been set at 3 since the 1930 Olympic Congress. If an NOC had no athletes that qualified under that standard, one athlete that had run the race in 2:18:00 or faster could be entered.

==Competition format and course==

As all Olympic marathons, the competition was a single race. The marathon distance of 26 miles, 385 yards was run over a point-to-point route through the streets of Athens. These streets were recently painted for the event, which provided an excellent road surface for the athletes. Drawing upon the ancient origins of the race, the marathon began in Marathon, Greece, and eventually ended at Panathinaiko Stadium, the venue previously used for the 1896 Athens Olympics.

==Records==

, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.

No new records were set during the competition.

==Schedule==

The day was &quot;the hottest day ever for an Olympic marathon&quot;, just above .


==Results==

Eighty-one runners finished; 20 did not.

<doc id="913305" wikidata="Q3520977" url="?curid=913305" title="The French Chef">
<text>The French Chef is an American television cooking show created and hosted by Julia Child, produced and broadcast by WGBH, the public television station in Boston, Massachusetts, from February 11, 1963 to January 14, 1973. It was one of the first cooking shows on American television.

&quot;The French Chef&quot; was first shown with a pilot on July 26, 1962. After two more episodes were broadcast in the summer, the show premiered as a regular weekly series on February 11, 1963. The immensely popular show went on to air for 212 episodes. It is credited with convincing the American public to try cooking French food at home.

The show grew out of a special presentation Child gave on WGBH based on the book &quot;Mastering the Art of French Cooking&quot; which she co-authored. &quot;The French Chef&quot; was produced from 1963 to 1973 by WGBH for National Educational Television (and later for PBS). Reruns continued on PBS until 1989, and were airing on Cooking Channel as of 2010. As of September 2016, episodes were being rerun on the new Canadian cooking channel Gusto, and later, Makeful. As recently as March 2017, reruns of the show were also seen on the American Public Television Create channel.

The original episodes were available on the PBS streaming service as of 2020. In July 2021, certain episodes were added to the Pluto TV lineup, together with other Julia Child cooking programs.

==Format==
&quot;The French Chef&quot; introduced French cooking to the United States at a time when it was considered expensive restaurant fare, not suitable for home cooking. Child emphasized fresh and, at the time, unusual ingredients.

All of the recipes used on &quot;The French Chef&quot; had originally appeared in &quot;Mastering the Art of French Cooking,&quot; but for the show, Child chose mostly the more domestic recipes from the book, although such showpieces as Beef Wellington, various sorts of soufflé, and some ambitious pastries also made it into the mix if they seemed within the reach of a home cook without staff.

The show was done live-to-videotape from start to finish, leaving little room for mistakes. The resulting occasional accidents became a popular trademark of Child&#x27;s on air presence, used as &quot;teachable moments&quot; to encourage viewers to relax about the task&#x27;s demands.

Certain elements became &quot;motifs&quot;: Julia&#x27;s fondness for wine; her distinctive voice; her staunch defense of the use of butter (with margarine invariably referred to as &quot;that other spread&quot;) and cream; her standard issue &quot;impeccably clean towel&quot;; and her closing line at the end of every show: &quot;This is Julia Child, !&quot;

==History==

Child&#x27;s first appearance cooking on TV had been by happenstance: a guest for another show on WGBH had canceled their appearance, as did the backup guest. Child was invited to do a cooking demonstration, which received positive feedback and prompted executives to order a pilot.

When the show began, the budget was so low that &quot;volunteers had to be recruited to wash dishes, and the food sometimes had to be auctioned to the audience afterwards to cover expenses.&quot;

In 1964 Child received a Peabody Award, crediting her for doing &quot;more than show us how good cooking is achieved; by her delightful demonstrations she has brought the pleasures of good living into many American homes.&quot; In May 1966, her show won a Primetime Emmy Award for Achievements in Educational Television – Individuals.

The August 27, 1968 episode of &quot;The French Chef&quot; (rerun from an episode sometime in 1965) ended with the unexpected collapse of an Apple Charlotte.

The October 31, 1971 episode of &quot;The French Chef&quot; (on its ninth anniversary) was the first U.S. television show to be captioned for deaf viewers.

The show was produced by Ruth Lockwood and directed by Russell Morash, Russell Fortier, David Griffiths and David B. Atwood. Film composer John Morris wrote the second theme song for The French Chef.

The show eventually became so popular that Child&#x27;s use of a particular ingredient each week would sometimes cause a surge in demand and lead to grocery stores across the country temporarily selling out of it.

==Legacy==
Child and WGBH would collaborate again on the series &quot;Julia Child &amp; Company&quot; from 1978 to 1980, &quot;Dinner at Julia&#x27;s&quot; from 1983 to 1984, and a series of home videos in 1985 called &quot;The Way to Cook&quot;. Child would be paired with other food personalities for two additional PBS series in the 1990s, &quot;Cooking with Master Chefs: Hosted by Julia Child&quot; which ran for a single season from 1993 to 1994, and &quot;Baking with Julia&quot; for three seasons from 1996 to 1998. She also participated in the show &quot;Julia Child &amp; Jacques Pépin Cooking at Home&quot; which won a Daytime Emmy Award in 2001.

As part of its growing Twitch Creative content, Twitch streamed every episode of &quot;The French Chef&quot; over a four-day period starting on March 15, 2016, to launch its new food channel. Twitch reported that almost a million viewers watched the marathon.

&quot;Julia&quot;, a television series based on Child and the creation of &quot;The French Chef&quot;, premiered on HBO Max in 2022.

==List of episodes==
===Pilots (1962)===
The three pilot episodes were subsequently taped over by the studio, a common practice at the time, and no copies are known to exist today. The subjects of the pilot episodes were revisited early in the show&#x27;s run, with the French omelet and onion soup appearing in the first season and Coq au Vin in the second.

===Season 1 (1963)===
Child wrote that the first 13 episodes were lost at one point, but that the first 7 were found. However, PBS posted 23 episodes from the first season to YouTube in June 2022, with only French Onion Soup and Dinner In a Pot missing. Those two episodes were later posted in October 2022. The first few episodes were sponsored by S&amp;H Green Stamps; starting with Chicken Breasts and Rice, this season was sponsored by Safeway Stores.

===Season 2 (1963-1964)===
This season was sponsored by Safeway Stores.

===Season 3 (1964-1965)===
This season was sponsored by Polaroid Corporation; starting with Turban of Sole, Hills Bros. Coffee joined as co-sponsor.

===Season 4 (1965-1966)===
This season was sponsored by Polaroid Corporation and Hills Bros. Coffee.

===Season 5 (1966)===
This would be the last season to be presented by the Eastern Educational Television Network.

===Season 6 (1970-1971)===
The sixth season would be the first produced in color and would introduce a new theme tune for the opening titles. It was also the first to be presented by the Public Broadcasting Service. From this season on, Polaroid was the sole sponsor of the program.

===Season 7 (1971-1972)===
===Season 8 (1972-1973)===
==Companion books==
Two companion cookbooks were written along with the show. &quot;The French Chef Cookbook&quot; was a show-by-show breakdown of the black and white series, while &quot;From Julia Child&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; was a somewhat more ambitious work that was based on the color series but also added considerable extra material.

<text>The women&#x27;s marathon at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] took place on August 22 in the streets of Athens, Greece. These streets were recently painted for the event, which provided an excellent road surface for the athletes. Drawing upon the ancient origins of the race, the marathon began in Marathon, Greece, and eventually ended at Panathinaiko Stadium, the venue previously used for the 1896 Athens Olympics.

The 42.195 kilometre (26.2 mile) journey began in Marathon and the race over the classic course began with temperatures exceeding 35 °C (95 °F). The top contenders all found themselves in a large leading group that held a modest pace through the half marathon. A few tried to surge ahead, but a pack of five runners had been separated from the rest of the field to maintain at the front as they passed the 20k mark.

World record holder Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain, who started out as a pre-race favorite coming into the Games, raised the tempo taking four others, including the Japanese duo Mizuki Noguchi and Reiko Tosa, with her to the front. Past 25k, Radcliffe struggled to keep her pace on an uphill stretch of the course and fell behind, leaving the two runners Noguchi and Ethiopia&#x27;s Elfenesh Alemu to chase into the front with only half a minute apart from each other. At around 35k, Radcliffe launched a brave charge to recover her pace and challenge the leaders into the medal position, until Kenya&#x27;s Catherine Ndereba managed to overtake her. Distraught and sobbing, Radcliffe tried to restart with 6k left to the finish, but then slumped on the roadside and quit the race, citing pre-race nutrition problems and injuries for her disappointing performance.

Heading to the Panathinaiko Stadium, Noguchi continued to escalate her lead, and edged past the late-charging Ndereba by twelve seconds to win the Olympic gold medal in 2:26:20. Noguchi&#x27;s victory also marked the second consecutive gold for Japan in the women&#x27;s marathon with Naoko Takahashi claiming the event in Sydney four years earlier.

Meanwhile, Deena Kastor of the United States came from behind to easily surpass the fading Alemu, and earn the first Olympic medal by an American female in the event since 1984.

Among the 82 starters, only sixty-six were able to successfully finish the race, with two left the track seeking for a medical attention.

<text>The men&#x27;s 20 kilometres race walk at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] as part of the athletics program was held through the streets of Athens with the start and finish at the Athens Olympic Stadium on August 20.

The Chinese trio of Han Yucheng, Liu Yunfeng, and Zhu Hongjun took an early lead as the race walkers had left the stadium, but their challenge never materialized. Han could not keep up with the leaders through the first lap and soon fell off the pace, leaving Liu and Zhu with a burden to defend their chances. Approaching the second and third lap, Spain&#x27;s Paquillo Fernández soon joined the Chinese duo to toughen the pace and build a commanding lead over the rest of the field, followed by his teammate Juan Manuel Molina, Ivano Brugnetti, Nathan Deakes, African champion Hatem Ghoula, and overwhelming favorite Jefferson Pérez.

When Ghoula was given his first warning with a yellow card on possession at the 6k mark, the leading pack had been whittled down to eight. Halfway through the race and with only four laps to go, Fernandez, Brugnetti, and Deakes were the strongest chasers, forming a slightly tight group to decide on the medals. Perez, however, struggled to keep up the pace on the leaders by a ten-metre deficit with Zhu and 2000 Olympic silver medalist Noé Hernández following him.

Fifty minutes into the race, Brugnetti steadily turned to break away from the leading group with Fernandez and Deakes continuously chasing him to the front. While Hernandez was disqualified after the red paddle, Perez managed to bridge back to the leaders with only a few laps remaining, but eventually fell behind. This left with Brugnetti, Fernandez, and Deakes walking closely and swiftly towards the 18k mark, before the two Europeans zoomed past Deakes to gain a three-second lead going to the final lap. Brugnetti made a decisive move to put some distance ahead of Fernandez in the approach to the Olympic Stadium.

As Fernandez could not close the gap on the final stretch, a jubilant Brugnetti celebrated all the way to a superb finish, and savored his Olympic gold medal in 1:19:40, just five seconds ahead of the Spaniard. Behind the two European rivals, Deakes managed to hold on for the bronze with Perez placing to a disappointing fourth.

<text>The women&#x27;s 20 kilometres race walk at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] as part of the athletics program was held through the streets of Athens with the start and finish at the Athens Olympic Stadium on August 23.

The race had started with a strong, good-sized bunch of fifty-seven walkers keeping together through the field. As the group left the stadium falling apart, Russia&#x27;s Olimpiada Ivanova took the front of the pack on the opening 2k laps, followed by several of the anticipated favorites, which included 2000 Olympic champion Wang Liping, the Australian sisters Jane and Natalie Saville, and the Greek duo Athina Papayianni and Athanasia Tsoumeleka.

By the half way mark, fourteen walkers were still in close contention with Ivanova maintaining the lead and Belarus&#x27; Ryta Turava staying beside her to shorten the gap. As the Belarusian began to lose contact, Ivanova steadily broke away from the group to own the race, until Jane Saville set the pace much faster to chase her on the succeeding lap. With just 2k left to go, home favorite Tsoumeleka zoomed past the two remaining chasers Ivanova and Saville on a late charge to quickly build up a seemingly insurmountable lead.

Entering the Olympic Stadium with a rapturous welcome from the partisan crowd, Tsoumeleka walked jubilantly into the final stretch to deliver the Greeks their first ever Olympic track and field gold medal at these Games. She finished the race in 1:29.12, just four seconds ahead of the eventual silver medalist Ivanova. Meanwhile, Saville had finally erased her setback of being disqualified at the Sydney Olympics four years earlier to successfully claim the bronze, holding Turava off the podium to fourth.

<text>The men&#x27;s 50 kilometres race walk at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] as part of the athletics program was held through the streets of Athens with the start and finish at the Athens Olympic Stadium on August 27.

The race had started in the virtually empty Olympic Stadium with fifty-four walkers lining up the field. The Chinese trio of Han Yucheng, Yu Chaohong, and Alatan Gadasu hurtled away from the pack to take the front as they left the stadium. In the early laps, Han made a tactical move to continuously lead the Chinese walkers within five minutes, but he received his first of three warnings, fell off back to the pack, and was later disqualified after the red paddle. Ten minutes into the race, the Chinese duo were soon joined by four other walkers, Russia&#x27;s world record holder Denis Nizhegorodov and his teammate Aleksey Voyevodin, 20 km bronze medalist Nathan Deakes of Australia, and defending Olympic champion Robert Korzeniowski.

Between 10 and 30k, Nizhegorodov and Korzeniowski moved to the front of the pack and stayed abreast each other through most of the race. At the halfway point, the leading group had been whittled down to four. Korzeniowski was still in the lead with the Russian duo and Deakes attempting to overtake him. While Nizhegorodov and Voyevodin created a gap as they separated from the group to gain a thirty second advantage, it came down to a chase between Korzeniowski and Deakes to take the lead with only one hour to go. Deakes was eventually disqualified after his third warning with the red card, and Korzeniowski steadily broke away from the field to own the remaining third of the race.

At around 35k, Korzeniowski had commanded a 30 second lead over the weary Nizhegorodov and a further 22 seconds over Yu Chaohong. Walking tirelessly in fourth, Voyevodin managed to bridge back to the pack and launched a charge to strengthen his pace closely behind Yu.

Coming through the 45k mark and into the Olympic Stadium, Korzeniowski increased his lead by fifteen seconds ahead of the world record holder before storming his way at the final turn to cross the finish line for the last time in his competitive career. With a historic win, he added a fourth gold medal to his Olympic tally in 3:38:46.

Five minutes behind Korzeniowski, Nizhegorodov appeared unstable on the home stretch, but had accumulated much ground to finish strong with a silver medal, before collapsing to the track in exhaustion. Meanwhile, his fast-charging teammate Voyevodin surpassed the confident Yu just outside the stadium to claim the bronze with a tremendous finish, edging the Chinese off the podium by eleven seconds.

<text>The men&#x27;s [[high jump]] competition at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in Athens was held at the Olympic Stadium on 20–22 August. Thirty-eight athletes from 27 nations competed. The event was won by Stefan Holm of Sweden, the nation&#x27;s first victory in the men&#x27;s high jump and first medal in the event since Patrik Sjöberg won three in a row from 1984 to 1992. Matt Hemingway took silver, returning the United States to the podium after a one-Games absence. Jaroslav Bába&#x27;s bronze was the first medal in the event for the Czech Republic.

==Background==

This was the 25th appearance of the event, which is one of 12 athletics events to have been held at every Summer Olympics. The returning finalists from the 2000 Games were bronze medalist Abderrahmane Hammad of Algeria, fourth-place finisher Stefan Holm of Sweden, sixth-place finishers Mark Boswell of Canada and Staffan Strand of Sweden, and tenth-place finisher Vyacheslav Voronin of Russia. Dragutin Topić competed under for the fourth time, under his third flag (the Olympic flag as an Independent Olympic Participant in 1992, Yugoslavia in 1996 and 2000, and now Serbia and Montenegro). Holm was favored; he had placed second at the 2003 world championship (the winner, Jacques Freitag, was present in Athens but injured) and &quot;had won 17 consecutive meets leading up to Athina.&quot;

Cyprus, Serbia and Montenegro, Slovenia, and Sri Lanka each made their debut in the event. The United States made its 24th appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the boycotted 1980 Games.

==Qualification==

The qualification period for Athletics was 1 January 2003 to 9 August 2004. For the men&#x27;s high jump, each National Olympic Committee was permitted to enter up to three athletes that had jumped 2.30 metres or higher during the qualification period. The maximum number of athletes per nation had been set at 3 since the 1930 Olympic Congress. If an NOC had no athletes that qualified under that standard, one athlete that had jumped 2.27 metres or higher could be entered.

==Competition format==

The competition consisted of two rounds, qualification and final. Athletes start with a qualifying round. Jumping in turn, each athlete attempts to achieve the qualifying height. If they fail at three jumps in a row, they are eliminated. After a successful jump, they receive three more attempts to achieve the next height. Once all jumps have been completed, all athletes who have achieved the qualifying height go through to the final. If fewer than 12 athletes achieve the qualifying standard, the best 12 athletes go through. Cleared heights reset for the final, which followed the same format until all athletes fail three consecutive jumps.

==Records==

<text>The men&#x27;s [[pole vault]] competition at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in Athens was held at the Olympic Stadium on 25–27 August. Thirty-nine athletes from 25 nations competed. The event was won by Timothy Mack of the United States, the nation&#x27;s 18th victory in the men&#x27;s pole vault. Toby Stevenson took silver, making it the second consecutive Games that Americans finished 1st and 2nd. Giuseppe Gibilisco&#x27;s bronze was Italy&#x27;s first medal in the event.

==Summary==

With a first attempt clearance at 5.85m, Giuseppe Gibilisco went into 5.90m with the lead. Tim Mack and Toby Stevenson were the only others to clear 5.85m, both on their second attempt, but Stevenson had the advantage because Mack had an earlier miss. But the medals were not settled because Igor Pavlov saved one attempt for 5.90m. Stevenson and Mack both made it on their first attempt, while Pavlov missed to be eliminated and Gibilisco missed his first. With nothing to be gained, Gibilisco passed to . The only way to unseat Stevenson was a clearance, but nobody could negotiate 5.95 in their first two attempts, leaving Gibilisco with bronze. On his final attempt, Mack slithered over a personal best for the second time in the competition. It was also a new Olympic record. Stevenson put on his helmet to take one last attempt but the bar dragged off, giving Mack the gold.

==Background==

This was the 25th appearance of the event, which is one of 12 athletics events to have been held at every Summer Olympics. The returning finalists from the 2000 Games were fifth-place finisher (and 1996 finalist) Dmitriy Markov of Australia, seventh-place finisher Okkert Brits of South Africa, eighth-place finisher Danny Ecker of Germany, tenth-place finishers Giuseppe Gibilisco of Italy and Aleksandr Averbukh of Israel, and thirteenth-place finisher Tim Lobinger of Germany. Markov had won the 2001 world championship, with Gibilisco winning in 2003. For the first time in decades, Sergey Bubka was not favored—if only because he had retired in 2001.

Slovenia made its men&#x27;s pole vaulting debut; Uzbekistan entered a vaulter, but he did not start. The United States made its 24th appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the boycotted 1980 Games.

==Qualification==

The qualification period for Athletics was 1 January 2003 to 9 August 2004. For the men&#x27;s pole vault, each National Olympic Committee was permitted to enter up to three athletes that had vaulted 5.65 metres or higher during the qualification period. The maximum number of athletes per nation had been set at 3 since the 1930 Olympic Congress. If an NOC had no athletes that qualified under that standard, one athlete that had vaulted 5.55 metres or higher could be entered.

==Competition format==

The competition consisted of two rounds, qualification and final. Athletes start with a qualifying round. Jumping in turn, each athlete attempts to achieve the qualifying height. If they fail at three jumps in a row, they are eliminated. After a successful jump, they receive three more attempts to achieve the next height.

<text>Fathulla Jameel, (; 5 September 1942 – 1 March 2012) was a Maldivian diplomat and politician who served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Maldives from 1978 to 2005.

Jameel was the Permanent Representative of the Maldives to the United Nations from April 14, 1977 to 1978. He became Minister of Foreign Affairs on March 14, 1978 and, under President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, held that position for 27 years. On July 14, 2005, he resigned as Minister of Foreign Affairs and was instead appointed as a Special Advisor to the President. On April 30, 2008 he was sworn into the position of senior minister, a relatively new post created by the then incumbent president Gayoom.

==Early Career and Government Service==
Fathulla began his public service career on the 18th of November 1969, as a teacher at Majeediyya School. He became the Minister of External Affairs during the presidency of Ibrahim Nasir, on 14 March 1978.

When Maumoon Abdul Gayoom became President, Fathulla was reappointed as Minister of External Affairs towards the end of 1978. He remained at that position until his resignation in July 2005. After resignation, he served as Special Advisor to the President.

In an obituary, &quot;Haveeru Daily&quot; described him as the father of Maldives foreign diplomacy.

Fatuhulla also served as Minister of State for Planning and Environment at one time. He also was the President’s Member at the People’s Majlis for a long time.

===Education and life in Egypt===
Fathulla Jameel studied in Al-Azhar University of Egypt and obtained a BA in Islamic Theology. He later attended a postgraduate teacher training course at Ain Shams University.

He was interviewed by Egyptian writer journalist Anis Mansour, after the editor of than famous &quot;Al Hilal&quot; magazine editor scholar Dr. Hussain Mu&#x27;nis suggested that Mr. Mansour interview Maldivian students, for his book حول العالم في 200 يوم (my journey around the world in 200 days). According to Mr. Mansour, Fathulla said that his dream was to become a teacher in a school upon his return, the highest and most prestigious job available than in the Maldives. In Egypt he stayed with his friends, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom and Zahir Hussain, at a Maldivian government leased flat, in the Al-Hilmiyyaa area of Cairo.

Fathulla was the second generation to study in Egypt. Before him his father, Mr. Muhammad Jameel Didi studied in Egypt during King Fuad and Farooq&#x27;s reign.

He obtained his primary, secondary and tertiary education in Egypt at Mauhadhul Qahira in Dharraasa ward.

Peers described him as an intelligent person and his many skills include drawing, singing and playing guitar and was known to crack jokes that go along with the occasion.

Fathulla was an avid supporter of Egyptian Zamalek SC Football Club and he named his residence after the Club Zamalek.

==Death==
Fathulla Jameel died on Thursday, March 1, 2012 at MVT 8:15 (UTC) at Singapore General Hospital from heart disease. He was 69. Maldives President Mohamed Waheed Hassan Manik sent his condolences for the family and declared the national flag to be flown at half mast for three days.

<text>The women&#x27;s [[triple jump]] competition at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in Athens was held at the Olympic Stadium on 21–23 August.

Coming into the competition, reigning world champion Tatyana Lebedeva was a favorite, having jumped 15.34m and 15.33m. earlier in July, slightly improving her position as the number two jumper in history which she had held since 2000. World record holder Inessa Kravets from nine years earlier, was no longer a factor, but Yamilé Aldama was also jumping well with a 15.28 just three weeks before the Olympics.

In the qualifying round, Hrysopiyi Devetzi shocked everyone with her 15.32m automatic qualifier on her only attempt. That was a Beamonesque improvement of her personal best and placed her as the number three jumper in history at that point in time, just 2 cm short of Lebedeva. Only 14.45 was required as an automatic qualifier and 14 other women managed that, though none went over 14.90m.

In the first round of the final, Devetzi showed she was serious taking the early lead with 14.96m. In the second round Trecia-Kaye Smith jumped 15.02m but was overshadowed by Françoise Mbango Etone&#x27;s African record, a 25 cm improvement over her own record best. In the third round Devetzi improved to 15.14m to move back into second place. In the fourth round Devetzi improved her position again to 15.25m with Aldama moving into third place with her best of the day 14.99m. In the fifth round Lebedeva finally got over 15m with a 15.04m to take third place. She solidified her position with a 15.14m in the final round but Etone also solidified her position with a second 15.30m. After fouling her first attempt, Etone had five successive jumps over 15m including two at 15.30m. It would be the first Olympic gold medal for Cameroon. Etone would go on to defend her medal four year later with Cameroon&#x27;s second gold medal. Her winning 15.39m jump in Beijing stood as the second best jump in history until 2019.

Of the top 16 jumps in history, most are between Etone, Devetzi, Lebedeva and Aldama, and mostly from jumps in 2004. The only other athletes included in that group are two jumps by world record holder Kravets, two in 2019 by Yulimar Rojas and one each by Caterine Ibargüen and Yargelis Savigne (all three two time World Champions).

==Competition format==
The competition consisted of two rounds, qualification and final. In qualification, each athlete jumped three times (stopping early if they made the qualifying distance). At least the top twelve athletes moved on to the final; if more than twelve reached the qualifying distance, all who did so advanced. Distances were reset for the final round. Finalists jumped three times, after which the eight best jumped three more times (with the best distance of the six jumps counted).

==Schedule==

==Records==
, the existing world record, Olympic record, and world leading jump were as follows:


No new records were set during the competition.

<doc id="913333" wikidata="Q1433072" url="?curid=913333" title="Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Men's discus throw">
<text>The men&#x27;s discus throw competition at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens was held at the Olympic Stadium on 21–23 August. It was originally planned to hold the discus throw at the Ancient Olympia Stadium, but it was discovered that the field was not large enough to accommodate the range of modern discus throwers, and would have posed a danger to spectators. As such, it was decided to move the discus throw and to hold the shot put at the ancient stadium, despite the fact that the shot put was not contested at the Ancient Olympic Games. Thirty-nine athletes from 26 nations competed.

Hungary&#x27;s Róbert Fazekas had initially finished first in the final but committed an anti-doping breach for failing to submit a proper urine sample during the drug test and was thereby not allowed to present his gold in the medal ceremony, resulting in his disqualification. Lithuania&#x27;s Virgilijus Alekna, who originally placed second in the final, eventually defended his Olympic title at the time of the medal ceremony and was followed by Fazekas&#x27; teammate Zoltán Kővágó for the silver and Estonia&#x27;s Aleksander Tammert for the bronze. Alekna became the 14th man to win multiple medals in the discus throw, and the 4th to win multiple gold medals—matching Martin Sheridan and Bud Houser, but still well behind Al Oerter&#x27;s four championships. Kővágó&#x27;s medal was Hungary&#x27;s first medal in the event since Rudolf Bauer won gold in 1900. Tammert&#x27;s bronze was Estonia&#x27;s first men&#x27;s discus throw medal.

==Background==

This was the 25th appearance of the event, which is one of 12 athletics events to have been held at every Summer Olympics. The returning finalists from the 2000 Games were gold medalist (and 1996 finalist) Virgilijus Alekna of Lithuania, silver medalist (and 1996 gold medalist) Lars Riedel of Germany, bronze medalist Frantz Kruger of South Africa, fourth-place finisher Vasiliy Kaptyukh of Belarus, sixth-place finisher Jason Tunks of Canada, ninth-place finisher Aleksander Tammert of Estonia, tenth-place finisher Michael Möllenbeck of Germany, and eleventh-place finisher Dmitriy Shevchenko of Russia. Alekna was also the reigning world champion and runner-up in the 2002 European championship. The European winner was Hungarian Róbert Fazekas; he and Alekna were the favorites in Athens.

Moldova made its debut in the men&#x27;s discus throw. The United States made its 24th appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the boycotted 1980 Games.

==Qualification==
The qualification period for Athletics was 1 January 2003 to 9 August 2004. For the men&#x27;s discus throw, each National Olympic Committee was permitted to enter up to three athletes who had thrown 64.00 metres or further during the qualification period. The maximum number of athletes per nation had been set at 3 since the 1930 Olympic Congress. If an NOC had no athletes that qualified under that standard, one athlete who had thrown 62.55 metres or further could be entered.

==Competition format==

Each athlete received three throws in the qualifying round. All who achieved the qualifying distance progressed to the final. If fewer than twelve athletes achieved this mark, then the twelve furthest throwing athletes reached the final. Each finalist was allowed three throws in the last round, with the top eight athletes after that point being given three further attempts.

==Records==

, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.

Virgilijus Alekna broke the Olympic record with his first throw in the final, marked at 69.89 metres. His only other legal throw, his fifth, surpassed the old record but not the new one, at 69.49 metres. Róbert Fazekas was the first man to throw over 70 metres in Olympic competition, but his disqualification for doping meant that his 70.93 metres throw was not counted as a record.

==Schedule==

==Results==

===Qualifying round===

Rule: Qualifying standard 64.50 (Q) or at least best 12 qualified (q).

<doc id="913334" wikidata="Q731155" url="?curid=913334" title="Quebec French lexicon">
<text>There are various lexical differences between [[Quebec French]] and [[French language|Metropolitan French]] in France. These are distributed throughout the registers, from slang to formal usage.

Notwithstanding Acadian French in the Maritime Provinces, Quebec French is the dominant form of French throughout Canada, with only very limited interregional variations. The terms Quebec French and Canadian French are therefore often used interchangeably.

==Standardization==
The Office québécois de la langue française believes that neither morphology nor syntax should be different between Québécois and Metropolitan French, and even that phonetic differences should be kept to a minimum. However, starting in the 1960s, it agreed to the use of words then called &quot;well-formed Canadianisms &quot;(canadianismes de bon aloi)&quot;,&quot; that either are regional in nature (such as names of plants and animals), have been used since before the Conquest, or are justified in their origin and are considered to be equivalent or &quot;better&quot; than the standard equivalent.

A very small list of words was published in 1969, mainly containing words that were archaic in France, but still common in Quebec. This list especially contained imperial units and words from aboriginal languages. Subsequent lists have been published regularly since then.

Many differences that exist between Quebec French and European French arise from the preservation of certain forms that are today archaic in Europe. New words were also created for Quebec specialties that do not exist in Europe.

As with any two regional variants, there is an abundance of slang terms found in Quebec that are not found in France. Quebec French profanity uses references to Catholic liturgical terminology, rather than the references to prostitution that are more common in France. Many English words and calques have also been integrated in Quebec French, although less than in France. In Quebec, borrowed English words tend to have the same meaning as the English word. In France, they often have a very different meaning; for example &#x27;le smoking&#x27; for &#x27;tuxedo&#x27;. Borrowing from English is politically sensitive in Quebec and tends to be socially discouraged.

===Gender-neutral usage===

Formal Quebec French also has a very different approach to gender-neutral language than Metropolitan French. There is a much greater tendency to generalize feminine markers among nouns referring to professions. This is done in order to avoid having to refer to a woman with a masculine noun, and thereby seeming to suggest that a particular profession is primarily masculine. Forms that would be seen as highly unusual or stridently feminist in France are commonplace in Quebec, such as &quot;la docteure&quot;, &quot;la professeure&quot;, &quot;la première ministre&quot;, &quot;la gouverneure générale&quot;, and so forth. Many of these have been formally recommended by the &quot;Office québécois de la langue française&quot; and adopted by society at large. Official government and state titles and designations always have official, mandated French equivalent terms for each gender.

Also, rather than following the rule that the masculine includes the feminine, it is relatively common to create doublets, especially in polemical speech: &quot;Québécoises et Québécois,&quot; &quot;tous et toutes,&quot; &quot;citoyens et citoyennes&quot;.

As an isolated anecdote, a Quebec labour union once decided to promulgate an epicene neologism on the model of &quot;fidèle&quot;, calling itself the &quot;Fédération des professionnèles&quot;, rather than use either &quot;professionnels&quot; (masculine only) or &quot;professionnels et professionnelles&quot; (masculine and feminine). This sparked a fair amount of debate and is rather on the outer edge of techniques for nonsexist writing in Quebec French.

===Morphology (word formation)===

Some suffixes are more productive in Quebec than in France, in particular the adjectival suffix -&quot;eux&quot;, which has a somewhat pejorative meaning: &quot;téter → téteux&quot; (thick, dumb, nitpicking, nerd), &quot;niaiser → niaiseux&quot; (foolish, irritating); &quot;obstiner → ostineux&quot; (stubborn); &quot;pot → poteux&quot; (a user or dealer of marijuana). This originates in the Norman language.

The adjectival suffix -&quot;euse&quot; is added to verbal stems to form &quot;the machine that verbs.&quot; For example, &quot;laver&quot; → &quot;laveuse&quot; &quot;washing machine&quot;; &quot;balayer&quot; → &quot;balayeuse&quot; &quot;vacuum cleaner&quot; (but &quot;streetsweeper&quot; in France). In France &quot;vacuum cleaner&quot; is &quot;aspirateur&quot;.

==Preservation of forms==
Many differences that exist between Quebec French and Metropolitan French arise from the preservation of certain forms that are today archaic in Europe. For example, &quot;espérer&quot; for &quot;to wait&quot; (&quot;attendre&quot; in France).

&quot;Cour&quot; in Quebec is a backyard (&quot;jardin&quot; in French), whereas in France cour has dropped this meaning and primarily means a courtyard (as well as other meanings like court). However, in some areas of France, such as in the mining regions of northern France, cour still means backyard.

The word &quot;breuvage&quot; is used for &quot;[a] drink&quot; in addition to &quot;boisson&quot;; this is an old French usage (&quot;bevrage&quot;) from which the English &quot;beverage&quot; originates. Breuvage may be used in European French, but generally indicates some nuance, possibly pejorative.

The word &quot;piastre&quot; or &quot;piasse&quot;, a slang term for a dollar (equivalent to &quot;buck&quot; in English), was in fact the term originally used in French for the American or Spanish dollar (they had the same value for a long period).

The word &quot;couple&quot; is used in standard French as a masculine noun (a couple, married or unmarried), but in Quebec it is also used as a feminine noun in phrases like &quot;une couple de semaines&quot; (a couple of weeks). This is often thought to be an anglicism, but is in fact a preservation of an archaic French usage.

It is quite common in Quebec French to describe something positive using litotes, such as &quot;pas laid&quot; (&quot;not ugly&quot;) for beautiful or &quot;pas pire&quot; (&quot;not worst&quot;) for good when standard French would suggest using the positive equivalent instead. However, Metropolitan French has its own commonly used litotes: &quot;pas bête&quot; or &quot;pas con&quot; (smart); &quot;pas mal&quot; (fine); &quot;pas dégueu(lasse)&quot; (tasty); and &quot;pas top&quot;, &quot;pas super&quot; or &quot;pas génial&quot; (bad).

=== Prepositions ===
The preposition &quot;à&quot; is often used in possessive contexts, whereas standard French uses &quot;de&quot;; &quot;le char à Pierre&quot; (&quot;Pierre&#x27;s car&quot;) instead of &quot;la voiture de Pierre&quot;. This is also found in the informal French of France, such as &quot;Hier j&#x27;ai vu la copine à Bruno&quot; (&quot;Yesterday I saw Bruno&#x27;s girlfriend&quot;).

In a number of cases, Quebec speakers prefer to use the preposition &quot;à&quot; instead of using a non-prepositional phrase with &quot;ce&quot; (&quot;this&quot;); for example &quot;à matin&quot; or &quot;à soir&quot; instead of &quot;ce matin&quot; and &quot;ce soir&quot; (&quot;this morning&quot; and &quot;this evening&quot;). Note also &quot;à cette heure&quot;, pronounced and sometimes spelt &quot;asteure&quot; or &quot;astheure&quot; (literally &quot;at this time&quot;) for &quot;maintenant&quot; (&quot;now&quot;) and &quot;désormais&quot; (&quot;henceforth&quot;), which is also found in Queneau. These usages of &quot;à&quot; are considered colloquial.

==Nautical terms==
A number of terms that in other French-speaking regions are exclusively nautical are used in wider contexts in Quebec. This is often attributed to the original arrival of French immigrants by ship, and to the dominance of the Saint Lawrence River as the principal means of transport among the major settlements of the region in the past centuries. An example is the word &quot;débarquer&quot;, which in Quebec means to get off any conveyance (a car, a train); in France, this word means only to disembark from a ship or aircraft (&quot;descendre&quot; from other vehicles), plus some colloquial uses. Another example would be &quot;vadrouille&quot; for mop (in French it would mean wandering or a mop made of ropes and used on a ship, the regular house mop would be called &quot;serpillère&quot;).

==Political terms==
Since Canada uses the Westminster system, unlike republican France, many political terms devised in English have had to be imported or new terms created. This is not always easy, and can lead to awkward constructions, the most famous example being Dominion, for which there is no French translation. As well in Canadian English the first minister of the federation is called the Prime Minister and the first minister of a province is called a Premier. An electoral district in Canada is called a &quot;riding&quot; in anglophone Canada but a &quot;comté&quot; in Québec.
However French makes no distinction and both are called &quot;Premier ministre&quot; in all cases. For example, &quot;Premier ministre du Canada&quot;, &quot;Premier ministre du Québec / de l&#x27;Alberta&quot;, etc.

==Quebec specialties==
There are also words for Quebec specialties that do not exist in Europe, for example poutine, &quot;CEGEP&quot;, tuque (a Canadianism in both official languages), and &quot;dépanneur&quot; (a corner store/small grocery; &quot;dépanneur&quot; in France is a mechanic who comes in to repair a car or a household appliance, which is called a &quot;dépanneuse&quot; in Quebec).

Blueberries, abundant in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, are called &quot;bleuets&quot;; in France, they are lumped together with &quot;myrtilles&quot; (bilberries) and &quot;bleuet&quot; means cornflower. (&quot;Bleuet&quot; is also slang for someone from Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean.) Although very similar, these are not the same plants (i.e. myrtilles are &quot;Vaccinium myrtillus&quot; and bleuets are &quot;Vaccinium angustifolium&quot; or &quot;corymbosum&quot;).

==Informality==
French speakers of Quebec use the informal second-person pronoun more often and in more contexts than speakers in France do. In certain contexts it may be perfectly appropriate to address a stranger or even the customer of a store using , whereas the latter would be considered impolite in France. The split often runs across generations in Quebec: People between 40 and 60 years of age often feel that sales people, or service personnel giving them a instead of a are uncouth or uncultivated. People 60 years of age and older will sometimes feel insulted if a stranger uses the to them. Government employees (such as policemen or bureaucrats with some contact with the public) as well as employees of large stores or large chains in Quebec are usually instructed to use with everybody, unless some kind of is in play or they know the person well. Sometimes the split is also across social or educational lines. For instance, young academics are usually hesitant in using with slightly older colleagues who have just a few more years of seniority.

A similar distinction in English, where, since the second person singular &quot;thou&quot; went out of use 200 years ago, might be whether to address or respond to someone on a &quot;first-name basis&quot;. For example, one might say to a man that one has just met, &quot;Thank you, Mr. Gibson&quot; — equivalent to using . If Mr Gibson wants to maintain formality, that is, similar to using , he might say, &quot;You&#x27;re welcome&quot;, and if he wants to be more relaxed and familiar, he would add, &quot;Please call me Jim&quot;. This gives Anglophones an inkling of the use of in Canadian French.

Metropolitan French public speakers such as politicians occasionally come across as stuffy or snobbish to certain Quebec Francophones. There is also a certain impression among the Quebec population (men especially) that Metropolitan French is quite effeminate - though this is not often directly discussed. This may explain why even better educated Québécois rarely try to emulate the Metropolitan French accent, though many probably could do so with relative ease. This is also true for people from southern France. Visitors from southern France who move temporarily to Paris and pick up the local Parisian accent may be derided by their friends who have remained in the south. This is all similar to the perception North American English-speakers may have of British English as &quot;uppity&quot; or &quot;fancy&quot;.

==Idioms==
There is a huge variety of idioms in Quebec that do not exist in France, such as &quot;fait que&quot; (&quot;so&quot;); &quot;en masse&quot; (&quot;a lot&quot;); &quot;s&#x27;en venir&quot; (for &quot;arriver&quot; and &quot;venir ici&quot;); &quot;ben là!&quot; or &quot;voyons donc!&quot; (&quot;oh, come on!&quot;), &quot;de même&quot; (for &quot;comme ça&quot;).

Entire reference books have been written about idioms specific to Quebec. A handful of examples among many hundreds:
* &quot;J&#x27;ai mon voyage&quot; = &quot;J&#x27;en ai marre&quot; / &quot;Pas possible!&quot; = I&#x27;m fed up / Unbelievable!
* &quot;C&#x27;est de valeur&quot; = &quot;C&#x27;est dommage&quot; = What a pity
* &quot;Habillé comme la chienne à Jacques&quot; = Dressed up like a dog&#x27;s dinner
* &quot;C’est malade/fou raide&quot; = That&#x27;s sick/crazy/rad
* &quot;Se faire avoir&quot; = to get fooled
* &quot;Mais que&quot; = &quot;lorsque&quot;, &quot;quand que&quot; = When... (the subjunctive must follow this form)
* &quot;Tirer le diable par la queue&quot; = &quot;Avoir les difficultés avec l’argent&quot; = I&#x27;m in a tight spot financially
* &quot;Se faire passer un sapin&quot; = To be lied to
* &quot;Avoir une face à claque&quot; = a bad person
* &quot;Avoir les yeux dans la graisse de bines&quot; = to be in love or to be tired (glassy-eyed)
* &quot;Avoir l’estomac dans les talons&quot; = to be extremely hungry
* &quot;Être né pour un petit pain&quot; = One who doesn&#x27;t have many opportunities. Usually used in the negative form.
* &quot;Il fait frette&quot; = It is cold
* &quot;Chanter la pomme&quot; = to flirt
* &quot;Se pogner le cul&quot; = to sit and do nothing all day
* &quot;Je m&#x27;en sacre&quot; = I do not give a damn

Dialogue in sitcoms on Quebec television often uses such idioms extensively, which can make certain dialogues rather incomprehensible to French speakers of Europe. Most speakers will use various contractions, omitting certain articles or even changing the pronunciation of certain words, which can be daunting for inexperienced speakers.

==Slang terms==
As with any two regional variants, there is an abundance of slang terms found in Quebec that are not found in France. Quebec French profanity uses references to Catholic liturgical equipment, rather than the references to prostitution that are more common in France.

The expression &quot;you&#x27;re welcome&quot; is &quot;bienvenue&quot; or &quot;ça me fait plaisir&quot; in Quebec, though &quot;de rien&quot; or &quot;y&#x27;a pas de quoi&quot; is also used in Quebec. Note that the expression &quot;bonne journée&quot; (as opposed to &quot;bonjour&quot;) is also often used for &quot;goodbye&quot; in Quebec (similar to &quot;Good Day&quot;), which it is not in France (where it is more common to say &quot;au revoir&quot; or &quot;bye&quot;).

Some slang terms unique to Quebec:

==Words from aboriginal languages==

==Use of anglicisms==

Loanwords from English, as well as calques or loans of syntactic structures, are known as anglicisms (French: &quot;anglicismes&quot;).

===Colloquial and slang registers===

The use of anglicisms in colloquial and Quebec French slang is commonplace, but varies from a place to another, depending on the English presence in the area. These words cannot be used in official documents or in academic writing, etc. Some examples of long-standing anglicisms include:

It is also very commonplace for an English word to be used as a nonce word, for example when the speaker temporarily cannot remember the French word. This is particularly common with technical words. Since decades passed before technical documentation began to be printed in French in Quebec, an English word might be the most common way for a French-speaking mechanic or other technical worker to refer to the mechanisms he or she had to deal with. It is often difficult or impossible to distinguish between such a nonce anglicism and an English word quoted as such for effect.

One such example is the rural Québec pronunciation of North American car parts that are commonly used. Their pronunciation sometimes varies significantly and may even be found in written form as &#x27;wipeurs, winnecheer, houde, top, galipeur, tchok, naqueule, gasquette, shaffe, cameshaft, sille de crinque, taillerode or térodenne.

There are some anglicisms that have no obvious connection to any currently existing modern Canadian English idiom. For example, &quot;être sur le party&quot; (&quot;to be on the &#x27;party&#x27;&quot;, to be partying or to be in the mood for a party). Idioms like (to screw the pooch) are even used.

===Standard register===
A number of Quebecisms used in the standard register are also derived from English forms, especially as calques, such as &quot;prendre une marche&quot; (from &quot;take a walk,&quot; in France, &quot;se promener&quot;, also used in Quebec) and &quot;banc de neige&quot; (from English &quot;snowbank;&quot; in France, &quot;congère,&quot; a form unknown in Quebec.) However, in standard and formal registers, there is a much stronger tendency to avoid English borrowings in Quebec than in France.

As a result, especially with regard to in modern items, Quebec French often contains forms designed to be more &quot;French&quot; than an English borrowing that may be used anyway in European French, like &quot;fin de semaine&quot; which is &quot;week-end&quot; in France, or &quot;courriel&quot; (from &quot;courrier électronique&quot;) for France&#x27;s &quot;mail&quot; or &quot;mel&quot;.

Some are calques into French of English phrases that Continental French borrowed directly, such as &quot;un chien chaud&quot; for European French &quot;hot dog&quot;. In Quebec, the spelling &quot;gai&quot; to mean homosexual is standard. Note that in France, &quot;gai&quot; has kept the original meaning of &quot;happy&quot;, &quot;cheerful&quot; while &quot;gay&quot; is used to mean &quot;homosexual&quot; but specifically in reference to mass gay-American subculture and by those usually over 35 who identify as gay. Gay men in France 35 and under usually label themselves as &quot;homo&quot;, not &quot;gay&quot;.

Although many (not all) of these forms were promulgated by the Office québécois de la langue française (OQLF) of Quebec, they have been accepted into everyday use. Indeed, the French government has since adopted the word &quot;courriel&quot; (in 2003). The term has been gaining acceptance as it is now used in respected newspapers such as &quot;Libération&quot;.

===Jargons and slangs===
Several social groups, tied together by either a profession or an interest, use a part or all of the corresponding English jargon or slang in their domains, instead of that used in other French-speaking countries. English terms are, for example, very widely used in typically male jobs like engineering (notably mechanical engineering), carpentry, and computer programming. This situation was caused historically by a lack of properly translated technical manuals and documentation.

Recent translation efforts in targeted domains such as the automotive industry and environmental engineering are yielding some results encouraging to Francophiles. The most English-ridden Quebec slang without question is used among members of the gamer community, who are also for the most part Millennials and frequent computer users. In these circles, computer gaming slang is used as well as an enormous number of normal terms commonly found in computer applications and games (&quot;save&quot;, &quot;map&quot;, &quot;level&quot;, etc.).

===Perception===

The perceived overuse of anglicisms in the colloquial register is one cause of the stigmatization of Quebec French. Both the Québécois and the European French accuse each other (and themselves) of using too many anglicisms. A running joke of the difference between European French and Quebec French is that in Europe, &quot;on se gare dans un parking&quot; (one parks in a carpark) and in Quebec, &quot;on se parque dans un stationnement&quot; (one parks in a parking lot).

Quebec and France tend to have entirely different anglicisms because in Quebec they are the gradual result of two and a half centuries of living with English speaking neighbors, whereas in Europe anglicisms are much more recent and the result of the increasing international dominance of American English.

==Other differences==
Like most global languages there are regional differences. Even within Quebec there are regional uses of words or expression. Here are some other differences between standard Quebec French and France French:

Many, but not all, of the European equivalents for the words listed above are also used or at least understood in Quebec.

<text>The women&#x27;s [[discus throw]] competition at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in Athens was held at the Olympic Stadium on 20–21 August. It was originally planned to hold the discus throw at the Ancient Olympia Stadium, but it was discovered that the field was not large enough to accommodate the range of modern discus throwers, and would have posed a danger to spectators. As such, it was decided to move the discus throw and to hold the shot put at the ancient stadium, despite the fact that the shot put was not contested at the Ancient Olympic Games.

On December 5, 2012, Belarusian discus thrower Iryna Yatchenko was stripped of her bronze medal after drug re-testings of her samples on methandienone had been discovered positive. Following the announcement of Yatchenko&#x27;s disqualification, the International Olympic Committee Executive Board had distributed and awarded the bronze to Czech Republic&#x27;s Věra Pospíšilová-Cechlová, who originally finished fourth in the final.

==Competition format==
Each athlete receives three throws in the qualifying round. All who achieve the qualifying distance progress to the final. If less than twelve athletes achieve this mark, then the twelve furthest throwing athletes reach the final. Each finalist is allowed three throws in last round, with the top eight athletes after that point being given three further attempts.

==Schedule==

==Records==
, the existing World and Olympic records were as follows.

No new records were set during the competition.

Rule: Qualifying standard 62.50 (Q) or at least best 12 qualified (q).

<doc id="913336" wikidata="Q2311975" url="?curid=913336" title="Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Men's hammer throw">
<text>The men&#x27;s hammer throw competition at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens was held at the Olympic Stadium on 20–22 August. There were 35 competitors from 24 nations. After a series of doping-related disqualifications, the event was won by Koji Murofushi of Japan, the nation&#x27;s first medal in the event. All distances are given in metres.

==Disqualifications==

The event was marred by doping-related disqualifications, with the original first- and third-place athletes being removed. Adrián Annus of Hungary originally won the competition, but he was disqualified after being found guilty of tampering with his sample at the doping control. The original runner-up, Koji Murofushi, was accordingly declared the 2004 Olympic champion.

Originally, Ivan Tsikhan won the bronze medal. With Annus&#x27;s disqualification, Tsikhan moved up to the silver medal. However, he was disqualified in 2012 after a retest of his samples from 2004 were positive for methandienone. Tsikhan withdrew from the 2012 Summer Olympics as a result. The silver and bronze medal were not re-awarded. The athlete in a position to be elevated to the Olympic silver medal, Eşref Apak of Turkey, received a 2-year doping ban in 2013 for the use of a prohibited substance, which lasted from 8 June 2013 to 25 June 2015. The athlete in a position to be elevated to the Olympic bronze medal, Vadim Devyatovskiy of Belarus, had previously been subject to a court case by the International Olympic Committee regarding doping at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Аs the next two finishers Eşref Apak and Vadim Devyatovskiy had both been suspended from the sport for doping offenses since 2004, the IOC decided to declare the silver and bronze medals vacant, leaving the only medalists as Murofushi with gold (in the official publication of the results, Eşref Apak is listed second, but without getting a silver medal, Vadim Devyatovskiy is listed third, but without getting a bronze medal).

==Background==

This was the 24th appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1896. Seven of the 12 finalists from the 2000 Games returned: gold medalist (and 1996 finalist) Szymon Ziółkowski of Poland, silver medalist Nicola Vizzoni of Italy, bronze medalist (and 1992 silver medalist and 1996 finalist) Igor Astapkovich of Belarus, fifth-place finisher (and 1996 finalist) Ilya Konovalov of Russia, eighth-place finisher Vladimír Maška of the Czech Republic, ninth-place finisher Koji Murofushi of Japan, and twelfth-place finisher Alexandros Papadimitriou of Greece. The last two World Champions were Ziółkowski (2001) and Ivan Tsikhan of Belarus (2003). Tikhon, 2002 European champion Adrián Annus of Hungary, and Murofushi (bronze medalist in the 2003 World Championship and who, in 2003, had the best throw of anyone since 1986—a mark that is still, in 2021, the fourth-best throw of all time) were the favorites.

Albania, Tajikistan, and Turkey each made their debut in the event. The United States appeared for the 23rd time, most of any nation, having missed only the boycotted 1980 Games.

==Qualification==
The qualification period for Athletics was 1 January 2003 to 9 August 2004. For the men&#x27;s hammer throw, each National Olympic Committee was permitted to enter up to three athletes that had thrown 78.65 metres or further during the qualification period. The maximum number of athletes per nation had been set at 3 since the 1930 Olympic Congress. If an NOC had no athletes that qualified under that standard, one athlete that had thrown 74.35 metres or further could be entered.

==Competition format==

Each athlete received three throws in the qualifying round. All who achieved the qualifying distance of 78.00 metres progressed to the final. If fewer than twelve athletes achieved this mark, then the twelve furthest throwing athletes would reach the final. Each finalist was allowed three throws in last round, with the top eight athletes after that point being given three further attempts.

==Records==

<doc id="913345" wikidata="Q255991" url="?curid=913345" title="Tasmin Archer">
<text>Tasmin Archer (born 3 August 1963) is a British pop singer from Bradford, England. Her first album, &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, spawned the hit &quot;Sleeping Satellite&quot;, which reached number one in the United Kingdom and Ireland. She won the Brit Award for British Breakthrough Act in 1993 and has since released two more studio albums.

==Early life==
Archer was born in Bradford, Yorkshire, to Jamaican parents. She attended Grange Upper School and, after leaving, first worked as a sewing machine operator. She attended Bradford College in 1980 to study typing, and later became a clerk at Leeds Magistrates&#x27; Court.

Archer joined a group called Dignity as a backing vocalist, and played with different bands around the Bradford area. She helped out at a recording studio in Bradford called Flexible Response Studios, and subsequently began working with musicians John Hughes and John Beck as &quot;The Archers&quot;. During this time, Archer developed skills in the music business.

==Musical career==
===&quot;Great Expectations&quot;===
Archer signed to EMI in 1990 and released her first single, &quot;Sleeping Satellite,&quot; in September 1992, which went to number one on the UK Singles Chart. The single also enjoyed success in the US, where it peaked at number 32 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album &quot;Great Expectations&quot; followed in October 1992. It reached number eight on the UK Albums Chart, and achieved gold disc status by December for sales of more than 100,000 copies. Further singles from the album followed, and although they were Top 40 hits in the UK, they did not achieve the same level of success as her début.

Archer donated the royalties from her second single &quot;In Your Care&quot; to Childline. The song was about child abuse. In 1993 Archer won a BRIT Award for the Best British Breakthrough Act. She later joked that she kept her award in her kitchen cupboard and used it for cracking nuts and tenderizing steak.

===&quot;Bloom&quot;===
After disappearing from the limelight, Archer reappeared in 1996 with her second album &quot;Bloom&quot;. However, the single &quot;One More Good Night with the Boys&quot; failed to reach the UK Top 40, and the album peaked at number 95. In late 1997, disagreements with EMI left Archer somewhat disillusioned and feeling like she had been treated as a commodity. She decided to take a short break from the industry, after being let go by EMI. This break lasted two years.

After the break, Archer felt the time was right to start writing again, but now she was hindered by writer&#x27;s block. Although this did not prevent her from being initially creative, she found it difficult to finish anything musically.

===&quot;On&quot;===

After working through the block and starting in 2002, Archer and Hughes worked on a new album. Initially this was going to be titled &quot;Non-Linear&quot;, but later became &quot;On&quot;.

&quot;On&quot; was released on 25 September 2006 on Archer&#x27;s own label, Quiverdisc. It was preceded on 20 September by a download-only single, &quot;Every Time I Want It (Effect Is Monotony)&quot;, a radio edit of the album track &quot;Effect Is Monotony&quot;.

===Other work===
In a 2006 interview, Archer said she and John Hughes were pursuing opportunities to write for film and TV soundtracks. Subsequently, the partners provided work for &quot;EastEnders&quot; and other shows.

=== A Cauldron of Random Notes (2024) ===
Tasmin posted on X in July 2024: &quot;We are planning to have vinyl pressed for our new album &quot;A Cauldron Of Random Notes&quot; which is finished and should be released in the autumn&quot;.

<text>Johann Heinrich Bleuler, the Elder (31 December 1758 – 25 January 1823) was a Swiss artist who worked with porcelain, landscape sketches and gouache. He was also an art teacher and a publisher of engravings.

== Life ==
He was born in Zollikon and initially trained as a porcelain painter at the near Zürich. At the beginning of the 1780s, he settled in Feuerthalen and established a dynasty of artists that became known as the &quot;Bleulerische Malschule&quot;. Between 1799 and 1804, he worked at Laufen Castle near Schaffhausen, then returned home.

He catered to the popular tastes of the time; often in the style of Ludwig Hess, who had died prematurely. Much of his art involved gouache landscapes and panoramic views of Swiss cities. His watercolors are in the collection of the ETH Zürich. During his final years, he mostly painted flowers.

Bleuler died in 1823 in Feuerthalen.

== The Bleulerische Malschule ==
He had four children. His eldest son, Johann Heinrich Bleuler, the Younger (1787–1857) specialized in painting vedute. His second son, Johann Ludwig, was a landscape painter and art publisher.

He also took two of his godchildren into his home when their parents died; Johann Heinrich Uster (1774–1866), who married Bleuler&#x27;s daughter Karoline, and Johann Heinrich Wirz (1785–1866). Later, he adopted Anna Bose (1783–1851), who married Wirz and became a gouache painter. Eventually, his family and descendants included twenty-five artists.

<text>John Randall Durrance (July 20, 1912 – November 7, 2003) was a pioneering American rock climber and mountaineer.

==Climbing career==
Durrance learned to climb while attending high school in Germany and later founded the Dartmouth Mountaineering Club in 1936 while attending Dartmouth College. Some of his classic first ascents include the North Face of the Grand Teton and the &quot;Durrance Route&quot; on Devils Tower. His successful completion of the Grand&#x27;s Exum Ridge and West Face, along with his contributions to the development of bouldering, stand among his other climbing achievements.

On the 1939 American Karakoram expedition to K2 he attempted to climb K2, the second tallest mountain in the world. He became embroiled in controversy after four members of the expedition died and the expedition leader, Fritz Wiessner, blamed Durrance. A book seeking to shed light on the event, &quot;K2: The 1939 Tragedy&quot;, was published in 1993. The authors, William Putnam, a former president of the Alpine Club, and Andy Kauffman, a former director, relied on a Durrance diary that surfaced for the first time fifty years after the event to correct the controversy and place responsibility for the deaths on Wiessner, the expedition&#x27;s leader. Ed Viesturs, in his book &quot;K2: Life and Death on the World&#x27;s Most Dangerous Mountain&quot;, revisits all the available documentation and suggests instead that the unplanned decision to decommission all lower camps played a major role in the tragedy. Durrance, despite the claims being laid on him by Weissner, had hesitated to release his diary any earlier due to the amount of damage the controversy could do to people&#x27;s reputations if it were stirred up again.

==Personal life==
During the 1939 climb, Durrance saved the life of Chap Cranmer who was suffering from pulmonary edema. Mr. Cranmer&#x27;s family thanked Durrance by getting Durrance an internship with James J. Waring, an international expert on tuberculosis. Durrance took the internship and became a pulmonary physician at a Denver hospital. In addition to climbing and medicine another passion of his was hybridizing irises.

Durrance died on November 7, 2003, aged 91, survived by his widow, Stella Coulter Durrance, and their five children.

<text>Syed Hamid bin Syed Jaafar Albar (Jawi: سيد حميد بن سيد جعفر البر; &quot;&quot;; born 15 January 1944) is a Malaysian lawyer and politician who has served as 1st Chancellor of the Asia e University (AeU) since October 2022. He served as Minister in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Department, Minister of Justice, Minister of Defence, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Home Affairs in the Barisan Nasional (BN) administration under former Prime Ministers Mahathir Mohamad and Abdullah Ahmad Badawi from October 1990 to April 2009. He also served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Kota Tinggi from November 1990 to May 2013. He was a member of the Malaysian United Indigenous Party (BERSATU), a component party of the ruling Perikatan Nasional (PN) and formerly Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalitions. Prior to that, he was also a member of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), a component party of the ruling BN coalition. He retired from politics in February 2022 and left UMNO for BERSATU in September 2018. He had also served as the Chairman of Land Public Transport Commission (SPAD) which was already dissolved.

==Early life==
Syed Hamid was born in Kampung Melayu Air Hitam, Penang, Malaysia, to Syed Jaafar Albar, an UMNO politician and former cabinet minister. Syed Hamid&#x27;s father was of Hadhrami Arab descent, and migrated from Indonesia to Malaysia shortly before World War II.

He had his secondary education at Maxwell School before going to Methodist Boys&#x27; School (Kuala Lumpur) for his Form Six education. For his tertiary education, he read law in the Inns of Court, London and was called to the Degree of an Utter Barrister by the Honourable Society of Middle Temple in 1970. As a student in London, he set up a club for Malaysian expatriates and students.

He is married with 6 children.

==Political career==
Syed Hamid has been active in UMNO in his student days, including while studying in the United Kingdom. After returning to Malaysia he became a magistrate, and then president of the Sessions Court, before entering the corporate world. In 1986 he won election to UMNO&#x27;s Supreme Council and entered Parliament in 1990, as the member for Kota Tinggi. He was immediately appointed as Minister for Justice, and in 1995 became the Defence Minister.

In 1999, he was appointed as the Foreign Minister by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. In March 2008, he was appointed as the Home Minister. In April 2009, he was dropped from the Cabinet. The previous month he had contested, but failed to win, one of UMNO&#x27;s three vice-president positions at the party&#x27;s general assembly. He left Parliament in 2013, deciding not to re-contest the seat of Kota Tinggi, which he had held by large margins since 1990. On 18 February 2022, he announced his retirement from politics and devotion of time to legal practice work and non-governmental organisation (NGO) activities.

==Post-political career (2022–present)== 
===Chancellor of the Asia e University (2022–present)===
On 15 October 2022 during the 11th convocation ceremony of the Asia e University (AeU), Syed Hamid was appointed as its 1st Chancellor. His appointment was made based on his &quot;vast experience in administration and management he possesses&quot; and confidence that he would &quot;provide AeU with the direction and leadership to further enhance its academic standing&quot;. Responding to the appointment, Syed Hamid said that it was unexpected and that he was deeply moved, humbled and touched to get the &quot;recognition&quot;. He also described it as a &quot;great honour and privilege&quot;.

<text>Ovis dalli, also known as the Dall sheep or thinhorn sheep, is a species of wild sheep native to northwestern North America. &quot;Ovis dalli&quot; contains two subspecies: &quot;Ovis dalli dalli&quot; and &quot;Ovis dalli stonei&quot;. &quot;O. dalli&quot; live in mountainous alpine habitats distributed across northwestern British Columbia, the Yukon, Northwest Territories and Alaska. They browse a variety of plants, such as grasses, sedges and even shrubs, such as willow, during different times of the year. They also acquire minerals to supplement their diet from mineral licks. Like other &quot;Ovis&quot; species, the rams engage in dominance contests with their horns.

==Taxonomy and genetics==
The specific name &quot;dalli,&quot; is derived from William Healey Dall (1845–1927), an American naturalist. The common name, Dall&#x27;s sheep or Dall sheep is often used to refer to the nominate subspecies, &quot;O. d. dalli&quot;. The other subspecies, &quot;O. d. stonei&quot;, is called the Stone sheep.

Originally, the subspecies &quot;O. d. dalli&quot; and &quot;O. d. stonei&quot; were distinguished by the color of their fur. However, the pelage-based designations have been shown to be questionable. Complete colour intergradation occurs in both &quot;O. dalli&quot; sheep subspecies (i.e., Dall&#x27;s and Stone&#x27;s), ranging between white and dark morphs of the species. Intermediately coloured populations, called Fannin sheep, were originally (incorrectly) identified as a unique subspecies (&quot;O. d. fannini&quot;) with distributions inhabiting in the Pelly Mountains and Ogilvie Mountains of the Yukon Territory. Fannin sheep have more recently been confirmed as admixed individuals with predominantly Dall&#x27;s sheep genetic origins. Previous mitochondrial DNA evidence had shown no molecular division along earlier subspecies boundaries, although evidence from nuclear DNA may provide some support. Current taxonomy using mitochondrial DNA information may be less reliable due to hybridization between &quot;O. dalli&quot; and &quot;O. canadensis&quot; recorded in evolutionary history.

Current genetics analyses using a genomewide set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has confirmed new subspecies range boundaries for both Dall&#x27;s and Stone&#x27;s sheep, updating the previous pelage-based and mitochondrial DNA classifications.

==Description==
&quot;O. dalli&quot; stand about at the shoulder. They are off-white in color, and their coat consists of a fine wool undercoat and stiff, long, and hollow guard hairs. Their winter coats can be over thick. &quot;O. dalli&quot; can live to be 12 to 16 years of age.

&quot;O. dalli&quot; are sexually dimorphic, which means rams and ewes look different. Rams are larger than ewes and typically weigh between at maturity. Ewes weigh approximately on average. During the winter, adult sheep may lose up to 16% of their body mass, and lambs and yearlings as much as 40% depending on winter weather severity. &quot;O. dalli&quot; begin growing horns at about two months old. Ewes have small, slender horns compared to the massive, curling horns of rams. Young rams resemble ewes until they are about 3 years of age. At this point, their horns begin to grow much faster and larger than ewes&#x27; horns.

Adult male &quot;O. dalli&quot; have thick, curling horns. Adult males are easily distinguished by their horns, which continue to grow steadily from spring to early fall. This results in a start-and-stop growth pattern of rings called annuli. Annuli can be used to help determine age.

==Natural history==
===Ecology===
The sheep inhabit the subarctic and arctic mountain ranges of Alaska, the Yukon Territory, the Mackenzie Mountains in the western Northwest Territories, and central and northern British Columbia. &quot;O. dalli&quot; are found in areas with a combination of dry alpine tundra, meadows, and steep or rugged ground. This combination allows for both grazing and escape from predators.

&quot;O. dalli&quot; can often be observed along the Seward Highway South of Anchorage, Alaska, within Denali National Park and Preserve (which was created in 1917 to preserve the sheep from overhunting), at Sheep Mountain in Kluane National Park and Reserve, in the Tatshenshini Park Tatshenshini-Alsek Provincial Park in northwestern British Columbia, and near Faro, Yukon.

Primary predators of this sheep are wolf packs, coyotes, black bears, and grizzly bears; golden eagles are predators of the young. &quot;O. dalli&quot; have been known to butt gray wolves off the face of cliffs.

===Social structure===

Rams and ewes are rarely found in the same groups outside of the mating season, or rut, which occurs from mid-November through mid-December. For most of the year, rams feed in the best foraging areas to enhance their reproductive fitness. During spring and summer, ewes are more likely to select areas such as steep, rocky slopes with lower predation risk to raise offspring.

Social order and dominance rank is maintained in ram groups through a variety of behaviors including head-on collisions. These dramatic clashes involve each ram getting a running start before colliding, horns-first into one another. Other behaviors associated with establishing social order include leg kicks, bluff charges, and dominance mounting. Most of this behavior establishes order year-round, but clashes between males with similar horn sizes intensify as the rut approaches. Ewes occasionally engage in similar competitive behavior over feeding or bedding sites. Young sheep practice such interactions as part of their play. While rams do clash horns, it is done to establish order, not over fights to possess ewes.

Rams are known to occupy up to six seasonal ranges, including different areas used during autumn, rut (or mating season from mid-November to mid-December), midwinter, late winter/spring, and summer, as well as spending time at salt licks.

For most of the year, ewes select areas free of snow and close to forage. After lambs are born in May, close proximity to escape terrain as well as nearby forage are important in habitat selection. Ewes and lambs will travel farther from escape terrain to forage when in larger groups.

In the summer, food has a high variety and is abundant. In the winter, food is limited to what is available in snow-free areas, such as frozen grasses, sedges, lichens, or mosses. &quot;O. dalli&quot; will travel long distances in the spring to visit mineral licks to supplement their diet.

==Relationship with humans==
===Hunting===

The Inupiat people have a long history of hunting &quot;O. dalli&quot; that dates back to at least the 16th century. Sheep are valued for their skin, which is used for warm clothing, and their meat, especially in times when caribou are not available. Historically, the sheep were hunted in summer by foot and in winter by dog sled teams. Today, the rugged terrain in which they live still requires foot travel to reach these animals. The dependence on &quot;O. dalli&quot; for meat and clothing fluctuates with caribou populations. Caribou herds declined considerably in the 1940s, and &quot;O. dalli&quot; became an important harvest species. Since the 1990s, caribou populations have been large enough to sustain people. Consequently, subsistence harvest of &quot;O. dalli&quot; is lower now than in the 1940s, but sheep continue to be an important meat source when caribou migration routes shift during the winter or between years.

Where sport hunting is allowed in Alaska&#x27;s national preserves, hunters can harvest mature &quot;O. dalli&quot; rams that have horns that are full-curl or greater, have both tips broken off or are eight years of age or older.

===Climate change===
Changes in &quot;O. dalli&quot; abundance, distribution, composition and health may indicate changes happening with other species and ecosystem processes. The sheep live in alpine, or high mountain, areas. These areas are expected to experience significant changes associated with climate change. Changes may include shifts in locations of plant communities (e.g., an increase in shrubs in alpine areas), diversity of plant species (e.g., loss of important forage species for sheep), and local weather patterns (such as increased incidence of high winter snowfall and icing events), which may affect sheep distribution and abundance.
Some species are expected to benefit from climate change while others will not. Shrubs and woody plants typically dominate plant communities at lower elevations. As elevation increases, the dominant plant community transitions to one dominated by low-growing grasses, flowers, and lichens. Warming climate trends, longer growing seasons, and changes in precipitation have the potential to allow woody plant species to find suitable habitat at higher elevations.

As a result, low-growing alpine species may be out-competed or shaded by the encroaching woody plants. Changes in the seasonal availability and diversity of alpine plants may affect &quot;O. dalli&quot; populations by altering sheep diets and consequently where they can live in mountain parks, as well as ewe pregnancy rates and lamb growth and survival.

<text>Christophe Moreau (born 12 April 1971 in Vervins) is a French former professional road racing cyclist. For many years Moreau was the primary French contender for the general classification in the Tour de France: he finished in the top 12 in the GC five times and finished the race as best Frenchman in 2000, 2003, 2004 and 2005. He also enjoyed success in the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré, winning the race overall in 2001 and 2007.

==Early professional career==
Moreau debuted as a professional in 1995 with . He was a time trialist early in his career which brought him the victory in the Tour de l&#x27;Avenir prologue. He finished the 1997 Tour de France in 19th place overall.

==Festina affair==
Moreau continued his progression the following year when he won the final time trial and overall of the 1998 Critérium International. He tested positive for anabolic steroids at the 1998 Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré. Festina Team director Bruno Roussel defended Moreau by saying it was another member of the support staff who had deceived the cyclist and caused him to take the anabolic steroids. As a result of this defence which was put forward by his lawyer, Moreau was able to continue competition. But during the 1998 Tour de France, after the Festina team soigneur Willy Voet was caught at the French-Belgian border, a doping scandal was uncovered which was referred to as the Festina affair. Moreau, along with two other members of the Festina team, Laurent Brochard and Armin Meier, admitted taking EPO after being arrested and were ejected from the race. Confessing alongside the other team members - except Richard Virenque - Moreau served a six-month suspension before returning to racing.

==Post-suspension career==
Moreau returned to the 1999 Tour de France where he placed 3rd in the stage 8 individual time trial behind American Lance Armstrong and Swiss Alex Zülle 
 and finished the Tour in the 25th place.

In the 2000 Tour de France, Moreau finished a career best with fourth place behind Lance Armstrong, Jan Ullrich and Spanish Festina teammate Joseba Beloki. This demonstrated him as a competent climber. This was the first time he finished as highest placed French rider at the Tour and it fueled hopes that he could win the race some day. He would finish highest placed French rider in the 2003, 2004 and 2005 editions of the Tour de France.

In 2001 and still riding for Festina, Moreau won the prestigious stage race the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré. Moreau took the lead on the fifth stage by only one second over Russian Pavel Tonkov. On the following day, both finished together second and third on the stage where there were no seconds awarded at the stage finish. Moreau withstood the many attacks of Tonkov on the final stage to win the race. Several weeks later, he won the prologue of the 2001 Tour de France and put on the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification. Moreau was presented with the yellow jersey by two podium girls. One of which he began a relationship after meeting on the Tour podium and would later marry. Moreau ended the Tour prematurely when he withdrew on the 12th stage. Festina choose to end its sponsorship of a cycling team so Moreau joined Crédit Agricole.

==Career at Crédit Agricole==
In 2002, in his first race of the season, Moreau crashed and broke his collarbone. Moreau finished third overall in the Dauphiné Libéré behind the American teammates Lance Armstrong and Floyd Landis. In the 2002 Tour de France Moreau crashed on a descent on stage 15 and had to abandon again.

In 2003, Moreau won the Four Days of Dunkirk race before going on to finish 8th in the 2003 Tour de France. At a pre season training camp in 2004, Moreau injured his knee which delayed his return to competition. His first win of the year came in the Trophée des Grimpeurs in May. Two weeks later he won the Tour du Languedoc Roussillon stage race. In the 2004 Tour de France, he was again the best French finisher in 12th place. During the 2005 Tour de France, he went very close to wearing the yellow jersey in the first days in the Alps but fell back to finish in the 11th place. At this time his team Credit Agricole publicly expressed their dissatisfaction with his results and he left the team for AG2R Prévoyance. Moreau finished 11th overall in the 2005 Tour de France.

==Career after Crédit Agricole==
Moreau was expected to support his new teammate Francisco &quot;Paco&quot; Mancebo at the 2006 Tour de France who had finished the 2005 Tour de France in fourth place. In the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré, Moreau finished second on the general classification behind Leipheimer and won the king of the mountains competition. When the Operation Puerto doping scandal was revealed the day before the Tour began, Mancebo was banned from competing in the Tour and Moreau became the leader for the general classification. After teammate Cyril Dessel took the yellow jersey on stage 11, Moreau worked for Dessel to try to preserve Dessel&#x27;s high placing. On the 19th stage Moreau attacked on the climb to bring himself further up the classification and he finished the 2006 Tour de France in the 8th place behind Dessel (Moreau was later moved up to 7th place after the disqualification of Floyd Landis).

In the latter part of his career he was considered a &#x27;clean&#x27; rider, and told reporters in 2007 that it had a big impact on him as a racer. &quot;For my part, I paid for what I did,&quot; he said. &quot;All I know is that I came out of it stronger. It transformed my life.&quot;
In the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré, Moreau demonstrated great form and panache. In the second stage with 40 km to go, he attacked with several others. With 7 km to go Moreau was driving the pace with Spaniard José Antonio Redondo. At the end of the stage, Redondo did not contest the sprint as he had not been working in the break, Moreau took the stage and the leader&#x27;s jersey. On the following stage 3 Individual time trial, Moreau finished some way back and lost over around 3 minutes. But on the stage to the legendary Mont Ventoux, Moreau attacked on the ascent and won the stage with over a minute on the second-place finisher and over two minutes on his rivals for the general classification. He then lay in second overall 14 seconds behind the yellow jersey which he took back on stage six to win the race. Two weeks later, he carried that same form to win the French national cycling championships. Despite being a favourite for the Individual time trial championships, Moreau finished way far back, but his form showed itself in the National cycling championships road race, in which he attacked his two breakaway companions with 40 km to the finish. He built up a great lead and won the championships with over two minutes over the second and third-place finishers. At 36 years of age, he won his first French champion title and pulled on the tricolour jersey. Moreau started the 2007 Tour de France in good form and was in the top ten of the general classification after the first mountain stages of the Alps. However, after a crash in the fifteenth stage, Moreau fell back in the general classification and rode one of the Pyrenean stages in the gruppetto, which is the part of the peloton for the riders who wish only to make the time limit imposed on a mountain stage to remain in the race.

In September 2007, Moreau, citing financial reasons, announced that he was leaving AG2R Prévoyance and was signing a one-year contract with Agritubel for the 2008 season. In the 2008 Tour de France Moreau quit the race during the 7th Stage.

On 17 July, during the 2009 Tour de France, Moreau signed with the team for 2010, after previously having said he would retire following the 2009 season.

<doc id="913388" wikidata="Q17070604" url="?curid=913388" title="National Association of Educational Broadcasters">
<text>The National Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB) was a US organization of broadcasters with aims to share or coordinate educational programmes. It was founded as the Association of College and University Broadcasting Stations (ACUBS) in 1925 as a result of &quot;Fourth National Radio Conference&quot;, held by the U.S. Department of Commerce.

It was primarily a &quot;program idea exchange&quot; with 25 members that occasionally attempted to rebroadcast programs shared between them. The original constitution for the organization read:

::&quot;Believing that radio is in its very nature one of the most important factors in our national and international welfare, we, the representatives of the institutions of higher learning, engaged in educational broadcasting, do associate ourselves together to promote, by mutual cooperation and united effort, the dissemination of knowledge to the end that both the technical and educational feature of broadcasting may be extended to all.&quot;

ACUBS held its first annual conference July 1 and 2, 1930 in Columbus, Ohio joining with the Institution of Education by Radio.

In September 1934, the organization rewrote its constitution, and changed its name from the Association of College University Broadcasting Stations (ACUBS) to the &quot;National Association of Educational Broadcasters.&quot;

In 1938, NAEB persuaded the Federal Communications Commission to reserve five radio channels for educational broadcasting.

In 1945 the FCC reserved five of the 40 channels in new high-frequency band for Non-commercial educational stations. There were initially planned to be AM services; however, they eventually manifested as FM ones.

NAEB merged with the Association of Education by Radio-Television in 1956. It was reorganized in 1963 with two new divisions, Educational Television Stations and National Educational Radio. These divisions lasted until 1973, when they were diminished. Their roles were taken over by Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and Association of Public Radio Stations (APRS) respectively. The APRS became the &quot;Washington lobby and public relations arm of CPB-qualified radio stations.&quot; The APRS merged with National Public Radio (NPR) in 1977, which allowed NPR to provide &quot;leadership of a full-fledged membership organization providing member stations with training, program promotion and management, and representing the interests of public radio stations before Congress, the FCC and other regulatory organizations.&quot; Before this merger, NPR was &quot;largely a production and distribution center,&quot; so the merger was influential in making NPR what it is today.

Until it folded in 1981, NAEB was public broadcasting&#x27;s primary voice, forum and program distributor.

<text>The Montshire Museum of Science is a hands-on science museum located in Norwich, Vermont, United States.

== History ==
The name &quot;Montshire&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;Vermont&quot; and &quot;New Hampshire&quot;. It was cofounded in 1974 by Dr. Robert Chaffee, former Museum Director of the Dartmouth College Museum. 

When the college museum closed, Chaffee and Walter Paine devised a community museum and education center, incorporating it as the Montshire. In 1976, Dartmouth College donated the collection of biological and geological collections to the new museum.

The Montshire Museum was first located in a former bowling alley building in 1976 in Hanover, New Hampshire, and was later moved across the Connecticut River to a purpose-built building in Norwich in 1989.
== Description ==

The museum, including the building and nature trails, is located on over of land. It has over 150 exhibits relating to the natural and physical sciences, ecology, and technology. Its live animal exhibits include a hive of honeybees that is connected to the outdoors, a colony of leafcutter ants, and aquariums that feature life in local waters.

Outside the museum building, there is a Science Park including a scale model of the Solar System (Pluto is located away), and interactive exhibits on water, light, sound, and motion. Among the sound exhibits there are &quot;whisper dishes&quot; (parabolic dishes apart) and a musical fence built by Paul Matisse, grandson of painter Henri Matisse. Each year, the museum holds an annual igloo build.

<doc id="913392" wikidata="Q938446" url="?curid=913392" title="Haberfield, New South Wales">
<text>Haberfield is a suburb in the Inner West of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Haberfield is located 6.5 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the Inner West Council. 

Haberfield sits south of Iron Cove, which is part of Sydney Harbour. It is bounded to the east by the Hawthorne Canal, to the northwest by the Iron Cove Creek canal and to the southwest by Parramatta Road. Its main road is Ramsay Street and the point of land that faces Iron Cove, Dobroyd Point, is a historical locality of Sydney. Haberfield was dubbed &quot;the garden suburb&quot; in the early 20th century and retains its well-kept parks, tree-lined streets and fine Federation-era houses with immaculate gardens. The entire suburb is heritage-listed. It is also known for its Italian culture.

== History ==
Haberfield was named by early landholder Richard Stanton, after the financial benefactor of his wife&#x27;s family; Lord Haberfield. Stanton&#x27;s wife&#x27;s maiden name was Nichols.

===Aboriginal prehistory===
The area which comprises Haberfield was part of the broader area in which lived people from the Darug tribe known variously as the Wangals or Cadigals from the Eora nation. The modern-day Hawthorne Canal is believed to be the border between these two tribes. There is no specific evidence of indigenous settlement in the area. However, the area that is now Haberfield was one of the last areas in the inner-west to be developed and so, in the late 19th century, it again became a home to local kooris.

===European settlement===
Nicholas Bayly, a soldier, received the first land grant in the area in 1803 but sold it two years later to Simeon Lord who called it Dobroyde Estate. Lord gave the land to his daughter Sarah Ann and her new husband David Ramsay as a wedding present in 1825 and it stayed in the hands of the Ramsay family until the end of the century. The Ramsays developed orchards in the area and built a number of fine houses for various members of the family including Yasmar (Ramsay spelt backwards) and St David&#x27;s Presbyterian church. They also created four of the suburb&#x27;s current streets: Ramsay Street, Dalhousie Street (named after the Ramsay&#x27;s historic home in Scotland), Boomerang Street and Waratah Street.
In 1901, landholder Richard Stanton bought from two Ramsay children and subdivided the area to create a garden suburb. Sydney had recently suffered outbreaks of the bubonic plague in overcrowded parts of the inner city and the garden suburb movement was a response to that, encouraging fresh air. He also claimed the development to be &quot;slumless, laneless and publess&quot;. The houses were designed by the architectural firm Spencer, Stansfield and Wormald. Stanton named the suburb &#x27;Haberfield&#x27;, after the English branch of his family. The fact that the development started in 1901 and a number of the early streets were named after prominent federal politicians has led to the suburb also being known as &#x27;The Federation Suburb&#x27;.

===Heritage===
The majority of houses in Haberfield are protected under a &#x27;heritage order&#x27;, which is the main reason why so many original Victorian and Federation houses still exist in the area. Renovations and additions to both houses and properties must follow strict guidelines ensuring they stay true to the era&#x27;s style. Some examples of rules include: banning the addition of second storeys unless in the existing roof space, banning the demolishing of any protected houses, ensuring a 50:50 ratio of &#x27;hard surface&#x27; to &#x27;soft surface&#x27; on the property, ensuring house exteriors are painted in federation colours. Houses must also have a roof consisting of terracotta or slate tiles.

One notable landmark is Yasmar, at 185 Parramatta Road. Formerly known as Yasmar Hostel, this building was built circa 1870 of dressed stone, with a verandah and iron columns. It also features French windows and extensive cedar joinery, and is set in a lush garden. It was later part of Yasmar Juvenile Centre and is listed on the Register of the National Estate.

Haberfield has a heritage association to help residents maintain their heritage properties.

===21st century===
A proposal was made by McDonald&#x27;s to build a drive-thru outlet on Parramatta Road in Haberfield in 2011. This was fiercely opposed by a group of local residents who wanted to preserve the suburb&#x27;s &quot;cultural and architectural heritage.&quot; The development application was rejected by Ashfield Council in 2009, however McDonald&#x27;s appealed to the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales and the appeal was upheld in 2011, but with modifications to the proposed building. Following the opening of McDonald&#x27;s in Haberfield, there were complaints about odours coming from the site in 2012 and 2013.

== Heritage listings ==
Haberfield has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 51- 53 Dalhousie Street: St David&#x27;s Uniting Church
* 16 Deakin Avenue: Derrylyn
* 185 Parramatta Road: Yasmar
* 5 Rogers Avenue: The Bunyas
* 11 St Davids Road: St. David&#x27;s Road Depot

==Commercial area==

Haberfield also has a strong Italian influence, which is most evident in the local shops along Ramsay Street, close to the intersection with Dalhousie Street. These include a hand made pasta shop, a traditional Italian bakery, traditional and contemporary Italian pastry shops and gelaterias, and Italian delicatessens and butchers, as well as many Italian cafes, coffee shops and restaurants. The primary supermarket in Haberfield is IGA Lamonica which also has a well-stocked delicatessen inside. Many of the shops in Haberfield have received various awards for their quality.

==Schools==
Haberfield has three primary schools but no high schools. Two of the schools are state run: Haberfield Public School on the corner of Bland Street Denman avenue and Dobroyd Point Public School on Waratah Street. The third is the St Joan of Arc Catholic School on Dalhousie Street opposite St Joan of Arc Church.
==Transport==

The Inner West Light Rail skirts the suburb&#x27;s eastern border with Leichhardt. Because of this, none of the three stops serving Haberfield are centrally located within the suburb. Hawthorne (near Barton Avenue) and Marion (near Marion Street) are the primary stops serving Haberfield. Taverners Hill (near Parramatta Road) is in the south-east corner of the suburb at the southern border with Summer Hill and the south-eastern border with Lewisham, in addition to the border with Leichhardt. To the east, the light rail offers a direct link to Pyrmont and Darling Harbour, while to the south it provides an out-of-station interchange with Lewisham railway station and a direct interchange with Dulwich Hill railway station.

Bus routes 461 (from the city down Parramatta Rd), 406 (from either Five Dock or Hurlstone Park through Dalhousie St), 437 (city or Five Dock via Dalhousie St) and 438 (from city or Abbotsford via Ramsay St) serve the suburb.

Summer Hill railway station, which is serviced by the T2 Leppington &amp; Inner West Line and T3 Liverpool &amp; Inner West Line, is close to the southern border of the suburb. Five Dock railway station on the Sydney Metro West rapid transit line will serve the neighbouring suburb of Five Dock.

Since July 2019, an interchange at Haberfield has allowed access to the M4 Motorway, which passes beneath Haberfield in tunnels constructed as part of the WestConnex project.

==Population==

At the 2021 census, there were 6,480 residents in Haberfield. The population was older than average, with a median age of 46 and with 22.2% of people aged 65 and over. 69.8% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were Italy (10.6%) and England (3.0%). The most common responses for religion in the census were Catholic (44.1%) and No Religion (32.5%). 70.7% of people spoke only English at home.

==Gallery==
===Churches===
Haberfield has four historical churches in Dalhousie Street: St Oswalds Anglican Church, Saint Joan of Arc Catholic Church, St Davids Uniting Church, Haberfield Baptist Church.
===Houses===
About 1500 houses were constructed in this and adjoining areas to designs by architects J Spencer Stansfeld and D Wormald, to Federation or Bungalow styles.

Haberfield espoused the philosophy of the Garden Suburb with its gardens containing distinctive planting, fences, gates and curving tiled paths. Houses in Haberfield were typically &#x27;detached&#x27; double-brick dwellings situated on their own block of land measuring 50&#x27; x 150&#x27; (15 m x 45 m). No two houses were alike, although there were many common themes throughout the suburb. The roofs were either slate or Marseilles tile. All had front verandahs. Decorative features typically used in this area include leadlight windows depicting Australian flora and fauna, Art Nouveau timber detailing and tuckpointed brickwork.

Houses listed under the NSW Heritage Act:

<text>Daulatabad Fort, originally Deogiri Fort, is a historic fortified citadel located in Daulatabad village near Aurangabad, Maharashtra, India. It was the capital of the Yadavas (9th century – 14th century CE), for a brief time the capital of the Delhi Sultanate (1327–1334), and later a secondary capital of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate (1499–1636).

Around the 6th century CE, Devagiri emerged as an important uplands town near present-day Sambhajinagar, along caravan routes going towards western and southern India. The historical triangular fortress in the city was initially built around 1187 by the first Yadava monarch, Bhillama V. In 1308, the city was annexed by 
Alauddin Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate, which ruled over some parts of the northern India. In 1327, Muhammad bin Tughluq of the Delhi Sultanate renamed the city Daulatabad and shifted his imperial capital to the city from Delhi, ordering a mass migration of Delhi&#x27;s population to the now Daulatabad. However, Muhammad bin Tughluq reversed his decision in 1334 and the capital of the Delhi Sultanate was shifted back to Delhi.

In 1499, Daulatabad became part of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate, who used it as their secondary capital. In 1610, near Daulatabad Fort, the new city of Sambhajinagar, then named Khadki, was established to serve as the capital of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate by the Ethiopian military leader Malik Ambar, who was brought to India as a slave but rose to become a popular Prime Minister of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate. Most of the present-day fortifications at Daulatabad Fort were constructed under the Ahmadnagar Sultanate.

==Fort==

The area of the city the hill-fortress of Devagiri (sometimes Latinised to Deogiri). It stands on a conical hill, about 200 meters high. Much of the lower slopes of the hill has been cut away by Yadava dynasty rulers to leave 50-meter vertical sides to improve defenses. The only means of access to the summit is by a narrow bridge, with the passage for not more than two people abreast, and a long gallery, excavated in the rock, which has, for the most part, a very gradual upward slope.

About midway along this gallery, the access gallery has steep stairs, the top of which is covered by a grating intended to form the hearth of a huge fire kept burning by the garrison above in times of war. At the summit, and at intervals on the slope, are specimens of massive old cannon facing out over the surrounding countryside. Also at the midway, there is a cave entrance meant to confuse the enemies.

The fort had the following specialties which are listed along with their advantages :

# No separate exit from the fort, only one entrance/exit - This is designed to confuse the enemy soldiers to drive deep into the fort in search of an exit, at their own peril.
# No parallel gates - This is designed to break the momentum of the invading army. Also, the flag mast is on the left hill, which the enemy will try to capture, thus will always turn left. But the real gates of the fort are on the right &amp; the false ones on the left, thus confusing the enemy.
# Spikes on the gates - In the era before gunpowder, intoxicated war elephants were used as battering rams to break open the gates. The presence of spikes ensured that the elephants died of injury.
# Complex arrangement of entryways, curved walls, false doors - Designed to confuse the enemy, false, but well-designed gates on the left side lured the enemy soldiers in &amp; trapped them inside, eventually feeding them to crocodiles.
# The hill is shaped to discourage climbing, though historical sources on its specific design features are unclear.

==City==
Daulatabad (19°57’N 75°15’E) is located at a distance of 16 km northwest of Chatrapati Sambhajinagar, the district headquarters and midway to the Ellora Caves. The original widespread capital city is now mostly unoccupied and has been reduced to a village. Much of its survival depends on the tourists to the old city and the adjacent fort.

==History==

The site had been occupied since at least 100 BC, and now has remains of Hindu and Jain temples similar to those at Ajanta and Ellora. A series of niches carved with Jain Tirthankara in cave 32.

The city is said to have been founded c. 1187 by Bhillama V, a Yadava prince who renounced his allegiance to the Chalukyas and established the power of the Yadava dynasty in the west. During the rule of the Yadava king Ramachandra, Alauddin Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate raided Devagiri in 1296, forcing the Yadavas to pay a hefty tribute. When the tribute payments stopped, Alauddin sent a second expedition to Devagiri in 1308, forcing Ramachandra to become his vassal.

In 1328, Muhammad bin Tughluq of the Delhi sultanate transferred the capital of his kingdom to Devagiri, and renamed it Daulatabad. The sultan made Daulatabad (Devagiri) his second capital in 1327. Some scholars argue that the idea behind transferring the capital was rational, because it lay more or less in the centre of the kingdom, and geographically secured the capital from the north-west frontier attacks.

In the Daulatabad fort, Tughluq found the area arid and dry. His capital-shift strategy failed miserably. Hence he shifted back to Delhi and earned the moniker &quot;Mad King&quot;.

The next important event in the Daulatabad fort time-line was the construction of the Chand Minar by the Bahmani Sultan Hasan Gangu Bahmani, also known as Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah (r. 3 August 1347 – 11 February 1358).

Hasan Gangu built the Chand Minar as a replica of the Qutb Minar of Delhi, of which he was a great fan. He employed Iranian architects to build the Minar, who used lapis lazuli and red ocher for coloring. Currently, the Minar is out of bounds for tourists, because of a suicide case.

The Chini Mahal, located further inside the fort, is believed to date back to the Nizam Shahi dynasty. Later, it was repurposed as a prison by the Mughals, reputedly holding Abul Hasan Qutb Shah of the Golconda Sultanate of Hyderabad.

Most of the present-day fortification was constructed under the Bahmanis and the Nizam Shahs of Ahmednagar Sultanate.
The Mughal Governor of the Deccan under Shah Jahan, captured the fortress in 1632 and imprisoned the Nizam Shahi prince.

It was captured by the Maratha Empire in 1760.

==Legend==
In Hindu lore, Lord Shiva is believed to have stayed on the hills surrounding this region. Hence the fort was originally known as Devagiri, literally &quot;hills of god&quot;.

==Structure==
Daulatabad is a fortified city that is the cumulative result of 1000 years of building history, overseen by successive rulers of the Deccan. It can be divided into three distinct zones: Balakot, the innermost fortification atop the conical hill itself; Kataka, the intermediate fortification; and Ambarkot, the outermost defense wall which encloses most of the historic city.

=== Balakot ===
Balakot is the name given to the rock fort upon the conical Deogiri hill, and was termed so by the Tughluqs. The Yadavas initiated this fortification by scarping the slopes of the hill until they were vertical, rising 50m above ground, and excavated a deep moat at the base of the hill. The Balakot site contains a number of palatial buildings. The most notable is the Chini Mahal, dating to the Nizam Shahi dynasty. There is no evidence tying it to any specific builder; it likely originates from the early days of the dynasty, and takes its name from blue/white tiles set into its facade. The palace is in a crumbling state, and currently survives as a long hall, with an entrance on one side. The palace may have been larger in the past, but was destroyed by the Mughals and converted into a prison.

Beneath the northern flank of Balakot is a derelict palace building of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, built after the Mughal capture of the fort in 1633. It consists of two large courts, an apartment building towards the west, and a &quot;hammam&quot;. Another pavilion of Shah Jahan is found beneath the summit of Balakot. Balakot also contains a ruined royal residence dating to the 15th century, built by the Bahmani dynasty during its early days.

=== Kataka ===
Kataka is a circular, intermediary fort at the Daulatabad site. It was built by Tughluq commanders as an expansion to Balakot, occupying its northern and eastern flanks, adjoining the base of the Devagiri hill. The defensive wall is a massive double rampart, featuring bastions and moats. Lying just outside the eastern entrance of the wall is a Mughal-era &quot;hammam&quot;. A notable structure within Kataka is the large Jami mosque of Daulatabad, which dates to 1318. A short distance away is the Chand Minar. Located within a sector of the fort called Mahakot, it is an exceptionally tall tower built by Alauddin Bahmani in 1446 to commemorate his capture of Daulatabad. Its base is concealed by a small structure, which contains a mosque.

=== Ambarkot ===
Ambarkot is the outermost defense wall at the Daulatabad site, enclosing most of the historic city. It is typically attributed to Malik Ambar, minister of the Nizam Shahis, but may have been built by the Tughluqs. It is elliptical in shape, and spans two kilometres north to south. Similar to Kataka, the Ambarkot rampart consists of two defense walls. Scholar Pushkar Sohoni notes that there are a number of historic structures around the Ambarkot walls that have not been investigated yet.

==Transport==

===Road Transport===
Daulatabad is in the outskirts of Aurangabad, and is on the Aurangabad - Ellora road (National Highway 2003). Aurangabad is well connected by road and 20 km away from Devagiri.

===Rail Transport===
Daulatabad railway station is located on the Manmad-Purna section of South Central Railways and also on the Mudkhed-Manmad section of the Nanded Division of South Central Railway. Until reorganisation in 2005, it was a part of the Hyderabad Division Aurangabad is a major station near Daulatabad. The Devagiri Express regularly operates between Mumbai and Secunderabad, Hyderabad, via the city of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Nagar.

<doc id="913404" wikidata="Q595114" url="?curid=913404" title="Zone-tailed hawk">
<text>The zone-tailed hawk (Buteo albonotatus) is a medium-sized hawk of warm, dry parts of the Americas. It is somewhat similar in plumage and flight style to a common scavenger, the turkey vulture, and may benefit from being able to blend into groups of vultures. It feeds on small terrestrial tetrapods of all kinds.

==Taxonomy==
In 1844, the English zoologist George Robert Gray, in his &quot;List of the Specimens of Birds in the Collection of the British Museum&quot;, mentioned the zone-tailed hawk under the common name &quot;white spotted buzzard&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Buteo albonotatus&quot;. As Gray omitted a species description, his binomial name is considered &quot;nomen nudum&quot;, a naked name, and is not recognised. Instead, the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup is recognised as the authority as in 1847, he provided a brief description and used Gray&#x27;s name &quot;Buteo albonotatus&quot;. The type locality is Mexico. The specific epithet &quot;albonotatus&quot; combines the Latin &quot;albus&quot; meaning &quot;white&quot; with &quot;notatus&quot; meaning &quot;marked&quot;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==

The zone-tailed hawk is a fairly large but slender &quot;Buteo&quot; hawk. Grown birds are in length with a wingspan of about . The zone-tailed is comparable in length and wingspan to common large &quot;Buteos&quot; found to the north such as Swainson&#x27;s and red-tailed hawk, but may weigh considerably less. Their body mass can range from . In measurements, the sexes are close in size, but the female, at an average of , is much heavier and bulkier than the male, at an average of . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the fairly long tail is and the tarsus is .

The adult plumage is mostly blackish. The notable exception is that the flight feathers are barred with lighter gray, which can appear solid silver-gray from a distance. The tail has three or four bands (the &quot;zones&quot; of the common name), white from below and light gray from above, of which the one second from the tip is particularly broad and conspicuous. The cere and legs are yellow, the lores are light gray and a light touch of white may be seen on the face. Immatures are similar except for small white spots on the breast and tails with narrow gray and black bands and a broad dark tip. The zone-tailed hawk adults resemble the common black hawk but are distinctly more slender in flight and overall small, and they have more white bars on the tail. Other &quot;Buteo&quot; hawks in their dark phase, especially the broad-winged hawk, may appear similar but often have more silvery coloration on the wings and are broader-winged.

The call is a loud scream, a somewhat typical &quot;Buteo&quot; call, dropping in pitch at the end, &quot;kra kree-kree-kree-kree&quot;. In at least some birds, there is an abrupt rise in pitch (like a break to a falsetto voice) in the middle and an equally abrupt drop back down. They are most often heard vocalizing when engaging in breeding displays at the beginning of the mating season. When disturbed at the nest, they may utter a long, lower-pitched &quot;raaaaauu&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
Zone-tailed hawks range from parts of southern Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas almost throughout inland Mexico and the central portions of Central America down into eastern Colombia, Ecuador, and more sporadically, into Peru, southern Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia, and northern Argentina. In winter, they generally withdraw from the U.S. and northernmost Mexico, with these populations wintering mostly in Oaxaca and the Yucatán Peninsula. They are also native to the Caribbean island of Trinidad. The hawks of Central America may be seasonally migratory, although their movements are not well known. Zone-tails sometimes wander out of their normal range, and the bird was once recorded in Nova Scotia.

They can adapt to various habitats across their broad range, including both closed and open ones and wet and dry ones. Often, the largest numbers are found in rocky areas with access to water. They often reside in coniferous or pine-oak forests as well as timbered canyonland, hilly riverine woods, dry open boscage and scrub, humid forests, and overgrown marshes. They may forage over ranches and even semi-desert, but always need at least scattered tree thickets for nesting. Furthermore, they may be distributed in elevation from sea level to , though are mainly found below in the north and in the southern reaches of the breeding range.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The bird&#x27;s flight feathers closely resemble those of the turkey vulture. Zone-tailed hawks soar with their wings held in a dihedral position (pointing slightly upwards), rocking from side to side, a flight style that parallels that of turkey vultures. Bird guides caution against confusing them with the much more common turkey vulture, but at a reasonable distance, one can distinguish them from vultures by their smaller size, the typical hawk shape of the wings and head, and the pale stripe on the tail. Since vultures frequently can be seen flying in numbers (groups are called &quot;kettles&quot;), zone-tailed hawks can mingle with them and are perhaps most often missed by the human eye in such kettles.

===Breeding===
The mating season of the species varies geographically but is almost always in the first half of the year. In the northern reaches of the range, the breeding season is mid-April through July, whereas in Trinidad and Ecuador, it is February through June. Eggs have been found as late as August in Colombia, implying only a loose breeding season in the true tropics. The mating pair performs a courtship display, which may include engaging in aerial loops, dives, and rolls with each other. The nest is typical of hawks: a big, bulky assemblage of sticks, lined with green leaves, usually built on the top or the main fork of a tree, in this case at above the ground. Typically, tall trees such as cottonwood or pine trees are selected, and the nest may be in the open or concealed by foliage. Occasionally, nests are found on cliffs.

The clutch comprises one to three, typically two, white eggs, often marked with brown. Incubation lasts for around 28 to 35 days and typically the female incubates, while being fed by the male, although the male may occasionally incubate. The young are semi-altricial at hatching and are covered in gray down. They grow slowly for the first 7 days of life and then considerably faster from 7 to 21 days old. As is common in raptors the older sibling often kills the younger one or outcompetes it for food; only occasionally do both survive to adulthood. The younger hatchling is sometimes referred to as the &quot;spare&quot; one since it may be tended to more directly if the first dies. The young fledge at 42 to 50 days, though are not typically self-assured fliers until around a week later. They may remain in their parents&#x27; care until the following breeding season, though in migratory populations, the young and adults often separate. There have been no extensive reports on longevity and mortality in the species.

===Food and feeding===
Unlike turkey vultures that do not normally prey on live animals, zone-tailed hawks are active predators. Therefore, some ornithologists believe that this mimicry tricks potential prey animals into not being alarmed when a zone-tail flies overhead. This hawk mainly preys on small birds and mammals (including bats, rats, mice, squirrels), but reptiles can be locally favored, including virtually any type of lizard, such as the common collared lizard, Yarrow&#x27;s spiny lizard, the crevice spiny lizard, and the mesquite lizard. Among the rats preyed upon are the tawny-bellied cotton rat and the white-eared cotton rat. In the north, California quail, along with possibly other quail species, chipmunks, and other ground squirrels seemed to be the favorite prey. Other birds preyed upon include red-shafted flickers, acorn woodpeckers, eared quetzals, Steller&#x27;s jays, yellow-rumped caciques, tropical kingbirds, and even eastern screech owls. Zone-tails also eat various young birds, having been observed preying on nestlings and fledglings of species as varied as herons and passerines. Zone-tailed hawks snatch young birds from trees or the ground without landing. Second-hand reports of predation on frogs, other amphibians, and fishes may be cases of misidentification of common black-hawks. Zone-tailed hawks are very active foragers, hunting almost exclusively by transects and random quartering in low flight at around over the ground. When approaching the prey, the hawk may try to use obstructing cover such as trees until it is within of the prey, an easy striking distance. Outside the breeding pair bond, these hawks are wholly solitary and are not known to hunt in pairs.

<doc id="913413" wikidata="Q577148" url="?curid=913413" title="Lake Manyara">
<text>Lake Manyara also known as Lake Moya among the Iraqw people is a lake located in Monduli District of Arusha Region, Tanzania and is the seventh-largest lake of Tanzania by surface area, at . It is a shallow, alkaline lake in the Natron-Manyara-Balangida branch of the East African Rift. The northwest quadrant of the lake (about 200 sq, km.) is included within Lake Manyara National Park and it is part of the Lake Manyara Biosphere Reserve, established in 1981 by UNESCO as part of its Man and the Biosphere Programme.

There are differing explanations for how Lake Manyara got its name. The name Manyara may come from the Maasai word &quot;emanyara&quot;, which is the spiky, protective enclosure around a family homestead (boma). Possibly the 600 m high rift escarpment hems in the lake, like the enclosure around a Maasai boma. Another theory is that the Mbugwe tribe, who live in the Lake Manyara area, may have given the lake its name based on the Mbugwe word manyero, meaning a trough or place where animals drink water.

== Hydrology and basin ==
Lake Manyara has a catchment area of about 18,372 km2 with elevations between 938 m and 3633 m above sea level. The lake is in a closed basin with no outflow, wherein water is only lost by evaporation. It is fed by underground springs, but the vast majority of the inflow comes from rainwater fed permanent and ephemeral rivers that drain the surrounding catchment. The lake&#x27;s depth and the area it covers fluctuates significantly. At its maximum, during the wet season, the lake is 40 km wide by 15 km with a maximum depth of 3.7 m. In 2010, a bathymetry survey showed the lake to have an average depth 0.81 m, and a maximum depth of about 1.18 m. In extreme dry periods the surface area of the lake shrinks as the waters evaporate and at times the lake has dried up completely. 
Lake Manyara is a soda or alkaline lake with a pH near 9.5, and it is also high in dissolved salts. The water becomes increasingly brackish in the dry season as water evaporates and salts accumulate. During dry spells, large areas of mud flats become exposed along the shore. These alkaline flats sprout into grasslands, attracting grazing animals, including large herds of buffalo, wildebeest and zebra. The Western side of the lake is flanked by a steep rift escarpment, to the North are the Ngorongoro highlands, while in the East and Southeast an undulating plain with isolated volcanic mountains gives way to a peneplain. Several springs, streams, wetlands and smaller lakes, both perennial and seasonal, drain into the lake. The shores of the saline lake host at its Northern tip the town of Mto wa Mbu with its irrigation agriculture. On its Western side there is a groundwater forest extending between the lake shore and the rift escarpment and covered mostly by the National Park until the Marang&#x27; forest. In the rift valley South of the lake vast river floodplains are used for irrigation agriculture. The wetter and more productive uplands all over the catchment are mostly used for rain-fed agriculture by various ethnicities depending on historical migration and resettlement patterns. The drier and more unpredictable savannas are used for livestock grazing by pastoralists (mainly Maasai). Southeast of LM another large and famous national park (Tarangire) is located. Furthermore, all over the catchment there are numerous game reserves, conservation areas, forest reserves, wildlife management areas and numerous villages and touristic infrastructures (roads, lodges and tented camps).

== Threats and protection ==
Lake Manyara is partly protected within the Lake Manyara National Park and is one of the seven Tanzanian, UNESCO Man and Biosphere reserves. The wider Lake Manyara basin social-ecological system suffers from multiple environmental problems due to unsustainable land and water use. Lake Manyara has experienced an overall upward trajectory in sedimentation rates over the last 120 years with distinct peaks in the 1960s and in 2010. The increased sedimentation rates are largely a result of a complex interaction between increased upstream soil erosion following land cover changes and natural rainfall fluctuations.
== Fish ==
The main fish species inhabiting the lake are catfish and tilapia. There is a small fishery, but fish only tend to be found near the inflow areas, where salt concentrations are lower. Lake Manyara is the type locality for the endangered fish &quot;Oreochromis amphimelas&quot;, a species of in the cichlid family, endemic to Tanzania, found in Lake Manyara and a number of other saline lakes with closed basins. Exploitation is prohibited in the parts of Lake Manyara within the National Park and the protected park areas provide important seed stock for the replenishment of fished populations.

== Birds ==
Lake Manyara National Park is known for flocks of thousands flamingos that feed along the edge of the lake in the wet season. At times, there have been over an estimated 2 million individuals of various species of water birds. The following table summarizes the most numerous species, according to the Important Bird Areas factsheet: Lake Manyara.
== Visiting Lake Manyara ==
Lake Manyara can be accessed through Lake Manyara National Park. With an entrance gate that doubles as an exit, the trail into the park is effectively a loop that can be traversed by jeep within a few hours. The trails goes through forests shrublands and marsh, before reaching the shore of the lake. The Rift Valley escarpment provides a spectacular backdrop.

From the nearby town of Mto wa Mbu, through the Cultural Tourism Programme, it is possible to organize a canoe trip on the lake, or a fishing trip to learn traditional fishing methods. Bicycle trips to the east shore of the lake can also be arranged.

<text>Fear (commonly stylized as fear) is the third studio album by American alternative rock band Toad the Wet Sprocket. The album is their second album for Columbia Records, and was released on August 27, 1991. It became the first commercially successful album for the band, selling over a million copies and was certified platinum three years after release, on September 1, 1994. The album reached #49 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top 200 Albums in September 1992. Two of the album&#x27;s singles charted in the US top 40, &quot;All I Want&quot; and &quot;Walk on the Ocean&quot; which peaked at #15 and #18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, respectively.

== Background ==
Toad the Wet Sprocket&#x27;s first album, &quot;Bread &amp; Circus&quot;, was financed and recorded by the band in eight days for $650 in 1989. The band sold copies of the album on cassette, eventually signing with Columbia Records after recording their second album, &quot;Pale&quot;. Despite an offer from Columbia to restart the sessions for &quot;Pale&quot;, the band decided to continue to record the album by themselves at a cost of $6,000, and re-release it with Columbia.

The songs for the album were recorded at Granny&#x27;s House, Reno, Nevada. &quot;fear&quot; was produced, recorded and mixed by Gavin MacKillop, a role he would reprise for the band&#x27;s next two releases, 1994&#x27;s &quot;Dulcinea&quot; and 1997&#x27;s &quot;Coil.&quot;

Columbia financed the mixing of fourteen songs for the album, with twelve to be released. The two songs left off the album, &quot;Good Intentions&quot; and &quot;All in All&quot;, were both released on the 1995 rarities collection &quot;In Light Syrup&quot;, along with several other tracks recorded during the &quot;fear&quot; sessions. The band members were in disagreement over &quot;All in All&quot; and &quot;All I Want&quot;, and eventually &quot;All I Want&quot; was chosen to complete the record.

<doc id="913437" wikidata="Q925988" url="?curid=913437" title="Eleazar Wheelock">
<text>Eleazar Wheelock (April 22, 1711 – April 24, 1779) was an American Congregational minister, orator, and educator in present-day Columbia, Connecticut, for 35 years before founding Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. He had tutored Samson Occom, a Mohegan who became a Presbyterian minister and the second Native American to publish writings in English. Before founding Dartmouth, Wheelock founded and ran the Moor&#x27;s Charity School in Connecticut to educate Native Americans. The college was primarily for the sons of American colonists.

==Early life and education==
Eleazar Wheelock was born in Windham, Connecticut, to Ralph Wheelock and Ruth Huntington, who had a prosperous farm of 300 acres. He is the great-grandson of the first teacher of the first free school in the United States (see Dedham, Massachusetts), the Rev. Ralph Wheelock. In 1733, he graduated from Yale College, having won the first award of the Dean Berkeley Donation for distinction in classics. He continued his theological studies at Yale until he was licensed to preach in May 1734.

==Marriage and family==
Two months after beginning as pastor of a church, on April 29, 1735, he married Sarah Davenport. She died in 1746. They managed a farm in addition to his pastoring, and he was an itinerant preacher during the 1730s and &#x27;40s.

He married a second time to Mary Brinsmead, a widow with two children. In total he had eight children with his wives and two step-children.

==Career==
Wheelock was installed as the pastor of the Second Congregational Church of Lebanon Crank, Connecticut (now Columbia, Connecticut), in February 1735 and served as their minister for 34 years. Wheelock also acted as an itinerant preacher during the Great Awakening, a religious revival that had begun to sweep the Connecticut River Valley around the time of his graduation from Yale. He was one of its greatest proponents in the state, serving as the &quot;chief intelligencer of revival news&quot;.

In addition, Wheelock was deeply concerned about Native Americans in New England, whose numbers had declined rapidly due to disease, warfare and social disruption, including continued encroachment on their lands by colonists.

Wheelock &quot;was a long-time slave owner&quot;.

==Christian missionary==
In 1743, Wheelock took in a student named Samson Occom, a Mohegan who knew English and had converted to Christianity in his childhood. He taught Occom for four years; the youth was a ready student, learning to read and write in Hebrew as well as deeply studying theology. After preaching for several years to the Pequot people in Montauk on eastern Long Island, Occom was ordained in Suffolk County, New York, as a Presbyterian minister. He returned to Connecticut to preach to the Mohegan and later organized Christian Indians as the Brothertown Indians.

Wheelock&#x27;s success in preparing Occom for the ministry encouraged him to found a school in Columbia, Connecticut, for Native Americans. He planned to teach the boys in both secular and Christian subjects, so they could return to their native culture as missionaries. The girls would learn &quot;housewifery&quot; and English skills including reading and writing. Charitable contributions from New England and England supported the Moor&#x27;s Charity School, which was located on Columbia&#x27;s town green. Some students became homesick or even ill and died; few became missionaries.

==Establishment of Dartmouth and presidency==
After sending Occom and another minister on a speaking tour of England to raise money for the charity school, Wheelock decided to enlarge it, as well as adding college classes for the education of American colonists in the classics, philosophy, and literature. He began to search for another location for the schools. Wheelock obtained a charter from King George III on December 13, 1769. Having worked and raised funds for the education of Native Americans, Occom and the British Board of Trustees headed by Lord Dartmouth opposed the addition of the college to benefit the sons of the colonists.

Wheelock kept the lord&#x27;s donation and named the college after him, as Dartmouth College. He chose Hanover, New Hampshire, for the location and became the college&#x27;s president. In 1771, four students were graduated in Dartmouth&#x27;s first commencement, including Wheelock&#x27;s son John. While some Native Americans attended Dartmouth, it primarily served the sons of American colonists.

Wheelock died during the Revolutionary War, on April 24, 1779. He is buried in Hanover. His writings include &quot;Narrative of the Indian School at Lebanon.&quot;

==Legacy and honors==
*Wheelock, Vermont, in Caledonia County is named for him.
*During World War II a Liberty Ship (Maritime Hull Number 0038) was named for Wheelock. This was a C-2 cargo ship outfitted to carry 550 troops. It participated in the Normandy Invasion and is frequently mentioned in the book &quot;The Far Shore&quot; by the American author Max Miller.

<text>Abraham Bing (1752–1841) was the Oberrabbiner (Chief Rabbi) of Würzburg, and a Rosh yeshiva there. 
He trained several prominent German rabbis.

==Biography==
Bing received his rabbinic training from the talmudist and kabbalist Nathan Adler. (The latter trained, amongst others, Moses Sofer).

From 1769 to 1778, he served as &quot;Klaus&quot; rabbi (rabbi of a small synagogue) in the town of Offenbach am Main. Between 1778 and 1796, he served as &quot;dayan&quot; (rabbinical judge) in Frankfurt, and from 1796 to 1814 he served as rabbi of the town in Heidingsfeld, near Würzburg (Bavaria). In 1813 he was able to overturn a previous 250-year-old decree banning Jews from settling in Würzburg proper, and in 1814 he assumed the rabbinate of the city, where he also served as the head of a large &quot;yeshiva&quot; (rabbinic seminary).
He was an opponent of the nascent Reform movement. 

Several of his pupils played a major role in nineteenth century Orthodoxy in Germany and abroad:

* Nathan Marcus Adler (chief rabbi of the United Kingdom and author of &quot;Netinah la-Ger&quot;)
* Seligman Baer Bamberger (rabbi of Würzburg, founder of the Würzburg teachers&#x27; seminary)
* Isaac Bernays (rabbi in Hamburg and teacher of Samson Raphael Hirsch and Azriel Hildesheimer)
* Jacob Ettlinger (editor of &quot;Der Treue Zionswachter&quot;, teacher of Samson Raphael Hirsch and Azriel Hildesheimer and author of &quot;Aruch la-Ner&quot;)
* Jakob Löwenstein (author and rabbi in Baden)
* Abraham Rice (rabbi in Baltimore, Maryland)
* David Seligmann Weisskopf (rabbi of Wallerstein District, founder of Wallerstein yeshiva)

Rabbi Abraham Bing died in Würzburg in 1841, having resigned from the rabbinate two years earlier. Of his writings, only &quot;Zichron Avraham&quot; (&quot;Remembrance of Abraham&quot;) was printed (posthumously, edited by Bamberger).

His son, Issochor (Isachar) Abraham Baer Bing (1777–1878) was a writer and cloth merchant. His grandson, Salomon Bernhard Bing (1816–1878), was a cloth dyer and later a wealthy hops merchant. His great-grandsons were Ignaz Bing (1840–1918) and Adolf Bing (1842–1915), the co-cofounders of the large Bing Brothers enamelware and toy company in Nuremberg; Ignaz was also a writer, naturalist, and cave explorer.

<text>Deborah A. Servitto, born February 17, 1956, in Sewickley, Pennsylvania, is a Judge on the Michigan Court of Appeals, District II. She received national attention when, as a Macomb County Circuit Court judge, she delivered her ruling in the case of &quot;Bailey v. Mathers&quot; partially in the form of a rap rhyme.

==Judicial career==

Servitto served as a judge on the 37th District Court from 1986 to 1990, then on Macomb Circuit Court from 1990 until 2006. In March 2006 Servitto was appointed to District II of the Michigan Court of Appeals which covers Oakland, Macomb and Genesee Counties. She was elected for a full six-year term in November 2006, then re-elected in 2012. She also served as a judge in the inaugural term of the Michigan Court of Claims. Servitto holds a B.A. in Political Science from Oakland University and a J.D. from the Detroit College of Law (now the Michigan State University College of Law).

==&quot;Bailey v. Mathers&quot;==

As a circuit court judge, Servitto presided over a case in which DeAngelo Bailey sued Eminem (real name Marshall Mathers) over allegedly defamatory lines in the song &quot;Brain Damage&quot; from the 1999 album, &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot; that said &quot;I was harassed daily by this fat kid named D&#x27;Angelo Bailey. An eighth-grader who acted obnoxious, cause his father boxes. So every day he&#x27;d shove me in the lockers.&quot;

Servitto&#x27;s October 17, 2003 opinion dismissing the case became well known because part of the decision is written in rap-like verse. Servitto&#x27;s rhyme included the lines: &quot;Mr. Bailey complains that his rep is trash / So he&#x27;s seeking compensation in the form of cash / Bailey thinks he&#x27;s entitled to some monetary gain / Because Eminem used his name in vain&quot; and &quot;the lyrics are stories no-one would take as fact / They&#x27;re an exaggeration of a childish act / It is therefore this court&#x27;s ultimate position / That Eminem is entitled to summary disposition.&quot;

<text>The South Carolina House of Representatives is the lower house of the South Carolina General Assembly. It consists of 124 representatives elected to two-year terms at the same time as U.S. congressional elections.

Unlike many legislatures, seating on the floor is not divided by party, but is arranged by county delegation – a legacy of the original apportionment of the chamber. Until 1964, each of South Carolina&#x27;s counties was a legislative district, with the number of representatives determined by the county&#x27;s population. It meets from the second week of January into May.

==History==
In Colonial times, there was a Commons House of Assembly.

==Qualifications and terms==

Representatives are considered part-time citizen legislators who serve two-year terms. Representatives are elected at-large by their district, and there are no term limits. Representatives must be 21 years of age before they are eligible to become a representative.

<doc id="913498" wikidata="Q1565170" url="?curid=913498" title="HMS Pandora (1779)">
<text>HMS &quot;Pandora&quot; was a 24-gun sixth-rate post ship of the Royal Navy launched in May 1779. The vessel is best known for its role in hunting down the mutineers in 1790, which remains one of the best-known stories in the history of seafaring. &quot;Pandora&quot; was partially successful by capturing 14 of the mutineers, but wrecked on the Great Barrier Reef on the return voyage in 1791. HMS &quot;Pandora&quot; is considered to be one of the most significant shipwrecks in the Southern Hemisphere.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Pandora&quot; was a 24-gun, 9-pounder, &quot;Porcupine&quot;-class post ship. The class was designed by Surveyor of the Navy John Williams in 1776; it was an enlarged version of the &quot;Sphinx&quot; class, also designed by Williams. Ten ships of the class were ordered in total, with the first agreed on 25 June. &quot;Pandora&quot; was the ninth ship to be ordered, such occurring on 11 February 1778.

Contracted out to Adams &amp; Barnard of Grove Street, Deptford Dockyard, she was laid down on 2 March and launched on 17 May 1779 with the following dimensions: along the upper deck and along the keel, with a beam of and a depth in the hold of . The ship measured 524 tons burthen, having cost £5,716 3s. 10d. to build. The fitting out process was completed at Deptford on 3 July, costing a further £5,909 13s. 10d.

&quot;Pandora&quot; had a crew complement of 160. She was armed with twenty-two 9-pounder long guns on her upper deck, which armament was supplemented with two 6-pounder long guns on the forecastle.

==Early service==
&quot;Pandora&quot;″s first service was in the Channel during the 1779 threatened invasion by the combined fleets of France and Spain. The ship was deployed in North American waters during the American War Of Independence and saw service as a convoy escort between England and Quebec. On 18 July 1780, while under the command of Captain Anthony Parry, &quot;Pandora&quot; and captured the American privateer &quot;Jack&quot;. Then on 2 September, the two British vessels captured the American privateer &quot;Terrible&quot;. On 14 January &quot;Pandora&quot; captured the brig &quot;Janie&quot;. Then on 11 March she captured the ship &quot;Mercury&quot;. Two days later &quot;Pandora&quot; and were off the Virginia Capes when they captured the sloop &quot;Louis&quot;, which had been sailing to Virginia with a cargo of cider and onions. Under Captain John Inglis &quot;Pandora&quot; captured more merchant vessels. The first was the brig &quot;Lively&quot; on 24 May 1782. More followed: the ship &quot;Mercury&quot; and the sloops &quot;Port Royal&quot; and &quot;Superb&quot; (22 November 1782), the brig &quot;Nestor&quot; (3 February 1783), and the ship &quot;Financier&quot; (29 March). At the end of the American war the Admiralty placed &quot;Pandora&quot; in ordinary (mothballed) in 1783 at Chatham for seven years.

== Voyage in search of the &quot;Bounty&quot; ==
&quot;Pandora&quot; was ordered to be brought back into service on 30 June 1790 when war between Great Britain and Spain seemed likely due to the Nootka Crisis. However, in early August 1790, five months after learning of the mutiny on HMS &quot;Bounty&quot;, the First Lord of the Admiralty, John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham, decided to despatch the ship to recover the &quot;Bounty&quot;, capture the mutineers, and return them to England for trial. &quot;Pandora&quot; was refitted with four 18-pounder carronades and her nine-pounder guns were reduced to twenty in number.

&quot;Pandora&quot; sailed from the Solent on 7 November 1790, commanded by Captain Edward Edwards and manned by a crew of 134 men. With his crew was Thomas Hayward, who had been on the &quot;Bounty&quot; at the time of the mutiny, and left with Bligh in the open boat. At Tahiti they were also assisted by John Brown, who had been left on the island by a British merchant ship, &quot;The Mercury&quot;.

Unknown to Edwards, twelve of the mutineers, together with four crew who had stayed loyal to William Bligh, had by then already elected to return to Tahiti, after a failed attempt to establish a colony (Fort St George) under Fletcher Christian&#x27;s leadership on Tubuai, one of the Austral Islands. The disaffected men were living in Tahiti as &#x27;beachcombers&#x27;, many of them having fathered children with local women. Fletcher Christian&#x27;s group of mutineers and their Polynesian followers had sailed off and eventually established their settlement on the then uncharted Pitcairn Island. By the time of &quot;Pandora&quot;″s arrival, fourteen of the former &quot;Bounty&quot; men remained on Tahiti, Charles Churchill having been murdered in a quarrel with Matthew Thompson, who was in turn killed by Polynesians, who considered Churchill their king.

&quot;Pandora&quot; reached Tahiti on 23 March 1791 via Cape Horn. Three men came out and surrendered to Edwards shortly after &quot;Pandora&quot;″s arrival. These were Joseph Coleman, the &quot;Bounty&quot;″s armourer, and midshipmen Peter Heywood and George Stewart. Edwards then dispatched search parties to round up the remainder. Able Seaman Richard Skinner was apprehended the day after &quot;Pandora&quot;″s arrival. By now alerted to Edwards&#x27; presence, the other &quot;Bounty&quot; men fled to the mountains while James Morrison, Charles Norman and Thomas Ellison, tried to reach the &quot;Pandora&quot; to surrender in the escape boat they had built. All were eventually captured, and brought back to &quot;Pandora&quot; on 29 March. An eighth man, the half blind Michael Byrne, who had been fiddler aboard &quot;Bounty&quot;, had also come aboard by this time. It was not recorded whether he had been captured or had handed himself in. Edwards conducted further searches over the next week and a half, and on Saturday two more men were brought aboard &quot;Pandora&quot;, Henry Hilbrant and Thomas McIntosh. The remaining four men, Thomas Burkett, John Millward, John Sumner and William Muspratt, were brought in the following day. These fourteen men were locked up in a makeshift prison cell, measuring , on the &quot;Pandora&quot;″s quarterdeck, which they called &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot;.

On 8 May 1791, &quot;Pandora&quot; left Tahiti and subsequently spent three months visiting islands in the South-West Pacific in search of the &quot;Bounty&quot; and the remaining mutineers, without finding any traces of the pirated vessel. During this part of the voyage fourteen crew went missing in two of the ship&#x27;s boats. Nine of them were on the &quot;Matavy&quot;, a schooner built by &quot;Bounty&quot; crew members and called by them &quot;Resolution&quot;. It had been commandeered to serve as a ship&#x27;s tender but lost sight of &quot;Pandora&quot; near Tutuila at night. By chance, during their voyage to Batavia these nine became the first Europeans to make contact with the people of Fiji. At Tubai a &quot;Bounty&quot; anchor was recovered by . Apart from a few spars discovered at Palmerston Island, no traces of the fugitive vessel were found. Edwards continued the search until August, when he turned west and headed for the Dutch East Indies. Ironically, a set of islands the Pandora sailed to but did not land at were the Pitcairn Islands; had he checked his charts and found that this uncharted island was at the correct latitude but wrong longitude for Pitcairn Island, ironically he could very well have fulfilled his mission of taking into custody the last nine Bounty mutineers.

In the meantime the &quot;Pandora&quot; visited Tokelau, Samoa, Tonga and Rotuma. They also passed Vanikoro Island, which Edwards named Pitt&#x27;s Island; but they did not stop to explore the island and investigate obvious signs of habitation. When passing Vanikoro, Santa Cruz Islands in the Pacific Ocean on 13 August 1791, smoke signals were observed rising from the island. If they had done so, they would very probably have discovered early evidence of the fate of the French Pacific explorer La Perouse&#x27;s expedition which had disappeared in 1788.However Edwards, who was only interested in prisoners, reasoned that mutineers fearful of discovery would not be advertising their whereabouts, so he ignored the smoke and sailed on. Sven Wahlroos, in his 1989 book, &quot;Mutiny and Romance in the South Seas&quot;, suggests that the smoke signals were almost certainly a distress message sent by survivors of the Lapérouse expedition, which later evidence indicated were still alive on Vanikoro at that time; three years after the and had foundered in 1788.

== Wrecked ==
Heading west, making for the Torres Strait, the ship ran aground on 29 August 1791 on the outer Great Barrier Reef. &quot;Pandora&quot; sank the next morning, claiming the lives of 35 men – 31 crew and 4 of the mutineers. The four prisoners lost were George Stewart; John Sumner; Richard Skinner; and Henry Hillbrandt (according to one history they drowned because their hands were still manacled; James Morrison&#x27;s hands were also manacled but he survived). According to 
Morrison account Stewart and Sumner were killed by a gangway; Skinner was out of Pandora Box but still manacled while Hillbrant was both manacled and trapped in Pandora&#x27;s Box; in fact if had not been for the action of James Moulter {Boatswain mate} opening up the scuttle hatch all the remaining Prisioners [with the exception of three released] and the Armor&#x27;s Mate Joseph Hodges would have gone down with the shipThe remainder of the ship&#x27;s company (89 crew and 10 prisoners, 7 of whom were released from their cell as the ship sank) assembled on a small treeless sand cay. After two nights on the island they sailed for Timor in four open boats, making a stop on Muralag (Prince of Wales Island) in the Torres Strait seeking fresh water. They arrived in Kupang on 16 September 1791 after an arduous voyage across the Arafura Sea. Sixteen more died after surviving the wreck, many having fallen ill during their sojourn in Batavia. Eventually only 78 of the 134 men who had been on board upon departure returned home.

Captain Edwards and his officers were exonerated for the loss of the &quot;Pandora&quot; after a court martial. No attempt was made by the colonial authorities in New South Wales to salvage material from the wreck. The ten surviving prisoners were also tried; the various courts martial held acquitted four of those of mutiny and convicted six, of whom three – Millward, Burkitt and Ellison – were executed on 29 October 1792 on board the man-of-war &quot;Brunswick&quot; at Portsmouth. Peter Heywood and James Morrison received a Royal pardon, while William Muspratt was acquitted on a legal technicality.

Descendants of the nine mutineers not discovered by &quot;Pandora&quot; still live on Pitcairn Island, the refuge Fletcher Christian founded in January 1790 and where they burnt and scuttled the &quot;Bounty&quot; a few weeks after arrival. Their hiding place was not discovered until 1808 when the New England sealer &quot;Topaz&quot; (Captain Mayhew Folger) happened on the tiny uncharted island. By then, all of the mutineers – except John Adams (aka Alexander Smith) – were dead, most having died under violent circumstances.

==Wreck site: discovery and archaeology==

The wreck of the &quot;Pandora&quot; is located approximately 5 km north-west of Moulter Cay on the outer Great Barrier Reef, on the edge of the Coral Sea. It is one of the best preserved shipwrecks in Australian waters. Its discovery was made on 15 November 1977 by independent explorers Ben Cropp, Steve Domm and John Heyer.

John Heyer, an Australian documentary film maker, had predicted the position of the wreck based on his research in the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich. His discovery expedition was launched with the help of Steve Domm, a boat owner and naturalist, and the Royal Australian Air Force. Using the built-in sensors of the Royal Australian Air Force P-2V Neptune, the magnetic anomaly caused by the wreck was detected and flares were laid down near the coordinates predicted by Heyer.

Ben Cropp, an Australian television film maker, gained knowledge of Heyer&#x27;s expedition and decided to launch his own search with the intention of following Heyer by boat; in this way Cropp found the &quot;Pandora&quot; wreck just before Heyer&#x27;s boat did. The wreck was actually sighted by a diver called Ron Bell on Cropp&#x27;s boat. After the wreck site was located it was immediately declared a protected site under the Australian &quot;Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976&quot;, and in 1978 Cropp and Steve Domm shared the $10,000 reward for finding the wreck.

The Queensland Museum excavated the wreck on nine occasions between 1983 and 1999, according to a research design devised by marine archaeologists at the West Australian and Queensland museums. Archaeologists, historians and scholars at the Museum of Tropical Queensland, Townsville, continue to piece together the &quot;Pandora&quot; story, using archaeological and extant historical evidence. A large collection of artefacts is on display at the museum.

In the course of the nine seasons of excavation during the 1980s and 1990s, the museum&#x27;s marine archaeological teams established that approximately 30% of the hull is still intact. The vessel came to rest at a depth of between on a gently sloping sandy bottom, slightly inclined to starboard; consequently more of the starboard side has been preserved than the port side of the hull. Approximately one third of the seabed in which the wreck is buried has been excavated by the Queensland Museum, leaving approximately for any future excavations.

==Legacy==
A pub in Restronguet Creek, Mylor Bridge, Cornwall, that dates to the 13th century was re-named &quot;The Pandora Inn&quot; in honour of HMS &quot;Pandora&quot;.

An islet in Ducie Atoll, in the Pitcairn Islands, is named after the ship, while another is named after its captain.

== In popular culture ==
HMS &quot;Pandora&quot; was digitally reconstructed and is featured as one of the sailable ships in the video game &quot;Ahoy&quot;.
